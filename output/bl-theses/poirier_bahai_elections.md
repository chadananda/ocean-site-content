ABSTRACT

How a society chooses its leaders influences the quality of leadership as well as the
decision-making processes those leaders use. The electoral processes of nomination and
electioneering affect who will choose to run for office, why they will run and the leadership traits
that are necessary to win positions. After election, the contributions of money and manpower
used to reelect the leader may adversely influence his/her decisions. Elected leadership does not
always reflect the diversity of the population with respect to ethnicity and gender. Women, in
particular, are often excluded from elected positions and find it difficult fully participate in local
and national communities.

This paper will examine, using an exploratory survey, a unique electoral and leadership
model which exists in the Bahá’í community. Leaders are elected locally, nationally, and
internationally totally without nomination, public discussion of candidates, and campaigning. All
members have the power to vote for anyone in the Bahá’ community in a genuinely universal
participative process.     The paper will explore the extent of servant and transformational
leadership in the Bahá’í model, its conceptual basis, and the participation of women and
minorities in the process. It will also illustrate how Bahá’ís view themselves, their relationship
to their leaders and the process of choosing qualified leaders. The Bahá’í model has implications
of leadership that transcend merely political applications. The attitudes and skills fostered in the
Bahá’í model maximize human capacity in both leaders and followers and carry over into the
workplace as well as the home.       The model is based on spiritual principles that foster active
participation and performance of all members in any organizational setting.

Introduction
Background

How a society chooses its leaders influences the quality of leadership as well as the
decision-making processes those leaders use. The electoral processes of nomination and
electioneering affects who will chose to run for office, why they will run and the leadership traits
that are necessary to win positions. After election, the contributions of money and manpower
used to reelect the leader and the desire to remain in office may influence his/her decisions.
Harm to the quality of leadership is done by forming coalitions and voting blocs rather than
looking at the qualities of character. In western society, electing leadership requires a lot of
money and time to campaign, which deflects financial and personal energy resources that could
be otherwise devoted to the benefit of the electorate. For example, in the 2004 United States
presidential election alone, candidates received over 880 million dollars in campaign
contributions (Open secrets, 2004). Much focus is on individual personalities which necessitate
self-promotion to get elected. The process of running for office also puts increased pressure on
the candidate to oppose positions of the opposite candidate in order to win instead of agreeing
and cooperating on solutions to problems purely for the sake of the public good. The need for
personalized power can overcome the need for socialized power. This influences leadership and
decision-making in ways that are sometimes detrimental to both the leader and to the governed.
Elected leadership does not always reflect the diversity of the population with respect to ethnicity
and gender. Increased cynicism and feelings of disenfranchisement are prevalent in western
electoral systems. Participation is decreasing as people feel ‘Why should I even try? My vote
won’t make a difference’. Many citizens become weary of the constant negativity and wrangling
between office holders. Michael Waldman stated in the New York Times, “Unfortunately, just as
often scandals lead merely to cynicism and fatigue…”

As people who are in elected positions are often referred to as public servants, this title
implies that elected office is a type of servant leadership. Reality often indicates otherwise.
Charismatic, autocratic, and directive styles are often desirable leadership traits of office holders.
The system also inflicts incredible pressure towards corruption. Economist Paul Krugman
(2005), a New York Times Op-Ed columnist commented, “… inquiring minds want to know:
Who else is on the take? Or has the culture of corruption spread so far that the question is, who
isn't?”

However, other societies may experience better outcomes in the quality of leadership,
decision-making and development of grass roots leadership capacity using completely different
electoral and leadership models. This paper will focus on one such society, the Bahá’ís. The
Bahá’í Faith is a community whose adherents are drawn from all races, ethnicities and socio-
economic backgrounds. It is an independent monotheistic religion with a worldwide population
of some five million people. They come from more than 2,000 different tribal, racial, and ethnic
groups and live in 132,000 locations in 236 countries and dependent territories. Its foundational
principle is the unity of all peoples and religions. The decentralized structure of the Bahá'í
administrative system, although unified on a global level, allows for initiative and to a large
degree authority to be vested at the local level. Although it is primarily a religious system of
organization, its leadership and electoral methods can apply in many organizations, both
governmental and non-profit. Some features of its system are sought after and included in
training of non-Bahá'í organizations and governments (BIC, 1985). Bahá’í tablets and letters
have been addressed by its Founder to kings and leaders of the world:

In the Bahá'í writings, those individuals who are engaged in government service are
> exhorted to "approach their duties with entire detachment, integrity and independence of spirit, and
> with complete consecration and sanctity of purpose." Their personal fulfillment comes not from
> material reward but from "the devising of methods to insure the progress of the people," from
> experiencing the "delights of dispensing justice," and drinking from "the springs of a clear
conscience and a sincere intent." In the end, the "happiness and greatness, the rank and station, the

pleasure and peace" of the public servant does not consist in "his personal wealth, but rather in
> his excellent character, his high resolve, the breadth of his learning, and his ability to solve difficult
problems." [emphasis original] (BIC, 2001)1

There are three major, unique factors in developing effective leadership in the Bahá'í
model. They are (1) the process of selecting the leader, (2) the rules of consultation and conduct
governing the administrative decision-making process, and (3) the injunction to individual
believers to study and “deepen” themselves in the principles and teachings of Bahá'í Faith.
Trust in the consultative process and in the institutions (more than the individuals comprising the
institutions) is an important factor. This paper will focus more on the leader selection process
and only touch lightly on the decision-making process of the elected leadership and individual
responsibility for personal development, even though they are equally important factors in
ultimate leadership effectiveness.

The Bahá’í model of electing leaders is unique in political and religious systems. This
model was envisioned by Bahá'u'lláh (1817-1892) in the mid 1800’s, described in greater detail
during the lifetime of 'Abdu'l-Bahá (1844-1921) and formally organized on a worldwide basis by
Shoghi Effendi (1899-1957). Since there is no clergy, leadership of the Faith consists of group
leadership. Two institutions, one elected by the community and the other appointed by the
elected leadership manage the affairs of the community. Three leading figures of the Faith in its
formative years were Bahá'u'lláh, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi. They all exhibited strong
charismatic, transformational and servant leadership traits. Since their passing, the mantle of
leadership has passed, by their directives, to the community in the form of institutions currently
made up of the elected local, national, international and appointed bodies of leadership with
specific responsibilities and powers. Trust is paramount the relationship between the voters and
the institutions:

\[2\] See Glossary.

Governance is referred to in the Bahá'í writings as an expression of trusteeship,
> as the administering of a trust. Bahá'u'lláh speaks of the governors and administrators of
> society as "trustees" or the "trusted ones" of God. He also warns leaders that the vulnerable
> and the poor "are the trust of God in your midst."3 The concept of trusteeship implies, in
> some sense, a covenant between those who are in positions of authority and the
> members of the social polity that they are obligated to protect and serve. Consequently,
> trustworthiness is a vital characteristic of governance; it is the source of true
> accountability. Bahá'u'lláh describes trustworthiness as the "greatest portal leading unto the
> tranquility and security of the people," and "the supreme instrument for the prosperity of the world."4

"All the domains of power," He avers, ".are illumined by its light."5(BIC, 2001)

Since there is no formal clergy in the Bahá'í Faith, governing bodies which are
administrative in nature are elected to administer the affairs of the Faith. The local and national
bodies control local and national issues which include owning property in trust for the
membership, admitting new members, and organizing education and other projects that the
community wants carried out. In addition, the international body, the Universal House of
Justice, which gives guidance and direction to national bodies as well as individuals, has unique
powers of establishing laws governing the community that are not explicitly defined in the
written works of Bahá'u'lláh, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi. They are also the institution of
last resort in deciding disputes and appeals. The local community elects the Local Spiritual
Assembly (LSA) and also elects a delegate who votes for the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA)
in yearly elections. Members of all NSAs in the world elect the Universal House of Justice
(UHJ) every five years. All elections are by secret ballot. The membership on each of these
bodies is nine in number. The appointed bodies are advisory, beginning with the Continental
Counselors (continental in territory), chosen by the UHJ, who then choose Auxiliary Board
(regional in territory) members to assist them, who in turn, choose Assistants to the Auxiliary
Board (multiple communities within an area). Both of these institutions work closely together
and are complementary. Currently, there are 183 National Spiritual Assemblies, 9,631 Local

Spiritual Assemblies, 81 Continental Counselors, and 990 Auxiliary board members

> (The Bahá'ís, 2005). While both institutions are essential to the Bahá'í leadership model, this
paper will focus more on the elected institutions.

The Bahá'í model uses a purely democratic process of electing leaders, but it is done
> entirely without nomination or subsequent electioneering of a specific candidate in local,
> national and international bodies. Each voter must choose nine persons to serve according to the

effective leader.

“To be able to make a wise decision at election time, it is necessary for him
> to be in close and continued contact with all of his fellow believers, to keep in touch
> with all local activities, whole heartedly participate in the affairs of the community
> and through these actions develop a true social consciousness and acquire a sense of
responsibility.” (Shoghi Effendi as cited in Hornby, 1997).

Thus, it is incumbent for the voter to become “an intelligent, well informed and
> responsible elector” and through this action, increase the capacity of leadership in the voting
> individual.

This strict adherence to not discussing names of potential leaders may produce a different
outcome in the quality and type of leadership traits and a different outcome of the decisions of that
elected leader. A distinguishing feature of the Bahá'í system is that the institution to which the
person is elected possesses the power in the community, not the individual:

> While governance is often equated with government, it in fact involves much more.
> Governance occurs at all levels and encompasses the ways that formal government,
> non-governmental groups, community organizations and the private sector manage
> resources and affairs. Three factors that largely determine the efficacy of any system of
> governance are the quality of leadership, the characteristics of the governed, and the
> nature of the structures and processes employed to exercise authority and meet human
> needs.
> Bahá'ís attach great importance to cooperative decision-making and assign
organizational responsibility for community affairs to freely elected governing councils

at the local, national, and international levels. This hierarchy devolves decision-making
> to the lowest practicable level-thereby instituting a unique vehicle for grassroots
> participation in governance-while at the same time providing a level of coordination and
> authority that makes possible collaboration on a global scale. A unique feature of the
> Bahá'í electoral process is the maximum freedom of choice given to the electorate
> through the prohibition of nominations, candidature and solicitation. Election to Bahá'í
> administrative bodies is based not on personal ambition but rather on recognized ability,
> mature experience, and a commitment to service. Because the Bahá'í system does not
> allow the imposition of the arbitrary will or leadership of individuals, it cannot be used
> as a pathway to power. Decision-making authority rests with corporate bodies. All
> members of the Bahá'í community, no matter what position they may temporarily
> occupy in the administrative structure, are expected to regard themselves as involved in
> a learning process, as they strive to understand and implement the laws and principles
> of their Faith. Significantly, in many parts of the world, the first exercises in democratic
activity have occurred within the Bahá'í community (BIC, 2001)

The Bahá’í system appears to choose a high percentage of servant and transformational
leaders who are diverse in race, gender, formal education and socio-economic status. Servant
leadership is characterized by an attitude of service towards others (Greenleaf, 1997).
Transformational leadership uses appeals to followers’ values and their sense of higher purpose
(Hughes, Ginnett and Curphy, 2002). Although elections are yearly, except in the case of the
UHJ, which is every five years, those elected to office tend to be retained, especially in the
national and international bodies. Bahá’í elections are practiced successfully in both tribal and
industrialized societies. Corruption and disaffection by the electorate appears to be markedly low
when compared to the current democratic systems. Knowing more about leadership as it is
expressed in the Bahá'í community would add insight into effective democratic leadership.
Lessons learned from this case study of the Bahá’í leadership model can help to illuminate how
servant leadership is represented in a global community, which provides a meaningful
contribution to the management literature on leadership.

The Research Questions

The research questions for this study are: Does the Bahá’í system foster servant and
transformational leadership? Does the Bahá'í model diverge from the current definition cited in

leadership literature of servant and transformational leadership? What are the characteristics, if
any, that increase leadership quality, and the quality of the election process? These issues are
important to study for in a world of increasing strife and disunity, current leadership models
seem, at times, to inadequately address the needs of the world community made up of diverse
peoples and ways of governing. Society itself is changing rapidly and old models, once
adequate, can no longer fully serve the needs of the age.

Purpose and Scope

Although servant and transformational leadership are closely interrelated, it is beyond the
scope of this paper to conduct a detailed analysis of the differences between these two bodies of
literature. Thus, in this paper I will integrate published Bahá’í principles and teachings on the
subject of leadership, as well as survey data collected in the Baha’i community, and compare
them to existing literature on servant and transformational leadership in management. My
discussion of this exploratory study will highlight whether the participants perceive their elected
leaders to possess the traits of servant and transformational leaders, and whether or not they feel
they can select qualified leaders without nomination or electioneering. Other issues to be
discussed are whether the process develops the Bahá'ís’ own leadership capacity, reflecting
leadership diversity in terms of gender and ethnicity.

Literature Review
Servant Leadership

Greenleaf developed the concept of “Servant Leadership” in which he proposed that the
“servant-leader is servant first” (Greenleaf, 1977). A servant is one who serves others. He also
states that the servant-leader holds the organization in trust to the public it serves and the leader’s
behavior is grounded in a strong sense of values, more specifically, values of trust, respect and

service. He further states that it is the leader’s attitude of service towards his or her followers that
distinguishes the servant-leader from other types of leaders.

Greenleaf contrasts servant-leadership with the more traditional model of leadership where
the individual may begin with an aspiration to lead others. He presented the leader-first and
servant-first types of leaders as two opposite ends of a continuum. Greenleaf emphasized the
importance of a leader’s motivation to serve or to lead as an identification of servant-leadership.
Greenleaf claimed that leadership is primarily the result of personal characteristics rather than
special leadership techniques.

In Greenleaf’s vision of servant-leadership, the leader is first seen as a servant to others.

The servant assumes a non-focal position within the group, providing resources and support
without an expectation of acknowledgement. Through repeated servant behaviors, these
individuals eventually emerge as pivotal for group survival and are thrust into leadership
positions. Greenleaf suggests that these people were not initially motivated to be leaders, but
assume this position in response to the urgings of others and in response for the need for group
success. A servant-leader views leadership not as a position or status, but as an opportunity to
serve others. Personal development is not limited to the followers, but the leaders also benefit
from the developmental process (Smith, Montagno, and Kuzmenko, 2004).

Spears (1998) and Laub (1999) propose ten key elements of servant-leadership: listening,
empathy, healing (of oneself and others and awareness of others, situations and oneself),
persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people, and
building community. Reinke (2004) further refines the definition as one who is committed to the
growth of both the individual and the organization, and who works to build community within
organizations and links servant-leadership to an organizational culture of trust. She describes
servant-leadership as based on the idea that leadership is a relationship, not a position.

Servant-leadership, according to Greenleaf, improves organizational performance
because it fosters trusting relationships. Reinke further theorizes “that for trust to have its most
influential effects, it must be imbedded into the organization’s culture rather that existing only
among individuals”. In asking what creates or contributes to the culture of trust, Reinke states
that theory and empirical studies suggest that leadership, through the control of communication
channels and work conditions, plays a major role in building an organizational culture of trust.
She concludes by defining three components of a culture of trust: openness, vision, and
stewardship as a way to operationalize servant-leadership, and defines servant-leadership as
“leadership that puts the needs of others and the organization first, is characterized by openness,
vision and stewardship, and results in building community within organizations” It is also related
to the creation of trusting relationships which then result in improved organizational
performance.

Reinke also suggests further avenues of research, namely, that an organization’s culture
could play a powerful role in influencing how leaders behave, and in perceptions of trust. She
suggests using a more demographically diverse sample than she used in her own survey to find
out if cultural or racial differences affect how individuals perceive leadership and trust in
organizations. Cross cultural applicability of the servant-leadership concept is shown in “Servant
Leadership in the Bedouin-Arab Culture” by Yasin Sarayah as mentioned in Cunningham
(2004).

Marilyn Smith (as cited in Cunningham) focuses on the concept of Stewardship as a
component of servant-leadership in her article, “Steward Leadership in the Public Sector.” She
maps the concept of Stewardship from its religious roots to its application in the practice of
Public Administration. Servant leadership views a leader as a servant of his/her
followers…interest of followers before interest of leaders, …personal development and

empowerment of followers. Servant leader is a facilitator for followers to achieve a shared
vision.

Sendjaya and Sarros (2002) discuss at length the example of Christ as a servant leader
and imply the root of this leadership model is in religion. They also discuss the “Being” self
concept of servant-leaders, intent and motivation of servant leaders.

Feminist writer Eicher-Catt (2005) views servant leadership with more skepticism. She
posits that servant-leadership is not gender neutral and it is not possible to de-gender it because
“culturally we define and distort particular qualities such as empathy for others and persuasion as
naturally feminine or masculine characteristics.” Servant-leadership is a “myth” which has
overriding masculine connotations stemming from religious and patriarchal ideology.

In summary, the prevailing view in current literature defines servant leadership as a
relationship based in a strong organizational culture of trust and relationship that focuses on
service to others as the primary group dynamic. A few key elements or traits of servant leaders
include listening, empathy, healing, foresight, and stewardship (Spears, 1998). I will focus on
these characteristics for the purposes of this paper. A different type of leadership, which is
transformational leadership, is often considered similar to or related to servant leadership. The
next section will describe transformational leadership from the management literature.

Transformational Leadership

Transformational leadership occurs when a leader inspires followers to share a vision,
empowering them to achieve the vision, and provides the resource necessary for developing their
personal potential. Transformational leaders serve as role models, support optimism and
mobilize commitment, as well as focus on the followers’ needs for growth. (Bass, 1996, Bass &
Avolio, 1998, 1994a, 1994b) as cited in Smith (2004). Transformational leadership contains four

behavior components: charismatic leadership/idealized influence, inspirational motivation,
intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration.

According to Bass (1996) transformational leaders are tolerant of follower’s mistakes.

Transformational leaders involve followers in problem solving and are open to new ideas.
Individualized consideration refers to the role a transformational leader plays in developing
follower’s potential and paying attention to their individual needs for achievement and growth.
Intellectual stimulation refers to a leader’s behavior that encourages follower’s creativity.
Individualized consideration refers to the role a transformational leader plays in developing
followers’ potential and paying attention to their individual needs for achievement (Smith,
Montagno, and Kuzmenko, 2004). A transformational leader strives to create new learning
opportunities for followers and tends to act as a coach or mentor. Howell and Costly (2006) also
include coaching as part of servant leadership. Transformational leaders create and utilize two-
way personalized communications with followers (Smith, Montagno, and Kuzmenko, 2004).
Burns (1978:20) asserted that:

> Transforming leadership occurs when one or more persons engage with others in
> such a way that leaders and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation
> and morality… But transforming leadership ultimately becomes moral (italics in
> original) in that it raises the level of human conduct and ethical aspiration of both
> leader and led, thus it has a transforming effect on both.

Smith compares the components of transformational and servant leadership between Bass
and Laub. Transformational leadership is defined as having four conceptually distinct elements:
Charismatic leadership/idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and
individualized consideration (Bass, 1996). Servant leadership has six distinct components:
valuing people, developing people, building community, displaying authenticity, providing
leadership sharing leadership (Laub, 1999).

Smith, Montagno, and Kuzmenko (2004) examine the conceptual similarities of
transformational and servant-leadership and analyze the contribution both theories make to the

understanding of leadership. Transformational and servant-leadership are also rooted in the
study of charismatic leadership. A study by Graham (1991) compared Weberian charismatic
authority, personal celebrity, charisma, transformational leadership, and servant-leadership and
argued that charismatic leadership is the theoretical underpinning for each of these leadership
models. She concluded that both transformational and servant-leadership are both inspirational
and moral. She further suggested, however that the two models differ, and that servant-
leadership allows for more passive followers (emphasis added). So the separation between leader
and follower is more distinct, and followership is not an active component.

Howell and Costley (2006) cite another style of leadership that is related to
transformational leadership styles. Participative leadership includes followers in the decision-
making process in varying degrees. Participative leaders exhibit traits that include: integrity, a
socialized need for power, effective self-monitoring, listening skills, assertiveness skills,
empathy, social insight, and ability to manage conflict among followers. This type of leader
usually has legitimate, connection/resource, and expert power. However, for this paper I will
concentrate on servant and transformational leadership. A summary of the elements of servant
and transformational leadership and how they compare the Baha’i principles can be found in
Table 1.

Bahá’í Leadership

Bahá'í leadership is rooted in several foundational ethics. The most influential are: the
oneness of mankind, elimination of prejudice, and gender equity. These ethics set the stage for
servant leadership, for one cannot serve others whole heartedly without a genuine regard for
them. The servant leadership characteristics of receptiveness, listening, strong personal
relationships, valuing differences, and putting other’s needs first, as mentioned in Greenleaf
(1977), Sears (1998), and Laub (1999) are difficult to achieve without a true connection of hearts
and recognition of equality. Sendjaya and Sarros (2002) imply that the root of the servant-
leadership model is religion. In the Bahá'í Faith, service is paramount. This example was set by
the sacrificial service of its founder and initial leaders, Bahá'u'lláh, 'Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi
Effendi and continues abundantly among the adherents of the Faith. Service is a theme
throughout all the Bahá'í scriptures and elevates the stations of servitude and humility to that of
drawing near to God. The Universal House of Justice reaffirms the virtues that are part of the
servant-leadership model in a letter to the U.S. governing body in 1991.

> These instructions of the beloved Guardian get to the very heart of what must be
> more deeply internalized by the members of your Assembly at this time. We repeat
> for emphasis the terms "extreme humility", "open-mindedness", "candor",
> "modesty"; and we underscore the openness which is implicit in candor,…

Assemblies, not individuals, constitute the bedrock of leadership in the Bahá'í model.

This emphasis on institutional over individual leadership is a unique feature of the Bahá'í
leadership model and gives the power to the community. As noted earlier, Assemblies are the
elected local, national and international institutions which decide the affairs of the Faith.
Members who are in appointed positions, which closely collaborate with the Assemblies, must
also exhibit the same virtues of humility and obedience to group decisions. The Bahá'í teachings
strongly discourage individual personalities from seeking personal power and popularity. This
does not preclude, however, initiative and service offered by capable individuals. The balance is

“not dictatorial authority but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the spirit of frank and
loving consultation.” (Shoghi Effendi, 1968)

As to the responsibilities of the members, service before self as stated by Greenleaf
(1977) is the standard to which Bahá'í leadership must aspire.

> The members of these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard utterly their own
> likes and dislikes, their personal interests and inclinations, and concentrate their
> minds upon those measures that will conduce to the welfare and happiness of the
> Bahá'í Community and promote the common weal.(Shoghi Effendi, 1923)
Leadership becomes another avenue of service rather than a position. Greenleaf (1977) also
emphasized that leadership was not a position or status, but an opportunity to serve others. The
Bahá'í model strongly emphasizes this concept.

> They should never be led to suppose that they are the central ornaments of the body
> of the Cause, intrinsically superior to others in capacity or merit, and sole promoters
> of its teachings and principles. They should approach their task with extreme
> humility, and endeavour by their open-mindedness, their high sense of justice and
> duty, their candour, their modesty, their entire devotion to the welfare and interests
> of the friends, the Cause, and humanity, to win not only the confidence and the
> genuine support and respect of those whom they should serve, but also their esteem
> and real affection. (Shoghi Effendi, 1968).

Relationships with the institutions and community are stressed in the Bahá'í literature, advising
members to consult with assemblies before embarking on initiatives, and even consulting with
them about personal matters. The close and complimentary collaboration between the elected
and appointed institutions also mirror this emphasis on relationship. This does not, however,
imply that an individual must obtain permission from the institution before any action. Rather, it
is the idea that collective wisdom is more effective than one individual, and collaboration
produces the best outcome. Decisions involving more than one or two individuals take more
time, and are cited as one of the disadvantages of group decision-making. However, one could

\[6\] From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Bahá'ís of America, Australasia, France,
Germany, British Isles, Italy, Japan and Switzerland, published in "Bahá'í Administration: Selected Messages 1922-
1932", p. 41

also posit that time is saved by not having to remedy poor decisions that individuals acting alone
can make. Developing the habit of consultation in organizational and personal relationships
fosters an egalitarian ethic and develops capacity of all the participants.

> The essence of the relationships between Bahá'í institutions is loving consultation
> and a common desire to serve the Cause of God rather than a matter of rank or
> station (UHJ, 1999).

The Bahá'í writings in numerous places mention the elected leadership as “trustees” and
state that their actions must exhibit the highest level of service, virtue and trustworthiness. The
electorate is exhorted to choose those individuals, upon conscientious reflection, who best
exhibit these qualities.

> The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive,
> radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction to His Divine
> Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience and long-
> suffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted Threshold. (Compilations, 1991)

Bahá'ís are enjoined to be trustworthy in all their dealings and to trust the decisions of the
institutions.

> Trustworthiness and an active morality must become the foundation for all
> leadership if true progress is to be achieved. Moral leadership, the leadership of the
> future, will find its highest expression in service to others and to the community as a
> whole.(BIC, 1998)

One unique aspect of the Bahá'í consultative process happens when the institution makes a
collective decision. After all views have been heard and a vote taken, all must “wholeheartedly”
support the decision, even if some feel it is incorrect. The wisdom underlying this is that if the
decision is in error, but all are united behind it, it will soon become apparent and rectified. If all
do not support the decision, it will never be clear whether the decision failed because it was
incorrect or that it was undermined by lack of support. This implies a level of trust in the
institution as well as the process and creates a culture of trust as described by Reinke (2004). It

is also another one the many instances in the Bahá'í model that demonstrates the powerful role
the organizational culture plays in influencing how leaders behave.

The transformational qualities of leadership as cited by Bass (1996) also exist in the Bahá'í
model. As outlined in Laub (1999), Bahá'í institutions are active in fostering individual
development and act as a coach or mentor spurring the followers on to greater achievements.
They play a central role in developing community, serve as a facilitator in the development and
maintenance of the community and its unity, are expected to be authentic, and motivate the
community through inspirational appeals. Bahá'í institutions are encouraged to allow for
margins for mistakes as the community grows and encourage each other rather than resorting to
criticism at the slighted provocation. When problems arise, consultation is the preferred method
to solve them. A feeling of empowerment should be fostered within the community and
encouraging the involvement of individuals in the work of the community at the grassroots is a
primary goal. Since it is the institution, and not the individuals that make it up, that possess the
leadership position, leadership is shared because of the model structure.
The attitude of those in leadership positions should be such that:

> They must at all times avoid the spirit of exclusiveness, the atmosphere of secrecy,
> free themselves from a domineering attitude, and banish all forms of prejudice and
> passion from their deliberations. They should, within the limits of wise discretion,
> take the friends into their confidence, acquaint them with their plans, share with them
> their problems and anxieties, and seek their advice and counsel…(Shoghi Effendi,
> 1968)

Moral leadership is an important aspect of both transformational and Bahá'í leadership models. It
influences both the leaders and the governed.

> Trustworthiness and an active morality must become the foundation for all
> leadership if true progress is to be achieved. Moral leadership, the leadership of the
> future, will find its highest expression in service to others and to the community as a
> whole. It will foster collective decision-making and collective action and will be
> motivated by a commitment to justice, including the equality of women and men,
> and to the well-being of all humanity. Moral leadership will manifest itself in
> adherence to a single standard of conduct in both public and private life, for leaders
> and for citizens alike.
(BIC, 1998)

Transformational leadership fosters empowerment and shared leadership. This is exhibited
in Bahá'í consultation methods. The operating principles in the Bahá'í model of consultation
follow a set pattern that require a discipline of frankness and courtesy in expressing views with
the goal of finding the truth of a matter and attaining a solution rather than pushing an
individual’s agenda. It is a critical factor in the Bahá'í model of leadership, but is only touched
upon for the purposes of this paper.

> The second principle is that of detachment in consultation. The members of an
> Assembly must learn to express their views frankly, calmly, without passion or
> rancour. They must also learn to listen to the opinions of their fellow members
> without taking offence or belittling the views of another. Bahá'í consultation is not an
> easy process. It requires love, kindliness, moral courage and humility. Thus no
> member should ever allow himself to be prevented from expressing frankly his view
> because it may offend a fellow member; and, realizing this, no member should take
> offence at another member's statements. (UHJ, 1965)
Another marker of shared power, which can also motivate and inspire followers, is whether
or not the leadership reflects the diversity of the population led. This also influences the
transformational leadership criteria of role modeling, ethical conduct, fostering followers’ needs
for achievement and growth, and creating new learning opportunities. If the leadership in the
Bahá'í model is freely elected, we would expect it to reflect the diversity of ethnicity and gender
in its leaders. The foundational principle of the oneness of mankind in the Bahá'í Faith is the
driving factor in its culture.

Research Methodology

The research questions for this study are: Does the Bahá’í system foster servant and
transformational leadership? Does the Bahá'í model diverge from the current definition cited in
leadership literature of servant and transformational leadership? What are the characteristics, if
any, that increase leadership quality, and the quality of the election process? Thus, the
methodology aims to explore to what extent aspects of servant and transformational leadership
are reflected within Bahá’í community by collecting data on perceptions of leadership among
members of the Bahá’ís community, and more particularly, to see, via an email survey, the
attitudes Bahá’ís have regarding leadership.    Also, I will examine members’ perceptions of
other issues such as trust, which is a critical factor in Bahá'í leadership. Do they trust the
process, their leaders, themselves? Individual responsibility for one’s own actions is another
important aspect that I will examine.

I have been a Bahá'í since 1969 and my husband since 1971. I have participated in local
and national elections and served on a LSA. I have always noticed a marked contrast in the
prevailing spirit of Bahá'í elections and current American political elections, not to mention the
enormous savings in campaign and election costs. Locally, the quality of leadership varies
because of the small pool from which to choose, and in cases of only nine members in a
community, all are elected. But nationally and internationally, I was amazed at the quality of the
chosen leaders.

I was a teller, responsible, along with twenty others, for tallying the votes, during the
election for the first regional Bahá'í Council, in which members of LSAs of the Western states
voted for a newly instituted body. Since this was the first election, voters had no previously
elected Council members to reelect and the territory was large, in fact, so large that later the

region was divided into two new regions, Western and Southwestern. I was able to see first hand
how the votes fell when there was no campaigning or nomination of candidates and voters were
completely free to vote for any Bahá'í they chose. It was fascinating to see hundreds of people
receive votes, yet nine highly capable people were elected with a significant number of votes. As
a result, these observations raise questions about this model that warrants further study.

Data Collection

A nonrandom, exploratory email survey was sent to about 50 Bahá’ís around the world
who are known to myself and to my husband. Because of the diversity in the Bahá'í community,
we knew people of many races and ethnicities. Recipients were also asked to forward the survey
to one or two people they knew who were new Bahá’ís. Several recipients decided to forward to
regional general lists of Bahá'ís. Two hundred and forty nine responses were received during the
one week window of acceptance. Some responded with messages or questions, but the survey
was unreadable or appended unanswered. Those responses were not counted. Only people who
were English and computer literate could be included for logistical reasons. A series of
questions reflecting aspects of trust towards leaders and institutions, how the respondents chose
people, and respondents’ view of their own development of leadership capacity, were asked
using a Likert scale. The scale had a five point answer range from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly
disagree’ and ‘all of the time’ to ‘never’. Values were assigned as following; Strongly agree = 4
strongly disagree = 0 and Always = 4, Never = 0.

Additional questions were asked that reflect the criteria of servant and transformational
leadership, such as: listening, empathy, healing, fairness, openness, vision, putting the needs of
others first, stewardship, and relationship to the institutions. Appendix I includes a copy of the
survey. Three open ended questions were asked which gave the participants the opportunity to
express in their own words their opinions about what they feel during Bahá'í elections, what are

the most effective Bahá'í leadership qualities, and opinions regarding those elected. A total of
244 email survey responses were received. Some demographic questions were included such as
gender, location, ethnicity, age, English as a first or second language, length of time as a Bahá'í,
whether or not the respondent served on an elected or appointed institution and, if so, which
one(s) and length of service. Two hundred forty samples received, with four samples
unreadable and twentyone with corrupted or omitted questions. As responses were received, they
were entered into an Excel spreadsheet which corresponded with the specific questions.
Narrative answers were simply copied and pasted as is from the open ended questions. These are
located in Appendix II. Sometimes the respondent made significant comments to clarify a
specific answer in questions 1-43 and those were included under a heading, ‘Comments in
Questions 1-43’.

Results

The Bahá'í model includes aspects of servant, transformational, and participative
leadership as well as previously unmentioned characteristics. The survey addresses some, but
not all of the characteristics of servant and transformational leadership. Respondents in this
survey tended to be older, with a mean age of 46, although there was a larger standard deviation
of 1.24238. They were experienced Bahá'ís with a mean time as Bahá'ís of 3.704, with a rating of
three being equal to 11 to 20 years and a rating of four being equal to over 20 years.

Responses from the survey listed on Appendix III that include listening, empathy,
healing, and fairness, which are servant leadership characteristics as stated by Greenleaf (1977)
and Spears (1995) are important characteristics of Bahá'í leaders to the respondents. These four
scored high with a mean of the four characteristics of 3.57 out of a scale of 4 (strongly agree).
Healing was the least important with a mean of 3.064 and a higher standard deviation of 1.08845
and listening was the strongest of Greenleaf (1977)& Speer’s (1995) servant leadership
characteristics with a mean of 3.851. Perceptions of Bahá'í leaders putting the needs of others
first and exhibiting stewardship were high with means of 3.481 and 3.297 respectively.
Responses to the question, “The most effective Bahá'í leadership qualities are” demonstrated that
the respondents view Bahá'í leadership very closely to servant and transformational leadership
models. In the open ended response to the question, words such as; listening, humility, honesty,
trustworthy, self-sacrificing, ability to live with mistakes, consultative skills. etc., were prevalent.

Relationship factors stated by Sears (1998) and Laub (1999), such as being heard by the
institutions is slightly lower than needs of others and stewardship with means of 3.103, 2.913,
and 3.114 for the local, national and international institution respectively. The respondents
scored higher in perceptions of having a relationship with the local, national and international
bodies with respective means of 3.513, 3.165, and 3.355.
Trust in the institutions and in their decisions is also high. Trusting that wrong decisions made
by the institution functioning as a body will be corrected in the long run had a mean of 3.629
with a lower standard deviation of .78765. Decisions made by LSAs, NSAs and the UHJ were
perceived as fair with decisions made by the UHJ the highest with a lower standard deviation of
.70621. This also reflects that as the institutions go from local to international, trust in the
decisions as well as the capacity of its members increases.

As for feeling empowered as a quality of transformational leadership, respondents felt
their vote counted with a mean of 3.664 and they voted 80 to 100 percent of the time with a
mean of 5.491 with five being equal to 80-100% of the time and six being equal to every time.
There were a few who never voted but their answers also scored lower in the other characteristics
listed above. Examples of narrative responses to the question, ”When I participate in Bahá'í
elections, I feel,” are: discharging my sacred duty, empowered, privileged, happy, responsible,
honored, privileged to be part of process, connected, and hopeful for future.

Respondents felt their leadership capacity increased as a result of serving on various
institutions. They felt that they gained leadership and listening skills, with means of 3.330 and
3\.397 respectively, that were useful, with a mean of 3.617, and were transferable into work and
family life. Those respondents who were members of elected institutions maintained trust in the
process and decisions of their respective institutions, although from the narrative answers, they
recognized the problems inherent in nascent bodies that need maturation and which have limited
resources of human capacity.

Another dynamic, outside of leadership models, emerged. I was curious to see if the
respondents felt they could elect a quality leader without the ability to nominate or campaign by
voting either for people they knew or didn’t know. The responses indicated they did not have
difficulty knowing who to vote for with a mean of 1.065 with 1=seldom. Servant leadership is a
vibrant, participative, inclusive and active process in the Bahá'í model. Since the power resides
in the institution instead of individuals, and the institutions consist of the followers, the Bahá'í
model is not passive as Graham would conceive.

Although the Bahá'í model is similar, there is a distinction between Christian modes as
mentioned by Sendjaya and Sarros (2002) of servant leadership and Bahá'í models. Christian
modes only say that the greatest among you are those who love and serve. But Christ was not
addressing matters of governance; He was addressing simply a community of individuals, not
governments. The Baha'i model includes the need for there to be ranks, but those possessed of
rank must be humble. However, they must not be bashful about asserting the authority when it is
appropriate, because otherwise the structure fails. So “servant” does not mean “no structure” and
“no telling people what to do”, nor does it mean no deference and no obedience from the rank
and file.

> Above all else, leaders for the next generation must be motivated by a sincere desire to

Naturally, old ways of exercising power and authority must give way to new forms of
> leadership. Our concept of leadership will need to be recast to include the ability to
> foster collective decision making and collective action. It will find its highest
> expression in service to the community as a whole (BIC, 1996).

An important diversity indicator is gender. Deborah Eicher-Catt’s (2005) proposition that
servant leadership is not gender neutral and that qualities of service to others is viewed with less

value because of masculine and feminine characteristics does not fit the Bahá'í model. Service to
others is a human characteristic and is the highest aspiration of an individual. Service to others is
not subjugation to another human being, but a path of nearness to God. Bahá'u'lláh, 'Abdu'l-
Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi set the highest example of servant leadership by sacrificing their all for
the unity and betterment of humanity. Narrative responses described qualities of individuals
needed for election and did not refer to gender. In response to the question, “people who are
elected to Bahá’í institutions are:” words typically used were: “servants of Bahá’u’lláh”, “people
who are willing to serve” and “the best suited to the position”.

Participation by gender showed an interesting pattern with respect to participation by
females in the leadership process. The following graph shows the percentage of all respondents

Because of time constraints for this paper, appointed positions of leadership and their
effect on elected positions of leadership will be discussed at greater length in the future.
However, the graph suggests a strong participation of women, especially in the local positions.

To compare one country as an example, the following are the statistics of women holding elected
office in the United States.

> In 2006, 81 women serve in the U.S. Congress. Fourteen women serve in the Senate,
> and 67 women serve in the House. The number of women in statewide elective
> executive posts is 79, while the proportion of women in state legislatures is at 22.8
> percent.
> Congress: women hold 81, or 15.1%, of the 535 seats in the 109th US Congress — 14,
> or 14.0%, of the 100 seats in the Senate and 67, or 15.4%, of the 435 seats in the House
> of Representatives. In addition, three women serve as Delegates to the House from
> Guam, the Virgin Islands and Washington, DC.
> Statewide Elective Executive: In 2006, 79 women hold statewide elective executive
> offices across the country; women hold 25.1% of the 315 available positions. Among
> these women, 35 are Democrats, 40 are Republicans, one is an independent, and 3 were
> elected in nonpartisan races.
> State Legislature: In 2006, 1,686, or 22.8%, of the 7,382 state legislators in the United
> States are women. Women hold 409, or 20.8%, of the 1,984 state senate seats and
> 1,277, or 23.6%, of the 5,411 state house seats. Since 1971, the number of women
> serving in state legislatures has increased more than four-fold.( CAWP, 2006)
> Of the Bahá'í respondents currently living in the United States, 65.77% are women. Of
those elected to positions, both men and women, women comprise 63.37% of those elected to an
LSA, 55.17% were elected delegates to the National Convention, 66.67% have served on
Regional Councils, and 66.67% have served on an NSA. These statistics reflect those who have
at some time in their lives held an elected position. Bahá'ís tend to live all over the world and
move to new locations at different times in their lives. The United States statistics may include
offices held in the past in other countries. However, the proportion elected seems to closely
follow the proportion of the population.

Other statistics published in 1995 by the Bahá'í International Community indicate that the
proportion of female participation in Bahá'í leadership positions is less that this survey finding
but more than elected leadership in the general world. The survey found that women make up
30% of the membership of the elected national governing councils (NSAs) and 40% of the
membership of local governing councils (LSAs). Moreover, 47% of those (Auxiliary Boards)

appointed to inspire and advise the community at the sub-national and regional level are women
(BIC, 1995). The report also observes that:

> For the vast majority of the Bahá'ís in the world today, many of whom are the first in
> their families to become Bahá'ís, the values and habits they have been brought up with
> are not easy to shake. But by becoming Bahá'ís they commit themselves to a process of
> individual and social transformation, based on the fundamental reality of this age: the
> oneness of humanity. The equality of men and women is one important aspect of this
> principle. Thus the entire Bahá'í community is engaged in a shared struggle to overcome
> a variety of traditional prejudices, and its members are assisted in this struggle by the
> Bahá'í administrative institutions(BIC, 1995).

One method of overcoming gender bias in local elections is the appointment by the UHJ of
female Continental Counselors who, in turn, appoint Auxiliary Boards and Assistants. Close
collaboration of capable women with the LSAs and NSAs demonstrate to the community the
leadership capacity of women and help change attitudes in patriarchal societies. Another is the
strong advocacy in the Bahá'í and public arenas of gender equity though education of women and
girls. One principle in the Bahá'í Faith is universal compulsory education and all parents are
accountable to God for educating their children. In cases of limited resources, the guiding
principle for the parent is education of the girl before the boy.

Another striking observation that emerged was the ethnic, cultural and gender diversity of the
respondents. Voting for someone of a different race was common with a mean of 3.406 with 4 =
all the time and 3= most of the time. Of the 40 initial surveys sent out, 240 responses returned
and of those, 111 were from the United States.

Discussion

As previously mentioned, Bahá'ís are extremely diverse, not only in ethnicity but also in
culture, socio-economic status, and former religious background. This would imply that the
Bahá'í leadership model is effective across cultures, for the rules governing Bahá'í election and
leadership are the same world wide. This system not only allows for diversity of thought and
expression, but actually encourages and fosters it.

The primary difference in the Bahá'í model from current theories of servant and
transformational leadership is the concept of collective leadership. Current concepts of servant

or transformational leadership imply an individual who is the leader and his/her effect on the
followers. This leaves the followers open to an imposition of the arbitrary will or leadership of
individuals. The Bahá'í model does not allow this. The individual is responsible for his or her
own development. The culture of the Bahá'í community has a profound effect and impetus on its
leaders as well as its followers for it mandates a change in old notions and ineffective habits of
leadership.

The Bahá’í leadership model exhibits a high level of trust, listening, empathy, healing, fairness
and stewardship. The members feel personally empowered and responsible for their own
growth. The members are relatively diverse with respect to ethnicity and gender. Despite these
interesting findings the study has several limitations which are discussed in the following
section.

Limitations of the Study

This was a preliminary survey to test the waters, so to speak. As such, there are limitations in
its methodology. The following are some of the limitations of this study:

> 1. Nonrandom, “snowball” sample—limits generalizability of findings.
> 2. Computer literate and English speaking sample—potentially biases results.
3. Much more data received than time period for analysis, and the scope of the paper could

manage.

4. Survey not pretested and no reliability established—thus, these results are considered

very preliminary.

> 5. Ethnicity and gender in specific countries may not be native born.
6. Survey did not reflect enough new Bahá'ís—therefore the study reflects the views of

mostly experienced Bahá’ís.

Conclusions & Implications for Future Research

This exploratory study set out to determine any similarities or differences in the Bahá'í
model of leadership compared to current literature on servant and transformational leadership.
Using literature research and an email survey of nearly 250 Bahá'ís, I found that the Bahá'í
model strongly exhibits the characteristics of both servant leadership and transformational
leadership, although there are certain characteristics unique to the Bahá'í system. The Bahá'í
community is extremely diverse which indicates that it is a model that works in many cultures.
They seem to have created a system of elections and leadership that selects effective leaders
without the necessity of nominating candidates or campaigning for office. Observations of
leadership types and diversity have applications in general world. The Bahá’í method may shed
light on how effective, participatory leadership is developed in grassroots as well as national and
international organizations.

There are implications for reduction of corruption in leadership, for the electorate is fully
empowered to freely choose the best candidate without being coerced or unduly influenced in the
process. This, in turn, requires those elected to be fully accountable for their actions and thus
have a greater incentive to make decisions that are not self-serving. In the words of the
respondents, “The election is extremely fair….there is not the politicking that is so prevalent in
normal democratic elections” and “I also am continually amazed at how different Baha’i

elections are from the secular world. It is good to be involved with a process where I have to
pray for a decision as opposed to being bombarded by propaganda and media.”

The Bahá'í model envisions a higher, nobler definition of democracy, in which those in
positions of leadership are trustworthy, and selfless servants of the public good and the electorate
is fully empowered. The model provides for development of effective leaders, for every
individual has the opportunity to grow and learn as well as the obligation to be both a responsible
voter and leader. In response to the question, “People who are elected to Bahá'í institutions
are,” the overriding theme from the respondents was, “People who are elected to institutions and
serve are ordinary Baha’is who have arisen to the call of the Beloved to be of service to the
Bahá'í community and to humanity” and “Ordinary people asked to do extraordinary things.”

Fuller use of human administrative and leadership capacity can emerge when all people
are free to choose those whom they feel are best qualified for the position. People who are
capable servants, but quiet or shy, find an avenue where their special talents benefit the
community. Through the process of participation, members increase their capacity for effective
leadership in all areas of their lives. Leaders are challenged to rise above their preferences and
limitations and any sense of entitlement.

Inclusion of more diversity in decision making processes, ensures that the fairest fruit of
human thought is utilized in a broader model of leadership. Diversity also lessens the likelihood
of self-serving, ambitious individuals controlling others. The diversity of views and life
experiences balance the decision making process and encourage high quality decisions.

This exploratory study revealed many areas that are fertile for future research on this
topic. Several issues are worth exploring further. Bahá'í administration and its leadership model
was intended to operate in all cultures around the world. If servant and transformational
leadership are useful leadership styles, can they work successfully in all cultures that exhibit
diversity of cultural dimensions? If diversity of races, cultures and gender worldwide are

reflected in the body of Bahá'í leadership, this might imply that it does. If servant and
transformational leadership models do not work in all cultures, but the Bahá'í model, which
exhibits characteristics of both, does, then the question to be explored further, is: what are the
unique aspects of the Bahá'í model that enable it to succeed in every culture?
