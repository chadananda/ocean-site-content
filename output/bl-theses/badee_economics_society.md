Acknowledgements
The preparation, execution and completion of this dissertation has been made
possible through the unfaltering support of many people to whom I owe a debt of
gratitude. First and foremost, my sincere thanks go to my primary supervisor
Professor Sebastian Kim, who was a source of encouragement and inspiration for
me throughout this intellectual journey. His faith in my abilities motivated me to
continue my research. My thanks go to my other supervisors, Professor Pauline
Kollontai and Dr Susan Yore, for providing valuable and constructive comments
on different parts of this thesis. I am immensely thankful to the University of
Leeds and York St John University for giving me the opportunity to research on
the proposed theme. Throughout my research endeavour, many people touched
my life and accompanied me during this wonderful and exciting experience, and I
have had the opportunity of receiving valuable opinions from them. To them all, I
express my appreciation.

Within the Bahá’í community, I received guidance and support from the Supreme
Governing Body, the Universal House of Justice, the Office of Social and
Economic Development, and the Research Department at the Bahá’í World
Centre, as well as the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United
Kingdom. I am appreciative and owe a profound gratitude to several Bahá’í
scholars including Dr Shapoor Rassekh, Dr Vahid Ra’fati, Mr Mark Hellaby, and
Professor Farhad Rassekh, for their generosity in giving me their time and sharing
their valuable knowledge and insights.

Finally, the greatest source of support during the period of this research has been
my family, whose unwavering supports have been a part of this dissertation. My
special thanks to my son-in-law Sam, my daughter-in-law Jenny and my children,
Sahba, Vesal and Nawgole, for their assistance, valuable suggestions and
immense warmth and affection. The love, sacrifice and patience Vesal showed
with technical assistance and formatting of the thesis in addition to his very
helpful thoughts and ideas were received with great appreciation. While carrying
out this research, my life was blessed and made enjoyable by four grandchildren,
Kara, Lana, Lani, and the newest born grand daughter Mila, by their charm and
fascination and I hope in their own good time they will chose the path to serve the
humanity. There are never enough words to express my love and gratitude to my
wife, May, for her full support throughout this journey. Her sacrifices and advice
have been outstanding, and it is inconceivable how I could have finished this work
without her support.

Abstract: The Bahá’í faith has appeared at a time of global social and economic
integration and internationalisation of affairs. Therefore, it is timely to carry out a
systematic study of the extensive volume of primary writings of the Bahá’í faith on
economics and related subjects. This is the focus of this dissertation. This research
will further attempt to explore and develop the understanding of Bahá’í writers
and scholars on this subject, and systematise them in a fashion that is accessible to
academia, and beneficial to the Bahá’ís, the Bahá’í institutions and the wider society.
This requires extensive study of primary scriptures and institutional resources of the
Bahá’í faith. The discussion will be centered on the Bahá’í belief of unity as a core
principle and as a prerequisite for improving the material and spiritual life of the
Bahá’í community. Consequently, through a holistic approach this research links
spiritual principles to the material life of individuals and families. The proposition
is that a multi-dimensional solution based on the material and spiritual aspects of
life can influence human action and improve people’s quality of life. The thesis
argues that the role of economics is to attain a good life and the role of religion is
to educate and inspire people how to live a good life, hence the assertion is that
the Bahá’í faith as a religion and economics as a social science are
complementary in their aims and objectives. The two entities as social disciplines
would work well together in creating a better-balanced life and prosperous
communities. The inspired vision of this thesis is therefore not limited to the
Bahá’í community but also applies to the wider society. Without discarding the
existing economic systems, models and theories, the proposition is that the
exploration, appreciation and understanding of moral and spiritual principles of
the Bahá’í faith on economics would be harmonising and beneficial to all.

Chapter 1: Introduction
1\.1   Background
Living amongst both the poorest nations and the wealthiest nations of the world
for more than two decades, I witnessed extremes of poverty and wealth.1 It was
clear experiences and observations that such extremes and their effects on
people’s lives, both on the poor and the rich, are of great significance in
understanding and defining human well-being. This condition of affairs and living
disorder need to be addressed, by examining its causes and symptoms. The
multiple consequences of contemporary social and economic problems have
affected the whole of society, and the Bahá’í community as part of it. As a Bahá’í
(insider for this research), I was intrigued to learn how the Bahá’í teachings and
the Bahá’í community would respond to such challenges. Statements such as ‘The
fundamentals of the whole economic condition are divine in nature’2 and ‘spiritual
solution to economic problems’ are repeatedly appears, in one form or another, in
the Bahá’í scriptures and introductory literatures as one of the basic principles to
tackle contemporary economic issues. This requires an in-depth study of Bahá’í
teachings, and what the Bahá’í writings or approach has to offer to have an impact
on the Bahá’í community and the wider society.

1\.2   The aims and significance of this research
The principal purpose of this research is to explore the Bahá’í teachings on
economics and the way it contributes to the academic discourse, and its impact on

where he lived from 1984-1991, and subsequently to St. Vincent and the Grenadines from 1991-

the members of this faith. Furthermore, knowing and understanding the economic
principles of the Bahá’í faith can assist Bahá’ís to work towards building a
community based on spiritual and material foundation, as intended by its prophet-
founder, Bahá’u’lláh (chapter 1, section 1.7).

Economics has advanced immensely in last two hundred years and since the
publication of The Wealth of Nations in 1776 by the father of modern economics,
Adam Smith. Although during this period the actual wealth of nations has
increased substantially, at the same time the gap between high and low wage
earners has increased dramatically in most of the world, particularly since the
early 1990s. 3 This is despite strong economic growth that created millions of new
jobs. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to demonstrate that economics and
its relevant models and theories may have the ability to deal with many of the
contemporary economic problems so long as the processes and the end result
promote the common good and eliminate extremes of wealth and poverty.

Another significant aim of this dissertation is the proposition that moral incentives
ought to be one of the pillars of modern scientific economics. The perception is
not that economics, as a social science, and religion are the same, or generate the
same outcome, or have the same effect on people, but that the effective
partnership of the two fosters human well-being. It will be argued that religion
and economics combined are potent forces for resolving socio-politico-economic
challenges of our time. On one hand, the Bahá’í literatures advocate ending

discrimination, creating strong families, gender equality, poverty alleviation, and
exercising moderation, compassion, honesty, and good character. On the other
hand, economic literatures and academic textbooks emphasis the role of saving
and capital formation, sound use of money and banking, the specialisation and
trade, entrepreneurship, the role of government and legislation, efficient use of
resources, equilibrium in price system, and promoting growth and development.
Consequently, the two disciplines of religion as a spiritual realm and economics
as a social science, although different entities, together would be able to have
great impact on people’s well-being. Exploring this view, Bahá’í scholar and
development expert Haleh Arbab focuses on the significance of the role of science
and religion:

> Through science we explore the social and physical
> aspects of reality. Through religion we learn about
> spiritual principles that are expressions of the laws of
> material and spiritual existence and are built into the very
> structure of the universe. Religion reveals to us principles
> that are neither invention of the human mind nor social
> conventions but insights into reality. Science helps us
> apply these principles to the social reality in which we are
> immersed.4

According to this view, religion and economics have complementary aims and
objectives and together accelerate economic well-being of the whole society.

Shoghi Effendi (chapter 1, section 1.7), the Guardian of the Bahá’í faith
emphasises the significance of the Bahá’í writings on economics and the need ‘to

study the economic teachings in the light of modern problems more thoroughly.’5
The discussion of ‘modern problems’ in this research is based on my keen
awareness and understanding of events throughout the world, whether social,
political, economic, environmental and spiritual. Also, it is based on my academic
background as an academic economist. Modern problems are examined in light of
Bahá’í literature. It is notable to state that the Bahá’í faith has appeared in an age
of socio-politico-economic interdependency, and has addressed contemporary
problems through a great diversity of writings. These contemporary problems will
be studied and examined throughout this dissertation. Exploring Bahá’í teachings
while there is not yet a significant research on Bahá’í economics makes this
research more challenging, and at the same time, original and timely to the Bahá’í
community and to academia.

1\.3    Research questions
This dissertation explores the role of Bahá’í teachings in economics and their
implication for the Bahá’í community and the wider society. It examines and
discusses this topic by asking the following questions:
Is there a role for morality and spirituality in economics? The argument is based
on the idea that if economics creates relationships between people through
exchange and trade, then moral incentives would be a necessary condition for an
effective relationship. Moral codes of conduct become essential for an effective
operation of production, distribution and consumption, the three basic principles
of economics, and in the process of attaining a meaningful and enlightened

\[5\] Shoghi Effendi. ‘Letter dated 11 January 1933,’ quoted in True Foundation of All Economics, 3rd
ed., compiled by Hooshmand Badee, Toronto: Webcom Press, 2000, p. 22.

globalisation. This dissertation, in reference to the Bahá’í writings, suggests a
number of moral and spiritual principles for smoother operation of economic
principles.

What are some of the distinctive principles influencing Bahá’ís to participate in
the labour market to produce goods and services? This question is in reference to
Bahá’í work ethics. In the modern working environment, the focus is on the role
of technology and motivating the workforce to produce more through monetary
incentives. But, there is more than simply producing more: other factors need to
be considered, such as producing commodities that preserve the environment,
allocate resources efficiently, and are befitting human dignity. The Bahá’í
attitude, therefore, is beyond just producing more.

How do the Bahá’í principles more effectively influence the elimination of
extremes of wealth and poverty? This leads to a discussion of how Bahá’ís
attempt to develop a sustainable life-style. The discussion of improving economic
performance and increasing the total level of output, together with wealth
redistribution, would be inadequate and incomplete if a minority of the world
population possesses a large proportion of the world’s resources.

How does the Bahá’í concept of globalisation differ from the one currently
forming? Today the lives of people and organisations are interrelated and
interdependent    in   every     aspect:        economically,   socially,   politically,
environmentally, and spiritually. The future life of humanity is global and this is

more a certainty than an option. The challenge, however, is in the process adopted
for a meaningful global integration.

To what extent are the Bahá’í principles on economics being practiced within the
Bahá’í community? It will be discussed that the application of Bahá’í teachings on
economics, at this early period of the development of the Bahá’í community, is
challenging because there is no Bahá’í state or a Bahá’í government to fully
implement Bahá’í principles. Also, there is not a specific Bahá’í culture. Bahá’ís
are spread all over the world with diversity of cultures, and a part of socio-
politico-economic system of a country they live.

1\.4      Key words, definitions and concepts
The proposed title for this research is ‘Bahá’í teachings on economics and their
implications for the Bahá’í community and the wider society’. The direct key
words for this research are: economics, spirituality, Bahá’í community, and wider
society. These key words are discussed in this section:

1\.4.1      Economics
The conventional definition of ‘economics’ has some relevance to this research.
The term ‘economy’ comes from Greek oikonomia. The word denoted ‘household
management’ or a person skilled in this, hence the early sense of the adjective in
the late 16th century.6 If economy is ‘the arrangement … of a general system of
organisation,’7 then economics is the study of the economy. In wider society, the

\[6\] Oxford Dictionary of English. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2nd ed., 2005, p. 552.

household can be compared to a government that has responsibility for the
management of a nation’s resources for the benefit of the entire population; in the
same way a household ensures the management of the house and the well-being of
all members. In several of his writings, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (son of Bahá’u’lláh and his
successor, see chapter 1, section 1.7) uses this concept when explaining the
economic arrangement of society. For example, he said, ‘This household is not
well managed. This household is not living under perfect law.’8 He, then, refers to
a need for legislation to aid the proper functioning of a household, the whole
community or a nation, he said, ‘…a law must be given to this family by means of
which all the members of this family will enjoy equal well-being and happiness.’9
In this passage, using the concept of ‘household,’ ‘Abdu’l-Bahá talks about the
role of government in establishing legislation for ensuring the well-being is
created in an economy.

However, the conventional definition of economics as ‘household management’
may not be adequate expression for today’s world economy and a wider society,
which has expanded beyond the world known to the ancient Greeks. Perhaps we
ought to look at wider definitions. The modern definitions of economics are in
relation to the efficient use of scarce resources and their effects on each other. The
three main economic resources, land, labour, and capital, are known in economic
textbooks as factors of production.10 These resources are, however, inactive by
themselves, unless a fourth factor, such as the entrepreneur, uses them effectively

Bahá’ís of United States, Wilmette IL: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1979, p. 38.

to produce commodities. It is based on an interpretation of the definition of
modern economics where a relationship between human behaviour and economic
resources is considered. This view is supported by an earlier definition by an
economist and leading figure in British higher education Charles Robbins. As
early as 1932, Robbins defined economics as ‘The science, which studies human
behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative
uses.’   11

Leading development economist Michael Todaro’s definition of
economics is also relevant to this research. For Todaro, ‘Economics is a social
science. It is concerned with human beings and the social systems by activities to
satisfy basic material needs and non-material wants.’ 12 These definitions are
convenient for this research because they draw attention to the unique feature of
human beings, human society, and our everyday needs as a complex pattern of
behaviour towards sustainable production (chapter 2), distributive justice (chapter
3) sustainable consumption (chapter 4), and globalisation (chapter 5). Hence,
there is relevance between conventional and modern definitions of economics and
the Bahá’í perspective on the role of human behaviour in economics. For this
research, I consider economics as a social science, but also as ‘art’. ‘Art’, in a
sense that in using scarce resources, we need to use our creativity, ability, talent,
sensitivity and understanding, in a way that one enjoys and appreciate the finished
product or service.

Furthermore, the modern economic discipline is described in terms of ‘micro’ and

Publication, 1992, p. 26.

‘macro’ economics’. Economists have been concerned primarily with the problem
of making the best use of the world’s scarce productive resources at a single point
in time. Microeconomics studies this problem from the perspective of individual
firms and consumers. 13 Thus, microeconomics is about variables and entities, in
small scale that can be controlled by households and firms. Economic variables
such as price, supply and demand exist in relation to other variables such as
income and employment and they act together within a time factor to form a
system or a model. The results of all these interactions of variables lead to
developing phenomena such as surpluses and shortages of commodities affecting
supply and demand and relevant prices. People, households, firms, governments
and even countries can be considered economic variables interacting with other
variables of the same nature. Adam Smith and the classical school of economics
support this type of economics. Macroeconomics, on the other hand, is about how
large changes affect the system that the variables make up. The rules of
economics change; and what may be true of microeconomics in small-scale is not
necessarily true of macroeconomics for large-scale phenomena, such as
unemployment, economic growth, and export and import. John Maynard Keynes
is the founder of this type of economic discipline, which is known as
macroeconomics. An alternative economic discipline to support this discussion is
coined by author Marjorie Kelly, the Director of Special Projects with the
Democracy Collaborative, and is known as the ‘Generative Economy.’ Explaining
‘generative economy,’ Kelley asks, what kind of economy is consistent with
living inside a living being? This question is being answered in experiments

across the globe. Generative economy is about a life-style that is sustainable.
Hence, generative economy is defined as ‘a living economy that is designed to
generate the conditions for life to thrive an economy with a built-in tendency to be
socially fair and ecologically sustainable.’ 14 This view, to some extend, is
consistence with the Bahá’í view of efforts that inherently nurture the community
and respect the natural environment.

This notion concerns the structure of the system within which economic variables
act, and the way the system itself operates. The teachings of the Bahá’í faith, in
this analysis, are about ‘generative economics.’ They do not deal with the way
variables interact economically, for example, how much a person should be paid,
or the way systems behave, or the solution for poverty. This would explain why
‘there are practically no technical teachings on economics…’15 stated in the Bahá’í
writings. However, the Bahá’í teachings suggest what is morally possible for
individuals and firms, such as allowing charging a fair interest rate on loans; and
that economic systems are immoral if there are extremes of wealth and poverty,
rather than how an extreme might be defined. In the proposed model of economic
sustainability (chapter 7), micro and macro economic variables interact with each
other in close association with spiritual principles to influence the participants of
the market in making right choices and right decisions.

1\.4.2      Spirituality
The word ‘spiritual’ or ‘spirituality’ constitutes an important and inseparable part

\[15\] Shoghi Effendi. ‘Letter dated 25 January 1936’, American Bahá’í News, no. 103, p. 2.

of all faiths including the Bahá’í faith and hence it has much relevance to Bahá’í
discourse. In any discussion about Bahá’í teachings spirituality plays a central
role. Nevertheless, the word spiritual has been associated with a multitude of
meanings, religious and non-religious. There is an agreement among all of the
major religious systems that there is a non-observable spiritual reality above and
beyond material reality. Bahá’í scholar, philosopher and mathematician, William
Hatcher (1935-2005) maintains the view that ‘Spiritual dimension of existence is
more fundamental and more real than the material, and that the basic task of
human existence lies in learning how to relate properly to spiritual reality.’16
Although the terms spirituality and religion are commonly used interchangeably,
it is important to note that the term spirituality refers to the higher nature of
human beings, which Bahá’ís believe is innate in human being, however, it need
to be developed.

There is no precise agreement between theologians and social scientists, including
economists, about the precise meaning of topics that have some relevance to the
notion of spirituality, such as justice and trustworthiness. Some economists, such
as Karl Marx, keep their distance from phrases such as ‘divine economy,’17
‘spiritual enterprise,’18 ‘eco-justice,’19 and ‘spiritual economics.’20 Bahá’í scholar
and academic economist Farhad Rassekh has made a distinction between ‘anti-
religion thinkers like Karl Marx and those who do not see a role for religion in

economics.’ 21 Rassekh argues that there is a difference between religion and
spirituality:

> actually see religion as a negative force. Thus, some
> economists rather keep religion out of their work even if
> they believe in God. As a result, as far as their research
> and writings are concerned, they can be safely placed in
> the category of secular thinkers.22

Similarly, a number of existing researchers investigating spirituality have found
that spirituality can be viewed as a separate and identifiable concept that is
broader than the notion of religion. Academic education specialist, Kirsi Tirri, for
example, argues that ‘spirituality must be seen as a wider concept than religion.’23
Theologian and senior researcher in spirituality David Hay’s view is that ‘Surely
the unquestionable assumption that spirituality refers only to religion can’t be
right.’24 These various views suggest that spirituality and religion are separate yet
related concepts.

Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í scholars agree with some aspects of defining spirituality
and have attempted to reconcile theologians and social scientists in understanding
the concept of spirituality. Hatcher, for example, defines spirituality as: ‘The
process of the full, adequate, proper, and harmonious development of one’s …

capacities.’25 David Hay maintains that ‘Surely the unquestionable assumption that
spirituality refers only to religion can’t be right.’26 Hay refers to a new way of
thinking about spirituality that ‘will help us to get beyond the religious/secular or
believer/sceptic split.’27 Also, he argues that ‘…whilst pinning spirituality down to
an agreed definition seemed impossible, social scientists are able to recognise it
when they come face to face with it as a unifying factor.’28 Both Hay and Hatcher
are referring to the harmonious function and the higher nature of human being,
which social scientists become aware of when they face difficulties. The Bahá’í
view is that all humans are endowed with a higher nature but it needs to be
nurtured and developed. For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to the ‘higher nature of
human being [as] all-unifying agency.’ 29 It is this ‘all-unifying’ function of
spirituality that helps to resolve socio-politico-economic problems when we come
face to face with them. The belief in the ‘higher nature of human being’ inspires
individuals to act justly towards others. This can have great application in
economics in areas such as wealth redistribution, setting-up a business, employee-
employer relationships and issues related to the environment. The belief in the
‘higher nature of human being’ has also close correlation with the purpose of life
for a Bahá’í. The purpose of life is not simply satisfaction of one’s own needs and
enjoyment of material pleasures, but also involves service to one’s community
and the wider society.

In order to reconcile the viewpoints of theologians, social scientists and secular
thinkers, and having been inspired by the Bahá’í writings, I attempted to develop
a working definition of ‘spirituality’ for use in this dissertation. Although there is
so much diversity of opinions about the concept of spirituality, making a
definition is a difficult task, there are also a number of commonalities in this vast
body of scholarship that support the creation of a definition to satisfy both groups.
This definition not only includes the material side of life but also the higher nature
of human beings represented by qualities such as justice, trustworthiness,
compassion and honesty. Thus, the following definition attempts to resolve
conflicts and divisions, and is concerned with the ultimate purpose of life. This
dissertation defines spirituality as: ‘The process of unifying, developing and
interconnecting our life with the material world, with other people, with our
environment, and with the future generation, beyond ourselves.’ This working
definition of spirituality will be used throughout this dissertation.

This definition is also supported by a number of elements suggested by
researchers. It is in agreement with Hay’s interpretation of spirituality as a
unifying factor. Hence, recognising the harmonious function of spirituality, social
scientists become aware of it when they attempt at resolving conflicts and
divisions. A number of researchers have described spirituality as ‘relational’ in
nature. Transcendence may be characterised as one’s relationship with forces
outside of self; and hence one can discover meaning, purpose and connections
with other people, nature, and the future generation. The application of the
concepts of spirituality as ‘unifying’ and ‘relational’ factors is applied in the
Bahá’í inspired model of economic sustainability (chapter 7).

Spirituality, based on suggested working definition is a process and requires a
person to work towards acquiring it. Spiritual development and acquiring spiritual
qualities by individuals requires a life of learning and action and focuses on
human behaviours. Individuals, then, does actually highlight that collectively,
they tend to be greater contributors to the whole society. The interpretation and
understanding of spirituality as a relational concept is helping Bahá’ís and the
Bahá’í community in appreciating the principle of ‘work’ (chapter 2) and for
undertaking social and economic development programs in rural areas of
developing countries (chapter 6). A Bahá’í, for example, develops spiritually
through community service, by considering work as worship, doing humanitarian
activities, and effectively trying one’s utmost to be a productive member of
society. Spirituality is, therefore, concerned with some important objective of the
life, which requires a discussion on the process of how to attain it, otherwise its
worth and application would be challenged. Based on the working definition and
its features of unifying and relational, then alternative interpretation of spirituality
is possible for establishing social justice and satisfying social scientists. Hence, in
this research the term ‘eco-justice’ and ‘eco well-being’ are suggested as a method
of achieving socio-politico-economic objectives.

The suggested definition also helps the process of social transformation from
individual core values to affect the wider society. The acquisition of spiritual
qualities and moral behaviour is what the Bahá’í faith has in common with all
other religions. While this is true, Farzam Arbab has argued that in the Bahá’í
faith the goal of religious practice is shifted from individual salvation to the

collective progress of the entire human race, and this is reflected in the Bahá’í
teachings. The emphasis is on the qualities that must be acquired by each Bahá’í.
Arbab then discusses a number of individual core values that affecting the wider
society. For example, while charity, so essential to Christian theology is still
highly praised, justice is given a far more central place. In the same way, while
tolerance is recommended, those attitudes that lead to unity and human solidarity
are more appreciated. Some other values that affect the wider society and are
discussed by Arbab include:

> Love includes the abolition of all social prejudices and the
> realisation of the beauty of diversity in the human race.
> Detachment from the world is not taught in a way that
> leads to idleness and to the acceptance of oppression; it is
> acquired to free us from our own material interests in
> order to dictate ourselves to the well-being of others. To
> this expansion of the meaning of almost all qualities is
> also added a constant endeavour to acquire social skills, to
> participate in meetings of consultation, to work in groups,
> to express opinions with fairness and clarity, to understand
> the points of view of others, to reach and carry out
> collective decisions. Thus, the path of spiritualisation
> should not be confused with one that defines goodness
> passively and produce a human being whose greatest
> virtue is not to harm anyone; it is a path to create social
> activities and agents of change.30

Thus, spirituality, based on the suggested definition is a process and requires a life
of learning and action for a person to become a productive member of society.

1\.4.3    The Bahá’í community
Every religious organisation has its own ways of community social life guided by
a set of criteria such as membership, marriage, divorce and family-life, dead and
burial, worship and pilgrimage, and other community events. Some of these topics
will be discussed in this dissertation. The Bahá’í community comprises members
of the Bahá’í faith from every nationality, race, ethnic group, and religious
background across the globe. It has more than seven million followers. They
represent 2,112 ethnic and tribal groups and live in over 116,000 localities in 188
independent countries and 45 dependent territories.31 Such a mixture of people
makes the worldwide Bahá’í community a diverse group. The Bahá’í community
is not isolating itself from rest of the wider society. The community as a part of its
commitment of service to humanity, sponsors a large number of small-scale,
grassroots-based social and economic development projects, which cater for
anyone in need, not only Bahá’ís. The various activities of the Bahá’í community
and its involvement in socio-economic undertakings are discussed throughout this
research.

One of the distinguishing features of the Bahá’í faith is the presence of a set of
institutions to be in charge of the affairs of the Bahá’í community at local,
national and international level. Hence, a system of priesthood is replaced with a

\[31\] Bahá’í Statistics.‘Bahá’ís of the World’: Retrieved: <http://info.bahai.org/article-1-6-0-1.html>,
[accessed 12 May 2013].

system of administrative order. 32 Consequently, after the passing of Shoghi
Effendi, the Guardian of this faith (chapter 1 section 1.7), the affairs of the Bahá’í
community have been managed through an administrative order. The system of
Bahá’í administration is regarded by Bahá’ís as divinely ordained. It is
distinguished from other religious or secular forms of government, as Shoghi
Effendi points out,

> Bahá’u’lláh has Himself revealed its principles,
> established its institutions, appointed the person to
> interpret His Word who is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and conferred
> the necessary authority on the body designed to
> supplement and apply His legislative ordinances, the
> Universal House of Justice.33

With electoral and consultative principles, the Bahá’í administrative order
operates democratically at the local, national, and international levels. The
election of Bahá’í Local Spiritual Assemblies takes place each year on 21st April.
The Bahá’í election is theoretically and practically different from the electoral
processes currently practised, in that there is an emphasis on spiritual qualities and
service orientation, rather than material gain or power. Bahá’ís are free to vote for
any adult Bahá’í34 who they consider as loyal and faithful. Therefore there is no
nomination or canvassing. Shoghi Effendi states:

> …The strength and progress of the Bahá’í community
> depends upon the election of pure, faithful and active
> souls… Canvassing is deprecated ... Bahá’í elections of
> the community are … sanctified from all traces of
> canvassing and plotting that characterize the activities of

The Universal House of Justice (‫ – ﺑﻴﯿﺖ ﺍاﻟﻌﺪﻝل ﻋﻤﻮﻣﯽ‬Baytu’l-‘Adl-i-‘Umúmí) is a
nine-member body elected at five-year intervals by the entire membership of the
National Spiritual Assemblies (‫ ﺑﻴﯿﺖ ﺍاﻟﻌﺪﻝل ﺧﺼﻮﺻﯽ‬- Baytu’l-‘Adl-i-Khusúsí).
Currently there are 182 National Spiritual Assemblies. The Universal House of
Justice consults on issues pertaining to the welfare of the whole of humanity as
well as the affairs of the Bahá’í communities, and guides the Bahá’í world within
the framework of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. It was first instituted in 1963, and
its seat is in Haifa – Israel (Bahá’í World Centre). The Universal House of Justice
appointed ‘Bahá’í International Community’ as representative of the Bahá’í
community with International agencies.

Throughout this research, distinctions are made between Bahá’í community,
Bahá’í civilisation, and Bahá’í commonwealth. The Bahá’í community is one that
is comprised of registered adult Bahá’ís and children. The Bahá’í civilisation
refers to a future society where Bahá’í principles are applied, such as gender
equality (chapter 2, section 2.5.3), universal and compulsory education (chapter 2,
section 2.5.4), and the practice of Bahá’í consultative method of decision-making
(chapter 2, section 2.5.5). The Bahá’í commonwealth will be the final stage of the
Administrative Order leading to the promised Golden Age (chapter 5, section 5.5).

1\.4.4   The wider society
Bahá’ís are instructed to adopt a world-embracing vision. Statements such as ‘Be

\[35\] Shoghi Effendi. Quoted in Lights of Guidance, compiled by Helen Hornby, New Delhi: Bahá’í
Publishing Trust, 1988, p. 10.

intent on the betterment of the world…’36 and ‘The well-being of nations’37 and
‘We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations,’38 clearly
indicate that the prophet-founder of the Bahá’í faith is concerned about the well-
being of the entire society. Hence, in any academic discussion on socio-politico-
economic issues, the Bahá’í writers and researchers refer to the global features of
Bahá’í teachings. A familiar term in the Bahá’í writings, closely associated with
economic problems is the phrase ‘divine economy.’39 The Universal House of
Justice, the international governing body of the Bahá’í faith, referring to a letter
by Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian, states ‘it appears that the Guardian uses the term
divine economy not as a reference to a specific system of economics, but to
something broader and more general.’40 In this context, the general system of
organisation can be referred to as a holistic or wider society in that all parts of it
are interrelated and interconnected, and nothing can be understood in isolation but
as a part of the whole system.

Currently the Bahá’í community associates with the wider society in a number of
ways. The Bahá’í International Community (BIC) is an independent organisation
which is recognised by the UN, and with whom the UN co-operates. BIC affiliates
in over 180 countries and territories, representing the members of the Bahá’í faith
worldwide. One of the aims of the BIC is to seek to promote and apply principles

derived from the teachings of the Bahá’í faith that contribute to the resolution of
the current day challenges facing humanity. To achieve its purpose the BIC
interacts with the United Nations and its specialised agencies, governments and
other NGOs, and has presented papers and statements at world conferences and
meetings of UN bodies and agencies for a number of years. These include
contributions on such diverse subjects as food, population, women, international
trade, education, health, and the peaceful utilisation of scarce resources and the
environment. In May 1970, BIC gained consultative status with the United
Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); in 1976 at the United Nations
Children’s Funds (UNICEF), and in 1989, developed a working relationship at the
World Health Organisation (WHO).

As an active non-governmental and non-political member of the United Nations,
Bahá’ís are involved in the life of the society by participating in social and
economic development in their own communities by supporting local activities
such as interfaith groups and creating constructive dialogue to promote religious
unity, women empowerment, children, environment and racial equality net works.
Also, globally the Office of Social and Economic Development (chapter 6, section
6\.2) in Haifa-Israel has a relationship with, and is working with, various NGOs
that are working towards the advancement of communities. However, the
challenge for the Bahá’í community is its limited financial and human resources
and hence these activities are in small scale.

1\.4.5   The analogy of the family
Family is the backbone of the wider society. An important analogy that will be

used in a number of topics in this dissertation is the concept of human family. The
phrase ‘human family’ in the Bahá’í writings is used to portray the entire
humanity. It is stated that ‘The world of humanity has been described as a unit, as
one family.’41 Also, it is stated ‘…we are all inhabiting one globe of earth. In
reality we are one family and each one of us is a member of this family. We must
all be in the greatest happiness and comfort.’ 42 Hence, just as discipline,
organisation, cooperation, and association are necessary for the establishment of
family, so should there be similar discipline and procedures for the establishment
and advancement of society.

Thus, the analogy of family is useful in a number of discussions in this
dissertation including the view on globalisation (chapter 5), in clarifying the
concept of economic sustainability (chapter 7), and in discussing human, capital
and financial interdependency (chapter 7, section 7.6). The Bahá’í writings affirm
that ‘The family unit offers an ideal setting within which can be shaped those
moral attributes that contribute to an appropriate view of material wealth and its
utilization.’43 According to Loudon and Bitta ‘The concept of family or household
life cycle has proven very valuable for the marketers, especially for segmentation
activities.’44 This analogy is useful in discussing distributive justice (chapter 3,
section 3.2).

The use of the analogy of the family in economic activities is helpful, given the

similarities between the features and structure of a family and those of economics.
For example, partnership is one of the features of family. This is an approach
based on an explicit concept of a caring and helping process. It demonstrates how
a partnership enables parents and children to overcome their difficulties, build
strengths and resilience and fulfill their goals more effectively. The success of the
family as a socio-economic unit would be based on a bond of love and unity and
concern for the other; so should be the success of the economic operations in the
market. The integrity of the family is based on mutual love, trust, service to others
and sacrifices for one another. These qualities are essential for the family to
succeed, otherwise the family would become dysfunctional and chaotic and will
break apart. A family that applies the principles of love, trust, service and sacrifice
can cater for the varied needs of each individual in the family, even with limited
resources. In the family unit, the idea of division of labour applies too, where each
member has a different but complementary function. Thus, the analogy of family
is the pivot of all economic reciprocal relationships leading to activities of
production, distribution and consumption, be it between the members of the same
family, between families or between communities, local, national and interna-
tional. This is where we see a logical connection between moral principles and
economics.

There are however challenges when discussing the analogy of family. According
to Wesley Burr, Loren Marks and Randal Day:

> Most people do not need to be encouraged to be interested
> in their own welfare. This seems to come rather naturally
> to most humans, whereas being concerned about others
does not seem to come as naturally. The idea that the

> welfare of others is important is acquired only when
> people learn it as a part of their ideology or philosophy of
> life, and people need to be relatively mature to grasp this
> idea. 45

The Bahá’í view suggests that most people are altruistic by nature and have a
certain level of empathy and understanding to help others. To form a family, for
example, couples enter into an agreement or covenant with each other whereby
they concentrate on helping and supporting each other and their children. The
same applies to the human family whereby we use all our resources to produce
goods and services that benefit all its members through a justified exchange
mechanism, which is based on altruistic nature. However, the features and
functioning of a modern family are complex and it may not be so easy to use it as
an analogy for contemporary economic issues. The application of the analogy
would be more practical in smaller communities and in small-scale operations.

1\.5   Methodology
The exploration of Bahá’í teachings on economics is carried out through four
broad categories of sustainable production, distributive justice, sustainable
consumption, and globalisation. In addition, a field trip to Bangladesh was
undertaken to observe the visible contribution of a Bahá’í community to the
development of rural population. Also, a Bahá’í inspired model of economic
sustainability based on moral incentives is developed as a theoretical
representation of the impact of Bahá’í teachings on human conduct in creating a
more balanced economy. It is vital to note the interconnectedness of these

Families, London: Taylor and Francis group, 2012, p. 112.

groupings.

The methodology implemented, explores the relationship between religion and the
social and organisational sciences based on an assertion by the prophet-founder of
the Bahá’í faith, Bahá’u’lláh, that ‘human beings are spiritual by nature.’ The
challenge of this research is that the interpretation of the Bahá’í laws are
prohibited and I as an insider have certain limitation in interpretations of the
Laws. This, however, does not include the interpretation of social and economic
teachings such as moderation and human well-being, equity and equality, taxation
and expenditures, wealth creation and poverty eradication.

For the principal research methodology, it should be stated once again that the
theme of this research is the exploration Bahá’í teachings on economics and their
implications for the Bahá’í community and the wider society. Therefore, the
writings of three central figures of the Bahá’í faith, Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, along with the writings of the Guardian of the faith, Shoghi
Effendi, and the International Governing Body, the Universal House of Justice
allow to construct a framework for such a methodology. It is the relationship of
these writings which I find attractive and which will enable me to draw a range of
strands in my research together into a coherent whole. The ideal methodology for
this research is, therefore, a combination of observation, theoretical investigation
along with positive and constructive critical thinking.

Religious methodology, however, should be distinguished from scientific
methodology. Scientists have the advantage of gathering data through performing

various experiments. This leads to acquiring measurable information necessary for
analytical purpose. However, according to Bahá’í scholar Moojan Momen46 ‘in
religious studies minimal empirical studies are possible and much of the data
collected is unreliable.’ 47 He, therefore, suggest a holistic approach to be
implemented as a Bahá’í methodology, which as stated above could be a
combination of literature review, observation, critical thinking and logical
conclusion. Although, all practice is drawn from a Bahá’í perspective and as a
consequence analysis is related in a direct way to Bahá’í way of thinking with an
episcopal structure Bahá’í institutions. However, some comparison will be made
with other schools of economics and the views and writings of non-Bahá’í writers
and scholars where similarities and more widely applicable understandings of
oversight can be identified.

Extensive numbers of passages from the primary and secondary Bahá’í resources
on relevant topics are incorporated into the main body of this research as the basis
for the analysis of various subjects linked with economics. To assist further, it is
necessary to become familiar with specific terminologies used in this research.
The following statement from the Universal House of Justices addressed to the
candidate this research is a guide for appropriate terminologies that need to be
used in any academic research using Bahá’í writings:

This approach will be used for the organisation of this research for the extensive
use of Bahá’í Sacred Scriptures or primary resources, and the authorised
interpretation by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. The selected passages are
then adapted to specific topic, and subsequently they are explained, analysed,
compared, and interpreted, with consideration of challenges facing researchers in
Bahá’í discourse. The original and primary sources have been in Arabic and
Persian. It must be noted that the primary resources were originally written either
in the authors’ handwritings or by their secretaries concurrently during the
revelation, and sealed by the author. Shoghi Effendi subsequently translated a
number of these writings from Persian and Arabic into English. He, during his
own lifetime, mostly used the English language as a medium for correspondence
and communication with the Bahá’í world community in the West (Europe and
America). The Research Department of the Universal House of Justice is
continually engaged in further translations, and has been very supportive and
cooperative in providing the original writings needed and assisted in the
translation of a number of original quotes from the Persian language into English.
In addition, I have received necessary guidance on a number of subjects pertinent

to this research from four departments at the Bahá’í World Centre with
Department of the Secretariat of the Universal House of Justice, the Research
Department, the Office of Social and Economic Development, and the Office of
Huqúqu’lláh (chapter 3, section 3.7.6).

The state of the candidate of this research as an insider also has an effect on the
choice of a methodology. Theologian Ross Reat suggests the following
classification for insider and outsider for academic purpose:

> Every religious tradition, by its very existence and
> regardless of its claims to universality, divides the world
> into two sets: insiders of the tradition and outsiders to the
> tradition. Thus, broadly speaking, information about
> religions may be transmitted through four channels: (1)
> insider-to-insider, (2) insider-to-outsider, (3) outsider-to-
> outsider, and (4) outsider-to-insider.49

This kind of classification is appropriate for religious educations and in particular
researching comparative religious studies. The current research however, is not a
comparative religious study, and since the candidate of this research is a Bahá’í,
an insider-to-insider method works well for the title of this research. This
approach forms the basis for the methodology adequate to the academic purpose.
Likewise, as there is no room for the Bahá’í faith to have different denominations
or traditions, the emphasis of an insider would be on the Bahá’í community as a
single entity.

Misrepresentations of the Bahá’í writings by an outsider channel are possible. An

outsider may unintentionally misinterpret the writings due to lack of sufficient
knowledge, information and experience about the Bahá’í faith. Ross Reat refers to
‘faith’ and ‘belief’ as essential components of true presentation of religious views.
He makes a distinction between ‘faith’ and ‘belief’. According to him ‘…though
one’s insider-ship may be culturally determined, the more important criterion is
having a faith.’ In light of this discussion and a recent work of Wilfred Cantwell
Smith (1977; 1979), Reat writes,

> It is well to define the term ‘belief’ as it is used here, and
> to differentiate it from ‘faith,’ since Smith suggests that
> ‘belief’ may be an inappropriate term in the religious
> context and should be replaced by ‘faith.’ Here, belief
> certainly does not mean thinking something is true without
> being able to prove it. Instead, ‘belief’ involves sincere
> assent to certain fundamental, life-guiding propositions,
> with or without doubts.50

Paul Tillich has provided perhaps the most satisfactory definition of the insider.
The insider is, in Tillich’s terms, ‘…one who has an ‘ultimate concern’, which is
shared with others, and one who has adopted an approach to that concern, which
is also shared with others.’51 According to this view, neither the shared ‘ultimate
concern’ nor the shared approach need necessarily be religious which is precisely
the method adopted for this research. Consequently, care is taken in presenting the
Bahá’í resources in a way that is acceptable to the academia, with a degree of
critical analysis of Bahá’í teachings.

Another challenge in this research is the shortage of scholarly written materials
for an in-depth discussion of certain topics. This was resolved through face-to-
face interviews and electronic correspondence with Bahá’í institutions and

individual Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í scholars and writers. The face-to-face
interviews took place with necessary arrangements and preparations such as the
particulars of a topic to discuss, and a place to meet. Questions raised for such
interviews were in areas that needed more clarification or in depth discussion of
those topics related to this research. Examples include: Meeting with the office of
Huqúqu’lláh at the Bahá’í World Centre (April 2009) for clarification of the law
of Huqúqu’lláh in relation to principle of taxation. Also meeting with the Office
of Social and Economic Development at the Bahá’í World Centre (April 2009) to
discuss the selection of a social and economic development project for this
dissertation.

Two face-to-face interviews were carried out with prominent Bahá’í scholar
Shapour Rassekh in London on 28 December 2008, and in Chicago on 20 August
2013, seeking his views about the grouping of Bahá’í teachings on economics. He
suggested the grouping to be based on microeconomics and macroeconomics. The
type of grouping used in this research, although includes the above concepts,
introduces somewhat different terminologies that are close to the style of Bahá’í
writings. According to Rassekh, Bahá’ís should be cautious not to create a
separate Bahá’í economic system at this time. Vahid Ra’afati, the director of the
Research Department of the Universal House of Justice was also interviewed in
London on 27 December 2010, asking his views about creating a Bahá’í model for
this research. Like Rassekh, Ra’afati’s view was that the Bahá’í faith is not an
economic system and the development of models on Bahá’í discourse should not
be referred to as Bahá’í model, rather they should be in the name of researchers
developing the model. Hence, it should be emphasised that in chapter 7 of this

dissertation, the model proposed is a Bahá’í inspired model rather than a Bahá’í
model. The Bahá’í scholar Mark Hellaby was interviewed on three occasions in
2013-2015. Issues that needed more critical discussion on a number of Bahá’í
teachings such as the practical application of unity and gender equality were
discussed with him. He was also contacted through electronic correspondence on
four occasions to enquire about transliteration of original Persian and Arabic
terms in Bahá’í scriptures. Electronic communications were also carried out with
Bahá’í scholar Farhad Rassekh on ten separate occasions discussing and enquiring
his comments on a number of topics relevant to this research. His view on the
concept of spirituality and secular thinking is in agreement with other scholars
such Hatcher and Dahl. Bahá’í scholar Ian Kluge was contacted through
electronic correspondence regarding his views on the concepts of morality and
spirituality. Two interviews were conducted with Jabbar Eidelkhani, the director
of ‘Rahmanian Foundation,’ a Bahá’í inspired social and economic development
project in Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Among non-Bahá’í scholars, Mohammad Yunus,
a successful entrepreneur and the Nobel Prize Laureate from Bangladesh was
interviewed in Dhaka, Bangladesh on 12 March 2012. His views about the role of
‘Micro Credit’ in reducing poverty in Bangladesh and helping families; on the
role of education, family, and human rights on economic development and
poverty reduction greatly assisted this research. Two interviews were conducted
with professor Julian Stern, professor of theology at York St. John University
seeking his views about developing a working definition for spirituality for this
research.

In addition, a field trip is made to investigate a Bahá’í social and economic

development project in Bangladesh established in 1999 through the self-initiative
of individual Bahá’ís with extensive collaboration of the Bahá'í community of
Rajshahi in North of Bangladesh. The aim of the project is the upliftment of rural
and tribal children aged 11-16 living in small communities of Bangladesh who
have no or little prospect for education. The method employed for this field
research is a combination of literature review, observation and interviews.
Interviews took place within the school with the members of staff and with the
director of the project (chapter 6, section 6.5.1).

1\.6   Literature review
Although there have been numerous scholarly research material in various areas
of the Bahá’í faith, there has not been sufficient scholarly research papers on the
subject of economics. Furthermore, since the Bahá’í faith is one of the latest
religions (chapter 1, section 1.7), its resources would mainly include those written
and published by the Bahá’í authors, by the Bahá’í institutions, by associations for
Bahá’í studies, and by a number of non-Bahá’í writers and scholars, however
limited. The literature review for doing this work or for any Bahá’í discourse
requires introducing the writings of the central figures of the Bahá’í faith on
various subjects.

The writings of Bahá’u’lláh specific on the subject of economics are not found in
one book and require studying a number of his works. Some of the frequently
used writings of Bahá’u’lláh for this research include: The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Tablets
of Bahá’u’lláh, Hidden Words, and Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.
Shoghi Effendi regarded The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (‫…‘ )ﮐﺘﺎﺏب ﻣﺴﺘﻄﺎﺏب ﺍاﻗﺪﺱس‬as the Mother

Book of His Dispensation, and the Charter of His new World Order.’52 The Kitáb-
i-Aqdas (1973) is regarded as the book of laws, however, Bahá’u’lláh covers
many issues such as the Bahá’í institutions of the future, exhorting his followers
to moral and spiritual laws, as well as those laws that would have direct bearing
on economics, like the law inheritance (chapter 3, section 3.7.5), the law of
Huqúqu’lláh or the Right of God (chapter 3, section 3.7.6), and the Bahá’í work
ethics (chapter 2 section 2.4). Bahá’u’lláh mentioned the laws briefly and left their
explanations and interpretations to his successors. Subsequently, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and Shoghi Effendi expanded on many of these laws. Any further interpretation of
the laws of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas is banned. Passages from The Kitáb-i-Aqdas are
used frequently in this thesis. The Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh was published in 1978
under the supervision of the Universal House of Justice. It contains selected
tablets of Bahá’u’lláh revealed after The Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Some of these tablets
contain laws and exhortations related to various subjects that have directly or
indirectly influenced various discussions of this research. Examples include the
importance of education and training (chapter 2, section 2.5.4), and giving to
charity (chapter 2, sections 2.5.2). Another major compilation from the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, which was prepared by Shoghi Effendi, is Gleanings from the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. This is a collection of selected writings and extracts from
the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, which was first published in1935. The passages come
from a range of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings from around 1853 to 1892, which are of
profound and significant value in better understanding of the central beliefs of the
Bahá’ís and a glimpse of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh as they cover many spiritual
and social teachings of the faith. Another writing of Bahá’u’lláh frequently used

\[52\] Shoghi Effendi. God Passes By, Wilmette IL: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1987, p. 213.

in this research is The Hidden Words. Topics related to wealth and poverty, and
number of issues linked to moral and spiritual aspects of economics is found in
this popular writing of the founder of this faith. All these books are translated into
English language and easily accessible for this research. It is important to note
that some of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh are addressed directly to Bahá’ís, which
usually begins with ‘O people of Bahá,’ and some are addressed to the entire
humanity.

In similar fashion the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s that are directly or indirectly
related to the subject of economics are scattered in several books such as The
Secret of Divine Civilisation, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, and Paris
Talks. The Secret of Divine Civilisation was written in 1875, where he addressed
the king and the people of Iran (Persia). Although the contents of this book are
addressed to the people of Iran, they are relevant and can be applied to any
developing country. In this book ‘Abdu’l-Bahá discusses the elements of material,
social and spiritual progress and encourages the king and the people of Iran to
form a ‘just government’, establish ‘equity and be righteous,’ 53 discussing
different components of creating true happiness, the importance of wealth creation
and the use of modern technology, and he illustrates the path of how to advance
materially by for example referring to economic growth of Japan. As it is clear
from these topics and many others, the contents of this book have greatly
influenced this thesis. The Promulgation of Universal Peace is a collection of 140
talks given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá during his extensive tour of North America in 1912.

Similarly, Paris Talk is a collection of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talks delivered during his
tour of Europe between 1911-1913. Both books, The Promulgation of Universal
Peace and Paris Talk, are compilations that touch on a wide range of subjects
related directly or indirectly to economics and thus to this research, including
gender equality, universal peace, universal and compulsory education, abolition of
prejudices of all kinds, the need for a universal language, and the spiritual solution
to economic problems. Several other writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are used in this
research. A popular and philosophical book of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used in this research
is Some Answered Questions. This book was particularly useful for discussing
employee-employer relationship and wage determination.            Other writings of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used in a variety of subjects include Selections from the Writings of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Foundation of World Unity, and The Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Among the writings of Shoghi Effendi is The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. This is
a collection of some of the letters and messages from Shoghi Effendi to the
Bahá’ís around the world, first published in 1938. These letters present his clear
vision of the relationship between the Bahá’í community and the process of social
and economic development in the dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh. The World Order
of Bahá’u’lláh is an important Bahá’í resource that has inspired a number of
discussions in this thesis as the topics on the Bahá’í World Commonwealth, the
world government, and a number of characteristics of Bahá’í economics are
mainly elaborated in this book. This book is also of significant value in Bahá’í
administrative system. Thus, the three important parts of this thesis in relation to
moral, social, and economics are found in this work of Shoghi Effendi. Other

books quoted from Shoghi Effendi include the Advent of Divine Justice,
Directives from the Guardian (a compilation), God Passes By, Messages to
America, and Promised Day is Come.

The writings and messages of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme
governing council of the Bahá’í faith include statements, messages, and letters to
the Bahá’í institutions and individual Bahá’ís. A number of documents issued at
the Bahá’í World Centre are of special interest to this research. These include the
‘Ridván messages’ produced every year for the period. Ridván (‫ )ﺭرﺿﻮﺍاﻥن‬- meaning
paradise – is referred to a period of 12 days, 21 April to 2 May, during which
Bahá’u’lláh declared his mission publicly for the first time.54 The first day of
Ridván is significant as it is the beginning of the Bahá’í administrative year. In
their Ridván messages to the Bahá’í world, the Universal House of Justice
highlight the development of the Bahá’í community in the previous year, while
setting its future goals. These messages are of especial import because they
include up to date information that are vital for this research. Other issues
discussed in these massages include the state of social and economic development
of the Bahá’í community in particular, and the wider society in general; the
human rights issues; the plan for the establishment of new Bahá’í Houses of
Worship; and the situation of the Bahá’í fund for the maintenance of the Bahá’í
world Centre and Houses of Worship. References are also used from other
messages of the Universal House of Justice such as ‘Five Year Plans’. These

\[54\] The Festival of Ridván [Paradise] (20 April-2 May) is the greatest festival for Bahá’ís, it not
only has spiritual significance, but it is also a time for the re-election of the Bahá’í institutions.

Ronald, 1995.

short-term plans provide guidelines for the progress of the Bahá’í community and
its future development. These documents provide up-to-date, accurate, and
specific information about the Bahá’í community, which is immensely useful for
this research. In particular, two documents are of especial significant about the
Bahá’í perspective on development (chapter 6).

In addition to the above literatures, the documents and statements of the Bahá’í
International Community are used for a number of discussions. Among them is a
statement called The Prosperity of Humankind (1995). Like Jeffrey Sachs, Joseph
Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, this document asserts the need to ‘reshape all the
institutions of society’ in order to ‘accelerate humanity’s coming-of-age.’ The
three statements ‘Eradicating Poverty: Moving Forward as One’ (2008),
‘Religious Values and measurement of poverty and prosperity’ (1999), and
‘Human Rights and Extreme Poverty’ (1993), are used for discussing poverty
alleviation and income inequality from a Bahá’í perspective. The views expressed
in these statements are echoed with many contemporary socio-politico-economic
leaders, experts and academia around the world.55

The views of three notable Bahá’í scholars are significant for this research:
William Hatcher (1935-2005) is a specialist in the philosophical interpenetration
of science and religion. He held, for over forty years, university positions and
lectured widely in North America, Europe, and Russia. He wrote and published

\[55\] Other documents prepared by the Bahá’í International Community and suitable for this research
includes, 2010 statement, ‘Rethinking prosperity: Forging Alternatives to a culture of
consumerism.’ This document is useful in a number of discussions linked to consumerism,
sustainability, and spiritual principles of economics from a Bahá’í perspective. Also, 1993
statement, ‘World Citizenship: A Global Ethic for Sustainable Development.’ Retrieved:

more than 100 scholarly papers in English and French on subjects such as the
concept of spirituality, science and religion, Marxism, economics and the Bahá’í
faith, and universal values such as fairness and trustworthiness. His views and
writings on issues such as the concept of spirituality from a Bahá’í perspective,
and on various topics related to economics, have greatly assisted this research.
Although he made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics and
philosophy, he is perhaps best known for developing new ideas on the perception
of spirituality and logical proof of the existence of God. 56                     Unlike those
contemporary economists such as the founder of ‘monetarism’, Milton Friedman
who see monetary solution as the main approach to solve economic problems,
Hatcher believes that monetary policies will be more effective if accompanied by
moral incentives and spiritual principles. Inspired by the writings of the Bahá’í
faith, extensive research material are available by Hatcher which indicates that
moral and spiritual principles are able to improve productivity of the workforce
and improve organizational performance. Hence, for Hatcher, money is not the
only motivational factor, non-monetary considerations are important as well.

Another notable Bahá’í scholar whose writings and views in the area of
environmental sustainability are significant for this research is Arthur Dahl (1942-
).57 He has published numerous scientific papers and books including ‘Island
Directory’, ‘Unless and Until: A Bahá’í Focus on the Environment’ and ‘The Eco

\[57\] Arthur Dahl was the Deputy Assistant Executive Director of the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) and President of the International Environment Forum. He has consulted by
UNEP, World Bank, World Economic Forum and other international organizations on indicators
of development and sustainability, environmental assessment and observing strategies, coral reefs,
biodiversity, islands, and environmental education. (Retrieved: <http//www.ebbf.org>, [accessed:

Principle: Ecology and Economics in Symbiosis’.  Dahl’s specialty papers are:
Indicators and ethics of sustainability, environmental diplomacy and governance,
island environmental management.58 One of Dahl’s earlier works is ‘Evolving
Toward a Bahá’í Economic System’ in which he argues that ‘…our economic as
well as spiritual life will eventually be revolutionised.’59 Most economists restrict
their studies to an understanding that economics is a technical science. However,
Dahl demonstrates that this pattern of thinking is beginning to change. This
research has benefited greatly from Dahl’s views on sustainable development,
consumerism, climate change, consumer citizenship and a sustainable life style.

Shappour Rassekh, another prominent Bahá’í scholar, contributed significantly to
the Bahá’í discourse. Rassekh is the former professor of sociology and economics
at the University of Tehran and the current advisor to UNESCO for
education. After receiving his education at the University of Tehran in Persian
literature, Rassekh obtained his doctoral degree in social sciences from the
University of Geneva. His research speciality includes: modernity, social justice,
government and social responsibility, and globalisation. Rassekh’s writings are
mainly in Persian and French language, and some are translated in to English
including ‘Perspectives on Literacy, and Contents of Education. His views and
arguments on topics, such as Persian culture, education for peace, unity, gender
equality, and modernisation have assisted a number of discussions in this
research.

The general investigation of Bahá’í literatures on the subject of economics
initiated as early as 1920s by a British Bahá’í scholar, John Ebenezer Esslemont
(1874-1925). He is the author of a well-known introductory book on the Bahá’í
faith, Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era. His views are mainly based on Bahá’í
primary writings, on topics such as extremes of wealth and poverty, public
finance, voluntary sharing, the concept of work, the ethics of wealth, employee-
employer relationship, and the law of inheritance. Two other Bahá’í authors, John
Ferraby (1914-1973), the author of All things Made New (1977), and John
Huddleston, the author of The Earth is But One Country (1976), and The Search
for a Just Society (1989), and Standing up for Humanity (2008), have included
materials on socio-politico-economic issues from a Bahá’í perspective.
Hooshmand Badee wrote the first major compilation on Bahá’í economics entitled
The True Foundation of All Economics (1991). Another introductory book written
by Badee is Spiritual Solution to Economic Problems (1993) in which direct and
indirect teachings of the Bahá’í faith are explained.

The written papers by Bahá’í scholars cover diverse and rather distinct subjects
related to social and political economy. A group of Bahá’í scholars including
Farzam Arbab, William Hatcher, Farhad Rassekh, Nader Saeidi, have looked at
Bahá’í economics from a more technical perspective and explored specific
teachings of the faith on issues related to free market economy and Marxism.
Another group including George Starcher and Lawrence Miller have looked at the
role of morality in business organisations and leadership. Others, including
Farzam Arbab, and Holly Hanson Vick have discussed the importance of Bahá’í
inspired social and economic development projects and the contribution of Bahá’í

communities towards rural development. Geeta Gandhi Kingdon and Mary Fish
have considered the themes of happiness and prosperity. John Huddleston and
Shahruz Mohtadi have concentrated on discussing the topic of economic justice.
The issue of globalisation has created vast interest and a number of Bahá’í
scholars have explored this subject including Stephen Lambden, Moojan Momen,
Zaid Lundberg, and Robert Stockman. This categorisation of written papers are
important in terms of being textual, historical, comparative, conceptual, as well as
critical. Also, attempt is made to use the views of Bahá’í scholars to discuss their
economic proposals and contributions to the on-going public debates on economy
in our modern society in general and within the Bahá’í community in particular.

The views of a number of notable and prominent non-Bahá’í economists, experts
in development, and philosophers are incorporated in this research, either for
supporting a particular Bahá’í view or as a critic for further analysis. These
contributions have added significantly to the quality of discussion in this research.
One well-known school of thought, which is widely regarded as the first modern
school of economics is the classical economics. The Wealth of Nations written in
1776 by Adam Smith is considered to mark the beginning of classical school of
economics. Adam Smith’s in his original work ‘A theory of moral sentiment’
(1857) in which he established morality as the foundation of his economic views.
This aspect of Smith’s interpretation of economics is closely linked with Bahá’í
understanding of principles of spiritual economics. However, it is The Wealth of
Nations, which is the basis of today’s free market economy. Smith’s views on
self-interest, competition, consumerism, supply and demand, moral self-
regulation, and the role of government, for example, are referred to in discussing

the Bahá’í interpretation on similar topics. Karl Marx is another pillar of classical
economics. Bahá’u’lláh (1817-1892) and Marx (1818-1883) lived in the same
period. Although a comparison between the two is not appropriate, however, an
overall comparison is possible on issues such as the importance of ‘work’,
‘labour and capital relationship’ and the concept of ‘wealth creation’. Also, issues
discussed by Marx and Smith such as self-interest and profit-sharing and labour
productivity would be relevant to this research.

The scholarly papers and published books of a number of contemporary
economists and philosophers are also relevant to this research. John Galbraith’s
view on corporate greed and the dangers of deregulated markets have some
relevance to Bahá’í views and hence would benefit this research. A notable
contemporary economist is Amartya Sen, a Professor of Economics at Harvard
University, whose views on ‘justice’ and ‘empowering women’ and issues related
to a meaningful ‘globalization’ is significant for this research. In his book, the
idea of justice, Sen has written extensively about Justice and fairness. John
Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was a British economist and one of the most
influential of the 20th century. Keynes’ best-known work, The General Theory of
Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936, and became a
benchmark for future macroeconomic thought. Keynes’s view to reform the
global monetary system including creating a new reserve system based on a new
international currency will have some relevance to Bahá’í perspective on
globalisation and international fair trade. Two other experts who have written
extensively on subjects such as economic development, issues on poverty, and
globalisation are Joseph Stiglitz, the author of Freefall and Making globalisation

Work; and Michael Todaro, the author of Economic Development. The views of
these writers are in line with a number of Bahá’í scholars such as Farzam Arbab,
Shapour Rassekh, Arthur Dahl, and Farhad Rassekh. Another expert in subjects
such as poverty and development is Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh, and author
of Creating a World Without Poverty (2007). He is a social entrepreneur, banker,
economist and civil society leader and the founder of Grameen Bank and
pioneering the concepts of ‘microcredit and microfinance.’60 Yunus’s views on
development can be of great benefits to those Bahá’ís working in community
development or operating social and economic development projects in rural
areas.

The Bahá’í faith (‫ )ﺁآﺋﻴﯿﻦ ﺑﻬﮭﺎﺋﯽ‬is ‘a new religion, entirely independent.’ 61 It is beyond
the scope of this research to fully discuss the history of the Bahá’í faith. 62
However, a brief introduction is necessary as a background for this research. The
Bahá’í faith revolves around three central figures, the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The first of whom was a youth, a native of Shíráz, named Mírzá

He was born in 20 July 1819, and 23 May 1844, at the age of 25, advanced the
claim of being the herald who according to the sacred scriptures of previous
dispensations, must needs announce and prepare the way for the advent of one
greater than himself, whose mission would be, according to those same scriptures,
to inaugurate an era of righteousness and peace, an era that would be hailed as the
consummation of all previous dispensations, and initiate a new cycle in the
religious history of mankind. Swift and severe persecution, launched by the
organised forces of ecclesiastical and state in his native land led to his execution,
in July 1850, by a firing squad in the public square of Tabríz (‫ )ﺗﺒﺮﻳﯾﺰ‬in Persia.64

The founder of the Bahá’í faith, Mirza Husayn-‘Alí-i-Núrí (‫) ﻣﻴﯿﺮﺯزﺍا ﺣﺴﻴﯿﻦ ﻋﻠﯽ ﻧﻮﺭرﯼی‬
known as Bahá’u’lláh (‫)ﺑﻬﮭﺎءﷲ‬, meaning the ‘Glory of God’ 65 is regarded by
Bahá’ís as the most recent in the line of messengers of God. The word Bahá'í is
derived from Arabic, it is the name of the religion and refers to followers of
Bahá’u’lláh. Bahá’u’lláh was born in Persia (Iran) on 12 November 1817. He was
the son of a government minister in the court of the Shah. He grew up in an
affluent and comfortable household, and was expected to take on the
responsibilities of his father as a minister after he passed away. This position he
declined. Since the inception of the faith in 1844, following the declaration by his
forerunner, the Báb, and having accepted him as the promised one of Islam,
Bahá’u’lláh took it upon himself to support the Báb’s followers. This led to him

being caught in a whirlpool of persecutions, which were being inflicted on the
Báb’s followers by clerics and government officials. He was put in the Tehran
dungeon in 1853 in chains. After a few months he was released from the dungeon
in a very poor state of physical health, having been banished to Baghdad under the
Ottoman Empire at the time. Along with his family and many of his followers he
was repeatedly banished within the Ottoman Empire, until finally he was sent to
the prison city of Acre where he remained until his passing on 29 May 1892. He is
buried in Bahji (‫ )ﺑﻬﮭﺠﯽ‬in Acre and his shrine is considered the most sacred place
of pilgrimage for Bahá’ís around the world.

The economic structure of Iran during the Qajár (‫ )ﻗﺎﺟﺎﺭر‬period (1785-1925), when
Bahá’u’lláh declared his mission was in widespread deterioration. The socio-
economic condition of Iran during this period illustrated the key features of a
failing economy and was disintegrated under the stress of political anarchy.
Several decades of external invasions, internal strife, and endemic lawlessness had
brought widespread decay and decline to this country. According to historian
Charles Issawi in terms of the basic economic structure ‘Persia depicted the key
features of a backward economy.’ 66 Also, historian Ervand Abrahamian
highlighted three sets of issues as factors that contributed to the economic
backwardness and disruption of economic life of people during Qajár period:

> First the absence of an administrative elite or tradition that

> development; second ‘the strains that were placed on the

> and finally, the under realization of the agricultural

> potential that emanated from the survival of pastoral
> nomadism over large parts of the country.67

It was during the early part of the 19th century that ‘…commercial activity and
relative economic prosperity returned to Iran.’68

Abrahamian was the first to examine the appalling social and economic condition
of Iran during Qajár period. For example, in regard to the balance of trade,
Abrahamian cites some interesting evidence for the period 1830-1880. The figures
he provides demonstrate a large deficit in Iran. In the analysis of socio-economic
condition of Iran during the period 1800-1850, Momen refers to social unrest in
Iran as a main cause of economic decline. Quoting Abrahamian’s viewpoints
Momen writes:

> Such massive and continuing deficits meant, in practical

Consequently, Iran was virtually bankrupt and its central government was weak.
The acute socio-economic-political condition of Iran and the rest of the world
during the period of Qajár can be perceived from the Bahá’í writings. Bahá’u’lláh
states, ‘The winds of despair are, alas, blowing from every direction, and the strife

that divideth and afflicteth the human race is daily increasing.’70 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said, ‘Today no state in the world is in a condition of peace or tranquillity, for
security and trust have vanished from among the people. Both the governed and
the governors are alike in danger.’71 Shoghi Effendi also describes the condition
of the world as ‘…spiritually destitute, morally bankrupt, politically disrupted,
socially convulsed, economically paralyzed.’72

Bahá’u’lláh in his Book of the Covenant (‫ ﮐﺘﺎﺏب ﻋﻬﮭﺪ‬- Kitáb-i-ahd) appointed his
oldest son, ‘Abbás Effendi (‫ )ﻋﺒﺎﺱس ﺍاﻓﻨﺪﯼی‬known as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, meaning ‘servant
of Bahá 73 ’ as head of the Bahá’í faith after his own passing and the only
authorised interpreter of his writings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was born in Persia on 23 May
1844 and passed away 28 November 1921 in Palestine, now Israel.

In 1911-1913, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá travelled to Europe and North America. During these
travels he proclaimed Bahá’u’lláh’s message of social justice and unity and world
peace to church congregations, the members of trade unions, peace organisations,
university faculties, journalists, government officials, and many public audiences.
The public addresses (‫ )ﺧﻄﺎﺑﺎﺕت‬of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in North America are compiled
under the title The Promulgation of Universal Peace, Talks delivered by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá During His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912. Talks in Europe
are published in Paris Talks. His journey to Europe included two visits to London,
Paris, and Stuttgart, and briefer visits to other European centres. On April 11,

1912, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived in New York City. According to Bahá’í scholar and
historian Douglas Martin and William Hatcher, ‘During this North American tour
he visited some forty cities and towns in the United States. Among these was
Chicago, where he laid the cornerstone of the building that was to become the
Mother Temple of the West.’74 The effects of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to the West
were far-reaching. Confirming the importance of this visit Hatcher and Martin
write: ‘Western believers were directly exposed to the leader and acknowledged
exponent of their faith. They flocked to meet him, sought his advice, and were
able to clarify and deepen their understanding of the faith’s teachings on
technological, social, and moral issues.’75

It is generally agreed by the Bahá’í historians that at the end of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
tour to the West, Bahá’u’lláh’s social message had been publicly proclaimed and
a new generation of Bahá’ís from every strata of Western society had been
enlisted. Almost a century later, the Talks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá delivered in the West
still have important contributions to make to our current thinking. He provides
strategies that enable people to work together in unity for establishment of a fairer
society. This includes elimination of all kinds of prejudices such as religious,
racial, gender, nationality and economic. His view is that by creating a world free
of prejudices, people will show their full potential. He promoted the essentials of
the Bahá’í faith founded by his father, Bahá’u’lláh. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá observed
excessive materialism in the West and emphasised that there is a need for material
and spiritual coherence.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in his Will and Testament (‫ ﺍاﻟﻮﺍاﺡح ﻭوﺻﺎﻳﯾﺎ‬- Alváh-i-Vasáyá) appointed
his grandson, Shoghi Effendi as the Guardian of the Bahá’í community and the
interpreter of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh. Shoghi Effendi was then only 25 years
old and still a student at Oxford University. Shoghi Effendi was born in Akka
(‫ )ﻋﮑﺎ‬on 1 March 1897 and passed away in London – England on 4 November
1957\. His ministry from 1921 to 1957 was filled with carrying on his weighty
responsibilities as the leader of the Bahá’í community and an interpreter.

In his Will and Testament, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá outlined the nature of two principal
institutions namely the ‘Guardianship’ which refers to Shoghi Effendi (‫)ﺷﻮﻗﯽ ﺍاﻓﻨﺪﯼی‬,
and the ‘Universal House of Justice’ ( ‫ )ﺑﻴﯿﺖ ﺍاﻟﻌﺪﻝل ﺍاﻋﻈﻢ‬envisioned by Bahá’u’lláh for
the conduct of the affairs of the Bahá’í community. Expounding the functions and
responsibilities of these institutions Hatcher and Martin write:

1\.8       An account of the contents of the following chapters
The title of chapter 2 is ‘sustainable production’. This is the first key chapter of

\[76\] Hatcher and Martin. The Bahá’í Faith, p. 59.

this dissertation. The Bahá’í writings on the importance of ‘work’ and ‘sustainable
production’ are researched, examined, and their application to the Bahá’í
community and the wider society is demonstrated. The chapter explores selected
Bahá’í principles in relation to work ethics and how they influence increasing the
supply of the workforce in the labour market.

Chapter 3 is about the Bahá’í perspective on distributive justice. Economic justice
and fairness is an important part of modern economics and a key concept in the
Bahá’í literatures. Issues related to extremes of wealth and poverty and the
justification of principles of equity and equality have been raised and discussed in
this chapter. A key feature of this chapter is exploring the relationship between
distributive justice and human well-being. This chapter identifies and discusses a
number of Bahá’í principles that lead to a prosperous society. The role of
government is also considered as crucial in administering distributive justice. In
addition, this chapter explores the meaning and significance of wealth from a
Bahá’í perspective.

Chapter 4 discusses sustainable consumption. Consumption will be considered as
the main reason for production and distribution. With the increasing level of
world population, this chapter argues that the relationship between consumption
and sustainability is becoming complex and critical. Studying Bahá’í and non-
Bahá’í literatures, this chapter further argues that consumption consists of
normative choices and is hence a matter of value judgement. Consequently, the
chapter maintains that value principles such as fairness, caring, and compassion
would play an important part in an integrated market. This chapter discusses and

examines a number of Bahá’í teachings that promote sustainable consumption. A
key concept in this chapter is those elements and value principles that influence
consumers in making their final choices. The main task of this chapter, therefore,
is to explore the Bahá’í understanding of sustainable consumption and to examine
selected Bahá’í principles that can be applied to the Bahá’í lifestyle and perhaps
acts as a model for study in the wider society.

Chapter 5 explores Bahá’í teachings on globalisation. With the previous three
chapters focusing mainly on the Bahá’í perspective on microeconomics, this
chapter focuses on Bahá’í views on macroeconomics. The subject of globalisation
has expanded considerably over the last two centuries and it now covers a wide
range of topics. It will be argued that problems associated with the current form of
globalisation are due to the negative methods and processes adopted. Hence, this
chapter argues that the current process of globalisation is not in agreement with
Bahá’í writings.    The key discussion in this chapter is on selected Bahá’í
principles that lead to meaningful globalization, including those principles that
create a fairer international trade and help the creation of an ideal global society.
In addition, this chapter discusses the costs and benefits of globalisation. It will be
argued that government policies alone are not sufficient, and there is a need for
emerging values to shape and reform the process of the current globalisation.

Chapter 6 is the Bahá’í perspective on development in both theory and practice.
This became possible by undertaking a field trip to the city of Rajshahi in
Bangladesh and observing a Bahá’í inspired social and economic development
project. The notion of development is closely associated with globalisation. There

will be a discussion on the distinctiveness of the Bahá’í approach to development,
as a positive process towards globalisation. The experience of the author of this
research in establishing a social and economic development project in Bangladesh
will be a part of this chapter. The characteristics of Bahá’í view towards economic
development will be considered, with reference to this project.

Chapter 7 introduces a Bahá’í-inspired model of economic sustainability that
would be instrumental in establishing a balanced economy when considering the
Bahá’í teachings discussed in the previous four chapters. The main aim of this
theoretical model is to identify market imbalances and provide an alternative
method of reducing such imbalances. The proposed solution is to influence the
actions of the participants so that the market can function in a sustainable manner.

Chapter 2: Sustainable production

> O people of Bahá! It is incumbent upon each one of you to

> like. We have exalted your engagement in such work to
the rank of worship of the one true God.1

Bahá’u’lláh

2\.1    Introduction
Engagement in ‘Work’ is a fundamental part of human life and is the subject of
comment in the academy of economics, as well as an important Bahá’í teaching
and greatly emphasised in the Bahá’í literatures. For a Bahá’í, ‘work’ done in a
spirit of service is considered as worship. The Bahá’í writings recognise the
essential need for cooperation and interdependence between human beings and
engaging in some kind of work is a means for achieving it. One of the key
features of Bahá’í teachings on economics is the keen interest shown to one’s
productive contribution to society in a sustainable manner. The concept of Bahá’í
work ethics includes obtaining social skills to become reliable and resourceful in
the work setting. The purpose of this chapter is to explore selected Bahá’í
teachings in relation to work ethics and how they support and influence increasing
the supply of the workforce in the labour market. Hence, this chapter addresses
the research question of how the principles of Bahá’í work ethics influence
adherents of this community to become productive members of society and
develop a sustainable lifestyle.

the writings of Bahá’u’lláh only, and the term ‘note’ is referred to clarification of certain verses
which could be from other sources such as from the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi or
the Universal House of Justice.)

2\.2    The historical perspective of work ethics
Although the subject of ‘work ethics’, and in particular the aspect of ‘work as
worship’, is a distinctive principle in Bahá’í literature, the concept has been
expressed by others and stated in various faiths’ scriptures. However, the
emphasis of this research is on the Bahá’í literatures and related scholarly
materials.

From a historical perspective, according to specialised in technology education
Roger Hill:

> …work, for much of the ancient history of the human
> race, has been hard and degrading. The cultural norm
> placing a positive moral value on doing a good job
> because work has intrinsic value for its own sake, is a
> relatively recent development.2

Hill then refers to the significant role of the Protestant in accepting physical
labour and writes: ‘It was not until the Protestant Reformation that physical labour
became culturally acceptable for all persons, even the wealthy.’3 Attitudes towards
work during the classical period were degrading too. According to Michael Rose:

> The cultural norms allowed free men to pursue warfare,
> large-scale commerce, and the arts, especially architecture.
> Skilled crafts were accepted and recognized as having
> some social value, but were not regarded as an appropriate
> work for slaves. Manual labour was for slaves.4

For the Romans, work was to be done by slaves and, according to Maywood ‘…
only two occupations were suitable for a free man - agriculture and big business.

A goal of these endeavours was to achieve an honourable retirement into rural
peace as a country gentleman.’ 5 Attitudes toward work during the Medieval
Period began with the fall of the Roman Empire. During this time, Christian
thought dominated the culture of Europe. The attitudes toward work during
Protestantism, which became a part of the culture during the sixteenth century,
and the economic value system which they nurtured, represented a significant
change from medieval and classical ways of thinking about work.

Two key religious leaders who influenced the development of western culture and
Protestant reformation during the end of Medieval Period were Martin Luther
(1483 –1546) and John Calvin (1509 –1564). Luther believed that people could
serve God through their work, that the professions were useful, that work was the
universal base of society and the cause of differing social classes. 6 Luther
regarded the monastic and contemplative life, held up as the ideal during the
Middle Ages, as an egotistic and unaffectionate exercise on the part of the monks,
and he accused them of evading their duty to their neighbours.7 Calvin taught that
all men must work, even the rich, because to work was the will of God. The belief
was that each person should earn an income that would meet his basic needs, but
to accumulate wealth was sinful. The Protestant ethic, which gave moral consent
to profit making through hard work and organization spread throughout Europe
and to America through Protestants. This brought the rise of capitalism. In the

emerging capitalist system, according to Hill, work was good. Work satisfied the
economic interests of an increasing number of small businessmen and it became a
social duty and a norm.

In a discussion about changing attitudes toward work, Maywood refers to the
‘Protestant work ethic’ as the view that humans have a moral duty to work
diligently, regardless of their station in life, and that by doing so they can reap
societal regard and the personal reward of knowing that a job has been well done.8
This Protestant work ethic has, according to Maywood, reformed the traditional
approach of work. Max Weber in his The Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of
Capitalism, written in 1904-05, first coined the term ‘Protestant Ethic’. The
common notion between the Weber and the Bahá’í view is to reconceptualise the
worldly work as a duty that benefits both the individual and the wider society.
Therefore, the Bahá’í and Protestant idea of ‘work’ is elevated from purely
monetary value to manifest signs of morality and spirituality.

As discussed in chapter 1, two of the most famous economists in the classical
economy were Adam Smith, with his free market economy, and Karl Marx, with
the notion of socialism. Capitalism came under attack by Karl Marx. Marx
believed that under the Capitalist economic system, workers were dehumanized
and exploited. He claimed that the new industrial system required workers who
would accept long hours and poor working conditions. He believed that as people
laboured for long hours every day, they became alienated. Marx distinguishes one

\[8\] Maywood A. G. Journal of Vocational Education and the Work Ethic in a Changing Workplace,
class from another on the basis of two criteria: ownership of the means of
production, and control of the labour power, thereby believing that society has
two distinct classes: I) Capitalists, or bourgeoisie, who own the means of
production and purchase the labor power of others; and II) Workers, who do not
own any means of production. Hence, for Marx there is a conflict between labour
and capital. 9

The Bahá’í view is that labour and capital are not in conflict, rather they
complement each other. For example, in the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá it is stated
that capitalists may earn much more than labourers, thus recommending
progressive taxation as a method to moderate the inequality (chapter 3, section
3\.7.4). Moreover, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appeals to the self-interest of the capitalists and
suggests profit sharing (chapter 3, section 3.7.3) as a method of enhancing labour
productivity. It will be to the advantage of capitalists to share their profit because
workers would exert more effort. Hence, workers become partners in an industry,
and apart from a wage, they receive a portion of the profit. These methods
eliminate the concept of alienation expressed by Marx. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, ‘If it
be right for a capitalist to possess a large fortune, it is equally just that his
workman should have a sufficient means of existence.’10 In addition, the Bahá’í
work ethics support the economic view that a skill, such as acquisition of useful
arts, sciences and commerce, are essential for improving performance and hence
receiving pay according to performance. ‘Wage differentials’ and ‘pay according

Galbraith, A History of Economics: The Past as the Present, London, Penguin Books, 1989, pp.

to performance’ and ‘piece work’ are the requirements for wealth creation and are
features of free market economy or democratic capitalism. Thus, Bahá’í
economics of the future includes the advantages of both systems and excludes
their disadvantages. There are indications for favouring a free market economy
but with certain conditions. For example, in the following passage, in 1936,
Shoghi Effendi wrote that the current form of free market economy need to be ‘…
controlled, regulated, and even restricted.’11 But, is there a realistic and practical
alternative to the current free market economy? The answer, according to
academic economist Richard Lipsey, is both yes and no:

> No, because the modern economy has no practical
> alternative to reliance on market determination for most of
> its functions; but yes because a market economy cannot
> deliver all the outcome we generally desire without some
> role for interventions by government.12

Though the ideas of Marx do not seem applicable to modern day situations,
looking back at Marx’s lifetime, one realises that the conditions differed greatly
from those of present time. As Colin Leys has argued, the change of conditions
began long before. Leys writes:

> In 1870s two things had already happened to alter Marx’s
> vision. First, the working class in Western Europe was
> increasingly becoming organist in parliamentary political
> parties and gradually became reformist, not transformist;
> and second, capitalism had become a worldwide
> phenomenon affecting many countries in which the
> working class was still a small minority.13

Moreover, today, the labour market as a part of the free market economy has been

regulated and changed significantly in favour of workers compared to the time of
Marx. For example, many governments have passed several laws to protect the
rights of workers. Also, one of the major responsibilities of trade unions is to take
care of their members, including wage negotiation, providing good working
conditions, and offering health and safety and training programs. Likewise,
owners and managers of companies demonstrate greater interest in improving the
working conditions to motivate the workforce. Although, the reasons are probably
profit driven. The realisation is that such improvements increase labour
productivity and thus result in greater returns for the organisation. Therefore, it
can be argued that a combination of factors, including the effective role of
government and information and technology, have led to a significant
transformation in the meaning of the work ethic. Jobs provided opportunities for
greater self-expression by workers and people began to find more self-fulfilment
in their work.

2\.3    Sustainable production
Production plays a major role in all aspects of economic activities. For the
purpose of this discussion, a working definition for sustainable production is
developed as follows: production is the act of effective utilisation of tangible and
intangible resources, through an efficient conversion process, to produce those
goods and services that are befitting human nobility,14 protecting the environment
and respecting future generations. This definition is in line with Bahá’í
understanding of sustainable production. Although the phrase ‘sustainable

\[14\] Bahá’u’lláh said, ‘Noble have I created thee…’ (Bahá’u’lláh, Arabic Hidden Words, no. 22) the
word noble in the Bahá’í literatures denotes the quality of being noble in character such as
honesty, trustworthiness, truthfulness and more.

production’ does not appear in the primary Bahá’í writings, the requirements for
producing commodities that are sustainable are mentioned. The first part of the
above working definition, which is the act of effective utilisation of tangible
resources, is supported by economic theory; and the second part by the Bahá’í
writings. The economic theory (by both classical and new-classical)15 considers
land, labour and capital as ‘tangible’ resources. Moral incentives, as ‘intangible’
resources are desirable to add value to an organisation. Both tangible and
intangible factors are recommended for increasing production in a sustainable
way.

To increase the level of production in a sustainable way, there is a need for skilled
workers and advanced technology, both of which are endorsed in the Bahá’í
writings. The progress of advanced technology, however, changes the kinds of
skills needed, and would not stop people from acquiring knowledge and skills.
Shoghi Effendi’s view is that, ‘…the progress of machinery has not made effort
unnecessary. It has given it a new form, a new outlet.’16 The decision as to what
kind of technology should be used is often a difficult one, particularly in
developing countries. It involves careful consideration of cost estimates for all the
inputs for each possible technology. In many instances the modern technology is
not the cheapest. New technologies usually require attention to human capital as
well, for example, people may need training or retraining, and the size of the
workforce may have to be reduced as the skilled labour force becomes more

\[15\] For an in depth discussion of classical and new-classical model of economics see: Begg, Fischer
and Dornbusch. Economics, pp. 554-559.

\[16\] Shoghi Effendi. ‘Letter dated 26 December 1935,’ quoted in True Foundation of All Economics,
efficient, or technology replace with labour. Hence, both skilled workers and
advanced technology may cause redundancies, both of which are issues in the
stage of production of Bahá’í-inspired model in chapter 7. Consideration must
also be given to ensuring that the costs of these new technologies do not outweigh
their benefits. A practical and sensible recommendation is that advanced
technology and training of the workforce should go hand in hand.

Furthermore, the economic view expressed in the Bahá’í writings indicates that
skills such as useful arts and sciences and commerce, are necessities for
sustainable production and wealth creation. Useful arts are concerned with skills
such as manufacturing and craftsmanship. Economic theories assume that skilled
workers with high demand earn more than unskilled workers. There are several
reasons for this view. Principally, this is because the demand for skilled workers
is higher, and in some occupations, supply of skilled workers is limited. Another
reason is that the marginal revenue and marginal physical product of skilled
labour is high, because the skills possessed by the workers will lead to higher
revenue.17 Also, the supply of skilled labour in many developing countries is
below that of unskilled workers. In some highly specialised occupations, it is
difficult to substitute skilled labour with machines. Such attitudes towards skill
learning increase the wealth of a nation. This accords with the guidance of the
head of the Bahá’í faith the Universal House of Justice, which said, ‘The Bahá’í
community will need men and women of many skills and qualifications; for, as it
grows in size the sphere of its activities in the life of society will increase and

\[17\] Marginal Revenue is the increase in total revenue when output increases by one unit. Labour is
more demanded when they are able to increase productivity and hence increasing sales. See: Begg,
Fischer and Dornbusch. pp. 109-110.

diversify.’18

Notably, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá relates the effect of work and the acquisition of useful
arts, and sciences, to the multiplying of a nation’s wealth. He said,

> The acquisition of useful arts and of general knowledge, to
> inform [themselves] as to the truths of such physical
> sciences as are beneficial to man, and to widen the scope
> of industry and increase the products of commerce and
> multiply the nation’s avenues of wealth.19

For example, an increase in investment in useful arts and sciences and skills
learning, have led to creating specialisation, which in turn has a great effect on the
national income of a country. Specialisation allows a person to become skilled
and more efficient at a specific task, hence producing more, with better quality
and less wastage. To achieve this level of specialisation, the Bahá’í writings
suggest training and skill learning and a fair pay system, such as the principle of
profit sharing. However, the drawback of becoming specialised in a certain
occupation is that it may become monotonous for some individuals. It may also
mean that the specialised person would end up with limited skills in other things,
reducing his or her ability to find other jobs if they wished to. Therefore, in some
cases    specialisation     may      reduce     efficiency     and    demotivate       workers.
Consequently, the extent to which specialisation motivate workers, or add
meaning to life, varies in different people.

2\.4   Bahá’í work ethics
The term ‘work ethic’ refers to the beliefs, values, and principles that guide the
way individuals understand, value, and perform their jobs well. Gene Laczniak
defines ethics as ‘moral rules or principles of behavior that should guide the
members of a profession or organisation and make them deal honestly and fairly
with each other and with their customers.’20 The distinctiveness of ‘Bahá’í work
ethics’ is that, work done in a spirit of service is elevated to the rank of worship.
Hence, the expression ‘work as worship’ is a key concept for discussing the
Bahá’í perspective on work and work ethics. The challenge, as Torrington, Hall,
and Taylor argue, is that ‘ethical standards vary between different national
cultures, making international standards difficult.’21 They further write, ‘Ethical
codes are only valid if they are appreciated and willingly implemented by the
great majority of those to whom they apply.’22 To make this view effective, work
ethics should become a culture in an organisation and perhaps in the wider
society.

From an economic perspective, work is central and a key principle. Through
work, individuals carry out their responsibilities, maintain their livelihoods, and
enhance their quality of life. Without work, and hence in the absence of monetary
reward, production, distribution and consumption cannot be sustained. From a
Bahá’í perspective, work is conducive to human upliftment and exaltation. Also,
work is important for individual identity and self-fulfilment, and as a service for

community development. Bahá’u’lláh affirmed ‘work is worship’( ‫– ﮐﺎﺭر ﻋﺒﺎﺩدﺕت ﺍاﺳﺖ‬
Kár 'ibádat ast). He also said: ‘It is incumbent upon each one of you to engage in
some occupation, such as a craft, a trade or the like. We have exalted your
engagement in such work to the rank of worship of the one true God.’23 Hence, the
emphasis is not only placed on the monetary aspect of work but also on its effect
on one’s spiritual development, which would otherwise be achieved through
worship.

Despite great emphasis on the principle of work as worship, the concept of work
as spiritual practice could be disputed. The concept of spirituality is difficult to
grasp in the context of a discussion on ‘work’, because of its abstract nature. It is
difficult to measure spirituality, as people have to think beyond monetary gain. It
can be argued that work and worship are totally different from each other.
Worship is in the spiritual realm, it is an act of meditation and aims to receive the
blessings of God. For many it is done in private, in a temple or a shrine. However,
work is what is done in the fields, in a factory, in a hospital, in school, or in an
office. The purpose of work for many is to earn a living and produce a certain
amount of output, both of which have a monetary value and can be measured.

In modern working practices, the nature of work has shifted from a purely
monetary concept to achieving higher values. People do not necessarily work only
to satisfy their material needs, but for other reasons, such as identity, feeling they
are doing something of value or making a contribution. The modern theories of
motivation in the work place developed by clinical psychologists, Abraham

\[23\] Bahá’u’lláh. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, verse 33.

Maslow’s24 ‘hierarchy of needs’, and Fredrick Herzberg’s ‘two factor theory’25
supports the Bahá’í view that higher values of work is as a motivational factor.
For example, Abraham Maslow in his paper of the ‘theory of human needs’, or
the ‘hierarchy of needs’, considers social factors (including love and belonging),
esteem and self-actualization as necessary requirements for a worker’s
motivation, although, the lower nature of ‘work’, such as physiological and safety
aspects are not overlooked.26 In parallel to Maslow, Herzberg’s two-factor theory
of motivation states that there are certain factors in the workplace that cause
motivation, while a separate set of factors cause dissatisfaction and they act
independently of each other. According to Herzberg, individuals are not content
with the satisfaction of lower-order needs at work. Rather, individuals look for the
gratification    of    higher-level     needs        such   as   achievement,      recognition,
responsibility, and advancement. 27 Others such as Elton Mayo (1880-1949)
stressed the principles of ‘team working and consultation’ 28 as a method for
motivating the workforce and increasing the level of output, and both of these
principles are indicated and supported in the Bahá’í literatures.

Consequently, as modern theories suggest, some people work for reasons such as
excelling in their skills, talents and potential, or following their passions and
achieving status. The Bahá’í work ethics advocate that work may become a path
to spiritual development. For example, by referring to the purpose of work,

Shoghi Effendi said, work ‘… has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a value in
itself, because it draws us nearer to God, and enables us to better grasp his
purpose for us in this world.’29 The practical implication of ‘work as worship’ is
that through fulfilling natural duties in life honestly and to the best of one’s
ability, a person will progress spiritually, because work puts a person in a position
to serve others. It can be argued that some people’s labour is exploited and that
many do not have the opportunities or motivation to work. One way in which
work helps change behaviours is that through interactions with others, one
becomes aware of their needs, is less focussed on ‘self’, and more focussed on
helping others, thereby changing behaviour. Hence, work becomes significant
when it provides service to others. Service and worship become parts of the same
entity. Thus, the concept of ‘work as worship’ suggests that, for a Bahá’í, work or
occupation is part of a person’s religious duty and spiritual growth, a way of life,
and fulfilment of responsibilities. Consequently, the central figures of the Bahá’í
faith also state the type of occupations that would be elevated to the rank of
worship. These include craft, agriculture, useful arts and sciences, commerce, and
skills learning. The basic principle, however, is that work should be done in a
spirit of service, although it may lead to material gain and wealth creation.

But, is wealth creation unethical? The Bahá’í work ethics do not condemn wealth
creation. In one of his writings Bahá’u’lláh states: ‘Having attained the stage of
fulfilment and reached his maturity, man standeth in need of wealth, and such
wealth as he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and

\[29\] Shoghi Effendi. Cited in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, note 56.

praiseworthy.’30 This statement has important economic and moral implications.
Bahá’u’lláh does not declare wealth as immoral; he rather accepts the need for it
when a person reaches the stage of maturity. But, what is a stage of maturity? It
can be viewed as when an individual has developed intellectually and spiritually
to a point when he or she is able to take on responsibility for himself or herself
and others, so that the wealth acquired through engaging in some sort of crafts or
profession can be spent sensibly and responsibly. This, however is open to
interpretation. There are a number of criteria for fulfilling such a claim. In other
words, the level of maturity influences a person to spend the wealth on those
goods and services that are befitting human dignity. This would then inspire
producers to produce those products that are demanded by responsible consumers.

The pursuit of a profession is encouraged in the Bahá’í writings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said, ‘Strive as much as possible to become proficient in the science of agriculture
for in accordance with the Divine Teachings, the acquisition of science and the
perfection of arts is considered as acts of worship.’31 The pursuit of professions
such as agriculture, arts, sciences and technology, as well as in the fields of
education, health and social services, are all relevant examples of ‘work is
worship’. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá further states: ‘If a man engages with all his power in the
acquisition of a science or in the perfection of an art, it is as if he has been
worshipping God in the churches and temples.’32 The word ‘perfection’ in this

passage suggests the modern working concept of ‘quality assurance.’33 Lawrence
Miller further elaborates on this subject by emphasising the importance of the
right ‘attitude’ to work:

> The word ‘if’ is very important when discussing ‘work is
> worship’. It does not say that if a person simply shows up
> at work and puts in his time, it is as if he were worshiping
> God. It is only if he is ‘engaged with all his power’ and is
> seeking perfection in that work … both mind and spirit
> must be exercised at work and only then, ‘when engaged
> with all his power’, is it an act of worship.34

Therefore, work is worship when attaining a sense of creativity and self-worth
from a meaningful work. This requires a change in the workers’ attitude towards
work, and how the workplace is designed to motivate workers. The workplace, as
suggested by Herzberg and his hygiene factors, has a profound impact on the
spiritual well-being of human resources, including workers and management. In
such an environment, individuals feel a sense of fulfilment and self-esteem,
resulting in improving performance and increasing output.

As mentioned earlier, in order to perform one’s job with excellence, one needs to
be skilled and trained in what he or she is doing. The need for education and
training for attainment of excellence is therefore closely linked with work ethics
and essential for improving individual and organisational performance. In regard
to education and training of children ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said:

> The education and training of children is among the most
> meritorious acts of humankind and draweth down the
> grace and favour of the All-Merciful, for education is the
> indispensable foundation of all human excellence and

\[33\] ‘Quality assurance’ is the notion of increasing efficiency, waste reduction and improving
productivity, all of which would benefit an organisation to perform better.

\[34\] Miller. Spiritual Enterprise, p. 152.

> alloweth man to work his way to the heights of abiding
> glory.35

In modern times, working conditions are changing all the time and continued
professional development and skill learning are necessary to adapt to such
changes, and maintain excellence. Customer trends, the market, and technology
are changing so rapidly that unless employers take steps to constantly update
knowledge, skills and technology, workers will be less valuable to their current or
future employers. A number of countries that are able to develop the skills and
education of their people and to employ them effectively in their economy have
achieved great success in many aspects of development. As economist Tony
Thirlwall pointed out since 1960’s there has been a new industrial revolution by a
number of countries so called the ‘Newly Industrialised Countries’36 of South-East
Asia into a virtually industrialised state, and many others into a semi-
industrialised state.

Knowledge has a significant place in the Bahá’í writings and as a result the Bahá’í
community observes a culture of learning. It is stated that ‘Knowledge is as wings
to man’s life, and a ladder for his ascent.’37 Hence, a combination of mode of
learning, intellectual capability, and moral values influence a Bahá’í to choose the
right skills and the right line of work. The dynamics of knowledge, skill learning,
and excellence in all things equip an employee to work adequately and produce
goods and services that satisfy the customers appropriately. Making customers

delighted, according to Stanley Brown, is the key factor for total customer service
and it is a sign of success for organisations.38 Delighting customers, however
depends what commodities are demanded and if products match human dignity.

Another Bahá’í view closely linked with ‘work as worship’ is to attempt to
achieve perfection in one’s profession, which is closely related to skill learning
discussed earlier. Bahá’u’lláh said ‘Strain every nerve to acquire both inner and
outer perfections, for the fruit of the human tree hath ever been and will ever be
perfections both within and without.’39 The inner and outer perfection can be
interpreted as developing both spiritually and materially. The impression is that
work offers the opportunity for self-realisation and self-development, in addition
to the material benefits. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá exhorts Bahá’ís in ‘… attaining perfection
in one’s profession’40 He goes further to say ‘Thou must endeavour greatly so that
thou mayest become unique in thy profession and famous in those parts…’41 The
view of producing products at ‘highest perfection’ and other expressions such as
‘outer perfection’, ‘highest motives’          42

and ‘attaining perfection in one’s
profession’ 43 can be interpreted as resource efficiency and sustainability.
However, although qualities such as perfection and excellence are necessary
factors for improving performance and increasing level of output, they are not
sufficient. Commitment from the workforce is required to maintain a high level of
excellence in the process of manufacturing a product.

Another area closely related to the Bahá’í work ethics is that Bahá’ís are
encouraged to study the type of knowledge, and engage in a kind of occupation
that benefits the entire society. In several writings, the central figures of the
Bahá’í faith have encouraged Bahá’ís to engage in such professions that will
benefit all. For example, Bahá’u’lláh advises his followers to               ‘…occupy
yourselves with what will profit you and others.’44 He also said ‘Ye are the trees
of My garden; ye must give forth goodly and wondrous fruits, that ye yourselves
and others may profit therefrom.’45 He also said ‘The best of men are they that
earn a livelihood by their calling and spend upon themselves and upon their
kindred for the love of God.’ 46 Some important objectives of sustainable
production have been stated in the above passages including: productivity, earning
a livelihood, service to humanity, and sharing. These factors influence a Bahá’í to
acquire a kind of knowledge and profession that not only benefits his or her own
life but also benefits others. Many Bahá’ís have therefore studied those subjects,
and chosen a profession, that can be beneficial to their own development and at
the same time being of benefit to the wider community. This helps to achieve a
relative equilibrium in the labour market. This may also promote undertaking
skill-learning or studying the subjects that are in high demand in the market. Such
efforts help to satisfy workers’ needs as well as the needs of the market.

But what is the practical application of ‘work as worship’? The Bahá’í view is
that it is not possible to worship God without serving others. Prayers and

\[44\] Bahá’u’lláh. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, verse 33.

\[45\] Ibid., Hidden Words (from Persian translation), no. 80.

\[46\] Ibid., no. 82.

meditations need to be reflected in action in order to be effective. ‘Bahá’í House
of Worship’ (‫ – ﻣﺸﺮﻕق ﺍاﻻﺫذﮐﺎﺭر‬Mashriqu’l-Adhkár) is a classic example for the
application of two ethical principles of ‘worship’ and ‘service’. Mashriqu’l-
Adhkár is Arabic, meaning ‘the Dawning-Place of the Praise of God.’47 Referring
to the significance of the function of Bahá’í House of Worship, Shoghi Effendi
writes:

> Bahá’í worship, however exalted in its conception,
> however passionate in fervour … cannot afford lasting
> satisfaction and benefits to the worshipper himself, much
> less than to humanity in general, unless and until
> translated and transfused into that dynamic and
> disinterested service to the cause of humanity.48

Consequently, the purpose of the Bahá’í House of Worship is not simply an
outstanding building with a dome, with beautiful gardens around it where people
go to worship. It comprises those elements that satisfy the social needs of people,
through a number of dependencies dedicated to activities concerned with social,
humanitarian, educational, and scientific pursuits. The Houses of Worship
incorporates two fundamental principles to be included in every Bahá’í
community; namely worship and building capacity for service to humanity. In it’s
2012 ‘Ridván message’ 49 , the Universal House of Justice expound the two
important functions of ‘worship and service’ offered in the Bahá’í Houses of
Worship as ‘…an educational process that builds capacity for service to
humanity.’ 50 As the Bahá’í Houses of Worship are not yet built in every
community, Bahá’ís organise activities in homes, halls and community centres to

consult, learn, and practice the two principles of worship and service to humanity.

2\.5       Bahá’í teachings to increase supply of labour
The ability of an individual, or group of individuals, to become productive
members of society, is important for one’s own growth and also as a process for
community building and social development. Studying the Bahá’í writings, a
number of distinctive and interrelated teachings are found that are effective in
enabling such a process. The application of these teachings provides employment
opportunities and increases the supply of workforce in the labour market. There is
also a need to Identify labour market deficiencies, to ensure provision of training
and skills learning to fill the gaps, thereby optimising production. This subject is
further detailed in the following sections using principles of Bahá’í work ethics
and sustainable production.

2\.5.1      The Bahá’í view on idleness
Bahá’ís are encouraged to work, to be productive members of the society, earn a
livelihood, and to serve humanity. Thus, idleness is forbidden, whether it is due to
lack of skills, lack of incentives, or as a result of living from inherited wealth.
However, opportunity to work must be provided. The founder of the faith states,
‘Waste not your hours in idleness and sloth.’51 And his successor, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
places emphasis on the productive capacity of individuals and suggests that ‘all
must be producers.’52 Shoghi Effendi, in reference to a passage from the writings

\[51\] Bahá’u’lláh. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, verse 33.

\[52\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 217.

of Bahá’u’lláh 53 , firmly affirms that ‘Every individual, no matter how
handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation of engaging in some
work or profession’54 and referring, to those who have inherited wealth and see no
need to work he said ‘The inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune
from daily work.’55 These excerpts leave little excuse for any Bahá’í to avoid
working or being of service for the common good.

The idea that the poor have to do their utmost to be engaged in some kind of work
is supported by economic policies and has significant consequences in the life of
the poor, their families and the entire economy. At the individual level it causes
one to better understand the value and objective of life. It helps families to enjoy
higher standards of living, including better education, improved health and greater
happiness. Society can also benefit greatly by using resources more effectively.
For example, by lowering unemployment and increasing output, which leads to
economic growth and, ultimately, more revenue for government to use to improve
public services. The practicality of these idealistic views in Bahá’í writings and in
economic theories in a more sustainable social, economic and political
environment, need to be analysed. The labour market is very complex and
external shocks, such as a period of recession, bad weather conditions, war, and
political instability, greatly affect employment conditions. Hence, labour market
fluctuation exists all the time.

\[53\] See: Bahá’u’lláh, Gleaning from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 202. (He said: The poor may
exert themselves and strive to earn the means of livelihood. This is a duty, which, in this Most
Great Revelation, hath been prescribed unto every one, and is accounted in the sight of God as a
goodly deed. Whoso observeth this duty, the help of the invisible One shall most certainly aid
him.)

\[54\] Shoghi Effendi. Directives from the Guardian, p. 74.

\[55\] Ibid.

But, what constitutes idleness and productivity? It is important to consider what
we mean by idleness, and the productivity of what. This is the dilemma. For
example, people working in a weapons factory are still considered to be
‘productive’ and from an economics perspective, measured in terms of Gross
Domestic Product, add to the average standard of living. However, such activities
may not be ethical. Alternatively, one may argue that it is far better to be ‘idle’
and collect unemployment benefits from the public fund, than work in an arms
industry. Hence, there is much more in analysing the concept of ‘idleness’. For
example, what guarantee is there that jobs would be available for everyone? In the
free market economy it is not possible for all to be employed. During a period of
full employment, some form of unemployment is still unavoidable, such as those
people affected by structural, frictional, and seasonal unemployment. William
Phillips56, for example, shows that there exists a ‘natural rate of unemployment’
during a period of full employment. The idea is that a certain level of
unemployment helps balancing inflation and price stability. 57 The level of
unemployment varies in different countries and depends on a number of factors,
including the availability of natural resources to produce goods and services, the
existence of appropriate technology, capital investment, the level of education and
training in necessary skills, as well as a good standard of health.

What provisions are there for Bahá’ís to ensure there are sufficient earnings for

\[56\] William Phillips, wrote a paper in 1958 titled ‘The Relation between Unemployment and the
Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861-1957.’ In the paper Phillips
describes how he observed an inverse relationship between money wage changes and
unemployment in the British economy over the period examined. See: Krugman, International
Economics: Theory and Policy, pp. 235-237.

living? Bahá’u’lláh, in one of his writings, refers to one of the duties of ‘the
House of Justice’58 as ‘…have been charged with the affairs of the people.’59 In
relation to the word ‘affairs’ in this passage, Shoghi Effendi identifies a number
of provisions to be considered by Local Spiritual Assemblies, including ensuring
shelter for the poor and needy, encouraging and helping individuals in acquiring
sufficient skills, establishing schools for education and training, and ensuring the
provision of necessary academic equipment. He said:

> It is the duty of those who are in charge of the
> organisation of society to give every individual the
> opportunity of acquiring the necessary talent in some kind
> of profession, and also the means of utilising such a talent,
> both for its own sake and for the sake of earning the
> means of his livelihood.60

Providing opportunities for employment however, does not mean that
unemployment is unavoidable. Apart from skill learning, which was discussed
earlier, Assemblies are advised to ensure that children from disadvantaged
families are taken care of and receive academic education.61 However, although it
is most important for everyone to engage in some form of work and service, this
does not apply to those who do not have the physical or intellectual abilities to do
so. These individuals would be under the protection of the state or the Houses of
Justice, to ensure their needs are met, and their quality of life is preserved in the
best possible way.

\[61\] See: Shoghi Effendi, Bahá’í Education, pp. 49-50. (According to Shoghi Effendi ‘Every child
without exception must from his earliest years make a thorough study of the art of reading and
writing … To assist the children of the poor in the attainment of these accomplishments, and
particularly in learning the basic subjects, it is incumbent upon the members of the Spiritual
Assemblies.’)

2\.5.2       The Bahá’í view on begging
Is there a place for begging (‫ ﺗﮑﺪﯼی‬- takadi) in the Bahá’í community? Two issues
are relevant to this discussion. First: at an individual level, Bahá’ís are forbidden
to beg, the law of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas is very clear about this,

> It is unlawful to beg, and it is forbidden to give to him
> who beggeth. All have been enjoined to earn a living, and
> as for those who are incapable of doing so, it is incumbent
> on the Deputies of God62 and on the wealthy to make
> adequate provision for them.63

The rationale of the injunction against begging is that it is offensive to the dignity
of a person. A person who takes begging as a profession, living off others while
contributing nothing, is considered a beggar, and should not be encouraged.

Bahá’í writings suggest that begging is a social ill and therefore, not only should
be discouraged, but also prohibited and entirely removed from the face of society.
However, one must differentiate between the ill, disabled, disadvantaged, and the
deserving poor, and the able individuals who resort to begging out of idleness. A
distinction is made between giving to those who beg professionally, and those
who are poor because they are incapable of working or because their earning is
not sufficient for an adequate living. This view is supported by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in
the following statement:

> Mendicancy is forbidden and that giving charity to people
> who take up begging as their profession is also prohibited
> ...The object is to uproot mendicancy altogether. However,
> if a person is incapable of earning a living, is stricken by
> dire poverty or becometh helpless, then it is incumbent on

\[62\] In this passage, ‘Deputies of God’ refers to members of Local Spiritual Assemblies.

\[63\] Bahá’u’lláh. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, verse 147.

> the wealthy or the Deputies to provide him with a monthly
> allowance for his subsistence.64

Why is mendicancy so highly disapproved of by Bahá’u’lláh while giving to
charity is highly encouraged? Can we try to form a more precise picture of what
Bahá’u’lláh has condemned? For example, we are familiar with street beggars,
adults and children who often appear to be homeless and beg for money. Some
may suffer from mental or physical disabilities. Is that what Bahá’u’lláh has
forbidden or condemned? The Bahá’í writings support charity for assisting those
who are in need. For a person who suffers hardship due to circumstances beyond
her or his control, Bahá’ís are enjoined to show compassion and be charitable.
Bahá’u’lláh confirms this, saying: ‘Charity is pleasing and praiseworthy in the
sight of God and is regarded as a prince among goodly deeds.’65 Bahá’ís are
encouraged to become ‘a source of social goods.’66 In contrast to beggars, the
poor have a very special place in the Bahá’í writings. The rich are told to have the
utmost regard for the poor. In numerous writings, the central figures of the Bahá’í
faith encourage the wealthy to take care of the poor. Instructing the rich,
Bahá’u’lláh said ‘O ye rich ones on earth! The poor in your midst are My trust,
guard ye My trust, and be not intent only on your own ease.’67 These passages
clearly confirm that the Bahá’í writings consider the rich responsible for
alleviating poverty and for improving the living standards of the poor. However,
the nature of giving should not be for the sake of receiving public recognition, or
deriving more benefits. The intention of the donors should be sincere altruism.
Within Bahá’í communities, helping the poor usually comes through development

projects, and contributing time and funds to Bahá’í institutions that carry out these
responsibilities. It seems that the focus on begging certainly needs to be coupled
with a focus on the rich and their extravagant practices, which may have
contributed to the need for begging in the first place. Virtues such as generosity,
compassion, kindness, thoughtfulness and justice, require action, otherwise they
do not exist or their existence can be challenged. These qualities are only there if
they are acted upon. The expressions ‘be’ generous, or ‘be’ compassionate,
conveys an action, without which it is not there! One cannot be compassionate
without practicing compassion.

Will there be a need for charity when poverty is eliminated? Generosity is an
altruistic act of human being and will always need to be practiced. It may be
argued that one of the reasons for eradication of poverty in the future would be
continued acts of generosity and charitable giving. There will always be people
who will not have the ability to earn sufficiently to live comfortably. Generosity
and charitable acts are long standing traditions in all cultures, with or without
religious affiliation, and continue to exist.

The Bahá’í law of prohibiting begging on one hand and the need for adequate
provision for the poor and needy by Local Spiritual Assemblies on the other,
makes one wonder if individual Bahá’ís asking for help from Assemblies is a
form of begging? Researching the Bahá’í writings, it is notable that Bahá’í
teachings are interrelated and interconnected, and should be looked at collectively
rather than separately. For example, as discussed earlier, compulsory education
encourages the Bahá’ís to acquire skills that help them acquire work, which would

benefit themselves and others. Furthermore, work being considered as worship
encourages Bahá’ís not to remain idle. Also, since giving to the Bahá’í Fund is a
spiritual obligation, any inappropriate use of this Fund would be deemed morally
wrong. The establishment of the Institution of the House of Worship and its
dependent agencies provides several opportunities for the deserving poor to be
engaged in learning necessary talents, which would help them to work. It should
be noted that according to the Bahá’í writings, the House of Justice would
determine the details of how the deserving poor will be protected and the nature
of the help given to them. The emphasis is that the type of problems change at
different times and a new solution is required. Bahá’u’lláh provides the solution:

> Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for
> every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should
> be referred to the Ministers of the House of Justice that
> they may act accordingly to the needs and requirements of
> the time.68

At the present time, Local Spiritual Assemblies deal with this matter according to
the community’s needs and available resources.

Also, as the Bahá’í community evolves and the economic principles are applied,
absolute poverty shall disappear and there will not be any need for one to beg or
the possibility for individuals to stay idle. However, it is not reasonable to think
that the individuals’ generosity is the only way of dealing with the challenges of
begging. The role of government is crucial in eradicating begging, through
legislation and other methods such as social welfare programs. This is practical in
the more developed countries. Of course, the question will be raised if collecting

\[68\] Bahá’u’lláh. Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 27.

monetary assistance from the welfare system is considered as a type of begging.
If, despite attempts for one to engage in some form of work, one still remains in
need, then it would be the responsibility of the state or the assemblies to ensure
their well-being. Government should provide a variety of benefits for improving
the general well-being of the population rather than individuals asking for it. The
provider is the government who distributes necessary resources for the well-being
of all. Of course, it is vital to realise the realities that different countries are
politically, religiously and economically varied and complex.

2\.5.3   Equal opportunity for women and men
The Bahá’ís believes in equality of opportunity for women and men in social and
economic contribution. This principle has an important implication in increasing
the supply of the workforce and hence the level of production. The Bahá’í
literatures suggest the active participation of women in all aspects of community
life. It is stated that ‘Women have astonishing capacities.’ 69 The benefits of
discovering and using the capacity of women are many and affect the whole of
society. These include increasing economic growth worldwide, particularly in
developing countries, and a decline in the number of people living in poverty.
Therefore, statements such as ‘womankind may develop equal capacity and
importance with man in the social and economic equation,’70 if applied in practice
would significantly enable the other half of the human population, women, to
engage in all levels of social and economic activity, once equal opportunity is
provided.

\[69\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Women, Compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of
Justice, Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre, 1986, p. 50.

\[70\] Ibid., p. 37.

However, according to Arthur Dahl ‘The inequality of opportunity to which
women are subjected in many cultures already handicaps [a part of] the human
population (emphasis added).’71 Looking back in history, women were deemed
incapable - culturally and religiously, and did not have fair opportunity to be
educated or to participate in the decision making of the social and economic life
of the family and the community, even though they carried a lot of the
responsibilities. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirmed: ‘Woman’s lack of progress and
proficiency has been due to her need of equal education and opportunity. Had she
been allowed this equality, there is no doubt she would be the counterpart of man
in ability and capacity.’72

The global gender gap remains a matter of concern for those agencies working for
its removal, including the Bahá’í International Community, who are working
toward ensuring the same opportunity for women. It should be noted that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá expressed his views on equal opportunity more than one hundred years ago
and since then the opportunities for women have significantly improved in the
Bahá’í community, as well as globally. The practice of equal opportunity for
women and men is a significant factor in correcting ‘labour market failure’
including the removal of barriers to increasing production levels. John Huddleston
considers equality of opportunity ‘as an essential part of a just society.’73 In a
study of ‘global gender gap’, the World economic forum, 2005, named the
following five areas necessary for improving the condition of women: economic

opportunity,   economic     participation,    political   empowerment,    educational
attainment, and health and well-being.

It is important to note that in the more developed countries the principle of equal
opportunity is practiced more effectively. For example, women are relatively
more active in social, political and economic activities than countries without the
same privileges. However, it may be difficult for all women, including Bahá’ís, to
actively participate in social and economic development if their government or the
law of the land does not permit equal opportunity.

A factor closely related to gender gap, and a barrier to increasing the supply of
labour, is the existence of discrimination, in particular wage discrimination. Wage
discrimination exists because there is less demands for a particular group of
people, in this case the women. In relation to our current discussion, it is where
employers undervalue the services of female workers. Discrimination is also
prevalent in other areas such as race, colour and nationality, although, it is illegal
in most developed countries. Discrimination results in an inefficient allocation of
resources and inequitable wage differences. One of its costs is that the group
discriminated against clearly suffers as they find it harder to gain employment and
are likely to be paid less than other workers doing the same work. In addition,
some may have to settle for jobs that do not utilise their talents and skills, may be
overlooked for promotion, and may not be selected to go on training courses. The
economy also suffers, as a result of discrimination because it leads to
misallocation of resources. To avoid misallocation of resources, the factors of
production such as land, labour, capital and enterprise, should be allocated and

used in the right proportion to maximise output with the available resources.
There is growing interest in the view that underdevelopment may not just be a
matter of lack of, or shortage of factors of production but also a consequence of
discrimination and the misuse of, available resources. Tai Hsieh and Peter Klenow
have argued that ‘misallocation of inputs across firms can reduce aggregate total
factor productivity in a country.’74 Banerjee and Duflo emphasise the importance
of resource misallocation in understanding the differences across countries of the
total level of manufacturing output, and based on evidence suggesting that
‘…gaps in marginal products of capital in India could play a large role in India’s
low manufacturing relative to that of the United States.’75 The effective output
would be below the potential output which could be achieved if groups were not
discriminated against in terms of employment, pay, promotion and training. The
experience in countries that have been relatively successful in implementing equal
opportunity indicates that the role of government is a necessary factor.

Studies have found that where women’s share of income within the home is
relatively high and there is less discrimination against girls, women are better able
to meet their own needs as well as those of their children. Supporting this point,
Todaro and Smith writes:

> When household income is marginal, virtually 100% of
> women’s income is contributed towards household
> nutritional intake. Since this fraction is considerably

Therefore, the persistence of low standards of living among women and children
is common where the economic status of women remains low.

Todaro and Smith raise a legitimate question: Why is female education important?
There now exists ample empirical evidence that educational discrimination
against women not only reinforces social inequality but also hinders economic
development. Investigating this, Todaro and Smith argues that closing the
educational gender gap by expanding educational opportunities for women, is
economically desirable for a number of reasons: 1. It increases their productivity
on the farm and in the factory and results in greater labour force participation. 2. It
improves child health and nutrition, as more educated mothers lead to multiplier
effects77 on the quality of a nation’s human resources for many generations to
come. 3. Because women carry a disproportionate burden of the poverty, any
significant improvements in their role and status via education can have an
important impact on breaking the vicious circle of poverty.

2\.5.4   The importance of education and training
Provision of the right training has proved to be the most effective way of
revealing the human potential, improving the scale of productivity and increasing

\[76\] Michael Todaro and Stephen Smith. Economic Development, 9th ed., London: Pearson Education
Ltd., 2006, p. 229.

(The concept is developed by Keynes and states that if one of the components of aggregate
demand such as investment on training and education increase, the national income will increase
by a multiple of the original increase.)

the level of production. Absence or shortage of it, can be a major barrier in the
supply of necessary workforce in the labour market. The Bahá’í principle of
universal and compulsory education is an effective way of dealing with such
deficiency. Education and training is a vital key in increasing production level
and is conducive to personal growth and transformation of society. The Bahá’í
writings indicate that humans have great potential that needs to be discovered.
Bahá’u’lláh states ‘Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.
Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to
benefit therefrom.’78 Businesses recognise that investing in education and training
is necessary to reveal the human treasure, which is the human talent, potential,
and proficiency. The World Bank has done a comprehensive study, which shows
that investing more education and training has a direct impact on improving
economic performance. The findings show that the profitability of investment in
education is an attractive opportunity in the world today.79 Hence, investment in
education has the potential to increase the total supply of skilled labour force and
improve the employment prospects of unemployed workers. Of course, the
economic returns from extra investment in education can vary, according to the
stage of economic development that a country has achieved and the amount
invested in training and education, and also the type of education required in the
labour market.

Although the responsibility for the education of children lies with both parents,
and despite men increasingly taking a more active role, the mother still takes on

the primary responsibility for educating the child from its infancy in the majority
of cases. This, however means that they might not be able to take advantage of
equal opportunities. Although in Europe and North America most mothers are
eager to train their children and pay a great deal of attention to this important
matter. In many other parts of the world, women may not be able to do so because
of not having the opportunity to receive relevant education and training
themselves, or having access to material resources. Clearly, those women who are
getting financial assistance in the form of loan from the Grameen Bank are able to
provide better education for their children.80 The Bahá’í faith emphasises that all
children should be educated. However, if in some circumstances parents only
have the financial ability to educate one child, preference must be given to the
education of girls because they are the future mothers and educators of children. It
is stated that,

> The decision-making agencies involved would do well to
> consider giving first priority to the education of women
> and girls, since it is through educated mothers that the
> benefits of knowledge can be most effectively and rapidly
> diffused throughout society.81

This is significant because through an educated mother, a better and healthier
environment is created at home for the education of children. Commenting on
this, prominent Bahá’í Madeline Hellaby writes:

> situation is such that choice has to be made is quite the

The view is therefore, that if mothers are educated and possess the learning and
accomplishments of humankind, her children, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá points out are
‘…like unto angels, will be fostered in all excellence...’83

2\.5.5    A consultative method of decision-making
Organisations that are using a consultative method of decision-making become
more successful in achieving its objectives and attracting better workers to the
workplace. According to an investigation by Matthew Hind and introducing a new
development program to help quality professionals with the process of managing
change within organization. According to him:

> The role of quality managers has changed significantly…
> They are no longer controllers and policemen but need to
> become change agents and influencers. The role has
> become that of an internal consultant, aiming to bring
> about change in a positive manner supported by all within
> the company.84

Hind then focuses on the benefits of making decisions through a consultative
method and writes:

> This method is focused on helping quality managers to
> develop the skills and competences necessary to carry out
> this role of internal consultant successfully. Its key
> objective is to develop the quality professional’s
> consulting skills to help them in the implementation of

organization’s quality management.85

Participation through consultation provides an opportunity for employees to think
constructively about issues that affect them, to contribute ideas for improvement,
to engage in problem solving, and to work as a team in implementing good work
practices. Morally and humanely and perhaps economically, workers are entitled
to be aware of and be involved in activities that affect their lives, within and
outside the workplace. These are motivational factors that make workers
productive. Through a consultative method of decision-making workers find a
sense of belonging to the organisation, which improves productivity and
consequently the output. The benefits of such involvement are substantial.
Employees will value the fact that their employer recognises their needs and
satisfactorily rewards their efforts. In turn, the employer can significantly increase
profitability by retaining experienced, motivated and productive staff. Apart from
these ideas and advantages of consultation, Hind identifies the following seven
benefits: clarity and confidence in the product or service being provided; trusting
and sound relationship between client and consultant; shared diagnosis of the need
to change; shared ownership of the design of the program; willingness of both
parties to adjust and modify plans; avoidance of quick fixes by both parties; and
finishing the program when the organization has stabilized and not before.86

But, what are the fundamentals of the Bahá’í model of decision-making or
‘consultation’? For a collective decision making the following two conditions are
suggested by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. ‘The first condition is absolute love and harmony

\[85\] Hind. Training for Quality Journal, vol. 2, 1994, p. 26.

\[86\] Hind. Training for Quality Journal, p. 27.

amongst the members of the assembly. … The second condition: They must when
coming together turn faces to the Kingdom on High and ask from the Realm of
Glory.’87 Immediately after the two conditions, He gives five rules of procedure
for consultation, ‘The must then proceed with utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity,
care and moderation to express their views.’ 88 A fundamental principle of
consultative process is the creation of strong trust among different groups of
people in the community, which is ‘a prerequisite of any efforts to translate
collective decisions into collective actions.’89 Another feature is that, ‘when an
idea is put forth it becomes the property of the group.’ 90 The principle of
detachment from one’s personal views is another feature of Bahá’í consultation.
This means, ‘individual participants strive to become dispassionate with their
respective points of view.’91 Bahá’ís consider the notion of detachment from one’s
personal views as an important principle of consultation. For this rule, ‘…all ideas
cease to be the property of any individual, subgroup, or constituency.’92 Of course,
as commented by Bahá’í scholar Michael Karlberg, Bahá’ís recognise that the
detachment prescribed above does not always come easily – even to those who are
committed to it in theory.93 It is stated in the Bahá’í writings that ‘Consultation is
no easy skill to learn’94. But commitment to the process, they suggest, results not
only in more effective collective decision-making but also in the maturation of

individual participants, as well as whole community.95 Bahá’ís therefore, view
consultation as ‘a learning process and they believe that the skills and attitudes
developed through consultation are as important as the specific decisions arrived
at.’96 Another principle of Bahá’í consultation is exercising care and moderation in
one’s manner of expression. It is stated that ‘freedom of speech must necessarily
be disciplined by a profound appreciation of both the positive and negative
dimensions of freedom, on the one hand, and of speech, on the other hand.’97 This
is necessary because it is only ‘within an atmosphere of mutual respect, support
and encouragement, rather than aggression and intimidation, can clarity of
thought prevail and the perspectives of all people be heard.’ 98 Another
fundamental principle of Bahá’í consultation is the requirement that the context of
decision-making itself be raised to the level of principle as distinct from political
pragmatism. Commenting on the inordinate disparity between the rich and the
poor, we read in the Promise of the World Peace:

> The solution calls for the combined application of
> spiritual, moral and practical approaches. A fresh look at
> the problem is required, entailing consultation with
> experts from a wide spectrum of disciplines, devoid of
> economic and ideological polemics, and involving the
> people directly affected in the decisions that must urgently
> be made.99

It can be argued that the application of consultation in the ‘new economy,’ in
contrast to the ‘old economy,’ 100 with an emphasis on the contribution of

innovation and information technology in creating e-commerce, makes
communication and decision-making more effective, particularly among internal
stakeholders. Internal stakeholders are defined as those people whose activities
are a part of, or influence, the internal value chain of the firm.101 In the ‘new
economy,’ though, socially responsible policies ought not to conflict with
economic goals and should be integrated into the decision-making process.

The principle of consultation has been criticized for resulting in slow making, and
not being effective during emergency time, which require a decision to be made
quickly. Also, group decision-making, as John Bratton argues ‘…might allow
individual members to escape responsibility and to encourage groupthink.’ 102
However, as consultative methods of decision-making become the norm and a
part of the culture of an organisation, all members become accustomed to the
technique of making decisions collectively. Alternatively, leaders may, in the
short run, adopt a combination of intuition and consultation for making decisions.

2\.5.6   Employee-employer relationship
The conventional method used in the past to deal with issues related to employer-
employee relationships, was through trade union negotiations. In the case of a
failure to reach a particular settlement, such as in wage negotiation, industrial
action, including strike, was endorsed. The Bahá’í literatures support a fair wage
system, but using strike action as a means of dealing with industrial disputes over

Education, 2010, p. 416.

wage is not supported. For ‘Abdu’l-Bahá there are two possible causes of strike.
‘One is the excessive greed and rapacity of the factory owners, and the other is the
gratuitous demands, the greed, and the intransigence of the workers. One must
therefore seek to address both.’ 103 According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the ‘principle
cause’104 is the current laws, which may ‘Lead to a small number of individuals
accumulating incomparable fortunes, beyond their needs, while the greater
number remain destitute, stripped and in the greatest misery.’ 105 It is therefore
reasonable that while the law allows injustices in wages and working conditions,
the labour force may not have any other means of standing up for what may be
rightfully theirs.

In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, the popularity of union
membership, as a proportion of the total labour force, has fallen in recent years.106
For further analysis it is necessary to look at the main reasons for the formation of
trade unions, which include: wage negotiation with the owner of a factory,
improvement of working conditions, provision of necessary training, and other
activities, such as organising of strikes to force the owner of the factory to accept
their demands. The causes for such a decline in its popularity are many. One is
that governments have passed new laws for a fair pay system, such as ‘national
minimum wage legislation.’107 The policy of establishing regulations to increase

million in 2002. For the full report see: Labour market participation: the influence of social capital,

the earnings of the under-paid is supported by the Bahá’í writings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
affirms:

> …Laws and regulations should be enacted which would
> grant the workers both a daily wage and a share in a fourth
> or fifth of the profits of the factory in accordance with it’s
> means, or which would have the workers equitably share
> in some other way in the profits with the owners.108

In this passage, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá consider a fair wage system which is more than just
a minimum wage, it is a living-wage. In other words, it is the minimum income
necessary for a worker to meet their needs that are considered to be basic. He
suggests that workers be paid part of the company’s profits (chapter 3, section
3\.7.3). Other factors that reduce the need for Trade Unions are that the
government and employers support and provide training programmes for workers,
and a democratic and consultative approach to decision-making is adopted by
increasing number of organisations for negotiations and problem solving. The
direct participation of workers in the working environment creates a sense of
belonging. Such an approach in dealing with problems in the workplace does not
require trade union involvement. Globalisation can also play an important role in
the decline of trade union power. If workers are not satisfied with the working
conditions or wages, they have the possibility to move to another company and
even to another country. Geographical mobility of labour is easier now and takes
place mainly at the regional level, such as within the European Union.

2\.5.7      Cooperation instead of competition
In the sphere of private or personal relations, Karlberg argues that much of human

\[108\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions, p. 317.

interaction has been, and continues to be, relatively cooperative and mutualistic.
According to him ‘…the historical process of nation building, the emergence of
democratic systems of government and the establishment of the rule of law within
these nations all reflect degrees of mutualism and cooperation expressed on
historically unprecedented scale.’109 Further, he points out that many traditional
non-western, civilisations have placed a strong value on harmony and collective
interdependence rather than on conflict and competitive individualism. Such
cooperative and mutualistic attitudes have, in turn, supported the development of
sophisticated arts, sciences and technologies, as well as complex and extensive
systems of public administration.110

Aggressive competition without government regulation may lead to greater
organisational domination in the market, which, in turn, may lead to the removal
of smaller firms, causing unemployment. For example, how can small family
businesses operate and survive when there are large multinational companies,
with the advantage of lower costs in the developing countries from where they
operate? Or, how can family businesses with no information technology and
capital investment, survive while transnational companies are equipped with the
most advanced operational techniques? Small firms and family businesses are an
important source of employment everywhere and will continue facing enormous
challenges in competition with multinational corporations, unless these small
firms can create their own unique markets and products that are distinguishable.

\[109\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Huququ’lláh, Compiled by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of
Canada, 1986, P. 82.

\[110\] Ibid.

The Bahá’í principles of moderation in all aspects of life, including a
moderate-sized business, will be of great advantage to small businesses.
Consumer education also helps to support small firms. In 1936 Shoghi Effendi
said that the market must be regulated. A number of countries, such as the United
Kingdom and other members of the European Union, have formed organisations
such as the Competition Commission, to regulate the market in favour of
consumer benefits and protect small businesses. Although it can be argued that
these regulatory bodies may not be that effective because of individual national
government agendas.

In the analysis of the importance of cooperation, consideration should be given to
the function of science and information technology in influencing the practicality
of cooperation and reducing costs, due to coordinating economic activities. The
challenge, however, is that in the new forms of organisational structure, the
workforce must be trained to understand the fundamental dynamics of
cooperation in order to evaluate their industrial relationships. Success depends on
cooperation and willingness among the owners, managers, consumers, suppliers,
and the government.

In spite of the drawbacks of competition, the Bahá’í writings support competition
if ‘…any benefits arising from praiseworthy deeds shall fall to the individuals that
compete with each other in benevolent works.’ 111 It can be interpreted that
competition is therefore acceptable in those activities such as education and
service to humanity. Bahá’ís are counselled to ‘Vie …with each other in the

\[111\] Bahá’u’lláh. Huququ’lláh, p. 13.

service of God and of his Cause.’112 Shoghi Effendi was ‘grieved to hear bitter
competition’ 113 between some Bahá’ís, and he advised them ‘to maintain
unreservedly the one true standard of business conduct inculcated in the teachings
[of the faith] (emphasis added).’114

2\.6   Chapter conclusion
This chapter has assessed and examined some of the key Bahá’í principles related
to ‘work ethics’ and ‘sustainable production’, and their impact on the economic
life of Bahá’ís, the Bahá’í community and the wider society. An attempt has been
made to discuss and define two key expressions of ‘work ethics’ and ‘sustainable
production’. A distinctive principle, and a core Bahá’í belief, discussed in this
chapter is the concept of ‘work as worship’. It was noted that although this
concept is a core Bahá’í belief, the idea is not new and has been mentioned by
others and written in the history of work ethics. Bahá’ís hold the view that work is
necessary for material and spiritual progress. However, work is worship when it is
performed in the spirit of service. This means that even in this age of abundance,
(for some people) service to others as a moral obligation needs to be stressed. I
considered several principles under the heading of ‘Bahá’í work ethics’, including
a consultative or democratic method of decision-making, profit sharing, gender
equality, and considering work as worship. These are few examples needed for
accelerating the process of increasing the supply of labour in the market. Another

profession and actively seek work. This is a positive attitude that makes a Bahá’í a
productive contributor to the whole of society. Any Bahá’í discussion on the
subject of ‘work’ and occupation cannot overlook the importance of agriculture.
Although there is great emphasis on both manufacturing and agricultures, ‘special
regard’ is given to the matter of agriculture.

There are academic debates with regards to integrating work with other aspect of
life such as the importance of family, education, skill learning, opportunity for
employment, and wage differentials. Therefore it is imperative for studies and
debates in this field to be continued, so that, one day, work will be considered as
worship. Thus the aim of this research is to provide a more clear and conscious
interpretation of the concept of ‘work as worship’ stated in the Bahá’í primary
writings and explained by William Hatcher and Lawrence Miller.

The Bahá’í writings suggest a number of ways for creating a more effective
working environment, including: Consultation (chapter 7, section 7.5 and chapter
2, section 2.5.5); profit sharing (chapter 3, section 3.7.3); wage differentials or
performance related pay or equity principle (chapter 3); positive attitude towards
wealth (chapter 3.4); equal opportunity (chapter 2, section 2.5.3); universal and
compulsory education (chapter 5, section 5.4.1); skill learning (chapter 2, section
2\.5.4); and the importance of service. When practiced, it is most likely that the
above principles enable the younger generation of Bahá’ís to have a better grasp
of the value of wealth; how to earn and how to spend it.

It is acknowledged that the advancement of technology and know-how has created

a condition that people now have the capacity to produce enough for greater
population. The challenge, however, is to ensure that this is happening and greater
number of people can enjoy the outcome. The solution is to execute ‘distributive
justice’. This aspect will be discussed in the next chapter.

Chapter 3: Distributive Justice

3\.1   Introduction
The United Nations Charter of Human Rights considers having access to basic
needs as human rights. However, this is only in theory because although in
modern time the wealth of nations has increased substantially, currently one
billion people live in absolute poverty.2 The challenge, therefore, is not in the
level of production and productivity, but in a fair and just distribution of the
wealth created. Throughout the history of economics, the distribution of income
and wealth among the members of society has been a major concern. There has not
only been a desire to explain the pattern of distribution, but also a belief that basic
issues of justice and fairness and morality were involved. Consequently, most of
the theories of economic justice focus on distributive justice. Philosophers, historians
and economists have been debating the concept of economic justice for so long.
Although what constitutes justice may vary from time to time and from culture to
culture, or depend on historical context, all forms of justice are founded on the
basis of ethical assumptions that include ideas about morality, fairness, and the

law. Issues related to extremes of wealth and poverty and the justification of
principles of equity and equality have been raised and discussed by contemporary
economists such as Amartya Sen, Thomas Piketty, John Rawls Michael Sandel,
Kate Pickett and others. The role of government is also crucial in administering
distributive justice and the Bahá’í literatures support such intervention. The key
feature of this chapter is to discuss the relationship between distributive justice
and human well-being (‫ ﺭرﻓﺎﻩه‬- refáh). The study includes discussing a number of
principles that lead to prosperity for all members of society, advocated by the
central figures of the Bahá’í faith. The meaning and significance of wealth will
also be explored, hence discussing the research question of the impact of
distributive justice on the Bahá’í community and in the wider society.

3\.2   The significance of distributive justice
According to economist Thomas Piketty, ‘The distribution of wealth is one of
today’s most widely discussed and controversial issues.’3 Piketty is concerned
about the long-term evolution of wealth. He raises questions such as do the
dynamics of private capital accumulation inevitably lead to the concentration of
wealth in ever fewer hands? This aspect of wealth redistribution and its
accumulation in the hands of few was what Karl Marx was also concerned with in
the 19th century. Piketty wondered if the balancing forces of growth, competition
and technological progress would lead to reduced inequality and greater harmony
among the classes in the latter stages of development? This feature of wealth

redistribution created interest and was discussed by economist Simon Kuznets4 in
the 20th century.

According to Bryan Graham ‘The exploration of the Bahá’í teachings on
economics has occupied an important place in the redistribution of income and
wealth, which in return has an important effect on the Bahá’í community.’5 The
Bahá’í concept of well-being in relation to distributive justice needs to be
explored. In the Bahá’í literature, the notion of well-being and prosperity has been
shifted from individual to collective well-being. There are numerous references
confirming this view. For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states ‘…prefer the general
well-being to your personal well-being.’ 6 How challenging is the notion of
preferring the well-being of others to one’s own comfort and happiness? So far,
limited research has been done in this regard, but there are numerous examples of
charitable work and philanthropist activities by people, poor and rich, sacrificing
their own comfort to bring comfort to the lives of others. Examples include Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation, Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Nelson Mandela, and
Warren Buffett. In the Bahá’í community, group of individuals known as
‘pioneers’7 are examples of this observation. There is a positive correlation a
between willingness to sacrifice one’s own material well-being and distributive
justice. The more people contribute sacrificially, the more effective is distributive

\[4\] Simon Smith Kuznets (1901-1985) was an American economist, statistician, demographer, and
economic historian who won the 1971 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He suggested
a measure of income inequality that can be derived from the ratio of the incomes received by the
top 20% and bottom 40% of the population. The ration is used as a measure of the degree of
inequality between high and low income group in a country (See: Todaro and Smith, p. 196).

justice, and hence in the long run there may be less government involvement in
conducting wealth redistribution. In one of his writings, Shoghi Effendi interpret
the term ‘sacrificially’, he writes, ‘…For after all it is not so much the quantity of
one’s offerings that mattes, but rather the measure of deprivation that such
offerings entail…’8 In its simplest terms, giving sacrificially means giving so that
it hurts. Putting another way, if one donates an amount that the person does not
really miss, it may be giving, but it is not a sacrifice.

Economics and religion are in agreement that redistribution of income and wealth
is necessary and desirable. Religion is more a general term, but in theory taking
care of the poor is encouraged in all faiths. For example, in the Judaism tradition
wealth redistribution includes compassion for those who could not help
themselves, care for the stranger, and charity. 9 The Christian tradition of
redistribution of income and wealth dealing with poverty is the parable of the
‘Good Samaritan,’ which is helping the stranger, sharing of resources, loving the
enemy, supporting and healing, security for all, getting the poor back on his or her
feet, and being fully integrated in the life of those in need.10 Similarly, the Islamic
tradition of dealing with the issue of poverty through income and wealth
redistribution includes the basic principles of sharing, the law of Zakát (Zakáh),
sincere spirit of generosity, and Islamic finance, which is the rejection of interest

on borrowing.11 The spirit of the parable of the Good Samaritan in Christianity and
Zakát in Islam are examples of religious duty with deep spiritual implications and
is therefore a form of worship. In the Bahá’í scriptures the rich are given the
responsibility of taking care of the poor. Addressing the rich, the founder of this
faith states, ‘O ye rich ones on earth! The poor in your midst are My trust, guard
ye My trust, and be not intent only on your own ease.’12 In this passage the rich
are directed to take care of the poor. It requires a great amount of material
sacrifice and spiritual enrichment to guard the poor. However, directing the
wealthy Bahá’ís does not exclude the poor from taking responsibility for their
own lives. For example, Shoghi Effendi states that ‘Every individual, no matter
how handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation of engaging in
some work or profession…’13 The term handicapped may raise a question as to
how would one expect a handicapped person to work and whether this refers to
someone with physical or mental disability. No further explanation is found in the
Bahá’í writings of the exact nature of the term handicapped. However, it may be
argued that the effectiveness of the use of a disabled person to work depends on
the availability of social and medical services along with technological
advancement to support such people to be engaged in some kind of work they can
do. In developing countries more attention is paid to ensure people with physical
and mental disabilities receive appropriate support to engage in some form of
profession, which improves their sense of well being, as well as allows them to be
me productive members of the society.

Andrew Crane and Dirk Matten define justice as ‘The simultaneously fair
treatment of individuals in a given situation with the result that everybody gets
what they deserve.’14 The crucial ethical issue with this definition is the question
of what exactly ‘fairness’ means and by what standards we can decide what a
person might reasonably deserve. According to Beauchamp and Bowie, theories
of justice typically see fairness in two main ways. First, fair procedure, which is
determined according to whether everyone has had an equal opportunity to
achieve what is needed for a just reward for one’s efforts (procedural justice).
Second, fair outcomes, which are determined according to whether the
consequences are distributed in a just manner (distributive justice).15

Bahá’í scholar Udo Schaefer defines distributive justice as a pattern that
‘…regulates the distribution of goods, benefits and burdens in the sharing of the
common good.’16 Existing economic systems, such as ‘the free market economy’
and ‘planned economy’, have adopted a different pattern of regulating a just
distribution of income and wealth in an economy. The first one is called
‘commutative justice’17, where it is held that each person should receive income in
proportion to the value of labour and capital they have contributed to the
productive process. According to Alan Griffiths and Stuart Wall, this view
underlies the ideology of the free market economy. The second view is called
‘distributive justice’. In this view it is believed that people should receive income

according to their need. Given that people’s needs are much the same,
‘distributive justice’ 18 , according to Griffiths and Wall, implies approximate
equality in income distribution. This view underlies the ideology of socialism. In
the Bahá’í writings, the advantages of both systems are considered for effective
wealth redistribution. For example, there are references that both private and
public sectors play an important role in the pattern of regulating an economy’s
resources. Hence, a distinguishing factor separating the two systems of ‘planned’
and ‘free market economy’ is the judgement of government in the distribution of
resources among its citizens (chapter 3, section 3.7.1). The application of these
views will be considered in chapter 7, the Bahá’í inspired model of economic
sustainability.

Is social justice about equality or equity? It can be argued that the goal of social
justice is for people to be equal. Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett argue that
‘more equal societies tend to be more creative.’19 For example countries which
practicing gender equality and religious freedom are more creative and
economically more advanced.              However, from a Bahá’í perspective when
discussing distributive justice from purely monetary standpoint, equity is
preferred to equality. The Bahá’í writings suggest equality in opportunity, to
ensure that prospect of access to material and social resources are justly and fairly
distributed. Confirming this view Shoghi Effendi said, ‘It is the duty of those who
are in charge of the organization of society to give every individual the
opportunity of acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also

the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for the sake of
earning the means of his livelihood.’20 The view is that each individual’s talents
and abilities are different and hence their economic contribution to society varies,
but, opportunity should be there for all. However, aside from equality in dignity
and worth, human beings are not born the same. Therefore, the Bahá’í view is that
every human is unique, and that human beings are not the same.

3\.3    A discussion of the contemporary theories of distributive justice
The problem of just distribution of wealth at different times and in different
societies has been addressed in various ways and has been affected by diverse
economic and philosophical views. Just distribution generally falls between the
two extreme views of egalitarianism and non-egalitarianism. The egalitarian21
approach claims that justice is the same as equality. The view expresses that
burden and rewards should be distributed equally. Hence, according to
Beauchamp and Bowie ‘deviation from equality is considered as unjust.’ 22
According to Peter Lambert’s interpretation, egalitarianism is a process of ‘…a
rich-to-poor income transfers… and a more equal subdivision of any fixed cake
will be recommended.’ 23 For Joseph Carens, however, equal distribution of
income or ‘egalitarian system’ is combined with economic efficiency, freedoms as
a private property market system, and moral incentives as a major source of
motivation for economic activities. Consequently, the situation that 80% of the

\[21\] For egalitarian approach, the doctrine that moral and political life should be aimed at respecting
and advancing the ‘equality of persons,’ See: Joseph Carens. Equality, Moral Incentives, and the

Press, 1981, p. 4.

world’s resources are owned by 20% of the world population is clearly unjust to
an egalitarian.     On the other hand, non-egalitarians claim that justice in an
economic system is ultimately a product of the fair process of free markets.
Buyers with certain needs would meet sellers who can respond to the needs. If the
two parties agree on a transaction, then the market forces of supply and demand
determine justice. This view is popularly associated with the work of Adam
Smith. Obviously these two extreme answers to the question of what exactly
justice means in an economic context are unsatisfactory. The answer might well
lie in between the two. A very popular approach to this problem has been
proposed by John Rawls24 (1971). In his theory of justice he suggests two criteria.
According to Rawls, justice is achieved when:

> First, each person is to have an equal right to the most
> extensive total system of basic liberties compatible with a
> similar system of liberal for all. Second, social and
> economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are
> both: a) the greatest benefit of the least advantaged; and b)
> attached to offices and positions open to all under
> conditions of fair equality of opportunity.25

The first principle states that before allowing for any inequalities we should
ensure that the basic freedom is realised to the same degree for everyone affected
by the decision. The first condition thus looks to general human rights and
requires their fulfilment before we would be able to proceed to the next step.

In economics several reasons have been put forward for a just redistribution of

\[24\] John Rawls (1921-2002). His theory of justice as fairness envisions a society of free citizens
holding equal basic rights cooperating within an egalitarian economic system. His writings on the
law of peoples extend these theories to liberal foreign policy, with the goal of imagining how a
peaceful and tolerant international order might be possible. (The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy,
2nd ed., Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 308.)

wealth. In the nineteenth century, utilitarian including Jeremy Bentham (1748-
1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806 - 1873) proposed that as income increases, the
additional satisfaction from it decreases.26 They refer to the application of the law
of diminishing marginal utility. The law states that as people consume more of a
good, the utility gained from each successive unit declines. 27 The utilitarian,
therefore, believes that transferring income and wealth from the rich to the poor
would increase the total human well-being and happiness. This is because the
poor would get more satisfaction than the rich from each pound transferred. Some
elements of this theory of redistribution are supported in the Bahá’í writings.
However, there are disagreement in some areas, for example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
view is that wealth is commendable if the whole society benefits from it (chapter
3, section 3.4). This view supports the utilitarian view of redistribution to increase
the total human well-being and happiness. However, the nature of human well-
being and happiness need to be clarified. True happiness in the Bahá’í writings
includes both material and spiritual.

Another economic argument in favour of redistribution of income and wealth is
based on market failure. Market failure is the misallocation of resources, or when
the economy is not balanced. 28 Hence, unemployment and the presence of
extremes of wealth and poverty is clearly a market failure. It can be argued that
some people have altruistic elements in their nature and behaviour, and are willing

to transfer some of their wealth to those who are worse off than themselves.
Altruism is said to exist when one individual’s well-being contains elements of
both the individual’s own well-being and that of others. This benevolent act
improves their standard of living. The fact that there are many charity
organisations helping to improve the lives of the poor is supporting such altruistic
redistribution. The view that voluntary giving (chapter 3, section 3.6) of one’s
possession encouraged in the Bahá’í writings supports the notion of altruistic
nature of human beings.

Marxists put forward a more left wing reason for economic redistribution. They
advocate that the market takes money from the poor by market power, and
therefore the poor are justified by taking the money back by political means and
other means such as strike.29 The Bahá’í writings denounce the exploitation of the
poor and of workers and hence justify government intervention in the market, to
redress the balance. However, strike is not an option (chapter 2, section 2.5.6).
The Bahá’í social welfare program, and the notion of profit sharing, supports the
Marxist view. The Bahá’í social welfare program discussed in this dissertation
includes elements such as providing the basic needs for all, providing work for all,
providing insurance for all, establishing special places for needy people, and the
establishing of moral and educational institutions with special regard to health and
safety.

A more philosophical view of the redistribution of wealth is put forward by John

Questions, pp. 315-320.

Rawls, which is based on justice. According to this theory, when thinking about
redistribution one should not consider where she or he is in the income
distribution. Samuel Freeman discusses the original position of John Rawls’s
social contract account of justice, ‘justice as fairness,’ set forth in A Theory of
Justice. According to Freeman,

> It is designed to be a fair and impartial point of view that
> is to be adopted in our reasoning about fundamental
> principles of justice. In taking up this point of view, we
> are to imagine ourselves in the position of free and equal
> persons who jointly agree upon and commit themselves to
> principles of social and political justice.30

Rawls views of ‘justice as fairness’ are compatible with Bahá’í understanding of
this concept. For example, Rawls contends that the most rational choice for the
parties in the original position are two principles of justice: The first guarantees
the equal basic rights and liberties needed to secure the fundamental interests of
free and equal citizens and to pursue a wide range of basic needs. The Bahá’í
writings advocate the provision of basic needs and social welfare program for all
citizens, including: providing the basic needs for all; providing work for all;
providing Insurance for all; the establishment of special places for needy people;
and the establishment of moral and educational institutions with special regard to
health and safety. The second principle provides fair equality of educational and
employment opportunities enabling all to a fair standard of living including
income and wealth. Hence, in this category wage differential is recognised as
being fair. The Bahá’í formula of wealth distribution states that from each
according to one’s ability and to each according to one’s productive contribution
to society. Consequently, wage differential exist which is based on one’s level of

\[30\] Samuel Freeman. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 1996.

education, experience, ability and talents. This, according to Rawls and according
to Bahá’í writings is fair.

To avoid the risk of extremes of wealth and poverty and maintaining a fair
standard of living, the Bahá’í writings consider government intervention as a
necessary step to remedy such unpleasant economic conditions and associated
symptoms. This is now possible through legislation and by regulating the market
economy. The degree of redistribution, that occurs in the context of the Bahá’í
writings is determined by a number of factors such as the level of earnings
capability, inheritance, education, the market structure and redistribution through
benevolence activities. We can argue that if everyone lives in the same society
with the same income distribution, then the results were straightforward: each
altruistic individual will benefit when any other such individual makes a
contribution to the poor, and so each will have an opportunity to benefit from it.
However, we are not living in such environment. Therefore, at a governmental
level redistribution of income and wealth takes place by a number of means. For
example, taxes are used to pay for public expenditure; the tax system can be
structured so that richer people pay a higher proportion of this expenditure. A
substantial part of public expenditure consists of benefits to people in need of help
from the state in the form of subsidies.

3\.4   The Bahá’í perspective on the importance of wealth
The concept of wealth (‫ ﺛﺮﻭوﺕت‬- tharvat) is difficult to define or measure because it
is mainly a stock of assets such as house, land or personal possessions and
accumulated money; therefore, it is different from income. Income is a flow and

wealth is a stock.31 If we define wealth as the abundance of valuable possessions
and assets, then it is difficult to measure because they can be appreciated or
depreciated. Commenting on Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations, and on the
difficulty with defining certain economic terms, economist Spencer Pack writes,

> Many technical economic problems trouble Adam Smith,
> much as they have troubled economists ever since. For
> example, how will one accurately measure … the wealth
> of a nation? And what determines the distribution of
> income [and wealth] among the various social classes of
> modern society?32

Pack found no evidence of how the level of wealth created in a nation via
production activities could be measured. This suggests that the main concern of
Smith was the creation of wealth and not how to measure it. Smith also did not
pay much attention to the distribution of wealth; it was David Ricardo33 (1772 –
1823), another founder of the school of classical economics, who discussed this
subject. In the Bahá’í writings the acquisition of wealth is not condemned, but
true wealth has been interpreted differently. The terminology ‘true wealth’ is used
in this research and is interpreted as the coherence between material and spiritual
well-being. For example, detachment from the material world is praised without
condemning one’s material riches.34 This may seem contradictory as normally
material wealth and attachment to it go hand-in-hand. The complexity arises when
one values material richness over and above a balanced life. The Bahá’í view is

that human beings are spiritual in nature and thus, material well-being alone
cannot guarantee human happiness. Bahá’ís are directed that they would be
happier if the spiritual aspects of their lives are fulfilled and developed alongside
the material. And for the wider society it is stated that ‘…only when material and
spiritual civilization are linked and coordinated will happiness be assured.’35

Moreover, wealth is appreciated if it is acquired legitimately through honest work,
and is spent sensibly. In the following statement Bahá’u’lláh describes the
attainment of wealth by one’s own efforts and hard work as desirable after
reaching maturity. As stated in earlier discussion, Bahá’u’lláh said, ‘Having
attained the stage of fulfilment and reached his maturity, man standeth in need of
wealth.’36 The stage of fulfilment and reaching maturity in the light of this
discussion can be interpreted as attaining a high level of human consciousness
where the acquisition of wealth becomes worthy, if achieved through appropriate
means and expended for the common good. Similarly, in the following statement
from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he describes how wealth should be acquired and how to be
spent. He said, ‘Wealth is praiseworthy in the highest degree, if it is acquired by
an individual’s own efforts and the grace of God, in commerce [‫ – ﺗﺠﺎﺭرﺕت‬tijárat],
agriculture [‫ – ﺯزﺭرﺍاﻋﺖ‬zirá‘at], art and industry [‫ – ﺻﻨﺎﻋﺖ‬siná‘at], and if it be
expended for philanthropic purposes.’ 37 According to this passage, the first
condition for acquiring wealth is that it must be earned by one’s own efforts. This
confirms the need to work and be a productive member of the community. The
second condition is that the income earned be spent on charitable and

philanthropic activities. This is an indication that the Bahá’í community is
directed towards attaining a culture of philanthropic, humanitarian and benevolent
activities.

For further analysis of wealth creation there is a need to make a distinction
between ‘means’ and ‘ends’, otherwise what is a mere instrument could become
the main goal of an individual in life. Expounding on this, the Universal House of
Justice, addressing the Bahá’í community, stresses that the acquisition of wealth
as a means for achieving higher ends such as meeting one’s basic needs,
promoting the welfare of society, and contributing to the establishment of a world
civilisation, is praiseworthy. 38 Exploring the concept of wealth and the
justification for acquiring it, the Universal House of Justice states, ‘However
constructive and noble the goal, however significant to one’s life or to the welfare
of one’s family [wealth] must not be attained through improper means.’ 39
Examples of ‘improper means’ in our present society can be the use of offshore
investment to avoid paying taxes; using child labour or paying low wages to
increase profit; unfair trade through aggressive competition; or any activities that
lead to the destruction of the environment.

\[40\] Amartya Sen also worked on more practical problem of measurement and famine, including his
study of the 1974 Bangladesh famine that concluded that the root cause of famine was political
rather than agricultural. His books include Collective Choice and Social Welfare (1970), Poverty
and Famines (1981), Choice, Welfare and Measurement (1982), Resources, Values and
Development (1984). The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, 2006,
establishing an association between ‘means’ and ‘ends’ to commodities and to a
level of ‘functioning’ in life,

Sen was concerned that the average longevity of a resident of a poor
neighborhood in New York is less than that of a resident of Bangladesh, despite
the fact that not only incomes, but real incomes, are many times higher in some
parts of New York than in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh.42 Sen’s view
helps to better understand the legitimacy of wealth on how it is obtained and how
it is spent in relation to ‘means’ and ‘ends’.

The concepts of ‘end’ and ‘means’ are also stated in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh.
Addressing Bahá’ís he said, ‘It is incumbent upon each one of you to engage in
some occupation … Hold ye fast unto the cord of means and place your trust in
God, the Provider of all means.’43 This passage appears to imply that one should
work to earn a living and that money is a ‘means’, not an ‘end’. The indication is
that our economic models cannot reduce all values to money or what is known as
‘commoditization’44 in a competitive market. Also, policies, which internalise
negative externalities, should be carefully evaluated so as not to foster attitudes of
self-satisfaction and selfishness. ‘Negative externalities’ is where the actions of an

individual or a firm have impacts on others for which they do not pay, such as
damaging roads and polluting the air by driving a car. Internalising negative
externality means that in this example car drivers are responsible to pay the cost
of road maintenance and pollution. 45 In a similar fashion it should be noted how
economic theory with its self-interest utilitarianism has reduced everything to
commodities. To avoid these difficulties, there is much guidance as to how to
weigh carefully the difference between gaining wealth in fields such as
agriculture, commerce, the arts and industry, and in obtaining it without effort or
through improper means.

Alternatively, Bahá’u’lláh describes the relationship between human station and
wealth in the following words, ‘I have created thee rich and have bountifully shed
My favour upon thee.’46 Also, he said, ‘I created thee rich, why dost thou bring
thyself down to poverty?’47 There can be several interpretations of the above two
passages, which are very similar. For instance, the main facet could be with the
moral aspect of human beings, but it could also be applied to the material
characteristics. The concept of ‘rich’ can be interpreted as both material and
spiritual richness. Patrick Barker’s interpretation is in respect of the use of all the
bounties created for humans. In his view, ‘we have been created to be rich, both
materially and spiritually, and are endowed with a nobility of the highest order.’48
Another interpretation of ‘I have created thee rich’ is in reference to human
potential and not material richness. However, changing from a condition of

poverty to prosperity, either materially or spiritually, requires a transformation. In
order to achieve human potential, including financial freedom there is a need for
effort and persistence, and one needs to persevere and reprioritise one’s thinking
so that prosperity is seen as a normal way of life. Bahá’ís are advised to ‘Put away
all covetousness and seek contentment.’ 49 However, attaining happiness and
prosperity for one who is without sufficient means can become a challenge. In this
case for pursuing progress; contentment with little or no means is not the way
forward. With regard to human potential ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, ‘Through the
restoring waters of pure intention and unselfish effort, the earth of human
potentialities will blossom with its own latent excellence and flower into
praiseworthy qualities.’ 50 Therefore, rather than focusing on one’s material
advancement only, one should aim to develop the vast inherent potentials through
unselfish acts and service to others. However, individuals must be helped to
channel these qualities towards their own development as well as for the
betterment of the wider society.

3\.5   The Bahá’í view on self-interest
A fundamental premise of Adam Smith’s economic paradigm is that we are
naturally endowed with a powerful ‘desire of bettering our condition, a desire
which, though generally calm and dispassionate, comes with us from the womb,
and never leaves us till we go into grave.’ 51 Also his famous example of
butchering tells us that, ‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer,
or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-

interest.’52 These are powerful statements supporting self-interest from the founder
of scientific economics, written in 1776.

For expounding this topic it would be useful to make a distinction between self-
interest and selfishness, although they are generally used synonymously. The
clarification depends on how we understand these terms in relation to wealth
creation and distributive justice. Self-interest is when a person is concerned with
his own well-being and engages activities that benefit himself and fulfil his own
desires, which could also affect others positively. However, a selfish person is
excessively and exclusively concerned with himself, purely seeking his own
wishes and desires, without regard for others. According to economist Michael
Parkin ‘In self-interest a choice has to be made and that choice is the best one
available for a person. Most people make most of their choices in their own self-
interest.’53 A Bahá’í view, on the other hand, would be making choices that
promote social interest rather than self-interest. These choices would lead to an
effective and efficient use of resources and distribute goods and services equitably
among members of society.

A person can wisely render many services for the benefit of others that are not
purely based on self-interest. John Stuart Mill, an advocate of utilitarianism,
argues that we should train individuals to derive the greater utility from doing
good, and conversely, disutility from doing bad. Consequently, utilitarian favour
activities with ‘altruistic self-interest’. They argue that caring for one’s own well-
being will care for someone else; or doing things for others, one would receive

some benefits as well. A commonly used saying ‘you scratch my back, and I will
scratch yours’ is an example of helping others with the expectation of getting
some benefits; it is a kind of self-interest.

What an individual considers her or his self-interest depends on what values they
hold. This can vary from one individual to another. Within a given culture, Carens
argue ‘…it may be reasonable to assume that individuals share broadly similar
notions of self-interest because people within that culture will have been
inculcated in broadly similar values.’ According to Bahá’í writings, Bahá’ís are
encouraged to adopt a culture of service to humanity.

A similar point can be made with respect to the concept of altruism. At least when
used in contrast to self-interest. Explaining the term altruism, Carens write:

…the term seems to imply an element of self-reliance, of
> foregoing something which is in one’s own interest (or
> doing something against one’s interest) for the sake of
> other people. But whether an action is altruistic or not
> depends partly on how one defines self-interest. Indeed
> some people would claim that all human action, even
> action which is apparently altruistic, is ultimately self-
> interested.54

I use the term ‘altruism’ to distinguish certain kinds of motivation and behaviours
in individuals such as preference given to others and the act of service.

Bahá’ís are encouraged to strive to be free from all the above approaches. The
Bahá’í view is closer to enlightened self-interest, which argues that the nature of
human being is altruistic and not egoistic. Persons who act to further the interests

\[54\] Joseph Carens. Equality, Moral Incentives, and the Market, p. 121.

of others ultimately serve their own interests. Human beings should strive to reach
to this level of considerate. Bahá’u’lláh deters his followers from egoistic
activities and encourages them to pursue behaviours that benefit all. He states:
‘Dissipate not the wealth of your precious lives in the pursuit of evil and corrupt
affection, nor let your endeavours be spent in promoting your personal interest ...
cling unto that which profiteth mankind.’ 55 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also condemns the
pursuit of self-interest. He states:

> Today, all the peoples of the world are indulging in self-
> interest and exert the utmost effort and endeavour to
> promote their own material interests. They are
> worshipping themselves and not the divine reality, nor the
> world of mankind. They seek diligently their own benefit
> and not the common weal. This is because they are
> captives of the world of nature and unaware of the divine
> teachings.56

In this passage ‘Abdu’l-Bahá contrasts seeking self-interest over seeking ‘the
common weal.’ Is it possible to look at ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s assertion as condemning
the excessive promotion of self-interest, rather than self-interest itself? In
weighing self-interest versus the common weal, one’s self-interest is also included
in the common weal. If one makes efforts so that one’s community is prosperous,
it would ensure one’s own prosperity. But the challenge with this view and this
way of thinking is that it is much easier to think of what is good for one’s own self
than to understand what is best globally and what is good for others. One
suggestion given here is to start with children, raising and educating children with
moral principles to be considerate, thoughtfulness, and caring. These principles
then need to be practiced by families rather than simply state them.

\[56\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 103.

A number of Bahá’í scholars have commented on the cause and effect of self-
interest. For example, Graham’s view is that ‘self-interest is the single element
most destructive to well-being [and] lacking … the moral backbone in society to
construct, guide and set its parameters.’ 57 F. Rassekh goes even further
considering ‘Self-interest as indifference to the welfare of other individuals, [even
though he acknowledges that] although this attitude may not injure other people, it
does nothing to alleviate their problems.’58 Graham and Rassekh’s argument is
based on absence of moral backbone and altruistic behaviour in the society.
However, the difficulty is, how can we include altruistic behaviour such as
fairness and compassion in the economic diagrams? It is argued that economics
cannot effectively integrate moral principles such as equity and justice into its
utility curves. An influential voice in such an argument was that of William S.
Jevons, who in the Theory of Political Economy was moved to declare:
‘Economics, if it is to be a science at all, must be a mathematical science.59
However, from a mathematical science perspective, moral values are extruded.
Galbraith writes, ‘The detachment and the justifying commitment to scientific
validity as opposed to social concern are especially influential in our own time.’60
Hence, when considering scientific validity economists are not concerned with
justice and other moral issues. This leaves no room for actual expansion of
consciousness and the realizations of other forms of being. The Universal House
of Justice describe the metaphor of ‘body’ used in the Bahá’í writings; ‘Regard

the world as the human body’61 as follows:

> In the human body, every cell, every organ, every nerve

> of mankind.62

The expansion of consciousness, together with the above metaphor of the ‘body’
may point towards creating more systemic models rather than ones based on
individual aggregates.

A more effective description of self-interest in the Bahá’í literatures is in relation
to human nature. The Bahá’í teachings emphasise the duality of human nature.
According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, humans possess a spiritual or higher nature, and a
material or lower nature. He said, ‘In one he approaches God, in the other he lives
for the world alone.’63 According to him ‘The impulse of self-interest belongs to
the lower nature of human beings.’64 The virtue of benevolence belongs to the
higher nature of human beings and is a source of human perfection and true
happiness. In other words true happiness is associated with the higher nature, and
material or physical happiness is related to the lower nature of human being. John
Stuart Mill presents similar views. He argues that intellectual and moral pleasures
(higher pleasures) are superior to more physical forms of pleasure (lower
pleasures).65

But human beings are able to overcome their own self-desires to promote the
common good. F. Rassekh argues that such pronouncements against the pursuit of
self-interest and self-love, however, do not constitute a rejection of the market
economy.66 For example, Bahá’u’lláh allows charging interest on financial loans,
which is a characteristic of the market economy. Also, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá considers
commerce to be one of the ‘vital agencies which would constitute an immediate
remedy for society’s chronic ills.’ 67 Moreover, he states, ‘Wealth is most
commendable, provided the entire population is wealthy.’68 Commenting on the
writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Rassekh maintains the view that ‘Indeed by
encouraging commercial activities, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá endorses a fundamental tenet of
the market system that commercial pursuits are beneficial to society.’69 However,
as Shoghi Effendi stated, the Bahá’í faith rejects the doctrine of laissez faire,
which is the extreme version of a free market economy.70

Nader Saeidi relates the topic of human nature, self-interest and selfishness to the
issue of ‘order’, associating it with the writings of the political theorist of the
seventeenth century Thomas Hobbes (1588—1679). The question posed by
Hobbes is normally called the Hobbesian problem of ‘order’. In his famous book,
Leviathan, Hobbes investigated the basis of order in society. According to
Hobbes, human beings are naturally selfish, aggressive, concerned with the

\[70\] Shoghi Effendi states: ‘In the Bahá’í economic system of the future, private ownership will be
retained, but will be controlled, regulated, and even restricted. Complete socialization is not only
impossible but most unjust, and in this the Cause is in fundamental disagreement with the extreme
socialists and communists. It cannot also agree with the other extreme tendency represented by the
“Laissez faire” or individualistic school of economics, which became very popular in the late
eighteenth century, by the so-called democratic countries.’ (Letter dated 25 August 1939).

pursuit of their own interests, and yet rational. Hobbes argued that in the state of
nature, humans will use any means to get what they want, and they will not refrain
from stealing or murder. This view contradicts earlier notion that humans are
fundamentally altruistic. It is due to this lower nature that according to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá ‘…he expresses untruth, cruelty and injustice…’71 Hobbes’ solution to the
problem of order is rooted in his definition of human nature. Expounding on
Hobbes’ view, Saeidi writes:

Saeidi’s argument in analysing Hobbes’ view is that the Hobbesian solution to the
problem of order was not sufficient and considers the notion of ‘order’ from a

Bahá’í perspective:

Therefore, Bahá’u’lláh’s concept of order, according to Saeidi, is directly opposed
to the western enlightenment’s concept of order. For the latter, human reason and
selfish orientation guarantee social order, and do not consider a need for religion
and divine guidance in human life. Bahá’u’lláh, conversely, regards the question
of order as a proof of the need for religion and divine revelation in human history.

3\.6    Voluntary versus compulsory giving of one’s income and wealth
A Bahá’í moral principle about distributive justice is that of voluntary sharing of
one’s income and wealth. Bahá’u’lláh states, ‘To give and to be generous are
attributes of Mine; well is it with him that adorneth himself with My virtues.’74
The founder of this faith has given great responsibility to the wealthy to take care
of the poor. However, the rich should voluntarily carry out such responsibility for
human prosperity and well-being because they have greater resources. The
benevolent behaviours of compassion and generosity are examples of virtues
required for an effective voluntary sharing. This approach is considered to be
highly effective because it is done freely as a matter of choice rather than being
forced to give. Confirming this, Bahá’u’lláh states ‘The beginning of

\[73\] Saeidi. ‘An Introduction to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s The Secret of Divine Civilisation, Converging
Realities,’ 2000.

\[74\] Bahá’u’lláh. Hidden Words, (from Persian translation), no. 49.

magnanimity is when man expendeth his wealth on himself, on his family and on
the poor among his brethren in the faith.’75 And ‘Abdu’l-Bahá maintains that ‘The
harvest of force is turmoil and the ruin of the social order.’ 76 By reflecting upon
the above two passages, it would appear that the spiritual laws of prosperity not
only deal with receiving but also with giving. It is stated that ‘It will not be
possible in the future for men to amass great fortunes by the labours of others.’77
Whether this is because in the future humanity will become morally more
conscious or the government regulations become more effective for creating
distributive justice, it is clear that at this time there is greater material prosperity
in those countries with an effective regulation of wealth redistribution.

On one hand, Bahá’u’lláh has given the responsibility to the wealthy to take care
of the poor. On the other hand, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá comments that the poor should not
force the rich people to share their wealth. He said, ‘…sharing is a personally
chosen righteous act: That is, the rich should extend assistance to the poor, they
should expend their substance for the poor, but of their own free will, and not
because the poor have gained this end by force.’ 78 Yet this may become a
challenge for both groups. It can be a challenge for the rich to share a portion of
their wealth voluntarily with those who are not known to them. Also, it is a
challenge for the poor not to expect, or try to gain this by force. The process
leading to distributive justice morally requires a great deal of faith and obedience
to the teachings of the faith. It is in this way that the Bahá’í community can

\[77\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Cited in Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, p. 145.

\[78\] Ibid.

function in a more secure and orderly manner. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá clarifies this point by
advising Bahá’ís that this will be a gradual process in the Bahá’í community. He
said, ‘[the rich] will come to this gradually, naturally, by their own volition.’79
There are evidences in the Bahá’í community that this gradual process is taking
place. For example, the entire expenses of the activities of the Bahá’í community
at a global level are supported and paid for by Bahá’ís only. Another condition put
forward by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the rich to share their wealth willingly is for them to
become more sensitive and show compassion towards others. He said: ‘The time
will come in the near future when humanity will become so much more sensitive
than at present that the man of great wealth will not enjoy his luxury, in
comparison with the deploring poverty about him.’80 At the same time, voluntary
giving in the form of ‘in-kind’ or ‘development projects’ is well-known today.

However, in the analysis of this subject, the principle of voluntary giving can be
challenged on the basis of at least two issues. Voluntary giving may not
necessarily eliminate poverty. The reason is that such voluntary giving may
provide a reason for some people never to work, and may create a culture of
dependency. Also, the financial aspects of a community, of a nation, and of the
world cannot be built on a system based only on voluntary giving. No country can
plan its public finances on such totally unpredictable sources of revenue.

Therefore, in the wider society the process adopted through taxation is more
practical, though it may not be an ideal one. As it is commonly practiced in the

\[79\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Cited in Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, p. 145.

\[80\] Ibid., Star of the West, ‘The Economic Teaching of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,’ vol. viii, no. 1, 21 March
1917, p. 6.

wider society, the method of distributive justice is mainly through government
intervention through regulatory bodies for using taxation and different types of
subsidies.81 The effectiveness, however, depends on how the level of corruption
and misuse of financial resources either in the public or private sectors affect a
country, or how the distributive justice affects the economic growth of a country.

Another argument against voluntary giving is that humans are driven by instincts
to survive and satisfy their base desires. Hence, there is not a simple correlation
between economic growth and voluntary giving. For example, if we focus on
selfishness then the idea of voluntary giving appears as a mirage, impractical and
unrealistic. Also, voluntary giving in the form of charity often targets the
symptoms rather than cause of a problem, and may only remedy problems such as
the eradication of poverty temporarily. The Bahá'í writings disagree with the
notion that humans only possess the lower nature and selfish attitudes; rather it is
firmly believed that this aspect of human nature can be changed gradually through
proper education.

A discussion of the relationship between the voluntary distribution of wealth and
the main goal of the Bahá’í faith, unity, is worthwhile here. It can be said that
there is a direct relationship between unity and voluntary giving. As discussed
earlier, the acquisition of wealth is acceptable to the extent that it serves as a
means for achieving higher ends. The ultimate goal for a Bahá’í is the
achievement of unity of humankind. For example, how can one enjoy one’s
wealth while more than a billion people live in absolute poverty? In the following

\[81\] For government policies of taxation and subsidy see: Sloman. Economics, pp. 309-313.

statement ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, envisions that in the future ‘…the rich shall most
willingly extend assistance to the poor.’82 But why is such a benevolent and
praiseworthy activity envisioned for the future? The presumption is that it is a
challenge at the present time for the Bahá’í community and the wider society.
Today many of the rich share their wealth by being forced to give through taxes
and try to evade this as much as they can. However, as observed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
‘The man of great wealth … will be forced, for his own happiness, to expend his
wealth to procure better conditions for the community in which he lives.’ 83
Hence, this view from the Bahá’í writings indicates that in the future as more
people advance spiritually and become conscious of the needs of others, then ‘the
social function of wealth’84 is understood and benevolent activities are carried out
willingly and with joy. In addition, in the Bahá’í writings wealth is commendable,
provided the entire population is wealthy. Consequently, by considering the above
statements together, one notes that there is an optimistic view that the wider
society will benefit from practicing the principle of voluntary sharing.

How is taxation as a compulsory policy different from the voluntary sharing of
one’s possessions? It is vital to comment that all the activities of the Bahá’í
community worldwide are carried out only through the monetary contribution of
individual Bahá’ís. This allows the Bahá’í community to be financially self-
supported and self-sustained. The concept of voluntary giving is an indication that
a community is advancing spiritually. However, on a national scale the system of
taxation and other government regulations may be more practical. This means it is

\[84\] Shoghi Effendi. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, note 38.

too risky for a government to be dependent on voluntary contribution for the
funds needed to spend on important public services.

Comparing voluntary contribution with taxation, a number of Bahá’í scholars
have considered the difference being in the presence or absence of the spiritual
values of generosity and compassion. The indication is that taxation is of lower
spiritual importance while voluntary contribution of wealth as a high spiritual
value. For example, Huddleston writes ‘voluntary action in the social interest
would be a stronger force than the instruction and law of government.’85 Graham
makes an overall assertion of the effects voluntary giving would have on
economics and believes that ‘the economic effect of voluntary giving, as opposed
to involuntary giving such as taxation, is profound.86 The distinguishing aspect of
voluntary giving certainly emphasises an attitude of generosity, which is in
contrast with that of an imposed law for the sharing of wealth.

3\.7       Specific Bahá’í principles on wealth redistribution
Studying the Bahá’í primary literatures, a number of principles are suggested for
redistribution of income and wealth. Some of these principles directly affect
Bahá’ís and the Bahá’í community, and some are for the wider society. Selected
teachings are described and discussed in this part.

3\.7.1       Government participation
Alongside the role of individuals in voluntary giving, and the role of Bahá’í

\[85\] Huddleston. The Search for a Just Society, p. 241.

institutions in coordinating wealth redistribution in the community, the Bahá’í
literatures emphasise the important role of government in distributive justice, and
in provision of the basic needs for all citizens. Adam Smith is often cited as
arguing for the free market economy. His basic argument is that firms in the
pursuit of profits do what is best for themselves, which would also be best for the
world. In other words, the market is self-correcting and not in need of government
interference. He believed that the market reaches ‘equilibrium automatically,’ 87
when the opposing forces of supply and demand balance each other. In other
words, when the price balances the purchasing power of buyers and sellers.
However, since the Smith’s view of a system of ‘free market economy,’ more
research has been done about the limitations of such an economic system.
Critiques of the free market economy argue that the market does not lead to what
is the best for consumers and producers, suggesting the need for participation of
government in regulating the market. Joseph Stiglitz, the 2001 Noble Prize
Laureate in economic science, has mentioned one specific reason for the need for
government involvement in the market, concerning the issue of negative
externalities:

> Whenever there are ‘externalities’—where the actions of
> an individual have impacts on others for which they do not
> pay, or for which they are not compensated—markets will
> not work well. Some of the important instances have long
> understood environmental externalities. Markets, by
> themselves, produce too much pollution. Markets, by
> themselves, also produce too little basic research. The
> government was responsible for financing most of the

If we define negative externality such as pollution as the third party effect as a
situation where the cost of a firm’s action to society exceeds the firm’s private
cost, then Stiglitz suggests that government intervention is required to internalise
such a cost. In other words, society should not be suffering because of the action
of a firm, which is for the purpose of profit maximisation. Stiglitz’s main
argument here is about the effect of negative externalities created by firms, the
cost of which is transferred to the whole society. These costs need to be
internalised and be paid for by the firm. This is a classic example of market
failure, which needs government participation. Other examples of market failure
include unemployment, monopoly power, negative externality, increasing the gap
between the rich and the poor, and wastage of resources either by consumers or by
producers. Therefore, the proponents of a free market economy argue that the idea
that the market is able to balance the economy, has failed.

Stiglitz’s view is in agreement with Bahá’í writings, which support government
participation for coordinating and regulating market activities. Bahá’u’lláh’s

\[88\] Stiglitz. Making Globalisation Work, London: Penguin Books, 2006. p. 45.

pronouncement is that ‘…a republican government profits all the people,’89 and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá considers the role of government crucial in ensuring the happiness
and well-being of the citizens of a country through ‘establishing just legislation
and economics in order that all humanity may enjoy a full measure of welfare and
privilege; but this will always be according to legal protection and procedure.’90 In
1936 Shoghi Effendi suggested that government participation is essential for
regulating, coordinating and even restricting market activities.91 Such participation
would allow the government’s performance in relation to distributive justice to be
judged not only by economic growth rates but also by the effect of policies on
social welfare, such as protecting the environment, creating employment,
providing health and education and improving transport facilities. This way, the
role of government is not limited to collecting tax and providing subsidies but
extends to introducing plans to deliver acceptable living standards for all citizens.
Whenever there is government participation there is also a likelihood of
government failure and the subsequent creation of negative externality. This, of
course, depends on the government’s availability of resources to tackle the
existing challenges in the market. The founder of this faith considers excessive
expenditures on armaments as unnecessary and a type of government failure. For
example, Bahá’u’lláh warned the kings and rulers of the world, saying, ‘We see
you increasing every year your expenditures, and laying the burden thereof on
your subjects. This, verily, is wholly and grossly unjust.’92 Conversely, in some
cases a government may provide too many benefits, which may cause wastage or

result in a misallocation of resources (e.g. generous welfare programs by some
governments). This approach may create a culture of dependency in society.
According to the Bahá’í writings, on the one hand work is a spiritual obligation
and Bahá’ís are encouraged to be productive members of the society; and on the
other hand, the Bahá’í institutions and governments are given the responsibility to
prepare individuals in skills learning in the first instance, and to help the poor only
when necessary, rather than providing ample universal benefits. John
Huddleston’s view is that ‘The Bahá’í system of government would also be
responsible for providing other social services (such as social security or health
services) which would be available equally for all and which would therefore
contribute to the lessening of differences in wealth.’93 On the issue of misusing
resources Huddleston believes that ‘Bahá’í standards of morality, including
honesty and the injunction against begging, should ensure the ‘abuses’ of social
welfare programmes would be minimal.’94 Similarly, there will be less need for
government intervention as the concept of ‘work as worship’ is practiced in the
wider society, leading to lower levels of unemployment, which is one of the
government’s macroeconomic objectives. Likewise, the concept of voluntary
sharing would lead to a more equitable distribution of income and wealth, hence
achieving some of the microeconomic objectives of government, such as price
stability and a welfare program.

3\.7.2       The principle of equity
In the sustainability model, when discussing distributive justice from the Bahá’í

\[93\] Huddleston. The Search for a Just Society, p. 439.

\[94\] Ibid.

perspective equity is preferred to equality. It is argued that absolute equality is
neither possible, nor practical or justified. However, equality of opportunity is
suggested, to ensure that the opportunity for access to material and social
resources is justly and fairly distributed. The Bahá’í writings state that ‘It is the
duty of those who are in charge of the organization of society to give every
individual the opportunity of acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of
profession, and also the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and
for the sake of earning the means of his livelihood.’95 This writing indicates that
individual talents and abilities are different and hence their economic contribution
to society varies; however, justness of opportunity should be there for all.

In economic discipline, however, social justice is about equity rather than
equality. It can be argued that the goal of social justice is for people to be equal.
The Bahá’í belief is that we are all equal, not because we are the same but because
we are all created by God. The notion of ‘all created in the image of God’
suggests that each person has certain rights granted by God. These rights include
the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The application of ‘all
created in the image of God’ can be interpreted as the recognition of equality in
the social and economic equation. The Bahá’í writing makes it clear that each
person is unique, but human beings are not the same. The hallmark is ‘unity in
diversity.’ Hence, equality and equity are very different. Equity assumes the
diverse, unique individuality of each person. While people are different, they are
to be treated equally before the law. In the Bahá’í view, the diversity of people is
a cause for celebration. The concept of equity indicates that there should be wage

\[95\] Shoghi Effendi. Directives from the Guardian, p. 74.

differentials. In this model, each person receives according to his or her economic
contribution to society and its needs. This seems to be fair because each individual
has different talents and education and economic capability, and hence the
productive contribution of each person to society varies. From this perspective
each person is different. The model, however, recognizes that minimum standards
of living must be provided for all, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote, ‘The readjustment of the
economic laws for the livelihood of man … in order that all humanity may live in
the greatest happiness according to their respective degrees.’96 This passage
indicates the need for active participation of government in the economy.

3\.7.3      Profit sharing
For a social enterprise to succeed it will need to have a system of incentives to
reward desirable behaviour. One such system suggested in the Bahá’í writings is
profit sharing (‫ ﺷﺮﮐﺖ ﺩدﺭر ﻣﻨﺎﻓﻊ ﻓﺒﺮﻳﯾﮏ‬- shirkat dar manáfi‘-i-fibrik). Profit sharing is
also supported as an effective method for wealth redistribution. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
states, ‘Profit sharing is recommended as a solution to one form of economic
problems.’ 97 Profit sharing refers to when a share of the net profit of the
organisation is given to workers. This share would be separate from the normal
wage employees receive. In most organisations that apply this technique, the
amount shared is determined either by an established formula or entirely at the
discretion of the management or owners, based on a set of objectives. The
percentage of profit shared among the workers should be sufficient to reward
them, otherwise it may not create adequate incentive.

\[96\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 170.

\[97\] Shoghi Effendi. Directives from the Guardian, p. 19.

Material incentives are those that reward desirable behaviour with a claim over
material goods, or through some form of monetary payment. In a competitive
market economy, material incentives are related to supply and demand. Shortage
of products leads to an increase in prices; in which case producers gain extra
monetary benefits. If demand is low or there is excess supply, then consumers are
in a position to benefit from lower prices, which would be an incentive for
consumers. Stephen Gardner argues that systems of material incentives become
more complicated in the presence of ‘principle-agent relationships.’ 98 This
requires the most desirable behaviour from the agents to offer an incentive to
workers. A system of profit sharing may encourage the agents to respond more
appropriately to market signals for providing additional incentives to workers.

Profit sharing generates several benefits to an organisation, including creating
opportunities for workers to participate in decision-making, improving working
conditions, providing better prospects for growth and development of the
organisation, and creating in workers a sense of belonging to the organisation. The
anticipation is that such a technique would remove the culture of ‘them’ and ‘us’,
strengthen people’s loyalty to the firm and encourage workers to work more
effectively by not wasting the resources of the business as a result increasing the
success of the organisation. Workers will use their skills and talents to their full
potential, thereby increasing the level of production. Consequently, profit sharing
can create an environment in which people will enjoy their work.

\[98\] Stephen Gardner. Comparative Economic Systems, 2nd ed., New York: Dryden Press, 1998, p.

\[10\] 149

Profit sharing has a number of applications. As workers receive a portion of the
profit, there will not be an incentive for strike. An industrial strike would be very
costly even for a limited number of days. Depending on the nature of the demand
by the workers, strike may impact heavily on customers, workers and the industry.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá suggests that the main reasons for strike are the greed and rapacity
of the factory owners and the intransigence of the workers. 99 Such extreme greed
in manufacturers leads to a small number of individuals collecting massive
fortunes, while the greater number remains deprived. One solution to this problem
suggested by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is profit sharing: ‘Laws and regulations should be
established which would permit the workmen to receive from the factory owner
their wages and a share in the fourth or the fifth part of the profits, according to
the capacity of the factory.’100 This percentage seems to be high compared to what
is customary currently in organisations applying this principle. Once profit
sharing is in operation ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, ‘The owner of the factory will no
longer put aside daily a treasure which he has absolutely no need of … And the
workmen and artisans will no longer be in the greatest misery and want; they will
no longer be submitted to the worst privations at the end of their life.’ 101
Companies with an excessive surplus of revenue can redistribute a portion of their
accumulated profit in the form of profit sharing and a part of it for improving
working conditions, both of which will assist employees as well as the company
to operate more effectively.

\[99\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions, p. 315.

\[100\] Ibid., p. 274.

\[101\] Ibid., p. 275.

The motivation and justification of adopting profit sharing varies from the
standpoint of the employer and that of the employee. The employers would feel
that it is their moral duty to share their prosperity and wealth with their
employees, the people who helped them succeed. An effective profit sharing
requires employers to have good intentions and not to expect to be rewarded for
sharing the profit. Clearly the main rationale for adopting profit sharing is its
benefits to the whole of the community. The justification for implementing profit
sharing according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is that ‘... if it be right for a capitalist to
possess a large fortune, it is equally just that his workman should have a sufficient
means of existence.’102 Consequently, the workforce would consider profit sharing
as a form of security for their livelihood; hence it can be an incentive to work
harder. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, ‘…laws must be enacted that would enable [the
factory owners] to make reasonable profits and the [workers] to be provided with
the present necessities and their future needs...’103 Another effect of practicing
profit sharing is to bring about greater harmony between employers and
employees. Such harmonious relationships among the workforce cause them to
apply their abilities and focus their thoughts on achieving the objectives of the
firm. Another justification for a profit sharing scheme is that distributing a portion
of the profit generated by the entire workforce would act as a positive feedback to
them, which would, in turn, encourage them to do even better. The argument also
can be presented that profit sharing is not a gift from employer to employees. The
employees know that the bonus they receive in the form of profit sharing is a
payment for a bigger responsibility they have accepted. It is because employees

\[102\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Paris Talks, pp. 158-159.

\[103\] Ibid., Some Answered Questions, p. 318.

have added an economic value to the business and created a better image for the
company and therefore they are entitled to an additional payment. Therefore,
employees consider profit sharing not as a gift, but the result of a job well done.
Nevertheless, from a Bahá’í perspective, for a Bahá’í, work is considered as
worship and must be done well, with or without profit sharing.

Despite the above justification and benefits of profit sharing for both employees
and employers, the idea is not without consequences and can be challenged in a
number of ways. The effects of profit sharing to motivate workers to increase
productivity, is more of a short-term phenomenon. In the long run, productivity
plateaus as workers get used to this extra income, unless there is an increase in the
level of profit sharing. But increasing the level of profit sharing may not be in the
interest of the business and it may also cause a negative reaction from the
shareholders, towards whom the business has a responsibility. Another difficulty
with profit sharing is that it is not fair to pay the same percentage of profit to all
workers with different talents, qualifications, and skills. In other words, it is not
fair to pay the same amount of bonuses, for example, to one who is extremely
motivated and hard working and to one whose motivation and work rate is
comparatively low. The alternative suggestion is to ‘pay according to
performance’, in the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘…each in his function according to
ability but with justness of opportunity for all.’104 The Bahá’í concept of ‘work as
worship’ can have a positive impact on workers’ performance, which may lead to
better pay. However, the two principles of ‘work as worship’ (see chapter 2,
section 2.4) and ‘profit sharing’ can work independently from each other. Both

\[104\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 216.

principles affect the lives of workers positively, but in a different way. The
principle of profit sharing is a positive gesture from the employer to the workers,
giving them a portion of the firm’s profit for their loyalty. The great success of
profit sharing and its increasing acceptance in the modern industrial age is not
only due to its monetary benefits. The act of profit sharing will encourage workers
to improve their work, giving them a sense of personal investment in their work
and allowing them to participate in decision-making.

3\.7.4   Progressive income tax
The Bahá’í faith supports the notion of progressive income tax as another method
of wealth redistribution and a way of reducing extremes of wealth and poverty in
the wider society. Progressive tax is defined as ‘A tax whose average rate with
respect to income rises as income rises.’105 In other words, the tax rate increases
with income, therefore the higher-income group pay a higher proportion of tax
than the lower-income group. In this research the term progressive rather than
graduated income tax is considered because it is always advancing upwards,
whereas graduated tax may go up or down. Shoghi Effendi writes: ‘…the income
tax, according to the Bahá’í teachings, mounts at quite a steep rate so that great
sums of money would be very heavily taxed.’106 This kind of tax system offers
one of the most straightforward ways of achieving equitable distribution of
income and wealth by marginally redistributing income from top to bottom. The
economic rational for progressive income tax is related to the two economic

\[105\] Sloman. Economics, p. 279. (The other two tax systems commonly known are: Regressive tax,
defined as ‘A tax whose average rate with respect to income falls as income rises.’ And
proportional tax defined as ‘A tax whose average rate with respect to income stays the same as
income rises.’)

\[106\] Shoghi Effendi. Letter dated11 February 1944, quoted in True Foundation of All Economics, p.

\[144\] 153

concepts of ‘Marginal Propensity to Consume’107, which is ‘the fraction of a
change in disposable income that is consumed,’ 108 and Marginal Diminishing
Return, which states the more money a person spends on an item, the less
satisfaction is obtained from the last unit of the money spent. 109 The larger the
income earned, the higher the tax bill paid. Hence, the justification for this method
is that a relatively limited level of income should be sufficient to lift every one
above a convincing poverty line. This type of tax is now universally accepted as a
fair and justified method of taxation and is practised by most governments to raise
revenue for their expenditures. Ideally, for an effective performance, the tax
system and good governance should go hand in hand.

In the following statement, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains the working of progressive
income tax:

> Each person in the community whose need is equal to his
> individual producing capacity shall be exempt from
> taxation. But if his income is greater than his needs, he
> must pay a tax until an adjustment is effected. That is to
> say, a man’s capacity for production and his needs will be
> equalized and reconciled through taxation. If his
> production exceeds, he will pay a tax; if his necessities
> exceed his production, he shall receive an amount
> sufficient to equalise or adjust. Therefore, taxation will be
> proportionate to capacity and production, and there will be
> no poor in the community.110

It is clear from this passage that if a person’s income exceeds his expenditure, a
tax is levied, and the proportion of tax paid depends on the level of income.

\[107\] Michael Parkin, Melanie Powell, and Kent Matthews. Economics, 4th ed., London: Pearson
Education publication, 2012, p. 640.

\[108\] Ibid.

\[109\] See Parkin, p. 641.

\[110\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 217.

However, a person is exempted from paying tax if his expenditure is greater than
his income, in which case financial assistance will be provided. The future
institutions and experts in charge of this matter will decide how this would be
organised.

The Bahá’í writings emphasise that accumulating wealth will be regulated and
controlled by establishing laws. Through progressive income tax, help to the poor
is ensured, and the more highly paid individuals will not accumulate excessive
riches. Speaking on this subject, the vision of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for an ideal society in
the future is that ‘… the laws of the community will be so framed and enacted that
it will not be possible for a few to be millionaires and many destitute.’111 However,
a combination of government tax and spiritual principles (justice, honesty,
compassion, truthfulness, generosity, unconditional love for humanity) lead to a
more equitable distribution of income and wealth, and possibly a more balanced
life style in society.

A classic problem or view for the imposition of any tax is that it has a disincentive
effect on effort and initiative. But, what is the Bahá’í position towards such
views? In the context of the Bahá’í stand towards paying tax, three basic
principles should be considered. First, although people have the right to
accumulate wealth and own property, the Bahá’í writings encourage the rich to
care for the poor and needy and share their wealth for the betterment of the
community. It is stated that ‘They who are possessed of riches, however, must

\[111\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 216.

have the utmost regard for the poor.’112 Second, the Bahá’í way of life is that able
people should become a productive unit of society; it is stated that ‘…all must be
producers.’113 So, irrespective of the level of taxation, all must be economically
active. Third, as is discussed earlier, for a Bahá’í, work done in a spirit of service
is considered as a form of worship. Therefore, the imposition of tax will not be a
barrier to work and service in the community, nor it will create disincentive in a
person.

The intention of progressive income tax is not to achieve complete economic
equality, but to enable a government to provide an adequate welfare program and
security and moderate comfort for all its citizens. Since the Bahá’í writings
consider extremes of wealth and poverty as life-threatening and a severe
economic problem, the function of progressive income tax is to improve the
standards of living of lower income groups by taxing the top income earners at
higher rates in order to reduce the level of inequality. Alternatively, a government
may increase economic well-being by increasing social welfare spending on
programs that provide direct services to those who can otherwise not afford to
fulfil their basic human needs such as food, shelter, and medical care. These
programs alleviate the suffering of the poor and lead to a partial narrowing of the
gap between rich and poor.

3\.7.5       The law of inheritance
The law of inheritance is another Bahá’í principle for attaining distributive justice.

\[112\] Bahá’u’lláh. Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 202.

\[113\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 217.

This is another method by which the Bahá’í writings ensure the prosperity of the
community and the wider society, rather than a minority group. The Bahá’í
writings advocate a tax to be levied on inheritance: ‘…the greater the sum
inherited, the higher the tax will be.’114 This may become another source of
revenue for government spending on the wider society.

In his Book of Laws, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh formulates the law of
inheritance and divides the inheritance into seven categories, if no Will is
prepared. ‘We have divided inheritance into seven categories: to the children, We
have allotted nine parts comprising five hundred and forty shares; to the wife,
eight parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares; to the father, seven parts
comprising four hundred and twenty shares; to the mother, six parts comprising
three hundred and sixty shares; to the brothers, five parts or three hundred shares;
to the sisters, four parts or two hundred and forty shares; and to the teachers, three
parts or one hundred and eighty shares.’115 Shoghi Effendi has clarified a number
of issues concerning the law of inheritance:

> In cases where there is no issue [children] the share of the
> children reverts to the House of Justice to be expended on
> orphans and widows and for whatever will profit mankind.
> [And]...Should one leave offspring but either part or all of
> the other categories of inheritors be non-existent, two
> thirds of their shares reverts to the offspring and one third
> to the House of Justice.116

Reflecting on the Bahá’í law of inheritance, a number of issues need to be
considered. First, it is important to note that Bahá’ís are encouraged to write a

\[114\] Shoghi Effendi. Letter dated 11 February 1944.

\[115\] Bahá’u’lláh. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, verse 20.

\[116\] Shoghi Effendi. Cited in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Synopsis and Codification, p. 153.

Will and are free to dispose of all their wealth as they wish. Second, female and
male children get equal shares, but there are differences between father and
mother, and brother and sister. Third, this law considers that the first preference of
the deceased would be children rather than the spouse. These differences are
associated with the role of individuals rather than the spirit of equality.

Reflecting on the significance of division of inheritance into seven groups, it is
noted that this signifies the social function of wealth. This is apparent from
several writings of the central figures of the Bahá’í faith. Shoghi Effendi exhorts
that a Bahá’í should bear in mind the social function of wealth, consequently
‘…avoiding its over-accumulation and concentration in a few individuals or
groups of individuals.’117 It is obvious from the law of inheritance that the wealth
of the deceased is not meant to stay with one individual, for instance the oldest
son, as is customary in some societies, but is to be distributed among different
groups of people. Within each of these groups the wealth will be further
distributed among individuals. In practical terms, by following this law the life of
many people will improve, which will then have an effect on the wider society.
Also, relating the notion of the social function of wealth to different categories of
the division of inheritance, it is possible to argue that the reason for giving
preference to children than to spouse is not meant for the spouse to be left without
the means to live, but that it is expected that the children should look after their
parents. Another issue of note is that not all seven categories are usually present
and, consequently, a part of the wealth is paid to the Head of the Bahá’í faith, the
Universal House of Justice, and is spent on a variety of purposes for the benefit of

\[117\] Shoghi Effendi. Cited in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Synopsis and Codification, p. 182.

the wider society. It also helps in the construction of many Bahá’í Houses of
Worship in different countries, which will be used for the purpose of serving the
whole community as well as worship. The last category of the division of
inheritance signifies the importance of education by giving a share of the wealth
to teachers. Therefore, it seems that the main focus of the founder of the faith in
division of inheritance is the application of the social function of wealth.
However, to a great extent the application of this law requires the practice of
compassion and love within the members of the family.

3\.7.6       The law of Huqúqu’lláh (the Right of God)
A unique and revolutionary spiritual principle mentioned in the Bahá’í scriptures
for the redistribution of income and wealth is the law of Huqúqu’lláh (‫)ﺣﻘﻮﻕق ﷲ‬.
‘Huqúqu’lláh’ is an Arabic word composed of two words, Huqúq (‫)ﺣﻘﻮﻕق‬, meaning
‘Rights’ and Allah (‫) ﷲ‬, meaning ‘God’. Therefore, Huqúqu’lláh means ‘the Right
of God’. Huqúqu’lláh, although a spiritual law, is subject to specific obligations
and regulations. The law states that 19% of the earnings of a Bahá'í over a certain
limit, and after all expenses have been paid belongs to God and should be paid to
the head of the faith, the Universal House of Justice. The importance of this law is
stated in the Book of the Laws - The Kitáb-i-Aqdas as follows, ‘…By this means
[the Rights of God] He hath desired to purify what ye possess and to enable you to
draw nigh unto such stations as none can comprehend save those whom God hath
willed [emphasis added].’118 According to Alí Muhammad Varqá, the Trustee of

\[118\] Bahá’u’lláh. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, verse 97.

Huqúqu’lláh119, this law ‘…constitutes the bedrock of an unprecedented spiritual
economy.’120 Although observing ‘the Right of God’ is limited to Bahá’ís, and
entrusted to the Bahá’í institutions, it is ultimately used for the betterment of the
whole society.

The application of the law of Huqúqu’lláh is to ensure the economic well-being of
the whole society. Bahá’u’lláh states, ‘…the payment of the Right of God is
conducive to prosperity, to blessing, and to honour and divine protection.’121
Therefore, if the payment of Huqúqu’lláh brings prosperity and blessings, then
Bahá’ís would try harder to fulfil those criteria. Also, the rationale is that no one
accumulates wealth without paying one’s dues to society. According to Alí
Nakhjavání 122 all the wealth belongs to God. Hence, when one works for acquiring
wealth, one must pay a portion of it to God, in this case 19% of the surplus
wealth, to be used for the benefit of all. According to Varqá, the rationale of the
law is the inception of an evolutionary process, which, in the course of ages and
centuries to come, assists everyone in adopting a moderate way of living. He
points out that the law ‘… contributes to the establishment of an equilibrium in
the socio-economic life of those who dwell on earth, thereby eliminating extreme
wealth and poverty.’123 Consequently, the rationale of the law of Huqúqu’lláh is in
its altruistic nature towards the wider society.

\[119\] The operation of the institution of ‘Huqúqu’lláh’ is under the Board of Trustees and the head
office is in Haifa, Israel. There are representatives of Huqúqu’lláh in each country to administer
the affairs of this law.

Calculating the payment of Huqúqu’lláh, the law states that ‘Should anyone
acquire one hundred mithqáls of gold, nineteen mithqáls thereof are God’s and to
be rendered unto Him.’124 The following explanation is necessary to clarify how
much of net income should be paid as Huqúqu’lláh. In this calculation, Mithqál is
used as a unit of mass:

> The basic sum on which Huqúqu’lláh is payable is
> nineteen mithqáls of gold. In other words, when money to
> the value of this sum hath been acquired, a payment of
> Huqúq falleth due. Likewise Huqúq is payable when the

It is possible to identify a number of economic benefits that individual Bahá’ís
and the whole society may receive through the application of Huqúqu’lláh. The
most important one is that Bahá’u’lláh has established a permanent and self-
regulating source of income for the Bahá’í institutions, but has based it on the
spiritual maturity of his followers. Through Huqúqu’lláh, the institutions can
carry out their responsibilities and activities, whether these are looking after the

\[124\] Bahá’u’lláh. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, verse 97.

\[125\] Ibid., note 78.

poor, the orphans, the Bahá’í holy places, carrying out humanitarian work during
disasters, or organising and coordinating different developmental projects for the
benefit of the whole society. All these activities increase the wealth of the society.
Therefore, there would be greater possibilities for community development, social
welfare and the improvement and maintenance of the infrastructure, which in turn
will affect the wider society. Likewise, the law assists individuals in learning how
to budget and control their income and expenditure, and in considering the
altruistic nature of the law of Huqúqu’lláh rather than self-interest. Commenting
on this, Bahá’í scholar Ramin Khadem describes the unique role of the law of
Huqúqu’lláh as ‘... a model for the transformation of a society centred on self to
one focused on the well-being of humanity.’ 126 In a similar statement Alí
Nakhjavání maintains that the law is ‘established to facilitate cooperation and
reciprocity among human beings.’127

In addition to its economic implications, the law of Huqúqu’lláh provides a
number of spiritual incentives to Bahá’ís. For example, it allows Bahá’ís to learn
about moral virtues such as generosity, truthfulness, detachment, sacrifice and
compassion. In practising this law, individuals would be their own trustees, as
they are not individually asked to pay Huqúqu’lláh and it is their own
responsibility to do so. Observing this law in order to purify one’s personal wealth
would also have a positive impact on future generations and one’s offspring.
Therefore, although, Huqúqu’lláh is a ‘law’, the spiritual aspect of this law
surpasses the material aspect.

Despite the spiritual and economic benefits, the law of Huqúqu’lláh may be
questioned or challenged. For example, those Bahá’ís whose income does not
reach the level to be qualified to pay the Right of God, would be deprived of
receiving blessings and divine protection, and this would not be fair, particularly
as they may never have the opportunity to reach to such a level of income. In
response to this query, I will consider the following justifications. First and the
foremost is that this law, according to Bahá’u’lláh, is ‘…to purify one’s riches and
earthly possessions.’128 Therefore, it can be argued that those who do not have
riches, do not need to purify them. Second, this law is indeed kindness from God,
as the money will be used to help the very people who are incapable of paying the
Huqúq. Bahá’u’lláh, denounces any perceived lack of love for the poor: ‘say: I
swear by God! No one is despised in the sight of the Almighty for being poor.
Rather he is exalted, if he is found to be one of them who are patient.’129 Third, if
there were still any doubts about the position of the poor in this regard,
Bahá’u’lláh further affirms that ‘those that are unable to pay will be invested with
the ornament of His forgiveness.’130 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá further clarifies:

> Know thou, moreover, that those who faithfully serve the
> All-Merciful will be enriched by Him out of His heavenly
> treasury, and that the Huqúq offering is but a test applied
> by Him unto His servants and maidservants. Thus every
> true and sincere believer will offer Huqúq to be expended
> for the relief of the poor, the disabled, the needy, and the
> orphans, and for other vital needs of the Cause of God,
> even as Christ did establish a Fund for benevolent

purposes.131

It must be noted that according to Varqá and Nakhjavání the concept of
Huqúqu’lláh is not the same as a system of taxation. Although this law is
obligatory on those whose savings exceed a minimum amount, it is only
acceptable if it is given in a spirit of joy and radiance. Although a spiritual
obligation, this law’s effectiveness depends on the spiritual maturity of the
individual. In contrast, taxation is compulsory in nature, and is imposed on
individuals. Thus, ‘the Right of God’ cannot be considered the same as taxation.
Also, the Right of God is different from other forms of donations such as
‘earmark’ or ‘general contributions’ practiced in the Bahá’í community. The
Trustee of Huqúqu’lláh has clarified this aspect of the law and explained the
differences:

> The payment of Huqúqu’lláh is based on calculations on
> one’s income, whereas contribution to the Bahá’í funds is
> left to the free wish and eagerness of the believers. The
> Right of God cannot be earmarked for some specific
> purpose. It is entirely at the disposal of Marjá-i-Amr, or
> the focal point of authority132, to which all must turn, while
> other contributions could be earmarked for other purposes,
> according to the wish of the contributor.133

Bahá’u’lláh proclaimed the application of this law in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas in 1873,
and the House of Justice announced its worldwide application in 1992. Those who
observe this law must have faith in Bahá’u’lláh. Therefore, observing the Right of
God is limited to Bahá’ís only. The education and understanding of the law and its
application is a gradual process for the Bahá’í communities throughout the world.

One of the responsibilities of the ‘institution of Huqúqu’lláh’ is the education of
Bahá’ís to better understand this law. However, even in this early period of the
development of the Bahá’í community, Khadem maintains that ‘the practice of the
law, however small in scale, is already working in the Bahá’í community.’134

3\.7.7      Contribution to the Bahá’í Fund and the law of Zakát
The concept of ‘contribution’ is introduced in the Bahá’í writings as a means of
financing Bahá’í activities, as an alternative way for channelling the redistribution
of income and wealth, and to balance standards of living in a community.
Addressing Bahá’ís, Shoghi Effendi writes: ‘... our contributions to the faith are
the surest way of lifting once and for all time the burden of hunger and misery
from mankind.’135 Also, like any other organisation, the Bahá’í community has
expenditures and requires material means to carry out its activities. These are paid
only by general participation and support of Bahá’ís. The term ‘Bahá’í Fund’ is
used in relation to the income and expenditures of Bahá’í institutions.

There are three major Funds in the Bahá'í faith. The local Fund supports the
teaching activities, consolidation and administrative work of each local Bahá'í
community. Local Funds also provide support to the National and International
Funds when capable of doing so. The national Fund supports the Bahá’í National
Spiritual Assembly to direct, stimulate and coordinate its activities throughout the
country. This Fund is a major support to the Bahá'í International Fund as well as
offering assistance in the fulfilment of overseas goals assigned by the Universal
House of Justice to each country. When needed, the national Fund also provides

\[134\] Khadem. Huqúqu'lláh News Letter, no. 4, 1996, p. 3.

\[135\] Shoghi Effendi. Letter dated 8 December 1947.

assistance to local funds. The International Fund supports many activities
throughout the Bahá'í world. Some National Spiritual Assemblies depend upon its
support. The ‘Holy Shrines,’136 the ‘Arc Buildings,’137 and other properties at the
Bahá’í World Centre, as well as all the administrative activities of the Bahá’í
World Centre, receive assistance from this fund.

According to Shoghi Effendi, a very important part of the Bahá’í administration,
which he refers to as ‘The Life Blood of the Cause of God’138, is ‘the Bahá’í
Fund’. It combines the spiritual and material strengths of individual Bahá’ís, and
tests their loyalty when it comes to parting with their money in order to advance
the community. Therefore, the Bahá’í Fund can be considered as the bedrock of
the administrative order. One of the distinguishing features of the Bahá’í faith, as
described by the Universal House of Justice, is its principle of non-acceptance of
financial contributions for its own purposes and activities from non-Bahá’ís.
Shoghi Effendi says that the Bahá’í institutions can best function and be
maintained ‘…by the support of those who are fully conscious of, and are
unreservedly submissive to, the claims inherent in the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh.’ 139 However, Shoghi Effendi explains that when non-Bahá’ís are
eager to contribute to the Bahá’í Fund, those donations can be accepted for
philanthropic and charitable purposes, such as spending on social and economic
development programs that benefit the wider society.

Bahá in Haifa.

Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre Publication, 1970, pp. 2-3.

Another important feature of the Bahá’í Fund is that the contribution is voluntary
and there is a sacred obligation for every Bahá’í to consciously give to the Fund.
The amount contributed, however, is immaterial, purely private and confidential
and there should not be any kind of compulsion attached. Shoghi Effendi
particularly stresses the strict voluntary nature of contributions to the Fund, to a
point that he considers the slightest, even indirect form of compulsion ‘… strikes
at the very root of the principle underlying the formation of the Fund ever since its
inception.’140 He also stated, ‘…it is the sacred obligation of every conscious and
faithful servant of Bahá’u’lláh who desires to see his Cause advance, to contribute
freely and generously.’141 Thus, it is clear that the amount paid is not as significant
as the spirit of giving. In this passage the word ‘freely’ needs to be emphasised, as
all eligible members of the Bahá’í community must contribute by their own free
will and not through coercion. The contribution to the Bahá’í Fund should be
according to one’s ability and means.

Bahá’u’lláh has accepted the Islamic law of Zakát as another source for wealth
redistribution. The word Zakát means both purification and growth. This is one of
the basic principles of Islam and the idea is that wealthy Muslims should put aside
2\.5% of their wealth for helping the poor and needy.142 The Islamic belief is that
the act of giving Zakát purifies one’s wealth to gain God’s blessing and to make it
grow in goodness. The principle states that all things belong to God, and wealth is

therefore, held by human beings in trust. The Holy Qur’an states, ‘That I shall
ordain for those who have God-consciousness and give their Zakát and those who
believe in Our Signs.’143  But what is the application of the law of Zakát in the
Bahá’í community? Nakhjavání’s view is that ‘…at this stage of the development
of the Bahá’í community the law of Zakát, and the principle of contribution to the
Bahá’í Fund are merged until the Universal House of Justice in the future make
alternate decision about its application.’144

3\.8   The application of Bahá’í teachings on wealth redistribution
A number of Bahá’í scholars have expressed their views concerning the
application of Bahá’í teachings on wealth accumulation and redistribution.
Graham’s view is that any discussion of the application of Bahá’í teachings on
economics would best occurs within the context of a Bahá’í commonwealth (for
Bahá’í Commonwealth see chapter 5, section 5).145 John Huddleston makes a
similar argument that the Bahá’í views on economics acquire real meaning only
when considered in the context of a Bahá’í civilisation. 146 The principle of
‘progressive taxation,’ which is accepted in the Bahá’í literatures as a suitable
method for wealth redistribution, is now widely established and put into practice
by most governments in the world. The principle of ‘profit sharing’ is growing in
recognition and is practised by a number of organisations. Many of the Bahá’í
spiritual teachings on wealth redistribution are currently practised within the
Bahá’í community. However, no data is available concerning the extent to which

each one is practised. The important role of Bahá’í institutions in the process of
educating the community towards better understanding of the meaning of wealth
and the significance of spiritual principles on distributive justice cannot be
overlooked. The institutions play an important part in channelling the application
of Bahá’í teachings on wealth redistribution and understanding the concept of
wealth in relation to purpose of life for a Bahá’í.

The responsibility for promoting and establishing economic justice belongs to
both individual and the society. Individuals have the responsibility to do their part
by making ethical decisions, such as having a moderate lifestyle or living a more
simple life. At the same time, governments also have a responsibility to devise
policies to ensure that all people have the adequate education and training to earn
a living and that there are suitable employments and opportunities for them. The
Bahá’í writings state,

> It is the duty of those who are in charge of the
> organization of society to give every individual the
> opportunity of acquiring the necessary talent in some kind
> of profession, and also the means of utilizing such a talent,
> both for its own sake and for the sake of earning the means
> of his livelihood.147

Although the laws on the redistribution of wealth are not enforced on individual
members of the Bahá’í community, their impact on raising the necessary funds for
improving the well-being of the Bahá’í community and the wider society cannot
be underestimated. Emphasising the practicality of these laws, Khadem maintains
that ‘… however small the scale of these teachings, the practice of these laws by
the adherents of the Bahá’í faith has already amply demonstrated that this model

\[147\] Shoghi Effendi. Directives from the Guardian, p. 74.

works.’ 148 The fact that the Bahá’í community worldwide is self-supported
financially and no funds are accepted from non-Bahá’ís149, including individuals,
organisations, or governments, shows that the law of Huqúqu’lláh and principles
of contribution to the Bahá’í fund are working within the Bahá’í community in a
global scale.

3\.9    Chapter conclusion
This chapter explored the two foremost and interrelated factors of an unstable
economy, which according to Bahá’í writings are economic injustice and
extremes of wealth and poverty. The research examined the relationship between
wealth redistribution and well-being as a fundamental requirement for
establishing order in society. Distinctions were made between views on self-
interest and selfishness. The Bahá’í literatures dismiss both views. A person with
an attitude of self-interest does not like to share resources with others. Self-
interest may lead to the accumulation of wealth, which is against the spirit of
distributive justice and the growth and prosperity of the entire community. A
number of principles dealing with distributive justice were identified and
discussed, including ‘the law of inheritance’ and ‘the law of Huqúqu’lláh’ and the
concept of ‘voluntary sharing’ and ‘contribution’ to the Bahá’í fund. The role of
government is also crucial in distributive justice and the Bahá’í literatures support
activities that are mainly administered by the state, such as ‘progressive taxation’,

\[148\] Khadem. Huqúqu’lláh News Letter, no. 4, 1996, p. 3.

\[149\] There are several reasons for not accepting financial assistance from non-Bahá’ís. A person
who is contributing to the Bahá’í fund must be a believer and contributing with genuine intention.
Also, such assistance may create dependency issue, which may be political, and in this case
Bahá’ís get distance from any activities associated with political affairs.

and the promotion of ‘profit sharing’. The Bahá’í view is that acquiring wealth is
not immoral. Wealth is praiseworthy if it is earned honestly and spent sensibly in
a way that benefits the common good. However, the concept of distributive justice
advocates equity and not equality.

The theme of distributive justice has a direct impact on the purchasing power of
individuals and families to buy goods and services. This requires a discussion of
the pattern of consumption by people. The Bahá’í writings encourage Bahá’ís to
adopt a more sustainable pattern of living. Given the importance of consumer
support for the survival and on-going success of organisation, it is crucial that
being ethical and sustainable in dealing with consumers is regarded as one of the
most important areas of business ethics. This subject will be considered in the
next chapter under the theme ‘sustainable consumption.’

The Bahá’í International Community

4\.1    Introduction
The relationship between production and distribution is essential to understanding
consumption pattern. Experts in sustainable consumption, Mark Bevir and Frank
Trentmann argue that ‘Mundane Consumption is a necessary and routine part of
people’s lives, as is the exercise of choice in respect of a variety of relatively
inconspicuous or ordinary products and service intrinsic to the maintenance of
everyday life.’2 What is important about the consumption pattern in modern times
is the complexity of the integration of people and nations trading in a global
borderless market. The new consumer has access to different facilities such as the
Internet for researching and purchasing products of one’s own choice from
different sources and from every corner of this planet. A recent world population
projection by the United Nations, from 1990 to 2150, indicates that with the
increasing level of world population, the relationship between consumption and
sustainability is becoming critical.3 Consumption consists of normative choices

and a matter of value judgement. Value principles such as fairness, caring and
compassion play an important part when consumers associate with others in an
integrated market.4 Moral principles are also important in making final decisions
about choices. The main task of this chapter, therefore, is to discuss the role of
moral incentives in sustainable consumption and to explore selected Bahá’í
principles and their application to the Bahá’í lifestyle and, perhaps, as a model for
study in the wider society.

4\.2   The Bahá’í view on sustainable consumption
On the one hand, consumption can be considered the destroyer of the product but
on the other hand, it can mean sensible use of the product. It is the latter part that
will be used in the context of this subject. Bahá’ís are encouraged to use resources
with consideration for the needs of others, preserving the environment, the well-
being of animals, and protecting the rights of future generations. Hence, the
notion of sustainable consumption is closely linked with the concept of
sustainable living and sustainable development (chapter 7) and can be
conceptually divided into four components or four pillars of sustainability:
ecological, sociological, economic, and spiritual. My working definition of
sustainable living inspired by the Bahá’í scriptures is suggested as: the process of
wise and just use of resources for producing goods and services that consider the
basic human needs, while safeguarding nature for future generations. This
definition takes into account a number of features and to a certain extent has built
into it the characteristics of sustainable development, which encompasses both

\[4\] Neva Goodwin. ‘Consumption, Population, and Sustainability: Perspective from Science and
Religion,’ The Transition to a Transition, pp. 245-265, at p. 260.

sustainable production and sustainable consumption. The most important aspect is
the avoidance of wastages associated with the activities of production, distribution
and consumption. Such assumption rules out the one sidedness of materialism as a
necessary condition for well-being and prosperity. Eco-justice is suggested in this
research as a method of achieving well-being and preventing wastage. It refers to
observing eco-well-being for humans and for nature.                In the broadest sense,
prosperity is attained through eco well-being. The definition also supports a
number of Bahá’í writings, including the followings: ‘We see you increasing
every year your expenditures, and laying the burden thereof on your subjects;’5
‘the preservation of the world of being;’6 ‘Verily the most necessary thing is

contentment under all circumstances;’               and ‘the consciousness of world
citizenship.’8

Sustainable development ensures quality of life that compels wise use of
resources, prevention of waste, effective use of renewable resources9 within their
capacity for renewal and global equity, and justice in our actions in maintaining
responsibilities towards others and the environment. This definition, along with
government intervention, maintains a balance in lifestyle, which is the basis for
sustainable living. This corresponds with the Bahá’í view that ‘Only when
material and spiritual civilisation are linked and coordinated will happiness be
assured.’10 The divers balancing acts in lifestyle according to David Crocker,
expert in public policy and international development ‘… depends on a person’s

specific abilities, opportunities, and choices. What promotes and maintains
balances often vary from person to person as well as from society to society.’11
The level of consumption, therefore, varies not only among different individuals
and families, but also changes from place to place. The concept of sustainable
consumption, thus, has a strong ethical component. This involves the exercise of
justice and compassion in the sharing of resources between current and future
generations. The definition also supports the view expressed by the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated in 2002:

> Sustainable consumption is the use of goods and services
> that respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of
> life, while minimising the use of natural resources, toxic
> materials and emissions of waste and pollutants over the
> life-cycle, so as not to jeopardise the needs of future
> generations.12

Consumers are obviously one of the most important stakeholders for any
organisation, because without the support of customers or a demand for
commodities, organisations would be unlikely to survive. Customers are not just
those who buy finished products, but also all organisations and manufacturers that
purchase resources and necessary equipment for the provision of goods and
service.

An examination of the terms ‘needs’ and ‘wants’ would be useful for this
discussion. Traditionally, scarcity of resources is considered as a fundamental
economic problem. As resources are scarce, consumers have to make choices. For
consumers, these choices are in terms of what to consume, and how much to

Transition, pp. 207-219, at p. 214.

consume. Needs are essential and must be provided at all times. However, it is not
possible to satisfy all human wants at all times, because as one is satisfied another
appears. This is particularly obvious in markets for innovative products such as
TVs, mobile phones, computers and children’s toys. Therefore, although it is
possible to satisfy human needs, it may not be possible to satisfy all human wants
due to finite resources and infinite wants. Economists consider this phenomenon
as ‘the insatiability of human wants.’13 In this sense, the economic problem is
insoluble. The problem of insatiability of human wants has been the subject of
much discussion in economics. For example, Thorstein Veblen used the term
‘conspicuous consumption.’ The term refers to the tendency of people who want
above the subsistence level, which he calls the ‘leisure class.’14 In more recent
time Galbraith has pointed out that in most advanced industrial economies most
people have gone beyond the level of physical necessity. According to Galbraith
consumption had been the highest purpose of classical economic life, ‘…the
supreme source of Bentham’s happiness, the ultimate justification of all its effort
and toil. With Veblen it became in its fullest development a vacuous thing, a
service to puerile personal aggrandizement.’15 Galbraith, then, raises the question,
which is the focus in the Bahá’í writings, as well: ‘Is consumption the highest
purpose of what the economic system is really about?’16 According to Arthur
Dahl, the issue of consumption to a Bahá’í ‘comes down to each person’s
definition of his or her purpose in life. If it is material, then material consumption

\[14\] For the theory of ‘the Leisure Class,’ see: Thorstein Veblen, quoted in Galbraith, A History of
Economics, p. 176.

becomes an important factor.’17 It is here that the purpose of life for a Bahá’í in
relation to consumption of goods and services needs to be examined. The founder
of this faith made the purpose of life for Bahá’ís clear: He states, ‘One indeed is a
man who, today, dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race.’18
Esslemont writes, ‘When asked on one occasion: What is a Bahá’í? ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
replied: To be a Bahá’í simply means to love all the world; to love humanity and
try to serve it…’19 Based on these passages, if the purpose of life for a Bahá’í is
such values as service to humanity and awareness of the needs of others, then the
whole perspective changes. With such an attitude, everyone is mindful of others,
and tries to serve others even if they are in one’s view ‘heedless’. This leads to
ensuring the preservation and availability of resources for a wider society, now
and the future.

Arthur Dahl holds a visionary and creative view that in an ideal world those goods
and services that are damaging to the ecosystem, and do not possess the features
of sustainability, and are not in line with human dignity will be removed from the
market. For Dahl, the list of such unnecessary and damaging commodities
includes:

> Most military establishments and arms manufacture,
> industries supporting conspicuous consumption and luxury
> goods, the use of planned obsolescence as a tool to
> maintain sales, most advertising and excessive ‘brand’
> competition and marketing gimmicks, commercial sports
> and some forms of entertainment, and such harmful
> products as pornography, drugs, gambling, alcoholic

> beverages, tobacco and possibly even meat. [Hence he is
> raising a reasonable question] How much of the present
> economy would be lost if damaging, destructive or useless
> kinds of consumption were eliminated.20

But what will be the replacement suggested by Dahl for the economic losses of
eliminating those commodities that are unnecessary or damaging to the
environment? Examining some of the guiding principles of the founder of this
faith such as ‘…to carry forward an ever advancing civilisation’21, and ‘human
nobility’22, it is possible to argue that in an ideal and dynamic society, in the
absence of unnecessary goods and services there will be opportunities for creating
alternative products and services more valuable, beneficial and befitting of human
dignity such as additional social services, teaching opportunities, increasing the
possibility of research and development and innovation in areas such as food and
agriculture.

In a dynamic human society, Dahl believes that ‘sustainability is fundamentally a
question of balance maintained over time. It is, thus, something that cannot easily
be scaled and measured, since it is a quality of motion rather than a fixed point.’23
Hence, sustainability would be achieved when there are no forces to upset supply
and demand and hence maintaining equilibrium condition through moral
incentives. Dahl refers to examples such as ‘the limited size of a resource,

such as pollution.’24 Consequently, most factors that cause unsustainability lead
to market imbalances. Dahl’s argument is in agreement with the Bahá’í writings
that the current socio-politico-economic and environmental problems are due to
imbalances that exist between the material and spiritual aspects of life, and until
material civilisation ‘becomes combined with divine civilisation, the desired
result, which is the felicity of mankind, will not be attained.’25 Sustainability is,
therefore, an attempt to take good care of the earth’s resources. It aims to meet the
needs of this generation while protecting resources for future generations and at
the same time, preserving and respecting the environment. Sustainability is a
dynamic process, which affects us and is affected by us, thereby needing close
attention and great care in order for us to meet our own needs without upsetting
others. It involves responsible use of finite resources.

Just as there is rapid and continuous economic growth and higher standards of
living alongside increasing levels of income and capital investment that are
rapidly growing and maximising the returns to their owners, there is also rapid
technological advancement overwhelmingly affecting world-trading relationships.
One of the obvious examples of the impact of increasing know-how and
technological development is mass production and consequently over-
consumption by consumers as a symptom of the crisis of materialism, leading to
unsustainability and accompanying challenges of consumerism. Globally,
consumers are exposed differently with the experience of consumerism.

4\.3    The challenges of consumerism
The concept of the consumer and consumer society or consumerism sits at the
centre of numerous current debates among policy-makers, marketers, politicians,
and environmentalists. Consumerism is represents by Gabriel and Lang as ‘… a
moral doctrine in developed countries; the ideology of conspicuous consumption;
an economic ideology for global development; a political ideology; and a social

movement promoting and protecting consumer rights.’                           The culture of
consumerism has created a competitive market, and misguiding consumers
through manipulation of the market. This requires especial attention.

In recent times a growing number of people have been enjoying higher standards
of living, which led to the creation of ‘consumer society.’27 In particular, in the
periods between 1996 and 2011, forty countries moved from the lower income to
the high-income categories. This is about 20% of the world population that moved
from a ‘developing economy’ status in 1996 to Upper Middle/High Income status
by 2011. In 1996, the World Bank classified about 58% of the world’s economies
as low-income or developing, and by 2011 that percentage had fallen to only
39%.28 This signifies that millions of people have come out of absolute poverty
and are now enjoying a better quality of life, particularly in China.29 David Dollar,

who worked for five years as the World Bank’s Country Director for China and
Mongolia in the East Asia and Pacific Region, states: ‘Poverty, inequality and
social disparities during China’s economic reform declined’. Between 1981 and
2005 it is estimated that the poverty rate fell from 85% to 15%, roughly 600
million people relieved from poverty.30 This pattern of change in employment and
income earning is a factor, which led to consumerism. A major issue in
consumerism is in relation to sustainability and the excessive level of
consumption in developed countries, both at the individual level and collectively.
This can become a bigger problem as the developing countries are progressing
and joining the ranks of other consumer countries. Some people in such countries
will not be ready to give up the newly acquired benefits of economic growth in
the name of justifying, for example, the climate change. Followings are some
examples of consumerism and relevant issues gathered by Bahá’í expert in
agriculture and sustainable consumption, Paul Hanley:

Hanley believes that mass consumption of fast food unleashes a kind of trophic
cascade of health, social, and ecological impacts. 32 According to him, while
wealthy consumer societies rightly boast high longevity, the other side of that coin
is the rise of chronic illnesses, with more than nine million Canadians – a quarter
of the population – suffering from heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Economists
are relating these complications with the concept of marketing and its effects on
consumers. Given these current issues, it is worthwhile re-examining the ethical
basis for the consumer society and the marketing techniques and their effects on
sustainability. It would also be important to include the science of climate
change.

A definition of consumerism is useful to discuss the challenges of the term. With

the advent of mass production and cost-effective channels of distribution, which
are   now      possible    through      technological     advancement        and    effective
communication, the average person is immersed in the generation of income to
purchase items in excess of basic needs. In some societies, this overall pattern of
living has led to consumerism. Other similar terms used are ‘over-consumption’
and ‘consumer society.’ Consumerism increasingly dominates other aspects of life
such as politics, education, health, and personal relations.

According to Matthew Hilton, specialist in social history, consumerism is ‘the
absorption of social life into the world of commodities.’ 33 It is the full
participation in modern society, or as a negative expression, such as stated in
Vance Packard’s The Waste Makers where it was equated with ‘excessive
materialism.’34 Ralph Nader in 1968 wrote in the New York Review of Books:

> Consumerism is a term given vogue recently by business
> spokesmen to describe what they believe is a concerted,
> disruptive ideology concocted by self-appointed bleeding
> hearts and politicians who find it pays off to attack the
> corporations. Consumerism, they say, undermine public
> confidence in the business system [and] deprives the
> consumer of freedom of choice…35

As Hilton points out ‘Subsequently, the term came to be used more positively, by
the consumer movement itself, at it began to notice a series of campaigning
successes in the early 1970s.’36 For Roger Mason ‘consuming for status has, in
fact, become a defining element of the new consumer societies.’37

Ecological economist, Tim Jackson argues that consumer goods – from packaged
foods and cars to electronics – have come to play a role in our daily lives that goes
well beyond material functionality. 38 Similarly, Philip Cushman refers to the
extended ‘self’, which is ultimately an ‘empty self’ that stands in continual need
of being filled up with food, stimulants, and consumer products. He argues that
people are strongly influenced by social comparisons, thus the empty self is prey
to powerful social forces and specific institutions over to the pursuit of
consumerism. According to Cushman:

> firms. The restless desire of the empty self is the perfect
> complement for the restless innovation of the
> entrepreneur. The production of novelty through creative
> destruction drives and is driven by appetite for novelty in
> consumers.39

On the other hand, although the advent of globalisation has benefited both the
poor and the rich, the rapid and continuous economic growth has led to increasing
the gap between the rich and the poor. This means that the wealth and prosperity
of the rich has grown much faster than that of the poor. Economist Herman Daly
has argued that consumerism and the consumer economy are founded on a
philosophy of continuous economic growth, which he considered as uneconomic
growth. Therefore, he supports a qualitative economic growth:

> Even though economies are still growing, and still put
> growth in first place, it is no longer economic growth, at
> least in wealthy countries, but has become uneconomic

As Daly states, the rapid and unlimited economic growth that is taking place today
in industrialised nations and in emerging economies, has led to a deluded
consumer society. He argues that policies are needed to guide society towards a
balanced material standard of living, and a more equitable distribution of wealth.

Within the current economic system of rapid economic growth, there is a risk of
being locked into a form of development that is damaging to the environment in
the long run. Commenting on this Wilkinson and Pickett argue that ‘ as the rich
countries reach the end of the real benefits of economic growth, we have also had
to recognise the problems of global warming and the environmental limits of
growth.’41 If consumerism continues in its current unsustainable state, it will
require more resources to increase the level of output in order to meet related
demands, leading to further environmental damage. Also, in causing high demand,
consumerism can cause an increase in prices, leading to global inflation.42 This, in
turn, would cause additional suffering to the poor and widen the gap between the
rich and the poor in both developed and developing countries.

Also, if we look at the massive rise in living standards and material wealth that

accompanied economic growth in the developed world in the twentieth century,
one of the key mechanisms involved was the strong association between those that
produced and those that consumed. This led to employing increasing numbers of
workers in factories and other production units, paying them a decent wage and
thus fuelling rising demand for more products as those workers become better off.
Globalisation has strengthened this process by creating a mechanism to link
production and consumption, through outsourcing the production of Western
consumer goods to companies in less developed countries. For example, workers
in many less developed countries now primarily carry out the production of
clothing and footwear for consumers in the developed world.

According to Barry Smart, with the exception of the last category all of the
distinct uses listed are closely interrelated aspects of an ethos of consumerism that
gathered momentum throughout the twentieth century with the accelerating global
diffusion of the economic logic of modern capitalism in the West.43 Considering
the modern life-style in the West and other developed countries, consumerism is
represents by Gabriel and Lang with five characteristics, as: ‘a moral doctrine in
developed countries; the ideology of conspicuous consumption; an economic
ideology for global development; a political ideology; and a social movement
promoting and protecting consumer rights.’44

The Bahá’í writings warned about consequences of the excess of consumer
society and material civilisation and how it would lead society into crisis.

\[43\] For a discussion of consumerism in the West see: Barry Smart. Consumer Society: Critical
Issues and Environmental Consequences, London: Sage, 2010, pp. 7-10.

Bahá’u’lláh said ‘If [materialism] carried to excess civilisation will prove as
prolific a source of evil.’45 Some of the characteristics of the present materialistic
civilisation would seem to fit this insight from the Universal House of Justice,

> Today the world is assailed by an array of destructive
> forces. Materialism, rooted in the West, has now spread to
> every corner of the planet, breeding, in the name of a
> strong global economy and human welfare, a culture of
> consumerism.46

Materialism, therefore, is the root cause of many social illnesses, consumerism
being one. Hanley has explored this subject and noted numerous worrying
examples of the present condition of the world associated with materialism.47
Smart argues that global brands, developed mainly in the West, have successfully
penetrated local cultures and attracted people around the world to consume this or
that commodity by generating persuasive and appealing promotional lines and
marketing messages. For example, ‘It’s the real thing’ (Coca-Cola), ‘Just do it’
(Nike), Impossible is nothing’ (Adidas), or the zeitgeist defining, ‘because you’re
worth it’ (L’Oreal), which effectively exemplifies the egoistic individualism
central to late-modern, materially acquisitive consumer culture.

It is fair to state that marketing has been praised in a number of ways. Through
information, marketing provides customers can make more knowledgeable
decisions than their predecessors about which products they want to meet their
needs and desires. Marketing is also praised for contributing to the economic of
developing nations. It brings them goods, services, and knowledge of products

that they would otherwise not have. Marketing, particularly as a social marketing
has been praised. Marketing techniques, when used by social marketers, have
addressed social concerns, such as leprosy, DIDS, and forest fire. The results have
been rather dramatic in some areas. Consequently, according to Brenkert ‘social
marketers requires a theory of individual and social welfare according to which
they may justifiably act on behalf of the individuals they seek to benefit. 48
However, currently, social marketing lacks such a theory.

Advertising is about providing information, and according to Richard Pollay, the
communication of values must be at the heart of advertising. Pollay considers that
the saturation of everyday life with increased marketing communications, has
generated an ideology of materialism in society to ‘institute in our culture an
identification of consumption with happiness.’ 49 Values influences thoughts,
feelings, and behaviour of people in different ways. Commenting on the role of
value in marketing and advertisement Pollay writes:

Therefore, value hierarchy is able to play important role in influencing consumer
decision-making in expansion of marketing and global communications
technologies that has led to an increase in demand for products such as satellite
TV and the Internet. Such developments have initiated the promotion of a
consumerist lifestyle and the vision of better standards of living, not just within
national borders but also on a global scale. The promotion of a consumerist
lifestyle has contributed to increasing demand not only by consumers but also by
the private sector and government. These economic activities, according to
Keynes, lead to increasing aggregate demand and hence the economic growth of a
country. But to what extent will such a relationship between consumption and
growth continue to exist in a global market. Expounding on this view, Andrew
Crane and Dirk Matten write:

As pointed out by Dahl, one of the consequences of a consumer society is that the
market produces a substantial amount of products that are unnecessary or are in

\[50\] Pollay. Journal of Marketing, p. 106.

low demand. Similarly, consumer knowledge and information may not be at a
level to realise the consequence of disadvantage goods and services, not making
the right choices as a result. For instance, lack of education and in sufficient
information about health makes people illiterate and poor in health. This manifests
itself in an unsustainable lifestyle, which is detrimental to human life and to the
environment. This, according to Dahl and Galbraith leads to serious
disequilibrium or disparity in the market. Galbraith argues that:

> This disparity carries to the point where it is a cause of
> social discomfort and social unhealthy. The line, which
> divides our area of wealth from our area of poverty, is

> services. Our wealth in the first is not only in startling
> contrast with the meagreness of the latter, but our wealth
> in privately produced goods is, to marked degree, the
> cause of crisis in the supply of public services.52

The assumption is that policy makers have failed to recognise the challenges of
the market and of the consumerism Galbraith is talking about. Some of these
challenges are: environmental risks, the misuse of the power of the multinational
corporations, and lack of sufficient moral leadership. A particular challenge is
misleading marketing. George Brenkert argue that ‘Marketing has been criticised
more generally as simply being wasteful, expending billions of pounds to
persuade people to buy products they don’t need. It is accused of bringing about
the commercialisation of society and human relations. It is reproached for
promoting both materialism and consumerism.’ 53 Research done by Brenkert
indicates that the problem of obesity is attributed, at leased in part, to the
marketing practices of fast-food producers and advertisers. This is due to

\[52\] Galbraith. The affluent society, p. 186.

unregulated capitalism and its offshoot, the free market economy. In 1936, Shoghi
Effendi states that the free market economy needs to be regulated and controlled.
Galbraith also believes that policy makers have failed to see the importance, and
indeed the urgent need, of maintaining a balance between the two [control and
coordination of the market].’54 A number of countries have already adopted the
policy of regulating the market, such as the Competition Commission in the
United Kingdom and the European Union.

The Bahá’í writings provide a number of principles that, taken together with a
basic spiritual transformation in society, show the pathway for sustainable living
and guide communities towards a more sustainable future. One such belief is an
understanding of human nature, which encourages us to re-examine who we are
and what our purpose in life is? Universal and compulsory education, and the
spiritual principle of moderation are strongly suggested in the Bahá’í writings as a
solution to the problem of materialism and consumerism.

4\.4       Consumer education
The two Bahá’í principles of harmonisation of science and religion and
independent investigation of truth form the basis for inspiring Bahá’ís to make
appropriate decisions about their choices of goods and services. Consumer
education can provide people with the knowledge to consider the advantages and
disadvantages of goods and services, or to distinguish between true and untrue
advertisements. Knowledge and information are critical determinants of market
efficiency. Therefore, the quality of information directly affects the ability of the

\[54\] Galbraith. The affluent society, p. 186.

market to meet society’s collective material needs.

The consumer determines the success and failure of every business organization.
Consumers are the reason for continued production of a product and hence for a
business to be sustained. The success of every marketing plan must begin with the
consumer and depends on whether the marketing plan has considered consumer
behavior. Without such consideration the marketing plan would be a failure.
Similarly, the success of all aspects of a product, including its price, quality,
shape, color, size, taste, and distribution channel, depends on the satisfaction of
consumers. Ultimately, consumers can influence producers, manufacturers,
suppliers, and the middlemen to deliver goods and services according to consumer
choice. Therefore, ‘consumer sovereignty’ is an expression that signifies the
power of consumers to determine what goods and services need to be available in
the market. In other words, it is mostly consumers who can determine the way in
which resources are allocated. Keeping in mind that effective allocation of
resources is one of the fundamental principles of economics, consumer education
helps to allocate resources more effectively and efficiently. Under this condition,
consumers become more responsible and vigilance towards resources and also
people’s needs. Such an education is necessary because of the vulnerability factor
of certain consumers such as income, age, education and health. Consumer
education is also helpful when dealing with the issue of consumer capability, for
example freedom from limitation and rational decision-making. It also helps with
comparability and the complexity of information that comes with the variety of
marketing techniques. As the market becomes more competitive, there is also the
issue of differentiating between products, which requires a certain level of

knowledge and information to enable consumers to make a distinction between
them. The authorities in the UK have taken a number of steps to assist ‘consumer
education’55 and thus influencing sustainable consumption. Consumer education
will have a positive effect on the success of the Bahá’í-inspired model of
economic sustainability introduced in chapter 7.

Loudon and Bitta examining the impact of consumer education and write:

> Consumers stand to benefit directly from orderly
> investigations of their own behaviour. This can occur on
> an individual basis or as part of more formal educational
> programs. As we study what has been discovered about
> the behaviour of others, we can gain insight into our own

> opportunity to understand better how they affect our own
> behaviour.56

What is learned from the above statement is that consumer behaviour can directly
benefit consumers in a more formal sense. The knowledge acquired can serve as
data and information for the development of educational programs designed to
improve consumers’ decision-making regarding products and services.                         As
consumers become better informed about a sustainable lifestyle, they are inclined

\[55\] For an in depth discussion of consumer education in the UK see: Matthew Hilton. Consumerism
in the 20th Century Britain, Cambridge University Press, 2003, pp. 235-237. (Consumer education
in the UK is available through educational policy in the form of issuing pamphlets on shopping
advice, on consumer rights, and on quality standards. Publications such as Information for
Consumer Education provided teachers with a comprehensive list of sources of information on
where the consumer should turn to in government departments, and the laws that protected the
consumer. Adults were targeted through the Consumer Education Panel of the National Institution
of Adult Education which devised consumer education classes.)

\[56\] Loudon, D. L. and Bitta, A. J. Consumer Behaviour – Concepts and Applications, pp. 19-20.

to demand products that are not exploitative. Consequently, successful
organisations would be those that respond positively to demands. In an age of a
materialistic attitudes and market complexity, consumer education is vital in
improving decision-making. One advantage of the ability approach is that it
recognises individual as well as social variation in the level of consumption
needed to achieve a sustainable lifestyle.

In spite of the effectiveness of consumer education and the way it can influence
firms to produce goods and services that are sensitive and sustainable, producers
have the power to influence consumers through marketing techniques. The
remedy suggested in the Bahá’í writings is through legislation and regulating the
market, which can run alongside consumer education. In practice consumer
protection laws are established in most countries under the banner of ‘consumer
rights.’ In terms of an ethical consideration we can define rights in relation to
natural rights, which are those basic, important, undeniable, befitting entitlements
that should be respected and protected at all times. The concept of rights was
introduced and led to the United Nations Charter of Human Rights, issued in
1948\. This has been a powerful standard for worldwide enforcement of various
basic rights. The most recent manifestation of this is the Charter of Fundamental
Human Rights for the European Union agreed in the Nice Treaty in 2000. In the
United Kingdom Consumer Protection Law under the supervision of the
Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trade also protects consumers.

Consumer education, although necessary to achieve sustainability, is not
sufficient. There are other areas that need to be considered. The issue is not about

what product or how much of what product, but the question of why a product?
Hence, the focus would be on why a product is needed, rather than what is
needed. Increasing consumer and producer knowledge and responsibility greatly
influence why a product is needed. For the consideration of the ‘why’ question,
the model of economic sustainability in chapter 7 incorporates principles such as
cooperation, moderation, and consultation.

In many instances the lack of sufficient consumer knowledge and information
leads to under-consumption of merit goods, and over-consumption of demerit
goods. Merit goods57 with positive externality by definition are those goods and
services that are valuable to an individual and valuable to the whole society, such
as education and vaccination. In other words, the benefits to society exceed the
private benefits. Demerit goods 58 with negative externality are those that are
unsafe to the individual and the whole society, such as the use of hard drugs and
gambling.59 Similarly, there will be under-production and over-production, which
consequently lead to shortages and surpluses of output. The consumers’ actions
and producers’ reactions lead to a waste of resources, both human and physical.
Consumer education, in this way, can greatly influence the market to allocate
resources effectively, or in economic terms, achieve equilibrium. Consumers, if
well informed, can shape the social impact of corporations, and even their size,
through their expenditure decisions. Moral leadership is also needed in addition to
consumer education for a sustainable mode of production. On a practical level,

sustainability requires maintenance and social responsibility at both the individual
and corporation level. Thus, consumer education, corporate social responsibility
and sustainability go hand in hand.

A number of guiding principles influence Bahá’ís, as producers and consumers, to
make right decisions about what to produce and what to consume. For example,
the principle of universal and compulsory education assists Bahá’ís in making a
distinction between merit goods and demerit goods. The principle of harmony
between science and religion helps a Bahá’í to become conscious of the benefits a
product offers not only to consumers but also its effects on the environment. The
consciousness and realisation of the principle of oneness of humankind makes it
possible to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle and save resources for the benefits
of those in need, and a personal commitment and a wider loyalty to the whole of
the human race. Such an attitude will effectively influence sustainable living. The
theme of service is obviously crucial to the Bahá’í understanding of sustainable
consumption. Service to humanity is closely associated with the ethical concept of
compassion and caring (chapter 7, section 7.5). Compassionate people have deep
awareness of the suffering of others. The Bahá’í model of consultation helps
Bahá’ís, individually and collectively, to make well-informed decisions to live a
well-balanced life. The Bahá’í writings emphasises on the importance of the
principle of moderation.

4\.5   The principle of moderation
Materialistic ideologies, including unregulated capitalism and ego-centred values,
underpin the economic problems associated with over-consumption and

consumerism. For example, economic growth, according to Keynes, relies on
ever-increasing consumption as one of the components of aggregate demand.60 For
genuine and effective action to tackle the problem of consumerism, therefore,
economic theories such as the theory of demand in microeconomics (classical),
and aggregate demand in macroeconomics (new-classical), and utilitarian theory,61
which are money-orientated, would not be appropriate. These theories are
inadequate to deal with the challenges of consumerism and establishing
sustainable consumption.

For the purpose of this topic, we have to make a distinction between consumerism
and living well. The Bahá’í writings maintain the view that sustainability is
associated with living well, but requires living in ‘moderation’. There is a
correlation between moderation and sustainable living; sustainable living is a life-
style when one enjoys resources with consideration for other people, the
environment and the future generation. The Bahá’í writings suggest a life-style
with moderation.

The word moderation is defined as the action or an act of moderating; limitation;
restriction; and a fixed limit.62 It is also described as the quality of being moderate

\[60\] For Keynes the components of ‘aggregate demand’ in a country include: consumption,
investment, government expenditure, and export minus import (AD=C+I+G+X-M). Increasing
aggregate demand cause Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and hence the national income to rise.
GDP is a measure of economic growth. See: Begg, Fischer and Dornbusch, pp. 401-402.

\[61\] Utilitarian also expressed the idea that we all should be in greatest happiness. The most eminent
thinkers for this view are Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill. Utilitarian argued that to achieve
‘the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people’ income must be transferred from the rich
to the poor up to the point of complete equality, to the point at which there are no rich and no poor.
The reasoning according to utilitarian is that everyone has the same needs, and everyone has the
same capacity to enjoy life. See: The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, p. 377.

in various senses, in reference to conduct, opinions, demands, and desires or their
indulgence.63 Alternatively, moderation is avoidance of extremes, especially in
one’s behavior.64 Moderation at societal level is ‘avoidance of extremes,’ or more
specifically, according to Bahá’í writings ‘the extremes of wealth and poverty.’65
Shoghi Effendi, referring to the Bahá’í economic system of the future, states that
it is ‘A system that prevents among others the gradual control of wealth in the
hands of a few and the resulting state of both extremes, wealth and poverty.’66 As
discussed in chapter 3 the Bahá’í distributive justice is intended to control the
excessive accumulation of wealth in the hands of few. A part of the total wealth
will be distributed among the poor. However, this will be a gradual process. But
will the principle of moderation help to eliminate the gap between the rich and the
poor? An example would be that when people use all the good things that are
created in abundance effectively, there will be no need for the production of
unnecessary, damaging, and destructive products discussed earlier. In this way
resources will be saved for improving the lives of the poor.

Moderation, if practised, can maintain a balance in the material and spiritual life
of individuals, and at the same time it can be a solution to the societal problems
associated with extremes. Moderation and lack of it can impact on all aspects of a
society’s lifestyle, economics, environment and culture. For example, regarding
the effect of moderation on the environment Dahl writes, ‘Moderation in

\[63\] Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed., p. 946.

consumption is necessary to stay within environmental limits.’67 To attain this
balance, Bahá’ís are counselled that ‘In all matters moderation is desirable.’68 One
may wonder if we spend and consume sensibly because of the economic
conditions or because by doing so we acquire virtues. It is possible that we may be
spending sensibly and practising moderation due to economic conditions;
nevertheless, by exercising this principle, we acquire virtues. The moral
implication is that one should be kind and compassionate and share with those in
need and have empathy and understanding for those with inadequate living. It also
requires protecting the environment and respecting the future generation. All of
these are virtuous qualities that one is require to apply in relation to others.
Moderation necessitates control of one’s selfish desires and refraining from greed
and self-indulgence. If we define the purpose of economics as an art of effective
and efficient use of resources, then moderation and greed would be at the opposite
poles. Greed leads to wastage of resources, while the aim of economics is the
reduction and prevention of wastage.

Moderation also has important implications in economics through resource
allocation. The exercise of moderation is commendable in all things including in
trade. The lack of control on the growth and enlargement of organisations may
lead to the creation of monopolies. The out-of-proportion expansion can be
challenging for the economy and a disadvantage to the organisation. One of the
difficulties of such out-of-proportion expansion is the creation of monopoly power
and its undesirable and harmful consequences which includes: wastage or lack of

appropriate control over resources, problems of coordination and cooperation
among various departments, and as a barrier to desirable competition. 69 By
desirable competition, I mean activities that are morally right and serve for the
advancement of wider society. Since large companies hold a great share of the
market, if they fail, the entire market would face crisis. Thus, a moderate
expansion of trade appears to be safer for organisations and for the entire market.

The argument presented here is that moderation requires a limit to economic
growth. However, the extent to which moderation is required for the progress of a
country varies from one economy to another. In the initial stage, for example, an
economy requires a faster and higher degree of economic growth to achieve
reasonable take-off. Expert in economic growth and development Walt Rostow
considers five stages for economic growth. 70 Among them the stage of take-off is
an important aspect of economic growth. This stage requires a substantial volume
of resources of all kinds, including human, physical, and capital resources; plus
adequate saving and investment. Hence, the exercise of moderation may not be
very helpful at this stage, particularly for less developed countries. Also, from an
economic perspective, certain industries must remain large (natural monopolies)71
otherwise they will suffer from diseconomies of scale that is not beneficial to
consumers and the wider society. Examples include: Utility companies.

of economic growth: the traditional society, the pre-conditions for take-off into self-sustaining
growth, the take-off, the drive to maturity, and the age of the mass consumption.)

\[71\] Massimo Motta. Competition Policy: Theory and Practice, Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 2004, pp. 12-13. (In some countries like UK monopolies are regulated and monitored under
Competition Commission (CC). Monopoly is defined as a firm having more than 25% market
share. CC also make recommendations such as seeking changes in the firms’ business practices,
imposing price controls and even divestment. This introduces the possibility of structural
interventions, which is more typical of regulatory regimes than competition policy.)

The exercise of moderation varies among people and depends largely on
individual and family circumstances such as the size of the family, employment,
the level of earnings, and the pattern of individual and family life-style. What kind
of moderation is suggested for those who are in absolute poverty? Once one
crosses the boundaries of moderation, Bahá’u’lláh confirms ‘…it will prove a
source of evil.’72 Economically, one can consider the term ‘evil’ in this passage as
the production and consumption of those products that are unsustainable and bring
about the wastage of rare earth resources, environmental degradation, and
consumerism. Hence, even during a period of abundance, moderation is
appreciated and recommended.

We should also make a distinction between a moderate way of life, simple living,
and asceticism. Voluntary simplicity or simple living can be described as when
individuals or families, by their own choice, reduce the consumption of goods and
services to their basic needs, or avoid accumulation of wealth. Voluntary
simplicity is different from a situation where individuals are poor and are forced
to spend less, or have a simple life because, for example, they are unemployed.
Simplicity, however, may not be constructive for economic reasons. For example,
it may cause unemployment, slow economic growth, and less government revenue
and its consequences on public services. However, voluntary simplicity adopted
as an alternative way of life is very different from simplicity that is forced on
people by poverty. This discussion focuses mainly on the voluntary choices
available to those live in relative abundance, in part because much of the solution

\[72\] Bahá’u’lláh. Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 69.

to poverty lies in the choices made by those who are not poor. It may be argued
that lower consumption or simplicity may lead to high unemployment. However,
the world is full of purposeful, productive and satisfying jobs waiting to be done
in areas such as education, urban renewal, environmental restoration, childcare,
and health care. In Bahá’í view a simple needs-orientated economy with the
concept of moderation will be better able to address these urgent concerns.

A person may choose simple living for different personal reasons, such as health,
an increase in quality time with family and friends, stress reduction, personal
taste, a reaction to materialism and to support an anti-consumerist movement.
Simple living is not ‘…living in seclusion or practicing asceticism...’73 Asceticism
is not encouraged in the Bahá’í writings. Obviously, most human beings, to some
degree, experience physical suffering throughout their lives; however, it should
not be invited or made into a way of life. The Bahá’í writings discourage
practicing asceticism, which is characterised by abstinence from worldly pleasures
as a lifestyle. The concept of detachment is interpreted by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as:

> Detachment does not consist in setting fire to one's house,
> or becoming bankrupt or throwing one’s fortune out of the
> window, or even giving away all of one’s possessions.
> Detachment consists in refraining from letting our
> possessions possess us.74

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, then, clarifies his interpretation of detachment by
stating examples including ‘A prosperous merchant who is not
absorbed in his business knows severance. A banker whose
occupation does not prevent him from serving humanity is severed. A
poor man can be attached to a small thing.’75 Explaining the two
concepts of detachment and asceticism and their worldly benefits

The legitimate privilege to derive the fullest advantage and benefit from the
manifold joys, beauties, and pleasures of this world, according to Shoghi Effendi
requires ‘the maintenance of … a high standard of moral conduct.’77 Maintaining
such a high standard of moral conduct in all aspects of life, then it is left to the
discretion of individuals to decide their degree of moderation, as this may vary
from person to person.

4\.6       Human contentment and satisfaction
It is contentment and not complacency that the Bahá’í writings promote. The
former is a virtue that harmonises the distributive function, while the latter may
even impede the productive function and progress. Complacency is the expression
of the lack of motivation to acquire and accumulate. The Bahá’í view is that
society should be rich and not a minority of population (chapter 3, section 3.4).

\[76\] Shoghi Effendi. Advent of Divine Justice, p. 44.

\[77\] Ibid.

Society is more than just individuals. Materially, society consists of schools,
hospitals, roads, and other infrastructures and services. At the societal level the
emphasis is ‘to ensure the welfare of the commonwealth’78 and at the individual
level a Bahá’í should be content ‘with but little of this world’s goods.’79 The
challenge, however, is how to be content with little of this world while
considering wealth commendable. Do these contradict each other? It is argued
here that the spirit of both concepts conveys the same meaning and that is a
sustainable lifestyle.

What is the economic significance of being content with little? Viewed only from
an economic perspective reducing consumption leads to a reduction in demand
and hence in production. This has serious implications for employment, income,
investment, and other aspects crucial to economic well-being and growth.
Reducing consumption by developed nations means less export by developing
countries. This is not adding to the economy of less developed countries, but
makes it more fragile. Many multinational companies operate in those countries.
Developed countries provide an important market for imported products from
developing economies and reduced expenditure by developed nations will have
serious implications on export in developing countries. To a great extent,
consumer spending is an important means to bring an economy out of a slow
economic activity, although the very expression ‘consumer society’ suggests
disequilibrium and global market distortion. However, we can also argue that the
Bahá’í view of being content with little and sharing the extra with the low income

\[78\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Promulgation of Universal Peace, p.181.

\[79\] Ibid., Bahá’í World Faith, p. 375.

group does not actually reduce economic activity because the increase in the
economy caused by growth in the lower income group is more than the decrease
in the economy caused by reducing consumption in the high income group. This is
true since the majority of the world’s population live in developing countries and
are considered the lower income group. Therefore, there is a need for a new mind-
set for both the lower and higher income groups for adopting a sustainable life
style. However, there would be some economic implications when the lower-
income group moves to the middle-income group as noted in recent years. These
include increasing global inflation, shortage of resources, problems associated
with consumerism, and market disequilibrium, which would have an undesirable
impact on sustainability.

Commitment to sustainable development necessitates a gradual and high degree of
responsibility and moral obligation by people towards the essentials of
sustainability.    Within the Bahá’í community this is attained mainly through
education. For moderation, contentment, and satisfaction with basic human needs
to become feasible, these moral principles must be inculcated from a young age.
The Bahá’í community considers the education of children as an important part of
this process. The Universal House of Justice encourages Bahá’í parents ‘to rear
children that see their own welfare as inseparable from the welfare of others.’80 A
fundamental shift in perspective is needed, one that changes the way in which
certain essential concepts are viewed: for example, the meaning of true happiness
and prosperity, the true purpose of life, and the place that material pursuits should

\[80\] Universal House of Justice. Message to the Bahá’ís of the world, 2 April 2010, Haifa: Bahá’í
World Centre Publication, 2010.

assume in one’s individual and family life. In the Bahá’í view, the family unit
offers an ideal setting where those moral qualities that contribute to a proper view
of material wealth and its utilisation can be shaped. In this light, children should
be raised in a culture of praising and practising moderation so that it becomes a
part of their belief system.81 This would then turn into a cultural phenomenon,
which in the long run would become natural and easy to employ.

Prosperity is a relative concept and has a cultural element. It may be argued that
the first thing that comes to mind is having an adequate amount of income and
wealth to become prosperous. However, perception of wealth is relative. For
Arthur Dahl ‘there is an important cultural dimension to prosperity and the kinds
of consumption used to signal prosperity.’82 He points out that for some with a
lower income, food would be a preferred medium of expression; for others with a
higher income, an automobile; and for some rural villagers, a school, a clinic or a
church. Hence, prosperity can be expressed through personal consumption or at a
community level through the provision of joint services. Either option can
increase prosperity and happiness.

4\.7    Specific teachings on sustainable consumption
All faiths including the Bahá’í faith have laws on the consumption of goods and
services. There are a number of guiding principles available in the Bahá’í writings
for managing a sustainable consumption; these are discussed in the following

4\.7.1    The Bahá’í law of Fasting
Fasting (‫ ﺻﻴﯿﺎﻡم‬- siam) is a teaching given by all major religions. Along with
obligatory prayer, fasting is one of the greatest obligations of a Bahá'í. The Bahá'í
fasting is the complete abstinence from both food and drink from sunrise to sunset
during the Bahá'í month of ‘Loftiness’ for the period of 2-20 of March inclusive.

Fasting is symbolic. The basis for fasting is to obey the law and to remember the
conditions of those who are suffering, as well as abstention from one’s worldly
desires. Shoghi Effendi describes a number of features of Bahá’í fasting: ‘It is
essentially a period of meditation and prayer, of spiritual recuperation...’ 83; this is
a period that a Bahá’í ‘...must strive to make the necessary readjustments in his
inner life...’84 Thus, its significance and purpose are fundamentally spiritual in
character. ‘Fasting is symbolic, and a reminder of abstinence from selfish and
carnal desires.’85 Through fasting, as a symbolic phenomenon, people learn to
develop powers of self-control and self-restraint and resist any wrongdoing to
bring about self-improvement. The deprivation brought about by fasting makes
one sympathise with the suffering of others. It also makes people remember the
blessings of life that they normally take for granted. Hence, the fast is not merely
related to the body, but the spirit as well. According to John Esslemont the reality
of the Bahá’í fast is not in abstaining from consumption of food ‘…but in the
abstention from the desires and lusts of the flesh, and in severance from all save

\[83\] Shoghi Effendi. Directives from the Guardian, p. 28.

God.’86

The economic significance of fasting is that it helps Bahá’ís reflect on their own
consumption and the problems associated with over-consumption; practising
moderation and perhaps being content with little. Also, it can help improve self-
care and preservation of health. The Bahá’í teaching on fasting therefore helps
believers to reflect and change their attitude towards their lifestyle and allows
individuals to take an objective view of their habits and become aware of the
needs of others. Charity and generosity are especially urged during the period of
fasting.

4\.7.2      The Bahá’í perspective on food and agriculture
The Bahá’í writings consider agriculture (‫ ﺯزﺭرﺍاﻋﺖ‬- zirá‘at) as a ‘vital and important
matter.’87 The commitment of the central figures of the Bahá’í faith to agriculture
is evident from their ‘…own agricultural endeavours and extensive discourse on
the topic.’88 In one of his writings Bahá’u’lláh has paid ‘special regard’89 to the
matter of agriculture, acknowledging that agriculture ‘unquestionably precedeth’90
in importance to some other Bahá’í principles, referring to ‘peace’, ‘one common
language’, ‘unity’, and ‘education’.91 Similar statements about the importance of
agriculture are seen in the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. For example he refers to

\[91\] For the full tablet, see: Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 89.

agriculture as ‘the fundamental basis of the community,’92 and a noble science,’93
the practice of which is an ‘act of worship,’94 and he encourages Bahá’ís to engage
in ‘agricultural sciences.’ 95 He indicates that should an individual ‘become
proficient in this field, he will become a means of providing for the comfort of
untold numbers of people.’96

Paul Hanley raises some legitimate questions: ‘Why this ‘special regard’ for
agriculture? Why should it take precedence over other principles such as the
promotion of international peace or education?’97 One comment by Hanley is that
‘food is the prerequisite of human development.’ 98 Without adequate food,
nothing can be accomplished. Food is a requirement for human intellectual and
physical development. It would be difficult to accomplish peace and security or
even fellowship while masses of people starve. Education is hardly possible when
children are malnourished, and economic stability will not be attained if there is
the frustration of hunger among multitudes of people. In all these circumstances
lack of food is a major factor, hence, it must be provided.

The products of the land, however, has evolved from one stage to another, and
from one place to another, depending on the demand for the product, the type of
knowledge and technology used, the increase in population, and the ecosystem.

Hence, it will be difficult to see any resemblance between agriculture in the time
of Bahá’u’lláh in the 19th century and that of today and that in the future.
However, from a Bahá’í perspective, whatever the changes, agriculture will
remain as the basis of human society and of the whole economy.

When considering agriculture, there are still challenges that need to be faced and
tackled. One such challenge is in countries with small pieces of land, such as
Swaziland; others with heavy floods and an increasing population like
Bangladesh; and some with poor quality of land or scarce resources such as
Ethiopia and Sudan. Responding to these challenges, the Bahá’í writings advocate
a multi-dimensional approach. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá suggests using a combination of
agriculture and other sciences such as manufacturing and technology, and the
Universal House of Justice recommends to ‘promote the standard of agriculture
and other skills in the life of the people.’99 The success of the role of modern
technology and advanced transportation systems cannot be disregarded when
discussing agriculture and food production and distribution.

While there is great success in the modernisation of agriculture and food
production in recent times, there are also tragic failures. Paul Hanley, argues that
the world’s food and agriculture system is the greatest achievement of civilisation.
Stanley Wood writes ‘Today, agriculture provides more than 94% of the protein
and 99% of the calories for 6 billion people.’100 Most of the human population
explosion has occurred in the past one hundred years. Population has almost

\[99\] Universal House of Justice. Letter dated 27 July 1976, Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre Publication,

quadrupled since 1900, when there were 1.6 billion people. Since 1960 it has
[more than] doubled, from 3 billion to 7 billion. Yet agriculture has more than
kept pace. On average, food supplies are 24% higher per person today than in
1961 and real prices are 40% lower. Despite this success, extreme food
deprivation is widespread. Some 792 million people in developing countries –
18% of their population – are chronically undernourished.101 According to the
Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations ‘Extreme food
deprivation and plentiful food supplies in the world with excellent means of
communications and transport, can only suggest that there are fundamental flaws
in the way in which nations are functioning and the relationship between them are
governed and managed.’102

Food plays a vital role not only in physical and intellectual development, but also
in maintaining good health. However, dietary codes are not prominent in the
Bahá’í sacred writings. Bahá’u’lláh recommends: ‘Eat ye, O people, of the good
things which God hath allowed you, and deprive not yourselves from His
wondrous bounties.’103 In this passage Bahá’u’lláh not only encourages people to
eat ‘good things’, he also reminds them that these are bounties from God and one
need not deprive oneself of them. Rather than setting out detailed rules, the Bahá’í
writings have provided guidance and stress the responsibility of individuals to live
a virtuous life. Emphasising the harmony of science and religion, the Bahá’í
writings suggest a kind of food discourse that invokes the virtues of naturalness,

simplicity, moderation, compassion and justice. Attention should be paid to
moderation in order to help maintain a relatively healthy physical and mental
state. Bahá’u’lláh affirms:

> In all circumstances they should conduct themselves with
> moderation; if the meal be only one course this is more
> pleasing in the sight of God; however, according to their
> means, they should seek to have this single dish be of
> good quality.104

Of course the concept of a one-course meal and a ‘single dish’ may have different
interpretations depending on the country, culture or particular circumstance or
occasion. What is important is the consideration of moderation. Such an attitude
towards food can have great economic implications.

Another significant economic implication related to food is the guidance of
Bahá’u’lláh ‘…do not eat except when you are hungry.’105 This not only can have
a significant impact on one’s physical well-being but also prevents obesity and the
different illnesses and disorders which may result from it, such as hypertension,
coronary heart disease, high cholesterol and diabetes. Therefore the two principles
in relation to food and physical well-being are (a) moderation, which signifies the
amount of food one eats, and (b) the timing of having food, which is to eat when
one is hungry. The practice of these principles will also lead to a reduction of
wasted resources.

Having discussed the amount and timing of eating, the sustainability of the

Physician (Lawh-i-Tibb)

production process also plays an important role in economic well-being. However,
it may be difficult to argue that consumers have an ethical responsibility to
purchase sustainable products, for example when the cost difference between
organic and non-organic food is substantial. Many consumers are simply unable to
afford the high prices of organically farmed products. In practice, farmers will
make decisions based upon the potential costs and benefits, while being mindful
that consumers are now well informed and mostly capable of right purchase.
Increasing pressure from the media, the government, the public and pressure
groups, is resulting in changes in farming practices that may eventually ensure
that all products are environmentally sustainable. It is worth mentioning that
although in the Bahá’í faith eating meat is not prohibited, and there are no
directives to Bahá’ís to become vegetarian, Bahá’ís are advised that the natural
human diet consists of grains, fruits and vegetables.106 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirms: ‘…
the time will come when meat will no longer be eaten … the people will gradually
develop up to the condition of this natural food.’107 The purpose of this research is
not to argue directly either for or against eating meat or being vegetarian, rather, it
is to examine the Bahá’í view about food and the associated moral consideration.
However, there is no doubt that when less meat is produced and used, it will have
an impact on the environment as well as our physical health.

Bahá’í scholars studied the subject of food and agriculture from different
perspectives. The concern of Arthur Dahl is on the preservation of the ecosystem.
He provides an optimistic view that humanity is mature enough to take

\[106\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Quoted in Lights of Guidance, no. 1006 and 1007.

\[107\] Ibid., Quoted in Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, p. 102.

responsibility for protecting the planet. Referring to agriculture, he writes,
‘[agriculture] fits well with the importance of renewable resources for any kind
of sustainable civilisation.’ 108 And in regard to agriculture in the future he
maintains that:

> However, there is nothing to suggest that agriculture in the
> future will resemble that practised today. The emphasis in
> both the Bahá’í writings and the science of ecology on the
> importance of diversity suggests that new approaches to
> agriculture may involve diverse species maintained in
> harmony. We may evolve complex and efficient
> ecosystems with local communities as an integral part of
> human development.109

This is an optimistic view by Dahl and it is in line with Bahá’í thinking of
engaging local communities.

Bahá’í scholar and development expert Farzam Arbab studied the role of
agriculture in poverty alleviation. Since the majority of poor people in the world
live in rural areas,110 an analysis of reducing the poverty of villagers and helping
them to grow agricultural products and having a welfare program at the village
level is most appropriate. To achieve these, Arbab suggests a ‘new village
economy’. Outlining his thoughts, he writes:

> the strengths and weaknesses of their own past and present
> economic system and then move forward and build on

The concept of a village economy may seem idealistic and too simple to apply to
the complex issues of a global society. The problem is that the largest proportion
of people are currently living and predicted to be living in urban areas.
Nevertheless, the new village economy can work along with a number of
interrelated principles such as: providing education; creating equal opportunity for
both women and men; just and effective wealth distribution of the earth’s
resources; and willingness to adopt a more moderate lifestyle. The Bahá’í writings
advocate structures such as a village store 112 for the economy of a village.
However, the global economy is much more complex than a village economy.
Recognising this point, Arbab further clarifies that the new village economy
should be seen in the light of its contribution to a world economy.113 There is still
a need for more research in identifying different elements of a new village
economy as suggested by Arbab. The view presented in this research is that in any
alternative model of economics for the future, agriculture should play a major
role, which has been ignored mostly by the current dominant economic systems
such as the ‘command economy’114 and the ‘free market economy.’115

4\.8   Further analysis of sustainable consumption
Consumer sovereignty in a free market economy suggests that under perfect
competition, consumers drive the market; they express their needs and desires as a
demand, to which firms subsequently respond to by supplying them with the
goods and services that they require. This gives rise to the idea that consumers are
sovereign in the market. Traditionally customers were responsible for their own
purchasing with little influence from advertisements. However, today, producers
may target vulnerable consumers, who may not have sufficient information and
knowledge of commodities. Also, if the customer were really the king, businesses
would be developing, reinventing, and restructuring around the customer.
However, this is not happening. The fact that there are ‘consumer protection laws’
indicates that consumer sovereignty has limitation and they may not necessarily
be treated any more as sovereign.

Therefore, consumer sovereignty needs to be re-examined in connection with the
application of commodities. Economic thinking has conventionally distinguished
between public and private goods. However, the new concept of merit goods has
been introduced to the economic discipline. The term ‘merit goods’ implies that
the social benefits of consuming a product or a service are more than the private
benefits. Economics has generally challenged this new concept because it
interferes with consumer preference. The economic assumption of consumer
sovereignty states that consumers have the autonomy and power to make choices.
In the absence of consumer education, both moral and intellectual, consumer
sovereignty may lead to the consumption of demerit goods and services.
However, a study of the writings of Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í authors indicates that

the application of the concept of merit goods, with positive externality in the
economy, is unavoidable.

Economist James Buchanan, known for his ‘Public Choice Theory’, in his paper
entitled ‘Fairness, Hope, and Justice’ argues that economic justice is derived from
a sense of fairness. To influence this fairness, he focuses on the distribution of
rights and claims116 prior to the market process itself, rather than on some final
distribution of the product.117 Buchanan is aware of consumers being handicapped
due to their vulnerability and self-interest. Thus, he proposes intervention by
government prior to the market process. For example, he advocates the use of
taxation for public financing of compulsory education.118 This view supports the
Bahá’í notion of universal and compulsory education.

Examples of merit goods are not limited to only economic issues. Moral
philosopher Annette Baier argues the weaknesses of a system of ethics based on
the principle of justice. 119 The answer, according to Baier, is the use of the
principle of ‘care’ as an alternative for justice. For example, she argues that
women are more likely to have feelings of care, while men generally claim to take
the justice standpoint.120 According to her, there is a need to ensure that education
will prepare a person to be capable of conforming to ethics of care and

responsibility. 121   While Baier’s reasoning is not directly economic, she is
suggesting a normative framework of care that essentially influences the
individual’s preferences. Therefore, according to Baier, morality must be for all
people regardless of choice.122 Hence, the issue of care as a merit good must
become a part of the market economy. The principle of ‘care’ has been discussed
in the Bahá’í writings as well, and constitutes an important component for the
application of the principle of ‘world citizenship’. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has confirmed
that,

> If man were to care for himself only he would be nothing
> but an animal for only the animals are thus egoistic. …
> Nay, rather, man should be willing to accept hardships for
> himself in order that others may enjoy wealth; he should
> enjoy trouble for himself that others may enjoy happiness
> and well-being.123

Another argument for merit goods put forth by contemporary economist and
philosopher Amartya Sen is empowering women and their role in advancing the
economy. Sen describes the underdeveloped situation of women in South Asia,
West Asia, and China as unacceptable.124 Sen’s explanation is that women are
viewed as inferior due to their lack of productivity, useful employment or lack of
education. 125 The remedy he suggests is to endorse state funding of public
education and public policy that can work to improve the status of women in the
economy.126 Sen does not want to leave this situation to market mechanisms
because the market may fail to rectify effectively. Therefore, he prescribes the

interference of government to support the right of education for women. For Sen,
therefore, education and particularly the education of women, is considered as a
merit good, which at first does not appear to have anything to do with economics,
but on further review, one notes that it has an indirect but significant role in
economic development. The Bahá’í scriptures suggest that the inferior condition
of women is because of the lack of opportunity for women to acquire education
and other necessary qualifications. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states:

> Until the reality of equality between man and woman is
> fully established and attained, the highest social
> development of mankind is not possible. Even granted that
> woman is inferior to man in some degree of capacity or
> accomplishment, this or any other distinction would

> remedy is education, opportunity; for equality means equal
> qualification. …And let it be known once more that until
> woman and man recognize and realize equality, social and
> political progress here or anywhere will not be possible.127

In this passage, equal opportunity and women empowerment is considered by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá as a merit phenomenon with positive externality. Economist and
Nobel Prize laureate, Joseph E. Stiglitz, also supported merit goods. He
demonstrates the failure of market reforms in Russia. He argues that the transition
to a market economy lacked the institutional and legal infrastructure that it needed
to take firm root in Russian society.128 This argument is important because it
shows a clear departure from classical economics. According to Adam Smith, the
market automatically reaches equilibrium and there is no need of government
intervention. However, Stiglitz challenges this view and by referring to the failure
of market reform in Russia argues that there is a need for government intervention

and support from its financial, social, and organizational institutions.129 According
to Stiglitz the free market system cannot function alone on the basis of self-
interest.130 Therefore, to complement market mechanisms it must be regulated.
Hence, according to Stiglitz the provision of the institutional framework for a
market economy is considered as merit goods.131 Again, here the Bahá’í writings
are specific in relation to the regulation of the free market economy.

4\.9    Chapter conclusion
This chapter has attempted to do a survey of Bahá’í writings in understanding the
notion of sustainable consumption. In doing this research the Bahá’í and non-
Bahá’í authors’ views on a number of topics associated closely with the Bahá’í
belief are considered. The argument is presented that to achieve sustainable
consumption, it is not enough to develop values, they must also be implemented.
This requires effective action by individuals, families, organisations, and the
government. This is necessary because the market alone fails to achieve and
maintain sustainable consumption. The agents in a free market economy have the
goal of maximising profit, and consumers are looking at their own self-interest. In
such an environment there will be under-consumption of merit goods and over-
consumption of demerit goods, leading to misallocation of resources. In self-
interest a choice has to be made that would be the best one available for the
person. A Bahá’í view would be to make choices that promote social interest
rather than self-interest, choices that lead to an outcome that is the best for the

wider society. In this case making choices leads to an effective and efficient use
of resources, and distributes goods and services fairly, equitably, sensibly, and in
a sustainable way among members of society. It is therefore argued that consumer
education will greatly help consumers to make right choices. To achieve
sustainable consumption there is a need to influence supply and demand.
Consumer education on one hand, and acquiring and applying value principles on
the other, will enable a successful process. Hence, willingness to change life
style, and to control and modify excessive consumption is recommended. I have
upheld the view that the Bahá’í principle of moderation maintains a balance in the
material and spiritual life of individuals, and is a solution to the societal problem
of poverty. Furthermore, I considered consumer education as an important factor
influencing firms to produce goods and services that are sustainable and in
accordance with human dignity. On the practical side, the Bahá’í community can
have an impact on consumption, not only at individual and community level but
also indirectly towards the wider society. For example, it was argued that
achieving sustainability depends largely on consumer education and in particular
moral education. Consumer education enriches sustainable living. Bahá’í parents
are urged to instil moral values in children and prepare them for attaining a
sustainable life style by knowing the purpose of life.

With this chapter, the microeconomic aspect of the study and analysis of Bahá’í
teachings on economics for this research is concluded. In the next chapter, the
macroeconomic part of Bahá’í teachings will be discussed under the main heading
of ‘globalisation’ from a Bahá’í perspective.

Chapter 5: The Bahá’í Perspective on Globalisation
The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.1

Bahá’u’lláh

5\.1      Introduction
With the previous three chapters focusing mainly on the Bahá’í perspective on
microeconomic discussion, this chapter is aimed at the Bahá’í view on
macroeconomic teachings, primarily on globalisation and development. The
subject of globalisation has expanded considerably in 20th century and it now
covers a wide range of topics. The process of the globalisation of the Bahá’í
community started at its inception. The concept of ‘globalisation’ in the Bahá’í
literature began with Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of this faith. The phrases closely
associated with the concept of globalisation, which signify a holistic view of
humanity and organisation of human society, have been used repeatedly in the
primary Bahá’í scriptures. Examples include: ‘world order’ (‫ ﻧﻈﻢ ﺟﻬﮭﺎﻧﯽ‬- Nazm-i-
Jihání), ‘human race’ (‫ ﺍاﻫﮬﮪھﻞ ﻋﺎﻟﻢ‬- Ahl-i-'álam), ‘civilisation’ (‫ ﻣﺪﻧﻴﯿﺖ‬- madaniyat),
and ‘universal’ (‫ ﻋﻤﻮﻣﯽ‬- Umúmí).

In this chapter, an interpretation of the concept of ‘meaningful and enlightened
globalisation’ will be provided. The study of primary Bahá’í writings indicates a
positive outlook towards a meaningful globalisation. The aim is to explore the
concept of globalisation from a Bahá’í perspective as well as from a contemporary
economic view. It will be argued that government policies alone are not sufficient,
that there is a need for emerging values to shape and reform the process of current

\[1\] Bahá’u’lláh. Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 250.

globalisation. The view that the current process of globalisation has generated
unbalanced outcomes, both between and within countries, will be explored. It will
be argued that problems associated with the current form of globalisation are due
to the negative methods and processes adopted. It will be argued that there are
challenges and inconsistencies in human affairs in the current process of
globalisation. I will discuss the research question of how does the Bahá’í view on
globalisation differ from the one currently emerging? Also, there will be a
discussion on the distinctiveness of the Bahá’í approach on development as a
positive process towards globalisation.

5\.2      Unity of humankind – a prerequisite for Bahá’í globalisation
For Bahá’ís, an enlightened globalisation involves a firm belief in the principle of
unity of humankind (‫ ﻭوﺣﺪﺕت ﻋﺎﻟﻢ ﺍاﻧﺴﺎﻧﯽ‬- Vahdat Álam Insani). Unity of humankind
is, therefore, a key characteristic of this faith and is placed at the centre of the
Bahá’í inspired model of economic sustainability in chapter 7. Bahá’u’lláh
proclaims ‘The tabernacle of unity hath been raised; regard ye not one another as
strangers…’2 Studying the Bahá’í writings it becomes clear that the principle of
oneness encompasses much more than brotherly love and tolerance. Shoghi
Effendi clarifies that the oneness of humanity:

> …calls for no less than the reconstruction and the
> demilitarization of the whole civilized world—a world
> organically unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its
> political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and
> finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the
> diversity of the national characteristics of its federated

units.3

A number of statements clearly emphasise the meaning and significance of
globalisation in relation to unity of humankind, including phrases such as ‘the
well-being of mankind’4, ‘betterment of the world’5, ‘Let your vision be world-
embracing’6, and ‘The interdependence of the peoples and nations of the earth.’7
Similarly, Bahá’u’lláh uses metaphorical expressions such as ‘the entire human
race as one soul and one body’8, and ‘ye are the flowers of one garden.’9 He also
refers to the calamitous condition of the world, stating, ‘The world is
encompassed with misery and distress,’10 and ‘The world is in great turmoil.’11

A significant subject pertinent to globalisation that has been discussed by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the interdependence of people and nations. Frequently he
emphasises that ‘all the members of the human family, whether peoples or
governments, cities or villages, have become increasingly interdependent.’12 And
in a stronger statement he continued, ‘For none is self-sufficiency any longer
possible, inasmuch as political ties unite all peoples and nations, and the bonds of
trade and industry, of agriculture and education, are being strengthened every
day.’13 In light of above discussion, the following definition given by Suheil

International Development at University of Maryland, delivers an appropriate
description of globalisation from a Bahá’í perspective:

> Globalisation is a vision of world unity in so deep and
> broad a sense as to embrace every aspect of human life.
> Such a vision of planetary unity and integration, however,
> bears no relation to the often bland, faceless, and amoral
> global marketplace that we see operating today. Instead, it
> recognises and celebrates the rich diversity of creeds and
> cultures while at the same time affirming the fundamental
> oneness of the human race. The Bahá'í approach to
> globalisation can be summed up as a commitment to the
> concept of ‘unity in diversity’ and what this practically
> entails in the life of the individual and society alike.14

Bushrui refers to the fundamental Bahá’í principle of ‘world unity’15, and ‘unity in
diversity’16 as practical approaches to globalisation.

According to historian Joseph Kitagawa (1990) in the Quest for Human Unity,
ideas of the oneness of a globally united humanity have a rich and varied history,
reaching back to antiquity.17 The scriptures of major religions such as Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam have a vision of unity, which will be achieved through acts
of eschatological warfare and divine judgement.18

The analogy of family (chapter 1, section 1.4.5) has much wider implication in the

creation of unity within humankind. Such an enormous undertaking requires unity
within the family, as well as within the world’s societies, through spiritual and
material means. It compels individuals and nations to work together in harmony in
order to establish this unity. Today the effects of the gradual application of the
spirit of unity, such as the rejection of racial prejudices, the greater awareness of
the need to protect the environment, the acceptance of gender equality in many
societies, and the greater awareness of human rights, are apparent in the wider
society. Application of these would gradually lead to the oneness of humanity.

The goal of unity is possible because humanity has access to the means necessary
to attain it. For example, the revolutionary and world-embracing means of
communication, transportation, information technology and global financial
interdependency are available as methods of unifying nations. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
explains that in the past, ‘The unity of mankind could not have been achieved,’19
because the means of coming into contact that are currently available, were not
within reach during the past dispensation, thus, ‘…association and interchange of
thought were well-nigh impossible.’20 It is therefore clear that the features of
meaningful globalisation, which are oneness of humanity, interdependency, and
interchange of thoughts, could be facilitated through the use of advanced
information and technology. On the other hand, it is important to note that in some
cases the very means of uniting humanity can act as a dis-unifying force: for
example, information technology may also promote a faster spread of hate and
fear.

\[19\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 31.

\[20\] Ibid.

The question arises here that in what way are unity, economics, and globalisation
linked? Shoghi Effendi stated that: ‘...the oneness and wholeness of the entire
human race ... eliminates extremes of poverty and wealth.’21 The argument is that
when united, the individual and the society become more thoughtful and
compassionate towards each other and share economic resources more
generously. The ‘Bahá’í International Fund’ and many other charitable
organisations are a practical demonstration of this. The contributions to the Bahá’í
International Fund are spent for development projects around the world, wherever
needed. Such altruistic actions become meaningful when people have a sense of
connection to each other, partly due to their beliefs and partly due to human
nature, which has an innate capacity to be kind. Thus, a culture of ‘service’ and
‘voluntary charitable work’ is established in the Bahá’í community to facilitate
the process of removing poverty.

One may argue that unity is only possible within the Bahá’í community because
all its adherents believe in the same principles and values. An outsider may
wonder whether the principle of unity is actualised globally. The Bahá’í teachings
assert global unity and not only that of the Bahá’í community. This unity,
however, starts from within the Bahá’í community. The Universal House of
Justice, in its Promise of World Peace published in 1985, encourages the people
of the world to examine the Bahá’í communities around the world as an example
of what a united world would look like in the future.22 It is of course naive to think

\[21\] Shoghi Effendi. Promised Day is Come, p. v.

\[22\] Universal House of Justice, The Promise of World Peace, part IV. It is stated: ‘If the Bahá’í
experience can contribute in whatever measure to reinforcing hope in the unity of the human race,

that unity, whether within the Bahá’í community or in the wider society, will be
established without any difficulties or complications. Indeed, the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh provide the outline and the driving force for unity, but painstaking
efforts are needed at both individual and community levels to achieve it. The
Bahá’í institutions at the local, national and international levels help establish and
preserve the unity within the Bahá’í community, and work with individuals,
organisations and governments, as appropriate, to promote this unity outside of
the Bahá’í community as well. These are achieved through various community
and core activities such as observing Bahá’í Holy Days, children’s classes, youth
activities, encouraging women’s participation in social activities, and summer and
winter schools. As a community-building exercise the general public is actively
invited to participate in these activities and to work together with the Bahá’ís to
bring about unity. A sense of belonging to the community generates a willingness
in people to accept responsibility to help each other and to commit to the
development of the whole community. These collective actions can help diminish
economic difficulties within and outside the Bahá’í community.

On the practical level, Bahá’ís associate with people of all backgrounds in their
effort to follow Bahá’u’lláh’s exhortations, striving to create a globalisation that is
based on unity and love of humanity rather than factors such as economic and
political gain. Elaborating on this, William Hatcher and Douglas Martin write:

> We will arrive at unity, but rather by an increased
> awareness of and respect for the intrinsic value of each
> separate culture, and indeed, of each individual. It is not

we are happy to offer it as a model for study.’

> diversity itself, which is deemed the cause of conflict, but
> rather our immature attitude towards it, our intolerance
> and prejudice.23

The concept of ‘unity in diversity’ is the practical demonstration of unity that will
protect Bahá’í globalisation from uniformity. To attain this, consideration is given
by the Bahá’í community to teaching the concept of world citizenship as part of
the education of every child.

Fundamental to the understanding of world unity as an essential characteristic of
Bahá’í globalisation, is the statement of ‘It is not his to boast who loveth his
country, but it is his who loveth the world.’24 It may be argued that this statement
is contrary to one’s loyalty to one’s country. This would be true if the ability to
love was limited or love of one’s country would exclude love of the world. This
indeed is not accurate, as one’s ability to love is extremely vast and can extend far
beyond one’s love for one’s country; one does not exclude the other. On the
contrary, love and consideration extended to the whole world will include love of
one’s country and promote greater satisfaction and happiness. Bahá’u’lláh stated
that ‘Love of one’s country is an element of the faith of God.’ Referring to this
statement, Shoghi Effendi said that ‘The love of one’s country … has not …
either condemned or disparaged.’25 Shoghi Effendi further considers the love of
one’s country as ‘lesser loyalty’26 and love of humanity as ‘wider loyalty’27, and

states that ‘…a wider loyalty, should not … conflict with lesser loyalties.’28 This is
an easy task when a belief culture is created, but there are challenges when
applying this teaching in countries where there is rabid nationalism and at times
hatred for people of other nations. Ethnic cleansing which stems from only loving
one’s own country to the point of excluding all others is not an unfamiliar issue in
today’s society.

Commenting on one of the writings of the founder of the Bahá’í faith, Momen
writes:

> Bahá’u’lláh had laid down the necessary groundwork for
> the globalisation of the Bahá’í community…Bahá’u’lláh
> had emphasised in His writings the equality of all
> believers, of whatever level of education or social rank.
> He had spoken of all as being ‘created from the same dust’
> so that ‘no one should exalt himself over the other’ and
> hence that all should ‘be even as one soul, to walk with the
> same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same
> land, that from your inmost being, by your deeds and
> actions, the signs of oneness… may be made manifest.’29

When one supports unity, then it is easy to realise that an enlightened
globalisation involves a belief that the globalised world is indeed the norm, and
should be the reality of the human world. However, we live in a world where
conflict is considered a normal way of life. Contest, competition and
confrontation have become norms embedded in social, political, and economic
systems. The relationships between people are based on fear, hate and self-
interest. These are great barriers for establishing unity. There is a need to acquire
certain attitudes and behaviours that are necessary to promote unity. Members of

the Bahá’í community individually and collectively explore the actions essential
for fostering unity in the community, which are service orientated.

An enlightened globalisation for Jeffrey Sachs,30 the Director of the Earth Institute
and one who is an expert in sustainable development is one that,

> addresses the needs of the poorest of the poor, the global
> environment, and the spread of democracy. It is the kind
> of globalisation championed by the enlightenment –
> globalisation democracies, multilateralism, science and
> technology, and a global economic system designed to
> meet human needs.31

Sachs called this kind of globalisation as ‘an enlightened globalisation.’32 For
Joseph Stiglitz, an effective globalisation requires ‘new social contracts,’33 which
will be considered when ‘The well-being of the developed and developing
countries are better balanced.’ 34 If we define progressive civilisation as an
advancing social development and organisation, then issues such as materialism,
poverty, destruction of ecosystem, lack of respect for human rights, inequality,
war and conflicts are contrary to human social development, organisation and
civilisation. Consequently, from a Bahá’í perspective, a meaningful globalisation
refers to the elimination of those ‘social ills’35 and hindrances, which ‘Abdu’l-

Bahá suggested ‘the immediate remedy for all the ills of social life.’36 Shoghi
Effendi describes these social ills as a world ‘spiritually destitute, morally
bankrupt, politically disrupted, socially convulsed, economically paralysed’37 The
Bahá’í International Community has identified other social ills of our current
society including poverty, unemployment, social strife, over-consumption,
chauvinistic nationalism, war, and moral and spiritual apathy.38 Hence, although
advancement in information technology and communication has created immense
benefits for the humanity, the disadvantage of such advances is that ‘crisis quickly
become global.’39 The current global financial crisis from 2008 that started in
United States spread to Europe immediately, and to the rest of the world quickly
after that.

There are other factors that are important for reforming and reshaping the current
process of globalisation. Speaking on this, Stiglitz points out that reforming
globalisation is a matter of politics. According to him there are a number of issues
that need to be considered, including the prospects for unskilled workers and the
impact of globalisation on inequality; the democratic deficit in global economic
institutions, which weakens democracy even within developed countries; and the
human tendency to think locally while we live in an increasingly global economy.

concept. Usually, internationalisation refers to trade activities that take place with
more than one country.40 In contrast globalisation include all matters that affect
the planet earth.        Simon Reich identifies four perspectives on globalisation:
historical/political; cultural/sociological; technological/spatial; and finally an
economic phenomenon. 41 For Joseph Stiglitz globalisation is also multi-
dimensional and encompasses the international flow of ideas and knowledge, the
sharing of cultures, global civil society, and global environmental movements.42
Moojan Momen has named five groupings of globalisation: normative,
psychological, financial, institutional and universalism.43 For Shapour Rassekh the
multi-dimension         of     globalisation       includes:      geographical,        demographic,
technological, educational, cultural, economics, and environmental.44 The author
of this research upholds the view that the more detailed the dimensions, the more
successful is the process of establishing a meaningful globalisation in the long
run. Therefore, I have identified the following twenty two dimensions of
globalisation: economic, financial, political, cultural, educational, technological
and information technology, marketing, ecological, global resource use,
developmental, governance, institutional, human rights, military and disarmament,
democracy, weight and measurement, currency, language, global division of
labour, Industrial development, ideological, and global ethics. It can be
maintained that these different dimensions of globalisation are closely connected

to each other and intertwined with the question of values.

There is a great emphasis by some religious and social movements toward
globalisation and global issues. For Juan Cole, the religious movements concerned
with globalisation have tended to be either liberal or conservative. Cole argues
that ‘Liberal religious groups often attempt to accommodate the social changes
provoked by globalisation as far as possible in the framework of their traditions,
concentrating on charitable work and social justice.’45 Hence, there is a great
effort by religious and social movements to associate themselves with
globalisation and global issues. Since the early 1990s, economists have been using
dimensions of globalization with reference to the phenomenal growth in
international trade and investment.46 Non-economist scholars, however, have a
broader view of the term. For example, David Held argues that globalisation ‘is
not a singular, linear narrative, nor is it just a matter of economics. It is cultural as
well as commercial and in addition it is legal: it is about power as much as
prosperity or the lack of it.’ 47 Similarly, Anthony Giddens argues that
globalisation encompasses more than an international integration of economies.
He writes, ‘Globalization is really about the transformation of space and time. I
define it as action at distance, and relate its intensifying over recent years to the
emergence of means of instantaneous global communication and mass

transportation.’48 For Frank Lechner and John Boli globalisation refers to ‘the
processes by which more people across large distances become connected in more
and different ways.’49 Similarly, Ronald Robertson, who was the first author to use
the term globalisation in the title of a sociological article in 1985, describes
globalisation as ‘the compression of the world and the intensification of the
consciousness of the world as a whole. … The overall process by which the entire
world becomes increasingly interdependent, so as to yield a single place.’50 These
writers and scholars are in agreement that globalisation is more than just limited
to economics and finance, it has multi-dimensional phenomenon.

Shoghi Effendi in 1931 wrote that the world is ‘…contracted and transformed into
a highly complex organism by the marvellous progress achieved in the realm of
physical science, by the worldwide expansion of commerce and industry.’51 He
also said, ‘The world is contracted into a neighbourhood’52 Similarly, Malcolm
Waters not only envisions a ‘world society’ but a ‘diverse’ one, according to him,
in ‘a globalised world there will be a single society and culture occupying the
planet.’ 53 Similarly, Shoghi Effendi describes the world as ‘organically unified in
all the essential aspects of its life’ [that is] ‘yet infinite in the diversity of the
national characteristics of its federated units.’54 Consequently, as Zaid Lundberg
points out, although Shoghi Effendi did not use the term globalisation, he
described it as a multi-dimensional phenomenon; contraction or compression of

the world; major transition or transformation; moving towards a single world
society, yet diversified; co-dependent or interdependent society. 55 Hence, the
modern scholars appear to be in agreement with Shoghi Effendi’s description.

Robertson, also, proposed four basic dimensions of globalisation: society, the
individual, the international system, and the emergent categories of the human.
Commenting on Robertson’s proposition Juan Cole has outlined ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
conception of the four dimensions of globalisation described by Robertson: I)
Society: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was very much concerned with the development of the
Iranian society. He was concerned with the need to transform the Qajár
government       (chapter 1 section 1.7) into a modern Iranian national society.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá acknowledged that in the late nineteenth century Europe and the
Americas were renowned for their ‘law and order, government and commerce, art
and industry, science, philosophy and education’56 to which he believed Iran must
aspire. He also argued that society is in need of practical steps such as the
implementation of the law, parliamentary democracy, separation of religion and
state, and religious tolerance. 57 II) The individual: The construction of the
individual as a person in the context of globalism is a central concern of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. He said ‘…by man is meant the perfect individual, who is like unto a mirror
in which the divine perfections are manifested and reflected.’58 He advocated that
all be educated for ethical and intellectual progress. III) The international system:
‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke a great deal about the sort of international system he wished

to see in an era of globalisation. He began discoursing on these matters in his The
Secret of Civilisation in 1875, where he argued that Europe’s material civilisation
of the nineteenth century had become unbalanced and had come to pose a danger
to the world because it had not been accompanied by similar advances in spiritual
civilisation. IV) The emergent categories of the human development: ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá sees the emergence of the world as a single place as a quintessentially
modern development, made possible by profound technological and social
changes. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá points out that in the early twentieth century it was easy
for everyone ‘to travel to every land, to associate and exchange views with its
peoples, and to become familiar, through publications, with the conditions,
religious beliefs and the thoughts of all nations.’59

In all the above concepts and definitions of globalisation there is an association
between the writings of scholars and the Bahá’í thinking, which is about human
relationships, exchange of thoughts, prosperity of all nations, and effective
communication.

5\.4    Principles for advancing meaningful globalisation
The Bahá’í teachings on globalisation are numerous. A limited number of these
principles are discussed here. These principles directly and indirectly facilitate the
process of a meaningful globalisation. It is important to note that Bahá’í teachings
are interdependent, and in any Bahá’í discussion, including globalisation, the
totality of the Bahá’í faith needs to be considered.

\[59\] Juan Cole. ‘Globalisation and Religion in the thought of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’, Bahá’í globalisation,
ed., pp. 58-68, at p. 62.

5\.4.1    Universal and compulsory education
One of the social teachings that can have a positive effect in the process of
forming a meaningful globalisation is the application of ‘universal and
compulsory education’ (‫ ﺗﻌﻠﻴﯿﻢ ﻭو ﺗﺮﺑﻴﯿﺖ ﻋﻤﻮﻣﯽ ﻭو ﺍاﺟﺒﺎﺭرﯼی‬- ta'lím va tarbíyat-i-umumi va
ijbárí). There is recognition that education is a basic human right, such as the
United Nations Charter of Human Rights, and the Council of European Charter on
Education. In the Ridván message of the Universal House of Justice 2006, it is
referred to: ‘concern for human rights to the systematic pursuit of universal
education. An all-inclusive approach to addressing social and economic issues
will become the norm when children and youth receive similar education, both
quantitative and qualitative.60 Education and training and skill learning are also an
important part of economic development. This principle is the most important
factor in increasing the potential of a country’s population. According to
economic development scholar Michael Todaro, a major factor in determining the
success of an economy is the level of education and training provided to its
citizens. 61 In a global market economy in which countries and organisations
struggle to have effective communication, education and training is an effective
tool for these accomplishments. For example, by introducing universal primary
education in Uganda and Bangladesh in 1997, the initial results show an
improvement in economic development, a decline in the unemployment rate, a

\[60\] Education in the Bahá’í writings is seen as being of three kinds: moral, intellectual and spiritual.

For the full discussion of three different types of education see: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered
Questions, pp. 8-13.

\[61\] Todaro, Economic Development, 7th ed., New York: Addison Wesley Ltd., 2000, p. 343.

decline in poverty, and an increase in productivity.62 The argument given by
Todaro is that the marginal social benefit of providing compulsory basic
education is more than a marginal social cost.63 The social advantages not only
include material benefits, but also removal of different kinds of prejudices such as
religious, ethnic, racial, and economic that are barriers to attaining a meaningful
globalisation. The argument in the Bahá’í writings is that ‘prejudices of any kind
are the destroyers of human happiness and welfare.’ 64 Hence the spread of
universal and compulsory education eliminates all kinds of prejudices and creates
a smooth process for reforming current globalisation.

Universal education and training will increase the capacity and productivity of the
population and facilitate the movement of labour from countries with a surplus of
skilled labour to countries with shortages. The Bahá’í community of Iran is a good
example. From its very inception, it invested heavily in education by establishing
schools for boys and girls. Commenting on this, Momen writes:

> Education and literacy, especially of women, continued to
> be of prime concern to the Bahá’í community. After the
> Bahá’í schools were closed by government order in 1934,
> the Bahá’ís continued to hold moral education classes
> (dars-i-akhláq) on Fridays. By 1973 the Bahá’í

> among Bahá’í women under forty years of age.65

Education can influence the future form and direction of a country and its position
in the global perspective. It also determines the rate of Gross Domestic Product,

which measures the level of economic growth and standard of living of a country.
Education, apart from affecting the national income, provides other opportunities
for society. Todaro discusses a number of opportunities that education can offer to
a country, including creating a more productive labour force and endowing it with
increased knowledge and skills; providing widespread employment and income-
earning opportunities for all kinds of jobs; creating a class of educated leaders in
government services, and private and public corporations; and providing the kind
of training and education that would promote literacy and basic skills for
population control. Hence, investing more into education and training provides an
attractive opportunity, which has a direct impact on improving economic
performance. The economic returns from extra investment in education of the
lower income group in developing countries will be substantial. The positive
opportunities and accomplishments achieved through education will create the
necessary conditions for a smoother process of attaining a meaningful
globalisation.

It is not possible to discuss the relationship between education and development
without explicitly linking the structure of the educational system to the economic
and social character of a country. An educational system accordingly reflects the
essential nature of a society. For Todaro ‘If the society is non-egalitarian in
economic and social structure, the educational system will probably reflect that
bias in terms of who is able to proceed through the system.’66 In modern times, an
example of a society being non-egalitarian in economic and social structure is
religious persecution. Religious persecution is a great barrier to the development

\[66\] Todaro. Economic Development, p. 342.

of the human resources necessary for growth and the advancement of the
community and the nation.67 For example, the absence of equality, opportunity and
human rights in Iran are barriers for Bahá’í youths to have access to education.
Since 1979, the government of Iran has created barriers for Bahá’í pupils to enter
higher educational institutions. 68 Such government actions may cause young
Bahá’ís to lack the necessary schooling and training to be able to contribute to the
advancement of their communities and development of the country.69

The non-egalitarian character of the social structure of certain societies, such as
religious discrimination, absence of human rights, lack of opportunities for
education, are obvious challenges facing a meaningful globalisation. Active
participation in community life is highly valued and is one of the components of a
meaningful globalisation. Social exclusions related to poverty, unemployment,
education, and different kinds of discrimination are obvious barriers to
participating in community activities.70 Therefore, if the absence of a fair social
system effectively denies educational opportunities for a group of people, then the
system can even increase inequality in the country, which then affects other

Bahá’í Question: Cultural Cleansing in Iran,’ New York: United Nations Office, 2008.

\[69\] On the expulsion of Bahá’ís from public employment Momen writes, ‘In 1979 a large number of
Bahá’ís in Iran were in public employment. Since the Bahá’í faith emphasizes the importance of
education, a sizeable proportion of the Bahá’í community was in professions requiring a high level
of education. Furthermore, certain areas of public service such as health and education are
favoured by Bahá’ís in view of what the Bahá’í scriptures say about these professions. Momen:

countries.

A similar situation is possible in countries where the poor may not have access to
education because the educational systems are inherently non-egalitarian.
Educational economist John Simmons gives the following sketch of how the poor
are beginning to regard education:

> Schooling, the poor quickly learn, in most countries, is an
> escape from poverty for only a few. The poor are the first
> to drop out because they need to work, the first to be
> pushed out because they fall asleep in class as a result of
> malnourishment, and the first to fail their French and
> English tests because upper income children have had
> better opportunities at home. The hope brought to village
> parents by the construction of the primary school soon
> fades. Enough schooling to secure a steady, even menial
> job for their son, let alone for their daughter, seems just
> beyond their grasp. Before… any schooling would have
> done to achieve their aspiration. Now a primary school
> certificate is needed, and some are saying that even
> students with some secondary schooling cannot get a
> steady job, and they could never afford to send their son
> away to town for secondary schooling.71

This view indicates that in the situations described by Simmons,
students from a lower income group are not given an equal
opportunity to complete any given level of education.

5\.4.2    The view on world citizenship
The concept of ‘world citizen’72 (‫ ﺍاﻫﮬﮪھﻞ ﻋﺎﻟﻢ‬- ahl-i-‘álam) appears in the Bahá’í
writings frequently and gives a clearer understanding of the Bahá’í approach to
attaining a meaningful globalisation. In the Bahá’í community the concept of
being world citizens is instilled in children so to broaden their love for the whole
world and all the people in it, rather than for only one group of people. The
Universal House of Justice states, ‘In keeping with the requirements of the times,
consideration should also be given to teaching the concept of world citizenship as
part of standard education of every child.’73 Such a mission, according to the
Bahá’í International Community, should begin with the acceptance of the
interconnectedness of the nations: ‘While it [world citizenship] encourages a sane
and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity
as a whole.’ 74

The concept of ‘world citizenship’ encompasses the principles of social and
economic justice at all levels of society, including ‘equality of the sexes; racial,
ethnic, national and religious harmony. …Promotion of human honour and
dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the
desire to serve...’75 The Bahá’í community is learning how to practice and promote
‘world citizenship’ effectively. Several factors must be considered by individual
Bahá’ís, such as the responsibility of putting the interests of the world before

one’s own, commitment to the whole world as one’s own home, accountability for
one’s actions, preserving nature, and serving the common good. These are some
of the challenges faced, as world citizenship requires individuals to reach beyond
their own self to be a true world citizen.

5\.4.3    The institution of the Nineteen-Day Feast
As discussed earlier, Bahá’í globalisation is based on the principle of unity.
Bahá’ís work towards community building at local level, as unity starts at the
grass roots through individual efforts, concerted community efforts and the
institutions of the faith. At the core of Bahá’í community life is the Nineteen-Day
Feast, 76 held every nineteen days. The Local Spiritual Assembly 77 has the
responsibility of organising these gatherings in their own specific area of
jurisdiction. Each individual Bahá’í has the responsibility of working toward unity
through his or her behaviours, actions and lifestyle. The Nineteen Day Feast is a
good example of the close relationship of the individual, the community and the
institutions, where all Bahá’ís in the area, regardless of their socio-economic
status and educational achievements gather together to worship, discuss the
community’s progress, and consult about possible ways to build the community.
These discussions and recommendations are then taken to the Local Spiritual
Assembly, where they will be consulted on further and a plan of action prepared

\[76\] The Bahá’í year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days), with the addition of
“Intercalary Days” (four in ordinary and five in leap years) between the eighteenth and nineteenth
months which adjusts the calendar to the solar year. The months are named after the attributes of
God. Each Bahá’í community holds a Nineteen Day Feast on the first day of each Bahá’í month.
The Feast has spiritual, administrative and social functions and is the principal gathering of
Bahá’ís of a particular locality. Retrieved: http://www.bahai.us/welcome/principles-and-
practices/bahai-calendar/>, [accessed: 26/01/ 2012].

Aqdas verse 30, The Bahá’í Faith: Hatcher and Martin, pp. 133-137, Understanding the Bahá’í
Faith, Wendi Momen and Moojan Momen, pp. 109-120.

for the local Bahá’í community. This will allow involvement from the grassroots
in the exercise of community building and bringing about unity. These local
gatherings encourage an individual-initiative attitude in Bahá’ís to be involved in
development activities, adding to the capacity of a village, city or town. For
example, Shoghi Effendi, in his letters to the Bahá’í community of the United
States, stresses the importance of the duties of Local Spiritual Assemblies in ‘the
maintenance of unity and capacity of community action …through the Nineteen
Day Feasts and other local meetings.’78 The holding of these gatherings is to bind
hearts together. These gatherings are referred to as feasts, as they provide for the
spiritual and physical needs of the community. They contain three parts,
devotional, administrative and social. The spiritual part consists of reading and
reciting from the Holy Scriptures, which then prepares the attendees to consult on
the needs of the community and the progress of its plans during the administrative
part, which is then followed by the social part when the Bahá’ís partake of some
form of refreshment together, even if it is just water. The holding of thousands of
such Feasts around the world with objectives such as ‘unity in diversity’, ‘world
citizenship’, ‘democratic method of decision-making’, ‘respecting the local
cultures’, and ‘being free from all kinds of prejudices’ is a practical way of
learning and practising a meaningful globalisation.

5\.4.4       The institution of Bahá’í marriage
This is another principle that helps maintain unity within the Bahá’í community.
As discussed earlier (chapter 1, section 1.4.5), family is the basic unit of society.
Unless this all-important building block is healthy and cohesive, society cannot be

\[78\] Shoghi Effendi. Bahá’í World Journal, vol. 5, 1976, p. 74.

healthy and unified. The foundation of a successful and healthy family is the
preparation for union as an essential element of a happy marriage. Bahá’u’lláh
said marriage is ‘a fortress for well-being and salvation.’79 He not only permits but
also keenly encourages Bahá’ís to marry with people of any belief or cultural,
ethnic and racial background, and with no consideration of social class and
wealth. Marriage is to ensure not only unity between the couple but also between
the two families, and even different communities and cultures, such as in mixed
marriages.

Mixed marriages, although challenging in some ways, enable individuals and
families to learn about and respect each other’s cultures, a phenomenon that
would have an effect on globalisation. Despite the challenges, mixed marriages
have the potential to remove national, cultural and religious barriers in the long
run and improve communication between the parties. In theory, children raised in
such families develop a broader view of the world, with a positive attitude of
respect and effective communication with different cultures.

Studying the Bahá’í writings, one notes that the founder of the faith calls the
entire humanity to participate in a number of principles as part of achieving
meaningful globalisation. The exploration of the following four principles is of
special interest to this topic.

5\.4.5 A universal language and script
Having effective communication among citizens of the world is a necessary

\[79\] Bahá’u’lláh. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, note 88.

requirement for achieving a meaningful globalisation. Language barriers cause
poor communication. In a global society with free movement of people across
nations, one common language helps to remove barriers and misunderstandings.
Bahá’u’lláh in 1873 called for an international auxiliary language and script as a
tool for effective global communication among people and nations. The term
‘auxiliary’ suggests that it is intended to be an additional language rather than
replacing native languages. 80 Addressing leaders of the world, he states, ‘O
members of parliaments throughout the world! Select ye a single language for the
use of all on earth, and adopt ye likewise a common script.’81 The Bahá’í writings
have not suggested any specific language. The proposition is that representatives
of all nations will make a decision about the creation of a new language or
choosing one from among the existing languages.

An international language is one of the major tools of effective communication in
the modern world, particularly as the process of international trade and global
travel advances. Such a language may remove the need for a middleman between
producers of products in rural areas and the final consumers. Producers and
farmers in developing countries in particular, would benefit from an international
language to make trade easier and fairer in a global market. It would also allow
consumers and producers of developing nations to be able to negotiate and settle
costs and prices, which could be more favourable to both parties and at times

\[80\] According to the writings of Bahá’u’lláh the process of selecting an international language will
be in two stages. Commenting on this, the Universal House of Justice writes:
The first stage is to consist of the selection of an existing language or an invented one, which
would then be taught in all the schools of the world as an auxiliary to the mother languages. The
governments of the world through their parliaments are called upon to effect this momentous
enactment. The second stage, in the distant future, would be the eventual adoption of one single
language and common script for all on earth. (See: The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, note 193.)

\[81\] Bahá’u’lláh. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, verse 189.

without a need for an intermediary.

Of course, the selection and implementation of an international language is not
without challenges. How a decision is made for the selection of a common
language may indeed prove difficult. Furthermore, there may be a risk of
extinction of rare languages. This risk may not be noticeable in the short run
because people are enjoying the advantages of effective communication, while
benefiting from improved international trade, tourism, and other benefits
associated with easier access to advanced technology and innovation. But the risk
of disappearance becomes more obvious in the long run as people frequently use
the international language. We are already witnessing the disappearance of a
number of languages. It is estimated that ‘About two thousand rare languages [out
of an approximate existing 7000] will disappear in one hundred years.’82 Another
risk of adopting an international language is in relation to people’s identity. A
particular language demonstrates a particular group’s culture, identity and
heritage, which the Bahá’í teachings hope to preserve as part of the unity in
diversity. Therefore, it would be important for the members of parliaments
throughout the world when selecting a common language, to pay particular
attention to preventing the extinction of minority languages in future. Whether the
introduction of an international language will be effective or not depends on its
cost and benefits. Otherwise the speed of globalisation makes it necessary for
people to become multilingual.

5\.4.6   Universal peace
A key barrier to a meaningful globalisation is war and internal conflicts, as they
not only result in a waste of resources but also create tension and separation
among citizens of the world. Conflicts greatly contribute to loss of human life and
wastage and destruction of natural resources, including the non-renewable ones.
These can cause setbacks particularly for the poorer parts of the world. For
example, a high level of military spending affects the citizens’ quality of life by
limiting spending on developmental and social programs. However, it can be
argued that for some nations war and conflict lead to arms production, and the
export of armaments boosts the domestic economies, including job creation.
These issues are of major concern in the Bahá’í writings. In one of his writings
addressed to ‘Rulers and Monarchs’ 83 of the world Bahá’u’lláh said, ‘They
[sovereigns] must put away the weapons of war, and turn to the instruments of
universal reconstruction.’84 Waste of resources is one of the most pressing issues
for economists and the Bahá’í writings strongly discourage any wastage of
resources, human and physical. But what are the ‘instruments of universal
reconstruction’? The amount spent on war can be diverted to, for example,
different forms of public services, such as education and health, research and
progress of sciences and arts, for improving people’s lives.

But what is the interest of economists in studying peace? Some of the important
assumptions and objectives of companies are related to cost minimisation, profit

\[83\] The chosen kings and rulers of the earth whom Bahá’u’lláh addressed include: Napoleon III,
Queen Victoria, Kaiser Wilhelm I, Tsar Alexander II, the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef, the
Ottoman Sultan ‘Abdu’l-‘Aziz and the Qajar Monarch Násiri’d-Dín Sháh. See: The Proclamation
of Bahá’u’lláh, Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre Publications, 2nd ed., 1972.

maximisation, and utility maximisation. During a period of war resources are
destroyed, which adds to the cost of production. In theory, economics is also
concerned about the cost of starting a new war – not only the cost to taxpayers,
but also the possible effect on the economy, on oil prices, on the stock market, on
inflation and unemployment, and on the standard of living. The concern is about
the opportunity cost of resources allocated to war, in both real value and monetary
value, including rebuilding cities after the war. If we define economics in terms of
efficiency, then it is concerned with how well resources, such as human, physical,
time, and technology, are used to produce an end result. Consequently, war,
conflict and violence are not helping to protect resources. In the statement below
Shoghi Effendi outlines the immense opportunity cost related to the waste of
resources. He also recognises the associated benefits resulting from saving
resources:

> The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war,
> whether economic or political, will be consecrated to such
> ends as will extend the range of human inventions and
> technical development, to the increase of the productivity
> of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the
> extension of scientific research, to the raising of the
> standard of physical health, to the sharpening and
> refinement of the human brain, to the exploitation of the
> unused and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the
> prolongation of human life, and to the furtherance of any
> other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral,
> and spiritual life of the entire human race.85

The economic implications of this statement are the inherent opportunity costs for
government spending on defence. Considering resource scarcity, money that is
spent in one area cannot be spent in another.

\[85\] Shoghi Effendi. The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 204.

The establishment of universal peace (‫ ﺻﻠﺢ ﻋﻤﻮﻣﯽ‬- sulh-i-‘umúmí) in a global
society fosters both individual and collective well-being and security, and this is
at the heart of the Bahá'í vision for a meaningful globalisation. Addressing the
leaders of the world, the founder of the faith said, ‘Compose your differences, and
reduce your armaments, that the burden of your expenditures may be lightened,
and that your minds and hearts may be tranquilised.’86 During a period of peace,
there is more chance that resources will be allocated more effectively in areas that
are needed for the people’s quality of life. A conscientious government at
peacetime spends most of its resources in pursuing plans that benefit their
citizens.

5\.4.7   Free and fair international trade
Although globalisation and free trade are beneficial to those who are equipped to
compete in the international marketplace, they are less so for those not able to be a
part of the global market. It is no exaggeration to say that the world market is now
led by a handful of multinational corporations, which produce a substantial level
of the world’s total output.87 The division in the human family between ‘the haves
and the have-nots’ has assumed a new dimension. Thomas Picketty presents a
body of empirical data covering several hundred years that supports his central
idea in his book (Capital in the Twenty-First Century) that the owners of capital
accumulate wealth more quickly than those who provide labour, a phenomenon

companies listed on its 54 member bourses reached $51.225 trillion at the end of January 2005, up

widely described with the term ‘The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.’88
Hence, previously it was mainly ‘poor get poorer, rich get richer’, and now it is
‘the increasing gap between the rich and the poor.’89 The Bahá’í writings refer to
this condition as ‘some who were possessed of an affluent fortune and lived in the
midst of excessive riches, while others were in dire want and abject poverty.’90

The Bahá’í teachings on economics are consistent with the belief that ‘The earth
is but one country, and mankind its citizens.’ 91 This statement supports
international trade. The establishment of a free and fair trade among nations is an
important pillar of globalisation. A meaningful globalisation, however, is closely
associated with a sustainable international trade that is fair to both developing and
developed countries, and preserves the eco-system. Sustainable international trade
has a significant role in establishing universal benefits:

realistic is such mutual exchange. For examples, issues related to protectionism93,
currency fluctuations, quality of goods and services, and price levels may affect
trade or become barriers for a free and fair trade. It can also be argued that the
level of protectionism can be decreased with a regulated international market.
Shoghi Effendi supports this view when referring to a free market economy.94

A number of references in the Bahá’í writings have favoured the free market
economy, though it is suggested that such a system needs to be adjusted, regulated
and even restricted. Nevertheless, any arrangement for the economics of the future
associated with a meaningful globalisation must incorporate justice and fairness
for all humanity. Supporting the free market economy, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has, for
example, encouraged the ‘promotion of the arts, the discovery of new wonders,
the expansion of trade, and the development of industry.’95 He also approves of
profit sharing (chapter 3, section 3.7.3), which is a form of profit making, as a
feature of the market economy. Bahá’u’lláh has sanctioned the charging of
interest on financial loans as apart of a normal business transaction, provided that
this is done ‘with fairness and moderation’96 on the understanding that the matter
will be adjusted and regulated by the head of the Bahá’í faith, the Universal
House of Justice. Also, the principle that pay differentials should reflect different
levels of skill, ability and talent is strongly upheld, both as a reward and an
incentive for high levels of performance and productivity. Shoghi Effendi states
that the Bahá’í faith in the future will maintain the ‘right balance between the two

systems’97 of capitalism and socialism. He states:

Therefore, the Bahá’í economic system of the future will consider the advantages
of both a ‘free market economy’ and socialism,99

In relation to international trade in The Secret of Divine Civilisation, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá strongly urges Iranians to ‘look to the expansion of trade with the nations of
the East and the West, develop … natural resources and increase the wealth of
…people.’100 This is significant because traditionally, developed countries and
multinational companies have often seen developing countries as a source of
cheap natural resources that could be used by developed countries in the
production of goods. The focus has now shifted and a number of developing
countries are using advanced technology and know-how.                          The movement of
manufacturing to the developing world has allowed them to improve their
comparative advantage101 and attain a relative prosperity. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also called
upon the Iranians to learn ‘…modern concepts, …new systems and procedures,

…progressive enterprises…’ [from] ‘the people of Europe.’102 Moreover, He urged
them to follow Japan because ‘Japan has opened its eyes and adopted the
techniques of contemporary progress and civilisation.’103 Although these writings
are addressed to the citizens of Iran, the comments have universal implication.

However, in practice, there are a number of restrictions or barriers to a free and
fair international trade, such as protectionist measures, which protect the national
economy and include tariff and subsidy, and a more regulated import-export
market. Shoghi Effendi has condemned restrictions on international free trade.
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the USA, in an effort to protect its
economy, increased import duties to record levels. In 1931, in the midst of the
Great Depression, Shoghi Effendi wrote,

> A narrow and brutal nationalism, which the post-war
> theory of self-determination has served to reinforce, has
> been chiefly responsible for the policy of high and
> prohibitive tariffs, so injurious to the healthy flow of

Therefore, it is argued that globalisation is largely the result of the integration of
many countries through free trade, into a single global economy. The extent to
which a country can be integrated into the global economy depends on the level of
restrictions on the movement of resources into and out of the country. Shoghi
Effendi said, ‘…economic barriers and restrictions will be completely
abolished.’105

So far we have established that from a purely economic perspective, a sustainable,
fair and free international trade is essential for a meaningful globalisation.
However, according to Sen, the distribution of the benefits of global relations not
only depends on domestic policies but also on a variety of international social
arrangements. According to Sen these arrangements include,

> Trade agreements, patent laws, global health initiatives,
> international educational provisions, facilities for
> technological dissemination, ecological and environmental
> restraint, treatment of accumulated debts, and the
> restraining of conflicts and local wars.106
Such an arrangement becomes possible when, according to Jeffrey Sache ‘the
economic benefits of globalisation are distributed fairly and justly among the
citizens of the world.107 Thus, morality plays an important role in establishing a
meaningful globalisation. Rassekh and Speir specify that ‘Since economic
globalisation affects the economic lives of people, it has moral implications that
often take centre stage in any discussion on globalisation.’108 Bahá’u’lláh, in the
following passage, elucidates the importance of truthfulness and trustworthiness
in trade, he states, ‘Commerce is as a heaven, whose sun is trustworthiness and
whose moon is truthfulness. The most precious of all things in the estimation of
Him Who is the Sovereign Truth is trustworthiness.’109 Therefore, Bahá’í writings
strongly encourage Bahá’ís to practise trade with the highest standard of conduct.
As pointed out by Wilkinson and Pickett ‘we can think of trust as an important
marker of the ways in which greater material equality can help to create a

cohesive co-operative community, to the benefit of all.’110 The difficulty with the
current free market economy is not so much with the system itself but with the
absence of moral incentives to establish trust. It is noteworthy that Adam Smith,
in 1759 in The Theory of Moral Sentiment established his model of ‘free market
economy’ on the foundation of a human code of conduct that consists of
benevolence. It seems that this aspect of Smith’s model is somewhat missing from
the market today. The Bahá’í writings advocate the regulation and necessary
adjustment of the current form of free market economy.

5\.4.8       An international single currency
In 1936, Shoghi Effendi wrote about the universal single currency in The world
order of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘...a uniform and universal system of currency...will
simplify and facilitate intercourse and understanding among the nations and races
of mankind.’111 A universal single currency would be much like an international
language, which facilitates and improves communication around the world, and
the international trade. Hence, the Bahá’í writings support the notion of having an
international single currency for improving a fairer trade among nations.

The financial crisis in Europe from 2008 and particularly the Euro currency crisis
may immediately raise a concern that the idea of introducing an international
single currency may not be as promising as it appeared to be. By looking at the
Euro zone’s economic condition since 2008, the opponents of a single currency
may argue that the idea of single currency is not working. The United Kingdom

government, for example, oppose the European single currency on the basis on the
separation of monetary112 and fiscal113 policies. The argument in this section is that
the dis-functioning of a single currency is not due to currency itself but to the
management, administration, control and organisational skills of those who are
operating it. This dissertation supports that having an international single currency
is advantageous to a global economy. The current economic imbalances resulting
from currency fluctuations are not advantageous to any country. Joseph Stiglitz
addressed the issue of global financial imbalances that it ‘simply can not go on
forever.’ 114 He, then, argues that ‘Underlying the current imbalances are
fundamental structural problems with the global reserve system, [here Stiglitz
refers to ideas of John Maynard Keynes of how to reform the global monetary
system] including creating a new reserve system based on a new international
currency, can, with a little work, be adapted to today’s economy.115 The problem
of the global financial system, therefore, is systematic and has much to do with
the global reserve system, which improves global stability in the financial market.
Supporting Keynes view about a new international currency, Stiglitz argues that
‘It would enhance global stability and global equity.’116

One lesson learned from the current global financial crisis is that due to increased
capital mobility and economic interdependency, the occurrence of one financial

crisis in one part of the world can have devastating effect on other parts of the
world. Following the crisis we see more coordinated action between Central
Banks, and this will increase in the coming year, the reason of the structure of our
economies. According to international financial economists Charles Wyplosz and
Richard Maldwin in an Optimal Currency Area,117 where a group of countries are
better off with a common currency than keeping separate national currencies; and
also, where there is labour and capital mobility, the single currency takes away the
risk of exchange fluctuation and associated costs. Wyplosz and Maldwin writes:

> For the business community and private sector it is very
> advantageous to take the risk our exchange out of the their

Wyplosz and Maldwin’s idea is appropriate for a global economy where there is a
need for transparency simpler transaction. There is also unpredictability and
volatility of exchange rates. Favouring an international single currency, Morrison
Bonpasse argues that using a single currency can eliminated such volatility:

replaced with a Single Global Currency.119

Agreeing with Bonpasse, Joseph Stiglitz argued that ‘Economists might like to
believe that economic forces underlie all prices, but the prices of national
currencies, at least are determined as much by politics as by economics.’120

The global financial crisis of 2008 was universal and affected both developed and
developing countries. Looking at the crisis and relating it to the currency situation,
Joseph Stiglitz wrote, ‘There is a remarkably simple solution, one which was
recognized long ago by Keynes: the international community can provide a new
form of fiat money to act as reserves, (Keynes called his new money ‘bancor’).’121
Stiglitz called them ‘global greenbacks’, which are similar to the Special Drawing
Rights (SDR)122 of International Monetary Fund (IMF). He wrote that the concept
of global greenbacks, ‘simply extends the concept’ of SDRs, and that global
greenbacks would be issued annually, unlike SDRs which are issued
episodically.’123

Today, there are 143 different currencies in circulation serving 191 member
countries of the United Nations.124 It is estimated that transaction costs related to
currency exchanges are in the region of 400 billion dollars annually.125 Of course,
such a transaction method would be beneficial to certain groups such as banks and

other financial institutions, and no doubt create employment opportunities.
Countries are constantly competing with each other in order to promote their
respective currencies on the global market, and currencies that become stronger
are more valuable, and consequently in higher demand. Governments at different
times intervene in the money markets, and resort to managed exchange rate
systems, in order to manipulate the exchange rate so as to gain an advantage over
their competitors. Multinational corporations, invest only in countries whose
currencies are favourable to their operations, otherwise relocate their businesses
elsewhere.

The creation of a universal single currency cannot take place overnight. Many
factors need to be taken into consideration before one is chosen, or created. The
success of regional currencies such as the ‘East Caribbean Dollar – XCD’126 and
‘West African Franc – CFA’127 are notable, which have harmonised the economies
of a number of nations. These represent a positive movement and a promising
factor towards the formation of a universal single currency. These regional
currencies have provided opportunity to further understand the nature of an
international single currency, as a result, economists are now far better informed
of what an international currency may involve.

A universal single currency operating under a central bank has certain economic
implications and advantages over the current system of 143 separate currencies in

circulation in the world. Among the factors that facilitate economic transactions
on a global stage is the benefit of rendering a central bank independency,
transparency and accountability. Commenting on this Artis and Nixson argue that
‘It is generally reckoned to be in the interests of effective stabilisation and low
inflation to ensure that the central bank is independent from day-to-day political
pressures.’128 It is also important that the institutions concerned to be accountable
and transparent in what it does and how it does it. Artis and Nixon further argue
that by being accountable and transparent ‘the central bank can enlist the support
of the market rather than working against the grain.’129 Transparent helps firms
and households to compare the prices of goods, services and resources accurately
in the global marketplace. This is needed because of the distorting effect and the
variability of the exchange rates, which may discourage trade. From an economic
point of view, it is accepted that prices should act as a signalling function for the
optimal allocation of resources, so as to improve economic efficiency.130 The
chances of this happening across the globe would be far greater if there existed a
universal single currency.

Another benefit of a universal single currency is associated with risks that each
currency poses to the other. This could be avoided using a single currency. In a
multi-dimensional currency market, countries are continuously striving to
influence their currency in order to gain a competitive edge, and as the value of
one currency is determined against another, all currencies are at risk. This can be

one of the reasons for global economic imbalances. Moreover, multinational
companies that have invested heavily in different countries are at risk of losing
money as a result of currency fluctuations. In order to avoid such losses they may
relocate their whole business operation to a country with more favourable
conditions. Transfers of this kind create serious economic problems for the former
host country, including increased unemployment, decreased revenue, and, more
importantly, a decline in the welfare of the people. Adoption of a universal single
currency would help alleviate this considerable risk and uncertainty from the
economic equation.

A universal single currency can be a regulating factor for consumerism. Several
factors lead consumers to spend more, one such factor being the exchange rate.
With a highly valued or strong currency131, people are able to purchase foreign
products cheaper. It is for this reason that the rich and developed countries with
stronger currencies are able to import products more cheaply. The opposite is also
true: countries with weak currencies are unable to import goods produced by
developed economies. A universal single currency could play an important role in
improving this situation. A single currency, which has the same value in all
markets globally, would give people of different countries the same purchasing
power to trade with each other. Although, single currency is an important factor
for a fair trade, however, it is not sufficient for improving the standards of living.
Other factors are essential such as the availability of resources, employment
opportunity, the level of education and training, consumer and producer

confidence, and the price level.

Despite the advantages of a single currency, there are challenges related to how it
is designed, managed and regulated. Hence, it can be challenged in a number of
ways. Assuming that a universal single currency is operated by a world central
bank, if a single rate of interest is decided based on the so-called ‘one-size-fits-all’
policy, the interest rate decided would be applied to all countries equally. There is
a risk then, that an interest rate, which may be appropriate for one country, may
not be appropriate for another. For example countries with high inflation may
require a higher level of interest rate, while countries with low level of economic
growth or high unemployment may need a lower level of interest rate. In an ideal
world with a meaningful globalisation and a sustainable development, where
countries operate in a similar economic cycle, having the same interest rate would
not be a problem. Individual governments also can coordinate their activities with
their own fiscal instruments to avoid any conflict with the policies of World Bank
and a single interest rate.

Another difficulty with a single currency according to John Sloman is in adjusting
to an international shock, which affects countries differently. He mentions for
example a sudden change in the price of oil would affect an oil exporting country
differently from oil importing one. Sloman argues that ‘the divergences between
economies are often the result of a lack of harmony between countries in their
demand-management policies.’ 132 The Bahá’í scriptures advocate a change in
lifestyle and the adoption of a demand management attitude, such as

\[132\] Sloman. Economics, p. 713.

implementing the moral principle of moderation. Also, according to Sloman
‘many of the shocks that face economies today are global and have similar effects
on all countries. Adjustment to such shocks would often be better with a single
coordinated policy.’133

At the regional level, gains from the adoption of Euro currency came at the cost of
abandoning monetary policy as a stabilisation tool. Two experts in European
economy, Mike Artis and Fredrick Nixson, confirm this. According to them, ‘The
monetary union entails the loss of one important tool of national macroeconomic
stabilisation policy which would need to be compensated by greater reliance on a
second such tool, namely national fiscal policies.’ 134 According to Artis and
Nixson, the assessment of benefits and costs comes down to a few distinct
considerations.

> Benefits come from gains for trade and growth and the
> elimination of exchange rate risk; cost stem from the
> possibility that monetary policy that is right for the
> monetary union is wrong for the individual country. This
> cost could take the concrete form of greater volatility of
> inflation and growth in the absence of a monetary policy
> instrument to help absorb idiosyncratic shocks (shocks to
> an individual country that do not affect the currency union
> as a whole).135

On balance, the success of a single currency, whether at regional level or at
international level depends on whether it can promote economic justice in the
world. It also depends as to whether in a Optimal Currency Area, it removes the
advantages enjoyed by a few favoured countries, whose currency is seen as strong

\[135\] Ibid., p. 394.

as or more secure than that of others, and stops the poor from being affected
severely by the impact of currency fluctuations. In the long run, the adoption of a
universal single currency depends on whether it offsets the harm that economic
globalisation may cause at the local level, by putting everyone everywhere, on a
more level economic playing field. Hence, this particular teaching may become
controversial if it is not devised and implemented properly, and if it does not
stimulate economic justice. To avoid confusion, as mentioned previously, the
Bahá’í faith should be studied as a whole rather than looking at each principle
individually.

5\.5    The Bahá’í World Commonwealth
The phrase ‘Bahá’í World Commonwealth’ is plausibly the closest expression to
the concept of ‘globalisation’ stated in the Bahá’í writings.136 The Bahá’í World
Commonwealth can be described as representing the final stage in the
development of the Bahá’í administrative order and standing on the threshold of
the promised Golden Age. Shoghi Effendi has described the relationship between
the Bahá’í World Commonwealth and Bahá’í administration in the following
words: ‘It stands in its final form as a worthy and faithful exposition of the
constitutional basis of Bahá’í communities in every land, foreshadowing the final
emergence of the world Bahá’í Commonwealth of the future.’137 Thus, the Bahá’í
writings envisage that humanity, and as a subset within it the Bahá’í community

\[136\] The term ‘Bahá’í World Commonwealth’ has been mentioned in The World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh (p. 40, 98, 146,152, 168, 193, 203, 204); in God Passes By (p. 26, 316); in Advent of
Divine Justice of Divine (p. 12); Bahá’í Administration (p. 135); Promised Day is Come (p. 122);
Bahá’í World (vol. XI, p. 138, p. 26); and Messages to America (p. 81) where Shoghi Effendi talks
about welding the society into ‘... a single, organically-united, unshatterable world commonwealth
...’. Also, the term is used repeatedly in a letter from the Universal House of Justice dated 27 April

\[137\] Shoghi Effendi. Bahá’í Administration, p. 134.

itself, must undergo a process of development. This comprises both short and
long-term developmental plans and activities to understand and fully implement
Bahá’í teachings. Short-term plans of action are given to the worldwide Bahá’í
community, by the head of the Bahá’í faith, the Universal House of Justice, the
latter ones being called the ‘Five Year Plans’. These short-term plans provide
guidelines for the progress of the Bahá’í community and its future development.

The significance of Bahá’u’lláh’s prescriptions for humanity, it is anticipated, will
be realised only gradually over an extensive period. Society as a whole is called
upon to share in establishing the Bahá’í World Commonwealth, for example, by
working towards the unity of all nations; bringing about the ‘Lesser Peace138, and
striving generally to acquire moral and ethical values. However, it is only during
the ‘Golden Age’139 of the Bahá’í faith that the world peace in its truest sense as
the ‘Most Great Peace’140 will be established, although its exact nature is not
known. And the author of this research was not able to find relevant materials
from the primary Bahá’í writings.

\[138\] The lesser peace will come about through a binding treaty among the nations for the political
unification of the world. It will involve the boundaries of every nation being clearly fixed, the size
of their armaments strictly limited, the principles underlying the relationship of governments
toward one another definitely laid down, and all international agreements and obligations
ascertained. See: Peace more than an end to war, Compiled by Terrill, Hayes; Richard, Hill;
Anne, Scheffer; Anne, Atkinson and Betty, Fisher, Wilmette IL: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1986, p.

\[276\] 
\[139\] ‘The Golden Age of the [Bahá’í] faith itself that must witness the unification of all the peoples
and nations of the world, the establishment of the Most Great Peace, the inauguration of the
Kingdom of the Father upon earth, the coming of age of the entire human race and the birth of a
world civilisation, inspired and directed by the creative energies released by Bahá’u’lláh’s World
Order, shining in its meridian splendour, is still unborn and its glories unsuspected.’ See: Shoghi
Effendi, God Passes By, p. 411.

\[140\] The Most Great peace will be the practical consequence of the spiritualisation of the world and
the fusion of all its races, creeds, classes, and nations. Such a peace will rest on the foundation of,
and be preserved by, the ordinances of God. See: Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, p. 276.

An important issue to be borne in mind is that the new World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh is in an embryonic stage and it is as yet too early to envisage the
structure, implications, benefits, and the character of the Bahá’í World
Commonwealth. Nevertheless, since the Bahá’í administration is a part of it, we
can argue that the process of establishing Bahá’í World Commonwealth has
already begun. The components of Bahá’í World Commonwealth referred to in
the Bahá’í writings are summarised by the Bahá’í International Community as
follows:

> Recognised and secure borders for all nations; freedom of
> movement and thought for all people; a general
> disarmament; the establishment of a world federation of
> nations; the establishment of a world tribunal for the
> adjudication of international disputes; the creation of an
> international military force capable of enforcing peace
> through principles of collective security; and a
> commitment to the protection of cultural diversity.141

These propositions for the Bahá’í World Commonwealth are good illustrations of
essentials of a meaningful globalisation anticipated in the Bahá’í writings.

5\.6       The opportunities and challenges of globalisation
There are two paradoxical conditions that are shaping the current process of
globalisation. On the one hand, and positively, the economic performance and the
wealth of nations have increased substantially.142 On the other hand, the gap
between the poor and the rich has widened, and there is increasing domination and
bargaining power by some nations and firms over others. Hence, the current
globalisation has produced both opportunities and challenges.

\[141\] Bahá’í International Community. The Bahá’ís, 2005, p. 82.

\[142\] See Galbraith. A History of economics, pp. 1-3.

Currently most developing countries enjoy greater trade in goods and
services;  greater transfer of financial capital;  greater transfer of technology and
information, greater specialization in production,   and greater labor migration;
resulting in the inclusion of more economies in the global trading system
including Central and  Eastern European economies, China and the other so-called
‘emerging economies.’143 We are witnessing encouraging signs of acceleration in
the process of globalisation, in particular, with the interest shown to global
economic integration caused by economic liberalisation. The process of
globalisation is facilitated through removing trade barriers, democratisation in
many parts of the world and the activities of the international agencies. The
progress of information technology has enabled the easy and relatively cheap
transfer of information between different agents of the market at a global level.
For example, the Internet has led to increasing knowledge and information for
both consumers to demand their choice of product and the manufacturers to
produce what consumers demand. Advanced technology and transportation enable
mass production and distribution to different parts of the world. Moreover, trade is
gradually becoming more liberated as restrictions have been reduced due to the
activities of the World Trade Organisation.

The Bahá’í writings also affirm that important components of a meaningful
globalisation are the political, environmental, social, moral, and economic

\[143\] Emerging economies are the newly industrialised countries such as Brazil, Russia, Indonesia,
and China (BRIC). Also it refers to economies in transition from planned economy to the free
market economy such as the Eastern European Countries. See: Krugman, International
Economics, pp. 652-653.

interdependency of people and nations. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has identified a number of
necessary elements for globalisation, some of which became available during his
own lifetime, including travelling, availability of information through different
publications, effective communication and exchange of views.144 However, the
issue of the interdependency of nations, in its current form, is not without
challenges. Two of the most significant are that the current process of
globalisation has created a condition of dependency, and the increasing
domination and bargaining power by some nations over others. Thus, the
challenge is creating and maintaining interdependency in such a way that its
foundation is based on trust among nations.

Globalisation has increased trade among nations and assisted developing countries
in becoming more integrated into the global economy. This has enabled domestic
firms to establish contracts with the international capital markets, thereby
producing more and benefiting from economies of scale.145 Increasing the level of
output for a world market creates more employment in developing countries.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that trade multiplies output.146 Hence, principles such as
investment in education, providing opportunity for women, and removing trade
barriers would help to increase the level of output in the market globally. Many
developing countries have already benefited by applying these principles and have

Globalisation of the Bahá’í Community: 1892-1921’, Bahá’í and Globalisation, pp. 81-85.

\[145\] Economies of scale is a situation where reduction in the cost of production leads to increasing
the level of output. Benefits includes: managerial, technological, financial, and marketing
economies. Economies of scale is a characteristic of large firms. See: Begg, Fischer, and
Dornbusch. Economics, p. 123. Also: Don Waldman and Elizabeth Jensen. Industrial

The Secret of Divine Civilisation, pp. 5-36.

come out of poverty by earning additional revenue, which is needed for improving
public services such as education, health and other welfare programs.

A positive occurrence that helps reform the current process of globalisation is the
promotion of education among the female population in some parts of the world.
Education, leading to the emancipation and empowerment of women motivates
them to participate at all levels of society as politicians, educators, managers and
entrepreneurs. Women in South East Asian countries are now heavily engaged in
advancement of their communities in controlling the growth of the population,
while increasing the total output of the economy. These activities not only connect
their communities to the rest of the world, but also have improved the quality of
their own lives, enabling them to better practice their role as mothers. Women,
thus, play an important role in dealing with challenges such as population
explosion, output shortages, and improving standards of living, which are
important components of a meaningful globalisation.

Further improvement is noted in the enrichment of agriculture. Farmers have been
encouraged to embrace new technology. International agencies have helped to
teach them new techniques in farming and, as a result, there has been a significant
increase in their productive capacity. Adequate technology is now available for
farmers with small areas of land.

Another area of development is the improvement of the banking system through
adjustment and regulation, and the provision of funds for start-up businesses. This
is particularly crucial for the developing countries. The Grameen bank in

Bangladesh has made small credit (micro finance) available to more than seven
million women to start up their own businesses.147 The social function of wealth
has been realised by the modern banking corporation, although much more needs
to be done for the effective implementation of the social function of wealth.

Through access to information necessary for international trade, the developing
countries would be able to access different markets around the world and trade
their commodities globally and more favourably. This suggests that in practice
there is no need for the middleman; and producers in the developing countries are
able to sell their products directly to the final consumers. In particular, developing
countries can have easier access to advanced technology, which can be obtained
from the developed countries for manufacturing products that are healthier and
more suitable for the local requirements. The vast improvement in people’s
knowledge and information, and the significant role of pressure groups, animal
lovers, and green campaigners can help increase production of eco-friendly
commodities and more sustainable patterns of consumption. Consequently, as
Stiglitz pointed out, ‘Problem is not with globalisation but with how it has been
managed.’148 For Sen the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 is a
positive step towards achieving the conditions of a meaningful globalisation. For
him, globalisation is a blessing, not a curse. He refers to East Asia and the recent
remarkable reduction in poverty achieved by countries that opened up to global
markets and knowledge.149 For Shapour Rassekh the benefits of globalization
surpass its cost. He raised a question that how can we stop the negative attitudes

towards an effective and ideal globalization. He argues that in last two decades the
focus has been mainly on disadvantages of globalization. He further comments
that a meaningful globalization must focus on humanizing it. 150 Hence, for Sen,
Stiglitz, Sache, Rassekh and many more there is nothing wrong with the creation
and development of globalisation, the problem is the negative processes adopted
to achieve it. The view in this dissertation is that a fair distribution of the benefits
of globalisation among citizens of the world is an important aspect of a
meaningful globalisation.

 Despite the benefits of globalisation, we are still facing many serious challenges
in establishing a meaningful globalisation. These include elimination of extremes
of wealth and poverty, the issue of consumerism, the effective use of human
capital, population explosion, the preservation and protection of the ecosystem,
the prevention of child labour, and pursuing a fair international trade. Experts and
policy makers are faced with multiple complex challenges for creating a
meaningful globalisation. World Commission on the Social Dimension of
Globalisation has condemned the current process of globalisation in a sense that
the current process of globalisation is generating unbalanced outcomes, both
between and within countries:

> Wealth is being created, but too many countries and
> people are not sharing in its benefits. They also have little
> or no voice in shaping the process. Seen through the eyes
> of the vast majority of women and men, globalisation has
> not met their simple and legitimate aspirations for decent

There is also the danger of moral crisis associated with the current form of
globalisation such as exclusion, population replacement, and environmental
damage. Hence, in the face of such appalling challenges and staggering
inequalities, can we say that there is a fair distribution of the benefits of
globalization? We are still in the early stages of globalization and according to
Sen ‘The rapidly expanding interest of the subject has also had an impact on
demands of policy reforms’152 by individual countries.

It was argued that one benefit of globalization is creating more employment in
developing countries. But, this does not mean that those employed are satisfied
with what they are doing. The following story written by Jeffrey Sachs and it is
about his visit to Bangladesh confirming this claim:

> On one visit to Bangladesh, I picked up an English-
> language morning newspaper, where I found an extensive
> insert of interviews with young women working in the
> garment sector. These stories were poignant, fascinating,
> and eye-opening. One by one, they recounted the arduous

> opportunity that these women could ever have imagined,
> and that their employment had changed their lives for the
> better.153

The self-explanatory character of this story indicate that although the existence of
multinational corporations in Bangladesh have changed the material life of these
women and perhaps millions more, but in an exploitive and inhuman way.

At this early phase of the process of expanding globalisation, both developed and
developing countries are affected, and to some extent benefited. Developed
countries have often seen developing countries as a source of low cost raw
materials that could be used in manufacturing products. Another advantage to the
developed countries is that the reduction in the price of manufactured goods has
increased the real income of consumers allowing them to have higher standards of
living. This, however, has led to consumerism (chapter 4, section 4.3). On the
other hand, while the transfer of manufacturing to the developing world has
allowed the developed countries to enjoy cleaner environments, it has simply
moved the negative effects of manufacturing, such as pollution, to developing
countries.

Hypothetically, globalisation is expected to bring unprecedented benefits to all
countries, however as Stiglitz argues:

> [Globalisation] has come to be vilified both in the
> developed and the developing world. America and Europe
> see the threat of outsourcing; the developing countries see
> the advanced industrial countries tilting the global
> economic regime against them. Those in both see

values.154

Henceforth, purely national interests often shape debates on globalisation,
especially in policy-making circles, whether social, economic, or political.
Therefore, discussions of the subject should be properly broadened to take into
account all aspects of global life in a changing world. The process of changing the
world is both a reform and a transition. It is useful to define the terms ‘transition’
and ‘reform’. Transition implies the shift from one system to another, for
example, currently there is a transition from the ‘command economy’ to ‘free
market economy’, taking place by the Eastern European Countries. While, reform
implies changes in the existing system, perhaps a more fundamental one. The
Bahá’í writings suggest that the remedy to current socio-politico-economic crisis
consists of the removal of the old order and reforming to a new World Order.
Bahá’u’lláh states ‘Soon will the present day order be rolled up, and a new one be
spread out in its stead.’155 The changes shaping human affairs now indicate that
transition into a global society is inevitable. These changes include international
activities and cooperation among nations, such as holding international
conferences on environment, migration, poverty reduction, and human trafficking.
However, a major challenge in this transition for reform is creating conditions for
socio-politico-economic fairness among and within the nations of our global
community so that humanity as a whole can benefit.

The question therefore arises as to whether humanity is capable of facing the
challenges of globalisation. From the above discussion, it is evident that the

\[154\] Stiglitz. Making Globalisation Work, p. 269.

\[155\] Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 163.

process of globalisation has already begun; however, a central view discussed and
presented in this dissertation is that social structures are constantly changing and
no single economic theory would be always suitable for the whole world. It is
argued that humanity has reached a level of understanding and accepting
responsibility and is capable of facing the challenges, but a multi-dimensional
solution is required.

5\.7    Chapter conclusion
Globalisation is defined as the process by which more people across nations
become interconnected in different ways. Globalisation from an economic
perspective is expressed as a borderless market. The Bahá’í view is that creating a
global society is possible at this time because the means of interconnectedness of
people and nations have been created. These include advanced communication,
information technology, trade liberalisation, and global financial interdependency.
Hence, in this chapter, studying the Bahá’í writings, some of the components of
creating a meaningful globalisation are examined. Some popular statements from
the writings such ‘the well-being of mankind,’156 and ‘betterment of the world,’157
and ‘We must all be in the greatest happiness and comfort’158 confirm the Bahá’í
vision of globalisation. Addressing Bahá’ís the founder of this faith instructs them
to ‘Let your vision be world-embracing.’159 To establish such a vision, Bahá’ís not
only work to build a community as a model for a meaningful globalisation, but
also for the common good. For example, there are specific guidelines and

instructions for individual Bahá’ís and the Bahá’í community, such as standards
for marriage, elimination of all kinds of social and economic prejudices, and
consultative methods of decision-making. There are also principles promoting the
betterment of the world, such as universal peace, gender equality, and the unity of
humankind. This way, Bahá’ís are committed themselves to be a part of the
process of forming a meaningful globalisation.

However, the current process of globalisation does not march forward along a
smooth path. It is argued in this chapter that there is nothing wrong with the idea
or the concept of globalisation; the challenges are in the processes adopted. For
example, the development of the current modelling of globalisation has created
winners and losers, problems associated with the eco-system, and unbalance
growth and expansion of organisations. The most worrying consequence is the
creation of extremes of wealth and poverty. Therefore, this form of globalisation
is not in agreement with the Bahá’í perspective of creating a meaningful global
society. Both Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í writers and scholars have suggested that the
benefits of globalisation should be distributed fairly and justly among citizens of
the world. It was also suggested that the current form of globalisation needs to be
reformed, and such a reform need to be multi-dimensional. In addition, and on the
positive side, it was argued that humanity today has the capacity to combat the
challenges of globalisation.

The process of capacity building and community building involves a global
enterprise of learning. It is a process of action, evaluation, and adjustment, one in
which local communities gradually improves their abilities to define, analyse, and

meet their own needs. Hence, the process of attaining a meaningful globalisation
in the Bahá’í community is incorporating development strategies through a
combination of bottom-up and top-down planning systems. A substantial amount
of decision-making, planning and implementation comes from the grassroots
population, with necessary guidelines and technical and financial support from the
Bahá’í institutions, such as the Office of Social and Economic Development at the
Bahá’í World Centre. An example of Bahá’í community involvement in the
process of achieving an ideal globalisation will be discussed in the next chapter. It
is a Bahá’í inspired social and economic development project in the city of
Rajshahi in Bangladesh involving grassroots population.

6\.1   Introduction
There is a great deal of correlation between globalisation (previous chapter) and
economic development (this chapter). The two processes are inextricably linked.
If we consider Michael Todaro’s definition of development as ‘The process of
improving the quality of life for all’2 then, as Jeffrey Williamson writes, ‘It started
about the same time as globalisation, in the early 19th century.’3 Considering these
observations, it can be argued that globalisation and development are mainly 19th
and 20th century phenomenon and go hand in hand. The question of which one
comes first, the response is that globalisation requires the means, and the means

are attained through developments in such things as advancement in
transportation, effective communication, and technological progress. The degree
of development, however, depends on the resourcefulness of communities, both
physical and intellectual. Development programs are varied from small scale at
local communities, to large scale at global level, depends on the resources
available to a particular community or to an organisation to carry out development
projects. For example, agencies working under the United Nations, and others
such as Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) with substantial
resources are able to undertake extensive development projects around the world.

This chapter will focus on mainly two aspects of development for this
dissertation. 1) The Bahá’í view on development based on the study of Bahá’í
literatures. 2) The application of Bahá’í teachings on development based on a
field trip to Bangladesh and observing a Bahá’í inspired social and economic
development project in the city of Rajshahi.

6\.2   The Bahá’í Office of Social and Economic Development
The accelerated growth of the Bahá’í community worldwide in the 1960s-1980s
led to the enrolment of a large number of people in India, Africa, South and
Central America. Such rapid expansion for the Bahá’í communities created
challenges, as the development required induction and consolidation in the faith.
The process of consolidation needed cooperation among Bahá’í communities
worldwide. The development projects were therefore started, supported and
reinforced by the Bahá’í communities. Such a process, pursued most notably
through a variety of educational activities, received considerable impetus in two

separate statements issued by the head of the Bahá’í faith, the Universal House of
Justice. First, in 1983, the historical statement of 20th September asked for
‘systematic attention’4 to be given to the above area of activities following the
rapid expansion of the Bahá’í community during the 1970s,5 and hence the Office
of Social and Economic Development (OSED) was established. Second, a
statement issued in September 1993 entitled ‘Bahá’í Social and Economic
Development: Prospects for the Future.’ The OSED is responsible for
coordinating Bahá’í development projects and is an agency of the Universal
House of Justice at the Bahá’í World Centre in Haifa, Israel. Some of the
responsibilities of the OSED are to provide ‘support and guidance’6 to Bahá’ís
engaged in development activities by ‘coordinating the flow of human and
financial resources to projects’7 and to nurture them by ‘providing general advice,
technical and otherwise, in response to the questions that naturally arise in
carrying on such endeavours.’ 8 Therefore, the work of OSED according to
Universal House of Justice should be organised around its primary purpose to
‘facilitate learning about development by fostering and supporting action,
reflection on action, study, consultation, the gathering and systematisation of
experience, conceptualisation, and training—all carried out in light of the
Teachings of the Faith.’9

It is notable that the association of economic viewpoints with religion and
development are not new, nor is it restricted to scholars of the 21st century.
Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith, the founder of modern scientific
economics, presented his view of economics and development in his two major
publications, The Wealth of Nations and The theory of moral sentiment. Also,
German economist, socialist and politician Max Weber put forward his now-
famous theory of ‘The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism,’10 arguing that
economic development in Northern Europe could be explained by developments
associated with the ‘Protestant ethics,’ which was interested in savings,
entrepreneurial activity, the frugality which ‘Puritanism’ demanded, and literacy
to read the scriptures. 11 Hence, economists and philosophers recognise these
factors as necessary components of the theories and models associated with
sustained economic growth and development.

According to Bahá’í writings, religion has been among the most powerful agents
for changing human attitudes and behaviour towards development. Religion, has
traditionally defined human nature, and our relationship each other and with
respect to the environment. Religion, in the Bahá’í view, is                         ‘the cause of
development and the animating impulse of all human advancement’ [and] ‘…has
been the basis of all civilisation and progress in the history of mankind.’12 In a
number of ways religions are the causes of wealth creation. For example, it
advocates moderation, which reduces wastage of resources, and adds to wealth

and it promotes for all creatures and plants and the conservation of the earth’s
resources (chapter 5). Religion also encourages sharing and caring and hence
influences wealth redistribution (chapter 4). Many of the important decisions
about family, work and savings have been rooted in religious beliefs (chapter
2). Religion emphasises the human resource development that constitutes the
ultimate basis for wealth of nations (chapter 3). Religion is the source of hope for
the vast majority of the planet’s inhabitants. It is, therefore, ‘inconceivable that a
peaceful and prosperous global society, a society which nourishes a spectacular
diversity of cultures and nations, can be established and sustained without directly
and substantively involving the world’s great religions in its design and support.’13
Social and economic development has been an important part of all religions and
the Bahá’í faith is not an exception. What is significant now is the timing and
geographical implication of Bahá’í development.

It is the right time for the Bahá’í community to be involved in social and
economic development activities on a global scale because of the ‘strong
foundation that has been created over more than half a century of establishing and
building a worldwide Bahá’í community (the statement was written in 1989).’14
The ‘global scale’ and ‘strong foundation’ can be interpreted as the establishment
of increasing numbers of Local Spiritual Assemblies around the world, which
coordinate and direct the activities of the Bahá’í community in villages, towns and
cities. Also, the ‘global scale’ does not refer to the size of projects but to the
number of projects. This indicates grassroots involvement in a coordinated

Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, South Africa, August 26, 2002.

fashion while their activities are linked and supported by the Bahá’í
administrations at local, national and international levels. The support can be in
planning or offering financial assistance if required. Therefore, the vast majority
of Bahá’í social and economic development projects are local in nature rather than
global. Confirming this the Bahá’í International Community writes:

> Most Bahá’í social and economic development efforts are
> fairly simple activities of fixed duration in which Bahá’ís
> in villages and towns around the world apply spiritual
> principles to the problems and challenges faced by their
> localities. These activities either originate in the Bahá’í
> communities themselves or are a response to the invitation
> of other organizations.15

The development projects consist of academic schools dealing with literacy and
capacity building. Many others focus on areas such as basic health care,
immunisation, substance abuse, childcare, agriculture, the environment, and
microenterprise. Workshops and seminars on such themes as race unity and the
advancement of women are also organised for the whole community. The
approach to creating and operating these projects is distinctively Bahá’í. Many of
these programs according to Holly Hanson Vick are ‘fairly simple activities of
fixed duration in which Bahá’ís in villages and towns around the world apply
spiritual principles to the problems and challenges faced in their localities.16 The
approach to creating and operating these projects is distinctively based on Bahá’í
teachings. Many projects place emphasis on raising the status of women, and a
number of projects seek to serve minority populations that have been
discriminated against. Most projects make extensive use of the principle of

1993, pp. 229-245, at p. 233.

consultation in an effort to seek input from, and empower, those whom the
projects attempt to serve.17

In spite of considerable progress in the expansion of development activities in the
Bahá’í community, there are still challenges to be faced. For example, most
development projects in the Bahá’í community are based on spiritual principles
and character building. Also, projects aim to increase people’s self-reliance,
communal cooperation and unity, giving access to knowledge, and where
possible, removing sources of injustice and prejudices. These are fundamental and
necessary for the success of projects in the long term plans. However, considering
that Bahá’í development projects are mainly in areas where poverty and social
problems are prevalent, projects that create job opportunities in a short period of
time become favourable.

6\.4     Features of Bahá’í development
By studying and observing the pattern of activities of Bahá’í development projects
around the world, it is possible to identify the following five features:

6\.4.1    Material and spiritual coherence
From a Bahá’í perspective, development is an organic process in which ‘the
spiritual is expressed and carried out in the material.’18 Therefore, an important
feature of Bahá’í development is that it must respond to both material and
spiritual needs in a balanced way. The Bahá’í literature considers human beings

\[17\] For an in depth discussion of Bahá’í Development programs see: Bahá’í International
Community, ‘Bahá’í Development Projects: A Global Process of Learning,’ 1999.

\[18\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Paris Talks, p 9.

essentially as spiritual in nature and happiness and well-being will be ideally
satisfied if the spiritual aspects of their life is fulfilled and developed alongside
the material. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: ‘Although material civilisation is one of the
means for the progress of the world of mankind, yet until it becomes combined
with divine civilisation, the desired result, which is the felicity of mankind, will
not be attained.’19 Hence, Bahá’í inspired development projects incorporate this
basic requirement.

6\.4.2      The universality of Bahá’í development
Another feature of Bahá’í development is that in our increasingly interdependent
world, development efforts must be animated by universal values and guided by a
vision of the world community. Projects are thus designed to engage and benefit
all the members of a community and not only Bahá’ís. Collaboration with
organisations and leaders of thought concerned with social, moral and economic
advancement is an important component of Bahá’í development endeavours.
Bahá’u’lláh states ‘All human beings have been created to carry forward an ever-
advancing civilisation.’20 Consequently, the creation of a prosperous and peaceful
global society that promotes individual and community well-being is central to the
Bahá’í vision of the future, which is incorporated by all economic development
activities. It is based on these principles that the Bahá’í development approach is
the struggle to learn universal values. This requires engendering a new mind-set in
the Bahá’í community, which is already in place through various educational
programs for all ages.

\[20\] Bahá’u’lláh. Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 215.

6\.4.3   Grassroots population are at the centre of Bahá’í development
The desire for change must come directly from individuals and communities and
cannot be imposed from the outside. An important aspect of Bahá’í development
projects is that for the most part, these activities are very simple initiatives that
take place at the grassroots level. The activities are used to unlock the creative
capabilities of individuals and communities. The form of grassroots initiatives
carried out by small groups of individuals in towns and villages has an important
effect in the long run. As these initiatives evolve, some grow into more substantial
programs with permanent administrative structures. Yet, as commented by Ron
Price ‘very few can be compared with the kind of complex development projects
promoted and funded by government agencies and large multilateral
organisations.’21 Therefore, the most important successes of Bahá’í development
initiatives are qualitative in nature. With an emphasis on grassroots action and
evolutionary growth, Bahá’í development projects complement the many other
elements of Bahá’í community life. Development activities are an integral aspect
of Bahá’í efforts to create a pattern of living that releases individual potential and
simultaneously promotes the collective good. Therefore, the Bahá’í Development
approach, is not a product to be delivered by the ‘developed’ countries to the
‘underdeveloped.’ Rather, it is a process in which individuals and communities in
all parts of the world, regardless of the degree of their material prosperity, become
the principal actors in defining, analysing and solving their own problems.

6\.4.4    The focus of a considerable number of Bahá’í development projects is

in the field of education
Learning takes place at all levels and involves all the members of Bahá’í
communities, whatever their capacities and experiences. Development of human
resources is closely related to learning and building of capacity. Training
methods, which foster participation and an open attitude toward learning,
principally involve individuals and groups at the grassroots, but can also include
professionals and students from other regions and countries. In this way, a
worldwide process of learning is encouraged. The classes, and other educational
activities offered in increasing numbers by Bahá’í communities around the world,
can help to ensure that children grow strong intellectually, morally, and
spiritually. The view is that increased prosperity in rural areas of developing
countries is mainly possible through the education of rural children. To contribute
to their societies effectively, these children require not only acquiring knowledge
and skills, but also being acquainted with universal ethical values to develop
capability and proficiency. However, the main focus of Bahá’í development
projects is not only providing necessary knowledge and education to increase the
children’s ability to earn financial requirements, but also to improve the quality of
life through personality development.

6\.5     Rahmanian Foundation: A Bahá’í inspired development project,

Rajshahi - Bangladesh
In February 2011, a field trip was undertaken for the purpose of examining the
visible contribution of Bahá’í community in rural development. For this purpose,

Rahmanian Foundation, a Bahá’í inspired social and economic development
project in Rajshahi - Bangladesh was selected and visited.

Bangladesh has a population of 160.4 million22 (2015). It is one of the most
densely populated areas in the world. The population density is 3200 people per
square mile. A significant percentage of the population are children and youth.
Child labour is still a serious problem. However, the youth population of
Bangladesh show great interest in learning and positively changing their own way
of life and of those around them. The city of Rajshahi, which is located in
Western Bangladesh, has a population of over one million (2015). Formerly, the
development activities began in the form of small-scale ‘tutorial schools’ in the
main city of ‘Rajshahi’ and a nearby village called ‘Godagari’ in 1979 by the
candidate of this research. Godagari has a population of over two hundred
thousand. As the community resources were limited, most of these efforts were
modest and traditional, serving their immediate locality. At the time, the main
purpose was to improve literacy among the rural population. Therefore a few local
people were trained to begin teaching the children in their own village in
Godagari and in the city of Rajshahi. They were also involved in organising the
infrastructure for the classes, by working together to build a modest and
traditional place for holding the classes. In 1999 the Rajshahi project was
advanced to a full-time academy called ‘Rahmanian Foundation’. Mahmood
Rahmanian is supporting the Foundation financially. Currently, the Foundation’s
main purpose is uplifting the life of rural and tribal children aged 11-16 who have

\[22\] Retrieved: <http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/bangladesh-population/>, accessed: 15

no or little access to education. This Foundation like many other Bahá’í inspired
social and economic development projects is working in a more systematic
manner. The components for the application of a systematic approach towards
development includes a process of study of the Bahá’í writings, setting a clear
objective for development, first-hand information of the population they serve, the
gathering of necessary resources, actions taken in unity, the review and analysis of
the results of their efforts, and reflection on the reasons for their successes and
failures.

Followings are the main doctrines of Rahmanian Foundation:

> It is the human right of every child to have a goal in life
> and make every effort for the betterment of the world.
> Development must take place from within the
> communities and at the grassroots rather than being
> imposed from outside.
> Every member of the community needs to actively
> improve her/his own condition through learning and
> consultation.
> A socio-economic development must be able to increase
> the capacity of people in order to plan and to put it in to
> action.
> The success of Rahmanian Foundation depends on the
> unity of thoughts of those involved and their commitment
> to their responsibilities.
> The Project is a dynamic process that addresses the need
> of the community.
Any program should be conducive to both the material and

spiritual development of individuals and the community. 23

6\.5.1   The Interviews
Three separate interviews took place with the director of the Foundation Jabbar
Edelkhani and five members of the staff during my three days visit (24-27
February 2011) to Rajshahi. Everyone participated in the discussion with great
cooperation and enthusiasm, obliging of the questions asked of them. The
interview was conducted quite informal. A number of students were also
interviewed as well. A summary of the discussion is provided below:
On the question about the main focus of the Rahmanian Foundation, they
explained that one important channel to increase prosperity in rural Bangladesh is
through the education of rural children. To contribute to their societies, children
not only require knowledge, experience and skills but also moral incentives and
spiritual principles to develop a variety of capacities and become effective human
resource for the society. Reference was given to a statement by the Universal
House of Justice, which states ‘At the heart of all activities, the spiritual,
intellectual and community life of the believers must be developed and fostered.’24
Thus, the focus of the Foundation is to provide necessary education not only to
develop the moral incentives in students but also to increase their income-earning
capacity. According to the director of the Foundation ‘although literacy,
vocational and health training are essential, however one of the most important
things this Foundation can do to help children is to empower them to recognise

\[23\] The doctrines are adopted and translated from the Persian language, Rahmanian Foundation
directory, 2000.

their full potential as human beings.’25 Thus, the organisers of the Foundation
believe that moral and spiritual education is the basis for any successful
development strategy, a focus that contributes greatly to the project’s overall
effectiveness and success.26 The primary objective of the Foundation is to train
children and thereby empower them with the knowledge of their true selves and to
give them the skills and knowledge needed to improve the quality of life for
themselves, their families and their communities.

There was also a discussion about subjects taught at the Foundation. Apart from
normal academic subjects, the Foundation conducts residential courses to
empower children through training in overall life skills on subjects such as rural
health, hygiene and sustainable development. Personality development is a
combined effect of the academic development, and learning how to conduct
themselves during their time at the Foundation, through role modelling by the
staff and volunteers, and exposure to a learning setting. The program of
personality development also includes empowering the junior youth to plan,
organise, become conscious decision-makers, implement and share their successes
with others while respecting and reinforcing the value of their culture. Also, they
are trained to be mindful of social development issues such as gender equality,
work as worship and service as prayer, the importance of love, peace and unity;
and to discuss social issues and act to solve them. The Foundation also focuses on
health and hygiene and it is designed to provide the skills and develop the
potential of the trainees and their communities to deal with health problems.

Students learn to replace superstitious practices with scientific ones.

Who benefits from the Foundation? The immediate beneficiaries of the
Foundation are the young people from all communities, not only Bahá’ís. Also,
parents and family members, the community in the city of Rajshahi, the local
council, and business organisations directly or indirectly benefit from the
operation of the Foundation in the area. Students learn and experience how to be
of service to others, bring positive change and ensure respect for all cultures and
religions within their families and communities. Through these, they develop self-
confidence, and better self-esteem and emotional maturity. Development of
communication skills, such as public speaking, is another activity that empowers
both genders. Considering that Bahá’í development projects are mostly small
scale, with modest financial resources and mainly targeting rural communities,
Hanson believes that ‘the Bahá’í community’s contributions to social and
economic development are quite remarkable.’27 The Foundation has liberally and
unconditionally provided their services to the individuals and communities who
otherwise would not have the opportunity for development. In their dealings with
society at large, the Foundation is transparent in their philosophy. For example,
they organise public meetings with the people of the town to discuss their
progress and future development programs.                    According to its director, the
Foundation has created an effective relation with educational institutions and
other NGOs operating in the city of Rajshahi. There are also regular staff
meetings to discuss the progress of the project. The participants in the Foundation
are not expected to be Bahá’ís or to be converted to the Bahá’í faith. The

organisers strongly believe that the success of their project depends on focussing
on the needs of the local community. To be able to practically achieve its aims,
the Foundation has organised small size projects, currently providing training to
one hundred full-time students from divers backgrounds in its program. A number
of students are from the Santhal tribe,28 an out-casted community. This has been
particularly significant because it has previously been most difficult to get people
from other tribes and parts of Bangladesh to agree to remain in the same building
together with the members of Santhal tribe.

During my three days visit a high level of cleanliness and hygiene was quite
noticeable at the Foundation. Hence, there was some discussion about the
approach taken to create such an environment with outstanding discipline. It was
stated that one of the significant components of the Foundation is caring for the
environment as a spiritual responsibility. Students learn to care for the
environment as service to the whole community and the importance of healthy
environment and to care for land, water, and animals. Cleanliness and hygiene
were practiced and noticed in all parts of the institution.

At the heart of the Foundation’s vision is the recognition of a deep and
inseparable connection between the practical and spiritual aspects of daily life.
Creating a desire for social change and instilling confidence that it can be
achieved must ultimately come from an awakening of the human spirit. While

pragmatic approaches to problem solving play a key role in development
initiatives, tapping the spiritual roots of human motivation provides the essential
impulse that ensures genuine social advancement. In addition to directly
addressing some of the major issues in Bangladesh, such as agriculture, poverty,
education, health, and social exclusion, the Foundation seeks above all else to
revitalise the human spirit and to break down the barriers that limit fruitful and
harmonious cooperation among men and women, whatever their religious, racial
and cultural background.

Staff and volunteers at the Foundation believe that the creation and diffusion of
knowledge lie at the heart of social progress. It, therefore, focuses on increasing
the capacity of individuals, communities, and institutions to take concrete steps
that promote their own spiritual and material well-being. The staff’s views on
capacity building were highly encouraging. Reference was given to a passage
from Bahá’u’lláh, which refers to human beings ‘as a mine rich in gems of
inestimable value,’29 and states that the purpose of life and society is to generate
creative processes that serve to release those ‘gems’ of human potential. As
individuals begin to cultivate their innate capacities, the community around them
is transformed, and impetus is given to ‘an ever-advancing civilization.’30 The
Bahá'í experience of development projects carried out is systematic manner by
many other Bahá’í development projects around the world confirms this
understanding. The Foundation, therefore, is focusing on increasing the capacity
of individuals and the rural community to take concrete steps for promoting their

\[29\] Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 259.

\[30\] Ibid., p. 215.

spiritual and material well-being. An important goal at the heart of the Foundation
is to help students to recognise their full potential as human beings. This process
of capacity building involves a global enterprise of learning in which Bahá’ís
from virtually every cultural and ethnic background apply the sciences and their
moral and spiritual insights to their local conditions with the hope of improving
their communities. It is a process of action, evaluation, and adjustment, one in
which local communities gradually improves their ability to define, analyse, and
meet their own needs.

A fundamental and vital contribution of the Foundation is to combat poverty.
Eradication of poverty is at the core of Bahá’í teachings on economics. As
development agencies, religions are, not only major actors in education, but also,
provide significant humanitarian relief, such as support for orphans, and disabled
people.

Another area of contribution is the extent and depth of presence at the community
level and therefore the ability to reach people. Faith organisations are widely
present almost throughout the world, and they are, in a sense, the ultimate
community organisations, particularly in places with weak government structure.
This is another opportunity where the presence of Rahmanian Foundation can
greatly improve people’s lives in Bangladesh.

Also, an advantage that faith-based institutions such as Rahmanian Foundation
have is their familiarity with local conditions. Illustrations of broad strategy issues
might include whether enough attention is given to rural areas, whether there is a

tendency to focus too much on urban areas, whether there is enough money going
to education and health programs, whether the programs for youth and youth
employment are working, whether the curriculum in education is adapted to the
needs of the local society, and what more needs to be done. Faith institutions are
likely to have productive views and relevant experiences on these issues if they
are well framed.

The organisers of the Foundation described some challenges that they are facing,
mainly due to limited resources. Currently, external educational institutions are
used for its academic requirements such as English language and mathematics.
However, as expressed by its director, as the resources of the Foundation increase,
further expansion and new areas of social and economic development will be
explored.

The organisers are also aware that becoming self-sufficient is important for the
Foundation. However, currently this is not possible. The Foundation is not able to
carry on its functions without external support. There is a need for better
community awareness so that gradually the Foundation becomes self-sufficient.
Increased capacity depends on the degree and dimension of the local contributions
and participation in terms of human resources, finances and other resources.
Encouragingly, there is a strong local initiative to support its activities. Also,
there is the presence of able individuals in the fields of medicine and management
who support the Foundation on a voluntary basis.

Another challenge described by a number of staff was that currently the

Foundation’s focus is mainly on education (spiritual education in particular).
However, the Foundation need to be engaged in other areas such as small and
medium size agriculture, which is of great importance to the local needs. The
success of the Foundation in the future depends on the integration of spiritual and
practical aspects of life. Apart from self-discipline and personal development,
students need to improve the material well-being of themselves and their
communities. This way, students are prepared and experience the joy of serving
their communities, and creating positive changes in their families and the wider
society.

6\.5.2      Other examples of Bahá’í inspired social and economic development

projects with a systematic approach
By investigating a number of Bahá’í social and economic development projects
around the world, the indication is that a systematic approach is adopted towards
the application of Bahá’í principles towards development. This is a key factor for
the success of Bahá’í projects to the challenges of social and economic
development. According to the Bahá’í International Community:

> Certain Bahá’í development efforts have achieved the
> stature of development organizations with relatively
> complex programmatic structures and significant spheres
> of influence. They systematically train human resources
> and manage a number of lines of action to address
> problems of local communities and regions in a
> coordinated, interdisciplinary manner.31

\[31\] Bahá’í International Community. ‘Bahá’í Development Projects: A Global Process of Learning.’

The components for the application of a systematic approach towards
development stated before. The Ruhi Institute32 is a good example of a successful
Bahá’í project carried on in a systematic way. In regard to the aim of Ruhi Project,
the Universal House of Justice stated:

> Thousands upon thousands, embracing the diversity of the
> entire human family, are engaged in systematic study of
> the Creative Word in an environment that is at once
> serious and uplifting. As they strive to apply through a
> process of action, reflection and consultation the insights
> thus gained, they see their capacity to serve the Cause rise
> to new levels.33

These projects have understood and demonstrated that a systematic, deliberate
process of study, consultation, action and reflection are essential to the success of
any Bahá’í enterprise. Few other examples of Bahá’í inspired social and economic
development projects with application of systematic approach towards
development are stated below to end this chapter:

FUNDAEC (Fundacion para la Aplicacion y Ensenanza de las Ciencias):
FUNDAEC was created in 1974 by a group of scientists and professionals who
were trying to find a more appropriate role for science, technology, and education
in the development of rural areas.34

wanted to serve the community. Over the years, it’s grown into an institution
offering classes through 12th grade, recognised for excellent academics and moral
leadership training. The underlying basis for all the activities of the Mona
Foundation is the belief that the key to poverty reduction and the development of
human resources lies in universal education and gender equality. The belief is that
the individuals most affected are those most ready to affect change. They are the
most capable of promoting tolerance, respecting cultural values, and engaging in
collaboration.35

Badi Foundation: The Foundation was established in Macau in 1990, where it is
registered as a non-profit charitable organisation. It facilitates the establishment of
community-based organisations and strengthen their institutional capacity to work
with local governments and communities to design and implement education and
training programs that release the potential of women and youth living in China’s
rural areas. The Foundation also operates the School of the Nations, an
internationally oriented school in Macau that seeks to foster the intellectual and
moral development of its students in an integrated manner, while developing their
commitment to service to the broader community.36

change on the part of husbands, parents, and children is equally essential. The
Institute continues to work with the women after they return home and conducts

Bahá’í education projects in India. In addition to academic excellence, the school
has long given a high priority to moral education and the promotion of values for
world citizenship. Of equal significance, it has been a proving ground for early
Bahá’í efforts at promoting social and economic development in rural areas.38

Rabbani School: This school is located in Susera, Gwalior, and Madhya Pradesh.
The Rabbani School was established in 1977. Its objective is to provide rural
youth with academic and practical skills for development, combining the teaching
of moral principles with a love for service.39

6\.6   Chapter Conclusion
We need to keep in mind that development agencies, NGOs and faith-based
institutions such as RF are still in transition period and there is a need for shaping
the form of partnerships between different institutions in the future. The issues of
religion are of critical importance in the global agenda and there are many links
between religion and development that are complex and diverse. There is a need
to continue work on building stronger partnerships and alliances between
development agencies and faith based organisations and better understand how the
two work together.

Also, for a socio-economic development project to become successful, it must be
trusted. The reason many governments fail to attract funding from International
Agencies such as ‘the World Bank’, ‘United Nations’ and ‘Canadian International
Development Agency’ is the lack of trust and commitment. In looking at overall
development assistance for poor countries, the international community wants to
make sure that funds are spent in areas in which they are needed. Local

governments receiving the funding must show a genuine commitment to allocate
resources to a specific requirement. The director of Development Dialogue on
Values and Ethics in the World Bank, Katherine Marshall thinks that the poor
work done by governments in certain regions indicates or causes high trust levels
for faith organisations, much higher than for most other institutions such as police,
governments, NGOs and politicians. Therefore, if the objective is to work with
communities, trust is a critical element, and building on and working with the
trust placed in faith organizations is very important. The trustworthiness of the
Foundation as a faith-based institution puts it in a strong position to be engaged in
community development successfully.41 As evidenced by the number of attendees
at the RF, and the involvement of the local people in the project, it is obvious that
the project has succeeded in earning the trust of the community.

As a result of investigative and exploring the Bahá’í teaching on microeconomics
(sustainable production, distributive justice and sustainable consumption) and
macroeconomics (the Bahá’í perspective of globalisation), and Bahá’í
understanding of the concept of development and their implication for the Bahá’í
community and the wider society, the next chapter will introduce a Bahá’í-
inspired model of economic sustainability. This will be a theoretical model based
on the previous five chapters and joining them as different components of the
market.

7\.1    Introduction
The market is in conflict with itself and with its participants and stakeholders
frequently. Conflict and inconsistency lead to the market being unbalanced or
reaching a disequilibrium position. Hypothesise of economic theories is achieving
maximum gain. In New-classical economics, it is assumed that the interests of
owners or shareholders are the most important. Just as consumers attempt to
maximise utility and workers attempt to maximise their rewards from working,
shareholders will be motivated solely by maximising their gain from the
company, suppliers are interested to deal with larger companies, and government
is addicted and dependent on taxes.2 In all these instances, conflicts of objectives
arise in the market, which hinder equilibrium. The reason is that each actor or
agent in the market considers one’s own gain, while disregarding the collective
interests of the whole; and as long as ‘the spirit of unity, of cooperation and of
selfless service’3 is absent in the market, the challenges of the market will not be
resolved. Having identified some of the challenges and inconsistencies of the

attach much importance to your numerical strength, but should always try to foster among you the
spirit of unity, of cooperation and of selfless service. For these alone constitute the true standard
according to which your activities should be judged and estimated.’

market, this theoretical description of economic variables provide an alternative
approach to balancing the market. Without denouncing the role of pricing, the
proposition in this model is that by incorporating and embracing moral incentives
into the actions and behaviours of the participants of the market, we can reach
equilibrium. The model is a simplified representation of the application of Bahá’í
teachings on economics in balancing the market in a sustainable way, or the eco
well-being.

7\.2   The rational for the model of economic sustainability
The modern market is a complex system of organisation. The proponents of the
free market economy claim that the market is self-correcting and consumers and
producers know best what to consume and what to produce, and they are behaving
rationally, and the market eventually reach equilibrium. Others, on the other hand,
argue, the fact that there is high unemployment, negative externality,
underproduction of public goods, poverty, and an increasing gap between the rich
and the poor, are indications that the market is not self-correcting. The 2008
global financial crisis led to the entire market to have extreme fluctuation for a
long period of time. Of course, fluctuation in the business cycle of any market is
normal, but it is possible to eliminate the extremes. Hence, the argument in this
model is that there are growing challenges and problems in the economy that both
the market and the government have failed to address. Without denouncing the
role of government and the position of the free market economy and the pricing
system, the Bahá’í inspired model suggests that spiritual principles and moral
incentives should become a part of the formula for sustainability and achieving
equilibrium. A market requires participants to interact with each other for the

exchange of commodities. The moral incentives are important for the quality of
relationship among the participants of the market.

Alternatively, it would be advantageous to examine the working of the market and
to know how it functions under different conditions, and see more clearly what is
valuable and what is not. For example, markets give consumers a choice of
commodities to buy.           Clearly this is valuable. However, the choice of
commodities on the market does not necessarily reflect what people want to buy,
or what is good for society. Market mechanism, according to Joseph Carens ‘is
simply a social device adopted to serve the goals of the community.’4 Hence, the
resources such as land, labour, and capital are justified only if they are beneficial
to the community. Also, resource holders such as entrepreneurs have to act in
ways that are beneficial to the community. Other issues concern false
advertisements, which mislead innocent and more vulnerable customers into
purchasing items that they would otherwise not buy. This is clearly wasting
resources.

In this model, human activities are closely linked to human values and moral
incentives. For example, this model supports the view that our economy cannot be
in isolation from nature and human values. As stated by Shoghi Effendi ‘We
cannot segregate the human heart from the environment outside us.’                            5

Sustainability therefore requires that the activities within the market be in
harmony with the laws of nature, otherwise we may face severe consequences.

Economic Theory, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1981, p. 189.

\[5\] Shoghi Effendi. Conservation of the Earth’s Resources, p. iii.

This view provides the very basis for a vigorous system of global economic
system, also suggested by Jeffrey Sachs. Development ecologist William Rees
popularised the concept of the ‘ecological footprint’, which he defined as ‘the
impact of a person or community on the environment, expressed as the amount of
land required to sustain their use of natural resources.’ 6 And the Ecological
Footprint indicator attempts ‘to measure the amount of renewable and
nonrenewable ecologically productive land area that is required to support the
resources demands and absorb the waste of a given population or specific
activities.’ 7 He believes that there is a need to have a new, global cultural
narrative. He writes:

> We must learn to override our innate expansionist
> tendencies and abandon our perpetual growth myth.
> Instead of forcing the environment to conform to our
> demands we must learn to adapt our expectations to
> ecological reality. A good start would be a new global
> cultural narrative that shifts the values of society from
> competitive individualism, greed, and narrow self-interest,
> towards community, cooperation, and our collective
> interest in repairing the earth survival.8

Economic growth for Rees, therefore, is a question of moral judgement and taking
account of moral principles when making decisions. According to him increasing
human capacity facilitates effective moral decision-making. Expounding on this
Rees writes:

> Our most human qualities must prevail – our capacity for
> reason, our capacity for forward planning, our ability to
> make moral judgements, our compassion for other people
> and other species. If we use these qualities in a great

> expression of collective intelligence on both the local and
> global scales, humanity can become sustainable.9

Incorporating Rees’ views with the Bahá’í thinking, it can be said that in the long
run there is a need to limit the growth, regulate the market, pursue a moderate
lifestyle, educate children, junior youths and youths to know the purpose of life,
and understand the concept of ‘world citizenship’, creating a culture of
moderation in all aspects of life.

How do we get from our present market condition to a more sensible, equitable
and sustainable world? The model argue that a one-dimensional solution adopted
mainly through monetary instruments would not be effective in dealing with such
market inconsistencies. The Bahá’í writings assert ‘The trouble with our
economics [is that] …its system and application have been purely material,
instead of material and spiritual.’10 Hence, the proposition in this model is to
consider a multi-dimensional approach to the market equilibrium and
sustainability - monetary and non-monetary. The model suggests a process of
‘adjustment of means of livelihood in human society,’11 which requires a change
in lifestyle for all participants of the market. The model supports the definition of
sustainability and sustainable development stated by the Brundtland Commission
of the United Nations:

> Sustainable development is development that meets the
> needs of the present without compromising the ability of
> the future generations to meet their own needs.12

7\.3   The illustration of the model
Figure 1 demonstrates the different parts of the Bahá’í-inspired model of
economic sustainability, with unity as the nucleus. The pillars are the four
spiritual principles of moderation, cooperation, consultation and compassion.
These pillars provide the foundation and support for the proper functioning of the
rest of the model. The next part of the model shows the resources necessary for
the smooth functioning of the cycle of production. These are human resources,
physical resources, and financial resources. The outer part is the cycle of
production, which includes needs and wants, organisations, sustainable
production, the market, distributive justice, and sustainable consumption. The
close and inseparable connection between the spiritual principles, the efficiency of
resources, and the cycle of production is at the heart of this model and captures its
meaning and purpose. These principles are necessary for an effective planning
process. For the model to be effective, the entirety of the model must be studied
and considered. All parts of this model are complementary and interconnected.

UNITY

Figure 1: The Bahá’í inspired model of economic sustainability

7\.4    Unity as the nucleus of the model in the market
At the centre of this model is the core principle of unity of thoughts and actions
for maintaining reciprocity and acting responsibly by all participants in the market
towards each other. By unity means ‘the spirit of unity.’13 Unity, in a sense that
people are concerned, interconnected and responsible for the needs of each other,
recognise human well-being as a human right, and accept that the suffering of
others will affect their own comfort in the long run. Thinking of humanity as one
entity, whether it is in a small community or in the wider society, can be effective
in resource efficiency. Unity in a sense that one’s feeling and thinking is in
harmony with one’s action. This way of thinking by various participants helps the
coordination of various activities in the market and its stability. The success of
many economic models and theories are based on the principle of unity. Examples
include, comparative advantage, which is two-sided trade and requires
harmonious association between the two parties. The success of a single currency,
whether regional or international, is based on unity among member countries. The
equilibrium between the supply and demand is best achieved if consumers and
producers act towards each other sensibly and conscientiously. In similar fashion,
we can apply the concept of ‘the spirit of unity’ to other economic ideas. Unity,
therefore, is the nucleus, and a prerequisite for establishing market equilibrium. It
is the core principle that acts like a catalyst to create a balance in the market and
to maintain it in the long run. Unity acts like a bridge between the micro and
macro- economics when the attitude is shifted from individual self-interest to the

\[13\] Shoghi Effendi, letter written on his behalf dated 10 August 1933, quoted in True Foundation of
All Economics, p. 56.

collective well-being and prosperity of the entire economy. To practice unity
requires universal participation by all stakeholders in accepting responsibility and
creating and maintaining a balance in using resources. Hence, one of the
applications of the principle of unity is to coordinate human, financial, and
physical resources in favour of all participants of the market, justly and fairly.

7\.5   The spiritual principles and moral incentives
The application and understanding of the working definition of ‘spirituality’ as a
‘unifying factor’ and as a relational factor, discussed in chapter 1 is vital for this
model. It is defined as the process of unifying, developing and interconnecting our
life with the material world, with other people, with our environment, and with
the future generations, beyond ourselves. This definition is important for
qualitative purposes and also provides measurable meaning to most parts of the
model; hence it would be valuable and appealing to social scientists, including
economists. A crucial requirement of this model is that it uses moral incentives as
a major source of motivation for economic activities. By ‘moral incentives’ I
mean incentives based on the desire to serve society or to perform one’s duty to
society. Hence, supporting the Bahá’í work ethic principle (chapter 2) of ‘work
done in a spirit of service is considered as worship.’

The spiritual principles of moderation, compassion, consultation, and cooperation
are considered vital for the application of the ‘unifying factor’, and for the
effective functioning of this model. The application of the principle of
cooperation would allow smaller businesses to enter or to stay in the market
without the fear of bitter and aggressive competition forcing them out of the

market. Cooperation, therefore, stimulates enterprise, thereby increasing the level
of output and consequently employment, and generating more revenue for
government. Also, a consultative method of decision-making suggests that
employees are participating in making those decisions that affect their own
working life. This system of decision-making is motivating to the workforce and
creates in them a sense of belonging to the organisation. The result is less
wastage, less absenteeism, higher productivity, and more revenue for an
organisation, all of which are measurable and help in achieving organisational
objectives such as growth and increased profit. All these factors are quantifiable.

Moderation (chapter 4, section 4.5) is another core spiritual principle for this
model. Moderation has important implications in economics through resource
allocation in the market.     If sustainability is about resource efficiency and
consideration of other people, the environment and the future generation, then
moderation plays a vital role in achieving sustainability. Moderation affects all
aspects of the market including lifestyle, the size of business and its expansion
and the environment. One important economic objective of moderation expressed
in this model is the focus on the elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty.

Another spiritual basis for this model is the principle of compassion. The use of
the analogy of family is particularly relevant to elaborate this principle. The
family unit lives within the society and is not isolated. Thus, different families
have relationships with each other. The comfort of the family unit is dependent on
the well-being of the neighbours and many more families in the community. This
is important because the principle of compassion effectively works within this

unit of society. The family becomes much more sensitive and understanding of
the needs of others when they realise that their own comfort is dependent on the
well-being and comfort of others. The idea that it is good to be concerned about
the welfare of others has been a central theme in many religious traditions. The
notion of family is considered here for further analysis of mutual or communal
relationship. When we use to analogy of family life, it yields the principle that a
mutual or communal orientation is helpful in families and is harmful when
interests are dominated by concern for the welfare of self, only. An empirical
study done by Wesley Burr, Loren Marks and Randal Day shows that when
families shows a high interest to the welfare of others, the benefit goes to the
entire community. They write:

> This principle has several assertions. It asserts that when
> lifestyles emphasise self so much that it interferes with
> interest and concern for others, this decreases the
> probability that family members will find successes in
> their family life. Also, when the primary concerns are the
> welfare, goals, and concerns of others, and people do not
> focus on their own needs, this too is harmful. The
> probability of successes is highest when people focus
> primarily on the needs of others but also wisely attend to
> their own needs and interests.14

There is a growing scholarly literature that argues for the validity of the analogy
of family. Burr, Marks and Day conclude that the data is so persuasive that being
responsive to others in a non-contingent manner promotes the welfare of others is
the most important beneficial process in communal relationships. Applying the
principle of compassion to the wider community means looking after our own
personal and family comfort and happiness without forgetting the need of others.

\[14\] Burr, Marks, and Day. Sacred Matters: Religion and Spirituality in Families, p. 112.

This view can be developed further through education and better understanding of
the concept of ‘world citizenship.’ The notion of compassion, therefore, has close
links with the principle of distributive justice (chapter 3), and sustainable
consumption in the cycle of production.

Consultation is another spiritual principle for effective operation of the model.
One of the problems related to sustainable development is the inability of some
participants in the market to take a shared view of social, economic,
environmental and spiritual factors, and use a collective decision-making process.
With the main goal being unity and coordination of activities in the face of
increasingly interdependent and complex socio-economic and environmental
challenges, this model stresses that more mature methods of collective decision-
making are now imperative. The proposition is that a consultative method of
decision-making helps producers and consumers and other stakeholders of the
market carry out an effective planning process. A collective method of decision-
making influences all aspects of resource allocation and different stages of the
cycle of production in designing, implementing and coordinating the programs
that affect all participants. Increasingly, more organisations are learning that by
exercising the method of collective decision-making through consultation, and by
involving and empowering the workers in the process, the company saves
resources. When applied, this method provides an opportunity for each person to
contribute to the process of achieving the goals. This in turn influences the
relationships and subsequently improves the behaviour of individual members of
an organisation focussing on environmentally friendly products. Sustainability
requires the principle of consultation to be applied not only for creating better

working conditions and improving the input-output process, but also indirectly to
preserve the ecosystem. Challenges such as environmental issues require global
solutions and collective actions, which will be more effective through the
application of effective consultation among policy makers. However, there are
challenges in the application of effective consultation. People, applying this
method must be familiar with the features of an effective method of consulting
together.

The principle of cooperation (chapter 2 section 2.5.7) indicates that the
fundamental economic relationship amongst the agents of the market is one of
reciprocal actions, and the interdependent nature of human beings. The basis of
this reciprocal action is an honest and sincere commitment to faithfully do as has
been mutually agreed. In this model, cooperation is preferred to competition,
which is the current practice in the market. The application of this principle in the
market is advantageous for all participants. The argument in favour of cooperation
in this model goes beyond the scope of the market and the economy. Its essential
properties are ‘…inherent in the unified system of the world of existence.’15 The
emphasis is on the moral facet that cooperation and not competition is the cause
of social activities just as the life of an organism is maintained by cooperation of
the various elements of which it is composed. The basis of life is ‘mutual aid and
helpfulness, and the cause of destruction and non-existence would be the
interruption of this mutual assistance. The more the world aspires to civilisation
the more this important matter of cooperation becomes manifest.’16

\[15\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Huququ’lláh, p. 21.

\[16\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Bahá’í World, vol. 3, p. 154.

To summarise, these four spiritual principles constitute the spiritual foundation of
the model. Sustainability requires the exercise of moderation, with consideration
and compassion, through the art of consultation, and effective cooperation in all
parts of the market. Putting these four spiritual principles together helps to attain
an effective planning process for all participants of the market, which is essential
to accomplish equilibrium in the cycle of production and achieve sustainability.

7\.6      The human, financial and physical resources
The optimal allocation of resources is essential for the market and the whole
economy when considering what to produce, how to produce and for whom to
produce. The three major resources are human, financial and physical with great
interdependency between them. Obviously the combination of the use of various
groups of resources depends on the nature and complexity of the business and the
whole market.

There is a growing recognition that investment in people is the key to
development. Torrington, Hall and Taylor maintain that ‘There is a move towards
redressing that balance in search for an equilibrium between needs for financial
viability and success in the marketplace on the one hand and the need to
maximize human capital on the other.’17 In any line of work it is essential to adopt
a program of continued training and professional development. This feature is
highly valued and encouraged in this model. Companies and the whole market
should be concerned with the health and education of the workforce. Thus, the

\[17\] Torrington, Hall and Taylor. Human Resource Management, p. 5.

heart of the issue with human resources is the skills-base of the business. Human
capital plays a critical role in today’s knowledge-based economy and is hence
considered as the most valuable resource of a company. To have a viable business
the employer obviously require those who do the work to produce an appropriate
and effective performance and the performance, in great part, come from
employees. According to Torrington, Hall and Taylor ‘it is the efforts and
activities of employees which are the basis of competitive advantage for a
business.’18 We may argue that factors of production such as capital and natural
resources are inactive; this means if they are left to themselves, nothing would
happen. Human resources are the active elements that gather capital, exploit
natural resources, establish social and political organisations, produce goods and
services, and carry out innovations and other development activities.

Financial resources are concerned with the ability of the business to finance its
chosen strategies for investment in new products, distribution channels, and
production capacity, which place great strain on the business finances. Such a
strategy needs to be very carefully managed from a financial perspective. Issues
that would have financial implications for budgets and cash flow or that are
related to the essential plant or machinery required to manufacture products, or
processes in need of finance, need to be considered. The financial needs also
depend on whether these are very specialised, or are required for short or long
term.

\[18\] Torrington, Hall and Taylor. Human Resource Management, p. 6.

7\.7   The cycle of production
Using the four key spiritual principles as the foundation, and the three types of
resources, we are now in a position to construct the rest of the model. The failure
of the market could be either because of lack of resources or is associated with
problems in different phases of the cycle of production. The understanding and
application of spiritual principles provide the much-needed balance between the
monetary and non-monetary aspects of the cycle of production.

Needs and wants are the beginning of most economic activities. What motivates
people and can lead to a change of behaviour are their needs and wants, which are
determined by the individual and the wider social factors. Once the necessities are
identified, then a behaviour pattern will emerge to gratify them. When conflict
arises between needs and wants, one’s behaviour is affected. However, it should
be noted that needs and wants vary at different times in a person’s life. Not all
needs and wants are important for a person at any one time. People perceive
necessities and luxuries differently at different times in their lives. These also
depend on one’s personality, the level of income, the type of employment, one’s
social environment and one’s life-style. Essential commodities such as food,
clothes and housing, and certain types of services such as health and education
that provide for physical, intellectual and spiritual health and development, are
basic human rights and most fundamental. Economics is concerned with
satisfying needs and wants, but wants are created by society. By changing the
value system of society, ‘wants’ could be modified and the economic system
transformed. The aim of this phase of economic sustainability is to attain the
greatest satisfaction of needs and wants within the limits of moderation.

In the next phase, organisations with different scales of capacity, and at different
levels (local, national and international, or private and public), are created, aiming
to satisfy consumers’ needs and wants. Organisations, to a great extent, respond to
consumer demand. At the same time, using their own innovative ideas, with or
without consideration of consumers’ actual needs and wants, they create
incentives for consumers to buy what is produced or invented. The effectiveness
of demand and supply depends on the application of spiritual principles along
with consumer education and organisational behaviour. Organisational values are
generally associated with areas such as the operation management, human
resources, working environment, the culture, the marketing, the financial aspect,
and the supply chain. One factor that has contributed to unsustainability of the
market is unlimited growth in the size of organisations. Disproportionate
expansion of the scale of an organisation may become a problem for the market,
for the environment, and even a disadvantage to the organisation itself. The
proposition in this model is that the practice of moderation would limit unlimited
expansion of businesses, hence allowing small and medium size businesses to
survive.

The production stage is a process of transforming resources into valuable output.
Two issues are significant when discussing sustainable production. First, the
model considers the fundamental purpose as safeguarding the collective interest.
Relating this view to production, one can envisage a world where the products can
be shared and distributed more evenly among its citizens. Second is the concept of
unity among participants of a market, which, along with four fundamental

spiritual principles, are the operating principles and practical requirements for
well-being in the market. This suggests the achievement of a dynamic coherence
between the spiritual and practical requirements of life. Therefore, success and
effectiveness of an organisation is producing commodities that are demanded by
conscientious consumers and at the same time contemplating on the effective and
efficient use of resources. This requires establishing a sustainable input-output
process. This indicates that sustainability would depend on all stages of
production, including the extraction of raw materials, conversion processes, the
quality of the finished product, and the supply chain. The quality of commodities
not only depends on the available resources, including human, financial and
physical resources, but also the quality of organisational leadership.

The product produced by organisations then enters the market. The model
promotes sustainable trade as an effective method for doing business. The benefits
are numerous if the markets are developed, organised, managed, and regulated
properly. With satisfactory arrangements and adequate structures in place, the
market can generate more cooperation among its participants, with greater
opportunity for those vulnerable firms entering the market to trade their products
in a fair environment. The main economic implication of globalisation is that
economic activities in different markets around the world have become
interrelated and interdependent. Hence, an important aspect of the Bahá’í inspired
model of economic sustainability is the interdependency of various markets.
There is a close connection between the market and the allocation of resources.
The model suggests several factors necessary for an effective functioning and fair
trade in the market. The guiding principles include: removal or reduction of the

middleman; a just and moderate rate of interest to facilitate the growth of small
businesses; and a progressive income tax to make wealth and income distribution
more effective. Also, a profit sharing scheme to consider workers as partners
rather than just wage earners. Profit sharing may remove the damaging effect that
the wage system produces in the market, in particular where the wage is below the
market equilibrium wage level.

The next phase of the model is the recognition of the need for distributive justice
as an effective way for allocation of resources, rather than the one currently used
in the market with its consequence of increasing the gap between the rich and the
poor. Fairness provides an opportunity for all to enjoy the benefits that are created
in the market. The key feature here is to create a positive relationship between
distributive justice and human well-being. Though efficiency is important, it is not
the only economic goal of the market. Economic efficiency and fairness should go
hand in hand. Thus, the challenge of sustainability is not only consumer education
in productivity and market efficiency, but also in the effective distribution of the
income and wealth that are created. This model supports the progressive income
tax currently practiced in most markets as a method of balancing extremes of
wealth and poverty. This involves active participation of government in advancing
a more equitable society, which in turn benefits the market. Government
intervention is needed to establish legislation for redistribution of income and
wealth, for wage determination and the transfer of monetary resources from the
rich to the poor. However, the model suggests a combination of legislation and
voluntary contribution as methods of eco- justice for the market.

The final phase of the cycle of production is sustainable consumption. The
relationship between consumption and production is complex and varied, and has
changed over time and certainly will continue to do so in the future. Consumption
is a necessary aspect of human being, a practice that has constituted an important
part of human existence and social life in all societies throughout human history.
The advancement in knowledge and technology, and the globalisation of affairs,
has led to the speed of trade and, hence to a substantial increase in level of output.
Such an increase in the level of commodities requires large markets to disperse
the products. In the model of economic sustainability, therefore, the main focus is
on sustainability of both production and consumption. The rationale in this phase
is that the act of consumption should be associated with using products more
sensibly, and hence, the cycle of production would repeat itself more safely and in
a sustainable way. Since the cycle of production is going to be repeated,
acceptable choices become essential for purchasing commodities by those
participating in the market. This ensures that sustainable products are entering to
the market in the new cycle. Thus, careful planning is necessary at all levels. The
consumption expenditure is the largest part in aggregate expenditure in a market.
Any change in the pattern of consumption will have important effects on the
aggregate demand and supply in the whole market. The components of aggregate
demand are factors such as consumer spending, investment, government
spending, and international trade, including export and import. Human, financial,
and physical resources, on the other hand, will affect aggregate supply in an entire
market. Responsible and educated consumers who are practicing moderation
affect the aggregate demand. Committed suppliers, who apply trustworthiness and
fairness in the working environment, on the other hand, affect the aggregate

supply. The application of the spiritual principles of this model influences the
effective operation of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. To have an impact
on consumer choice, emphasis in this model is on creating a culture of moderation
and compassion. The issues of consumerism, consumer society and unsustainable
life style could be remedied if participants of the market in general and consumers
in particular exercise moderation.

7\.8   The analysis of the model
The spiritual principles, although not sufficient by themselves, are necessary for
establishing sustainability. Each of these spiritual principles must become so
embedded in the individuals’ lives, and in society, that applying them would be a
norm, a culture, and a way of life. Households in particular, although small in
size, can have a large-scale effect on the market. For example, decisions made by
a family as to the type of food, the kind of clothes, or the housing condition not
only influence production, but also can affect the environment. By being
conscientious consumers and producers, even about seemingly insignificant
issues, one can facilitate sustainability.

However, the model of economic sustainability may be challenged on a number of
areas. For example, the core principle of unity can be challenged because
currently there are many obstacles for the transformation of consciousness, such
as doubts, misconceptions, prejudices, suspicions and narrow self-interest. Such
challenges require the society to ‘… change its attitudes before a solution to social

problems can be found.’19 Hence, based on the practicality of the concept of ‘the
spirit of unity’ for a market, the model is more suitable for smaller communities
with specific features asked by the model. In other words, the challenge for the
Bahá’í community is that Bahá’ís live in a world where not everybody shares their
moral and spiritual principles. Bahá’ís, as part of larger society, face the
challenges of attaining a sustainable life-style where there exist an unfair
redistribution of wealth and income.

The analogy of family used in this model also requires further consideration. The
challenge is that the analogy of family may be too simplistic for the kind of
complex markets we are witnessing. The critics of this model may not consider
the market as a family unit, as families are more concerned with their own ‘flesh
and blood’ rather than other people’s needs and welfare. Therefore, as much as
there may be elements of sacrifice, compassion and cooperation within a family,
these are not necessarily reflected in the life of the community. However,
researchers consider the model of family as the backbone of the society and as a
small unit representing the larger society.20 There also are a number of scholars
who have developed rational arguments for the idea that it is helpful for families
to have high interest in the welfare of self and others. Burr, Marks and Day further
observe that the principle of family has several assertions. It asserts that when
lifestyles emphasis self so much that it interferes with interest and concern for
others, this decreases the probability that family members will find successes in
their family life. Also, when the primary concerns are the welfare, goals, and

concerns of others, and people do not focus on their own needs, this too is
harmful. The probability of successes is highest when people focus primarily on
the needs of others but also wisely attend to their own needs and interests.21

The model considers consumer education necessary for achieving sustainable
consumption in the market, although it is not sufficient in itself. There are other
areas that need to be carefully considered. For example, consumer education and
the free will for making choice become irrelevant if there is monopoly power in
the market, limiting consumer choices. Consumer education becomes irrelevant if
the objective is how much to produce without attention to the underlying reason
for production. The question the market should consider in the first instance is
what to produce rather than how much to produce, as sustainable consumption
and sustainable production are complementary. Both groups must be mindful of
the effects of their decisions and actions for the present and future generations,
and for the environment. The Bahá’í writings advise Bahá’ís to ‘Bring thyself to
account each day, ere thou art summoned to a reckoning…’. All participants in
the market need to check the consequences of their actions. Therefore, being
discerning consumers and responsible producers can facilitate and ensure
sustainability. Considering the ‘why’ question principle of economics, the key
spiritual principles are beneficial and lead to conscientious consumption and
production. The realisation that the material world is a reflection of the spiritual
world promotes various components of goods and services that are befitting
human dignity. Figure 2 shows a summary of the interrelation of the spiritual and
material means in the cycle of production.

\[21\] Burr, Marks and Day, Sacred Matters: religion and spirituality in families, p. 112.

Reliance on moral incentives has been an important element in many models of
ideal socio-politico-economic systems. According to specialist in social policy,
Peter Lambert ‘Contemporary Western social scientists frequently suggest,
however, that moral incentives could not be an effective source of motivation for
economic activities in large, complex, politico-economic systems, at least in the
long run.’ 22 Based on this view, the judgement is that reliance on income
incentives is inevitable for any large, complex system, which seeks to persuade a
consistently high level of effort from its members. Examples include the operation
of industries such as railways, water, and electricity, which necessitates being
large in scale or what is known as natural monopolies.              Thus, according to
Lambert ‘…one crucial task for the analysis is to show how moral incentives, in a
socio-politico-economic system which relies heavily on the market, could
theoretically substitute for income incentives without destroying the ability of the
market to function.’ 23 Political theorist, Joseph Carens argues that ‘The term
“moral incentives” may suggest a type of motivation which is essentially
altruistic. By contrast, income incentives in a market system are often regarded as
the archetype of motivation through appeal to self-interest.’24 The Bahá’í inspired
model, however includes moral incentive and material incentive as essential part
of the market to function effectively.

Furthermore, the model suggests the need for a combination of quantitative and
qualitative factors to achieve sustainability. However, the scales for social

desirability and more implicit measurements for ethical and spiritual
achievements are not created yet. For instance, in spite of the important role of
cooperation in the market, competition plays an important role. Also, the
argument can be presented that the market do not support spiritual principles and
moral incentives because they are difficult to grasp and cannot be positioned in
mathematical diagrams, or it cannot be measured, as people have to think beyond
monetary gain. However, my working definition of spirituality is not only
important for qualitative purpose, but it also provides measurable meaning to
most parts of an economy, and hence would be valuable and appealing to social
scientists including economists. The definition contains some elements of
measurability. For example, the spiritual principles of compassion, cooperation,
consultation, moderation, justice and fairness play vital role for the application of
the ‘unifying and relational factor’, and for the effective functioning of the
economy. These principles, although qualitative, can lead to measurable
outcomes. Moderation, for example, has important implication in economics
through resource allocation. Moderation affects all aspects of the economy in
regards to poverty reduction, a limit to growth, waste reduction, budgetary
control, cost efficiency, and effective income distribution, all of which are
quantitative and measurable. The outcome of these spiritual principles is the
effective allocation of resources, so vital for economists and other fields in
science. In this sense, spirituality leads to improve the monetary performance, it
measure and assess output, and it becomes the mathematics device of social
sciences. As john Maynard Keynes writes: ‘…economics is a moral science… It
deals with introspection and with values.’25 The Universal House of Justice refers

> presents a perspective which harmonises with that which

> dynamic, a will, an aspiration, which facilitate the
> discovery and implementation of practical measures.26

In conclusion: The development of this model with its suggested components for
the cycle production shown in figure 2 suggests a smooth process in the creation
of a sustainable market. The ideas of this model is available for those who wish to
construct ‘a more stable, prosperous, and equitable economy.’ 27 This model,
therefore, is a means to an end rather than an end in itself.

Chapter 8: Thesis Conclusion
This research attempted to ascertain the relationship between the spiritual, moral
and economic teachings of the Bahá’í faith. The proposition was, that despite the
conventional and contemporary economic thinking that economic problems could
be resolved through purely economic policies, the Bahá’í writings emphasise the
need for spirituality and morality as part of the solution. The findings of this
research, which was mainly from studying Bahá’í writings and the relevant
literature by non-Bahá’í scholars, philosophers and writers indicated that there is
not enough academic theological and economic research carried out on this
subject. Consequently, extensive explanation, interpretation and analysis of
Bahá’í teachings on economics provided in this work, make the current
dissertation the first of its kind.

This research systematically explored and classified the Bahá’í teachings on
economics into four groupings: sustainable production, distributive justice,
sustainable consumption, and globalisation. This combination is noted in Bahá’í
writings and is acceptable to academia. In addition, a Bahá’í-inspired model of
economic sustainability is devised and recommended as an alternative to the
existing approaches currently prevalent in the market for establishing market
equilibrium. The proposed model is a theoretical representation of Bahá’í
teachings through a network of human actions. The investigation of Bahá’í
teachings on economics will not be adequate without consideration of the Bahá’í
approach towards development. For this, a field trip was undertaken to investigate
a Bahá’í-inspired social and economic development project in Bangladesh, which

originally began by the author of this research in early 1979. The purpose was to
see the contribution of Bahá’í community towards rural development.

The exploration of the Bahá’í sacred scriptures and the research carried out by
Bahá’í scholars indicated that the founders of this faith did not construct a Bahá’í
economic system. As a result, throughout this research the assumption is made
that the Bahá’í faith is a religion and not an economic enterprise. Nevertheless,
the central figures of the Bahá’í faith have provided a number of principles that
can be used as guidelines to help future economists to develop the components of
a just, universal and flexible economic system. Therefore, in any Bahá’í
discourse, researchers use the phrase ‘Bahá’í economics’ with much caution, as it
is not yet fully developed.

The investigation and exploration of the Bahá’í writings and the role of the Bahá’í
faith in economic behaviour for this research was carried out with a number of
prerequisites and assumptions as follows: Religious beliefs are likely to influence
the actions and lifestyle of Bahá’ís; this was explored in relation to individuals,
the institutions and the community. The contribution of the Bahá’í faith to the
subject of economics is essentially indirect and is mainly directed to the spiritual
solution of economic problems. Economics is considered a means to achieve the
end, which is promoting unity of humankind. There is coherence between material
and spiritual aspects of life, which suggests that the global economic condition
would be more sustainable when these two components are balanced. The Bahá’í

teachings should be seen ‘as an organic, logically coherent whole,’ 1 which
suggests that Bahá’í teachings are complementary in nature and any Bahá’í
discourse should consider the entirety of Bahá’í writings rather than individual
teachings in isolation. Consideration of interdependency of the behaviour of
nations from every aspect: social, political, environmental, economic, moral and
spiritual, which indicates that nations cannot be self-sufficient completely. The
universality of Bahá’í principles on economics helps to resolve the economic
issues, like all other major difficulties facing humanity today, on a world-
encompassing scale to safeguard the interests of humanity as a whole. Spirituality
is understood and interpreted as ‘all-unifying agency,’ which is central standard
for an effective relationship, however, with different methodology and
approaches.

A growing number of economists, philosophers, writers and experts now support
the view that moral incentives should be part of modern scientific economics. It is
argued that economics, as a social science, and religion are not the same. In other
words, they do not generate the same outcome, or have the same effect on people,
but the effective partnership of the two entities fosters human well-being. It was
argued that religion and economics combined are potent forces for resolving
socio-politico-economic problems. On one hand, the Bahá’í literatures advocate
gender equality to alleviate poverty and inequality, ending discrimination,
creating strong families, and exercising moderation, compassion, honesty, good
character and. On the other hand, economic literatures and academic textbooks

emphasis the role of saving and capital formation, sound use of money and
banking, the specialisation and trade, entrepreneurship, the role of government
and legislation, efficient use of resources, equilibrium in price system, and
promoting growth. Consequently, the two disciplines of religion and economics
together would be able to have greater impact on resolving social, and economic
issues.

My findings indicate that although a number of Bahá’í teachings are currently
practised at various levels, bringing a fundamental change to the life of individual
Bahá’ís, the families, the Bahá’í community and the wider society, but it would
not be an easy task. To facilitate the process of change and make it more effective
and functional, there is a need for a fundamental change in human attitudes
towards management of life-style for both poor and rich people. In the current
research, recommendations were made for better understanding of the meaning of
prosperity, the significance of wealth, the meaning of happiness, the concept of
work and service, and how faith organisations can contribute to the development
of communities. At this point of the development of the Bahá’í community there
is a need to initiate a process of moral and spiritual education as a necessary step
for familiarising Bahá’ís with the fundamentals and components of future
economic system. Hence, by identifying a number of distinctive Bahá’í principles
on economics, this dissertation, hopefully, would be of great assistance to the
Bahá’í community.

Several distinctive Bahá’í principles were identified and discussed. ‘Work as
worship’ was recognised and explored as one of the distinctive principle on

Bahá’í work ethics. The study of Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í literature indicates that
there is a close relationship between work ethics and the level of production, both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Among moral teachings discussed in relation to
work ethics is the statement of the founder of this faith, Bahá’u’lláh, ‘noble have I
created thee.’ The word noble described as being noble in character such as
honesty, trustworthiness, truthfulness and more. This inspires Bahá’ís to engage in
practising and promoting those values necessary for moral leadership and a more
effective operation of business enterprise. A number of Bahá’í scholars
recommended that this way of thinking may lead to the production of those goods
and services that are befitting human dignity. It was argued that the reason for
producing harmful and unnecessary products is that there is a high demand for
them, or consumers are deceived with misleading advertisement. Hence, it is
suggested that with an adequate consumer education there would not be a demand
for harmful products.

I also discussed a number of Bahá’í moral, spiritual and social teachings that
affect the level of output and hence the supply of workforce in the labour market.
A significant moral principle discussed was that Bahá’ís are forbidden to remain
idle. However, the Bahá’í writings have not suggested alternatives where there is
nonexistence or shortage of work for everyone. It was indicated that Bahá’ís are
forbidden to beg under any circumstances, which would have an indirect effect on
the size of the workforce in the labour market. A distinction was made, however,
between assisting those who beg professionally and those who are poor because
they are incapable of working, or their earnings are not sufficient for adequate
living.

Among the social teachings, the one that was singled out in this research was
investment in the development of human resources. In any line of work and in a
competitive labour market, it is essential to adopt a program of continued training
and professional development. This feature is highly encouraged, valued and
practised in the Bahá’í community and in most business organisations operating in
a modern working environment. According to Bahá’í writing and observing the
Bahá’í community, two unique principles that contribute greatly to human
resource development were discussed in this dissertation. First is the principle of
‘universal and compulsory education’, with particular emphasis on the education
of girls. These principles have inspired the Bahá’í community to embrace a
culture of learning. Second is the application of the principle of ‘equal opportunity
for women and men.’ The Bahá’í view presented in this research is that an
astounding capacity is latent in women, and this must be discovered, developed
and utilised. I maintained that creating opportunities for women in social and
economic activities may greatly affect the level of output produced and as a result
increase the supply of the workforce and as a result the level of production of
commodities.

One aspect of this research was related to sustainable production and the issue
related to out of proportion of the growth of organisations. An argument was
presented that in modern times, some organisations are involved in misleading
marketing activities for survival, growth and increasing profit without
consideration of the consumers’ actual needs. Also, some business organisations
have been grown up so large that as they failed, the entire market has suffered.

Therefore, the need for organisational restructuring was recommended. Accepting
moral leadership on the one hand and consumer education on the other hand will
make it possible to create a more balanced and sustainable market with fewer
fluctuations in the economic cycle. In such a market, those goods and services
will be produced that are made by trustworthy businesses and demanded by
informed and responsible consumers. To deal with such situations, reference was
made to a number of Bahá’í teachings that are valuable for consumer and
producer education and consequently affecting people’s life-style and limiting
organisational growth, including moderation, compassion, cooperation, and
consultation. These spiritual principles are used as the basis for a proposed
Bahá’í-inspired model of economic sustainability to achieve a more balanced
market.

The research of Bahá’í sacred scriptures, and those of Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í
scholars and well-known organisations such as the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund, indicated that increasing the gap between the rich and the poor is
a fundamental economic issue, and can be considered as the most challenging
social and economic problem at the present time. Based on this observation, the
author recommended applying distributive justice as an effective solution to deal
with this matter. This means that a universal standard of justice and fairness
should be incorporated in all stages of the market, so to provide an opportunity for
all to enjoy the benefits of goods and services produced globally. Several Bahá’í
principles related to this subject were identified and discussed, for example issues
related to the creation of wealth. The Bahá’í writings do not consider acquiring
wealth as immoral. However, when dealing with the question of wealth, two

conditions were endorsed: First, wealth has to be acquired by an individual’s own
efforts through an economic activity. Second, the income earned should be spent
not only for one’s own well-being but also for the purpose of philanthropic
activities and for the common good. Currently, the scope of the discussion of
distributive justice within the Bahá’í community is limited to wealth redistribution
on a voluntary basis as a spiritual obligation. For elaboration of the discussion on
wealth, a distinction has been made between ‘means’ and ‘ends’. The morally
right ‘means’ must be chosen for achieving the ‘ends’. Consequently, the
legitimacy of wealth for a Bahá’í depends on how it is earned and on what it is
expended. To appreciate the scope of Bahá’í teachings on wealth distribution and
distributive justice a number of relevant teachings were discussed.

Another branch of the Bahá’í writings on economics considered in this research
was sustainable consumption, or a ‘living-well-life-style’ program. It is suggested
that the social science of economics must be reoriented towards the genuine
development of human well-being in balance with protecting the nature and the
well-being of future generations, and it should not only be for the sake of
economic growth and its measurement. One crucial issue discussed, which causes
imbalance in life-style, is consumerism. I made a distinction between
consumerism and living well. With reference to Bahá’í writings it was
emphasised that living well is considered appropriate, but with moderation in all
aspects, including life-style and trade.

Any discussion about a future economic order must include the concept of
globalisation. The view presented in this research was that the process of

globalisation has begun and is already on its way. Consequently, I have
recommended adopting hopeful and more positive processes towards an
enlightened globalisation, including fair international trade. I identified and
explored a number of principles from the Bahá’í scriptures related to the issue of
globalisation. The challenge is, however, to create an environment based on
mutual trust so that the benefits of globalisation can be distributed fairly and justly
among citizens of the globe.

It is clear that the increasing complexity of the debate in the fields of economics
and religion requires scholarly attempts to create a systematic framework. It is
hoped that by arranging and exploring the Bahá’í teachings on economics, this
research will contribute to the on-going discussions and research in the Bahá’í
community and the wider society. An issue that needs to be addressed in any
future work is that Bahá’ís should consider the work of the scholars and
researchers outside of their own faith while studying the Bahá’í scriptures.
Therefore, it is imperative that further studies and dialogue in this field to be
continued from both within and outside the Bahá’í community. At this time, most
published articles and books reviewed are introductory and primarily speculative
in nature. Therefore, further development of Bahá’í economics needs to be
through dialogue and consultative process.

My final thought and reflection is that although a number of Bahá’í teachings on
economics are working within this community and to some extent have already
influenced the wider society, the Bahá’í faith is not yet in a position to fully
implement its principles on a large scale. Currently there is no Bahá’í state and the

Bahá’í population is small and scattered all over the world. Hence, it is too early
to envisage how Bahá’í economic principles will shape and function at a larger
scale in the future. The main priority at this time is the application of moral and
spiritual principles within the Bahá’í community and to infuse these into the wider
society. Bahá’ís all around the world enthusiastically join and work closely with
any group or organisation that promotes values such as trustworthiness,
truthfulness, justice, kindness, and service to humanity. These core values
enlighten any economic system, now and in the future.
