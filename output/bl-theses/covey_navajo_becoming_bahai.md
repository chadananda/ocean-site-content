ABSTRACT
Most American Indians have remained traditional to their cultural belief systems and
have not converted to an outside religious system without prior coercions of some sort,
historically embedded in the colonization effect. Yet in 1962 over three hundred Navajos,
or, more correctly, Diné Indians, became members of a little known religion that had
originated in the East, the Bahá’í Faith. I argue that those Diné became Bahá’í for three
primary reasons: 1) the new religion’s teachings fulfilled ancient Diné prophecies; 2) its
teachings applied through its institutions provided autonomy and empowered Diné
Bahá’ís individually and as a people; and 3) through the religion’s principle of valuing
the diversity of human cultures, Diné Bahá’ís can practice most of their traditional ways
without opposition or disapproval from non-Diné Bahá’ís. The Diné have two oral
prophecies that Diné Bahá’ís believe are fulfilled by the new religion. I examine those
narratives from a religious, psychological, anthropological, and sociological standpoint in
the historical context of the impact that the Diné’s Long Walk and imprisonment at Bos
Redondo (1863-1868) had on the Diné, and subsequent federal mandates on Diné culture
that included the boarding school system of education and the failed sheep/land
policies—both of which may have provided impetus for consideration of the new
religion. Methodology include archival research at the National Bahá’í Archives in
Wilmette, Illinois, and ethnographic fieldwork on the Navajo Reservation from 2007-
2009\.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank the following people for their support during the course of my
graduate studies. First and foremost, thank you to my thesis committee for their patience
and guidance, especially to Martha Finch as my Chair. Deepest gratitude goes to the
Kahn families for allowing me to interview them, providing hospitality, and arranging
other interviews, and to Johnny and Rubie Nelson and Jacky Wilson for sharing their
time and thoughts. Gratitude goes to the staff at the Native American Bahá’í Institute
who shared their community potlucks with us and allowed interviews on campus. A
special thank you to Linda Wilson for her insights on Diné traditions and history and for
her interview so soon after her mother’s passing. In particular, gratitude goes to Ronald
P. Maldonado, supervisory archeologist for Cultural Compliance in the Historic
Preservation Department of the Navajo Nation, for his kind permission for the Diné
interviews to be conducted on the Navajo Reservation, and to John Schmalzbauer, thesis
committee member, for his much-needed help with IRB human research forms and
requirements. Appreciation goes to Bill and Mary Lou Wright for their astonishingly
detailed and fun interviews and to Bruce and Sandy Palmberg for starting this process in
the first place many years ago. Special thanks to Nancy F. Browning, Professor of
Cultural Diversity at Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri, for her reading of
Chapter 1; to psychologist Theo A Cope, Lecturer and Foreign Faculty Coordinator,
School of International Business, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, Dalian,

Normal University-Missouri State University School of International Business, Liaoning
Province, Dalian, China, for their listening and support. My deepest gratitude to Joyce
Olinga for transcribing interviews, to Roger Dahl and staff at the National Bahá’í
Archives office for help with research, to dear friend Marjean Streitmatter who constantly
kept me on guard against procrastination, and to my four adult children who supported
“Mom doing her thing.” Gratitude goes to Susan Berry Brill de Ramírez, Caterpillar Inc.
Professor of English at Bradley University, Peoria, Illinois, who teaches Native American
literatures, ecocomposition, folklore, and literary criticism and theory. This thesis would
be remiss without Susan’s extensive insight into the Bahá’í Faith, Native American oral
traditions, the spoken word as an instrument of change, and the ability to combine her
knowledge into “conversive communication.” I am indebted to John Pappan, Omaha
Indian Bahá’í, for his inadvertent email introduction of scholars and Bahá’ís Donald
Addison and Christopher Buck, who has written profoundly on Native Messengers,
myths, and religions; and to fellow traveler Chelsea Horton, Ph.D. Candidate in the
Department of History, University of British Columbia, for her invaluable help with
research issues, friendship, and encouragement. I am deeply indebted to Barbara Brown,
editor of Naturegraph Publishing, who provided details for Chapter 5 and for her
permission to use Annie Kahn’s “Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants” in this thesis.

PREFACE AND DEDICATION

Growing up I felt some justifiable pride (or so I thought) to have been born along
the Pecos River, renowned in cowboy novels and western legends, in the high-desert
village of Fort Sumner, New Mexico. I had become accustomed to the rocky, scrub brush
hills in the Ozark region of Missouri where my mother had been sent as a missionary
when I was three years old. When I periodically returned to visit New Mexico as a child,
the vastness of the blue skies encircling Fort Sumner like an upside-down bowl, with an
occasional glimpse of mysterious, flat-topped red mesas, never ceased to hold my
attention and amaze me. We traveled back and forth from Missouri to New Mexico
enough to know that New Mexico was really my home. I spent much of my early
childhood traveling with my maternal grandmother, who was partially blind.
Grandmother Snead’s most frequent circuit was between her youngest son, who lived in
the remotest regions of Texas and New Mexico, ranching and raising horses, and her
oldest daughter, who lived in Fort Sumner. Aunt Irene lived in a small white adobe house
on a rise coming out of “the valley,” three miles or so from the old fort area named
Bosque Redondo or Hwééldi, “the place of suffering,” by the Diné, or Navajo Indians,
who had been held at the fort between 1863 and 1868.

Parts of the old fort were partially outlined with low-lying and crumbling rocky
foundations as the only sign that buildings once occupied the land. To the side of the old
fort area was (and still is) the Billy the Kid Museum and Visitors’ Center—Fort Sumner’s
major claim to fame and tourist attraction. The poignant and painful history of the old fort
was seldom acknowledged by local residents or tourists; it was Billy the Kid that visitors
from out of town came to see and it was one of the few places where we kids could wile

away a boring Sunday afternoon. Over the years it became a family ritual to visit the Kid
museum and gift shop. I often found myself wandering out over the grounds of the old
fort, sitting on an accessible part of the crumbling foundations, and carrying on deep
questioning conversations with myself about the Indians who had been imprisoned and
had died there in large numbers. I often wondered if I would meet any of the descendents
of those people who had eked out a less than marginal existence at the old fort before
being allowed to return to their homelands. My Pecos River of childhood memories and
stories meandered just a hundred yards or so from the old foundations, lined with small
trees and tall grasses so that it was inaccessible to exploration. Besides, I’d had my fill of
red ants, scorpions, and monster tarantulas as a child playing in the red-sand yard of my
auntie’s home. Gracing a few yards along the way back to her house were the last of the
distinctively large and nearly extinct cottonwood trees that had been planted by the
Navajo and Mescalero Apache prisoners.1

Years flew by, filled with schooling, family, and other trips. I investigated various
religions along the way, choosing to “become” a Bahá’í in February, 1970. In the
early1980s, I became active in my own American Indian heritage. Customarily, in the
native way, one introduces oneself by where one’s family comes from. My mother’s
father’s family originated from Cherokee, Alabama, where my mother’s paternal
grandfather had come from the Old Country to take a Cherokee bride by the name of
Wind, anglicized to Wynn, and kept as a rather hushed family secret until years after my
grandfather’s passing. My mother’s father, Oscar Snead, in an arranged marriage into a
fairly well-to-do and well-known white woman’s family in New Mexico, did not openly

acknowledge his Cherokee heritage. My paternal Cherokee grandmother, Cora Merrimen,
was born in Texas and moved to Oklahoma after her marriage to my grandfather, Uel
Edwards. Grandmother was proud of her Indian heritage and often spoke of her own
mother, Dottie Wilson-Merriman, who was given land in Texas by a river, which,
according to family stories, later turned out to be downtown Dallas. Grandfather
Edwards, known as a kind and patient man, born in Carney and raised near Sayer,
Oklahoma, mere miles from the infamous Black Kettle massacre site, was of Southern
Cheyenne heritage, although, according to my elderly aunties, he didn’t talk about it.

My teenage parents met in Fort Sumner when my father and his parents followed
the ripening crops from Oklahoma down into Texas and New Mexico as migrant workers
in the cotton and peanut fields. They quickly eloped, much to my maternal Cherokee
grandfather’s intense dismay, and the ensuing extended family battles on both sides, of
disapproval and angst over Indian identities or lack thereof, ended the stress-filled
marriage in divorce after only seven years. My two older brothers and I grew up with
tales of our paternal Cherokee grandmother, her native remedies, and her hot Cherokee
temper, which was not to be outdone by our maternal grandfather’s equally hot Cherokee
temper. The families split apart and we children lost access to our father and his family
until well into our adulthoods. By then it was too late. Father and grandparents had
passed away, leaving only two aunties to fill in the blanks of lost family.

As a partial result of my childhood losses over “the Indian question,” I co-
founded the Heart of America Spiritual Gatherings in 1996, held at a Bahá’í-owned
retreat named Temerity Woods, which brought together natives and non-natives in a

place of safety and respect.2 Bruce and Sandy Palmberg, proprietors, had spoken often of
living for a few years on the Navajo reservation and I knew that one of their goals for
Temerity Woods was to establish a native-based event there. During a trip in the summer
of 1996 to the Navajo reservation in Arizona with a vanload of goods for the Black Mesa
area, besieged by the Hopi-Navajo relocation dispute, I made my first visit to the Native
American Bahá’í Institute near Pine Springs and briefly met Alfred and Tina Kahn, long-
time friends of the Palmbergs.3 The Kahns came to the spiritual gathering at Temerity a
year later with their daughter, Seowah. I knew that Alfred was a full-blood Navajo but I
did not connect him personally back to those prisoners at the old fort then or during any
of the spiritual gatherings that the Kahns attended over the next four years.

It was Thanksgiving of 2003 when I discovered something wonderful had
happened in the old fort area. I had been back to my aunt’s home and to Billy the Kid’s
museum a good number of times over the years but had neglected to venture over to the
now-invisible remains of the old fort some distance away to the side of the museum. This
visit was different. I had been given a task by my own native Elders to look for a certain
small stone along the banks of the Pecos. Sneaking away from the family gathering in my
cousin’s new modular home, placed near the site of my deceased aunt’s crumbling adobe
house, I made my way down the valley to the old fort area. As I approached the museum
something caught my attention about a small adobe building that I had not noticed on
previous visits. Curiosity piqued, I turned down a narrow dirt road to discover an

unassuming Interpretive Center, constructed in 1970 and built in the style of the old fort.4

“Finally,” I thought, “I’ll find out more about these people.” It was near closing time and
sunset in the chilly November evening, but the native ranger on duty allowed me enough
time for a brief glance at the disappointing military-focused exhibits and to take the long-
anticipated walk down a narrow sandy path by the Pecos. The walk produced a gratifying
experience that more than made up for the lack of information in the exhibits. Coming
back full circle on the trail to the Interpretive Center I came upon a small rock cairn about
three feet high built under a juniper tree. The bronze plaque positioned near the front of
the cairn gave more information about the old fort and what had happened there than had
all the exhibits in the Center put together. The cairn had been blessed with red prayer ties
and other small personal items carefully placed on its stones by its visitors. I offered the
“Blessed is the Spot” prayer from the Bahá’í writings and laid my own prayer tie on the
cairn.5 Finally, at long last, what had transpired at the old fort area so many years ago was
in plain sight for all to see. Descendents of “those people” had been there—and they
would be back. Still, I was not prepared at all for what came next.

Over the years the Kahns and I had become close, with Tina, of Cherokee/Osage
heritage, as my sister and Alfred as my brother in the native ways of family. In July of
2005, they invited me to the traditional blessing ceremony for their son’s wedding and to
the Kahn extended family reunion. This was my opportunity to visit Fort Sumner again. I
knew there had been a new and much larger interpretive center built and dedicated earlier
that summer and I was eager to see it. Arriving again just at closing time, I could see a

led by a Diné singer.

tall conical-shaped building behind the Kid museum that dwarfed and overshadowed the
museum with its uniqueness.6 In front of the building lay the long trunk of an old
cottonwood tree. Circling to one side of the interpretive center was a partially finished
arbor area similar to the arena of the spiritual gatherings’ ceremonial grounds at Temerity
Woods. I entered through tall glass doors to catch in one sweeping glance all the history
that had been missing in the little adobe center in 2003. The significance of the new
center and the impact of actually standing in such a beautiful building within sight of the
old Kid museum with the smaller interpretive center behind it seemed surreal.

When I arrived at the Kahns’ a few days later, I shared with them my emotional
experience at the new interpretive center. Alfred and Tina had attended the grand opening
on June 4, 2005, and as Alfred shared his story I learned that he is a relative, a descendent
of Navajo Chief Manuelito—the same Chief Manuelito whose picture is painted on the
outside wall of the Kid museum and whose face I had gazed at countless times since
childhood. Later, Alfred’s older brother Chester Kahn shared his knowledge of Chief
Manuelito:

years they were starving. Many of them starved. Many of them died over there. Of
course many of them got killed, too, in the process.7

Looking at Alfred’s chiseled Navajo face, I could easily see the family resemblance to
Chief Manuelito. The astonishing answer to a lifetime of questioning, “who are these
people, and will I ever meet any of their descendents,” stood in front of me!

Traditional Navajo singers created the rock cairn on the winding trail near the
Pecos River in 1971 through a Diné Blessing Way Ceremony. Nineteen years later a park
ranger found a note pinned under a rock on the cairn, handwritten on lined paper torn
from a student’s notebook and addressed to the staff of the old interpretive center:

The note was signed by twenty youth—Herbert Yazzie; Kenny Begay; Rocky Tso;
Tommy Bitsui; Fabian Kee; Mat Fry; Jeannie Y. Benally; Wendy C. Begay; Darlene
Smith; Sherretta Martinez; Jason Songster; Leonard F.; Marlon Yazzie; Cassandra Ben;
Sonja Bahe; Laura Becenti; Petula Shirley; Pauline M. Begay; Evelyn Becenti; and Kidd
Louis—of the Navajo Nation who had lost twenty percent of their ancestors over a
hundred years ago, before and during their ancestors’ Long Walk to imprisonment at Fort
Sumner. This thesis is dedicated to them.

INTRODUCTION: SETTING THE STAGE

A major religious change, a becoming, or a form of tradition transition occurred
among some Navajos, or more accurately, Diné, in 1962, when members of a large and
well-known Diné family, the Kahns, organized the Great Council Fire Unity Conference
held near the Pine Springs Chapter House on the Navajo reservation in Arizona. (I use
Diné out of respect for those scholars and those Navajos who have moved from the
Spanish term of Navajo, but I also maintain Navajo in some contexts out of respect for
the many Navajos who continue to identify themselves as such). Psychologist and
theologian Lewis Rambo explains that a tradition transition takes place when an
individual or a group of individuals converts “from one major religious tradition to
another” and says that if scholars are to be “phenomenologically true to the experiences
and the phenomena of conversion, we must: 1) examine the religious ideology that shapes
the conversion process, 2) examine the religious imagery that influences the
consciousness of the convert, and 3) examine the religious institutions that are the matrix
in which conversion takes place.”9 Rambo defines religious conversion as a “turning
from and to new religious groups, ways of life, and systems of belief and modes of
relating to a deity or the nature of reality.”10 While using Rambo’s religious conversion
model to explore the Diné conversion experience, I use the term “becoming Bahá’í” to
more fully describe the religious change that occurred among some Diné in 1962. My
continued usage of Rambo’s term “tradition transition” is a reminder that those Diné who
became Bahá’í did convert to a major form of religion completely outside their own

traditions, while at the same time maintaining their own belief structure as Dinés. The
term “becoming Bahá’í,” which is the term Dine Bahá’ís themselves use, denotes the
long process of transition into the new religion and will be explained more fully in the
following chapters.

The Kahn family accepted the Bahá’í Faith en masse, with grandparents, parents,
and adult children all coming into the new religion within a relatively short period of time
in 1961-62. During the Great Council Fire Unity Conference held in June 1962 and
attended by more than a thousand people from various reservations, states, and countries
(see Appendix C), over three hundred Diné Indians publicly declared their belief in and
acceptance of the Bahá’í laws and principles revealed between 1844 and 1892 by the two
prophet-founders of the Faith, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh.11

My thesis presents a case study of the reasons why those three hundred Diné
voluntarily embraced this little-known religion that originated in the East in 1962 and
why some Diné continue to do so. As documented in multiple ethnographical studies,
most American Indians remain traditional to their cultural belief systems and do not
readily convert to an outside religious system without some form of coercion. According
to Scott Anderson, coercion has historically been used as a certain kind of power for the
purpose of gaining advantages over others in some way, whether to bend an individual or
a group of people into conformity, or to punish non-compliance with demands for some
change in behavior or actions.12 Anderson explains that imposing of either an individual’s

will or the will of a group of individuals upon the will of other people limits the imposed-
upon group to coercive “free” choices or coercive “unfreely” choices:13

> used to refer to an inner state of orderly self-directedness. Coercion has been
> thought to be inimical to at least some of these types of freedom, perhaps all, and
> also to have deleterious impacts on the special type we call autonomy.14

The Diné experienced coercion, along with a loss of autonomy, when they were
imprisoned in Bosque Redondo and when their children were, sometimes voluntarily and
often involuntarily, placed by the federal government in boarding schools that were run
by Christian churches. Milder forms of coercion among the Diné occurred when
missionaries held out gifts based on a change in actions or behavior, such as attending
church services to receive candy for children or new clothing for adults. Historian of
North American religions Catherine L. Albanese uses the more demure term
“constrained” to mean the same thing as coercion when she argues that “Indians were
constrained by circumstances to convert to Christianity, but they did so on their own
terms and for their own needs.”15 Albanese cites ethnohistorian James Axtell: “By
accepting the Christian minister or priest as the functional equivalent of a native shaman
and by giving traditional meanings to Christian rites, dogmas, and deities, the Indians
ensured the survival of native cultures by taking on the protective coloration of the

invaders’ religion.”16 While this was often true regarding natives’ conversion to
Christianity, my ethnographic research does not show any identifiable forms of coercion
as a reason for Diné to become Bahá’í.

Rather, I argue that, based on aspects of Rambo’s model of conversion and on the
emerging model of “becoming” to describe the Bahá’í conversion experience, some Diné
“became Bahá’í” for three primary reasons. Based in part on Rambo’s model of
conversion and his terminology, the following elements played into Diné becoming
Bahá’ís: the belief that the arrival of the Bahá’í Faith to the Navajo reservation fulfilled
Diné eschatological prophecies (religious imagery); access to autonomy and
empowerment individually and culturally (religious ideology); and, through the Bahá’í
concept of the protection of culture through the Bahá’í principle of unity in diversity,
Diné Bahá’ís maintain most of their traditional ways without opposition or disapproval
from the non-Indian Bahá’í community (religious matrix). Diné Bahá’ís believe that their
ancient prophecies contained in the “Return of the Warriors Twins” and in some ancient
Navajo chants (see Appendix B) were fulfilled by the coming of the new religion to them.
I argue that these important oral traditions shaped the Diné’s eschatological expectations
and provided a bridge for those Diné who became Bahá’í. I use Rambo’s three levels of
examination to categorize and describe his seven dimensions of religious conversion
among Diné Bahá’ís, which he identifies as context, crisis, quest, encounter, interaction,
commitment, and consequences. In addition, interviews in which several Diné Bahá’ís
narrate their conversion experiences add a rich depth to the telling of their stories in this
work.

Diné medicine men Jacky Wilson and Johnny Nelson and Johnny’s wife Rubie
Nelson were among those who became Bahá’ís at the Great Council Fire Unity
Conference (see Appendix E-4 and 5). Interviewed in the Nelsons’ prayer hogan in June
of 2009, Johnny speaks for the three elders when he tells what it was like to be at such a
momentous event in the tiny settlement of Pine Springs in 1962:

That’s how we became a Bahá’í.17

Johnny’s comments about “what they were waiting for” and the “message of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh” refer to their recognition and acceptance of the eschatological narrative of
the return of the Warriors Twins as being fulfilled in the forms of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh and support my argument that this narrative served as a bridge for becoming
Bahá’í. Johnny’s declaration that he and other Diné could continue to use their corn
pollen with their prayers validates my argument that through the Bahá’í concept of the
protection of cultural diversity, Diné Bahá’ís can maintain their traditional ways without

opposition or disapproval from the non-Indian Bahá’í community. Other traditional
activities evidenced at the Great Council Fire included the ceremonial making of a Diné
sacred corn cake prepared by Diné women who wrapped it in corn husks and placed the
cake in a pit of hot stones in the earth to bake overnight (see Appendix C-12, 13, and 14).
The ceremonial cake was served at noon the next day with mutton stew and fry bread to
the Dinés’ thousand-plus guests (see Appendix C-15 and 16).18

reservation in the mid-1950s by non-native Bahá’ís known as “home-front pioneers.”19
Acknowledged in the Britannica Book of the Year, 1988, as the latest in a series of
progressive world religions, which is devoid of clergy and based on the grassroots
initiative of its members, the Faith’s cornerstone principle of the oneness of God,
religions, and races calls for the practice of “unity in diversity” between individuals and
nations, which inculcates respect for and the protection of diverse cultures while working
toward the goal of a unified and peaceful new social order.20 Diné Bahá’í Linda Wilson
(see Appendix E-6) became a Bahá’í in 1970 while working for the federal government
in Washington, D.C. Linda expressed her idea of “unity in diversity” as her first sense of
connectedness between Diné and the Bahá’í tenets:

> We’re connected. Chief Joseph said that, “We’re all connected. If you remove one

got into this being, it became. And this was the teaching of our people [Diné]
> also.21

Linda Wilson’s sense of connectedness between Diné and Bahá’í teachings can be
found in the Diné oral story of the Warrior Twins and in the Diné prophecies contained
within ancient Navajo chants. First published in 1963 as the “Interpretation of Ancient
Navajo Chants,” Vinson Brown notes that Diné Bahá’í Annie Kahn “learned these
wonderful chants from her grandfather and the old medicine men of the tribe. No one
knows exactly how old these chants are, but it is certain that most of them appeared
before the coming of the white man.”22 Annie translated the chants from the oral Navajo
to English, added her interpretation to the end of each chant in light of her acceptance of
the Bahá’í Faith, and wrote them down for the first time.23 Using Rambo’s three levels of
conversion analysis, I examine both oral traditions from a religious, psychological,
anthropological, and sociological standpoint to understand how Diné connect those
stories to their new religion.

How cultures and their stories are interpreted may be influenced by the emic or
etic position of the researcher. Historian of religions Catherine Bell defines etic as a
scholar being on the outside of a culture he or she is studying.24 Emic, or inside a culture,
refers to the understandings and categories of a religious tradition that the scholars
themselves are a part of. Bell notes that etic scholars might inappropriately impose
interpretive categories on a religion by, for example, labeling prophecies as myths. My

point here is that an etic scholar might label the Diné eschatological narratives as myths,
while an emic scholar might label them differently. Historian of religions Bruce Lincoln
designates myths as a “small class of stories that possess both credibility and authority”
for the culture in which those stories arose.25 Lincoln defines as authoritative a narrative
for which successful claims are made not only to the status of truth but to the status of
paradigmatic truth.26 This sense of authority in myths is “akin to charters, models,
templates, and blueprints, but one can go beyond this formation and recognize that it is
also—and perhaps more importantly—akin to that of revolutionary slogans and ancestral
invocations, in that through the recitation of myth one may effectively mobilize a social
grouping.”27 The first Diné Bahá’ís effectively mobilized a social grouping through the
Great Council Fire Unity Conference, and through the recitation of the Diné mythical
stories of the Warrior Twins and the Navajo chants important forms of credibility and
authority were provided for those Diné as traditional charters, models, and blueprints that
directly or indirectly led to their becoming Bahá’í. Drawing on interviews and archival
evidence, I demonstrate that Diné Bahá’ís credit the prophecies contained in their ancient
oral stories as significant reasons for becoming Bahá’ís.

Secondly, I argue that the administrative structure of their new religion empowers
Diné Bahá’ís individually and as a people. I utilize historical accounts of government
policies and research in the literature to build a history of the oppressive and abusive

practices that potentially set the stage for Diné conversions to the Bahá’í Faith. The
Diné’s loss of sacred homeland and the severe deprivations they suffered during their
enforced Long Walk and imprisonment at Fort Sumner, New Mexico, between 1863 and
1868 and the disapproval or suppression of their traditional ceremonies by the dominant
culture surrounding them upon their return to Dinétah stayed strong in Diné cultural
memory and influenced their willingness to consider what the religious matrix of the
Bahá’í Faith had to offer them.28 The impact of the federal government’s overseer role in
the Diné economy, including the well-intended but failed sheep policy, weakened the
culture instead of strengthening it.29 A search of the literature reveals that the
government’s disastrous assimilation and education of Diné children in faraway boarding
schools created a deep scar in the Diné collective psyche that remains generational.30

Third, I argue that because the Bahá’í administrative structure and the Bahá’í
teachings did not mandate that Diné Bahá’ís had to give up their traditional beliefs in
order to become Bahá’í, Dinés were more open to conversion. I document this argument
through interviews with Diné Bahá’ís and by an examination of activities at the Native
American Bahá’í Institute on the Navajo reservation. Research at the National Archives
Office of the Bahá’ís of the United States in Wilmette, Illinois, shows that Bahá’í home-
front pioneers began to arrive on the Navajo reservation by the late 1950s. A rich source
of newsletters, pamphlets, personal letters, and flyers amply identify what kinds of
meetings were held, whether devotional, instructive, or organizational, along with how
many Diné attended and who they were. Included in the archival material are informal

listings of who converted to the new religion along with photographs of early Diné
Bahá’ís. By 1957 a Bahá’í Center was established in Gallup, New Mexico, while other
arriving home-front pioneers scattered out across the Navajo reservation. The Navajo
Bahá’í Institute was established by 1977 on the reservation as a meeting place to educate
Navajo Bahá’ís on their new religion and to “foster their Bahá’í identity.”31 Open to all
people and with the intention to serve many tribes, the Institute’s name was later changed
to the more-inclusive Native American Bahá’í Institute (NABI).

While I argue that Diné Bahá’ís experienced some aspects of what Rambo calls a
tradition transition when they became Bahá’ís and that important aspects of Rambo’s
model of conversion best fits the Diné becoming Bahá’í, as opposed to other theories
such as Catherine L. Albanese’s “combinative religions” model, the assumption should
not be made that the Diné abandoned their traditional belief system when they accepted
the tenets of the Bahá’í Faith or that by being both traditional Diné and Bahá’í, some
form of a Diné/Bahá’í religious hybridity took place.32 Rather, Diné Bahá’ís saw the new
teachings as renewing and re-energizing their ancient traditions, infusing new life, new
meaning, and new spirit into them instead of eliminating them or changing them. The
term convert becomes a stumbling block to the study of either tradition transition or
becoming Bahá’í because conversion historically implies the giving up of one set of
beliefs for another. This implication does not hold true in the case of a conversion from
any other major religion to the Bahá’í Faith because Bahá’ís do not reject their parent-
faith or its founder when “becoming Bahá’í” or “being Bahá’í.”33

As an example, Christians, when “becoming Bahá’í” do not reject the teachings of
Christ as the founder of Christianity; neither does “becoming” admit to a combinative
effect of Christianity with the Bahá’í Faith. Christianity is one great religious system that
divided over the centuries into the two major divisions of Catholicism and Protestantism,
with Protestantism in particular further dividing into many different sects and
denominations.34 Catholicism further divided into the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox,
and Oriental Orthodox churches, as well. Accordingly, individual sects and
denominations in either division of Catholicism or Protestantism would not be considered
new religions apart from their parent-system of Christianity simply because they
modified or changed over time due to contact with an otherness that Albanese defines as
combinative religions.35 Rather, Rambo’s second category of “religious intensification”
or his fourth category of “institutional transition or movement from one faith community
to another within a major religious tradition” may certainly describe Albanese’s
combinative, hybrid religious movements within one dominant system.36 Albanese’s
combinative religious model is examined more closely in chapter 7 on the science of
religious conversion, and the section on progressive revelation in chapter two explains
more thoroughly the Bahá’í concept of the separation of religious identities as a Bahá’í in
the act of “becoming,” while yet maintaining or acquiring individual Bahá’í belief in the
foundational elements of other religious systems.

I limit this work to those specific Bahá’í principles that more closely fit and
explain the Diné becoming Bahá’í conversion experience. My goal as an emic scholar,

being both a Bahá’í and of native heritage, albeit not Navajo, is to remain objective while
at the same infusing the Diné sense of the mystery, the sacred, and the mystical into the
telling of the story. History begins with the telling of the story—for if there were no
story, there would be no children of Changing Woman—no Diné, as my friend and
Navajo/Apache medicine man from Dziłijiin (Black Mesa) Tom Bedonie Kascoli often
reminds me when he corrects my pronunciation of “the people.”37 Also, the flowing tone
and structure of Diné interviewees’ quotes are not changed grammatically but rather are
kept as an important part of their personal stories. Older Diné believed stories could not
be retold properly if written down because “words on a page were silent and unalive.”38
The flow and tone inherent in Diné speech help to keep this story about transition and
transformation alive.

The historical background of the Diné’s environment and how they were
governed by the dominant culture are important to an examination of possible reasons for
conversion. The traditional belief system of the Diné cannot be explained without some
understanding of their physical environment, sacred to them, within an area guarded by
four sacred mountains. Of particular importance is the history of the Diné sheep-based
and land-based economy, along with the impact of the federal government’s early
overseer role that tended to decimate the culture instead of protecting it. The well-
intended but failed sheep policies led to depletion of Diné grazing lands and created a
long-lasting economic hardship on the Diné. Another important part of Diné history is the
boarding school policy enacted by the federal government and implemented by the

churches. This policy, often forcibly, took young children far away from their homes and
their culture.

Each of these historical events will be briefly examined in chapter 1 as possible
impetuses to Diné becoming Bahá’ís, and sets the stage in which to place Diné Bahá’í
conversion. Chapter 2 gives a brief introduction to the Bahá’í Faith, its history, and its
founding principles that best relate to Diné becoming Bahá’í and sets the stage in which
to place Diné Bahá’í conversion experiences. Chapter 3 introduces the eschatological
narrative of the Warrior Twins and their mother, Changing Woman, and sets the narrative
within the Bahá’í principles of the education of daughters and the concept of progressive
revelation as “return.” Chapter 4 provides background history on the Bahá’í promise or
prophecy to the Indian peoples, documents the arrival of Bahá’ís on the Navajo
Reservation, and reviews early Bahá’í/Indian-teaching material. Chapter 5 introduces the
second eschatological narrative of the ancient Navajo chants, along with two major signs
that the chants instruct Diné to look for in a new prophet or divine messenger.39 Both
signs, one of the nine-pointed star and the other of a chief with twelve feathers who
comes from the east, Diné Bahá’ís believe are fulfilled within the symbolism and
teachings of the Bahá’í Faith.

simply included this chant in with other native prophecies. For examples see:

Chapter 6 examines the Bahá’í administrative structure (Rambo’s religious
matrix) in which Diné Bahá’ís found autonomy, empowerment, and religious self-
governance and describes how the Native American Bahá’í Institute (NABI) came about,
including the building of a traditional prayer hogan on its campus grounds (see Appendix
D). The building of a traditional prayer hogan within the religious matrix of NABI lends
weight to my argument that Diné Bahá’ís can freely keep and practice their traditional
customs while being Bahá’í. Of note is that the use of peyote or any other hallucinogenic
drug is strictly forbidden in the Bahá’í tenets and Diné Bahá’ís are expected to refrain
from the use of peyote. Bahá’ís are exhorted to “consort with the followers of all
religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship”; however, Bahá’ís do not join or enroll
as members in other churches or religions once they have “declared” themselves to be
Bahá’í. 40 Peyote, used by those Diné who are members of the Native American Church,
is more fully discussed in chapter 7.

Chapter 7 examines conversion theories, most notably Albanese’s and Rambo’s,
from a psychological point of view, along with how conversion has historically been
defined or described by psychology and introduces the beginnings of a new theory for
becoming Bahá’í. I also examine the Bahá’í principle that science and religion must agree
in the context of Diné Bahá’í belief as a form of rational thought, in which the two
eschatological narratives found completion for Diné adherents. Chapter 8 describes the
two eschatological narratives as sacred symbols within the Diné concept of sacred sound
as sacred language and gives the Bahá’í explanation of the importance of language as a

\[40\] Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, trans. Shoghi Effendi (Wilmette, IL: Bahá’í
source for transformation. Chapter 9 provides closure with my final argument that some
Dinés became Bahá’í because of their belief that two of their important eschatological
prophecies were fulfilled by the coming of the Bahá’í Faith to them, both on and off the
Navajo reservation, and that components of the Faith’s principles fulfilled such needs for
Diné Bahá’ís as autonomy, empowerment, and personal growth both individually and
socially, and as a renewal in spirit of their sacred traditions, while, at the same time,
bringing Diné Bahá’ís more fully into the wider, more inclusive circle of humanity on an
international scale.

CHAPTER ONE
BETWEEN THE FOUR SACRED MOUNTAINS

In order to understand Diné mythology or ideology, some understanding is needed
of the all-important land space that gave birth to Diné culture. Within this space between
the four sacred mountains, the Diné creation story takes place, in which the creation story
or eschatological narrative of the Warrior Twins arose. Multiple centuries and
generations later, loss of land, loss of self-governance, imprisonment, and ongoing
attempts at assimilation into the conquering culture of the colonial period also arose
within the Diné’s land. Looking at these events in light of the later tradition transition of
Diné Bahá’ís clarifies another important component of how and why some Dinés chose
to enter the Bahá’í Faith. The story begins with a description of sacred land, sacred
mountains.

The Navajo Nation occupies the largest land area among Native American
reservations in the United States. The Four Corners area of the reservation straddles the
intersection of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. Stretching outward in all
directions from Four Corners and with approximately 290,000 residents, the reservation
occupies some 27,000 square miles although—like its people—it extends well beyond
those identifiable boundaries.41 Historian Peter Iverson succinctly sums up Diné history
as “long and complicated.”42 Iverson, a former educator at Navajo Community College,
brings together a comprehensive history of the Diné, from their “emergence upon the

\[41\] “NABI,” 30; History, Official Site of the Navajo Nation, http://www.navajo.org/history.htm (accessed

land” through to the twenty-first century, while “telling the story from the inside out
rather than from the outside in.”43

Iverson’s thorough sections include the Diné’s Long Walk to imprisonment at the
Bosque Redondo reservation (Fort Sumner, New Mexico) in 1863, and their return from
exile to their beloved sacred mountains in 1868. Iverson begins his book Diné with a
concise explanation of the origins of Áłltsé Hastiin (First Man) and Áłltsé Asdazáá (First
Woman) in the First or Black World, which contained quarreling Insect Beings, through
their difficult but progressive journey in the Second World (the Blue World where Blue
Birds of various kinds dwelled with Insect Beings and different animals), before
quarreling forced them to enter the Third World (the Yellow World characterized by
deceit and a global flood), and ends when everyone is swept away by a global flood to the
Fourth or Glittering World surrounded by four mountains.44 Intriguingly, when Linda
Wilson was investigating the Bahá’í Faith, she showed a picture of ʻAbdu’l-Bahá, son of
the founder of the new religion, to her father, who connected ʻAbdu’l-Bahá to the original
twelve Diyin Dine’ē (Holy People) of Diné origin from the four worlds:

> I said to my father, I showed him the picture of ʻAbdu’l-Bahá, “Have you seen
> this man ever?”And they talked about it. And, any of the talks they used to have
> during the wintertime, because all the talks, you talk about religion, deep into the
> translation of mind. We have certain ways. Who was born? Why was I born?
> What was said? Everything that was told to us. I said, “Was this man ever
> introduced?” and my father said, “Yes, he was one of the people like the Diyin
> Dine’ē. [He was] one of the major twelve people that was before the beginning of
> the world. This first world, second world, third world, they enter each world.
> We’re to the fifth world. It’s called the Glittering world.” My dad says, “Look
> around and look outside, you’re going look through the Glittering world, the
> glass, the different shining.” He says, “You’re going to see the different glitters.
> We’re in the fifth world.” He says, “We went through them all together. Their
> whole spiritual being is still with us.” He said that, “Yeah, we’re all walking the
> same path from the very beginning.” Then I knew the connection. I knew what the

\[44\] Ibid., Diné: A History of the Navajos, 8-11.

Bahá’í Faith is teaching. I knew what the Navajo teaching was. I know what the

> teaching the same teaching. So if the people have been taught like the way I was
> taught by my parents, the good way that everybody is. That everybody whose
> prayer that you say is to help them.45

Following her story of showing ʻAbdu’l-Bahá’s picture to her father, Linda
Wilson related that this second connection (Linda first connected Bahá’u’lláh’s exiles to
the Long Walk) of Diné to Bahá’í led her to become Bahá’í along with her parents and
other relatives who all then entered the new religion. The Glittering World, identified as
the fifth world of the Diyin Dine’ē, nestled in the sacred bosoms of Sis Naajini (Blanca
Peak to the east in Colorado), Toodiził (Mt. Taylor to the south in New Mexico),
Dook´o´oosłííd (San Francisco Peaks to the west in Arizona), and Dibé Nitsaa (Hesperus
Peak to the north in Colorado), gave birth to the Diné. The Diné consider Dinétah (the
original Navajo land between the four sacred mountains) as a vital member of their
collective social body, just as indispensible as Níłch´i, the “holy wind” or breath that gave
them life in the first place.46 Navajo Chief Barboncito told General Sherman in 1868,
“When the Navajos were first created, four mountains and four rivers were pointed out to
us, inside of which we should live, that was to be our country and was given to us by the
first woman of the Navajo tribe.”47 Professor of English Paul Zolbrod, in his poetic
translation of Diné bahanié: The Navajo Creation Story, writes that when traveling in his
car with his Diné passengers, in a rather gossipy and conversational fashion, they often
referenced their unquestioned belief in the sentient features of the four sacred mountains
and other landscape features: “If Navajos relate to their landscape in a special way it is

because one version or another of the creation cycle is immediate and familiar to them,
whether they are young or old, modern or traditional.”48

The Long Walk

The years between 1846, when the United States’ covetous eye laid claim to the
Navajo lands as its own, and 1868, when the Long Walk began out of Dinétah, were a
period of great agitation, turmoil, persecution, and warring for the Diné. By the 1840s the
federal government had adopted the idea of reservations. The federal attitude of control
and domination, incorporated into policy or treaties, entailed a forced migration of Indian
peoples all over the United States onto these remote and unknown lands considered
worthless by the federal government at the time. James Carleton, governor and
commander of New Mexico, reinforced and justified this action in Washington when he
declared,

> By the subjugation and colonization of the Navajo tribe we gain for civilization
> their whole country, which is much larger in extent than the state of Ohio, and
> besides being the best pastoral region between two oceans, is said to abound in
> the precious as well as the useful metals. . . . The exodus of this whole group of
> people from the land of their fathers is not only an interesting but a touching sight.
> . . . They have defended their mountains and their stupendous canyons with a
> heroism which any people would be proud to emulate . . . [knowing it is] their
> destiny to give way to the insatiable progress of our race.49

It was in the unsuitable bottomlands of the small and winding Rio Pecos River in
New Mexico—wrongly identified to be as fertile as the Missouri Bottoms—that Carleton
chose to create his forty-acre military fort, named after his former commanding officer,
Edward Vose Sumner, and centered in the million-acre reservation known as Bosque
Redondo or Hwééldi by the Diné, “the place of suffering.” Carleton expected that his

\[48\] Zolbrod, Diné bahané, 22-23.

\[49\] Iverson, Diné, 48-49.

vision for the new Navajo reservation would transform the Diné into readers and writers,
where they could learn “the art of peace” and “the truths of Christianity, [and] acquire
new habits, new values, and new modes of life.”50 Carleton’s goals for the Diné
coincided with the opinion of Commissioner of Indian Affairs, William P. Dole, whose
annual report of November 1861 recommended that the “savages” be removed
immediately. Removal to “suitable reservations” would protect the lives and goods of
white residents and provide a punishment to the Diné for the “barbarous atrocities they
are continually committing” in their “wild and predatory life.”51

The Long Walk, led by the notorious Indian fighter Kit Carson, encompassed
fifty-three different episodes of forced marches for thousands of Diné and hundreds of
Mescalero Apaches from August, 1863, through December, 1866, over four hundred
miles of torturous terrain in the ice and snow of winter and the intense heat of the dry
New Mexico summer.52 Beginning in 1863, Carson waged his own war against the Diné
when he marched through Dinétah destroying crops, livestock, and orchards. Diné stories
abound of the inhumane treatment from the military, both before and during the Long
Walk, of their starvation, freezing due to exposure without adequate clothing, rampant
illnesses, separation from family members, and a host of atrocities committed by the
military that included being shot on the spot for such infractions as delivering a baby on
the trail.53 Diné Bahá’í Chester Kahn remembers his great-grandmother’s story of her
Long Walk:

The story that Chester heard his great-grandmother tell at such a young age, and before
he was sent off to boarding school, surely made a deep and lasting impression upon him,
one that must have indelibly imprinted upon his mind a distrust of the culture he later
found himself unwillingly ensconced in at boarding schools. Chester, already in his late
sixties at the time of our interview, told his grandmother’s story with emotion and
indignation cracking in his voice:

> totally no freedom; [they] just didn’t do anything all day long except some were

asked to work for the soldiers. People died, and starvation, and from disease
> whatever. Finally, they were released and she walked back [to Dinétah] again.54

After the Diné’s removal, the military cut down over thirty-five hundred of their
peach trees in tseghi, Canyon de Chelly—the place-where-two-sides-of-the-canyon-fit-
together—and destroyed acres of their corn and bean crops in an attempt to erase the
Diné environment.55

When the Diné finally arrived at Fort Sumner, they found a low, flat, barren plain
with few trees for shelter or firewood for cooking. The brackish Pecos River was nearly
undrinkable. The military post, located miles from any source of material supplies and
lying in a low valley, regularly flooded with the spring rains and made the soil too
alkaline even for the accomplished Diné farmers—and there were no mountains, only
low, flat-topped mesas partially visible in the far distance.56 More than three thousand
Diné and over four hundred Mescalero Apaches died at Fort Sumner of starvation,
sweeping diseases, exposure to the elements, attacks from their Comanche enemies, and
even attacks from marauding wolves and other wild animals that invaded the fort.57 After
five long years of suffering, the historic Treaty between the United States of America and
the Navajo Nation, signed on June 1, 1868, was finally reached, which allowed the Diné
to return to their beloved mountains.58 Some seven thousand surviving Navajos retraced
their footsteps on the Long Walk with what little remained of their once-great herds of
sheep, goats, and horses.59

sheep, and 1,025 goats remained of the Navajo herds that had come to Bosque Redondo with the Diné out
of the quarter million sheep and 60,000 horses that the Diné once possessed.

Going home was, and continues to be, a defining moment in the collective
conscious of the Diné, celebrated in poems and songs: “It is said /When the Diné people
were released, /It was a great day. /The Diné saw and recognized the peak /Mount Taylor
and they wept. /I can hear the words of the ancient ones: /Be strong. It is said /Remember
the Diné way.”60 Iverson writes that revisionists’ accounts of Diné history have tended to
surface with the arrival of new Navajo historians who strive to soften the horror of what
actually happened or to vindicate those who carried it out, but a return to the primary
sources reaffirms already well-established conclusions. First, the non-Indians in the
Southwest did have reason for grievances against the Diné for their continual pattern of
raiding, even if not all the Diné participated in such ventures. Secondly, the Carson
campaign and the Long Walk to Fort Sumner inflicted enormous suffering and trauma on
the Diné. Third, the years spent by some Dinés at Hwééldi and the years spent by other
Dinés (those who had evaded capture) apart from Hwééldi had a powerful effect on their
collective identity and on the Diné’s future. Finally, the ability of the Diné leadership to
succeed in their negotiations with the American commissioners so that the Diné were
able to return to a portion of their homeland marked a major turning point in Diné
history.61

Federal Mandates: The Economics of Land and Sheep

The Diné had returned with few, if any, material goods, but with a profound sense
of their identity as Diné—the people who had fought for their mountains and won. One of
the first means of survival was to increase their livestock, especially their sheep. George

A. Boyce served as a teacher and school administrator on the Navajo reservation for over
thirty years in the first half of the 1900s. Boyce recorded what he observed when he
visited the district chapters and on-reservation boarding schools. His classic work, When
Navajos Had Too Many Sheep: In the 1940s, documents the Diné struggle to survive and
adapt after the Long Walk, when the federal government issued rations and sheep to the
returning Diné in an attempt to jump-start life again on the reservation.62 Sheep
proliferated over the following years when poor land management policies encouraged
Navajos to raise more sheep than their rangelands could possibly sustain. The solution, to
take their beloved sheep away from Navajo families, created a social, economic, and
cultural tragedy parallel in the Diné collective mind to the Long Walk.

Sheep had been a vital part of Diné life ever since the Spaniards introduced them
from Mexico in 1582, along with horses and goats.63 It was Spanish livestock,
specifically the Spanish churro (sheep) that became unique to Diné culture and caused a
revolution in their lifestyles every bit as much as the domestication of herd animals had
millennia earlier in ancient Mesopotamia.64 The “good life” of raising sheep and owning
large herds of horses had continued to prosper and grow uninterrupted for three centuries
until Kit Carson drove out the Diné in 1864. After the exiled Diné arrived back on their
now much smaller reservation, which the federal government had created out of their
original vast homelands, ironically the same military responsible for their removal
provided them with “seed stock” to start all over again. If the Diné’s population had

remained stable, the reservation would have been large enough to allow each family to
“earn a modest living” with a small flock of sheep and a few horses. What happened
instead was an influx of traders, missionaries, and government officials onto the
reservation, who encouraged the Navajo families to increase their flocks and, in addition,
the Diné’s population had increased from 10,000 in 1864 to 120,000 by1970.65 Philip
Reno was a “well-known Marxist humanist and pragmatic” economist who taught at
Navajo Community College for over twenty-two years.66 His work, still considered the
classic on Diné economics, provides a fascinating glimpse into how Diné spirituality and
economics interweave and act one upon the other. Raising sheep and weaving blankets
from wool had created a means of income among Diné women that provided for family
needs, supplied a surplus of blankets that could be traded to Spanish merchants for goods,
and in later years became an important source of artistic pride and identity.67 However,
the Diné, once the wealthiest of Indian tribes for its immense herds of horses, cattle, and
sheep, was described in the federally-mandated sweeping and scathing Meriam Report of
February 21, 1928, as “extremely poor.”68 The Brookings Institute, an independent
research organization based in Washington, D.C., undertook the national survey of the
“Indian situation” at the behest of the federal government, for the Secretary of the United
States Department of the Interior, and produced the Meriam Report.

By the late 1930s the sharp increase in population and livestock had decimated
the Navajo rangelands and its “scrawny sheep and starving horses” that were overgrazing
it. It was, as Reno noted, a sudden recognition of the looming economic and conservation

crises by government agronomists and soil conservationists that came too late.69 In 1933,
despite the “New Deal” from the federal government intended to improve the quality of
Diné life, livestock reduction was “forced upon the agonized and angry Navajo
stockmen” who realized that range improvement was needed but did not understand the
solutions proposed by the government.70 The solutions made no sense to the stockmen
and resulted in a “chaotic situation lasting for years” that affected all aspects of Diné life,
including education of children, boarding schools, hunger, progress, and change. Boyce
noted that “one complaint of the Diné stockmen in regard to sheep reduction was their
utter confusion; under the Republicans they were encouraged to increase stock and
penalized if they did not do so while under the Democrats they were penalized for
excesses; they expressed a sentiment that they were ‘inclined to mark time until after
election day in 1944.’”71

Social anthropologist Louise Lamphere wrote Weaving Women’s Lives about
Diné Eva Price’s multigenerational family. Lamphere puts a human face on the federal
Sheep Reduction Policy tragedy in “I Used To Herd Sheep All Around Here: Eva’s
Childhood, Sheep Herding, and the Trauma of Stock Reduction” that encapsulates the
role of sheep in Diné culture.72 Lamphere writes that “Navajo women are often associated
with their sheep through the notion of motherhood,” and they were still responsible up
through the period of the 1950s for the herding, birthing of lambs, and general care of the
flocks—Navajos say, “Those called the field are your mother, those called sheep are your

that Bahá’í home-front pioneers first arrived on the reservation in the late 1950s.

Boarding Schools. Boyce notes that the 1927 Meriam Report to the Secretary of
the United States Department of the Interior, revolutionary in its scope and
recommendations in regard to Indians on reservations, led “circuitously to events
affecting the Navajo in the decade of the 1940s.”74 Boyce writes that the strongest
criticism in the Meriam Report was levied against the quality and character of the Indian
boarding schools, which the U.S. government began establishing in 1879, as being
“grossly inadequate.” The diet was severely deficient, Indian children were below normal
health, dormitories were overcrowded, toilet facilities were not maintained or
conveniently located, soap and towels were in short supply, medical service was
superficial, and child labor supported the boarding schools. The Meriam Committee
wrote,

> Some years ago the Indian service adopted a uniform curriculum for all Indian
> schools. The uniform curriculum works badly because it does not permit of

Ending with its strongest statement, the Meriam Committee said that “the first and
foremost need in Indian education is an approach that is less concerned with a

conventional school system and more with the understanding of human beings; the
teacher must be free to gather material from the life of the local Indians about her or at
least within the scope of the child’s experience.”76 Boyce adds that

When a Navajo family “gave” a child to the government to go to boarding school,
the child was to attend school for one year, then return home to herd sheep and let a
brother or sister go the following year. Often, Boyce says, it was the unhealthy or
crippled child who was given to a school; thus, poverty dictated the economics of
schooling.78 Reservations were vast and the only means of some education was to send
children to boarding schools far away from their families for years at a time. Bruce and
Sandy Palmberg were Bahá’í home-front pioneers at Pine Springs from1969 to 1971. In
talking about how difficult it was to live on the reservation, Bruce cryptically
remembered with some humor a question he had asked: “I asked [a Navajo father] why
all the hogans had three driveways? Answer was, ‘One into the hogan, one out of the
hogan, and one when Mormon missionaries come to steal our children!’ They’d take
them to boarding schools or place them with a white family.” Sandy added, “The

boarding school in Pine Springs was run by a Baptist couple, the Stahls. She was a
teacher; he was an educational specialist, teacher, and minister at the same time.”79

Children often were forcibly removed by school personnel who came to pick them
up in school buses, but just as often were sent by their parents, who, bound by poverty,
thought that, at the very least, their children would be fed, clothed, and given good health
care. Besides, native parents recognized that their children needed to learn the language
of the whites as a matter of survival in their forever-changed world. However, there is no
excuse for the atrocities that occurred in boarding schools. Chester Kahn spoke softly
about his boarding school experience with an aura of emotional pain, practiced
detachment, briefly noticeable anger when his voice rose, and lots of paused “ahs”:

Chester’s nephew, Alfred Kahn, Jr., implies that he, too, lost access to some of his
traditional ways because of boarding schools: “I’m half Navajo. I was raised on the
reservation and I was raised with a lot of ceremonies, but I think a lot of the traditional
ways have been stripped away by materialism and problems with the boarding schools on

the reservation. So I lived half Navajo, half urban life.”81 Linda Wilson places the blame
on boarding schools for alcoholism and “wiping” traditional ways “off the children.”82 In
her interview, Wilson said her family had over a thousand sheep on the reservation after
they had reclaimed their land when they returned from imprisonment at Ft. Sumner:

> After the Long Walk, they came back and reclaimed their land and restored some
> of the traditional ceremony, traditional way of living back. They instilled that into

> life, the old ways. So they instilled that into all the children before the boarding
> school start[ed] taking over. So during our early age this is how we got introduced
> to life.

Wilson blames the boarding school system for many problems among the Diné and gives
credit to her parents for instilling traditional values into them in spite of the boarding
school experience. After the boarding schools opened, Wilson explains,

> It was a total, I guess, elimination of your tradition, totally integrating into the

Wilson first attended a Catholic boarding school and identified herself as a former
Catholic who had not left the Church prior to becoming a Bahá’í. She gave the credit for
her commitment to the Church to a Catholic priest who helped her older relatives
interpret the Bible from a Navajo point of view. Her parents’ instructions that academics

belonged to the boarding schools, but spiritual training belonged to her parents, obviously
created a lasting mindset in Wilson and her siblings, even though they attended different
churches over the years as children. Wilson said that in boarding school every other child
was told to take a number. According to Wilson, if a child’s number was one, that child
was a Catholic, number two was a Presbyterian, and so it went until number four, which
was the new church of choice being introduced on the reservation at the time. According
to the child’s number, that was the church he or she attended, Wilson said, but “a lot of
children were very traditional like us and they would say, and we would ask, ‘Do they
serve candy over there?’ ‘Yeh, well, we’ll go to that church then.’ And if they served
good stuff, we belong to that church!”84

Churches. The Catholic Church was the first point of contact between the Diné
and Christianity, first documented in 1626 and again in 1630, when Alonzo Benavides
sent his report to the King of Spain on “the providence of the Apaches of Navajo” who
are “very great farmers, for that is what Navajo signifies—great planted fields.”85 The
term Navajo may be derived from nava, Spanish for plain or field. The Catholic attempt
to Christianize the Diné in 1630 was unsuccessful, as were two more attempts in 1746
and 1749. Chester Kahn related that in boarding school he had to attend a church of his
choice so he chose the Catholic Church and became interested in the history behind it.
Chester’s mild voice rose in indignation as he spoke:

The Franciscans of Cincinnati, Ohio, accepted the challenge of Christianization in
1897, taking charge of the Catholic mission that became St. Michael’s industrial boarding
school. Later acknowledged as “one of the finest old-school scholars among students of
the Navaho,” Franciscan missionary Father Berard Haile arrived in 1900 to help build the
school: “For decades he traveled the barren reservation by buckboard and horseback,
preaching and studying and helping St. Michael's [Mission] build up a network of
schools, clinics and churches to care for some 11,500 baptized Catholics.”87 The 1910
Catholic Encyclopedia provided this description of Diné theology with a note on the lack
of their Protestant competitors’ success at the time:

By the time St. Michael’s Mission observed its fiftieth anniversary in October, 1949,
about half of the Navajo Nation’s 65,000 Diné belonged to Protestant denominations,
with about a third of its members still considered “pagan.”89

Boyce was quite brief and to the point in his assessment of the role of churches on
the Navajo reservation. He noted that problems involving missionary activities and who
was responsible for what between churches and the Indian Service necessitated their own
chapter in the Meriam Report. Boyce edited the Report with an astute observation at the
end of each point:

Both the Meriam Report and Boyce pulled no punches when they addressed the
problems of disunity and lack of cooperation with each other among the churches and
missionaries, and between the churches’ and the federal government’s attempts to reduce
conflict. Inherent in the conflict between denominations was an inability to agree on even
the “simple elements” of Christian life, which included schooling of Diné children. Even
more so than their parents, it was the Diné children who suffered the brunt of this
disunity. In the 1868 treaty, the federal government had provided for a teacher and
classroom for “every thirty children who could be induced or compelled to enroll,” while
abrogating its responsibility for implementation to the churches.91 A missionary for the
Presbyterian Church provided the first classroom in1869, but soon gave up, unable to
control “such unruly children.” Other teachers followed to no avail. Diné parents resisted
placing their children in boarding schools—they needed their help with the livestock, but
most of all they missed their children and feared that the institutions were a “death trap”
from which their children would not return.92

The Mormons arrived in the 1860s, followed by the Christian Reformed Church
in1912, the Episcopalians in1917, and the American Baptists in the1930s.93 The Navajo
Mission School was established at Farmington, Arizona, by the Church of Christ in 1947.
Missionaries at the school increasingly spent their energies and resources caring for up to
seventy “disaffected and abandoned” Diné children at a time, left at the mission by
families unable to care for them. As a result, the Church of Christ moved the Navajo

Mission School to Gallup, New Mexico, in the late 1950s, renaming it the Manuelito
Navajo Children’s Home and reorganizing it as a twenty-four-hour residential care
facility with a program for single mothers and a school with kindergarten through grade
twelve.94 In 1965, historian and native activist Vine Deloria documented twenty-six
different churches at Farmington serving a population of 250 Navajos. He cryptically
added that each denominational congregation had fewer than ten Indians per
denomination and estimated the total mission budget that year as exceeding $250,000:
“Christianity, not tourism, was Farmington’s most profitable industry in 1965.”95
It has long been my contention that American Indians, as a body of people, suffer from
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of five hundred years of invasion and
constant attempts at assimilation.96 Five hundred years is a mere blink of the eye in the
timeline of a people. Historical examples are replete that show whole societies of people
continue to struggle, resist, and suffer for centuries after conquest has come to an end.
PTSD manifests itself in American Indian culture through high rates of alcoholism,
domestic violence, child abuse, suicides, broken families, and the loss of dignity, culture,
traditions, and languages—in short, a crisis of loss. PTSD is most often identified in

individuals following the aftermath of wars, natural disasters, and other traumatic,
uncontrollable events that deeply impact the individual psyche. In the case of Native
America, the shared trauma of conquest and assimilation has continued for decades after
the last Indian war (1918) was fought less than a hundred years ago—still recent in their
collective consciousness.97 I contend that the collective psyche of Native America has
suffered from and continues to suffer from culture-wide PTSD in varying degrees.

Imagine a whole continent of people whose way of life had vanished, whose
ability to control or gain their most basic needs was precarious, whose sacred sites were
disrespected and destroyed by their conquerors, and who had little to no control over the
future of their children and grandchildren—then one can catch a glimpse of the depth of
PTSD in the American Indian community. By the early 1970s Indian newspapers and
magazines began to report a spiritual awakening, a “silent revival” of renewed pride in
traditional ways that arose and swept across reservations in the United States and Canada.
Steps were taken, some of them quite loudly, to retrieve and save as much as possible of
the North American Indian identity, to demand equal rights under the law, to return to
traditions that were being ursurped by the 1960s’ back-to-nature flower children, to
become again.98 However, no trauma has been greater, more difficult to recover from, or
more destructive than the on-reservation and off-reservation boarding school systems.
The Meriam Report openly stated that “the belief has apparently been that the shortest

of Yaquis Indians camped on a ridge. Historians consider the Nez Perce War of 1877 as the last great
conflict, but ample evidence of “skirmishes” show that solitary bands of Indians who suddenly found
themselves in battle with the U.S. Calvary certainly considered it as war. A timeline of federal acts shows
how immediate the resolutions have been in an attempt to assuage the trauma: Indian Reorganization Act,
1834; American Citizenship Act, 1924; Indian Civil Rights Act, 1968; Indian Education Act, 1972;
American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 1978; and the Indian Child Welfare Act, 1978.

stamp out the old Indian life.”99

It did not work. What it did was create generational PTSD on a massive scale.

The double tragedy of Indian children’s boarding school experiences and missionaries’
work on the Navajo reservation cannot be separated. It is important to remember that
Diné and non-Diné were both traveling in the same impending boat of PTDS. Moving
onto a reservation can be likened to the culture shock of moving to another country with
its unfamiliar customs and language. The difference is that the non-Diné could get out of
the boat at will and go home. The Diné had to stay and deal with the tidal wave of
destruction created by governmental policies and forced Christianization, regardless of
good intentions on either part. A case in point is the Church of Christ’s Manuelito Navajo
Children’s Home, which morphed from a mission into a vitally needed service of survival
for mothers and their children. In a double-bind, teachers and ministers were mandated
both by the federal government and by their respective religious institutions to remake in
their own image an entire culture of people.100 Some teachers and ministers were kind
and well-meaning, but far too many were lacking in aptitudes and abilities to cope with
the enormity of their assigned task. When stressors reached a breaking point and there
was no real oversight by a just authority or accountability, it was the Diné children and
their parents who suffered the consequences.101 The dichotomist double standard of
American manifest destiny, “born from the minds of Christian men,” had decided it was
God’s Will that Christian civilization should extend from “sea to shining sea,” regardless
of the original claims on the land by its native citizens—separation of church and state on

the Navajo reservation displayed a tragic irony of disunified and forced togetherness
instead of equalitarian separateness, instituted by the government of a country that built
its entire system of governance on the founding principle of separation of church and
state.102

From the perspective of the Bahá’í teachings, the disunity among the different
Christian churches on the Navajo reservation that Boyce was so dismayed about and that
the Meriam Report so clearly documented as a source of competitive strife would be
acknowledged as an expected part of the process included in the “rolling up” of the old
world order announced by Bahá’u’lláh: “By My Self! The day is approaching when We
will have rolled up the world and all that is therein, and spread out a new order in its
stead. He [God], verily, is powerful over all things.”103 Speaking about this process from
the perspective of the last century and a half, the Bahá’í writings tell of an “observable
acceleration” between the two processes of the “disintegration of the old order and the
progress and consolidation of the new world order” initiated by the coming of the Bahá’í
Faith, a process that “may well come to be regarded by future historians as one of the
most remarkable features of this period.”104 According to ʻAbdu’l-Bahá, in this new
order “religion must be the cause of unity, harmony and agreement among mankind. . . .
If it be the cause of discord and hostility, if it leads to separation and creates conflict, the
absence of religion would be preferable in the world.”105 Another statement by ʻAbdu’l-

Bahá emphasizes that “prejudice and fanaticism, whether sectarian, denominational,
patriotic or political, are destructive to the foundation of human solidarity.”106

Having said this, the Bahá’í teachings paint an encouraging picture of the destiny
of the American continent as having “signs and evidences of very great advancement; its
future is even more promising, for its influence and illumination are far-reaching, and it
will lead all nations spiritually. The flag of freedom and banner of liberty have been
unfurled here, but the prosperity and advancement of a city, the happiness and greatness
of a country depend upon its hearing and obeying the call of God.”107 These Bahá’í
statements decry disunity among religions, such as observed on the Navajo reservation
after differing churches were established there, while at the same time while providing
their own vision of a destined new world order.

CHAPTER TWO
EXAMINING RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY: THE BÁBÍ AND BAHÁ’Í FAITHS

Rambo wrote that religious ideology “shapes the conversion process,” which is
“mediated through people, institutions, communities, and groups.”108 Conversion
becomes an ongoing process that occurs over time through the beliefs and principles
embedded in a religion’s institutional organization, even though one single event, such as
the Great Council Fire Unity Conference of 1962 for some Diné Bahá’ís, may have
initiated that process. Understanding the history of a religion and its institutions is
important to understanding its religious ideology. This chapter introduces the history of
the Bahá’í Faith, with its two founder-prophets, who are believed by Diné Bahá’ís to be
the return of the Navajo Warrior Twins, and specific Bahá’í teachings that may have led
to acceptance of the religion by Diné Bahá’ís.

Bahá’ís date the origins of their religion to May 23, 1844, when the first of two
founding prophets, Siyyid ‘Alí-Muḥammad, made a startling announcement in Shiraz,
Persia, that he was the long-expected Imam Mahdi, the “Promised One” whose mission
was to prepare the way for the appearance of “Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest.”109
Taking the title of the Báb (the Gate), the new prophet, at the age of twenty-five, changed
existing Islamic religious practices of the time, instituted a new calendar, revealed new
laws that were to be supplanted by the greater prophet to come, and wrote the Bayán,

accepted as a holy book by his followers. Following six years of persecution by the
leading Muslim clerics for his progressive teachings and after the deaths of over one
thousand Bábí followers, the Báb was publicly executed at noon in the windswept
barracks square of Tabriz on July 9, 1850.110

According to Bahá’í accounts along with other sources, the first attempt to
execute the Báb, led by an Armenian Christian military regiment with 750 rifles that
filled the air with dense smoke, left the Báb’s seventeen-year-old disciple, who had been
suspended leaning against his chest and had begged to die with the Báb, standing alone
and unharmed against the barrack wall. A frantic search by the guards found the Báb
back in his barrack cell calmly completing his last instructions to his secretary. A Muslim
regiment was hastily assembled. The new regiment fired upon the Báb and his
companion, re-suspended against the barrack wall, riddling their bodies with bullets but
leaving their faces unmarked.111 Their deaths were witnessed by a crowd of thousands.
Western scholars, journalists, and artists, such as Comte de Gobineau, Sarah Bernhardt,
Leo Tolstoy, A.L.M. Nicolas, and Ernest Renan, “captivated by the tragic history of the
youthful Báb and his band of heroes,” left a small legacy of reports, studies, poems,
artistic depictions, and writings for “future generations to ponder upon.”112 Diné Bahá’í
Linda Wilson retells the story in her words:

> Someone told me a story about the Báb, on His martyrdom and on the second
> time when they brought out the regiment to shoot and kill Him at mid-day on July
> 9. He said, “I have not finished yet.” The first time that they shot, they didn’t
> shoot Him. They had just shot the rope that was around His neck and He was free.

brought [Him], they took Him out. They were looking for Him and they found
Him still writing. He says, “Now you can take me I’m finished.”

Wilson goes on to relate the death of the Báb to the Diné creation story of the Warrior
Twins and to the Blessing Way Chant:

> There is a prayer that He [the Báb] did; it is the Protection Way prayer. At the
> very end of that Protection Way prayer is “immeasurably exalted art Thou” and it
> goes that you will be protected to our right and to our left, to the front, to the
> back, below our feet and above our heads and all around. This is the Navajo
> Blessing Way Chant. Before our Twins left, this is the prayer that you say when
> you finish all the other prayers. It’s the prayer you say. It’s the prayer I’m
> introducing to you. They [the Twins] left back to Their Father. Before the Báb left
> to His father, this is the prayer He said.113

Linda Wilson makes yet her third connection between Diné traditions and Bahá’í
principles when she sees similarities between the two prayers for protection. As
previously described, Wilson’s first connection between Diné and the Bahá’í Faith links
the Bahá’í principle of unity in diversity with Chief Joseph’s statement that all people are
connected, and her second connection links the picture of ʻAbdu’l-Bahá’ to the Diné
Holy People. Wilson first refers to the Báb’s prayer for protection, which native Bahá’ís
recognize as a protection-way prayer because it calls for protection from the seven
directions, important in native traditions as the four directions of east, west, north, and
south, and the upward direction of Father Sky with the downward direction of Mother
Earth. The seventh direction is toward the direction of the Creator, found in human hearts
and signified by putting one’s hand over one’s heart. The Báb’s prayer calls upon God,
“the Lord of over-powering majesty, the All-Compelling,” for protection “from what
lieth in front of us and behind us, above our heads, on our right, on our left, below our
feet, and every other side to which we are exposed,” and acknowledges that “Verily Thy

\[113\] Linda Wilson, interview.

protection over all things is unfailing.”114 The Báb’s prayer is also unique because it was
“written in the Báb’s own hand, in the form of a pentacle,” instead of having his secretary
write it down while the Báb was revealing it.115 Wilson identifies the Báb’s prayer for
protection as “the Navajo Blessing Way Chant” and says, “Before our Twins left, this is
the prayer that you say when you finish all other prayers.”116 Using a differently-worded
variation of the seven directions, the Blessing Way Chant, central to Diné origin stories
and described as “the main beam in the chantway house,” instructs one to go with
blessing before, blessing behind, blessing below, blessing above, blessing around, with
blessing in one’s speech, and to “go with happiness and long life; to go mysteriously.”117
The Blessing Way, “not concerned with the healing of a specific disease but rather with
the establishment of peace and harmony,” began on the Rim of Emergence from the
underworld and contains all the important events that followed in Diné cosmology,
including the inauguration of a new cycle or era by the Warrior Twins.118

By the end of the Bábí Era (1844-1863), twenty thousand followers of the Báb
had been put to death “with such barbarous cruelty as to invoke the warm sympathy and
unqualified admiration” of the Westerners who witnessed and recorded “these
abominable outrages” in their books and diaries.119 The remains of the Báb were
preserved and concealed for 65 years by faithful believers until they were finally
transferred to a mausoleum on Mt. Carmel in Haifa in 1909.

Bahá’u’lláh (1817-1892)

A well-known and highly-respected young nobleman whom the Báb had never met
but with whom he had corresponded by letter, Mírzá Husayn-`Alí, titled Bahá’u’lláh (the
Glory of God), was imprisoned in 1852 with other prominent Bábís in the Síyáh-Chál
(Black Pit), a subterranean dungeon in Tehran that had once served as a reservoir for
public baths.120 Bahá’u’lláh recorded that during his time of imprisonment in the Síyáh-
Chál a vision came to him with full cognition of his prophethood as “Him Whom God
Shall Make Manifest”:121

> One night in a dream, these exalted words were heard on every side: “Verily We
> shall render Thee victorious by Thyself and by Thy pen. Grieve not for that which
> hath befallen Thee, neither be Thou afraid, for Thou art in safety. Ere long will
> God raise up the treasures of the earth—men who will aid Thee through Thyself
> and through Thy Name, wherewith God hath revived the hearts of such as have
> recognized Him.” During the days I lay in the prison of Ṭihrán, though the galling
> weight of the chain and the stench-filled air allowed Me but little sleep, still in
> those infrequent moments of slumber I felt as if something flowed from the crown
> of My head over My breast, even as a mighty torrent that precipitateth itself upon
> the earth from a summit of a lofty mountain. Every limb of My body would, as a
> result, be set afire. At such moments My tongue recited what no man could bear
to hear.122

After four months Bahá’u’lláh was released from the Síyáh-Chál and banished
from his native land of Persia to Baghdad. While in Baghdad, Bahá’u’lláh composed the
Kitáb-i-Íqán (Book of Certitude), which laid out God’s world-embracing plan for the
redemption of humanity, among other theological teachings. 123 Bahá’u’lláh and his
family lived nine years in Baghdad before his growing influence led the Ottoman
government to move the exiles again, this time to Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey).
Before leaving Baghdad, Bahá’u’lláh retreated on April 21, 1863, for twelve days with

his closest followers to an island in the middle of the Tigris River, subsequently named
by his followers the Garden of Ridvan (Paradise), where he announced to them that he
was “the One foretold by the Báb.”124 Shoghi Effendi’s historical accounting of the Bábí
and Bahá’í Faiths in God Passes By captures the scene of departure from the island
garden:

> The departure of Bahá’u’lláh from the Garden of Ridvan, at noon, on the 14th of
> Dhi'l-Qa'dih 1279 A.H. (May 3, 1863), witnessed scenes of tumultuous

> and lamented. The chiefs and notables who had congregated were struck with
> wonder. Emotions were stirred to such depths as no tongue can describe, nor
> could any observer escape their contagion.”125

The band of exiles arrived in Constantinople on August 16, 1863, after an arduous
three-month journey, only to be banished again four months later suddenly and without
warning in the dead of winter to Adrianople in the remotest regions of the Ottoman
Empire. In the early fall of 1867, Bahá’u’lláh announced his mission through letters to
the kings and rulers of Persia, Turkey, Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Britain, to the Pope
along with the entire Christian sacerdotal order, and with letters to the Caliph and leaders
of Shíʻih and Sunní Islám, and to the high priest of the Zoroastrian religion.126 In these
letters, Bahá’u’lláh warned of a world torn apart in the nineteenth century that would give
birth to a new world civilization based on the oneness of all humanity.127 He called upon

the rulers, kings, and religious leaders to champion his cause and to work toward
achieving world unity. Bahá’u’lláh wrote in his letters,

The Ottoman Empire was crumbling and its skittish Turkish authorities
considered Bahá’u’lláh, highly esteemed and respected even in exile, a political threat as
well as a religious threat. An imperial order with no hope of recourse was issued.
Bahá’u’lláh’s final exile, in August, 1868, with nearly eighty members of his family and
closest companions, led them from Adrianople to the notoriously foul prison-city of
‘Akká, Palestine—so named after St. Jean d’Acre of the Crusaders.129 The final years of
Bahá’u’lláh’s life, although he was still a prisoner, were spent outside the confines of the
walled prison-city in a countryside residence a short distance from ‘Akká, where he died

in 1892.130 Bahá’u’lláh wrote the equivalent of over one hundred volumes during his
ministry, including the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Book of Laws).131

During his interview, Diné Bahá’í Alfred Kahn, Jr. drew an important parallel
between Bahá’u’lláh’s exiles and the Diné’s history of exile and imprisonment:

> Bahá’u’lláh’s message came 140 years ago. By that time Bahá’u’lláh was exiled
> in Akká. He had to go on a long journey and He was exiled from His homeland
> and He was taken to a different place. At the same time, the Navajos were
> rounded up and 8,000 Navajos were forced to go to Fort Sumner. It took a long
> walk and many of them died and suffered in that journey. There is a chronological
> parallel to Baha’u’llah and His own sufferings. We have a link to Bahá’u’lláh.132

Well over a century after Bahá’u’lláh’s arrival in Akká, Alfred Kahn, Jr. establishes
historical links between the Diné and Bahá’í similarities of removal, imprisonment, and
“long walks” that occurred in the same time period of the mid-to late-1800s half a world
apart, separated not only by distance but by a world of differences in customs and
languages. By Diné Bahá’ís recognizing these mutual links of removal, imprisonment,
and tortuous long walks between their own ancestors and Bahá’u’lláh, his family, and
followers, a strong sense of kinship and of mutual survivorship becomes established
emotionally and cognitively. This strong sense of ownership could lead Diné Bahá’ís to
an even greater belief or acceptance that the Bahá’í Faith came intentionally to them.

ʻAbdu´l-Bahá (1844-1921). Bahá’u’lláh appointed his eldest son, ‘Abbás

new covenant and the authorized interpreter of his writings in his Will and Testament.

revolution of 1908 freed the political and religious prisoners of the Ottoman Empire,
ʻAbdu´l-Bahá traveled in Africa, Europe, Canada, and the United States from 1910
to1913.133 His talks, given in universities, halls, churches, trade unions, and peace
societies to capacity audiences, were widely covered by the press of the time. During his
administration, ʻAbdu´l-Bahá wrote over 27,000 documents and oversaw the affairs of
the fledging religion on an international scale. ‘Abdu´l-Bahá was knighted on April 27,
1920, by an agent for the King of England in recognition of his humanitarian services to
the Palestinian people during the famine created in the wake of World War I.134 ʻAbdu´l-
Bahá’s funeral in Palestine, attended by over ten thousand people, included “dignitaries
of the Muslim, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Jewish, and Druze communities, as
well as the British High Commissioner and the governors of Jerusalem and Phoenicia.”135

Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957). ‘Abdu´l-Bahá appointed his eldest grandson,
Shoghi Effendi, who had also been a prisoner for the first eleven years of his life in Akká
with his family, as his successor. Designated by his grandfather as the “Guardian of the
Cause of God” and educated at Oxford, Shoghi Effendi authoratively translated into
English the major writings of the “Three Central Figures” of the religion before his

of God” by Shoghi Effendi took up the reins of leadership following his death in 1957.138
The Hands called for the first election of the permanent institution of the Universal House
of Justice in 1963, as ordained by Bahá’u’lláh. Its nine members were elected by all of
the members of the fifty-six National Spiritual Assemblies already in place around the
world. The members of the first Universal House of Justice came from four continents,
three major religious backgrounds (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim), and a variety of
ethnic origins.139 The House of Justice, seated in a Parthenon-style white marble building
on the side of Mount Carmel and reelected by secret ballot every five years, administers
all the affairs of the Faith with an unchallenged authority that its adherents accept as
divinely guided.

demonstrates the parallels Diné Bahá’ís see between the Diné Warrior Twins and the
Twin Manifestations of the new religion, between Diné Bahá’ís’ ancestors’ experiences

extensive gardens and considered the most sacred site on earth for Bahá’ís, has thousands

world make up a good percentage of the 700 volunteers who live and work at the World
Centre. In 2008 the World Heritage Centre designated the Bahá’í Holy Places in Haifa
and the Western Galilee as a World Heritage Site of “outstanding universal value.”140

Shaping Religious Ideology: Unity in Diversity

The Bahá’í principle of inclusion, of bringing all people together as equal
participants in the global community, provides autonomy and empowerment that
especially validates native peoples who have often been left out of the global equation.
The concept of unity in diversity, with the recognition of the oneness of humanity, the
oneness of a Creator, and the oneness of religion, is the cornerstone principle of the
Bahá’í teachings. Shoghi Effendi restated his great-grandfather’s teaching of unity in
diversity, upheld and reinforced by his grandfather, that humanity, after a long and
turbulent adolescence, has now reached its first stages of maturity when its organic unity

\[140\] Bahá’í Holy Places in Haifa and the Western Galilee, http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1220 (accessed April

in a just and global society can finally be established.141 Shoghi Effendi outlined this goal
of inclusion when he said,

> The unification of the whole of mankind is the hallmark of the stage which human
> society is now approaching. Unity of family, tribe, city-state, and nation has been
> successfully attempted and fully established. World unity is the goal toward
> which a harassed humanity is striving in which the autonomy of its state members
> and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are
> definitely and completely safeguarded. 142

The Universal House of Justice states that Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-Aqdas, or Book
of Laws, known as the “Most Holy Book,” is “of unique importance” because it is the
“Charter” of the future world civilization that Bahá’u’lláh has come to raise up” and its
“provisions rest squarely on the foundations established by past religions.”143 “Concepts
of the past are brought to a new level of understanding” in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, and
Bahá’u’lláh’s new social laws, addressed to the entire “human family,” are designed to
last for centuries. Some laws, “directed primarily to . . . a specific section of humanity,”
are readily understood by them but not by those of a different culture. Laws govern “the
individual’s relationship to God, physical and spiritual matters which benefit the
individual directly, and relations among individuals and between the individual and
society.” The “society for which certain of the laws of the Aqdas are designed will come
only come gradually into being,” and Bahá’u’lláh has thus provided for the “progressive
application” of Bahá’í law.144 The Bahá’í International Community’s Office of Public
Information statement on the “Prosperity of Humankind” acknowledges “the wealth of all
the genetic and cultural diversity that has evolved through the past ages” and says now

the task of the peoples of the earth is to “draw on their collective inheritance” and
become responsible “for the design of their future.” 145 A materialistic approach to social
and economic development that “reflects a profound error of conception about human
nature itself” must be rejected, and “spiritual dimensions of life and motivation that
transcend a constantly changing economic landscape and an artificially imposed division
of human societies into developed and undeveloped societies must be sought.”146

For Diné Bahá’ís, these points of universal inclusiveness, with specific mention of
tribal peoples, provide a much-needed renewal of empowerment, acknowledgement, and
autonomy. During his interview, an elderly Diné Bahá’í remembers becoming a Bahá’í in
1962 as one of the first members of his family to embrace the new religion. Elected to the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States in 1969, he traveled to Haifa to
participate in the 1973 election of the Universal House of Justice. He talks about the
differences in economics:

> And when we met with all the different races in Haifa, Israel, it was like, ah, 133
> different races there, the first time I went there. And each one of them, they want
> to talk with me in particular. And I explain myself about life and what native
> people are doing in the United States. They want to know everything. So many
> things they want to know. So, I began to tell them really how important
> economics was, how important that they spread their economic and what’s in
> their, ah, in their economics. And that’s one of the hardest lessons anybody can
> learn around the world. Everybody has a different kind of money. Everyone has a
> different idea. Everybody has their own opinion about life. And it was really
> exciting.147

This Diné Bahá’í was able to experience and see firsthand the principle of universal
inclusiveness when he attended the election of the House of Justice in Haifa, Israel.

Bahá’u’lláh’s principles of the elimination of economic prejudices and the elimination of
extremes between wealth and poverty that leave many people in abject misery while
other people accumulate exorbitant wealth appealed to this Diné businessman.148
According to ʻAbdu’l-Bahá, the welfare of all nations will be assured “whenever the ties
between nations become strengthened and the exchange of commodities accelerated.”149
In the future new world order to come, the “inequality of portion and privilege,” one of
the “deep and vital problems of human society,” will be remedied through “an
equalization and apportionment by which all may possess the comforts and privileges of
life,” both through “legislative readjustment of conditions” and voluntary giving from the
rich to the poor.150 This equalization and apportionment process will thus provide the
assurance that the “composure of the world by the establishment of this principle in the
religious life of mankind” will be effected.151 Coming from the poverty-stricken Navajo
reservation as this Diné Bahá’í did, and remembering the harsh times that the Diné
experienced after returning from Ft. Sumner, these principles espousing an balance
within the world’s economics must have impressed and inspired him. When other Bahá’í
attendees at the election of the Universal House of Justice asked the Diné Bahá’í
questions about his life and culture, the potential for unity of economics among the
diverse nations of the world was his topic of choice.

The Diné were already familiar with the Bahá’í concept of “unity in diversity”
from their oral tradition of Holy Wind, a “deity formed as it were of component Winds

which exist all about and within the living things of the world.”152 Psychological
anthropologist James McNeley sought to understand the Diné ethnopsychology of singers
in Holy Wind in Navajo Philosophy. Singers are Diné medicine men who create
sandpaintings and perform healing ceremonies through singing, or chants. Singing, based
on wind, air, and atmosphere, is central to understanding Diné theology, cosmology, and
personality.153 Wind, McNeley writes, has many different names and attributes in Navajo
cosmology but still, “it is the unitary Wind which bears different names and has diverse
characteristics; naming particular aspects of Wind does not differentiate it from the
whole, just as our naming of a sea does not imply that the waters referred to are distinct
from the great body of water encompassing the whole Earth.”154 Holy Wind is the teacher
of qualities and attributes “standing within us” that give direction to Diné life.155 Diné
Bahá’ís recognized this same allegorical concept when, speaking as the “Voice of the
Creator,” Bahá’u’lláh said,

> O Son of Spirit! I created thee rich, why dost thou bring thyself down to poverty?
> Noble I made thee, wherewith dost thou abase thyself? Out of the essence of
> knowledge I gave thee being, why seekest thou enlightenment from anyone
> besides Me? Out of the clay of love I moulded thee, how dost thou busy thyself
> with another? Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou mayest find Me standing
> within thee, mighty, powerful and self-subsisting.156

The concept of wind as life-producing, life-giving, and teacher standing within both Diné
oral traditions and Bahá’í ideology as Spirit standing within one forms yet another
powerful bonding and connection for Diné Bahá’ís.

Education as Religious Ideology

Education, obligatory and highly valued in Bahá’í teachings, provides the primary
means to true and permanent progress on all levels of human activity, with the other
principles of the Faith placed within the auspices of global education.157 According to
ʻAbdu´l-Bahá, “education is of three kinds: material, human, and spiritual.”158 Material
education, common to humans and animals, focuses on the physical body’s progress and
development through attainment of its substance, comfort, and ease. Human education
can be achieved through the civilizing forces of government and administration,
charitable works and trades, an elevation of the arts and crafts, and the sciences that lead
to great inventions and discoveries of physical laws.159 ʻAbdu’l-Bahá wrote that these
complementary activities of education are what distinguish humans from animals and are
seen as vitally essential to the progress of humanity:160

> There are certain pillars which have been established as the unshakable supports
> of the Faith of God. The mightiest of these is learning and use of the mind, the
> expansion of consciousness, and insight into the realities of the universe and the
> hidden mysteries of almighty God. To promote knowledge is thus an inescapable
> duty imposed on every one of the Friends of God. . . . Through education savage
> nations become civilized, and even the animals become domesticated. Education
> must be considered as most important, for as diseases in the world of bodies are
> extremely contagious, so, in the same way, qualities of spirit and heart are
> extremely contagious. Education has a universal influence, and the differences
> caused by it are very great. 161

In Bahá’í teachings a difference applies between sons and daughters if parents can
only afford to educate one child. If a choice has to be made, daughters should be educated
first because daughters “will one day be mothers, and the mother is the first teacher of the

child.”162 Those mothers who are themselves uneducated cannot educate their children,
thereby setting up a situation difficult for the child to remedy later in life. The Bahá’í
injunction to first educate girls reinforces and validates Diné Bahá’ís’ views of their own
matrilineal social structure, formed through the Diné creation stories of First Woman and
First Man, and later through Changing Woman.
In this chapter I have looked briefly at the basic history of the Bahá’í Faith, its
founders and succession of leadership, and at two of its foundational principles of unity
in diversity and universal education. Some of the religious ideology or principal
teachings of the Bahá’í Faith were briefly examined, especially those teachings that fit
with Diné cosmology and may have served as one of the catalysts moving some Dinés
toward being Baha’i. The two principles of unity in diversity and the education of
children, especially daughters, fit the Diné need for inclusion in the larger world
community and for validation of their matrilineal culture. The voice of an elderly Diné
Bahá’í was heard who traveled the world after his becoming Bahá’í, and how excited he
was to talk with others about the need for a “spiritual solution to the economic problems”
at an international Bahá’í conference composed of a wide diversity of people. The Diné
creation story of Changing Woman was set within the context of the education of
daughters, in particular, which validates the Diné matrilineal culture. Chapter three
allows for further exploration of Changing Woman and her role in Diné cosmology.

CHAPTER THREE
CHANGING WOMAN AND THE WARRIOR TWINS

The Bahá’í injunction to first educate girls reinforces and validates Diné Bahá’ís’
views of their own matrilineal and matrilocal social structure, formed through the Diné
creation stories of First Woman and First Man and later through stories about Changing
Woman. The holy spirit Talking God found Changing Woman as an infant, “lying under
a dark cloud with a rainbow and soft, falling rain” and “strapped into a cradle made of
rainbow, lightning, and sunbeams.”163 The infant was given to First Man and First
Woman who, under the tutelage of Diyin Dine’ē, the Holy People, raised her in a
“miracle way” with “sunray pollen, pollen from clouds, pollen from plants and flower
dew so that she matured miraculously, coming into womanhood, or menarche, within
twelve days.” 164 It was the event of Changing Woman’s coming into womanhood that
established the all-important Blessing Way ceremony, the Kinaaldā. Changing Woman
gave birth to the Warrior Twins named Monster Slayer and Born For Water who were
fathered by the Sun, constituting the “holy family” of Diné theology.165 Later, Changing
Woman decided to create humans, the Nihookáá Diné, brought to life by her breath and
the Holy Winds entering into their bodies.166

As young men, the Warrior Twins saved the world by slaying all Monsters except
for Death, Disease, Hunger, Poverty, and Old Age, and they gave the Diné the weapons

of sacred ceremonies and prayers to use for healing and the good life.167 Without
Changing Woman and her sons, there may not have been any Diné Bahá’ís two millennia
later. Every major religious system has an expectation of a spiritual return of their
spiritual leader, including the Diné traditional belief of the return of the Warrior Twins.
The Diné Bahá’ís who were interviewed based a great part of their acceptance of the
Bahá’í Faith on their understanding that the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh fulfill their ancient
prophecy of this expected return.

Progressive Revelation: Return of the Warrior Twins

The Bahá’í principle of progressive revelation explains why Diné Bahá’ís
consider the “Twin Manifestations” of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh as the return of the Diné
Warrior Twins. “Return” in Bahá’í theology is much like grades in a school that
continually build one upon the other: humanity progresses from the return of a great
teacher or prophet from age to age. Each great teacher, designated in the Bahá’í texts as a
“Manifestation of God,” reviews and renews the teachings of the prior great teachers and
brings new knowledge.168 Referring to all the great teachers, Bahá’u’lláh explained,

> Every Prophet Whom the Almighty and Peerless Creator hath purposed to send to
> the peoples of the earth hath been entrusted with a Message, and charged to act in
> a manner that would best meet the requirement of the age in which He appeared.
> God’s purpose in sending His Prophets unto men is twofold. The first is to
> liberate the children of men from the darkness of ignorance, and to guide them to
> the light of true understanding. The second is to ensure the peace and tranquility
> of mankind, and provide all the means by which they can be established. . . .

These Divine Messengers have been sent down and their Books were revealed for

\[167\] Schwarz, Molded in the Image, 24.

\[168\] Hatcher and Martin, Bahá’í Faith, 100-29.

the purpose of promoting the knowledge of God, and of furthering unity and
fellowship amongst men. 169

The Warrior Twins, titled the “Monster Slayers,” are seen by the Diné as their ancient
divine messengers. Archival material written by an anonymous Diné Bahá’í explained
that the Monster Slayers were expected to return to the Diné, “reborn by the iniquities of
all humankind,” and give to all humankind “the spiritual weapons to battle and slay all
the Monsters.”170 The anonymous Diné Bahá’í spoke of the return of the Warrior Twins
as the “New Day” that would be signaled by “terrible trials for the Diné,” but the “Wise
Ones” [Holy People] knew that they would see “the death throes of the Old Era” and the
birth of the “New Era.”171 The anonymous Diné Bahá’í’s terminology parallels that of
Bahá’u’lláh’s when Bahá’u’lláh described the old era as a rolling up of the old world
order and the new era as spreading out of the new world order: “By My Self! The day is
approaching when We will have rolled up the world and all that is therein, and spread out
a new order in its stead. He, verily, is powerful over all things.”172

Intriguingly, historian of religions Karl Luckert unexpectedly came across a
reference to “a new age” when he was documenting a soon-to-be extinct Navajo Ajiłee
ceremony in 1976.173 His informant, eighty-year-old Claus Chee Sonny, was relating
ceremonial knowledge from Lava Butte and the different kinds of snakes in many colors,
stripes, and spots that the traveling Deer People saw there. Sonny says, “And we see all
of these kinds today. Information was given to them [the Holy Deer People]: ‘When a

\[170\] “Navajo Prophesy and its Fulfillment in the Bahá’í Faith” (private collection, n.d.), 1. “Reborn by”

new age begins, these snakes will appear at various places—different ones who have
never been seen before.” 174 Luckert did not know what to make of Sonny’s statement,
noting that it “seems somewhat out of place,” and he was “inclined to interpret it as a
spark from the ancient Middle American ideology.”175 Sonny’s impromptu disclosure to
Luckert in the middle of documenting the Ajiłee ceremony takes on new meaning when
examined in the context of the eschatological return of the Warrior Twins.

Snakes are sacred symbols of healing to the Diné and represent “the power to
return to the Center of Mother Earth from whence all living things spring.”176 The Holy
Deer People’s statement that in a new age new snakes will appear in various places
would have been interpreted by Diné Bahá’ís as a signal that the new age had arrived
with the spiritual return of the Warrior Twins in the forms of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh,
who, Diné Bahá’ís believe, brought new weapons for healing the iniquities of all
humankind through their updated sociological and spiritual teachings. Here, the analogy
of new snakes never seen before is another return or renewal, symbolic of the return of a
new springtime or new age. What the anonymous Diné Bahá’í wrote about the healing of
humankind’s iniquities and what Sonny said about snakes (symbols of healing) appearing
in a new age parallel each other in Diné expectations of the return of the Warrior Twins.
The return is a renewal that brings new life and a new creation. Sandner quotes Mircea
Eliade: “We get the impression that for archaic societies life cannot be repaired; it can

only be re-created by a return to sources. And the ‘source of sources’ is the prodigious
outpouring of energy, life, and fecundity that occurred at the Creation of the world.”177

Diné Alfred Kahn, Jr., a twenty-three-year-old architect (Appendix E-7), was
asked how and why he became a Bahá’í. He said he had been raised as a Bahá’í his entire
life because his parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were Bahá’ís, but he was
still required to make a choice: “When you turn fifteen in the Faith everyone has to make
the decision what religion you’re going to be in and I chose to be Baha’i.”178 Alfred, Jr.’s
answer lies in his understanding of the eschatological returning of the Warrior Twins:

> As I understand it there are Navajo prophesies of Messengers coming from the
> east. And the way I understand the story is that two Navajo children were born a
> long time ago, [and] during that time they were born there was hardship that was

> spiritual afflictions that was happening to the Navajos. So the Navajo people were
> asking for help and they needed assistance and so they prayed for it. The prayer
> was answered through these two youth. The Two Youth, knowing the afflictions
> that were caused against the Navajo people, went on this journey towards the Sun,
> their Father. On their journey they went through a series of trials and through
> those trials they learned how to sort of rise above the afflictions. As they passed
> through the series of trials and they finished, they received weapons from the
> Father Sun and they came back to the Navajo people armed with a bow and
> arrow, which represent the way to overcome those challenges; the discipline and
> spiritual qualities that [it]would take to overcome those spiritual afflictions. So
> when the Navajo received that blessing of the Twin Manifestations for that time
> they said, there would be a time when you will be afflicted by spiritual afflictions
> and the Monsters will return and look for Us to come from the east. As a Navajo,
> it’s a continuation of Navajo culture to wait for those Twin Manifestations to
> come—those Two Youth to help with the afflictions. Because right now it is
> obvious that the Navajo are going through so many afflictions, materialism has
> spread across the whole reservation. The reservation is really split, is disunified.
> So much of the reservation is affected by alcoholism and greed and materialism

Zolbrod relates that Navajos old enough to remember World War II could grasp the
evilness of Hitler by relating him to the fearsome monster Yé’iitsoh, the Big Giant who
eats the people (an affliction) and who led the other monsters in eating people.179 While
Alfred, Jr. does not remember World War II per se, he knows about the effect that World
War II had on his Diné homeland and culture due to the number of Diné soldiers who
served in the war, and because of the famous Navajo code talkers who were instrumental
in turning the tide of the war against Hitler. A monument to the Code Talkers stands in
front of the Navajo Nation’s geological landmark, Window Rock. Alfred, Jr. continues
with his reasoning of the return of the Warrior Twins:

The promise or special station that Alfred, Jr. refers to was made by ʻAbdu’l-Bahá in
regard to the capacities of the indigenous peoples of the American continent, which
includes Canada and South America in addition to the United States. ʻAbdu’l-Bahá’s
statement or promise, examined in chapter 4, validates the Bahá’í principle of both unity
in diversity and the protection of cultures, made possible through the “proper training and
education,” noted by Alfred, Jr. Through this training, Diné Bahá’ís can “arm” themselves

\[179\] Paul G. Zolbrod, Diné bahané: The Navajo Creation Story (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico
Press, 1984), 22.

with the weapons of the Twin Manifestations/Monster Slayers, which include the new
spiritual and social principles and new religious laws instituted by the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh. The Twin Messengers, like the Warrior Twins before them, go directly to
God. Alfred, Jr. uses the analogy of a divine sun to link the Twin Monster Slayers with
God:

When the Twin Monster Slayers came, they went directly to God. There was no
> intermediary. They brought to us a direct connection to the Sun, to God. And
> they brought the remedy straight from the Sun. A medicine man doesn’t have that
> direct link. The medicine man goes through those Holy Ones to reach the Sun.
> And those Holy Ones, those Manifestations, They didn’t go through anybody else.
> They went to the Sun [God] with a direct connection. We turn to Them when we
> pray. Medicine men turn to Them. They are like perfect mirrors. They are the
> Ones that show us the Teachings and it is a special station, and I think medicine
> men receive guidance from Them; have this pure source but they [the medicine
> men] aren’t the source.180

Alfred Kahn, Jr. sees the present day “afflictions” on the Navajo reservation as
reflective of the “monsters” remembered from earliest Diné narratives. He sees the tools
and weapons needed to counteract these afflictions as the prayers and meditations needed
for healing, protection, and spiritual education that are essential daily requirements in
both Diné traditional belief and in tenets of the Bahá’í Faith.

Prescribed by Bahá’u’lláh as a “means for individual discipline,” Bahá’ís have an
injunction “from the age of maturity” (fifteen) to choose one of the three revealed
obligatory prayers and to say it each day in accordance with any instructions that
accompany it.181 For example, the short obligatory prayer said between noon and sunset,
simple but profound in its content, offers a reason for being: “I bear witness, O my God,
that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee. I testify at this moment to

\[180\] Alfred Kahn, Jr., interview.

my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth. There is none
other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.”182

As demonstrated in the noonday prayer, Bahá’ís direct their prayers to God, the
Creator, and not to the Twin Manifestations as Alfred, Jr. appeared to indicate. However,
according to Bahá’í teachings, since the Manifestations of God are “the highest form of
creation,” and since the Creator/Sun/God will always remain “the unknowable essence”
to his creation (humanity) except through the Manifestations, Bahá’ís can “turn to them”
as intermediaries when praying, as explained by Alfred, Jr. in his interview.183

A small typed inscription by the artist of a sandpainting that has been in Alfred,
Jr.’s parents’ home for many years informs its viewers that the figures (Yé’is) represented
in sandpaintings are supernatural beings from Navajo tradition considered as
intermediaries between the Diné (People) and the “Most Sacred Diné God.” Appearing in
many ceremonial sandpaintings, the male Yé’is usually have square heads while the
females have round heads. The colorful male Yé’i shown in the Kahn sandpainting
encloses the calligraphic Bahá’í symbol of the “Greatest Name” of God within its
boundaries.184 Zolbrod identified Yé’is as representing different aspects of nature, both
positive and negative, in the ancestral covenant between the Nihookāā Dine’ē (First
Navajos) and the Diyin Dine’ē (Holy People).185 Talking God, in the narrative of
Changing Woman, and Yé’iitsoh, the Big Giant in Zolbrod’s account, are examples of
Yé’is. The concept of Yé’is, already familiar to the Diné Bahá’ís from their Diné
mythology, gave them the understanding of the need for an intermediary between

humanity and the “Most Sacred Diné God.” Assigning the role of intermediary to the
Twin Manifestations would have come naturally, as it did for Alfred, Jr.

Spiritual Tools: New Covenants

Zolbrod writes that when responsibility for the world was given to the Nihookāā
Dine’ē, Changing Woman and the other Diyin Dine’ē gave the Nihookāā Dine’ē
components of their ancestral knowledge in songs, prayers, ceremonies, and stories.186
These together formed a charter for life, a contract or covenant between the Nihookāā
Dine’ē and the Diyin Dine’ē, who gave the Nihookāā Dine’ē the right to live within
Dinétah. The Diné would be under the special protection of the Diyin Dine’ē as long as
they stayed within the guidelines or boundaries of the covenant. Zolbrod quotes Diné
historian Harry Walters when he talks about origin stories containing the knowledge
needed to guide the people of today:

> Origin stories offer guidance to contemporary people because they compress
> historical knowledge and human experience into vivid narratives that can
> illuminate and educate. . . . All components of Navajo culture are based on four
> main levels of knowledge, each of which can be subdivided into three additional
> levels of abstraction; twelve distinct levels of knowledge are encoded into each
> episode of the origin stories. Navajo educators draw upon these levels of
abstraction to illuminate ancestral teachings. 187

Zolbrod gives an outline of the four main levels of knowledge that Walters refers
to as encoded in the Diné origin stories. The Diné’s twelve levels of ascending
knowledge echo the Bahá’í concept of the progression of the world of humanity through
stages of education before arriving at the present collective stage of adulthood. The first
or elementary level of Diné knowledge, hózhǭǭjí hane’, instructs young children. The

second level, diyin k’ehjí hane’, expands knowledge by incorporating information about
the twelve Holy People who represent different principles of nature and are found in all
Diné stories and ceremonies. The third level, hatāāł k’ehjí hane’, incorporates the songs
and prayers associated with each episode in the origin stories. The fourth level, naayéé’jí
hane’, concerns Naayéé’jí, or Protection Way, and is limited to those adults who hold
specialized knowledge of ceremonies.188 Donald Sandner, a Jungian psychiatrist, studied
Diné healing symbols and ceremonies to learn how Diné healers created harmony within
their patients. Saunder identified four central principles basic to protection and healing in
Diné cosmology: a return to the origins; confrontation and manipulation of evil; death
and rebirth; and a restoration of the universe.189

The principles that Sandner identified, along with Zolbrod’s explanation of the
Diné’s covenant with their Holy People, correlate with Alfred, Jr.’s conversion narrative
statement and parallel the eschatological story of the return of the Warrior Twins. This
correlation includes the expectations that Diné Bahá’ís hold for the rebirth and restoration
of their universe through the Twin Messengers of the Bahá’í Faith—and through the
renewal of the two ancient covenants found in some form in all major religious systems,
according to Baha’i Udo Schaefer.190 According to Bahá’í teachings, these ancient
covenants connect the past with the present. In 1992, designated as a “Holy Year,” the
Universal House of Justice held a worldwide commemoration in New York City, which
also commemorated the “inception” of Bahá’u’lláh’s covenant:191

It is fitting, then, that the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, which links the past and the
> future with the progressive stages towards the fulfillment of God’s ancient

According to Bahá’í belief, the “Greater Covenant” between God and humanity
has promised in each of the recorded histories of all the great religious systems of the
world that God will continue to send a succession of divine Messengers to guide and
instruct humanity.193 Humanity must recognize and accept the new Messenger when he
comes and must strive to put into practice the new teachings he brings. For this reason,
“being Bahá’í” carries with it the obligation to recognize not only the current Messenger
but to recognize and acknowledge the succession of previous Messengers.194 Thus, Diné
who “become Bahá’í” find themselves learning about and accepting the essence of the
teachings of such diverse Messengers as Zoroaster, Krishna, the Buddha, and
Muhammad, in addition to Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. While the teachings of each
Messenger differ according to time and place, and over time the followers of each system
have modified and reinterpreted the original teachings of their Messenger, the essence or
essential message remains unchanged. According to Schaefer, a “distinguishing epithet”
has been historically attached to each religion.195 As an example, the essence of
Zoroastrianism is purity; the essence of Judaism is justice; the essence of Buddhism is
detachment; the essence of Christianity is love; the essence of Islam is absolute

submission; and the essence of the Bahá’í Faith is unity.196 Perhaps as important to North,
South, and Central American Bahá’ís, the Creator’s system of providing guidance to
humanity through progressive divine messengers validates their belief in their own
indigenous messengers such as Deganawida for the Iroquois, Quetzalcoatl for the Toltec,
Chilam Balam for the Itza-Maya of Yucatan, White Buffalo Calf Woman for the Sioux,
and the Warrior Twins for the Diné.197 According to Bahá’í teachings, there have always
been Manifestations of God, but many of their names have been “lost in the mists of
ancient history.”198

In order to accomplish the ongoing task of moving humanity forward, the “Lesser
Covenant” between the Manifestation and humanity changes according to the needs of
each new age. In the Bahá’í teachings, each Manifestation has made a new covenant with
those followers who recognize his station and has provided them with the means to
accomplish the task of the age, with the understanding that they will accept his appointed
successor after him. If the followers accept the appointed successor, the religion can
remain united and pure—if not, the religion becomes divisive and its force for good
dissipated. In each age, the Lesser Covenant, not lesser in importance but rather as an
auxiliary to the Greater Covenant, functions within the framework of the goals and
purposes of the Greater Covenant for the re-unification of humanity. Using Sandner’s

identified principles of healing, I argue that Dine Bahá’ís could see their new covenants
as the rebirth and restoration of their universe.199

Springtime as Return

Ábdu’l-Bahá likened the repeating cycles of the seasons to progressive revelation
or return; each new spring puts forth signs of its imminent appearance, but no spring
arrives exactly in the order or appearance of its preceding season. He explained,

> Springtime is springtime, no matter when or how often it comes. The divine
> Prophets are as the coming of spring, each renewing and quickening the teachings
> of the Prophet Who came before Him. Just as all seasons of spring are essentially
> one as to the newness of life, vernal showers and beauty, so the essence of the
> mission and accomplishment of all the Prophets is one and the same.200

A two-page Naw Ruz (New Year) greeting from the American Indian Teaching
Committee (AITC) in March, 1976, quotes a talk given by Diné Bahá’í Alice Steffes to a
gathering of some 300 Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í Indians in Los Angeles. Steffes, an Oneida
Indian and the first American Indian to tradition-transition into Bahá’í, compared the
return to the “extensive ceremonials of prayers and chanting before, during and after the
planting of seeds” and informed her audience that “this rhythmic pattern, the Bahá’ís are
already aware of. . . . The Bahá’ís are ready and willing to join you in learning the new
Teachings from the new Messenger to bring new meaning through which Indian people
will enlighten the world.”201 Prior to Steffes’s talk, a one-page tract developed for the
1972 Bahá’í Unity Conference had already reinforced the expectation of the restoration
of the universe for Diné Bahá’ís through progressive revelation. Titled “The Straight

Path,” with Diné symbols of Father Sky and Mother Earth decorating its cover, the tract
resonates with Diné theology:202

> The All-Wise Creator of earth and heaven has from the beginning which has no

A blending of religious imagery from Bahá’í statements, such as found in this
Bahá’í tract, melds with Diné oral stories and is replete with metaphorical images of
nature that lead into religious ideology. The origin story of the Warrior Twins, also
replete with metaphorical images of nature that parallel such Bahá’í statements, are
examples of Rambo’s idea that religious imagery “influences the consciousness” of the
convert. In this case, Diné Bahá’í converts may be influenced by the imagery from nature
found in the Bahá’í writings.204 The Diné, like most tribal societies and regardless of any
other religious affiliations, continue to incorporate nature into their cosmology and look
to its manifestations for a significant part of their interpretations of how the Creator
works. Tribal societies have looked to natural phenomena as a “mythopoeic doorway” for
their understanding of the divine throughout the long history of nature-based cultures
such as the Diné’s.205 In his interview, Alfred Kahn, Jr. uses aspects of the natural world

Images of nature, as spoken or visual representations of religious imagery and used as a
tool to influence the consciousness, have the power to inspire, motivate, spiritualize, and
change an adherent’s or a potential adherent’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

Nature as Religious Ideology. Significant statements within the Bahá’í writings
on nature are replete with images and analogies of nature as a way to illumine and elevate
high spiritual ideals, with which Diné Bahá’ís readily identify. In September, 1996, the
Bahá’í Faith became the sixth major religion to join the World Wide Fund for Nature’s
Network on Conservation and Religion (WWF). A compilation issued by the Research
Department of the UHJ for the WWF’s conference in Assisi, Italy, offered the Bahá’í
position on nature in this statement from Bahá’u’lláh: “Nature, in its essence, is the
embodiment of My Name, the Maker, the Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by
varying causes, and in this diversity there are signs for men of discernment. Nature is
God’s Will and is its expression in and through the contingent world.”207 The UHJ

\[206\] Alfred Kahn, Jr., interview.

Delhi: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 2005), 39.

explains that Bahá’u’lláh’s words “outline the essential relationship between man and the
environment: that the grandeur and diversity of the natural world are purposeful
reflections of the majesty and bounty of God. For Bahá’ís, there follows an implicit
understanding that nature is to be respected and protected as a divine trust for which we
are answerable.”208 Animals are included in this divine trust, with an injunction from
Bahá’u’lláh to “not look upon the creatures of God except with the eye of kindliness and
of mercy.”209 Bahá’u’lláh, known for his love and appreciation of nature, said, “The
country is the world of the soul; the city is the world of bodies.” 210 An elderly Diné
medicine man and Bahá’í expressed the connection between Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings on
nature and his Diné traditions in this way:

> It is the same Faith renewed because [in]our traditional way of life, people are
> forgetting, and they are going to a new one that are waiting for talking to hear
> about our traditional ways. Bahá’ís have it. Bahá’u’lláh expressed Himself just
> like our prophecy. He revealed the same story, very, very much the same story
> about culture, about life, about nature, about water, air, about Mother Earth and
> Father Sky. Yeh, so Mother Nature supports us in every way just like Bahá’í Faith
> does, from nature.211

This Diné elder continued to express in his interview that he most often linked the Bahá’í
teachings to nature during his many public talks. Nature, so essential to the life and spirit
of Diné people, cannot be separated from their traditional belief system or separated from
their belief as Bahá’ís in nature’s manifestations as a spiritual teacher.

ceremony, only to be swept away, hours later, when they have served their purpose.

Those same images can now be permanently held on boards and mounted on one’s wall,
such as the sandpainting that is in the Kahn home. Does the purpose of the religious or
healing imagery lose its power when the form of the image and its use are changed? The
images of Mother Earth and Father Sky from the Male Shooting Chant, chosen to
decorate the front of the Bahá’í tract discussed earlier, denotes safety, warmth, home,
security, and peace. Do Diné symbols carry the same power on a piece of board as they
do on the floor in the hogan? While the beauty of the images remains intact, the
ceremonies needed to convey the images’ healing powers are absent. The permanent
sandpainting becomes a work of art instead of a tool for healing. Perhaps, though, the
presence of a permanent sandpainting in a Diné home provides a sense of comfort and an
honored reminder of cultural traditions. Sandner said he was struck by the “intensity” and
“vividness” of the Diné sacred symbols when he first saw Diné sandpaintings. As a
psychiatrist, Sandner was searching for the “ancient roots” of his own healing discipline.
“For the Navajo,” Sandner writes, “healing is not directed toward specific symptoms or
bodily organs, but toward bringing the psyche into harmony with the whole gamut of
natural and supernatural forces. . . . Religion, medicine, and art are inextricably
intertwined in an astonishing unity of purpose.”212 Words, too, have power, in the form of
myths, stories, and narratives—or promises.

CHAPTER FOUR
A SPECIAL PROMISE TO THE INDIAN PEOPLE

Not long after his release in 1908 from years of imprisonment in Palestine,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá made an important statement, interpreted as a promise or a prophecy,
regarding all indigenous inhabitants of the Americas. In his “Tablet Addressed to the
Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada” (1916), ‘Abdu´l-Bahá said, “You must attach
great importance to the indigenous population of America. . . . Should these Indians be
educated and properly guided, there can be no doubt that through the Divine teachings
they will become so enlightened that the whole earth will be illumined.”213 Shoghi
Effendi reinforced his grandfather’s admonition with a reminder from his secretary to
adherents in an early Bahá’í newsletter:

> He [Shoghi Effendi] has always been very anxious to have the Indians taught and
> enlisted under the banner of the Faith, in view of the Master’s [Ábdul-Bahá’]
> remarkable statements about the possibilities of their future and that they
> represent the aboriginal American population. He attaches the greatest importance
> to teaching the original inhabitants of the Americas the Faith. 'Abdu'l-Bahá
> Himself has stated how great are their potentialities, and it is their right, and the
> duty of the non-Indian Bahá'ís, to see that they receive the Message of God for
> this Day.214

In a 1996 letter to the “Bahá’ís of the World,” the Universal House of Justice
reminded the “firmly rooted” indigenous Bahá’ís of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s promise to them,
urging them to “strive to make their own distinctive contribution” to the work of the Faith
and “through word and deed” to help those indigenous believers who were not yet so

firmly rooted to “progress along the path to their destiny.”215 The wife of Shoghi Effendi,
a Canadian who came to be known as Amatúl-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum and who also
served as a “Hand of the Cause” in her own right, traveled through 185 countries to “raise
the Divine call.”216 As an author, poetess, lecturer, and film producer, Rúhíyyih Khánum
“worked tirelessly for the realization of the oneness of humanity, focusing in particular
on the environment and indigenous cultures.”217

In “A Message to the Indians and Eskimo Bahá’ís of the Western Hemisphere,”
Rúhíyyih Khánum recalled her visits to the Diné, Hopi, and other tribes, promising them
that “the day will come when the Redman will study and know the history of his
people.”218 The white man has studied the Indians for many years, Rúhíyyih Khánum
said, collecting the Indians’ way of life and their “ornaments,” putting them in houses
“where thousands of people pay to enter and look at them.”219 Rúhíyyih Khánum
informed her indigenous audience that three calls had come to them—one each from the
Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—and reminded her readers that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said
to them during his 1912 visit to North America, “Your mission is unspeakably
glorious.”220 Rúhíyyih Khánum acknowledged the problems of poverty, injustice, and
lack of education among the indigenous tribes and stated that if they “could only see with
the eye of the spirit” they would see that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s promise “is like a rope” put in
the hand of a drowning person in deep water. If the indigenous peoples will only “hold

onto ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s promise,” it will pull them, their children, and their grandchildren
“out of the water to safety.”221 Non-Indian Bahá’ís took ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s injunction about
service to indigenous populations to heart as a justifiable reason to move onto or travel to
American Indian reservations, Canadian reserves, and South American indigenous
populations. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá urged all people to “take hold of the hands of the helpless and
deliver them out of their ignorance and basement and poverty” and to devote themselves
to the “service of the masses,” forgetting their own “worldly advantage” while working
only to “serve the general good.”222

Bahá’ís Arrive on the Navajo Reservation

The first Bahá’í home-front pioneers to the Diné, James Stone and Grace Dean,
arrived in Gallup, New Mexico, in 1957. Tony and Josie Madonia arrived next,
pioneering to Gallup in mid-1958 before moving to Ft. Defiance for Tony’s work as a
supervisor with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Amos and Mary Gibson, an
interracial couple also arriving in 1958 who taught in the government-run schools, lived
far out on the reservation. Two years later, in 1960, Tony Madonia died suddenly of a
heart attack, just six days after the formation of the first Local Spiritual Assembly (LSA)
of Ft. Defiance. The Navajo Tribal Chairman gave special permission to bury him in a
small cemetery between Window Rock and Ft. Defiance. Diné Leon Benally’s father
made the remark, “The Indians loved Tony because Tony loved the Indians.”223 Only

Dick and Mary Lou Wright with their two small children from Peoria, Illinois,
were among the earliest Bahá’í home-front pioneers to arrive in Gallup in 1958. The
Wrights occupied the Bahá’í Center, procured by James Stone in 1957, which had been
vacated by a departing pioneer. Mary Lou described it as an old storefront building with
high rent that quickly ate up their meager savings after Dick’s job with the government
vanished during a hiring freeze.225 Chester Kahn recalls meeting Stone after Chester
returned to the reservation from working at the Stewart Indian School outside Carson
City, Nevada. Chester had met a few Bahá’ís in Nevada in 1956 and related that he
thought they were a “different kind of white people” than he had ever known, respectful
of and interested in the Diné culture. Chester makes a clear connection between his
traditional way of life and the new Bahá’í teachings that he became familiar with from
the Bahá’í home-front pioneers when he shared his experience of becoming Bahá’í:

> I returned back to the reservation, and found out that there were Bahá’ís, some
> Bahá’ís, few, very few Bahá’ís in those days here on our reservation. One of the
> Bahá’ís was the first person I met here that lived in Gallup, New Mexico, was Jim
> Stone. He was a very beautiful Bahá’í and [there were] two or three other Bahá’ís
> in the area. Another couple that I met at that time, his name was Amos Gibson

Chester had met the Wrights at the Bahá’í Center in Gallup. The Wrights
partitioned the old storefront into small bedrooms with one larger room for meetings.
Mary Lou remembers that Navajo men came in from the reservation to the Bahá’í Center
to “take showers and get cleaned up from their dusty trip into town.”227 Word of mouth
had gotten around that they were not expected to give anything of themselves such as
attendance at religious services, or take anything in the form of gifts based on attendance;
the Center was there for them to use. The Wrights served as witnesses for the first Bahá’í
marriage performed in the Bahá’í Center, for Sayde Joe, the first Diné to convert to the
new religion. Before the Wrights left, moving due to health issues caused by Gallup’s
high altitude, they made sure the Center had other home-front pioneers to occupy it. An
elderly couple, Walter and Emma Jones from San Leandro, California, home-front
pioneered to Gallup, bought the Center, and deeded it back to the Bahá’ís of Gallup.228

The number of home-front pioneers on the Navajo reservation had reached twelve
by November, 1958, with four registered groups within the boundaries of the civil areas
that coincided with the electoral districts for the Navajo Tribal Council.229 Marilyn and
Floyd Heaton, school teachers, along with Peter Terry, who worked as a census clerk,
formed the Bahá’í group at Tuba City. James and Jean Ginnett, Roberta Wilson, and
Tony and Josie Madonia formed the group at Window Rock. Amos and Mary Gibson
with Sadye Joe formed the group at Pinon. Isabel and Hayward Camper formed the group
at Indian Wells. By April 21, 1959, there were enough Bahá’ís in Gallup to elect and

institute Gallup’s first Local Spiritual Assembly; the foundational nucleus of Bahá’í
administration.

The “Talking Leaves” newsletters of the mid-1950s, written by Nancy Phillips,
secretary of the American Indian Service Committee (AISC), and filled with fascinating
glimpses and vignettes of life on the reservation by arriving home-front pioneers,
document those early days of Bahá’í activity across reservations nation-wide.230 It was a
far-flung community of only thirty home-front pioneers in the entire “Indian teaching
field” by late 1958.231 Bahá’í pioneers found a different situation from the well-
established Catholic and Protestant institutions with their trained theologians and staffs
that had been on the reservations since the late 1800s. The Christian missionaries were
financially supported by their respective religious institutions and, in addition to having a
building for services, they were provided with a parish, mission, or parsonage to live in
plus a salary or stipend. The Bahá’í home-front pioneers were expected to fend entirely
for themselves and provide for their own needs. This often led to make-or-break
situations of too-short terms of service to fully establish well-developed native Bahá’í
communities that could survive on their own when the pioneers left the reservations.
Bahá’í pioneers came from a grassroots and individual-initiative perspective. Any Bahá’í
who had a goal of teaching American Indians the new religion was free to relocate to a
reservation. This, too, was different from Christian missionaries, who were directed to
their posts and were provided with prior training in the field. Home-front pioneers had to
support themselves financially, which meant choosing a location where jobs and housing
could be found—or creating one’s own job as Ted and Lynn Claus did.

\[230\] Phillips, “Talking Leaves,” AISC, Nov. 12, 1959 (Wilmette, IL: National Bahá’í Library). The phrase,
“talking leaves,” Phillips said, was taken from the Cherokee language for “pages of writing.”

The Clauses arrived in the fall of 1959 on the Navajo reservation to help establish
the first LSA at Window Rock before they moved on to Ft. Defiance. Ted Claus wrote to
the “Talking Leaves” newsletter,

While the home-front pioneers had the support and encouragement of Bahá’í
institutions on all administrative levels, each individual or family was expected to be self-
sufficient and independent. However, Bahá’ís who could not themselves “go pioneering”
but had the financial means to do so, could “deputize” others to go in their stead.233 The
National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States appointed the American
Indian Service Committee (AISC) in 1953 to support home-front pioneers with limited
training, advice, printed materials, planning and carrying out of activities, and traveling
speakers. Later, Area Teaching Committees (ATCs) composed of five to nine individuals
were appointed by the NSA. The small group of Bahá’ís appointed to the ATC for the

Pioneers “opening an area to the Faith” meant not only becoming an integrated member
of one’s local community, but it also meant “raising” a Local Spiritual Assembly of local
inhabitants who could be self-sufficient enough and “deepened” enough in the
administrative functions of the Faith to run their own religious affairs without the
pioneers.235

Bruce and Sandy Palmberg arrived on the reservation in 1969. Bruce worked as
a plant quarantine inspector at the Sanders agricultural inspection station. About three
months after arriving, the couple moved to the backyard of the trading post in Pine
Springs. Bruce said the Mormon trader needed people to keep an eye on the trading post
when the Mormon trader was gone. Two other Bahá’í pioneers had lived there previously.
Bruce said this couple had “lived in a manner that didn’t work” (in a traditional hogan).
Bruce’s idea was to assist the Diné to live in a more modern way, but he and Sandy
wanted to model modern living. Sandy remembered,

> We had forty to fifty Navajos come [to the Palmberg home]. Kids would come
> and turn on and off the electric lights and the water. At that time, only two or
> three Navajo families lived at Pine Springs. Johnny and Ruby Nelson were taught

> because of sheer overwhelming demands of the people. Their needs were
> tremendous for rides, medical care, buying groceries, hauling water.236

The Universal House of Justice had only been elected in 1963, seven years prior to the
Palmbergs arriving on the Navajo reservation in 1970. Resources of the new religion

were limited in members and funding. In addition, only members contribute to the Bahá’í
funds. Funds collected at the local level supported the local communities’ expenses, such
as a Bahá’í Center, children’s classes, library expenses, and sending contributions to the
national level. Individual or “isolated believers” such as the Palmbergs supported
themselves and their Bahá’í activities entirely by themselves. Bruce felt that the
information coming from the House of Justice statements deemphasized humanitarian
efforts because the “numbers [of Bahá’ís] were too small to have an impact on society.
We were in agreement; we just didn’t have the resources to deal with all the
problems.”237 Sandy addressed the need to “deepen,” or inform, the new Diné Bahá’ís
about their new teachings:

> We got the idea that Navajo Bahá’ís were not particularly deepened; we felt like
> we were supposed to do that. We would get asked, ‘Are you the Bahá’í
> missionaries? What are you going to give?’ Our standard answer was, ‘Nothing

> material goods. There was lots of jealousy between the Navajo Bahá’ís then, lots
> of alcoholism and peyote—it was stratified. Navajos didn’t like to associate, lots
> of “superstitions”.238

The Palmbergs related in their interview feeling discouraged and wanting to give up.
After the Palmbergs had moved their mobile home away from Pine Springs and really felt
like they had accomplished little, Bruce said they got a knock on the door:

> It was a positive thing when we finally moved the trailer. One day a nice-looking
> traditional lady knocked on the door and asked where were all the Bahá’ís? Alice
> Burnside, a Navajo Bahá’í. We thought we were beat up. Alice wanted us to come

Rúhíyyih Khánum wrote to the pioneers that there were two points to always keep
in mind; one was that pioneering should be done “for the sake of God” alone and that to

\[237\] Bruce Palmberg, interview.

do it for any other reason was to invite disappointment.240 Second, pioneers should teach
the new converts that their relationship was a direct one to Bahá’u’lláh as their own
messenger from God and that their connection to him was not through the pioneer. The
relationship new converts had established with “the Cause of God” was an independent
one. Rúhíyyih Khánum, known for her outspokenness and directness, likened the
pioneer’s position to that of a spiritual parent:

> It is really all remarkably like a family: the child grows up, begins to assert its
> freedom and the loving parents see it getting hurt and making mistakes which, if
> only it would listen, it would not happen! But the child will not always listen and
> the parents cannot live its life for it. The Bahá’í pioneer who is a spiritual parent
> must just resign himself to the same thing. . . . At least 80 per cent of everything
> that seems wrong in the beginning will sort itself out within say a year, if the
> pioneer will be patient, loving, understanding, and will persevere.241

In addition to finding one’s own home and job, adherents were explicitly
forbidden to proselytize, while at the same time teaching the faith was an important part
of “living the life” that defines being Bahá’í. Bahá’u’lláh exhorted his followers:

> If ye be aware of a certain truth, if ye possess a jewel, of which others are
> deprived, share it with them in a language of utmost kindliness and goodwill. If it
> be accepted, if it fulfills its purpose, your object is obtained. If anyone should
> refuse it, leave him unto himself, and beseech God to guide him. Beware lest ye
> deal unkindly with him.242

Thus, home-front pioneers had the challenge of how to share the new religion on the
Navajo reservation without proselytizing. In so doing, they had to befriend without
hypocrisy, to share their beliefs in such a way as not to infringe on the privacy or rights
of their Diné friends and neighbors or to offend the traditional customs of the Diné.243 A
good portion of the problem in maintaining their Local Spiritual Assemblies was the

difficulties of life on the reservation. Home-front pioneers moved elsewhere when
circumstances became too difficult due to finances, health, or other factors, leaving the
Diné Bahá’ís who were not deepened enough in their new religion to struggle with
becoming a Bahá’í on their own.

Pioneering Literature

The most important piece of training material for home-front pioneers to
reservations was the Teaching Brochure of the American Indian Service Committee,
published under the auspices of the National Spiritual Assembly sometime around 1952-
1953\.244 This simple manual, divided into sections by topic, is surprising in its scope and
depth of information. The brochure contains goals given to potential pioneers from the
National Assembly with directives from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi to support
those goals.245 The question and answer section covers a wide range of cultural, legal,
and religious topics. Another section encourages Bahá’í youth to live on or near
reservations and provides a breakdown of schools, colleges, and universities close to
Indian populations both on reservations and in urban areas.246 The final section gives a
thumbnail sketch of Indian tribes classified into “six main stalks” of Algonquin,
Athapascan, Iroquois, Muskogean, Shoshonean, and Sioux. Each tribe is grouped into a
cultural area, with the Navajos placed in the category of Athapascan shepherds of
northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and southeastern Utah. Listing the Diné

population at about 50,000 and increasing, the manual says that “these people possess
great adaptability and have absorbed elements from all the other cultures they have
encountered. Their crafts include weaving, silversmithing, and the famous
sandpainting.”247 The manual condenses the history of the Diné into six brief but fully
descriptive paragraphs. It concludes with the advice that potential home-front pioneers
should contact the Chamber of Commerce in the principal towns of Gallup and
Farmington, New Mexico, and Holbrook, Winslow, and Flagstaff, Arizona, to seek
possible employment. Other than teaching in a government school or agency,
employment “is impossible.”248

The next most important publication of teaching material was a booklet in the
Cherokee language (1954).249 The English version was published in 1955 under the title
of The New Day, and the 32-page Navajo version, Łahgo ‘Áhoot’ Éego Hanááhoolzhllzh,
with English translations, was published in 1956. Łahgo provided an introduction to the
new religion and excerpts from its writings. A note in the AISC’s November 12, 1958,
“Talking Leaves” newsletter said that Willie Morgan, who lived in Ft. Defiance,
translated the Bahá’í writings into Navajo.250 In addition, an Oneida version was
published at the same time as the Navajo version.251

however, archival material and interviews indicate that Sadye Joe was the first Diné

Flagstaff with one Diné Bahá’í and two home-front pioneers in Gallup with no Diné
Bahá’ís. Off-reservation Diné Bahá’ís were listed at two. AISC’s monthly “Talking
Leaves” newsletter began to be distributed sometime after 1953; library copies begin in
1958 and end in 1960. These early issues appear to be the most important and consistent
means of communication nation-wide among home-front pioneers to Indians, both on
reservations and in urban areas. Composed by Nancy Phillips, the secretary of the
American Indian Service Committee, her warm, welcoming, and supportive tone conveys
the image of good friends corresponding with each other. Issues give information about
arriving and departing pioneers, their activities, and who converted, where, and how,
notices of gatherings, and potential job openings that inadvertently provided a window
into the progress on the reservations:

> New schools now under construction on a number of Indian reservations are
> opening many more positions for school teachers. There are also abundant
> opportunities for employment on Indian reservations open to nurses and doctors.
> Bahá’ís who can qualify for such positions and who are interested in serving the

of Indian teaching activities between the last “Talking Leaves” newsletter in 1960 and the
next set of newsletters that began in the summer of 1963. Directed toward native

adherents and simply titled “Bahá’í Letter,” this newsletter, more formal in its format yet
simplistic in its wording and intended for adherents who may not read English well or
understand it, served as an instrument of instruction on the teachings and laws of the new
religion. The newsletter’s headings range from Bahá’í holy days to marriage laws and
understanding how the Bahá’í religious administration works. The “Flaming Arrow”
newsletter arrived in April, 1974, still instructive in content as was its predecessor but
more newsy, inclusive, and native-oriented in tone and subject. The American Indian
Service Committee changed its name to the American Indian Teaching Committee
(AITC), which boasted several native names on its roster of committee members. In
October, 1980, the monthly “A.I.T.C. News” replaced “Flaming Arrow” due to increased
expenses and time constraints and dropped its mailing to over 1,600 recipients. The
A.I.T.C. newsletter was distributed only to LSAs on reservations, certain District
Teaching Committees (DTCs), and those individuals closely involved with reservation
teaching.254
Home-front pioneers, taking the promise of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá into hand, moved onto
the Navajo reservation and established small communities across the reservation,
sometimes in isolated areas. Supporting themselves, the national “Bahá’í News” and
newsletters from the American Indian Teaching Service were the home-front pioneers’
primary means of information. After the creation of the Native American Bahá’í Institute
(NABI) at Burntwater near Pine Springs in 1977, the newsletters came under the

guidance and administration of NABI to reflect local activities, news from the national
and international levels, and the stages of growth both in the Institute and in the Diné
population on the Navajo reservation. The newsletters, along with other letters, flyers,
and instructive materials, provide an irreplaceable resource for the history of the Diné
who came into the Bahá’í Faith at a significant time in its history, as the first House of
Justice was elected.

CHAPTER FIVE
RELIGIOUS IMAGERY: ANCIENT NAVAJO CHANTS

The ancient Navajo chants, in their published form, came about through the
physical and spiritual adventures of Bahá’í Vinson Brown (see Appendix C-5).
According to Brown’s wife Barbara, she and Vinson met Diné Bahá’ís Chester and Annie
Kahn at the Great Council Fire Unity Conference in 1962.255 Annie shared with Vinson
the story of the eschatological oral chants that her grandfather had passed down to her.
The chants give prophecies of a chief coming to the Diné from the east wearing twelve
feathers and tell the Diné to look for the number nine, among other signs of an
eschatological nature embedded within Diné traditions and cosmology. Brown, an
anthropologist and natural historian, traveled in Asia, Central America, and North
America visiting indigenous tribes and studying their thoughts, dreams, and customs.256

Brown was five years old when his father showed him a beautifully beaded
doeskin bag about four feet long in “glowing” colors of red, blue, gold, white, and
green.257 Brown’s father, a physician in the 1890s on the Sioux reservation, was gifted
the bag by an Oglala Sioux chief whose small son had been near death from pneumonia.
Brown’s father worked on the child for two days and nights, finally in desperation
blowing his own breath into the child before collapsing. The son survived and the doctor
refused to take any payment from the chief, saying that the white man had taken too
much from the Indians already and so he gave the child’s life back to his father without

charge. The chief, too proud to take something for nothing, told his wife to bring out the
bag and insisted on giving it to the doctor to show his gratitude.258

Brown retells the story his father told him of how the bag had been thrown on a
great pile of Indian things gathered by white soldiers and the whole pile set afire
intending to crush the Indians’ spirit. A wind came and blew the bag off the pile to a
place where the Indians found it. Brown’s surprised father asked the chief why he would
give him such a valuable bag. The chief said that “in a dream he had been told to give it
to the first white man who did something kind for his family because someday giving this
bag would bring good to the Indians.”259 After Brown’s father showed him the bag and
told him its story, saying that one day the bag would belong to him, Brown began to have
a repeating dream of despair and renewal among indigenous people. The dream stopped
suddenly after he visited a destitute Shoshone reservation when he was nine years old.260

Later in his life, Brown’s dream was interpreted for him by an Otomi/Olmec
Indian from central Mexico who introduced Brown to the prophecy of “Quetzalcoatl, the
Feathered Serpent,” which provided a link to the Bahá’í Faith.261 Brown established
Naturegraph Publishing in 1946, specializing in American Indian stories, prophecies, and
natural phenomena. In1962 Naturegraph published Warriors of the Rainbow: Strange
and Prophetic Dreams of the Indian People followed in 1963 by Four Remarkable
Indian Prophecies as a “capstone or conclusion” to Warriors of the Rainbow.262 Brown
wrote that these four prophecies were “somehow missed” in his research for Warriors of

the Rainbow but that they were “discovered” and given to Naturegraph “by the authors
under whose name each prophecy appears.”263 Brown explains that Naturegraph “had
felt the lack” of a conclusion for Warriors but found themselves “unable to remedy” it
until these prophecies came to light. Brown asserted,

> Basically these four prophecies give us two essential bits of information that were
> missing in the Warriors book. They show that the psychic knowledge of the great
> Indian Holy Men of the days before the white conquest went far deeper than just a
> premonition of a great spiritual event that was to appear and regenerate their
> people, that sometimes their spiritual insight gave them knowledge of actual dates
> and actual signs by which the new Light of the Great Being could be recognized.
> This is exactly what the following prophecies do and in such a way so conclusive
> and so inspiring that only those blinded by prejudice will fail to seek carefully and
> with open minds for the evidences of a New Revelation and a New Day.264

Annie Kahn’s “Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants” was one of the four
“discovered” prophecies. A year later Brown reproduced his own version of Annie’s
interpretations as a rhythmic chant in Songs of the New Dawn.265 Perhaps, over many
years and after numerous publications for, about, and by Native Americans, Brown’s
establishment of Naturegraph could be seen as fulfilling the dream of the chief, which
said something good would come to the Indians following the gifting of the pipe bag to
Brown’s father.

Annie Kahn’s Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants

Diné Bahá’í Annie Kahn was one of the organizers of the Great Council Fire Unity
Conference at Pine Springs in 1962. As stated earlier, Brown says that Annie learned
these “wonderful chants from her grandfather and the old medicine men” of the Navajo

nation.266 Although Annie’s interpretation of these Navajo chants was published by
Naturegraph a year after the Great Council Fire Unity Conference, no doubt the chants
were a well-known sacred oral tradition in Diné culture that most adult Diné were
familiar with prior to its being published. Annie’s interpretation of the Navajo chants,
written down together as one narrative, established a link with the Bahá’í Faith through
two prophecies of a nine-pointed star and a chief with twelve feathers who would come
from the east. The Diné chants contains powerful images of a restored universe and
serves as the second eschatological narrative, in addition to the first eschatological
narrative of the return of the Warrior Twins, which directly or indirectly influenced some
Diné to accept the new religion. Annie first wrote down the oral prophecies of the chants
that were handed down to her by her grandfather and then adds her own interpretation at
the end of each chant in light of her becoming Bahá’í. Written in the flowing style of
Navajo speech, the message of the nine chants gives a clear picture of Diné Bahá’í
eschatological expectations and fulfillment (see Appendix B).267

First Sign: The Nine-Pointed Star

Nine is an important number in Diné ceremonies because there are usually nine
sets of nine songs or nine prayer chants conducted by the Diné singer leading the
ceremony.268 Some of the longer chants, such as in the Holy Way chants, take nine

nights to complete.269 In addition, the Diné hogan is an eight-sided log house used for
daily life, ceremonies, and prayer, but according to Diné prophecy, people will pray in
nine-sided houses in the future.270 Annie writes that the seventh chant stipulates that a
nine-pointed star “must come from the east” and that its points symbolize completeness
and the “love and unity of all religions, races, and nations.”271 She then explains that
“nine is the sign of the highest unity” because “all the numbers can be found in this one
number.”272 One of the three religious symbols of the Bahá’í Faith is the nine-pointed
star. The Persian Bahá’í scholar Abu’l-Qásim Faizí wrote a brief history on the number
nine within the Bahá’í Faith and gave several reasons for its significance: first, the Arabic
alphabet represents numbers by attaching a numerical value to words.273 In the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh identifies the numerical value of Bahá as nine.274 Bahá is the root
word for Bahá’í, Bahá’u’lláh, and Allah-u-Abhá (God the Most Glorious), which is used
as a greeting between Bahá’ís.275 Second, Faizi said that “the Báb sent a tablet to
Bahá’u’lláh with 360 derivatives of the word Bahá,” which “fulfilled the Islamic
tradition” that the “Promised One” would reveal “the hundredth name of God—the
“Qur´an contains ninety-nine names of God.”276 Third, other derivatives of nine, such as
the Báb’s disciples, known as the “Eighteen Letters of the Living,” the nine doors found
in all nine-sided Bahá’í temples, and the number of nine elected members serving on

each Bahá’í religious institution are testimonial to the significance of nine in the Faith.277

Faizí writes that “nine is the perfect number—it is on top of the ladder of numerical
progressive elevation and is very mysterious, full of special qualities and potencies.”278

Such a convergence between an important Bahá’í religious symbol and the Diné
prophecies in the Navajo chants concerning the appearance of a nine-pointed star, along
with the racial and religious unity demonstrated at the Great Council Fire Unity
Conference among its thousand-plus attendees from around the world, supported the
chants’ prophecy that “all races and religions will come together in unity under the sign
of the nine-pointed star” and served as significant precursors of conversion for Diné
Bahá’ís. In addition to those Diné who recognized or acknowledged the return of their
eschatological Warrior Twins in the forms of the Twin Messengers of the Bahá’í Faith,
the presence of the nine-pointed star as a Bahá’í religious symbol served as a strong
indication and catalyst for those Diné who became Bahá’ís at the Great Council Fire
Unity Conference.

Second Sign: The Chief with Twelve Feathers

The second sign, prominent in the seventh Navajo chant, instruct the Diné to look
for a “great chief with twelve feathers,” or twelve teachings that will bring “peace and
unity.”279 Annie interprets the great chief as Bahá’u’lláh, although throughout her
interpretation of the chants she only alludes to the new religion, without actually naming
it. Annie says that “if we search carefully we will find that these twelve principles of

world unity have already come to the world and, even in this day, are beginning to bring
people together in unity, understanding and love.”280 Sandner writes that the number
twelve has a “special significance for holiness and completion” in Diné cosmology.281 He
refers to a “very holy” sandpainting with a “special blessing” that is taken from the
Blessing Way and depicts the “Twelve Holy People” in twelve panels, with each panel
representing a principal power: yellow Earth, blue Sky, black Darkness, white Dawn,
yellow sunlight, Sun, Talking God, Calling God, Male Corn, Female Corn, Corn Beatle
Girl, and Pollen Boy.282 In addition, Sandner notes there are twelve-word formulas
connected with the chants that are “very sacred and not often recorded.”283 Renowned
sandpainter and Otomi/Olmec Bahá’í David Villaseñor (see Appendix C-4), when
explaining the design of the “twelve sacred laws” incorporated into the Seed Blessing
Way Chant in Tapestries in Sand: The Spirit of Indian Sandpainting, notes, “It is
interesting that Christ had twelve disciples, the Sun has twelve signs of the Zodiac, there
were twelve tribes of Israel, there are twelve months of the Christian calendar, and that
the Bahá’í Dispensation, as revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, has twelve great principles.”284 As a
whole, the Diné Bahá’ís I interviewed accepted the twelve basic social and spiritual
principles instituted by Bahá’u’lláh as symbolic of the twelve eagle feathers on the
headdress of the Great Chief in the seventh chant.

In the eighth chant, titled the “Unity Chant” as opposed to the other chants, which
are simply designated as “the chants,” multiple symbolisms of glory within the Bahá’í

principles as 12, but they appear this way in many descriptions of his teachings.

writings and within Bahá’u’lláh’s name serve to connect him to the “Great One.”285 In
the Unity Chant, “the Great One” will “come like the dawn” and “gather His flock,”
bringing all the wandering sheep back together again. There are multi-layered symbolic
images in the Unity Chant that relate to the sheep-herding economy of the Diné, their
need to find wide-ranging pastures, and their lifestyle with its belief system of the
importance of dawn-time. Diné Bahá’í Linda Wilson relates how her mother taught her
and her siblings to pray at dawn-time:

> So my mother would say, “When you say the early prayers, early morning, you’re
> connecting yourself with the relatives in the next life and you’re connecting with
> a life in this life. Not only are you connecting with the plant life, the earth,
> anything of mineral. You’re connecting yourself with the animal life and even in
> the other worlds.” So those prayers would be said, like four o’clock [a.m.] and
> during that time she said that it’s the most purest air of this earth and of the
> universe connected together. That’s why we say it. So she said, “When barely
> four o’clock, you see the morning star coming out, barely you put your corn
> pollen to the earth and you reach out as far around you as you can.” And she was
> saying, “Not only are you saying a prayer for yourself, you’re saying a prayer for
> the whole people. . . . She stood right by me and as I say mine. She had all her
> children line up beside her and she says her prayer, we say right along with her,
> “And this is for the people who are suffering. They don’t know us, they don’t
> know you, but you have to say a prayer for them. These are the instructions of the
> Holy People that came. These are the reasons why we say the prayers.”286

Similar symbolic images are found in Bahá’í prayers: “I have risen from my couch at this
dawntide when the Daystar of Thy oneness hath shone forth from the Dayspring of Thy
will, and hath shed its radiance upon the whole world, according to what had been
ordained in the books of Thy Decree.”287 Bahá’u’lláh enjoined his followers to attend
dawn prayers in the nine-sided Bahá’í temples or Houses of Worship, titled the
“Mashriqu’l-Adhkar,” or “Dawning Place of the Mention of God,” at the “hour of dawn,”

\[285\] Kahn, “Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants,” 6. This appears to be the only chant designated as the
“Unity Chant,” upper-cased, with all the other “chants” lower-cased, which sets it apart. See fn. 39.

\[287\] Bahá’í Prayers, “Morning,” 122.

although “any time from the earliest dawn of day, between dawn and sunrise, or even up
to two hours after sunrise” is acceptable.288

Two more feather principles are specifically noted in the fourth chant and the
eighth chant that served as part of the catalyst for conversion.

Feather Principle: Removal of Prejudices. Annie describes the coming of the
“New Day” (new religion) in the fourth chant as akin to “the birth of a new baby.”289 The
new religion is clean and fresh in the same way that a new baby is because the new
religion has “none of the prejudices and misunderstandings that the older religions have
accumulated down through the centuries.”290 Elimination of prejudices from a Bahá’í
standpoint applies to racial, religious, social, and economic prejudices. Part of Diné
Bahá’í Johnny Nelson’s delight in the new religion was the encouragement from the
Bahá’ís attending the Great Council Fire Unity Conference not only to keep, but to use
his corn pollen, sacred to him and to those with whom he conducts ceremonies in his
capacity as a medicine man. In his interview, Nelson speaks with carefulness about some
religious prejudice from the Christian community on the reservation experienced by
himself and his friend, Diné Bahá’í medicine man, Jacky Wilson. Wilson, who walks
with difficulty, had his daughter bring him to Nelson’s hogan when he learned an
interview was taking place. Nelson remembers what they were told at the Great Council
Fire Unity Conference:

> And a lot of these Christianity, they have said to, said to us that you, you really
> need to, ahm, discard all your belongings and paraphernalia, burn it. But Bahá’ís,
> they say, keep it. And pray with it. And keep your language, tradition and culture.

\[289\] Kahn, “Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants,” 3.

\[290\] Ibid, “Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants,” 3-4.

It’s very, very good, and he [Jacky Wilson] accepted in that way. And prayers, he
still keeps going with it, and chants. It is one.291

Nelson remembered home-front pioneer Amos Gibson “coming around” to tell Johnny
and his family about the new religion prior to the Council Fire. Gibson, an African
American with Native American heritage, was one of the first home-front pioneers to the
Navajo reservation (see Appendix C-5). Dick and Mary Wright were home-front pioneers
contemporary with the Gibsons. I asked Mary Wright if it was unusual to see an African
American on the Navajo reservation and if the Diné displayed any prejudice towards him
or his white wife:

> There wasn’t that many [African Americans] in the Gallup and Reno areas, when
> I stop to think about it. As far as I know there were no prejudices. There was no
> prejudice toward them, I don’t think. He did well. He was well-liked and well-
> respected and he taught in a couple different places. Fort Defiance and
> Lukachukai, those two places I know for sure where he taught school and he did
> fine. And Mary, his wife, they both taught school.292

The Diné Bahá’ís knew that the home-front pioneers had come from a variety of
previous religious backgrounds, and they observed the racial differences among the
Bahá’ís both prior to and at the Great Council Fire Unity Conference (see Appendix C- 5,
10 and 11). Gibson and the other home-front pioneers served as examples of both
religious and racial unity that fulfilled the prophecies in the second and fourth chants,
which demonstrated a religious and racial unity that Annie interpreted as “clean and
fresh” of old prejudices while practicing the “true love” that the Holy Medicine Men had
said in the chants that would come at “the time of the end.”293

Feather Principle: Oneness. In the second chant Annie quotes one of the “Holy
Medicine Men” who said that the “Time of the End” is like two stages: one stage is that

\[291\] Nelson and Wilson, interview.

\[292\] Wright, interview by author.

\[293\] Kahn, “Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants,” 2-3.

the “Spirit of the People” shall live again, and the second stage is that “people shall melt
into one,” meaning, Annie writes, that “true love” between people will be practiced.
Annie affirms in the third chant that the “love of the Great Spirit and of mankind that
comes in the New Day is so great that all the world’s afflictions and its dangers can in no
way harm us.”294 The new spiritual and social laws, laid down in the Bahá’í covenants
and instituted through its administrations, call for a world-wide federal system that unites
all nations, races, creeds, and classes and safeguards the autonomy, personal freedoms,
and initiatives of all people—the “melting” that may allow the ancient chants’ “true love”
among people to be practiced. I argue that the chants’ prediction of “true love practiced
between people” has become evident at NABI since its founding, evident between the
significant numbers of non-Diné Bahá’ís who have come to NABI from around the
country (and the world) to provide voluntary services to the Diné, both Bahá’í and non-
Bahá’í. I also argue that the long years of sociological and economic deprivations
suffered by the Diné, along with the prophecies of the ancient chants and the Warrior
Twins, prepared the “ground” of the Diné spirit for what they experienced as the
comforting Bahá’í message of acceptance, acknowledgement, and spiritual renewal so
familiar to the Diné from their oral traditions contained within these eschatological
narratives.

Beauty as Equality. The eighth chant or Unity Chant also refers to the Beauty
Way Chant, and says that “in the Day of Unity, you will walk in beauty; the beauty will
walk before you; the beauty will walk behind you; you will be surrounded by beauty.”295

\[294\] Kahn, “Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants,” 3.

\[295\] Ibid., “Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants,” 6.

The Diné philosophy of hozho, or walking in beauty and harmony, Sa'ah naaghi Bik'e
Hozho, with a balanced mutual respect among human beings, also matches up with the
Bahá’í principle of equality between women and men. Diné Bahá’ís recognize the Bahá’í
principle of equality between women and men as another expression of the Beauty Way
Chant and as another validation of their own matrilineal and matrilocal culture expressed
in the new religion’s teachings, which added another impetus to the becoming Bahá’í
process. Alfred Kahn, Jr. speaks with a passion when he combines his understandings of
walking in beauty with the ideals of Bahá’í prayer, serving others, the principle of gender
equality, and the status of Diné women:

It seems like on the Navajo reservation, there is an understanding that every
> person has a responsibility to make everything in their world better. It has to do
> with prayer. I think for a Navajo person everything is prayer. You walk in beauty.
> Everything you do has to do with a spiritual reality. All your actions have a
> consequence. So if you make good decisions your whole life, you can affect the
> world positively. Navajos understand that. Hum, you turn to a medicine man;
> sometimes they have this vision, this understanding. They have a gift for healing,
> but anybody can be a medicine man. You train, you learn it, you know. Everyone
> has a capacity to serve and to attain. Nobody can say that they are special.
> Everyone has the capacity to become what they want to be, choose to be.
> I think even [non-Diné] women have an understanding of Navajo that is distorted
> because I don’t think western society can understand matriarchal society. Like
> women have almost a higher station than men. Men serve women and women
> make decisions. Women inherited, the land was passed down in their name.
> Everything went through the women and men were servants. Men worked and
> respected women. So there is that connection with the Bahá’í Faith, you know.296
The religious imagery of beauty language that Annie conveys in the Navajo chants
connects with the beauty language found in the Bahá’í writings. Annie writes that “again
in another place in the chants He [the Great One] says that those who speak with
beautiful speech will lead the world to beauty and He says the center of this beautiful

\[296\] Alfred Kahn, Jr., interview.

speech comes from a Holy Mountain.”297 Annie identifies the holy mountain as Mt.

Carmel in Haifa, Israel, now covered with expansive and beautiful gardens at the site of
the Bahá’í World Centre, and asks, “Is this not the most holy mountain in the world?”298
Annie connects the Bahá’í gardens on Mt. Carmel with the prophecy of Isaiah 35:1-2,
and says, “This is closely linked with the Promised Day of the New Spirit when ‘the
desert shall rejoice, and blossom like the rose.’”299 Annie explains that from Mt. Carmel
“we are beginning to hear the Message of Beauty and of the Spirit that is awakening the
World.”300

An electronic resource library of the world’s religious literature uses a “unique
book-centered research engine” called Ocean, which houses 171 authorative Bahá’í
documents.301 A survey of Ocean returned 1,899 sentences that employed the word
beauty. In one document, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to the “beauty of unity,” the “Spiritual
beauty [a reference to Christ],” the “beauty of the Kingdom [of God],” the “beauty of the
oneness of humanity, of love, and of brotherhood,” and the “beauty of a real union
[marriage].”302 In another document, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to nature reflected in “the
perfect majesty and beauty of a tree,” and trees as “adorned with utmost beauty and
perfection” to demonstrate spiritual ideals and values.303 Samples from a variety of

documents on Ocean show titles of Bahá’u’lláh as “the Divine Beauty,” the “Abhá
Beauty,” the “Blessed Beauty,” and the “Ancient Beauty.” Bahá’u’lláh also refers to
other divine messengers in terms of beauty: “recognizing the beauty of Jesus,” the
“everlasting Beauty [Muhammad],” and “by their countenance the Beauty of God is
revealed.”304 Many terms of beauty refer to God in these documents, and Bahá’u’lláh
often referred to his own revelation in terms of beauty: “recognizing the beauty of the
Best Beloved;” “thou disbelieved in my Beauty and turned away from My Self;” “when
the day star of my beauty is set [reference to his death];” and “Observe My
commandments for the love of My beauty.”305

Such a multitude of conversive religious images within the Bahá’í writings
connect the Diné’s practice of beauty language with the tangible proof of beauty found in
the Bahá’í gardens that blanket the formerly barren slopes of Mt. Carmel. These
conversive religious images may also fit Catherine Bell’s idea of practice, which is
“descriptive of human nature and all human activity” as a way to be more “prescriptive in
action.”306 I argue that the term “descriptive” paints a picture in words of what and how
humans do, act, and be. “Prescriptive” prescribes an action, which can be a prescription
for a means of correction to remove imperfections, to create balance and harmony, and to
bring about a healing for whatever ails an individual or a culture. In the eighth chant,
Annie demonstrates that the Diné concept of walking in beauty is a prescriptive act:

> In the Day of Unity you will walk in beauty; the beauty will walk before you; the
> beauty will walk behind you; you will be surrounded by beauty. Through the
> beautiful writings of a new Prophet of God, these meanings will become very
> clear. Man himself in this New Age has found ways to create beauty. With all

these beautiful things we must now have beautiful minds. With beautiful minds
we will talk in beauty. The speech of all men will be in beauty.307
Annie Kahn became more prescriptive in action, for herself, her family, and her culture,
when she made the choice to interpret ancient prophecies of her Diné ancestors by
writing down the chants, following her decision to become Bahá’í. Bell redefines practice
in her own terms as a redemptive hegemony, which includes the ability to reproduce or
reconfigure a vision of the order of power in the world.308 Clearly, Annie saw her
worldview and those of her family and relatives as reconfigured by their
acknowledgement and acceptance of the Bahá’í Faith—a worldview that gave Annie the
power to interpret the Navajo chants as a redemptive hegemony for herself and her Diné
culture.

CHAPTER SIX
BAHÁ’Í INSTITUTIONS: EXAMINING THE RELIGIOUS MATRIX

The Bahá’í Faith, like all religions, does not occur in a physical vacuum. Each
religion must have both physical matrices, such as churches, temples, schools, and other
institutions, and non-physical matrices composed of speaking and acting behaviors or
activities such as social events, committee meetings, devotional meetings, and
instructional classes that take place within those physical structures. In the Bahá’í Faith, a
structure called the House of Worship, or Mashriqu’l-Adhkar in Arabic, is situated on
each continent.309 Bahá’ís do not build “churches,” but communities in most
metropolitan centers have enough members to support a Bahá’í Center, which may be a
rented or owned facility, sometimes a renovated home, business, or small school. I
examine several aspects of the Bahá’í Faith in this chapter that I define as part of the
Diné Bahá’í matrix, including a prayer hogan, the Native American Bahá’í Institute, and
the community Feast, which is a designated time for spiritual reflection, taking care of
business, and socializing common to Bahá’ís everywhere.

Rambo writes that the “process of religious change takes place in a dynamic force
of people, events, ideologies, institutions, expectations, and orientations.”310 Rambo
defines religious institutions as the matrix or womb in which the process of change in
belief and behavior is given form on all levels of religious human activity.311 I use the
term religious matrix to define those womb-like institutions of development and growth
that gave birth to the Bahá’í administrative structure. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used the developing

\[309\] “Houses of Worship,” http://www.bahai.us/bahai-temple (accessed July 20, 2010).

embryo in the matrix of its mother’s womb to metaphorically explain different aspects of
physical creation and spiritual creation:

> In the matrix of the mother we were the recipients of endowments and blessings
> of God, yet these were as nothing compared to the powers and graces bestowed
> upon us after birth into this human world. Likewise if we are born from the matrix
> of this physical and phenomenal environment into the freedom and loftiness of the
> life and vision spiritual, we shall consider this mortal existence and its blessings
> as worthless by comparison.312

Bahá’u’lláh laid the foundations for the future Bahá’í Administrative Order in the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas (Book of Laws), and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá later confirmed the “supreme institutions” of
the Guardianship of the Cause and of the Universal House of Justice with the “authority
and guarantee of divine guidance decreed by Bahá’u’lláh for the Universal House of
Justice on all matters which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book.”313 Shoghi
Effendi referred to the institution of the Guardianship and the institution of the Universal
House of Justice as the “Twin Successors” of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.314 Shoghi
Effendi, addressing the “community of the believers of the North American continent, at
once the prime mover and pattern of the future communities,” refers to the “Golden Age”
of the religion in the far future when the religion has reached its full potential:

> What mysteries could ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have contemplated except the mysteries of
> that embryonic World Order now evolving within the matrix of His
> Administration? What righteousness if not the righteousness whose reign that Age
> and that Order can alone establish? What freedom but the freedom which the
> proclamation of His sovereignty in the fullness of time must bestow? 315

The religious institutions established on the Navajo reservation are a function of the
Bahá’í Administrative Order, and this chapter examines the dynamics of change and
belief for those Diné Bahá’ís within those institutions.

As discussed previously in chapter two on the history of the religion, the Universal
House of Justice had not yet been established in 1962, when the Great Council Fire Unity
Conference was held at Pine Springs. The Bahá’í Faith, while developing on a worldwide
scale, was still organizing as a new religion. Based on the grassroots initiatives of its
members who follow the structural plan for divinely ordained local institutions as
outlined by Bahá’u’lláh and set in motion by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the religion’s Local Spiritual
Assemblies adhere to their local governmental civil boundaries for their areas of
jurisdiction. Spiritual Assemblies, forerunners of future Houses of Justice, are authorized
to supervise the publishing of literature, instigate teaching programs, and oversee
devotional services at both the local level and the national levels.316 Starting at the local
level, individual Bahá’ís become “registered groups” when two or more members reside
in a defined civil area of a county or township. A Local Spiritual Assembly is elected
when there are nine adult Bahá’ís in a civil area who are age twenty-one or over. When
there are enough Local Spiritual Assemblies in a country to support a national institution,
representative delegates elect the country’s National Spiritual Assembly. As discussed
previously, the first international convention was held in 1963 to elect the Universal
House of Justice for the first time.317 The “Administrative Order,” encapsulated within
the laws and institutions of the religion, corresponds to the “Most Great Peace” of its

\[316\] Hatcher and Martin, Bahá’í Faith, 59.

\[317\] Ibid., Bahá’í Faith, 59, 64, 66-67.

Greater Covenant, which contains a “pattern for a future society that will bring about the
unification of the world.”318

The Bahá’í matrix of the administrative order included the Diné as needed and
respected members of a world community while advocating that each Diné can find truth
for oneself through the principle of independent investigation of truth. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
referred to it as the first principle: “The first is the independent investigation of truth; for
blind imitation of the past will stunt the mind. But once every soul inquireth into truth,
society will be freed from the darkness of continually repeating the past.”319 This
principle alone was especially empowering and appealing to Diné Bahá’ís. Such positive
reinforcement of independence of choice and action addressed the Diné’s need for
autonomy in light of their history, when choices were denied them, especially in the
arenas of self-governance and education of their children. Self-governance extended into
the clergyless administrative realm. Local Spiritual Assemblies function on the Bahá’í
principle of consultation, in which all elected members have an equal voice in overseeing
the affairs of their individual religious communities while learning how to apply the
Faith’s universal principles and guidelines. The Diné Bahá’ís witnessed their much-loved
home-front pioneer Amos Gibson’s election to their National Spiritual Assembly in 1960,
followed in 1963 by his election to the first Universal House of Justice.320 Without doubt,
even more validating to the Diné Bahá’ís was the election of two Kahn brothers to the
NSA of the United States. Franklin Kahn was elected in a by-election in November 1968
and served until April 1981(see Appendix C-2; Appendix E-1 and 7). Chester Kahn was

also elected in a by-election in 1982 and served until 1989 (see Appendix C-2; Appendix
E-2). These two Diné Bahá’ís were the first American Indians to serve on the national
governing body of the new religion, while numbers of their relatives and Diné friends
served in other local and regional administrative positions.

Local Spiritual Assemblies as an Administrative Matrix

It was not enough for Diné Bahá’ís to know the oral stories of the Warrior Twins
and the Unity Chant and to believe that they had been fulfilled by the coming of the
Bahá’í Faith to the Navajo reservation. Chester Kahn remembered that few Diné Bahá’ís
were “deepened” enough in the 1960s and 1970s to manage their own Local Assemblies
after the Assemblies were formed. The task of becoming deepened falls to every Bahá’í
to gain knowledge about their religion’s history and its institutions and purposes, and
learn how to implement its teachings in order to “live the life” that designates a spiritual
rejuvenation through perseverance and commitment.321 Deepening requires not only the
proper spirit, concentration, and meditation, but also requires the personal discipline and
effort needed to devote the time, attention, and care necessary to “unravel the meanings
which lie enshrined in the Revealed Word—deepening is like a skill or art which must be
acquired through effort.”322 Chester lived in Flagstaff at that time and the distances
between Diné Bahá’í believers were a great barrier to carrying on the deepening work:

> And we lost a lot of our people who were interested because we lived so far apart.
> We don’t live in villages just to see one person. We had to drive a hundred, two
> hundred miles to see them, to see that person and so forth and this was the
> problem. How difficult the deepening process was in light of the vastness of the

reservation. And so, this was to say, is to say that this was the beginning of the
Bahá’í Faith here on the Navajo Nation.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Kahn says, they had formed some Local Spiritual
Assemblies “here and there at the Chapter level . . . but there again,”

> Very few were deepened, not all of them, ah, so it [the deepening process] went

In the early years of the religion on the reservation, with few roads and fewer
telephones, it was difficult to get Diné Bahá’ís together for the election of their Local
Spiritual Assembly. The Palmbergs recalled their struggle to oversee elections that are
held every year worldwide on April 21, the first day of Ridvan. Sandy Palmberg explains,

> Somebody gave Evangeline Kahn a list of people who were Bahá’ís, and she’d
> find out if they were still Bahá’ís. Those who said ‘no’ were crossed off the list.

to the difficulties in getting Diné Bahá’ís to vote:

> depended on where the grass was at. Winter time, they moved close to the trading

Consultation as a Religious Matrix. Local Spiritual Assemblies function on the
Bahá’í principle of “consultation,” the highest form of conversive or verbal
communication and the underlying requisite of community life, in which all members,
even children, can have an equal voice in the affairs of the religious community.326
Having an equal voice means more than just voicing one’s opinion. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ gently
admonished members of local and national assemblies to enter their meetings with
“absolute love for each other” and free from estrangement, for all are “the waves of one
sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven.”327 Members are to proceed with
courtesy, dignity, care, and moderation to search out the truth through free and full
expression of their views. Each is encouraged to disclose his or her thoughts, and if a
difference of opinion arises in the assembly, the majority of voices “must prevail.”328
John Kolstoe describes consultation as the “bedrock of a Bahá’í community,” which
allows “both a means of jointly considering something and a means of allowing an idea
to grow”:

> There is a unique blend of experiences, knowledge, minds, hearts, feelings, hopes
> and fears. In a condition of suspended judgment these combine to allow the
> development of an idea, a transformation comes about when there is a sincere
> exchange. Generally the final result is quite different from either the original
> thought or any of the specific additional contributions. It is neither a compromise
> nor the simple addition of one thought to another; it is a new creation.329

Diné Bahá’ís feel more comfortable and familiar with the process of consultation
as a natural outgrowth of their own indigenous ways of time-honored reflective and
paced oral communications than do their non-native counterparts. We have seen

examples of this reflective process in the Diné interviews, where the pauses and ahmms
form an integral part of their speech and lend emphasis to listening deeply. Being
interrupted while one is talking conveys the highest form of rudeness and disrespect in
Diné culture. Consultation in a mixed community, with non-native Bahá’ís who most
likely did not have the same inflection in speech or the same cultural injunction against
interruptions, surely was challenging for both sides. Professor of English and native-
heritage Bahá’í Susan Berry Brill de Ramírez writes,

> Within the framework of cultures in which most forms of communication are
> elicited and responded to fairly quickly at the levels of mind and passions, the
> much slower-paced and contemplative mode of conversive consultation, common
> among past cultures, is now distanced from our view and eludes our conceptual

> that involves both mind and heart, thereby avoiding the divides that result in the
> extremes of unfeeling reason or uncontrolled emotion. This process that, for a
> literate world, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá need to declare and reiterate and
> explain again and again was part of the fabric of everyday life in oral cultures.330

De Ramirez defines conversive communication as a “collaborative,
intersubjective, and relational co-creative articulation” with the transformative power to
“bring diverse people and elements of the world together” through the “unifying power of
deep, interpersonal connections” that require the engagement of hearts and spirits along
with minds and senses to become “interactive speakers and listeners.”331 Based on the
Bahá’í principle of consultation included in The Sacred Tree: Reflections on Native
American Spirituality, the authors, who are both native and Bahá’í, describe the process
of conversive communication in a way readily understandable by indigenous people
everywhere:

> Respect the wisdom of the people in council. Once you give an idea to a council
> or a meeting it no longer belongs to you. It belongs to the people. Respect

demands that you listen intently to the idea of others in council and that you do
> not insist that your idea prevail. Indeed you should freely support the ideas of
> others, if they are true and good, even if those ideas are quite different from the
> ones you have contributed. The clash of ideas brings forth the spark of truth. . . .
> Once a council has decided something in unity, respect demands that no one
> speak secretly against what has been decided. If the council has made an error,
> that error will become apparent to everyone in its own time.332

Consultation among the local Diné Bahá’ís, their home-front pioneers, and the
institutions at the national level laid the foundation for the native-based Bahá’í institute
on the Navajo reservation. It was through the consultative process of conversive
communication that the Native American Bahá’í Institute came into being and developed,
and through the injunction to “respect the wisdom of the people in council” that those
Diné Bahá’ís who were “deepened,” although not always in agreement, complied with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s injunction to support the majority of voices.333

The Native American Bahá’í Institute as Religious Matrix

The Native American Bahá’í Institute (NABI), located in a high corner of the
reservation, down an isolated sand-covered and partially paved asphalt road lined with
scrubby cedars, pinion-junipers, and cacti, serves 16,000 of the 24,000 square miles of
the Navajo reservation (see Appendix D-1 and 2). Included are 110 Navajo and five Hopi
communities in Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico, with twelve non-native communities
immediately adjacent to the Navajo nation sometimes served by NABI activities.334
Metropolitan cities are hundreds of miles away. A reliable telephone and internet service
has been slow to arrive in this corner of the reservation. Although there are indigenous
Bahá’ís on nearly every Indian reservation in the United States and on a number of the

First Nations reserves in Canada, NABI is the only native-oriented official Bahá’í
institution in North America. Established near Pine Springs in 1977 by a small group of
about thirty Diné Bahá’ís who became Bahá’ís either at the Great Council Fire or
afterwards, NABI provides a meeting place suitable to the unique needs and cultural
background of the Diné.335 Chester Kahn’s story of how NABI came about conveys a
remembered poignancy that connects back to the sheep economy of the Dinés when they
returned after imprisonment:

> We decided we needed a center where we could bring the people together to
> deepen them, to teach them. And, we start[ed] looking for a place to establish this
> center. We looked for a year, or over a year, and we finally found one here at a
> place called Burnt Water, which is just a little ways from where I live here on the
> Navajo Nation, because there was a trading post going out of business and they
> wanted to sell. In the old days these trading posts were given free land to build
> trading posts, something like a square mile, because in those days they, the
> traders, bought sheep, lambs every year from them [the Diné ranchers]. They
> needed space for the sheep to graze and so forth, the lambs to graze and so forth.
> There was to be an economy back at the beginning of, after the return from the
> prison, from Fort Sumner where they were imprisoned for four years there. They
> began a new life again where they began raising sheep. Ah, so anyway, this
> trading post was out of business and they wanted to sell their land, we found out.
> So we said, “Let us see if we can find some funds, some moneys to buy a piece of
> land, some of that land.” And we found out at the National office [NSA] that there
> was moneys available where an individual had donated a property. I forget what
> they call it, when somebody dies and leaves their property to the Faith. This
> person, an anonymous person, said that these funds would go for the Native
> American teachings. So, anyway, we found that out, and that was what we were
> told by the National office. And they said we can use that money to buy the
> property. So we said, “Fine. That sounds great!” So 40 acres was bought and we
> started building some buildings there and it was called the Native American
> Baha’i Institute.336

According to In Service to the Common Good: The American Bahá’í
Community’s Commitment to Social Change, Ridvan, 2008, the case report from NABI

\[335\] “NABI,” 32.

\[336\] Chester Kahn, interview.

states that the then-named Navajo Bahá’í Institute was established in 1977.337 However,
NABI’s Web site reports that in 1978, forty Bahá’ís from Navajo-Hopiland were invited
to attend the annual Bahá’í National Convention held in Wilmette, Illinois, along with
other native Bahá’ís and home-front pioneers, to honor the achievement of establishing
twenty-five LSAs on Indian reservations as a part of the goals of the then-current five-
year teaching plan.338 The Diné Bahá’ís announced to the convention their desire to build
a “Bahá’í place” on their reservation. The National Assembly members, after a hurried
meeting in the midst of the convention, announced their support and approval. NABI’s
Web site says that two years later (1980) the land was purchased and the institute began.
NABI administrators reported in the case study that the National Assembly, along with
individual contributors from around the country, “contributed substantially” to the new
institute’s development; $40,000 was paid for the trading post land and $100,000 was
invested in facilities that included hiring professional educators to manage the Institute’s
administration.339

Facilities grew to include four modest residential buildings, five trailers, and one
moderate-size house, which paid staff share with multiple volunteers who come for
various lengths of service over the course of a year. The main office is a converted three-
bedroom trailer situated at the entrance to the campus. The renovated dorm facilities can
now accommodate 40 men and 40 women with three private areas and two large
bathroom areas with stalls and showers. The classroom building houses an adult
classroom, children’s classroom, indoor bathroom, small library, and small foyer.

Additions in recent years include the “Big Hogan,” which contains a large dining area
that is also used for other large programs (see Appendix D-6 and 7). A new extension off
the Big Hogan is another hogan-shaped structure that houses a commercial kitchen,
which replaced the older and much smaller kitchen. The old kitchen was converted into
another indoor bathroom facility to supplement the still-in-use outhouse that had been the
closest facility to the Big Hogan.340 A new concrete sidewalk circles around the Prayer
Hogan and the Big Hogan, passing by the new outdoor, hogan-shaped, open-air arena
situated between them. The part of the campus adjacent to the gravel chapter road is
surrounded by a simple wood-rail fence with a small sign attached to it announcing the
presence of the Institute at the gated entrance. According to NABI co-administer Alice
Bathke, these modern' renovations were made upon recommendations from the elders,
especially those using wheelchairs for ease of transportation from one area to another.341

Jeff and Helen Kiely were NABI’s appointed administrators in 1985 when some
alarm and confusion ensued among its originating Diné Bahá’ís over the Institute’s
proposed name change from the Navajo Bahá’í Institute to the Southwest Native
American Bahá’í Institute. The September 1985 report to the national office contained
Diné Bahá’í Helen Kiely’s statement on NABI’s dilemma of growth: “The physical
nature of the Institute was intended by the project’s initiators to arise out of the
consultation, expertise and labor of the Navajo friends, as an evidence and symbol of a
new strength, self-reliance and independence born of the Navajos’ faith in the Promised
One.”342 In Service noted that it took some time to find the best use of this assistance
from outside the Diné Bahá’ís own labors and to achieve results—time that required the

consultative “clash of differing opinions” before the “spark of truth” could be produced
in order to resolve the confusion created by the name change. The final and more
inclusive name change to Native American Bahá’í Institute challenged the Diné
adherents in ways incomprehensible to their non-Diné counterparts, who had not
experienced the Dinés’ history of loss of autonomy and freedom to run their own affairs.
Chester Kahn explained his thoughts, feelings, and ultimate acceptance in a hesitant yet
straightforward and non-critical way:

> At the beginning we wanted it just for the Navajo institute or center because
> Navajo is a big nation. It’s lots of people! Today, we have something like a
> quarter of a million Navajos. I often think now in looking back, it should have
> been Navajo instead of all Native Americans because it is too far for them to
> come, like the Lakotas, the Lakota people, there are some Bahá’ís up there on
> some of these reservations. It’s just too far to travel. Ah, and because the money
> was given to us by the National, the National office took it over. Some of us were
> thinking that the Navajos would totally run the whole thing. We do things, ah, on
> the reservation, and this is, ah, if it went that way, things would have been
> different, I think. And so anyway that’s the home called NABI, the Native
> American Baha’i Institute that’s in operation now. It’s doing pretty well in
> teaching the Faith and deepening the Bahá’ís and so forth. Ah, and my

> that someday other areas all over the country, all over the United States, things
> would develop like the Navajo Nation where people are becoming Bahá’ís and
> taking their responsibilities to run their own activities, administrative, teaching
> activities, deepening. However, that’s not happening on other reservations. So
> that’s kind of the history of our Faith here in the Navajo Nation.343

Following consultations among local Bahá’ís and between local Bahá’ís and the
national office, the decision was made that NABI’s development would continue to be a
grass-roots initiative whose strength would be drawn from the local population it
intended to serve. Seeing the challenges as “unique and enormous,” the Institute, with
nine permanent staff members, had by 2000 focused its goals away from providing all of

\[343\] Chester Kahn, interview.

its services on campus (like the three national Bahá’í schools or conference centers
around the country), and was instead designated by the National Spiritual Assembly as a
regional training institute. As such, it came to focus on outreach and delivery of programs
into the camps (clusters of extended family homes) and especially toward the 80% of the
Diné population who were under the age of twenty-four. By 2004 programs designed to
enhance participants’ parenting skills were initiated in the reservation’s Chapter
Houses.344 According to the 2008 case report, the Institute’s record of programs in 1999
served nearly 10,000 individuals, with 2,000 in formal training, 6,000 in community
development programs, and 2,000 more who attended Bahá’í outreach teaching
programs. Core activities at the Institute included systematic study courses based on the
Bahá’í writings, devotional gatherings, and children and youth classes. Alfred Kahn, Jr.
has chosen to work with youth as a part of his religious service. Alfred clarifies ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s promise to native peoples when talking about the education of youth,

> It has two parts to it. It has the condition that we train and develop. It says, ‘The
> native people, when properly trained and educated, will be so enlightened so as to
> illumine the whole world.’ It was always conditional on that training and
> education, ‘When properly trained and educated,’ and the Navajo people need to
> re-arm themselves with the new weapons, to use a metaphor of the Monster
> Slayers. It takes the training and education. In the Bahá’í Faith right now
> something that has become really important to me is the Institute process. I’ve
> been working with junior youth and been part of the ‘Institute process,’ which has
> four core activities. One of them [core activity] is devotional gatherings, study
> circles, children’s classes and junior youth groups. I’ve had a real kinship with
> that junior youth group because they have this particular role in life. We go
> through this transition phase where we begin to develop an identity. We begin to
> start making decisions and choices. And it’s a native thing that takes place.345

Part of the Institute process that Alfred refers to is known as Ruhi study circles, in which
information about the religion, its founders, and its teachings are organized in a

\[344\] “NABI,” 32-34.

\[345\] Alfred Kahn, Jr., interview.

systematic way contained within seven workbooks. The Ruhi workbooks are based on
developing a deeper understanding of the Bahá’í writings through a process of
comprehensive reading, with questions and exercises at the end of each section. Their
purpose is to develop the skills, spiritual insight and knowledge to contribute to building
Bahá’í community life. The books progress from simple to difficult in their
comprehension and exercises. Alfred, Jr. continues with his thoughts about providing
service to the youth:

> There was a ceremony associated with that [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s promise]. It’s not part
> of the culture anymore. It’s Changing Man, Changing Woman Ceremony. For
> man it was the Warrior, there was a Warrior training that went on to develop
> yourself, to mature yourself. For women there was a Changing Woman ceremony
> in the Navajo. And in society there is nothing like that. There are so many junior
> youth between the ages of 12-15 that turn towards drugs, violence, and
> alcoholism, towards all these different things. We knew it traditionally that it was
> such an important time to train our junior youth to make sure that they understand
> their role in society and have a spiritual understanding. The Bahá’í Faith has
> brought the Institute process. The Universal House of Justice has told us all to be
> part of the Institute process and what I’ve been drawn to is the junior youth aspect
> because our society, once you turn 12, 13, 14, 15, you make a lot of choices and it
> becomes so self-involved. You have this need and once you develop an identity,
> you feel like you have to fill that need. A lot of times you get filled with the
> material solution of drugs, violence you know, sex, western culture of materialism
> that western culture provided. The way we combat it in the Institute process is by

Psychiatrist and Bahá’í H. B. Danesh defines Bahá’í service as the “third element
of the universal code of ethics emerging as a result of the evolution of humanity and its
coming of age” and says that the immature behaviors humanity had as children and the
rebellious, acting-out stages that adolescents go through are no longer “suitable” for an
evolving, mature human society.347 Danesh defines the first code as truthfulness, or truth,

\[346\] Alfred Kahn, Jr., interview.

\[347\] H.B. Danesh, The Psychology of Spirituality: From Divided Self to Integrated Self (Wienacht,
Switzerland: Landegg Academy Press, 1997), 164.

a “life-long quest” that involves the independent investigation of all things relating to
human nature.348 The second code requires a “fundamental unity that recognizes
humanity’s oneness, based in the qualities of truth and love, without which, we cannot
recognize that fundamental unity of the human race.”349 Service to others, coupled with
truth and unity, lead to humanity’s “age of maturity—the era of spiritual civilization.”350
Alfred, Jr. continues with his thoughts about service to others:

> Service toward humanity is the most important and fundamental aspect of the
> Faith. You serve all mankind. If junior youth can take that to heart, understand it
> as their outlet as opposed to drugs, alcohol, and violence. There is a metaphor that
> comes along with that training that we understand that when you are a junior

Alfred, Jr. ends his comments on service to youth by likening youth to the growth of a
young tree. Danesh notes that in today’s “adolescent world,” people’s first impulse to
service offered to them by others raises suspicion; however, service needs to be
distinguished from charity. Danesh defines service as a reciprocal “act of generosity and
assistance from an equal to an equal, while charity is giving from one who has to one
who does not have.”352 Humanity requires an “integrated lifestyle” of both charity and

equal service for reciprocity to develop, in which egotism lessens, equality becomes
established with others, and individualism becomes replaced with unity.353

Feast as a Religious Matrix. The Palmbergs remember when Diné Bahá’ís first

> 1970. According to the Bahá’í solar calendar instituted by the Báb, who “swept away”
> the names of pagan feasts and Roman holidays and replaced them with the “sublime
> attributes of God” such as Splendor, Glory, Beauty, and similar other names, the Bahá’í
> year has nineteen months of nineteen days each, with the first day of each month
> designated as a “Feast” day, called the Nineteen Day Feast.357 Held in private homes or
> small community centers like NABI, Feast is a time set aside for the believers to come
> together. Accepted as divinely ordained, the Feast has three parts: 1) devotional, with
> writings, prayers, and music; 2) administrative, with reports from the LSA to the
> community, and consultative, with recommendations back to the LSA from the
> community; and 3) social, with time for visiting and refreshments. In the Kitáb-Aqdas,

Bahá’u’lláh made Feast a spiritual law for his followers: “Verily, it is enjoined upon you
> to offer a Feast, once in every month, though only water be served; for God hath
> purposed to bind hearts together, albeit through earthly and heavenly means.”358

> Feast be held in the proper fashion, the friends will, once in nineteen days, find
> themselves spiritually restored, and endued with a power that is not of this world.”359

> from sunset to sunset, so Feast either occurs after sunset on the date it falls on or begins
before sunset on the following day.

During our interview the Palmbergs recollected when the idea of a “Bahá’í
church” first came up during a Feast. Bruce said he remembered when

> we had Feast in our trailer at Pine Springs in 1970. We were constantly picking up
> Navajo Bahá’ís to bring them to Feast. We asked the Navajo Bahá’ís at Feast,
‘What could the people do to help Bahá’ís to become known and to become

Bahá’í?’ The answer was: ‘A Bahá’í Church!’
Sandy added her memory of that event when she said,

The Hogan as Religious Matrix. The Palmbergs’ question of “there” for the
nine-sided hogan during Feast day with the Diné Bahá’ís became NABI, a centering
place of order for the Diné adherents. Historian of religion Mircea Eliade, in his classic
work on myth, symbol, and ritual, provides a reference point for the study of NABI with
his concept of the imago mundi, or a mirror image of the world as it was first constructed
by divine action.363 “Religious man,” Eliade wrote, “feels the need always to exist in a
total and organized world, in a cosmos.”364 Eliade defined an imago mundi as a square
constructed from a central point and divided into four sections or horizons.365 In the case
of NABI, situated on the Navajo reservation between four sacred mountains or horizons,
the NABI campus became a place of order for Diné Bahá’ís. At the center is the Prayer
Hogan (see Appendix D-3 through 6), or Eliade’s empty space where “heaven” is

depicted and where an axis mundis, or centerpost, “connects and supports heaven and
earth and whose base is fixed in the world below.”366 The Diné Bahá’ís need for a place
of order was fulfilled, not only through the administrative structure of the new religion,
but especially by the building of the NABI with its hogans, or hoogans, on the Navajo
reservation.

Sandner places Eliade’s imago mundi squarely in the Diné prayer Hogan, which
was “established by Áłltsé Hastiin, First Man, as a miniature cosmos with its opening
toward the east, its fork posts representing deities, and all the powers of the universe
ranged in their appointed places on the north and south side around the center, which was
also the center of the world.”367 Diné Bahá’í Alfred Kahn, Sr., the youngest brother of
those early founders of the Great Council Fire (see Appendix E-7), was five years old
when he attended that momentous event. During his interview, held in NABI’s Prayer
Hogan, Alfred, Sr. explained with reverent humor and a sense of delight the metaphor of
the hogan:

> Navajos built Hogans as a metaphor for the spiritual world based on honoring the

Father Sky up there to bless us with the rain and cool us down for our people here,
for our plants and animals and our beautiful Hogan.368
Alfred Kahn, Sr. speaks of two healing ceremonies held in a hogan that are
connected to sandpaintings and holy wind, and which McNealy named “the most central
and most sacred of stories.”369 Framed Navajo sandpaintings, with the calligraphic Arabic
emblem of the “Greatest Name, which translates into “O Thou Glory of Glories!” (see
Appendix C-3), embedded in the centers of ancient Diné symbols, grace the timbered
walls of the NABI Prayer Hogan and bring to mind the prophecies of the Unity Chant.
Bahá’í prayer books, scattered around the low circular seating above the red dirt floor,
give emphasis to the prayer Hogan as one aspect of the “religious matrix,” to use
Rambo’s terminology, in which becoming Bahá’í continues to take place.370 This is
obviously an especially sacred place for Alfred, one that, years after the Great Council
Fire, he helped to construct and bring into being. Diné Bahá’ís took “ownership” of the
Native American Baha’i Institute when they incorporated the traditional prayer hogan on
the campus grounds and demonstrated empirically that they are still able to maintain their
culture and uphold their traditions while accepting the Bahá’í Faith. Just as the Great
Council Unity Fire did for those early believers, the formation of NABI by and for the
Diné Bahá’ís effectively mobilized a socio-religious grouping. 371 The first Diné Bahá’ís
created a new vision of order within their world by building a strategic Diné Baha’i
imago mundi (campus) located situationally on the Navajo reservation, as opposed to the
closest center of population off the reservation that could have provided more resources.

Serving the People: Serving Water. Water, an extremely precious commodity
on many parts of the Navajo reservation, has been a source of stress and anxiety ever
since the Diné returned from Fort Sumner. According to Reno, “‘Water is the lifeblood of
the earth,’ Navajos say, and the Colorado River and its tributaries sustain life throughout
a vast, semi-arid area of 244,000 square miles; more than twenty Indian tribes live along
the waterways of the Colorado River Basin and have rights to the water arising or
flowing through their lands.”372 Agriculture in the San Juan River Basin dates back at
least one thousand years to the Anasazi Indians. The Diné arrived in the region after the
Anasazis had abandoned their farms and villages during the great drought recorded in the
thirteenth century. 373 The Diné later also abandoned the Basin, but after returning from
Fort Sumner, Diné farmers started cultivating land on both sides of the San Juan River
when white farmers began to settle the area in the late 1800s. Any Diné family wanting to
farm had been promised 160 acres of irrigated land in arid northwest New Mexico in the
treaty of 1868, but the promise of land with water was “based on empty words” for nearly
a hundred years while dams were constructed up and down the Colorado River Basin in
order to provide water for non-Diné agricultural development.374 Reno notes that the
availability of water to the Diné was critical to their survival:

> To provide a satisfactory life for themselves and their children, Indians must have
> an economically adequate supply of water, and must be free to use it for purposes
> that best serve their own interests. Assertion of Indian rights comes face to face
> with awakening recognition that the river basin does not have enough water to
> supply Indian rights if all existing commitments for water to non-Indians are
> met.375

Adding cultural insult to watery injury, in the 1960s a powerful and federally
sanctioned coal mining company began to drill into the principal hydrologic basin that
underlies Black Mesa, considered sacred and the “liver” of Mother Earth by the Diné.
The long-term heavy usage of this multiple aquifer system, recharged by sparse rainfalls,
has lowered water levels in the springs and other water sources on Dinétah. Reno says the
reservation’s “highest quality water is used to slurry coal away for processing while the
Diné people drink water heavily laden with salts,” and he asserts that the transportation
and health costs of water for the Diné are “enormous.”376

NABI has been “blessed” with a well of abundant fresh water on its campus.

According to NABI’s case study taken from 1999 demographics, 80% of Diné families
on the reservation did not have running water or electricity in their homes in 1999.377
NABI installed an outdoor water pump to serve anyone who needs water. Families,
arriving in the iconic and indispensible pickup truck, collect water in barrels from the
pump to take back to their homes. NABI also offers their office shower facility to any
individual who wants to use it, charging one dollar per shower.378 Thirty-one-year-old
Diné Bahá’í Leander Nelson works in maintenance at NABI. Sitting on an outdoor picnic
table facing the Big Hogan after his work hours were completed, Leander answered my
question concerning the services provided by the Institute to the surrounding area:

Religious matrixes come and go, grow and dwindle, along with the health of the
religion they are born in—and decay in. In this chapter I have examined the newness of
a new religion’s matrixes, identifying some activities as matrices that others, no doubt,
would not. The activities within those matrices, of the prayer hogan, the community
Feast with its consultative process, and the procedure and functioning of the local
administrative institutions, such as NABI, were briefly examined as matrices in which
Diné Bahá’ís come into being, grow, and develop. As with all other entities in the
world, the concept of religious conversion can be examined, too, in the light and under
the scrutiny of the social sciences of psychology, anthropology, and sociology, which
leads to a study of ways that social scientists have understood conversion in the
following chapter.

CHAPTER SEVEN
THE SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGIOUS CONVERSION

Sociologists focus their research on the “study of the development, organization,
functioning, and classification of human societies,” which includes “patterns of social
relationships, social interaction, and culture” among individuals or as “members of
associations, groups, and institutions.”382 Anthropologists focus on “the study of humans,
their origins, physical characteristics, institutions, religious beliefs, and social
relationships.”383 These two definitions indicate that both sociologists and
anthropologists may focus their research on either individuals or the larger units of
societies, and may develop theories about the culture of an individual or a group that
makes an individual’s or a group’s religion cohesive for that individual and or group.
According to cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz, the study of religion is a two-stage
operation: first, an analysis of the systems of meanings embodied in the symbols that
make up the “religion proper”; and second, the relating of these systems to social
structure and psychological processes. For Geertz, all knowledge of human culture is
“local knowledge” and each culture should be examined in depth using its particular
worldview and ethos to understand it.384

Psychologists of religion tend to focus more on individuals and why they are
religious and what makes them so, rather than on the question of what makes an entire
culture religious. In particular, psychologists are interested in understanding the dynamics

of individual religious conversion from one religion to another and have developed
religiosity scales, charts, tests, and schematics as attempts to answer questions about
religious conversion. Sociologists, on the other hand, “examine the social and
institutional aspects of tradition in which conversion takes place” and focus on the
“interaction between individuals and their environmental matrix.”385 Historians of
religion may utilize all these methods to examine the phenomena of religion in addition
to developing their own methodologies of interpretation. In each of these disciplines,
researchers have formulated unique terms, phrases, and concepts that strive to grasp and
define religion, without quite achieving the ever-elusive goal of complete definition—
that “essence of religion” Talal Asad refers to in his critique of Geertz’s theories.386

Geertz maintained that his approach was scientific in that it involves the
systematic acquisition of a body of knowledge through the critical weighing of
observations and involves the proposal of theories regarding the meaning of events, with
tests using evidence from further observation.387 Geertz’s principles of investigation
should also hold true for researchers who study the conversion process. Geertz’s method
may be applied to Diné culture by utilizing the large body of knowledge already gained
from researchers in the field who have observed the lifestyle and ceremonies of the Diné,
proposed their own interpretations or understandings of those events, and then tested their
theories against other researchers’ similar observations and fieldwork in order to gain
further understanding.

Combinative Religious Theory

Historian of North American religions Catherine L. Albanese wrote that the “new
story” of religion in America was one of “meeting and change” between religions that
“modified” themselves upon contact with American soil, in “a world of religious
interchange” beginning with the earliest contact between religions.388 Albanese includes
the European religious contact with American Indians, beginning in the early 1600s, who,
while “constrained by circumstances to convert to Christianity, did so on their own terms
and for their own needs.”389 Albanese’s qualifier here is “constrained.” I noted earlier the
unusualness of the Diné’s conversion to Bahá’í, because historically American Indians
typically have not converted to any other religion without coercion of some sort.
Albanese’s term “constrained” implies a form of coercion.390 In defense of both our
arguments, the qualifying word is “historically.” While it is certainly true that many Diné
are Christians today by their own free will and choice, that seems not to be the case in the
early colonial periods that Albanese places her work in, and appears not to be the case
during the 1930s through the 1950s, according to my interviewees’ remembrances from
their boarding school experiences, in which they had to “choose” a church to attend. I
argue that Iverson and Boyce demonstrated in their work on the early history of Diné
culture in the 1800s and in the 1940s, respectively, that the majority of Diné did not
incorporate Christianity into their lifestyles without some form of coercion. Sects or
denominations of Christianity are the only religion(s) that American Indians have

converted to other than Bahá’í—I know of no cases of full-blood American Indians who
grew up on reservations converting to Buddhism, Judaism, or Islam, for instance.

Although, according to Albanese, some American Indians converted to
Christianity “on their own terms” and to “meet their own needs,” the Diné Bahá’ís I
interviewed did not verify from their own experiences this reason for conversion to
Christianity , nor did they relate any stories of willing conversion within their knowledge
of their family and cultural histories. Rather, to the contrary, the act of choosing a
Christian church to attend was forced upon them in boarding schools, which, as Boyce
and Iverson amply demonstrated, did not meet the needs of the Diné. The acts of coercion
and constraint that have happened over the centuries since contact and Indians taking
what they could wrestle out of conversion do not fit any model of a “true” conversion
experience, as defined below, based on the current sociological and psychological
models of conversion. In my experience, most American Indians have historically
recognized the basic truth of Christ as a divine prophet and a “holy man” but have
strenuously objected to how Christ’s followers conquered and decimated their native
cultures. American Indians, with little recourse when all other means had failed, joined
ranks with their conquerors through conversion to Christianity, which often was the
safest circumstance that could be obtained by Indians during that time period.
Recognition by Indians of the validity of Christ as a divine personage does not by itself
translate into a true conversion experience of acceptance and belief, with the inward
changes followed by observable outward changes that signify a true conversion
experience that most psychological models demand as a proof of true conversion.
Psychologist Bernard Spilka cites James Strickland’s earlier argument (1924) that if

different actions and a change of habits do not follow the embracing of new ideals, then
true conversion has not occurred.391

Albanese talks about the exchange of material gifts in a religious marketplace,
claiming that “what was being sold was self and soul,” while what was “being bought
was new and combinatory American religions.”392 Albanese speaks rightly about the
1960s “wannabe contamination,” or usurpation, of American Indian ceremonies by New
Agers that was, and continues to be, an appropriation by non-natives of native practices,
and she states that the act of gift-giving/gift-taking “masks oppression and also subverts
it,” signaling “new narratives of contact and combination.”393 While Albanese’s
observations are accurate, gift-giving and gift-receiving in American Indian culture,
called a give-away, fulfill a traditional duty and obligation performed at rites of passage,
ceremonies, crossing-overs (deaths), and honorings; it should not be confused with what
would be known in colloquial terms as the “looking a gift-horse in the mouth” exchanges
between Indians and the dominant Christian culture of the time as a process of true
conversion. The old idiom about a “gift horse” refers to questioning the value of a (gift)
horse by looking in its mouth at the age of its teeth. In other words, refrain from finding
fault with a gift that one may not have asked to be given in the first place and may not in
fact want—reflective of what Albanese calls the masking and subversion of oppression
through gift-giving.394

I agree with Albanese and Rambo that encounters between potential converts and
religious advocates can involve a dynamic interaction in which reciprocal needs—the

\[391\] Bernard Spilka, Ralph W. Hood, Jr., Bruce Hunsberger, and Richard Gorsuch, The Psychology of
Religion: An Empirical Approach, 3rd ed. (New York: The Guilford Press, 2003), 345.

\[393\] Ibid., “Exchanging Selves, Exchanging Souls,” 204.

\[394\] Ibid., “Exchanging Selves, Exchanging Souls,” 204.

acts of giving and receiving gifts—are met.395 The words “can,” “dynamic,” and
“reciprocal” are qualifiers that do not necessarily include or imply coercion or constraint.
The needs met for the Diné through Bahá’í adherence are certainly many, more through
gifts of the spirit than of the body, which provide personal growth, enlightenment through
education, and autonomy and empowerment through administrative responsibility for
their own religious institutions. The reciprocal gift to the new religion is the inclusion of
another group of people with their unique talents and abilities and perspectives to help the
emerging world religion build upon its plan of global unity. These gifts, for Diné Bahá’ís,
are not Albanese’s selling of self and soul to the new religion; rather, to the contrary,
according to my Diné informants, self and soul were saved instead of sold.

Albanese documents the arrival of Asian religions in the United States as early as
1801 and notes that the first World Parliament of Religions (WPR), held in conjunction
with the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, served as a “watershed for Eastern
religions,” which then incorporated some forms of religiosity from the religions already
established in the United States, thereby developing combinatory religions.396 The Bahá’í
Faith (as did Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) arose in the Near East, and the first
mention of the new religion in America was in a paper read at the 1893 Parliament of
Religions, although it cannot be said that the WPR was a watershed for the Bahá’í Faith
as Albanese indicates the WRP was for other Eastern religions.397 In the words of Bahá’í
scholar and educator William Hatcher, the Bahá’í Faith is “a distinct religion, based
entirely on the teachings of its founder, Bahá’u’lláh. It is not a cult, a reform movement

\[395\] Rambo, Understanding Religious Conversion, 59.

\[396\] Albanese, “Exchanging Selves, Exchanging Souls,” 220-21.

\[397\] Hatcher and Martin, Bahá’í Faith, 52.

or a sect within any other faith, nor merely a philosophical movement.” 398 Hatcher
quotes the well-known historian Arnold Toynbee, who added the incorrect phoneme of
ism to Baha’i: “Bahaism is an independent religion on a par with Islam, Christianity, and
the other recognized world religions. Bahaism is not a sect of some other religion; it is a
separate religion, and it has the same status as other recognized religions.”399

The Diné conversion to the Bahá’í Faith should not be confused with Albanese’s
combinative religious model; yet, no major religious system has arisen in a religious
vacuum. The Bahá’í Faith arose within the matrix of Islam, its mother religion, just as
Christianity arose within the matrix of Judaism. Diné Bahá’ís, finding their traditional
oral prophecies fulfilled in the Bahá’í Faith, did not form a new religion from either
source nor do they consider their traditional way of life and their Bahá’í way of life as a
new “combinatory religion,” in Albanese’s terms. Close and objective observation shows
that traditional and new remain independent of each other, while at the same time
paralleling each other, as in Alfred Kahn, Jr.’s statement that he sees the Bahá’í Faith as
“a continuation of Navajo belief,” much as Christians consider Christianity a continuation
of Judaism.400

Clearly, Albanese’s work does show that decaying older religions may try to
become something new and vibrant again by combining with new material. Vine Deloria,
Jr. addressed common Indian problems, especially those of the “white man’s religion”
and federal legislation that impacted all of native life. As one of the first natives to hold a

Master’s degree in theology, Deloria was uniquely qualified to assess the impact of
Christianity on reservations, and he spoke to the issue of “decay” as he saw it:

> The justification of past exploitations of native peoples has been that the gospel
> had to be preached to them and that a newer, better civilization had to rise from
> the native peoples’ primitive hovels. Such a gospel of peace has been notoriously
> lacking as an element in Western civilization and it is very questionable whether
> the present state of decay, corruption, and exploitation is better than what had
> existed before the coming of the Western Christian to the nations of the world.401

Historian of North American religions Martha L. Finch aptly notes that in indigenous
cultures “there has traditionally been no concept of ‘religion’ distinct from all aspects of
everyday life. Everything a person did was ‘religious’ or ‘spiritual,’ the term some
Indians today use in order to avoid the problems with the term ‘religion.’ Thus, many
Christian missionaries thought native people had no religion.”402 The idea that native
people “had no religion” and that the gospel “had to be preached to them” in order that a
“newer, better civilization had to rise from the native peoples’ primitive hovels”
describes the religious intersections that Albanese addresses when she talks about
“exchanging selves, exchanging souls” between native people and their conquerors in the
New World.403 Deloria describes the “present state” as a state of “decay, corruption, and
exploitation” within Western civilization, without actually saying what he believes has
caused this decay, although he alludes to “the coming of the Western Christian to the
nations of the world.”404

According to Bahá’í tenets, religions are organic entities that are born, grow and
develop, and decay and die over time just as do all other organic entities in the known

universe. Albanese accurately observed the attempts of combinative religious groups to
revitalize themselves, to struggle for positioning, and to stop their process of decay. I
argue that, because the Bahá’í Faith is a new, independent religious system and because
neither Diné nor non-Diné Bahá’í adherents admit to a combinative result of the two
systems of Diné and Bahá’í, Albanese’s combinative religious model does not describe
the Diné becoming Bahá’í conversion experience. However, Diné traditional customs and
Bahá’í religiosity obviously share an intermingling and overlapping of certain features,
such as gift-giving and gift-receiving, Diné prayers at Holy Days and Feast days, and
Bahá’í prayers in the Diné Prayer Hogan.

According to its founders, the Bahá’í Faith will remain free of schisms,
breakaways, or combinatory effects within the religion due to the explicit Covenants of
Bahá’u’lláh that protects the religion. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts this protection from divisions,
schisms, and combinations:

> As to the most great characteristic of the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, a specific
> teaching not given by any of the Prophets of the past, it is the ordination and
> appointment of the Center of the Covenant [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. By this appointment
> and provision He [Bahá’u’lláh] has safeguarded and protected the religion of God
> against differences and schisms, making it impossible for anyone to create a new
> sect or faction of belief. To insure unity and agreement He has entered into a
> Covenant with all the people of the world including the Interpreter and Explainer
> of His teachings so that no one may interpret or explain the religion of God
> according to his own view or opinion and thus create a sect founded upon his
> individual understanding of the divine words. The Book of the Covenant or
> Testament of Bahá’u’lláh is the means of preventing such a possibility, for
> whosoever shall speak from the authority of himself alone shall be degraded. Be
> ye informed and cognizant of this.405

The Universal House of Justice addressed the problem of possible future schisms in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, saying, “Although the Universal House of Justice is explicitly authorized
to change or repeal its own legislation as conditions change, thus providing Bahá’í law

\[405\] ‘Abdu'l-Bahá, Promulgation of Universal Peace, 455.

with an essential element of flexibility, it cannot abrogate or change any of the laws
which are explicitly laid down in the sacred Text.”406 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote,

Today this process of deduction is the right of the body of the House of Justice,
> and the deductions and conclusions of individual learned men have no authority,
> unless they are endorsed by the House of Justice. The difference is precisely this,
> that from the conclusions and endorsements of the body of the House of Justice

As an example, the Prayer Hogan at NABI remains Diné. It is not considered a
hybrid Diné-Bahá’í Prayer Hogan; although Bahá’ís built it and pray within it, the Prayer
Hogan remains uniquely Diné without producing a schism or division either within the
religion or within Diné traditional customs. Other indigenous cultures that have Bahá’í
adherents also maintain their own cultural traditions, but the Bahá’í Faith remains
unchanged by these other indigenous intersections.408 Essentially, Diné ceremonies and
traditions remain just that—traditional. On the other side, the Bahá’í scriptures, structure,
and administrative institutions have not combined with Diné cosmology, either. Rather,
the Bahá’í principle to protect diverse cultures led to the acceptance of the Diné Prayer
Hogan on the campus grounds of a Bahá’í institution (NABI) without a hybrid,
combinatory result or lessening of religious or cultural identity on either side.409

Rambo’s Phenomenological Religious Model

Lewis R. Rambo’s phenomenological model incorporates earlier process models
and addresses a wide range of conversion experiences and models across major religious
systems, including indigenous cultures, and provides a broad, multidimensional theory of
religious conversion “throughout the world.”410 Rambo examines seven dimensions of
religious conversion that he identifies as: 1) context; 2) crisis; 3) quest; 4) encounter; 5)
interaction; 6) commitment; and 7) consequences. In addition, Rambo identified five
conversion types distinguished by the social and cultural distance involved in making the
conversion: 1) apostasy or defection; 2) intensification; 3) affiliation or movement from
no religious involvement to full involvement; 4) institutional transition, or movement
from one faith community to another within a major religious tradition; and 5) tradition-
transition, a movement from one major religious tradition to another.411

Context. Rambo writes that the “human drama” of conversion, “spanning
historical eras” and molded by “geographical expansion and contraction,” comprises the
total cultural environment (macrocontext) in which conversion takes place.412 Within the
macrocontext lies the more immediate microcontext of “family, ethnic group, religious
community, and neighborhood” that creates “a sense of identity and belonging and
shapes a person’s thoughts, feelings, and action.”413 According to Rambo, until recently
psychologists have ignored the social and cultural context of religious conversion
because psychologists focus instead on the individual. However, Rambo argues,

\[413\] Ibid., Understanding Religious Conversion, 22.

psychologists “cannot talk adequately about a person’s psyche without contextualizing
that psyche”; the person who grows up in a small, remote area lives in a different world
than the person who lives in an urban setting “with its supermarket of social, moral, and
religious options.”414 Rambo writes,

> Context not only provides the soicocultural matrix that shapes a person’s
> myths, symbols, and beliefs; it also has a powerful impact in terms of access,
> mobility, and the opportunity for coming into contact with new religious
> influences. Increased mobility in the modern world makes it easier for the
> advocate (the missionary) to move into new areas to propagate religious
> ideology. Increased mobility also enables the potential convert to more readily
> leave behind old patterns of social relationships that may feel constricting, and to
> find new options. . . . Conversion to a religion that offers clear answers and
> belief systems can provide relief from the overwhelming multiplicity of options
> and cacophony of voices pulling the individual in different directions. It [the new
> religion] can provide a coherent center from which to conduct one’s life in a
> world where that center has been lost.415
As I argued earlier, the historical era of the Diné’s Long Walk to Fort Sumner and
their return (1863 to 1868) to the changed world of a geographically contracted
reservation potentially sowed the seeds of a later conversion of some Diné to Bahá’í.
Included in the potentiality of conversion was not only the home-front pioneers’ ability to
move onto the Navajo reservation in the late 1950s, but also the increased mobility of the
Diné themselves to move into other social environments, whether that of the Bahá’í
Center in Gallup, New Mexico, or into the social arena of a home-front pioneer’s
environment, or into that of a job in an urban setting, such as Linda Wilson’s move to
Washington, D.C. By the 1960s, the Diné had experienced years of hearing a “cacophony
of voices” from various governmental agencies, churches, missions, and boarding schools
pulling them “in different directions.” Perhaps one of those contextual directions was
toward Rambo’s fifth theory of conversion, tradition transition, which may take place

\[414\] Rambo, Understanding Religious Conversion, 30.

\[415\] Ibid, Understanding Religious Conversion, 30-31.

when contact occurs between two different cultures.416 According to Rambo, tradition
transition into a foreign religion may be imported in three ways: 1) by missionaries who
are allowed contact with indigenous cultures because they are representatives of a
colonizing and powerful government; 2) by the contributions of outsiders that come into
an already opened society; 3) or because the weakened society cannot prevent contact.417
All three conditions for tradition transition had already occurred in the Diné culture by
the time Bahá’í home-front pioneers arrived on the reservation.

I argue that tradition transition more closely aligns with Diné becoming Bahá’í
than do most other current psychological and sociological theories of conversion. In
Rambo’s tradition transition, a conversion from one religious system to a completely
different religious system calls for the individual to integrate and modify his or her
lifestyle to fit the new religion’s belief system. In significant ways, Rambo’s model of
tradition transition applies to Diné who are in the process of becoming Bahá’í, while at
the same time, Rambo’s model cannot completely describe the becoming Bahá’í
experience either, because Bahá’í conversion does not require turning one’s back on
one’s previous religious system. However, Diné Bahá’ís, along with all other non-Diné
Bahá’ís, do strive to integrate and modify their lifestyles to come into accordance and
compliance with the Bahá’í laws governing physical and spiritual behaviors and attitudes,
as seen earlier in Diné attempts to become Bahá’í through striving to live the Bahá’í life.
Striving and integrating, transformation and change are significant aspects both of
Rambo’s model and of becoming Bahá’í. Psychiatrist and Bahá’í H. B. Danesh writes in
the Psychology of Spirituality: From Divided Self to Integrated Self that “striving is the

\[416\] Rambo, Understanding Religious Conversion, 38.

\[417\] Ibid., Understanding Religious Conversion, 39.

essential component in the life of any human being.”418 All humans have the “quality of
striving or questing,” which Danesh sees as “an aspect of the capacity to love,” in which
humans “desire, strive, and quest for an object, a person, or an idea.”419 Danesh describes
a lack of these human qualities as a spiritual “disorder of love,” or a crisis that requires a
reevaluation of one’s “intellectual, emotional, and spiritual aspects of being.”420 Rambo
notes that “indigenous cultures that are in crisis will have more potential converts than
stable societies.”421

Crisis. Rambo writes that “some crises are caused by external forces,” as when
“colonial powers disrupt” and possibly “destroy the existing soicocultural reality of the
indigenous people.”422 Although the culture may be more or less resilient, Rambo notes
that “the very fabric of a culture may be rent asunder” and is “rarely able to resist” the
overwhelming force of an outside power such as the Europeans exerted upon the
indigenous peoples of North America.423 Included in the externally stimulated crisis may
be the activities of missionaries or advocates, which, according to Rambo, may trigger
dissatisfactions not previously felt in potential converts prior to the colonial expansion.424
Rambo notes that most psychoanalytic orientations within the psychological literature
view conversion as stemming from a crisis of debility and breakdown, explaining
conversion as “an adaptive mechanism that attempts to resolve psychological issues.”425
Humanistic and transpersonal psychologists, on the other hand, suggest that people are

naturally “spiritual questors, always growing, learning, developing, and maturing.”426 In
short, psychoanalysts, because their subjects are taken from their “emotionally ill”
clinical cases, see conversion as a “search for emotional resolution,” while humanists
psychologists see their subjects as “healthy people who seek conversion in their quest for
intellectual, spiritual, and emotional transformation and growth.”427 Regardless of the
psychological orientation, personal change is a necessary ingredient of conversion.

As stated previously, Spilka cites an earlier psychological argument that if
different actions and a change of habits do not follow the embracing of new ideals, then
true conversion has not occurred.428 Some earlier researchers’ views were that “a
genuine religious conversion is the outcome of a crisis.”429 Most psychodynamic
approaches to conversion use this classic model of the convert as being acted upon, or
passive, in the conversion process, while theorizing that religious conversion functions as
a solution to unresolved childhood problems and sexual or aggressive impulses
(psychoanalytic model).430 The classic model of conversion cannot be entirely dismissed
from the becoming Bahá’í experience of the Diné, because research has clearly shown
that the Diné suffered great crises both as a people and individually, which supports not
only my earlier argument for a culture-wide, crises-induced PTSD but also that those
same historical crises “plowed the ground” of Diné hearts and minds and led them to
consider more readily what the Bahá’í Faith had to offer them. However, I argue against
the notion that the Diné who become Bahá’ís are being “passive” or “acted upon” as the

classic model indicates. In the psychological sense, being passive or acted upon implies a
dominant force acting upon a subordinate subject, such as the United States military
forcefully removing the Diné from their homeland, or the coercive pressure put on Diné
parents who had little choice but to allow their children to be taken to Christian-run
boarding schools. From a psychological point of view, Albanese also uses the classic
model of religious conversion when she talks about the use of coercion and constraint
(forms of being acted upon and passive) as common occurrences of “trade in the religious
marketplace” between the dominant Christian culture and American Indians, which
resulted in an exchange of the native self and soul with the dominant culture.431

Quest. Rambo notes that social scientists are beginning to view individuals as
their own “active agents” (the contemporary model of conversion) in the “creation of
meaning and the selection of religious options,” which Rambo sees as the impetus for
quest.432 Rambo conceptualizes questing as playing out in five different modes of
individual response to potential conversion: active, receptive, rejecting, apathetic, and
passive.433 The quest motif highlights the potential convert as actively seeking something
“more” in religious life: seeking new options to replace old ways or a desire for
innovation, fulfillment, and growth (active mode); having a readiness for new options for
a variety of reasons (receptive mode); consciously rejecting the new option (rejection
mode); having no interest in a new religious option (apathetic mode); or being so weak
and fragile one is easily manipulated by external influences (passive mode).434 Rambo,

like Albanese, says that encounters between potential converts (such as Diné) and their
religious advocates (Bahá’í home-front pioneers) can and do involve a dynamic
interaction in which reciprocal needs are met. My research did not show any coercion or
constraint from the Bahá’í home-front pioneers upon the Diné. Rather, research and
interviews show the opposite; in the early days of home-front pioneering, the Diné often
asked the non-Diné Bahá’ís what they were going to give them in exchange for coming to
Bahá’í events. While research does show that some services, such as showers and water,
were provided by NABI to the Diné, these acts of service were not tied to any expected
religious action in return from the Diné.

Encounter. Rambo identifies his fourth stage of conversion as encounter, the
“vortex of the dynamic force field in which conversion takes place.435 Within this stage,
the details of an advocate’s interaction with a potential convert are “extraordinarily
complex” with the continuum of the outcome ranging from total rejection to complete
acceptance.436 Rambo notes an “interesting find rarely mentioned in conversion studies”
that shows the “majority of target populations reject new religious options”:437

> The truth is that that enmeshment with old systems of religion, family society, and
> politics seldom encourages movement to a new religious option. Personal and
> social conditions rarely facilitate change. Hence, what makes any voluntary
> conversion process possible is a complex confluence of the “right” potential
> convert coming into contact, under proper circumstances at the proper time, with
> the “right” advocate and religious option.438

I argue that Rambo’s findings of rejection support my initial argument about the
unusualness of Diné becoming Bahá’í, even with the stressors of economic factors and
historical oppression that induced crisis among the Diné. I argue that, without an active

and knowledgeable belief by the Diné in the fulfillment of their prophecies, most likely
there would not have been the 1962 mass enrollment of three hundred Diné into the
Bahá’í Faith at the Great Council Fire Unity Conference, nor would smaller numbers of
Diné have continued to enter the new religion over the years since then.

In the United States, enrolling in the religion entails the simple act of signing an
enrollment or declaration card that says one recognizes Bahá’u’lláh as the Messenger of
God for this age and one agrees to abide by the laws of the religion.439 The enrollment of
three hundred Dinés in the Bahá’í Faith, which happened during and immediately
following the Great Council Fire Unity Conference, might have been viewed as an early
step in the process of “entry by troops,” a precursor to future mass conversions predicted
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi and precipitated by the “flow of pioneers” to
teaching areas.440 Troop in Bahá’í context refers to a “group of people who come together
in large numbers” rather than the more common use of “troop” as a military unit or
force.441 The Universal House of Justice, in a series of letters to Bahá’í communities,
further reinforces the idea of entry by troops and mass conversion:

> A thrilling consequence of these favorably conjoined developments is the
> emergence of a new paradigm of opportunity for further growth and consolidation
> of our world-wide community. New prospects for teaching the Cause at all levels
> of society have unfolded. These are confirmed in the early results flowing from
> the new teaching initiatives being fostered in a number of places as more and
> more national communities witness the beginnings of that entry by troops
> promised by the beloved Master [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] and which Shoghi Effendi said
> would lead on to mass conversion.442

However, simply enrolling large numbers of individuals into the religion is not the
ultimate goal. The Universal House of Justice wrote that

While aspects of Rambo’s theory of conversion, already defined as a “turning
from [old] and to new religious groups, ways of life, systems of belief, and modes of
relating to a deity or the nature of reality,” align with the Diné becoming Bahá’í
experience, Rambo’s use of “turning from” warrants further examination in that Diné
Bahá’ís’ did not turn from salient parts of their traditional belief system.444 However,
Rambo’s model does fit in that Diné Bahá’ís did turn from non-productive patterns of
thought and behaviors created by colonization through adherence to the teachings of their
new religion. This turning from, as a process of individual personal growth, allows for
the transformation of character resulting in the “new models of [spiritual and religious]
life” that the Universal House of Justice speaks to.445 Transformation entails change, and
“human beings,” Rambo says, “continually engage in the process of world construction
and reconstruction in order to generate meaning and purpose, to maintain psychic
equilibrium, and to ensure continuity.”446

Interaction. In Rambo’s fifth stage of interaction those individuals who choose
to continue with a new religious group after the initial encounter find that their interaction
with the advocates intensifies.447 Rambo defines these crucial elements of interaction as
relationships, rituals, rhetoric, and roles.448 Kahn and Greene found that once the sphere
of influence is established by “encapsulation,” a matrix in which “crucial elements of
conversion operates,” Rambo’s four dimensions of interaction create and consolidate
potential converts’ emotional bonds to the group of advocates, provide rituals through the
repetition of physical actions that embody holistic knowledge, provide new uses of
language, new metaphors, and new narratives that reframe the self (convert), and place
the self within the larger scheme of the new “world” created by the advocates.449 Rambo
explains that the three varieties of encapsulation—physical, social, and ideological—
impose conditions that are not entirely distinct from one another. Instead, they overlap
and reinforce each other in a process that is crucially intense to a potential convert “as a
rebirthing process should be.”450 Rambo’s fifth stage describes the tensions that may
occur during the deepening process of newly converted Diné Bahá’ís.

Commitment. Rambo describes his sixth stage of conversion as the “fulcrum of
the change process.”451 In this commitment stage the potential convert decides to affiliate
with the new religion, which may include a public demonstration, such as a personal
testimony of faith by the convert. The convert’s public testimony serves as a symbolic
repudiation of the old self and the embracing of a new identity by using the new language

of the new religion as a means of personal transformation.452 The rhetoric of public
testimony is one way to activate a necessary reconstruction and reinterpretation of
personal history.453 Rhetoric, Rambo explains, is the “language of transformation.”454

The Wrights remembered the rhetoric of a “public testimony” at the June 1962

Great Council Fire Unity Conference, when the clan patriarch John Hale got up on the
stage the second day of the event wearing his rather famous mountain lion-skin hat with
its tall eagle feather (see Appendix C-5) and said, “I don’t understand any of this but my
hat and my heart tell me it’s true.” The Wrights noted that “from then on, things started to
roll.”455 Nancy Phillips documented the event in an August 1962 Bahá’í newsletter as a
“glimpse.”456 Hale, a medicine man whose hat was a symbol of strength and wisdom, was
the highly respected leader of the Pine Springs community. On stage addressing the
multitude of strangers spread out on the grounds before him, Hale, “with tears in his eyes,
exclaimed, ‘Something has happened! The earth is true, the sun is true, the atmosphere is
true, and this gathering of brotherhood is true.”’457 According to Phillips, the stately
eighty-three-year-old Hale embraced Hand of the Cause of God Zikruʼlláh Khádem (see
Appendix C-1, 2, and 5), while “men and women alike wept unashamedly, as these two
men communicated through the heart.”458 Hale’s public approval and embracing of the
Bahá’í Faith provided a strong fulcrum of change for those Diné in attendance.

Consequences. Rambo’s seventh and last stage, the consequences phase of the
conversion process, requires a long temporal perspective over time that must take into

consideration the consequences of conversion for the converts in their resolutions of life-
course challenges.459 Rambo begins the consequences phase with a word of caution about
the potential personal biases of an assessor of conversion, regardless of whether that
assessor comes from a “theological orientation” or from “the human sciences.”460 Rambo
defines “theology” as a “disciplined effort to articulate beliefs and ways of life in fresh
and challenging ways so that the religious message can be accepted and understood by
people of various cultures” and writes that the “central effect of theology on conversion is
the creation of norms for what is expected in the conversion process, and the shaping of
expectations and experiences of converts.”461 Rambo notes that psychologists, as
assessors from the human sciences, tend “to be vigilant for pathology,” which results in
“generally portraying conversion in a negative light” in the psychological literature.462
According to Rambo, any study of the conversional process should take into account the
investigator’s own values and “disciplinary ethos” that may “shape interpretation” of the
data, so that one’s research will have a “maximum value for peers and other readers.”463
Consequences arising from conversion range across a broad spectrum, from positive to
negative, and can include both positive and unexpectedly negative soicocultural and
historical consequences for the convert and the convert’s group, along with a shaping or
reshaping of the religious “geography” or “religious landscape” of the convert’s group, as
well.464

Kahn and Greene write that in the consequence phase, a convert needs to consider
the role of conversion in one’s life. Resolving life-course challenges of “identity,
intimacy, generatively, and integrity” evolves into a creative process and spiritual work
for the convert.465 Any given conversion experience (like that of a Diné becoming
Bahá’í) may include some but not all of Rambo’s identified phases. Individual phases
may also vary in intensity and duration and may frequently overlap and reoccur. Kahn
and Greene noted that the implications of even a “sudden surrender experience” may take
much processing for the convert and a gradual conversion process “may require many
years to assimilate fully.”466 Kahn and Greene’s astute observation can be seen in the
length of time it has taken for some of the Diné converts to become “deepened” in the
spiritual and administrative processes of their new religion.

According to the native Elders I named in my acknowledgements, life-course
challenges are “boulders in the road” that test one’s commitment to the task at hand. One
has the choice to climb over, go around, or stop and go back. Getting off the road (of life)
is not advised as an option. Boulders appear on narrow, steep slopes that block one’s path
and demand ingenuity, creativeness, energy, independence mixed with cooperation, and
thought to resolve. Through the process of working one’s way to the other side of the
boulder one grows, advances to the next stage of “tests and difficulties,” and becomes.

Moving Toward Becoming: Living the Life

When Chester Kahn remarked that undeepened Diné were “not seen anymore,”
he meant that they were “inactive” Bahá’ís who did not “live the life” by following the

\[465\] Kahn and Greene, “Seeing Conversion Whole,” 237. Kahn and Greene cite Erik Erikson (1968).

\[466\] Ibid, “Seeing Conversion Whole,” 237.

Bahá’í spiritual and moral laws outlined in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Not living the life may be
deduced from a Bahá’í’s lack of participation in religious functions or by known
behaviors that are at variance with “the Bahá’í laws of personal living [that] will assert
the fullness of, and arouse a desire to share in, the Bahá’í way of life.”467 However,
outwardly observable behaviors do not preclude the fact that some of those Diné Bahá’ís
whom Chester refers to as undeepened still considered themselves to be Bahá’ís.

Occasionally, Diné individuals appear to Diné Bahá’ís or at NABI and declare
themselves to be Bahá’í from years previously. Psychological studies that examine the
adaptive versus regressive quality of conversion experiences have given little
consideration to these kinds of longer-term religious and spiritual consequences, such as
a person’s evolving relationship with God, a sense of mission, a reason for living, and the
experience of a change in their nature of reality over time.468 Sandner investigated the
concept of sin among the Diné and said that the “counterbalance to fear of possession [by
ghosts associated with evil power and witches] is the Navaho reliance on reason and
knowledge in regulating their moral and ethical behavior, and in building their extensive
healing system.”469 The Diné were characterized in a 1957 study of their moral code as
rational, prudent, and practical. Sandner’s comment on possession refers to the Diné’s
traditional belief in ghosts:

> When faced with a problem, they believed in talking it over, examining all sides,
> and arriving at a reasonable solution. By itself, appeal to authority or tradition is
> not a sufficient guide. The solution must be prudent, offering the greatest good to

The custom had been that when Diné died their hogans were either burned or
abandoned and their names were not spoken again. Bahá’í theology strongly urges
restraint against “superstitions,” such as the belief in harmful ghosts, while yet upholding
a fundamental belief in other levels of existence, along with the emanation of dreams as
proof of those other “worlds of God” that contain the “Divine Concourse” of departed
souls.471 A search in Ocean found 2,446 sentences in 171 Bahá’í documents containing
some form of the phrase “worlds of God.” Narrowing my search down to “worlds”
resulted in 16,015 hits, which include the singular “world.” An example from ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in regard to the worlds of God said,

> The immortality of the spirit is mentioned in the Holy Books; it is the
> fundamental basis of the divine religions. Now punishments and rewards are said
> to be of two kinds. Firstly, the rewards and punishments of this life; secondly,
> those of the other world. But the paradise and hell of existence are found in all the
> worlds of God, whether in this world or in the spiritual heavenly worlds. Gaining
> these rewards is the gaining of eternal life. That is why Christ said [to] act in such
> a way that you may find eternal life, and that you may be born of water and the
> spirit, so that you may enter into the Kingdom.472

In Bahá’í scripture, dreams are a “created phenomena” that contain “myriad perfect
wisdoms” and “myriad new and wondrous truths,” with “concealed worlds” and many
secrets and wisdoms “deposited therein.”473 Alfred Kahn, Sr. and I were riding in

Alfred’s pickup truck when he inadvertently played an old cassette recording of a Bahá’í
talk his deceased brother, Ben Kahn (see Appendix E-3), had given years before. His
subsequent behavior demonstrated significant inward and outward changes in thought
and belief from the old Diné tradition that the departed person’s name is not to be spoken,
and that their spirits can harm one (“ghost sickness”) as he continued to listen to the
recording and then said his brother’s name aloud.474 When I asked Alfred about the
Bahá’í admonition against “idle fancies and vain imaginings,” Alfred said he was trying
to get away from “superstitions,” from not being scared because of the traditional belief
about the deceased.475 With his usual humor Alfred said,

Sandner cites a study done by psychoanalysts Bert Kaplan and Dale Johnson in
1964 on psychiatric illness among the Diné that identified four patterns of
psychopathology.477 Kaplan and Johnson’s third pattern or category, noted by Sandner
more as a character disorder than a mental illness, includes ghost sickness and a fear of

possession from “something evil” outside of that person, thereby allowing that person not
to be held accountable for his or her own behaviors.478 Sandner, who comes to his work
on Diné healing traditions from the perspective of a Jungian-trained psychoanalytic
psychiatrist, as opposed to a humanistic psychologist (refer back to Rambo’s discussion
on psychoanalysts’ viewpoints of conversion as a form of emotional illness), writes that
“all of these forms of illness have at their core the phenomenon of dissociation, leading to
possession and socially undesirable behavior” by the individual who considers himself or
herself to be possessed, which “forms the core of the Navaho concepts of mental
illness.”479 The “rational, prudent, and practical” Diné had themselves established the
“core” of their own concepts of mental illness prior to any studies conducted by outside
agents. Sandner saw these historical Diné cultural adaptations to forms of mental illness
among themselves as an “excessive fear of the dead and their ghosts; the development of
elaborate ceremonies with strict regulations based on knowledge alone; the avoidance of
psychic possession and the vision quest [highly valued in most other native traditions];
and the reluctant acceptance of the peyote religion by many of the traditional medicine
men.”480 According to Sandner, “culture does not have an unlimited license” and “must
reckon with the psyche—the culture must stay within emotional, mental, and behavioral
boundaries or it becomes a sick culture and, without a remedy, that culture will die.”481
In their defense, Sandner notes that Diné, unlike many other native tribes, devalue altered
states of consciousness, moving such states to the peripheral of their ceremonies, and are

“very cautious about the use of dreams, trancelike states, and vision.”482 The purpose of
the foundational Diné Blessing Way ceremony is to establish peace and harmony, but it
also protects Diné against disturbing dreams and imagery:

> Blessing Way practice embraces birth and adolescence, the home or hogan,
> weddings, maintenance and acquisition of properties, protection against accident,
> forewarning in dream and imagery, an endeavor to prolong life as long as
> possible. No other ceremonial in the Navaho system offers the native assistance in
> every walk of life as Blessing Way does. It knows a solution for disturbing
> dreams and fancies. In social affairs it strengthens leaders. In religious affairs it
> adjusts mistakes and errors. It provides a powerful medicine to acquire the
> comforts of life. It makes the goal in life—old age—a possibility.483

Sandner interprets the true power of the Blessing Way with its prayers and songs as the
inner form or inner reality of all things that are connected to the earth rather than
connected with only the “rituals” of the Blessing Way ceremonies. During the first
Blessing Way ceremony at the Place of Emergence, First Man created the earth’s form
and the inner forms that became the Holy People, Long-Life Boy and Happiness Girl,
who symbolize

> happy conditions from the past into the present and future. They represent
> thought and speech, the supreme achievements of human life through which,

is not apparent.”485 In strong language, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addresses “superstitions” as
counter-productive to progress and humanity’s maturation:

> To such an extent has this [inherited “superstitions”] prevailed that they [religious
> leaders] have taken away the heavenly light of divine truth and sit in the darkness
> of imitations and imaginations. That which was meant to be conducive to life has
> become the cause of death; that which should have been an evidence of

counterfeit, neglecting and discarding holiness and the sacred reality of religion.

> It is the hour of unity of the sons of men and of the drawing together of all races
> and all classes. You are loosed from ancient superstitions which have kept men
> ignorant, destroying the foundation of true humanity.486

‘Abdu’l-Bahá further categorizes “superstitions” into “harmful and dangerous” and
“harmless with certain good results,” but qualifies “superstitions” with this positional
statement:

The fourth teaching of Bahá’u’lláh is the agreement of religion and science. God
> has endowed man with intelligence and reason whereby he is required to
> determine the verity of questions and propositions. If religious beliefs and
> opinions are found contrary to the standards of science they are mere superstitions
> and imaginations; for the antithesis of knowledge is ignorance, and the child of

It may be that Alfred’s not speaking his brother’s name aloud because of cultural
tradition falls into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s category of harmless “superstition,” or perhaps mental

health professionals might see it as falling into Kaplan and Johnson’s category of
potential mental disturbances, but in any regard, most knowledgeable non-Diné Bahá’ís
continue to respect the Diné tradition of not speaking a departed Diné’s name aloud to the
Diné. The Diné use other relational terms to refer to the deceased person, as did Diné
Bahá’í Linda Wilson in her interview when talking about her recently deceased
mother.488 For Alfred, who was raised as a traditional Diné but also raised as a Bahá’í, to
daringly say his brother’s name aloud for the first time many years after his brother’s
death demonstrates one change in his “nature of reality” that becoming Bahá’í
requires.489 As the observer riding in Alfred’s pickup truck when this incident occurred, I
felt it showed disrespect to assume that I could say Alfred’s brother’s name aloud to him
just because Alfred had said it in his epiphany moment. That moment of transition, a leap
of faith between old ways and new teachings, belonged solely to Alfred, Sr.

Peyote

I argued earlier in my introduction that Diné Bahá’ís are not religiously mandated
to give up most of their traditional beliefs. I carefully chose “most” as my qualifying
word. Peyote, a small cactus native to southwestern Texas and central Mexico, is a
hallucinogenic drug used predominately in the Native American Church.490 The history
and controversies that surround the use of peyote, well documented by other researchers,
do not need to be restated here.491 I focus on the Bahá’í position regarding peyote as it

refers to maintaining or giving up of traditional beliefs by Diné Bahá’ís. The Universal
House of Justice refers to Shoghi Effendi’s reaffirmation of Bahá’u’lláh’s position on the
use of hallucinogens such as peyote:

> One of the requirements for a “chaste and holy life” is “total abstinence from
> opium and from similar habit-forming drugs,” such as heroin, hashish, and
> marijuana or hallucinogenic agents such as LSD, peyote and similar substances . .

> spiritual virtues of the hallucinogens . . . spiritual stimulation should come from
> turning one’s heart to Bahá’u’lláh and not through physical means such as drugs
> and agents.492

Bahá’í scholar and medical doctor Moojan Momen provides two cautionary notes
to the discussion of hallucinogens and the religious experience in The Phenomenon of
Religion: A Thematic Approach. First, Momen writes that the phenomena of
hallucinogens “probably cannot be used as the truth of religious experience,” even though
some religions have used or continue to use hallucinogens to attain altered states of
awareness or consciousness.493 Momen writes that features of an altered state of
consciousness, such as trances, the perceived passage of time, and a heightened sense of
mental arousal or a sense of mental stupor “are a general property of the
neurophysiological state induced in the brain, rather than the specific property of the
religious experience or the drugs themselves.”494 Second, Momen says scholars should
not prematurely conclude that the greatest victories of humanity’s progress are solely
from the field of science:

> The major advances in science involve jumps to a new framework, ‘paradigm
> shifts,’ as [Thomas] Kuhn called them, which come from a spark of inspiration
> welling up from the subconscious. For this to occur, the individual needs to be
> operating somewhere between the two extremes of everyday consciousness
> (where no sparks of inspiration come), on the one hand, and extreme hyper- or

hypo-arousal (where what is understood cannot be communicated), on the other.

> This medial position between the two extremes seems to be the position of
> humankind’s maximal creativity—the source of all of the greatest philosophy, art,
> science and religious thought.495

In addition to the Bahá’í prohibition against hallucinogenic drugs outside of
medicinal use, Bahá’ís are enjoined to obey the laws of the country in which they live:
“In all activities, Bahá’ís are expected to obey civil law and remain loyal to their
respective governments.”496 Peyote is an illegal substance in the United States for anyone
to use or possess, with the exception of American Indians who use peyote in specific
religious ceremonies and sanctioned with strict legal guidelines.497 Fully cognizant of the
passage of time it takes for some Bahá’ís to “live the life,” the Universal House of Justice
wrote a letter in 1963 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States: “Anyone
involved in the use of peyote should be told that in the Bahá’í Faith spiritual stimulation
comes from turning one’s heart to Bahá’u’lláh and not through any physical means. They
should therefore be encouraged to give up the use of peyote.” 498

The use of peyote is not traditional, in the sense that Dinés have not used peyote
for centuries, although other native peoples have in Mesoamerica, but rather peyote came
from Mexico through Texas and New Mexico onto reservations in the United States,
arriving in the “second half of the nineteenth century” and spreading “throughout the

newly-created Indian reservations.”499 The medicine men whom Sandner interviewed on
the Navajo reservation (beginning in 1968) “denied having any relationship between it
[peyote] and the traditional curing ceremonies.”500 Sandner quotes Denet Tsosi when
Tsosi said peyote “splits people up” and that when Tsosi learned his chants, “They were
the only thing being used by the Navaho. There was no such thing as peyote.”501 Another
of Sandner’s informants, chanter Natani Tso, said that when members of the Native
American Church came to see him, “they needed chant treatments like the others. There
is no connection between the two [chants and peyote].”502

Diné Bahá’ís can attest to Tsosi’s comment about peyote splitting up people
when a well-known and highly respected Diné Bahá’í resigned from a prominent position
in the religion to become a “roadman” responsible for overseeing peyote ceremonies held
in hogans.503 During the emotional and teary interview with this elderly Diné and his
family, he still proclaimed to “be a Bahá’í” and said he “had never stopped teaching the
Faith.”504 Religious Bahá’í symbols hung prominently on the walls in his home and he
offered his well-worn Bahá’í prayer book as proof that, in his eyes, he had remained a
Bahá’í. The details of what moved him to resign from his position remain confidential
and closed, but I suggest that this Diné’s becoming Bahá’í more fully took the greater
part of his adult life as he continued to work through finding resolutions to his life-course
challenges.505

According to research in the religion’s administrative literature, there are
administrative consequences for any Bahá’í who openly and publicly engages in acts
contrary to certain laws in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas by Bahá’u’lláh. One consequence is the
removal of administrative rights. This deprives him or her of being “in good standing”
and includes the loss of rights such as voting in Bahá’í elections, giving to the Bahá’í
funds, and attending Bahá’í Feasts. A letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada in 1948 stated that

> The deprivation of a person’s voting rights should only be resorted to when
> absolutely necessary, and a National Spiritual Assembly should always feel
> reluctant to impose this very heavy sanction which is a severe punishment. Of
> course sometimes, to protect the Cause, it must be done, but he feels that if the
> believer so deprived makes an effort to mend his ways, rectifies his mistake, or
> sincerely seeks forgiveness, every effort should be made to help him and enable
> him to reestablish himself in the Community as a member in good standing.506

Exercise of such rights constitutes a major portion of what it means to be an
active and participating Bahá’í in the life of the Bahá’í community. Conduct that may
cause a loss of administrative rights include flagrant use of alcohol, common law
marriage, promiscuity, disobedience to the Bahá’í laws regarding marriage, divorce, and
remarriage, and the use of illegal drugs. Personal behavior is an ongoing process of
bringing one’s behaviors and choices into alignment with the Bahá’í teachings in a life-
long process of becoming Bahá’í, whether public or private, whether active or inactive.
The Universal House of Justice urged NSAs to “work to avoid blanket rulings” without
extensive investigation into the issue at hand, and to allow ample time and opportunity
for those behaviors to be overcome by the Bahá’í in question:507

> Our teachings, as outlined in the Advent of Divine Justice, on the subject of living
> a chaste life, should be emphasized, but certainly no ruling whatsoever should be

laid down in this matter. The Bahá’ís have certainly not yet reached that stage of
> moral perfection where they are in a position to too harshly scrutinize the private
> lives of other souls, and each individual should be accepted on the basis of his
> faith, and sincere willingness to try to live up to the Divine Standards; further than
> this we cannot go at present.508

When a Bahá’í rectifies whatever action led to the loss of rights and wishes to be
reinstated into good standing, an application is made to the proper administrative
institution, which may then reinstate his or her administrative rights.509

I continue to argue that Diné Bahá’ís are allowed to practice their traditional
beliefs. As Sandner showed, the Diné organized their social/health system in such a way
as to identify those Diné who may be mentally ill or have character disorders. To say
Dinés should abstain from alcohol, for example, is not an act of depriving them of a
cultural tradition. I argue that giving up the use of peyote, a drug that was classified as a
Schedule I hallucinogen by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act
in 1970, should be held in no different light than Diné Bahá’ís giving up alcohol, and
would not constitute a lack of Diné Bahá’ís practicing their traditional ways.510

The Power of Rational Thought

The tensions Alfred Kahn, Sr. experienced from the conflict between culturally
sanctioned beliefs such as the belief in harmful ghosts and Bahá’í teachings on
“superstitions” took time and rational thought before those beliefs came into alignment
with the teachings of the new religion he had grown up in and accepted as an adult.
Change comes, Lincoln argues, not when groups or individuals use “knowledge to

challenge ideological mystification,” but rather when they “employ thought and
discourse,” which includes the modes of stories, symbols, and practices as effective
instruments of change.511 Bahá’í author John H. Hatcher explains in Close Connections:
The Bridge Between Physical and Spiritual Reality that the crucial power of rational
thought is the most essential means by which human beings function, and because of this
strong emphasis on rational thought, the power of the mind is greatly emphasized in
Bahá’í teachings as the principal means by which humans utilize their experiences in the
physical world.512 Hatcher says that the mind, defined as a “metaphysical reality,” uses
all the senses to investigate physical reality. He describes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s explanation of
physical and spiritual senses, or powers, as “speaking in terms of Aristotelian
philosophy”:513

> Man has also spiritual powers: imagination, which conceives things; thought,
> which reflects upon realities; comprehension, which comprehends realities:
> memory, which retains whatever man imagines, thinks, and comprehends. The
> intermediary between the five outward powers and the inward powers is the sense
> which they possess in common, that is to say, the sense which acts between the
> outer and inner powers, conveys to the inward powers whatever the outer powers
> discern. It is termed the common faculty, because it communicates between the
> outward and inward powers, and thus is common to the outward and inward
powers.514

It was Aristotle who listed and described the four outward senses of sight, smell,
hearing, and taste over 2,000 years ago.515 Psychology has since identified at least nine
physical senses by adding the five somasthetic senses of kinesthetic (sense of moving),
vestibular (orientation), touch (sensory), temperature (hot and cold), and pain (crucial to

survival). 516 Hatcher said that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá added “feeling” as a fifth outward sense, and
classified imagination, memory, comprehension, thought, and the “common faculty” as
the five inward spiritual powers or inward senses.517 Except for the unidentified
“common faculty,” psychologists view these four capacities as components of the brain
and mind but do not identify them as senses in particular. Psychologists Stephen M.
Kosslyn and Robin S. Rosenberg address the differences between “inner speech and
spoken thought” and explain that words are often ambiguous while thought is not—in
short, thought is not language. Rather, thought arises from a stream of stored-in-memory
visual mental images that allow the experience of inner “seeing with the mind’s eye” and
inner “hearing with the mind’s ear.”518

In addition, Kosslyn and Rosenberg argue, thought arises from unambiguous,
often abstract, internal representations termed concepts, which are neither images nor
words but groupings of objects (living or non-living) or events, including relationships
between individuals.519 Thought is clear and unambiguous while language is often
ambiguous—the concepts people hold in their heads are not always so easy to put into
words or to define even to themselves. According to Hatcher, Bahá’í theology identifies
soul as a non-local, non-material “rational being or mind” that translates metaphysical
ideas (concepts) through the brain’s capacities to send, receive, and process
information.520 This information in the form of concepts or metaphysical ideas flows “to
and from the inner self” on a stream of a bidirectional “common faculty” that translates

into “forms of action.”521 Alfred, Sr. saying his brother’s name out loud is a concrete
example of the power of rational thought in action. The ability, or willingness, to think
things through rationally carries the power to change outward actions and inward
attitudes. Such changes in thought and action take time to process. In the case of those
Diné becoming Bahá’í, change becomes a matter of education for both the Diné Bahá’ís
and their non-Diné counterparts who are trying to assist them in the process. In a training
session held around 1956 for Indian teaching, the participants were encouraged to use
wisdom:

> When enrolling new believers, we must be wise and gentle, and not place so many
> obstacles in their way that they feel it is impossible to accept the Faith. . . . Once
> accorded membership it must be brought home to them that they are expected to
> live up to His Teachings and to show forth the signs of a noble character. . . . This
> can be gradually, after the new believer is enrolled. . . . The essential thing is that
> the candidate for enrollment should believe in his heart in the truth of Bahá’u’lláh.
> Whether he is literate or illiterate, informed of all the Teachings or not, is beside
> the point entirely. When the spark of faith exists the essential Message is there,
> and gradually everything else can be added unto it. The process of educating
> people of different customs and backgrounds must be done with the greatest
> patience and understanding, and rules and regulations not imposed upon them,
> except where a rock-bottom essential is in question.522

A “rock-bottom essential” might be a new Bahá’í deliberately creating disunity
and disharmony within a Bahá’í community, or the public demonstration of drug use or
drunkenness, as discussed earlier. The essential point made in this statement accords with
an earlier statement that the Bahá’í teachings govern physical and spiritual areas of an
individual’s relationship to God, relations between individuals, and relations between the
individual and society. 523 How much a person can absorb of the teachings and how long

Blind Faith. Psychologist Raymond Paloutzian explores tensions between
dimensions of religious commitment, such as informed faith (knowledge) versus blind
faith (belief without knowledge), and consistency in belief versus a hypocritical believer
(effects of religion in practical life). Paloutzian writes that “intellectual conversions” are
changes in belief, “moral conversions” are changes in motivation, and “social
conversions” are changes in one’s actions toward the social environment.524
Paloutzian’s three dimensions of religious commitment through intellectual, moral, and
social changes in belief, motivation, and actions are necessary complements to Rambo’s
seven stages of conversion and represent natural processes of religious growth over time.
Some public or outward actions that define being an active Bahá’í are voting in elections,
serving in administrative capacities, attending Feasts, and providing service to others.
The inward or private actions and behaviors related to becoming Bahá’í are daily prayer,
observing the fasting period, giving to the Bahá’í fund, and daily reading or deepening in
the authorative writings of the religion. Alfred Kahn, Jr. gave voice to religious growth
through his belief, motivation, and actions, with service provided to others as an outward
sign of inward change:

> There are many stages of development but that highest stage of development
> is in service to all mankind. It’s not about this worldly power. It’s not about

Alfred, Jr. discusses his life-course challenges, his boulders-in-the-road of
becoming Bahá’í as he acknowledges the need to travel through “many stages of
development.” Without using the term, Alfred sees reciprocity as a “humble mode of
learning,” and identifies social and religious issues as an excessive materialistic need for
“earthly power” instead of “spiritual dignity.” In a moment of honesty and levity, Alfred
defends his Diné culture as having “spiritual loftiness”— even when they raided Pueblos
every day, “life was [still] a prayer.”526

Sociologists Richard A. Snow and Richard Machalek have written that a number
of scholars suggest that something much more fundamental than beliefs and identities
change when one undergoes conversion. Rather, there is a change in one’s “sense of
ultimate grounding” or “root reality” and a paradigm shift in the “informing aspect” of
one’s life, termed as a “universe of discourse.”527 Conversion fundamentally and
significantly displaces one universe of discourse for another and raises it to the status of a
primary authority, making the universe of discourse “discernible in a convert’s speech

and reasoning.” Snow and Machalek said that the notion of radical change remains at the
core of all conceptions of conversion, whether theological or social scientific, but beyond
this point the consensus vanishes—not only are social scientists “uneasy” about the
theological association of conversion with the idea of a deity or an enlightened state, but
they also disagree about the “precise” nature of the change that is involved in religious
conversion.528

Running the gauntlet of acceptance or rejection of religious conversion, social
scientists have historically moved away from the position of an open religious belief,
beginning with Freud in the early 1900s after Freud’s statement that religion is the
“universal obsessional neurosis of humanity” and because of the necessary injunction of
empirical sciences to have evidence and provide proof before acceptance of theory as
fact.529 Historian of religions Daniel L. Pals notes that both Freud and Marx thought
religion was not only false but pathological, unhealthy, and dysfunctional, a “kind of
disease people needed to be cured of.”530 Psychiatrist H. B. Danesh wrote that,
nevertheless, Freud spoke of his own struggles to achieve greater self-awareness. In
Freud’s defense, Danesh quotes Bruno Bettelheim’s comment that “the English rendition
of Freud’s writings distorts much of the essential humanism that permeates the originals.”

\[531\] Bettelheim points out that in the original German, Freud put emphasis on the first part
of the word psychoanalysis, saying that the “Psyche is the soul—a term full of the richest
meaning.”532 The English translation put the emphasis on analysis, and the enormous

significance of the fact that psychiatry and psychology is dealing with the soul, Danesh
says, is generally ignored. These distortions, presented in “depersonalized and
dehumanized scientific language,” moved psychoanalysis away from its original goal of
“reflective introspection” to schools of psychiatry and psychology that are behaviorally,
cognitively, or physiologically oriented, concentrating mostly on what can be measured
or observed from the outside.533 Pals writes that, while researchers can continue to
investigate and interpret all the varieties of religious structures, the range of evidence for
a comprehensive theory of religion will remain insufficient and current theorists wonder
if “science” is a term that can continue to be used simultaneously with religious
studies.534

Mathematician and Bahá’í scholar William S. Hatcher provides a model of the
basic categories of existence, with reality divided into subjective and objective
categories. Hatcher says that “any increase in knowledge will be reflected by some
change in one’s internal states, and usually in one’s conscious internal states.”535 Hatcher
refers to the Bahá’í principle that science and religion will come into agreement over the
course of time, with an acknowledgement of “authentic religious belief” that is not
simply a product of blind faith:536

true religion and authentic religious belief is not the love of mystery or “blind
> faith” but the love of discovering the pearls of wisdom that explain reality, resolve
> mysteries, and make clear the divine rationale for natural law and for the
> integration of these dual, reciprocal aspects of reality.537

I argue that, rather than demonstrating blind faith, the idea of a “divine rationale
for natural law” was a relatively easy concept for Diné Bahá’ís to grasp, based on their
acceptance of the Twin Manifestations of the Bahá’í Faith as the return of their mythical
Warrior Twins and on the chief with twelve feathers in the seventh Navajo chant as
representing Bahá’u’lláh with his twelve basic principles of religion. Hatcher’s dual,
reciprocal aspects of reality agree with Geertz’s explanation that “a cluster of sacred
symbols” (similar to those found in both Diné eschatological narratives) “woven into
some sort of ordered whole” creates the religious system for that particular culture. It is
only common sense, Geertz said, because “between ethos and worldview, between the
approved style of life and the assumed structure of reality, there is conceived to be a
simple and fundamental congruence such that they complete one another and lend one
another meaning.”538

The prophecies of the Warrior Twins and the Unity Chants, in conjunction with
the appearance of the Bahá’í Faith on the Navajo reservation, through a simple and
fundamental congruence completed one another for the Diné who became Bahá’ís and
gave meaning each to the other through the process of conversive discourse, in which the
internal changes of conversion became outwardly “discernible in the convert’s speech

and reasoning.”539 Johnny Nelson not only gave credence, in his interview, to
discernment in speech and reasoning at the Great Council Fire, but he also stated that
discernment brought a belief in the reality of the Bahá’í Faith “even though I’m a Navajo,
but somehow the languages were all, practically all the same. You can understand what
they were talking about. So there was something there that made us [gain] our belief in
[Bahá’í] reality. That’s how we became a Bahá’í.”540

CHAPTER EIGHT
TRANSFORMATION: SACRED SYMBOL, SACRED SOUND

De Ramírez writes that scholars have begun to investigate explicitly the
importance of the transformative effects that storytelling (such as the Navajo Chants and
the Warrior Twins) and conversations (similar to those the participants had at the Great
Council Fire Unity Conference) bring about through people’s interactions. According to
de Ramírez, through story-telling and conversive conversations, our life experiences and
their meanings are created and re-created, formed and reformed; constructing and
reconstructing selves and realities along the way, “conversive communication in the form
of story-telling is perhaps humanity’s primary tool for changing reality.”544 De Ramírez
reminds us that, before the advent of the Bahá’í Faith, the other great world religious
systems had emerged within vibrant oral traditions but also within widespread illiteracy:
“Originating in an increasingly literate and textually oriented world, whose respective
oral traditions have been variously receding into distant memory, the Bahá’í Faith
emphasizes the crucial role of sacred orality for the relational harmonics [vibrational
sacred sound] that bring persons together.”545

The ancient Diné understood the power of transformative vibrational sound and
elevated it to the status of knowledge. In Diné cosmology, the world and everything in it
are composed of four primary elements necessary for existence on any level: moisture,
air, substance, and heat. Zolbrod explains that the twelve levels of knowledge,
constructed of these same fundamental elements, are permeated by the fifth element of
vibration as sound necessary to maintain life. Diné applied the concept of sacred sound,

\[544\] De Ramírez, “The Conversive Turn,”41-42. De Ramírez cites folklorist Karl Kroeber.

\[545\] Ibid., “The Conversive Turn,” 28-29.

recreated from the four fundamental elements, to items that were necessary for their
comfort, safety, and life in the forms of cradle-boards, baskets, foods such as corn pollen
and cornbread, looms, hogans, language, movement, and life cycles.546 The concept of
sound as vibration and movement permeates all things, felt and unfelt, seen and unseen,
heard and unheard. Sandner, along with Geertz, frames “symbol” as any “thing” that
functions as a carrier for a concept:

> The carrier or vehicle may be a world, a mathematical notation, an act, a gesture,
> a ritual, a dream, a work of art, or any ‘thing’ that can carry a concept. The
> concept may be a rational-linguistic one, an imaginal-intuitive one, or a feeling-
> evaluative one. It makes no difference as long as the symbol carries it effectively.
> The concept is the symbol’s meaning. Language is the first kind of symbolism
> that has a specific, sequential structure which is termed discursive. 547

De Ramírez defines the differences between Sandner’s discursive communication
as a carrier of symbols and conversive communication, explaining that “the concept and
practice of [discursive] discourse presumes a separation [of transmitter and receiver] that
is bridged by language and logic.” Conversive communication, on the other hand, says de
Ramírez, “reflects the dual aspects of conversation and conversion” (emphasis mine):548

> The conversative aspect is an essentially collaborative, intersubjective and
> relational co-creative articulation that brings diverse persons and elements of the
> world together . . . that signifies the transformative capacity of language to
> transform persons (human and non-human) and worlds through the deep unifying
> power of deep interpersonal connections.549

Unfortunately, Sandner (1979) was not privy to de Ramírez’s (2007) conversive twist of
the tongue, or Sandner surely would have changed “language is the first kind of
symbolism that has a specific, sequential structure which is termed discursive” to the
more-inclusive conversive, because just as surely, conversive describes much more fully

the Diné’s concept of sound as vibration. Within that sound, seen as a symbol and as a
concept, lies not only a fuller description of Annie Kahn’s conversive-conversion
interpretation of the Navajo chants but also an answer for Alfred Kahn, Sr.’s
metaphysical dream-conversation with his brother through the worlds of “human and
non-human” communication so openly included by de Ramírez.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s relational elements of cooperation and reciprocity, “essential
properties which are inherent in the unified system of the world of existence, and without
which the entire creation would be reduced to nothingness,” can be added to the Diné’s
twelve levels of knowledge.550 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained that the mind functions as the
“all-unifying agency” that unites all the component parts [of the mind and brain] with
each other so that functions are “in perfect order and thereby cooperation and reaction
[through reciprocity, the common faculty] are made possible.”551 As stated previously,
everything in existence remains in some state of ongoing transformation, of vibration,
and of movement. Nothing remains static—it either decays or grows, either goes forward
or goes backwards. De Ramirez, addressing certain decaying forms of communication,
clarifies the Bahá’í position:

> Bahá’u’lláh makes it very clear that all the sacred traditions of the world
> throughout time have advocated deeply relational and transforming
> communications, but that, today, not only do the majority of people not
> communicate conversively, but that many have even forgotten how to do so,
> instead communicating in the more efficient, yet superficial, manner of discourse
> in which communications stay at the level of ratiocinative [logical] thought,
> personal opinion, and emotional response.552

Zolbrod found that most Diné were cooperative but hostile to having their oral
stories written down—Dinés believed that if the old culture was dying out, the traditional
stories should die with it; stories could not be recited properly because “words on a page
were silent and unalive.”553 Dinés realized the difficulty of capturing the vibration of
sound and movement on something as inanimate as a sheet of paper, a “substance” made
of wood, reed, or bark. In Diné bahané, Zolbrod uses a poetic English idiom appropriate
to Diné oral tradition to retain the social and religious significance of the original stories.
Speech, Zolbrod says, is the highest human faculty in the Diné hierarchy of things—the
final line in a chantway prayer demonstrates the importance of having voice: “shiné
sháádiħł— my voice for me restore.”554 Restoring the highest human faculty equals a full
recovery, a return to well-being and a removal of whatever “spell” one is caught in.
Alfred, Jr. had to find his voice—not only to become Bahá’í but to become Navajo, too:

> I think I identify myself as Navajo and I believe in a lot of the traditional ways but

Alfred, Jr.’s statement that “it’s the rest of the story,” a continuation, refers to the
Bahá’í tenet of progressive revelation, in which the major religious systems are one

continuing story throughout humanity’s history, occurring at different times in history, at
different geographical places in the world, and appearing with different great teachers or
Manifestations who bring their own holy books, laws, and social changes needed to
update and move humanity forward.556 Alfred, Jr. had to internalize (as he states) this
particular aspect of the Bahá’í teachings, or he would not be able to accept the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh as the return of the Diné Warrior Twins. Not being able to accept would of
necessity create religious, psychological, emotional, and spiritual tensions and confusion
within Alfred, Jr., eventually turning him away from the Bahá’í Faith because of the
disharmony within himself.

Alfred, Jr.’s acceptance, internalization, and voiced acknowledgement of his
belief in the Bahá’í Faith signify the outward and inward changes associated with what
psychologists in particular define as a true conversion. Without some signs of inward and
outward change in behavior, speech, thought, action, most psychological models
determine that a true or genuine conversion experience has not occurred. These changes
in internal states of being manifested in even slight outward signs of change usually
signal true conversion, significantly evident in the convert’s universe of discourse,
whether discursive or conversive. The ancient oral story of the Warrior Twins along with
the Navajo chants were effective instruments of change for Diné Bahá’ís, as seen
evidenced in their speech, language, and behavior. I argue that becoming Bahá’í for Diné
Bahá’ís, which, logically, incorporated some of the phenomenological aspects from the
other religious conversion models I have discussed, can be found in relationship between
the Diné Bahá’ís two eschatological narratives with their many symbols and the teachings
of the Twin Manifestations that vibrate within important components of the Diné
traditional belief system for those Diné who “became Bahá’í.”

CHAPTER NINE
CLOSURE: BEING “WHO I AM”

I know of no other work focused on the tradition-transition conversion experience
of Diné Bahá’ís. Questions, objections, and alternative views must of necessity arise from
this early research that cannot and does not respond to all of them. This case study has
focused exclusively on the event of the Great Council Fire Unity Conference as a starting
point for conversion to the Bahá’í Faith among the Diné and on the oral stories that
served as eschatological narratives. A study of early Bahá’í literature assessed the amount
of outreach from Bahá’í home-front pioneers to the Diné and the resultant religious
matrix created from that outreach process. Research and comparisons in the fields of
psychology, anthropology, and sociology demonstrated significant signs of Diné
becoming Bahá’í as manifested through religious ideology and religious imagery, as
reported through an analysis of the eschatological narratives, through interviews with
Diné Bahá’ís, and through observing activity at the Native American Bahá’í Institute on
the Navajo reservation.

There are many layers yet unexplored in Diné mythology that may match up with
the Bahá’í message of return, renewal, and a new age to come, including another set of
twins and a prophecy about a crystal hogan that matches up with the quartz-embedded
Bahá’í “Mother Temple of the West” built on the shores of Lake Michigan near
Chicago.557 The columns by the sides of the nine entrances to the Temple include a

The swastika was turned by Hitler, literally by flipping the swastika directionally away
from its ancient form and figuratively by turning it into one of the world’s most dreaded
war symbols. Believed to be 6000 years old and originating in India, in response to
Hitler’s usurpation of the sacred symbol, the Diné, Papago, Apache, and Hopi leaders
signed a whirling log proclamation in 1940 that read,

> Because the above ornament, which has been a symbol of friendship among our
> forefathers for many centuries, has been desecrated recently by another nation of
> peoples, therefore it is resolved that henceforth from this date on and forever more
> our tribes renounce the use of the emblem commonly known today as the
> swastika . . . on our blankets, baskets, art objects, sand paintings and clothing.559

For the Diné, the swastika depicts the whirling log with a male and female Yé’is, or
“dreaming twins” at the end of each arm (See Appendix F-1).560 The dreaming twins,
which may serve as a representation of the Diné Monster Slayers (the Warrior Twins) and
therefore serve as representations of the Twin Manifestations (the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh)

for Diné Bahá’ís, who accept the Twin Manifestations as the return of the Monster
Slayers, are positioned on the outstretched arms of the swastika that once was a symbol
for friendship and now is the symbol of a world that was gripped by violence.

I was caught by surprise when, in a pause toward the end of Alfred, Jr.’s
interview, he quite suddenly and indignantly exclaimed,

> I don’t think you can say Bahá’u’lláh isn’t the One for today because we have this
> prophesy of the Crystal Hogan. If you have ever heard of Wilmette, it has a
> Hogan for the North American continent brought by the Bahá’ís and it is made
> out of quartz. And it’s round in shape and it accepts people of all religions. And
> it’s a House of Worship built on the North American continent. So that’s a
> fulfillment of that same prophesy of the Crystal Hogan we are waiting for. . . .
> We’re looking for the Crystal Hogan and the Twin Manifestations [that will]
> come with the Message.561

Just as suddenly, it was not me alone, the quietly listening emic interviewer with whom
Alfred, Jr. was conversing, but Alfred was conversing with his inner self, as well. De
Ramirez says conversive responses engage not only with scripture as sacred symbol, but
also with sacred sound voiced at the deeper levels of heart and spirit while listening
deeply to what has been heard, read, or experienced in contemplative and meditative
ways that open the self to “empathic and spiritualized understandings.”562 Moments and
periods of silences, akin to the pauses and ahmms naturally occurring in the speech of
Alfred’s father and uncle, are the keys to unlocking the door of this process in which
thoughts and feelings are “given deep consideration at the level of the heart, enabling the
understanding that comes from inspiration and insight.”563 De Ramirez credits the work
of Diné scholar and poetess Luci Tapahonso when she says that many indigenous writers
and thinkers affirm that part of the conversive process is “inherently relational,” as hearts

join in love and affection—“heart alone can communicate to heart the state of the
knower.”564

As stated earlier, it was to be expected that some American Indians would convert
to Christianity due to the assimilation process since contact, but the same expectation
does not hold true for other religious systems. American Indians attend their own Native
American Church; join the Catholic Church (as Chester Kahn and Linda Wilson did in
boarding school); become members of one or more of the Protestant denominations; or
they choose to remain traditional or secular with no affiliation to any outside religious
system. Again, there are no known cases of an American Indian choosing to convert to
Buddhism or Judaism, although both of these religions have ties of friendship to the
American Indian community as members of the international family of tribal cultures—
Buddhists monks, in particular, are welcomed and honored guests on the reservations
they visit.

What was the motivation for and through what means did hundreds of Diné
readily choose to enter over a short period of time and without coercion of any sort into a
new religion previously unknown to them is the question posed, argued, and answered in
this work. The Diné Bahá’ís told their stories with verve and passion about their ongoing
process of becoming Bahá’í. They expressed without hesitation belief in their own
prophecies and skillfully demonstrated the power of rational thought. In the milieu of the
interview context, each informant communicated conversively with an attitude of trust.
Each person shared poignant memories and experiences of how they see themselves as
Diné. Each one told what it means to him or her to be a Diné Bahá’í and what it means to

be included as participating and welcomed members of the collective Bahá’í family.
Alfred Kahn, Sr. moved toward closure with these words:

> Ahmm . . . to me . . . it’s ah . . . it’s still taken time for people to live together,
> understand each other. It’s the languages; it’s the communication that’s different.
> We’re all different. There might be somebody out there or even in here that would
> totally go against the Faith or even my own tradition. You know there is some
> prejudices still and differences–all the ‘isms’ like we say, ahmm . . . classism,
> maybe. And somebody might dislike me because I’m wearing old tennis shoes
> and long, not long ‘Injn’ hair, excuse me, Indian hair. But it doesn’t bother me. It
> gives me power. So it doesn’t bother me a bit. So, I’m here being who I am.565

Alfred Kahn, Sr.’s being who he is fits Geertz’s statement that the worldview of a
people or an individual is “sheer actuality”; a picture of the way things are, one’s concept
of nature, self and society; one’s worldview that contains one’s most comprehensive
ideas of order.566 Such ideas of comprehensive order appear to have been severely tested
over Vine Deloria, Jr.’s lifetime before his passing in 2005. American Indian, historian,
theologian, lawyer, and educator who had taught at the University of Arizona, Deloria’s
words contained within his prolific writings rage discursively against the losses and
injustices of conquest while at the same time he conversively tries to re-find “mankind’s
life story” in those same textual articulations.

I do not know if Deloria had ever heard of Annie Kahn’s Navajo chants, the
Warrior Twins, or the Bahá’í Faith—or if it would have made any difference in his
worldview if he had. It seems likely that such a renowned scholar and activist as Deloria
would have examined all three in his investigations of the tensions between religion(s)
and culture(s). In God Is Red (1973) Deloria exemplified Geertz’s statement by

questioning nature, self, and society, and sallied forth with the existential question of the
twenty-first century:

> Can we survive increasing speed and constant migration and hold the same
> religious convictions about the world that men held two centuries ago? Or even a
> century ago? Or even in the previous decade? Almost everywhere we turn, we are
> confronted with the necessity of renewing our vision of the totality of our

> ecologists find a predictable life-span of a generation separating us from total
> extinction, it would seem that we have a duty to search for another interpretation
> of mankind’s life story instead of the traditional Christian view of the world and
> what it means. Unless we solve some of our problems, God will have to intervene
> to save any of us.567

Muscogee (Creek) James Treat, in his introduction to Deloria’s For This Land: Writings
on Religion in America, picked up the sound of Deloria’s cry from God Is Red and
revoiced it from the far end of the twentieth century with a reverberatory accusation
hurled toward what he saw as a scientific and intellectual lack of movement:

> We are actually in the midst of a “Dark Age” of intellectual activity. The
> Darwinian-Freudian-Marxist synthesis that has dominated the century has long
> since come apart but Americans refuse to admit it. We have a duty to move beyond
> it—ethical demands of personal integrity require it—but I see almost no one
> willing to undertake such a task or even to nibble at the edges of the current
> synthesis to begin a critique. All this hesitancy while the hard sciences are
returning study after study that contradicts this synthesis.568

W. Hatcher writes that, in the mid-nineteenth century, Bahá’u’lláh had urged the
peoples of the world to “be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and
center your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.”569 The concerns that
Deloria voiced and Treat echoed, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded to from the early twentieth
century, long before their questions were necessary to ask. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá advocated that

\[569\] Hatcher and Martin, Bahá’í Faith, 204. Hatcher quotes Bahá’u’lláh cited in The Prosperity of
Humankind (New York: Bahá’í International Community, 1995), 4-5.

humanity needs a spiritual educator because, without spiritual education, humankind
becomes “lower than an animal” in thought and action. Material education, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said, develops completeness of “intelligence and thought” and complements spiritual
education so that comprehension, using intellectual senses or powers, can “penetrate the
metaphysical world” and receive the “sanctifying breeze of the Holy Spirit.”570

Zolbrod explained that in the Diné hierarchy of things, speech is the highest
human faculty. Speech, articulated into words, is composed of vibrational sounds that
penetrate both the material and the metaphysical worlds and change the condition of the
listener. De Ramirez introduced the concept of spiritualized conversive communications
among individuals and between individuals and the divine as “crucial” to the
“transformations of lives and cultures”; and she informs her readers that Bahá’u’lláh
makes it abundantly clear that “human utterance is the most powerful means for human
transformation.”571

The Diné’s eschatological narratives (human utterances) contained ancient
material and spiritual education that, when placed in the context of the Bahá’í Faith by
the Diné at the Great Council Fire Unity Conference through significant conversive
conversations, became the most powerful means for the Diné to engage as participants in
the new religion, which fulfilled their own prophecies and allowed those who chose to do
so to begin the transformative process of becoming both Diné and Bahá’í.

EPILOGUE: SYNTHESIS

Nancy Phillips provides a description of the Great Council Fire Unity Conference
in her AISC report in August, 1962:

> Millions of stars lighted the sky on the evening of June 1. Bahá’ís and non-
> Bahá’ís, peoples of many nations, had begun to gather from the world over to join
> in all the activities and to live the life of our beloved Faith. The preparation of the
> sacred Navajo cake, to be shared by all present, had begun on this beautiful
> evening. The traditional cake was wrapped in corn husks and baked in a pit of hot
> stones in the earth. It was first blessed with traditional Navajo prayer by beautiful
> “Mother,” by the menfolk, the children and the guests who had began to arrive—
> each one blessing the Mother Earth and the Father Sky. The fire for baking the
> cake was kept aglow through the night by willing Navajo hands. After weeks of
> preparation and yearning for this oneness-of-mankind conference, the day had
> finally come. The Saturday noon meal, of traditional mutton stew, delicious
> Navajo fry bread, coffee, and the sacredly-prepared Navajo cake, was served to
> over a thousand people. All who were there were enlightened and deeply touched
> by the wonder of the gathering, and of being served in the spirit of love by our
> non-Bahá’í Navajo friends. To simply say that this conference—these ‘different
> races gathering with prayer’—was a success is far from adequate, as any words
> would be, because all felt the presence of the Great Spirit—a feeling which
> “transcends words and letters.”572

Phillips refers to a prayer by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá when she describes the mystical feeling that
the Unity Conference generated in its participants: “Reveal then Thyself, O Lord, by Thy
merciful utterance and the mystery of Thy divine being, that the holy ecstasy of prayer
may fill our souls - a prayer that shall rise above words and letters and transcend the
murmur of syllables and sounds - that all things may be merged into nothingness before
the revelation of Thy splendor.”573 When closing his interview, I asked Alfred Kahn, Sr.,
to express his final thoughts, words, or stories about his spiritual journey:

> Can you think of any stories you might like to tell or share along this path, this
> spiritual path that has re-invigorated your Faith or reaffirmed it, re-established it?

One thing in religious studies we find is people often move around, change and go

from one religion to another, one church or another. Have you personally ever felt
> the need to explore other religions or can you tell me about that? I know that in
> the Bahá’í Faith there is a principle that you are to consort with other people of
> other religions, be friends with them; not be prejudiced against them. But
> personally, what has your spiritual journey been like as far as maintaining your
> Navajo Bahá’í identity?574

Alfred responds to my question about feeling a need to explore other religions in his
now-familiar contemplative way, reaffirming yet one more time who he really is—both a
traditional Diné and a “declared” Baha’i:

Ahmm . . . . Well, ahmm . . . like I’ve been saying, you know, carrying corn
> pollen is who I am and that’s how I was taught by my mother and dad . . . late
> mother and father. I still carry my corn pollen with me. Ahmm . . . I’m still a
> Navajo, Diné, and my arrowhead [is] with me at all times like I was taught by my
> parents and grandparents. Ahmm . . . and then saying I’m a declared Bahá’í and
> trying to obey the laws of the Faith. And saying what He says just share about the
> Faith and that it’s okay that you are here in this Hogan, praying with different
> Christians. It’s okay. It doesn’t bother me and it doesn’t bother them. And we’re
> fine. And we just pray together and share some of the Bahá’í Writings and
> Teachings.575

APPENDICES

Appendix A. IRB Approval Letter

Appendix B. Interpretation of Ancient Navajo Chants by Annie Kahn

First Chant: He who is the all wise, all knowing, brought to the Navajo people
something like a Holy Book except that the Navajo could not write at that time so he
gave it to them in the form of chanting. To chant is to speak in rhymes like poetry so that
the ancient wisdom is remembered longer. This chanting is like the Holy Scriptures. It
tells the Indians what to look for at the Time of the End when He would come to the
people again.
Second Chant: One of the Holy Medicine Men said the Time of the End is like two more
stages to climb forward: first is to have the Spirit of the people live again, and second, the
people shall melt into one, meaning that true love between people will be practiced. In
the chanting He (the Great Spirit) has said that He is expected in the east, but also in the
west. As He comes and brings these good things of the spirit and of love it will be the
most happy and glorious occasion.
Third Chant: The melting into one is like the wonderful feeling of the Navajo girl when
she falls in love and says of her beloved: “Hey John! Oh, I melt when I see him!” But the
love of the Great Spirit and of mankind that comes in the New Day is so great that all the
world’s afflictions and dangers can in no way alarm us or hurt us.
Fourth Chant: In the chants it says that when this New Day comes to us it is like the
birth of a new baby, like a mother bringing her new baby home from the hospital.
Everyone in that home cries: “Let me hold the baby!” Even the grandmothers, even down
to the little ones, all cry: “Let me hold the baby; it is so clean; it is so fresh; it is so
wonderful!” So the new religion is clean and fresh in the same way because it has none
of the prejudices and misunderstandings that the older religions have accumulated down
through the centuries.
Fifth Chant: The New Faith comes also to the Indians like the Sun at dawn. As the sun
rises it touches the peaks and buttes first with its light; then slowly it moves down into
the canyons. The light is at first visible only to a few who are awake, high up and
watching. Some of the Navajo and other Indian peoples are like people down in a deep
canyon. They are listening for the Voice of the Great Creator, but they do not know
where to look for it yet because the dark shadows blind them. But there are some Indians
who are as if they are on the mountain tops and they begin very early to dance and sing
with joy when they see the Glory coming.
Sixth Chant: The fact that a new Light is said to come like the dawn warns us that, even
as the early sunlight rises up through the mists of morning and slowly drives away the
dark shadows of the canyons, so the coming of the New Teaching will not be widely
visible at first, but will reach in its beginnings only those whose spiritual eyes and ears
are open. It is taught, however, in the chants that even the people down in the dark
canyons will hear the Voice of the Great Spirit and they will search for Him until they
also receive the Light of the New Day. Many of the Navajo people now believe that this

glorious light has come, but we must seek it out with understanding hearts, even as lost
children see for their father in the wilderness.
Seventh Chant: The chants say that there are two signs of the New Spirit that all the
people should look for. The first sign is a Nine-Pointed Star that must come from the east.
The number nine is the sign of the highest unity, for all numbers can be found in this one
number, and so all religions and races and nations will come together in love and unity
under the sign of the Nine-Pointed Star. Another sign of this coming is that there will be
a great chief in the east who will wear (symbolically) a headdress with twelve feathers.
The chants say these twelve feathers mean twelve great principles that He will bring to
mankind. If we search carefully we will find that these twelve principles of world unity
have already come to the world and, even in this day, are beginning to bring people
together in unity, understanding and love.
Eighth Chant: In the Unity Chant the Great One says He will come like the dawn and
like the Shepherd who gathers His flock and brings all the wandering sheep back together
again. In the Day of Unity you will walk in beauty; the beauty will walk before you; the
beauty will walk behind you; you will be surrounded by beauty. Through the beautiful
writings of a new Prophet of God, these meanings will become very clear. Man himself
in this New Age has found ways to create beauty. With all these beautiful things we must
now have beautiful minds. With beautiful minds we will talk in beauty. The speech of all
men will be in beauty.
Ninth Chant: Again in another place in the chants He says that those who speak with
beautiful speech will lead the world to beauty and He says the center of this beautiful
speech comes from a Holy Mountain. What is the most Holy Mountain in the world? Is it
not Mt. Carmel in the Holy Land where the Bible says (in Isaiah 35:1-2) “the excellency
of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord”? This is closely linked with
the Promised Day of the New Spirit when “the desert shall rejoice, and blossom like the
rose.” Today, Mount Carmel, which, only a few decades ago was nothing but desert, in
now being covered with beautiful gardens. From there we are beginning to hear the
Message of Beauty and of the Spirit that is awakening the World. So are the prophecies
of all peoples of the Day of Unity is being fulfilled.576
