                           INFORMATION TO USERS

This was produced from a copy of a document sent to us for microfilming. While the
most advanced technological means to photograph and reproduce this document
have been used, the quality is heavily dependent upon the quality of the material
submitted.
The following explanation of techniques i3 provided to help you understand
markings or notations which may appear on this reproduction.
1. The sign or "target" for pages apparently lacking from the document

> photographed is "Missing Pagets)", If it was possible to obtain the missing
> page(s) or section, they are spliced into the film along with adjacent pages.
> This may have necessitated cutting through an image and duplicating
> adjacent pages to assure you of complete continuity.
2. When an image on the film is obliterated with a round black mark it is an

> indication that the film inspector noticed either blurred copy because of
> movement during exposure, or duplicate copy. Unless we meant to delete
> copyrighted materials that should not have been filmed, you will find a
> good image of the page in the adjacent frame.
3. When a map, drawing or chart, etc., is part of the material being photo-

> graphed the photographer has followed a definite method in "sectioning"
> the rnarerial. It is customary to begin filming at the upper left hand corner
> of a large sheet and to continue from left to right in equal sections with
> small overlaps. If necessary, sectioning is continued again-beginning
> below the first row and continuing on until complete.
4. For any illustrations that cannot be reproduced satisfactorily by

> xerography, photographic prints can be purchased at additional cost and
> tipped into your xerographic copy. Requests can be made to our
> Dissertations Customer Services Department.
5. Some pages in any document may have indistinct print. In all cases we

have filmed the best available copy.

ABSTRACT

Since its beginning in 1844, the Baha'i Faith has spread to all
parts of the non-Communist world.       At first, the religion was confined
to Persia and Iraq where Shi'ah Islam is daminant, but after Baha'u'llah
(Prophet-founder of the religion) was banished to distan"t parts of the
Ottoman Empire the movement was able to penetrate many areas of the
Sunni world as well.      In 1893 the religion was transmitted to North
America from where, over a period of six decades, a vigorous campaign
of global dissemination was undertaken.       By 1953, the religion was well
established on all continents; thereafter, global diffusion proceeded
from a number of widely distributed centers of the religion rather than
from just the t\vO older core areas (Persia and North America).

The Baha'i Faith has always pursued an expansionist policy con-
sisting of   thr~e   main strategies:   numerical increase, geographical
dispersion, and compositional diversity of the membership.       In the early
years, growth was generally encouraged by the charismatic leaders of the
religion, but from 1919 on expansion was directed by definitive and
authoritative plans embodying the three main strategies for growth.
These plans have become broader and more detailed in the past few
decades so that today Baha'i expansion is guided by very precise objec-
tives for increasing the numbers and kinds of believers and for insuring
that they are widely dispersed.

The objective of this research has been to describe and account for
the gro\Vth and spread of the Baha'i Faith.      The religion has been

iv
considered as an innovation, and its dissemination has been viewed as a
consequence of its internal structure and decision-making patterns.           It
was found that a strong and centralized leadership has facilitated
diffusion, that religious beliefs have favored dissemination efforts,
and that policy and planning have successfully directed Baha'i expansion.

At the same time, the staging and direction of Baha'i expansion
frequently has been influenced by attitudes, conditions, and events
lying outside the direct control of the Baha'i movement.      For example,
in its early years the religion was geographically confined by its cul-
tural context and religious roots while later on political conditions
frequently influenced where the movement could and could not become
established.   In general, physical, social, and economic distance have
inhibited diffusion, but aggressive dissemination policies and ambitious
growth plans have greatly weakened the force of these traditional
resistors to diffusion.

Between 1893 and 1953 North America was the main geographic source
of Baha'i expansion.   Within this area, growth was substantial but not
constant.   In the first few decades there were alternating   period~;   of
growth and decline and only after the 1920s did the religion begin to
increase its membership at a steadily accelerating rate.      The capacity
of the movement to enlarge appears to have depended on unanimous ac-
ceptance of religious authority; growth proceeded regularly whenever the
leadership and the administrative order were recognized by all Baha'is,
but diffusion was curtailed whenever these repositories of religious
authority were questioned by a part of the religion's   rne~nbership.

v
Throughout the twentieth century, Baha'i growth in North America
has been dependent on conversions; natural increase has always been a
minor source of expansion.   Continent-wide dissemination of the religion
has relied heavily on migration of believers, usually from large urban
centers containing Baha'i concentrations to other locations where
believers have been few or absent.   This pattern has been strongly
encouraged and has resulted in a highly dispersed Baha'i community, a
condition which also exists at the global level.

PREFACE

Marzieh Gail's Baha'i Glossary contains a system of transliter-
ation for Persian and Arabic words to which, for purposes of uniformity,
I have generally adhered.   When quoting from other sources, however, I
have spelled words as they appeared in the original.

Publications issued by the Baha'i religion capitalize certain
words that, in other contexts, might be left in lower case letters.
Out of respect and gratitude for the way in which the Baha'i community
has assisted me with this study, I have adhered to the Baha'i traditions
regarding capitalization.

A tempest, unprecedented in its violence, unpredictable
in its course, catastrophic in its immediate effects, un-
imaginably glorious in its ultimate consequences, is at
present sweeping the face of the earth. Its driving power
is remorselessly gaining in range and momentum. Its
cleansing force, however much undetected, is increasing
with eve~7 passing day. Humanity, gripped in the clutches
of its devastating power, is smitten by the evidences of
its resistless fury. It can neither perceive its origin,
ncr probe its significance, nor discern its outcome.
Bewildered, agonized and helpless, it watches this great
and mighty wind of God invading the remotest and fairest
regions of the earth, rocking its foundations, deranging
its equilibrium, sundering its nations, disrupting the
homes of its peoples, wasting its cities, driving into
exile its kings, pUlling down its bulwarks, uprooting its
institutions, dimming its light, and harrowing up the souls
of its inhabitants.

INTRODUCTION

THE TOPIC OF STUDY

The Baha'i Faith is a monotheistic religion that originated in
Persia in the middle of the nineteenth century.       In its original form
it was a local phenomenon.    Many contemporary observers perceived it as
a reform movement--a reaction against the abuses of religious and
political authority that were widespread in Persia at that time.       Within
a few years, however, it became apparent that the movement was claiming
to be an independent religion founded by a Prophet of God.

Today the oaha'i Faith is a global movement.      The membership has
grown to include a few million believers scattered throughout the world;
the administrative system has created a Baha'i confederation with more
than 12') member states located on all the continents; the principles of
the Faith have increasingly stressed the need for world unity.       The
religion now believes that its own ultimate purpose and destiny are to
effect a spiritual unification of the planet.

How did the Baha'i Faith, born in adversity and raised in a specific
cultural tradition, overcome its original limitations to achieve the
status of an independent world religion?       To what extent has the trans-
formation been the consequence of Baha'i intent and Baha'i behavior?
In what ways have chance occurrences and historical conditions      fa~ilitated

the change?   These are   the kind::; of questions that will be addressed in
this study.   In short, the objective will be to describe and explain the
growth and spread of the Baha'i Faith.

The fundamental thesis underlying this investigation is that the
Baha'i Faith has managed its own development.   It will be documented
that the Faith has throughout its history used the spiritual authority
of its central figures and administrative order to achieve planned
global diffusion--an effort that has been successful not only in its
overall objective but also in dictating (1) the methods of diffusion to
be used, (2) the timing of various stages in the diffusion process, and
(3) the geographic strategies to be followed.   External conditions have
influenced the growth of the Faith, and they will be considered in this
study.   However, the primary thesis will be that the internal management
of Baha'i affairs has been the most important variable affecting the
religion's expansion.

An analysis of historical materials will reveal that the Baha'i
Faith has constantly improved this capacity to influence its own destiny.
At first, expansion of   the religion was largely a spontaneous response
to the charisma of the two Prophet-founders of the Faith.   With the
passage of time, however, growth was guided by policies and plans
adopted by the religion's leadership for the purpose of achieving a
spiritual conquest of the world.   Consequently, Baha'i expansion has
gradually shifted from being incidental and sporadic to being purposeful,
steady, and accelerative.

It is usually true that growth causes changes in the intrinsic
character of a new religion.   This process is one of the most fascin-
ating aspects of diffusion, but it will not be analyzed in this study.
As time passes, many of the beliefs and structures that define a
religion will evolve, and even at one time in history it is not unusual

for a religion to exist in a variety of forms depending on geographical
region and cultural setting.       Since its birth in 1844, the Baha'i Faith
certainly has experienced changes in content and form, but this already

has been studied by Johnson.        There is no need to supplement or revise
his work.   Furthermore, it is not clear that the Baha'i Faith has taken
on a multiplicity of forms in order to adapt to different cultures, and
so there will be no attempt to analyze geographic variations in the
essential nature of the religion.

Baha'i growth, and the policies which guided it, have been strongly
influenced by three different      charac~eristics   of the Faith, each of
which will be analyzed in this study.      First, a major cause of global
expansion has been the fundamental Baha'i belief that:         (1) in   th~   near
future the whole of mankind will become united, first in terms of
political, social, and economic allegiances, and afterwards in terms of
adherence to a single spiritual truth;      (2) the Baha'i Faith is destined
to guide the development of this new world order; and (3) the individual
believer has an obligation     to participate in the development process.
These beliefs have their roots in the writings of Baha'u'llah, founder
of the Baha'i Faith.   His words have been used to justify the increas-
ingly intense and coordinated program of planned Baha'i diffusion.             In
fact, the justifications are legitimate.      Baha'is can readily see the
link between the policy statements of the Prophet and the implementation
which followed.   Since Baha'i planning is viewed by most Baha'is as an

Transformations in the Evolution of the Baha'i World Faith" (unpublished
Ph.D. diss8rtation, Baylor University, 1974).

extension of certain divinely inspired principles enunciated by
Baha'u'llah, the planning and coordination of Baha'i diffusion has been
able to draw on an immense reservoir of faith and commitment within the
rank and file   me~bership.      The consequence is a long history of eminently
successful planning attempts, even under extremely adverse conditions.

Second, the essential unity of the Baha'i community has greatly
assisted its numerical and geographical expansion.        For all practical
purposes the Baha'i Faith is a monolithic structure with no sects,
splinter groups, subdivisions, or organized dissident elements.         This is
surprising   conside~ing   that Baha'i membership represents almost all
significant cultural, racial, economic, and geographic spectra.         Thinly
s~read,   widely distributed, frequently isolated, and usually hetero-
geneous, Baha'i communities might reasonably be expected to gravitate
towards autonomy and independent expr8ssion.        There are a number of
reasons why this has not occurred, the most important of which is that
the raison   ~etre   of the Baha'i Faith is to promote the unity of mankind
in both the spiritual a r   ,   temporal realms.   Such a mandate does not
belong to a house divided against itself and Baha'is have always been
aware of the need to maintain internal unity if a successful battle is
to be waged against the disunity of the world as a whole.        Although
unity is an integral feature of the Baha'i world, there have been
traumatic periods in the history of the Faith when division has threat-
ened the monolithic structure and has diverted the attention and energy
of a large portion of the Baha'i communities.        Generally speaking, these
periods of internal stress have been times of weak expansion and dif-
fusion.    On the other hand, when internal unity has been strong, and

particularly when specific expansionary objectives have been assigned to
the entire Baha'i world, diffusion has proceeded at a rapid pace.

Third, Baha'i expansion has been heavily dependent upon the
existence of centralized authority that is recognized as legitimate by
Baha'is.   In the early stages, the authority was resident in the words
and deeds of the Prophet-founders.     In more recent times, i t has passed
to the administrative institutions that are now responsible for the
management of the religion.     At all times, however, leadership has been
hierarchical in structure and sacred in origin.     Baha'is have always had
an ultimate decision-maker whose authority could not Le questioned with-
out challenging the legitimacy of the Faith itself.     Since authority has
always been viewed as divinely given, it has been capable of marshalling
the energies of     the entire Baha'i community, a circumstance that has
greatly facilitated the planned global expansion of the Faith.

METHOD OF STUDY

Description
The Baha'i Faith holds the key to an explanation of its own pattern
of diffusion.     This study will emphasize the character of the religion
as an innovation as much as it considers its spread as a process.     This
perspective should     permit the identification of both unique and pre-
dictable aspects of the Baha'i diffusion process.     At the same time,
however, there are bound to be certain consequences for the structure of
the research.

First, there is the matter of methodology.     Concern with the nature
of the innovation discourages the use of a rigidly defined methodology

designed to test certain preconceived notions.    For the most part,
research will progress inductively, and so methods of organizing and
analyzing information will vary depending on (1) what facet of the
innovation seems to be most important in explaining why diffusion occurred
at a given time, in a particular locality, or within a certain sector of
the   population, and (2) what types of data are available for analysis.
At some points the test will be historical and descriptive while at
others the emphasis will be on cartography and distributional analysis.
Frequently, demographic methods of analysis will come into play and
occasionally the study will make use of quantitative model construction
and inferential statistics.

Second, the object of study (e.g., the Baha'i Faith) will be
explored    in much greater detail than would be the case if the primary
concern were with diffusion in general and methodology in particular.       A
notable consequence of this approach is that there will be a heavy
reliance on Baha'i literature.    As expected, Baha'i sources will supply
quantitative grist for the diffusionist mill, but in   ~~dition   other
purposes will be served by frequent reference to the literature of the
religion.   Baha'i sacred writings and administrative directives will be
cited as explanatory variables in the diffusion equation; Baha'i
historical sources will be used to identify actual diffusion pathways as
well as facilitators of, and barriers to, the diffusion process; Baha'i
information regarding organizational structure and authority will be
incorporated into an analysis of the nature and efficacy of the
religion's population policies.    In these and other ways, explanations
of the diffusion process will be sought by looking inside the innovation
rather than by focusing attention exclusively on outside factors.

Third, it should be noted that no attempt will be made to compare
the diffusion of the Baha'i Faith with the spread of some other religion
or ideology.   This should not be taken as a negative judgment regarding
the value of such comparative studies.     In fact, the comparative approach
is commendable. 2   It does seem reasonable, however, that anyone who pur-
sues such a course should either have a commitment to both objects of
study or should be detached from both.

Fourth, the geographic scale of     the study will be large.   The most
significant aspect of the spread of the Faith is the extent to which it
has achieved global representation in spite of the relatively small
number of adherents.   Consequently, the most meaningful analysis of
Baha'i expansion must involve consideration of worldwide trends and
patterns.   Unfortunately, data availability is a problem.    There is an
abundance of excellent secondary informati0n regarding the global
activities of the Faith, but without access to the international archives
in Haifa, Israel, it is difficult for a researcher     to eliminate the
data gaps that inevitably occur.    In this study, the approach will be to
work around existing data gaps at the global scale rather than to con-
centrate on a particular region for which information sources are more

sense, all of the following compare the growth and distribution of a
number of different religious movements: J. H. Fleure, "The Geographical

complete.     Since I have had access to the u.S. Baha'i National Archives,
my data on Baha'i activities in the United States are much more com-
prehensive than the information available to me regarding worldwide
Baha'i activities.     Consequently, this research will be global in
orientation, but will include a more detailed examination of diffusion at
the national scale in the United States.        This division of effort can be
justified.     The United   States always has been a critical source region
for Baha'i global expansion.

Justification

Traditional Biases     in Diffusion Research

There are advantages that can be realized when as much attention
is paid to the nature of an innovation as to the character of its dif-
fusion.     The tendency in diffusion literature to emphasize the process
of diffusion and to ignore the character of the innovation has intro-
duced an unfortunate bias into diffusion research:        simple innovations
usually are selected for study.3     What is a simple innovation?     Rogers
and Shoemaker provided a partial answer to this question when they

3A recent bibliography lists a large number of diffusion studies
that have been done during the past two to three decades. The entries
for 1976 and 1977 indicate a shift in preoccupation from material to
conceptual innovations, but the emphasis still remains on unidimensional
innovations such as will, for example, improve methods of teaching,
governing, or administering: Everett M. Rogers, Linda Williams, and

summarized        the characteristics of an innovation that is likely to

1.     relative advantage over pre-existing ideas or technologies;
2.    compatibility with the values and beliefs that define the

adopting population;
3.    simplicity, or lack of complexity, that         permits easy trans-

mittal of information about the innovation;
> 4.     divisibility that permits partial, or staged, adoption;
5.     observability that allows potential adopters to witness the

beneficial effects of adoption.

Any innovation which has these characteristics has a high adoption
potential; an innovation without these presumably has much less chance
of being adopted.           There is, of course, a broad spectrum between the
two extremes, but most reSt arch          an~lyzes   innovations that are nearer
the high potential end of the spectrum.              The consequence is a body of
diffusion theory that successfully explains and predicts the diffusion
patterns of innovations that are conceptually simple but that inade-
quately identifies the forces involved in the diffusion of more complex
innovations.        By dealing with a complex innovation (e.g., the Baha'i
Faith), it may be possible for this study to overcome some of the bias

in diffusion research.             Overcoming this bias may be very important.      Is

it not     possible that the tendency to avoid complex innovations has
hampered the potential contributions of diffusion research by focusing
attention on innovations of lesser importance to man's development?
After all, even though such innovative developments      ~s   hybrid corn,
rotary clubs, and cable television may be important for       mar~ind,   it is
hard not to think that values, beliefs, and ideologies (all of which tend
to be cmplex innovations) may be more important.

The bias toward simple innovations leads to an interesting effect.

Diffusionist researchers rarely study innovations that have failed (e.g.,
have not diffused significantly).     Since only successful innovations are
studied, diffusionists come to view the spread of something new as a
natural--almost inevitable--process that will    oC~E_   unless some inhibiting
factor or cluster of factors stands in the way of expansion.         From this
perspective, diffusion is directed primarily by such considerations as
(1) the strength of the innovation as measured by the relative number of
adopters and change agents currently existing,    (2) the impact of distance
between potential source and potential adopter on the likelihood of
adoption, and (3) the size of the remaining population that is likely
to adopt.     This view denies the innovation the capacity to shape its own
destiny.     The basic pattern of diffusion that will occur lies outside the
control of     the intelligent forces that are behind the innovation.        By

Curiously, Xavi8~ de Planhol accomplished much the same thing for
Islam back in 1959: Xavier de Planhol, The World of Islam (Ithaca, New
York: Cornell University Press, 1959). Presumably, it is his non-
quantitative orientation that accounts for the fact that current work
in geographical diffusion ignores his pioneering efforts.

adopting such an approach, it is possible to avoid considering unique
aspects of the innovation that may have impinged on the diffusion process.
The Baha'i Faith has diffused, at least to a limited extent, in accordance
with such objective controls as size of diffusing population, size of
target population, and distance between them.   Ho'rever, even more integral
to an honest understanding of the diffusion of the Baha'i Faith is the
character of the innovation itself.   In some ways, that character is
unique.

Supply Diffusion

Recently, the study of geographic diffusion has taken a new direction.

Under the leadership of Lawrence Brown, a small core of diffusion re-
searchers has begun to explore the implications of the supply aspects of
diffusion.   Research from this point of view recognizes that the source
of an innovation often can be a more important influence on the geographic
expression of the diffusion process than the latent demand for the
innovation or the natural constraints to which flows of information
about the innovation are subject.

The innovation is distributed through agencies which
> affect the availability of both information about the innova-
> tion and the innovation itself to potential adopters. Their
> locations determine gross aspects of the spatial pattern of

Adoption: A Perspective on the Spatial Diffusion of Innovation,"
Studies in the Diffusion of Innovation, Discussion Paper No.1, The
Ohio State University Department of Geography, pp. 3-4.

From this point of view, therefore, the best way to understand a par-
ticular diffusion pattern is to (1) study the way in which the innovation
is marketed and (2) analyze the transportation and communication struc-
ture of the geographic area in which the diffusion process is occurring.

Brown has elaborated the supply approach to diffusion study by
evaluating the impact of diffu3ion of an innovation from a single
original source as opposed to diffusion from more than one original
source. 7   He shows that if a single supplier of an innovation creates a
network of diffusion agents, the geographic character of     ~hat   network
will differ from the network that will develop (1) if more than one
supplier creates separate, independent networks of diffusion agents or
(2) if development of a diffusion agent network is not controlled from
above but is instead the result of adoption decisions on the part of
potential agents.      Brown uses the phrase "mononuclear propagation
structure" to refer to the situation in which one original source
establishes a network of diffusion agents; he uses "polynuclear propaga-
tion structure" to refer to other situations.

This supply approach to the study of diffusion can be used to
improve our understanding of the growth and spread of the Baha'i Faith.
It   has already been asserted that this stUdy will focus as much on the
character of the Baha'i innovation as on its pattern of diffusion.        An
analysis of diffusion from the supply point of view is compatible with
this approach since an understanding of supply necessitates familiarity
with the historical development, organizational structures, and diffusion

objectives of the intelligent forces working for propagation of the
innovation.

Dissemination of     the Baha'i Faith has been effected by a network
of diffusion agents who, because of the nature of the religion, have
op~rated   partly as independent agents and partly as emissaries of the
Faith's administration.     In other words, the Baha'i religion has had a
propagation structure which combines the mononuclear and polynuclear
types.   However, because of the strong spiritual authority possessed by
the Baha'i leadership and because of the basically monolithic structure
of the religion, the development of a network of diffusion agents has
proceeded mainly according to the principles of mononuclear propagation
structure.    This study will show that the geographic pattern of Baha'i
diffusion has been strongly influenced by the supply of diffusion agents
and by the responsiveness of those agents to the suggestions, appeals,
and directives of the religion's leadership.

The supply diffusion concepts developed by Brown and others have
been applied almost entirely to situations where a product or service
has been marketed by a private firm or public agency.8     In such situa-
tions, the reason for generating the diffusion process is either to

realize an economic profit or to improvo::    80~.:i.a.l   welfare.   In both
instances, the time perspective is typically short--generally less than
one or two decades.     For the Baha'i Faith, however, the diffusion process
is not stimulated by the same motives.       Profit making is not an objective
of the religion.    Improvement of social welfare is an objective, but it
is subordinate to the goal of spiritual regeneration.             Furthermore, as a
religion, the Baha'i Faith cannot be easily defined as a product or
service.    Finally, the religion has a long range view of its own diffusion
process and does not adopt diffusion strategies just on the basis of
short term goals.     As a result, most supply diffusion studies contain
little substantive material that is relevant to the growth and spread of
the Baha'i Faith.     The supply point of view, however, is very appropriate
to the study of Baha'i diffusion, and so it will be used often in this
research.

treats diffusion as a process that can be understood with only super-
ficial attention being paid to the nature of the innovation--an approach
that violates a basic tenet of this study.         The exceptions, of course, are
the     supply oriented studies of diffusion.

For the purposes of this research, it is appropriate to confine the
literature review to those geographical diffusion studies which deal with
religions.     Some work has been done, and the bulk of it already has been
reviewed by Louder. l l        In fact, he surveyed nearly all significant
research dealing with the geographic study of religious phenomena.           The
organizational structure of his review identified four different thrusts
in    geog~aphic   research:     (1) significance of the environmental setting,
(2) religious modification of the environment, (3) occupation and organi-
zation of earth space, and (4) distribution, diffusion, and interaction.
It is, of course, the last of these research thrusts that is most
relevant to this study--particularly that portion dealing with diffusion.
The most common denominator of all the diffusion studies reviewed by
Louder is a recognition that the migratory behavior of adopters is
highly influential in shaping the subsequent pattern of geographical
spread. 12

Louder's work itself documented the way in which Mormon diffusion
relied primarily on migratory relocation in its earlier stages and con-
version in the more recent past.   The shift in emphasis from relocation
to conversion, he further pointed out, was accompanied by a parallel
shift from basically rural expansion to primarily urban growth.      Louder
used a variety of statistical techniques to analyze the distributional
characteristics of the Mormon population and formulated a simulation
model to deal with the actual diffusion process.      It is these approaches
that supplied him with the results upon which his conclusions concerning
the importance of migration and conversion were based.      Particularly to
Louder's credit is the fact that he documented the way in which such
peculiarly Mormon elements as   the concept of Zion, the early preoccupa-
tion with   political independence, the hierarchically and geographically
articulate administrative system, and the recently intensified missionary
activities, have profoundly influenced historical patterns of diffusion.
In fact, Louder devoted a lengthy chapter to a discussion of theological,
organizational, and historical facts relevant to Mormon diffusion.      The
result was a more rational picture of Mormon expansion than that forth-
coming from his model-building efforts.

bibliographic compilation, in fact, is even more complete than that of
Louder, but he did not pay as much attention to diffusion studies.          Gay's
book analyzed the spatial distribution of numerous religious groups in
England at different points in time over the past 125 years.         For each
of the groups considered, he clearly showed (1) where a       reli~ion   became
established, (2) why it established itself where it did, (3) what
geographic and demographic changes have occurred since that time, (4)
why those changes came about, (5) how the current picture appears, and
(6) what future developments are likely to transpire.        The research is
intriguing because, in spite of its strong reliance on a static, dis-
tributional methodology, it successfully draws attention to the issue of
change.       In other words, it is a diffusion study in disguise.

Since the work of Louder and Gay, a number of geographers have
addressed       the   question of religious diffusion,14 two of whom have con-
ducted studies that are particularly relevant to this research.          Judith

Meyer        has studied the diffusion of the Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod
Congregations in the United States since their first appearance in 1847.

stable and compact spatial distribution, and a gradual geographic dif-
fusion based on migration.    Meyer considered both internal and external
factors in trying to explain the denomination's pattern of growth, but
ultimately became more     intrigued by the former.    "The impact of the
ethnic character and the conservative theology of the LC-MS on its
expansion process suggests a fruitful area of research in religious
geography:   the impact of particular Gharacteristics of religious
institutions on their patterns of diffusion and spatial distribution.,,16
In a different     context, Meyer described the general lack of her approach
in more detailed    and specific terms:

Although geographical research includes a substantial

Meyer's behavioral approach emphasizes the characteristics of the
religion and how they have affected diffusion.        This, of course, meshes

well with Brown's supply diffusion perspective.     If there is a major
difference between these two perspectives it is that the supply diffusion
tradition tends to focus on conscious marketing policy and how it inter-
acts with actual market conditions, whereas the behavioral    approa~~    takes
a broader view of the innovation and tries to consider how its attitudes
and beliefs affect the diffusion process, regardless of whether they are
conscious or unconscious, market-oriented or not.

Manfred Hannemann has conducted an analysis of the early spread of
the Reformation in Southwestern Germany.lS   This study could not be
called purely behavioral since it concentrated on how external conditions
affected the diffusion process.   However, Hannemann relied on an histor-
ical methodology that takes careful notice of the exact nature of the
Reformation.   This permitted him to explain the movement's growth and
spread in terms of how its beliefs and values interacted with local
conditions.

In his concluding statements, Hannemann made certain observations
that show why a religion does not diffuse in the same way as many other
innovations.   At the same time, he identified particular conditions and
processes that moulded the diffusion of the Reformation.     Subsequent
analyses will show that those conditions and processes have had parallels
in the Baha'i experience.

habits. Although both are dependent on propagators located
in diffusion centers of varying importance, they differ in
several respects. Unlike the individual ownership of material
goods, an ideology can be the common property of a group of
people. And unlike its material counterpart, the spread of an
emerging religious ideology is far more difficult to observe and
keep track of. Its ultimate success depends to a large degree on
political authority acting as an intervening variable that trans-
forms such movements into a dynamic process in which localities
and ~erritories are conquered or lost. In the case of the
Reformation, the split within the Protestant ranks into Lutherans,
Zwinglians, and a number of other groups was an additional
variable that must be taken into account. This split weakened
the two major Protestant parties in their contest with the Roman
Catholic Church for the religious-spatial domination of the German
Southwest. Finally, it must be noted that the diffusion of
religious values, unlike that of material ones, is less bound to
geographical distance and space.

The spread of the evangelical ideology was in fact most closely
bound to personal relationships, the principal means of familiar-
izing the broad majority of the German people--90 percent of whom
were then illiterate--with Luther's teachings. These personal
relationships either could be long standing and pre-date the
origin of the innovation, or they could be more recent personal
ties that originated with the innovation. It stands to reason
that both were equally important. 19

CHAPTER II
HISTORY AND BELIEFS

HISTORY

The Bah and Baha'u'llah
On May 22nd, 1844, a young Persian merchant named Mirza 'Ali-
Muhammad proclaimed Himself to be a Prophet of God.       Designating Himself
as the "Bah" (gate; forerunner), He stated that His principal mission
was to herald the advent of One who was destined to be even greater than
Himself--One who would bring to the world the potent world of God in such
a sublime form that the spirituality of all mankind would be regenerated
and the planet would become united.    He promised that this greater
Manifestation of God would declare    Hi~self   at the end of nineteen years.

The Bah rapidly attracted a large number of followers in Persia.

The audacity of His claims inflamed Muslim sensibilities and growth of
the movement encountered increasing resistance and suppression.       The
mounting conflict culminated in the execution of the Bab, the martyrdom
of 20,000 Babis, and the virtual annihilation of what was considered to
be a heretical religious movement.

One of the few surviving followers of the Bab was an early disciple
who came to be known as "Baha'u'llah" (The Glory of God).       During a period
of imprisonment in a dungeon in Tihran, Baha'u'llah realized that He was
the Promised One.   Subsequent to His release He was banished to Iraq
(Baghdad) where in 1863--nineteen years after the declaration of the Bab
and ten years after His own exile from Persia--He announced His mission

and undertook the global transformation promised by the Bah.         Thereafter,
the Babi Faith became the Baha'i Faith l and a religious movement, con-
fined     until that time to Persia and   i~~ediately surroQ~ding   territories,
began to take on international dimensions.

The whole of Baha'u'llah's life, from the time of His imprisonment
in Tihran in 1853 until His departure from this world in 1892, was spent
in exile and under varying r.onditions of restraint and confinement.        The
decade of detention in Baghdad witnessed declining Babi       fortunes in
Persia where persecution continued unabated, but gradual reorganization
and regeneration of the Faith in Baghdad under the steadily increasing
leadership and authority of Baha'u'llah.       Political authorities in
Persia, disturbed by the specter of a rejuvenated Babi movement within
the country, agitated to have its leader relocated to a place more
distant from the borders of Persia.       This would further diminish
Baha'u'llah's contact with the religion's adherents in the homeland
and the movement, lacking leadership and inspiration, might be expected
to die a natural death.

In 1863 Baha'u'llah and His companions were transferred from
Baghdad to Constantinople, the center of the Ottoman empire.        For five
years the small Baha'i community in that city2 was embroiled in an
internal leadership conflict as Mirza Yahya, a half-brother to

lA Babi is a follower of the Bab; a Baha'i is a follower of
Baha'u'llah. The term "Baha'i" was not adopted by Baha'u'llah's
followers until 1865 when internal strife necessitated differentation
between those who accepted Baha'u'llah and those who did not. Baha'is
do not deny the Bab. In fact a Baha'i is obliged to accept the Bab's
claims.

2I n fact, during most of this period Baha'u'llah resided in
Adrianople, some distance from the capital city.

Baha'u'llah, challenged the claims of Baha'u'llah and proclaimed that he,
instead, should be recognized as the Promised One.   The ensuing struggle
reached violent proportions, and this disturbance (coupled with the
increasing attention being paid to the Faith as a result of an audacious
series of letters from Baha'u'llah to the most powerful world leaders
demanding that they recognize His station and exercise their authority
according to the will of God) precipitated a political decision to banish
Mirza Yahya to Famagusta, Cypress, and Baha'u'llah to the penal colony of
'Akka, Palestine.   Since 1868 the area encompassing Acre, and its sister
city of Haifa, has remained the administrative center of the Baha'i
Faith.   It is the principal destination for pilgrims who, in conformity
with Baha'i social teachings, attempt at least once during their lifetime
to visit the shrine of the Bab, the shrine of Baha'u'llah, and the
assortment of places--most of which are now owned by the Faith--in which
Baha'u'llah initially was incarcerated (e.g., the army barracks within
the 'Akka prison) and later was confined (e.g., the House of 'Abbud, the
houses of Malik, Khavvam, and Rabi'ih, and the Mazra'ih Mansiou).

The Baha'i perception of the historical significance of the lives
of the two founders of the Faith is summarized by Shoghi Effendi:

A dynamic process, divinely propelled, possessed of undreamt-
> of potentialities, world-embracing in scope, world-transforming
> in its ultimate consequence, had been set in motion on that
> memorable day when the Bah communicated the purpose of His mission
> to Mulla Husayn in an obscure corner of Shiraz. It acquired a
> tremendous momentum with the first intimations of Baha'u'llah's
> dawning revelation amidst the darkness of the Siyah-Chal
> [dungeon] of Tihran. It was further accelerated by the Declaration
> of His mission on the eve of His banishment from Baghdad. It moved
> to a climax with the proclamation of that same mission during the
> tempestuous years of His exile in Adrianople. Its full signifi-
> cance was disclosed when the Author of that Mission issued His
> historic SQ~onses, appeals and warnings to the kings of the
earth and the world's ecclesiastical leaders. It was finally

> consummated by the laws and ordinances which He formulated,
> by the principles which He enunciated and by the institutions
> which He ordained during the concluding years of His ministry
> in the prison-city of 'Akka. 3

'Abdu'l-Baha
When Baha'u'llah died in 1892, He left to the Baha'i community a
will and testament designed to insure a unified and orderly future for
the Faith.    The document unequivocally designated 'Abdu'l-Baha, its
Author's eldest son, as the one person to whom all Baha;is must turn for
leadership and guidance.    The precise nature of the authority vested in
'Abdu'l-Baha will be discussed in a different context at a later point in
this study.   For now, suffice it to say that, although not designated as
a Prophet in his own right, 'Abdu'l-Baha was, as a consequence of
Baha'u'llah's will, heir to the spiritual allegiance of the Baha'i world.
Beset by difficulties of many sorts during his time as leader of the
Baha'i movement (1892-1921), 'Abdu'l-Baha often was able to prevail as
a consequence of the spiritual authority accorded to him by his Prophet
Father.

'Abdu'l-Baha guided the Faith during a period of turbulence and
change, both in the fortunes of the still youthful religious movement
and in the arrangement of mankind's affairs at the global level.     Born on
the day that the Bah declared His mission,4 'Abdu'l-Baha coordinated

Publishing Trust, 1965), p. 237.

4According to the Baha'i calendar, days begin and end at sunset.

Under this system, May 23rd, 1844, is recognized as both the birth date
of 'Abdu'l-Baha and the declaration date of the Bab. By the Gregorian
system of beginning and ending days at midnight, the anniversary of the
declaration of the Bab falls on May 22nd while the birthday of 'Abdu'l-
Baha occurs on May 23rd.

Baha'i matters from the time of his Father's death in 1892 until his own
passing in 1921.     For many years he continued to be confined by the
Ottoman authorities to the 'Akka area,      but the "Young Turk" revolution
in 1908 prompted the release of all religious and political prisoners,
thereby terminating the 56 year period of confinement that had curtailed
the activities of both Baha'u'llah and His son.      'Abdu'l-Baha's freedom,
however, was relatively short-lived when compared to the total span of
his ministry.    By 1914 the Western World had become embroiled in the
Great War--a conflict that was not, unfortunately, confined to Europe.
The Holy Lands became a battleground for the competing forces of Great
Britain and     the Turkish Empire.   After 1918, 'Abdu'l-Baha was once
again free to move as he pleased, but by then he was 74 years old, his
strength was waning, and his earthly life was nearing its end.

In spite of the intermittent limitations hampering 'Abdul'l-Baha's
freedom of action, the period 1892-1921 was one of marked geographical
expansion of the Faith.     No sooner had Baha'u'llah passed from the
scene than 'Abdu'l-Baha began to direct the attention of Baha'is to the
latent potential for expansion that existed in the West, but particularly
in America.     In 1893 he directed Dr. Ibrahim Khayr'u'llah, a Baha'i then
residing in Egypt, to migrate to the United states for the purpose of
proclaiming the Faith.     Dr. Khayr'u'llah was successful in enlisting a
nucleus of Baha'i believers, many of whom resided in the Chicago area.
Some of   these early believers, in turn, established the Faith in various
regions of the country and even were successiul in transmitting the
religious message back across the Atlantic to various European nations,
in particular, to France, Great Britain, Germany, and Austria.      Thus, by
the turn of the century, the Faith had a foothold in a number of Western

countries as well as an established (although tenuous) presence in the
Near and Middle East.      In fact, early travelers during the time of the
Bab had successfully carried the Faith as far east as Pakistan, India,
and even Burma, and so by 1900 the religion clearly had expanded beyond
its cultural, linguistic, and religious homeland.

'Abdu'l-Baha's emphasis on growth in America was a basic theme
running through the whole of his ministry.     His early statements testify
to the special importance attached to Baha'i consolidation there:

• . • liThe continent of America . . • is, in the eyes of
> the one true God, the land wherein the splendors of His light
> shall be revealed, where the mysteries of His Faith shall be
> unveiled, where the righteous shall abide and the free assemble.
> The American continent . . • ~iveth signs and evidences of very
> great advancement. Its future is even more promising, for its
> influence and illumination are far reaching. It will lead all
nations spiritually.

· • . This American nation is equipped and empowered to
> accomplish that which will adorn the pages of history, to be-
> come the envy of the world, and be blest in both the East and
> the West for the triumph of its people. May this American
> democracy be the first nation to establish the foundation of
> international agreement. May it be the first nation to proclaim
> the unity of mankind. May it be the first to unfurl the standard
> of the Most Great Peace. liS
> But growth of the     Faith in America was not an end in itself; it
was to be a preliminary development intended to establish a geographical
source from which worldwide expansion on a large scale could occur.

Naturally, during the extensive periods of confinement in the Holy
Lands, 'Abdu'l-Baha was obliged to promote Baha'i expansion by means
other than direct visitation.   The most common forms of contact with
overseas Baha'is included (1) postal correspondence, (2) emissary visits
by selected Baha'is under instructions from 'Abdu'l-Baha, and (3)
pilgrimage visits by overseas believers (especially   Arnerica~s)   to
'Abdu'l-Baha in Haifa.

During the brief era in which 'Abdu'l-Baha was free to travel
(1908-1914) he made an extensive overseas trip for the purpose of
strengthening and expanding the influence of the Faith.    Leaving Haifa
in September of 1910, he resided for nearly a year in Egypt before under-
taking a four month trip to England and France.    Returning to Egypt in
December of 1911, 'Abdu'l-Baha passed three months before departing on
a prolonged tour to Arnerica--a tour that was to last for eight months
and was to include visits to a number of major cities in the Northeast,
Midwest and California.   In December of   1912, he returned to Europe and
spent six months in England, France, Germany, and Austro-Hungary.        A
final six month stay, once again in Egypt, concluded his trip.

It may appear that 'Abdu'l-Baha's principal concern and prime
responsibility was to oversee and promote Baha'i expansion.    That
definitely was not the case.    Although growth of the Faith was an
important concern, even more central to 'Abdu'l-Baha's position as
leader of the Baha'i world was his role as interpreter of Baha'u'llah's
word and exemplar of Baha'i life.    In these capacities, 'Abdu'l-Baha had
a profound impact on the structure of Baha'i thought and action, a
circumstance that is explained by the fact that Baha'u'llah specified

in no uncertain terms that His son was to be recognized by all Baha'is
as an unchallengeable interpreter of His holy word and a perfect example
of   how Baha'is should try to live their lives.     'Abdu'l-Baha was, there-
fore, both the spiritual and secular head of the Faith.

Shoghi Effendi
The passage of 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1921 once again raised the question
of how leadership and authority were to be transferred and, just as his
Father had done, 'Abdu'l-Baha addressed the problem in his will by
transmitting some of his prerogatives to a descendent.      His grandson,
Shoghi Effendi, was to be recognized as Guardian of the Faith.      The
station of Guardian preserved the roles of temporal leader and divine
interpreter, but did not perpetuate the responsibility of exemplary
behavior.    Furthermore, Shoghi Effendi himself very rarely indulged in
interpretive statements unless they were in some way required by the
practical, worldly conditions surrounding the day-to-day development of
the Faith.   Thus, his leadership can be associated most deeply with
temporal affairs, and particularly with how Baha'is should use their
lives to express the spiritual truths of their Faith.      That identified
pattern of optimum individual behavior outlined by Shoghi Effendi, more-
over, was inextricably bound up with the current status and anticipated
future ascendancy of the Faith as a whole.      Notice how, in the following
lengthy extract, Shoghi Effendi linked individual behavior with the
fortunes of the Faith:

Let every believer, desirous to witness the swift and
> healthy progress of the Cause of God, realize the twofold
> nature of his task. Let him first turn his eyes inwardly
and search his own heart and satisfy himself that in his

> relations with his fellow-believers, irrespective of color
> and class, he is proving himself increasingly loyal to the
> spirit of his beloved Faith. Assured and content that he
> is exerting his utmost in a conscious effort to approach
> nearer every day the lofty station to which his gracious
> Master summons him, let him turn to his second task, and,
> with befitting confidence and vigor, assail the devastating
> power of those forces which in his own heart he has already
> succeeded in subduing. Fully alive to the unfailing efficacy
> of the power of Baha'u'llah, and armed with the essential
> weapons of wise restraint and inflexible resolve, let him
> wage a constant fight against the inherited tendencies, the
> corruptive instincts, the fluctuating fashions, the false
pretenses of the society in which he lives and moves.

In their relations amongst themselves as fellow-believers,
> let them not be content with the mere exchange of cold and
> empty formalities often connected with the organizing of
> banquets, receptions, consultative assemblies, and lecture-
> halls. Let them rather, as equal co-sharers in the spiritual
> benefits conferred upon them by Baha'u'llah, arise and, with
> the aid and counsel of their local and national representatives,
> supplement these official functions with those opportunities
> whi~h only a close and intimate social intercourse can ade-
> quately provide. In their homes, in their hours of relaxation
> and leisure, in the association of their children, whether in
> their study-classes, their playgrounds, and club-rooms, in
> short under all possible circumstances, however insignificant
> they appear, the community of the followers of Baha'u'llah
> should satisfy themselves that in the eyes of the world at
> large and in the sight of their vigilant Master they are the
> living witnesses of those truths which He fondly cherished
> and tirelessly championed to the very end of His days. If we
> relax in our purpose, if we falter in our faith, if we neglect
> the varied opportunities given co us from time to time by an
> all-wise and gracious Master, we are not merely failing in
> what is our most vital and conspicuous obligation, but are
> thereby insensibly retarding the flow of those quickening
> energies which can alone insure the vigorous and speedy develop-
> ment of God's struggling faith. 7

The significance of Shoghi Effendi's stance regarding his own leadership
of the Faith--a stance that the above quotation is intended to reveal--
is that Baha'i energies   during his period of authority carne to be
focused on the task of achieving increased recognition of the power and

7Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration (Wilmette, Illinois:
Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1974), pp. 130-131.

authenticity of   the Baha'i revelation by means of exemplary behavior
and conscious endeavor on the part of individual believers.        This
strategy is a continuous theme in Shoghi Effendi's writings; it con-
centrated the attention of most Baha'is on the problem of achieving the
diffusion of the Faith, and, if descriptive statistics regarding demo-
graphic and geographic expansion can be accepted as evidence (an imposing
"if"), then a strong circumstantial case can be made in support of its
efficacy.

Much more concrete evidence can be marshalled to show that the
Guardian's emphasis on planning as a vehicle for expansion resulted in
marked gains in the number and distribution of believers, administrative
bodies, and capital holdings. 8     The use of planning as a vehicle for
Baha'i growth was introduced by 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1916 and 1917 when he
sent to the American Baha'i community a     s~Lies   of messages designed to
inspire the believers to spread the Faith by travelling to specific
regions and telling the inhabitants about the religion.        These   messages,
referred to in the Baha'i literature as the Tablets of the Divine Plan,
were extraordinary in scope.      At a time when the whole Baha'i community
in North America numbered less than 2,500, the Tablets assigned it the
specific responsibility of establishing the Faith on all the continents
and in virtually every region of the world.      The Tablets instructed the
Baha'is on how they should go about spreading the word and specified
individually the countries, colonies, islands, localities, and regions

8Statistical evidence in support of this statement will be
presented at a later point in the study.

where they should concentrate their energies, but no time horizons were
set, no specific goals in terms of numbers of believers were established,
and no order of priorities was defined.     Shoghi Effendi used the Tablets
of the Divine Plan as a basis for much more specific planning efforts.
Based on the conceptual plan contained in the Tablets, he articulated a
series of plans for Baha'i growth, each of which contained goals,
priorities, and time horizons.     These plans, which, due to a variety of
circumstances, WGre not initiated until 1937, exhibited increasing com-
plexity, scope, and ambitiousness as one succeeded another.     Each built
upon the achievements of its predecessor and provided for the consoli-
dation of whatever gains might be made.     The goals of each, with very
minor exceptions, were achieved.    The planning concept and its associated
skills of development, implementation, and evaluation become a part of
Baha'i life so that now, twenty years after the passing of Shoghi
Effendi, the Baha'i world is still planning its own expansion, still
measuring its achievements against its own expectations.

Above all else, however, the work of Shoghi Effendi focused on the
development of an administrative system that was to embody the adminis-
trative principles and structures already outlined by Baha'u'llah and
was to provide for the unremitting propagation of the Faith.     Further-
morE, the Guardian's disinclination to designate a successor meant that
upon his death in 1957 the Baha'i community had to be prepared for a
termination of the charismatic leadership which had dominated the first
113 years of its history.   without an administrative structure that was
authoritative, functional, and self-perpetuating, the Faith would have
been left in an extremely vulnerable state.     Internal differences of

opinion and interest would have greatly increased the probability of
religious schism during the period of transition.   When Shoghi Effendi
became Guardian in 1921 there was no semblance of an administrative struc-
ture appropriate to the need which would arise 36 years later.     During
his period of Guardianship he developed the necessary structure, first
by calling for the establishment of local Spiritual Assemblies at the
community level, later by stimulating the creation of National Spiritual
Assemblies that could coordinate the activities of the individual local
Assemblies existing in their respective national areas, and finally by
providing for the mechanisms whereby the international body called the
Universal House of Justice could be formed.   The Universal House of
Justice did not become a reality until after Shoghi Effendi's death
(at age 60), but by then the pattern of the administrative order was set
and   the smooth transferral of leadership was feasible.

In no way can the present Baha'i administrative system be con-
sidered a mere creature of Shoghi Effendi's intellect.     The basic struc-
ture of the administrative order was sketched out by Baha'u'llah;9 some
of the practical issues of form and limits of authority were resolved by
'Abdu'l-Baha in his will and testament. l O Shoghi Effendi's task was one

of implementation, a process that required a myriad of decisions re-
garding the mundane workings of the various administrative institutions.
The result is an administrative system which clearly reflects the orderly,
systematic qualities characteristic    of the Guardian's mind, but which in
its basic structure and principles is the creation of Baha'u'llah.        Thus
Baha'is perceive it as being a divinely ordained blueprint for the future
when mankind will be united under the spiritual    WTh~rella   of the Baha'i
Faith:

The Administrative Order is fundamentally different from
> anything that any Prophet has previously established, inasmuch
> as Baha'u'llah has Himself revealed its principles, established
> its institutions, appointed the person to interpret His Word,
> and conferred the necessary authority on the body designed to
> supplement and a:~ly His legislative ordinances. Therein lies
> the secret of its strength, its fundamental distinction, and the
guarantee against disintegration and schism.

The Baha'i Administrative Order, as it expands and con-
> solidates itself, will come to be regarded not only as the
> nucleus but as the very pattern of the New World Order, destined
> to embrace, in the fullness of time, the whole of mankind. It
> is the sole framework of the Baha'i commonwealth of the future
> which will be at once the instrument and the guardian of the
> Most Great Peace announced by its Author. l l
> The administrative order developed by Shoghi Effendi permitted a
transition from charismatic to institutionalized leadership.        Further-
more, because of the divine origins of the administrative system, even
the institutionalized leadership has charisma--a fact which enlarges its
capacity to marshal the allegiance and intensify the commitment of the
Baha'i community.     This has been a significant factor in the Faith's
propensity to grow.    The administrative order is perceived by Baha'is

llprinciples of Baha'i Administration, A Compilation (3rd ed.;
London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1973), p. 1.

as being not merely a manager of internal affairs but also an effective
tool for engendering global diffusion of the Faith.      In fact, promotion
of the principles     of the   Faith is its primary reason for existing:

As the administrative work of the Cause steadily expands,
> as its various branches grow in importance and number, it is
> absolutely necessary that we bear in mind this fundamental
> fact that all these administrative activities, howe~Ter har-
> moniously and efficiently conducted, are but means to an end,
> and should be regarded as direct instruments for the propa-
> gation of the Baha'i Faith. 12

The establishment of the administrative system was the Guardian's
single most important accomplishment, but there was another dimension to
his labors on behalf of the Faith that so affected the diffusion process
that it cannot be overlooked.      Shoghi Effendi's upbringing in the presence
of 'Abdu'l-Baha and the Baha'i tradition was combined with an educa-
tional experience, designed by his grandfather, that initially empha-
sized Oriental languages and Eastern wisdom, but included instruction in
English and eventually culminated in a B.A. from the American University
in Beirut and additional studies in economics and political science at

Oxford.        The net result was that when he became heir to the Guardian-
ship he was      in the unique position of being an authoritative translator
of the voluminous Baha'i sacred writings.      There can be little doubt that
in the early years of the Faith transmittal of its principles was greatly
inhibited by the language barrier.      In order for the Faith to transcend
its original cultural context its message had to be made available in
languages other than Persian and Arabic.      The magnitude of the problem is

Trust, 1969), pp. 12-13, 25-38.

hard to evaluate, but Baha'i recognition of its importance is apparent
in Baha'u'llah's social teaching that adoption of an auxiliary universal
language is a required condition of world unity, and in the emphasis
which Baha'i growth plans have placed on the translation of Baha'i
writings into as wide a variety of languages as possible.       'Abdu'l-Baha
was aware of the problem and, perceiving the de facto primacy of English
as an international language, insured that his grandson would be in a

position to disseminate original Baha'i writings via that channel.

The bulk of the sacred Baha'i literature currently available in
English 1 5 was    originally translated by Shoghi Effendi.   In addition, he
tapped non-English sources to write a comprehensive history of the Faith,
and   translated a major historical narrative of the period of the Bab's
ascendancy.       Insofar as written materials assist the diffusion process,
the Guardian's work as a translator facilitated the early dissemination
of the Faith in English-speaking parts of the world.

The Faith Today
Today, the Baha'i      Faith is a single, unified religious movement
with followers in virtually every nation, territory, and isolated region
of the world (with the singular exception of the communist realm).          In
no country do Baha'is represent even five percent of the total population
and so when viewed on a global scale their pattern of settlement is very

14 I b i d., p. 12. Incidentally, the Baha'i attitude regarding
translation of sacred scriptu~e contrasts sharply with the attitude of
Islam.

15A large part of the entire body of literature that emanated from
the pens of the Bab, Baha'u'llah, and 'Abdu'l-Baha has not yet been
translated into English.

highly dispersed.    Now that the Guardian is gone and leadership by
individuals has come to an end, the affairs of the Faith are handled
entirely by the new administrative order.       Administrative institutions
and   principals are numerous, but some understanding of them is essential
if    one is to have a realistic impression of how Baha'i diffusion pro-
ceeds.

At the core of the administrative order of the Faith is a hierarchi-
cal structure consisting of three levels of territorial authority.       At the
global level, the affairs of the Faith are coordinated and directed by
the Universal House of Justice located in Haifa, Israel--an indivisible
body composed    of nine elected individuals.     The intermediate layer of
administration consists of over 120 National Spiritual Assemblies, each
of which resembles the Universal House of Justice in form but which is
limited    in territorial jurisdiction.   At the lowest administrative level
are similarly formed local Spiritual Assemblies.       They exist in every
town, village, or city wherein reside nine or more adult Baha'is, and
each has authority just in its own small territorial subdivision.
Baha'is are expected to form a local Spiritual Assembly as soon as there
are nine adult believers in their area, and yet no city or town can
have more than one such body.    If the Baha'i population drops below nine,
the pre-existing Assembly automatically dissolves.       The formation and
activity of each Assembly is carefully recorded and that information is
forwarded to the appropriate National Spiritual Assembly which in turn
transmits all significant news to the Universal House of Justice.

At all three levels, members of these administrative bodies are
elected.    At present, members of   the Universal House of Justice are
elected for five years; members of National and local Spiritual

Assemblies for one.     Campaigning is strictly prohibited and nomination
of individuals is not permitted.      Elections are by secret ballot.

Local Spiritual Assembly members are elected directly by all adult
believers     in the Assembly area.   For the election of National Spiritual
Assemblies, believers in the various regions      of the National Assembly
are obliged to elect delegates to a national convention who in turn
elect the National Spiritual Assembly.     The number of delegates from a
particular region is proportionate to the relati.'e size of the Baha'i
community there.     The Universal House of Justice is elected by the members
of the National Spiritual Assemblies.      Thus it is that the three tiers
of administration obtain their legitimacy in the eyes of the Baha'i
community through the synergistic combination of sacred origins and
democratic structure.     Even though democratic procedures determine mem-
bership of these administrative units, elected individuals are not
representatives of the electors in the accepted political sense.        A member
of an administrative body is supposed to be independent of influence and
is expected to perform his duties according to the dictates of his own
conscience.    Moreover, he is powerless in his own right.    Although greatly
respected by the Baha'i community, he possesses no authority as an
individual; only decisions arrived at by the administrative body to
which he belongs can be considered as binding on the believers.

In contradistinction to these elected assemblies which are concerned
with governing Baha'i affairs, there stands a separate set of Baha'i
institutions solely devoted to furtherance of the religion's interests.
Principal of these is the institution of the Hands of the Cause of God,

a sma11 group   0   f men an d women       ' d by t h e

Guara~an   16 --accord'~ng to
a prerogative granted to him in        ~~du'l-Baha's   will and testament--and
vested with the responsibility of protecting and promulgating the Faith.
The Hands travel extensively in order to:          (1) proclaim the Faith to
the public at large, and (2) inspire Baha'is everywhere to become more
united in their interactions with each other and to be more committed to
the goal of expanding the influence of the          Faith.   Hands of the Cause of
God are recognized as knowledgeable individuals regarding Baha'i teachings,
but they are not accorded any administrative authority.               Since only the
Guardian had the right to appoint Hands of the Cause of God, they will
eventually disappear from the Baha'i scene.          In order to perpetuate the
protection and promulgation function that they perform, the Universal
House of Justice has appointed the Continental Board of Counsellors, a
body of individuals who normally are apportioned to various regions of
the world.   Continental Counsellors, in turn, have been granted the
prerogative of appointing assistants called auxiliary board members.

Individual Baha'is become involved in conducting the affairs of the
Faith via a number of channels, the most important of which is the 19
day feast.   On the first day of each Baha'i month the members of each
Baha'i community around the world gather together to participate in a
meeting which has three parts:          (1) a spiritual portion in which Baha'i
sacred writings are read, (2) a consultative portion in which community
affairs are discussed and suggestions for comnmnity activities are made

16Actually, Baha'u'llah is known to have appointed four Hands of
the Cause of God and 'Abdu'l-Baha referred to two additional individuals
as being Hands. After the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha, however, the Guardian
was the only person with the right to make such appointments. During his
ministry, Shoghi Effendi appointed 42 Hands, the vast majority of whom
have since passed away.

to the local Spiritual Assembly, and (3) a social portion.       The feast
serves a number of purposes, not the least of which are maintenance of
community unity and facilitation of interaction between the local
Spiritual Assembly and the individual believers.

Baha'is also participate in the affairs of the Faith by attending
conferences, many of which are international in scope.      The conference
brings together Baha'is from a wide area, emphasizes the unity of spirit
and endeavor     that must characterize Baha'i life, and inspires Baha'is
to diffuse the Faith.     Baha'i conferences are not held at regular inter-
vals,     but do occur frequently and in all parts of the world.

At a more personal level, the individual Baha'i can, at any time,
volunteer to be a pioneer or travel teacher.      Pioneers are Baha'is who
move to a locality where there are few or no believers and attempt to
develop a Baha'i community.     In most instances pioneers are self-
supporting.     They are not official representatives of the Faith in the
sense of being experts, authorities, or professionals.      Neither are
they selected or individually recruited by Spiritual Assemblies.

Travel teachers are individuals who, like pioneers, volunteer their
time and energy to spreading the Faith, but instead of actually settling
in a new location they travel from place to place giving talks on the
religion.     Nowadays, travel teachers usually go where Baha'i communities
already exist and, relying on the aUvance planning of these communities,
present the Faith to interested people who have been brought to a pre-
arranged meeting.     Travel teachers were not always so fortunate.    In the
earlier part of the century they frequently went to locations where
there were no Baha'is and had to recruit listeners as well as speak to
them.

It would be difficult to overemphasize the importance of pioneering
and travel teaching to the growth of the Faith.     As a general rule,
travel teaching has been an effective means of expanding the size and
number of Baha'i communities in areas where at least a few groups of
Baha'is are already present.     In areas where there are no Baha'is what-
soever, on the other hand, pioneering has been the most successful
strategy for cr.eating an initial nucleus of believers.    As will be
shown later, it was the voluntary pioneering efforts of a relatively
small number of Baha'is that succeeded in diffusing the Faith to a large
number of countries in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.

BELIEFS

The fundamental Baha'i belief is that God is one, religion is one,
and mankind is one.    The concept of one God is not so unusual as to merit
discussion in this context.    The belief in a single religion and a
unified mankind, however, is somewhat less self-evident and needs
clarification.

All the world's major revealed religions are, from the Baha'i point
of view, expressions of a single spiritual theme.     They all teach the
same spiritual truths and differ only in such non-essential aspects as
dogma, ritual, and social law.     The explanation of this situation is
that    God (or whatever name one wishes to attach to that Unknowable
Essence) educates man by revealing to him the spiritual truths via the
medium of Prophets--superhuman individuals whom God uses as instruments
of His will.     Prophets are physically human, but They invariably testify
that there is one God, that mankind must submit to His will, and that in

this world the best way to do that is to become as selfless as possible.
Ma~kind,    Baha'is believe, is capable of spiritual and intellectual
progress.     Thus it is that as we develop our capacities we move on from
one spiritual teacher to the next.     The teachings of one instructor--or
Prophet--are not denied by His successor; rather, they are reiterated,
reinforced, and used as the basis for an even more complete understanding
of man's relationship with God and his fellow     man.   From this perspec-
tive mankind is moving toward higher and higher levels of spiritual
perfection, a process that is made possible by the progressive revelations
of succeeding Prophets.     Each Prophet founds what man, from his limited
vantage point, perceives to be a separate religion, but these apparently
independent religions are really nothing more than successive chapters in
a single religious story.     The fact that each Prophet explicitly testifies
to the authenticity of His predecessor and reassures mankind that in the
future another Prophet will succeed Him is viewed by Baha'is as evidence
in support of this interpretation of religious history.      Since all
Prophets speak for the same God and exhibit behavioral qualities
exemplary of that God, They are, in the spiritual sense; the same person.
Thus, when Christ prophesizes His own return, He is indicating that Bis
spiritual light will return, albeit in a different physical body.

The differences which man perceives in the religious movements
founded by such Prophets as, for example, Buddha, Moses, and Mohammed
are a consequence of the varying forms of the essential spiritual message.
Why does the form vary?     Two different processes must be considered.
First, there is a legitimate variation in superficial form arising out of
the fact that each Prophet, corning as He does at a unique pOlnt in the

history of man's development, lays down a series of social laws and
observances designed to deal with the particular defects in man's social
fabric existing at that time.   As a result, the social laws and behavioral
constraints placed on man during one prophetic dispensation may be
significantly different from those ordained in another.

A much more profound cause of religion's differentiation, however,
is the propensity of man to corrupt the original spiritual revelation by
overlaying it with a bewildering array of dogmas and rituals that have
nothing whatsoever to do with the Prophet's original teachings.   These
accretions reinforce the temporal authority of the religious leaders, and
consequently become perversely important in the life of the religion.
Religious adherence comes to be measured more in terms of the outward
observance of the   prescribed ceremonies than the inner observance of the
spiritual truths.   The spiritual messages of all the Prophets are vulner-
able to this tendency towards corruption and defilement as time diminishes
the freshness and vitality of the original teachings.

The pattern is clear.   Each Prophet renews and expands the basic
spiritual message, thereby releasing a potent energy in the world that
transforms the hearts of men, attracts a multitude of believers, and
precipitates the attainment of a higher level of human civilization.
But with time the spiritual truths become obscured and the force of
religion weakens, the foundations of civilization crumble, and mankind
descends to a level where the material achievements of civilization may
still be extant but the spiritual light--the source of guidance--has
become extinguished.   It is at this point that a new Prophet can be
expected to arise and renew the cycle.

Baha'is believe that Baha'u'llah is the most recent of God's
Prophets.    They view His advent as being the source of a spiritual
regeneration that will encompass the whole of humanity and will overcome
the prejudices and self-interests that stand in the way of global
unification.    Toward this end, Baha'u'llah does not advocate the elimin-
ation of variety and the subjugation of individuality to a homogeneous
world culture; rather, He emphasizes the necessity of retaining rich and
stimulating diversity in a context of global loyalties and worldwide
commitments.

Baha'is derive their beliefs about the history and role of religion
from the writings of Baha'u'llah.    He has testified to the potency and
authenticity of previous prophetic dispensations, proclaimed Himself the
mouthpiece for God in this day, and affirmed the eventual appearance of
subsequent divine teachers.    He has given assurance that His dispensa-
tion will sweep away the divisive forces in the world and initiate a
period in human history characterized by global peace and human brother-
hood on a worldwide scale.    The Baha'i vision of the future presumes an
actualization of this assurance, but does not    ass~~e   that the process
will be automatic and painless.     Instead, it is expected that the future
world order will be realized through the dedicated and sacrificial
~ffort   of individual Baha'is wholeheartedly committed to making it happen.

One can identify in each Prophet's message a particular emphasis, or
focus, that seems to permeate the ensuing religious tradition.       Buddha
stressed detachment, Moses justice, Christ love, and Mohammed submission
to the will of God.     In a similar fashion, Baha'u'llah appears to have
emphasized unity.     He viewed the world as being in turmoil and attributed
the cause to lack of unity:

Behold the disturbances which, for many a long year, have
> afflicted the earth, and the perturbation that hath seized its
> peoples. It hath either been ravaged by war, or tormented by
> sudden and unforseen calamities. Though the world is encompassed
> with misery and distress, yet no man hath paused to reflect what
> the cause or source of that may be. Whenever the True Counsellor
> uttered a word in admonishment, 10, they all denounced Him as a
> mover of mischief and rejected His claim. How bewildering, how
> confusing is such behavior! No two men can be found who may be
> said to be outwardly and inwardly united. The evidences of dis-
> cord and malice are apparent ever~~here, though all were made for
> harmony and union. The Great Being saith: 0 well-beloved ones!
> The tabernacle of unity hath been raised; regard ye not one
> another as strangers. Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the
> leaves of one branch . • . . 17

This required unity of mankind, moreover, can only be effected by recog-
nition of the oneness of religion, the ultimate source of man's beliefs,
values, inspiration, and civilization.   Thus the Baha'i Faith seeks
world unity by encouraging universal acceptance of all God's Prophets.

Beware, 0 believers in the Unity of God, lest ye be tempted
> to make any distinction between any of the Manifestations of
> His Cause, or to discriminate against the signs that haVe ~c­
> companied and proclaimed their Revelation. This indeec is the
> true meaning of Divine Unity, if ye be of them that apprehend and
> believe this Truth. Be ye assured, moreover, that the works and
> acts of each and everyone of these Manifestations of God, nay
> whatever pertaineth unto them, and whatsoever they may manifest
> in the future, are all ordained by God, and are a reflectioIl of
> His will and Purpose. Whoso maketh the slightest possible
> difference between their persons, their words, their messages,
> their acts and manners, hath indeed disbelieved in God, hath
> repudiated His signs, and betrayed the Cause of his Messengers. 18

Baha'is perceive Baha'u'llah as being the Prophet for this day--no
more exalted than any other Prophet but the one who is capable of diag-
nosing the current ills of mankind and prescribing spiritual solutions.

The emphasis on unity underlies many of the basic tenets of the
Baha'i Faith, the principal ones of which are listed below.    Most of
these basic tenets were mentioned or alluded to by Baha'u'llah, but it
was 'Abdu'l-Baha who emphasized their importance and elaborated on their

The beliefs and principles to which Baha'is adhere are more numerous
and detailed than this brief discussion could possibly indicate.     They
are, furthermore, capable of being expressed in a wide variety of con-
texts and from a multitUde of perspectives.     In particular, it would

have been possible to focus only on those beliefs that can be reasonably
expected to have some bearing on the question of Baha'i diffusion.     But
it was felt that a summary of the Baha'i position which touches upon the
key beliefs while     emphasizing the primary theme (i.e., unity) would be
more indicative of the level of adoptability that the Faith possesses in
the   eyes of the world as a whole.    If, for example, a single belief, such
as the equality     of men and women, had been extracted from the Baha'i
entity and emphasized as a theoretically important factor in the diffusion
process, conclusions might have been reached regarding the likely
geographical distribution of its cultural ncceptability when in fact
analysis of some other idea, such as the compatibility of science and
religion, could have generated conflicting hypotheses.     When a person
becomes a Baha'i, or for that matter joins any religious movement, a
large number of beliefs will be adopted, many of which are natural expres-
sions of the person's previous view of the world, but some of which
probably do not mesh as well with his pre-existing values and beliefs.
Consequently, it is the general theme of the religion rather than its
multitude of constituent elements which is most likely to determine
whether it will be accepted or rejected.     The most lucid exposition of
the Baha'i theme has issued from the pen of Shoghi Effendi, and so his
words will stand as a summary statement:

The Revelation proclaimed by Baha'u'llah, His followers
> believe, is divine in origin, all-embracing in scope, broad in
> its outlook, scientific in its method, humanitarian in its
> principles and dynamic in the influence it exerts on the hearts
> and minds of men. The mission of the Founder of their Faith,
> they conceive it to be to proclaim that religious truth is not
> absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is continuous
> and progressive, that the Founders of all past religions, though
different in the non-essential aspects of their teachings, "abide

> in the same tabernacle, soar in the same heaven, are seated
> upon the same throne, utter the same speech and proclaim the
> same Faith." His Cause, they have already demonstrated, stands
> identified with, and revolves around, the principle of the
> organic unity of mankind as representing the consummation of
> the whole process of human evolution. This final stage in this
> stupendous evolution, they assert, is not only necessary but
> inevitable, that it is gradually approaching, and that nothing
> short of the celestial potency with which a divinely ordained
Message can claim to be endowed can succeed in establishing it.

The Baha'i Faith recognizes the unity of God and of His
> Prophets, upholds the principle of an unfettered search after
> truth, condemns all forms of superstitution and prejudice,
> teaches that the fundamental purpose of religion is to promote
> concord and harmony, that it must go hand-in-hand with science,
> and that it constitutes the sole and ultimate basis of a peace-
> ful, an ordered and progressive society. It inculcates the
> principle of equal opportunity, rights and privileges for both

CHAPTER III
A GEOHISTORY OF EARLY BAHA'I DIFFUSION:     1844-1921 1

THE WORLD IN 1844

In 1844 vast areas of the world still remained unknown to Western
civilization.    In North America large sections of the intermontaine west
were being explored by Fremont while in South America substantial por-
tions of the Amazon basin remained unpenetrated.       Except for its coastal
fringes, Africa south of the Sahara was completely unknown to the
Europeans.    It would be another ten years before Livingstone would make
the first crossing of the continent and marvel at the sight of the mighty
Zambezi's Victoria Falls, another twenty years before the younger Stanley
would cross further north and trace the course of the Congo.           Even the
discoveries of Lake Victoria and the headwaters of the Nile were nearly
two decades away.    Uganda, a modern day stronghold of the Baha'i Faith,
received its first European visitor in 1862, 18 years after the declara-
tion of the Bah.    Australia was a virtually unknown territory.        Except
for its southern rim and southeastern corner, the whole continent lay

lThe material presented in this chapter cannot be regarded as a
general history of Baha'i growth. The limitations both of my background
and of available source materials in English preclude the feasibility of
such a comprehensive undertaking. Instead, I try to identify historical
materials relevant to diffusion so that they can be analyzed from a
geographer's point of view. My objective is to reveal those forces and
conditions that were most instrumental in propelling and guidng the
diffusion process during the first 77 years of the religion. In that
sense, the narrative is extremely limited: it is nothing more than a
geographical analysis of diffusion using historical sO.rces.

unexplored by Western man and would not even be traversed until the
1860s.

By 1844 the first successful railroad was 14 years old and the
first transatlantic steamship crossing had occurred six years previously,
but it would be another seven years before a rail line would connect the
Atlantic with the Great Lakes, another 25 years before trains could
traverse the North American continent, and over 50 years until the Trans-
Siberian Railway would span Asia.       During the three decades immediately
following the birth of the Baha'i Faith methods of long distance trans-
portation would be revolutionized, and yet only by the end of that time
would it be    possible for Jules Verne to postulate the highly speculative
possibility that the world could be circled by a dedicated traveler in
a mere eighty days.

Methods    of communication were as primitive.      Of course the develop-
ment of the telephone and radio were events of the relatively distant
future, but even the electronic telegraph, the first of the major com-
municational innovations, was so new that commercial lines were not yet
available.     In fact, public use of    the telegraph was instituted the
day after the Bab declared himself to Mulla Husayn when on May 24th
Samuel Morse inaugurated service between Baltimore and Washington by
transmitting the famous message:        "What hath God wrought?"

Let this stand as a reminder that the technological conditions for
the diffusion of an innovation have undergone rapid and far-reaching
change since 1844.    The evolution of cultural and ideological systems,
although more difficult to define, was at least as dramatic.        Consider,
for example, that in 1844 mass education was a very new concept, univer-
sal suffrage was not a concept at all, and the revolutionary ideas of

Karl Marx and   Charles Darwin were as yet unpublished.   Suffice it to
say that in all important respects our world is a different world from
that which confronted mankind in the middle of the last century.

The virtual transformation of the world which has transpired during
the Baha'i religion's relatively brief period of historical development
strongly discourages the use of mechanistic diffusion models.   Without
exception, these   models make assumptions about the immutability of the
technological and social environment in which the innovation is spreading.
Often these assumptions can be relaxed, but in order to do so the in-
vestigator must append to his basic mathematical construct a sequence of
cumbersome computations that make the model more complex without expanding
its theoretical base.   In other words, the explanation of why diffusion
occurs the way it does remains unchanged and the increased complexity is
merely an attempt to improve the predictive power of the model--an
improvement which is a chimera since it is founded on mere statistical
accommodation of unintelligible forces that operated in a "predictable"
fashion in the past but mayor may not continue to operate so in the
future.   With some degree of reluctance, therefore, I abandon the hope of
deriving measurably correct generalizations about the nature of the
forces behind the broad sweep of Baha'i diffusion and turn my attentions,
rather, to the intermingled peculiarities of time and place that I believe
will explain why the Faith spread.

DIFFUSION IN THE TIME OF THE BAB:   1844-1853

In May of 1844, the Babi Faith first appeared in the Persian city
of Shiraz.   For forty days the Bab's only believer was Mulla Husayn,2 a

2Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 7.

man who, as a consequence of the teachings of his preceding religious
mentor,3 had     een eagerly anticipating the birth of a new religious dis-
pensation and had spontaneously travelled from Karbila in Iraq to Shiraz,
a distance of over 600 miles.    Mulla Husayn did not have an intended
destination for his travels; he was simply searching for the new Prophet
of God whose appearance he anticipated.     The forty day interlude following
Mulla Husayn's declaration of belief may be attributed to the Bab's in-
sistence that His spiritual mission not yet be proclaimed publicly.
Before open disclosure of His dispensation was to take place, the Bab
demanded that ". • . Eighteen souls must, in the beginning, spontaneously
and   of their own accord, accept Me and recognize the truth of My
Revelation.    Unwarned and uninvited, each of these souls must seek in-
dependently to find Me. . •        Mulla Husayn was the first   to do so.

Eventually the requisite eighteen disciples accepted the Bab as the
founder of a new religious dispensation.    All but one did so face-to-face
in Shirazi the exception was a young woman named Tahirih, then residing
in Karbila, who entrusted her brother-in-law with a letter declaring her
allegiance.    Her brother-in-law did seek out the Bab and become one of
His followers.    The Bab, upon receipt of Tahirih's letter, declared her

3Mulla Eusayn was a follower of Shaykh Ahrnad-i-Ahsa'i, a heterodox
Muslim who established a school of religious thought based on the notion
that the corrupted Islamic religion c0uld only experience spiritual regen-
eration through the influence of a new Manifestation of God, the appear-
ance of whom was imminent. Many of the Bab's earliest disciples were
formerly Shaykhis.

4Th e words of the Bab, presumably transmitted orally via Mulla
Husayn, as quoted by Nabil-i-A'zam in The Dawn-Breakers: Nabil's
Narrative of the Early Days of the Baha'i Revelation, trans. by Shoghi
Effendi (Wilmette, Illinois: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1974), p. 63.

a disciple, one of the group of eighteen that He referred to as the
Letters of the Living.

Quddus, another of the Letters of the Living, was the last of the
original band of disciples to declare himself.     Originally a Shaykhi
like Tahirih     and Mulla Husayn, Quddus left his horne in Barfurush in
search    of the new Manifestation; at the age of 22 he attained the
presence of the Bab in Shiraz.     Quddus eventually emerged as the recog-
nized leader of the Babis, in a sense the lieutenant of the Bab.       This
position of    leadership had originally rested with Mulla Husayn, but early
in the    summer of 1848 he indicated that instead the Babis should turn to
Quddus.

All existing historical narratives available in English emphasize
the preeminent roles of these three individuals during the tempestuous
years of the Bab's ministry.     They, apparently, were the three disciples
who most vociferously pursued the Bab's policy of nationwide dissemin-
ation.    The other   Letters of the Living probably were,   in many
instances, effective agents for the Bab, but evidence of their activities
is extremely fragmentary.

In the beginning, therefore, the Babis were nineteen in number:          the
Prophet-Founder with seventeen disciples in Shiraz and one believer in
Karbila, Iraq.

The absence of primary source materials in English, and the paucity
even of secondary sources, precludes any attempt to recreate a detailed
picture of the movements and activities of all the early believers and
the religious fervor that they generated.     Under the circumstances, the
most suitable approach for studying Babi diffusion is that of      mapping
the general population distribution in Persia at the time and then super-
imposing information regarding the movements of the Bab and His most

prominent disciples, the areas where Babis came into conflict with the
civil and ecclesiastical authorities, and the localities where Babis are
known to have concentrated.      The resulting map should demonstrate (1)
whether the Bab's intended program of nationwide proclamation did
actually materialize, and (2) whether the activities of His disciples
did generate a nationally distributed Babi population.      The information
for such a map must be culled from historical sources that are intended
to give the reader a feel for the development of the Faith and are not
necessarily concerned with recreating an accurate image of the unfolding
geographical distribution of      the Babis and their activities.   Con-
sequently, the final cartographic result must be incomplete and frag-
mentary, but this is only a serious problem if the analysis of the map
fails to permit a generally positive conclusion regarding the success of
the Bab's dissemination plans.

Figure 1 makes it clear that the Babi cause did indeed envelop the
whole national area and was not confined to a particular region of the
country.   Those areas for which Babi activity cannot be documented tend
to correspond closely to the regions of low population density and few

urban centers.       Furthermore, the movement patterns of the more prominent

5Th e compilation of information regarding population distribution
relied on sources that depict the present pattern. The austere
geography of large portions of Iran precludes the possibility of sub-
stantial settlement and makes it highly unlikely that the basic structure
of the distribution pattern was materially different 130 years ago. The
appropriateness of this assumption has been confirmed by analyzing the
regional narratives on historical geography contained in G. LeStrange,
The Lands of the Eastern Caliphate (3rd ed.; New York: Barnes and Noble,
1966).

disciples confirm that the Bah's injunction to travel and teach the new
religion was taken seriously.

The Bah had freedom of movement only during the first two years of
His ministry, and for nine months of that time He was occupied with a
pilgrimage to Mecca where He visited the birthplace of Mohammed.         From
the time the Bah left Shiraz in the summer of 1846, except for a very
brief interlude in Isfahan, until His ultimate execution in the market-
place in Tabriz, He was a prisoner of state held in confinement and
ordered from place to place by the Shah of Persia, his Grand Vizier Haji
Mirza Aqasi, and their     immedi~te   successors.   In spite of this confine-
ment, various historical sources confirm that the Bab's custodians were
invariably unwilling or somehow unable to sever contact between Him and
the pilgrims and messages that continually sought His presence.         In
effect, although the Bab's movements were controlled by the state and
His incarceration in the fortresses of Mah-Ku and Chihriq were deliberate
attempts to   isola~e   the head of the heretical movement from its most
troublesome body, the Bab always managed to maintain communication with
His followers.

One inexplicable aspect of the Bab's immediate impact on the in-
habitants of those cities and villages through which He passed and in
which He in some instances tarried is that, although in virtually every
locality His presence wrought enormous controversy and precipitated
large-scale conversion, in Tabriz His execution did not generate a
similar response.   In Shiraz, in Isfahan, in Milan, in Mah-Ku, in Khuy,
in Chihriq this controversial Prophet stimulated local diffusion. 6          In

6H• M. Balyuzi, The Bab (Oxford: George Ronald, 1973), pp. 89-90,

some places, such as Shiraz and Isfahan, He appears to have attracted
converts by means of His verbal eloquence, but in other localities, such
as Mah-Ku, Khuy, and Chihriq (where the Bab was held in much closer con-
finement), He seems to have diffused the Faith simply through the power
of His personality.     In one village--Milan--large-scale conversion was
effected through His performance of a healing miracle:

• . • In the morning, as we were setting out from Milan,
> an old woman brought a scald-headed child, whose head was so
> covered with scabs that it was white down to the neck, and
> entreated His Holiness (the Bab) to heal him. The guards
> would have forbidden her, but His Holiness prevented them,
> and called the child to him. Then he drew a handkerchief
> over its head and repeated certain words, which he had no
> sooner done than the child was healed. And in that place
> about two hundred persons believed and underwent a true and
> sincere conversion . . . . 7

This persistent pattern of receptivity to the Bab was played out
in Tabriz as well,8 but the surprising thing is that when He was brought
back to that city for the last time, the dramatic sequence of events
associated with His execution did not materially sway the local popu-
lace.     When the Bab was executed by a firing squad, the multitude of
onlookers witnessed an extraordinary occurrence.     The Bab and one of
His believers who was granted the privilege of being martyred with Him

History of Mirza Ali Muhammad the Bab by Mirza Huseyn of Hamadan

(Cambridge: The University Press, 1893), pp. 220-221. In this instance,
the author is relating what was told to Haji Mirza Jani (an early Babi
who compiled an historical account of the Faith and upon whose work
Mirza Huseyn apparently relied for substantial amounts of source material)
by Muhammed Big, the man who had been put in charge of the military
contingent consigned the task of conducting the Bab from Isfahan to
Tabriz. During the execution of this assigned duty Muhammed Big became
a Babi.

were suspended by ropes from a spike in the wall and fired upon by an
Armenian regiment of 750 Christian men under the command of a colonel
named Sam Khan.     When the smoke had cleared the Babi companion was
standing unhurt with his ropes severed while the Bab had vanished from
sight.     He was eventually discovered nearby completing a conversation
with His amanuensis--a conversation that had been interrupted by a local
official earlier in the day.      Once 2.gain the Bab and His companion were
strung up and     fired upon, and this time the execution was successful.
Sam Khan was not responsible, however, for after the first attempt he
was so shaken by what happened that he ordered his men out of the
barracks square and refused to have anything more to do with the execu-
tion.     Sam Khan was duly impressed by the miraculous nature of the Bab's
survival in the first instance, but the inhabitants of Tabriz apparently
did not view the event in the same way.      Nabil makes mention of what
happened immediately following the execution and comments on the relative
indifference of the Tabrizis:

The very moment the shots were fired, a gale of exceptional
> severity arose and swept over the whole city. A whirlwind of
> dust of incredible density obscured the light of the sun and
> blinded the eyes of the people. The entire city remained
> enveloped in that darkness from noon till night. Even so strange
> a phenomenon, following immediately in the wake of that still
> more astounding failure of Sam Kahn's reigment to injure the Bab,
> was unable to move the hearts of the people of Tabriz, and to
> induce them to pause and reflect upon the significance of such
> momentous events..     9

~1ho   can explain the fact that an apparent miracle in Milan was sufficient
to stimulate mass conversion whereas a seemingly miraculous event of even
greater dramatic proportions failed to have a similar result in Tabriz?

9Th e Dawn-Breakers, pp. 515-516.

Perhaps the fact that in the former instance the Bah seemed to be in
control of the event whereas in the latter case He was, in the eyes of
the onlookers, nothing more than a passive participant may have had
something to do with the divergent reactions.

According to Shoghi Effendi, the Bah spoke to the populace
immediately before His execution, addressing them in these words:

. "0 wayward generation! . . • Had you believed in ~1e
> every one of you would have followed the example of this
> youth [the one who wished to be martyred with the Bah] who
> stood in rank above most of you, and would have willingly
> sacrificed himself in My path. The day will come when you
> will have recognized Me; that day I shall have ceased to be
> with you. ,,10

It would seem that the Bah's admonishment fell on deaf ears, but this
surely had as much to do with the existence of the language barrier as
with the spiritual receptivity of the gathered crowd.    According to
Browne, who was writing some 45 years after the event:

The Azarbaijan dialect of Turkish is the language generally
> spoken in Tabriz, and only persons who have either received some
> education or travelled in other parts of Persia understand Persian.
> Indeed, Turkish prevails as far east as Kazvin, is widely spoken
> in Teheran, and is understood by many as far south as Kurn. l l
If this is true, then the final three years of the Bab's life--over
half His ministry--was spent not just in an isolated corner of Persia, not
only in continual confinement, but also in a region whose    inhabitants
could not understand a word He might say.   Perhaps, therefore, the surprise
is not so much that the people of Tabriz failed to respond to the Bah

but rather that such notable responses should have been forthcoming from
other parts of the region:    Mah-Ku, Khuy, Chihriq, and even Milan.

Badasht and Tabriz
In June and July, 1848, two events occurred which were to have a
powerful impact on the fortunes of the Faith.     In Badasht, a small village
near the border of the province of Mazindaran, a Babi conference was
organized by Baha'u'llah and attended by over eighty believers including
Tahirih and Quddus.   Shoghi Effendi states that:

• • . The primary purpose of that gathering was to implement
> the revelation of the Bayan by a sudden, a complete and dramatic
> break with the past--with its order, its ecclesiasticism, its
> traditions, and ceremonials. The subsidiary purpose of the con-
> ference was to consider the means of emancipating the Bab from
> His cruel confinement in Chihriq. The first was eminently
> successful; the second was destined from the outset to fail. 12

This declaration of independence from Muslim orthodoxy was perceived by
Persia's religious and temporal leaders as a direct challenge to their
authority.   Koranic law--the foundation of Persian society13_-was abro-
gated at the Council of Badasht and in its stead was proposed a societal

13The power of Islam in the nineteenth century is vividly portrayed
by Lord Curzon:

"Marvellously adapted alike to the climate, character and occupa-
> tions of those countries upon which it has laid its adamantine grip,
> Islam holds its votary in complete thrall from the cradle to the
> grave. To him it is not only religion, it is government, philosophy

structure based on the utterances and writings of the Bab.     By itself,
this brazen act of defiance would be sufficient to incur suppression,
but the fact that thousands of Persians all across the country were being
attracted to the Babi cause underscored the urgent need for counter-
measures.    The result was that, whereas before the Council of Badasht
harassment and persecution of the Babis was sporadic and local, after-
wards it was continuous and nationwide. 14   In both the theological and
historical senses, therefore, the conference was a momentous event.

In Tabriz, hundreds of miles away, a second occurrence greatly
reinforced the Babi alienation precipitated by the Council of Badasht.
The Bab, summoned from His place of incarceration, was obliged to undergo
an examination by a board consisting of the seventeen-year-old crown
prince and a number of leading divines in that area.    The ostensible
purpose of the interview was to determine the character of the Bab's
claims, but E. G. Browne expresses the view that the entire proceeding
was conducted with the singular intention of discrediting the Bab and
fabricating a pretext for his eradication. l S   Be that as it may, during
the course of the examination, the Bab made it clear that He was claiming
to be the Mahdi--the return of the Twelfth Imam promised by Shi'ah
tradition.    Such a declaration, proclaimed in clear and unmistakable
language, could not but disconcert the conservative powers in an Islamic

state since, if     the Bab was who He claimed, then He did indeed have the
right to annul the laws and     observances of Islam.    The Bab's proclama-
tion combined with the radical position taken by His believers at the
Council of Badasht thoroughly convinced the religious and secular leaders
that the movement represented a serious threat to their authority.          The
Babis, in turn, came to stand more clearly outside Islamic law, recog-
nizing the Bab's pronouncements as totally binding and ignoring any
Muslim laws and traditions that were not compatible with the Bab's
teachings.    Thus it was that the lines were drawn.

The Mazindaran Upheaval
From the summer of 1848, confrontations between the Babis and the
Persian nation took on a war-like complexion.       Between 1848 and 1850, four
particularly dramatic conflicts developed, each of which heightened the
visibility of the Babi cause:     upheavals in Mazindaran, Nayriz, and
Zanjan, and the public execution of seven Babis in Tehran.       Figure 1
identifies the location of    ~ach   of these four events and makes it
apparent that all parts of Persia were embroiled in the Babi controversy.

In Mazindaran, a few hundred Babis were forced to seek refuge from
both military forces and local inhabitants.      At the shrine of Shaykh
Tabarsi, not far from Barfurush, the Babis constructed a fortress to
protect themselves from their adversaries.       For over seven months they
held out against successive regiments arrayed against them by Nasiri'd-Din
Shah, the reigning monarch.     The first imperial army of 12,000 men was
actually put to flight by a sortie of some of the Babis under the command
of Quddus and Mulla Husayni16 subsequent military efforts to dislodge them

The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 360-362.

were similarly unsuccessful.     Ultimately, the original 313 Babis were
lured out of their homebuilt fortification with the promise that they
would not be harmed if they emerged from their fort and dispersed in
peace.   Once outside the protective walls, the Babis were slaughtered and
the fort razed.   A handful of them escaped death, but those that died
included half the Letters of the Living.     Mulla Husayn and Quddus were
among them. 1 7

Nabil-i-Azam managed to compile a partial list of those Babis who
perished in the Tabarsi disaster.     He identified 173 believers by name,
and for the vast majority of these he mentioned their places of origin.
Figure 2 identifies the source areas of all those Babis for whom Nabil
recorded this information.     Four observations can be made about the
spatial pattern that emerges.     First, it is apparent that the martyrs of
Fort Tabarsi were drawn in large numbers from the immediately surrounding
area (within a 100 mile radius).     Second, it is clear that in spite
of the important role that "local" residents played in the Tabarsi drama,
substantial numbers of participants came from very distant areas.        Third,

l7The temptation of comparing this seige with the battle of the
Alamo is too great to resist. Of course the defense of the Alamo was
undertaken for nationalistic and military reasons, and was not a conflict
founded in religious differences. In terms of drama and heroism, however,
numerous parallels exist. The siege of the Alamo, which occurred early
in 1836, pitted 4,000 Mexican troops against a collection of 174 Texas
nationalists. The Texans killed about 1,500 of Santa Ana's troops and
held out for 11 days before being overwhelmed. At Tabarsi, thirteen
years later, 313 Babis withstood the onslaught of thousands of Persian
troops (estimates range from 3,000 to well over 10,000), killed some
1,500 soldiers, and persisted for seven months before capitulating.
All the defenders of the Alamo were killed; a handful of the Tabarsi
defenders survived.

there seem to have been relatively few recruits drawn from the southern
parts of the country.     Fourth, the Fort Tabarsi recruits were drawn almost
entirely from localities that had been visited by the principal leaders
of the religion (see Figure 1).

In order to obtain even a partial understanding of this distribu-
tional pattern we must look at the events leading up to the siege of
Fort Tabarsi.   Quddus had intended to travel to Mashad following the
Council of Badasht and in anticipation of that journey had directed Mulla
Husayn to precede him.    After the Council, however, Quddus was seized
and held in detention in the town of Sari.     Eventually, Mulla Husayn
received a message from the Bab directing him to leave Mashad and travel
to the aid of Quddus.     According to Nabil, Mulla Husayn departed with 202
followers, stopped in each village along the way to Sari, spoke to the
inhabitants about the Bah, and selected from among the resulting converts
a few who were invited to join the itinerant group.     Apparently, Mulla
Husayn struck a particularly responsive chord in the village of Miyamay
since 33 inhabitants declared their faith in the Bah and became part of
the travelling band. 18    As the contingent approached Savad-Kuh on the
borders of Mazindaran, Mulla Husayn addressed them and issued a warning
that they were predestined to be martyred in the cause of the Bab and
that any who entertained second thoughts about their commitment should
accompany him no further.     Mirza Huseyn of Hamadan states in his history
of the Faith that at this time Mulla Husayn had 230 companions, 30 of

18 The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 325-326, 418-419. On p. 326 Nabil indicates
that 30 villagers from Miyamay joined the cause, but on pp. 418-419 he
tabulates 33.

whom decided not to continue on. 19   If this is true, then, except in the
village of Miyamay, Mulla Husayn must have lost as many converts as he
gained along the road from Mashad.

From Savad-Kuh, the Babis pressed northward until they reached
Barfurush.   Skirmishes with the local population resulted in the death of
half a dozen Babis, but the Barfurushi assailants were routed.     Representa-
tives of the villagers approached Mulla Husayn asking him for peace and
suggesting that it might be better if the Babis continued their journey.
Mulla Husayn acceded to.these requests and on the following day the Babis
departed with an armed escort from Barfurush.     Some distance southwest of
the town, near the site of the shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi the armed escort
turned on theiL charge, and once again the Babis were obliged to disperse
their adversaries.   That was not the end of the conflict, however, for
the next day at the site of the shrine the Babis were once again attacked,
this time by the inhabitants of the nearby village of Qadi-Kala who were
bent upon avenging the humiliating defeat suffered by the armed escort
from Barfurush.   It was at this point, perceiving his group to be unduly
exposed to the hostile attacks of surrounding villagers, that Mulla
Husayn made the decision to fortify the Shrine.     Once the fortifications
had been completed Mulla Husayn dispatched a small group of men to the
nearby town of Sari to obtain the release of Quddus; they were successful.

Various accounts indicate that when Quddus reached Fort Tabarsi there
were 313 believers present.   This is substantially more than the 230
who set out from Savad-Kuh a short time earlier.     One historical record,

19Browne (trans. and ed.), The Tarikh-i-Jadid, pp. 47-48.

commonly referred to as the Traveller's Narrative,20 states that Quddus
arrived at the garrison"       . . with a number of other persons . . . ,,21
while Nabil intimates that he reached Tabarsi unaccompanied, having already
urged any who wished to be with him to move on and join up with Mulla
Husayn. 22   Either way, it might have been associates of Quddus who
accounted for the mysterious appearance at the fort of some 90 new
defenders.   On the other hand, perhaps Nabil's list of 173 Tabarsi
martyrs is more complete than he realized.

Judging by the events leading up to the Tabarsi conflict it would
seem likely that most of the Babi defenders would not have been from the
surrounding environs of Barfurush and would have been much more strongly
representative of eastern Persia, especially Khurasan, than of the more
densely populated regions to the west.      After all, most of the recruits
for the Tabarsi fort came all the way from Mashad with Mulla Husayn.
Presumably they would not have been in that distant corner of the empire
unless they had roots in the region.      Nevertheless, Nabil's compilation
of martyrs clearly suggests the opposite:      many were from not very far
away and of the ones   ~mo   did come from some distance a majority were from
the west and center (especially Isfahan), not the east.       How can this be

20Vernon Johnson states that 'Abdu'l-Baha authored this work, a
fact that E. G. Browne only discovered after he had translated and
pUblished it. Vernon Elvin Johnson, "An Historical Analysis of Critical

explained?   Perhaps the large numbers of recruits from nearby were
recent converts to the Faith who, upon hearing Mulla Husayn's emotional
appeals and observing the courageousness that the Babis exhibited under
duress, flocked to the support of the beleagured group.      That might
explain the discrepancy between the number of Babis who left Savad-Kuh
and the number who occupied Fort Tabarsi. 23     It may also be that the
large number of Babis from Mazindaran was the work of Quddus for apparent-
ly even Muslim historians admit that he converted three hundred in a
week about the time that Mulla Husayn and his band were approaching the
shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi. 24    Anyway, the events surrounding the precip-
itation of the Tabarsi seige were replete with opportunities for the
Babis to display their valor and as E. G. Browne has observed " • . .
nothing so greatly conduced to the fame and diffusion of the Babi religion
as the unflinching courage with which its adherents confronted death.

As to why so many of the Tabarsi martyrs originally came from
farther west and   so~th,   the only rational explanation would seem to be
that the Babis were extremely mobile.      The willingness of 200 believers
to ignore the exigencies of their personal lives and accompany on foot

Mulla Husayn from Mashad to Sari (over 300 miles) is evidence of this,
as is the obviously migratory behavior of the Letters of the Living
(see Figure 1).      We know that large numbers of the early believers

travelled great distances to see the Bab at Mah-Ku           and Chihriq,27 and
there are numerous instances in which the Bab urged followers to under-
take journeys.      Perhaps the most pertinent evidence bearing on this
question of how Fort Tabarsi carne to rely on manpower from distant regions
to the west and south, however, is contained in Nabil's account of how he
became a Babi.      Incidental mention is made of the fact that the Bab
enjoined all His followers to ". • . 'proceed to Mazindaran and lend their
assistance to Quddus, who is now hemmed in by the forces of an unre-
lenting foe.    I

,,28   Presureably, a number of believers in the western
and central regions would have responded to this call, thereby explaining
not just the geographical breadth of the Fort Tabarsi hinterland, but
perhaps also the mysterious increase in the number of adherents who were
at t.he fort.

Figure 2 identifies a surprisingly large number of Tabarsi martyrs
as having originated in Isfahan.        There is no ready explanation of why
this city should have been so heavy a contributor to the ranks of the

Tabarsi defenders, but it should be noted that Mulla Husayn was very
successful in obtaininy converts when he passed through in 1844 on his
way north,29 and it was only in Isfahan that the Bab enjoyed relative
freedom of action following His return from pilgrimage.

The lack of Fort Tabarsi participants from the extreme south of
Persia--especially the Persian Gulf littoral--fits well with this obser-
vation that appeared in a gazetteer of the Persian Gulf in 1908:

The new Babi religion in Persia . • . does not appear to
> have obtained as yet much hold on the coast of the Persian
> Gulf, notwithstanding that the Bab visited Bushehr at an early
> stage in his public career. It was reported that at Bushehr
> there were in 1905 only about 50 Babis, chiefly employed in
> the Customs Department or in the Artillery; a very few others
> were found at the ports of Bandar 'Abbas and Lingeh, and
> possibly at Shehr-i-Viran in the Livari district . . . It is
> probable, however, that Babis are to be found in places where
> their existence has not been ascertained. 30

This is the one region of Persia for which historical sources do not
document considerable penetration by the Babi movement.    It is inter-
esting to note that this littoral zone is predominantly Arabic speaking
and is the main beachhead of the Sunnis in Persia. 31   The Faith may have
had less appeal to Muslims who did not share the Shi'ah reverence for the
Incarnate and would not, therefore, respond to the Bab's claim to be the
Mahdi.   However, it should also be kept in mind that this region was
thinly populated.   Babi underrepresentation may not have been as sub-
stantial as available historical sources indicate.

Before abandoning this analysis of the conflict at Fort Tabarsi
it would be worthwhile to consider a further source of information
regarding the Babis involved in the struggle.     Edward Browne possessed a
copy of a manuscript that detailed the events of the incident, as narrated
by one of the few surviving insurgents.     He published a summary of its
contents and in doing so elected to present the part of the work which
tabulated the geographic origins of the participants. 32    Table 1 lists
the localities from which the Babis were drawn, indicates the number of
men from each locality, and compares that information with the equivalent
data supplied by Nabil.

A comparison of the two tabulations is somewhat awkward since
Nabil's list is an incomplete enumeration of those who perished at
Fort Tabarsi whereas the list proffered by Browne claims to be a complete
enumeration of all those who entered the province of Mazindaran with
Mulla Husayn.    In spite of the fact that the two tabulations refer to
somewhat different populations and to slightly different points in time,
it would be reasonable to expect them to be roughly comparable.

There is in fact a fair amount of correlation between the two
lists, and as would be anticipated the tabulated quantities in Nabil's
list are consistently lower than in Browne's (with two major exceptions:
Miyamay and Sang-i-Sar).     No attempt will be made to explain the sub-
stantial discrepancies between the lists; they simply must be taken at
face value.     As to which tabulation is more likely to be accurate, it is
impossible to say.     Nabil's inventory has the ring of authority since it
lists people by name; Browne's, however, was compiled by a participant
at the time of the event.

aSome of the 27 Babis listed in The Dawn-Breakers as having
originated from the province of Mazindaran may be the same Babis as
Materials for the Study of the Babi Relicion listed as having oome from
Kashan, Badasht, Amul, and Shaykh Tabarsi.

The compilation by Browne suggests a rather different geographic
pattern from that which was recreated from Nabil's list.    As Figure 3
shows, Browne's tabulation recognizes a stronger representation from
Khurasan.     Furthermore, his list indicates that there were noticeably
fewer recruits from the immediate environs of Fort Tabarsi.

The most startling aspect of Figure 3, however, is that it suggests
a much more diffuse distribution of Babis than is generally recognized.
The accepted view within the Baha'i Faith is that up until 1853 the
only areas that the movement had touched were Persia and Iraq,33 and
yet if the information in Figure 3 is accepted then there must have been
believers in a number of other distant foreign lands.     Herat, in modern
Afghanistan, apparently contributed 14 Babis to Mulla Husayn's con-
tingent, while India, the Fergana valley in Turkestan, and perhaps Turkey
and Pakistan, also had representatives.     Even Iraq, which is contained
in Nabil's list of contributing areas, shows up more boldly in Browne's.

The presence of the Faith in Herat might be explained by Mashad's
critical location on the great Khurasan road.     Constructed under the
Abbasid dynasty, this transportation link was the most important of the
major routes radiating outward from Baghdad.     It stretched across
northern Persia, through Turkestan, into the Fergana Valley, and on to
the borders of China.     At Nishapur, just west of Mashad, a branch road
passed southeast to Herat and finally to Zaranj in the ancient land of
Sijistan.     Both these routes were designed to link the eastern frontiers
of the Muslim empire with the imperial capital and to afford overland

access between the eastern regions and the pilgrimage destination of
Mecca. 34    Both roads were in place well before the year 1000, and the
road to Zaranj became an access route to India only a few centuries
later. 35    Thus, Mashad lay near the junction of two major transasiatic
roads along which people and goods had been travelling for centuries.           It
is not hard to envision Babi zealots passing along these routes in the
earliest    year~   of the Faith.   Since Mulla Husayn recruited men from
Mashad to accompany him on his long trek westwards (via the great Khurasan
road) to Mazindaran, it is understandable that some of his band might have
originated further east, probably coming together at Mashad where the two
major routes linked.

As for India, Babis in that country could have arisen out of the
labors of two obscure figures in early Babi history.        One of the Letters
of the Living was an Indian named Shaykh Sa'id-i-Hindi.        He returned to
his native land to proclaim his newly found religion, but nobody knows
his fate. 3 6   A second Indian, a dervish who came to be called Qahru'llah,
saw the Bab in a vision and claimed that the image before his eyes
summoned him to Adhirbayjan.        He travelled to Chihriq and accepted the
Bab's religion.       Directed to return to India and promote the Faith,

36Balyuzi, The Bab, p. 27.  His name does crop up in connection with
an Indian Babi. Apparently, Shaykh Sa'id-i-Hindi converted a prominent

Pakistan. The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 588-589.

Qahru'llah walked home and was never heard from again. 37 Either of these
men might have been responsible for a fledgling Indian commumity.

A similarly inconclusive chain of events may have been responsible
for establishing the Babi Faith on Turkish soil.     One of the Letters of
the Living, a man named Mulla 'Aliy-i-Bastami was dispatched to Iraq by
the Bab.    When he arrived in Najaf he proclaimed his Faith to all who
would listen, but his efforts resulted in his being branded a heretic,
for which he was escorted to Baghdad and deported to Constantinople.
En route, he passed through Mosul where he stimulated interest in the new
revelation, but while historical records do not reveal what happened
after that,38 he could have been the founder of the Babi religion in
Turkey.

Confrontations in Nayriz, Zanjan, and Tihran
The incident at Fort Tabarsi was not the only confrontation between
the Babis and the conservative Musliln authorities of the Persian church-
state.     In May of 1850 an inveterate Babi commonly referred to as Vahid 39
travelled to Nayriz where he converted large numbers, many of whom were
prominent and influential people. 40    The governor of Nayriz, vexed by the

the Shah dispatched him to Shiraz to interview the Bah and ascertain the
nature of His claims. Vahid's interviews with the Bah resulted in his
conversion. The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 171-176.

evident influence of this heretic, recruited an army of a thousand men
and set out to take him prisoner.    Vahid fled from Nayriz and sought
refuge outside town in the fort of Khajih.    Accompanied by about 70
fellow believers, Vahid offered resistance to the governor's siege.
Reinforcements were brought in from Shiraz to help dislodge the heretics,
but after a few weeks, during which time the government forces sustained
considerable losses, Vahid was invited to the royalist camp to discuss
methods of calming the situ&tion.    As with the Tabarsi disaster, the
Babis were promised safe passage if they dispersed, but were slaughtered
by the royalist forces after they left the fort.    The strangulation and
decapitation of Vahid was the beginning of a reign of terror in Nayriz;
Babis were hunted down, tortured and killed, and their property con-
fiscated. 4 l

Far to the northwest, in the town of Zanjan, a struggle of much
greater proportions was beginning to materialize.    So similar is the
tale of Zanjan to those of Nayriz and Mazindaran that the details of the
conflict will be omitted. 4 2   It will simply be noted that after trouble
arose between Babis and Muslims, some 300 to 400 Babi men with their
families barricaded themselves in a citadel and held out for seven months
against an estimated 30,000 royal troops and 19 pieces of artillery.43

These manpower estimates are drawn from a section of Mirza Jani's history

These three episodes--Zanjan, Nayriz, and Tabarsi--were not the only
instances of armed conflict between the Babis and the authorities during
the early years of the Faith, but they were the largest and most dramatic.
They became symbols of the resolve and the power that faith can spawn,
not just to the Babi adherents, but to their adversaries as well.    In
each case, historical narratives intimate that the heroic behavior of the
Babis often exercised a positive influence over the minds of those who
were apprised of their resistance.   The result was rapid local diffusion.
with the culmination of each struggle and the subsequent slaughter of the
overwhelmed religionists, however, the danger of open proclamation of
faith would drive the new believers underground.   Farther afield, as
details of the conflict gradually became known, additional diffusion
would occur, but not with such rapidity.

The tumultuous events associated with Tabarsi, Nayriz, and Zanjan
were indicative of the deteriorating relationship between the Babis and
the established government.   Large in scope and extended in duration,
these armed conflicts purchased public sympathy and admiration for the
Babis and their cause.   But the price was high.   Many Babis, including
most of the strong leaders of the religion, had perished.    This decimation
of the leadership (which of course reached its climax with the shooting
of the Bab) was accelerated in March of 1850 by the execution of seven
prominent Babis in Tihran.    Thirty-eight people were arrested (some known

to be Babis and some only suspected of being sympathizers) and charged
with plotting the assassination of Mirza Taki Kahn, the Grand Vizier.
Eventually, the government decided that those who would recant their
Faith would be released while those who would not would be beheaded.     Of
the fourteen known Babis, seven refused to compromise their beliefs and
were put to the sword.   Their willingness to lay down their lives for the
Faith astonished the public gathering and captured the attention of the
entire capital city.44   This is what Browne had to say about these seven
men and the impact of their steadfastness on the spread of the Faith:

. They were men representing all the more important
> classes in Persia--divines, dervishes, merchants, shop-keepers,
> and government officials; they were men who had enjoyed the

The Bloodbath of 1852
In August of 1852 an attempt on the life of the Shah by a Babi
youth induced the Persian government to adopt a policy of extermination
toward the Babis.   Initially confined to Tihran, the reign of terror
quickly spread to Mazindaran and thereafter engulfed the whole country.46
It was during this time that Tahirih, having already been held as a
prisoner since her return to Tihran following the council of Badasht, was
put to death.   It was at this time, too, that Baha'u'llah was imprisoned
in a dungeon in Tihran for four months and ther., on the presumption that
His ill health would terminate His life and thereby accomplish the same
result as an execution without incurring the protestations of the Russian
minister,47 was exiled from Persia.   This was also the period that
witnessed the slaughter of thousands of Babis throughout the land. 48

At this point, only nine years after its inception, the Babi
religion appears to have been close to extinction.    According to Shoghi
Effendi,   writing nearly one hundred years later:

48Estimates range from 10,000 to 30,000.     The Dawn-Breakers, p. 605,

One might suspect that Shoghi Effendi was exaggerating the enfeebled
condition of the religion in order to dramatize its subsequent revival,
but such a suspicion would be unfounded.       Consider the following extract
from a letter written in 1862 by the Grand Mutjahid of Tauris regarding
the heretical nature of the Babis and the need for their removal from
Baghdad:

After the carrying out of these energetic measures on the
> part of the Persian government for the extirpation and ex-
> termination of the misguided and detestable sect of the Babis
> with the details of which your excellency is fully acquainted,
> • . . their roots were torn up. It was proper, nay necesEary,
> that not one of them should be suffered to survive.      50

The author of this letter is clearly expressing the view that the Faith
was purged from Persia.    He goes on to note that Eaha'u'llah was unfor-
tunately allowed to escape to Iraq from whence He was able to reestablish
the religion in its    ho~eland,   but the writer believed the movement to
have been defeated until from His place of exile Baha'u'llah began to
restore it.

Following this low point in the fortunes of the Faith, recovery was
rapid.     Gobineau, writing in the mid-1860s, expressed the following view
regarding the strength of the Babis in Persia:

> 49 The Dawn-Breakers, p. 651.

His perception of a rejuvenated Babi Faith was corroborated by Lord
Curzon who, twenty-five years later, wrote that ",       . if Babism con-
tinues to grow at its present rate of progression, a time may conceivably
come when it \-Till oust Mohammedanism from the field in Persia. . . . ,,52

DIFFUSION IN THE TIME OF BAHA'U'LLAH: 1853-1892

The Banishments of Baha'u'llah
Previous to 1853 the Babi cause was largely confined to Persia and
adjacent parts of Iraq.     We have seen some evidence that Babis were
present in other regions--especially India, Afghanistan, Turkestan, and
Turkey--but the sizes and permanence of Babi groups in those regions
apparently were not sufficient to leave an impression on the early his-
tory of the religion.     It could even be said that Babi influence in these

outlying regions ceased to exist when heavy persecution in Persia cut
off the communication that presumably sustained such isolated frontier
communities.

However much the Babi Faith may have spread in its earliest years,
the persecutions of 1853 precipitated a contraction of the religion's
influence; at the time of Baha'u'llah's banishment to Baghdad well-
established communities existed only in Persia and Iraq.      The former
community, however, had been driven into hiding whereas the latter,
although relatively free of official persecution, was much smaller in
size and was demoralized by the adversity which had overwhelmed the
religion in the land of its founder.

Baha'u'llah resided in Baghdad for ten years.      During that time He
assumed an increasing amount of authority within the religion so that
when, on the eve of His departure for Constantinople in the spring of
1863, He proclaimed Himself to be the Manifestation of God promised by
the Bab, He was accepted by most of the Bab's followers.      This personal
ascendance of Baha'u'llah, first as the de facto leader of the dis-
organized Babis and later as a recognized Prophet of God commanding the
allegiance of all Baha'is, made it possible for the Faith to escape the
regional confines of its place of birth.    Required by government decrees
to live outside Persia, Baha'u'llah's position of authority assured
international growth for the Faith.    ~{hatever   His place of residence, a
steady flow of believers would pass in both directions between there and
the cradle of the religion in Persia and Iraq.      Each new place of exile,
therefore, became a hotbed of Baha'i activity and a source area for sub-
sequent international diffusion probably directed by Baha'u'llah Himself.

Furthermore, it was under His leadership that new believers began to be
recruited from other sources than the Shi'ah sect of Islam. 53

Figure 4 describes the movements of Baha'u'llah during His 39 year
ministry.    Only the places where He resided for any length of time are
indicated on the map; towns and locali.ties through which He passed are
not shown.

His ten years of exile in Iraq were not all spent in Baghdad.       In
1854 internal dissension reached such a height that Baha'u'llah retired
from the company of His fellow Babis and spent two years alone in the
mountains of Kurdistan.    During this period the Babi community was
bereft of effective leadership.    Many claimed to be the Promised One
foretold by the Bab,54 and yet no person or group was sufficiently well
recognized to codify the principles of Babi behavior and morality.55
Baha'u'llah's retu£n to Baghdad marked the beginning of a long and steady
systematization of the religion as well as, incidentally, the evolution
of the Faith from a Babi to Baha'i form.    Although Baha'u'llah's absence
from view inhibited the overall growth potential of the Faith for two
years, it did result in the establishment of a new nucleus of believers
in Kurdistan; He attracted a group of followers, many of whom were Kurds
and Arabs. 56

Apparently, the portion of Baha'u'llah's ministry spent in Iraq
was a time of relative freedom of movement.   The exiles which followed
were much more confining.   Four months in Constantinople and five years
in Adrianople were times of personal confinement, but with access to the
Baha'is who journeyed to see Him.   The extended confinement in 'Akka was
characterized by incarceration and complete isolation for the first two
years, ten years of close confinement during which prohibitions against
contact were gradually relaxed, and finally twelve years of loose con-
finement outside the city of 'Akka where the flow of piJgrims could pro-
ceed uninterrupted.

For most of the years of His ministry, therefore, Baha'u'llah was
able to maintain contact with the community of   ~elievers.   But even so,
His relative isolation made communication difficult.   The distance from
Tihran to Adrianople is over 1,200 miles; that from Tihran to 'Akka
exceeds 800.   In the latter half of the nineteenth century even the
shorter of these two journeys required months of travel.      In a sense,
by banishing Baha'u'llah to the farther reaches of its geographical
extent, the Ottoman empire made inveterate travellers out of the Baha'i
population left behind in the homeland of the Faith.

Diffusion Under Baha'u'llah
Figure 5 identifies the regions that are known to have been opened
to the Faith during the ministry of Baha'u'llah.    The most notable
characteristic of Baha'i diffusion during this period is the extent to
which Persia was preempted as a direct source for the opening of new
territories.   The vast majority of all Baha'is resided in Persia and yet

it was Baha'u'llah's places of banishment which became the generating
foci for long distance diffusion.    This simple plot of diffusion flows
shows the degree to which Baha'u'llah directed the diffusion process.
I have not been able to uncover historical doccumentation that Baha'u'llah
actually instructed believers to proceed to the areas shown on the map as
having been opened,57 but why else would a believer who had previously
followed Baha'u'llah from Persia (or Iraq) to His place of exile suddenly
set off for some country lying totally outside the Baha'i ecumene?

It should be noted that Persia's role in the diffusion process was
significant.     Even though most countries were not opened directly from
Persia, many of the first in-migrants had Persian names.     Most of the
diffusion which occurred from Baha'u'llah's places of exile was the work
not of local converts but of Persian Baha'is who had travelled to see
their Prophet.     In other words, Persia supplied the manpower, but
Baha'u'llah supplied direction.

International diffusion did not occur in a contagious fashion, the
mass of potential diffusion agents in Persia did not simply overspill its
boundaries and establish the Faith in surrounding areas.     Instead, a
process vaguely similar to hierarchical diffusion occurred in that large
cities seem to have been the destinations of the believers travelling to

57 I t can be documented that He directed specific believers to go
to certain areas to proclaim the Faith but one cannot be certain that
the countries opened during His ministry were first penetrated in this
way. For examples of Him giving travel teaching directions to His
followers see: 'Abdu'l-Baha, Memorials of the Faithful, trans. and
annotated by Marzieh Gail (Wilmette, Illinois: Baha'i Publishing Trust,
1971), pp. 46, 135; Adib Taherzadeh, The Revelation of Baha'u'llah:
Baghdad, 1853-63 (Oxford: George Ronald, 1975), pp. 37-38, 95.

new areas:   'Ishqabad, Bukhara, and Tashkent in Turkestan; Bombay in
India; Cairo in Egypt; Marseilles in France; Shanghai in China.     This is
to be expected since a foreigner who would arrive via one of the major
transportation routes which invariably connect up the large cities,
would probably find that he could most easily fit into the metropolitan
environment, containing as it does economic, cultural, and linguistic
variety that is usually absent in the countryside.

Another characteristic of Baha'i diffusion that emerges from
Figure 5 is its general confinement to the Islamic realm.   With two
exceptions, Baha'i expansion proceeded entirely within the geographical
sphere of influence of the Islamic world, and in the two exceptional
cases of France and China the foray of early believers failed to estab-
lish truly lasting Baha'i communities:   in France there was no after-
effect whatever; in China a small nucleus of Persian Baha'is who became
established in Shanghai and persisted well into the twentieth century
apparently died out.   The cultural and economic elements that compose the
Islamic world encompass a broad diversity, but relative to the differ-
ences between it and such major religio-cultural hearths as Christian
Europe, Buddhist and Confucionist China, and Hindu India, there is a
substantial amount of homogeneity.   As part of this Islamic world, Persia
has much in common with the other nations that follow the path of Mohammed.
It would seem that the Baha'i Faith had to burst its cultural bonds in a
staged fashion.   First the religion was confined to the geographical
limits of Shi'ah dominance.   Then it permeated, but could not transcend,
the rest of the Islamic world.   Finally, after the death of Baha'u'llah,
the Faith took root in truly foreign environments.

The various countries and regions opened to the Faith during the
ministry of Baha'u'llah did not show a uniform pattern of response to
the new religion.   Some countries came to   hav~   larger and more established
Baha'i communities than others.     Pakistan, Burma, and especially India
became strong centers of the Faith, increasing their numbers of believers
with each passing decade.     Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Israel (Palestine),
Egypt, and the Sudan managed to maintain and gradually nurture the Baha'i
communities, but growth has never been as substantial as on the Indian
subcontinent.   Of this group, Egypt and Israel have been somewhat more
successful than the others, Turkey somewhat less.      Of the two regions
opened to the Faith in southern Russia, the Turkestan community exhibited
extremely rapid growth while the Baha'i foothold in the Caucasus, al-
though overshadowed by its counterpart farther east, was similarly
effective in sustaining expansion.     Baha'i representation in both of
these areas virtually disappeared, however, when government suppression
became severe in the 1930s.

It is this factor of governmental policy which more than anything
else seems to have determined the degree to which the Faith has succeeded
in becoming permanently entrenched in a new area.      Throughout the Middle
and Near East the close association of church and state has militated
against the Baha'i Faith.     Unwillingness to recognize the Faith as an
independent religion has resulted in frequent bans on all Baha'i
activity and sporadic outbursts of persecution.       It is one thing to adopt
an innovation that merely requires a substantial departure from the
traditional way of thinking and behaving; it is quite another to align

oneself with a movement that stands on the fringe of society and arouses
the suspicion and ire of government and populace alike.

Of all the territories opened to the Faith during the ministry of
Baha'u'llah, the most fascinating is Turkestan. 58   This area, close to
Persia and in fact only recently transferred from Persian to Russian con-
trol, was late in receiving its first Baha'i immigrants.     Not until the
1880s did the first believers enter the region, and when they arrived
they established themselves most effectively in 'Ishqabad, a small
village only a short distance from the Persian border.     The village lay
along the projected route of the Transcaspian railway, however, and so the
Russian government had targeted it for development as a city.     The
Baha'is arrived at an opportune time, managing to purchase property,
establish businesses, and generally prosper as their new horne underwent
a rapid transformation from village to metropolis.   As early as 1890 the
Baha'is numbered about 1,000, many of whom were well-to-do and influ-
ential.   For about four decades the community of believers prospered and
the religion achieved a level of development that has never been equalled.
'Ishqabad was one of the first communities in the world to have an
organized local Spiritual Assembly.   A Baha'i temple built there just

58The following discussion, which focues primarily on 'Ishqabad,
derives its information from an unpublished paper by Anthony A. Lee
entitled "City of Love: The Rise of the Baha'i Faith in 'Ishqabad,
from the Beginnings to the Russian Revolution." At the time that I
received the paper (January 1978) it was not in its final form and so
the author was concerned that none of its contents be quoted directly.
Lee relied heavily on personal interviews with Baha'is who are familiar
with the history of the region.

after the turn of the century preceded the Baha'i temple in North
America and claims the distinction of being the first ever constructed.
The Baha'is had their own meeting hall, their own schools, their own
medical-clinic, their own pilgrim house, even their own cemetery.            They
owned their own printing presses, published their own magazine, built
libraries, organized youth clubs, established cultural and athletic
societies, and   eliminated poverty within the group.        By 1918 the Baha'is
numbered about 4,000, which is four times the size of the largest Baha'i
community in the United States today.        Of course Iran can claim larger
communities, but in that country the believers have never been allowed
the freedom of activity that permitted the sort of cultural and religious
richness achieved in    I   Ishqabad.   Even after the Russian revolution the
'Ishqabad community enjoyed growth of numbers and diversity; Communist
suppression of religions did not begin until late in the 1920s.

And what was the fate of this symbol of Baha'i opulence?           The
Communist persecutions of the 1930s curtailed its activities, undermined
its integrity, and eventually eradicated its visible presence.          Even
the temple, which was confiscated by the authorities and later damaged by
an earthquake, has since disappeared.

The downfall of the Baha'i community in 'Ishqabad, although cer-
tainly precipitated by obvious external forces, must be attributed at
least in part to certain inherent defects.         In their prime, the Baha'is
were the wealthiest class in the city and the most powerful religious
force in the area.     At the same time, the community was composed almost
exclusively of Persian expatriates.        What a fatal combination!    Their
diversity of institutional forms and cultural activities was not matched

by an equivalent variety of socio-economic and ethnic characteristics.
This lack of demographic variety rendered the community helpless when
faced with a government dedicated to the uprooting of capitalism and a
local population that had little concern for the tribulations of a group
of wealthy foreigners.    'Ishqabad stands as an example of the fragility
of any Baha'i community that fails to draw its support from all elements
of the local society.    It testifies to the fact that numbers alone do
not insure ultimate success.

Manpower and Leadership:    A Study of Their Sources
In the last section it was suggested that diffusion during
Baha'u'llah's ministry was effected through a combination of His leader-
ship and Persian manpower.     This short discussion will attempt to rein-
force that conclusion by presenting evidence which documents the
preponderant flow of pilgrims from Persia to Baha'u'llah's then current
place of exile, and reveals the    relativ~   infrequency with whi_h those
pilgrims returned to their original homes.

In his later years 'Abdu'l-Baha compiled brief biographical sketches
of disciples who lived during the time of Baha'u'llah and exhibited such
characteristics as to merit a place in Baha'i history.       These biograph-
ical notes were subsequently collated, translated, and published under
the title Memorials of the Faithful.     The stories contained in this
volume naturally dwell on the spiritual characteristics of the individ-
uals, and this forms the substance and theme of the book.       In an
incidental manner, however, the principal movements of each person are
defined, and that information can be used to create a map of the
migratory behavior of these early Baha'is.

Of the 78 biographies contained in Memorials of the Faithful, 69

specifically   outli~e   the major migrations of the person being described;
the other nine only partly summarize the person's movements.      Figure 6
attempts to compile some     of this information.   The patterns which
appear in the map indicate that a number of generalizations can be made
about this group of believers.      First, they were extremely migratory.
None became Baha'is, passed their lives, and died in a single locality.
Second, almost all became Baha'is in Persia or Iraq; only a few declared
their belief while residing in Baha'u'llah's other places of exile.
Third, those who originated in Persia were drawn from many parts of the
country.     Fourth, most died outside their native land, occasionally in a
totally foreign environment, but usually in or near one of Baha'u'llah's
places of exile, especially 'Akka.      Fifth, many simply left their homes
to visit Baha'u'llah but some travelled extensively before or after their
pilgrimage.

Most of these generalizations speak for themselves, but it is
appropriate to draw attention to the implications of one:      the impor-
tance of Persia and Iraq--and the insignificance of Constantinople,
Adrianople, and 'Akka--as source areas.      It is this pattern which rein-
forces the proposition that Persia supplied the manpower for Baha'i
diffusion.

The question arises as to whether these data reliably depict the
general movement patterns of Baha'is during that time.      The sample is
clearly biased in that it identifies confirmed, dedicated Baha'is and
ignores those, probably far more numerous, who were not as strongly
attached to the Faith.      As for diffusion, however, it may be the ardent

believers who most successfully disseminate the word.        It could be argued
that the selection of believers is biased in that it overlooks those
confirmed Baha'is who never journeyed to see Baha'u'llah and thus remained
anonymous to 'Abdu'l-Baha.    This is a   possibil~ty,   but the various his-
tories of the Faith often intimate that any true follower who lived at
the same time as the   Prophet had a deep desire to attain His presence.
That being so, this potential bias would also tend to identify the more
effective diffusion agents.    One can conclude, therefore, that biases in
the sample may not only be innocuous but may actually operate to
identify more effectively the migratory behavior of those Baha'is most
likely to actively participate in the dissemination process.

Although we are attempting here to generalize about early believers
and their places of origin and destination, it is appropriate to extract
from Memorials of the Faithful one particular biography that illustrates
the communication problem inherent in Baha'u'llah's distant exile, and
highlights its tenuous solution.     From the advent of Baha'u'llah's
ministry in 1853 until His passing in 1892, regular communication with
the major cities of Persia was maintained through the efforts of one
individual--Shaykh Salman.    Each year he would travel on foot to
Baha'u'llah's place of exile and then retrace his steps carrying messages
from the Prophet to His followers.     He continued this annual courier
service even after Baha'u'llah's death. 59

59'Abdu'1-Baha, Memorials of the Faithful, pp. 13-16. Adib
Taherzadeh also sketches the life of Shaykh Salman, reaffirming his
importance as a communication link. Adib Taherzadeh, The Revelation of
Baha'u'llah, pp. 109-114.

The Global Proclamation
Until His death, Baha'u'llah's religion was confined to the Islamic
world.     There was a low level of external interest stimulated by the
direct contact of certain western observers, especially the French foreign
minister Joseph Arthur Gobineau and the English historian Edward Granville
Browne.     Furthermore, the extreme persecution experienced by the Babis in
their native land was so shocking that some Western newspapers carried
stories about the movement and its misfortunes.      The actual presence of
Baha'is on a permanent basis, hcwever , did not occur outside the Islamic
world until after 1892.

Baha'u'llah perceived the cultural insulation that encased His
religion as neither natural nor insurmountable.      His view was always a
global one.     In fact, the unity of all peoples is the fundamental objec-
tive of His religion:

."In every dispensation . . . the light of Divine
> Guidance has been focussed upon one central theme . • . In
> this wondrous Revelation, this glorious century, the founda-
> tion of the Faith of God, and the distinguishing feature of
> His Law, is the consciousness of the oneness of mankind. "60

If this is the avowed purpose of the Baha'i Faith, then one might
legitimately ask why Baha'u'llah did not Himself attempt to carry His
Faith beyond the bounds of the Islamic tradition.      The answer is that He
did.     The form which His effort took is of singular interest to the
investigator of diffusion.

60 Baha'u'llah as quoted by Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is
Corne (2nd Indian ed.; New Delhi: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1976),
Not long after His open declaration of Prophethood in 1863,
Baha'u'llah wrote a series of letters to prominent monarchs and leading
ecclesiastics of the world, proclaiming His station as a Prophet of God,
exhorting them to accept the new Faith, admonishing them for ignoring
(and in some instances persecuting) His Cause, and advising them as to what
kinds of behavior befit a person who wields great power and authority.
Although some of the letters were directed to kings, rulers, and religious
leaders collectively, most were written to individuals.    The leaders who
were addressed in person include the following:    (1) Napoleon III of
France, (2) Czar Alexander II of Russia, (3) Queen Victoria of the United
Kingdom,   (4) Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, (5) Emperor Francis Joseph of
Hungary, (6) Sultan 'Abdu'l-'Aziz of the Ottoman Empire, (7) Nasiri'd-
Din Shah of Persia, (8) the rulers of America, and (9) Pope pius IX.

These powerful individuals resided in seats of authority that were
confined to Europe, the Near and Middle East, and North America, but the
territories over which they exercised sovereignty included large parts
of the world. 61   The United Kingdom, for example, was the hub of a
political empire that included, along with many lesser territories, India,
Canada, Australia, and South Africa.    France was the controlling force in
Indo-China, Madagascar, and throughout much of North and West Africa.
The Ottoman Empire, extensive in its own right, was very influential in
many other Muslim zones, especially in North Africa.    Pope Pius IX, as
head of the Catholic church, was responsible for the spiritual develop-
ment of an enormous ecumene that included all of South and Central

America as well as south and western Europe (containing Italy, Spain,
and Portugal, the latter two of which could still claim to be colonialists
on a global scale).         Generally speaking, the only significant areas of the
world not subordinate to the worldly authority of the recipients of
Baha'u'llah's letters were East Asia and Central Africa.

These powerful figures who received messages from Baha'u'llah were
in a unique position to diffuse the Baha'i Faith.         Had they chosen to do
so, they could have exercised enormous influence over the minds of their
subjects.   Rogers and Shoemaker have summarized the research findings
regarding the roles of opinion leaders and authoritative decision makers
in diffusion research. 62       They state categorically that opinion leaders
exist,63 and they are so positive about the capability of authoritative
decision makers to enforce innovation adoption that they simply take for
granted that, once the authoritative decision maker has adopted the
innovation, diffusion throughout the social network over which he holds
sway is assured. 64     Technically defined, kings and clergymen are neither
opinion leaders nor authoritative decision makers since in spite of
their worldly power and prestige, they do not automatically have the
ability to influence how people think.         Nevertheless, it is clear that
the temporal and spiritual leaders in the nineteenth century world,

representing as they usually did the actual presence of divine will
on earth, were capable of molding public attitudes.    They were, there-
fore, in a position to generate rapid global diffusion of the Baha'i
Faith.   That would only have occurred had those worldly sovereigns
accepted Baha'u'llah's summons, which, of course, they did not.     Never-
theless, Baha'u'llah well understooa that these men were the key to
rapid global dissimination. 65

One should not get the impression that Baha'u'llah entertained high
hopes of effecting global dissemination by appealing to world leaders and
that the disregard shown to Him and His letters was a shock to Him and a
source of embitterment.   Actually, Baha'u'llah knew that this sort of
diffusion strategy probably would 8bort in the earliest stage.     He
expressed this awareness in the following way:

"From time immemorial • . . they who have been outwardly
> invested with authority have debarred men from setting their
> faces towards God. They have disliked that men should gather
> together around the Most Great Ocean, inasmuch as they have
> regarded, and still regard, such a gathering as the cause of,
and the motive for, the disruption of their sovereignty .

. "66

Far from expecting a positive response to His letters, Baha'u'llah
actually anticipated rejection of, and even resistance to, His Cause.
Since this is the case, one might wonder why Baha'u'llah wrote the
letters appealing to the kings and ecclesiastics.     It must be remembered

65 s hoghi Effendi has cited Baha'u'llah as saying that if the Muslim
and Christian religious leaders had accepted Him it would have pre-
cipitated mass conversions from these two religions. Shoghi Effendi,
The Promised Day Is Come, p. Ill.

66Bah a'u'llah quoted by Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day Is Come,
that Baha'u'llah was not responsible for adoption of the inovation.      His
responsibility was to make the world aware of the arrival of the new
religion; adoption was the responsibility of those who heard Him.      From
Baha'u'llah's perspective, therefore, lack of rapid and widespread
diffusion outside the Islamic realm was not a reflection of failure on
His part but was rather an indication of the failure on the part of
those who heard Him speak--the leaders of the world. 67   It was the
heedlessness of those nineteenth century rulers that inhibited more
widespread Baha'i diffusion, and it was their failure to turn to Him
that compelled Him to forecast that " . . . 'From two ranks amongst men
power hath been seized:   kings and ecclesiastics'.

The social scientist looks upon Baha'u'llah's messages to the world
leaders as an abortive attempt at innovation diffusion, and so to him
the most interesting questions revolve around the issues of why the
innovation should   have been rejected, what characteristics it must
change in order to find acceptance, and how diffusion agents (in this
case, particularly Baha'u'llah) might alter their approaches and tech-
niques so as to achieve greater success.   To the Baha'i, however, the
rejection of the innovation is symptomatic of the waywardness of rnan-
kind and is not, therefore, a sign that the product needs modification or
that the marketing strategy needs improvement.

67Be sides, He claimed that with time the Fdith would ultimately
prevail anyway. Ibid., p. 121.
68Ba ha'u'llah as quoted by Shoghi Effendi, Ibid., p. 19.

Nevertheless, Baha'is recognize the evolutionary character of their
religion 69 and are fully committed to working within society.70    The
exigencies of the secular world require adaptation and response, and so
with the passage of time the Faith did in fact pursue a different
strategy for global dissemination.   Baha'u'llah's messages to the world
leaders did not result in widespread diffusion, and so the Baha'i com-
munity was obliged to search for a different method of spreading the
Faith.

DIFFUSION IN THE TIME OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA:    1892-1921

The Diffusion Strategy of 'Abdu'l-Baha
The cultural confinement of the Baha'i Faith dissolved rapidly
following the passing of Baha'u'llah.   The pattern of diffusion which
began to develop outside the Islamic world was distinctive in that it
relied enormously on transmittal of the Faith first to North America and
from there to Europe and a scattering of other countries around the
world.   This pattern did not materialize by chance.   Almost as soon as
he took control of the Faith, 'Abdu'l-Baha, through his words and
actions, emphasized the role that North America was destined to play in
the future of Baha'i growth.   The brief outline of Baha'i history con-
tained in Chapter II has already described the way in which 'Abdu'l-Baha

Analysis of Critical Transformations in the Evolution of the Baha'i
World Faith," pp. 31-32.

70"      That one is indeed a man who, today, dedicateth himself
to the service of the entire human race . • . . " Baha'u'llah, Gleanings,
viewed North America as a springboard for global diffusion.     In Chapter
VI there will be occasion to discuss a series of messages which he sent
to the North American believers in 1919 urging them to disseminate the
Faith worldwide.     In order to avoid being repetitive, the points made
in those presentations will not be covered here.     However, even super-
ficial reference to those sections will confirm that from the beginning
America was targeted by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and that later diffusion through
that distribution point was intentional rather than accidental.

Diffusion Under 'Abdu'l-Baha

Figure 7 shows the countries that were opened by the Baha'i Faith
during the period 1892-1921.    The map actually breaks the time period
into three stages:    1892-1904, 1905-1917, and 1918-1921.   The rationale
underlying the selection of these time frames is partly empirical and
partly theoretical.    During the earliest period, 1892-1904, international
expansion of the Faith occurred rapidly in the West, resulting in the
opening of the United states, a number of Western European countries,
and Canada.   After 1904, however, the quantity of international diffusion
dropped off sharply, and because of that sudden change 1904-1905 is
taken as the break point between time periods.     The ensuing discussion
will identify the reason for the marked drop in the rate of diffusion.

The other time break occurs between 1917 and 1918.      'Abdu'l-Baha
was continually callins for overseas expansion of the Faith, but 1918
marks the appearance of the first few of his messages to American
Baha'is specifically assigning them the responsibility for worldwide
dissemination (the remainder of those messages reached America in 1919).

Those messages were instrumental in stimulating international Baha'i
growth; eventually they came to be regarded as the blueprint for con-
struction of the international Baha'i community.     Diffusion which occurred
after the first of those messages appeared was a result of their direc-
tives.    For that reason, expansion during the last three years of
'Abdu'l-Baha's life is separately indicated on the map.

It is somehow fitting that diffusion of the Faith to the United
States--perhaps the most important development in the more recent history
of Baha'i expansion--should have occurred from a country that had a small,
albeit flourishing, Baha'i population.     Egypt was on the periphery of
the Baha'i world:     it was neither a significant source of Baha'i manpower
nor the seat of Baha'i authority.     Its only claim to Baha'i fame was
that Baha'u'llah had stopped over at Alexandria and Port Said during His
journey from Adrianople to 'Akka, not an event of sufficient import to
elevate the status of Egypt as a potential center for later geographic
expansion.

Egypt happened to be the source for diffusion to America because of
Ibrahim Khayr'u'llah, a Syrian doctor who was converted to the Baha'i
Faith in Cairo.     'Abdu'l-Baha apparently asked Dr, Khayr'u'llah to move
to the United States to proclaim the religion.     Khayr'u'llah did as he
was requested and managed to convert hundreds in the United States.
This nucleus     was to be the origin of most of the diffusion that was to
occur during the lifetime of 'Abdu'l-Baha.

Baha'i presence in America was, therefore, the result of planned
effort.    The   international growth which occurred between 1894, when
Khayr'u'llah moved to Chicago, and 1904 was, as can be seen from Figure
7, largely the result of American activity.     In particular, a number of

European countries carne to have resident Baha'is, and this development
invariably involved either direct or indirect transmittal of the Faith
from the United States.   In most cases the transmittal was direct.

The explanation of this curious "backtracking" of the Faith lies
in the movements and activities of the prominent early American Baha'is,
a few of whom were wealthy.   One in particular, Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, the
wife of Senator George F. Heart, determined to visit 'Abdu'l-Baha at
'Akka and invited a small number of Baha'i friends to accompany her on a
pilgrimage to Palestine in 1898.    She and her contingent stopped over in
Paris en route and during their stay one of the Baha'is converted an
American woman living in Paris.    This woman, May Ellis Bolles, joined
the party of pilgrims and was one of those early Western believers to
meet 'Abdu'l-Baha.   Before the band of fifteen visitors departed from
'Akka, May Bolles was asked by 'Abdu'l-Baha to remain in Paris long
enough to establish a Baha'i community there.    She did   as she was
asked, securing a permanent Baha'i presence in that city.     From her
location in Paris she brought the first Englishman into the Faith and
converted Edith McKay71 who soon after moved to Switzerland and introduced
the religion to that country.72

Meanwhile, Baha'i presence in Great Britain was affected through the
conversion of Miriam Thornburgh-Cropper, a niece of Phoebe Hearst.       Mrs.

71The Baha'i World: 1954-1963, XIII (Haifa:     The Universal House
of Justice, 1971), pp. 878-881.

72Details of the Hearst pilgrimage and the diffusion that it
engendered can be found in a number of sources, three of which are: H. M.
Balyuzi, 'Abdu'l'Baha (London: George Ronald, 1971), pp. 67-74; Shoghi
Effendi, God Passes By, pp. 257-260; O. Z. Whitehead, Some Early Baha'is
of the West (Oxford: George Ronald, 1976), pp. 13-19, 55.

Cropper, who was living in London, learned about the religion in a
letter from her aunt.   She became a Baha'i and joined her aunt's
itinerant group in Paris.   When she returned from 'Akka she established
the Faith in the London area.

We can see that the earliest presence of the Faith in Europe
(excluding that sliver of territory held by the Ottoman Empire to which
Baha'u'llah was banished for five years) was the result of a spontaneous
decision on the part of a wealthy American Baha'i to journey to 'Abdu'l-
Baha's place of confinement in 'Akka.   The fact that Europe straddled
the most frequently used transportation routes from America to Palestine
was significant as well, for Phoebe Hearst had started a trend.     In the
years to come, more and more Baha'is were able to make trips to 'Akka,
leaving behind in Europe a scattering of newly declared believers.

One of the many anomalous events in the diffusionary history of the
Faith involves the manner in which it came to be established in Hawaii.
Agnes Baldwin Alexander, representing the union of two very prominent
Honolulu families, travelled to Europe in 1900.   While in Rome she
heard about the Faith from another American traveller (Mrs. Charlotte
Dixon) and by the time she arrived back in Honolulu she was a confirmed
Baha'i.   She dedicated the rest of her life to the Faith, establishing
the religion on Oahu and Maui.    In 1913 'Abdu'l-Baha requested that she
pioneer in Japan.   A year and a half later, Agnes Alexander arrived
there and helped to form the first Baha'i community (she received 'Abdu'l-
Baha's request while visiting New York and travelled to Japan by way of
Europe and the Indian Ocean).73

Life in the Hawaiian Islands (revised ed.; Honolulu: The Hawaii Times

After spending three years in Paris, May Bolles was granted per-
mission by 'Abdu'l-Baha to marry her Canadian fiance, William Sutherland
Maxwell, and depart for Canada.       From her new home in Montreal May
Bolles Maxwell was instrumental in creating the first Canadian community.
That was in 1903. 7 4     Canada, therefore, received its first Baha'i im-
pulse from a United States citizen, but not from the United States.          The
situation was similar to that of Miriam Thornburgh-Cropper in the United
Kingdom.

Also in 1903, 'Abdu'l-Baha asked Alma Knoblock to leave her horne
in Washington, D.C. and pioneer in Gerrnany.75      Miss Knoblock was respon-
sible for developing Baha'i communities in a number of German cities; a
short time later she introduced the religion to Austria.

The much later diffusion of the religion to South Africa, Australia,
and Brazil was the work of American Baha'is who responded to the messages
that 'Abdu'l-Baha addressed to the North American believers during the
period 1916-1919.       Leonora Holsapple moved from California to Bahia,
Brazil; Fanny Knoblock, sister of Alma, migrated to South Africa;76 the
Dunns, an elderly couple from California, departed for Sydney, Australia.

Only a part of the diffusion portrayed in Figure 7 has been dis-
cussed, but a lack of available information prohibits a more thorough
treatment.    A substantial   n~ber   of all the diffusion flows have been
identified, however, and      the circumstances surrounding the occurrence
of most have been described.      There appears to be sufficient information
to make a number of generalizations about the spread of the religion during
the period 1892-1921.

First, it is clear that most of the geographical expansion occurred
outside the Islamic world, most particularly in North America and Europe.
Cultural containment of the religion had at least been overcome.          The
numerical strength of these Western communities was, with the exception
of the United States, totally     uni~pressive.   By 1921 the number of
believers in one of these newly opened countries was as likely to be in
the tens as in the    hundreds; the united States was exceptional in having
nearly two thousand followers.      Therefore, using a head count as the only
indicator, one would be forced to conclude that the religion was still a
Persian phenomenon.     In fact, however, the tiny traces of Baha'i presence
in a large number of foreign environments, most of which permitted free-
dom of activity, and many of which afforded a level of material well-
being    that was almost entirely lacking in the religion's demographic
core, insured that future growth of the Faith would be truly inter-
national in character.

The second generalization that can be made is that international
Baha'i expansion was coordinated and directed by 'Abdu'l-Baha who through-
out his ministry requested specific Baha'is to move to certain areas in
order to spread the Faith.      The work of Khayr'u'llah, Bolles Maxwell,

Alexander, Knoblock, and others was carried out at the behest of 'Abdu'l-
Baha.     The direction and   pattern of international diffusion was, there-
fore largely a reflection of what 'Abdu'l-Baha thought it should be.         The
reality of international diffusion closely matched his preconceived
mental image, and this was so because the more effective diffusion agents
were willing to obey his dictates.      In later years, the personal approach
was supplemented by a general policy statement to the American believers
calling for global dissemination from their continent.      Leonora Holsapple,
Fanny Knoblock, and the Dunns responded to that policy.      They too, there-
fore, through their obedience, helped to cause the diffusion flows that
'Abdu'l-Baha had envisioned.

A third generalization, arising out of the second, is that North
America did in fact play the critical role in global expansion that
'Abdu'l-Baha had anticipated.      Figure 7 confirms that it was from North
America that the bulk of the diffusion occurred.      So powerful was this
trend that dissemination of the Faith in Europe consisted mostly of one-
way transatlantic flows rather thRn short distance transmittals from
one country to its neigh00r.      Even in those instances when intra-
European dissemination occurred--such as from Germany to Austria and
from France to Switzerland--it was likely to involve either an American
change agent (Alma Knoblock in Austria) or someone who had received word
of the religion from an American (Edith McKay in Switzerland).      Even
Agnes Alexander, who became a Baha'i while vacationing in Italy at a
time when that country had no resident Baha'is, was brought into the
Faith by an American.

A fourth generalization is that international diffusion was largely
the work of a few dedicated Baha'is, not the product of community-wide

effort.     Consider, for example, t.hat May Bolles Maxwell was instrumental
in establishing the Faith not only in France but in Switzerland and
Canada (in fact, when she died in 1940 she was helping to develop Baha'i
communities in Argentina).     And she was not the only one to open up more
than one country for the Faith:     Alma Knoblock opened Austria as well as
Germany; Agnes Alexander was the founding figure in both Hawaii and
Japan; the Dunns penetrated New Zealand after having first opened
Australia.     These are some of the more notable examples of the way in
which dispersal of the Faith often depended en the efforts of a few.
Whether it was pioneering to new areas or travel teaching around the
world, one finds the same names cropping up again and again in accounts
of the Baha'i Faith during the first two decades of the twentieth cen-
tury.

And what of the characteristics of this hard core of early Baha'i
teachers in the West?     Of those that pioneered, a surprisingly large
proportion were women.     Any conjecture as to why this should have been
so would not be likely to yield hypotheses that could be verified.        It
should be noted, h0wever, that this sex bias probably does not reflect
fu~y   inherent characteristic of the religion that is in some way ad-
vantageous to females.     If that were the case then one would expect a
similar female dominance to be the rule in all cultural settings.        Persia
contradicts such a theory since all historical sources identify pre-
dominantly men as the moving force behind the religion in that country.77

770 f the 78 prominent Baha'is eulogized by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Memorials
of the Faithful only three are women. In a totally different cultural
context, only about 30 percent of all Korean Baha'is are women. The
Baha'i World: 1968-1973, XV (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1975), p. 260.

It is more likely, therefore, that the interaction of the religion with a
particular cultural milieu creates a unique situation which in some way
favors deeper involvement by one of the sexes.     In the case of modern
Western society it may be that the traditional lack of any role aside
from homekeeper has given women the time and incentive to become involved
with movements and organizations that do not necessarily proffer any
economic return.    Men, on the other hand, have been cast as the providers,
and that role has tended to preoccupy their minds and consume non-
familial time.     This sort of role differentiation may explain why female
Baha'is have always been more numerous than males in the United States;
indeed, it may explain the preponderance of females that characterizes
most religious movements.

Another common characteristic of those early Baha'i pioneers was
that they were often single.     There were certainly many married Baha'is
who worked in those early years to spread the Faith, but considering the
high proportion of the total adult population that is married, it is
surprising that more of those active Baha'is were not in a similar state.
Perhaps the higher mobility of single people accounts for their impor-
tance in the early spread of the Baha'i Faith.

The Travels of 'Abdu'l-Baha
That relatively brief period of political freedom which 'Abdu'l-
Baha enjoyed between 1908 and 1914 made it possible for him to journey
overseas to further the cause of his religion.     Between 1911 and 1913 he
made two extended trips, the first to England and France and the second
to both North America and Europe.     He was in his late sixties at the time.
This brief interlude was the only occasion during the 77 years of guidance

supplied by the three central figures of the Faith that anyone of them
was free to travel on behalf of their religion.

'Abdu'l-Baha spent a total of about 16 months in Western countries;
eight months in the United States, five months in France, two months in
England, and about two weeks each in Germany and Austro-Hungry.     In
Europe, most of the time was passed in Paris and London, although while in
the United Kingdom he made brief sorties to Edinburgh, Oxford, and
Bristol, and during his travels on the Continent he had occasion to remain
for a few days in Stuttgart, Budapest, and Vienna.     His sojourn in the
United States was somewhat more itinerant.   He visited a larger number
of cities, distributing his time more evenly among them.     Even so, the
bulk of his stay was spent in the New York metropolitan region and, to
a lesser extent, the San Francisco-Oakland area.

'Abdu'l-Baha was motivated to make these trips by his desire to
encourage the growth of the Faith in the West.     During his travels, this
objective was pursued in two ways.   First, he inspired his followers by
being with them.   His physical presence and the words of encouragement
which he imparted were sufficient to deepen their commitment.     There will
be occasion at a later point in this study to discuss the rebellion of
Dr. Khayr'u'llah against 'Abdu'l-Baha's authority, but for now it should
be pointed out that after having founded the American Baha'i community,
Khayr'u'llah changed his mind about the issue of leadership in the Faith
and actively worked to undermine the new American believers' allegiance
to 'Abdu'l-Baha.   That disruption had occurred just after the turn of
the century but in the following few years the challenge was blunted and
most American believers remained loyal to Baha'u'llah's will and

testament.   Nevertheless, 'Abdu'l-Baha's direct interaction with Western
believers--especially in America--served to strengthen their recognition
of him as leader of the religion.    His visits to the West, therefore,
helped to protect the infant Faith from internal disruption.

The second way in which 'Abdu'l-Baha promoted the interests of his
religion was by making numerous public appearances and talking to a wide
variety 0f audiences.    He invariably spoke on Baha'i themes and from all
reports stimulated widespread interest.    By doing this, he was not simply
promoting the Faith in a direct fashion; he was setting an example for
all Baha'is to follow.

It is difficult to grasp the scope and intensity of 'Abdu'l-Baha's
activities during his travels.   Perhaps the best that can be done is to
cite Shoghi Effendi's example of how active he was in the New York area
where he stayed for about two and a half months.    In that city alone,

• • . He delivered public addresses in, and made formal

The particulars of 'Abdu'l-Baha's trips are readily available,
both for North America and Europe.    Where he went and how long he stayed
in each location are interesting, but would be more significant if they
could be compared with the distribution of Western Baha'is at that time.

78 Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 289.

Data regarding sizes and locations of Baha'i concentrations are much
harder to find than information dealing with 'Abdu'l-Baha's movements.
Even so, it is possible to reconstruct a reasonably accurate picture of
the geographical arrangement     of North American Baha'is in 1912.

Figure 8 is an attempt to combine these two types of information.

In spite of inaccuracies which must be present in the data, the overall
pattern is clear:   'Abdu'l-Baha spent most of his time in those places
where there were already well-established Baha'i communities.     One might
arrive at this same conclusion by consulting accounts of 'Abdu'l-Baha's
trip to ~~rica79 since they reveal the inevitable presence of Baha'is
wherever he went.   That information, however, does not preclude the
possibility that there were large Baha'i communities in areas that
'Abdu'l-Baha did not visit.    Figure 8 shows that on the whole such was
not the case.   He visited nearly all locations    where there were signif-
icant numbers of Baha'is and he almost invariably bypassed locations
where there were no believers.

There are two notable exceptions to this generalization.     In the
first place, there was a substantial Baha'i contingent in the Pacific
Northwest (Seattle, Portland, and Spokane) that was never visited by
'Abdu'l-Baha.   Apparently, he felt he did not have sufficient time.
Besides, he had hurried to the west coast in the hope of meeting
Thornton Chase, the first person in America to become a Baha'i (1894).
Mr. Chase was seriously ill in Los Angeles, and died before 'Abdu'l-Baha

reached him.   'Abdu'l-Baha made the trip from San Francisco to Los
Angeles anyway in order to visit his grave, and that southern excursion
probably precluded any possibility of a journey to the northwest.

The second exception is that 'Abdu'l-Baha spent almost a month in
the small towns of Dublin, New Hampshire, and Eliot, Maine, neither of
which had an established Baha'i community.   The former, however, was a
well-known summer resort frequented by a number of Baha'is from the large
cities on the northeast seaboard while the latter was   the location of
Green Acre Institute, a famous liberal conference center that happened
to be owned by a Baha'i named Sarah Farmer. SO During the time that
'Abdu'l-Baha was staying at those two locations a number of Baha'is
took up temporary residence nearby, and in both places, despite their
small size, he made public addresses.

with these two exceptions, it is valid to say that 'Abdu'l-Baha
visited only and all those places where substantial numbers of Baha'is
resided.   The major implication of this concurrence is that it would
tend to reinforce Baha'i growth in those areas where the Faith was
already concentrated--at least that is what one would presume.   Is it
not to be expected that the public interest generated by 'Abdu'l-Baha's
visit to a particular locality would heighten the level of awareness of the
innovation and create a large pool of potential converts?   Would not the
additional benefit of a ready supply of change agents increase the
chances of turning potential converts into real ones?   One would think
so.   This line of reasoning would lead one to expect that those geographic

zones already penetrated by 1912 would, with the passage of time, become
even more entrenched and enjoy the sort of demographic impolsion that
often associates with early development.     That is not to say that the
Faith would not diffuse to the remainder of the continent; it simply
suggests that numerical multiplication would proceed at an equal or more
rapid rate in those original core areas visited by 'Abdu'l-Baha--a pro-
cess which would perpetuate their early dominance.

But that is not     the way the Faith grew in North America.   The
early concentration of Baha'is in a number of urban centers in the
industrial northeast, in the midwest, and on the west coast was gradually
replaced by a more even distribution over the whole continental area.
Concentrations continued to exist, but they became, if anything, less
pronounced, and in some instances shifted to regions that in 1912 had had
no Baha'is whatsoever.

There is one main reason why the reality of diffusion failed to
conform to the expected pattern.     Throughout the twentieth century the
Baha'i Faith has vigorously pursued a policy of geographic dispersion.
That policy has been strong, clear, and consistent.     Implementation of the
policy has stimulated an extraordinary amount of migratory behavior among
Baha'is, usually from areas where they are highly concentrated to regions
of relative scarcity.    Therefore, whatever growth was generated by
'Abdu'l-Baha's visit to the old core areas of the Faith in North America
rapidly was siphoned off for distribution throughout the periphery.
Data will be presented in a later chapter to document this process.

CHAPTER IV
ISOh~TION,   PERSECUTION, AND FAITH:   THEIR EFFECT ON DIFFUSION

RELIGIO-CULTURAL ISOLATION

Early expansion of the Baha'i Faith was greatly inhibited by the
nature of its religious and cultural roots.        Issuing as it did from an
Islamic context, the Faith was initially perceived as a sect of this
great, world religion--an attitude adopted both by political and reli-
gious leaders within the Islamic realm and by foreign observers from
abroad who happened to be in the region at the time.        In order to burst
its cultural bonds, the new religion had first to develop and employ
intercultural channels of communication strong enough to overcome the
cultural biases inherent in the perception of any foreign observer,
refined enough to permit uncorrupted transmittal of the Baha'i message,
and reliable enough to ensure that foreign adopters would not fall away
from the Faith through lack of contact with its leadership and inspira-
tion.     Social customs and physical appearances alone were an imposing
barrier to acceptance of the Faith by a foreigner.       vllien one contemplates
the racial views in the United States and the attitude of cultural
supremacy in Great Britain during the middle of the nineteenth century,
for example, it immediately becomes apparent that socio-ethnic dis-
similarities between diffusion agents and potential adopters probably
were sufficient to obstruct the diffusion of the Faith from its Islamic
cultural hearth to the Christianized Western world.        But even more
awesome was the magnitude and effectiveness of the language barrier.

Until the messages of the Bab and Baha'u'llah could be presented directly
to a foreigner in either an oral or written form there was little likeli-
hood that the Faith would be able to make much headway outside its source
region.

The problem of religo-cultural insulation in the early years of the
Faith was even more acute than one might suppose.       A schism developed in
the first centuries of the Muslim dispensation which resulted in a
division between Sunni and Shi'ah adherence.       Although originally political
in origin, the rift eventually took on some theological overtones that
were to have an impact on the fortunes of the Baha'i Faith.        The Sunni
sect, which is by far the larger, looks upon Mohammed's statement that
He is the Seal of the Prophets as evidence that His was to be the last
of God's prophetic revelations.       The Shi'ah, on the other hand, believe
that divinity will return to earth in the form of the twelfth Imam,
who as a savior will reestablish justice in the world.        Because of their
messianic hope, the Shi'ah have been much more receptive to the Babi
and Baha'i revelations than the Sunni, particularly since the Bab was of
Shirah origin and His advent was immediately preceded by the ascendency
of a mystic who, among other things, proclaimed the eminent appearance

of the twelfth Imam.        This, however, placed the Baha'i Faith in an
awkward geographic position.       As Figure 9 shows, Iran is a Shi'ah enclave
in the Sunni world.        Thus it is that in spite of high adoption rates
within Persia during the        first few years of the Faith's existence, ac-
ceptance in Sunni-dominated areas has traditionally been slow and
irregular.

PERSECUTION

As difficult as it is to draw firm conclusions regarding the impact
of cultural and religious contexts on the spread of the Baha'i Faith,
even more elusive is the role of persecution as a stimulant or inhibitor
of the diffusion process.        That persecution did occur is a documented

fact;        the question is, What sort of impact did it have?   The intent of
the persecution was to exterminate a movement that was threatening the
religious and       political authorities of Persia by converting large
numbers of people--many of them influential--to belief in a new social
order.       Wholesale slaughter of the early Bahis decimated the leadership,
disarranged the followers, and drastically curtailed the activities of
the struggling movement.

Now in those days [circa 1852], by reason of grievous
> sufferings and unremitting persecution, this community
> (the Bahis) was dissolved in the lands of Persia, and
> their assembly was scattered, and most of them were slain
> with all manner of torments and the harshest punishments;
> their possessions were plundered, their wives and children
> were led into captivity, and if one of them survived, he hid
> himself in some corner, or chose for himself exile from his
> country. 3

In terms of tangible resources, then, persecution diminished the Faith as
a religious force.        Such a conclusion, however, probably only holds for
the short term.        In the long run, Persian suppression of the Faith

became less intense and Baha'i communities reestablished themselves and
exceeded their original strength.     Furthermore, the history of perse-
cut ion now works to the advantage of the Faith by attracting the sym-
pathies of many people who, although extracted from a broad variety of
cultural settings, display the universal human abhorrence of injustice.

Even at the time, however, persecution had an opposite effect to
that which was intended.     It enhanced Babi resolve, publicized the
movement, and made heroic martyrs of the founding figure and the thousands
of followers who died for Him.    A climax of this process was reached in
1852\.    When a Babi youth, probably with the assistance of two accom-
plices, attempted to assassinate the Shah--an act which, if properly
manipulated by the government, could have done more than anything else
to undermine the appeal of the Faith--the immediate response of the
authorities was to hold all Babis responsible for the deed and to carry
out an extermination campaign against them.     But the human drama which
ensured was so powerful that it was bound to leave an indelible impres-
sion on some of the many onlookers.     Imagine, if you will, that you are
an observer on that day in 1852 when the would-be assassin, Sadiq-i-
Tabrizi, paid the price for his crime and drew the Babi movement into a
vortex of retribution.

The first to suffer on that calamitous day was the ill-
> fated Sadiq, who was instantly slain on the scene of his
> attempted crime. His body was tied to the tail of a mule
> and dragged all the way to Tihran, where it was hewn into
> halves, each of which was suspended and exposed to the pub-
> lic view, while the Tihranis were invited by the city
> authorities to mount the ramparts and gaze upon the muti-
> lated corpse. Molten lead was poured down the throat of
> his accomplice, after having subjected him to the torture
> of red-hot pincers and limb-rending screws. A comrade of
> his, Haji Qasim, was stripped of his clothes, lighted candles
were thrust into holes made in his flesh, and was paraded

> before the multitude who shouted and cursed him. Others had
> their eyes gouged out, were sawn asunder, strangled, blown
> from the mouths of cannons, chopped in pieces, hewn apart
> with hatchets and maces, shod with horseshoes, bayoneted and
> stoned. Torture-mongers vied with each other in running the
> gamut of brutality, while the populace, into whose hands the
> bodies of the hapless victims were delivered, would close in
> upon their prey, and would so mutilate them as to leave no
> trace of their original form. The executioners, though ac-
> customed to their own gruesome task, would themselves be
> amazed at the fiendish cruelty of the populace. Women and
> children could be seen led down the streets by thej- execu-
> tioners, their flesh in ribbons, with candles burning in
> their wounds, singing with ringing voices before the silent
> spectators: "Verily from God we come, and unto Him we return!"
> As some of the children expired on the way their tormentors
> would fling their bodies under the feet of their fathers and
> sisters who, proudly treading upon them, would not deign to
> give them a second glance. A father, according to the testi-
> mony of a distinguished French writer, rather than abjure his
> faith, preferred to have the throats of his two young sons,
> both already covered with blood, slit upon his breast, as he
> lay on the ground, whilst the elder of the two, a lad of four-
> teen, vigorously pressing his right of seniority, demanded to
> be the first to lay down his life. 4

A spectacle of this sort raises the issue of innovation adoption above
the level of mere rational decision making.   The intellectual pros and
cons of adoption get relegated to the background as the individual obser-
ver experiences an overwhelming potency of emotions.   E. G.   Bro~me

argues persuasively that benefits flowed to the Babis as a consequence of
their reactions to adversity.

These executions were not merely criminal, but foolish. The

Browne's observations regarding the vitalizing power that accrued to the
Faith as a consequence of the extreme persecution that occurred cannot
be proven.   However, his views do seem convincing in light of Lord
Curzon's summary of the status of the Baha'is in Persia some 40 years
later:

. . . The lowest estimate places the present number of
> Babis in Persia at half a million. I am disposed to think
> from conversations with persons well qualified to judge,
> that the total is nearer one million. They are to be found
> in every walk of life, from the ministers and nobles of the
> Court to the scavenger of the groom, not the least arena of
> their activity being the Mussulman priesthood itself. 6

Whatever the effect that persecution and oppression have had on
the Faith, there is little doubt about how Baha'is view this issue.
Baha'u'llah crystallized the Baha'i point of view in the following words:

Behold how in this dispensation the worthless and foolish
> have fondly imagined that by such instruments as massacre,
> plunder and banishment they can extinguish the Lamp which
> the Hand of Divine Power hath lit, or eclipse the Day Star

> 6curzon, Persia and the Persian Question, I, p. 499.
7Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, p. 72.

Statements such as this have inculcated the Baha'i mentality with an
outlook that not only tolerates and accepts adversity but even at times
looks forward to it as a sign of impending Baha'i growth.

The particular case of banishment, one of the forms of adversity
mentioned by Baha'u'llah in the above quotation is especially sig-
nificant when studying the geographic aspects of Baha'i diffusion.
Baha'u'llah's repeated exiles were instrumental in (1) establishing the
Faith outside Persia, (2) determining the location of many of the early
non-Persian centers of Baha'i activity, and (3) providing new sources
from which later expansion would emanate.   Wherever Baha'u'llah went a
small group of believers sprang up around his place of confinement, and
in the two instances when he was forced to relocate, a part of that
community remained in place, acting as nuclei for eventual expansion. 8
Furthermore, it can be documented that Constantinople eventually became
the source for widespread diffusion.   Egypt and the Caucasus were opened
to the Faith from there, as was syria. 9

One must not be left with the impression that Baha'u'llah had no
control over His own movements.   In 1853 the Shah banished Him from
Persia, but permitted Him the choice of destination.   The Russian

8Th is statement is certainly correct for Baha'u'llah's removal
from Baghdad; in the case of his displacement from Constantinople the
evidence is not conclusive: Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, pp. 155-156,
180-181. The importance of Baghdad, Constantinople, and 'Akka as foci
for immigration, residence, and subsequent out-migration of key Baha'is
can be appreciated by reading 'Abdu'l-Baha, Memorials of the Faithful.
9Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 176.

Government offered Baha'u'llah asylum, but He declined, electing instead

to settle in Baghdad.        During His residence in that city, Colonel Sir
Arnold Burrows Kemball, British Consul General in Baghdad, offered to
arrange British citizenship, but this invitation also was declined. l l
If Baha'u'llah had opted to settle in either Russia or the British Empire
it is hard to imagine the implications for subsequent Baha'i diffusion.

The history of the Baha'i Faith, insofar as it relates to the
diffusion process, can be viewed in terms of challenge and response,
the perspective so ably employed by Arnold Toynbee. 12     Cultural parochial-
ism and persecution represented external challenges to the growth and
expansion of the Faith during its critical early years while the Baha'i
unwillingness to compromise beliefs or abandon expansionist policies was
indicative of the basic Baha'i response.      This response, representing as
it does an internally derived reaction to circumstances, can be understood
best as a translation of beliefs and values into action.

Diffusion is at least in part a consequence of particular responses
to particular circumstances.      Since a response is largely shaped by

I-X by D. C. Somervell (2 vols.; New York: Dell Publishing Co., Inc.,
1974), I, pp. 88-169, II, pp. 97-108. Toynbee addresses the specIfic
issue of religious persecution and its consequences (I, pp. 153-169), but
he primarily concerns himself with challenges to civilizations and their
ensuing responses. At a later point in his work, however, he recognizes
the possibility that it may be religious movements that initiate civil-
izational growth (see esp. II, pp. 97-98).

prevailing beliefs, it follows that   be1ief~   will have some effect on the
character of diffusion.    Two Baha'i beliefs have deeply affected diffusion.

The first has to do with how the Faith perceives its role in the
world.   It has already been demonstrated that Baha'is believe (1) that
the most pressing need in the world today is global unity, and (2) that
the most powerful instrument for filling that need is the Faith itself.
When this perspective is combined with the fundamental Baha'i principle
that every believer has a spiritual obligation to actively strive for
realization of the new world order, the result is a     corr~unity   outlook
that emphasizes the importance of spreading the Faith to new believers
and new territories.   When, in addition, it is remembered that individual
Baha'is have a spiritual obligation to abide by the decisions of a
divinely ordained administrative order in all non-personal matters, it
immediately becomes apparent that support for centrally planned expansion
will be very great.    In the early days this meant that when the Bab,
Baha'u'llah, or 'Abdu'l-Baha asked an individual believer to travel to a
particular locale and teach the Faith, the response almost invariably
would be immediate and positive.    Later on it meant that expansionary
plans developed by the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice were
met with instantaneous approval and universal support.

A second way in which Baha'i beliefs affect diffusion involves the
concept of a unified religion.     Since Baha'is recognize the legitimate
foundations of all the world's great revealed religions and consider
their founding figures to be Prophets of God equal in status with
Baha'u'llah, potential adopters from these other religious traditions do
not have to completely reject their background in order to accept the

Baha'i message.   To be sure, in any particular case there will be beliefs
and values that do not mesh with the Baha'i model, but in the final
analysis acceptance of the Baha'i Faith often can be viewed as a
modification--rather than a     rejection--of the potential adopter's
existing religious tradition.     The way the Baha'i Faith relates to other
religions not only encourages adoption; it strongly discourages reversion.
Just as Muslims have historically been highly resistant to Christian
overtures because they already accept Christ, so too do Baha'i believers
rarely become Muslims, Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Buddhists, or
Hindus since they already accept the divinity of those religions'
founders.

CHAPTER V
THE ADVERSE EFFECT OF LEADERSHIP CRISES ON BAHA'I GROWTH

Baha'i growth has relied heavily on the use and acceptance of
authority.   The individuals and the administrative bodies vested with
authority by the sacred writings of the Faith have used their positions
of responsibility to promote dissemination.    The believers, although
generally submissive to the authoritative will, have on occasion ex-
perienced division over the issue of its legitimacy.   These periods of
internal disorder have usually been brief in duration, but fragmentary
evidence suggests that they tend to correspond to periods of relatively

weak Baha'i growth.

Baha'i authority is perceived as being divine in origin and thus
an integral part of the Faith.   Recosnition of this authority is incum-
bent upon all Baha'is.    The importance of this precept to the life of
the Faith is manifestly evident in a brief statement made by Shoghi
Effendi regarding the religious character of the mechanisms of
authority:   " . . . To disassociate the administrative principles of the
Cause from the purely spiritual and humanitarian teachings would be
tantamount to a mutiliation of the body of the Cause, a separation that
can only result in the disintegration of its component parts, and the

extinction of the Faith itself.,,2   Baha'is, therefore, have a spiritual
obligation not merely to accept the wellsprings of authority but to

3The rationale behind the Baha'i concern with legitimate authority
and the emphasis which Baha'is place on the divinity of their own
authoritative institutions is carefully explored by Shoghi Effendi:

"None, I feel, will question the fact that the fundamental
> reason why the unity of the Church of Christ was irretrievably
> shattered, and its influence was, in the course of time under-
> mined, was that the Edifice which the Fathers of the Church
> reared after the passing of His First Apostle was an Edifice
> that rested in nowise upon the explict directions of Christ Him-
> self. The authority and features of their administration were
> wholly inferred, and indirectly derived, with more or less justifi-
> cation, from certain vague and fragmentary references which they
> found scattered amongst His utterances and recorded in the Gospel.
> Not one of the sacraments of the Church; not one of the rites and
> ceremonies which the Christian Fathers have elaborately devised and
> ostentatiously observed; not one of the elements of the severe dis-
> cipline they rigorously imposed upon the primitive Christians; none
> of these resposed on the direct authority of Christ, or emanated
> from His specific utterances. Not one of these did Christ conceive,
> none did He specifically invest with sufficient authority to either
interpret His Word, or to add to what He had not specifically enjoined.

"For this reason, in later generations, voices were raised in pro-
> test against the self-appointed authority which arrogated to itself
> privileges and powers that did not emanate from the clear text of the
> Gospel of Jesus Christ, and which constituted a grave departure from
the spirit which that Gospel did inculcate. . .

" . . . Unlike the Dispensation of Christ, unlike the Dispensation
> of Muhammed, unlike all the Dispensations of the past, the apostles
> of Baha'u'llah in every land, wherever they labor and toil, have
> before them in clear, in unequivocal and emphatic language, all the
> laws, and regulations, the principles, the institutions, the guidance,
> they require for the prosecution and consummation of their task. Both
> in the administrative provisions of the Baha'i Dispensation, and in
> the matter of succession, as embodied in the twin institutions of the
> House of Justice and of the Guardianship, the followers of Baha'u'llah
> can summon to their aid such irrefutable evidence of Divine Guidance
> that none can resist, that none can belittle or ignore. Therein
> lies the distinguishing feature of the Baha'i Revelation. Therein
> lies the strength of the unity of the Faith, of the validity of a
> Revelation that claims not to destroy or belittle previous Revela-
tions, but to connect, unify, and fulfill them. . . . This is why

Periods of crisis in the history of the Faith have been precipi-
tated by direct challenges to the legitimacy of the recognized retainers
of Baha'i authority.     Figure 10 outlines the historical flow of authority
within the Faith and shows when strong challenges have been mounted
with the intention of diverting that flow.     The figure confirms that the
Faith has been most vulnerable during periods of authority transferral.

The first major threat to the continuity of Baha'i authority
occ~rred   in 1863 when Baha'u'llah declared Himself to be the Promised One
whose coming was foretold by the Bab.     At that time, the nominal head of
the Babis was Mirza Yahya, a half-brother of Baha'u'llah who had been
given his position of community leadership by the Bab himself.       Mirza
Yahya refused to recognize his kinsman as the Promised One, and the result
was a struggle for control of the Faith.     Baha'u'llah attracted the vast
majority of the believers, but this did not diminish the intensity of
the conflict.    Although Browne is skeptical,4 it would appear that open
hostilities between the two adversaries eventually contributed to the
Turkish decision to transfer Baha'u'llah and his family and followers to
'Akka and Mirza Yahya and his devotees to Famagusta. 5      In spite of this
enforcedseperation, conflict and rivalry continued between the two, a
situation that was made physically possible because of the Turkish
government's procedure of keeping the rivals under surveillance by

including a few Baha'i "spies" with Mirza Yahya's contingent and vice
versa.   With the passage of time, Baha'u'llah claimed the allegiance of
an increasing proportion of all the believers connected with the religious
tradition initiated by the Bab whereas the influence of Mirza Yahya so
waned that at the time of his death in 1912 no followers, aside from

immediate family, were present at his funeral.        It is clear that in
the long term, Baha'u'llah weathered this challenge to His self-
proclaimed authority, but during His lifetime the activities of Mirza
Yahya had some inhibiting effect on the growth of the Faith.         In par-
ticular, Mirza Yahya was instrumental in agitating Turkish suspicion
towards the Baha'is, thereby encouraging restrictions on the movement of
believers to and from the presence of Baha'u'llah and the transwittal of

correspondence between Him and his far-flung followers.          The situation
became even more difficult when seven Baha'is sought out and killed the
non-Baha'i informers planted by the Turkish government.         There is no
evidence to indicate that the action was condoned by Baha'u'llah, but as
can be imagined the result was, at least in the short run, even more
stringent confinement of the Baha'i community.       The intent here is not
to pass judgment on the actions of either the Baha'is or the followers
of Mirza Yahya; rather it is to demonstrate how it is that internal
division could and did stifle the potential for Baha'i growth.         In this
instance, internal conflict severely disrupted the already tenuous lines

of communication between the leader of the religion and the great
majority of His followers located far to the east.

The next authority crisis occurred at the time of Baha'u'llah's
passing in 1892.    Although clearly designated in   B~ha'u'llah's   will as
the one to whom all Baha'is should turn,    'Abdu'l-Baha's right to guide
the destiny of the Faith was contested by a half-brother named Mirza
Muhammad-'Ali.     The result was a family division of great magnitude.
Nearly all 'Abdu'l-Baha's relatives opposed him and sided with Mirza
Muhammad-'Ali, leaving 'Abdu'l-Baha with the support of his wife, an
unmarried sister, four daughters, and an uncle. 8     The family was exten-
sive; they all lived in 'Akka; they all were knowledgeable about the
Faith and its more prominent adherents.     Thus, as the conflict developed
both sides were in continuous touch with the believers, trying to assert
their divergent claims to leadership.     Eventually the vast majority of
the rank and file fell into line behind 'Abdu'l-Baha, but during the
struggle energy was diverted from the task of diffusing the Faith.        No
quantitative information can be marshalled to support this statement, but
the conclusion is logical considering the circumstances.      Perhaps the
best that can be done is to show how each side in the struggle viewed
the effect of the conflict on the Faith.     Mirza Jawad, an historian
sympathetic to Muhawmad-'Ali, drew the following conclusions:

But alas, alas for what we see to-day! All these spiritual
> virtues and humane practices have undergone a complete change.
> Concord has been replaced by dissension, constancy by cruelty,
> and affection by enmity.  Dissent and mutual avoidance have
> appeared in this community, and their concatenation hath been

> (al-Ghusnu'l-A'zam) 'Abbas Efendi [i.e., 'Abdu'l-Baha], and his
> opposition to the last Testament of His Holiness our Great
> Master Baha'u'llah. 9

Shoghi Effendi, narrating events from 'Abdu'l-Baha's perspective at a
time more distant from the events, also perceived an adverse effect on
the Baha'i community, but concluded that it was a temporary state of
affairs that eventually led to internal purification (in other words,
'Abdu'l-Baha's adversaries were subdued):

Though the rebellion of Mirza Muhamrnad-'Ali precipitated
> many sombre and distressing events, and though its dire con-
> sequences continued for several years to obscure the light of
> the Covenant, to endanger the life of its appointed Center, and
> to distract the thoughts and retard the progress of the activities

Even though these two narrators represent the opposing forces in that
authority struggle, they do agree that the Baha' Ls. of that time were
demoralized and incapacitated by the crisis.

One of the more significant developments associated with the con-
flict between the two half-brothers was the defection of Dr. Ibrahim

9Browne (comp.), Study of the Babi Religion, p. 74. It is not
completely clear that when Mirza Jawad writes "this community" he is
referring to all Baha'is and not just those in 'Akka. Browne, however,
has presumed that Jawad was using the phrase in the general sense since
his margin notes for this paragraph read "lamentation over present
degeneration of Baha'is."

Khayr'u'llah from 'Abdu'l-Baha to Mirza Muhawmad-'Ali.        Dr. Khayr'u'llah
was the first Baha'i to travel to the United States.        During the years
1893-1898 he converted significant numbers of people to the Faith.        He
returned to Egypt and 'Akka for a visit in 1898, but a year and a half
later he was back in North America.        Shortly after his return, however,
it became apparent that his allegiances had shifted and the small,
vulnerable band of American Baha'is was buffeted by the same kinds of
divisive forces that had momentarily crippled the Baha'is of the East six
years earlier.        Of the fact that there was a crisis among the Baha'is of
America there can be little doubt. l l      However, in spite of Dr.
Khayr'u'llah's eminent position as the original teacher of many of those
American believers, he was unable to persuade very many of them to switch
their allegiance as he had done.        As a result, " . . . The great majority
of the American Baha'is adhered to the party of 'Abbas Efendi ['Abdu'l-
Baha] , who had established there as elsewhere a great personal ascen-
dency which his half-brother Muhammad-'Ali cJmpletely failed to

z i.va                 The results of Dr. Khayr'u'llah's defection are hard to
evaluate, but there are some suggestive clues.        Estimates of the size
of the Baha'i population in the United States in 1900 (shortly before
Dr. Khayr'u'llah's shift in allegiances) vary wildly.        Browne notes that
the press reported figures as high as 10,000 and even 30,000, but that
Mr. A. P. Dodge, an American Baha'i passing through Cambridge in 1900,
visited him and personally estimated that there must be at least 3,000

believers. 13    This figure, too, may be a little high, but Mary Lesch,
an early Baha'i living in the Chicago area, tabulated just under 1,440
Baha'is by name in a series of enrollment books that she maintained
until 1899. 14    It is safe to assume, therefore, that as of the time of
Dr. Khayr'u'llah's defection there were at least 1,400 Baha'is in the
United States.     In fact, the number may have been substantially higher.
What is interesting is that a 1906 census of religious bodies for the
United States reports a total of 1,280 resident Baha'is. 1 S   Even allow-
ing for the likelihood of undernumeration, this information would
suggest that during the period 1900-1906 the United States Baha'i
population declined.     What can account for this sudden reversal?   Why
should rapid and accelerating growth at the outset suddenly be displaced
by stagnation and contraction?     There are, perhaps, a number of explan-
at ions that could be proposed, but the idea that an internal crisis over
leadership interrupted the diffusion momentum of the Faith at least has
some (albeit circumstantial) support. 16

16Dr. Khayr'u'llah himself percei.ved a decline in the dynamism of
the Faith and assigned it to the dissension that arose out of the
authority struggle. Browne (comp.), Study of the Babi Religion, p. 171;

The activities of Dr. Khayr'u'llah can be considered as an expres-
sion of the fundamental rift that had formed at the time of Baha'u'llah's
death over the issues of succession and authority--a rift that sharply
divided the members of the Prophet's family and apparently disrupted the
smooth functioning of the affairs of the Faith.         Mirza Muharomad-'Ali con-
tinued to oppose 'Abdu'l-Baha throughout the duration of his ministry,
and at the time of 'Abdu'l-Baha's death was instrumental in resurrecting
the old issues of succession and authority.     The acceptance of Shoghi
Effendi as Guardian of the Faith in 1921 was contingent upon acceptance
of the will and testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the provisions of which were
challenged by Muharnrnad-'Ali and his supporters. 1 7     As in previous
instances, the results were initial shock and bewilderment among the
believers followed by eventual support for the leader designate on the
part of the vast majority of all Baha'is.

Within the Faith, the issue of authority is considered to be vital
to the continued existence of the religion.     Rebellion against recog-
nized authority is viewed as being a selfishly motivated attempt to
undermine the Baha'i unity, thereby rendering the Faith incapable of
achieving its primary objective (spiritual union of all people).           Direct
challenges to recognized Baha'i authority are indeed considered to be
signs of spiritual disease, and all loyal Baha'is are expected to avoid
contact with this contagious, and fatal, malady.         Baha'is sense that
their own disunity would incapacitate the Faith and would certainly
curtail geographic diffusion.    Thus in most cases the early Baha'i

l7Rabb~li, The Priceless Pearl, p. 119; Shoghi Effendi, God Passes
~,   p. 327.

avoided the contender for power and clung to the recognized leader.         The
seriousness with which the Baha'i Faith regards violators of the Faith's
covenant regarding authority is vividly portrayed in a series of tele-
graphic exchanges between a prominent American Baha'i and 'Abdu'l-Baha.
The tone of the exchange captures not only the Baha'i attitude toward
rebellion, but also the crisis atmosphere which it engenders:

. . . On 8 November 1921 He ('Abdu'l-Baha) cabled Roy
> Wilhelm, His trusted correspondent, "How is situation and
> health friends?" to which Mr. Wilhelm, the next day, was
> obliged to reply:   "Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia
> agitating violation centering Fernald, Dyer, Watson. New
> York, Boston refused join, standing solidly constructive

> Baha on 12 November, in the strongest language, and clearly

> Judas Iscariot.   Certainly shun violators.  Inform Goodall,
> True, and Parsons telegraphically." That same day the
> Master in a second c~ble to Roy Wilhelm said:   "I implore
> health from divine bounty." These were the last messages
> America ever received from Him. 18

If, as Baha'is believe, rebellion against authority causes the
dynamic spirit of the Faith to wither, then it is reasonable to expect
that the population growth rate will decline.    Figure 11 extends the
comparison between population size and authority contention that was
developed when discussing the activities of Dr. Khayr'u'llah.       There
does seem to be a pattern of population growth associated with events
supportive of the established authority figure and population decline
at times when the authority has been challenged and countermeasures
taken.   Furthermore, the remarkable growth of   th~   Frlith in the first fpw
years after its introduction to America suggests that the subsequent

levelling off and lack of substantial growth over a thirty year period
may have been caused by the irregularly appearing but persistent author-
ity struggles.        In other words, both the short run and long run trends
in population size offer support for the thesis.

The recent shift from leadership by individual to leadership by
groups of individuals has had certain implications for the diffusion
process.        Since the hierarchy of assemblies that comprise the current
administration is elected on a regular basis according to established
rules, the spectre of leadership transferral is not so traumatic as in
past times when personal commitment to the Faith occasionally became
entangled with personal dedication to the leader.        Today, authority
transfer occurs with such frequent regularity as to virtually eliminate
the difficulties caused by the initial human tendency to cling to the
old and reject the new.        Furthermore, the fact that authority now
rests with institutions rather than individuals obviates the whole
issue.        This is the same sort of institutionalization process as occurs
when a monarchy becomes more important than the monarch:        "The king is
dead; long live the king."

At the same time, however, the charismatic personal leadership
given    ~o    the Faith by the Bab, Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, and Shoghi
Effendi is gone forever.        Their inspiration lives on in the form of the
written word, but the superhrnnan aura which is a part of their charisma
has been diminished by their passing.        The willingness of early Baha'is
to sacrifice their lives for the cause in many cases may have been in-
spired by their closeness to the religious source.        This does not imply
that faith, dedication, and spiritual intoxication die with the Prophet;

it does suggest that, after His death, such qualities must appear through
a vicarious, rather than direct, process.   Baha'i diffusion today depends
on self-purification, planning, dedication, and cooperative effort.   At
the time of the Bab these same elements were present, but there was in
addition a mysterious spontaneity about the religion that was pervasive
and infectious.

CHAPTER VI
POLICY AND PLANNING:       THE KEY TO BAHA'I DIFFUSION

POLICY

Since the beginning of its 134 year history the Baha'i Faith has
followed an expansionist policy regarding its own diffusion.         Clearly
stated, vigorously pursued, and consistently adhered to, expansionism
has always been a conscious policy molding the activities of many of
the believers.   In this study, expansion--or diffusion--is conceived
primarily in terms of demographic growth in time and space.       Numbers and
distribution of Baha'is are taken to be indicative of the relative level
of diffusion achieved by the Faith at any given time.       Frequently, it is
necessary to measure diffusion in terms of the existing administrative
un±ts, but this is really a surrogatp. variable that presumably indicates
the presence of Baha'is.

The Baha'i Faith, though, has a much broader perspective regarding
its own diffusion.   Its expansionist policy is aimed at dissemination
of the principles and beliefs of the Faith.       This definitely means that
the religion solicits   UGH    adherents, but it also means that Baha'i energy
is expended on activities which encourage adoption of Baha'i principles
by non-Baha'i agencies.       Thus, for instance, during the 1920s and 1930s
many Baha'is actively participated in the Esperanto movement,l and in
more recent times Baha'is have been involved in the formation and

lRabbani, The Priceless Pearl, pp. 271-272.

functioning of the United Nations. 2     Furthermore, even in their dealings
with individuals Baha'is often promote their religious principles without
ever mentioning the Faith directly.      To a high degree, however, the Faith
has   consis~ently   endeavored to convert individuals, a policy that meshes
well with the demographic orientation of this diffusion study.

To Baha'is, dissemination of the Faith is not merely a pOlicy; it
is a destiny.     They believe that moral and ethical decline are combining
with such divisive forces as nationalism, economic inequity, and racial
prejudice to produce a world in which established social and political
forces are rapidly disintegrating.      Baha'is anticipate a catastrophic
collapse of human civilization, a state of affairs that will signal the
advent of a new world order in which Baha'i principles of human relations
will prevail.     Baha'is will be swept up in these tumultous events but
at the same time must strive to promulgate the Faith so that:      (1) its
influence can ameliorate the severity of the catastrophe, and (2) the
seeds for a new world order based on Baha'i principles will already be
sown.     This sequence of events was frequently alluded to by Baha'u'11ah 3
in whose writings one can discern the basic theme of global upheaval and
a new world order.     The prevailing Baha'i perception of its own role in
the impending period of transition has been elaborated and crystallized
by Shoghi Effendi:

2The Baha'i World: 1954-1963, XIII, pp. 788-802; The Baha'i World
1968-1973, XIV, pp. 358-377.

3Shoghi Effendi, The Advent of Divine Justice (3rd ed.; Wilmette,
Illinois: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1971), pp. 67-69; Shoghi Effendi,
The World Order of Baha'u'llah, pp. 181, 201.

As we view the world around us we are compelled to observe
the manifold evidence of that universal fermentation which, in
every continent of the globe and in every department of human
life, be it religious, social, economic, or political, is
purging and reshaping humanity in anticipation of the day when
the wholeness of the human race will have been recognized and
its unity established. A twofold process, however, can be
distinguished, each tending in its own way and with an acceler-
ated momentum, to bring to a climax the forces that are trans-
forming the face of our planet. The first is essentially an
integrating process, while the second is fundamentally disrup-
tive. The former, as it steadily evolves, unfolds a system
which may well serve as a pattern for that world policy towards
which a strangely-disordered world is continually advancing;
while the latter, as its disintegrating influence deepens,
tends to tear down, with increasing violence, the antiquated
barriers that seek to block humanity's progress towards its
destined goal. The constructive process stands associated with
the nascent Faith of Baha'u'llah, and is the harbinger of the
New World Order that Faith must erelong establish. The destruc-
tive forces that characterize the other should be identified
with a civilization that has refused to answer to the expecta-
tion of a new age, and is consequently falling into chaos and
decline.

A titanic, a spiritual struggle, unparalleled in its magnitude
yet unspeakably glorious in its ultimate consequences, is being
waged as a result of these opposing tendencies, in this age of
transition through which the organized community of the followers
of Baha'u'llah and mankind as a whole are passing.

The Spirit that has incarnated itself in the institutions of
a rising Faith has, in the course of its onward march for the
redemption of the world, encountered and is now battling with
such for~es as are, in most instances, the very negation of that
Spirit, and whose continued existence must inevitably hinder it
from achieving its purpose. The hollow and outworn institutions,
the obsolescent doctrines and beliefs, the effete and discredited
traditions which these forces represent, it should be observed,
have in certain instances, been undermined by virtue of senility,
the loss of their cohesive power, and their own inherent cor-
ruption. A few have been swept away by the onrushing forces
which the Baha'i Faith has, at the hour of its birth, so
mysteriously released. Others, as a direct result of a vain and
feeble resistance to its rise in the initial stages of its develop-
ment, have died out and been utterly discredited. Still others,
fearful of the pervasive influence of the institutions in which
the same Spirit had, at a later stage, been embodied, had mobilized
their forces and launched their attack, destined to sustain in their
turn after a brief and illusory success, an ignominous defeat. 4

4Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, pp. 170-171.

Through weighty discourses such as this, Shoghi Effendi mobilized
Baha'i opinion regarding world affairs and the role of the Faith in them.
One can easily sense the power and assurance that is exuded by his words,
and to a large extent it is his writings that have endowed the Baha'i
world community with a sense of confidence about its    o~m   destiny and
responsibility.   The followers of Baha'u'llah emerged from the era of
the Guardianship not just optimistic about the future of the Faith and
of the world and not merely apprehensive about the chaotic conditions
currently prevailing, but actually knowing that the world will pass
through a period of severe trial and that ultimately the principles and
values of the Faith they cherish will prevail.     All that remains is to
promote the interests of the Faith so that the period of transition can
be as swift and painless as possible.   But one should never be left
with the impression that Baha'is are unmotivated, lulled by their belief
in destiny into a state of inactive expectancy.     Indeed, in spite of the
promise of the advent of a regenerated world, the Baha'is are admonished
in their own holy writings to strive, continuously strive, to assist its
birth. 5

In summary, one can say that diffusion of the Faith is Baha'i policy
of premier importance, that its implementation is a holy obligation in-
cumbent on all Baha'is, that its execution ).s endowed with a considerable
sense of urgency, and yet that its   cons~~ation   is assured.

Since this study is primarily concerned with geographic aspects of
the demographic spread of the religion, the following discussion of basic

5Se e, for example, Baha'u'llah as quoted by Shcghi Effendi, The
Advent of Divine Justice, pp. 69-70.

diffusion strategies will be confined to issues relevant to population
expansion.     There are three fundamental strategies in the Baha'i popula-
tion diffusion policy:     (1) increase in the number of believers, (2)
achievement of geographic dispersion, and (3) attainment of diversity
(insofar as cherract.er Lst.Lcs of believers is concerned).

Numerical Increase
Effecting Conversions

Increase in the number of believers is, at least at this stage in
the development of the Faith, a diffusion strategy that relies heavily
on conversion of non-believers.     Conversion, in turn, is to be effected
primarily by means uf person-to-person contact between Baha'is     and non-
Baha'is.     Teaching the Faith is a spiritual obligation and statements
by all the central figures reinforce the importance of that duty.
The Bab:

". . . Raise the cry: 'Awake, awake, for, lo! the Gate
> of God is open, and the morning light is shedding its radiance

The Baha'i obligation to teach the Faith is clear and undeniable.

Contrary to what one might expect, however, the individual believer is
neither obliged to submit to a prescribed and standardized teaching
formula nor abandoned to his own devices, undirected and unassisted.
The numerous writings of the Guardian contain many references to the
question of how one should go about teaching the Faith.   He confirms that
the individual believer is an independent agent,lO and yet offers advice
on how Baha'is should undertake their teaching obligation.    He states
that successful teaching requires individual Baha'is to exhibit ".        a
high sense of moral rectitude in their social and administrative
activities, absolute chastity in their individual lives, and complete
freedom from prejudice in their dealings with peoples of a different race,

class, or color."         He then goes on to advise the potential teacher as
to how he should proceed to establish contact with potential converts:

• . . Let him survey the possibilities which the particular
> circumstances in which he lives offer him, evaluate their ad-
> vantages, and proceed intelligently and systematically to
> utilize them for the achievement of the object he has in mind.
> Let him also attempt to devise such methods as association with

> the teachings and ideals of his Cause such as temperance, morality,
> social welfare, religious and racial tolerance, economic cooper-
> ation, Islam, and Comparative Religion, or participation in social,

> Faith, will open up to him a multitude of ways and means whereby
> he can enlist successively the sympathy, the support, and
> ultimately the allegiance of those with whom he comes in con-
> tact.       12

In dealing with an individual, Shoghi Effendi makes a number of sug-
gestions to the would-be Baha'i teacher:

• Let him consider the degree of his hearer's receptivity,
> and decide for himself the suitability of either the direct or
indirect method of teaching,      13

Let him refrain, at the outset, from insisting on such

> patiently, tactfully, and yet determindedly, into full maturity,
> and aid him to proclaim his unqualified acceptance of whatever
has been ordained by Baha'u'llah . . . . 14

Let him not be content until he has infused into his

The Demography of Conversion

Conversion represents the aggressive approach to the problem of
numerical increase, an approach which is most appropriate in the early

stages of a religious movement when total numbers are small, the age
structure may be old, the sex ratio is low,16 and family structures are
incomplete.   Under these conditions the potential for natural increase is
poor since there are liable to be relatively few married couples who are
both believers and who are still young enough to have children.    Further-
more, those children who do grow up in the shade of the religion may,
upon reaching adulthood, find it hard to locate potential marriage
partners who also are Baha'is.    The result will be a high rate of inter-
marriage with non-believers and a consequent perpetuation, or even
intensification, of the family structure problem characteristic of the
older generation.

Demographic problems of this sort typified the United States Baha'i
population during the first forty to fifty years of its existence, and as
a result much the greatest proportion of all numerical growth was a con-
sequence of conversion rather than natural increase.    With the passage
of time, however, the numbers of American believers increased and the
demographic abnormalities associated with the earliest stage of growth
began to diminish in intensity.    Consequently, the Baha'i community's
potential for natural increase has improved and the reliance on con-
version to bring about population growth, although still extremely

16 I t is typical for female adherents to outnumber male adherents,
especially in smaller scale, more recent religious movements. For docu-
mentation of this, peruse the wealth of statistics contained in the
following: U.s. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Religious
Bodies: 1936 (2 volumes; Washington, D.C.: Gove~nment Printing Office,
1941); Vol. II, Part I: Denominations A to J, Statistics, History,
Doctrine, Organization, and Work.

strong, is no longer quite so complete.     Since Baha'i authoritative
writings strongly emphasize teaching the Faith, however, it is reasonable
to expect that conversion will continue to be the main component of
population change.     The importance of conversion to population growth is
further enhanced by the geographically dispersed character of the Baha'i
community.    Even though Baha'i numbers are becoming sufficiently large to
make feasible a higher rate of intra-group marriage and a consequent
increase in the number of children raised entirely within a Baha'i home
environment, the highly dispersed nature of the Baha'i population, both
globally and at the national level in North America, means that anyone
local community is still likely to be very small and thus vulnerable to
such demographic facts as high rates of intermarriage with non-Baha'is
and high incidence of family situations in which only some of the family
members are Baha'is.     The nature of the situation is exemplified by the
dispersed Baha'i population of the United States.     Although adult Baha'is
in the United States numbered well in excess of 40,000 in 1976, there was
no one local community, even in the largest cities, that approached a
size of 1,000.    Indeed, only two dozen communities exceeded 100 in size,
and of those only eight had Baha'i populations in excess of 200.     Nearly
all these "large" Baha'i communities are located in major urban centers
~mere   Baha'is continue to represent an infinitesimally small fraction of
the     local population, thus negating the idea that the larger Baha'i
communities are examples of population within which social activities,
including marriage, are likely to be self-contained.     Conversion, there-
fore, continues to be the primary force behind population growth in the
United States.

In the United States during the period January 16, 1976 - April 21,
1976, there were 810 enrollments into the Baha'i Faith and 861 Baha'i
youths who achieved adulthood. 1 7   This would suggest a fairly equal
balance between conversion and natural increase, but in fact the
significance of conversion is greatly understated by these figures since
a substantial portion of all enrollments in recent years has involved
conversion of people aged 18 through 20.     Consequently, many of the
Baha'i youths who achieved adult status during the three month period
were recent converts and not children who grew up in the Faith.

Discouraging Disaffection:   Consolidation

In contradistinction to conversion, which is an aggressive method
of increasing population numbers, there is an important protective
strategy employed by the Baha'i community which has the effect of in-
suring that population growth is not inhibited by excessive rates of dis-
affection.   Naturally, Baha'i sacred writings have emphasized the
necessity of remaining steadfast to the cause of Baha'ullah,18 but at a
more practical level there are numerous references that identify specific
ways in which believers can be strengthened in their commitment to the
Faith.

17Enrollment figures were obtained from enrollment files in the
National Teaching Committee office of the National Spiritual Assembly
of the Baha'is of the united States.

18 Ba ha'u'llah, Prayers and Meditations, trans. by Shoghi Effendi
(Wilmette, Illinois: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1971), p. 346. The index
listing for "steadfastness" indicates the significance it has in Baha'i
literature.

'Abdu'l-Baha declared that Baha'is must work in groups in order to
achieve their objectives 19 and both Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha stressed
the obligation of individual believers to "take council together" and to
"consort in unity.,,20   This shows that the Baha'i Faith places a premium
on cooperative effort and generally discourages an individualistic,
isolated approach to the religion.   By maintaining a high level of
interaction among Baha'is, the religion discourages theological division
while heightening the individual believer's commitment.   Shoghi Effendi
explicitly defined the strategy and objective of this defensive approach
when he stated that local Spiritual Assemblies ". • . must endeavor to
promote amity and concord among the Friends [Baha'is], efface every
lingering trace of distrust, coolness and estrangement from every heart,
and secure in its stead an active and wholehearted cooperation for the
service of the Cause.,,21

To some extent, the Baha'i emphasis on cooperative endeavor helps
to reconcile those two aspects of the Faith that encourage individual
believers to (1) develop a personal and self-sufficient attitude towards
Baha'i knowledge and spirituality, and yet (2) establish a pattern for
living that transcends not only the individual and the family, but even
the Baha'i community, so as to achieve an attitude of responsibility to

the global human family.    Both themes, the individualistic and the all-
embracing, frequently are present in Baha'i sacred writings,22 and it is
easy to see that preoccupation with them would tend to inhibit the
development of the Baha'i Faith as an independent world religion having
its own unique character.   Without some group cohesion and internal
perception of uniqueness the Baha'i diffusion process would likely have
been accompanied by gradual dilution of the Baha'i principles, eventual
dissolution of Baha'i unity, and ultimate absorption and assimilation
(as well as corruption) of the original Baha'i message.

In more recent times, however, it has become evident that attempts
to strengthen Baha'i commitment have involved group assistance and co-
operative effort at least in part to assure that numerical gains through
conversion are not offset by losses through disaffection.    This is
apparent from the fact that group efforts to insure steadfastness,
commonly referred to as "consolidation," are frequently discussed in the
same context with group efforts to effect conversions.    Consider the
clarity with which the following quotation outlines a two-pronged
strategy for insuring numerical growth:

While • . . vital teaching work is progressing each National

> inseparable processes and must go hand in hand. The inter-

Both Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha stressed the importance of each
believer independently investigating the Faith (A Synopsis and Codifica-
tion of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, The Most Holy Book of Baha'u'llah (Haifa:
Baha'i World Centre, 1973), p. 27; Baha'i World Faith, p. 246); and they
both emphasize man's obligation to recognize the need for, and reality
of world unity (Baha'i World Faith, pp. 168, 210, 246; Baha'u'llah's
The Hidden Words, trans. by Shoghi Effendi (revised ed.; Wilmette,
Illinois: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1970), p. 20).

multitudes under the shadow of the Cause. 23

It should be noted that because this research is admittedly pre-
occupied with Baha'i growth (particularly as represented by numerical
increase) expansion and consolidation are considered from the limited
point of view of their implications for the growth of the size of the
Baha'i   comm~~ity.   In fact, of course, reference to expansion and con-
solidation in Baha'i literature suggests that the twin processes are
important not only for numerical growth but also for the growth and
development of (1) the administrative system, (2) the Baha'i imags in the
eyes of the non-Baha'i world, and (3) the unique aspects of Baha'i life.
Be that as it may, the above quotation leaves no doubt that the Baha'i
concepts of expansion and consolidation are to a considerable degree
tied to the notion of numerical growth.

The Baha'i concept of consolidation is frequently associated with
the task of confirming and strengthening new believers.

23Arise to Serve: A Compilation (New Delhi: Baha'i Publishing
Trust, 1971), pp. 111-112. This quotation is from a letter written by
the Universal House of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies
engaged in mass teaching campaigns. The letter is dated February 2,
1966\.

The Baha'i community's obligation to strengthen new believers is
definitely a defensive   s~rategy   in that it discourages disaffection.   When
the obligation is effectively fulfilled, however, the consequences can
be not mere maintenance of Baha'i enrollments (a defensive stance), but
actual increase in the number of declarants (an aggressive posture):
liThe friends should be made to realize that in teaching the Faith to
others they should not only aim at assisting the seeking soul to join the
Faith, but also at making him a teacher of the Faith and its active
supporter. 1125

Although there has been this recent emphasis on unified community
action, the Baha'i Faith continnes to rely on both individual and

cooperative effort to achieve its growth objectives.            That growth is
stimulated and safeguarded by means of the twin strategies of expansion
and consolidation.          The rationale underlying the expansion and consoli-
dation strategies, the legitimacy of their pursuit, and even the tactics
to be employed in their execution, have been clearly laid down by the
accepted sources of authority within the Faith.             In other words, Baha'i
diffusion, in the form of growth in the number of believers, is not
merely current policy; it is part of the Baha'i belief system ultimately
rooted in the writings of those individuals and those administrative
bodies that Baha'is the world over recognize as being divinely inspired
and fundamentally infallible.

Dispersion
The Origins of the Dispersion Strategy

Geographic dispersion has been a theme of Baha'i diffusion ever
since 1844 when the Bah instructed his first disciple, Mulla Husayn, to
spread word of the Faith throughout Persia:

II    Gird up the loins of endeavour, and arise to diffuse
> my cause . . . • Even as the cloud that rains its bounty upon
> the earth, traverse the land from end to end, and shower upon
> its people the blessings which the Almighty, in his mercy, has
> deigned to confer upon you . . • . "26

In a similar fashion, the Bah appealed to the remainder of the Letters
of the Living to " . . . Scatter throughout the length and breadth of
this land, and, with steadfast feet and sanctified hearts, prepare the
way for His [Baha'u'llah'sl coming.               1127   Indeed, the Bab even gave

a mild degree of territorial expression to His plans for geographic
spread by assigning to each disciple his own native province as a
teaching area. 28    All of this clearly signifies a very early Baha'i
preoccupation with geographic dispersal--a dispersal designed to insure
that teaching efforts would result in a widely distributed Baha'i
community.

Baha'u'llah, too, encouraged geographic dispersion, and in doing
so enlarged the arena of Baha'i activity so as to include not just
Persia and the associated Shi'ah realm, but the entire world.     In cer-
tain instances, the actions of Baha'u'llah, rather than His words,
testify to His belief that His religion would become world embracing.
The letters that He wrote to kings, rulers, and religious leaders of the
world exhorting them to accept His Message 29 are a testimonial to tne
territorial breadth of His vision.    That vision was given expression
within the text of the letters:

• . . God grant that the light of unity may envelop the
> whole earth, and that the sea], 'the Kingdom is God's', may
be stamped upon the brow of all its peoples. 3D

We can well perceive how the whole human race is encom-
> passed with great, with incalculable afflictions. We see
> it languishing on its bed of sickness, sore-tried and dis-
illusioned. They that are intoxicated by self-conceit have

> interposed themselves between it and the Divine and infallible
> Physician. witness how they have entangled all men, them-
> selves included, in the mesh of their devices. They can
> neither discover the cause of the disease, nor have they any
> knowledge of the remedy. They have conceived the straight to
> be crooked, and have imagined their friend an enemy.31

Baha'u'llah viewed His own advent as the beginning of a worldwide
religious movement.         In order to effect the global transformation in-
volved, He apparently dispatched believers to a number of distant
regions. 34   At the same time, He encouraged all believers to help bring
about geographic dispersion of the Faith:

• • . "They that have forsaken their country . • • for
> the purpose of teaching Our Cause--these shall the Faithful
> Spirit strengthen through its power • • • By My Life! No act,
> however great, can compare with it, except such deeds as have
> been ordained by God, the All-Powerful, the Most Mighty. Such
> a service is indeed the prince of a11 goodly deeds, and the
> ornament of every goodly act."35

The passing of Baha'u'llah in 1892 marked the beginning of 'Abdu'l-
Baha's ministry, and it was this man, the Prophet's son, who stimulated
and coordinated a truly global diffusion of the Baha'i Faith.           Baha'u'llah
had given His religion a global outlook and had, from His places of con-
finement, encouraged the geographic dispersion of His believers, but it
was not until the time of        'P~du'l-Baha   that dispersion on a worldwide
scale really began to take place.         It was 'Abdu'l-Baha who sent Dr.
Khayr'u'llah to the United States to teach the Faith, and it was that

event which initiated global diffusion.   In the years that followed,
'Abdu'l-Baha corresponded personally with a number of individual
believers encouraging them to disperse and teach the Faith.   Finally, in
the latter years of his ministry, he outlined an overall form and direc-
tion for this dispersal process in the Tablets of the Divine Plan which
he addressed to the North American believers.

The words of 'Abdu'l-Baha most clearly define his commitment to the
principle of dispersion:   "    • now is the time that you may divest
yourselves from the garment of attachment to this phenomenal realm, be
wholly severed from the physical world, become angels of heaven and
travel and teach through all • . • regions."36   This particular quota-
tion is drawn from a tablet addressed to the Baha'is of North America
encouraging them to diffuse the Faith to the rest of the Western
hemisphere.   In other tablets to the American believers 'Abdu'l-Baha
emphasized the need to spread the Faith to all parts of the world:

Consider! The station and the confirmation of the apostles
> in the time of Christ was not known, and no one looked on them
> with the feeling of importance--nay, rather, they persecuted
> and ridiculed them. Later on it became evident what crowns
> studded with the brilliant jewels of guidance were placed on
> the heads of the apostles, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother
of John.

Likewise your confirmation is not known at the present time.

> I hope that ere long it may throw a mighty reverberation through
> the pillars of the earth. Therefore it is the hope of 'Abdu'l-
> Baha that just as ye are confirmed and assisted on the continent
> of America, ye may also be confirmed and assisted in other con-
> tinents of the globe--that is, ye may carry the fame of the
> Cause of God to the East and to the West and spread the Glad
> Tidings of the Appearance of the Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts
> throughout the five continents of the World. 37

36 'Abdu'l-Baha, Tablets of the Divine Plan (Wilmette, Illinois:
Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1975), p. 11.
37 I bi d., p. 12.

In fact, throughout all of 'Abdu'l-Baha's tablets to the American
believers there are numerous passages urging them to scatter around
the world in order to spread the Faith.

Shoghi Effendi continued the Baha'i emphasis on dispersal.      He
appealed to the believers to travel extensively, to settle in foreign
lands, and to continually seek opportunities to introduce the Faith in
localities hitherto unaware of its message.   One of the most intriguing
aspects of Shoghi Effendi's character is his meticulous concern with
not exceeding his proscribed authority as interpreter of the sacred
writings--a concern that results in his frequently citing the actual
words of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha and allowing those words to stand
as their own interpretation.   Shoghi Effendi merely appealed to the
believers to do what his grandfather and great-grandfather already had
told them to do.   Consider, for instance, the way in which Shoghi
Effendi, on the third anniversary of 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, when writing
to the American believers about the need to disperse, quotes his grand-
father's eloquent appeal to the same body of believers regarding the
same issue:

. Let us recall, and seek on this sad occasion the
> comfort of, the last wishes of our departed yet ever-watchful
Master ['Abdu'l-Baha):--

"It behooveth them not to rest for a moment, neither to seek
> repose. They must disperse themselves in every land, pass by
> every clime, and travel throughout all regions. Bestirred,
> without rest, and steadfast to the end, they must raise in every
> land the triumphal cry 'Ya Baha'u'l-Abha!' (0 Thou the Glory of
> Glories) • . • . The disciples of Christ forgot themselves and
> all earthly things, forsook all their cares and belongings,
> purged themselves of self and passion, and with absolute detach-
> ment scattered far and wide and engaged in calling the peoples
> of the world to the divine guidance; till at last they made the
> world another world, illumined the surface of the earth, and
even to their last hour proved self-sacrificing in the pathway

> of that beloved One of God. Finally in various lands they
> suffered glorious martyrdom. Let them that are men of action
follow in their footsteps!"

Having grasped the significance of these words, having
> obtained a clear understanding of the true character of our
> mission, the methods to adopt, the course to pursue, and
> having attained sufficiently the individual regeneration--the
> essential requisite of teaching--let us arise to teach His Cause
> with righteousness, conviction, understanding and vigor. Let
> this be the paramount and most urgent duty of every Baha'i.
> Let us make it the dominating passion of our life. Let us
> scatter to the uttermost corners of the earth; sacrifice our
> personal interests, comforts, tastes, and pleasures; mingle
> with the diverse kindreds and peoples of the world; familiar-
> ize ourselves with their manners, traditions, thoughts and
> customs; arouse, stimulate and maintain universal interest in
> the Movement, and at the same time endeavor by all the means
> in our power, by concentrated and persistent attention, to
> enlist the unreserved allegiance and the active support of the
> more hopeful and receptive among our hearers . . • • 38

This, perhaps better than any other single statement, captures the spirit
and dedication underlying the Baha'i commitment to geographic dispersion.

The Dispersion Strategy Today

Dispersion remains to this day as one of the fundamental diffusion
strategies employed by the Baha'i Faith.   During the ministries of
'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi the size of the Baha'i community was so
small and the amount of territory remaining unopened to the Faith was
so great that those two religious leaders persistently and eloquently
emphasized the role of dispersion in the global diffusion process.     The
Universal House of Justice has perpetuated this trend 39 even though the
world status of the Faith has changed dramatically.    Today, there are

> 38shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration, p. 69.

39 s ee, for example, Universal House of Justice, Wellspring of
Guidance, pp. 6-7, 24, 75-77.

firmly established Baha'i communities and administrative bodies in nearly
all non-communist nations of the world, a situation that would presumably
diminish the need for dispersion on the same scale as in the past.
Nevertheless, the Baha'i community, its leadership, and its growth plans
continue to place great importance on the dispersion of believers.       There
seem to be two reasons for this.   In the first place, the character of
the dispersion process has changed.     In the early days dispersal by
individuals meant movement to large territories--frequently national in
status--thac were totally devoid of believers and utterly ignorant of
the Baha'i message.   The task was to convert a nuclear group of people
who, along with the original pioneer, could subsequently work for expan-
sion of the religion's influence in that area.     In more recent times,
dispersion has involved the movement of believers to particular
localities within those larger territorial units for the purpose of
increasing the network of places having Baha'is and enlarging the total
number of Local Spiritual Assemblies.    To put it simply, dispersion in
the early days was concerned with establishing Baha'i communities in
every country whereas dispersion nowadays is aimed at founding Baha'i
communities in every city, town, and village of every country.     In both
cases the scale of operations is global, but in the latter case the degree
of geographic articulation is much greater.

The necessity for international movement of pioneers persists.        Many
countries and regions of the world have what might be called infant
Baha'i national communities which are perhaps numerically smaller than
some of the older, more established national communities, and are less
knowledgeable about, and less experienced with, Baha'i beliefs and laws.

Of equal importance is the lack of material resources that frequently
characterizes some of these national areas.    As a result of these
imbalances, pioneers often disperse across national boundaries to serve
the needs of less well endowed national communities.    One should not
be left with the impression that there are established one-way flows
of pioneers, however, for no matter how small and struggling a given
national Baha'i community it invariably inherits a responsibility to

supply pioneers to some other part of the world.

The second reason for the continued strong emphasis on dispersion
has to do with the Baha'i belief that the world around us is in a state
of decay and disintegration.    As was outlined at the beginning of this
chapter, Baha'is look upon the world as currently passing through a
revolutionary change wherein established institutions and beliefs will
be swept away and replaced by a new world order that embodies Baha'i
laws.     Baha'is do not expect the transition to be smooth; indeed, they
anticipate heightened levels of persecution and intensified anti-Baha'i
propaganda as the established religious, economic, and political powers
recognize the increasing threat which the Baha'i Faith poses to their
authority.     It is expected that anti-Baha'i activity will be paralleled
by a general disintegration in global conditions--a disintegration that
Baha'is perceive in the form of heightened international tensions,

40Notice, for example, the international projects assigned to
nearly all the National Spiritual Assemblies in the Five Year Plan:
Universal House of Justice, Analysis of the Five Year International
Teaching Plan, 1974-1979 (Welwyn Garden City, England: The Broadwater
Press Limited, 1975), pp. 21-45.

increasing national isolationism, deteriorating economic and social
conditions, and perhaps even global war.    As all of these darkening
forces gather momentum it will become increasingly difficult for Baha'i
activities to proceed unimpeded.    It is this concern which motivates
Baha'is to continue to urgently strive for dispersal.    The prevailing
belief is that if well-grounded Baha'i communities are established in
as many different localities as possible then the capacity of the Faith
to weather the storm of transition will be at its greatest and the sub-
sequent potential of the religion to direct the form of the new world
order will be   optimized.

Diversity
Diversity as an Ideal

The Baha'i thrust to achieve diverse membership, although presently
comparable in priority to the objectives of numerical growth and geographic
dispersion, has grown out of a Baha'i tradition that is far less explicit.
It has been possible to identify specific appeals by all the major
figures in the Faith urging the Baha'i community to strive to achieve
the twin objectives of growth and dispersion, but the concept of com-
positional diversity has gradually emerged as a fundamental planning
objective as a consequence of much more subtle statements by Baha'u'llah,
'Abdu'l-Baha, and Shoghi Effendi.    The principal difference is that these
men focused attention on the need for diversity by noticing it and
praising it whenever it was present among a group of Baha'is.    They
practiced positive reinforcement, and the result was the gradual develop-
ment of a Baha'i consciousness of the desirability of diversity.

This is not to say that Baha'i leadership failed to make appeals
to the members on behalf of the cause of compositional diversity.      In
fact, there are explicit statements which exhort Baha'is to actively
pursue diversity of membership, but compared to the emphasis on growth
and dispersion, the   ~umber   of such exhortations is relatively small.
A consequence of this is that diversity was not a goal in some of the
earlier Baha'i growth plans. 41

In spite of the fact that diversity has been somewhat slow to
emerge as an explicit planning objective, historically it has been a
noticeable characteristic of many Baha'i communities.      Even in the time
of the Bab believers were drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds and
from all walks of life. 42     In more recent years there are additional bits
and pieces of evidence that support this contention.      A survey of North
American Baha'is in 1936 43 reveals that they were drawn in substantial

41Exception can be taken to this statement on the grounds that
'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets of the Divine Plan--the earliest identifiable
Baha'i plan and the master scheme for all subsequent planning efforts--
clearly identifies a need for Baha'i membership to be expanded so as to
include a wide variety of racial and ethnic stocks. In spite of this,
however, it was not until after the Second Seven Year Plan (1945-1952)
that specific goals were formulated to insure balanced growth insofar as
racial background, religious background, language, sex, age, and social
class are concerned.

42Comte de Gobineau, an eminent French historian who was contemporary
with the Bab, repeatedly emphasized that Babis were drawn from many
different backgrounds (see The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 501, 659, 663). Comte
de Gobineau's view has been collaborated by that of E. G. Browne (Ibid.,
p. 644).

43A detailed analysis of this survey will be undertaken at a
later point in this study. The survey did not solicit information
regarding economic and occupational characteristics of the membership,
but all the respondents from the Chicago area were asked to identify their
occupation. The responses showed substantial diversity, and it is on the

numbers from a variety of religious backgrounds, were representative of
a broad spectrum of economic and occupational situations and were sur-
prisingly representative of the Black race (5.1 percent of all Baha'is
were black even though at that time the Faith was largely confined to
the Northeast, the Midwest, and the West Coast).44

Furthermore, the philosophical foundations for a Baha'i emphasis on
diversity were laid by Baha'u'llah when he proclaimed the unity and
brotherhood of all mankind:

> "The Tabernacle of Unity," Baha'u'llah proclaims in his message
> to all mankind, "has been raised; regard ye not one another as
> strangers. . • • Of one tree are all ye the fruit and of one
> bough the leaves . . . . The world is one country and mankind its
> citizens . • . . Let not a man glory in that he loves his country;
> let him glory in this, that he loves his kind."45

This is the clarion call of the Baha'i Faith, and it should be obvious
that the followers of Baha'u'llah can hardly hope to respond to the call
unless they are willing, and indeed eager, to incorporate into their
midst the diversity that characterizes the world's human multitude.     The

basis of this fragmentary evidence that. 1936 Baha'is are considered to
have been "representative of a broad spectrum of economic and occupational
situations." The following figures give a rough idea of how the data
broke do~m for the 115 Chicago respondents who indicated their occupations:
professionals-22; blue-collar workers-14; service workers-35; students-2;
housewives-35; unclassified-7.

44 And yet, according to Shoghi Effendi, Baha'is were not as
diverse in America as in India and Burma where the greatest variety of
races, creeds, and tongues were incorporated into the Faith. Shoghi
Effendi, Dawn of a New Day (New Delhi: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1970(?»,

45 Baha'u'llah as quoted by Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of
Baha'u'llah, p. 41.

only other option would be to attempt an eradication of all human diver-
sity in an effort to bring about a centralized world system, but this is
not the objective.   In fact, as 'Abdu'l-Baha made clear, the Baha'i Faith
encourages diversity because it is an expression of God.

Should anyone contend that true and enduring unity can in
> nowise be realized in this world inasmuch as its people widely
> differ in their manners and habits, their tastes, their temper-
> ament and character, their thoughts and their views, to this we

Diversity as an Objective

'Abdu'l-Baha clearly delineated the Baha'i position.   He indicated
that diversity is not merely acceptable; it is laudable.    In his Tablets
of the Divine Plan he explicitly called upon the American Baha'is to

46 The Divine Art of Living: Selections from the Writings of
Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, camp. by Mabel Hyde Paine (revised ed.;
Wilmette, Illinois: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1970), pp. 109-110.

obtain converts among all the world's ethnic groups.47        Racial extract
and religious background are the two types of human diversity that
'Abdu'l-Baha emphasized but these notions of diversity were eventually
supplemented with numerous others.    The effort to encompass racial
variety, however, has always remained the key objective in the Baha'i
thrust toward diversity of membership.        An example of this focus can be
drawn from a message written by Shoghi Effendi in 1938 when he was
attempting to inspire and direct the American believers who recently had
been given responsibility for conducting the First Seven Year Plan.

Let anyone who feels the urge among the participators in
> this crusade, which e~braces all the races, all the republics,
> classes, and denominations of the entire Western Hemisphere,
> arise, and circumstances permitting, direct in particular the
> attention, and win eventually the unqualified adherence, of
> the Negro, the Indian, the Eskimo, and Jewish races to his

> rendered the Cause of God, at the present hour, than a success-
> ful effort to enhance the diversity of the members of the
> American Baha'i community by swelling the ranks of the Faith
> through the enrollment of the members of these races. 48

Numerous examples could be cited of the way in which Shoghi Effendi
appealed to Baha'is the world over to incorporate into their midst
peoples of all racial backgrounds,49 but the above quotation can stand          uS
an example of the sort of specific appeal he commonly made.

Racial variety was always his strongest thrust, but other forms of
human diversity were stressed by the Guardian as well:

"Every laborer in these fields, whether as traveling teacher
or settler, should, I feel, make it his chief and constant

If one were to ignore the general intent of the above quotation and focus
instead on its technicalities it might be possible to conclude that the
Guardian was asking not for diversity and representativeness, but rather
for nothing more than a thorough search to identify and convert those
souls most receptive to the Faith, regardless of their background.   If
this were to become the prevailing Baha'i view of its own obligation, then
with time the membership of the Faith could become uniform and unrepre-
sentative since people have a tendency to be more positively disposed
towards those who are like themselves.   But the Guardian prohibited such
a trend by flatly stating that " . . . every organized community, enlisted
under the banner of Baha'u'llah should feel it to be its first and
inescapable obligation to nurture, encourage, and safeguard every
minority belonging to any faith, race, class, or nation within it."SI
Indeed, he insured the realization of this principle by stipulating that

> " . . it should be the duty of every Baha'i community so to
> arrange its affairs that in cases where individuals belonging
> to the diverse minority elements within it are already qualifi~d
> and fulfill the necessary requirements, Baha'i representative

> committees may have represented on them as many of these diverse
> elements, racial or otherwise, as possible. The adoption of such

> the freedom of His followers from the taint of those pre-
> judices which have already wrought such havoc in the domestic
> affairs, as well as in the foreign relationships, of the
> nations. "52

This conscious policy of discrimination in favor of minorities works
in union with a general preoccupation with representativeness to achieve
a surprising result.       It builds into the whole Baha'i expansionary pro-
gram a self-corrective mechailisrn that insures balanced growth.    As soon
as it becomes apparent to the believers in a community that their com-
position is not representative of the population at large, there is a
spontaneous concern with the bias and a subsequent modification of the
expansionary goal so as to redress the perceived imbalance.

The Baha'i population of the united States, for example, was almost
devoid of American Indians in 1936, but since then growth plans have
repeatedly emphasized the need to reach this minority group (a need,
incidentally, that 'Abdu'l-Baha strongly emphasized as early as 1917 when
he drafted the Tablets of the Di7ine Plan) with the result that
American Indians drawn from a wide variety of tribes now comprise a dis-
proportionate share of the total Baha'i population.       Similarly, during the
1950s the United States Baha'is became aware of a relative lack of young
people, and the subsequent emphasis on youth enrollments brought about a
dramatic shift in the age composition of the population.       Currently, young
people are numerous in the Faith and many suspect that the imbalance may
have shifted in the other direction.

52 I b i d., p. 30.

Ip any event, demographic representativeness has become one of
the criteria by which the Baha'i community evaluates its own image.
Baha'u'llah grounded the principle of diversity in the overall belief
structure of the Faith; 'Abdu'l-Baha insisted on the principle being
reflected in the actual composition of the Baha'i population; Shoghi
Effendi showed the believers how to close the gap between the ideal and
the reality.   The strength and continuity of this leadership has estab-
lished a tradition that the Universal House of Justice has perpetuated.
The following extract from a 1967 letter to the National Spiritual
Assemblies of tile world indicates not only the importance placed on
diversity by the Universal House of Justice, but also the breadth of the
concept in the current Baha'i world:

The paramount goal of the teaching work at the present time
> is to carry the message of Baha'u'llah to every stratum of
> human society and every walk of life. An eager response to the

> in a fertile area awakens a response in those who were at first
uninterested.

PLANNING

The Importance of the Individual
Demographic expansion through numerical increase, geographical
dispersion, and compositional diversity has been Baha'i policy since the
earliest days of the Faith.   But how has this policy been implemented?
A scientific answer to this question is extremely difficult to formulate
since the agents of diffusion--usually individual believers--respond to a
series of principles and guidelines that, although universally accepted
by the Baha'i world community, are not accompanied by a set of societal
rewards and punishments designed to encourage the desired behavior.      In
other words, the individual believer may feel morally or spiritually
obliged to work for the objectives defined in a Baha'i plan, but if he
fails to make the sacrifice required, his status as a Baha'i is not
jeopardized.   Conversely, dedicated support for plan objectives does not
insure the individual believer of a higher standing in the group.54
There are certain rewards toward which a believer conceivably would be
motivated to strive, in particular the appointive position of Continental
Counsellor or Auxilliary Board Member.     Similarly, before the passing of
Shoghi Effendi a Baha'i could hope to achieve selection as a Hand of the
Cause.   All these positions, however, require enormous commitment and
dedication on the part of the holder, and they invest him with neither
authority nor any form of economic compensation.     Since the only apparent

54There is one notable exception to this generalization. During the
Ten Year Plan (1953-1963) any believer who migrated to an unopened country
or territory during the first year of the plan was designated as a "Knight
of Baha'u'llah," a title that conferred prestige and respect on its
recipient.

motivation for seeking any of these appointments is social status within
the group, and since the very act of appointment invites intensified
commitment and increased sacrifice, it is reasonable to expect that the
likelihood of appointment acts as an incentive only for those individuals
who already have a strong dedication to the Faith--the very believers who
are likely to strive for planning objectives anyway.

Implementation of Baha'i plans, therefore, relies very heavily on
active support from the community of believers.       The administrative
structure and doctrinal orientation of the Faith create a favorable
climate for the pursuit of planned global expansion, but the actual
process of plan implementation has proceeded largely through efforts of
individual Baha'is.     From this perspective it would appear that the degree
to which the Faith successfully executes its plans may be a reasonable
indicator of the strength and dynamism of the Faith and the level of
commitment of its believers.

'Abdu'l-Baha and the Tablets of the Divine Plan
Implementing the Plan

Until 1916 the course of Baha'i diffusion was governed by the trans-
mittal of directions from the charismatic leader (the Bab, Baha'u'llah,
and finally 'Abdu'l-Baha) to individual followers.       There may have been
a guiding plan for    Ba~a'i   expansion, but if so it only existed in the
minds of the major figures of the Faith; the rank and file were not aware
of any such grand design.       In 1916 and 1917, however, the structure of
the Baha'i diffusion process began to undergo a profound change.       During
this period 'Abdu'l-Baha penned a series of messages to the Baha'is of
the United States and Canada in which he designated them as the teaching

instrument chosen to undertake a global dissemination of the Faith. 55       He
indicated that the Baha'i community of North America must devote itself
to the task of spreading the Faith to all parts of the world.     Within the
text of these messages 'Abdu'l-Baha reinforced this basic theme by
identifying specific countries, territories, and localities that North
American Baha'is ought to open to the Faith.

'Abdu'l-Baha conceived of a diffusion process that was to rely on
the migration and circulation of believers to those areas of the world
totally unware of the Faith.     These itinerant Baha'is were to establish
personal contact with local individuals and inform them of the existence
and character of the religion.     This diffusion process was expected to
result in conversions to the Faith and subsequent establishment of Baha'i
communities.

'Abdu'l-Baha interspersed his messages with advice concerning the
spiritual conditions a Baha'i must attain before successfully partici-
pating in the global campaign.    He emphasized two essential prerequisites:
(1) firmness of belief, and (2) fellowship, love, and unity among the
believers.     In addition, he indicated that any Baha'i intending to teach
the Faith must be pure, independent, spiritual, tranquil, resolute, and
magnanimous.     If a believer who wishes to participate in Baha'i diffusion
exhibits these qualities, then, as 'Abdu'l-Baha puts it, ..        his
sanctified breath will even affect the rock; otherwise there will be no
result whatsoever. . • . ,,56

55Th i s series of messages eventually came to be known as the Tablets
of the Divine Plan. Although five of these messages were published in Star
of the West in 1916, it was not until two years later, after World War I
that the remainder of the Tablets of the Divine Plan reached the Baha'i
believers in North America.
56'Abdu'l-Baha, Tablets of the Divine Plan, p. 20.

'Abdu'l-Baha was particularly concerned with the communication
problem posed by language differences.        He insisted that "The teachers
traveling in different directions must know the language of the country
in which they will enter . • . . ,,57     and he further insisted that "Books
and pamphlets must be     eit~er   translated or composed in the languages of
these countries           , to be circulated in every part and in all
directions. ,,58

'Abdu'l-Baha also encouraged the believers to corne together in
meetings for the purposes of discussing teaching strategies and informing
each other about the beliefs and history of the Faith (presumably so that
they might be more competent and effective diffusion agents).59

Regional Structures

The Tablets of the Divine Plan include fourteen separate messages,
four of which were addressed to the entire body of believers in North
America and ten of which were addressed to the believers in five distinct
regions on the continent.     The pairs of messages sent to each of the five
regional divisions of North America strongly encouraged internal disper-
sion but did not emphasize interregional (or intercontinental) dissemin-
ation; the four messages directed to the whole of North America, on the
other hand, ignored the questlon of internal diffusion and focused exclu-
sively on the need for     interna~ional   expansion.

North America and indicates the localities that are known to have had

Baha'i communities at the time the Tablets of the Divine Plan reached
American shores in 1919.      It is apparent that the Baha'i Faith was at
that time much more firmly established in some regions than in others
(see Table 2).    In the northeastern states, for example, almost all states
had at least one local Baha'i community.           In the central states the nlmmer
of Baha'is was relatively large, but they were concentrated in Illinois,
Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, and Minnesota, the remaining areas being
nearly bereft of believers.        The western    s~utes   exhibited a similar dis-
tributional dichotomy as in the central states; almost all the Baha'is
in the region concentrated in California and Washington while in the
other states there were few believers.           The remaining two regions--the
southern states and Canada--contained only a handful of believers in 1919.

The varying status of the Faith from one region to the next was
recognized by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and in his messages to the separate regions
he stressed the importance of proclaiming Baha'u'llah's message in those
areas unoccupied by Baha'is.        For the Northeast he urged believers to
focus their teaching efforts on unopened cities in the region;60 for the
central and western regions he directed them to depart from the areas of
Baha'i concentration and attempt to establish the Faith in the relatively
unoccupied states;61 in both the South and Canada he commented on the
extreme paucity of believers and encouraged diffusion throughout all
parts of both regions (in the case of Canada he placed particular impor-
tance on extending the ecumene to the Franklin Islands and Greenland--
perhaps the most remote areas in North America).62

Note: Star of the West contains a listing by name of 1120 North
American Baha'is who petitioned 'Abdu'l-Baha to visit them in 1919.   It
was assumed that their geographical distribution was representative of
the entire body of believers, and based on this assumption, percentage
distribution figures were calculated. The size of the United States
Baha'i population was estimated by taking the censal totals from the two
censuses of religions (1916 and 1926) and interpolating a value for 1919.
The estimated total number of United States Baha'is was then distributed
among the four regions in the United states according to the percentage
figures already derived.   The number of Baha'is in Canada was estimated
by assuming that the figure would equal one percent of the total Baha'i
population in North America.

Alaska vs. Greenland

A curious geographical aspect of the Tablets of the Divine Plan is
that the structure of the messages makes it apparent 'Abdu'l-Baha in-
tended that Greenland should be considered part of North America while
Alaska should not.     Since the Tablets of the Divine Plan are really only
concerned with the North American continent as an administrative entity
it is not important for the Baha'i political boundaries to coincide with
the actual physiographical limits of the continent.     Nevertheless,
'Abdu'l-Baha's perception of Alaska as being "foreign" or "overseas"
territory does mean that it was treated as an area that all North American
Baha'is must work to open to the Faith.     If Alaska had been included as
a part of one of the five North American regions, then the task of
teaching there would have been the prime responsibility of the believers
residing in the region to which it belonged--a situation that might have
inhibited the growth of the Faith in Alaska since the available Baha'i
resources   in a single region were, and always will be, inferior to the
resources wielded by the whole North American community.     This would
have been particularly so if Alaska, as might logically be expected, had
been designated as part of the Canadian region; at that time the whole of
Canada contained only about one percent of the total North American
Baha'i population.

Greenland, on the other hand, represents the opposite situation.        As
a colonial extension of Denmark, Greenland might reasonably have been
expected to fall into the "overseas" category in spite of its physio-
graphic links with North America.     'Abdu'l-Baha, however, designated it
as a part of the Canadian region, thereby placing prime responsibility

for its development on the shoulders of something less than two dozen
Baha'is residing in Montreal.

The six decades which have passed since the unveiling of the Tablets
of the Divine Plan have seen substantial Baha'i achievements in Alaska
but only modest growth in Greenland.   In 1957 Alaska was organized as an
independent National Spiritual Assembly area and by 1973 there were
170 localities with resident Baha'is, 30 of which contained sufficient
numbers of believers to permit the existence of local Spiritual Assemblies.
During a recent planning period (1964-1973) Alaska was the first National
Spiritual Assembly to achieve its assigned goals.   In contrast to this,
Greenland had only three localities with Baha'is in 1973 (all of which
were local Spiritual Assemblies), and has never been organized even as a
part of a National Spiritual Assembly area.

It is possible that the original administrative status assigned to
these two areas by the Tablets of the Divine Plan was at least par-
tially responsible for the amount of subsequent Baha'i growth.   One must
be careful not to draw too firm conclusions in this case, however, since
in the very early stages of diffusion it frequently happens that the
heroic activities of one dedicated individual establishes a basic pattern
of relative numerical strength which persists in later years, a state of
affairs to which 'Abdu'l-Baha gave latent recognition when he observed,

Diffusion at the Global Scale

In the four tablets that he addressed to the entire body of North
American believers, 'Abdu'l-Baha presented an imposing list of places to
which the Baha'is were to disseminate the Faith.      Figure 13 identifies
all the locations specifically mentioned by 'Abdu'l-Baha in his appeal.
The geographical distribution of these localities is such that there can
be no doubt about the scope of operations envisioned by 'Abdu'l-Baha--
diffusion was to be truly global in scale.      In fact, the identification
of target areas by 'Abdu'l-Baha was nearly always couched in language
that suggested he was' mentioning specific localities only to exemplify
the territorial breadth of the expansionist scheme he had in mind.       He
made frequent statements indicating that the Faith must be established
everywhere in the inhabited world;64 his list of localities merely
accentuates this theme.

An examination of Figure 13 reveals a more detailed tabulation of
territories in some parts of the world than in others.       In particular"
'Abdu'l-Baha was careful to list all significant political entities in
the Americas and Europe, most of the inhabited island groups in the
Pacific, and the majority of the political units then existing in South,
Central, and East Asia, but in contrast he made scant mention of
territories in Africa and the Near East.      There may be an explanation for
these regional differences in emphasis.       In the case of the Near East
and tJorth Africa it would be reasonable to think that 'Abdu'l-Baha may
have looked upon this predominantly Muslim zone as being most approachable

via the substantial Baha'i communities already there.    Iran, and to a
lesser extent Iraq, Turkey, Palestine, the Caucasus, and Egypt all
harbored Baha'i communities that had much more familiarity with the
religious, linguistic, and cultural character of the region than the
fledgling Baha'i communities of North America.    As for the remainder of
Africa, 'Abdu'l-Baha's failure to specify more localities within the
region may have been a consequence of the political organization of the
sub-Saharan part of the continent in the early part of the century.
During that time the region contained only two independent nations
(liberia and Ethiopia) and large portions of the interior were either
unknown or only sketchily explored by the West.    Perhaps the lack of
easily identifiable, independent countries discouraged 'Abdu'l-Baha from
articulating sub-Saharan Africa in his Tablets of the Divine Plan.

When considered in its entirety, the Tablets of the Divine Plan
represents an extraordinarily ambitious undertaking for the North American
Baha'is.   A community of something less than 2,500 believers 65 had been
given the task of spreading the Faith to all parts of the world.     Even
to send one Baha'i to each of the places specifically mentioned by
'Abdu'l-Baha would have required the relocation of about 7 percent of
the whole Baha'i population.   This figure becomes even more imposing

The Tablets as a Plan for Action
Weaknesses

There are many ways in which the Tablets of the Divine Plan fails

> successful plan is highly specific--specific about objectives, specific
> about time horizons, specific about methods of implementation.    The
Tablets of the Divine Plan is not.

> North American Baha'is during the subsequent decades), there is no clear
way of determining whether those objectives were achieved.    Generally,

'Abdu'l-Baha appealed to the North American Baha'is to go to the places
he mentioned and   procl~im   the Baha'i message.   If Baha'is followed this
directive and no local residents overtly responded to the message could
~~e   plan objectives be considered as accomplished?    The tone of the
Tablets of the Divine Plan is such that one is left with the distinct
impression that although awareness of the Baha'i Faith is a vast improve-
ment over ignorance, adoption of the Faith by local people is the real
intent of Baha'i diffusion efforts.      If conversion, then, is the real
objective, how many residents in a given territory must declare them-
selves as Baha'is before the planning objective of diffusing the Faith to
that territory can be considered to have been accomplished?       If, on the
other hand, it is incorrect to think that conversion was the underlying
goal in the Tablets of the Divine Plan then presumably all that 'Abdu'l-
Baha was AXgecting was proclamation of the Faith in each of the territories
mentioned.    But how does one know when proclamation has been sufficient to
fulfill the plan goal?   At one extreme, it is possible to envision a
situation in which a Baha'i who travels internationally as a part of his
employment succeeds in making passing mention of the Baha'i Faith in his
conversation while visiting one of the goal areas.      At another, one might
picture a Baha'i who moves to a goal area specifically to teach the Faith
and who constantly proclaims it through his behavior and regularly en-
courages adoption in discussions, speeches, and correspondence.       At what
level between these two extremes can successful proclamation of the
Faith in a goal area be considered to have occurred?       This conjecture
regarding what constitutes achievement of plan objectives is intended to
show the lack of specificity in the Tablets of the Divine Plan and the kind
of difficulty which arises when it is used as a plan for action.

The problem of plan implementation is exacerbated by the complete
lack of any reference to time horizons in 'Abdu'l-Baha's messages.      There
is a theme of urgency running through the whole of the Tablets of the
Divine Plan,66 but nowhere is mention made of any sort of deadline or
expected completion date.   Under these conditions successful execution
of the plan might proceed at whatever pace is convenient, regardless of
any notions of urgency.

The use of the Tablets of the Divine Plan as a planning instrument
is made even more difficult by the lack of any well-developed sense of
priorities.   There is no apparent commitment to staged diffusion whereby
the Faith is to be spread to certain critical territories first and to
less vital regions at a later time.   In the plan all territories are
billed as important.   'Abdu'l-Baha does identify a handful of key places
which, for a variety of reasons, he regards as being particularly
important,67 but he does not suggest that Baha'i energies should be con-
centrated on diffusing the Faith to those regions first.   Thus there is
no progression of events posited in the Tablets of the Divine Plan and

66The urgent need for Baha'i action is most clearly expressed by
'Abdu'l-Baha when he discusses World War I, suggesting that it fulfills
the biblical apocalyptic prophecies contained in Revelations and Daniel
and urging the believers to realizt that " . . . this is the time for the
diffusion of the fragrances."  'Abdu'l-Baha, Tablets of the Divine Plan,

67panama, Bahia (in Brazil), and Greenland definitely receive
special attention, but 'Abdu'l-Baha also appears to emphasize the impor-
tance of Alaska, Mexico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic (referred to as
Santo Domingo), South Africa, and the Franklin Islands of northern
Canada.  'Abdu'l-Baha, Tablets of the Divine Plan, pp. 10, 14, 25-26,
49, 53.

it is therefore difficult to evaluate the degree of completion achieved
by the plan at any given time.

Insofar as implementation is concerned, !Abdu'l-Baha did incor-
porate certain valuable directives.      Mention has already been made of the
spiritual qualities he identified as prerequisite to successful Baha'i
dissemination; one will also remember that he emphasized the importance
of linguistic adaptability, translated materials, and teacher training
"seminars."      Furthermore, he made it evident that the process of diffu-
sion was to occur through interpersonal contact; individual Baha'is were
to travel to target areas and establish contact with local residents.
Taken as a whole, these recommendations on how to implement the plan were
surprisingly comprehensive and pragmatic.      In fact, one would have to
conclude that it is in the area of plan implementation that the Tablets
of the Divine Plan are most specific and concrete.

Nevertheless, successful execution of the plan was hampered by the
almost total lack of an administrative structure through which activities
designed to fulfill plan objectives could be developed, promoted, and
guided.   In 1919 North America had no National or local Spiritual
Assemblies. 68    The Hands of the Cause appointed by Baha'u'llah all had
died and 'Abdu'l-Baha had not appointed a new contingent.     Continental
Counsellors were a thing of the future.      International teaching

68Neither the Baha'i Temple Unity nor the numerous local assemblies
existing in North America at that time had the formalized structure,
recognized authority, and defined functions that came to be associated
with Spiritual Assemblies during the period of Shoghi Effendi's guardian-
ship. Peter Ludwig Berger, "From Sect to Church: a Sociological
Interpretation of the Baha'i Movement" (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation,
the New School for Social Research, 1954), p. 171.

conferences had not yet been conceived.        In fact, at that time North
American Baha'is had no commitment whatsoever to institutionalized
administrative organs for the simple reason that none yet existed.           Under
these conditions it was necessary for the Tablets of the Divine Plan to
be received, reviewed, and implemented by the North American believers
as individuals.     Consequently, cooperative group reaction to the plan
was difficult.

Long-Term Influence

In spite of its weakness as a plan of action, the Tablets of the
Divine Plan exercised an immense influence on subsequent Baha'i diffusion.
In many ways this influence was not immediate, direct, or obvious, but
with sixty years of hindsight it is clear that 'Abdu'l-Baha's messages
granted legitimacy to, and even established a positive attitude toward,
the role of planning in Baha'i life.        The Tablets of the Divine Plan
made it clear that all Baha'is should orient their lives towards
promulgation of the Faith.        The entire North American community was
given a direction in which to move; it was as an indicator of this direc-
tion that    '~~d~l'l-Baha's   messages were to have their most enduring
impact.     The Tablets outlined a single, albeit extravagant, objective
from which the North American community gradually inherited a unity of
purpose.     This outlook spread to other Baha'i communities around the world
when Shoghi Effendi began to implement 'Abdu'l-Baha's plan for global
diffusion.

The role of Shoghi Effendi in implementing the Tablets of the
Divine Plan highlights their importance as a source of legitimacy for
ensuing planning efforts.        Shoghi Effendi treated the Tablets as a

mandate and initiated a series of Baha'i growth plans designed to achieve
the overall objective of global diffusion designated in the Tablets.     In
a letter to the American believers dated April 14, 1938, and written
nearly a year after the initiation of his First Seven Year Plan, Shoghi
Effendi made the following comment regarding the relationship between
his planning efforts and 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets:    " • . . The Seven Year
Plan, to which every American believer is fully and irrevocably pledgGd,
is in itself but an initial stage in the unfoldment of 'Abdu'l-Baha's
vision of America's spiritual destiny." 69   In other words, Shoghi Effendi
viewed the Tablets of the Divine Plan as a master plan and considered the
series of growth plans initiated by him (and continued after his death
by the Universal House of Justice) as nothing more than a mechanism by
which staged completion of 'Abdu'l-Baha's plan could be effected.

It should be pointed out that as a master plan 'Abdu'l-Baha's
Tablets perpetuate the three key elements of Baha'i expansionist policy
discussed earlier in this chapter.   Numerical increase, geographical
dispersion, and compositional diversity of the believers--these objectives
are inherently part of 'Abdu'l-Baha's messages.    Geographical dispersion
is explicit in the Tablets of the Divine Plan; numerical increase and
compositional diversity are treated as natural consequences of geograph-
ical dispersion. 70

> 69 Bah a'i News, 116 (June, 1938):1.

70 The objective of numerical increase and compositional diversity
may not be explicit in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, but that does not
make them any less real. Read, for instance, 'Abdu'l-Baha's discussion
of collective centers. 'Abdu'l-Baha, Tablets of the Divine Plan,

The Consequences of the Tablets
Slow Diffusion:   1919-1937

The North American believers had always been aware of their religious
obligation to assist the diffusion of the Faith.     Previous to 1919, how-
ever, the multitude of problems arising out of difficult communication
with 'Akka, the lack of a clearly defined administrative system, and
the dearth of adequately translated Baha'i literature combined to limit
geographic expansion.   A few Baha'is did labor to bring about dissemin-
ation of the Faith and in some instances the results were startling,71
but it was not until receipt of the Tablets of the Divine Plan that
North American Baha'is began to perceive themselves as a community with
the special spiritual mission of spreading the Faith worldwide.        Even
after the Tablets had been received, though, marked expansion did not
occur.   The Tablets were the fundamental planning document for North
American Baha'is for nearly two decades (1919-1937), but the quantity of
diffusion during the period was not substantial--at least     not compared
with the enormous objectives outlined in the plan.     Most of the growth
that did occur was confined to those areas where the Baha'is were
already well established:     the united States and Canada, Great Britain,
Genllany, and other European locales.    In all these regions, North

71prObably the most heroic international effort was that of Agnes
Alexander who developed a Baha'i community in Hawaii in 1902 and helped
establish the Faith in Japan in 1914. Agnes B. Alexander, Personal
Recollections of a Baha'i Life in the Hawaiian Islands (revised edition;
Honolulu: The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the Hawaiian
Islands, 1974), pp. 4-22; Japan will Turn Ablaze (Japan: Baha'i Pub-
lishing Trust, 1974), introduction and p. 1; The Baha'i World: 1968-
1973, XV, pp. 423-430.

American Baha'is were important agents of diffusion,72 but outside their
own national region their initiative must be viewed as     vital but sup-
portive.     Diffusion would not have occurred without the generating
impulses of American travel teachers, but neither would new believers have
been recruited and confirmed without the teaching and consolidation efforts
of local Baha'is.

Although the modest growth of the Faith was mostly confined to
entrenchment and reinforcement in those areas that were already a part
of the Baha'i ecumene, one exception stands out.     A preliminary network
of Baha'i communities developed in Australia and New Zealand where
previous to 1919 there were no believers.     This development in an
isolated and thinly populated part of the world was the work of John and
Clara Dunn, an elderly American couple who, in response to 'Abdu'l-
Baha's Tablets of the Divine Plan, moved to Australia in 1921 and began
to proclaim the Baha'i Faith. 73   For two years their efforts resulted in
no conversions, but after 1923 a number of people became Baha'is and
initiated a pattern of growth that by 1933 was expressed in the form of
five local Spiritual Assemblies and two localities with groups of
believers.     In 1923 the Dunns visited New Zealand and established the
Faith there.

In overall terms, however, measurable growth of the Baha'i Faith
was not much greater after the Tablets of the Divine Plan.     One

immediately suspects that the vagueness of the Tablets was responsible
for this, but close inspection of historical information suggests that
such a conclusion would be unwarranted.     There are two explanations of why
the Tablets did not stimulate an immediate and dramatic increase in the
number of Baha'i localities throughout the world:     (1) the potential
effectiveness of the Tablets was dampened by a set of events and trends
lying outside the control of 'Abdu'l-Baha's plan, and (2) a reliance on
statistics indicative of adoptive behavior and relocation, but not
capable of measuring increased awareness of the Faith among non-Baha'is,
resulted in an underestimation of the actual growth of the Faith.

The Leadership Crisis in 1921

Of those events which countermanded the    ;e~pansionary   thrust of
the Tablets, the most immediate was the death of 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1921
and the controversy which ensued regarding his appointment of Shoghi
Effendi as Guardian of the Faith.     'Abdu'l-Baha's will and testament is
unequivocal in language and not amenable to alternative interprztations,74
but the Baha'i comm'lnity apparently was caught off guard; no one ex-
pected the creation of such a powerful position of leadership within the
Faith and certainly no one anticipated the appointment of a 24-year old
youth as first Guardian. 7 5   At its core, the Baha'i Faith has always been

authoritarian, but during the years when 'Abdu'l-Baha oversaw the
formation and development of the North American community, the Baha'is
there, while greatly attracted by the liberal principles of the religion,
willingly declared their allegiance to this Christ-like son of Baha'u'llah
who exuded a magnetic personality.         With his passing, however, the
believers were suddenly, and without warning, required to accept a newly
created position of authority (Guardianship) and a virtually unknown
leader (Shoghi Effendi).          It was not long before Shoghi Effendi was able
to establish his claim to leadership, but during the earliest years of
his Guardianship challenges to his authority were widespread and
mu1 tl' t u d'lnous. 76   It is possible that these internal difficulties at
least temporarily diminished the intensity of community response to
'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets.

The Guardianship Postponed the Diffusion Process

This struggle over authority and allegiance, however, was a quickly
passing phase in the development of the Faith,77 and so it acted as a
hindrance to implementation of the         Tablet~   only for two or three years.
In the long run, it was Shoghi Effendi himself who delayen response to
'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets.

This is truly paradoxical since he was the greatest champion of
'Abdu'l-Baha's diffusionist cause that the Baha'i Faith has ever known.

Interpretation of the Baha'i Movement," pp. 113-114.

77Ibid., p. 114. The issue was resolved relatively quickly for most
of the believers, but apparently a small number of Baha'is--especial1y
family mernbers--continued to challenge Shoghi Effendi and, in doing so,
impaired his effectiveness. Rabbani, The Priceless Pearl, pp. 118-124.

Whereas 'Abdu'l-Baha had led the Faith in a highly personal fashion,
directly dealing with problems and issues as they arose, Shoghi Effendi
perceived an immediate need for an administrative structure by means of
which authority could be delegated and high-level decisions implemented.
The result was that he placed a high priority on creating local and
National Spiritual Assemblies in all those areas where Baha'is already
resided. 78    These Assemblies were, in turn, strongly encouraged to
appoint committees for a wide variety of tasks.          The Guardian felt that
one of his prime responsibilities was to arrange for the formation of
the Universal House of Justice, an administrative body that could come
into existence only after a network of National Spiritual Assemblies had
been established, and so from the beginning he directed Baha'i attention
to the task of establishing administrative units at the local and
national levels. 79         Judging from events during Shoghi Effendi's Guardian-
ship, it would seem that he believed that creation of a firmly grounded
administrative structure was a necessary prerequisite to implementation
of 'Abdu'l-Baha's grand design.          Herein lies the key to the paradox.
Shoghi Effendi was thoroughly committed to the implementation of 'Abdu'l-
Baha's Tablets, but he believed that a global teaching campaign could
be successfully undertaken only after an administrative system was in
place. 8 0    As a result, his ministry can be divided into two parts:         from

78 This emphasis is obvious in an early (1923) letter that Shoghi
Effendi wrote to the Baha'is in America, Great Britain, Germany, France,
Switzerland, Italy, Japan, and Australia. Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i
Administration, pp. 34-43, but esp. pp. 37, 39.

1921 to 1937 his principal objective was to develop an administrative
structure whereas from 1937 to 1957 he labored almost exclusively to
realize the grand expansionist vision of the Tablets of the Divine Plan.

Temple Construction Delayed Diffusion

There was one other development which may have impeded diffusion of
the Faith both before and after the appearance of the Tablets of the
Divine Plan.     In 1903 'Abdu'l-Baha indicated that a Baha'i temple should
be built in America. 81    This project placed an enormous financial respon-
sibility on the shoulders of the North American believers.      Baha'is from
overseas contributed money, but it was the American believers who absorbed

most of the cost.        Furthermore, much the larger part of the total
expenditure was paid after 1920 when the temple design was chosen;
previous to then, the only substantial outlay was for purchase of the
site.

The magnitude of the temple project was sufficiently great that it
must have been a considerable drain on the financial resources of the
North American Baha'is.      Since diffusion of the Faith required individual
believers to commit both time and money, it is reasonable to think that
construction of the temple exacted an opportunity cost in that some
believers may have had to decide whether to contribute to the temple fund

81For a brief history of the temple construction, see The Baha'i
Centenary: 1844-1944, pp. 122-137.

The total cost for land purchase, building construction and
ornamentation and landscaping exceeded 2.5 million dollars. Shoghi
Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World (Wilmette, Illinois: Baha'i
Publishing Trust, 1971), p. 149.

or support pioneering/travel teaching efforts. 8 3   At any rate, con-
struction of the temple was a second major objective for North American
Baha'is during the two decades following the appearance of the Tablets of
the Divine Plan, and as such it must have lessened the amount of diffusion
that would have occurred if the community had had to concern itself
exclusively with global dissemination.

But the temple cannot be viewed as having only a negative effect on
diffusion of the Faith.   'Abdu'l-Baha predicted that:

"When the foundation of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar [temple] is
> laid in America, • . . and that divine edifice is completed,
> a most wonderful and thrilling motion will appear in the world
> of existence . . . From that point of light the spirit of
> teaching, spreading the Cause of God and promoting the teachings
> of God, will permeate to all parts of the world. "84

Clinging to 'Abdu'l-Baha's promise, the American believers strived to
complete the temple so that global diffusion could progress more rapidly.
The North Americfu' believers came to view temple construction and Baha'i
expansion as inseparable, mutually supportive objectives.

It is curious that the need to complete the temple pushed the North
American community into adopting planning strategies.     In 1925 the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada issued a plan
designed to raise money for temple construction and increase the number of

83A message from the Guardian to the North American believers in
November, 1939, clearly de-emphasized the temple project and awarded a
higher priority to teaching activities. His statement shows that he
perceived temple construction and teaching as competing activiti.es; one
of which could be expanded only at the expense of the other. "The
Teaching Requirements of the Seven Year Plan," Baha'i News, 137 (July,
1940) : 3.

b e I ~evers ~n   Amer~ca.    Even though the principal objective was to
further construction of the telnple,86 the title given to the plan was:
A Plan of Unified Action to Spread the Baha'i Cause Throughout the
United States and Canada.       This (which, indeed, reflects the viewpoint
of the document) indicates the degree to which temple construction and
geographical diffusion had become bound together in the minds of the
believers.     The main objective outlined in the plan was to raise money
to complete construction of the superstructure of the temple, a goal
that was to be attained between January 1, 1926 and December 31, 1928.
Although the planning period had to be extended a few months, the finan-
cial objective eventually was attained and temple construction proceeded.
In 1931, a similar three year plan was instituted       to raise more money
to complete the temple. 8 7

These two plans are most intriguing since they set specific goals
that were to be achieved within a defined period.       Furthermore, these
goals were based on an analysis of available Baha'i       resources and were,
therefore, "realistic."       These Plans of Unified Action, although ver-
bally endorsed and financially assisted by the Guardian, apparently were
spontaneously developed by the American National Assembly in an effort

to carry forward with construction of the temple.   vllien, in 1937, Shoghi
Effendi initiated a series of teaching plans designed to spread the Faith
worldwide, he, unlike his grandfather but very much like the Plans of
Unified Action, established specific goals and time limits.    It could be
that the plans formulated to bring about completion of the temple favor-
ably impressed Shoghi Effendi and influenced the design of his growth
plans.

It can be concluded that temple construction may have hindered Baha'i
diffusion in the short run, but probably encouraged dissemination of the
Faith after the 1930s.

Awareness vs. Adoption as an Indication of Diffusion

Earlier it was suggested that part of the explanation of why Baha'i
growth was not more dramatic in the two decades following the appearance
of the Tablets of the Divine Plan is that available statistics regarding
diffusion of the Faith are inadequate for that time period.    In particular,
tabulations of the numbers of believers and their geographical dis-
tribution--the kinds of data available for this study--really only indicate
patterns of adoption or relocation.   They do not measure the level of
awareness of the innovation that is present in the population.    It should
be realized that when 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets reached America Baha'is were
not only absent in most of the world--the world was unaware of the
existence of the Baha'i Faith.   There is some reason to believe that
during the two decades following the appearance of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets
substantial diffusion occurred in the sense that large numbers of people
in many different parts of the world carne to know about the new religion.

Until 1937, most organized Baha'i activity aimed at dissemination
of the Faith involved public proclamation of Baha'i principles.    Typically,
a dedicated Baha'i would arrange a tour during which he or she would speak
to groups, societies, clubs, and the like, informing the audiences about
the character of the new Faith. SS   This method of dissemination, commonly
referred to by Baha'is as travel teaching, differs markedly from pioneering
which requires the settlement of a Baha'i in a new area where he or she
attempts to establish a network of personal relationships that can be
used to pass on information regarding the innovation.

Traditional diffusion research emphasizes the importance of mass
media in creating awareness of an innovation and personal contact in

88'Abdu'1-Baha's travel teac~ing in Europe and America provided a
model for Baha'is who wished to promulgate the Faith. His example was
followed by Martha Root, the person later designated by Shoghi Effendi
as " . . . that archetype of Baha'i itinerant teachers . . . " Largely as
a result of Shoghi Effendi's praise, Martha Root became the exemplary
travel teacher for Baha'is around the world. At the same time, the nature
of her activity indicates the character of travel teaching during the
interwar years. Here is Shoghi Effendi's summary of Martha Root's ac-
complishments:

"The first to arise, in the very year the Tablets of The Divine
> Plan were unveiled in the United states of America, in response to
> the epoch-making summons voiced in them by 'Abdu'l-Baha; embarking
> with unswerving resolve and a spirit of sublime detachment, on her
world journeys, carrying her four times around the globe, in the

> course of which she traveled four times to China and Japan and three
> times to India, visited every important city in South America, trans-
> mitted the message of the New Day to kings, queens, princes and

Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, pp. 386-387.

stimulating adoption. 89   Within the Baha'i Faith, travel teaching has
been the most commonly used method of creating awareness while pioneering
has been the traditional method of generating conversions.    Of course,
travel teaching is more personal, less formalized, and a far less
efficient means of distributing information about an innovation than such
traditional forms of mass media as newspapers, radio, and television.
But even so, travel teaching can legitimately be viewed as a form of mass
media since it attempts to reach relatively large numbers of people all
at once.   It often is as concerned with creating awareness as it is with
encouraging adoption, and it does not rely on personal relationships to
be effective.

The Baha'i. reliance on travel teaching to create awareness of the
Faith probably has occurred because of a number of advantages that com-
pensate for the inherent inefficiency of this method of information
dissemination.    First, the more standard forms of mass media are expen-
sive and yet do not permit easy identification of, and subsequent con-
tact with, those individuals who are attracted by the Baha'i message.
Travel teaching allows the substitution of labor for money and does make it
possible to readily detect which members of the audience are favorably
inclined toward the Faith.    Second, the format of travel teaching is
unusually flexible since it permits at least some amount of interaction
between the speaker and the audience.    The travel teacher, being in touch
with the audience, can make a presentation that appeals to the listeners'
interests and orientations and can answer questions and rectify mis-
understandings.    Finally, the reliance on public speaking usually means

89Rogers and Shoemaker, Communication of Innovations, pp. 208-209.

that travel teaching reaches groups of people who, simply by being in
attendance, have shown an interest in the innovation.

Previous to 1937, Baha'i expansionist efforts relied almost exclu-
sively on travel teaching, but after that time Shoghi Effendi's growth
plans placed increasing emphasis on pioneering. 90      The result may have
been that during the interwar years Baha'is were successful in gener-
ating awareness of the Faith but failed to precipitate any substantial
number of conversions in areas lying outside the Baha'i ecurnene; adoptions
in virgin areas seem to have awaited the systematic implementation of the
pioneering strategy.

Baha'i Growth Plans Since 1937
By 1937 Shoghi Effendi had successfully implemented an administra-
tive order that extended to all parts of the L:,h:o' 1. ecurnene.   At the time
of 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, National Spiritual Assemblies were non-
existent 9l and local Spiritual Assemblies were vague, amorphous bodies
with no clearly defined duties.    But during the following sixteen years
Shoghi Effendi formalized the function, form, and legitimacy of both.
In the early years of the Guardian's stewardship a number of believers
resisted, either actively or passively, the "institutionalization" of the

90Th i s is not intended to suggest that early Baha'is did not rely
on personal contacts to bring about conversions. The truth is just the
opposite. Conscious, cOliuuunity endeavor, however, did rely very heavily
on travel teaching to carry the Baha'i message to new territories.

9l I n North America, it is generally conceded that the Baha'i Temple
Unity gradua.lly evolved into a National Spiritual Assembly (see Shoghi
Effendi, God Passes By, p. 333) but elsewhere in the world National
Assemblies were simply created when the Guardian thought the time was
right.

Faith, but eventually Shoghi Effendi's innovations were accepted by the
body of believers so that by 1937 much of the administrative order that
presently defines the Faith was already in place. 9 2

In 1937 Shoghi Effendi organized and focused expansionary efforts by
instituting a Seven Year Plan for Baha'i growth.    In conformity with the
Tablets of the Divine Plan, which Shoghi Effendi used to legitimize the
Seven Year Plan,93 the American believers were charged with the respon-
sibility of accomplishing the designated objectives.    This initial plan was
closely followed by a sequence of plans--never more than two years sep-
arating one planning period from the next--covering the entire 41 years
from 1937 to the present.

Table 3 describes the series of plans that have directed Baha'i
diffusion over the past four decades.   It shows that the first plans,
covering the period 1937-1963, were designed by Shoghi Effendi, while the
last two, spanning the years 1963-1979, were developed by the newly formed
Universal House of Justice.   All the plans have relied for their execution
on the participation of America, but the total dependence in the first two
plans has given way to a sharing of responsibility by all national areas.

92 TwO dramatic changes in the administrative structure have occurred
during the intervening years. The Guardianship--which 'Abdu'l-Baha had
conceived of as an ongoing institution passed from generation to gener-
ation by each incumbent appointing his own successor--died with Shoghi
Effendi because he never made the necessary appointment, while the Univer-
sal House of Justi~e came into existence six years after his passing. The
formation of the Universal House of Justice had long been anticipated and
was, in fact, the ultimate objective behind Shoghi Effendi's efforts to
build the administrative order. The extinction of the Guardianship, how-
ever, was totally unexpected.

The Ten Year World Crusade was the first plan to spread responsibility
among all existing National Spiritual Assemblies, but as will be noted,
the distribution was such that the United States still carried the lion's
share of the burden.     The Universal House of Justice plans departed
markedly from this pattern of reliance on the United States.     Instead,
the amount of responsibility assigned to anyone national area appears to
have been based on an evaluation of manpower, resources, and historical
strength of the Faith.    All this is not apparent from Table 3 since it is
a brief summary of information about each plan and does not detail the
specific goals actually assigned to separate national areas (such informa-
tion may be obtained by referring to the documents used to compile
Table 3).

Although other overall goals occasionally assert themselves, there
are two key objectives that appear and reappear, plan after plan:        (1)
geographical and numerical expansion, and (2) consolidation of previous
achievements.   It is variations of these two themes that form the heart
of each of the plans.

One aspect of tlle plans which is not apparent from Table 3 is the
steady trend toward a broader range of goals.     This carne about gradually,
each succeeding plan widening the scope of the planning process by a
significant margin. 94    To some extent the process of diversification is
merely symptomatic of the expanding power base of the Faith, but, what-
ever the reason, it should be kept in mind that Baha'i plans are no
longer exclusively preoccupied with demographic and geographic expansion.

94 s ee, for example, Universal House of Justice, Analysis of the
Five Year International Teaching Plan, 1974-1979.

Growth plans still strongly emphasize numerical increase and territorial
dispersion, but increasing attention is being paid to a large number of
other kinds of goals that will insure the permanence and increase the
worldly influence of the religion.     In most instances these other goals
help spread the Faith, but do so less directly and in more subtle ways
than goals designed to expand the numbers and distribution of Baha'is.
The remainder of this study will forego detailed analysis of these other
goals in order to allow for a more thorough discussion of the con-
ceptually simple, easily measured, and historically continuous goals
associated with demographic growth and geographic expansion.

Shoghi Effendi's Plans
Shoghi Effendi's three plans contain an astute geographic strategy
for disseminating the Faith.     The Guardian designed the First Seven Year
Plan so that it would concentrate American energies on spreadir.g the
Faith throughout the Western hemisphere.     Initiated almost two years before
the outbreak of World War II, the Seven Year Plan spanned most of the
course of that global conflagration.     It managed to identify as a target
area that region of the war-torn world that remained relatively acces-
sible to the American Baha'is.     This happy coincidence of targeted areas
with war-free zones was not entirely a matter of chance, however.     As
early as 1931 the Guardian had foreseen the renewal of armed conflict in
Europe along with its associated worldwide reverberations. 95    In all

95Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, pp. 29-33. From
the text of the Guardian's discussion it is apparent that 'Abdu'l-Baha
had anticipated World War II as far back as 1920. Furthermore, Shoghi
Effendi suggests ~hat even Baha'u'llah had alluded to the incipient
global conflict.

probability, he designed the First Seven Year Plan with full realization
that war could break out at any time during the course of the planning
period.

The Guardian's Second Seven Year Plan emphasized consolidation and
expansion of Baha'i communities in the Western Hemisphere, and overseas
diffusion of the Faith to a number of western European nations.     By the
end of World War II there were some elements of the Baha'i Faith in most
countries of both western and eastern Europe    but typically this amounted
to nothing more than one or two localities with either an isolated
believer or a small group of Baha'is.    Only four countries had sub-
stantial numbers of Baha'i localities (Great Britain with 35, Germany with
19, Bulgaria with 8, and France with 5), and in the whole area there were
only five local Spiritual Assemblies--four in Great Britain and one in
France. 96   Obviously, the numbers of Baha'is were very small.   The
technological and political preeminence of Western Europe in global
affairs, however, made that region a key stepping-stone to ultimate
worldwide dissemination of the Faith.    Furthermore, Baha'i nuclei in the
area could, despite their small size, act as growth poles for the intended
expansion.

Like its predecessor, the Second Seven Year Plan placed the
responsibility for execution on the shoulders of the American community.
As Table 4 shows, however, this period (from 1946 to 1953) witnessed a
series of planning developments that complicated the diffusion pattern.
Drawing their inspiration from the Guardian's example, and in some

instances responding to specific appeals made by him, the various National
Spiritual Assemblies not directly involved in the activities of the Second
Seven Year Plan fashioned their own plans for consolidation and expansion.
Varying in their duration and differing as to their specific goals, these
national plans nevertheless had the general result of expanding the size
of the Baha'i communities and strengthening the administrative systems
in all of the then existent National Assembly areas.       This was important
because it improved their capacity to participate in the Ten Year World
Crusade which was soon to follow. 9 7

Although many of the National plans focused exclusively on internal
growth, there were a few exceptional efforts that undertook to spread the
Faith beyond National boundaries.       Particularly notable in this respect
was the National Assembly of India, Pakistan, and Burma which in its
4-1/2 Year Plan pledged to open Ceylon, Indonesia,98 and Siam.       Having
successfully fulfilled this objective by April, 1950, the Indian com-
Illunity embarked on an even more ambitious international project in their
Nineteen-Month Plan:   the reestablishment of pioneers in Siam and
Indonesia (apparently, the first pioneers were unable to stay) and the

97AS can be noted in Table 4, the Indian National Spiritual
Assembly was exceptional for having initiated its own growth plan as
early as 1938. In fact, by the end of Shoghi Effendi's Second Seven
Year Plan The National Assembly of the Indian subcontinent had formulated
and executed, with a large degree of success, three separate plans that
in total dramatically improved Baha'i representation in that part of the
world. None of the other National Assemblies initiated plans before the
end of the First Seven Year Plan.

1940-1944, p. 656) but perhaps by 1946 Indonesia was once again
unoccupied territory.

transmittal of pioneers to Malaya, Sarawak, Zanzibar, Madagascar, Nepal,
and Indochina.    All but the last of these goals were achieved.

Similarly, the Persian Plan, which ran from October, 1946, to July,
1950, successfully undertook to reinforce the tiny nuclei in Kabul
(Afghanistan), Mecca (Arabia), and Bahrein Island as well as to form new
groups in four different localities in the Arabian Peninsula.

Egypt's Three Year Plan pledged to open Tunisia,99 Algeria, and
Libya while Britain's Two Year Plan promised to form Bana'i groups in
three British dependencies in East or West Africa.      Even Canada's Five
Year Plan called for the opening up of Greenland and Newfoundland (New-
foundland did not join the Canadian confederation until 1949 and was not,
therefore, a part of the National Spiritual Assembly area at the be-
ginning of the planning period).     All of these various international
goals were achieved.

To make matters even more complicated, in 1950 the Guardian
inaugurated a Two Year African Plan.     That brief   unde~taking   integrated
Egypt's international goals (Three Year Plan) with the African objec-
tives that were eventually to surface in the British Two Year Plan and the
Indian Nineteen-Month Plan, and involved the united States and Persia as
well.     The whole project was to be administered by the British National
Assembly and was to open up territories in Africa.      The plan was par-
ticularly successful in Uganda where by 1953 there were 290 believers
in 25 different localities     (twelve local Spiritual Assemblies were forn,ed

a local Assembly there in 1943. The Baha'i World: 1940-1944, p. 658.

there before the end of the plan).lOO     Perhaps even more pertinent to
Africa-wide diffusion was the widely scattered network of    E~~a'i    nuclei
that the plan managed to stimulate in the various regions of North, East,
and West Africa.     Just as with Europe in 1944, the numbers of believers
were rather small.     Even so, they would prove to be the points of
attraction for spectacular growth during the upcoming Ten Year Crusade.

By the time the Second Seven Year Plan, the various national plans
for internal development, and the Two Year African Plan had run their
courses, the Baha'i Faith stood at a point in its development where
Shoghi Effendi felt justified in     launching a truly global campaign that
would, by the end of a decade, realize the vision originally expressed
by his grandfather some 35 years earlier.     The instrument which he
created for this endea\or--the Ten Year Plan--involved all twelve
existing National Assemblies and called for the expansion of the Faith
to most of the remaining untouched territories of any consequence.        In
all, the plan identified 131 areas to be opened.     The responsibility for
placing pioneers in these virgin territories was apportioned in such a
manner that the burden varied from a minimum of six goal areas for the
National Spiritual Assembly of Italy and Switzerland to a maximum of 29
for the National Spiritual Assembly of the united States.

The Ten Year Plan dispersed pioneers to the goal areas very early
in the planning period.     That way, as much time as possible would remain
before the end of the plan for the conversion of people to the Faith.
The desire was to establish a worldwide network of Baha'i communities by

100The Baha'i World: 1950-1954, XII (Wilmette, Illinois:      Baha'i
Publishing Trust, 1956), pp. 69-70.

1963\.     In fact, 1953, the first year of the plan, turned out to be
pivotal in Baha'i diffusion history since pioneers were dispersed before
its expiration to almost all goal areas.     By the spring of 1954 these
field agents were in place, the major objective of the Ten Year World
Crusade had been met, and the remaining nine years of the planning period
could be used to effect conversions.

Plans Designed by the Universal House of Justice
By the end of the Ten Year Crusade, almost six years after the
passing of Shoghi Effendi, the Faith had managed to establish a worldwide
distribution of its believers.     The bulk of the Baha'is were concentrated
in a few select areas--especially Iran and India, but also the United
States, Bolivia, Kenya, Uganda, the Belgian Congo, and Vietnam--while
many parts of the rest of the world were occupied by only a handful of
believers, but in spite of this uneven distribution of numbers the mere
presence of the Faith in virtually all inhabited areas of the planet
provided the potential for subsequent growth everywhere.

Thus, when the first Universal House of Justice was elected in 1963,
macroscale dissemination of the religion had nearly run its course and
future growth would necessarily involve a shift in emphasis to a process
of infilling and intensification.     The two plans which have been
developed by the Universal House of Justice have exhibited precisely this
sort of change in focus.     Both the Nine Year Plan and the Five Year Plan
have been most concerned with incceasing the numbers of Baha'i local
Spiritual Assemblies and organized groups in all those areas of the world
where initial penetration already had occurred.     It is true that the Nine
Year Plan designated 70 new territories to be opened up, but with the

exception of a few countries in Africa and national regions in Eastern
Europe, most of these goal areas were small islands or administrative
districts that, when considered together, encompassed only a tiny pro-
portion of the world's land area and population.    By the time the Five
Year Plan had been formulated, unopened territories were either so scarce
or so inaccessible (due to political conditions) that only ten new areas
were targeted for penetration.

Perhaps the simplest way to see the shift in emphasis from
organizing new territories to strengthening established national com-
munities is to look at the number of new National Spiritual Assemblies
called for by each of the plans (see Table 5).

It is obvious that the formation of new National Spiritual Assemblies
proceeded most rapidly during the twenty years spanned by the Ten Year
World Crusade and the Nine Year Plan.    Those two plans called for the
creation of large numbers of National Spiritual Assemblies (in each case
the goal was exceeded).    In comparison, the more recent Five Year Plan
proposed a much more modest rate of growth in the   n~ber   of National
Assemblies, and in fact even much of that expansion was to be achieved by
subdividing existing National Assemblies (of the 16 new National
Assemblies to be formed, only four were to be created out of previously
unorganized territory:    Burundi, the Bahamas, Cyprus, and Greece).

Even the large number of National Assemblies targeted for creation
during the Nine Year Plan could only have been selected as goal areas
because of promising signs of Baha'i growth that manifested themselves
during the preceding Ten Year Crusade.    A National AsseITbly cannot exist
until there is a network of local Assemblies present, and so the

a Thi s decline in the number of National Spiritual Assemblies
was the result of religious persecution in the Caucasus and Turkestan
where National bodies were dissolved.

appearance of a new National body is necessarily somewhat later than
initial penetration of the region by the Faith.   This being so, it is
apparent that the absorption of new territories into the Baha'i ecumene
reached its zenith during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi ana had
exhausted most of its options by the time the Nine Year Plan was
formulated.

The two plans designed by the Universal House of Justice continued
to make extensive use of pioneering as a mechanism to diffuse the Faith,
but the role of the pioneer was altered by the changed conditions.
Whereas a pioneer during the time of Shoghi Effendi's plans usually was
the only Baha'i resident in a country, his contemporary counterpart,
although the religion's single representative in a certain locality, is
likely to be in a region that is already organized as a National Spiritual
Assembly area and already has at least a minimal network of local
Spiritual Assemblies, qroups, and isolated believers.     Today's pioneer,
therefore, although still somewhat isolated, has access to nearby Baha'i
resources that can on occasion be used to assist him in the task of
encouraging conversions.

The intended function of pioneering as an institution has remained
the same, however.   It persists because it is a mechanism for encouraging
growth in those areas that have relatively few Baha'is.     It facilities
balanced Baha'i growth by effecting the spatial reallocation of manpower
from "developed" to "developing" regions.    It decentralizes Baha'i
resources.    It continues to be, therefore, an expression of the long-
standing Baha'i policy of dispersion.

A Final Note Regarding Planning
The systematic planning of growth has been a relatively recent
development in Baha'i history.     The Faith is now in its l36th year, and
yet the notion of planned expansion has been part of the Baha'i outlook
for only 60 years, while the regular development and implementation of
well articulated plans has been characteristic of the Baha'i Faith for
only 42 years.

The brief time during which planning has been used as a tool for
dissemination of the Faith should not be allowed to obscure the fact,
established earlier on in this chapter, that the religion has, throughout
its history, adhered to a clearly defined and relatively unchanging
expansionist policy.     Baha'i planning should be viewed as nothing more
than a recent expression of that enduring policy.        There is no way that
contemporary dependence on planning can be interpreted as a sign of
increasing Baha'i commitment to the notions of numerical increase,
geographical dispersion, and compositional diversity; these elements of
Baha'i policy have been present from the very beginning.

The fact that an expansionist policy and all that it entails is
rooted in the sacred writings of the cofounders of the Faith means that
the recently developed Baha'i growth plans, since they are designed to
insure the execution of policy, are endowed with enormous theological
import and exercise a powerful influence on the minds and actions of the
believers.   Even the planning tool has unqualified support since it was
first used by 'Abdu'l-Baha, the divinely appointed infallible interpreter
of the sacred word of God.

Although the influence of the Baha'i Faith has expanded steadily
since its birth, exhibiting no significant periods of noticeable con-
traction,IOI growth has been roost impressive during the era of carefully
planned expansion.   The question, of course, arises as to whether the
recent acceleration in growth has been a consequence of planning or is
merely coincident with it and is actually the outcome of changing world
conditions that have revolutionized the technology of transportation
and communication, lowered the cultural and political barriers separating
countries and regions, and modified the beliefs and values of humanity
to the point where the Baha'i message is more acceptable.   A modified
form of this question will be considered in a later chapter when the
effectiveness of planning is statistically evaluated.

10lDramatic declines in the fortunes of the Faith have tended to be
regional rather than global, and when they have occurred they seem to
have been offset by developments in some other area that in the long run
proved to be even more beneficial to the Faith than the setback was
detrimental. For example, the near annihilation of the Babis in Persia
during the l850s was counterbalanced by Baha'u'llah's banishment to Iraq,
a development that permitted the realization of the Baha'i dispensation
and was the first in a sequence of steps leading to the firm establish-
ment of the Faith in numerous regions outside its area of origin. In a
similar vein, suppression of the large, wealthy, and firmly established
Baha'i communities in the Caucasus and Turkestan following the Russian
Revolution coincided with the contrasting developments stimulated by the
Tablets of the Divine Plan, in particular the opening up of Australia and
New Zealand, the initial settlement of South Africa, and the extensive
forays of the indefatigable Martha Root, first into South America and then
over the next two decades, into all the other continents of the world.

CHAPTER VII
DIFFUSION IN THE UNITED STATES:    POPULATION GROWTH

GENERAL COMMENTS

Material available for the study of Baha'i diffusion is of two main
types:   (1) demographic data indicating the time of adoption, residen-
tial location, and personal characteristics of individual adopters, and
(2) information regarding the location and time of formation of in-
dividual administrative bodies (i.e., local Spiritual   Ass~blies).     The
data dealing with population are extensive and broad in scope, but some-
what fragmentary and in some instances inconclusive or   contradicto~y;

the data regarding local Spiritual Assemblies are precise, accurate,
standardized in format, and complete, but lack sufficient substance to
permit detailed analysis.   Since the demographic data were available
only for the United States Baha'i community, the decision was made to
study the United States using the individual believer as the unit of
analysis and to resort to the local Spiritual Assembly as a unit of
analysis in a later chapter when the focus is on global dissemination.

For the purposes of this study, the United States is defined as the
48 contiguous United States.   Alaska, Hawaii, and the United States
possessions and territories are excluded because they are not part of
the current United States National Spiritual Assembly area.

GROWTH
The First Seeds
Although public mention of the Baha'i Faith was made at the World
Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893, the first Baha'i in America

was the Syrian doctor Ibrahim Khayr'u'llah who arrived in Chicago in
1894\.    Most of the conversions to the religion which occurred during the
following four years were the result of his work; he was the de facto
leader of the American Baha'is before 1898.

It is possible to obtain an accurate picture of the rate of growth
of the Faith during this earliest period because a believer named Mary
Lesch kept a log in which she entered the names of all people who became
Baha'is during each of those years (she also recorded the place of
residence of each new believer, but that information will be discussed
in the next chapter).       Her tabulations indicate the pattern of adoption
shown in Table 6.

This information should be reasonably accurate.   Mary Lesch her-
self became a believer in 1897, and so she would have been in a position
to keep abreast of new declarations during the later years when they
became more numerous.     Until her declaration, most Baha'is lived near
her in the Chicago area, and so in order to tabulate the declarants who
preceded her she would only have had to ask them where and when they
became Baha'is.     It would seem most likely that, if anything, Mary
Lesch's list might be marred by consistent undernumeration, a bias which
would tend to compensate for the fact that the figures on total population
size ignore the possible attrition through death, disaffection, and
emigration.

There is one possible source of a more critical bias in Mary Lesch's
roll.     Her log books list 580 names for the year 1899, but then all
entries cease.     There is no way of knowing whether she stopped making
entries at the end of 1899 or at some other time during that year.       It is
possible, therefore, that her tabulation for 1899 is seriously incomplete.

In spite of all the potential inaccuracies in the data source,
however, it is reasonably certain that the 1,437 people tabulated by Mary
Lesch did indeed become Baha'is.     This suggests that early expansion was
very rapid.     The annual rates of growth were astronomical, ranging from
a low of 68 percent to a high of 543 percent.     Of course, the very small
population base, especially during the first few years, facilitated high
growth rates, but it should be pointed out that the growth in the absolute
numbers of Baha'is during the period 1897-1899 probably was higher than
for any other three-year period before 1965.     In a historical perspective,
therefore, initial growth was extremely rapid.

Long-Term Growth Trends
The Overall Pattern

After this first burst, the Baha'i population underwent two separate
periods of decline before settling into a pattern of steady increase.
Figure 14 shows the relative size of the Baha'i population at nearly
regular intervals.    Even though the points of reference are between six
and ten years apart, it is clear that the growth rate has not been con-·
stant.   If censal data were available for the intermediate years they
might reveal even more pronounced and more numerous fluctuations in the
rate of population growth.

It is apparent from Figure 14 that between 1894 and 1926 at least
two distinct peaks occurred in the size of membership.       Although 1900
and 1916 are identified as the zenithal years for membership while 1906
and 1926 are pegged as the nadirs, the unavailability of data for any
other years during this time span makes it impossible to assess whether
those years are the extremes.    In all likelihood they are not.

The growth rate showed a tendency to gradually diminish between
1926 and 1964, but became extremely high after that time.       To some
extent, the unusually low growth rate during the 1957-1964 period was a
result of a change in enumeration procedures.       During those years the
Office of Membership and Records at the Baha'i National Center became
aware of a growing need to differentiate between adult Baha'is who main-
tain an attachment to the Faith and those Baha'is who either cannot or do
not participate in the social, spiritual, and administrative a< ::ivities
which engender group cohesiveness.    During the 1950s, the Membership and
Records Office began to compile their membership statistics in such a

manner as to differentiate between adult Baha'is and Baha'i youth (aged
15 to 20) while at the same time breaking down those two groups into
two subsets:     (1) those for whom addresses are known and (2) those fer
whom addresses are unknown or from whom mail has been returned.     For all
years up through 1957, Figure 14 is based on membership statistics that
include both adults and youth and that count all Baha'is regardless of
their whereabouts.     For 1964, 1970, and 1976, however, only adult Baha'is
with a known place of residence are included.     Figure 14 contains a light
lin£ that indicates how the curve would appear if all four classes of
Baha'is are included in the 1964, 1970, and 1976 statistics--as they were
for previous years--and the marked depression of the 1957-1964 growth
rate is no longer apparent.

For the purpose of this study, emphasis will be placed on adult
Baha'is with known residence since that group is more likely to be a
realistic indicator of Baha'i strength.     Previous to the 1950s, the
numbers of youth and "mail-return" Baha'is were so small as to be almost
insignificant.    In more recent times, however, their numerical impor-
tance has increased dramatically, coming to represent a substantial
proportion of the total Baha'i population.     This is problematic since
youth status and mail-return status represent two totally different
forces in Baha'i growth; the former will contriiJute to Baha'i expansion
in the immediate future whereas the latter may be a form of attrition.
This problem, however, will be held in abeyance until a systematic effort
is made to analyze growth dynamics.     For now the concern will be with
overall growth as portrayed by the number of adult Baha'is in known

Declining Growth Between 1926 and 1964

Why should Baha'i growth taper off between 1926 and 1964 and then
accelerate dramatically?     There are three possible explanations for the
gradual diminution of the growth rate in the earlier years.       First, the
increasing population base heightened the difficulty of maintaining a
steady growth rate since it required a larger number of new converts each
year.     It is true that the number of potential change agents was also
increasing at the same pace, but as the years went by a larger and larger
number of all the adherents were either very new to the Faith, which may
have impaired their effectiveness, or very elderly, which may have
decreased their level of activity.l

Second, the period in question is coincident with the era when
Shoghi Effendi was formulating and codifying the administrative order,
a development that made the decision to adopt the Baha'i Faith an
increasingly demanding commitment.     ~~ereas   in 'Abdu'l-Baha's day one
could become a Baha'i and still remain a member of some other religious
group, by 1964 this was no longer acceptable.      Similarly, in the time of
'Abdu'l-Baha the only real requirement for becoming a Baha'i was a belief
that Baha'u'llah is the Manifestation of God for this day, but by the time
of Shoghi Effendi's death the religion required that the new adopter also
obey a host of societal laws governing personal behavior.      Even the

IThis is not to suggest that new (or for that matter, elderly)
Baha'is are always less effective change agents. On the contrary, numerous
individual examples contradict this sort of blanket statement.  Neverthe-
less, all other things being equal, a Baha'i of many years has had more
opportunity to become familiar w~th the multitudinous Baha'i writings
and conform his behavior to the patterns which they recommend.

administrative order itself is an aspect of the religion that the new
adopter was obliged to accept only in the latter years. 2    All these
transformations in the nature of the religion made it more independent and
increased its influence over many aspects of an individual believer's
daily life, but at the same time they made adoption a more serious
decision.   The change in the importance of the adoption decision can be
grasped more readily if it is described metaphorically:      In the early
days you could become a member of the Baha'i Faith by professing your
love for it; by 1964 you had to marry it.

A third reason for the gradual decline in the growth rate of the
United States population may be that from 1937 onward the American
Baha'is were heavily committed to the execution of a sequence of inter-
national plans, each of which was more ambitious than its predecessor.
This increasing cowmitment to overseas activity may have been a drain
on the resources and manpower available for generating domestic     gro~lth.

Accelerating Growth after 1964

Turning now to the   p~enomenal   increase in the growth rate which
occurred after 1964, the most plausible explanation is associated with
conditions lying outside the purview of the Faith.      The decade of the
1960s was a time in which traditional religion in America (especially the
Judaeo-Christian establishment) was tried and found lacking. 3     Religion

2Bot h the societal laws and the administrative order have their
roots in Baha'u'llah's writings.   In America before the 1920s, however,
these aspects of the religion were not yet enunciated.

wanting in the sixties . . . . " Sidney E. Ahlstrom, A Religious History
of the American People (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972), p. 1085.

has always taken a multitude of forms in the United states, but until
the 1960s, traditional Christian orthodoxy was the norm.   During that
decade, however, there was a revolution in the American attitude toward
religion--a revolution that dethroned conservative theology, confirmed
the legitimacy of a bewildering variety of religious and quasi-religious
forms, and perpetrated a new morality that simultaneously uprooted
hypocrisies in the old conventional moral code and planted new behavioral
modes that, although often more honest than their precursors, heralded
an unprecedented level of permissiveness.   Simply put, the sixties was
a time in which the American people turned their backs on traditional
Christianity and sought religious fulfillment either in unorthodox
Christian forms or in non-Christian traditions. 4

Ahlstrom asks why this revolution in American religious life should
have occurred when it did, and in the process of posing the question he
defines in colorful language the pervasiveness of the change.

Ahlstrom goes on to explain why he thinks the bombs were dropped, but to
pursue this would draw the discussion too far away from its main thrust.
The point is that a religious revolution did occur, it was serious in
its implications, and it can be said to have happened during the sixties.
In fact, as Ahlstrom intimates and Marty clearly states,6 the revolution
reached its zenith in the latter part of the decade.

Like many other movements of non-Western origin, the Baha'i Faith
benefited from this disillusionment with traditional religion and the
resultant openness to new religious forms.   It should be remembered that
the Baha'i movement, which only claims the allegiance of a microscopic
proportion of the total population, could experience an absurdly high
growth rate even if only a very few of the disillusioned (who numbered
in the millions) turned to it for answers.

exercise is nothing more than an elaboration of the analysis of long-term
growth trends.     The shift to a finer temporal scale, however, reveals
certain aspects of Baha'i growth which are not apparent in the cruder,
more sweeping survey of the full 84 years of Baha'i expansion in
America.     Figure 15 shows the growth of the Faith between April, 1956,
and April, 1976.     With a few exceptions which can be identified by care-
ful study of the figure, population sizes have been plotted for one year
intervals.     The two instances in which the time intervals are longer
(April, 1968 through April, 1970, and November, 1971 through August,
1973) were occasioned by a lack of available data.     These unavoidable
gaps detract slightly from the consistency of the presentation, but they
are offset by the availability of more frequent membership counts for the
period of extremely rapid growth which occurred between them.

The previous section discussed the difference between the total Baha'i
population end the more conservative indicator of population size that
excludes youth and those whose whereabouts is unknown.     Figure 15 plots
these categories so that one can see the relative size of each group.
The three components of the total Baha'i population are plotted for
1956 and for 1965-1976.     If they are summed for anyone year, they
equal the total Baha'i population.

Mail-Return Baha'is

As can be seen by looking at the information for 1956, it is only
in the recent past that mail-return Baha'is have become a significant
element in the total population, while Baha'i youth remained numerically
unimportant until well into the 1960s.     The recent rise of these two groups
coincides with the rapid increase of the total Baha'i population.

There is a tendency for the numbers of mail-return Baha'is to
increase as the total population grows.     This would not be surprising
were it not for the fact that such a relationship did not exist before
1956\.     Although data are not available for the period 1956-65, it is
known that by the end of that time mail-return Baha'is had become a
substantial part (36%) of the total Baha'i population.     During the late
1960s, they diminished in importance, but subsequently their numbers
rose rapidly, so that by 1976 they were about 31 percent of all Baha'is.

Mail-return Baha'is are by definition those adherents for whom
information on place of residence is either missing or inaccurate. 7
They are important to the administrative order of the Faith since they
are a segment of the Baha'i population that almost certainly will not be
participating in organized community activities.     There is little
likelihood that mail-return Baha'is will be contributing, either
financially or personally, to the execution of the current growth plan.
They may be disseminating the religion, but not within the context of
the prevailing plan objectives.

Furthermore, an unknown number of mail-returns probably are not
the result of an incorrect address but rather of a conscious decision on
the part of the adressee to return Baha'i mail--a behavior which could
indicate disaffection.

There is no way of measuring the level of commitment of mail-return
Baha'is, but it does seem likely that a substantial number have become

between the "mail-return" and "unknown address" categories, keeping
statistics on each. For the purpose of this discussion I have lumped
the two groups together.

disinterested while a small portion have actually become disaffected.
There is a great difference between disinterest and disaffection, how-
ever, for the former may be a temporary stage in the life experience
whereas the latter is likely to be a permanent attitudinal state arrived
at consciously.     Furthermore, their implications for diffusion differ.
A prevalence of disinterest can retard Baha'i diffusion by sapping the
vitality of the movement from within whereas disaffection can be a
source of direct opposition to the Faith from outside.

Baha'i Youth

In 1956, the youth comprised only 3.3 percent of the Baha'i
population.    This figure can be judged by comparing it to the comparable
number for the United States' population in 1950:     8.5 percent.   By
1965 the Baha'i youth component had risen to the still modest level of
7\.5 percent.    Then, during the period of extremely rapid expansion that
occurred in the late 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s the growth
rate for youth greatly outstripped that for the total Baha'i population,
so that by November, 1971, over one-quarter of all Baha'is were aged
15 to 20.     Between November, 1971, and August, 1973, however, the youth
boom reached its apex and then lapsed into an absolute decline; by 1976
those in the 15 to 20 age category were only 8.1 percent of the Baha'i
membership.

The recent decline is misleading.     One must remember that anyone
who is classified as a youth will in the near future pass on to the
adult category.     Since the rapid influx of youth was occasioned almost
entirely by conversions (and was not simply the corning of age of
children of Baha'i families) any slackening in the rate of adoption is

likely to result in an absolute decline a few years hence in the numbers
of Baha'i youth.     The rapid drop in the size of the youth population
between August, 1973, and April, 1976, was not caused by disassociation
from the Faith.    Rather, it was the result of aging.          This is verified
by the fact that of all the Baha'is in the 15-20 age group (including
those in the mail-return category) in April, 1975, over one-third became
adult Baha'is before the expiration of a single year.            This also
indicates a concentration of Baha'i youth near the older end of the
15-20 age category, confirming the previously stated contention that
most Baha'i youth are adopters and not children of Baha'i families.

One might contend, incidentally, that the recent rise in the number
of mail-return Baha'is may be a reflection of a new itinerant youth
element in the Baha'i population that adopted the religion but then lost
interest.   There may be some truth to this, since in 1975 youth comprised
12 percent of all Baha'is in the mail-return category.            This may not
seem a large percentage, but considering how rapidly youth became adults,
the figure is substantial.      Furthermore, the trajectories of the population
change lines for youth and mail-return Baha'is in Figure 15 are almost
mirror images from August, 1973, onwards, leading one to suspect direct
transfers from the youth to the mail-return category.            This notion
cannot be confirmed, however, without more information regarding either
(1) the age structure of the mail-return population or (2) changes in
the ratio of adults to youth in the      mail-retu~n   group.

The large number of youth enrolled in the late 1960s and early
1970s br0ught about a profound change in the age structure of the entire
Baha'i population.     h~ile   youth may move rapidly to the adult category,

this does not immediately alter the fact that the total population has
taken on a relatively youthful complexion.    In earlier times the age
structure of the Baha'i population was strongly biased toward the older
age groups, but the youthful character of recent growth has changed that.

Some idea of the age structure of new converts during the high
growth era can be obtained from a statistical compilation that was
prepared by the Department of Personnel and Administrative Services in
February, 1969.   Between January 8 and February 5, 1969, 193 new Baha'is
enrolled in the United States, and 160 of them completed and returned
questionnaires which, among other things, solicited information regarding
age.   Table 7 shows the age structure of the new enrollees and compares
it with that of the population of the United States.

The youthfulness of the new Baha'is is remarkable, and even though
a one-month survey may not be a perfect measure of the age character-
istics of all the Baha'is who enlisted during the high-growth period,
it is probably a reasonable indicator.   When one considers that the
Baha'i population tripled in size between 1969 and 1973, one begins to
appreciate the extent to which the age structure of new enrollees
transformed the age structure of the total population during that period.

The massive injection of youth had a number of important implica-
tions for later growth.   First, it meant that the religion had a new
capacity for appealing 'co young people in society.    It is obvious that
during the late sixties and early seventies some young people in America
became interested in the Baha'i Faith, but this occurred despite a
general absence of young Baha'is from whom they could learn about the
religion.    After the influx of youth, the Faith could use this new

resource to gain access to the social and economic niches predominantly
occupied by young people and could avoid having to appeal to the young
across a generation gap.

A second major implication of the Baha'i movement's demographic
rejuvenation is the unprecedented flexibility suddenly incorporated
into the pool of human resources available.       When a middle-aged or
elderly person joins    ~he   Faith he typically brings along a family, a
home, an established occupation, and a host of       ~eeply   ingrained behavior
patterns that are incompatible with Baha'i teachings.         By contrast, a
young person is relatively free of these encumbrances and is in a much
better position to pattern his life after the Baha'i model and to plan
a future around the goal of serving the Faith.

Two demographic advantages also accrue from enrolling relatively
young people.   First, the average remaining life expectancy increases,
which has the dual benefit of suppressing attrition through mortality
and increasing the number of years that an individual believer can work
as a change agent for Baha'i diffusion.    Second, the enrollment of large
numbers of unmarried people greatly improves the likelihood of marriages
in which both partners are Baha'is, and that would naturally lead to the
creation of families with children brought up in the Baha'i spiritual
environment.

The tendency for younger people to adopt the Faith may be attributed
at least in part to the wave of anti-Establishment sentiment which swept
the nation during the 1960s.   The   social and ideological dislocation
of that time was initiated largely through the efforts of a discontented
and disillusioned American youth.    Their concerns rapidly became the
concerns of the whole nation, but they were the first and the most
fervent advocates of change.   They, therefore, were the ones who in
largest numbers sought alternatives to traditional American ideals and
religions, and in so doing, frequently discovered the Baha'i Faith.

But youth enrollment was not something that simply happened to the
Baha'i Faith as a consequence of social revolution in America.    During
the early sixties the Baha'i community of the United States began to
realize that it was attracting younger people than had been the case in
earlier decades.   In June, 1966, the Universal House of Justice released
a letter to the Baha'i youth 8 in every land calling upon them to serve

8Although for administrative purposes the Faith has specific age
thresholds that distinguish between youth and adult status, in all other

the Faith in truee ways:   (1) by studying Baha'i teachings, spiritual-
izing their lives, and forming their characters in accordance with
Baha'i standards, (2) by teaching the Faith to their fellow youth, and
(3) by acquiring knowledge and skills that will insure their self-
sufficiency and allow them to serve humanity.   The letter went on to
encourage youth involvement in all aspects of Baha'i life; special
emphasis was placed on the importance of contributing to the achievement
cf the goals outlined in the Nine Year Plan (1964-1973).9     This message
from the Universal House of Justice stimulated vigorous youth activity
in the United States.   In June, 1968, the first in a series of national
youth conferences was held in Wilmette, Illinois.   Attended by over five
hundred Baha'i youth from 34 states, Washington, D.C., and Canada, the
conference was called primarily to promote expansion and consolidation
of the Faith.   The outcome was a five-year program designed to involve
young Baha'is in achieving the goals of the Nine Year Plan.     The program,
which in a sense could be considered a youth plan for America, had a
number of objectives.   Those most directly relevant to diffusion included:
(1) deployment of 500 youth to homefront and foreign goal areas specified
in the Nine Year Plan (350 of these were to be settled in the southern
states where the Baha'i Faith was at that time under-represented), (2)
doubling the number of Baha'i College Clubs from 61 to 122, (3) estab-
lishing 20 high school clubs, and (4) implementing a travelling-teacher
ways there is careful avoidance of drawing a line between these two groups.
Consequently, this and the many other messages transmitted to the Baha'is
by administrative bodies, are not intended for consumption just by those
aged 15-20, but rather are meant to be read by anyone who feels young.

This sudden focus on youth activity may have been stimulated in
part by the rising tide of youth enrollments that occurred in the early
sixties.   The Baha'i community, perceiving this new resource, was eager
to have it serve the Faith.    The religion was not just reacting to a
new condition, however, for at the time of the letter from the Universal
House of Justice the proportion of all American Baha'is aged 15-20 was
still substantially lower than the average for the entire country
(approximately 10% vs. 14%).     One can conclude, therefore, that the very
high enrollments of young people in 1970 and 1971 was brought about by a
combination of social conditions outside the Faith and growth priorities
adopted by the religion.

Growth of the Total Population

The earlier analysis of growth trends throughout the full history
of the Baha'i presence in North America detected rapidly accelerating
growth in the late sixties and early seventies and explained it as being
the result of social upheaval.     Now, however, with   ~he   information avail-
able in Figure 15, it becomes apparent that the recent upward swing in
the growth rate has not been smooth and regular and that the most
spectacular expansion occurred after the turbulent sixties had run their
course.    To be sure, Baha'i membership grew at a rapid rate between 1960

10Details of this first National Youth Conference and the youth
plan that it spawned are given in The Baha'i World: 1968-1973, XV,

and 1970 (on the average, over 15% per year), but year to year fluctua-
tions in the rate were great during that period, and, even more to the
point, the rates of the 1960s were dwarfed by those that prevailed at
the start of the 1970s.    The original explanation, therefore, is not
entirely adequate.

Once again it becomes necessary to look within the Baha'i Faith
for an explanation of its own growth.      The era of rapid increase
corresponded with the Nine Year Plan which ran from April, 1964 to
April, 1973.   Immediately preceding and following this plan there were
one-year periods during which no plan was in force.      These interplan
periods were thnes of little or no growth.      The 1963-1964 year actually
witnessed a slight decline in membership, the only time during the two
decades covered by Figure 15 when this occurred.      The 1973-1974 year did
see some expansion, but the annual rate was lower then than at any other
time since 1958 (except for the absolute decline of 1963-1964).         The
decline in membership during the 1963-1964 period probably was caused
by the administrative separation of Hawaii from the United States--an
event which stripped the   u.s.   Baha'i population of a certain small
proportion of its members.     However, the slow growth during the 1973-1974
year may be a sign that planning stimulates growth whereas lack of
planning does not.   The Nine Year Plan witnessed consistently high growth
rates, but the question is, what happened between April, 1970     ~nc

November, 1971?   How does one account for the spectacular growth which
occurred during that period?      First it should be noted that the increase
at that time was largely a product of activity in the South.      Secondly,
it should be recognized that the large number of southern enrollments

was the result of a concerted drive on the part of Baha'is.   The
following statement from the most recent volume of The Baha'i World
summarizes events and shows the regionality of Baha'i growth during that
period.

To give some idea of the magnitude of this movement, South Carolina--the
state that experienced 8,000 enrollments in six weeks--had 132 resident
Baha'is on January 13, 1968.   The South as a whole, which in December,
1969, was the horne of only 18 percent of all American Baha'is, doubled
its membership in well under a year and by December of 1970 had in-
creased its proportionate share of the total to 32 percent.

The Dynamics of Growth
The population dynamics of a religious movement are more complex
than those of a population to which egress and ingress are possible only

is an annual 12-day feast (April 21 - May 3) celebrating the declaration

told by the Bab.

by birth, death, and migration.     The membership of a religion is influ-
enced by these three traditional elements of population dynamics, but
in addition, change in the size and age/sex structure of the population
can be deeply affected by personal decisions to enter or withdraw from
the group.   Furthermore, most religious movements--and the Baha'i Faith
is no exception--recognize the right of some legitimate source of
authority to disown or reinstate members who have violated the accepted
tenets of the religion.   The numbers of people who decide to join or
leave a religion may be large, but excommunication and reinstatement are
almost always rare.   They are all sources of population change, however,
and for some religions, such as the Baha'i Faith, are more important
dynamics of population than birth, death, and migration.

Technica.lly! birth into the Baha'i religion is not possible since
children are not supposed to be socially coerced into being Baha'is and
formal induction into the Faith is a step that can be taken only as a
result of a conscious personal decision made after the attainment of the
fifteenth birthday.   Of course, children in Baha'i families can hardly
avoid being inculcated with Baha'i values and beliefs, and many ulti-
mately decide to become Baha'is.      Even so, adoption of the Faith by such
children is not   in~~itable,   and there is no way that a parent can preempt
this decision which is entirely the prerogative of the offspring.      The
result is that for purposes of membership, there are no Baha'is younger
than 15.

Further difficulty in analyzing population dynamics arises out of
the fact that it is unrealistic to assume that all people can be cate-
gorized as Baha'i or non-Baha'i in a purely dichotomous fashion.      Aside

from the issue of level of commitment, there are certain identifiable
groupings in'to which Baha'is fall and as members of which they exhibit
varying degrees of attachment to the Faith.         It is logically appropriate
and mechanically possible to identify three different classes of Baha'is
and to further divide    ~ne   of those classes into two subgroups:
I.    Baha'is in good standing

> A.   Those with known addresses
B.   Those whose whereabouts are unknown

(mail-return Baha'is)
II.    Baha'is whose administrative rights have been removed
> III.    Excommunicated Baha'is
> The difference between Baha'is of known and unknown addresses has
already been examined and a case has been made for the importance of
recognizing that those with      ~~known   addresses are generally unable to
be fully effective members of the Baha'i community.         It is theoretically
possible for mail-return Baha'is to contribute significantly to Baha'i
diffusion.    Indeed, anyone who knows about the religion, even if he is
not Baha'i or is anti-Baha'i, has the potential to be an effective
agent for diffusion of the Faith.       In reality, however, it is Baha'is
in good standing with known addresses who, by working within the organized
structure of the Faith, effect most of its expansion.

Baha'is who fail to live within the social laws of the religion may
in certain instances have their administrative rights removed.         The per-
son continues to be a Baha'i in the eyes of the Faith, but until his
behavior is modified to conform to social law and adequate redress has
been made for any injustice arising out of his misbehavior, he cannot
participate in any of the administrative activities of the Faith--a

proscription that precludes voting, serving on Spiritual Asseroblies,
attending 19-day Feasts, and making financial contributions.   If
behavior is reformed, however, and injustices are rectified, then the
person will be reinstated.

If a Baha'i attempts to divide the Faith by claiming religious
authority to which he is not entitled with the object of generating a
splinter movement or sect, then he can be excornrnunicated--a drastic
step which totally disassociates him from the Faith.   Such a person,
referred to in the Baha'i religion as a covenant-breaker, is not merely
separated from the religion in the administrative sense; he is ostra-
cized.

Only Baha'is with known addresses have the potential to work
effectively for dissemination of the Faith.   On the other hand, Baha'is
in the other categories cannot be viewed as potential adopters.     What
conceptual scheme does one use to integrate these "other" Baha'is into
the prevailing tradition of diffusion study which typically only
recognizes adopters and non-adopters?l2

l2Baker's concern with abandonment of innovations is relevant here
since he focuses attention on the lack of studies dealing with this
phenomenon. Of course, withdrawals are the most important record of
abandonment, just as conversions (the religious form of adoption) are
the clearest indicator of diffusion. Nevertheless, the recognition of
the iroportance of awareness and knowledge as stages in the process of
making the adoption decision might be paralleled by similar conceptual
schemes that describe the movement from adopter, or adherent, to
abandonment. The disinterest that might be inferred from both the
"mail-return" status and the "lacking in administrative rights" status
in the Baha'i Faith may be a similar indicator of a stage in the process
of moving from adopter to rejector. D. Baker, "The Paracme of Innovation:
The Neglected Aftermath of Diffusion or a Wave Goodbye to an Idea?,"
Area, 9:259-264.

For purposes of studying population dynamics, Baha'is with known
places of residence will be taken as the core population.     This is to
some extent an arbitrary decision, but justifiable on the grounds that
when an innovation has been adopted only by a small proportion of all
potential acceptors it is more important tu clearly identify the size of
the group that can work for dissemination than it is to know exactly how
many potential adopters remain.

Using Baha'is of known residence as the basic population, it is now
possible to identify and evaluate the importance of the various forces
operating to change its size (lack of data precludes analysis of age/sex
structure).     Vital statistics regarding this Baha'i population are
available for one recent year (1975-1976), but comparable data for other
years are in a less comprehensive form and cannot be used as precisely
to analyze recent trends.     However, bits and pieces of evidence from
earlier years will make it possible to evaluate the relative stability of
the various dynamics of population change.     The statistics in Table 8
summarize the quantitative significance of the various population dynamics
during the period April 16, 1975 - April 21, 1976.

Enrollments, withdrawals, and disappearances into the mail-return
category were by far the most important elements of population change
during the 1975-1976 year.     All other forces operating to change the size
of the Baha'i population were insignificant by comparison.     Even though
the Faith enjoyed a healthy rate of adoption, the growth engendered by
that source was completely offset by attrition through withdrawals and
mail-returns.     The remaining elements of population change combined to
produce a slight overall decline in the size of the total population.        The

As would be expected considering the demographic rejuvenation of

> the whole United States--8.4 per 1,000 vs. 9.0 per 1,000.       This is sur-
prising because there are no Baha'is under age 15, a group which composes

about 24 percent of the American population and which, through its
relative freedom from mortality, strongly suppresses the nation's crude
death rate.     The implication is that for those over age 14, Baha'i
mortality is substantially lower than that for the country as a whole,
a situation which could most plausibly be explained as the result of (1)
a more youthful age structure, or (2) a population consisting of members
drawn    from socio-economic and occupational niches that are blessed with
a lower vulnerability to mortality.     Perhaps some combination of these
two factors produces the low crude death rate in the Baha'i population.
The data presented earlier indicating the extreme youthfulness of converts
during a one-month period in 1969 suggests that a young age structure
probably is the principal reason for low mortality among Baha'is.

Removal of administrative rights is a minor, but measurable, source
of attrition for the Baha'i population.     It is not counterbalanced by an
equivalent flow of reinstatements, and this suggests that in many cases
it presages abandonment of the religion.     The fact that relatively few
Baha'is had their administrative rights removed and that no Baha'is were
excommunicated during the 1975-1976 year indicates that, despite the
conceptual classification of Baha'is discussed earlier, the only
quantitatively significant group is the Baha'is of good standing and the
only division of any practical importance is that between Baha'is of known
and unknown addresses.

Migration plays a modest role in the Baha'i population formula, but
deserves mention because the immigrant and emigrant flows are substantial
when compared to those for the united States as a whole (1.7% vs. 0.2%

for immigration; 1.0% vs. an unknown value that probably is less than
0\.2% for emigration).13

During the 1960s and 1970s, only enrollments and conversion to
mail-return status have shown any strong instability.      In the case of
enrollments, that instability has been extreme, varying from a low annual
rate of about 6.4% in 1955 to a high that probably approached, if not
exceeded, 100 percent in either 1969-1970 or 1970-1971.      Inferring from
Figure 15, removal to mail-return status has exhibited significant, but
rather rrore moderate, fluctuations in annual   ~ate.   During the year
1965-1966, recovery of Baha'is from mail-return limbo permitted a net
contribution to the Baha'i population in the order of 12 percent while a
sharp rise in the number occupying the mail-return category during 1974-
1974 depleted the Baha'i population at an annual rate of about 8 percent.

Assuming long-run stability of the mail-return category--that is,
assuming that in the long run mail-returns neither deplete nor increase
the Baha'i population--there remains a need for an adoption rate of
approximately 3 percent to maintain constant membership.

CHAPTER VIII
DIFFUSION IN THE UNITED STATES:    POPULATION DISTRIBUTION

DIFFUSION BEFORE 1900

When Mary Lesch recorded the names of those who became Baha'is before
the turn of the century she was careful to note their places of residence
at the time they declared.     When this information is mapped, the emerging
geographic patterns reveal a number of diffusion trends that might other-
wise go unnoticed.

Figure 16 presents Mary Lesch's geographic information in such a
way as to depict the distributional change which occurred between 1894
and 1900.     In an effort to preserve visual simplicity, the design of the
map masks the temporal pattern of adoption which occurred in each local-
ity.     It is impossible, for example, to learn from the map that of the
694 declarants in Chicago, only 9 entered the Faith in 1894-1895, while
220 entered in 1896-1897 and 465 in 1898-1899.       This weakness is not
serious, however, since there are only three localities that had enroll-
ments over an extended period of time--Chicago, New York, and Kenosha--
and in each instance the number of declarations grew with each passing
year.

There are two sources of error in the map which, although not
quantitatively significant, should be pointed out for the sake of his-
torical accuracy.     First, in 1897, Mary Lesch aggregated all declarations
(of which there were 18) for Wisconsin.        After that, she tabulated the
declarations individually for each town.        The early growth and striking

dominance of Kenosha lead me to assume that all 18 of those declarations
in 1897 occurred there.    In fact, one or two may have taken place in
Racine.    Second, Mary Lesch listed 15 people who became Baha'is in the
Oilleland/San Francisco area in 1897 and then identified two new declarants
for 1898 who apparently were residents of San Francisco.      Lacking any
means of determining how many declarations occurred in each city, I have
treated the two urban centers as a single city and aggregated the data
accordingly.

In 1894 and 1895, there were only 11 declarations in the United
States:    nine in Chicago, one in New York, and one in Malden, Hassachu-
setts.    During the next two years, however, 336 people came into the
Faith.    This influx of new believers was concentrated in Chicago (220),
but also saw the establishment of small Baha'i nuclei in other local-
ities previously untouched by the   r~ligion,   most notably, Enterprise,
Kansas (22), Kenosha, Wisconsin (18), San Francisco/Oakland, California
(15), and Ithaca, New York (11).    New York City only attracted eight new
believers by the end of 1897.    Therefore, Chicago was in a preeminent
position, containing two-thirds of all American Baha'is, while Enterprise
(Kansas), the San Francisco Bay Area, Ithaca, and New York City were
minor subsidiary foci.    During 1898 and 1899, the entrenched dominaLce
of Chicago as the national Baha'i capital was challenged.      Although
Chicago continued to lead the country in the number of new declarants,
sudden bursts of growth in New York and Cincinnati combined with accelera-
ting expansion in Kenosha to diminish Chicago's share of the total Baha'i
population to just under 50 percent.    This same period saw the appearance
of small (15-23 member) communities in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
Racine (Wisconsin).

A number of observations can be made about diffusion in those early
days.     The first and most obvious is that Baha'i growth was confined
mostly to the industrial Northeast--the traditional core area of the
American population and economy.     There were exceptions, but aside from
the small communities established in the San Francisco area and in cen-
tral Kansas, they were insignificant.     Of course, the united States in
1900 was different from today.     At that time, Oklahoma, Arizona, and
New Mexico were still territories and southern and western centers that
today are metropolises were often little more than towns.     Los Angeles
was a city of 100,000 and Denver was slightly larger, but Seattle,
Portland (Oregon), Atlanta, Nashville, and San Antonio were much smaller.
Modern centers like Salt Lake City, Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Birming-
ham (Alabama), and Tampa were cities of 50,000 or less.     Tulsa was a
village of 1,400 which placed it ahead of Tucson, Phoenix, Albuquerque,
and El Paso, but still not quite as large as Miami with its 1,700 resi-
dents.     The point is that by 1900 the process of urbanization had not yet
created a network of large urban places outside the old Northeastern core
region.    The South was heavily populated but still rural; the West was
still being settled.     In those earliest years the Baha'i Faith was an
urban-based movement; it was inevitable that the membership would con-
centrate in the Northeast.     Of the fifteen largest cities in the country
in 1900, all but four were located in the Northeast.     (Of the four
exceptions, only New Orleans and San Francisco could be considered as
truly separated from that heartland; St. Louis and Washington, D.C. lie
on its margins).     By 1900, Baha'is were resident in all but two of those
fifteen lRrgest cities; only New Orleans and Buffalo lacked believers.

The urban base of the Baha'i population is the second noticeable
characteristic of early diffusion.       Baha'i growth concentrated in cities.
The exceptions can be explained by an analysis of the movements and
activities of Ibrahim Khayr'u'llah, and that will shed light on the
relative growth in the large urban centers as well.       Wherever Dr.
Khayr'u'llah went the Baha'i Faith grew rapidly.       Judging by the close
association between his movements and the patterns of diffusion, he was
the crucial ingredient in the Baha'i growth formula.       Shoghi Effendi has
even indicated that 'Abdu'l-Baha referred to him in such glowing terms as
II

> . 'Baha'is Peter,' 'The Second Columbus' and 'Conquerer of America'
> ,,1

Dr. Khayr'u'llah arrived in New York City in December, 1892.          The
following suwmer he moved on to Michigan where he stayed for a few
months and began to espouse the Faith.       His efforts went unrewarded,
however, and   it   ~us   not until after he moved to Chicago in February,
1894, that conversions began to take place.       His initial ineffectiveness
may have been caused by his weakness in English.       After settling in
Chicago, Dr. Khayr'u'llah met with greater success, and by the end of
1895 there had been nine Baha'i declarations in the city.       Dr.
Khayr'u'llah left Chicago at this time for a two-month journey to Europe,
but shortly after his return he secured part-time employment in Kenosha,
Wisconsin, some 50 miles from his Chicago home.       He established a routine
of living in Chicago and commuting to Kenosha one day a week, a pattern
he apparently maintained until the summer of 1897 when he journeyed to

lShoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 275.

Enterprise, Kansas (population:   517 in 1910) for an eight week summer
vacation.   Either coming or going, he stopped over in Kansas City,
Missouri.   Late in 1897, converts who had moved to New York City invited
him to make a visit there for the purpose of disseminating the Faith.
Dr. Khayr'u'llah did visit New York, but on the way he stopped over for
some days in Ithaca to assist another of his proteges in spreading the
religion; he did not reach New York until around the beginning of 1898.
His stay in that city lasted six months during which time he made
occasional trips to Philadelphia to promote the Faith.   In June of 1898 he
made a quick return trip to Chicago and Kenosha before departing from New
York with Phoebe Hearst's band of pilgrims bound for 'Akka.

Ibrahim Khayr'u'llah was directly responsible for the early growth
of the Faith in Chicago and Kenosha.   His trip to Enterprise, Kansas
precipitated all 22 of the declarations that occurred there and probably
accounted for the two new Baha'is in Kansas City.   His stopover in Ithaca
appears to have been responsible for 11 of the 19 conversions which took
place in that city.   When he arrived in New York at the beginning of
1898 the Faith already had been introduced nearly three years previously.
However, only nine declarations had taken place up until that time
whereas during 1898, 124 new believers enrolled, virtually all of them
under his guidance.   His trips to Philadelphia were directly responsible
for the 15 conversions which occurred in that city.2

2Historical information regarding the activities and probable
impact on diffusion of Dr. Ibrahim Khayr'u'llah has been gleaned from
Browne (comp.), Materials for the Study of the Babi Religion, pp.
When one examines Figure 16 it is apparent that Dr. Khayr'u'llah's
efforts acount for the establishment of six of the ten largest Baha'i
communities.     The four communities with which his name is not directly
associated are (1) San Francisco/Oakland, (2) Racine, (3) Cincinnati,
and (4) Baltimore.     Dr. Khayr'u'llah certainly had nothing to do with
the center in California; Eva Getsinger, whom he converted in Chicago,
initiated that growth point when she visited the Bay area and enrolled
Phoebe Hearst.    Racine, although very close to Chicago and Kenosha,
probably was opened in a similar second-hand fashion.      Baltimore and
Cincinnati, however, may owe more to Dr.    F~ayr'u'llah   than is commonly
recognized.    In brief local histories written by each of these com-
munities in the 1930s, he is mentioned as an early visitor.

Whatever the geographical implications of Dr. Khayr'u'llah's
work, Baha'i population change in the first three to four decades of       t~8

twentieth century reinforced the urban orientation of the religion.        As
we know, Baha'i membership in those early years was to experience at
least two oscillations, and the process of expansion followed by con-
traction appears to have winnowed out the fledgling communities in those
places where the local population base was small.     The overall decline
in Baha'i membership between 1900 and 1906, for example, resulted in the
disappearance of the Baha'i community in Enterprise and the reduction of
the contingent in Ithaca to such a low level that until 1972 the town
was unable to establish a permanent local Spiritual Assembly.      Most large
urban centers, on the other hand, managed to survive the low points in
Baha'i fortunes with a small core of believers who could revitalize the
local community after the crisis period had passed.

A third observation that can be made regarding the general pattern
of Baha'i diffusion is the apparent development of a major core region
along the southwest flank of Lake Michigan and the appearance of sub-
centers at New York and Cincinnati.    By 1900, 64 percent of all Baha'i
declarations had occurred in the Chicago-Kenosha core region while 18
percent had happened in New York and 5 percent in Cincinnati.     The
ascendancy of Cincinnati was ephemeral, but both other regions continued
for a number of decades to function as Baha'i heartlands.     Eventually,
however, their numerical dominance was eroded by the rise of other urban
centers and regional concentrations.

Finally, it should be noted that in spite of the Baha'i concen-
tration in a few large urban centers, those earliest years did witness a
surprising rate of geographic dispersal.   One cannot help wondering how a
religious movement that could claim only 1,437 conversions during its
first six yea=s of existence on the continent could manage to procure
declarations over such a wide area.    If one discounts all the declarations
in the three core areas, there remain only 197 enrollments.     And yet these
occurred in 50 different localities widely distributed across 24 states
(plus the national capital).    This averages less than four enrollments
per place.   Of course, migration and mobility of the early believers from
the major source regions must have been the cause of this dispersed
pattern of declarations, but the geographic distribution portrayed in
Figure 16 is not a direct result of relocation of the early believers from
the core area.   The   place of declaration has been plotted on the map, not
place of residence in 1900.    Even in these earliest years, Baha'is were

conscious of a need to spread their religion in the geographic--as
opposed to merely demographic--sense. 3

THE CHANGING PATTERN OF BAHA'I DISTRIBUTION: 1900-1976

Data Sources
In order to reconstruct a picture of twentieth century Baha'i
diffusion in North America it is necessary to rely on data that are neither
abundant nor faultless.   A straightforward demographic analysis requires
information on size of Baha'i population and size of total population
for a sequence of years and for subdivisions of the national area.
Estimates of total population by state and by year can be obtained from a
variety of reliable sources. 4    However, periodic censuses of the Baha'i
population that disaggregate the total by state are much harder to locate

3Early histories of Baha'i communities compiled in 1939 confirm this
conclusion. The histories, varying in length from one or two to 20 or 30
pages, usually identify the first Baha'i in the locality and list some of
the more prominent early Baha'i activists who visited that locality for
the purpose of spreading the Faith. As data sources, these histories vary
enormously in quality and comprehensiveness, but even from such an incon-
sistent source, the peripatetic nature of a core of devoted believers is
patently obvious. Just to take one example, Isabella Brittingham (a
Baha'i from 1898 until her death in 1924) is mentioned as an important
agent of early diffusion in the following local histories:  Boston, New
Haven, New York, Johnstown (N.Y.), Jersey City, Newark, Montclair,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Cincinnati, Muskegon, Racine,
Milwaukee, Denver, Phoenix, Tucson, Los Angeles, Glendale, Pasadena,
Geyserville (Calif.), Seattle, and Spokane. The odds are that she worked
for the Faith in many other localities where her efforts went unrecorded.

and, at least in early years, may embody substantial enumerational error.
It is Baha'i data, therefore, which are a problem.

Information regarding numbers of Baha'is by state for different
years was collected from three different sources.       First, for 1900, the
register of new Baha'is maintained by Mary Lesch was treated as a census.
This source is deficient because:       (1) it is actually a rAgister and not
a census;     (2) as a register it only tabulates conversions and fails to
note any disaffections, deaths, or migrations;      (3) it probably is not
complete even as a register of conversions.       In spite of these weaknesses,
however, the brevity of the time period summarized (6 years), the smallness
of the movement (about 1,400 declarants), and the extreme cor.centration of
growth in a few localities combine to improve the likelihood that the
data are adquately representative of Baha'i geographic distribution in

For 1906, 1916, 1926, and 1936, population figures on the Faith were
obtained from a decennial publication issued by the United States Bureau
of the      Census.   That publication summarized the results of a religious
survey that was conducted in each of those years. 5      This Census of

Religions was compiled by soliciting membership information from the
central organizational arms of the various faiths.        No actual census was
undertaken.     Unfortuuately, in the process of publishing the 1916 figures
the Census of Religions lumped together membership figures for a number
of states that had relatively small Baha'i populations, and so educated
guesses were made as to how those figures disaggregated by state.        The
distribution of the 1916 Baha'i population is the least firm data used
in the analysis.

For 1944, 1950, 1964, 1970, and 1976 I used Baha'i CAnsuses which
were contained in the National Archives and the National Teaching
Committee Office.      It should be renlembered that the Baha'i Faith strives
to maintain an accurate registration system; the National Spiritual
Asserr~ly   is elected by delegates who are proportionately representative
of Baha'i membership in geographical subunits of the country.

Data   Mailip~lation

I have constructed a series of maps which show the relative dis-
tribution of Baha'is in the United States for years between 1900 and
1976\.     The   time spacing of the maps was dictated by available data.       The
objective was to recreate a     pi~ture   of the Baha'i distribution pattern at
ten-year intervals, but in some instances it has been necessary to use
censal years with a somewhat smaller time interval, and in one case it
was impossible to avoid a l4-year span between maps.

In order to measure the relative strength of the Baha'i Faith in
different regions, the number of Baha'is per million population was
calculated for each state.      Then, because of the desirability of isolating
distribution from growth, the state figures for Baha'is per million were

converted to a percentage above or below the national average.       The states
were then grouped into three classes:    (1) those in which the Baha'i
representation in the total population was less than 60 percent of the
national average,   (2) those which were near the national average (60-
140%), and (3) those which contained high concentrations of Baha'is
(over 140% of the national average).    ~fuen   this information is plotted
for each of the years used in the analysis, the resulting sequence of
maps shows where in the country the Baha'i Faith has most successfully and
least successfully penetrated the resident population.       Growth or decline
in the numerical size of the Baha'i population is not shown.

The three designated class intervals were arbitrarily defined.        It
would have been possible to construct classes using standard deviation and
z-scores as the interval measures, but this would have masked the type of
information the maps are intended to demonstrated.       If distribution
alters with the passage of time in such a way as to decrease or increase
the dispersion of the state values for Baha'is per million around the
national mean, then the standard deviation would vary accordingly and
z-scores would adapt to the new standard deviation.       By using percentage
classes, however, it is possible to see whether there is a tendency for
the Baha'i distribution pattern to shift toward greater national
uniformity and if so which states represent such a shift.       The arbitrari-
ness of the class boundaries is not a serious analytical weakness because
the concern is with distributional changes through time rather than with
the distributional pattern at a given time.

Analysis
Description of Change

Figure 17 contains the series of ten maps which have been developed
using the procedures outlined above.       When viewed in sequence, the maps
identify substantial distributional shifts.

One important change in distribution was the transformation from a
situation of heavy Baha'i concentration in a few states to a much more
even spread of Baha'is across the whole country.        The figures in Table 9
summarize the magnitude and timing of that transition.

Between 1900 and 1936 there was a gradual trend away from the heavy
concentration of Baha'is in a few states.       Between 1936 and 1944 the
trend accelerated.   Since 1944, the situation has remained stable.

The gradualness of the shift between 1900 and 1936 is not sur-
prising since that was a period of slow growth; redistribution would have
had to rely on migration as well as new adoptions.     The rapid change
during the 1936-1944 period was a product of the expansionist objective
outlined in the First Seven Year Plan:     establishment of at least one
local Spiritual Assembly in every state.     This goal precipitated large-
scale dispersion because at the beginning of the planning period almost
half the states had no resident Baha'is.     The lack of significant change
after 1944 in the numbers of states exhibiting low, average, and high
Baha'i representation will be discussed later.

If we consider the geographical character of the distributional
changes depicted by the maps in Figure 17, a number of trends are visible.
The dominance of the Northeast in 1900 was almost immediately challenged
by a rising Baha'i presence on the West Coast.     Between 1906 and 1936 the
West Coast and the Northeast appear to have been Baha'i core regions of
roughly equal importance.   Florida was a third core area--a Baha'i
island in a sea of southern emptiness.     After 1936, the whole West
emerged as a dominant region in the Baha'i ecumene while the Northeast
declined sharply in importance and the South, with the continuing excep-
tion of Florida, exhibited virtually no Baha'i strength.     By 1964 this
trend had reached its climax.   The 1964 situation appears to have been no
more than a stage in the geographic development of the Faith, however,
for during the following twelve years the dominance of the West eroded
rapidly while Baha'i representation in the South experienced a meteoric
rise and the old Northeast core collapsed.     The distributional pattern
of 1900 had, through a sequence of staged changes, undergone a complete

inversion.     The original Northeast heartland is now the weakest part of
the American Baha'i ecumene while the South and West, undeveloped areas
in 1900, presently are dominant.

Since the beginning, certain states have shown persistent strength
or weakness.     Illinois and Wisconsin have always been fairly well estab-
lished while the three West Coast states have been strong since 1906.
Appalachia, on the other hand, has never been well represented in the
Faith, and Nebraska only once had even an average level of Baha'i pene-
tration.     Most other states, however, have undergone substantial change
in importance during the period 1900-1976.
What is one to make of these distributional transformations that
have swept across the country in the past eight decades?      The explanation
that most reasonably accounts for this may once again require an under-
standing of the interaction between Baha'i attitudes on the one hand and
national conditions on the other.      Throughout the twentieth century the
Baha'i concern for dispersion has been evident, but the ways in which that
concern has been expressed and the kinds of reaction it has stimulated
around the country have varied from one period to the next.      Thus, for
example, the years between 1900 and 1936--a time of alternating growth
and decline with no sharp, sustained upswing in the overall size of the
Baha'i community--was a period in which the dispersion policy, though
generally recognized, was not really articulated in the form of specific
planning objectives.     As a result, the dispersion of Baha'is followed
a pattern that conformed to the population redistribution trends of the
United States as a    who~e.   In particular, the eight states which rose

from obscurity to prominence in the Baha'i ecumene during the 1900-1936
period--California, Arizona, Florida, Washington, Oregon, New Jersey,
Colorado, and Maine--had population growth rates between 1900 and 1940
that ranked first, second, third, fourth, ninth, twelfth, fifteenth,
and forty-fourth.    In other words, with the exception of Maine,6 they
were high growth states indicating that Baha'is, in their effort to dis-
perse the Faith, were gravitating toward the states where economic oppor-
tunities were perceived to be best.

The lack of a sustained, large increase in numbers during the first
36 years of the century suggests that the redistribution of the Baha'i
population was caused by migration rather than by differential adoption
rates.    A survey of Baha'is conducted in 1936 contains evidence that that
was partially the case.    The respondents to the survey (approximately 60%
of all Baha'is) answered two questions which, in conjunction, reveal some-
thing of the migratory behavior of the Baha'i population:      (1) the place
of residence at the time of declaration as a Baha'i, and (2) current place
of residence (in 1936).    This information was aggregated to show the
number of Baha'is who moved between eleven different national regions.
The most significant inter-regional migratory flows (all those involving
five or more Baha'is) is mapped.    The result is Figure 18.   Over 16
percent of all respondents changed their regional place of residence
between their time of declaration and 1936. 7   This involved 274 moves,

Ma~ne
its low population growth rate because of the development of Green Acre
as a Baha'i institute in Eliot.

7Sixteen percent may not seem like a very large figure, but the fact
that over half of all respondents had been Baha'i for less than ten years
would tend to keep it low.

158 (58%) of which are represented by the 19 flow lines shown in the
figure.

A number of general statements can be derived from an analysis of
Figure 18, the more important of which are listed below.

> 1. Baha'i growth in California depended on immigration.

2. Lack of substantial growth in New York was the consequence of
heavy out-migration.

3. Illinois was a net supplier of migrants, but was also important
as a destination area.

4. Much of the migration was over very long distances; particularly
impressive was the flow from New York to California.

5. Previous to 1936, regions of the West other than California
were not receiving significant inflows of migrants.

6. In spite of its numerical importance in the Baha'i community,
Wisconsin remained virtually untouched by migration.

7. Westward flows greatly overshadowed eastward flows; north-south
flows were very weak or nonexistent.

Net immigration caused some of the Baha'i concentration in California,
but other states that grew to importance in the Baha'i ecumene relied
on conversions.   Table 10 confirms this statement.    Even California
relied on conversions for most of its Baha'i growth.

The situation, therefore, is paradoxical.   On the one hand, Figure 18

indicates that the migratory trends within the Baha'i community paralleled
the movement patterns of all people in the United States.     On the other
hand, the statistics on actual numbers of adoptions vs. numbers of
residents in 1936 for the eight states that experienced rapid Baha'i

growth suggest that in most cases net migration was not sufficient to
account for the rise in membership.

Although migration played a part in the redistribution of the Baha'i
population which occurred between 1900 and 1936,8 most of the growth in
new areas was a consequence of extreme differences in rates of conversion.
The higher conversion rates may have been a result of the strong religious
fervor and the action oriented behavior which probably characterized
immigrant Baha'is.   Thus the vacated states lost key diffusion agents
whereas the recipient states inherited people who greatly increased the

Actually, immigration probably was most important to redistribution
in the way that it weakened old Baha'i centers rather than in the way it
enlarged the populations of the newly emerging Baha'i states.  Illinois,
for example, was the home of 170 survey respondents in 1936, but was the
state of declaration for 188. New York was more spectacular as a source
region: Although only 122 respondents designated it as their home state,
154 admitted to having become Baha'i there.

capacity to expand local Baha'i membership.      The high growth states which
the survey tabulations indicated did not experience net immigration (e.g.,
Washington, Arizona, Colorado, and Oregon) most likely did have key
immigration flows in the    ve~7   early years--a phenomenon that the survey
would fail to detect because a large number of the early Baha'is would
have died by 1936.

Turning now to the period of rapid transition between 1936 and
1944, it is clear from Figure 17 that the redistribution of Baha'i
strength favored the West while leaving the rest of the country virtually
~~changed.    This regional ascendency was caused by the peculiar character
of the First Seven Year Plan.      The major domestic goal of that plan, it
will be remembered, was to insure that each state have at least one local
Spiritual Assembly by 1944.     As Figure 19 shows, 26 states had none at
the beginning of the planning period, and so much of the Baha'i activity
during the plan was devoted to dispersing the religion to those states in
particular.    The important point is that the First Seven Year Plan goal
was interested only in geographic dispersion and did not concern itself
with the fact that the total United States population was (and is) dis-
tributed very unevenly.     Thus the plan made it equally important to
establish one local Spiritual Assembly in Nevada with only 110,000
inhabitants as to form an Assembly in Texas with its much larger popula-
tion of 6,400,000.    This disregard for the variations in the population
sizes of the states meant that execution of the plan was likely to
generate a situation in which proportionate representation of Baha'is
would be highest in those states with small population bases.       Since

western states, though large in territory, typically contain small popula-
tions, this region benefited most from the objective of the Seven Year
Plan.     In contrast, the plan called for no specific activity in most of
the northeast states since they already had local Spiritual Assemblies.
Throughout the South the requirement of one Assembly per state was not
sufficient to stimulate a high proportionate representation of Baha'is
because most of the states in that region had substantial population
bases.     It is for this reason that the west rose to preeminence as the
area most successfully penetrated by the Faith.

Although Figure 19 has been used to help visualize the impact of the
Seven Year Plan on Baha'i proportionate distribution among states, its
content merits additional comment.      It shows how a Baha'i plan encouraged
an extremely dispersed pattern of diffusion.      The nationwide distribution
of new Spiritual Assemblies was remarkably uniform considering the initial
concentration of Assemblies in the Northeast and California.      The pattern
makes it evident that diffusion of administrative units was not strongly
influenced by distance from original source areas.      On the other hand,
hierarchical diffusion does appear to have been typical since within
states new Assemblies arose most frequently in the largest urban centers.

Migration may not   have been as important as conversions in re-
distributing the Baha'i population before 1936, but thereafter it was the
principal mechanism whereby local Spiritual Assemblies were established
in states not having any.      Figure 19 shows that during the planning period
28 new Spiritual Assemblies were formed in such states.      All but one of
the cities where these Assemblies developed appear to have been targeted
by the American Baha'i community for upgrading to Assembly status.         Between
the years 1936 and 1944, 153 Baha'is moved from states having Spiritual

Assemblies to one of those localities.       Thus, an average of six Baha'is
moved into each one during the planning period.      Considering that an
Assembly is composed of only nine adults, and that some of those goal
cities probably already had a few Baha'i residents, it is obvious that the
plan objective was achieved through migration, not conversions.

An additional 29 Baha'is are known to have made moves to ten other
similarly targeted localities, but in these cases the local Baha'i com-
munities failed to achieve the necessary threshold size of nine members
before the end of the plan.    Also, 42 Baha'is responded to the spirit
of the Seven Year Plan by moving to cities in Canada and Alaska.      A
further 24 believers migrated to cities whose Assemblies lost numbers
and became jeopardized during the plan.      All together, therefore, 248
American Baha'is (10% of the total Aro.erican Baha'i population in 1936)
moved on behalf of the Faith to achieve the domestic goals alone.      One
will recall that the First Seven Year Plan also called for the establish-
ment of at least one Baha'i community in every country in the western
Hemisphere, an international objective that was substantially exceeded
and must have siphoned off a significant number of Baha'is from the
larger American communities.    It is safe to conclude, therefore, that the
goals of the First Seven Year Plan detonated a reigratory explosion

9An unpublished National Teaching Committee report contained a
description and analysis of Baha'i activities during the First Seven
Year Plan. That report included a listing by name of all Baha'is who
migrated within the United States and Canada for the purpose of fulfilling
the plan objectives. Also included were data on year of migration and
place of residence before and after the move. This was the source of
information for the statements made about internal migration during the
1936-1944 period. It was also the data source for Figure 23.

that redistributed the American Baha'i population largely through re-
location rather than adoption.

Incidentally, many of the 153 Baha'is who moved into the 27

targeted cities during the Seven Year Plan showed a willingness to select
distant destinations.    Figure 20 shows the patterns of out-migration from
the two most separated Baha'i communities of any size--the New York and
Los Angeles metropolitan areas.   There was a distinct tendency for
Baha'i homefront pioneers to settle in target communities located rela-
tively near their previous homes, but many of the migrants travelled
long distances, bypassing numerous intervening opportunities.

After 1944, Western dominance persisted and even increased for
another twenty years.    The Second Seven Year Plan (1946-1953) and the
Ten Year Crusade (1953-1963) established domestic goals that simply
reinforced the   prevailing geographic distribution of Baha'is.    The
Second Seven Year Plan called for an increase in the nuwber of local
Spiritual Assemblies from 131 (in 1944) to 175, while the Ten Year
Crusade visualized an expansion from 169 Assemblies to 300.     Neither plan
formulated a geographic scheme for directing regional growr.h, however,
so the distribution of Baha'is showed little change.

The erosion of Western supremacy and the concurrent rise of the
South that materialized after 1964 was not a consequence of the goals
of the Nine Year Plan (1964-1973) since, like its two predecessors, it
failed to call for regional differentials in Baha'i growth.     As was dis-
cussed earlier, however, growth in the South was initiated by a fortuitous

combination of national receptivity to non-traditional spiritual move-
ments and a particularly intense Baha'i teaching effort that happened to
be launched in that region.      The changing distribution of Baha'i propor-
tionate strength which occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s had to
have   ?e~n   caused by differential adoption rates rather than relocation of
existing believers.     A 650 percent increase in the size of the Baha'i
population during those years eliminates the possibility that migration
could have been a relevant factor in the geographic redistribution of
Baha'i strength from the Northeast and West to the South.

Summary

It can be concluded that the dramatic shifts in the regional dis-
tribution of Baha'i strength which have occurred in twentieth century
America were caused by the way in which changing economic and societal
conditions interacted with the Baha'i policy of dispersion--a policy
which did not find consistent expression but rather achieved varying
levels of articulation from one era to the next.       The unpredictability
of both forces in this equation has necessitated the use of an historical
approach that explains distributional changes in terms of the prevailing
conditions of a given      period.   Even the changing mechanics of the re-
distribution process testify to the suitability of this approa;h.       In
some periods the Faith redistributed itself through regional differences
in rates of conversion while at other times migration was the key
mechanism.      Even attrition through disaffection was, for a while, the most
important way in which the distribution of the Baha'i population was
altered.

EVIDENCE OF CONTAGIOUS DIFFUSION

It is astonishing how much the interpretation of events depends
on the character of available information and the method by which it is
processed and analyzed.   The preceding discussion emphasized a number of
different points regarding the nature of Baha'i diffusion in the United
States, but the one consistent trend seemed to have been a lack of con-
tagious diffusion.   However, the shift to a new data source and the use
of a different analytical technique reveals a pronounced pattern of
contagious expansion.

All of the early volumes of The Baha'i World (vols. I-XIII) contain
directories that list, by name, every locality in the world that had
either a local Spiritual Assembly, a group, or an isolated believer.          By
extracting from certain of these volumes the places listed for the United
States, it was possible to recreate a picture of which counties had one
or more resident Baha'is in 1925, 1943, and 1962.       Similar information
for 1976 was obtained from a census of Baha'is on file in the National
Teaching Committee Office of the United States National Baha'i Center.
The final data base for this analysis, therefore, consists of an
identification of those counties which had been opened to the Faith by
each of the four years mentioned.    Figure 21 combines the data base in
a single map that shows the early Baha'i frontier and how its boundaries
changed with the passing decades.

If a county had a Baha'i resident in one of the earlier years but
then failed to remain open, the map does not depict it.       This has the
potential to weaken the analysis which will follow, but in fact it
happened infrequently and can therefore be viewed as an acceptable
failing.

Another weakness in the map is that the lengths of time between the
represented years are not entirely satisfactory.        The amount of change
between 1925 and 1962 was sufficiently small that the two intervals of
about two decades each give a clear picture of the diffusion process.
Between 1962 and 1976, however, the rate of change was so rapid that
even 14 years was too long a time span to clearly reveal the way in
which the frontier expanded.     The situation could not be avoided, however,
since no equivalent data were available for any of the        years between
1962 and 1976.

A further characteristic of the map which, although not a weak-
ness, can easily spawn misinterpretation is the way in which it more
accurately conveys information about where Baha'is were not than where
they were.    An opened county, it should be remembered, may contain one
believer or hundreds.    An unopened county, though, has no     residen~

Baha'is.     For this reason, the map shows the frontier of the Baha'i
ecumene, not the areas of Baha'i population concentration.

An analysis of Figure 21 reveals that in the earlier years the
Baha'i frontier was highly fragmented.     By 1925 only about 50 counties--
less than 2 percent of all the counties in the nation--had resident
Baha'is, and almost without exception they contained major urban centers.
Furthermore, almost all were located in the Northeast and on the West
Coast.     Only a handful of exceptions can be found:     Denver, omaha, Atlanta,
August (Georgia), Miami, and St. Augustine.

The geographic distribution of Baha'is in 1925 was as much the con-
sequence of contraction as expansion.     The confinement of the religion
to Northeast and West Coast urban centers was a product of numerical

decline.   The very early cores of Baha'i strength established between
1894 and 1906 appear to have been the only localities able to weather the
crises of decline that was preci.pitated by leadership struggles and the
contingent threat of internal schism.   Previous to 1925 the Faith managed
to penetrate some rural and quasi-rural areas, but the confinement to
cities in 1925 indicates that it was in urban centers that the Faith
established its initial footholds and from which later expansion was
orchestrated.

Between 1925 and 1943 two distinct patterns of growth prevailed.      On
the one hand, the Northeast and the West experienced substantial infilling
and coalescence, suggesting at least some   amount of contagious diffusion,
while on the other hand, hierarchical diffusion proceeded at a rapid
pace in the remaining regions of the country.     Without the national dis-
persion engendered by the First Seven Year Plan the religion would have
become firmly entrenched in the Northeast and the West, thereby giving
the impression of a regionally biased movement.

The goals of the First Seven Year Plan were filled by opening the
main urban centers in those states previously unoccupied by Baha'is.
Just as the religion found its first footholds on the continent in major
cities in the Northeast and on the West Coast, so too the process of
opening 26 states during the 1937-1944 planning period involved the
initial penetration of their major metropolitan centers.

By 1944, however, the forces of hierarchical diffusion had spent
themselves and the religion was spreading outward from established urban
cores to surrounding rural areas.   Between 1944 and 1962 most of the
expansion of the Baha'i frontier involved this sort of contagious spread,

especially in the West, but in most other areas of the country as well.
Throughout the Great Plains and in a few areas in the South, isolated
counties were opened to   ~~c   Faith, but even in those regions existing
Baha'i concentrations in urban cores expanded to nearby areas.     Notice,
for example, the linear expansion westward from Kansas City, the thrust
southward from Nashville, and the gener&l infilling between Tampa and
Miami along Florida's south and west coasts.

The opening of large areas of the West initially might be judged an
illusion since most of the western counties are so large that they
perhaps fail to behave as adequate detectors of geographic expansion.
However, as the   preceding analysis of Baha'i concentrations in individual
states has shown, the West was in fact an area of extremely rapid growth
during the   1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.     Expansion there during the period
1943-1962 probably reflects a real development and is not an exaggeration
arising out of inappropriately large territorial units of analysis.

By 1962, the extreme fragmentation of the Baha'i frontier had begun
to diminish as coalescence in the West, Northeast, and Florida had
resulted in recognizable zones of relatively thorough penetration.         Even
so, fragmentation was still the rule rather than the exception.

The period 1962-1976 was one of remarkably rapid growth in total
numbers, and this numerical expansion was paralleled by a dramatic
enlargement of the geographic limits of the religion.      More counties
were opened during this 14-year period than had been occupied during all
the preceding 68 years of Baha'i existence in the United States.      By 1976
the Baha'is had become so dispersed that the only remaining area of
recognizable resistance to penetration was the High Plains, and even this

region was riddled with pockets of Baha'i presence.   The policy of dis-
persion, formulated and implemented so early in the process of North
American diffusion, had had a powerful impact; by 1976 virtually all areas
of the country lying anywhere near a major urban center had been opened to
the Faith.   Generally speaking, the remaining unopened counties were
isolated, rural areas with small population bases.

It is valuable to compare the process of dissemination inferred from
Figure 21 with the process of growth suggested by the preceding review of
Baha'i strength using states as the units of analysis.     The county based
analysis uncovered significant contagious diffusion, especially in more
recent decades.   This trend remained totally hidden when the states were
the units of study.   In other words, finer scale of analysis has revealed
that contagious diffusion, although not recognizable at the regional
level, does tend to operate locally.

In all other respects, the conclusions derived from the county based
data tend to confirm the inferences drawn from the state based data:      (1)
the Faith has shown a distinct tendency to become more dispersed with the
passage of time, (2) the First Seven Year Plan was instrumental in
facilitating that shift, (3) the early dominance of the Baha'i ecumene
in the Northeast was rapidly challenged by the West while the South has
shown a much more recent rise in importance, (4) the Great Plains have
traditionally resisted Baha'i penetration and   con~inue   to do so, (5) early
diffusion relied on infiltration of the network of urban centers while
rural areas were drawn into the Baha'i ecumene only at the later stage,
and (6) the process of diffusion has accelerated sharply in recent years.

The fact that the two analyses do in these respects arrive at parallel
conclusions improves the credibility of each.

THE BAHA'I ECUMENE IN 1976

Identifying Explanatory Variables
By 1976, 56 percent of all counties in the United States contained
Baha'is.   Figure 22 summarizes the distribution and portrays the geo-
graphical limits of the Baha'i ecumene as of July 27th of that year.
The pattern of opened counties depicted in Figure 22 is precisely the
same as that shown in Figure 21, but in this case the cartographic
emphasis is on recent distribution rather than long-term diffusion.

The distribution of unopened countries suggests that the frontiers
of the Faith have been molded by demographic and economic factors lying
outside the control of the religion.    In particular, simple visual
comparison of Figure 22 with a number of other United States maps
depicting a variety of national patterns suggests a fairly strong
correlation between Baha'i absence and (1) small population size,      (2)
low levels of urbanization,   (3) population decline, and (4) inaccessi-
bility.    The strength and character of these relationships will be
evaluated by quantifying the independent variables, mapping them, and
cartographically comparing them with Figure 22.    First, however, it is
proper to construct a theoretical rationale for hypothesizing relation-
ships between these independent variables and the Baha'i ecumene.

There is good reason to expect an absence of Baha'is in counties
with few people.    The adult Baha'i population is so small that there is
an approximate average of only one Baha'i among every 5,000 Americans.

FIGURE 22 Presence of Baha'is in Counties of the United States: 1976*

_     Counties with one or more resident adult Baha'is
• July 27, 1976

This being the case, even if the proportionate representation of Baha'is
in the population were perfectly uniform from one territorial unit to the
next, most counties with population sizes less than 5,000 could be
expected to lack Baha'i residents.      Even counties with populations in the
5,000-9,999 range theoretically would have only one or two Baha'is.
Since diffusion involves geographic dispersion from areas where the
innovation is present to regions where it is absent, it is logical to
expect that, unless the diffusion process has completely run its course,
counties with small population bases (e.g., less than 10,000 people) are
unlikely to have resident Baha'is.

It has already been noted that, especially in the early stages, the
Baha'i Faith concentrated in large urban centers and gradually trickled
down through the remainder of the urban hierarchy.       By logical extrapola-
tion, it is reasonable to expect that in 1976 the less urbanized counties
were not as likely to have Baha'i residents as the more urbanized
counties.

Since a principal mechanism for Baha'i diffusion has been the
relocation of existing believers from areas within the Baha'i ecumene
to areas lying outside, it is logical to assume that social and economic
conditions have influenced the way in which the ecumene expands its
geographic boundaries.   With the exception of those corresponding to
city centers, counties in   ~'hich   population growth is negligible are likely
to be counties in which the economy is static, small, and incapable of
absorbing outsiders--conditions which should militate against Baha'i
penetration.   We can assume that population decline during the 1960-1970
intercensal period is indicative of such inimical socio-economic conditions.

One other means of spreading the Baha'i Faith to new areas is travel
teaching.     This may involve trips lasting for weeks but it is equally
common for believers to make short one- or two-day sorties from their
homes.     In either instance, but especially in the latter, accessibility
to unopened areas is bound to be important.     Distance is one indicator
of accessibility, but in this case the availability of high quality
highways is probably a better measure.    Most travel teachers journey
by car; and so it can be presumed that unopened areas lying athwart
major highways are likely to experience Baha'i dissemination.     It can
be hypothesized, therefore, that the Baha'i ecurnene tends to coincide with
the distribution of counties having divided highways passing through
them.

A Procedure for Statistical Comparison
The problems of quantification and cartographic representation can
be dealt with by using a binary scale for both the dependent and indepen-
dent variables.     Data are available which would allow interval scaling of
the dependent variable, but Baha'i expansionist policy has systematically
discouraged the concentration of Baha'is and so an analysis of diffusion
that relies on a measure of Baha'i concentration would fail to capture
the essence of the process.     The religion's preoccupation with expansion
of its own territorial ecurnene renders more appropriate the use of a con-
ceptual scheme that simply recognizes the presence or absence of Baha'is.

The independent variables are in some instances amenable to interval
scaling also, but by treating them as binary variables the unfortunate
loss in information is compensated for by (1) the easy and rapid amassing
and manipulation of data for more than 3,000 counties, (2) the

simplification and improved clarity of maps used in the analysis, and
(3) the development of cartographically based statistical techniques.

The conceptual form and cartographic representation of the dependent
variable already has been presented (as in Figure 22).       The Baha'i ecumene
consists of those counties having resident adult Baha'is in 1976.

The first independent variable--population size--is measured by
identifying all counties having 10,000 or more residents in 1970 and by
contrasting them with the remaining counties having smaller popula-

lO
tions.         This variable shows a very similar spatial pattern to that
created by a dichotomization of counties according to whether they are
or are not urbanized with population concentrations of 2,500 or greater,
and for that reason this population size variable can also stand as a
surrogate variable for urbanization.

The second independent variable is socio-economic dynamism, and
is defined by dividing the U.S. counties according to whether they
experienced population increase or decline during the period 1960-1970. 11

Accessibility, the third independent variable, is measured by con-
trasting the counties with and without direct access to divided highways
in 1976. 1 2

Baha'i presence, the dependent variable, is related to each of the
three independent variables separately.       The first procedural step is to
prepare peel coat negatives for all the variables.       In the same way that
Figure 22 represents data on Baha'i and non-Baha'i counties, these maps
will identify the positive and negative counties for each independent
variable.       The advantage of peel coats is that a photographic process
can be used to print maps that overlay any combination of variables.

Next, maps are printed which compare the pattern of the dependent
variable with that of each of the independent variables.       Each map shows
the geographic distirubtion of the four different kinds of areas:          (1)
counties registering positively for both variables,      (2) counties
registering negatively for both variables,      (3) counties registering
positively for the dependent variable but negatively for the independent
variable (these will be referred to as rC3itive residuals), and (4)
counties registering negatively for the dependent variable but positively
for the independent variable (these will be referred to as negative
res iduals) •

After this, for each map, a contingency table is constructed that
tabulates the number of counties falling into each of the four categories
and compares these numbers with (1) the numbers one would expect under
condltions of random occurrence, and (2) the numbers one would expect if
a perfect positive relationship existed between the two variables.

A hypothetical example can be used to explain this method of
statistical analysis.       Assume that an area contains 100 counties, and that
the following contingency table describes the actual interaction of
dependent variable A and independent variable B:

OBSERVED FREQUENCIES
Independent Variable (B)

+            total
> Dependent        +       40   20        60
Variable (A)             10   30        40

total   50   50       100
Given conditions of random occurrence, however, one would expect
the following cell frequencies:

EXPECTED FREQUENCIES
Independent Variable (B)

+            total
> Dependent        +       30   30        60
Variable (A)             20   20        40

total    50   50       100
If, on the other hand, a perfect spatial relationship existed
between the two variables, then the cell frequencies would be:

IDEAL FREQUENCIES
Independent Variable (B)

+            total
> Dependent        +       50   10        60
Variable (A)              o   40        40

total    50   50        50
The first question to be answered is:         To what extent does the
observed pattern of cell frequencies account for the difference between
the expected frequencies given random chance (no correlation) and the
expected frequencies given a perfect spatial relationship (perfect cor-
relation)?   This can be simply measured by looking at the same cell in
each of the three tables and observing what percent of the difference
between the random and ideal expectations is accounted for by the
observed frequency.   In the upper left cell (which records the number of
counties which score positively for both A and B) the random expectation

is 30 while the perfect relationship expectation is 50.        The actual
observed frequency is 40, and that accounts for 50 percent of the dis-
tance between 30 and 50.       No matter what cell is considered, the same
percentage figure emerges:       50 percent.   It can be concluded that the
observed relationship between A and B is 50 percent complete.        The
variables interact neither in a perfectly random fashion nor in a per-
fectly correlated fashion; rather, they achieve a correlation which is
50 percent of their potential.

However, the comparison of A and B is slightly complicated by the
fact that the variables do not have the same proportionate split of
positive and negative values.       Whereas the independent variable records
50 positive and 50 negative values, the dependent variable records a split
of 60 and 40.    The result is that even in a situation where perfect
correlation is achieved there must, by necessity, be some cases falling
in one of the residual cells.       In the example used, 10 positive residuals
are to be expected.    ~Vhat   this means is that unless the positive/negative
split is exactly the same for the dependent and independent variables, it
will be physically impossible for the independent variable to act as a
perfect predictor of the dependent variable, even when the relationship
between A and B achieves perfection (100%).       The greater the quantitative
diffeIence in the positive/negative splits of the two variables, the
weaker the potential of the independent variable to predict the dependent
one.    This diminishing of potential predictive power must be considered
when calculating the correlation between the two variables.        The easiest
way to account for this is by answering the following question:        For what
percentage of all counties can the independent variable correctly predict

the dependent variable?     In the example   giv~n,   the ideal frequencies
table indicates that B has the potential to predict 50 positive values
for A and 40 negative values for A.     This totals 90 and represents 90
percent of all the counties.     It can be concluded, therefore, that the
predictive power of the ideal frequency table is 90 percent.         If the
percentage figure for observed correlation between A and B (50 percent)
is multiplied by the predictive power of the ideal frequencies table
(90 percent), a measure of actual correlation is obtained:         45 percent.
Thus, assuming A is indeed a dependent variable and B is truly dependent,
B explains 45 percent of the variation in A.

This is the basic statistical procedure that will be used to relate
the Baha'i ecumene to each of the three designated independent variables.
Although this procedure resembles that used to calculate Guttman's
coefficient, it offers two advantages.       First, it evaluates the total
predictive power of the independent variable rather than only the
additional predictive power exercised by the independent variable after
having already made a best guess based on the modal category of the
dependent variable.     Second, it clearly differentiates between the amount
of correlation which does occur between the two variables, and the amount
of correlation which could occur given the distribution of values for each
of the two variables.

and county population size.    The within table correlation is high, but
the predictive power of the independent variable is rather low, so the
actual correlation is 32.3 percent, indicating a strong relationship
between the two variables.    It can be concluded that diffusion of the
religion has occurred more readily in counties having reasonably large
population bases and some amount of urbanization.

The low predictive power of the independent variable results from
an uneven split in the frequency of its positive and negative values
(73 percent positive; 27 percent negative) whereas the dependent variable
has a more even division (57 percent positive; 43 percent negative).
Thus, when a map comparing the two variables is considered, a large number
of negative residuals and a small number of positive residuals can be
expected.   Ordinarily, this would be the appropriate place to consider
such a map, but since the spatial patterns arising out of a comparison
of the Baha'i ecumene and population size resemble, to a remarkable
degree, the spatial patterns that emerge when the   Bah~'i   ecumene is com-
pared with economic dynamism and accessibility--the other two independent
variables--map analysis will be deferred so that all three cartographic
comparisons can be discussed together.

Baha'i Ecumene vs. Socio-Economic Dynamism:--As Table 12 shows, the
surrogate variable for socio-economic dynamism also exhibits a reasonably
high ability to discriminate between counties that are and are not part
of the Baha'i ecumene.   In this case, the within table correlation is
lower, indicating a weaker relationship between the two variables, but
the predictive power of the table is higher, permitting an actual corre-
lation that is nearly as strong.   Once again, a positive conclusion

regarding the hypothesi.s is warranted:    insofar as population growth and
decline acts as an adequate surrogate variable, it can be concluded that
the Baha'i Faith has diffused more rapidly in those counties which have
recently exhibited a dynamic socia-economic structure.

Baha'i Ecurnene vs. Accessibility:--Accessibility also shows a
capacity to predict which counties will be found to have been opened to
the Faith.    As Table 13 indicates, the within table correlation is
virtually the same as that for socia-economic dynamism; the slightly
lower actual correlation is due to the slightly lower predictive power of
the independent variable.     The conclusion that can be drawn is that
accessibility is as important as socia-economic dynamism in explaining the
way in which the Baha'i Faith has spread.     The religion has diffused more
rapidly to those counties which are accessible than to those counties
which are not.

A Cartographic Analysis of the Correlates of Baha'i Diffusion:--All
three independent variables are endowed with a high level of explanato£y
power.    Figures 23, 24, and 25 describe the geographical character of the
relationship between the Baha'i ecumene and each of the independent
variables.    Comparison of the three figures shows that their broad spatial
patterns are remarkably similar.     The major similarities are enumerated
below.

1.     The West Coast littoral, Arizona, and large parts of Nevada and
New Mexico contain in all three instances a high incidence of counties
in which positive values are present for both the independent and dependent
variable.

2.   In a similar fashion, southern and central New England, most
of New York state, the Northeast littoral as far south as Virginia, and
a ragged strip of territory running through the industrial heartland of
middle America exhibit a high level of correlation between Baha'i presence
and positive scores on the independent variables.

3.   The correlation of positive scores also occurs frequently in the
Carolinas, and peninsular Florida.

4.   Elsewhere, the coincidence of positive scores shows a frag-
mented pattern that usually focuses in and around major urban centers
(note, for example, Salt Lake City, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Tulsa,
Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Houston, New Orleans, Birmingham,
Atlanta, Nashville, Memphis, and St. Louis) or extends along key
national arterials (especially visible are:   the old Routhe 66 between
Illinois and Texas; Interstate 80 between Chicago and Denver; Inter-
.state 94 running from Chicago to St. Paul/Minneapolis, Fargo, and points
west; Interstate 25, flanking the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains
between Wyoming and New Mexico).

5.   Counties unopened to the Baha'i Faith correlate highly with
negative scores on the independent variables throughout most of the High
Plains running from North Dakota and Montana to Texas.   This relationship
of negative values is visible throughout the whole area with the exception
of a spearhead in eastern Wyoming and western South Dakota.

6.   Negative scores also correlate in parts of the rural domain
surrounding the Mormon core at Salt Lake City.

7.   When socio-economic dynamism and accessibility are considered,
negative scores for these variables frequently anticipate an absence of

Baha'is in a number of widely scattered counties in southern Appalachia
and throughout a broad arc of territory that encircles the southern end
of that mountainous core.     Vague hints of this pattern are also visible
in Figure 23 which relates Baha'i presence to population size, but for
this independent variable the area being discussed generally contains
counties with population sizes of 10,000 or more.

8.   Positive residuals persistently crop up throughout large areas
of the Rocky Mountains and the intermountain west as well as in the
previously mentioned wedge of eastern Wyoming and western South Dakota.

9.   Baha'i presence also tends to defy the control of the indepen-
dent variables in parts of central and southwestern Georgia.

10.   positive residuals occupy a scattering of locations throughout
a broad zone in   t~e   south-central part of the country and along the
northern fringe of the eastern half of the nation.      This pattern, how-
ever, is confirmed by only two of the three independent variables,
population size once again being the exception.

11.   Negative residuals occur with moderate frequency in the Mormon
culture region.

12.   Baha'is fail to be present where one might expect in a number
of widely scattered counties in the High Plains and throughout a very
large wedge that extends eastward and gradually curls around the southern
portions of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, terminating in a point that
pierces the southern flank of Pennsylvania.      A second tiny prong branches
off and reaches the Atlantic via southern Virginia.

The patterns outlined above are numerous and complex, and they
show a tendency to vary widely in intensity and geographic scale.         They

are notable,    hOl~ever,   in that they are confirmed by each of the three maps
relating one of the independent variables to the Baha'i ecumene.

It can be concluded that a    la~ge   population base, high urbanization,
socio-economic dynamism, and high accessibility facilitate Baha'i diffu-
sion.     The Baha'i Faith has more completely penetrated regions with
these characteristics.       One could argue that these characteristics do
little more than define urban America.          Insofar as this is true, it can
be said that Baha'i diffusion has proceeded rapidly in urban America but
has been inhibited in rural areas.        This means that the heavy concentra-
tions of Baha'i counties in such areas as the West Coast, the Northeast,
and parts of the South is to be expected considering the largely urban
character of most of these counties.          Conversely, absence of Baha'is in
the High Plains is a predictable result of the strongly rural nature of the
region.

At this point, the distribution of residual counties becomes most
interesting.     In considering these locations and the reasons for their
occurrence, it will be remembered that positive residuals, indicating
inordinately rapid Baha'i diffusion, are to be found (1) throughout the
Rockies and the intermountain west, (2) in parts of Georgia, and (3) to a
lesser extent in the South Central states and along the eastern half of
the Canadian border.        The advanced stage of the diffusion process in the
West may be the consequence of two conditions:          (1) the unusually large
counti8s in that region are more likely to have Baha'i residents than
the much smaller counties in the East, and (2) the heavier concentration
of Baha'is in the West that was documented and discussed earlier in this
chapter (see Figure 17) has given that region a relative surplus of

diffusion agents who, due to their numbers, have been in a position to
expand the geographical limits of the ecurnene at a rapid pace.     The
surprising geographical success of the religion in Georgia--and indeed
in a scattering of counties throughout the South--may be a result of the
American Baha'i policy of attempting to reach southern Blacks. 13     Many
of the counties in the South which score negatively on two or three of
the independent variables probabl: have been opened to the Faith due to
the fact that their high concentrations of Blacks have attracted Baha'i
attention.    The positive residuals lying near the Canadian border in
the Northeast nay have been caused by the proximity of this zcne to the
original core area of the religion.

The negative residuals, it will be remembered, indicate that the
Faith has failed to diffuse as rapidly as might be expected (1) in
certain parts of the Mormon culture realro, (2) in a smattering of
locations in the High Plains, and (3) in scattered places throughout a giant
wedge penetrating much of the interior of the eastern half of the country.
The retardation of diffusion in the Mormon heartland probably can be
attributed to that region's inherent resistance to outside religious
influences.    In the East, however, the residuals are so widely scattered
that their distribution is nearly random.

Combining Independent Variables:--Population size, socio-economic
dynamism, and accessibility proved to be roughly equal in their capacity
to predict which counties belor.ged to the Baha'i ecumene in 1976.        The
most explanatory variable--population size--was able to account for

13 The Baha'i World:   1968-l97~, XV, p. 226.

32\.3 percent of all variation in the dependent variable while the
equivalent value for accessibility, the least explanatory of the indepen-
dent variables, was 26.2 percent.     The fact that the three variables show
a similar capacity to explain the distribution of the Baha'i ecumene
means that for cartographical purposes, they can be treated with equal
weight.    As a result, it is simple to construct a map that combines them
in a single presentation.    Figure 26 has three evenly spaced grey tones
to indicate those counties having a positive score on one, two, or all
three of the independent variables.    White, of course, shows counties
which failed to record positive scores for any.     Without indulging in a
detailed comparative analysis, it is interesting to notice the structural
similarity between this figure and the three-way classification of
counties according to    when they were opened to the Baha'i Faith (Figure
27) •

Table 14 presents the observed, expected, and ideal contingency
tables for this three by four cross-tabulation of cell frequencies.        It
is obvious that the discriminatory power of the observed table of fre-
quencies is superior at the corners, very good for five of the other six
perimeter cells, and poor only for the two interior and one of the peri-
meter cells.     The latter part of Table 14 shows the percentage of the
difference between the expected and the ideal frequencies which is
accounted for by the observed frequency for each cell in the table.        In
the final analysis, Table 14 indicates that a total of 1,540 counties
would have to be shifted from one cell to another in order to convert
from the expected to the ideal contingency table.     The table of observed
frequencies shows that 579 counties are so moved, thereby accounting for

37\.6 percent of the difference between the expected and ideal patterns.
Furthermore, there is no instance in which the observed frequency of a
cell fails to diminish the distance between the expected and ideal
frequencies.     All this reconfirms that the Baha'i ecumene has been pro-
foundly    shaped by population size, socio-economic dynamism, and
accessibility.     Furthermore, by treating the independent variables as
elements of a single dimension arrayed along a scale from one to four,
and by allowing the dependent variable to take on anyone of three
values indicative of stage of adoption (as opposed to a dichotomous
structure indicative only of distribution), it is possible to improve
the explanatory power.     This is particularly so when the depenc.ent and
independent variables have extreme values.

HOW URBAN IS THE BAHA'I FAITH?

Until now, all presented evidence has intimated that in the United
States the Baha'i Faith is primarily an urban phenomenon.     The preceding
analysis has shown that Baha'is are more likely to be found in urban
counties than in rural ones.     Membership data are available, however,
which make     it possible to measure the proportionate strength of Baha'is
in urban as opposed to rural areas and with this material in hand it is
possjblc to offer a definitive answer to the question of whether American
Baha'is tend to congregate in urban places.

At present, the Office of Membership and Records at the National
Baha'i Center in Wilmette, Illinois, keeps all its membership data on
computer file, adding enrollments and subtracting withdrawals as they
occur.    with this as a data base, that office is able to obtain regular
printouts tabulating the numbers of Baha'is residing in different

localities throughout the United States.    One of these printouts, dated
June 15, 1976, is the source of membership data for this analysis.

In order to relate the absolute number of Baha'is to the size of
the total population it is necessary to have figures that indicate the
size of the total population for the various urban and rural localities.
Ideally, such figures would be representative of the demographic situation
in June, 1976.    Unfortunately, since this kind of information is not
readily available, I have been obliged to rely on the 1970 census
enumeration. 14   The aim is to measure the ratio of Baha'is per million
in the total population of the United States and in a number of urban
and rural localities around the country.    The fact that the   calcula~ion

of these proportionate figures uses a Baha'i enumeration which is six
years later than the population census means that the calculations will
not yield accurate results.    In particular, a few places which have
experienced especially rapid growth or decline during the early 19705
will have estimated numbers of Baha'is per million which are very
inaccurate.   Since the analysis does not focus on individual cases,
however, the unavoidable inaccuracies usually will be within tolerable
limits.

Because the United States population has been growing during the
1970s, the data used to calculate the number of Baha'is per million
population will yield inflated values.     This is of no real concern since

14na t a sources: U.S. Bureau of the Census, U.S. Census of Population:
1970, Final Report PC(1)-A1, Number of Inhabitants: United States Summary
(Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1971), Table A, p. viii
Rand-McNally Green Guide (Chicago: Rand-McNally & Company, 1974, pp. 8-10.)

the objective is to learn the relative size of the values in rural and
urban areas, not the actual size of the values.          The absolute values are
rather misleading anyway since the calculations relate Baha'i adults to
total population of all ages.

In 1970, there were in the United States 472 cities with populations
of 45,00 or more.        Many were actually suburbs of some larger city; they
have been classified separately.          If a city belonged to a Standard
Metropolitan Statistical Area and yet was not the largest city in the
SMSA in 1970, it has been considered as a suburban community.              The only
exception to this arbitrary definition involved cities which were not
the largest in their SMSA's in 1970 and had populations of 300,000 or
more.        These were considered as second cities rather than as suburbs.
Within these definitional constraints, the following classes of
localities have been defined for this analysis:

> l.     Cities having 750,000 or more people (10 cities)
> 2.     Cities having 300,000 - 749,999 people (37 cities)
> 3.     Cities having 100,000 - 299,999 people (72 cities)
> 4.     Cities having   45,000 -   99,999 people (109 cities)
5.     Suburban communities having 45,000 - 299,999 people

(244 suburbs)
6.     State areas after having excluded urban places with more

than 44,999 people (48 states)
The number of Baha'is per million population has been calculated
for each locality in each of the five cateogries of urban places and
for each of the 48 remaining state areas.          Table 15   a~gregates   these
figures according to the classification outlined above.            Eventually, the
individual locality calculations will be used to construct a map showing

the concentration of Baha'is in individual cities and in remaining state
areas.

Contrary to expectations, the Faith is least well represented in
large urban centers, is more likely to be strong in smaller cities, and
is most concentrated in the rural areas and those small urban places
with populations less than 45,000.     Furthermore, the religion is not a
suburbmlone.     The number of Baha'is per million in suburban areas is
well below the national average and even more dramatically beneath the
average for equivalently-sized independent urban centers.

On the one hand, the Faith is not a rural, agrarian movement.     On
the other, it does not concentrate in the major urban centers which, it
will be remembered, were the dominant repositories of Baha'i strength
in the very earliest years and which one would expect to be the major
sources for diffusion throughout the twentieth century.     Furthermore,
the Baha'is are not in the suburbs where tpeir presence would intimate

a white middle-class bias.      If the Baha'is are not in the cities and
are not in the country, where are they?      If the biS cities were horne for
most of the early Baha'is and yet contain relatively small Baha'i
populations today, what has happened?

In answer to the first question, it seems that today Bahai's con-
ce~trate   in small urban places.    Cities of 100,000 or more generally con-
tain a less than average number of Baha'is per million population while
cities in the 45,000-99,000 range possess a significantly higher than
average number.     Furthermore, in the remaining state areas, where the
number of Baha'is per million population is well above the national
average, we know from the previous analysis that most of the very rural
counties have not yet been opened to the Faith.      The logical conclusion
is that the religion must be strongly represented in the small urban
places--cities and towns ranging in size from 2,500 to 44,999.

The explanation of why the Faith has corne to concentrate in small
urban places is to be found in the dissemination policies of the religion
and in   t~3   typical Baha'i attitude toward large cities.   A brief
explanation of policy and attitude regarding appropriate place of
residence for believers will answer the question of what happened to the
early Baha'i concentration in the big cities.

In July, 1954, Shoghi Effendi directed a message to the Baha'is of
America in which he stated that the United states was passing through a
crisis precipitated by rampant materialism and a sharp deterioration in
moral, social, and political standards.      The Guardian perceived the
American Baha'i community as being threatened by dark forces--forces
which could sap the spiritual vitality of the movement in America and

undermine the ability of that national community to fulfill the respon-
sibilities for global dissemination of the Faith assigned to it by the
recently inaugurated Ten Year Plan.   Iwbedded in the text of his message
was a notable directive regarding Baha'i residence in big cities:

A veritable exodus from the large cities where a
> considerable number of believers have, over a period of
> years congregated, both on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts,
> as well as in the heart of the country, and where, owing to
> the tempo and the distractions of city life, the progress of
> the Faith has been retarded, must signalize the inauguration
of their most intensive and ch~llenging phase of the Crusade

[Ten Year Plan] on the horne front. Most certainly and emphat-
> ically must the lead be given by the two focal centers of Baha'i
> activity, which rank among the oldest of and occupy the most
> honored position among, the cities throughout the American
> Union, the one as the mother city of the North American con-
> tinent [Chicago]. The other named by 'Abdu'l-Baha the City
> of the Covenant [New York]. Indeed, so grave are the
> exigencies of the present hour, and so critical the political
> position of the country, that were a bare fifteen adult Baha'is
> to be left in each of these cities, over which unsuspected
> dangers are hanging, it would still be regarded as adequate for
> the maintenance of their local Spiritual Assemblies. 1S
> Shoghi Effendi was clearly urging the American Baha'is to abandon
the large cities, and in doing so, he intimated that cities are unhealthy
places to live because they corrode spirituality and religiosity.     In
other words, the Guardian did not merely stipulate a pattern of behavior
which earnest Baha'is were obliged to follow; he actually projected an
official Baha'i attitude regarding the evils of urban life.    His message
was designed to encourage and direct the American believers in their
efforts to achieve the goals of the Ten Year Plan.   Because of the
authority and immutability of the Guardian's statements, however, his
words precipitated an anti-urban outlook which exists even today and is

lSShoghi Effend~, Citadel of Faith (Wilmette, Illinois:    Baha'i
Publishing Trust, 1970), p. 128.

likely to persist well into the future unless the Universal House of
Justice specifically projects a contrary view.

As a result, many Baha'is have left the large urban centers.     To a
great extent this has been necessitated by the planning goals    conta~ned

not only in the Ten Year Plan but also in the Nine Year and the Five
Year Plans.   These have consistently called for the formation of large
numbers of local Spiritual Assemblies, an objective that can only be
achieved outside the cities and towns where Assemblies already exist.
Thus there developed a strong and steady stream of migration from the
large urban centers, which Shoghi Effendi himself recognized as the
reservoirs of Baha'i manpower, to the many smaller places needing
Baha'is to form Assemblies.     Even today, when Baha'is are least well
represented in the large cities, it is still those cities which supply
the manpower needed to fulfill plan objectives; they are the only places
where significant numbers of Baha'is can be removed without endangering
the local Assembly.   With only one Baha'i for every 5,000 inhabitants
it takes a city of 45,000 to maintain a local Spiritual Assembly without
an above average   n~~er   of Baha'is per million population, and even a
city of 100,000 might only be expected to contain 20 Baha'is, almost
half of whom would be required simply to maintain the local Assembly and
well over half of whom would be necessary to insure that the Assembly
is not jeopardized by mortality or migration motivated by non-Baha'i
considerations.

On the other hand, there is nothing inherent in Baha'i values and
attitudes that binds the believers to rural, agrarian pursuits 16 and so

16 Ba ha'u'11ah stipulated that mankind should develop a strong agri-
cultural foundation that can support civilization, but His concern was

the Baha'i population in the united states has continued to have the
non-agricultural orientation that characterized it early in its history.
This fact, combined with the anti-metropolitan nature of recent Baha'i
policy and the peculiarities of Baha'i planning, have gradually con-
centrated the Faith's population in small urban centers.

Recalling that the 1936 survey of Baha'is contained information
regarding place of residence at time of adoption and place of residence
in 1936, it is possible to compare the rural/urban distribution of Baha'is
in 1976 with the approximate distribution existing some 40 years earlier.
By tabulating those survey returns and comparing them with the figures for
1976, we obtain the results shown in Table 16.   For purposes of com-
parison it should be noted that those 119 cities having 1970 populations
of 100,000 or more accounted for 25 percent of the total United States
population in 1970 and 30 percent in 1930.

These figures highlight the magnitude of the deurbanization process
which the Baha'i Faith has been undergoing in the United States during the
twentieth century.   They also document that, even before Shoghi Effendi's
statement in 1954 regarding the need to move out of large cities, the
process had been precipitated by the dispersion policy which 'Abdu'l-Baha
initiated early in American Baha'i history.

Figure 28 shows the spatial distribution of Baha'i representation
in urban and rural places (SUburban localities are not represented).     The
class intervals used to designate high, medium, and low concentrations of
Baha'is were selected so as to divide the urban places into three groups

with insuring high productivity and not with drawing people into agri-
culture as an occupation. Baha'i World Faith, p. 176.

of roughly equal size.   The figure makes it possible to evaluate the
extent to which the spatial distribution of Baha'i concentrations is the
same for urban and rural places.

For most areas of the United States it is apparent that the numbers
of Baha'is per million populaticn in the urban centers are generally about
the same as in the surrounding rural zones.     In the West, for example, the
high concentration of Baha'is in rural areas is matched by consistently
high values for the urban centers.     Also, in the extensive areas of the
South which show a moderate level of Baha'i concentration (Texas     to
Florida), the cities of the region, although variable, show a distribution
of values that is biased toward the same moderate range of values    (10
cities high, 23 cities moderate, 15 cities low).     In a similar fashion, the
cluster of eastern states having low concentrations of Baha'is in rural
areas (New York to Tennessee) generally contains urban centers exhibiting
the same pattern.

Two areas stand out as having rather different values for the urban
and rural sectors of the population.     Radiating westward from Chicago

there are a number of cities containing high concentrations of Baha'is
although the parent states show low to moderate levels of Baha'i con-
centration in rural areas.    The five states of Illinois, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri contain 34 cities which, in terms of
Baha'is per million, distribute as follows:    15 cities high, 11 cities
moderate, and 8 cities low.    The Faith is more firmly entrenched in the
urban centers of this region than in its rural areas.    Conversely, the
five Southeastern states of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Georgia contain many cities with low and moderate concen-
trations of Baha'is (8 cities high, 12 cities moderate, 6 cities low)
even though the rural setting is a bastion of Baha'i strength.

The peculiar bias toward urban residence west of Chicago and toward
rural locations in the Southeast probably arises out of the difference
in when the Faith appeared in these regions.    The religion first estab-
lished itself in Chicago, and cities of Wisconsin and Illinois were
very early centers of Baha'i activity.    Diffusion of the Faith into the
tier of states immediately to the west proceeded slowly and fitfully, but
still occurred in the earlier parts of the century when the emphasis
on abandonment of large urban places was not yet very marked.    In the
Southeast, however, Baha'i diffusion occurred very late--postdating the
articulation of Shoghi Effendi's 1954 policy of avoiding cities and
coinciding with the rising Baha'i concern with recruitment of Blacks who
in that section of the country concentrate in rural areas.

CHAPTER IX
DIFFUSION IN THE UNITED STATES:     POPULATION COMPOSITION

POPULATION COMPOSITION:  ITS MEANING AND RELRVANCE

FOR THE STUDY OF DIFFUSION

When a geographer studies diffusion he tends to concentrate on the
geographical spread of a phenomenon.    However, this is only one of
several possible perspectives on the process.     The sociologist, or the
demographer, evaluates diffusion in terms of how successfully and how
rapidly an innovation penetrates different segments of society.       It might
be asked, for example, whether the Baha'i Faith has appealed equally to
people of all backgrounds or whether the religion has been more accept-
able to certain societal strata--theyoung or the old, the rich or the poor,
the Black or the White.    In other words, What kinds of people are Baha'i?

Baha'i policy stresses the importance of recruiting all kinds of
people, but in fact it is extremely rare for any subgroup of a total
population not to contain social, economic, or demographic biases.      When
people from a certain demographic or socio-economic stratum dominate a
group's membership this often indicates that the values or beliefs upon
which the group is founded have a greater appeal to some parts of society
than to others.   Once the biases are known, it is possible to hypothesize
about why they exist.     In the case of the Baha'i Faith, however, so little
reliable data on membership characteristics is available that it first
must be established whether such biases exist.     It will be hypothesized
that for the Baha'i religion in America the null hypothesis will prove
to be unrealistic; by hypothesizing that the Baha'is are a representative

sample of the United States population, however, the assumption will be
that the planning ideal has been achieved.   Thus, the degree to which the
Baha'i population deviates from the national norms will be a measure of
the extent to which Baha'i policy has not--or has not yet--succeeded in
its goals.   This will be a subjective evaluation.   Perfect conformity
between the subgroup and the total population is a virtual impossibility
when diffusion has encompassed less than one-tenth of one percent of all
people.   The magnitude of Baha'i biases will have to be judged in light
of what would be typical for a movement of such numerical insignificance.

Unfortunately, good contemporary data describing the Baha'i popu-
lation are almost entirely lacking.   Two surveys of American Baha'is
have been conducted in the past ten years.   One contained a sampling
bias of such severity as to render it useless, while the other, although
extremely valuable for some of the data it amassed, also was plagued by
sampling problems.   This second survey, conducted in December of 1968,
resulted in some information regarding composition of the Baha'i popula-
tion, but only aggregated tables and a very brief statement of methodology
are available.   Without access to the original questionnaire responses
it is impossible to evaluate the clarity of the questions and accuracy of
the responses.   The further fact that the survey was conducted before the
period of explosive Baha'i growth (Spring, 1969 to Spring, 1972) means
that its findings are not very recent and    may not be representative of
the present situation.   As a result, no truly current sources of informa-
tion describe the characteristics of the believers today.

A 1936 SURVEY:   DATA FROM THE PAST

The Significance of the Survey
In 1936 the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and
Canada sponsored a survey of believers that yielded basic demographic
and social information about the character of the Baha'i community at
that time.    The procedure underlying this survey is unknown, but it would
appear that the National Assembly arranged for the design and printing
of questionnaires which were distributed to all existing local Spiritual
Assemblies.    The Assemblies were instructed to have each Baha'i in their
respective localities fill out one of the forms.     Eventually, the com-
pleted questicnnaires were returned to the National Center in Wilmette,
where, it seems, they were stored in the Archives without ever having
been used.

The questionnaires were nothing more than g" x 5" cards containing
about a dozen simply worded questions.     This was sufficient, though, to
provide accurate information about the age, sex, racial stock, religious
background, and length of Baha'i affiliation of the respondents.     All these
characteristics will be analyzed in the upcoming discussion.     Questions on
the form also solicited information regarding place of residence in 1936
and at the time of adoption of the religion, and regarding marital
status and family size.    The place of residence information already has
been niscussed; the marital status and family size data were not tran-
scribed from the original questionnaires because there seemed to be no
meaningful way of analyzing them.

The 1936 survey is a useful source of data because the responses
offer information about demographic and social characteristics of the

United States Baha'i population 40 years ago.     At first glance, it may
seem that the pas-sage of four decades will have impaired its value, but
that is not so.   By definition, the study of diffusion is concerned with
the process of change.    A picture of the Baha'i population in 1936 is an
excellent source of comparative information against which results of the
1968 survey can be appraised.     When the Baha'i National Center completes
the comprehensive survey that it is now planning, the 1936 questionnaires
will become even more precious.     In particular, it will be possible to
evaluate how much the Faith has moved toward its objective of representa-
tive membership during the last 40 years of planned growth.

It is fortunate that the survey was conducted in 1936 since that
was a watershed year marking the beginning of highly articulated planning
in the united States.    Previously, American believers were guided in
their recruitment efforts by general Baha'i policies and by the rather
nebulous objectives of the Tablets of the Divine Plan.     In 1937, however,
one year after the survey, serious Baha'i planning was initiated.     The
first two Baha'i growth plans did not show much concern for the need to
achieve compositional representativeness, but even so, 1937 marked the
beginning of the era in which the Faith had at its disposal the planning
tools necessary for consciously affecting changes in the composition of
its population.   The fact that compositional diversity was not stressed
in the first two plans only indicates that in the beginning it was not
accorded as high a priority as were the other two key policies--numerical
increase and geographical dispersion.     Since both the Ten Year Plan and
the Nine Year Plan emphasized composition goals, the 1936 survey should
show whether the Baha'i population has undergone compositional change

indicative of planning success.       Furthermore, the compositional picture
in 1936 should be a fair indicator of the way in which the Faith was
developing before the effective implementation of planning.

The 1936 Survey:     Representativeness,

Reliability, and Accuracy
Excluding residents of Canada, 1,729 Baha'is filled out the question-
naire forms.    The 1936 Census of Religions identified a total United
States Baha'i population of 2,584.       Assuming that the censal figures
are accurate, one can conclude that the 1936 survey obtained responses
from almost 70 percent of all Baha'is.       Even if there were substantial
error in the 1936 census it is likely that a majority of all Baha'is
completed the questionnaire.    The sample size is ample.     There is no
way to know whether the sample is representative in all respects, but
the large sample size greatly diminishes the likelihood of severe bias.

At least it is possible to verify the geographical representativeness
of the survey responses.    Table 17 shows the distribution of respondents
and compares it to that of the total Baha'i population (as portrayed
by the 1936 Census of Religions).       With the exception of New York,
Baha'is responded to the survey in roughly equal proportions from all
parts of the country.    Even New York, with its low rate of response,
was not very deviant (almost 70 percent of the national average).         One
can conclude that the survey is geographically representative.

Most of the survey questions were clear.       Those regarding age, sex,
length of Baha'i affiliation and places of residence were so straight-
forward that inaccurate answers would almost certainly arise out of
faulty recall or intentional deception and not through misinterpretation
of questions.

bOne of the respondents failed to indicate her place of residence.

Two of the survey questions were ambiguous, however.      The question
regarding race failed to establish a clear classification scheme into
which people could fit themselves, and so some merely responded "human,"
others apparently selected one of the three traditionally recognized
major racial groups (White, Negro, or Oriental), while many differentiated
themselves on ethnic or nationalistic grounds (e.g., Jewish, Gypsy,
German).     When, for statistical purposes, I tabulated and coded the

information regarding racial stock, I adopted an arbitrary classifica-
tory scheme.    The nature of the data was such that the scheme had to
designate categories which in some instances were racial but in others
were ethnic or national.

The second inadequate question was that soliciting information
regarding previous religious experience.     It was not so much that the
wording was ambiguous; rather it was a problem of being able to
evaluate the meaning of a response.     Being a simple request for an
indication of which religious group the respondent belonged to before
becoming a Baha'i, the question failed to identify such things as the
duration and intensity of the respondent's previous religious attachment,
the length of time (if any) intervening between that previous affilia-
tion and the present Baha'i one, and the number and types of other
religious movements to which he may have belonged.     These kinds of
difficulties arise because religious orientation is a personal character-
istic, the form of which is both mutable and elusive.     Unlike age or sex,
in other words, a simple answer to a simple question is unlikely to
embody the essence of a person's religious orientation.     Nonetheless,
responses to this question were amenable to classification and tabula-
tion and could, therefore, be compared to the relative strength of
similarly classified religious groups in the total United States
population.

On the whole, the 1936 survey can be expected to furnish reliable
data.     There is one potential bias, however.   Since a substantial amount
of prestige is associated with having been a Baha'i for a long time, it
is reasonable to expect that some respondents may have exaggerated the
length of their affiliation.     One of the respondents actually claimed

to have belonged to the religion for 44 years, which is rather unlikely
since she would have had to join the movement one year before it was
introduced to North America.    In spite of this obvious inconsistency,
however, most respondents would have avoided grotesque exaggeration, if
for no other reason than to avoid being caught lying.      A few believers,
especially the elderly, might have been tempted to add one or two
years, but this should have a negligible impact on any quantitative
analysis of the information.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BAHA'I POPULATION IN 1936

Sex Ratio

The survey had a total of 1,784 respondents,       1,223 females and
561 males.    Female domination of the Baha'i sex ratio was not an
ephemeral condition.    In Mary Lesch's tabulation of believers for the
period 1893-1899, female names appeared almost twice as frequently as
male names; the exact sex ratio was 55.     Furthermore, the early Censuses
of Religions indicate that in 1906 and 1916 the ratio was 52 and 49
respectively.    Females greatly outnumbered males throughout at least the
first 43 years of the Faith's history in North America.      Furthermore,
there was a general decline in the proportion of males during that period;
the sex ratio dropped from a level of 55 in 1900 to 31 in 1936.

Until the 1940s, the religion's membership was very small (probably
never exceeding 3,000) and was subject to large fluctuations.       Increases

subsequent analyses, whenever the total number is 1,784 instead of

in membership were indicative of new declarations whereas declines must
have been caused by disaffections.     It would be interesting to know how
much the sex composition of the Faith was governed by higher incidence
of male disaffections as opposed to more frequent occurrence of female
adoptions.     It may have been a combination of both processes that caused
the very low sex ratios in those early years.

Age/Sex Structure
Figure 29 shows the age/sex structure of the Baha'i population in
1936 and compares it to that of the United States as a whole.     It is
obvious that, in addition to being mostly women, the Baha'is were
elderly.     The differences in the two age structures clearly document
that Baha'is were underrepresented in the population aged less than 35
and overrepresented in all the older age groups.    This was true for both
males and females, although the Baha'i female population was even more
heavily concentrated in the older age groups.

By disregarding the sex variable, it is possible to thoroughly
explore the degree to which proportionate Baha'i membership varied with
age.    Figure 30 aggregates males and females and shows the age specific
number of Baha'is per willion population.     It provides evidence that there
is a strong positive relationship between age and number of Baha'is per
million population.     The relationship disintegrates after age 70 but
until then the correlation is very powerful and apparently linear.        The
number of Baha'is per million population tends to fluctuate more widely
in the later years, but a line showing the trend of a five year moving
average validates the notion of a positive, linear relationship.

One might react to the age bias of the Baha'i population by
assuming that the Faith is more attractive to older people.     That would
be incorrect, however, because the population structure of Baha'i
membership in 1936 does not show age at the time of adoption.     If one
assumes that the religion is equally attractive to people of all ages,
then one can conclude that the religion's membership will inevitably show
an older age structure than the national norm.

Much of the disproportionate elderliness of the Baha'i population
was a consequence of this inescapable aging process which overtakes all
declarants and accumulates believers in the higher age groups.     But
to what extent is this the only explanation?     Perhaps in reality the
Baha'i bias towards old age was a combination of this cumulative effect
and differential age specific rates of adoption.     This proposition is
addressed by (1) assuming that the age specific rates of adoption were
in fact the same, (2) developing a simple model of the adoption process
designed to predict the 1936 age structure of the Baha'i population
under that assumptior., and (3) evaluating whether the observed and
predicted age structures show significant differences.

The age structure of the United States population did not change
much during the first four decades of the twentieth century.     Table 18
shows the proportionate distribution of people in each age group for three
different years:   1900, 1918, and 1936.   The values deviate only slightly
from the mean and so it was possible to make the simplifying assumption
that the United States age structure, as described by the mean values,
remain unchanged during the four decades preceding 1936.

> Other assumptions in the model are:
> 1.   There was no adoption of the Baha'i Faith before 1892.
> 2.   Between 1892 and 1936 the rate of adoption remained constant.
> 3.   The rate of adoption was always the same for all age groups.

4.   The Baha'i population experienced age specific rates of
attrition equal to those of the entire United States population (regard-
less of whether the attrition was due to mortality or disaffection).

5.   The Baha'i population experienced age specific rates of
immigration or emigration equal to those of the entire united States
population.

6.   The entire population of any given age category was eligible
to adopt the religion (even those who had already been converted).

Given this set of assumptions, the following procedure was used
to predict the 1936 age distribution of the Baha'i population.    First,
the mean proportion of the total United States population in any given
age group was multiplied by one more than the number of younger age
groups up to a maximum of nine.    If more than eight age groups were
younger than the one under consideration (which is the case for the
65-69, 70-74, and 75+ categories) then the multiplicant was nine.       The
result was a series of cumulative values, one for each age group, which
when summed gave what can be called a total cumulative value.    The next
step was to calculate what proportion of the total cumulative value was
represented by each age specific cumulative value.    These two steps
determined the proportion of the 1936 Baha'i population that was to be
expected in each age group.   The multiplication of age group proportions
described in the first step accommodated the cumulative effect of Baha'i
declaration in the younger years inflating the proportions of the 1936
Baha'i population in the older age groups.   Multiplying the proportions
by a maximum of nine (45 years) insured that nobody joined the religion
before 1892.

Figure 31 presents the predicted age structure and compares it with
the observed.    There is a marked similarity between the two; they are
so close to being the same that when subjected to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
one-sample test they do not show a significant difference at the .20
level.    Considering the large sample size (1,643), the two distributions
have to be very similar not to have incurred a statistically significant

difference at that. level.    It is probably safe to conclude that the 1936
age structure of the Baha'i population did not differ from the structure
of the United States population as a consequence of greater appeal and
higher rates of adoption among older people.     Rather, the age specific
rates of adoption probably were fairly comparable.     The faint tendency
of the predictive model to underestimate for the youngest and oldest age
groups (21-34 and 60-75+) and to overestimate for the middle ages
(35-59) may be the result of unrealistic assumptions.     The model could
be refined by relaxing some of those assumptions, but the effort would
be fruitless because lack of data precludes relaxation of all and any
one might be a critical factor in the formulation of the predicted age
structure.

One of the most satisfactory aspects of the predictive model is
the way in which it explains why the number of Baha'is per million should
show a steady, linear increase through all ages up to the late sixties
and then drop rapidly thereafter.     Up to age 65, each age group would
include Baha'is who declared themselves over successively longer time
periods.     After age 65, however, all age groups were equal in their
capacity to draw from the past and the governing factor became the
increasing rates of mortality.

Baha'i Affiliation
Even in the years preceding 1936 the flow of people into and out
of the Baha'i Faith was sufficient to maintain a situation where most
believers were relatively recent adopters.     Table 19 shows what proportion
of the population had been Baha'i for different lengths of time.

Over half of all Baha'is had been associated with the Faith for
less than ten years and over a third had only belonged to the movement
for under    five years.     The recent adoption of the religion by such a
large proportion of the believers suggests that the rate of adoption
may have taken a sharp turn upward during the decade preceding 1936;
either that, or the rate of abandonment declined.

However, fluctuating rates of adoption and abandonment do not
explain the slow decline in percentage of Baha'is who had been affiliated
with the Faith for more than ten years.        The gradualness with which the
percentage figures diminish for succeedingly longer periods of affilia-
tion suggests that the only forces at work were (1) growth of the American
population and (2) attrition through mortality.

Race
In 1936 most of     the Baha'is in the United States were     ~bite.

Table 20 shows that over 94 percent of all survey respondents were
Caucasian while only about 6 percent were Negro.         The preponderance of
~Vhites   over Blacks was even greater for Baha'is than for the total United
States population, with    the result that the estimated number of White
Baha'is per million was almost twice that of Blacks.         These figures tend
to confirm the prevailing Baha'i belief that until the late 1960s and
early 1970s the religion was predominantly      ~bite.

In those early years the Faith was geographically confined to a
small part of the United States.     In effect, the religion was limited
to the Northeast--extending as far west as Illinois and Wisconsin--and
California.     Within this area, the racial composition of the total
population was much more heavil} White than for the countTy as a whole.
The states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Hew York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Michigan and California, plus the District of Columbia, contained over
80 percent of all the Baha'is in the CGlliltry.      If these states are con-
sidered as the heartland of the religion in 1936, then it is possible to
make a rnore refined comparison of the Baha'i      a~d   total populations insofar
as racial composition is concerned.        Racial composition of Baha'i member-
ship in the heartland was much more representative than for the country
as a whole.     In fact, as Table 20 shows, the number of Baha'is per
million population was even higher for Blacks than for Whites in the
heartland.     However, just as reinfement using the heartland concept has
inverted the original analysis by displacing a White bias with a Black

~hese estimates were made by distributing the Baha'i population, as
indicated in the 1936 Census of Religions, according to the percentage valUES shewn
for the three racial categories.

bias, so too a further refinement using urban vs. rural populations
might reverse the balance.     Both Baha'is and Blacks tended to concentrate
in urban areas; control for this might show that the numbers of Baha'is
per million were similar for Blacks and Whites.     Be that as it may, it
is clear that in 1936 the Baha'i Faith was not overly concentrated in
the White sector of the total population.

No mention has been made of the racial category labeled "Other"

in Table 20.    This category includes people of Asian and Native American
extract.   The 1936 survey captured only one Baha'i who was classified
as "other," and so the Faith was not very representative of this portion
of the total population.     However, the united States contained so few
people who were neither Black nor White that the    e~~ected    number of such
Baha'is would be very small:    twelve for the entire United States and
only eight for the heartland.    Given the smallness of these figures,
Baha'i underrepresentation is not significant.

The White Baha'i population, comprising such a vast majority of the
religion's 1936 membership, can be broken down into a nuwber of ethnic
subdivisions.    For the United States as a whole, the 1936 survey tabulated
1,679 respondents who classified themselves as    ~fuite.   Of these, 607, or
36 percent simply called themselves "White."     The remaining 1,072, however,
indicated that they were of a specific ethnic stock.        Relying on the
specificity of their responses it is possible to reconstruct a crude
picture of what categories of Whites entered the Faith in the early years.
The breakdown in Table 21 tabulates how those 1,072 respondents classified
themselves.

These figures show that Baha'is were predominantly Anglo-Saxons.

Those who traced their ancestors to continental Europe almost invariably
claimed northern or eastern Europe as their area of origin.                 Virtually no
southern European immigrants became Baha'i.

One must keep this ethnic bias in        perspect~vc,        however.        That the
bias existed is irrefutable; that it was of such an overvlhelming magnitude
is an impression that reust be tempered by an awareness of the overall
ethnic composition of the White American population.               It is impossible
to determine the ethnic mix of the 1936       ~fJhite   population in the United
States, but one can get a vague idea of the relative importance of
various ethnic groups in the current American population.               The Statistical
Abstract of the United States:     1977 contains a table that indicates
numbers of people in the United States who claimed to be associated with
certain ethnic roots.     Part of that information is presented in Table 22.

These figures are crude and are based not on a census but a sample
survey.   Furthermore, they refer to the composition of the American popu-
lation in the 1970s, not in the 1930s.          Even so, they give a rough
indication of the ethnic composition during the interwar period.             All
the large scale migratory flows from various European countries to the
United States were completed by 1936, and the only significant recent
change that the above figures would detect is the growth of the Spanish
population as a consequence of Mexican and Puerto Rican immigration.

In 1936, therefore, the White population must have contained a heavy
preponderance of British and Irish, a large minority of Germans, and a
substantial but relatively small number of Italians.          The French would
have been a small part of the vfuite ethnic mix.         This picture meshes
well with the ethnic composition of the 1936 Baha'i population.             The
overwhelming dominance of the Baha'i Faith by British and Irish

adherents, as well as by the very large German contingent, is to be ex-
pected given the ethnic structure of the United States population.       Con-
versely, the virtual absence of Italian-American Baha'is has to be
considered in light of the relative smallness of this ethnic group in
the American population.    There is little doubt that the 1936 Baha'i
population was overrepresentative of the Anglo-Saxons and underrepresenta-
tive of the Italians, but the magnitude of this bias probably was not as
large as one might initially assume.

The general impression which remains is that the vlliite Baha'is of
1936 were heavily drawn from people of northern and eastern Luropean
extract.    This suggests that the significant variable was not race but
religion.

Reliqion
One of the questions asked on the 1936 Survey sought information
regarding previous religious affiliation.     Almost all the respondents
answered the question, but the specificity of the answers varied widely.
In particular, some respondents merely designated themselves as ex-
Christians while others took care to mention whether they were Catholic
or Protestant.    Similarly, the Protestants were inconsistent about
defining their denominational attachment.     In addition to the variation
in specificity of the survey answers, there is the problem of non-
uniform geographic distribution of religious groups in the United States,
a difficulty which was handled in precisely the same way as with race.
The heartland concept was used and statistics for both Baha'is and
total populations were refined accordingly.

Table 23 presents information that is intended to show which
religious groups were supplying the Baha'i Faith with converts.     The
figures in columns 4 and 8 tabulate the most relevant data for conducting
such an analysis.   However, both these sets of figures had to be estimated
using a number of techniques that rely on the validity of certain
assumptions.   For that reason, Table 23 presents sets of values used in,
and derived from, the estimating process; this allows the reader to
judge whether the estimating procedures are appropriate.

Column 2 tabulates the total number of responses to the 1936

survey for each category of religious belief.     The numbers show the
magnitude of the problem mentioned earlier.     Only 827 of the 1,149
Christians indicated whether they were Catholic or Protestant; only
753 of the 827 Protestants revealed their denominational origins.         In
order to improve the comparability of the numbers for the various
religious groups, it was assumed that the 74 Protestant respondents who
did not indicate a denominational origin were drawn from the different
Protestant groups in the same proportions as the 753 who did.      That
assumption allows an estimate of the number of Protestant denominations;
the results are shown in   col~n   3.   A similar assumption permits an
estimate of the specific religious background for the 249 respondents
who only indicated that they had been Christinas.      They were distributed
between the Catholic and Protestant categories, and among the various
subcategories of Protestantism according to the proportionate distribution
suggested by column 2.     The resulting estimates are tabulated in column 3
which, in turn, provides the values used to calculate the percentages in
column 5.

The 1936 Census of Religions enumerated 2,584 Baha'is in the
United States, 2,080 of whom were living in the region which has been
defined as the Baha'i heartland.         Within that same region, the 1936
survey only solicited 1,247 responses containing information about
religious origins, and so in order to estimate the number of Baha'is
in the total Baha'i population who traced their roots back to each
religious category the estiIT.ated percentages in column 5 were used to
apportion the 2,080 Baha'is among the different religions (column 6).

The figures in   col~ns   6 and 7 provide the data necessary for
calculating the Baha'is per million for different religious groups
(column 8).   The undernumeration of church mewbership in the 1936 Cen-
sus of Religions would inflate the calculations for Baha'is per million,
but this would be more than offset by the fact that mewbership figures
for all the other religions include children whereas the figures for
Baha'i membership do not.   Therefore, the values indicating Baha'is per
million in column 8 should not be taken as accurate in an absolute sense.
Rather, they are simply a convenient way to show the relative capacity of
the Baha'i Faith to draw its members from different religious traditions.
Even as relative values they are no more than crude estimates.         One can
see that calculation is based    Oll    a number of assumptions, only some of
which have been made explicit.         On8 assumption which, for example, may
be unwarranted and may sharply decrease accuracy is that all religious
bodies in 1936 had the same proportion of adults and children.

The estimates of numbers of Baha'is per million population for
different religious groups vary over a large range.         Even allowing for the
crudity of the estimates, it is evident that some religions were

more likely than others to contribute converts to the Baha'i Faith.       At
one extreme, Unitarians stood alone as that religion donating the largest
proportion of its manpower to the Baha'i cause.     At the other extreme,
Judaism and Catholicism showed strong resistance to Baha'i conversion.
Between these two extremes lay all the large Protestant denominations.
Assuming that this class of religions was the norm, the task is to explain
the extremes; why should so many Baha'is have been drawn from the ranks
of the unitarians and so few from the ranks of the Catholics anc the
Jews?

The Unitarians, stressing as they do a rejection of the concept
of the trinity, adhere to a view of Christ and God which is less distant
from the Baha'i position 2 than from the position of most other Christian
groups.     In this respect, therefore, the Unitarians find more in common
with Baha'is than with Christians.     Even more important than this
theological point of convergence is the emphasis which unitarians place
on a rational approach to faith.     This leads to a generally liberal and
open-minded attitude toward other religions which in turn suggests that
the Unitarian is more likely than most Christians to (1) hear about other
religious movements, and (2) exercise a critical objectivity when
evaluating other religious messages.     In other words, by adopting a
rational and dispassionate approach to religion, the Unitarian may be
more amenable to conversion than the member of a Christian group that

2'Abdu'l-Baha has clarified the Baha'i position regarding the
trinity. He emphasized the indivisibility of God.   'Abdu'l-Eaha, Some
Answered Questions, trans. and ed. by Laura Clifford Barney (Wilmette,
Ill.: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1957), pp. 129-131.

stresses dogma, creed, and submission to church authority.    Can it not
be said that, at least in the 1930s, Roman Catholicism was somBwhere
near the opposite extreme from Unitarianism, requiring faith in spite
of reason and stressing internal unity of the church over independent
thought?   The Catholic morality has maintained church solidarity and in
doing so has strongly inhibited defectors.    In other words, regardless
of who is courting their attention, relative vulnerability to conversion
is likely to be high for Unitarians and low for Catholics.    Furthermore,
the emphasis in the Baha'i Faith on a rational approach to religion 3
dovetails nicely with the Unitarian view and therefore exacerbates the
difference in relative susceptibility to conversion that associates with
Unitarianism and Catholicism.    Of course in more recent times revolution-
ary changes have swept Catholicism, and its monolithic structure no longer
appears as such an impregnable fortress against outside forces; in 1936,
however, the Catholic Church was still unassailable.

Judaism has interacted with the Baha'i Faith under a different set
of circumstances than those surrounding either Catholicism or Unitarian-
ism.    The long histor1 of persecution and intolerance that has been a
part of Jewish-Christian relations has generally tended to insure that

3consider, for example, 'Abdu'l-Baha's unequivocal statement:

> imaginations; for the antithesis of knowledge is ignorance, and

Jews would not convert to Christianity in any great numbers.   For what-
ever the reason, Jews did not respond positively to Christ's message in
the early years of Christian history, and subsequent events have only
served to intensify that negative Jewish reaction.   But the Baha'i
Faith requires acceptance of Christ (as well as Moses, Mohammed, and
many others) as a Prophet of God and in doing so aligns itself with
Christianity in the eyes of Judaism.   The following argument by
'Abdu'l-Baha clearly shows that Jews cannot bypass Christ in gaining
access to Baha'u'llah.

A Jew, therefore, cannot become a Baha'i without first accepting the
divine origins of a religion that has, for many centuries, isolated,
persecuted, and threatened the very existence of Judaism.   Under these
circumstances it is not surprising that conversion to the Baha'i Faith
should have been a relatively rare event.

THE 1968 SURVEY
In 1936 the American Baha'i population possessed a number of
characteristics wpich differentiated it from its host population.     The

typical Baha'i of that time was elderly, female, Anglo-Saxon, and had
been Protestant.   Some attempt has been made to explain why that should
have been so, but there has been no mention of whether those compositional
observations have persisted to the present.   It is not possible to
answer this question conclusively, but the shreds of evidence contained
in the 1968 survey strongly suggest that substantial changes have taken
place.   It is important to remember that the 1968 survey was designed
to assess the population composition of new declarants, and not of the
entire Baha'i membership.   Even so, the enormous numbers of converts
which the Faith attracted in the months immediately following the 1968
survey would rapidly saturate the Baha'i population.   That being so, one
can assume that the 1968 survey is at least crudely representative of
how the Faith must have appeared by the mid-seventies and can, therefore,
be compared with the 1936 survey.

The 1968 survey exposed an extremely young age structure among new
declarants, but certain characteristics which associated with that
youthfulness were little more than byproducts.   For example, Table 24
shows that respondents to the 1968 survey were drawn in excessive numbers
from the unmarried, student, and educated sectors of the United States
population, and yet these biases probably resulted from attracting      youth
and do not mean the Faith appealed more to single people with an academic
orientation.

The 1968 survey also examined the ethnic and religious background
of the respondents.   That information is summarized by the data presented
in Table 25.   It is evident -that by 1968 the Protestant bias of the 1930s
was giving way to a more representative mix of religious backgrounds.

a Th e percentage of breakdowns of Baha'i enrollees are based on
a survey of all people who joined the Faith in December, 1968. During
that month there were 193 enrollments:   160 of them (88%) responded
to the survey.

Catholics still were not being recruited into the Baha'i population in
proportion to   their numbers, but the gap between the expected and
observed appears to have narrowed substantially.   Also, people of Jewish
background were becoming Baha'is at a rate proportionate to their numer-
ical significance, a situtation markedly different from that which
prevailed in 1936.    The revolutionary social climate of the late 1960s
must have weakened the capacity of these two religious groups to resist
external influence.

Non-religious people were becoming Baha'is with greater frequency
than their numbers warranted.   No one knows why people do or do not
belong to a religion, but if one assumes that there is some validity
to the notion that atheists and agnostics choose to be so because they
find most religions irrational, then it may be that the logical approach
of the Baha'i Faith appeals to them.

Seven percent of all new Baha'i enrollees responded to the 1968

survey by indicating that their religious background was Baha'i.      This
is a very small part of the sample and confirms the conclusion pre-
viously reached that the Baha'i Faith still relies on conversions for
its numerical growth.

The racial composition of the new enrolless aligned very well with
the national pattern, thereby maintaining the balance which characteL"-
ized the 1936 Baha'i population; the proportionate split between Whites
and Blacks continued to be representative of the country.    As of 1968,
the Faith still was not assimilating significant numbers of people from
other racial groups--especially the American Indians and the Orientals--
but these elements remain numerically insignificant in the United States

population.   Even so, during the latter stages of the Nine Year Plan the
American Baha'is began to place increasing emphasis on reaching them.
This was in response to the specific objective of the plan which called
for the enrollment of larger numbers of Chinese, Japanese, American
Indians, Negroes, and Spanish speakers. 5    By the time of the survey in
1968, the American Baha'i community was successfully appealing to the
Blacks, but no great strides had yet been made in reaching the other
racial and ethnic groups.    Although specific figures are not available,
a survey of Baha'i activities during the 1968-1973 period attests to
substantial progress in penetrating the American Indian anu Spanish
speaking minorities, but--through its silence--implies a lack of success

In summary, it can be said that since 1936 the complexion of the
Baha'i population has undergone substantial change.     In terms of religious
and racial characteristics, it has become more representative of the
parent society; insofar as age structure is concerned, it has shifted
toward the recruitment of new members who are much younger than average.
The scantiness of recent data makes penetrative analysis difficult, but
at least it can be said that the Baha'i population in America has been
changing, that the changes have in part been stimulated by policy and
planning, and that the immediate prospects are for a religion whose
membership is not confined to a single racial group or religious
tradition.

At present it is impossible to know whether Baha'is occupy a
specific socio-economic niche; no data have yet been collected that would
allow satisfactory analysis of such variables as occupation, education,
and income.   What can be said with reasonable certainty is that if the
Baha'is are confronted with evidence suggesting a strong socio-economic
bias then the reaction will be to seek ways of recruiting converts who
will broaden the religion's socio-economic base.

CHAPTER X
PLANNED GLOBAL DIFFUSION:   1937-1964

THE BAHA'I ECUMENE IN 1937

When in 1937 Shoghi Effendi initiated the First Seven Year Plan,
global conditions were not propitious.     The lingering effects of the
Great Depression coexisted with a rising awareness that the world was
poised on the brink of war.     It is hard to imagine how those times could
have done anything but hinder the execution of a plan for Baha'i expan-
sion.    Worldly conditions, however, did not figure significantly in
Shoghi Effendi's decision about when to initiate planned diffusion.
His first concern was to establish an administrative system that could
efficiently govern Baha'i affairs and guide Baha'i growth.       His second
concern was to insure the completion of the Temple in Wilmette,
Illinois.    Only whei, the Guardian perceived that these two tasks were
nearly done did he divert the a-ttention of the American Baha'i community
to the goals of the Seven Year Plan.     That was in the spring of 1937.
The plan was designed to last for seven years so that its conclusion
would coincide with the centenary of the birth of the Faith.

When the First Seven Year Plan was launched, the Baha'i Faith
already had managed to achieve substantial international dispersion.
All continents had been touched by the religion and adherents could be
found in such antipodal locations as Hawaii and Rhodesia, England and
New Zealand, Japan and Brazil, Egypt and Tahiti.       Even so, this disper-
sion was tenuous because in most locations the Faith could count only

one or two residents.     The vast majority of all Baha'is still lived in
Persia while the majority of the rest were in North America.     The
remaining few were widely scattered, but even they were mostly confined
to the other eight existing National areas.

Table 26 shows the numbers of localities having Baha'is in differ-
ent parts of the world.     The dominant position of Persia is obvious as
is the subsidiary importance of North America.     These figures, which
count localities rather than people, actually tend to    up-derst~te   the
degree to which the     Faith was concentrated in a few key areas.     This
arises out of the fact that those National areas having relatively
large nwUbers of localities with resident Baha'is also tended to have
larger average community sizes.     Even assuming that understatement does
not exist and that the number of opened localities is an accurate
indicator of population size, the fact that there were only about 2,700
Baha'is in the United states in 1936 draws one to the tentative conclu-
sion that there must have been fewer than 5,500 Baha'is in the world
outside Persia.   If this estimate is low it would be because of
unusually large community sizes in Turkestan and the Caucasus where the
Faith established an early foothold.     Both these areas are close to
Persia, however, and could be considered as a geographic extension of
the religion's heartland.     The point is that outside the original
homeland of the Faith the number of Baha'is was very small, they con-
centrated in North America, and only an infinitesimal share resided
outside the ten organized National Spiritual Assembly areas.

In spite of their fewness, the widely scattered band of believers
living in those regions of the world not yet part of the organized

a Th e regions listed were the National Spiritual Assemblies
existing at the time.

b Th e figures for the United States/Canada may be very slightly
off because I lost one of the Xeroxed pages of the 1937-1938 Baha'i
Directory, thereby necessitating the use of figures from the 1935-
1936 Baha I i Directory which is contained in Vol. VI of The Baha'i
World.

Baha'i world had the potential to develop new nuclei for the Faith.
For this reason, it is useful to look at their distribution in 1937.
Figure 32 shows the distribution both of National Spiritual Assembly areas
and of localities outside National areas having resident Baha'is.     Al-
though it is impossible for the map to depict the distribution of
Baha'is within National areas, it does manage to give a reasonably con-
cise impression of the global distribution of the religion.

The vast majority of all Baha'is living outside National Assembly
areas were located in Europe and the Near East.     Those living in Europe
were quite evenly distributed throughout the continent, the only excep-
tional area being the Iberian peninsula.     Eastern European countries
contained a fair share of these adherents.     Of course, the concentration
in the Near     East is understandable given the historical development of
the Faith and the long-standing deposition of Baha'is leadership in
'Akka.   Other regions of the world were notably lacking Baha'is.    The
whole of Latin America could claim but one believer.     Outside of Egypt,
Africa had only a handful of opened localities, most in South Africa.
East Asia contained only a half dozen localities occupied by Baha'is.
There were no believers in Southeast Asia, and except for Hawaii and one
couple in Papeete, none in the Pacific Basin.

The overall global pattern of distribution in 1937 shows the effects
of certain historical events on the geographic growth of the Faith.        First,
there is the fact that the Faith developed in the Shi'ah enclave of the
Muslim world.     That turn of events insured that Iran would emerge as the
demographic core of the Baha'i ecumene.

Second, there was the exile of Baha'u'llah and His son to the
areas outside Persia.      That was responsible for the emergence of Baha'i
communities beyond the borders of the mother country in various nearby
regions     of the Muslim world, many of them Sunni.     In particular, this,
either directly or indirectly, caused the formation of Baha'i com-
munities in Turkey, in Palestine and its immediate surroundings, in
Egypt, in the Caucasus, in Turkestan, and to a lesser extent even in the
southwest     sector of the Indian subcontinent.     In other words, the
establishment of the Faith in areas surrounding Persia was largely the
result of the Baha'i persecution in its place of origin.

Third,    ~C~8   is the fact that 'Abdu'l-Baha targeted North America
as the region in which the Faith must first grow Western roots and from
which it must disseminate itself worldwide.        That explicit policy,
bolstered by affirmative action, led to the emergence of North America
as a subsidiary center of Baha'i strength.      The believers in that
region, though small in number by Persian standards, used their national
affluence and individual religious freedom to bring about the most
widespread diffusion of the Faith yet known.        In the process, they
helped to erect an administrative system that would reflect the wishes
of the founding figures and could handle the affairs of the religion.
'Abdu'l-Baha made North America such an important center of Baha'i
activity that, in spite of the smallness of numbers, it threatened to
eclipse Persia as the true heartland of the religion.

Fourth, the emergence of North America as a major center of Baha'i
activity precipitated a two-way flow of Baha'i migrants between there
and the established world center of the Faith near 'Akka.        That flow

followed prevailing transportation channels and in the process brought
Baha'is into frequent contact with Great Britain, France, Switzerland,
and Italy.   The result was the development of numerous small Baha'i
communities in those countries.

Fifth, the activities of a handful of key Baha'i pioneers sowed
the seeds for the eventual blossoming of a number of small and far-flung
clusters of Baha'is.    Remember that 'Abdu'l-Baha had directed certain
individuals to migrate to new areas to take up permanent residence and
promote the Faith.     Remember also that his Tablets of the Divine Plan
inspired certain other individuals to do likewise:     May Bolles went to
France (1900), Alma Knoblock to Germany and Austria (1903), Agnes
Alexander to Japan (1914), Clara and Hyde Dunn to Australia and New
Zealand (1920), Fanny Knoblock to South Africa (1920), and Leonora
Holsapple to Brazil (1924).     These individuals had a particularly strong
influence on the 1937 distribution of Baha'is outside the Muslim and
North American spheres.    All except Leonora Holsapple were able to initiate
oeasurable Baha'i growth; by 1937, Germany and Australia/New Zealand had
their own National Spiritual Assemblies while France, Japan, and South
Africa had small clusters of Baha'i communities.     Where those pioneers
settled is where the Faith grew.

Very little Baha'i growth occurred outside those areas.     A major
exception is Northern and Eastern Europe (especially Bulgaria) while a
minor exception is the three localities in China which were opened
primarily through the efforts of itinerant Bata'is--particularly Martha
Root who visited them all.     However, Bulgaria--the most exceptional of
these exceptional areas--achieved its modest preeminence through the

efforts of a pioneering settler who arrived in Sofia in 1930 and remained
until her death in 1954.     She singlehandedly developed a Baha'i presence
in that country, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that the Faith
achieved real gains only in those areas where believers settled on a
permanent basis and worked for its promulgation.     The name of the woman
is Marion Jack. 1

In summary, it can be seen that the role of individuals was para-
mount in determining where the Faith would have some representation by
1937\.    The banishment of Baha'u'llah from Persia, the preoccupation of
'Abdu'l-Baha with the potential of North America, the dedicated efforts
of a handful of Baha'i pioneers under the direction of 'Abdu'l-Baha and
the Guardian--those are the episodes that explained the geography of the
Baha'i world in 1937.

THE FIRST SEVEN YEAR PLAN:   1937-1944

The First Seven Year Plan had one main international goal:   to
establish a nucleus of Baha'i believers in every Latin American republic.
The North American community was responsible for executing the plan.
That arrangement was an attempt by Shoghi Effendi to recognize the
preeminent role in the global diffusion process that 'Abdu'l-Baha
assigned to North America.     However, world conditions and their impinge-
ment on Baha'i activities in most places also motivated the Guardian to
rely on the United States and Canada.     In a 1938 message to the American
Baha'is Shoghi Effendi portrayed the difficulties facing his religion

lA brief synopsis of her work in Bulgaria is contained in Baha'i
News, 541 (April, 1976) :5.

throughout the world and stressed the fact that North America was the
one remaining stronghold of the Faith from which dissemination to the
Latin American republics could proceed.

In addition to 'Abdu'l-Baha's directives, therefore, practical
considerations exercised an influence on Shoghi Effendi's choice of
North America as the executor of his First Seven Year Plan.    No other
Baha'i community had sufficient manpower and adequate freedom of action
to undertake the task in 1937.

The best way to review Baha'i growth during the 1937-1944 period is
to map the change in the geographical distribution of Baha'is during
those years and assess the extent to which the change fulfilled the
Latin American objectives.   If growth was substantial throughout Latin
America and was inconsequential elsewhere, then the First Seven Year
Plan can be viewed as the principal force underlying Baha'i diffusion
during that period.

Figure 33 shows the impact of the plan.   Growth was obviously con-
fined to two regions:   (1) Latin America (the target area), and (2)
Europe and the Near East.

First, it would be good to consider the nature of Baha'i change
in Europe and the Near East and to dispel the notion that substantial
growth was occurring there.     Throughout the region there did appear a
number of new localities with Baha'i residents while an almost equal
number of   locali~ies   lost the Baha'is that they had had at the start of
the planning period.     One would have to conclude that within the   rc~l0n

the apparent growth was actually nothing more than forced relocation.
Baha'is in that area were moving around, probably as a consequence of
the chaotic wartime conditions.

In contrast, Latin America definitely experienced Baha'i growth.

At the start of the planning period, there was one Baha'i in all of
Latin America; by the end of the plan there were 40 localities with
Baha'i residents.   Those localities were widely distributed throughout
the whole continent, and 23 of them were sufficiently well established
to have local Spiritual Assemblies.     The objective of the Seven Year
Plan was achieved; in fact diffusion exceeded the goal.     The impact of
the plan was so predictable that those areas of Latin America which
were not republics did not have Baha'is by 1944:     The Guianas, British
Honduras, and   the various colonial islands of the lesser Antilles.
The stated objective of the First Seven Year Plan--one Baha'i community
in each Latin American republic--so focused the dissemination efforts of
the North American Baha'is that the observed distribution of Baha'is
in 1944 fit almost perfectly with the distribution one would have
expected under the assumptions that (1) the plan objectives would be
achieved, and (2) growth would only occur if planned.

Actually, as Figure 33 shows, the Faith experienced declines in
some other parts of the world.   The National Spiritual Assemblies in
Germany, the Caucasus, and Turkestan, for example, were disbanded
because of persecution.   This contraction was r.eal for the two national
areas located in the U.S.S.R.; the Faith never recovered there and
national organizations have not existed since.   In Germany, however, the
disbandment was temporary and the integrity of the national Baha'i
community was reestablished at the end of the war in the West German
sector.

To summarize, it is apparent that international Baha'i diffusion
between 1937 and 1944 proceeded according to plan objectives and did not
occur through any significant amount of random migration and information
transfer.   Even when one looks inside the national areas the same con-
clusion is merited.   The only domestic objective of the First Seven Year
Plan was the assurance of one local Spiritual Assembly in each state of
the United States and each province of Canada.   The effects of this one
plan objective are obvious from a tabulation of local Spiritual Assem-
blies existing in each National Assembly area at the beginning and end
of the plan period (see Table 27).   Although India/Burma experienced
substantial growth in its number of local Spiritual Assemblies, even by
1943 there were only 23 (the same as Latin America).   A marginal increase
in the number of local Assemblies probably took place in Iran; elsewhere
(except in North America) significant growth did not occur.   But North
America, where a planning objective was in effect, showed large and
unmistakable expansion.

Of course the question arises as to how the First Seven Year Plan
was implemented, and the answer is the same as for preceding and sub-
sequent periods in the development of the Faith.     The most effective
method of implementation was through disbursement of settlers from North
America to the goal areas.   From 1940 onwards, the use of pioneers became
the fundamental means of achieving plan objectives.     The administration
of the Faith has taken responsibility for identifying goal localities,
exhorting believers to pioneer in those places, and maintaining an

up-to-date accounting of which ones have been occupied.     The decision to
pioneer has always remained personal, however, as has the choice of a
destination.

In the years preceding 1940, travel teaching was a more typical
form of Baha'i activity than pioneering.     In most countries, however,
the development of Baha'i groups and Assemblies did not occur until
after a pioneer had entered the area.     As early as 1921, Martha Root
visited most of the important cities in South America, and over the two
ensuing decades various Baha'is passed through parts of Latin America
proclaiming the Faith.     Despite this, by 1937 no visible headway had
been made in the region.     However, once a pioneer arrived in a country
it was usually only a matter of two or three years before a local
Spiritual Assembly would spring into existence.     This does not mean that
travel teachers were ineffective; they generated awareness of the
religion and were an important source of encouragement to the isolated
pioneers who could look forward to their brief visits and could count
on their assistance.     Pioneers, however, were indispensable to the
expansion process because (1) their decision to settle permanently and
find local employment was a sign of commitment to the surrounding popula-
tion, and (2) their continual presence insured a constant source of
knowledge about the Faith upon which new converts could draw.     Further-·
more, the longer a pioneer stayed, the more complete became her knowledge
of language, culture, and people.     This would increase her effectiveness
in bringing about conversions.

Figure 34 shows the precise distribution of localities opened to
the Faith in Latin America during the planning period and indicates for

each country the year of arrival of the first pioneer and year of
=ormation of the first local Spiritual Assembly.    Obviously, the Seven
Year Plan was responsible for insuring that Baha'i development in South
America would be highly dispersed and well balanced.     By 1944 every
republic had at least one opened locality and yet only Mexico had more
than six.    Local Spiritual Assemblies were so well distributed that the
21 existing by 1944 were located in 18 different countries.

It is evident from the map that Latin American republics usually
were penetrated via a major city.    After that, diffusion might proceed
in either a contagious or a hierarchical fashion.     In Brazil, only large
cities were touched by the Faith while in El Salvador it spread from
the capital only to nearby localities.    In Mexico both trends can be
discerned.    Whether or not subsequent diffusion was contagious or
hierarchical depended   partly on the numbers, destinat.ions, and mobility
of arriving pioneers and partly on the country's territorial size and
the maturity of its network of urban places.

THE SECOND SEVEN YEAR PLAN:   1946-1953

Conditions for Diffusion in the Post-War World
A two year hiatus followed the successful completion of the First
Seven Year Plan so that when in the spring of 1946 Shoghi Effendi
launched the Second Seven Year Plan world conditions were more settled
than they would have been if planning had proceeded without interruption.
During the interval, World War II ended in both the European and Asian
Theaters.    The end of hostilities greatly improved the potential mobility
of Baha'is bent on international dissemination of their religion, and the

post-war economic boom combined with cheap, rapid air travel to realize
that potential.

At the same time, however, the beginnings of two different processes
foreshadowed increasing difficulties for Baha'i pioneer activity.       The
first of these had an immediate and pronounced impact; the other was a
gradual development which only in recent years has become a significant
hindrance to Baha'i diffusion.   The dramatic development was the global
polarization of the communist and non-communist regions that was
precipitated by the Cold War.    The more gradual process was the decline
of political colonialism and the appearance of numerous independent
nations.

The confrontation between communism and capitalism curtailed the
flow of people and ideas between the two regions in which these
ideologies held sway.   The anti-religious stance of communism combined
with its political isolati.onism to virtually Axclude the Baha'i Faith.
Early on, communist persecution terminated organized Baha'i activity
in the Caucasus and Turkestan.   When, at the end of World War II, Eastern
Europe became part of the communist realm, the scattering of Baha'i
communities there rapidly disappeared, presumably because of isolation
and persecution.   Since then, the Baha'i Faith has been systematically
excluded from communist countries.    There are, perhaps, Baha'is remaining
in those countries, but their problems of communication, their inability
to organize, and their incapacity to openly proclaim their Faith have
thoroughly stalemated any dissemination efforts.    More recent Baha'i
growth plans have accepted this political reality by   pla~ing   most
empahsis on expansion in areas outside the communist realm.

The end of colonialism was gradual and thus had little effect on
the execution of the Second Seven   Yea~7   Plan.   In more recent years,
however, the xenophobic protectionism of many newly independent states
has made it very difficult for expatriots to obtain permanent resident
status--particu1arly if it is known that their intent is to convert the
local population to their religion.    The strategies adopted by the Faith
to   combat this problem include:   recruitment of third world nationals who
are temporarily residing overseas; encouragement of pioneers whose
ethnic, linguistic, and cultural traits are compatible with the character
of a goal area; accelerated placement of pioneers in areas where anti-
foreign attitudes are increasing; and strong encouragement to pioneers
already in the field not to leave their posts.

Problems of Analysis
It is hard to relate Baha'i expansion during the years 1946-1953

with the plan objectives which were then in force.        Even though the
American Baha'i community was executing a well defined plan that spanned
precisely this period, eight other National Assembly areas were motivated
to develop and implement growth plans of their own.        Those plans were
independent efforts undertaken by National Assembly areas that varied
widely in size of memb8rship, amount of administrative experience,
degree of personal freedom, and availability of non-human resources.           In
addition, these National plans did not span exactly the same time period
as the American Second Seven Year Plan; all ran for less than seven
years, the shortest being nineteen months and the longest six years.
All terminated before the end of the Second Seven Year Plan, but two
started before 1946 when the Second Seven Year Plan was launched.

Shoghi Effendi coordinated all these planning efforts and insured that
there were no conflicting goals or duplicate efforts.     Consequently,
global expansion proceeded in a geographically balanced fashion.     In
order to evaluate the extent to which growth conformed to plan objectives
during the period 1944-1953, however, it is obviously not enough to
consider only the Second Seven Year Plan.     It is necessarj to consider
all the other plans and determine the extent to which they too were
responsible for Baha'i growth.   This is difficult because plans began
and ended at different tliaes and data on distribution of Baha'is are
not so complete as to permit a perfect re-creation of Baha'i presence
immediately before and after each plan.     There are directories indicating
localities with Baha'i residents in 1945, 1949, and 1953--and this
information can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of each of the
many plans independently--but unfortunately the data usually do not
conform perfectly to the starting and ending points of a plan.     Further-
more, the directory for April, 1953, is defective in that it tabulates
opened localities only in those areas which belonged to a National
Spiritual Assembly.    It is necessary to work around this problem and
to accept as unavoidable the occasional gaps in information.

Plans and Achievements
Types of Territories

The time horizons and objectives of the numerous plans in force
during the years 1944-1953 were summarized earlier in Table 4.     However,
in order to address the more general issue of how planning affected
Baha'i growth, all information regarding duration of plan, methods of

implementation, and responsibility for execution will be ignored.
Instead, only dissemination objectives set for different countries and
regions will be considered in an attempt to answer the following two
questions:     Were those objectives achieved?    Was dissemination more
rapid in areas designated for Baha'i growth?

The    seco~d   of these questons recognizes two types of territories--
those where Baha'i growth was planned and those where it was not.          In
fact, it is valuable to expand this classification by distinguishing
between those areas of planned growth which were an integrated part of
an existing National Assembly region and those which were not.       There is
a reason for this distinction.       within National Spiritual Assembly
regions planned growth was intended to consolidate the existing power
base by increasing the size of membership and the number of administra-
tive units.    Outside National Assembly areas, however, plans for expan-
sion were almost exclusively concerned with dispersing the Faith.          If
statistics for the two types of territory were aggregated, the much
greater numerical weight of the Faith within National Spiritual Assewbly
regions would obscure the extent to which goals were achieved in the
numerically modest, but strategically important, "international" goal
areas.     This would be unfortunate because it is these dispersion goals
which have generated the global distribution of Baha'is.       In order to
avoid this problem, each of the three kinds of territory will be
analyzed separately.

Some confusion arises out of the fact that plans frequently specified
dispersion goals specifically designed to open areas in National Assembly
regions where Baha'is were either absent or scarce in 1945.       In these

instances, even though they belonged to National Assembly regions, the
areas were considered as "international" goal areas.

National Spiritual    A~sembly   Areas

When the Second Seven Year Plan began in the spring of 1946 there
were eight National Spiritual Assemblies:       (1) the United States and
Canada, (2) the British Isles, (3) Germany and Austria, (4) Egypt and
the Sudan, (5) Iraq, (6) Iran, (7) India and Burma, and (8) Australia
and New Zealand.     The Second Seven    Year Plan called for the creation of
three new National Assemblies, all in the Western Hemisphere.       Canada
was to become     independent in 1948; in 1951 the whole of Latin America
was to be organized into two National regions (Central America and
South America).     Furthermore, the successful dissemination of the Faith
in Europe permitted the creation of a fourth new National Assembly in
1952:     Italy and Switzerland.    Thus, by 1953 the number of National
Spiritual Assemblies had been increased from eight to twelve.       Of the
four new ones, however, only Canada was formed early enough to develop
and execute its own plan.     Nine National areas, therefore, participated
in the planned diffusion efforts pursued during the period 1944-1953.

Table 28 summarizes the local Assembly goals and achievements for
each National Assembly area during the period 1945-1953.       One can see
that in many instances plans called for very large increases in the
numbers of Asseriblies.    The British Isles and Australia/New Zealand, for
example, proposed to more than treble their numbers, while Canada, Iraq,
and India, Pakistan, and Burma intended to at least double theirs.          Only
the United States, Iran, and Egypt had plans requiring relatively modest
increases.

The relative ambitiousness of different plans depended on many
things.    Any national area with few Assemblies (such as Australia/New
Zealand) normally would be concerned with affecting a large increase
in the number of Assemblies so as to insure the integrity,         and broaden
the electoral base, of the National Assembly.3         Countries with relatively
large numbers of local Assemblies in 1945 would not be so concerned with
this since their National bodies already had strong foundations.
Furthermore, a country having numerous overseas goals (especially the
United States) would not have such ambitious plans for domestic expansion
since available resources were limited.       Also, the capacity of a country

3 Se e, for example, Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World,

to increase its number of local Assemblies would depend on the number of
localities having groups.    If there are many groups, then the creation
of new Assemblies only requires the expansion of existing Baha'i com-
munities.   If, on the other hand, there are few opened localities, then
the formation of a new Assembly may require the relocation of one or
more Baha'is to a previously unopened locality and the increasing of
membership until the size of the new   co~~unity   reaches nine.   This was
part of the reason why the British Isles was able to entertain the
possibility of more than trebling its number of local Assemblies while
Egypt and the Sudan could only propose a slight increase; Britain had
30 localities with groups in 1945 whereas Egypt and the Sudan only had

\[10\] As for the actual levels of achievement, it is apparent that in
all but two instances National Spiritual Assemblies exceeded, matched,
or nearly met their objectives.    The two exceptions were Iraq and Iran
where religious suppression prohibited substantial gains and caused
those countries to fall short of their domestic goals.      At the other
extreme, Germany/Austria managed to achieve much greater expansion than
planned.    It may be that a demoralizing defeat in World War II made the
German population more receptive to non-traditional religious influences
such as the Baha'i Faith; a similar phenomenon occurred in the United
States immediately following the Vietnam War.

Iraq, Iran, and Germany aside, National Spiritual Assemblies tended
to increase their numbers of local Assemblies exactly as planned.       Over-
achievement and underachievement were on a relatively minor scale, and
in general the number of Assemblies specified as an objective for a given

country was a good predictor of the number that materialized by 1953.
This suggests that Baha'i growth plans established the religion's rate
of expansion and molded the geographic expression of its diffusion.

International Goal Areas

A number of widely distributed territories were targeted either for
initial penetration or for expansion of their very small Baha'i popula-
tions.     There were in all 44 such territories, 30 of which had no resident
believers whatever and 14 of which contained Baha'i populations ranging
in size from a minimum of one to a maximum of about 10-15 (most of these
14 territories, however, contained only one or two Baha'is).

Table 29 lists the 44 targeted territories and shows for each:    (1)
tl~   numbers of localities having local Assemblies and groups in 1945,
(2) the numbers of Assemblies and groups specified as objectives for
1953, and (3) the actual numbers of Assemblies and groups achieved by
1953\.     A cursory examination of the table will confirm that objectives
were achieved in 41 of the 44 territories.

It should be remembered that the intention in these areas was not
to enroll large numbers of believers.     Rather, it was to establish
Baha'i communities which could act as sources for later diffusion.       Much
has been made of the fact that the Faith has relied heavily on this
diffusion strategy, but until now there has been no way of evaluating
iL~   effectiveness.   Has the creation of small Baha'i cowmunities
strategically placed around the world actually been effective in dis-
persing the religion to any substantial degree?     Historical experience
permits a positive response.     Whereas in 1937 there was only one Baha'i

residing in all of Latin America, and North America contained 100 percent
of the local Spiritual Assemblies in the Western Hemisphere, by 1953
the picture had changed.     Despite rapid growth in Canada and the United
States, Latin America haa expanded its Baha'i membership to the point
where     it contained over 12 percent of all Western Hemisphere Assemblies.
Furthermore, the redistribution process which the plan initiated has not
lost momentum.     By 1973, over 65 percent of all local Spiritual Assemblies
in the Western     Hemisphere were located in Latin America.

Therefore, the modest goals that were set for the 44 international
areas identified in Table 29 were more significant than their numbers
would suggest.     Even though in most cases plans only called for the
creation of one group or Assembly, this first step initiated an unpre-
cedented redistribution of the Faith.     In fact, the achievement of
objectives in 41 out of 44 territories set the stage for later expansion;
by 1973 those same 44 territories contained more thQn 4,000 local
Spiritual Assemblies.

Planned vs. Unplanned Growth

One can conclude that the Baha'i Faith successfully executed its
plans during the period 1944-1953.     Furthermore, supplementary evidence
has been presented which strongly supports the idea that planning has
been an effective tool for stimulating both demographic and geographic
growth of the Faith.     Of course, it is impossible to be conclusive since
there is no way of knowing what would have happened without planning.
However, the numerous territories which were not targeted for expansion
during the years 1944-1953 can be viewed as a control group against which

growth in the 44 goal areas can be compared.                   Table 30 summarizes this
comparison.

The figures speak for themselves.                 In spite of the obvious advantage
enjoyed by areas not targeted for growth in 1945, the targeted areas
experienced much more rapid expansion by 1953.

Europe and Africa

Of all the plans that were prosecuted between 1944 and 1953, two
in particular were devoted primarily to international goals that would
further the cause of dispersion.                 The Second Seven Year Plan was
designed to initiate " . • . systematic teaching activity in war-torn,
spiritually famished European continent, . . • aiming at establishment
vf Assemblies in the Iberian Peninsula, the Low Countries, the

Scandinavian states and Italy . . . . ",4 while the two year African plan
was concerned with establishing the Faith in a number of East, West,
and Central African territories.     Since Europe   and Africa were the
setting for the most serious dissemination efforts during the early post-
war years, it makes sense to observe in detail the geographic expression
of Baha'i growth in those two regions.

Figure 35 portrays the patterns of Baha'i growth in Europe between
the years 1945 and 1953.     The map understates the degree to which the
Faith was concentrated in the two National Spiritual Assembly areas
(British Isles and Germany/Austria).     Outside those two areas all
localities having Baha'is in either 1945 or 1953 are shown.      Inside,
however, lack of space required that only localities with local Spiritual
Assemblies in either of the two years be plotted.

It is evident from Figure 35 that the Faith was making no headway in
Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R.     Baha'i communities managed to survive
in Leningrad, Prague, Budapest, and Sofia, and one new outpost was
established in Warsaw.     This was the meager extent of Baha'i represen-
tation in the communist realm, however, as World War II and the     ensuiJ~9

decade eradicated most of the gains made during the interbellum period.
During the war, the Faith experienced substantial contraction in a number
of Eastern European countries.

In particular, Rumania, Bulgaria, and East Germany were affected.

In the 1920s, Martha Root travelled extensively in Eastern Europe and

managed to form a number of Baha'i communities.     She was most success-

1n t e re 1"1910n. 5   Bulgaria, it will be remembered, was opened
by a pioneer named Marion Jack; by 1939 she had succeeded in converting
people in eight different localities.      These early Baha'i outposts in
Rumania and Bulgaria were gone by 1945 and one can only conclude that
by the end of the war the early believers were either dead, deported,
displaced, or disillusioned.     At any rate, by 1945 only in Sofia, where
Marion Jack continued to reside, did the Baha'i Faith still have
representation.     In East Germany, groups existing in a few localities
before the war had disappeared by 1953.      In summary, it is apparent that
the political climate of the region made it impossible for the Baha'i
Faith to survive.

A second observation about the patterns portrayed in Figure 35 is that
they reinforce the conclusion that the religion grew rapidly in those
areas targeted for expansion but made little headway elsewhere.      The
only exception is France where five groups carne into existence.     It is
not surprising that France should be an exception.     Except for European
Turkey, the earliest European Baha'i community was there.     A number of
experienced, dependable Baha'is must have resided there at the end of
World War II, some of whom would have responded to the challenge of the

Second Seven Year Plan by trying to broaden the base of the religion in
their homeland.    It is interesting that Shoghi Effendi did not call for
any specific activity there when he announced his Second Seven Year Plan.
In 1946 France was the European territory with the greatest potential
for organization as a National Spiritual area; it contained four groups
and a local Spiritual Assembly.      AnG yet the Guardian saw fit to specify
goals that placed priority on stimulating growth in other areas of
Europe--those areas with few or no Baha'is.       This decision exemplifies
the Baha'i preoccupation with dispersion in the early stages of the
diffusion process.

Figure 36 presents information about Baha'i growth in Africa during
the years 1945-1953.     As with the map of Europe,    concentrat~on   in a
National Spiritual Assembly area--in this case Egypt and the Sudan--
is understated because of       the cartographic impossibility of accurately
locating groups.

Africa is vast, and, as Figure 36 shows, most of it was untouched
by the Baha'i Faith in 1945.      Outside of Egypt and the Sudan, ther'       was
only one Assembly:     Tunis.   Ethiopia, Eritria, Kenya, the Belgian Congo,
Rhodesia, and South Africa each had one group.        This was the limit of
Baha'i presence--about 25 Baha'is in seven centers in an area of about
11\.5 million square miles.      Eight years later the Faith was still a
very minor presence on the continent, but at least by then many political
units had some Baha'i residents and a dispersed network of localities
were poised to stimulate the continent-wide explosion that would occur
in the ensuing decades.

Africa differs from Europe in that expansion was not confined to
goal areas.   All goal areas were opened, but so were a number of other

territories which lay outside the purview of the Africa Plan.      To some
extent this can be explained by the fact that the Africa Plan was
successfully ended in 1952, leaving Baha'is in the goal regions free to
turn their attentions to other untouched areas of the continent.      Further-
more, the dramatic success of the religion in Uganda and, to a lesser
extent, in Kenya and Tanganyika, created a pool of new Baha'is whose
racial and cultural background better fitted them for the task of
spreading the religion on the continent.     By 1954 Uganda was a signifi-
cant source of manpower for work in the other parts of Africa. 6     Even
before 1953, some of those native pioneers may have opened parts of
Africa not included in the Africa Plan.

Uganda experienced rapid growth.     In 1950 it could not claim a
single Baha'i resident, yet three years later it was a major center of
the religion in Africa.    It has been impossible to discern why the Faith
should have been so successful in this one territory while expansion
elsewhere on the continent proceeded sedately.     Perhaps a separate study
focusing on Baha'i development in Uganda would yield an explanation.         The
historical materials necessary for such an undertaking were not readily
available. 7   Whatever the explanation, Uganda is not a unique case.
There has been a tendency for the Faith to grow in local spurts.      It
~appened   in Bolivia in the 1950s and 1960s; it happened in South Carolina
in the early 1970s; it happened in the Philippines in the mid-1970s.

> 6Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World, p. 62.

The Africa Plan made Britain responsible for developing Uganda,
and so the Baha'i archives in the United States were not useful.

Outside Uganda, Baha'i growth was most noticeable in South Africa.

This was not a goal area in the Africa Plan, and yet between 1950 and
1953 ten localities were opened.    One suspects that there may have been
a number of Baha'is already in the country who, although inactive in the
years preceding the Africa Plan, were brought back into the mainstream
of the Faith by the optimism, enthusiasm, and purposefulness of newly
arrived Baha'is.    South Africa, after all i was first opened by Fanny
Knoblock before 1920, and throughout the quarter-century preceding the
advent of the Second Seven Year Plan, Baha'i communities existed con-
tinuously in that country.

In April, 1953, the Baha'i Faith stood at a critical point.   Shoghi
Effendi's two Seven Year Plans had been consummated and the geographical
limits of the Baha'i ecumene had been extended to the outer reaches of
the inhabited world.    It is true that in communist countries the Baha'i
outposts were few in number, widely scattered, and of questionable
durability, but that was the situation in many other regions of the world
too.    In a sense, by 1953 the religion had achieved a global distribution
(see Figure 37).

In many areas, however, the Baha'i footholds were so tenuous that
their permanence was highly questionable.    Outside its core ar£as, the
Faith was spread so thin that stability was out of the question; either
the religion would capitalize on its far-flung network of immature com-
munities by using them as centers for more growth or else the centers
would die out and the Baha'i ecumene would contract, probably retreating
to its traditional core areas in Iran, North America, and India.

Contraction was the only alternative to growth because most of the
Baha'i outposts were staffed by only one or two believers, many of whom
suffered the additional disadvantage of being elderly foreigners.        In
such circumstances, the Baha'i presence could only be perpetuated by
attracting new believers or by importing adherents from elsewhere; ot.her-
wise, mortality ultimately would eradicate the Baha'i presence.

By so thoroughly committing the Faith to global expansion, there-
fore, the Guardian had ordained that at least in the short run the
religion would be pursuing an objective of such grand proportions that the
outcome could only be overwhelming success or staggering failure.        Either
way, the psychological impact would be enormous and probably would have
very important long-term implications for the development of the Faith.
To the agnostic, the Guardian's decision might be seen as a gamble,
pure and simple.   To the businessman or social scientist, he might seem
to be engaging in a calculated risk.      To a Baha'i, however, Shoghi
Effendi was merely performing an act of faith by giving expression to his
grandfather's description of the religion's destiny.

At any rate, by 1953 the religion    ~as   approaching a vulnerable stage
in its geographical development.      The immediate future would bring either
consolidation of its   far-fl~~g   network or contraction of its ecumene.
But Shoghi Effendi did more than precipitate this historical watershed
in Baha'i affairs--he magnified it by formulating a Ten Year Plan that
called for even greater dispersion.      Consolidation through the process of
converting new believers was to be realized, but only after pioneers had
been dispatched to an unprecedented number of new localities.       In 1953
the Baha'i world embarked on a new campaign that was truly global in
scope and far more ambitious than the two preceding plans.

THE TEN YEAR PLAN:   1953-1963

Objectives of the Plan
In October, 1952, Shoghi Effendi forwarded a cablegram to the
twelve existing National Spiritual Assemblies alerting the Baha'i world
to the Ten Year Plan that soon would be guiding their activities: 8

Feel hour propitious to proclaim to the entire Baha'i world
> the projected launching • • . fate-laden, soul-stirring, decade-
> long, world-embracing Spiritual Crusade involving the simul-
> taneous initiation of twelve national Ten Year Plans and the
> concerted participation of all National Spiritual Assemblies of
> the Baha'i world aiming at the immediate extension of Baha'u'llah's
> Spiritual dominion as well as the eventual establishment of the
> structure of His administrative order in all remaining Sovereign
> States, Principal Dependencies comprising Principalities,
> Sultanates, Emirates, Shaykhdom's, Protectorates, Trust Territories,
> and Crown Colonies scattered over the surface of the entire planet.
> The entire body of the avowed supporters of Baha'u'llah's all-
> conquering Faith are now summoned to achieve in a single decade
> feats eclipsing in totality the achievements which in the course
> of the eleven preceding decades illuminated the annals of Baha'i
> pioneering. 9

The Guardian then went on to explain that this global campaign would have
four main objectives:

. . • First, development of the institutions of the World
> Center of the Faith in the Holy Land. Second, consolidation,
> through carefully devised measures on the home front of the
> twelve territories destined to serve as administrative bases for
> the operations of the twelve National Plans. Third, consolida-
> tion of all territories already opened to the Faith. Fourth, the
> opening of the remaining chief virgin territories on the planet
> through specific allotments to each National Assembly functioning
> in the Baha'i world.lO

8Actually, the Guardian had been preparing the Baha'i world for the
prospect of a new and more ambitious plan ever since November, 1951. The
Baha'i World: 1954-1963, XIII, pp. 246-247.

9Sl10ghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World, p . 41.
lOIbid., pp. 41-42

In this and succeeding messages Shoghi Effendi laid out in detail what
were to be the specific goals of each National Assembly's Ten Year Plan.
That information was compiled and organized by Beatrice Ashton whose
tabular presentation of plan goals was published in 1954. 11     Her efforts
have simplified the task of extracting the numerous National goals
directly relevant to this diffusion study, in particular, those concerned
with:     (1) opening new territories,   (2) creating new National Spiritual
Assemblies, and (3) increasing the numbers of local Assemblies and opened
localities.    These kinds of goals were only a part of the entire Ten
Year Crusade, however, and this must be kept in mind when evaluating the
extent to which the Faith achieved them.

Shoghi Effendi guided the Baha'i World toward a phased completion
of its ten year undertaking, and in doing so established the principle
that the first year of the planning period should be devoted to opening
all new territories.     Immediately thereafter, priority was to be given to
strengthening the administrative system by increasing the numbers of
local Assemblies and opened localities and by forming new National
Spiritual Assemblies.     In the latter half of the planning period emphasis
was to shift to increasing the numbers of believers. 1 2

The Virgin Territories
A total of 131 new territories were to be opened during the Ten Year
Plan.     In fact, because of the way in which the Guardian sought staged

completion of the plan, this objective was to be completed during the
first year of the plan--between April, 1953 and April, 1954.   Table 31
lists the territories that were assigned to each National Assembly area
and indicates when, if ever, the Faith reached them.    It can be seen that
100 territories were opened the first year, 20 more were penetrated
before the end of the plan, while eleven were never opened.    In other
words, 76 percent of the virgin territory goals were achieved on schedule
while an additional 15 percent were achieved before the end of the
Crusade, yielding an ultimate success rate of 91 percent.

All the territories that were not opened and a third of those that
were opened late were located in the c:ommunist bloc.   The Cold War
political environment obviously was the most effective barrier to total
achievement of plan objectives.   The 13 other territories that were
opened after the first year of the Ten Year Crusade were widely scattered
throughout Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.   They tended to be
extremely isolated, but so were many of the territories that were
successfully opened during that first year.   One can only conclude that
the non-communist territories opened late were random occurrences and
that Baha'i tardiness in reaching them was not an expression of some
general barrier to diffusion.

Figure 38 identifies the locations of the 131 territories that were
to be opened, shows National Assemblies to which they were allocated, and
indicates whether or not they were successfully penetrated.    The map
reveals the extent to which the distribution of territories was truly
global; there was a dearth of goal territories only in those areas
already occupied.   There seems to have been little regard for population

density in this distribution.     Rather, dispersion was stressed to the
exclusion of any other consideration.     In fact, many territories are
notable only for their geographical isolation and demographic insignifi-
cance.     The united States, for example, which at the time could claim no
more than 7,500 believers, was expected to spread the Faith to such
obscure places as Spitzbergen, St. Helena, Sakhalin, Andorra, Tonga, and
Reunion.     Unless all were geographers, it is unlikely that many American
Baha'is would even have heard of such places before the Guardian directed
them to go there in 1953.     The names of the 131 goal territories read
like a list of the least important places in the world.     What better
evidence is there of the Faith's preoccupation with dispersion?

Most National Spiritual Assemblies were assigned goal territories
which were relatively close in either the geographic or political sense.
(Great Britain was allocated eleven territories, for example, five of
which were nearby and the other six of which were British colonies
overseas).    The one main exception to this generalization is the United
States which was assigned almost twice as many territories as any other
National Spiritual Assembly.    Almost all were geographically distant
and only a few were politically or culturally affiliated.     The United
States, therefore, was in the position of having to overcome greater
distances than any other National Assembly area.    Furthermore, it had to
do so with a Baha'i population that, although larger than that of most
National areas, was much smaller than the Baha'i population in Iran and
probably was less than that in India, Pakistan, and Burma.

Of course, the United States capacity to diffuse the Faith was much
greater than its numerical significance to the religion would suggest.

This already has been discussed.    Still, it is surprising that Baha'is
from the United States were responsible for attaining an even larger
share of the Ten Year Plan goals than they were awarded.   As Table 31
shows, the United States was instrumental in settling many of the goal
territories that were actually assigned to other National Spiritual
Assemblies.   Just as 'Abdu'l-Baha had envisioned, the American Baha'is
were the ones who excelled in distributing the Faith around the world.

The extent to which the United States filled other National
Assemblies' goals raises the interesting observation that a substantial
part of all objectives that were assigned during the Ten Year Plan were
not accomplished by the National Assemblies to which they had been
allocated.    In most cases, the United States took the initiative, but
a number of other National Assembly areas also opened territories that
were not assigned to them.   This was possible because of the global
orientation and cooperative attitude which historically have character-
ized the Faith.   Shoghi Effendi ensured that Baha'is, regardless of
their National areas, would be aware of, and collectively responsible for,
all the goals assigned to all National Assemblies.    As a result, an
individual Baha'i would not hesitate to fulfill a goal merely because it
happened to be the administrative responsibility of another National
Spiritual Assembly.    This principle of shared responsibility has
improved the potential of the Faith to meet its own objectives since
the higher efficiency that results from a (geographical) division of
labor has not been accompanied by the usual subdivision of available
resources which such a strategy typically implies.    Instead, any National
Spiritual Assembly has been able to draw on the resources of the entire

Baha'i world when attempting to achieve one of its designated plan
objectives.   This transcendence of National Assembly area boundaries
also reinforces the global outlook of Baha'is, thereby strengthening
the religion's inherent concern with world unity.

New National Spiritual Assemblies
Unlike virgin territories which can be considered opened as soon
as one Baha'i is present and unlike local Spiritual Assemblies which
are formed as soon as there are nine adult believers, the prerequisites
for the creation of a new National Spiritual Assembly have always been
somewhat vague.   The basic principle has been that within a proposed
territory there must be a body of believers who are sufficient in number
to accommodate the election process required in selecting a National
Assembly, and well enough versed as Baha'is to permit the selectIon of
qualified leaders. 13    This is a reasonable guideline, but it obviously
permits a highly flexible determination of when a territory is ready
for National status.     In fact, however, a territory tended to be
organized as a National Spiritual Assembly area as socn as it had a few
local Spiritual Assemblies.

Table 32 shows the numbers of Assemblies and other opened local-
ities that existed in the eleven territories that first elected National
Assemblies in 1962.     The   f~gures   indicate that a National Assembly was
likely to be formed as soon as a territory had four local Assemblies.

l3 I n Baha'i parlance, a qualified person is one who ". . . can
best combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of self-
less devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognizee ability and mature
experience . . . . " Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration, p. 88.

Sometimes a National administrative body would not appear until there
was a rather larger number, but even then there were likely to be fewer
than a dozen.   Sri Lanka and Switzerland were contradictory, but it must
be remembered that those countries were exceptional because they were
already part of organized National areas, a situation that diminished
the urgency of organizing them as independent units.

The Guardian was eager to see the rapid formation of new
National Spiritual Assemblies because it would broaden the electoral
base for the proposed Universal House of Justice.   For that reason, as
soon as a territory possessed what he perceived to be a minimum Baha'i
presence he arranged for the formation of a National Assembly.     Because
of the highly personal way in which this decision was made, it is

virtually impossible to scientifically analyze the process whereby a
multiplication of National Spiritual Assemblies was effected.     Nonethe-
less, a comparison between those territories in which the Guardian
planned to organize National Spiritual Assemblies during the 1953-1963
period and those which were so organized during that time highlights
the degree to which the administrative development of the    F~ith   con-
formed to his conception.    Table 33 lists the territories which Shoghi
Effendi planned to organize as National areas, shows the extent of Baha'i
presence within their boundaries at the beginning of the plan period, and
tabulates the new National Assemblies actually formed during the Ten
Year Plan.    Once again, the vision and the ultinate reality are nearly
equivalent.    Naturally, the fact that Shoghi Effendi was responsible for
both planning and organizing new Nationa] Assemblies meant that there was
found to be a high correlation between the expected and the achieved
pattern of growth.   The fact that the correlation approaches perfection,
however, indicates that Shoghi Effendi's will was so strong that it over-
rode all external conditions that might have operated to favor the
formation of a different set of National Assemblies.     The potency of his
will is even more evident when one recalls that he died in 1957, five
and a half years   before~~e   end of the Ten Year Plan and well in advance
of the formation of most of the Assemblies he had envisioned.

The creation of new National Spiritual Assemblies was the
culmination of a staged progressioL that was latent but obvious in Shoghi
Effendi's three closely interlocking plans.     The first stage was the
penetration of a major region, such as a continent, by a small band of
pioneers who establish a widely scattered network of Baha'i nuclei.          The

NOTE: At the start of the Ten Year Plan there were 12 National Spiritual
Assemblies: Canada, U.S., Great Britain, Germany/Austria, Italy/
Switzerland, Egypt/Sudan, Iraq, Iran, India/Pakistan/Burma, Australia/
New Zealand, Central America and South America. During the course of the
plan, three of these were dissolved and replaced by a multiplicity of
National Assemblies. In addition, the territories of some of the other
nine National Assemblies were trimmed down by this same process of sub-
division. Alaska was partitioned from the United States, Austria from
Germany, New Zealand from Australia, and Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan
from India. Counter to this trend, the National Assembly of Egypt/Sudan
expanded its territorial domain to include Abyssinia, Eritria, Libya,
Socotra, and British, French and Italian Somaliland. The territorial
growth made it necessary for that National Assembly to be referred to as
North East Africa instead of Egypt/Sudan. All the changes outlined here
plus the changes shown in the table meant that by the end of the Ten Year
Plan there were 56 National Spiritual Assemblies.

aNational Spiritual Assembly was created by subdividing a larger
National Assembly.

bNational Spiritual Assembly was formed in a territory that was
targeted for growth in the preceding Second Seven Year Plan (1946-
1953).

second stage was the consolidation of the region through multiplication
of   th~   number of occupied localities, a process that usually resulted
in the formation of a large regional National Assembly that loosely tied
together the entire region.     Finally, in the third stage the rate of
Baha'i growth was encouraged throughout the region so that it could be
partitioned into a number of smaller National Assembly areas.      This
three-stage development pattern was most clearly exemplified by Latin
America, but its structure was also evident in Europe. 14     The Ten Year
Plan took the Baha'i Faith to the third stage in Latin America and
Europe while conducting an expansionist campaign in the first and second
stages throughout most of the rest of the world.

Figure 39 shows the geographic distribution of National Spiritual
Assemblies by the end of the Ten Year Plan.      It is evident from the map
that Latin America and Northern and Western Europe were the areas where
most new organization took place.     Furthermore, one can see that through-
out the rest of the world new National Assemblies were either of the
large regional type (indicating achievement of the second stage in the
development process) or were simple fragments of the old National

14AS the Guardian had intended, three regional National Spiritual
Assemblies were created in Europe midway through the Ten Year Plan:   (1)
Scandinavia and Finland, (2) The Benelux countries, and (3) the Iberian
Peninsula. By the end of the planning period these regional bodies had
been replaced by nine National Spiritual Assemblies, one in each country

(The Baha'i World: 1954-1963, XIII, p. 274). Furthe~ore, the par-
titioning of the two huge regional National Assemblies of Latin America
did not occur in a single step. First the two Assemblies were par-
titioned into four regional National Assemblies (1957). Then a few
years later (1961) the four regional bodies were displaced by National
Assemblies in each country (The Baha'i World: 1954-1963, XIII, pp.
257-258).

Assemblies whose existence preceded the initiation of the Ten Year
Crusade.   What is obvious, therefore, is that the successful execution
of the two Seven Year Plans laid a foundation for a thorough consolida-
tion of the Baha'i ecumene in (1) Latin America, (2) North and West
Europe, and (3) the original National areas.   It is further evident that
the Ten Year Plan not only succeeded in bringing about this consolidation
but also managed to extend the margins of the Baha'i ecumene so as to
include most other non-communist regions and prepare them for imminent
partition into numerous National Spiritual Assemblies.

Opening New Localities in the

Old National Assembly Areas

Within the regions existing as National Assembly areas at the start
of the Ten Year Plan, the Guardian designated specific increases to be
effected in the numbers of local Spiritual Assemblies and opened
localities.   In addition, he identified a similar objective for the ten
European countries targeted in the Second Seven Year Plan.   Table 34
tabulates these goals and compares them with the actual achievements by
1962, one year before the end of the Ten Year Plan.   As the table shows,
he generally called for a doubling of the number of local Spiritual
Assemblies, the key exceptions being Italy/Switzerland and the ten
European countries--areas where the Faith was less well developed and in
which the Guardian wanted to see a fourfold increase in the numbers of
Assemblies.

Table 34 also indicates that in all but three areas the Ten Year
Plan objectives were achieved by 1962.   Iran, Iraq, and Egypt/Sudan had

a NO Baha'i directory is available for the year 1963-64, and so it
was necessary to use data describing the extent of the Faith one year
before the end of the Ten Year Plan.

b Th e figure excludes Alaska which in 1953 was part of the United
States NSA.    Including Alaskan NSA's, the figure is 337.

c Th e Ten Year Plan did not specify a goal for Jamaica which in 1953

also was part of Central America's NSA.    In tabulating the g0al number,
and actual number of local Assemblies, therefore, it was assumed that
Jamaica was part of the Central America NSA and was expected to maintain
the three Assemblies it had in 1953.

d Th e Ten Year Plan also called for a doubling of the total number
of opened localities.

e Th e Ten Year Plan also called for a trebling of the total number

f Ne a r the end of the Second Seven Year Plan, growth was sufficient
to pe!.mit the formation of the new National Assembly of Italy/Switzerland.
At that time, the Guardian selected Finland and France to take their
place in the list of the Ten European Goal countries.

not yet attained their goals, but their apparent underachievement is a
false impression created by the lack of available data on numbers of
local Spiritual Assemblies in 1963, the year the Ten Year Plan really
ended.   The unavoidable use of 1962 data to represent achievement during
the plan underestimates the total amount of growth in all National
Spiritual Assembly areas--not just Iran, Iraq, and Egypt/Sudan.           The
underestimation is likely to be substantial since the Baha'i world
typically exhibits a burst of energy in the last year of a planning period.

Anyhow, the three National areas in question did achieve their plan
goals.   Isolated sources indicate that by 1963 Iran had managed to double
its number of local Spiritual Assemblies,15 Iraq had surpassed its goal
by reaching a total of 16,16 and Egypt/Sudan probably had exceeded the 20
Assembly goal set for it. 1 7

Since all areas were successful in meeting plan objectives, there
is no underachievement to explain.          Most National areas either met or
slightly exceeded the goals set for them, but a few areas wildly sur-
passed their plan objectives:         (1) India, Pakistan, and Burma,   (2)
Central America, and (3) South America.           These three are sufficiently
remarkable to merit special attention.

Growth in India, Pakistan, and Burma was even more explosive than
Table 34 indicates.         By 1959 both Pakistan and Burma had partitioned,
leaving only India where, after 1959, the Baha'i explosion occurred
(consider the figures in Table 35).

Only two years before the end of the Ten Year Crusade, India was
disastrously short of achieving its objective.        During those final two
years, however, there was a meteoric rise in the fortunes of the Faith.
Between February, 1961, and February, 1963, Baha'is were doubling their
numbers every four months, suggesting an annual growth rate in excess of
800 percent.

Why did the religion experience this enormous burst of growth?

A similar phenomenon was detected in Uganda in the early 1950s, and
preceding discussions have shown that a parallel development was to occur
in South Carolina in 1970.    In both instances, such short-lived spurts
of unprecedented growth proved difficult to explain; the Indian case is
equally mysterious.    Perhaps a narrative of the sequence of events
leading to this mass conversion will help to provide some understanding.

This astounding progress started with a conference in a
> remote village of Samgimanda in the State of Madhya Pradesh
> in Central India in January, 1961. The Faith had already
> been established there. When i t was learned that Hand of the
Cause Rahmat'u'llah Muhajir had arrived in Bombay, a teaching

> project was organized and a group of teachers, in company with
> Dr. Muhajir set out for Madhya Pradesh. Upon learning that Dr.
> Muhajir desired to hold a conference, word was sent to the
> Spiritual Assembly of Samgimanda. The report of the Secretary
> of the National Assembly of India described the events as
follows:

"When the Baha'is started for Sangimanda on foot and in
> bullock carts, they did not knuw what was awaiting them.
> The approach to the mud huts of the village was decorated
> with simple colored papers. A number of villagers came
> out several miles to receive their guests. By firing gun-
> shots they proclaimed in the traditional way that important
> guests were coming to the village. Women, in groups, were
> chanting welcome songs and hymns. Amid the beating of the
drums, booming of guns and devotional songs, cries of

'Alla'h-u-Abha and Baha'u'llah Jai' were heard. Children of
> the Baha'i school, over sixty in number, lined up to receive
> the Hand of the Cause. The conference was publicized within
> a few hours and attracted over 300 people. In spite of
severe cold, this congregation continued well past midnight.

It was cold, dark and midnight, but nobody wanted to leave.

> The Message of God was so attractive, soul-stirring and
> inspiring that they sat spellbound. Representatives from
> neighboring villages did not leave the place until they were
> assured by the Baha'is that they would send somebody to their
> places to give to the people the reassuring and hope-fostering
> Message of God."

During the next two years, over 210,000 copies of books and
> booklets about the Faith were distributed in India and, in addition,
> many heard of Baha'u'llah through simple postcards depicting the
> teachings--over 332,000 of them were given out. Hundreds of meetings
> were held, and everywhere the glad tidings were warmly received.
> What happened in India was a literal fulfillment of the Guardian's
> prediction that the last phase of the Crusade would witness "an
> upsurge of enthusiasm and consecration before which every single as
> well as collective exploit associated with any of the three pre-
vious phases, will pale. "18

From this description it is possible to derive a few ideas about
preconditions and initiators of rapid Baha'i growth.   First, it seems
that an established Baha'i community with a functioning local Spiritual
Assembly must be present in an area before explosive expansion can occur.
This does not mean that such presence will insure growth; it only means

18 I b i d., pp. 298-299.

that without them rapid expansion is unlikely.     In support, the above
narrative leads one to suspect that Dr. Muhajir's effectiveness relied
at least in part on the organized follow-up of a permanent group of local
believers.

Second, it would appear that a single magnetic personality can be
instrumental in bringing about rapid expansion.     In this instance, Hand of
the Cause Dr. Muhajir must have galvanized the local Baha'i community with
his presence and influenced the general populace with his words.        This is
only a likelihood, not a certainty, but it iterates the theme of individual
effectiveness that was explored in some detail when discussing the role
played by Dr. Khayr'u'llah in the formation of the American Baha'i
community before the turn of the century.

Third, the use of aggressive methods in diffusing the Faith seems
to reap substantial harvests.     In the early years of the religion in the
West, Baha'is rarely approached the public by confronting total strangers.
Believers either directly communicated the Baha'i message to people whom
they knew personally or generally broadcast information about the religion
in a public forum where no one was singled out.     However, the more
aggressive strategy of approaching strangers individually was employed
in India during the high growth period, and in South Carolina in 1970
a similar method was used.    This strategy, which has come to be referred
to as mass teaching, appears to be capable of generating remarkable
results.     As a consequence, over the past decade mass teaching has become
an accepted form of Baha'i propagation and in numerous instances it has
been consciously employed to generate conversions in targeted areas. l 9

19Directions regarding the utilization of mass teaching are contained
in Universal House of Justice, Wellspring of Guidance, pp. 31-36.

The other two National areas in which Baha'i growth thoroughly out-
stripped the planning goals were Central and South America.   Table 34
reveals, however, that the explosion was not widely distributed but was,
instead, confined to two smaller subregions:   Bolivia, on the one hand,
and Panama and Costa Rica on the other.   There is not sufficient pub-
lished information to trace in detail what happened in those two widely
separated regions, but it is known that, at least in Bolivia and Panama,
the rapid influx of new believers consisted primarily of native Indians.

For many years the Faith had been preoccupied with the task of con-
verting aboriginal Americans.   In 1947, near the beginning of the Second
Seven Year Plan, Shoghi Effendi appealed to the American believers in
the following way:

Particular attention, I feel, should, at this juncture, be
> directed to the various Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants
> of the Latin replililics, whom the Author of the Tablets of the
> Divine Plan has compared to the "ancient inhabitants of the
> Arabian Peninsula." "Attach great importance," is his admonition
> to the entire body of the believers in the United States and the
> Dominion of Canada, "to the indigenous population of America.
> For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the
> Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Muhammad, were
> like unto savages. When the light of Muhammad shone forth, in
> their midst, however, they became so radiant as to illumine the
> world. Likewise, these Indians, should they be educated and guided,
> there can be no doubt that they will become so illumined as to
> enlighten the whole world." The initial contact already estab-
> lished . . . with [various Indian tribes] . . . should, as the
> Latin American Baha'i communities gain in stature and strength,
> be consolidated and extended. A special effort should be exerted
> to secure the unqualified adherence of members of some of these
> tribes to the Faith, their subsequent election to its councils,
> and their unreserved support of the organized attempts that will
> have to be made in the future by the projected national assemblies
> for the large-scale conversion of Indian races to the Faith of
> Baha'u'11ah. 20

20Shoghi Effendi, Citadel of Faith, pp. 16-17.

When in 1953 the Guardian launched the Ten Year Plan, he continued to
encourage teaching efforts among American Indians.                       His convention
message to the American Baha'is that year stated that the United States
community must take responsibility for converting members of leading
Indian tribes and for translating Baha'i literature into ten different

Indian languages.                As a result, efforts to spread the Faith in the
Americas were strongly oriented toward reaching the native American
population--so much so that by 1963 eighty-nine different Indian tribes
were represented in the Faith, a quarter of all Canadian Baha'is were
Indian, and a majority of the believers in Latin America were aboriginal
Americans. 22

When explosive growth begal1 in Bolivia and Panama, therefore, the
degree to which it occurred within the Indian sector of the population
was neither accidental nor unexpected.               The magnitude of the growth was
startling, however.              In Bolivia, the first Indian Baha'i declared himself
in April, 1956.         By 1960 there were over 900 Indian believers and by
April, 1963, the figure was approximately 8,000. 2 3                     Similarly, in Panama,
a total Baha'i population of less than 125 enrolled 377 new believers
between April, 1961, and April, 1962.              One year later, Panama had a
Baha'i population of around 1,500, most of whom were Indians located in
the San Blas islands. 24

The rapid expansion of the religion in Bolivia and the southern part
of Central America iterated the pattern detected in Uganda and India

and foreshadowed events in South Carolina.   Why should these five areas
have experienced rapid Baha'i growth that begins almost instantaneouslj,
endures for a relatively short time, and then diminishes?     Perhaps a
consideration of what the five examples do and do not have in common
will shed additional light on the subject.

First, consider what these high growth regions do not have in
common.   They are not geographically confined to a particular part of
the world or to a specific political, cultural, or ethnic milieu.      Thus
it seems unlikely that variables associated with these sorts cf con-
siderations trigger the high growth phenomenon.

Furthermore, the examples cited did not occur at the same time;
rather, they happened at widely spaced intervals between 1950 and the
mid-1970s.   In fact, the explosive multiplication of the numbers of
Baha'is in Persia during the l840s, in Turkestan during the l880s, and
in the northeastern United States in tl!e late l890s, shows that the
phenomenon cannot even be labelled a modern development.    This suggests
that rapid Baha'i growth has not been the consequence of prevalent
ideas and values associated with a given era in human history.

Looking now at the commonalities, there is the fact that the rapid
growth always seems to start quickly, to last briefly, and then to fade.
This pattern suggests that a certain alteration in the way Baha'is
diffuse their religion may suddenly stimulate declarations.     Perhaps the
adoption of a mass teaching technique or the sudden appearance of a
particularly inspiring Baha'i spokesperson initiates the growth.     Long-
term continuation of the rapid growth rate may not be possible because
of the need to assimilate recent declarantsi the new believers become so

numerous that the problem of cementing their attachments to the Faith
requiras the community to shift its concern from external expansion to
internal consolidation.

Also, the spurts of Baha'i growth consistently occur in rural areas.

This has been so in all modern instances, although the regions of very
rapid expansion in early times (Persia, Turkestan, and the Northeastern
United States) were characterized by the opposite trend of quick growth
in urban centers.   It will be recalled that Shoghi Effendi implied that
urban places undermine spirituality thereby generating an anti-urban
attitude within the Faith.   It could be argued that this bias has tended
to make the Faith more effective with rural people.   One cannot help
feeling, however, that there may be something to the Guardian's notion
that urban materialism crushes spirituality and creates a population that
is less receptive to a religious message.   I must admit that I favor this
latter view, but that leaves unexplained the occurrence of explosive
growth in urban regions during earlier periods in the Faith's history.

The Status of the Faith at the

End of the Ten Year Plan
By the end of the planning period the Faith had grown to such an
extent that it was no longer feasible to map its distribution by
plotting all the localities where Baha'is resided.    Whereas in 1953 there
were about 2,850 occupied localities, by 1962 this number had increased
to 11,115.   Furthermore, by 1964--one year after the end of the Ten Year
Plan--the number of opened localities had reached 15,186, of which 4,566
were local Spiritual Assemblies.

Table 36 summarizes the growth of the religion between 1953 and
1964\.     The Ten Year Plan ended in April of 1963, but statistics on the
numbers of opened localities are available only for April, 1962 and
April, 1964.     The table exposes two pronounced trends, the most obvious
of which is rapid growth.     Between 1953 and 1964 there was more than a
six-fold increase in the number of local Spiritual Assemblies.          The
increase in the number of National Spiritual Assemblies and in the number
of opened localities (which includes local Assemblies) was almost as
great, exceeding 500 percent in both cases.

The numerical significance of North America in the Baha'i ecumene
plummeted between 1953 and 1964.     At the beginning of the Ten Year Plan,
North America and Iran totally dominated the statistics, but by 1964
other regions had surpassed both in importance.      Iran still could claim
to have far more believers than any other country, but insofar as opened
localities are concerned, the relative positions of North America and
Iran declined precipitously.

The relative decline of Iran is not obvious from Table 36 because
statistics are presented for continents, not countries.       In fact, in
1953 Iran contained 307 local Spiritual Assemblies and 629 opened
localities.     Comparison with the table will document that thls represented
about 80 percent of the totals for the continent of Asia.       By 1964, how-
ever, Iran had only managed to double its figures, and its proportionate
share of the totals for Asia had dropped to about 30 percent.

The decline in the relative si.ze of the North   ~nerican   membership
can be seen by comparing American growth to that of other continents.
Membership statistics are not commonly available, but isolated sources

already cited indicate the approximate numbers of Baha'is in a handful
of countries before and after the Ten Year Plan.       Table 37 compares them
with the United States (which contained almost all the North American
believers).    Although the American Baha'i population grew during the
ten year period, its rate of growth was overshadowed by those of India,
Bolivia, and Panama.     Of course, these particular countries were remark-
able because they did grow so quickly, but even if it were possible to

compare the United States with some other countries the figures in
Table 36 indicate that membership growth probably was less in North
America than on any other continent.     It is hard to escape the con-
elusion that by 1963, the North American Baha'is were no more than a
small minority of all non-Persian Baha'is.     In fact, this is a virtual
certainty since the ratio of opened localities having local Spiritual
Assemblies to the total number of opened localities is as low for North
America as for any other continent.     This being so, the average popu-
lation size of a North American Baha'i community would be unlikely to
exceed that for any other continent.     If the assumption is made that--
outside Iran--the average size of a Baha'i community is the same for all

continents then it can be estimated that North American Baha'is would
represent only 15 percent of the (non-Iranian) Baha'i world.

By the end of the Ten Year Plan, therefore, 'Abdu'l-Baha's vision
had been realized.   When he inherited leadership of the religion from
his Father, the ecumene was confined to the Muslim realm.      His intention
was to firmly establish the Faith in North America, and then use that
core of strength to diffuse the Baha'i message to the entire world.
This is precisely what happened.     Between 1893 and 1937, North America
became the only substantial Baha'i center outside Persia.      After 1937,
Shoghi Effendi orchestrated a global diffusion process that emanated
from that North American source, and by 1963 the process was so advanced
that all the other continents could claim National Baha'i communities of
sufficient size to challenge   OT   surpass North America.   The Guardian's
daring commitment to the principle of dispersion had been vindicated.

CHAPTER XI
THE NINE YEAR PLAN:        1964-1974

A CRISIS IN LEADERSHIP

In 1957 Shoghi Effendi died, and that precipitated a major crisis in
the religion's historical development.           The Faith had always possessed
strong leadership whose authority Baha'is everywhere had recognized as
legitimate and unchallengable.        Furthermore, the future structure of
Baha'i administration had been clearly defined by Baha'u'llah and His
son, 'Abdu'l-Baha.    The Guardianship was to be a perpetuating institution
wit~   each Guardian appointing his own successor.         The Universal House of
Justice, as yet unformed, was to be an ongoing institution as well, with
the Guardian as its head.     ~he   prerogatives and responsibilities of
these two institutions were explicit and complementary:            the Guardian
being the infallible interpreter of        sacred scripture, the Universal
House of Justice being the final authority regarding all issues not
addressed by the holy writings.        The crisis was brought on by the fact
that Shoghi Effendi failed to designate a successor, and the Universal
House of Justice, for which he had labored for over thirty years, had
not yet been called into being.        In other words, the Faith was suddenly
stripped of its leadership.

In these circumstances, Baha'is accepted the de facto          asslli~ption   of
leadership by the twenty-seven living Hands of the Cause of God who had
been appointed by the Guardian Lefure his passing.             The Hands of the
Cause, whose recognized role was (and continues to be) the protection

and promulgation of the Faith, guided the Baha'i world to a        ~'   , -ful
conclusion of the Ten Year Plan, coordinated the early election of mah"
of the National Spiritual Assemblies called for by the plan, and arranged
for the election of the Universal House of Justice in April, 1963.

Considering the circumstances, their provisional leadership during
the six-year period of transition was a masterful mix of assertion and
humility.   On the one hand, they successfully maintained the religion's
unity of purpose and direction during a time when there was no recognized
leadership; on the other, they assiduously avoided arrogating spiritual
authority to themselves (they even declared themselves ineligible for
election to the Universal House of Justice).      They used the writings
of Shoghi Effendi, 'Abdu'l-Baha, and Baha'u'llah to explain every
decision they made and they frequently stated that their actions were
only provisional and would be subj ect, to   ~-eview   by the Universal House
of Justice after it was   elected.

No matter how astute their leadership, however, the Hands of the
Cause could not avoid a crisis.      Baha'is had grown to accept the idea
that the Faith could not function without the Guardianshipl and so when

IShoghi Effendi himself induced this attitude:

> "Divorced from the institution of the Guardianship the World
> Order of Baha'u'llah would be mutilated and permanently deprived of
> that hereditary principle which, as 'Abdu'l-Baha has written, has
> been invariably upheld by the law of God. . . . Without such an
> institution the integrity of the Faith would be imperiled, and the
> stability of the entire fabric would be gravely enuangered. Its
> prestige would suffer, the means required to enable it to take
> a long and uninterrupted view over a series of generations would
> be completely lacking, and the necessary guidance to define the
> sphere of the legislative action of its elected representatives
> would be totally withdrawn."
Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 148.

Shoghi Effendi failed to designate a successor, many were disconcerted by
the awesome gap between expectation and reality.     To make matters worse,
in 1960 one of the most prominent of the Hands of the Cause--a man who
had been a dedicated and active Baha'i since 1899--claimed that he was
the second Guardian.   This man, Mason Remey, managed to attract the
allegiance of a small part of the Baha'i following, but by the time of
his death in 1973 (at the age of 100) his group of followers had been
demoralized by a series of internal power struggles.     However, this small
splinter group does continue to exist. 2

The dilemma was resolved in 1963 when the Universal House of Justice
was elected; its leadership was accepted.     Even during the crisis years,
however, the religion maintained its diffusion momentum.     It was during
those years, for example, that mass conversions occurred in India,
Bolivia, and Panama.   There are three reasons why the religion continued
to expand.   First, there was the Ten Year Plan itself which, by explicitly
defining a direction for Baha'i activities, lessened the need for day-
to-day guidance between 1957 and 1963.     Second, there was the rational
and humble approach to leadership on the part of the Hands of the Cause
which helped the believers to avoid lapsing into a state of doubt and
indecision regarding the truth and vitality of their religion.     Third,
there was the prospect that the Universal House of Justice soon would be
formed, and that permitted the rank and file to look forward to an end to
the uncertainty.

followed the Guardian's passing, see Johnson, "An Historical Analysis of
Critical Transformations in the Evolution of the Baha'i World Faith,"

ORIGINS AND DIRECTIONS OF THE NINE YEAR PLAN

The election of the first    D~iversal   House of Justice coincided with
the end of the Ten Year Plan, after which the House of Justice deliber-
ated for a year before presenting the Baha'i world with a new plan for
expansion of the Faith.   The product of its efforts--the Nine Year
Plan--embraced the same philosophy, furthered the same policies, and used
the same tactics as the Guardian's preceding planning efforts.       There
were a few shifts in emphasis, however.

Until the end of the Ten Year Plan, the need to create an adequate
foundation for the eventual election of the Universal House of Justice
had obliged the Guardian to structure his plans in such a way as to place
priority on the formation of National Spiritual Assemblies.       Once the
Universal House of Justice was elected the need no longer existed.
Actually, the Nine Year Plan did call for the formation of many new
National bodies, but that was intended to broaden the electoral base of
the Universal House of Justice.    The real focus of the Nine Year Plan
was to increase the number of Baha'is by stimulating balanced global
expansion of the number of opened localities.       Even the opening of virgin
territories, a prime objective in the three preceding plans, was in a
subtle way a lower priority than growth pure and simple.       It was not that
concern with dispersion had corne to an end; the Nine Year Plan specified
70 new territories to be opened and 24 lapsed territories to be reopened.
It was rather that these goal areas, as well as the National Spiritual
Assembly formation goals, were overshadowed by the objectives specified
for expanding the numbers of local Spiritual Assemblies and opened
localities around the world.     Like all its predecessors, the Nine Year

Plan was designed to further the three policies of geographical dis-
persion, numerical increase, and compositional diversity.      But now the
emphasis was to be less on dispersion and more on growth and diversity.3

In keeping with this shift, analysis of the Nine Year Plan will
concentrate on numerical growth instead of dispersion.      It would be
appropriate also to address the issue of compositional diversity, but
the types of goals designated to pursue tilis are    insufficie~tly   precise
to allow a rigorous statistical comparison of goals and achievements.

TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BAHA'I WORLD IN 1973
By 1973 the Baha'i world had been organized into 113 National
Spiritual Assemblies encompassing almost all significant territories
outside the Communist sphere.   The remainder of the world was partitioned
into 74 territories, 66 of which were the responsibility of various
National Spiritual Assemblies but   wer~   not part of any Assembly area.
The remaining eight areas were unallocated.      Figure 40 shows the dis-
tribution of these three kinds of territories.

The eight areas left untouched by the Nine Year Plan included
China, North Korea, North Vietnam, Algeria, Iraq, Burundi, Gabon, and
Israel.   The first three were inaccessible to the Faith because of the
isolationist policies which their governments pursued in the 1960s and
early 1970s.   They apparently contained no Baha'is in 1973.     Algeria and
Iraq were unallocated territories because all organized Baha'i activity
had been banned by 1973, however both countries had substantial Baha'i

communities; there were 19 opened localities in Iraq and 22 in Algeria.
BULundi had a well-developed Baha'i community (47 opened localities by
1973) and for three years it was part of a National Spiritual Assembly
that included Rwanda.   In 1972 Burundi even attained independent National
Assembly status, but during that same year internal disturbances pre-
cipitated a dismantling of all Baha'i administrative structures.     I have
not been able to ascertain why Gabon was unallocated in 1973 when it
had eight local Spiritual Assembli8s.   Until 1972 it was part of a National
Assembly area, but then it apparently had to be disassociated.     Israel
has never been targeted for administrative development and statistics
regarding the presence of Baha'is in the country have been withheld.
The Faith is particularly anxious to maintain its World Center there
because of the many sacred Baha'i sites.   For this reason, it has avoided
developing a visible administrative structure that might seem threatening
to the Jews.

Figure 40 shows that the 66 allocated territories not integrated
into National Assemblies consisted of two types.   On the one hand, there
were the communist lands of Russia and Central Europe.    On the other,
there were widely scattered, thinly populated, highly isolated island
groups and miniature states.   Territories of the first type are large in
geographical extent and significant in population size.    Territories of
the second type are not.   Penetration of the communist regions may have
to await a more favorable political climate, but the near future should
see the gradual formation of National Spiritual Assemblies in most of the
small, scattered places.

Many of the allocated territories were in the list of virgin areas
that were targeted by the Nine Year Plan.        They were, therefore, the
regions of the world where Baha'i dispersion occurred between 1964 and
1973\.     However, Table 38 shows that population growth was most impressive
in National Spiritual Assembly areas.        Since growth, rather than dis-
persion, is the focus of this chapter, the subsequent analysis will con-
sider Baha'i activity only in the organized National Assembly areas.

METHOD OF ANALYSIS

For each of the 113 National Spiritual Assembly areas there are
statistics on the nlliuber of local Assemblies and opened localities (1)
existing in 1964, (2) set as goals by the Nine Year Plan, and (3) actually
achieved by 1973.     In addition, it was easy to compile statistics in-
dicating the size (in square miles) and population of each National

Spiritual Assembly area.     These bits of information were amassed,
tabulated, and punched on computer cards.

Among these 113 National areas there are nine which received special
treatment.    Frequently, a National Assembly encompassed more than one
country.     When that happened, the Nine Year Plan   us~ally   set separate
goals for each country in the National Assembly region, and later statis-
tical reports on the progress of the Faith would tabulate goals and
achievements in those territorial subunits.     In such cases, consideration
was given to subdividing the National Assembly region.       There are two
circumstances which were considered justification for making this sort of
division:     (1) if the National Assembly area contained countries with
obvious, substantial differences in the concentration of Baha'i presence
(as measured by the number of opened localities in 1973), and (2) if the
National Assembly area consisted of political units that were widely
separated.    With these two criteria in mind, I decided to subdivide nine
National Assembly areas, creating nine new ones and raising the total
number from 113 to 122.

Once the data were ready, the following questions were posed:        Do
the Baha'i achievements in 1973 reflect the goals that were set in 1964?
Do   the goals set in the Nine Year Plan call for a uniform growth rate
everywhere or do they specify differential growth rates that will re-
distribute the Baha'i population?

PLANNING GOALS AND ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENTS
A simple correlation that treats planned number of local Spiritual
Assemblies as the explanatory variable and actual number of Assemblies
in 1973 as the dependent variable yields a high correlation coefficient:

+.99.     This statistical test, without further analysis, allows the con-
clusion that Baha'i    achiev~uents   in 1973 accurately reflect the 1964
goals.

There is much that can be done to refine and qualify the conclusion,
however.     What, for example, is the slope and intercept of a regression
line describing the relationship between the two variables and what is
the geographic pattern of the high residuals in that regression?

Both the dependent and independent variables consist of values that
are highly skewed in favor of the lower quantities.      For this reason it
is appropriate to normalize the distributions by subjecting them to
logarithmic transformations.

Figure 41 is a scatt8r diagram which describes the   rel~tionship

between the two variables after their case values have been logarithmi-
cally transformed.     The figure reveals a powerful relationship.   Because
of the logarithm transformation, the correlation coefficient has dropped
to +.91.     This is still extremely high, however, and the r 2 value in-
dicates that 82 percent of the variation in the dependent variable can be
accounted for by the independent variable.

The calculated regression line that has been drawn through the
scatter of individual points has a slope which is slightly less than one
(+.95).    The intercept, however, is above the x axis (+.204), indicating
that, on the average, the Faith achieved numbers of local Spiritual
Assemblies that exceeded the objectives.      The slope would suggest that
this tendency is more marked for National Assembly areas with small
objectives.

For all 122 areas, the religion surpassed its goals by about 23
percent.     This is documented in Table 39 which also shows that National

Ass~bly     areas with small goals were more likely to overachieve by sub-
stantial margins.

Figure 41 contains a line that describes the theoretical notion
lying behind this discussion--namely, that the Faith will achieve exactly
the goals set (this line must have an intercept of zero and a slope of
one).     The relationship of the points in the scatter diagram to this
line describes a salient feature of the Baha'i diffusion process.       The
fact that so few points lie below the line shows the importance which the
Baha'i world places on achieving its goals in all areas.     Within any
given National Assembly area enormous effort is made to insure that at
least the established goal is achieved.     As a result, only 14 National
areas fell short of their planning objectives.     By comparison, 19
managed to reach exactly the number of local Spiritual Assemblies that
the Nine Year Plan had assigned.

Since planning has been the most important explanation of why the
Faith grew to the levels that it did in each of its National Assembly
areas, it is more logical to analyze deviations from the line describing
a perfect match between goals and achievements than it is to consider
residuals from the calculated regression line.     Figure 42 maps the
achievement levels of the 122 National Assembly areas, showing for each
the degree to which it exceeded or fell short of its assigned goal.       It
is important to realize that this map depicts neither the amount nor the
rapidity of growth during the Nine Year Plan.     Rather, it shows how
successfully each National Assembly area responded to its 1964 planning
goal.

The distribution of National Assembly areas that did not accomplish
their objectives confirms a trend that has already been mentioned:     the
religion has difficulty in communist countries and in the Sunni Muslim
world.   In both instances, prevailing beliefs and current political
conditions discouraged growth of the Faith.     Of the 14 National Assembly
areas that did not reach their goals, seven were so handicapped:     Cuba,
Northwest Africa, Tunisia, Egypt/Libya, Sudan, Arabian Peninsula, and
Indonesia.

Of the seven remaining National areas that failed to fulfill their
plan objectives, six came so close that their deficits were quanti-
tatively insignificant.    Only Angola fell seriously short.

The National Assembly areas that exceeded their objectives by wide
margins tended to distribute in a random fashion in Africa, Asia, and
the Pacific.   To a disproportionate extent, however, they were present
in Latin America and absent in Europe (both Iceland and Ireland barely
qualified in the higher category in Figure 42).

The lack of surplus achievement in Europe draws attention to the
fact that no highly industrialized, heavily urbanized country in the world
(with the exception of New Zealand) outstripped its plan objectives.
Perhaps urban places are less receptive than rural areas to a spiritual
or religious message.     Perhaps the clarity of local political boundaries
effectively reduces the number of territorial subunits that qualify as
localities in the Baha'i meaning of the word.     Perhaps the relatively
early establishment of the religion in most such regions resulted in
their being treated as source areas for the diffusion process during the
Nine Year Plan.   Whatever the explanation, all industrialized countries
reached their goals, and so the issue is not serious.

The prevalence of overachievement in Latin America is a particularly
noticeable characteristic of Figure 42.   The religion's success throughout
this region is attributable to the same forces that operated in India
during those two years of explosive growth in the early 1960s. 4   Accounts
of the Faith's progress in the individual National areas of Latin America
document that, almost without exception, the introduction of aggressive
mass teaching campaigns aimed at a particular group or locale resulted
in very large numbers of conversions (by Baha'i standards) and in a sur-
plus of local Spiritual Assemblies.   Often, as had been the case in
India, the mass teaching movement was stimulated by the visit of a Hand
of the Cause of God or some other renowned Baha'i. 5   An extract from the
progress report of one National area--El Salvador--can stand as an
example of the typical sequence of events throughout Latin America.

"      The early years of the Nine Year Plan," the National

4Actually, the explosion in India never really subsided. During the
years 1968-1973, 157,000 new Baha'is were enrolled and today there are
reported to be over 500,000 believers in the country.

This report highlights the recurrent theme of Baha'i expansion:
spasmodic growth, generated by a handful of inspirational leaders, that
increases the number of believers at such an unprecedented pace as to
inundate the original established community.   It also points out a new
element in the Baha'i diffusion formula.   By capitalizing on a particular
event or situation, the Faith often effects sudden growth.    In the
case of El Salvador, the event was an international fair.    Elsewhere it
might be a local holiday, a public service broadcast (on radio or

6I bi d., pp. 212-213.

television), or a festival.       Baha'is frequently try to disseminate
information about their religion by any legitimate vehicle that contains
the potential for public exposure.       If the Toa._rnasters organization is
having a meeting, for example, the local Baha'i community is likely to
recruit a believer with an interest in      speecr~aking   to participate by
giving a speech on some aspect of the Faith.       If there is a par ade ,
the Baha'is will enter a float.       If there is a "swap meet" or second-
hand sale, the Baha'is -will take their unwanted items, sell them, donate
their profits to the Baha'i fund, and distribute religious pamphlets
in the process.     One particularly effective strategy involves conferences.
Held frequently, they almost invariably draw together Baha'is from many
different lands.     Usually staying fur three or four days, the believers
will use their free time working together in groups to approach the
local population with the Baha'i message.       Often the conference is
designed to encourage dissemination of the Faith and usually the days
immediately following the end of the conference are a time of intense
effort to spread the Faith locally.        In May of 1971, for example, there
was an internationdl conference held in Kingston, Jamaica.          "      . More
than 1200 believers from twenty-nine countries attended and more than
500 new believers embraced the Faith during the three days.,,7

THE NATURE OF PLAN OBJECTIVES

In spite of deviations from the average, Baha'i growth during the
period 1964-1973 was largely determined by the National objectives
spelled out in the Nine Year Plan.        That being the case, it   1S   natural

to wonder whether the objectives were designed to promulgate a uniform
growth rate everywhere in the world.

Without hesitation one can answer that the goals did not call for
the same growth rate in all National Assembly areas.    There were, in
fact, enormous variations in the relative amount of growth expected
from one National area to the next.    The figures in Table 40 show
the scope of this variety.

It can be concluded that the structure of the Nine Year Plan
enc~uraged   a redistribution of Baha'i strength.   Although relocation of
a few Baha'is was to playa key role in the redistribution process, most
of tile quantitative change would have to come from National differences

in the adoption rate.     In other words, the Baha'i Faith planned to
obtain more converts in some parts of the world than in others.        But
now the question is, Which parts of the world were targeted for more
(or less) rapid growth and why were they chosen?

The first thought that comes to mind is that the Faith would plan
to expand more rapidly in areas of previous success and would expect
to grow less rapidly where pr.ior expansion had been slow.    In other
words, the Baha'i Faith would plan self-growth in much the same way that
the king ruled his realm in St. Exupery's story of The Little Prince:
whatever his people wanted to do, that was what the king commanded.          By
adhering to this dictum the king found that he was an absolute monarch
whose word was law.     By following a similar sort of stratesy, the
Univcysal House of Justice could vastly improve the likelihood of giving
to the Baha'i world a planning doc'nnent whose objectives would be
realized.   It is virtually impossible for any planning authority to
avoid behaving at least in part like the king.     Failure to do so is
unrealistic.   But on the other hand, simple-minded implementation of the
king's strategy is an admission of powerlessness to change the world.

The Nine Year Plan does not contain any striking evidence that
objectives were based on preceding growth experience.     India and Bolivia
--two regions of rapid expansion during the Ten Year Plan--were given
above average goals, but Panama and Costa Rica, other high growth
regions during the 1950s and early 1960s, were expected to grow slowly
during the Nine Year Plan.

It would be desirable to test the proposition that Baha'i planning
goals were based on previous growth experience, and thus were only

apparently, and not really, effective in directing expansion of the
religion during the period 1964-1973.       Unfortunately, for two reasons
it is not possible to quantitatively evaluate the legitimacy of this
view.     First, there is a data problem.    The numbers of local Spiritual
Assemblies were so small in 1953, at the beginning of the Ten Year Plan,
that many of the 122 National areas now being considered had none.           In
those instances it would be impossible to derive a reasonable growth
index which could be used to compare expansion during the years 1953-
1963 with anticipated expansion during the years 1964-1973.       Second, and
more important, there is the conceptual problem.       The whole idea under-
lying a comparison of goals with preceding actualities is to determine
whether external forces lying outside the control of the religion and
molding its geographical growth were simply accommodated by the Nine
Year Plan.     The problem here is that growth was not unplanned in the
years preceding 1964.     Baha'i expansion has been governed by specific
plans that date back to 1937, at which time most of the world had no
local Spiritual Assemblies.

There is a strategy that can be used to test the notion that
preceding growth experiences did not dictate plan objectives.       If it can
be shown that planning goals were set largely in accordance with some
other principle, then one can assume that the Universal House of
Justice was not behaving in the same way as St. Exupery's king.        But
what other principle might have guided the Universal House of Justice to
adopt different growth rate objectives for the 122 National Assembly
areas?     There is one possibility.   Because of the religion's historical
concern with dispersion, the Universal House of Justice may have embodied

this enduring policy in its Nine Year Plan objectives.       The most logical
expression of that policy would be planning goals which require more
rapid expansimn in areas with few Assemblies.       The working hypothesis,
therefore, is that a National area with few Assemblies in 1964 would be
expected to multiply their nillnbers by a greater amount than a National
area with many local Assemblies in 1964.

In order to test this hypothesis it is necessary to measure the
ambitiousness of plan objectives in each of the 122 National areas.       This
presents a problem because 14 National areas contained no local Spiritual
Assemblies in 1963.   In those instances, it is impossible to say that the
plan called for a certain percentage increase in the number of local
Assemblies because the expectation of any increase will result in an
infinitely high growth rate.   In order to circumvent this problem, the
following index was used:

A - a

A
> I   index of plan ambitiousness
> a   number of local Assemblies existing in 1964

A   number of local Assemblies required by the Nine Year Plan

Rather than using a measure that looks at the number of new
Assemblies required relative to the number existing in 1964, this index
notes the number of Assemblies to be achieved by 1973 and determines
what proportion will have to be new.       This strategy sidesteps the
problem of zero denominators and infinite growth rates, but in the pro-
cess it introduces a new difficulty.       Whereas the traditional index based
on a notion of percentage increases over a past level can take on any
positive value, this new index is limited to a maximum value of one.

The result is that the intervals between equally spaced values represent
increasingly large quantities as the index approaches one.     Table 41
compares traditional percentage values with the corresponding index
values, thereby graphically portraying the nature of the problem.

Although the distortion introduced by the structure of the index
tends to skew the distribution of scores in favor of high values, this
is advantageous because it rnesh6s well with the extreme negative skew-
ness of the distribution for the independent variable (number of local
Assemblies in 1964).     Because the hypothesis is that an inverse
relationship exists between number of local Assemblies in 1964 and the
index of plan ambitiousness, the existence of negative skewness for one
and positive skewness for the other means that a high level of corre-
lation is mathematically possible.

However, the potential for high correlation is not realized.     The
calculation of a correlation coefficient yields an r value of -.16, and

that is too close to zero to be meaningful. 8    Consequently, I rejected
the hypothesis and concluded that the local Assembly goals set by the
Nine Year Plan were not designed to encourage more rapid Baha'i expansion
in National areas having relatively few local Assemblies in 1964.       In
other words, the plan's local Assembly goals did not systematically
favor Baha'i dispersion at the National level.     Be~ause   this is so, there
is no choice but to leave unanswered the original question of whether or
not the Nine Year Plan merely perpetuated preexistillg trends.      One can
be certain, however, that the plan did not provide for more rapid growth
in areas where the Faith was already strong by 1964.

The geographic distribution of the variations in plan ambitiousness
(see Figure 43) suggests three patterns.   First, the more ambitious
objectives were concentrated in Africa.    Second, the Nine Year Plan
tended to specify more ambitious goals in island nations.       Third, highly
ambitious goals were rarely assigned to industrialized regions (Japan,
New Zealand, and South Africa--the only possible exceptions--had index
values only marginally exceeding .70).

VARIATIONS IN PLAN AMBITIOUSNESS:     THE

EFFECT ON ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS

One might suppose that, because the Nine Year Plan objectives for
separate National areas varied widely in ambitiousness, the relative

8 I f the set of cases were a sample, and not a total population, r
would have to equal .17 to be statistically significant at the 5 percent
leve~.    It should be noted that the explanatory power of r = .16 is very
poor since the r 2 = .03.   Incidentally, one National area was excluded
from the analysis because its data appear to have been faulty.

success of a given National Area in achieving its goal would be controlled
by how much was expected of it.      Chad and Rhodesia can be used as ex-
amples.   The Nine Year Plan obliged both countries to have 50 local
Spiritual Assemblies by 1973.       In 1964 when the objectives were set,
however, Rhodesia already had 13 local Assemblies whereas Chad had none.
Since the objective for Chad was more demanding, it might be expected that
Rhodesia would more successfully pursue its plan goal.        In other words,
it can be hypothesized that overachievement (or underachievement) of plan
goals by National Assembly areas will be inversely related to the index
of plan ambitiousness.

To test this hypothesis, it was necessary to quantify the dependent
variables by expressing the 1973 number of local Spiritual Assemblies as
a percentage of the goal number specified in the plan (see Figure 42).
The next step was to calculate a correlation coefficient and evaluate its
significance.     In fact, correlations were calculated for each continent
separately as well as for the Baha'i world as a whole (see Table 42).

Whether all 121 National areas are considered together (Egypt/Libya
was excluded because of faulty data) or those on each continent sep-
arately, the picture remains the same.        There was no meaningful corre-
lation between plan ambitiousness and plan achievement.        One can conclude
that relative level of achievement was not influenced by the ambitious-
ness of the assigned goal.     In   fact,~f   anything, a slight positive
relationship existed, indicating that a more demanding goal was more
likely to be exceeded.    This is relevant because it justifies the
assumption, previously made but never stated, that overachievement and
underachievement during the Nine Year Plan were not caused by a faulty
plan structure.

THE NUMBERS AND DISTRIBUTION OF BAHA'IS IN 1973

The Data Problem
Precisely 129 years after its birth, the Baha'i Faith concluded its
Nine Year Plan and a religion which was first possessed by only one man
in Shiraz had spread to embrace hundreds of thousands of adherents around
the world.    Although the movement is still extremely small and relatively
invisible, it has diffused widely during its historical development.             An
attempt has been made to trace the main features of that diffusion
process.     For the sake of completion, it is appropriate to conclude with
an analysis of the distribution of the Baha'i Faith at the end of the
Nine Year Plan.

On the surface, this looks easy.       After all, there is a 1973 tabu-
lation of local Assewblies and opened localities in each National area;

these figures should be reasonable indicators of Baha'i strength in
various regions of the world.     Indeed, they are.    But to what do these
statistics relate?     The enumeration of localities where Baha'is reside is
a crude indicator of the strength of the religion, but as an exact measure
of Baha'i presence it is inadequate without additional data concerning the
total number of localities that could be occupied.         Even then, it would
not be possible to determine how successfully the religion has saturated
the individual localities.     These problems preclude the direct and
unmodified use of published statistics to evaluate the geographical dis-
tribution of the Baha'i Faith.

Since the Baha'i religion is composed of individuals, the most
satisfactory method of    distr~butional   analysis would con3ider the numbers
of believers and their proportionate strength in the total population.
It is easy to determine the total population residing in the many
different regions of the world; the problem is the dearth of statistics
concerning the numbers of Baha'is.     Therefore, the size of the Baha'i
population will have to be estimated.

Estimating the Size of the Baha'i Population

in National Spiritual Assembly Areas
The Estimating Technique

How is it possible to derive an accurate, rpliable estimate of how
many Baha'is resided in each National Spiritual Assembly area in 1973?
The only good information--that tabulating the numbers of local Spiritual
Assemblies and opened localities--obviously will correlate with Baha'i
population size, but lacking membership      staLi~tics,   how is it Fossible
to evaluate the strength of that correlation, the predictive power of its

coefficient of determination, and the parameters of Its associated
r.egression formula?

Occasionally, _the Baha I i population of a specified area is mentioned
in the literature of the religion.     In forty cases, it was possible to
ascertain either the number of local Assemblies or the number of opened
localities as well.     These forty cases will be used to develop an
estimating procedure.

Table 43 tabulates the relevant information.     Although the possibility
that the list is not a representative sample is both real and sobering,
it is encouraging that (I) a wide variety of geographical locations are
included, (2) the territorial size of the separate cases varies greatly,
and (3) the range in values is broad for all three important variables
(number of Assemblies, number of opened localities, and number of
Baha'is).

The first step in the estimating procedure was to calculate the
correlation coefficient and the regression formula when Baha'i popUlation
is treated as the dependent variable and number of local Spiritual
Assemblies as the independent variable.     After that, the same procedure
was followed substituting number of opened localities as the independent
variable.   At this point, therefore, there were two correlation co-
efficients and two regression formulas, one of each for each of the two
variables treated as independent (see Taole 44).     Both these sets of
values indicate strong positive relationships although it is discon-
certing that in each instance the regression formula predicts the
presence of hundreds of Baha'is even when there are no localities in the
country containing believers.     That problem, however , will be addressed
later.

Note: The data for this table is very precise for numbers of local Spiritual Assemblies and total n~~ers of opened localities.

Figures indicating the sizes of the Baha'i Populations, however, are less pr~cise since the sources from which they were drawn often
modified the values with such words as "almost," "over," "nearly," and "more than". The amounts of Baha'i population presen~ed 1n the

The next step was to use the two regression formulas to                              gener,~e

two sets of expected Baha'i population values that could be compared to
the observed values.                 Although the correlation coefficient suggests
that the number of opened localities performs better as an independent
variable, and should therefore be used instead of number of local
Spiritual Assemblies to predict Baha'i population size, an analysis of
the two arrays of predicted values confirmed that when one independent
variable predicts inaccurately in one direction the other independent
variable often predicts inaccurately in the other direction.                               For this
reason it was concluded that a combination of the two arrays of predicted
values would yield more accurate population estimates.                               Thus, a mean
predicted value was calculated for the 32 cases having data for both
independent variables.

At this point, a scatter diagram was constructed to reveal in
0reater detail the nature of the relationsh3p between mean predicted
and actual Baha'i population size (see Figure 44).                         One of the most
troublesome difficulties                ~!as   the skewness of distribution.             For both

estimated and actual population size, most of the cases take on values
under 5,000.     In a few instances, however, the population figures are in
the tens of thousands.     The problem is this.   A regression line fitted
to all the points may be unduly affected by the few very large values,
thereby rendering it useless for predicting populations in the low range.
A line fitted just to the smaller values where most of the      case~   occur,
however, will likely miss the mar.k entirely for the cases with very large
Baha'i populations--cases which may be few in number but which contain a
high percentage of all the Baha'is.     Keeping in mind this limitation for
regression analysis, it can at least be confirmed that the calculated
correlation coefficient (r = .93) was higher when this mean Baha'i
population prediction was employed as the independent variable than it
was when either local Assemblies or opened localities was treated as the
independent variable.     It seemed, therefore, that the mean Baha'i
population estimate was an improvement over the two earlier estimates
derived separately.

A visual examination of the distribution of points indicated that
six isolated cases on the scatter diagram deviate substantially from the
overall trend.     It was assumed that these six cases are exceptional and
do not relate to the general pattern.     Since, by the magnitude of their
residual values they could unduly affect the placement of a regression
line, they were eliminated fro~ consideration before a regression formula
was calculated and a line fitted (because five of these six cases are
positive residuals, it is safe to say that in     ~he   end there will be a
handful of National Assembly areas that actually had much larger Baha'i
populations than estimated in 1973.     One can see that the regression line

fits the larger values very well and properly captures the slope of the
trend for the smaller values.       There is a teildeucy for the line to
slightly overpredict population at the lower values, but this bias will
have to be tolerated.

A complete procedure for estimating the size of the Baha'i popula-
tion in each National Spiritual Assembly area now exists.       To   s~arize,

the regression equations derived by treating number of Assemblies and
number of opened localities as separate independent variables were used
to generate two preliminary estimates of the Baha'i population in each
National ar8a.      The pairs of values in these two arrays were then
averaged and the resulting mean estimates were used as values for an
independent variable that was tested against the actual Baha'i pOFulation
variable.      The resulting regression formula is shown in Figure 44
(Y   =   .9995 X - 410.9).   The individual values for Y became the final
population predictions.

It should be noted that the minus intercept value (-4l0.9) effectively
compensates for the tendency of the preliminary regressions (using
Assemblies and localities) to predict Baha'i populations of a few hundred
even when the independent variables are zero.

Population Estimates

Table 45 tabulates for each National area the estimated size of
the Baha'i population and shows the approximate number of believers per
one million people.      Because of the tentativeness of the estimating
procedure, these figures must not be taken as highly accurate.

Although the individual estimates may vary widely from the actual
but unknown figures, when they are summed their inaccuracies should tend

In terms of absolute numbers, it is evident that the Baha'i Faith
is strong in Asia, Africa, and tile Americas and weak in Europe and
Australia/Pacific.    When one looks at relative figures, however, the
picture changes somewhat.    The number of Baha'is per million popUlation
is high for Africa and low for Europe, a pattern that mirrors the
situation described by the absolute numbers.    Australia/Pacific, however,
which in terms of absolute number of Baha'is is rather insignificant,
becomes the region with the heaviest concentration of believers per
million population.

These figures are based on a comparison of the Baha'i population
and the total population only in the organized National Assembly areas.

Thus, for Asia especially, but also Europe and Africa, large territories
with sizable populations are excluded from consideration.

The Geographic Distribution of Baha'is in 1973
One would think that the most informative way to analyze the
geographic distribution of Baha'is would be to map the variations in the
national values for Baha'is per million population.      However, examination
of the data reveals a strong tendency for the number of Baha'is per
million to vary inversely with the absolute total population size of a
country.    In other words, a country with a small population will have a
very high number of Baha'is per million      people whereas a country with a
large population will have few Baha'is per million.      A map which simply
records the number of Baha'is per million population will, therefore,
do little more than reveal which countries are large and which ones are
small--something which adds nothing to an understanding of the spatial
characteristics of the Baha'i ecumene.

Of course the existence of the relationship is significant and merits
analysis.    The population size of a given National Assembly area is
largely a function of political realities lying outside the control of the
Faith.     Whethe~ p~~pG~8£~lly   or not; the Faith has defined for itself
National Assembly areas that coincide in almost all cases with the
territorial extent of one or more countries.       Hence, it is safe to say
that the process of creating Baha'i National Assembly areas has not
allowed total population size to play a significant role in determining
the territorial limits of a new National Assembly area.       Thus, the inverse
relationship between total population of a National area and its number

of Baha'is per million probably can best be understood if Baha'is per
million is treated as the dependent variable.               From this perspective it
can be theorized that a country with a small population that has its own
Baha'i National Assembly is in a better position to deeply penetrate its
target population than a country in which the Baha'i National Assembly
has to reach many people.             It is a matter of logistics.    Most National
Assembly areas around the world are relatively recent              creations~nd   any
one contains a Baha'i population that is an extremely small part of the
whole human mass in that country.               Thus, for example, it is much more
difficult for a National Assembly to organize Baha'i resources and
stimulate the        ti~y   numbers   ~f   active believers to reach one percent of
the population in a country like Nigeria where some 600,000 converts
would have to be recruited than in a nation such as Botswana where only
about 6,000 people would be required.

It was necessary to consider the statistical magnitude of this
perceived relationship.            Because of thei= highly skewed distributions,
both variables were logarithmically transformed before computing the
correlation coefficient and the regression equation.               The results were
as iollows:

> x        independent variable: millions of people in the National area.
> Y = dependent variable: estimated no. of Baha'is per million pop.
> number of cases          =   121 (Iran was excluded)
> r    =   -.79
> r2   =    .62
Y = 3.13 - 0.74 X

The r 2 value of .62 testifies to the strength of the relationship and
underlines the need to control for total population size before
endeavoring to map the variations in Baha'i strength.   At this point,
residuals were calculated and converted to Z-scores.    These in turn were
used to construct the map in Figure 45.

Figure 45 is deceptive.   It conveys a sense of absolute accuracy that
is totally unwarranted under the circumstances.   The data for the map rest
on a series of estimates which were constructed from a meager supply of
real information and a large number of untestable assumptions.    As a
result, any conclusions that might be drawn, any ideas that might be
suggested, any patterns that might be evident, must spring from the mind
of the viewer.

CHAPTER XII
DIFFUSION AND THE BAHA'I EXPERIENCE

RESEARCH GENERALIZATIONS

Distance and Diffusion
Why has the Baha'i Faith spread more rapidly to some parts of
the world than to others?      The search for answers to this question has
led to the discovery of a number of explanations that apply only to the
Baha'i experience and that already have been discussed.         In addition,
however, three general principles can be identified that probably would
apply to the diffusion process of many different innovations.
1.   The probability of adoption is inversely related to

distance from the potential sources of an innovation.
This is, perhaps, the generalization about diffusion most widely
accepted by geographers     ~oday;    numerous studies have identified a
tendency for an innovation to spread to nearby areas more readily than
to distant ones. l     The Baha'i Faith has shown a similar tendency.      The
pattern has been recogniZable for both geographical and cultural dis-
tance.

The validity of this generalization has also been confirmed by the
ample evidence throughout the study indicating that adoption has been
the result of personal contacts rather than impersonal media messages.

ISee, for example: Hagerstrand, Innovation Diffusion as a Spatial
Process, pp. 158-163; Gould, Spatial Diffusion, pp. 26-88; Louder,
"A Distributional and Diffusionary Analysis of the Mormon Church, 1850-
1970," pp. 128, 134-161, 187.

In a very real sense, therefore, adoption of the innovation has only
occurred when potential adopters and change agents have been face to
face.        Of course, change agents are typically wobile,   and this has
facilitated adoption of the innovation at large distances from the
areas where most believers reside.        Still, human movement costs time
and money, and so short distance travel is more prevalent than long,
with the inevitable result that the Faith has diffused more readily to
nearby areas.
2.    Specific planning di~ectives, established routes of

> pilgrimage (or migration), and extreme separation of
> core areas and leadership centers can set up patterns
> of diffusion that overcome the tyranny of distance.
Notwithstanding the fact that Baha'i diffusion has been subject to
the same sorts of distance constraints as have governed the spread of
many other innovations, a number of circumstances in the development of
the Faith have drawn attention to ways in which the friction of distance
can be defied.        In the early decades of the history of the religion, when
most believers resided in Persia and yet the leadership was located in
'Akka, substantial migratory flows were generated between these two
distant areas.        There has been no evidence to suggest that conversions
were more common along that route than at either end of it.         Nevertheless,
the period did see some amount of diffusion along the route and a sub-
stantial amount of growth in 'Akka, located 600-1000 miles from the
heartland of the religion.

Similarly, during the period 1893-1921, when 'Abdu'l-Baha was
directing Baha'i growth in North America, expansion of the religion was
most dramatic 6,000-9,000 miles from both the heartland and the center

of leadership.     Furthermore, significant growth occurred in Europe because
of the developing flow of pilgrims from the new North American core area
to the established center of the religion in 'Akka.

There are numerous examples of the initiation of far-flung growth
as a result of planning directives.         The early establishment of the
Faith in Turkestan, the sudden creation of a Baha'i community in North
America, the formation of Baha'i centers in Australia and Japan, the
rapid penetration of South America, the planned transmittal of the
religion from North America to ten previously untouched European
countries, the opening of Africa, the dispersion of Baha'is to dozens of
obscure countries and territories around the world--these are all examples
of diffusion over long distance that probably would not have occurred
without planning directives.       They are, furthermore, persuasive evidence
that distance need not be the most powerful determinant of adoption
rates.
3.   Migration, adoption, and disaffection all have the

> potential to control the geographic spread of an
> innovation.
Although the logic of this statement is obvious, studies of diffusion
frequently overlook the role of disaffection and usually fail to give

.    2   Analysis
of Baha'i diffusion in the United States permitted a reasonably careful
consideration of migration and adoption, but, like most studies, failed

> Hannemann and Meyer, for example, never raise the question of
disaffection (Hannemann, The Diffusion of the Reformation in south-
western Germany, 1518-1534; . Meyer, "Ethnicity, Theology, and Immigrant
Church Expansion") while Dann fails to explore the relative contributions
of migration, adoption, and disaffection to the diffusion of the Holiness
movement (Dann, "Spatial Diffusion of a Religious Movement").

to give sufficient attention to disaffection.     However, in tracing the
spread of the religion in the United States between 1893 and 1976, it
was possible to identify specific periods during which each of these
three diffusion dynamics were transcendent:     migration accounted for
most of the geographic expansion during the years 1937-1944, differential
adoption rates were the chief cause of changing distribution during the
Nine Year Plan, disaffection was the primary reason for geographical
re,adjustment between 1916 and 1926.   The lesson to be learned is that
geographic diffusion really is the end result of all three of these
forces, anyone of which has the potential to predominate.      Furthermore,
it is apparent that the transcendence of a given diffusion dynamic can
be temporary.   Changing conditions within and outside an innovation can
alter the relative contributions that migration, adoption, and dis-
affection make to the diffusion process.

Rate of Growth
The most common hypothesis regarding the rate of growth of a newly
introduced innovation is that slow initial acceptance will accelerate
until such time as the remaining target population becomes sufficiently
diminished to precipitate a decline in the adoption rate.     Cumulative

adoption plotted against time, therefore, will yield a logistic curve.
The logistic curve may have applicability when studying an innovation
that is diffusing within very limited time and space constraints and that
offers very obvious benefits to an easily identifiable target population.

However, for predicting global growth in a large historical context,
the results of this study suggest that it is not very useful      In more
complex situations of this type it is necessary co abandon attempts to
find recurring growth rate trends and focus instead on independent
factors that appear to influence growth rate.
1.   Rate of growth shows no overall pattern of regularity;

> rather it varies sharply between regions and from one
> time period to the next.
This statement appears to be nothing more than an admission that
growth rates are unpredictable.    As such, it does not sound like a
very useful generalization.    However, the Baha'i experience indicates
that at this time it is unrealistic to view growth rates as predictable.
An acceptance of this fact allows the investigator to devote his energies
to analyzing the variability of conditions that govern growth rates.
2.   For sustained growth, retention is as important

as adoption.
Twice during the early decades of the twentieth century the Baha'i
population of the    United States declined in size.   Furthermore, during
the 1920s and 1930s the Baha'i community of Turkestan fell from pre-
eminence to oblivion.   These experiences highlight the fact that there
is nothing inevitable about expansion, that contraction is always a
possibility.   The circumstances surrounding them preclude the possibility
that numerical diminution could have been caused   prima~lly   by mortality.
The only logical explanation for the decline in the numbers of believers
in these instances is that more people abandoned the religion than
adopted it.    Statistics presented in Chapter VII indicated that in 1975-
1976 the Baha'i population of the United States was experiencing an

annual rate of abandonment of about three percent.     If this rate were
to continue without compensating enrollments, even for only a decade or
two, the net result would be a sharp decline in the total size of the
Baha'i population.   It would seem that any innovation whose adoption con-
sists primarily of an intellectual and emotional commitment is potentially
vulnerable to attrition.

It is interesting to speculate about whether the social acceptabil-
ity of a religion affects its vulnerability to abandonment.       If an
established religion is defined as one that either claims the allegiance
of a large part of the local population or has been a constant element of
society over a long period of time, then it can be hypothesized that in
order to become established, a religion must cross an undefined but real
threshold between social acceptability and social rejection.       If this is
true, then it is logical to think that adherents of a socially unac-
ceptable religion personally suffer greater or lesser degrees of rejection
by the rest of society whereas adherents of a socially accepted religion
do not.   Since most people prefer to avoid rejection if they can, it
follows that until a religion succeeds in becoming socially acceptable
it is likely to be more vulnerable to attrition.     This point is par-
ticularly relevant when a member of a religion becomes apathetic since
the larger societal view of his religious affiliation may play a part
in his decision to abandon the religion altugether.     One of   L~e   more
common strategies that an unestablished religion will use to combat dis-
affection is to directly involve all adherents in activities that make
the individual feel part of a movement that, although outside the bounds
of what is acceptable to society as a whole, has a sense of purpose and

provides for social cohesion within the group.       This strategy is likely
to be more successful if the membership of the religion is geographically
compact, a situation which facilitates interpersonal communication, per-
mits successful social functions and group activities, and generally
encourages more rapid social acceptance of the religion in the small
area occupied.    By foregoing the ctdvantages that accompany geogr.aphic
concentration, the Baha'i Faith may be exposing itself to greater dangers
of disaffection    ~nd   attrition.   However, the Baha'i religion has been
ideologically obliged to pursue dispersion, and that strategy is not
without its advantages; a movement which becomes a sub-culture may begin
to look inward, thereby losing its determination to have an effect on the
world lying outside its control.
3.   Publicity, even of an adverse type, can increase

> awareness of an innovation and improve its potential
> for gr.owth.
Such a generalization must be viewed as extremely tentative and con-
jectural since this study has presented virtually no direct evidence in
its support.     Because analysis has concentrated on adoption as an indica-
tor of diffusion, very little attention has been paid to the notion
of awareness and its role in facilitating the diffusion process.        In
compiling information for this study, however, I reviewed a number of
historical narratives that identified situations in which efforts to
proclaim Baha'i failed to generate conversions but to which the narrator
assignea importance as stin:ulators of awareness about the religion.          Since
there was no obvious means of measuring the effect on awareness of these
efforts to spread the Baha'i Faith, it was not approp£iate to include

such obviously subjective information in this study.     Nevertheless, in a
larger context, the issue merits further attention. 4

There is a widespread Baha'i attitude that although positive
publicity is better than adverse publicity, either is preferable to
anonymity.   Negative publicity typically occurs in the form of books,
articles, and radio commentaries that criticize the beliefs of the
religion, but, at least in North America, Baha'is frequently use such
attacks as an opportunity to publicly defend their Faith in the same media
format.   The result of such an exchange is that many people become aware
of the principles of the religion, and   thi~   after all is the avowed
objective of all Baha'i expansion efforts.
4.   Mass media may heighten awareness and create good

> conditions for diffusion, but adoption depends on
> personal interaction between change agents and
> potential adopters. S
There are numerous examples of situations in which an individual
change agent was responsible for conversions to the religion, but, with
the possible exception of Tahirih, the study uncovered no examples of
conversions taking place as a result of impersonal sources of information.
The logical conclusion is that adoption generally occurs only after direct

interaction with a change agent.    This conclusion may have validity for
a number of other innovations.

Change Agents
In the process of analyzing the specifics of Baha'i diffusion in
various locations around the world, key individuals frequently have been
identified as responsible for the growth.     Furthermore, the attention
which has been paid to them permits certain conclusions regarding their
characteristics, their behavior, and their impact.     These people,
referred to in this study as change agents, are Baha'is whose actions and
words have been instrumental in persuading some of those around them to
adopt the Baha'i Faith.
1.    Diffusion relies heavily on the work of a few highly

dedicated change agents. 6
A number of specific examples already have been cited showing how
the work of a single person frequently has been responsible for the
introduction and dissemination of the Baha'i Faith in some area of the
world.    Even in area3 where Baha'i communities already existed, a single
person was occasionally found to be the precipitator of widespread expan-
sion (Dr. Khayr'u'llah in New York City, for example, and Dr. Muhajir in
Central India).    It is reasonable to think that change agents may be
similarly instrumental in the dissemination of other inl1ovations.
2.    If change agents occupy powerful and respected

> positions in society, their potential effective-
> ness will be greater.

6Rogers and Shoeroaker discuss the roles of change agents in the
diffusion process in Communication of Innovations, pp. 227-228.

In his history of the yearly years of the Baha'i movement, Nabil
occasionally mentions that    mas~   conversions sometimes occurred when the
foremost religious authority in a community converted to Baha'i and began
to publicly espouse the religion.      Apparently, such men were opinion
leaders whose views greatly affected public attitudes and public behavior.

Although there is no firm evidence, one suspects that opinion
leadership is a more powerful force in less literate, less urbanized
societies.     Certainly today in the West--where technology, literacy, and
urbanization are high--opinion leadership in the realm of the spiritual
is not as potent as it used to be.      In contrast, it would seem that
religious leaders in many non-Western settings still have the ability to
shape public opinion.     Since most diffusion research originates in
Western society, there is a possibility that the importance of opinion
leadership in global diffusion processes is seriously underestimated.
3.   Change agents often exhibit markedly different

migratory behavior from that of other adopters.
Many Bah.-'l' is who have been instrumental in disseminating their
religion have shown a willingness to migrate more frequently and over
longer distances than their fellow believers.      Furthermore, their
migratory behavior appears frequently to have been a consequence of
religious motives.     This suggests that those individuals who are most
instrumental in disseminating an innovation are not necessarily typical
adopters.     As a result, diffusion models that define parameters for
communication and     predict adoption based on proximity to previous
adopters may be highly unrealistic unless they differentiate between
previous adopters who act as change agents and previous adopters who do
not.

4.   The more mobile the change agents, the more likely is the

> innovation to expand its geographical limits. Dispersion
> relies heavily on migration and mobility.
Outside Iran, there are only a few million Baha'is in the world.

Cons~dering   the fact that most growth during the twentieth century has
been initiated from North America, it is not unreasonable to presume
that without extensive migration and mobility the religion could easily
have been confined to a relatively small area such as the industrialized
Northeast of the United States.    This region, even narrowly defined, con-
tains well over 60 million people.     Even if Baha'i growth had been
confined just to this one region, it would have had to convert only about
five percent of the total population in order to achieve the membership
that it now enjoys worldwide.     The probability is high, therefore, that
the religion could have   gene~ated   the same numerical growth in a
relatively small area.    The global distribution of Baha'is appears not
to have resulted from saturation of target populations but rather from
conscious migration and mobility of change agents.
5.   The demographic and socio-economic characteristics of

> change agents may deviate from societal norms, but the
> nature of the deviation will vary with the cultural
> and temporal setting.
For the most part, the scale and scope of this study have been too
large to permit a detailed analysis of the characteristics of change
agents (this, in fact, would be an ideal area for future research on
Baha'i diffusion).    Nevertheless, it was possible to ascertain that in
the developmental stages the religion was disseminated almost entirely
by men in Persia ann primarily by women in many Western countries.      This
exemplifies the way in which change agents for the Baha'i Faith can
exhibit a systematic demographic bias that varies between cultures.      When

looking for a comparable change through time, it is appropriate to
point to the shift in socio-economic status of change agents in the
United States.      Whereas in the first few decades of American Baha'i
history a disproportionately large number of change agents may have been
wealthy, current conditions do not indicate the existence of any such
pattern.      Evidence is scanty and inconclusive, but generally there are
enough clues to suggest that the above statement is true for the Baha'i
Fait~    and may be applicable to a number of other innovations.

Policy, Planning, and Internal Organization
Throughout this study, constant attention has been given to ways
in which the Baha'i innovation has successfully molded its own diffusion
process.     As a result, most of the statements which follow merely state
in more general terms concepts that already have been the subject of
extensive commentary.
1.   Strong, centralized leadership c~eates a favorable

> environment for diffusion in the early stages. It
> permits a rational allocation of change agents and
> allows decisive responses to changes in the con-
> ditions for diffusion.
2.   Internal dissension has the potential to paralyze

diffusion and even cause contraction.
These two complementary notions have substantial implications for
diffusion research.      They suggest that growth rates can be best under-
stood by carefully considering how an innovation is marketed rather than
by evaluating the characteristics and .l:elative availability of potential

adopters.        Both the supply and the demand elements of a diffusion

7Se e Brown, "The Market and Infrastructure context of Adoption,"
pp. 1-6, 32-35.

equation are likely to change with time, but the supply considerations
in particular are vulnerable to frequent and large modifications.          Even
in the Baha'i Faith, where there has been a long tradition of central-
ized leadership, it has been possible to identify frequent oscillations
between internal unity and internal division--oscillations that have
been shown to have a relationship to variations in the religion's growth
rate.        Once it is realized that the diffusion of an innovation is heavily
reliant on such considerations as internal organization and policy, it
becomes apparent that accurate prediction of growth rates will be
feasible only when shifts in policy and changes in internal organization
can be foreseen.

It is difficult to know whether strong, centralized leadership
assists the diffusion process in later stages.        Since the adoption
decision seems to rely heavily on personal interaction between a change
agent and a potential adopter, there is the possibility that centralized
leadership of a very large movement will become dictatorial, oppressive,
and insensitive to grass roots sentiment.        On the other hand, lack of
centralization will create favorable conditions for internal division
which has already been identified as a hindrance to the diffusion
process.        This is an intriguing issue, but not one that can be adequately
explored by studying the experience of such a small and youthful movement
as Baha'i.
3.     A well-develoIGd administrative structure can
facilitate diffusion.

A clearly articulated administrative structure provides a system
for marshalling and distributing human and physical resources. 8      By
doing so, it creates the potential for successful diffusion.       However,
the role of an administrative system in a diffusion process will depend
on the extent to which the objective of the administrative structure is
to disseminate the innovation.    Examples have been cited to show that
Baha'i administration exists primarily for the purpose of expanding the
influence of the religion.    In some other movements, well-defined admir·-
istrative systems exist primarily to serve the needs and desires of
those who already belong to the rr.ovement.   In these cases, internal
organization--although well-developed--is unlikely to contribute sub-
stantially to diffusion.
4.    Expansionist goals can facilitate large-scale

diffusion.

> 5.    Careful planning can encourage diffusion.

Since its beginnings in 1844, the Baha'i Faith has strived for
expansion by pursuing three distinct objectives:       numerical increase,
geographic dispersal, and compositional diversity.       Since 1916, these
Baha'i expansionist goals have been embodied in a sequence of growth
plans.    Much of this study has been devoted to analyzing the effective-
ness of Baha'i policy and planning; and in most instances it has been

8Bo t h Gibbon and Latourette, for example, stressed the importance
of administrative organization to the spread of Christianity (Gibbon's
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Introduction by Christopher Dawson
(6 vols.; London: J. M. Dent and Sons, Ltd., 1966), Vol. 1, pp. 430-483;

(7 vols.; 3rd ed.; New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1937), Vol. 1,
The First Five Centuries, p. 164).

concluded that they have guided the diffusionary history of the religion.
Since plans and policies have exercised substantial control over dis-
semination of the Baha'i innovation, it is reasonable to think that
similar direction could be given to the diffusion of many other innova-
tions.
6.   Given specific planning objectives, patterns of

> geographic distribution can be altered drastically
> --even to the point of inversion.
Great changes in the geographic distribution of the Baha'i popula-
tion were achieved as a result of policy and planning.     The case has
already been made that planned diffusion profoundly altered the dis-
tribution and density of the Baha'i population.     What needs to be
pointed out now is the significance of this fact.    Although there is
much evidence that distance and inaccessibility--be it of the physical,
social, or cultural type--strongly inhibit diffusion, this study has
shown that such barriers are not insuperable and that the dissemination
process is amenable to manipulation by the decision-making personnel
responsible for growth of the innovation.
7.   When a planning or administrative unit has a small

> geographic area and a small population, the potential
> for achieving ambitious diffusion goals is greater and
> the likelihood of exceeding planned expansion is higher.
Rather than speculating on the reasons why this should be so, I
would Li.ke simply to draw attention to the implications for planned
expansion.   The Baha'i experience would suggest that more rapid dif-
fusion can be achieved via planning if (1) the basic planning units
are small, but (2) the change agents available in anyone small
planning unit are encouraged to pursue objectives everywhere in the

world.       This combination of compartmentalization and flexibility seems
to be well adapted to achieving balanced growth via planning objectives.
Its success, however, will rely on the existence of a strong, central-
ized body with the authority to monitor and direct global diffusion by
setting goals for the small geographical units and encouraging all
change agents everywhere to achieve them.
8.   Plan ambitiousness and level of achievement are

not related.
Although it is unreasonable to think that highly ambitious goals
are as likely to be achieved as modest ones, statistical evidence for
the Baha'i Faith bearing on this question has failed to reveal the
ex.i.s tience of any inverse relationship.   The Baha I i experience is only
one case, of course, and so it would be premature to adopt the above
statement as an article of faith.       Nevertheless, the fact that no
statistical relationship between plan ambitiousness and plan achievement
was identified suggests that future studies of diffusion dealing with
other innovations ought also to hypothesize and test for such a relation-
ship.
9.   The wisdom and flexibility with which the propagators

> of an Lnnovat.Lon meet changing conditions that confron t;
> them will gr~ ly influence the rate of diffusion.
This is not the place to discuss the pros and cons of the "great
man" theory of history which holds that the unique behavior of key
individuals (be they male or female) has frequently determined the
course of human events.       Suffice it to say that most people accept the
idea that in at least some instances the unique character of an individual
has played a pivotal role in history.        Generally, those who are more
impressed by the influence of individuals on historical events might

logically be expected to have less confidence in mankind's ability to
predict the future.    Whatever position one might take on this issue,
evidence from the Baha'i experience suggests that the actions of key
individuals within the religion have been sufficiently dramatic to
stimulate a similar range of opinions regarding their influence on
Baha'i diffusion.     This kind of consideration merits attention in future
diffusion studies.

External Conditions
Although the primary emphasis throughout this study has been on
the ways in which the Baha'i Faith has managed its own growth, in a
number of instances   e~ternal   conditions have been identified as in-
fluential forces in the religion's diffusion process.
1.   Persecution can stimulate diffusion when the

> adopters are indigenous people representative
> of society.
2.   Persecution can ~alt, and even reverse, diffusion

> when the adopters are drawn mostly from a particular
> nationality, race, religion, or socioeconomic class.
The regeneration of the Baha'i Faith in Persia after the 18408 con-
trasts sharply with the disappearance of the movement from Turkestan and
the Caucasus during the 1930s and 1940s.      In both cases the Baha'i
religion was subjected to persecution, but the consequences were very
different.   Historical sources have documented that in Persia the
Baha'i Faith was widely disseminated and was adhered to by people with
a great variety of backgrounds whereas in Turkestan the Baha'i community
was relatively concentrated geographically and was comprised largely of
wealthy Persian expatriates.     These differences help to explain why

survival was possible in one setting and not in the other.      When a move-
ment is confined to a particular segment of society it is easier to
isolate and   persecute the adherents and it is easier to find a rational-
ization for doing so that will   b~   acceptable to the rest of society.

An innovation may be diffused much more easily and far quicker if
the target population does not contain the full diversity of society but
rather is narrowed to include one class of people only.      If this is true,
it may help to account for the ephemeral nature of many movements.         The
rise and decline of a short-lived ideology or religion may involve the
rapid penetration of a particular segment of society that, due to some
aspect of its uniqueness, is receptive to the new movement.      With changes
in social circlli7stanc€s or conditions, however, the lack of diversity
among the adherents may make it difficult for the membership to adapt,
with the result that attrition sets in.

Finally, a note of caution should be struck.      The notion that per-
secution is more of a threat to a movement with a membership that is not
representative of its host society should be considered in light of the
Jewish experience.   Is one to believe that Judaism has survived because
of .. or in spite of, the fact that its followers have long been a distinct
social group frequently occupying clearly defined economic or occupational
niches in society and occasionally exhibiting obvious geographic con-
centration?
3.   Conditions of political and religious freedom are

> conducive to diffusion whereas suppression or
> proscription can make diffusion more difficult.
In this instance, the intention is to consider a circumstance in which
all religions (or perhaps all but one) are proscribed rather than just the

one under consideration.    This, of course, is the situation which pre-
vails throughout most of the communist realm.        Under such circumstances,
the overt activities of a single religious movement are curtailed nearly
as effectively as would be the case if it alone were subjected to the
suppression, and yet there is not the opportunity to inherit the
attention that is likely to focus on a "martyred" religion.         As has been
mentioned before, it is very difficult for a religion to flourish when it
is relatively unknown and    invisible.
4.    Foreign cultural environments pose substantial,

but not insuperable, barriers to diffusion. 9
5.    At an international level, an innovation tends

> to enter a new country via its cosmopolitan
> urban center(s).lO
6.    At the macro and micro scale, initial diffusion

> tends to be hierarchical whereas subsequent
> diffusion often is contagious. l l
Evidence in support of these three generalizations has been provided
at different points in this study.     Di3cussion,    howev~r,   has always cen-
tered on the question of whether the generalizations are valid for the
Baha'i innovation; it has not contemplated the possibility that what
seems to be true for the Baha'i Faith may also hold for many other innova-
tions.    Perhaps future diffusion studies can pose these generalizations
as explicit hypotheses and test them in a more vigorous fashion.
7.    At the global level, an innovation tends to spread

> first to technologically and economically developed
> countries and later to the developing countries.

Urban Systems," Geographical Analysis, 2 (July, 1970), pp. 203-254.

Gould, Spatial Diffusion, pp. 25-68.

The vecturs of Baha'i diffusion have very clearly portrayed this
pattern of expansion.     Even though the Faith originated in a part of the
developing world that was not even associated with a Western colonial
empire: dissemination to Western centers occurred early, penetration of
other developing areas was subsequent, and the impetus for global dis-
persion was provided by the West rather than the religion's place of
origin.     Even for a non-Western innovation, therefore, the advanced
technology, the economic strength, and the political supremacy of
Western countries appear to    have been extremely important to the
diffusion   pro~ess.   Notice, for example, that the Baha'i Faith, which
has its roots in Muslim traditions, spread from Egypt to America and
thence to Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and even Japan
before Muslim North Africa west of Egypt was even touched.

It would be quite natural to expect that most technological innova-
tions would be developed and spread by the West.     To see a non-Western
religion use the West as a staging area for global diffusion, however,
suggests that the mechanics and logistics of dissemination have much in
common regardless of the nature of the innovation.
8.     Particular personalities and unique historical events

> can have a strong impact on the diffusionary fortunes
> of an inncvation.
Just as the behavior of key individuals within the organization of
an innovation can greatly affect the diffusion process, so too can the
actions of key people not associated with the movement.
9.     Societal conditions and current social values can have

at least a shoLt run effect on diffusion.
Actually, there is little doubt that social values and conditions
can have an enduring effect on diffusion of a religious or ideological

innovation.     In the contemporary world, however, societies everywhere are
changing so rapidly that it is no longer possible to visualize what the
world of tomorrow will be like.    As a result, the survival of an innova-
tion depends largely on its ability to adapt to conditions of continuous
change.

In the United States, the Baha'i Faith experienced rapid expansion
during the late 1960s and early 1970s.     This growth was stimulated at
least in part by the spiritual revolution that enveloped the country at
that time.    Without that philosophical shift in the nation, it is
unlikely that the Baha'i membership would have expanded as it did.        Today,
one of the more important changes in the national outlook involves the
acceptance of women's rights.     The more clearly the Baha'i Faith, or
any similar innovation, takes a position on this issue, the more likely
is the issue to influence the rates of adoption and rejection.       This,
therefore, is an example of a rapidly emerging modern social question
with the potential to make or bremc a new movement.
10.     Economic conditions can affect the rate and direction

of diffusion.
Even though the Baha'i Faith is not tied to a particular social
class or economic philosophy. evidence from the United States suggests
that diffusion has proceeded more vigorously in areas where economic
conditions have been encouraging in-migration.       Of course, in the case
of the Baha'i Faith, the heavy reliance on change agents who are willing
to settle in a new area in order to spread the religion probably has made
the movement unusually sensitive to local economic conditions.       Neverthe-
less, any innovation that relies    prim~rily   on interpersonal communication

to achieve dissemination is likely to be affected by local variations
in economic health. 1 2

If an economy has the capacity to absorb new people, then carriers
of an innovation are more likely to enter that economy, establish      ~hem-

selves, and then proceed to stimulate adoptions.

FUTURE RESEARCH

Future research on Baha'i diffusion should, I think, address three
specific areas.   First, there should be smaller scale studies designed
to explore the dynamics of diffusion in small areas of the world.      Large-
scale analysis has provided a prerequisite overview of Baha'i expansion,
and has explicitly addressed the questions of where, when, ane why
Baha'i diffusion has occurred, but the conclusions that have been
reached have been relatively general and tentative in nature.     Small-
scale studies would allow more detailed analysis of the diffusion question
and would supply settings in which the generalizations derived from this
study could be tested more vigorously.

Second, efforts should be made to explore the psychological and
soci0logical dynamics of adoption.    At present, there is very little
ill!derstanding of how the adoption decision occurs.   Change agents
appear to be vital links between the innovation and the target population,
but in what ways are they vital?     Do they succeed by force of logic or

Meyer avoids purely economic explanations of the pattern of diffusion of
Montessori education in America, it is evident that the movement was
most successful among urban people of higher socio-economic status.

by means of charisma and personal magnetism?      Are they numerous or few?
How do they differ from other    Baha~is?   In what ways do they establish
contacts and how frequently do their efforts result in conversions?
On the other hand, there are the adopters themselves.         How do they
usually find out about the innovation?      How is the transition from
awareness to acceptance effected?     Does their conversion usually coincide
with a period of crisis or trauma' in their lives?        These and many, many
other questions need to be addressed by researchers interested in under-
standing why people join the religion.

Finally, attention should be given to the motivations underlying
disaffection and abandonment.     The rising incidence of this kind of
attrition in the United States makes it a significant force in the
dynamics of Baha'i population change.       It may be that an improved under-
standing of what causes disaffections will help isolate those aspects
of the Baha'i Faith that are most difficult for new believers to accept.
This, in turn, might be used to modify the way      i~   whlch Baha;i principles
are introduced and inculcated.

SOCIAL SCIENCE AND THE BAHA'I FAITH

When the modern social scientist fantasizes, I suspect that his
thoughts turn most frequently to the allure of controlled experiments.
However, no way has yet been discovered to control for the multitude of
forces that mold human behavior.     The classical scientific method has not
been a powerful analytical tool for examining the human experience, but
no other methodology has proven better.       Social scientists have had
little choice but to mimic the experimental procedures that have served

the physical sciences so well.    In doing so, however, the assumption
has had to be made that important aspects of a phenomenon can best be
understood by removing it from its (larger) context--an essential first
step in the analytical process.    When social scientists attempt to
initiate this process of extracting the problem from its context, three
techniques are commonly used:     (1) arbitrary limitation on the temporal
frame of reference, (2) arbitrary limitation on the geographical frame
of reference, and (3) arbitrary limitation on the variability of the
characteristics of the object(s) of study.    If, for example, a social
scientist wishes to understand why the Baha'i Faith has diffused at the
rate and in the directions that it has, then he is likely to approach
the problem first by collapsing it.    In the belief (not fact) that the
problem is too large to be tackled in its entirety, and in the further
belief (not fact) that an ultimate answer to the overall question cnn
be derived gradually from separate answers to the same question asked
at much smaller geographic and temporal scales and among a certain sub-
set of the objects of study, the investigator is likely to redefine the
problem so that it is not as large (or as relevant).    By the time research
is undertaken, for example, the proposed research topic may have become
"The Diffusion of the   Baha'i Faith in the United States:   An Analysis of
Adoptions by Youth, 1960-1975."    The question that arises is whether the
depth of analysis which becomee possible under this more confined
definition of the problem will yield a solution that (1) has any
relevance i.n its own right, and (2) can be combined with the conclusions
from other similarly confined studies on the subject to give an answer to
the larger question of what has caused the Baha'i Faith to diffuse (or,

going even farther, what are the general principles of the diffusion
process).   I am pessimistic about the efficacy of this building block
approach to the study of human experience.    Perhaps it can work, but I
strongly doubt that it does unless it is accompanied by a synthetic
approach that identifies the relationship of the object of study with
its larger context.

This exploration of the Baha'i diffusion certainly has been more an
analysis than a synthesis, and for this reason it must be viewed as just
one more social science study in which the emphasis is greater on the
science than on the social.   Nevertheless, there has been a serious
effort to let the problem dictate the method rather than having the
metl.od place limits on the problem.   The result, I would submit, is a
study that permits conclusions about the entire religious movement rather
than just one small part of it.   It cannot be   ~~nied   that in the process
of achieving breadth and universalism, the methodology has had to be
less rigorous than would otherwise have been the case (this is a matter of
no small concern since a large part of all modern social science research
is dedicated to the task of proving that the investigator is a true
scientist rather than uncovering relevant generalizations).      However,
by examining the whole of Baha'i history it has been possible to provide
an appropriate perspective for further research on particular aspects
of Baha'i diffusion.   I would perceive this to be a major contribution
of this study.

SUPPLY DIFFUSION

Diffusion can be viewed as a process involving supply of, and demand
for, an innovation.   From the beginning, this study has openly proclaimed
its preoccupation with the supply side of the diffusion equation. 13        It
is unavoidable that such a strategy should have drawn the research into
a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the innovation while
giving less attention to external conditions.     On~   of the results of
this approach is that the innovation has been treated more as a living,
intelligent entity than as a durob force.    Dumb forces do not make
decisions; intelligent beings do.     By recognizing that the dissemin-
ation of many innovations, including the Baha'i Faith, involves a con-
stant flow of conscious and unconscious decisions, an investigator is
confronted with the task of having to account for the behavior of one,
or a small group of, decision makers.    This situation poses analytical
problems that are much greater in magnitude than those typically con-
fronted when studying the average behavior of a relatively large number
of potential adopters.   It is one thing to predict the behavior of the
average potential adopter of an innovation; it is quite another to
pi-'edict the actions of the leadership of an innovative movement.

In spite of the problem, the supply approach adopted in this study
has facilitated the identification of two main ideas that enrich the
current body of diffusion research.     The first idea is that planning can
result in a diffusion pattern that deviates greatly from what one would
expect under certain widely accepted principles of diffusion.       The second

13 Se e the discussion of supply diffusion in Chapter I.

idea is that diffusion research has great potential for practical
application when it views the process as a rational strategy for success
rather than as a naturalistic process of change.     Neither of these ideas
is new; the seeds of both are contained in    ~xisting   supply-oriented
diffusion studies.   Nonetheless, this examination of global Baha'i
diffusion over thirteen decades has articulated and legitimized these
two ideas to a degree far surpassing any preceding study.       In   conce~t,

these two ideas imply that we have the power to do more than merely
understand the diffusion process; we can control it.

Literature reflective of the demand approach to the diffusion
process stresses three theoretical notions.    First, there is the idea
that the incidence of adoption of an innovation will vary with the
passage of time in accordance with the pattern described by the s-shaped
cumulative curve.    Second, there is the concept of non-geographic dis-
tance which postulates that new adoption will be more widespread among
those who resemble existing adopters in social, economic, cultural,
linguistic, ideological, and other traits.     Third, there is the belief
that geographic distance directly influences the quantity of adoption.
These three theories, or principles, frequently are tested in diffusion
reaearch and usually are found to be viable.     It is probably safe to say
that diffusion researchers have reached a consensus that these theories
are now approaching the status of (social) scientific law.       vlliat is not
so clear is the degree of effort required to overcome their authority.
In other words, to what extent is it possible for conscious attempts at
dissemination of an innovation to generate a diffusion process that
defies these three laws?

The Baha'i Faith has extensively employed the planning tool.         Of
all the planning themes pursued by the Baha'i Faith, the most intriguing
to me has been that of geographical dispersion.      During much of the
twentieth century, Baha'i expansion was planned in such a way as to give
greater priority to geographical dissemination than to numerical increase.
Analysis of data on the size and distribution of the Baha'i population
has shown that strategy to be successful.      It is true that the Baha'i
Faith has not penetrated the communist realm.      It is true that Baha'i
expansion has tended to occur more frequently across shorter social and
geographical distances.   But it is also true that, due to planning and
clearly defined objectives, the Baha'i Faith has achieved a geographical
and social universality that far exceeds what could reasonably be
expected of a small, young, and obscure religious movement.

In short, the Baha'i example has shown that planning can direct
growth over long geographic and non-geographic distances and can sub--
stantially affect the adoption rate.      ?lanning, therefore, has the
potential to manipulate the diffusion process.

Of course the balanced view would be that diffusion responds to a
mixture of supply and demand conditions, neither of which dominates the
process.   Although this stUdy has exhibited a clear bias in favor of
supply oriented explanations of diffusion, the motive behind such a bias
has been to develop a strong counterpoint to currently prevalent demand
oriented thinking.   Only when both supply and demand conditions are
recognized as comparable in the diffusion equation is it going to be
possible for a balanced   underst~nding   of diffusion to emerge.

But most of all, supply oriented chinking lends to diffusion
research an attitude of optimism and activism.   Research undertaken from
the demand perspective generally leads to a passive acceptance of how
diffusion occurs, but the supply perspective is a clear recognition that
mankind has the capability to manage the diffusion process.   Supply
thinking is an open invitation to social engineering.
