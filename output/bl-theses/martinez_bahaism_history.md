> **Abstract:** Forty years ago the West was asking itself whether the world would be communist or capitalist. After the fall of communism and the triumph of global capitalism some have indicated that we live in an era without ideologies. My dissertation explores a religion, Baha’ism, comprised of six million adherents worldwide, and attempts to show that ideologies continue to be part of our modern (or postmodern) era. To do this I use recent academic contributions, such as Webb Keane’s semiotic ideology, and its informed by the philosophic explorations on ideology and utopia made by Karl Mannheim, Paul Ricoeur, Pierre Bourdieu, Louis Althusser and Slavoj Žižek, among others. This dissertation explores this religion’s history, conversion narratives, Baha’i doxa, and other competing narratives.
