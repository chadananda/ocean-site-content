**Abstract:**  

#### Aims and objectives

The purpose of this study is to explore learning processes of a collaborative study group, engaged on a path of individual and social transformation, with the perspective of cultural-historical activity theory. The topic opens up a window on processes in learning communities beyond school-related education. The objective is to gain insights how learning takes place in the activity, what the tools are that the participants use in the activity, how these tools guide their learning, and how the participants' multivoicedness influences the learning process.

#### Research as a process

Scientific method is a truth seeking exercise, is interpretive, and any researcher needs to be clear about the basic set of beliefs that guides his action, his interpretive framework, and the network that contains his (1) ontological (the kind of human being we are; the nature of our reality), (2) epistemological (the relationship between the inquirer and the known, the observer and the observed), and (3) methodological premises (how we know the world or gain knowledge of it).

(1) To consider man as a noble being, as mine rich in gems which education can bring out, is a core element of a conceptual framework that governs every educational activity, and stands at the centre of the empirical data I have observed. Bahá'í texts state that the crucial need facing humanity today is to find a unifying vision of the nature and purpose of life and of the future of society. The object of the Bahá'í Faith is to effect a transformation in the whole character of mankind. Every human being has a two-fold moral purpose; to develop their latent potentialities through efforts to contribute to the advancement of civilization (Institute for Global Prosperity, 2012).

(2 and 3) Our culture(s), our language(s), our belief(s), our institutions and educational systems influence our understanding. They are products of the human mind. Social reality mediates our engagement with the world, and we have the capacity to create anew this reality. I advance on a path of learning that reduces ambiguity, where the mind does have access to reliable knowledge. The nonfoundational approach to knowledge recognizes the legitimacy of different points of view and the limitations on certainty, but unlike a relativistic approach, permits judgments about inadequacy or error. Human capacity for comprehending reality is circumscribed, but the mind does have access to reliable knowledge. We learn to live with uncertainty, and without epistemological guarantees, we act and strive to reduce ambiguity. This research presents a modest contribution to explore a tiny facet and fragment of social reality, and is not a description of the world as it is. The study represents one perspective on social reality, a reality that is whole.

I take the teleological stand that history is not just a series of events, but develops. Humanity as an organic entity evolves, in its collective life, towards maturity. Humanity stands today at the threshold of maturity and the distinguishing attribute of this maturity is the unification of the human race. My belief in the oneness of humankind stands at the center of a conception of existence within which the nature of the fundamental processes and structures of the collective life on the planet are defined.

#### How the research was conducted: participants and research instruments

The unit of analysis consists of a group of five participants who start a course on how to provide children, aged five to eight, moral, spiritual, and values-based training. The data collected includes five video-recorded group sessions and interviews, written questionnaires, notes, and a number of documents, which include primary texts, written by the central authors and institutions of the Bahá'í community, by individuals or Bahá'í-inspired organisations. Each of the five video-recorded sessions lasted on average two hours, and there was a lapse of five months between the first study session and the last written questionnaire, carried out after session six. 21 excerpts chosen are analysed in depth.

The research is founded on the framework of the cultural-historical school of learning and development, which is referred to during the analysis of the interactional data. The concept of learning is applied to the individual and social plane. The analysis at the micro-level is referring to individual utterances and joint conversations. References are made to acquisition and participation approaches and their interconnectedness.

I use activity theory to frame the analysis and discourse analysis to analyze the data. Activity theory states, that a collective activity, with the basic purpose shared by others, is undertaken by people who are motivated by a purpose or towards the solution of a problem, which is mediated by tools, used in order to achieve an outcome.

When we communicate, we may strive for clarity, but we are always situated in an historical context and what we say is influenced by our multivoicedness. Reflecting on what people have said and written, and thereby discovering meaning and interpretation is the basis of discourse analysis (Gee, 2005).

#### Findings and Implications

The study shows how learning takes place through a complex interaction between all of the elements in the activity system. Nine distinct instances offer insights that this particular type of collaborative activity encourages and promotes the exchange of questions, ideas, experiences, thoughts and knowledge among participants:

1.  ideas bounce and comments resonate with other participants
2.  cultural differences meet in a collaborative activity through value negotiation
3.  a known concept connects to a new context of having to raise children
4.  the object of learning is considered a positive source, spread out worldwide for the first time
5.  learning develops through comparison and identity develops
6.  an research interest is shown in what participants do and how they do it
7.  the activity undertaken is value-oriented
8.  participants negotiate the suggested learning tools, mediation is present
9.  the tutor shares experiences and skills

The study shows that participants negotiate tools given by the content-based curriculum and suggests that participants in a collaborative learning activity focus on their objectives and outcome, and thus choose, define and appropriate themselves suitable tools. The following mediating artefacts, tools and signs were used by the participants and shaped their learning:

*   three languages (French, Luxembourgish, and German)
*   the curriculum and the negotiation of the tools provided
*   writing
*   participants' cultural-historical background and the tools they added to the activity

The study circle observed is at the beginning of its historicity. Study circles are developing with their own historicity in different contexts and cultures, and on the one, influence the way participants learn. On the other hand, as participants bring in their historicity and multivoicedness, they influence the learning activity. In this way, there is interconnectedness and mutual influence between participants and the learning activity. The study shows how participants bring into the activity their multivoicedness and historicity. Most of these voices help the participants towards reaching their objective and outcome.

In the analysis of the 21 excerpts, I identified 32 voices that participants bring into the activity, collected into seven interacting and overlapping categories:

*   voices that are in the name of everyone, or for everyone, when we see ourselves collectively
*   voices of those we care for and love
*   voices of those that are keen to learn and curious to find out more about human existence
*   voices of someone that takes part in an activity, someone that shares his skills, someone willing to contribute as best as possible.
*   voices of someone with certain qualities, skills and values that transmit and portray certain qualities
*   voices of those that endure physical hardship and are close to nature
*   voices of those not satisfied by certain learning tools

I suggest that participants, engaged in collaborative learning activities, raise their awareness that their multivoicedness influences their learning.

The study suggests that the existence and deliberate creation of certain conditions among participants in a learning activity influence the learning process. They include mutual trust, honesty, unity, a welcoming and encouraging attitude, a respect for the opinion of others, adopting a humble learning attitude, humour, and taking ownership of one's learning.

In a further research step, the challenge of expansive learning, that is, transforming the context of the learning activity through joint achievement can be analysed and achieved through an interventionist approach. Additionally, a more distant stance towards the processes in the collaborative study circle can be taken through a meta-level analysis, facilitated by the cultural-historical activity theory framework.

Cultural-historical activity theory perspective on individual and social transformation

Zusammenfassung

Diese Masterarbeit erfasst mit Hilfe der kulturell-historischen Aktivitätstheorie
Lernprozesse einer Probandengruppe und untersucht individuelle und gruppenspezifische
Veränderungen.      Erkenntnisse      werden      gewonnen,       wie    Lernen      während     der
Gruppenaktivität stattfindet, wie die Vielstimmigkeit der Teilnehmer den Lernprozess
beeinflusst, welche Instrumente die Teilnehmer verwenden und inwiefern diese
Hilfsmittel ihr Lernen bestimmen.
Die Probandengruppe besteht aus fünf Teilnehmern, die an einem Kurs zur Vermittlung
moralischer und spiritueller Werte für fünf- bis achtjährige Kinder teilnehmen. Die
gesammelten Daten enthalten fünf Viedeoaufzeichnungen der Studiensitzungen sowie
Interviews, schriftliche Fragen, Notizen und eine Reihe von Dokumenten, darunter auch
Originaltexte wesentlicher Autoren und Institutionen der Bahai-Gemeinschaft, aber auch
anderer Autoren und Bahai-naher Organisationen.
Die Aktivitätstheorie dient der Studie als Rahmen, wobei die Daten mit Hilfe der
Diskursanalyse      untersucht    werden.      Die     Aktivitätstheorie     besagt,     dass    eine
gemeinschaftliche Aktivität von Menschen durchgeführt wird, die von einem
gemeinsamen Ziel und Ergebnis geleitet werden und dazu angemessene Hilfsmittel
verwenden, eingeschränkt und beeinflusst durch kulturelle Werte                 in einem sozialen
Umfeld.
Wenn wir kommunizieren, streben wir Klarheit an, sind aber immer in einen historischen
Kontext eingebunden und was wir sagen, wird durch unsere Vielstimmigkeit beeinflusst.
Die Diskursanalyse untersucht, was Leute gesagt und geschrieben haben und befasst sich
mit der Bedeutung und Interpretation dieser Äußerungen (Gee, 2005).
Die Studie zeigt:
-   wie Teilnehmer mit vom Lernmaterial vorgegebenen Instrumenten kritisch

> umgehen und schlägt vor, dass die Teilnehmer eines gemeinschaftlichen
> Lernprozesses sich auf ihre Ziele und Ergebnisse fokussieren, um so selbst
> geeignete Werkzeuge zu wählen, zu definieren und sich anzueignen.

-   wie Teilnehmer ihre Vielstimmigkeit und Historizität in die Tätigkeit einbringen.

> Die meisten dieser Stimmen helfen den Teilnehmern, ihre Ziele und Ergebnisse zu
> erreichen.
-   wie   Lernen durch ein komplexes              Zusammenspiel aller           Elemente   im

> Historizität und Vielstimmigkeit mit einbringen, beeinflussen sie die Lernaktivität,
> und auf diese Weise entsteht eine gegenseitige Beeinflussung zwischen
> Teilnehmern und Lernaktivität.

Die Studie legt nahe, dass die Existenz und gezielte Erzeugung von Bedingungen, wie
gegenseitiges Zuhören und Vertrauen, Einheit, eine einladende und ermutigende Haltung,
Humor und eigenverantwortliches Lernen, zwischen den Teilnehmern in einer
Lernaktivität den Lernprozess beeinflussen.

Cultural-historical activity theory perspective on individual and social transformation

Résumé

Le but de cette étude est d'explorer, à l’aide de la théorie de l'activité culturelle et
historique, les processus d'apprentissage d'un groupe d'études collaboratif, engagé sur une
voie de transformation individuelle et sociale. L'objectif est de mieux comprendre
comment l'apprentissage se déroule pendant l'activité, comment les participants
s’exprimant en leur nom ou donnant voix à d’autres, influencent le processus
d'apprentissage, quels outils les participants utilisent dans le cadre de l'activité, et
comment ces outils les guident dans leur apprentissage.
L'unité d'analyse consiste en un groupe de cinq participants qui commencent une
formation pour développer la capacité d’offrir aux enfants, âgés de cinq à huit ans, un
cours d’éducation aux valeurs morales et spirituelles. Les données ont été recueillies au
cours de cinq sessions menées par le groupe et comprennent des enregistrements vidéo et
des interviews, des questionnaires écrits, des notes et un certain nombre de documents,
dont de la littérature primaire c’est-à-dire issue des figures centrales de la Foi Bahá’íe,
des textes écrits ou commandités par les institutions de la communauté bahá'íe, ou par des
organisations d’inspiration bahá’íe ou enfin des textes d’auteurs bahá’ís. Chaque session
durait en moyenne deux heures et entre la première session et le questionnaire écrit, fait
après la sixième session, cinq mois s’étaient déroulés. 21 extraits choisis sont analysés en
profondeur.
Cette étude est basée sur le cadre conceptuel culturel-historique de l’apprentissage et du
développement et le concept de l’apprentissage est appliqué au niveau individuel et
social. La théorie de l'activité sert de cadre à cette étude, tandis que celle de l'analyse du
discours est utilisée pour analyser les données recueillies. Selon la théorie de l'activité,
une activité collective, dont l'objectif de base est partagé par d’autres, est menée par des
personnes qui trouvent leur motivation dans le partage d’un même but ou la recherche de
la solution à un même problème. Des outils servent de médiateur à l’activité et sont
utilisés dans le but de parvenir à un résultat. L’étude fait référence à des approches
d’acquisition et de participation et leur interconnectivité.
Quand nous communiquons, même si nous nous efforçons d’être clairs, nous sommes
toujours situés dans un contexte historique et donc, ce que nous disons est influencé par
notre « multivoicedness », le fait que nous soyons des porteurs de paroles multiples.

Exploring learning processes within a collaborative study circle

Réfléchir sur ce que les gens ont dit et écrit, et ainsi en découvrir des significations et
interprétations possibles, est à la base de l'analyse du discours (Gee, 2005).
Le sujet de l’étude ouvre une fenêtre sur des processus dans des communautés
d’apprentissage au-delà de l’éducation scolaire. L’analyse au niveau micro se réfère à des
énoncés individuels et à des conversations en commun. L'étude montre que les
participants ont négocié les outils contenus dans le programme d'étude. Cela laisse
penser que les participants impliqués dans une activité d'apprentissage collaboratif
focalisent sur leurs objectifs et leurs résultats, et donc choisissent, définissent par eux-
mêmes et s’approprient les outils les plus adaptés. Dans ce travail, on voit comment les
participants ont apporté dans l'activité leur façon d’être porteurs de paroles multiples
(multivoicedness) et leur historicité. La plupart de ces différentes voix portées ont aidé les
participants à atteindre leur objectif et les résultats escomptés. Je suggère que les
participants, engagés dans des activités d'apprentissage, deviennent davantage conscients
que ces voix multiples dont ils sont porteurs (multivoicedness) les influencent dans leur
processus d’apprentissage. L'étude s’attache à relever la façon dont l'apprentissage se fait
à travers une interaction complexe entre tous les éléments dans le système de l'activité.
Le cercle d'études observé est au début de son historicité. Les cercles d'études sont en
développement avec leur propre historicité dans différents contextes et cultures, et
influencent la façon dont les participants apprennent. De même, les participants apportent
leur historicité et multivoicedness, et ainsi, ils influencent l'activité d'apprentissage. De
cette façon, il y a interdépendance et influence mutuelle entre les participants et l'activité
d'apprentissage.
L'étude suggère que l'existence et la création délibérée de certaines conditions parmi les
participants à une activité d'apprentissage influencent le processus d'apprentissage. Ces
conditions comprennent la confiance mutuelle, l'honnêteté, l'unité, une attitude
accueillante et encourageante, un respect pour l'opinion des autres, une attitude humble
d'apprentissage, l'humour, et l'appropriation personnelle de son apprentissage.

Mots-clés: théorie de l'activité culturelle et historique, les outils de médiation, processus
d’apprentissage, développement, historicité, multivoicedness.

Abstract

Aims and objectives
The purpose of this study is to explore learning processes of a collaborative study group,

Research as a process
Scientific method is a truth seeking exercise, is interpretive, and any researcher needs to
be clear about the basic set of beliefs that guides his action, his interpretive framework,
and the network that contains his (1) ontological (the kind of human being we are; the
nature of our reality), (2) epistemological (the relationship between the inquirer and the
known, the observer and the observed), and (3) methodological premises (how we know
the world or gain knowledge of it).
(1) To consider man as a noble being, as mine rich in gems which education can bring
out, is a core element of a conceptual framework that governs every educational activity,
and stands at the centre of the empirical data I have observed. Bahá’í texts state that the
crucial need facing humanity today is to find a unifying vision of the nature and purpose
of life and of the future of society. The object of the Bahá’í Faith is to effect a

access to reliable knowledge. The nonfoundational approach to knowledge recognizes the
legitimacy of different points of view and the limitations on certainty, but unlike a
relativistic approach, permits judgments about inadequacy or error. Human capacity for

comprehending reality is circumscribed, but the mind does have access to reliable
knowledge. We learn to live with uncertainty, and without epistemological guarantees, we
act and strive to reduce ambiguity. This research presents a modest contribution to
explore a tiny facet and fragment of social reality, and is not a description of the world as
it is. The study represents one perspective on social reality, a reality that is whole.

1 CHAPTER ONE: MY RESEARCH AS A PROCESS
Hardly a day goes by where I do not learn something new; discover a new way of doing
something. Over the last two years, I have been engaged in a process of learning about
qualitative research. I have made progress and my thoughts have developed towards a
more holistic view of the world, although I am aware that my perspective of the world
can only be fragmentary and incomplete. Qualitative research informs us that there is no
such thing as objective observation.
Scientific method is in the business of truth seeking. The researcher should be clear about
the basic set of beliefs that guides his action, his paradigm, or interpretative framework,
the network that         contains the researchers’          epistemological,      ontological,    and
methodological premises (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003, p. 29). This is also true for the
participants observed during the research. They hold a set of beliefs that guide their action
and influence their learning. For Denzin and Lincoln (2003), qualitative researchers
believe that rich descriptions of the social world are valuable; that the field of qualitative
research is characterized by an embarrassment of choices; that researchers have never
before had so many paradigms, strategies of inquiry, and methods of analysis to draw
upon and utilize; that the qualitative research act can no longer be viewed from within a
neutral or objective positivist perspective, that “class, race, gender, and ethnicity shape
inquiry, making research a multicultural process” (2003, p. 29), and that the present is a
politically charged space.
As a researcher and explorer of learning processes, these statements are relevant.
Qualitative research is described as a process that involves three interconnected, generic
activities:

> The gendered, multiculturally situated researcher approaches the world with a set
> of ideas, a framework (theory, ontology) [1] that specifies a set of questions
> (epistemology) [2] that he or she then examines in specific ways (methodology,
> analysis) [3]. [He] collects empirical materials bearing on the question and then
> analyzes and writes about those materials (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003, p. 29–30).
> [...] No single method can grasp all the subtle variations in ongoing human
> experience. Consequently, qualitative researchers deploy a wide range of
> interconnected interpretive methods; always seeking better ways to make more
> understandable the worlds of experience they have studied (Denzin & Lincoln,
> 2003, p. 31).

While it may be so that there “is no clear window into the inner life of an individual”
(Denzin & Lincoln, 2005, p. 1–32), this study tries to look at the activity of participants
engaged in a course as the unit of analysis.
1\.1 The Researcher as a Multicultural Subject

> Culture, language, beliefs, institutions, educational systems—all are real, all have
> an impact on our understanding, but are all products of the human mind. Social
> reality mediates our engagement with the world, physical and spiritual, and it is
> this reality that we have the capacity to create anew (Lample, 2009, p. 7).

My current view of the world has been inspired by the writings of Bahá'u'lláh (1817-
1892). “Let your vision be world embracing […]. Be anxiously concerned with the needs
of the age you live in, and center your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.
The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens” (Bahá’u’lláh, 1983, p. 97,213).
Science and religion ought to develop harmoniously, as they constitute the two sources of
knowledge available to humankind. I have seized the opportunity to learn more about
how ‘scientific knowledge’ can help advancing civilization in a way that is in agreement
with my view of the world.
World peace is the crying need of our time. The crucial need facing humanity today is to
find a unifying vision of the nature and purpose of life and of the future of society. Such a
vision unfolds in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh.
This study looks at aspects of learning in a group of individuals “who wish to undertake
the highly meritorious service of teaching regular classes for the spiritual education of
children” (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 1).
The statement that considers man as a mine rich in gems which education can bring out.
(Bahá’u’lláh, 1983) is a core element of a conceptual framework that governs every
educational activity, and stands at the centre of the empirical data I have observed; four
participants that are engaged with a tutor in a ‘collaborative study’ of a curriculum
applied in virtually every corner of the world, called: Teaching Children’s Classes, Grade

\[1\] These concepts have been part of my life over the last 25 years, having lived in Israel and
Northern Ireland for over 11 years, and being in close contact with the Persian and Arabic
culture for over 20 years.

Worldviews: the world as an organic whole or the world as a jungle?
What motivates me to keep on learning is my perspective to view the world as an organic
whole, much like that of a human body where the different parts are connected to form a
whole, rather than as a jungle, where the strongest, the most powerful wins. This leads me
to the assumption that humanity has the responsibility to care for this organic whole.
Recognizing this however does not represent an influence able to establish in the
consciousness of people a new system of values. A “breakthrough in understanding that is
scientific and spiritual [...] will empower the human race to assume the trusteeship toward
which history impels it” (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 98). I have outlined below my perspective
on reality and how history is not only a series of happenings, but a process of
development.
Perspective on reality
I take a Bahá’í view of the harmony between science and religion by drawing parallels
between physical and spiritual reality. The table I provide in the Appendixes: Appendix
C: A perspective on reality considered overly reductionistic by the author (Lample, 2009)
gives certain insights that emerge from a comparison of the levels of comprehending
reality. Lample proposes four levels in order to distinguish between the levels of
theoretical and practical knowledge.
Telos
I take the teleological view that “history is not only a series of happenings, but rather is in
a process of development” (Tuomi, 2001, p. 37). I view humanity as an organic entity
that, in its collective life, undergoes evolution towards maturity. Today, humanity stands
at the threshold of maturity and the distinguishing attribute of this maturity is the
unification of the human race. My belief in the oneness of humankind stands at the center
of a conception of existence within which the nature of the fundamental processes and
structures of the collective life on the planet are defined. I have included a summary of a
perspective on history in the Appendixes: Appendix D: A perspective on history.
Nonfoundationalism as an alternative to foundationalist or relativist views
Seeking to advance on a path of learning that reduces ambiguity, where the mind does
have access to reliable knowledge, I am aware that my understanding is influenced by
circumstances and factors such as language, time, space and the people that I live with. A
nonfoundational approach to knowledge, as Lample (2009, p. 178) states, “recognizes the

legitimacy of different points of view and the limitations on certainty”, but unlike a
relativistic approach, “it permits judgments about inadequacy or error”. While Bahá’í
teachings indicate that human capacity for comprehending reality is circumscribed, they
also make it clear that the mind does have access to reliable knowledge. Schwandt (1996)
in (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005, p. 922) states: “We must learn to live with uncertainty, with
the absence of final vindications, without the hope of solutions in the form of
epistemological guarantees. Contingency, fallibilism, dialogue, and deliberation mark our
way of being in the world. [...] these ontological conditions are not equivalent to eternal
ambiguity, the lack of commitment, [and] the inability to act in the face of uncertainty”.
Wholeness rather than fragmentation
When I observe human activity, I am convinced that I make statements that describe a
tiny fragment of social reality. Bohm (1996, p. 7) states that this “fragmentation is
continually being brought about by the almost universal habit of taking the content of our
thought for a ‘description of the world as it is’”, and that “it is just because reality is
whole that man, with his fragmentary approach, will inevitably be answered with a
correspondingly fragmentary response”. As a researcher, I need to give attention to this
habit of fragmentary thought, I need to be aware of it, and thus bring it to an end. My
approach to reality may then be whole, and so my response will be whole.
1\.2 Main idea about this research
As a member of the Bahá’í Faith and a researcher, I need to take a critical look at my
religion. Bahá’ís believe that the crucial need facing humanity is to find a unifying vision
of the nature of human being, the purpose of life and of the future of society. Such a
vision unfolds in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá’í Faith (Bahá’í
International Community, 2010). Furthermore, the object of the Bahá’í Faith is to “to
effect a transformation in the whole character of mankind, a transformation that shall
manifest itself both outwardly and inwardly“(see Appendixes: document 4). Education is
regarded as a powerful tool to achieve this object. Thus, at the heart of the Revelation of
Bahá'u'lláh is the force of transformation, both of the individual and of society. The
individual is encouraged to start a process “tied to the centering of one’s energies on the
betterment of humankind and serving the needs of the community and the larger society.
[...] Thus, Bahá'ís are actively engaged in developing knowledge, skills, and spiritual

insights that enable them to act as effective human resources and which are vital to the
integrated process of personal and social transformation.
Presently, such collective learning takes the form of study circles—a local, collaborative,
self-directed learning process being undertaken by Bahá’í communities around the world.
All are welcome in the classes, regardless of their ideas or beliefs. [...] Participants in the
courses learn, for example, to teach values to children, to engage in community service
activities, to assist and empower others to independently investigate spiritual truths, to
learn how to competently express one’s views, and to engage themselves in serving the
broader needs of society for unity, justice, and equity. Participants in study circles often
experience a new sense of direction in life, better relationships with family and friends,
and a fruitful re-evaluation of the contribution one can make to the wider community”
(Bahá’í International Community, 2011a); see also Appendix K: Sequence of courses:
purpose and practice elements.
1\.2.1 Learning as an issue: learning, consultation and participation
Wenger outlines the social perspective on learning in twelve principles: learning is
inherent in human nature; it is first and foremost the ability to negotiate new meaning, it
creates emergent structures, it is fundamentally experiential and fundamentally social, it
transforms our identities, it constitutes trajectories of participation, it means dealing with
boundaries, it is a matter of social energy and power, it is a matter of engagement, it is a
matter of imagination, it is a matter of alignment and it involves an interplay between the
local and the global (Wenger, 1999, p. 226–8).
Learning that attempts to bring about social change needs to include the following four
elements: study, action, reflection on action and consultation.              They are interacting
components, intertwined and interconnected (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 132).
The term consultation that I use in this context and throughout the study is a distinctive
method of non-adversarial decision-making, a procedure for building consensus and
investigating truth, and a vital instrument for social criticism. The administrative bodies
of the Bahá’í Faith at all levels learn to apply this method and it is suitable for individuals
and groups to use (Appendix B: Consultation).
Wenger (1999, p. 55) uses the term participation “to describe the social experience of
living in the world in terms of membership in social communities and active involvement

in social enterprises”. This study looks at participants engaged in “collective learning
[that] takes the form of study circles – a local, collaborative, self-directed learning
process being undertaken by Bahá’í communities around the world. All are welcome in
the classes, regardless of their ideas or beliefs” (Baha’i International Community, 2011).
I have chosen to observe a group of participants engaged in a content-based course that
provides them with skills and abilities to teach children’s classes.
1\.3 Research questions – significance of the study
In order to gain more insights as to how participants learn to bring about individual and
social transformation, I will focus on three main questions:

> 1. How does learning take place in the study circle?
> 2. What tools are used by the participants and how do they shape their learning?

3. How does the participants’ multivoicedness influence the learning process?

When we are engaged in a practice, we learn. “Learning is the engine of practice, and
practice is the history of that learning” (Wenger, 1999, p. 96). Whether the group has
learned to apply what they have learned –teaching regular classes for the spiritual
education of children– will only become visible as they apply their learning through
action. “As in science, where theory is tested by experimentation, spiritual insights must
be tested by their expression in the world. The aim is to give effective material form to
spiritual truth. Interpretation creates meaning. But meaning is tested in action, and action
shapes reality” (Lample, 2009, p. 47).
Significance of the study
I am convinced that this study gives the participants deeper insights into the learning
processes that take place as they engage in finding useful concepts and develop tools in
order to educate children. This study provides an increased understanding into tutor-
student relationships.
This study is a contribution to the research literature that explores learning processes in
study circles the world over, and contributes as to how learning will look like in the
future. The internet and social media tools constantly provide information, knowledge
and tools for learning in new individual and collaborative ways. A report by the European
Commission called: School’s Over: Learning Spaces in Europe in 2020: An Imagining

Exercise on the Future of Learning (Miller, Shapiro, & Hilding-Hamann, 2008), builds on
the premise that the context for learning is already changing, and that in the 21 st Century
Learning-intensive Society, Learning Spaces are the next school. It is significant that the
content based curriculum, a major tool in this study circle activity, relies on tools (paper,
writing material) that are normally available even in remote corners of the planet,
allowing participants to learn together.
While this study does not attempt a critical analysis of the content of the course that the
participants are engaged in, there is growing evidence that in multicultural and
multilingual contexts, we need to provide learning spaces, and define common values for
children and teachers. Tuomi in her book Human Dignity in the Learning Environment,
“focuses on how to provide children with tools to prevent problems from starting, dealing
with the problems that occur and creating a milieu conducive to learning” (2001 book
cover). She presents a theory for the “realization of a just, diversity-positive environment
in schools with a practical application in a two-year action research intervention with
school starters” (Tuomi, 2001).
I decided to observe and analyse a study circle, in order to give the reader insights into the
kind of tools that are offered by the curriculum and how they are used by the participants.
This study questions critically the practices offered through Bahá’í study circles. The
insights gained offer participants, tutors and study circle organisers avenues to improve
practices and increase awareness of the elements that influence object and outcome.

2 CHAPTER TWO: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Bahá’í texts claim that the object of every religion is to transform the whole character of
mankind. When members of the Bahá’í community engage with their friends in studying
and completing the course material that aims to give them skills for teaching values to
children, they use a particular method.
A selection of current research has given me insights into how learning takes place. There
are many kinds of learning theory. Learning is a natural concern for students of
neurological functions. Learning has traditionally been the province of psychological
theories that include behaviourist (Skinner, 1988), cognitive (Wenger, 1987),
constructivist (Piaget, 1954), and social learning theories (Bandura, 1977), and some
theories have moved away from an exclusively psychological approach, towards a
cultural-historical school of thought (Vygotsky, 1978); activity theory (Engeström, 1987),
socialization (Parsons, 1967), and organizational theories (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).
For this study I have taken the perspective of the cultural-historical school of thought in
the legacy of Vygotsky, Leont’ev and later on Engeström to look at learning activities.
The Bahá’í perspective on education states that “learning is the educative object of any
study circle. Education is a continuous and creative process. Its aim is to develop the
capacities latent in human nature and to coordinate their expression for the enrichment
and progress of society.” (Document 18, see Appendixes).
Commonly used terms describe and show aspects of learning and development. I can
think of statements made, that indicate that learning has taken place, such as: “I have
changed, I have come a long way, I have learned how to ..., “. They include forward or
backward movement. A process has taken place. The Bahá’í community encourages
learning and development, with a focus on individual and social transformation.
Many theories of learning focus on processes where an individual or a group acquires
some identifiable knowledge or skills in a way that a corresponding, relatively lasting
behavioural change is observed, and this presupposes that the knowledge or skill to be
acquired is itself stable and well defined, and the teacher knows what is to be learned.
However, people and groups often learn things that are not stable, not well defined or
even understood ahead of time. This is true in important transformations of our personal
lives.

2\.1 Learning: constructing a social-cultural view on learning
Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus suggest that individuals pass through five distinct stages from
novice to expert when acquiring skills, be they technical, such as building a house, or
intellectual, such as analyzing a text (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 2000). The reader may be
familiar with the example of learning how to drive a car with a manual transmission, and
the amount of facts, rules, procedures, circumstances and practice necessary in order to
become an expert driver.

> “Continual practice and accumulation of experience, knowledge and action become
> integrated into a coordinated pattern without the need to remember context-independent
> facts and rules. At an expert level, the driver seamlessly integrates shifting gears into
> other aspects of driving practice, and can even simultaneously juggle other tasks like
> eating or talking on a cell phone” (Lample, 2009, p. 63).

Participants in the study course acquire some of the skills and gain insights through
participating in the activity of discussing, asking questions and drawing conclusions.

> “[L]earning skills in Bahá’í practice follows similar stages. Therefore it may appear, at
> the beginning of a new endeavour, that the process is fairly mechanical. We cling to the
> guidance as if applying a formula. But this rigid and inflexible behaviour, which is a
> natural part of learning something new, gradually becomes more sophisticated and
> adaptive with the accumulation of more and more experience” (Lample, 2009, p. 64).

Participating systematically in study circles is a relatively new practice. This study shows
that the tutor demonstrates flexibility in using the curriculum in a way, suited to her ‘way
of doing things’.
Flyvbjerg (1998) wanted to know how new skills come into being and outcompete old
ones. He proposed a sixth stage for innovation. Later, Hubert Dreyfus (2008) embraced
both a sixth and a seventh stage, taking into account innovation and practical wisdom.
The example of learning how to drive a car has an element that has not been mentioned:
the driving instructor.
Vygotsky (1978) developed the concept of a zone of proximal development (ZPD); the
difference between what a learner can do without help and what her or she can do with
help. “Through collaboration one can achieve to higher level outcomes than by working
alone” (Tynjälä, 2008). ZPD is the gap between actual competence level (what problem
level a student is able to independently solve), and the potential development level (what
problem level could he solve with guidance from a tutor). ZPD is based on the mental
functions that have not yet matured but are being in the process of maturation. ZPD states

the role of the tutor as a necessary mediator of the learners’ cognitive development. This
development may also be traced with the elements of rules and division of labour in
activity theory. In Vygotsky’s view, learning is an interactive, interpersonal activity
where the tutor and participants co-construct the solution to a problem, where inequality
between the tutor and the participants resides only in their respective levels of
understanding, where authority is shared and where the psychological mechanism is to
create (external) activities that will be later internalized by the participants.
Lave and Wenger (1991) emphasize the social character of learning as well. They “place
the emphasis on the whole person, and by viewing agent, activity, and world as mutually
constitutive, they give us the opportunity to escape from the tyranny of the assumption
that learning is the reception of factual knowledge or information” (1991). They suggest
that learning is “a process of participation in communities of practice, participation that is
at first legitimately peripheral but that increases gradually in engagement and
complexity” (1991).
2\.1.1 Learning as acquisition or participation?
Individuals not only learn by themselves. They learn together with others. Learning is
relational. Sfard (1998) suggests that learning can be viewed in metaphorical terms as
either being acquisition or participation. She warns of the dangers of just choosing one
metaphor and provides a table with the metaphorical mappings, using six concepts,
showing what they mean for the acquisition metaphor and the participation metaphor.

2\.2 Learning as dialogue with the environment
My study explores conditions that promote sustained participant engagement and a
willingness to engage in discourse aimed at increasing understanding (Wells, 2001, p. 1).
According to Vygotsky (1988), the relationship between the individual and the culture of
which he or she is a member is one of interdependence and in their development, each
shapes and is shaped by the other. When we discuss knowing in action and reflection,
Wells states that “knowledge is only truly known when it is being used by particular
individuals in the course of solving specific problems”, and thus “it is on knowing in
action undertaken jointly with others that the emphasis needs to be placed, and on
opportunities for reflecting on what has been learned in the process (Wells, 2001, p. 9).
Regarding discourse and knowledge, Wells brings together Vygotsky’s insights about the
role of discourse in the individual’s appropriation and mastery of the “higher mental
functions”, and two of Bakhtin’s ideas concerned with the essential dialogicality of
discourse; the principles of “responsivity” and “multivoicedness” (Bakhtin, 1983). Our
meanings are taken over from others as well as being our own constructions. These ideas
help in the attempts made to situate knowing and coming to know in the co-construction
of meaning that takes place in discourse that is truly dialogic. Knowledge building takes
place between people doing things together, and at least part of this doing involves
dialogue (Wells, 2001, p. 13–14).
For Singh monologic communication involves persuasive communication in which the
“speaking” party attempts to alter the “listening” party’s stance, with little or no
expectation of altering their own position. Dialogic communication is then
communication in which both parties problem solve and arrive at mutually altered
positions (Singh, 2008, p. 66).
For Idan, the transformation from mass and monologic communication to conversational
dialogic communication is one of the three most defining characteristics of change, the
other two being the transformation from mass representational democracy to direct
communal democracy and the transformation from one-to-many education to many-to-
many education (Idan, 2010).

Dialogical Inquiry and knowledge
If we are dialogical beings—always engaged in conversation, interpretation, and action—
then the dynamics of understanding underlie and pervade all human activity. I take a view
shared by Gadamer, Habermas, Rorty and Arendt, summarized by Bernstein (1983):

> There are no universal frameworks for knowing; however, progress is possible.
> Knowledge is obtained through a process that associates hermeneutics and praxis,
> that is, interpretation and action. Understanding is a form of practical reasoning and
> practical knowledge. The investigation of reality and discovery of new knowledge
> comes from a community in discourse. As a community engages in dialogue, a
> tradition emerges over time. On some questions, at a given point in history, two
> inquirers can come to different conclusions without either using faulty logic or
> method (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 95).

2\.3 Bateson’s levels of learning – Knowledge creation
Bateson (1972) views learning as a systemic phenomenon (Tosey, 2006). Three levels of
learning are distinguished. Learning (I) refers to conditioning, acquisition of responses
deemed correct in a given context. Wherever Learning (I) is observed, Learning (II) can
also take place. Rules (explicit and tacit) and patterns of behaviour, characteristic to the
context, are acquired. When the context bombards participants with contradictory
demands, Learning (II) creates a double bind (if, for example, your employer tells you to
do a job, but doesn’t allow enough time for you to do it, and you are in danger of losing
your job if you question the situation, you are in double bind), and such pressures can
lead to learning (III). The sense and meaning of the context is radically questioned and a
wider alternative context is constructed. Learning (III) is a collective endeavour and these
processes are rare and dangerous. The conceptualization of Learning (III) was not an
elaborated theory. The theory of expansive learning (Engeström, 2001) develops
Bateson’s idea into a systematic framework, and is seen as a learning activity which has
its own typical actions and tools. The object of expansive learning activity is the entire
activity system in which the learners are engaged. Expansive learning activity produces
culturally new patterns of activity.

Knowledge creation
Organizational theories concern themselves both with the ways individuals learn in
organizational contexts and with the ways in which organizations can be said to learn as
organizations (Wenger, 1999, p. 280). They need to describe the processes or actions that
make the learning process. Nonaka and Takeuchi’s (1995) framework of cyclic
knowledge creation is based on conversions between tacit and explicit knowledge.

Figure 1: Framework of cyclic knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995)
Locating knowledge creation helps to provide insights into how we learn and what the
key actions of learning are. Knowledge creation may come from outside the group that is
engaged in an activity and it may happen in the activity. What is to be created (in my
study: children’s classes) and learned (concepts, skills and abilities) may be partly a
decision given by the curriculum and therefore outside the bounds of the local process
and partly constructed in local practice.
A crucial triggering action in the expansive learning process (Engeström, 1987) is the
conflictual questioning of the existing standard practice.

2\.4 Summary: Sociocultural perspective on learning
The sociocultural perspective views learning as a process of appropriating tools for
thinking, that are made available by social agents who initially act as interpreters and
guides in the individual’s cultural apprenticeship.
Sociocultural theory locates all human activity in a particular historical, cultural and
institutional context. Human behaviour cannot be understood by focussing on the
individual in isolation nor by considering the individual only in face to face interactions
with social agents such as parents or teachers. Episodes of social interaction need to be
located in more encompassing political, cultural, and historical contexts.
An anthropological interpretation of ‘learning as participation’ tends to lose sight on what
learning really is, and that the action theoretical approach to learning, on the other hand,
tends to lose sight on the sociocultural embeddedness of all learning. He suggests
combining both approaches. When learning is to be seen as a cultural phenomenon
embedded in cultural activities, it is necessary to explain the aspects of meaning in
learning as well. A sociocultural explanation of learning can only be complete when it
can account for the process of meaningful learning. In short: learning is a process that
describes the changes in both the structure of human actions and the meaning of human
actions.

3 CHAPTER THREE: LEARNING AS                                    ACTIVITY: ANALYTICAL

FRAMEWORK
I will now present some key aspects that seem relevant for the purpose of my study.
Learning always take place in a social and cultural context and this setting needs to be
included when exploring learning processes. Cultural historical activity theory includes
these elements that together make up the unit of analysis. Activity Theory is a framework
or descriptive tool for analysing interactions within a system. People are socio-culturally
embedded actors. There exists a hierarchical analysis of motivated human action (levels
of activity analysis). The originators are Vygotsky, Leont’ev, Luria, and others starting in
the 1920s.
Activity Theory is more of a descriptive meta-theory or framework than a predictive
theory, and considers the entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations,
etc.) beyond just one actor or user. Activity theory accounts for the environment, the
history of the person, culture, the role of the artefact, motivations, the complexity of real
life action, etc.
Activity theory has its focus on the structure of activities as historically constituted
entities, is essentially a systemic approach, is dynamic and can be used by a variety of
disciplines to understand the way people act. Activity theory is a heuristic method, an
experience-based technique for problem solving, learning, and discovering.
The premise of activity theory is that a collective activity, with the basic purpose shared
by others (community), is undertaken by people (subjects) who are motivated by a
purpose or towards the solution of a problem (object), which is mediated by tools and/or
signs (artefacts or instruments) used in order to achieve an outcome (University of
Warwick, 2011). The activity is constrained and influenced by cultural factors including
conventions (rules) and social organisation (division of labour) within the immediate
context and framed by broader social patterns (of production, consumption, distribution
and exchange). Engeström’s model below shows the structure of a human activity system.

Figure 2: The structure of a human activity system (Engeström, 1987)
Activity theory provides a conceptual framework from which we can understand the
inter-relationship between activities, actions, operations and artefacts, subjects’ motives
and goals, and aspects of the social, organisational and societal contexts within which
these activities are framed.
The idea of internal contradictions as the driving force of change and development in
activity systems, powerfully conceptualized by Evald Ilyenkov (1977; 1982), began to
gain its due status as a guiding principle of empirical research. When activity theory went
international, questions of diversity and dialogue between different traditions or
perspectives became increasingly serious challenges, and the third generation of activity
theory has to deal with these challenges. The third generation of activity theory needs to
develop conceptual tools to understand dialogue, multiple perspectives and voices, and
networks of interacting activity systems. In this mode of research, the basic model is
expanded to include minimally two interacting activity systems.
Engeström’s model above (figure 1) is useful for understanding how a wide range of
factors work together to impact an activity. In order to reach an outcome it is necessary to
share an object and to actively collaborate to put this object into concrete human activity.
Human activity is mediated by artefacts (e.g. tools used, documents, recipes, etc.)
Activity is also mediated by an organization or community. In addition, the community
imposes rules that affect activity. The subject works as part of the community to achieve
the object. An activity normally also features a division of labour.

Leont’ev distinguished a three-level model of activity: activity, action and operation.
Collective activity is driven by an object-related motive. Individual or group action is
driven by a conscious goal, and automatic operations that are driven by conditions and
tools of the action at hand (Leont’ev, 1978).
The four principles described below form an integrated system, as they are associated
with various aspects of the whole activity. They are of relevance for my investigation
about study circles.
   (object-orientedness) People live in a reality that is objective in a broad sense: the

> things that constitute this reality have not only the properties that are considered
> objective according to natural sciences but socially/culturally defined properties as
> well.
   (internalization/externalization) Internal activities cannot be understood if they

> are analyzed separately from external activities, because they transform into each
> other. Internalization is the transformation of external activities into internal ones.
> Internalization provides a means for people to try potential interactions with
> reality without performing actual manipulation with real objects (mental
> simulations, imaginings, considering alternative plans, etc.). Externalization
> transforms internal activities into external ones. Externalization is often necessary
> when an internalized action needs to be “repaired,” or scaled, and is important
> when collaboration between several people requires their activities to be
> performed externally in order to be coordinated.
   (mediation) Human activity is mediated by tools in a broad sense. Tools are

> created and transformed during the development of the activity itself and carry
> with them a particular culture – historical remains from their development. So, the
> use of tools is an accumulation and transmission of social knowledge. Tool use
> influences the nature of external behavior and also the mental functioning of
> individuals.
   (research method – development) Development is not only an object of study; it

> is also a general research methodology. The basic research method in Activity
> Theory is not traditional laboratory experiments but the formative experiment
> which combines active participation with monitoring of the developmental
> changes of the study participants. Ethnographic methods exist today that track the
> history and development of a practice.

I will describe below five main foci when analysing a learning cycle.
3\.1 Activity system: etic view – Participants’ multivoicedness: emic

view
The main unit of analysis is a collective, artifact-mediated and object-orientated activity
system, seen in its network relations to other activity systems. Activities such as content
based course offered by educational organisations are called ‘shells’. Madyarov suggests

> a construct of a shell to denote such a ready-made, pre-packaged environment that
> includes all the elements of an activity system except for the subject and object.
> Courses in modern school-going often represent such shells in that they have a
> structure imposed upon students, where they could bring in their existing objects,
> develop new ones, or simply perform a number of isolated actions not oriented
> towards any object, much like Engeström (1987) suggests. The idea of a shell is
> somewhat opposite to the organic formation of a human activity in that it is not
> constructed by the subjects of the activity.
> ... Thus, a shell is in a way an inorganic context in that individual subjects entering it
> from outside have not created it on their own to suit their motives. Sometimes they
> match the needs of the subjects and their objects very well, and such courses are
> considered successful. When they do not, however, the subjects decide to comply by
> forming their own objects or by bringing in those that would naturally fit the shell
> (Madyarov, 2008, p. 144) .

Subsequent analysis is needed, in order to determine how far the activity of the
collaborative study circle is constructed by participants.
Participants and their multivoicedness – emic view
Activity systems are multi-voiced with subjects that have multiple points of view,
traditions and interests. Multivoicedness is the attribute of the individual, whose actions
are influenced by participation in other communities, and where these participants in
other communities shape and contribute to what that individual is in a particular time and
place.
The division of labour in an activity creates different positions for the subjects, as they
carry their own diverse histories, and the activity system itself carries multiple layers and
strands of history engraved in its artifacts, rules and conventions. The multivoicedness is
multiplied in networks of interacting activity systems, and is a source of trouble and
innovations, demanding actions of translation and negotiation.

3\.2 Historicity of an activity system – Contradictions
Activity systems take shape and get transformed over lengthy periods of time. Their
problems and potentials can only be understood against their own history. History itself
needs to be studied as local history of the activity and its objects, and as history of the
theoretical ideas and tools that have shaped the activity (Engeström, 2001). Cole (1996)
demonstrated that activity theory needs to understand the simultaneous co-existence and
interaction of various different cultures and activities - not just the historical evolution of
a single culture. For the purpose of this study, I will look at the historicity of study circles
as an activity, and that of the tutor, acting as a tutor, throughout the instances analysed,
using a discourse analysis approach.
Contradictions – when people are at cross-purposes
Contradictions take a central role as sources of change and development. They are not the
same as problems or conflicts, but are historically accumulating structural tensions within
and between activity systems. Activities are open systems. When an element from the
outside is adopted (for example a new technology or new object), it often leads to an
aggravated secondary contradiction where some old element (for example, the rules of
the division of labour) collides with the new one. Such contradictions generate
disturbances and conflicts, but also innovative attempts to change the activity. Russell
(2001, p. 64–82) states that contradictions occur when people are at cross-purposes. I
favour this, as the term contradiction is usually used when affirmations, ideas or actions
exclude themselves mutually. In activity systems, what happens more often is that people
have slightly different purposes while engaged in the same activity.
Engeström (1987) proposes primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary contradictions.
Primary contradictions arise within the elements of the activity system: subject, object,
instruments, community, rules and division of labour. In school settings with a capitalist
socio-economic formation, the primary contradictions in the elements of activity acquire
the nature of use and exchange value. Learning can be viewed as a use value-oriented
(genuine interest) or exchange value-oriented (for the sake of the grade) activity
(Madyarov, 2008, p. 340). Secondary contradictions are those that emerge between these
elements within an activity system. Tertiary contradictions arise when a culturally more
advanced activity within the central activity of interest introduces a more advanced

object or motive. Quaternary contradictions exist between the central activity system and
the outside systems (Madyarov, 2008, p. 34).
3\.3 Expansive transformations
Qualitative transformations take place in activity systems over extended cycles. As the
contradictions of an activity system are aggravated, some participants begin to question
and deviate from established norms. This may turn into collaborative envisioning and a
deliberate collective change effort. An expansive transformation is accomplished when
the object and motive of the activity are reconceptualised to embrace a radically wider
horizon of possibilities than in the previous mode of the activity. A full cycle of
expansive transformation is thus a collective journey through the zone of proximal
development of the activity; it is the distance between the present everyday actions of the
individuals and the historically new form of the societal activity that can be collectively
generated as a solution to the double bind potentially embedded in the everyday actions
(Engeström, 1987, p. 174). When the five principles outlined above are cross-tabulated
with the four central questions of any theory of learning, the following matrix below
serves as a framework for summarizing the answers offered by the theory of expansive
learning (Engeström, 2001, p. 150).

3\.4 Summary: Learning as an activity
Learning processes always take place in a social and cultural context. Activity theory
accounts for the environment, the history of the person, culture, the role of the artefact,
motivations, and the complexity of real life action.
The following four principles are associated with various aspects of an activity and form
an integrated system. (a) People live in a reality with things that are considered objective
and have socially and culturally defined properties. (b) People try potential interactions
with reality without performing actual manipulations with real objects. Externalization
transforms internal activities into external ones. Collaboration between several people
requires their activities to be performed externally in order to be coordinated. (c) People
create, use, and transform tools during the development of an activity. This use is an
accumulation and transmission of social knowledge. Tool use influences the nature of
external behavior and also the mental functioning of individuals. Human activity is
mediated by tools. (d) Development is a general research methodology in Activity
Theory, the formative experiment which combines active participation with monitoring of
the developmental changes of the study participants, and ethnographic methods that track
the history and development of a practice.
When analysing a learning cycle, the five main foci are considered. (a) The activity is
described from the outside. An etic view is taken. (b) The activity is described from the
inside, by using the participants’ voices. An emic view is taken. (c) The activity is
described as it took shape and got transformed over time. (d) Whenever people are at
cross-purposes while doing an activity, change and development becomes possible. (e) As
participants in an activity begin to question and deviate from established norms, the
object and motive of the activity are reconceptualised in order to embrace a wider horizon
of possibilities, and expansive transformation is taking place.

4 CHAPTER FOUR: METHODOLOGY
4\.1 Rationale on methodological choices - Research Strategies
I will use cultural-historical activity theory, also known as CHAT (Engeström, 2006) in
order to frame the analysis of the data collected. Such an open framework allows
uncovering some of the relationships between the elements of the study circle seen as an
activity system.
CHAT is a sociocultural perspective that provides rich possibilities for analysing learning
processes; it allows the analysis of the elements that contribute to the learning process and
places processes in larger historical and cultural contexts.
The theoretical paradigms and perspectives shape our research strategies. The approaches
and methods that I use sit on the above theoretical assumptions. Theory and experience
are intertwined and they reinforce each other.
My choice of method was guided by the desire to bring theory and practice as close
together as possible; the wholeness of the method as a way “to rid ourselves of the ever-
present dichotomy between theoretical elaboration and practice” (FUNDAEC, 2010, p.
133).
CHAT seeks to capture learning processes and provides rich insights. The unit of analysis
is a motivated activity directed at an object (goal). Internal contradictions are seen as the
driving force of change and development in activity systems.
4\.2 Methods of Data Collection and Analysis
I had the opportunity to carry out my research with a group of five participants that were
about to start a course on how to teach children spiritual values. Before the beginning of
the course, I was able to meet with the tutor, and conducted a video-recorded interview
with her. As I was not able to attend the five evening sessions with the group, the tutor
agreed to video-record the sessions. Upon my request, she also asked the participants a
few questions about their motives in joining such a course. I did not wish to carry out
extensive interviews as my focus was directed towards the observation and analysis of the
actual activity. I did however ask the tutor to ask the participants at the beginning of the
third session about the impact the activity has had on them. In addition, after the fifth
session, I was able to join the group after their course for an in depth interview on their

progress and what they had learned up to then. This was done over a period of eight
months between December 2010 and July 2011. At that point, the group still had to
complete two formal sessions. This would complete the first part of their coursework. The
next part would include assisting others that hold already children’s classes.
I asked the tutor to video-record five out of seven sessions, lasting each about 90 minutes.
They show the participants with their tutor engaged in completing the curriculum:
Teaching Children’s Classes, Grade 1, book 3 (Ruhi Institute, 1995).
Data collection methods include the initial interview with the tutor before the start of the
course, the written questionnaire at the start of the course, meeting the group after session
five in order to carry out an in depth interview and sharing of my observations and
findings, as well as ongoing observations, personal notes, and email exchanges with the
group.
I use CHAT as the framework to place the collected data, and discourse analysis to
analyze the data. These two tools allow me to answer my research questions. With over
10 hours of recording, I chose to organize the data into meaningful chunks and label them
according to the activity theory approach. I am aware that further analysis with the same
data might no doubt bring to light more insights according to the method of interpretation
used.
The video-recording of the sessions provides the possibility of capturing the multi-modal
sensitivity to conversational data. I observed an underlying calm and peaceful atmosphere
during the sessions, a friendly and respectful manner in which participants talked to each
other, the trusting non-verbal communication and other elements that are an integral part
of the concept of Bahá’í consultation. A brief description of what constitutes Bahá’í
consultation can be found in Appendix B: Bahá’í consultation.
4\.2.1 Interview design
For the first interview with the tutor, (Appendix: Excerpts collected: 1: INT01) I asked
the following questions in Luxembourgish:

> Q1: Please present yourself briefly
> Q2: How did you become interested in the course 3 on children’s education?
> Q3: How are you involved with education and how do you see education in general?
> Q4: How do you view your role as a facilitator?

Q5: Would you like to add anything else?

At the start of session 3, I asked the tutor in an email to ask the participants (Hamed and
Romain were present) the following question:

> Q1: How does the participation in the study course affect your daily life? Are their initial
> experiences, discussions and thoughts?

This question was verbally put to the participants by the tutor as follows in
Luxembourgish:

> “Does participating in the course have an influence on your daily life? Can you already
> notice something?” (19.3.INTS3, line 12)
Care was taken not to ask any leading questions, to keep questions open-ended if
possible, to allow for additional comments to be made. The responses to the interviews
and questionnaires represent a description of multivoicedness and historicity, an element
of activity theory. They possibly confirm subsequent observations during the activity.
4\.2.2 Questionnaire design
For the short written questionnaire given to the participants, before the start of the
session, I asked the following questions (Appendix: Excerpts collected: 2: WQ01

> Q1: Please present yourself briefly
> Q2: How did you become interested in participating in this course?
> Q3: How are you involved with education and how do you see education in general?
> Q4: How do you see this quotation: “Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable
> value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to
> benefit there from”.
> Q5: How do you view your role as a participant?
> Q6: What are your expectations?

Q7: Would you like to add anything else?

4\.3 Data collection
In order to obtain different types of data and allow a rich and multimodal description, I
have collected a number of data sets for this study. Five video-recorded sessions with
the participants (upon my request, this was done by the tutor) present the main body of
data. They are the recording during which participants complete their course work, the
Ruhi book 3. They include the exercises, the readings and the group discussions.
The video- and audio-recorded interview data (I was present during some interviews,
while for others, the tutor asked the questions) represent the feedback and comments
given by the participants.

The written questionnaire data present short passages, during which participants have
written down their comments and answers.
The notes, which include emails and notes from my own observations, provide additional
data which add to a richer description used for this study.
From this large body of empirical data, I have chosen 21 data excerpts, after having
viewed and listened to the data several times. I have selected the excerpts according to
their relevance with my research questions and the general framework of activity theory.
They are brought together further below in an overview grid of data collected and used.
The transcripts of the 21 data excerpts in chronological order are located in the
Appendixes, Excerpts collected.
I have also collected a number of documents, which include a range of primary texts,
written or commissioned by the central authors and institutions of the Bahá’í community,
by individuals or Bahá’í inspired organisations. These 19 documents are brought together
further below in an overview grid of documents used. The documents are located in the
Appendixes: Data collected: Documents.
Being aware that questionnaires and interviews can be subject to numerous interpretations
and challenge the participants in the study to give either the answer the researcher wants
to hear or give a desired answer for them, I chose to relate this data to the recording of the
sessions. Participants were well aware that the sessions were recorded, but their main
object was to complete their workbook together.
I use the elements of the activity system to interconnect data excerpts with a focus on my
research questions that center on the analysis of learning processes. I include a detailed
chronology of the data excerpts in Appendix I.
4\.4 Data analysis through Discourse Analysis
Gee (2005) states that discourse analysis considers how language, both spoken and
written, enacts social and cultural perspectives and identities. In this passage, I have
selected some passages that seem relevant for my analysis.
In my study I looked at aspects on how learning takes place within a study circle. For this
research, the data I collected are: video-recordings and selected transcripts from the

sessions, written comments by the participants, interviews, authoritative Bahá’í texts and
other documents.
When we communicate, we may strive for clarity, but we always are situated in an
historical context and what we say is influenced by our multivoicedness. Reflecting on
what people have said and written, and thereby discovering meaning and interpretation is
the basis of discourse analysis (2005). I have chosen the passages and texts in order to
reflect what the participants and prominent Bahá’í texts have said about learning.
We continuously create language, and giving our listening skills a second chance to hear
what has been said and written becomes a principle of ethics. This attitude, namely, to
listen more carefully and ponder more deeply on what we hear and read, contributes to
make the world a more just and equitable place to live. Following this idea, as Gee states,
we will be better placed to cooperate with others in human endeavours, especially in a
fast-changing, global, culturally diverse (and often dangerous) world (2005).
For Gee, human language serves mainly two closely related functions: to support the
performance of social activities and social identities and to support human affiliation
within cultures, social groups, and institutions. So “when we speak or write we always
use the grammar of our language to take a particular perspective on what the “world” is
like” (2005, p. 1–2).
Bahá’í texts provide a particular perspective on what the world is like and strive towards
a “more just” place to live together. In my study, I have looked at some of these texts and
I have looked at some transcripts of what the participants engaged in the particular study
circle are saying about learning.
For Gee (2005, p. 5), “”truth”, (which he would define “as doing better, rather than
worse, in not getting physically, socially, culturally, or morally “bitten” by the world), is
a matter of taking, negotiating, and contesting perspectives created in and through
language”.
He claims that no set of research tools and no theory belong to a single person, and he
sees his approach to discourse analysis as one where he has freely “borrowed and patched
together”. His approach seeks to balance talk about the mind, talk about social interaction
and activities, and talk about society and institutions. For him “research adopts and adapts
specific tools of inquiry and strategies for implementing them” and that “these tools and

strategies ultimately reside in a “community of practice” formed by those engaged in such
research” (2005, p. 6).
Furthermore, Gee introduces a number of tools of inquiry for D/discourse analysis and
strategies for using them. The way language is used to enact activities and identities is
called “discourse” with a “little d”. But when “little d” discourses (language-in-use) are
melded with non-language “stuff” to enact specific identities and activities, “big D”
Discourses are involved (2005, p. 7). Tools of inquiry study discourse in Discourses.
It is only possible to make sense of what someone has said, written, or done if the person
has an idea who he/she is and what he/she is doing. We have at times access to different
identities and activities that are connected to different sorts of status and social goods, and
this may constitute one source of inequality in society. Analysing and raising awareness
in such matters is a contribution to social justice. “Since different identities and activities
are enacted in and through language, the study of language is integrally connected to
matters of equity and justice” (Gee, 2005, p. 22).
Gee states that “language has meaning only in and through social practices” (2005, p. 8).
In this study, I look in detail at the social practice of the study circle and explore some
learning processes in the Bahá’í context of a collaborative study circle for individual and
social transformation.
Discourse analysis, from a wider perspective, seeks to advance our common enterprise of
understanding how language works in society in order to create better and worse
worlds, institutions, and human relationships (2005, p. 8).
Reflexivity is a property of language where meaning is situated in actual contexts of use.
Language and context can be regarded as being like two mirrors facing each other and
constantly and endlessly reflecting their own images back and forth between each other.
There exists reciprocity between language and reality. Language reflects reality (the way
things are) (Gee, 2005, p. 97).
People build situations by using language to carry out seven building tasks, discourse
situations, situations in which language is put to use:

> an activity or related set of activities (building task 2) in which people take on
> certain sorts of identities or roles (building task 3), contract certain sorts of
> relationships with each other (building task 4), and use certain sorts of sign

> systems and forms of knowledge (building task 7). In such a situation, people and
> things take on certain meanings or significance (building task 1); things are
> connected or disconnected, relevant or non-relevant to each other in various ways
> (building task 6); and various sorts of social goods are at stake in various ways
> (building task 5) (Gee, 2005, p. 97).
(1) Participants in the study circle use language to make things significant, to give them

meaning or value, to build significance.
(2) Participants may use language to get recognized as engaging in a certain sort of

activity.

(3) Participants use language to get recognized as taking on a certain identity or role.
(4) Participants use language to signal what sort of relationship they have, want to have,

> or are trying to have with other people, groups or institutions about whom they are
> communicating; they use language to build social relationships.
(5) Participants use language to convey a perspective on the nature of the distribution of

social goods (e.g.: politics), that is, to build a perspective on social goods.
(6) Participants use language to render certain things connected or relevant (or not) to

other things, that is, to build connections or relevance.
(7) Participants use language to make certain sign systems and certain forms of

> knowledge and belief relevant or privileged, or not, in given situations, that is, to
> build privilege or prestige for one sign system or knowledge claim over another.

In this study, I have been able to analyse some of these elements, by using the activity
theory framework and by looking carefully at the different transcripts. These building
tasks are often supported by the same words and phrases.

After a session had taken place, I picked up the tape at the tutor’s place of work in the city
and she kept me informed about the progress of the group, as well as any new
developments. I would then transfer the tapes to the computer’s hard disk. While looking
at the data thus collected, my efforts went into identifying rich moments, discovering

unusual ‘things’ that occurred and looking for items related to my research question.
Then, during subsequent viewings I used a grid model that allowed me to look deeper into
the data. The grid contains columns for the sections in the curriculum, and the
corresponding comments and interactions made by the participants. From this grid I than
selected pertinent items and transcribe them fully.
4\.6 Context
The Luxembourgish Bahá’í community counts 414 members, 296 adult members, 38
youth between 15 and 20, 27 adolescents (also called pre-youth) between 12 and 15 and
53 children. The Bahá’í Faith was first introduced to Luxembourg just over 60 years ago.
Worldwide, over 350.000 people finished the first course of the Institute, and over
130\.000 people, having finished the course on children’s education, are now potential
children’s class teachers (Universal House of Justice, 2010b).
My study focuses on the activity where five participants were engaged in completing the
curriculum: Teaching children’s classes Grade 1 in Luxembourg. This pattern, where
members of the Bahá’í community, together with their friends, neighbours and colleagues
participate in classes that provide them with the necessary skills and insights in order to
teach children spiritual values, is repeated in every country the world over. As a direct
result of past participants completing a number of books that are part of an educational
program in Luxembourg, as of March 2011, there were 12 regular proximity classes with
58 children. 124 participants have completed the course: Teaching children’s classes
Grade 1.
Teaching children’s classes Grade 1(see Appendix H for the cover illustration) is the third
book that is part of a sequence of courses offered to those interested in teaching values to
children, and more broadly, the process of one’s individual development and fulfilment
tied to the centering of one’s energies on the betterment of humankind and serving the
needs of the community and the larger society. Appendix K provides an outline of the
courses offered at present, together with the units covered, their purpose and any practice
elements.
Those that wish to complete the course: Teaching children’s classes Grade 1 should have
at least completed the first course, available to anyone aged 15 and over, called:
Reflections on the Life of the Spirit. Developed by the Ruhi Institute in Colombia, the
workbook uses an interactive, question-and-answer format that fosters a participatory

learning process in which the entire group develops a new capacity for individual and
social action.
Participating in a collaborative study circle as a student or a tutor is done on a voluntary
basis. The study courses, a form of collective learning, form a collaborative, self-directed
learning process being undertaken by Bahá’í communities around the world, where all are
welcome, regardless of their ideas and beliefs, but with the aim of serving the needs of
the community and the larger society.
Educational program
   Today there is no educational system in the world that can be called “Bahá’í”.

> Such a system can only be created through the efforts of numerous educators
> working in diverse settings and cultures over an extended period of time.
> Nevertheless, certain principles and concepts can be identified that should
> influence endeavours to develop elements of Bahá’í education (Ruhi Institute,
> 1995, p. 1).
   Educational programs are conducted for diverse age groups, from the tender age

> of 5 and 6 to adulthood. Currently, three programs are conducted and the material
> continues to undergo changes as experience in the field advances and as an
> increasing number of curricular elements under development reach the stage
> where they can be made widely available. The main sequence of courses is part of
> a formal educational program aimed at building capacity for service. The
> sequence is conceived in terms of three cycles, each one concerned with the
> spiritual and moral empowerment of individuals from a particular perspective.

The institute that organises the study circles in Luxembourg pays attention to include all
members of the Bahá’í community in their educational activities. The tutor, who is also
the coordinator for organising the study circles on education children, had asked the
participants whether they would be interested in this educational activity, since they had
themselves children and might also be interested in serving as a teacher for children’s
classes.
4\.7 Participants
After consulting with the other coordinators of the Institute and the auxiliary board
member (person appointed in order to assist the community in the propagation of the

Faith), the tutor had identified a number of Bahá’ís that had completed at least book 1
and/or book 2 of the sequence of courses. She had contacted them and four of them
agreed to start the course.
Three of the participants live in the same geographical area, close to the city of
Luxembourg, another participant lives also close to the city and the tutor lives in the south
of Luxembourg. All five meetings that the tutor was able to video-record took place in the
apartment of Anne and Romain, a couple with a young child that currently attends a
children’s class. The meetings took place on Tuesday evenings between January and July
2011\. Although I focus on the material collected until July 2011, the remaining sessions
are being video-recorded and I keep up-to-date with how the group is progressing.
Two participants joined the course at some stage, but didn’t stay on due to other
commitments. According to the tutor, the participants are not close friends and do not
know each other well, although they have met occasionally in Bahá’í activities and
gatherings. They all have young children in need of education. All are members of the
Luxembourgish Bahá’í community, except Anne.
The tutor, in her early forty’s, comes from the south of Luxembourg. She is married with
two children, has grown up in Luxembourg, and works as a teacher in the city, involved
in an innovative school project. Since she has become a Bahá’í a few years ago, she has
completed the sequence of study circle courses, has been appointed coordinator of the
children’s classes within the institute that organises the courses. She holds children’s
classes on a regular basis at her home. Her husband is not a Bahá’í.
Romain, in his late twenty’s, lives in one of the areas around the city centre. He is
married to Anne, who also participates in the course. They have a young boy, attending
Bahá’í children’s classes. Romain works as an educator and sociologist. He has been a
Bahá’í for many years.
Anne, in her late twenty’s, is married to Romain. She has participated in Ruhi book 1.
She grew up in France, speaks French, Russian and English, and holds an administrative
position in the city.
Josefa, in her late thirty’s, lives in the same area as Romain and Anne. She is married to
Paulo, a Portuguese man, who works as a painter and decorator. They are both Bahá’ís,
with three young children. She comes from Brazil, and has moved to Luxembourg a few

years ago. She speaks French and Portuguese. She stays at home and looks after their
children.
Hamed, in his late twenty’s, is married to a Chinese Bahá’í. They live in a flat in another
area around the city of Luxembourg. They have two young children. Hamed works as an
independent real estate developer and speaks fluently Luxembourgish, English, French,
German, Persian and some Chinese. His parents are both Persian. He was brought up in a
‘Bahá’í environment’.
Participants and their use of languages
Participants have used French during the discussions. On isolated occasions, when the
Luxembourgish speaking participants were together, they used Luxembourgish. In
excerpt two and 20, Josefa’s written text has been translated from Portuguese into
English, and the original document in Portuguese is included in the Appendixes, after
excerpt two and 20. The table below lists the participants and the languages they are
familiar with.

4\.8 Limitations and ethical considerations
This study is focussing on a single case study in which participants were engaged in a
learning activity in the frame of a collaborative study circle. No comparisons are made
with other learning groups or individual learning. The instruments and methods that I
apply to the study attempt to uncover only so much and I do not claim that ‘no stone has
been left unturned’. Applying other methods reveal different aspects of the same reality.
Ethical considerations: When conducting my research, I was guided by three
fundamental ethical principles from the Belmont Report: (1) respect for the participants
involved in the study, (2) beneficence, and (3) justice (Bui, 2009, p. 81). I provided the
participants with adequate information so that they could make an informed consent.

Participants were informed as to who was conducting the research, and that I could be
contacted before, during and after the research. I informed the participants about the
purpose and the potential benefits of the study. This research involved to my knowledge
no potential risks. The third principle refers to fairness and equity in the selection of
participants and the distribution of benefits. Participants were selected because they were
part of a group that was about to start a study circle that provided an opportunity for my
research.
In order to preserve a degree of anonymity, I have changed the names of the participants,
as well as names of people and places mentioned in the transcriptions. All of the
participants agreed that the sessions and interviews would be audio and/or video-
recorded.

5 CHAPTER FIVE: DATA ANALYSIS
5\.1 The collaborative study circle as an activity system: a Bahá’í view
5\.1.1 Historicity of the study circle
Any activity system carries multiple layers and strands of history engraved in its artifacts,
rules and conventions; it is a source of trouble and innovations, demanding actions of
translation and negotiation.
The study circle I have observed has a limited duration with a specific object. As an
activity it has been developed over a number of years, in various contexts and
environments, by national and international Bahá’í institutions. Together with actors at
the grass-roots, they continually seek to engage participants in a process of learning.
Consider document 1:
Instance 1: Document 1

> The Ruhi Institute curriculum had been tested and adapted over many years. It has
> enabled the friends in different countries to get the institute system up and running in a
> short time. Rather than having the participants be passive listeners to a wide array of
> unconnected talks, the Ruhi Institute materials seek to engage the friends fully in the
> process of learning. Bahá'ís with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds have found
> the curriculum's deceptively simple approach, based heavily on connecting the believers
> to the Creative Word, both appealing and empowering (International Teaching Centre,
> 2000, p. 5).

Analysis 1: Historicity of the study circle
This passage indicates that the curriculum used in the study circles has been tested and
adapted over many years on a world wide scale; it shows the motive for engaging in a
series of educational activities suitable for diverse cultural backgrounds.
Study circles started in Luxembourg around 2001 and have since evolved, although the
basic material, the curriculum that includes selected Bahá’í quotations, have remained the
same, at least for some of the course material. These collaborative study circles,
presenting the response to an increased educational need within the Bahá’í community are
going to stay and will develop over an extended period of time. This content based
curriculum with a focus on individual and social transformation has been designed with a
minimum of mediating artifacts, rules and conventions, thereby allowing the expression
of diverse cultural and linguistic nuances, as the material is being used in the most diverse
parts of the world.

Collaborators participate in a sequence of currently eight courses (see Appendix K:
sequence of courses: purpose and practice elements) and each course, a study circle, is
considered an activity system. Problems and opportunities have occurred in previous
study circles. The activity system that I looked at required collaborators to have
completed at least Ruhi book one. In addition, learning around the different study circles
has taken place. Over time, the organisers of the study circles, together with the
collaborators have gained experience in Luxembourg and in other parts of the world, in
what constitutes a successful study circle (possibility to expand on the bottom up
collecting of experience and top down suggestion for change as a result). This can be for
example the fact that collaborators make an effort to carry out the service/action tasks
asked for in the curriculum.
The collaborative study circles are “activities that lie at the heart of a current series of
global Plans” (document 3), and “each of the various elements that form part of the
framework of the current series of Plans evolves through a process of learning guided by
the decisions of the Universal House of Justice and overseen by the International
Teaching Centre”. This learning process takes place at the grassroots. It is “characterized
by structured reflection woven into action at the local level, enables materials and
methods to benefit from the experience of the Bahá’í community worldwide in their use,
ensuring their continued efficacy” (Universal House of Justice, 2011 letter to the author).
Historicity of the study circle goes all the way back to the birth of the Bahá’í Faith, whose
purpose is to “effect a transformation in the whole character of mankind [...]. For if the
character of mankind be not changed, the futility of God’s universal Manifestations
would be apparent” (document 4).

Figure 3: The study circle as an activity system

Activity: what type of activity is taking place?

In this study I have observed a group of four participants and a tutor, called collaborators
(term used by the Ruhi Institute to refer to all who study, teach, or apply its courses,
wherever they reside), engaged over a period of several months and six sessions of about
two hours each, in a collective activity: completing book 3: teaching children’s classes:
grade 1. They form what is called a collaborative study circle.

Community: in what environment is this activity being carried out?

The basic purpose of the activity is shared by others (community), interested in learning
skills for the education of children. This community is firstly the Bahá’í community, who
invites their friends and neighbours, to participate in the activity. A growing number of
these study courses are taking place in neighbourhood areas throughout the country.
There is a growing recognition that the Bahá’í community has a valuable contribution
towards achieving a greater social cohesion. Two recent examples demonstrate this: the
presence of the Bahá’í community at the Forum du Bénévolat during one week at the City
Concorde in Bertrange, offering to interested individuals the possibility to become
teachers for children’s classes (see Appendix F: Forum du bénévolat); and the recent
attendance of the Minister of Finance, Luc Frieden, at the yearly celebration of the
National Day in Luxembourg, stating that the value of a religious community or any other
organisation must be the reflection of the contribution it is bringing to the development of
society (see Appendix G).

Subjects: who is involved?

The activity is undertaken by people interested in child education. The curriculum calls
them collaborators (subjects). Students and tutors/facilitators are considered collaborators,
as they share the Institute’s purpose: to use the courses as a means of promoting the well-
being of humanity. In every group, there is always a more experienced person who acts as
a tutor; the other members of the group constitute the “students” who seek the tutor’s help
with their studies. It is however clearly understood by all participants that they are
engaged in a reciprocal process, one in which everyone learns. The responsibility of
learning rests with each participant, who undertakes the active work of learning. The tutor
facilitates this process, and also gains new insights into the material. The relationship is
not that of a learned one with a group of ignorant people (Ruhi Institute, 1999, p. 1).

Object(ive): why is the activity taking place?

The activity has to do with the education of children. This is the object of the activity.
The curriculum states that participants are motivated by a purpose which consists in
educating children and solving a number of practical problems (object) that they are
confronted with. This could for instance be how to deal with children that are agitated,
children that do not wish to share colouring pencils, etc.
The activity is also happening, because the tutor, who is also the children’s class
coordinator for Luxembourg, has called and asked those members of the Bahá’í
community that have children, whether they would be interested in a course on child
education.
Bahá’í institutions worldwide also encourage their members to engage in a process of
change and education, being more systematic and inviting their friends and neighbours to
participate in their activities for individual and social transformation.
Engaging in a collaborative study promotes a more active way of learning, as the
following passage from document 1 in the Appendix section indicates: “[...] the Ruhi
Institute materials seek to engage the friends fully in the process of learning”.

Rules and regulations: are there any cultural norms, rules and values?

The activity is guided by certain conventions (rules, written and unwritten) and has a
certain social organisation (division of labour). This would include the practice of
alternate reading by each participant of the material used. The meeting would usually be
on a Tuesday evening between 8 and 10pm. The activity that I have observed has always
been held at the apartment of the married couple with two children, located closely to
where the other 2 participants live. This meant that the tutor had the longest distance to
drive, about 35 minutes. The hosts would usually serve refreshments. Members of the
group have brought with them certain expectations as they had to complete the study of
book 1 in order to participate in this activity, book 3. This specific rule is applied partly
from the tutor and from the national institute coordinator.
Each member that joins the activity brings along a cultural and historical baggage that
will influence behaviour and norms. As all but one of the participants (Anne) in this study
circle are members of the Bahá’í community, they are influenced by a set of values that
guide their actions and interactions within the group.

Tools: what means are used in performing the activity?

The activity is mediated by a number of tools, signs and artefacts (instruments); the
means that are used in performing the activity. The language used was French and the
textbook was in French, with the option to refer to other languages, such as German
(during session 1, see excerpt 3), the tutor referred to the German book), English or
Portuguese. Three participants have their own course content, book 3 and the two
participants that are married (Anne and Romain), share one copy. Writing material is
used to answer the questions and write their reflections in their book. The tutor is
considered here as a mediating person/agent, someone who has more experience with
the material studied, and would have already undertaken children’s classes. Each
participant brings to the activity tools coming from his or her cultural and historical
background (on a few occasions participants mentioned that Hamed comes from a long
standing Baha’i family. Hamed has cultural roots that link him closely to the founder of
the Baha’i faith. Both Hamed, born towards the end of the 20th century, and Bahá'u'lláh,
founder of the Bahá’í Faith, born at the beginning of the 19th century, share the same
country of birth, Persia). Two of the participants have some musical skills and play the
guitar (singing songs with the children is one the skills that the course encourages).
Additional online tools, such as resources for carrying out the classes, comments and the
sharing of experiences from other participants worldwide are available (mentioned during
session 5 by the tutor).
Tools can become hindrances and weaknesses for the participants, if, for example, a
participant does not speak or understand well the language in which the course takes
place. The tutor and the participants adapt to such a situation through a number of tools
available to them, and are guided by their values.

Outcomes: what is the desired outcome?

The activity system is made up of three sets of outcomes; the desired outcome suggested
in the curriculum; the desired outcome as observed through interviews and observations
of the participants; and the actual outcome, as stated by the participants. In the analysis 4,
table 7, I compare the expected and actual outcome as described by participants.

Expected outcome suggested by the curriculum
Participants are motivated by a threefold purpose: to understand some of the basic
principles of Bahá’í education of children; learning to teach simple children’s classes

consisting of memorization of prayers and quotations, songs, stories, games and
colouring; and to develop the skills and abilities needed to conduct classes for children,
managing the class with a great deal of love and understanding and, at the same time,
with the discipline necessary to create a proper learning environment. Achieving the
outcome includes a number of things: understanding of one of the basic concepts which is
the nobility of man (values); understanding that each human being is a mine rich in gems
which education can uncover and develop (values); participants engage in children’s
education, be it through interaction with their own children and those of others in their
home and neighbourhood, and be it through children’s classes (practice); participants
have gained a number of skills (teach children to memorize prayers and quotations (1),
teach them songs (2), tell them stories (3), teach them games (4) and encourage their
creativity through colouring (5), as well as organising the class (6)). Document 19 in the
Appendix section gives further details what participants are expected to know after the
completing the different units and offers suggestions to the tutor. Appendix L provides a
list of Bahá’í texts, to be read, meditated on and, or to be memorized.

Indicators that measure outcome
Measuring the achievement of some of these goals includes finding indicators. The
number of children participating in a children’s class and the number of participants that
engage in such an activity is currently used as an indicator for success by the institute that
organises the collaborative study circles and assists with the setting up of classes for
children throughout the country. The institute organises regular tutor gatherings, where
tutors can exchange their experiences that would include challenges, achievements and
aspects of the course content. The institute also encourages tutors to accompany
participants in their path of learning, during and beyond the time of the study circle.
The tutor, whose role it is to accompany the participants may ask them to take action: to
assist in a children’s class. This will be one indicator that shows whether learning has
taken place. Each participant has been engaged in a process of learning and has voiced
this in the written questionnaire, excerpts 20 and 21 (see also table 3: overview grid –
kind of data collected and used in this study).

Division of labour
The role of the tutor is to accompany participants along the path of learning, study and
action. The tutor in this activity system is responsible for accompanying the participants

along the path of completing the curriculum. She encourages them to reach their expected
outcomes. In the present study it was the tutor’s role to fix the meetings, to record the
sessions, to move along at a reasonable speed in order to complete the curriculum.
Participants carry out the exercises in the course book. The tutor has completed book 1
and 3. Although it is usually necessary to complete the sequence of courses in order to
tutor a book, I was told by the tutor for this study circle that an exception was made
(verbal comment made to researcher on 30.7.2011). A number of tasks have been given to
some participants. The hosts provide refreshments and snacks. Here it was Romain and
Anne that took care of having their home ready to receive the group.
There is an intense relation between the rules and the division of labour. Out of the
division of labour, rules and regulations emerge and vice-versa.
In this study, the unit of analysis is the activity of the study circle. Activity theory has in
this study partly being used as a tool that participants may use to get a clearer
understanding of the activity they are involved in. After session 5 (excerpt 18), I joined
the group to give them an update on my theoretical ideas and how activity theory may
help them in their learning.
5\.2 The collaborative study circle through the eyes of the participants
5\.2.1 Multivoicedness - voices of the participants
Activity systems are multi-voiced, as each participant carries one or more voices in the
activity. The study circle is a community of multiple points of view, traditions and
interests. The division of labour in an activity creates different positions for the
collaborators, as they carry their own diverse histories.
The five collaborators bring into the study circle their historicity and multivoicedness. I
present them here by going chronologically through the data as they appear.
Instance 2: Excerpts 1-21
Analysis 2: Participants’ Multivoicedness

The tutor
speaks with the voice of a teacher in a relatively new forward thinking school project
(excerpt 1, L1, 5, 10). She speaks with the voice of a teacher exposed to ongoing research
in her school environment and these experiences are brought into the activity (L11, 12).

She voices her view as a Bahá’í and that of an educator, as it is part of her history, her
life experience, and she connects the two voices into one, “because deep down, they say
the same thing”, well si am Fong, datselwecht soen (L14). She makes it clear that
for her learning is happening constantly and something that happens in dialogue and
confrontation with others (L13). She speaks with the voice of the tutor (excerpt 18, L16)
She expresses on a number of occasions her joy of being with children and the beauty of
being engaged in a process of teaching: (L22), schrecklech gär (L05), wat fir mech
flott war (L19), “pour moi c’était très beau, car tous les jours j’ai la chance
d’enseigner” (excerpt 3, L46). This is meaningful, when on the following occasion, je
me sens pas encore cent pour cent à l’aise (excerpt 18, L22), as she reflects as
a tutor on how this study circle went.
The tutor brings out the understanding voice during the sessions, (excerpt 3, L24), or by
asking open ended questions that encourage dialogue among participants (L1), (excerpt
8, L16).
She speaks through a number of different voices that have shaped her over time and
makes her who she is continuously. Some examples include Socrates (L025), Anne, one
of the participants when she refers to her (excerpt 3, L42), a friend of hers (excerpt 9,
L04), in the name of a child in general, or all the children (excerpt 9, L13, 16, 20, 29, 31).
These observations are often when the tutor shares her teaching experiences with the
group.
Occasionally, she takes the voice of the participants: we, mir sinn net vill den
Owend, awer mir schaffe ganz gutt (excerpt 8, L11), (excerpt 9, L02), (excerpt 12,
L01), on va chanter (excerpt 13, L14, 16, 29), on va trouver un Kassettespiller
(L43), or: in the name of the researcher (L37).
The tutor brings in the voice of Hamed, a participant, and Mr Furutan, the person that
Hamed quoted (excerpt 12, L01, 03). This adds weight to what Hamed said as it comes
from a respected and well-known Bahá’í scholar. This is repeated in the last
questionnaire (excerpt 21, L03).
As the tutor reflects on what she as a tutor has learned, she focuses on the concept of
memorization, and how repetition is the mother of knowledge (excerpt 21, L03),
she combines a number of voices: the voice of Hamed, who quoted this short passage on
repetition from Mr Furutan; the voice of her son who talked about the importance of

repetition in the context of mastering Judo, and how while he was in Japan for three
weeks, the Japanese Judo master spent three hours practicing one movement, and the
voice of Ken Robinson, a writer who talks about how 10.000 hours of training can bring
pure joy and happiness, when one has found ‘one’s element’. By combining the elements
of repetition, knowledge and happiness, the tutor voiced in a few sentences her own
voice (1), and the voices of Hamed (2), Mr Furutan (3), her son (4), the Japanese Judo
master (5) and Ken Robinson (6). This description serves as an example of the depth and
richness that historicity and multivoicedness is able to offer when analysing learning
processes. It allows visualising and connecting the different voices used by the
participants. I now wish to briefly describe this aspect for the other participants.

Josefa
starts by taking the voice of ‘we’, presumably she, her husband and the children,
consumed by the daily life and in need of doing something on the spiritual side
(excerpt 2, L3). She takes the voice of someone that wants to give the best of herself,
something that really comes from within (excerpt 2, L5). She voices the wish to
bring out her creative side in order to do things that can be multiplied and thus have real
results (excerpt 2, L7).
Josefa speaks with the voice of ‘we’ in another context, meaning the participants in the
study circle (excerpt 4, L11, 21), or the parents engaged in educating their children, or
the teachers (excerpt 4, L2). Her voice goes back to her family in Brazil (excerpt 4, L9),
taking the voice of those living and working on the fields, that have no formal
instruction, but so much values. She wants to be understood by checking on what she
said: vous comprenez ce que je veux dire?
Josefa takes the voice of those that need to work hard, those that need to develop first, in
order to pass it on to others and our children (excerpt 18, L7, 8, 10). She takes on the
voice of several of her friends (excerpt 19, L2). Josefa had missed two of the six sessions
that had been recorded.

Anne
speaks with the voice of someone, who by being a mother, needs to educate her child and
help him to develop. She speaks with the voice of someone open to learn from the
experience from the other participants and share with them her experiences. It is a
rational voice, eager to know more about child education (excerpt 2, L1, 2, 3, 5).

Anne, being French speaking, takes in the first session a strong voice of someone that
knows how to write French (excerpt 3, L01). This has been analysed in detail further
above. In the passages I have selected, Anne does not express herself a lot verbally. She
has missed session three. She does voice her thoughts during the interview after session
five and for the written questionnaire after session six.
She takes the voice of someone that has got to know better the other participants and
takes on Hamed’s voice, as being ‘only’ parents (excerpt 18, L12), trying to do their best
and “taking” the resources and inspirations a bit from everywhere.
When questioned, Anne takes her voice as someone annoyed by certain practices, ways
of doing an exercise and brings in historicity, as this had already annoyed her some time
ago when she had done Ruhi book 1 (excerpt 19, L1, 3).

Romain
speaks with his own voice as someone eager to learn (excerpt 2, L1), who sees the
education of children as interesting and important (excerpt 2, L2). He takes the voice of
everyone, being responsible for the education of humanity (excerpt 2, L3). He takes the
role of someone that wants to participate in a study so widespread the world over
(excerpt 2, L5), (excerpt 18, l13).
Romain, being aware that Anne, his wife, may not agree with all of the content of the
course, carries to voice of the mediator, the understanding one (excerpt 3, L20, 32, 40,
42), I could imagine that e person, who discovers this idea for the first
time    in   this     book,     that     would       be   much    stronger,         possibly   an
electroshock. (excerpt 8, L30, 32, 34). He takes the voice of the curriculum writers
(excerpt 4, L3), (excerpt 16, L26), the voice of the group (excerpt 8, L2), (excerpt 19, L7,
15), the voice of another participant (excerpt 8, L26) (excerpt 18, L15, 21), the voice of
“one”, ce qu’on sait par cœur, on a toujours avec soi, (excerpt 11, L1),
(excerpt 13, L8, 12, 129), (excerpt 18, L1), the voice of the researcher (L30), the voice of
children (L107), the voice of his parents (L115).
Romain speaks with a voice of confidence regarding the children’s classes, and that it
comes from a pure positive source (excerpt 18, L13).

Hamed
speaks with the voice of a father hoping to play a productive role in the education of his
children (excerpt 2, L3), a learner and a contributor (excerpt 2, L5).

Hamed, borrowing the voice of the tutor (excerpt 4, L16) who makes reference to 50
years ago, picks it up and also refers to the past, il y a 50 ans (excerpt 4, L22), and
also speaks in the voice of “one”, (excerpt 13, L1), (excerpt 15, L29). He then projects
this 50 years ago to 50 years from now (excerpt 4, L24). Hamed takes the voice of the
group (excerpt 9, L9), the voice of the researcher (excerpt 13, L32), the voice of one of
his children (excerpt 13, L96, 98). Hamed had taken the voice of Mr Furutan, covered in
a proverb: repetition is the mother of knowledge (excerpt 12, L2), and making it clear
that it was not his voice (excerpt 16, L15). Here he seems to take the voice of someone
who carries certain norms and values, with respect for a well-known an imminent Bahá’í
scholar, by correcting the tutor and adding “Mr” before the name (excerpt 11, L4).
Hamed brings out his humorous voice, here by using a question, c’est quoi une
cassette (excerpt 13, L1).
In the interview after session 5, Hamed makes a clear distinction in time. What he had
learned now in the study circle made all the more sense and gave meaning to him,
because now, he had children. His context had changed (excerpt 18, L1-5). For Hamed,
his child, at the beginning of the study circle became the mediating artefact, directing
him toward the object of teaching that child (excerpt 18, L11), and giving him the
necessary motivation to engage in a learning process. He takes the strong voice of a
father, who brings context and meaning to values and aspects of Bahá’í teachings, that
used to be only words before. Hamed, in the written questionnaire after session 6, takes
the voice of a confident person, with a desire to teach children’s classes (excerpt 20, L2).
To conclude this description of the multivoicedness and multiple layers of history that the
participants bring to the activity, it is worthwhile drafting a chart where the participants
and their voices are collected.

5\.2.2 Expected outcome suggested by the participants
Participants voiced their expected outcome during the written questionnaire at the start of
session 1, (WQ01), by answering question 6: what are your expectations? I am aware that
this question does not fully answer the question of expected outcome. I include also an
instance from the interview with the tutor before the start of session 1, (INT01).

Analysis 3: Participants’ expected outcome
Josefa hopes to realise a quarter of everything Bahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá’í Faith is
asking. She refers to spirituality, and adds her desire to “create things that can be
multiplied in order to have real results”. This is a clear indication that her expected
outcome includes action. Anne wants to know more about education and about the
children’s’ classes that her son is attending. She will learn from the experience of the
other participants and share with them her experience and knowledge. Anne has clearly
identified that this learning experience has a collaborative nature. Romain, Anne’s
husband, expects from this course that he will be more clear-sighted about the importance
of child education. Romain looks forward to a good study with the rest of the group and
gives education thumbs up. Hamed is uncertain what exactly to expect from this course.
He would like to complete the sequence of courses offered by the Institute, and the theme
of education is especially close to his heart.
The tutor was not directly asked about the expected outcome, however a few insights can
be gained from the initial interview I did with her before the start of session 1 (1. INT01).
By doing again the curriculum of book 3, the tutor is happy to get a different perspective
(L19). The tutor is aware that collaborative learning enhances greatly one’s own
understanding (L22).
5\.2.3 Actual outcome suggested by the participants after six sessions
The observations and the interview after session six show some development regarding
the understanding of the participants. In this activity, actual outcome is a process that
stretches over many months and years. Has the way they educate their children changed
as a result of participating in this activity? The actual outcome may be measured against
the expected outcome suggested in the curriculum and against the expected outcome
suggested by the participants.

My analysis of the short written questionnaire after session six has shown a change from
the initial expected outcome. Before that, I had not observed any participant stating an
interest in giving children’s classes, apart from the tutor, who is already giving children’s
classes. This is what the participants wrote when asked, what was the one thing they had
learned, and what they would do now:

Analysis 4: Participants’ actual outcome
Hamed (L2) feels now capable to teach children’s classes, and the course has given him
confidence and a desire to teach classes. When asked what he will do, he states (L7) that
he is open to the possibility of teaching a class if necessary. Josefa (L5) wants to apply
what she has learned to her kids and those that need education, and (L10) she hopes to do
a children’s class in the future. Romain (L8) states that he is probably available to give
children‘s classes. Anne (L4, 9) tells us about two necessary requirements for teaching:
valorising the child and render the subject interesting. As far as her action is concerned,
she will keep the content of the book in mind. The table below shows expected and actual
outcome analysed above.
The tutor (see instance 2a) has learned more than one thing (L2). She states that
repetition is the mother of knowledge, and she felt uneasy to say this, in a time
where everything should be fun and work by itself (L3). She elaborates this topic by
bringing in her son’s experience, who spent three weeks in Japan in order to practice
Judo, and who stressed the importance of repetition. I have analysed this aspect in an
earlier part on memorization, point j. The tutor has now a clearer understanding about the
concept of the ‘fear of God’ (L10). She wants to do the course on how to become a tutor,
and work on herself so as to stay authentic (true) as regards to all the people. (L13)

Analysis 5: Participants’ objectives
In C2, Romain states the importance of children’s education. In B3, Anne takes the role
of the mother. She has to educate her child, which means for her, helping the child to
develop. In D3, Hamed hopes to play a productive role in the education of his two
children. Regarding the role as a participant, Hamed in D5 mentions his hope to be able to
contribute, without being specific. In B6, Anne shows her interest in knowing more about
education and the children’s classes. Josefa in B6 wants to realise something in terms of
spirituality and values. Hamed in D6 uses the verb ‘parcourir’ (English translation: go
through); he wishes to complete the sequence of Ruhi courses. Again in B7, Josefa uses
an action verb, wishing to “create” things that can be multiplied and have real results.
Throughout the questionnaire, participants do not mention their wish to teach children’s
classes directly. This is clearly expressed in Line 6, when they answer the question: what
are your expectations? Josefa: to realise..., Anne: to know more..., Romain: to
be more..., and Hamed: to go through....

5\.2.5 Contradictions: Being at cross-purposes
Participants of the study circle may be at cross-purposes (Russell, 2001). Primary
contradictions may arise within the elements of the activity system (Engeström, 1987).
Learning can be motivated out of a genuine interest (use value-oriented), or for the sake
of getting a grade (exchange value-oriented). This represents a contradiction between
use value and exchange value of the object of the activity. Other motives are neither use
value-oriented nor exchange value-oriented. In the context known to me, Anne may

participate in this study circle, because her husband Romain is a member of the Bahá’í
community and/or because their son Serge has started to attend a children’s class and she
wishes to be informed about what Serge is learning (excerpt 2). Another motive is the
desire to show obedience towards national and international Bahá’í institutions, since
members trust their judgment, and that Bahá’í institutions form an integral part of the
Bahá’í Faith.
In this study, participants do not usually receive a grade. A certificate of participation has
been given by the organising institute in past study circles. The motive for this seems to
be to encourage and praise participants that have completed a book. (Appendix E: livret
3, certificat de participation). More recently, being a teacher of children’s classes has
been valued as a service to society by an agency outside the Bahá’í Faith (see Appendix
F: Forum du Bénévolat). The five participants each have their motivations for taking the
course, as can be seen from the written questionnaire below, at the start of the study
circle, and from the interview with the tutor before the start of session 1.

> huet mech ëmmer interesséiert,
Analysis 6: Use value-oriented activity
Josefa and Romain clearly express their interest. Anne, married to Romain, a Bahá’í, is
possibly confronted with the situation that their child is attending class and as a mother
she needs to educate her child. Hamed, who is known by the group as someone coming
from a long standing Bahá’í family, makes use of the opportunity to take the course. He

writes later that he has two children and hopes to play a productive role in their education
(Q3).
The tutor (L05) has expressed her great interest and love for the education of children,
thereby clarifying that her motivation is clearly use-value-oriented.
5\.2.6 Rules being negotiated
Participants bring into the activity their own rules, norms and values. The following
observations will show this.

Formality - Politeness as a rule
Hamed is from an eastern background, brought up in a Bahá’í family. During a session,
he would mention the name of a prominent Bahá’í without the title Mister. When the
tutor makes sure that she understood the name correctly and repeats the name, Hamed
corrects her.
01      Tut:    Et puis répéter, toi, tu avais dit la dernière fois, Hamed, hm,

repetition is the mother or father ?
02      Ham:    Of knowledge, mother of knowledge. Mais c’est pas moi, c’est Furutan

qui le dit
03      Tut:    Mais c’est vrai aussi, hm (2.0) et c’est Furutan ?
04      Ham:    MOnsieur Furutan (4.0) qui d’ailleurs était pédagogue je pense
05      Tut:    Oui?
06      Ham:    Je crois qu’il était pédagogue (3.0) je crois
07      Rom:    il me semble bien que oui
Analysis 7: Formality - Politeness as a rule
The tutor has joined the Bahá’í Faith a few years ago and has grown up in Luxembourg.
She may not know Mr Furutan and the fact that he is well-known, at least by parts of the
Persian speaking Bahá’í community. The tutor remembers that Hamed talked about the
value of repetition, but she wasn’t sure how Hamed had phrased it (L1). Hamed confirms
this, but makes it clear that this concept is not from him, but comes from Furutan (L2). In
this instance, Hamed has applied the rule of formality to the tutor, but not to himself. He
emphasises Mr Furutan’s status by adding his profession (L4).

5\.2.7 Language use as a rule and a norm
Anne questioned an expression in the French text that seemed to contain a grammatical
error. The group discussed this issue for over 3 minutes.
01   Ann:    Pour moi c’est une question de langage, alors je suis assez

> surprise de lire « enseigner les (2.0) en enseignant dES
> enfants », d’après moi on enseigne aUX enfants
Analysis 8: Language use as a rule and norm
This was picked up by her, coming from a French culture, whereas the other participants
grew up either in Luxembourg or Brazil. For Anne, speaking French correctly is
important and constitutes an underlying value and an important norm. As Anne is not so
familiar with some of the Bahá’í concepts on education, she is worried that what she read
suggests an interpretation that children are considered to be objects. I analyse this part
also analysed from a monologic versus dialogic discourse perspective (Instance 15).
5\.3 Skill development: Participants negotiate tools given by the

curriculum – an emic view
Participants are expected to develop a number of skills suggested by the curriculum when
they will be carrying out children’s classes. This part starts by looking at a number of
instances where participants negotiate the mediating tools suggested in the curriculum.
In this part, I will show how participants negotiate the skill of memorizing and
understanding the Creative Word (Bahá’í Writings). Participants are encouraged to
understand and memorize themselves selected key passages. They are also encouraged to
teach the children to understand and memorize selected key passages.
Participants bring into the activity their own skills, used as tools. I look at two instances
here: code-switching in order to clarify understanding and the use of monologic and
dialogic discourse/communication.
Participants establish relationships between different elements of the activity systems. I
have looked at two relationships: the relationship between subjects, tools and division of
labour and the relationship between subjects, community and the rules, norms and values.

Skill development through mediating tools
As individuals and groups develop skills in order to achieve their objective, the process
follows stages that are fairly mechanical, with a rigid and inflexible behaviour, towards
gradually more sophisticated and adaptive behaviour, as discussed earlier.
Evidence for such behavior has been gathered from numerous observations where the
tutor offered adaptations to the tools of memorizations, the use of stories, and the use of
colouring material. She also used code-switching in the study circle as a tool for better
understanding.

Mediation
For Piaget, human beings make sense of their world by means of their mental structures.
For Vygotsky, knowledge is viewed as the internalization of social activity. Mediation
means that human beings purposefully interpose tools between them and their
environment, in order to modify it and obtain certain benefits. Mediation is a central
concept in Vygotsky’s view of cognitive development. It offers a complementary
perspective to the behaviourist view. He states that by using activity mediators, the
human being is able to modify the environment, and this is his way of interacting with
nature. Two phenomena marked the mediated relationship of humans with their
environment: the use of tools within socially organized activities and the use of language
as a cultural form of mediation.
5\.3.1 Learning through action: Explaining a game to children
The data example below follows a section in the book that talks about how to teach games
to children. Participants have just read, that in order to teach a game to kids, three things
need to be done very well: “clearly explain the purpose of the game; make sure all the
children understand how to play the game; and make sure they all feel a sense of success
when the game is over.”
21   Ham:    Exercez-vous à expliquer trois jeux différents à vos collaborateurs

((giggles))
22   Tut:    ((giggles))
23   Ann:    ((looks up to Hamed, while smiling))
24   Tut:    Alors tu nous expliques ((giggles while talking))

25   Ham:    (je connais pas de jeux)
26   Tut:    Tu pourrais nous expliquer le jeu « porter le malade » et nous on va

> porter Romain à la cuisine ((giggles))((« carry the sick » )) is a
> game that was introduced and explained in section 10))
27   Rom:    D’accord
28   Ann:    Il faut vraiment le faire ?
29   Ham:    on a compris(2.0)
Analysis 9: Learning through action: explaining a game to children
After Hamed (L21) has read the question that he should explain three different games to
the collaborators, the tutor (L24) asks Hamed to explain. Hamed (L25) probably says that
he doesn’t know any games and the tutor goes on asking Hamed to explain the game they
had just seen in detail in the previous section. While Josefa is busy looking and possibly
writing in her course book, Romain is happy to be part of the game that the tutor proposes
and Anne (L28) is wondering whether it is really necessary to do the game. Hamed’s
response (L29) is simply to state: “we have understood”. After a two second pause, he
goes on reading the next question.
The Bahá’í concept of learning includes 4 aspects that are interlinked: study, action,
reflection on action and consultation (Lample, 2009). This process of learning includes
action and therefore it is suggested that action favours learning. In this instance, the tutor
and Hamed do not take up their role as being responsible for their own learning, as stated
in the first study course (Ruhi Institute, 1999, p. 1). An opportunity to learn through
action has been missed in this sequence.
5\.3.2 Colouring activities for children
The tutor has just read section 13, the last activity for the children: colouring pictures.
The children are given an opportunity to “test their artistic capacities and develop their
concepts of beauty”.
20   Tut:    Donc les coloriages sont ici hm ((flicks through the pages of the

book)) (2.0) ((the participants also flick through their books))
21   Tut:    Mais moi je dois leur dire que ça n’éveille pas trop les sentiments

> de beauté ((she stresses the words « sentiments de beauté » with
> giggles))
22   Rom:    ((giggles))

23   Tut:    Je sais pas ce que vous en pensez? (2.0)
24   Rom:    Pour la plupart je suis d’accord avec toi (2.0)
25   Ann:    Mais il faut les colorier c’est peut-être (plus) ((raises her hand))
26   Rom:    Justement, voilà, ils ont tout misé là-dessus. ((giggles by Anne,

tutor and Josefa)) (2.0))
27   Tut:    Enfin c’est vrai il y a des enfants qui aiment colorier, mais on

> trouve aussi d’autres activités peut-être plus créatifs que enfin
> moi je suis pas trop pour le coloriage
28   Ham:    Il y a toujours la situation qui va avec c’est une leçon en même

> temps ((underneath each drawing is a short quotation that goes with
> the drawing))
29   Tut:    Mais on peut aussi trouver d’autres (1.0) par exemple pour la

> citation « vous êtes tous des feuilles d’un même arbre » je leur
> avait dessinée un arbre et donnée des papiers de différents tons de
> vert et ils ont découpé les feuilles dessus donc c’était un peu plus

> suis toujours étonnée ((giggles)) (4.0)
30   Tut:    voilà?
31   Ann:    (ceux qui ont) de l’imagination de
32   Tut:    oui On peut se débrouiller comme ça ils aiment bien mais on peut

plus varier si on
Analysis 10: Colouring activities for children
The tutor (L21) doesn’t find the colouring pictures too beautiful and seeks (L23) the
opinion of the group. Romain (L24) mostly agrees with her while Anne (L25) suggests
that the colouring might add some beauty to it, and Romain (L26) agrees. The tutor (L27)
takes the voice of the children that like colouring and she has noticed (L29) that they do
and it surprises her. The tutor shares an example (L29) how she made the activity more
creative, but also mentions that not all children have material means to do the activity
differently. She summarizes the topic (L32) by stating that it is possible to get by as
suggested, and children like it or it is possible to add variation to the activity. The tutor
suggests that participants should be flexible and according to their circumstances and
preferences, adapts the activity so that it is enjoyable and helps the children with the
understanding of the quotation.

5\.3.3 Appropriate selection of stories for children
In the example below, the tutor comments on the 15 stories suggested for children in the
curriculum. She shares her experiences about the stories to be learned and to be shared
with the children and how some stories for the very young (aged 4) have not been suitable
in her children’s class.
01    Tut:    C’est quand même très pratique, hm. Surtout quand on commence,

c’est rassurant d’avoir quelque chose …sous la main.
02    Tut:    Mais bon je dois dire, il y a parfois des histoires, … comme j’ai

> les tout petits de 4, 5 ans, par exemple la première leçon, c’est
> sur les <inaudible.1>, et cette histoire là, je n’ai pas
> <inaudible.1>, de la faire. Elle parle donc des gens qui étaient
> contre les bahá’ís, des musulmans, et si tu parles à des enfants
> de 4 ans sur les religions, c’est …, ils auraient rien compris
> hm, alors on a pris une autre histoire, simplement.
03    Tut:    Non il faut aussi parfois prendre une autre histoire, on trouve

aussi tout plein d’histoires sur internet.

Analysis 11: Appropriate selection of stories for children
The tutor stresses the benefit of having stories in the curriculum (L1) and emphasizes the
need to adapt the stories to the circumstances of the children that one is teaching (L2).
She makes a brief reference to the internet as a pool for many stories, thereby
encouraging participants to be open and flexible, and suggesting new tools in order to
achieve the desired objective (L3). The curriculum, which can be viewed as a pool of
tools for the education of children, is adapted to the needs and circumstances of the
children, who are at the heart of education and learning.
5\.3.4 Understanding and Memorization

Comprehension: inappropriate learning task
In this excerpt, participants discuss the difficulty and usefulness of filling in missing text,
as a tool to gain a better understanding of certain essential texts.
Instance 12: Excerpt 19 (INTS5E2)
01   Ann:     Maintenant que je feuille, quand même, il faut que je te

> dise, … mais ces trucs à trou là, ou il faut trouver les
> bonnes réponses, ... c’est très embêtant en fait, c’est pas

02   Jos:   Tu sais c’est quoi ça, car plusieurs copines m’ont raconté la

> même histoire. Quand ils ont fait les livres avec nous. Nous
> rappeler qu’on est tout petit, on commence avec les devoirs
> Les gens se sentent un peu petit. Voyez, ils se mettent pas

((giggles))
03   Ann:   Ah d’accord, mais dans le Ruhi 1 ça m’avait déjà BEAUCOUP

embêté ((giggles by Josefa))
04   Tut:   Donc c’est pas mieux dans le Ruhi 3 ?
05   Jos:   Peut-être il fallait changer un peu, dans la façon un peu

plus adulte
06   Ann:   Où c’est voulu
07   Rom:   Forcément c’est voulu, à ce niveau, c’est (2.0) comment vous

09   Tut:   Hm ((agreeing))
10   Rom:   Mais moi j’ai mis 10 ans à revenir, car ca me dérangeait

énormément aussi
11   Jos:   Oui, oui, c’est plusieurs personnes alors
12   Res:   Ça peut être une recommandation
13   Tut:   À un moment c’était vraiment beaucoup, c’était vraiment la

même phrase.
14   Ham:   C’était non stop, broken record (laughter, tutor) fast

forward
15   Rom:   Le problème c’est que si maintenant on demande à qui que ce

> soit de citer la moindre phrase qu’on a réécrite, qu’on a
> tellement répétée
16   Tut:   Ça va être difficile, hm
17   Tut:   Si c’est pas trop long, ça va
18   Tut:   Ça reste pas
19   Rom:   Ça reste pas
20   Ham:   Ça devient un automatisme

21   Tut:    C’est comme Anne l’a dit, quand c’est trop, on voulait juste

encore finir, hm ?
22   Ham:    E pour les passages qui sont plus brefs, on est stimulé, on

voulait
23   ?       Oui, oui,
24   Rom:    Et au début, on se connaissait encore moins, o la la, il faut

bien répondre, et puis faire ces exercices
Analysis 12: Comprehension: inappropriate learning task
Anne (L1) brings up the subject on filling in the missing text, and how she finds it a bit
childish. Josefa (L2) brings in the voices of her friends and that they had told her the same
story, and she suggests changing it to a more adult way (L5). Anne (L03) brings to light a
past unease with the material and this highlights the influence of historicity in an activity
system. Romain (L10) states that it took him 10 years to come back to participating in this
sort of activity (historicity), as it was for him a great disturbance. Romain (L15)
recognizes that although participants are not happy with the tool of filling in the missing
text, the group has not found an alternative, new way of remembering the texts. The tutor
(L18) suggests that it is ok to fill in the missing text if it is not too long. Hamed (L23)
confirms this and Romain adds the argument that participants didn’t know each other that
well at the beginning. This has made the exercise even more awkward. Romain indicates
here how the participants have got to know each other better after spending five sessions
together. This last element seems to indicate that the participants in the activity have
learned something about each other. This indicates that a group has more chances of
learning together, when they get to know each other.
This passage highlights the benefit of questioning current practices openly. It shows
how the other participants contribute towards possibly changing an existing practice that
seems unessential. Participants resisted using certain tools proposed in the curriculum.
Most participants during the interview after session five voiced their unhappiness about
filling in missing text, as a tool to gain a better understanding of certain texts. The
interview after session five confirmed that the proposed tool in the curriculum, which
consists of filling in the missing text, seemed too childish to some participants. I may
question the participants in further research as to what alternative tools they come up with
in order to become more familiar with essential text passages.

Negotiating: Memorization skill
Participants are encouraged to understand and memorize themselves selected key
passages. They are also encouraged to teach the children to understand and memorize
selected key passages.
I present here some document examples from the curriculum, video-recorded data
samples from the two sessions, an interview data sample, and a written questionnaire data
sample, all related to the subject of memorization and understanding. The data examples
are presented together, followed by the analysis.
Instance 13a: Data: Document 15 (curriculum)
The methodology of the children’s classes combines different activities, all focused on the
principle goal of motivating the development of attitudes and spiritual qualities. All these
activities revolve around the Creative Word, which alone has the power to awaken spiritual
susceptibilities in the children, and a strong emphasis is placed memorizing the Creative Word.
Memorization has an even greater effect if what is being memorized is well understood. For this
reason, each lesson includes material to help children understand the meaning of the quotation, as
well as activities to help further this understanding. Unfortunately, at this point, there is not an
abundance of songs, games and stories which directly reinforce the ideas presented in the
quotations to be memorized. It is hoped that, in the future, many more such activities will be
created and compiled for the use of Bahá’í children’s class teachers (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 3)
Instance 13b: Data: Document 16 (curriculum)
Unit 1: Section 1 [...] By studying the following quotations of Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá you
will begin to appreciate your work as a children’s class teacher. It will help you to memorize these
words and have them always in mind when you teach. [...]
Section 4 Now, memorize the above words of Bahá'u'lláh [...].
Section 8 [...] Read and memorize the following words of Bahá'u'lláh: [...]
Section 10 [...] Memorize the following words of Bahá'u'lláh: [...]
Instance 13c: Data: Document 17 (curriculum)
Some principles of Bahá’í education – Section 3
After you have explained to the children the meaning of a quotation, the next step is to help them
memorize it. Surely, in your life you have memorized many quotations and poems. How can this
be done? Once the meaning of a quotation is understood, memorizing it is very simple. The
quotation is divided into parts and you begin by memorizing the first part. Later, the second part
is learned, and then both parts are repeated together. You continue in this way until the entire
quotation is learned by heart. For example in order to learn the prayer in Section 2, you begin with
“Oh God, guide me ...,” and ask the children, sometimes individually and other times as a group,
to repeat the words. Then you combine “Oh God, guide me” with “protect me ...,” repeat the two
phrases together, then add “...make of me a shining lamp...,” and so on with each phrase until the

end of the prayer. Once the whole group of children has repeated the entire prayer, each child is
patiently helped to recite the prayer by heart.
Undoubtedly, as a conscientious Bahá’í teacher, you will with to begin your new tasks by
teaching yourself. Therefore, when you look at the 15 lessons for children presented further on in
this unit, dedicate some time to studying the meaning of the quotations, thinking about examples
given to clarify the meaning for the children, and memorizing the quotations (Ruhi Institute,
1995, p. 27)

Analysis 13: Understanding and Memorization
a) The Ruhi 3 book curriculum suggests in the introduction to the collaborators
(document 15) the understanding and memorization of passages from Bahá’í texts as tools
for the development of attitudes and spiritual qualities. Songs, games and stories are used
to reinforce the concepts presented in the quotations to be memorized.
b) This document presents four different passages where participants are encouraged to
memorize passages. Further analysis below will show that neither the tutor, nor the
participants, who should be responsible for their own learning (see document 7: “The
responsibility of learning rests with each participant”) memorize these passages during
the sessions or suggest that they should be memorized.
c) This passage explains how the participants, the future teachers of children’s classes,
should help the children memorize Bahá’í texts. The text makes participants aware that
they need to teach themselves before teaching the children, and understand and memorize
the quotations.
d) Romain shares how useful it is to have memorized things, as you carry them with you
all the time.
e) The tutor and Hamed relate repetition to memorization and the acquisition of
knowledge, and by bringing it up, emphasize the use and importance of memorization.
f) The tutor repeats what is stated in the course book; to explain to the children the words
that are to be memorized.
g) The tutor (L12) brings again to the group that Hamed mentioned how repetition was
the mother of knowledge, this time in relation to learning how to play and remember how
to play games (L10).
h) Anne found memorizing through filling the gap childish and quite boring. She wonders
how it could bring her something.
i) Josefa wishes to do the book over and over again (L05). Romain (L08) wants to read
the course again in order to deepen the children-teacher relations. Anne wishes to keep
the book in mind.
j) The tutor (L03) brings out the voice of Hamed, one of the participants, and through him
the voice of Mr Furutan, an imminent Bahá’í and pedagogue, and the concept of

repetition as the basis for knowledge as something she learned during this study circle. As
she is situating herself in the present cultural context (historicity), where everything
should be fun, and should go automatically, she did not wish to insist on repetition. She
(L04-06) then brings in the voice of her son to reinforce her understanding on repetition.
Her son spent 3 weeks in Japan and told him about the importance of repetition, as he
participated in a training course with the national Japanese judo master. She (L07) then
brings in the voice of Ken Robinson’s book entitled: “In my element”. The book is about
finding the things one is comfortable in, then train endlessly, and then realising that the
training is pure joy and happiness.

Memorization that combines texts, sessions, interviews and questionnaires
Document: The curriculum encourages the understanding and memorization of passages
from Bahá’í texts (a). As the participants complete the first unit, they are asked four
times, in the course book, to memorize short quotations (b). Then, in section 3, an entire
paragraph explains to the participants how they may help the children memorize Bahá’í
texts. The paragraph also mentions that before all else, they should teach themselves and
they should memorize the quotations (c).
Sessions: The following 4 session excerpts (d-g) show how participants value repetition
and memorization as a tool to acquire knowledge, that it is necessary to explain the words
to children, and that the repetition of games enables children to get better at it and to
enjoy them more.
Interviews and questionnaires: For Anne (h), it seemed a boring and childish repetition
to fill in the missing text. This was for a specific tool. Overall, in the questionnaire (i),
Anne wishes to keep the book in mind, Josefa wants to the book over and over again and
Romain wants to read the course again in order to deepen the children-teacher relations.
The tutor start to answer the question as to what she had learned by bringing out the
voices of Hamed, and through him Mr Furutan, the voice of her son, and through him the
voice of a Japanese judo master, and the voice of Ken Robinson and his book. For her,
repetition and memorization of the things one feels comfortable with can bring
tremendous joy and happiness.

5\.3.5 Participants bring to the activity their own skills

Code-switching
In this excerpt, as the participants share their understanding about the concept of the ‘fear
of God’, the tutor makes reference to the German word for ‘crainte de Dieu’.
01   Tut:    La parole allemande pour crainte de Dieu, c’est Ehrfurcht, donc il

> y a un peu moins de peur, et beaucoup de respect aussi, non? enfin
> pou (mon) sentiment Ehrfurcht
02   Rom:    Hm
03   Tut:    non?
04           (2.0)
05   Tut:    C’est la crainte mais aussi un énorme respect
06   Pia:    C’est pas seulement peur
07   Tut:    C’est pas seulement peur
Analysis 14: Code-switching
The tutor brings into the group the meaning of the German translation for the word “fear”
(L1), thereby expanding the meaning of this concept for the other participants, which was
acknowledged by Romain (L2) and Pia (L6). Knowing more than one language is seen
here as a tool, allowing for comparison and widening of understanding the concept of the
fear of God. The tutor is more familiar with the German vocabulary, due to her practice
and work with children.

Monologic and dialogic discourse - communication
My observations have shown how participants use different tools, according to their
cultural and historical background. In the following transcript, Anne was concerned about
a language issue. In the French text of the curriculum there seemed to be a grammatical
error that led to a possible different interpretation as to how we look at education. The
participant seemed to use in this instance a monological, rather than a dialogical discourse
(Wells, 2001). Idan talks about the use of monological communication (Idan, 2010). This
concern was not shared with other members, whose first language is not French.
It is shown in Anne’s use of monologic discourse/communication at the beginning of
session 1, excerpt 3. After reading section 1, page 7 of the curriculum, participants are
asked to decide whether a number of statements are true or false. The second question
states: Lorsque nous enseignons les enfants, nous adorons Dieu. vrai  faux

Before line 1 of the transcript, the tutor asks the participants whether they have any
reflexions or questions.
01   Anne       Pour moi c’est une question de de langage, alors je suis

> C’est de choses que je sais mais cette phrase m’a touché
> aujourd’hui plus que d’autres fois.

Analysis 15: monologic - dialogic discourse
In line 1, Anne communicates in a monological way. Her statement is clear and allows no
room for dialogue. The tutor wonders in line 2, and Anne continues her reasoning as she
finds another incident. She is convinced that it is not correct French stating: “nous
enseignons les enfants”. She is concerned with the way of saying things, as in line 5 and
30\. In line 7, Anne tends to go toward a dialogic discourse, when she states how the
sentence should be written, adding: ‘apparently’. In line 12, she opens two possibilities.
Although she is not sure how to interpret her difficulty, she doesn’t ask the other
participants for their advice.
The tutor communicates in a dialogical manner. This is visible in line 6, when she makes
sure she understands what is being stated, in line 11 when she confirms that she
understands. In line 13, she makes use of the tool of other languages as a way to resolve
this issue. In line 46, she concludes this intervention by Anne by relating her own
experience as she is able to teach every day.

5\.3.6 Relationships between elements of the activity system

Relationship between subjects, tools and division of labour
When participants are able to use certain tools, in the pursuit of the object of the activity,
for example being able to play the guitar, this can influence the division of labour. The
participant who plays the guitar may bring it to the activity, in order to practice and sing
songs with the rest of the group. The figure below highlights this relationship between the
subjects, the tools they use and the division of labour.

Figure 4: Relationships between subjects, tools and division of labour
The example below illustrates the negotiation between participants as to their musical
skills and the availability of instruments in order to prepare the musical part for the
following session. Anne has just read the passage that encourages participants to sing
spiritual songs with the children which fill their hearts with happiness. The text on page
27 includes a quotation by 'Abdu'l-Bahá:
The art of music is divine and effective. It is the food of the soul and spirit. Through the power
and charm of music the spirit of man is uplifted. It has wonderful sway and effect in the hearts of
children, for their hearts are pure, and melodies have great influence in them. The latent talents
with which the hearts of these children are endowed will find expression through the medium of
music (Abdu’l-Bahá, 1982, p. 52).
The curriculum goes on to suggest that participants learn the songs of the 15 lessons of
this unit well, either from the tutor or with the help of a cassette.

139    Tut:    Alors la prochaine fois c’est leçon musique, ok
140    Ann:    [On peut compter sur toi Romain ((giggles))
Analysis 16: Relationship between subjects, tools and division of labour
The tutor (L037) shares with the group her experience how singing and the sound of the
guitar helps the children to concentrate, to calm down and to listen. In lines 069-76,
Hamed, Romain and the tutor negotiate who should play the guitar for the next session.
Romain clarifies the difference between having a guitar and not having played it for three
years (L76). Between lines 77 and 131, the tutor leads a discussion where she is asking
the participants about whether they play any instruments (see Appendix: Session 4,

Excerpt 13). In lines 132-140, the tutor concludes the topic by leading to the next session,
which could be a musical lesson. Anne is suggesting that Romain will play the piano
(L140). Please note that we are at the home of Anne and Romain and that the sessions
have all taken place at their home. Here, the home also serves as a mediating tool, as
musical instruments are stored and available, that otherwise might be difficult to
transport. In this excerpt the tutor is clearly negotiating the relationship between the
subjects, the tools and the division of labour, as she is asking who plays what instruments.
She stresses the concentrating effect that singing and playing the guitar has on children
(L037).

Relationship between subjects, community and rules, norms and values
Participants bring with them their own historicity and multivoicedness that includes
certain rules, norms and values pertaining to the community in which they live, lived in
and were part of. This relationship can be seen in the figure below.

Figure 5: Relationships between subjects, community and rules
Participants have just heard the quote read by Hamed, [Regard man as a mine rich in gems of
inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to
benefit therefrom.] and the curriculum suggests that they think about some questions and to
consult about these ideas in the group.

001    Tut:    Qu’est-ce-que c’est les pierres précieuses?
002    Jos:    C’est les valeurs, toujours, (3.0) c’est de mettre en pratique

Analysis 17: Relationship between subjects, community, norms and values
As the tutor starts the discussion by asking the participants what they consider to be those
precious gems (L1), Josefa responds by emphasizing that it is the values that need to be
practised daily and giving priority to the value of education (L2). Romain continues by
enumerating some values and how they represent the bare minimum in order to have at
least some social cohesion (L3). He then makes a relationship between the increase of
complexity in knowledge and education and the importance of developing humanity’s
knowledge, this hidden treasure in us and in our children. Here it seems that Romain is
identifying humanity’s collective knowledge as part of the hidden treasure, a wording
borrowed from the quote read just before the discussion by Hamed. Josefa then attempts
to clarify what Romain stated by asking whether the more one evolves, the more one
finds that (L4). Then the tutor attempts to answer Josefa’s question to Romain by stating
that the more we evolve the more it is important to develop humanity’s collective
knowledge and the hidden treasure within us (L5). Romain confirms this with a yes. He
then gives the example of the portable phone and adding another relationship by stating
that 50 years ago we were connected differently and that the more real physical
connections we have, the more new connections we have (L6). Hamed suggests the word
interactions (L7). Romain adopts the word from Hamed and continues his relationship by
stating that more important it is to have values for everyone and the most amount of
values possible (L8). Josefa follows on without waiting by also giving now an example,
in order “to really live this situation of true values”. When she goes back
to her family in Brazil, who lives on the fields, and when she goes to the neighbour, and
visits them, they have no formal education, there are people who have so many values,
and “how beautiful” this is, and that there is a different way of passing this message.
And sometimes Josefa would go back in order “to have some strength for a world
that can stay so empty” (L9). Romain confirms twice with a yes that he understood
(L10) and Josefa continues by making a relationship with the past and how the world
today moves too quickly and that they live those values very poorly (L11).
In the chosen example, it is evident how Josefa relates her values to a community she
knows well and respects for the values they seem to show without any formal education
and her unease with the world she is experiencing currently, a world that is moving too

fast for her and with too little values. Romain brings to the discussion his view of the
world that is becoming more and more interconnected through communication
technology, a world that is developing knowledge, requiring a minimum of common
values, so that a minimum of social cohesion can be possible.
This instance shows how subjects from different communities have different rules and
have difficulties to communicate their perspective of a given issue. Added awareness by
the participants how each of them brings historicity and multivoicedness into the
discussions brings added understanding. Questions may be asked to Josefa in order to get
a better understanding as to what these values are that she appreciates so much and as to
who brought and taught those values to the indigenous people in Brazil.
5\.4 Learning Processes in the activity system
In the first part, I describe a Bahá’í perspective on learning that looks at six distinct
topics: the goal of learning; learning itself; the role of the student and of the teacher; the
concept of knowledge, and knowing. Part two starts by analysing what participants say as
they look back on their development after five sessions. Part three examines how the
participants adopt a research view as they take an interest in the research. Part four
addresses the four central questions on learning: who is learning, why do people learn,
what do they learn, and how do they learn? Part five looks at the possibilities for
expansive learning.
5\.4.1 Learning: a Bahá’í perspective
It is helpful to view learning as being partly a process of acquisition and partly a process
of participation. A Bahá’í concept of learning is found in the content of the curriculum
and other sources (Lample, 2009), suggesting that learning is partly acquired (for
example: memorization, suggested in Ruhi book 3, page 3) and partly a process of
participation in an activity (for example: sharing understanding in a study circle, as
described in Ruhi book 3, page 1). Based on Sfard’s (1998) table, I have added a column
that suggests a Bahá’í concept of learning that includes both acquisition and participation
metaphors.

and spiritual insights, so that they can be used for the betterment of the society at large.
Individual enrichment is combined with community building and both are interdependent.

Analysis 19: Learning
Skills are actively acquired and developed, and learners become participants through
collective learning in the form of study circles. In document 13, learning is described as a
process of action, reflection, consultation and study. Document 14 suggests that in order
to learn and to acquire knowledge, it is necessary to search independently for the truth.
Reitz-Koncebovski proposes that the independent search for truth should also be made the
first principle of learning and teaching in school (2006, p. 195). Learning encompasses
the acquisition of skills and the participation in an activity.
3 Topic: Role of the student
Instance 20a: Data: Document 6

> [...] Perhaps the learned Bahá’í is more like the “scout” who helps to guide an expedition

> and learns over time [...] (Lample, 2009, p. 152).
Instance 20b: Data: Document 1

Instance 20c: Data: Document 7

> The Ruhi Institute uses the term “collaborators” to refer to all who study, teach or apply

> the importance of helping children develop habits and patterns of behavior that are in
> keeping with a Baha'i way of life [...] (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 1–2).

Analysis 20: Role of the student
The student in document 6 explores new territory and generates and applies knowledge
that contributes to the success of the objective. The student in document 1 actively
participates in the activity. The student is defined in document 7 as a collaborator who
studies, teaches, applies the courses, and is responsible for his or her learning. Document
8 shows how the student is considered a noble person, as a mine rich in gems of
inestimable value. The student listens and is attentive to new information, constructs the
information into knowledge according to his understanding and his filters of culture,
language, values, beliefs, attitudes, expectations, and intentions. This activity may take
place in an activity with others.

4 Topic: Role of the teacher
Instance 21: Data: Document 7 (see above) Document 8 (see above)
Analysis 21: Role of the teacher
The teacher in document 7 is seen as someone who collaborates, together with the learner
in a common project. The teacher is the expert, facilitates the active work of learning, but
the process of learning is also reciprocal, “one in which everyone learns” (document 7).
The teacher in document 8 is seen as someone that knows about human talents and
capacities to be able to discover these gems in their students and actively helps to polish
them. He provides help and assists, facilitates the activity and mediates between
collaborators.
5 Topic: Concept of knowledge
Instance 22: Data: Document 9

> A Problem of Knowledge
> [...] there is a process of understanding and action in which the Bahá’í community
> explores reality, grows in comprehension and knowledge, unifies thought, and contributes
> to transforming the world in accordance with the truths expressed in Bahá’u’lláh’s
> Revelation (Lample, 2009, p. 161). [...] the acquisition of knowledge through science and
> religion is the motive force driving progress; and that acquisition of knowledge must be
> associated with action and reflection on action [...] (Lample, 2009, p. 189).

Analysis 22: Concept of knowledge
Document 9 states that science and religion are the two sources of knowledge and that if
we are to acquire knowledge, it should be done through action and reflection on action. A
Bahá’í perspective on the concept of knowledge proposes an ontologically objective
reality that is beyond the reach of scientific investigation. The scientific source of
knowledge allows for the exploration of the universe, physical and human reality, facts,
patterns and the laws of creation that can be known by the human mind. The religious
source of knowledge allows for a revelation that can be known, the revealed Word of
God, the Book and its authoritative interpretation. Further details on this perspective can
be found in the Appendix C: Perspective on Reality (Lample, 2009, p. 121).
6 Topic: Knowing
Instance 23: Data: Document 10

> The Bahá’í Writings place definite limits on understanding. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that
> human beings cannot know the essence of a thing, but only its qualities. He also states
> that all ways of human knowing—reason, tradition, the senses, and inspiration—are
> fallible, and therefore must be checked against one another. Science, then, is extolled for
> its powers of empirical investigation and reason, but its limitations are also
> acknowledged. Religion takes its place along with science as a means for investigating

> reality, educating humanity, and contributing to the advancement of civilization (Lample,
> 2009, p. 175).

Analysis 23: Knowing
Document 10 states that human beings are limited in knowing the essence of things; that
our ways of knowing are fallible and must be checked against one another; that the
limitations of science must be acknowledged and that along with science, religion must be
used for investigating reality. While we acquire knowledge, we belong to a social reality
that is created, changes and evolves constantly through participating in meaningful
activities.
5\.4.2 Participants look back on their development
This study has been carried out over a period of several months, from December 2010
until July 2011. While six sessions had taken place, two more sessions remained to be
done at the end of July. Earlier in the analysis, I looked at the actual outcome suggested
by the participant after six sessions, asking them what was the one thing they had learned,
and what they would do now. The following analysis looks at the interview carried out
after five sessions, where I asked them about their development. As this was a group
interview, participants listened to what the others in the group were saying about their
own development and this had an impact on the statements made by the subsequent
participants. As I was present for the interview, I guided the discussion by asking them
about their development.

Analysis 24: Learning and development
Hamed starts by saying that he has developed or changed (L1), the development he has
seen (L2), and the development that is taking place (L5). This development is strongly
connected to the context of having two children (L3). Hamed knew the concepts but up to
now they remained theoretical (L3). He had heard over a thousand times the concept that
man should be regarded as a mine rich in gems, but that this were but words. By
visualising his own child in this context, he became aware, it gave him joy, the words
became beautiful and his heart was beating a bit faster (L11).
In these few lines, Hamed illustrates his experience of how a new element in his life, his
child, creates a new context that gives meaning to learning and promotes development.
Words have become beautiful and concepts have taken on new meaning.
Josefa mentions with the voice of ‘we’ how the good is transforming the bad or evil and
that this is very difficult (L6). Work is needed to pass on to our children, being like a
channel, and this work is part of development. It includes constant listening, support
people, our children, and first of all ourselves (L7). The work of educating ourselves
takes a long time and is not easy (L8). Josefa sees in the history of Bahá’u’lláh a model

that she wants to apply in her daily life, and this is not easy. Again, she takes the voice of
‘we’ to highlight this point (L10).
Josefa emphasizes the need for transformation, the need to become a channel in order to
pass a message to others and the fact that this process requires hard work.
It is now Anne’s turn and she links her development to a better knowledge within the
group, to the creation of certain habits, the sharing of different ideas about education and
what one should be doing and the time it takes to integrate these ideas. She states that her
development is developing and when this is linked to the education of one’s child, one is
only a parent, trying one’s best and taking inspiration from good methods from many
sources, and that anyhow, it is always beneficial to learn (L12).
For Anne, development is expressed in the group cohesion, facing the similar situation of
educating one’s child with others in the group. She states that her development is
developing, through participating in the activity of the study circle and she trusts the
value of learning.
Romain follows Anne’s contribution by confirming his joy to be with the group and his
confidence in everything related to the children’s classes as their son Serge attends them.
His vision of how the class is organised has changed, he knows much better, he knows, he
has a better comprehension of what is taking place not only where he lives, but almost
everywhere else in the world. This is for him amazing, that today one is engaged in a
learning process and that this learning comes from a pure positive source, spread out the
world over and that it is a unique historical phenomenon, and this clearly is a
development (L13).
When I asked Romain to speak also about his own development, he confirms that he has
developed, by making reference to Hamed and the values he has received since his early
age. Romain sees himself as being part of a learning process that cannot but affect the
person engaged in such a process. It gives him courage to take a certain direction and
linking personal development to planetary development (L14).
While Romain mentions that his son takes part in children’s classes, and that now he
knows more about this aspect, he focuses mainly on being part of a global enterprise, and
he relates increased understanding of the context and the “map” to an increased
understanding of ”directing oneself in a certain direction”.

The tutor, being at the beginning of her activity as a tutor, compares herself with another
tutor, where she participated in a number of study circles, stating how she finds it difficult
to know how to let participants speak, to make the group move forward when needed, and
to know when to wait. She sees her development as learning to be a tutor, to be patient,
how to manage the group and recognizing that each group is different (L16). She is more
concerned with the manner of tutoring as to the content. At present, she completes a study
circle with two different tutors that have two different approaches, she pays attention how
they advance the group, when they intervene and she wants to learn by taking them as
models so that she can find her role as a tutor, and a learner (L18, 20). She compares
herself also with the other participants, some of them being a Bahá’í much longer then
herself, and being probably more knowledgeable about the history then her (L22). This
unease seems to come from within herself, due to her own fear (L24).
The tutor expresses her development in a learning mode, comparing herself to other more
experienced tutors, being aware of her own shortcomings, and being concerned about the
form the study circle is taking, and the way she can learn alongside with the participants.
5\.4.3 Participants’ interest in this research: adopting a research view
During the course of the sessions, I have taken the time to describe to the group some of
the approaches used for this study. At this stage it is not clear, whether this description
has helped participants in their study. Sharing my observations throughout the study and
during the interview after session 5, participants wanted to know more about my research
and were very happy that I decided to carry out this research project. I received the
following note with the initial answers to the questionnaire at the start of session 1. At
that time, I had already shared some initial thoughts about my research with the
participants.
Instance 25a: Excerpt 5 (N0)
01   Rom:       Salut Jean-Marie
02   Rom:       Ech gratuléieren dech. Dat mess du wierklech gutt. Ganz flott

Proaktivitéit, a gutt Organisatioun
Below is an instance where two participants express their interest in the research I
conduct with the study circle.
Instance 25b: Excerpt 17 (INTS5E0)
01   Res:       Si vous voulez, on peut faire un petit tour, chacun s’exprime un

petit peu. Moi, je peux aussi dire quelques minutes, où est-ce-que

j’en suis avec la recherche
02           (2.0)
03   Res:    Ça va?
04   ?       Toi d’abord ((giggles))
05   Tut:    Oui ça nous intéresse
06   Ann:    Mais oui
Analysis 25: Participants adopting a research view
In excerpt 5, Romain congratulates the researcher, supposedly for his research initiative
and approach. In excerpt 17, the tutor and Anne verbally show that they are interested to
know more about my research with their study circle. The tutor speaks here with the voice
of the other participants: “it interests us”. This indicates that participants approve of the
use of scientific methods. An opportunity for learning has thus been created. Additional
interviews may provide more tangent answers, as to whether activity theory as a method
has afforded participants with a tool for learning and action.
5\.4.4 Analysis of the study circle: four central questions on learning
Any theory of learning needs to address four central questions: Who are learning, how are
they defined and located? Why do they learn, what makes them make the effort? What do
they learn, what are the contents and outcomes of learning? How do they learn, what are
the key actions or processes of learning? I have already answered some of the questions
in the description of the study circle as an activity system, and refer the reader to that
section.

Who are learning, how are they defined and located? (Subjects and Community)
The participants are engaged in a process of collective learning in a shared domain of
human endeavour and they form a community of practice. Participants also belong to
other activity systems. This constellation of activity systems is different for each
participant in the activity analysed. Activity systems that are connected to the activity of
the collaborative study circle include the immediate family, their circles of friends and
neighbours, their workplace, their religious community and the school their children go
to. Analysing these interconnections would go beyond the scope of this study, which
focuses on the collaborative study circle as an activity system.

Why do they learn – what makes them make the effort? (Object)
The participants that are members of the Bahá’í community (apart from Anne) are
encouraged to participate in collaborative study circles. It is useful to them, as they each

have children that need to be educated. They are ‘confronted’ with this new situation that
is not going away and it is this change in their environment that is a part in the motivation
for taking part in the study circle. The fact that this activity is taking place in almost every
part of the globe is a motivation factor for Romain.
Excerpt 2 : WQ01 : C5
Rôle de quelqu’un de responsable et de soucieux du sort de l’humanité.
Important de participer à une étude (Ruhi 3) si largement répandue sur
toute la planète.
Each participant brings in historicity and multivoicedness.

What are they learning, what are the contents and outcomes of learning?

Participants learn principles and concepts, skills, techniques and abilities, they learn to
manage situations and they learn to create environments. They familiarize themselves
with a number of concepts of Bahá’í education, and acquire skills in order to hold
children’s classes. Document 19 provides a more detailed description of the content and
expected outcome of learning.
An aspect of learning that is not directly addressed in the curriculum is how to invite their
neighbours and friends to participate in a learning activity that demands a number of
skills, and needs to be systematic. It is a tool and part of a norm in the activity system.

How do they learn – what are the key actions?

I have observed over the five sessions that the five participants do a number of actions
together. They study and go over the course material of the Ruhi book 3: teaching
children’s classes. They read the material, discuss the various concepts presented to them
and consult about the exercises. They are confronted with classroom situations and the
course book gives them a number of alternatives to choose from or come up with another
solution to the situation. Participants share their teaching experiences and mostly the tutor
does this, as she has had a lot of experience in child education and as she is a trained
educator. The participants negotiate the course content as they accept the suggestions in
full or partly, or choose other resources that seem more suitable to achieve their object:
teaching their children and in the process also teaching children’s classes. They do not
follow all the rules given to them by the tutor or the curriculum. They do not fill in the
missing texts, they do not explain games to the other participants, they do not find all the
stories suitable for the children, they use other ways then colouring in order to understand

and memorize a quotation, and they do not memorize the passages suggested in the
curriculum. Participants carry out some of the actions suggested and they bring into the
group their talents, abilities and skills. Some of them play the guitar, some play the piano,
some sing, and some play songs; thereby preparing to sing songs with their children and
other children.
As they study, act and reflect on their actions and the experiences, they get to know each
other as a group with a shared object, they feel more comfortable with each other, and the
atmosphere is one where laughter is frequent.
5\.4.5 Possibilities for expansive learning
Conflictual questioning of existing standard practice is crucial triggering action in the
expansive learning process (Engeström, 1987).While there is certainly room for
expansive learning, I cannot confirm that expansive learning is happening in this study
circle. I have observed participants challenging existing practices of standard practice.
They clearly begin to question and deviate from established norms. This may turn into
collaborative envisioning and a deliberate collective change effort. These practices relate
to the tools used in order to achieve an object. Participants, as mentioned above, have
used additional and alternative tools, in order to carry out the desired action, or not carry
it out. The example below is a passage where participants discuss the exercise of filling
in missing text.

Analysis 26: Possibilities for expansive learning
Anne (L1) voices her unease with the exercise of filling in missing text. Josefa (L2)
confirms this by bringing in the voices of several of her friends, who told the same
“story”. Anne (L3) remembers how already during the Ruhi book 1 it had bothered her a
lot. The tutor (L4) acknowledges what Anne is saying, and Josefa (L5) envisions a change
that would be more “adult”. Romain, in line 10 confirms, like Anne, that 10 years ago,
this had bothered him so much, that he had stopped doing the study circles, and that it
took him 10 years to “come back”. More voices are added to the topic and Hamed (L14)
brings in a bit of humour by saying that at some stage, it was “non stop, broken record”.
Romain (L15), while agreeing with the group about deviating from the established norm
of memorising texts and filling in the gap in texts, highlighted the fact, that none of the
participants would remember much from the texts studied. This is confirmed by the tutor
(L16, 18).
Josefa suggested a change in practice without suggesting how it could be done practically
and Romain expressed his concern that the object of the exercise had simply not been
achieved.
This event provides the tutor with an opportunity to encourage among the participants a
discussion on finding other, more creative ways of achieving the object of the exercise,
simply by returning to what Josefa and Romain had said in lines 5 and 15.

5\.5 Outlook
5\.5.1 Matrix for possible expansive learning
An expansive transformation is accomplished when the object and motive of the activity
are reconceptualised to embrace a radically wider horizon of possibilities than in the
previous mode of the activity. The activity system analysed here does not show that the
object and motive have changed. Participants have decided not to use certain tools to
accomplish a task, to achieve the object. A contradiction between the rules and the object
exists. They have not embraced a wider horizon of possibilities, such as coming up with
different tools, in order to achieve their object. At this point, the question remains
whether the tutor, other participants in this activity or other activity systems that they are
surrounded in, will provide stimulation that will contribute to achieve their object.
When the five principles of CHAT, described earlier, are cross-tabulated with the four
central questions of any theory of learning, the matrix below helps visualising
possibilities for expansive learning.

5\.5.2 Questioning existing standard practice in a wider context
In a much larger context however, it is noteworthy that at the heart of the Bahá’í Faith, as
Bahá'u'lláh, its founder stated: “the object of every Revelation” is to “effect a
transformation in the whole character of mankind, a transformation that shall affect both
its inner life and external conditions” (see document 4). This quest for transformation has
found expression in the curriculum of Ruhi book 3. Existing standard practice is
portrayed in the introduction: “Bahá’í children’s classes are not like the classes of
indoctrination which are common in many other religions. [...] the emphasis is on
learning to think, reflect and to apply spiritual laws to the life of the individual and
society. [...] The desire to avoid indoctrination or catechism should not, however, lead to
laxity in religious instruction” (Ruhi Institute, 2007, p. 1). This is further explained with
the conclusion that “humanity, left to its own devices without divine guidance, has
produced nothing more than chaos, injustice and suffering” (Ruhi Institute, 2007, p. 1).
The curriculum is currently being used worldwide in over 184 national communities and
it is clarified that “the dynamics of educating children vary greatly from community to
community in the Bahá’í world” (Ruhi Institute, 2007, p. 1). Further research should
focus on the variations in the dynamics of educating children in different cultural and
historical settings.
5\.6 Summary of Findings related to the research questions
5\.6.1 Research question 1
How does learning take place in the study circle?
I have used in this study the cultural-historical activity theory perspective and the
discourse analysis approach in order to provide elements that show how learning takes
place in this collaborative study circle. The different elements that describe this study
circle as an activity system (chapter 5.1.2) offer a first insight into the complexity of what
happens, when five participants engage in a collaborative learning activity. In chapter
5\.4.4, I describe the four central questions on learning, including how people have
learned, and what their key actions were.
Several instances from the selected excerpts below offer insights that this particular type
of collaborative activity encourages and promotes the exchange of questions, ideas,
experiences, thoughts and knowledge among participants.

When an idea bounces – how one comment resonates with other participants
During an interview after session five, Anne raised her unease that the curriculum
suggested to fill in missing text, in order to help memorizing certain passages. Josefa
picked up on this point, remembering how several of her friends told her about the same
unease when doing the curriculum with her. Romain shared his unease and the fact that it
took him 10 years before restarting this curriculum. Then the tutor picks up by stating
that at some stage the repetition of the same sentence was really too much. Hamed
continues by bringing in some humour to this discussion, and comparing this repetition to
a “broken record” (Chapter 5.3.4).
During this instance and throughout the recordings observed during five sessions, the
general atmosphere was calm and serene. Over time, the group came closer to each other,
as laughter became more frequent, humour was present, and participants mentioned
during interviews that they got to know each other better. Such conditions promote
learning opportunities.
When cultural differences meet in a collaborative activity through value negotiation
During session one (Instance 17) Josefa relates her values to a community she knows
well, and respects for the values they seem to show without any formal education, and her
unease with the world she is experiencing currently, a world that is moving too fast for
her and with not enough values. Romain brings to the discussion his view of the world,
one that is becoming more interconnected through communication technology, a world
that is developing knowledge, requiring a minimum of common values, so that a
minimum of social cohesion can be possible.
This instance shows that the negotiation of cultural differences in a collaborative activity
offers different perspectives on values and thus provides learning opportunities.
Participants need to question their assumptions, gain from the sharing of ideas by others
and are able to rethink their position. As participants look back on their development and
share their thoughts in the group, new insights can be gained (Chapter 5.4.2).
When a known concept connects to a new context of having to raise children
Hamed had heard over a thousand times the concept that man should be regarded as a
mine rich in gems, but that this were but words. By visualising his own child in this
context, he became aware, it gave him joy, the words became beautiful and his heart was

beating a bit faster (L11). Thus, the concept, together with the context gave meaning to
the words and provided a learning experience.
Anne states that through the study circle, she came to know the participants, and as a
young parent, was able to share different ideas about education, and that it takes time to
integrate these ideas. She says that her development is developing, and as a parent, she
takes inspiration from good methods, and that it is always beneficial to learn (L12). This
instance offers another indication that the collaborative activity promotes learning under
certain conditions: being able to share ideas; the confidence that learning is beneficial.
When the object of learning is seen as a positive source, spread out worldwide for the first time,
in a joyous attitude
In this instance, Romain is very happy to be able to participate in the study circle, and
also as his son attends a children’s class, with a teacher that has completed the same
curriculum. Romain is aware of this unique historical phenomenon, and this has given
him added motivation and direction. His identity is strengthened, knowing that he
collaborates in a global learning process. Thus, his personal development is linked to
individual and social transformation (L14).
When learning develops through comparison and identity development
This instance shows the tutor, who compares her role as a tutor with other tutors where
she participates and completes further courses that lead towards tutor training. She also
compares herself to other participants, who have been Bahá’ís much longer and who may
know more about some aspects of the Faith. A part of her identity is that of a learner.
When an interest is shown in what participants do and how they do it
As I informed the study circle of my intention to carry out my research on the exploration
of learning processes, three participants showed their interest (Chapter 5.4.3).
Subsequently, through meeting the group, each participant seemed happy and encouraged
about my interest in their activity. I never got the impression, that my interest and my
questions were not welcome.
Value-oriented activity
In this instance, participants attend the study circle motivated by a genuine interest (use
value-oriented), and not for the sake of getting a grade (exchange value-oriented). As

seen in chapter 5.2.5, some participants may want to show obedience towards Bahá’í
institutions, in which they trust, and these institutions form an integral part of the Bahá’í
Faith. This last analysis stems from my observations as a member of the Bahá’í
community.
Mediation: When participants are confronted with learning tools
People interpose purposefully tools between them and their environment, in order to
modify it and obtain certain benefits. In the process of using and applying the tools within
socially organized activities such as this collaborative study circle, opportunities for
learning are created. The use of language is a cultural form of mediation. In the following
instance, an opportunity to learn through action has been missed. In chapter 5.3.1, the
curriculum suggested that participants explain a game to the group, so that they could
practice in order to be able to explain games to children.
When the tutor shares their experiences and skills
In chapter 5.3.2, the tutor finds that not all stories meant for children, that are included in
the curriculum are suitable for the very young. She relates this from experience, and
reassures the participants that many suitable stories are now readily available online.
In chapter 5.3.5 the tutor brings into the group the meaning of the German translation for
the word “fear”, thereby expanding the meaning of this concept for other participants,
which was acknowledged by Romain and Pia. Code-switching is seen here as a tool,
allowing for comparison, and further understanding the concept of the fear of God. The
tutor is familiar with the German vocabulary, due to her practice and work with children.
5\.6.2 Research question 2
What tools are used by the participants and how do they shape their learning?
From the sociocultural perspective, learning is seen as a process of appropriating tools for
thinking (Rogoff, 1990). These tools and instruments are one element in the cultural
historical activity system. They constitute the means that are used in performing the
activity. Figure 3 shows the study circle as an activity system and provides the first
answers as to what tools are used by the participants.
Participants used mainly French during the sessions, as well as the French curriculum.
Luxembourgish was used in discussions when the participants present shared this

language. German was used at least on one occasion in order to clarify understanding of
a French concept in the curriculum.
The curriculum was in the form of a published book of a 128 pages, consisting of an
introduction, addressed to the collaborators, as well as three distinct units. Each unit
provided the participants with additional tools that would guide their learning. They
include:
   passages from the Bahá’í Writings (authoritative texts) to be memorized;
   passages with questions where the answers could be found in the passages to be

memorized;
   open-ended questions that would encourage reflection and discussions among

participants;
   statements made that are either true or false;
   passages with missing text to be filled in;
   suggested stories to be told to children; colouring material and games to be explained

to children;
These activities were carried out in the group, composed of five participants, and each
one was encouraged by the tutor to collaborate. My analysis has shown how these tools,
suggested by the curriculum, were negotiated at times, and used less then suggested in
the curriculum.
The tutor encouraged each participant to complete the necessary exercises in the course
book, by writing and filling in the required exercises. Each participant had a copy. The
couple, Anne and Romain, shared one book. As a result, they were not able to carry out
individually the task of answering questions in the book, and other writing exercises.
They shared a tool.
Participants asked the tutor questions regarding the education of children and the tutor is
considered a mediating agent, someone that has already studied the curriculum, someone
with some experience with giving children’s classes and someone that has completed a
tutor-training course. In this instance, the tutor had not yet completed this course. She
mentioned this in a written questionnaire, stating that it was an element that she felt she
needed to complete now.
The participants’ cultural-historical background gives them tools which they bring into
the activity. They include:

   knowledge of a prominent pedagogue in the Bahá’í Faith (Mr Furutan);
   musical skills that include singing, playing the guitar and the piano;
   awareness of online resources that help carrying out children’s classes;
   professional experience in teaching children;
   additional languages that give a different perspective to a number of concepts;
   the use of humour during the sessions;
I assume that these instruments, tools and mediating agents have guided and influenced
significantly the learning process. My analysis shows that participants were motivated to
learn more about child education, and all are young parents. All have a common task in
providing guidance and education to their children. All share a common vision, and by
being constantly guided by this vision, this objective of teaching their children, the
collaborators made use of the tools at their disposal, in a way that would bring them
closer to their objective: knowing more about child education. My analysis shows that the
participants struggled at times with the tools offered in the curriculum. They did not
however turn to new tools that would guide and favour their learning.
5\.6.3 Research question 3
How does the participants’ multivoicedness influence the learning process?
The five collaborators engage in an activity system that is called a study circle, have
multiple points of view, traditions and interests. This multivoicedness has a direct effect
on the learning process as it creates different positions for the participants in the activity
of developing skills that allow them to teach children’s classes.
Looking through the 21 selected excerpts that include interviews (5), written
questionnaires (3), group sessions (10) and notes (3), I identified and analysed the
different voices that the participants brought into the activity. I assume that they represent
a fraction of the multivoicedness inherent in the voicing of thoughts and ideas, namely
those that were written or pronounced during the activity.
I identified the voices, brought together in table 6: Summary of voices used by
participants, indicating how many participants ‘used’ a specific voice. In the light of my
knowledge and understanding about this particular group, I suggest the following
interpretation, in an attempt to regroup the different voices, brought together in the table
below. On the left side are the voices observed in the 21 excerpts, and on the right side
my interpretation and summary of seven types of voices.

I assume that the activity that the participants were engaged in, triggered a number of
voices to become manifest, and to become active. The participation in this specific
learning activity gave rise to voices to be heard. At the same time, the multivoicedness of
the participants and their interaction in the activity shaped and influenced the learning
process.
The following incident shows how multivoicedness affects the learning process. Several
excerpts show how Hamed is referring to a well-known Bahá’í pedagogue and scholar
who used to say that “repetition is the mother of knowledge”. The tutor repeats this as the

participants negotiate a number of instances in the curriculum when they are confronted
with memorizing a passage from the Bahá’í Writings or fill in missing text, so as to
remember better certain passages. The analyses show how most participants struggle with
the tools given in order to memorize the suggested passages. On one occasion, Romain
voices his unhappiness with having to fill in missing text, and shares with the group that
due to these kinds of exercises, it took him 10 years to come back, because he didn’t like
it at all. Hamed jokes about it and Romain shows clearly that he has not been able to
come up with an alternative tool to help the group memorize important passages. He says
that the problem is that if someone was to ask the group about even one sentence that they
wrote down, (he doesn’t finish the sentence), this would be difficult (the tutor completed
the sentence) (chapter 5.3.4, instance 12, L10, 15, 16). I have not observed the tutor
intervening and trying to encourage the group to find other ways to memorize pertinent
passages.
In the written questionnaire after session six, the tutor describes the importance of
repetition in order to acquire certain habits and qualities. She brings in a number of voices
in order to further make the point that repetition is important.
The tutor brings in the voice of Hamed, a participant, and Mr Furutan, the person that
Hamed quoted. This adds weight to what Hamed said as it comes from a respected and
well-known Bahá’í scholar. This is repeated in the last questionnaire. As the tutor reflects
on what she as a tutor has learned, she focuses on the concept of memorization, and how
repetition is the mother of knowledge, she combines a number of voices: the voice of
Hamed, who quoted this short passage on repetition from Mr Furutan; the voice of her
son who talked about the importance of repetition in the context of mastering Judo, and
how while he was in Japan for three weeks, the Japanese Judo master spent three hours
practicing one movement, and the voice of Ken Robinson, a writer who talks about how
10\.000 hours of training can bring pure joy and happiness, when one has found ‘one’s
element’. By combining the elements of repetition, knowledge and happiness, the tutor
voiced in a few sentences her own voice (1), and the voices of Hamed (2), Mr Furutan
(3), her son (4), the Japanese Judo master (5) and Ken Robinson (6). This description
serves as an example of the depth and richness that historicity and multivoicedness is able
to offer when analysing learning processes. It allows visualising and connecting the
different voices used by the participants (chapter 5.2.1.).

This instance shows how multivoicedness guided the tutor’s learning process, as it
reinforced the concept that memorization is a valuable tool. Multivoicedness is linked to
historicity, as this instance shows poignantly.

6 CHAPTER SIX: DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
6\.1 Limitations
If I had to do the study again, I would do a number of things differently. A major
challenge has been the selection of data out of over 10 hours of video-recording, and this
is due to the difficulty in determining appropriate research questions. The experience
gained at this stage has helped me to further understand the concepts of observation,
analysis, interpretation, and assumption. I was able to do this through my actions;
carrying out the above tasks, and being able to study, act, and reflect upon learning
processes in the safe environment of the university, with ample opportunities to exchange
ideas with fellow students and professors.
In an effort to develop further this research in regards to discourse analysis, I would apply
systematically a number of tools of inquiry such as those used by Gee (2005, p. 20), so as
to gain more research depth.
For further development of this research as far as the use of cultural-historical activity
theory is concerned, I would complete the study by taking a more distant stance towards
the processes in the study circle and overview the analysis on a meta-level.
In an effort to further develop this study, I would analyse the video-recorded sessions and
take a critical approach, stating that multicultural and multilingual contexts offer
challenges, and may initially slow down expected learning outcome; participants struggle
to get across intended meaning; participants are unfamiliar with the use of French;
participants may be ignorant about the importance of knowing the historicity and
multivoicedness of others.
This study explored learning processes within a study group. I would briefly describe
methods from other disciplines, such as developmental and cognitive psychology, and
neurobiological processes, and how they shed light on the unit of analysis: participants
that learn in a collaborative study.
As an insider, a member of the Bahá’í community, I do research within a group of people,
and four out of five are members of the Bahá’í community. Throughout the study, I need
to be attentive that my beliefs and convictions do not veil existing learning issues within

the group. Appropriate methods are called for in order to prevent this possibility;
safeguards are required.
6\.2 Discussion on analysis and insights
At this stage of this research, I suggest an interpretation of the insights gained; describe
what they mean and how they contribute to the research problem: increasing
understanding around learning processes and how learning takes place in the case of a
particular collaborative study circle.
This study circle allowed the collaborators to come together in a peaceful environment,
full of happiness and careful consideration towards others. The discussions were carried
out in a caring, dignified, respectful, and non-judgmental manner, allowing participants to
freely express themselves. My observations and experience as a member of the Bahá’í
community show that in Luxembourg and France, the term ‘participant’ is preferred to the
term ‘collaborator’. On one occasion, someone remarked that the term ‘collaborator’ was
associated with the French ‘collaborateur’ during the second world war. The equivalent
Luxembourgish term ‘Mataarbechter’ is appropriate. Code-switching improves in this
instance desired meaning.
Recommendations
The following suggestions serve all those involved in the implementation and
organisation of collaborative study circles. The tutor is a pivotal agent in this enterprise.
Considering the multicultural and multilingual context of many study circles,
organisers and tutors would do well to plan enough time to allow participants a full and
frank understanding of essential concepts around the issue of values. Tutors need to be
aware that the French curriculum translation needs a revision. In this way, precious time
can be given to allow for a deeper understanding of the essential concept of the nobility of
man.
The mediating tools offered in the curriculum did on occasions not suit the participants.
An initial discussion at the start of a study circle should emphasise that the common
vision takes priority over the choice of tools in order to reach the desired outcome. All are
responsible to gain adequate understanding of the basic concepts through creative means
at their disposal.

The elements of the activity system present a powerful visual indication and guide to a
process of learning that is complex and not easy to grasp. By providing participants with
relationships between elements, awareness is raised.
This study has shown that a collaborative learning activity is rich in instances of
multivoicedness. Participants have shared awareness about the historicity of study
circles. They take part in a global learning process that helps to strengthen identity and
purpose. Study circles are evolving and growing. As experiences from study circles
taking place in different cultures, are collected and analysed, new insights are gained and
shared.
As collaborators complete the curriculum on teaching children’s classes, and as they are
encouraged to be responsible for their own learning, action-based tasks such as starting
children’s classes, will offer those involved valuable experiences. As they progress
through ongoing learning that includes study, action, reflection on action, and
consultation, they become social actors and improve and transform their neighbourhoods.
They will advance step by step in achieving their desired outcome, as stated in the title of
this study: individual and social transformation.
6\.3 Future research directions
I was privileged to carry out research in the way people learn, progress and develop in the
setting of a collaborative study circle. I was able to analyse the first five sessions and a
short written questionnaire after session six. In this regard, collaborators had completed
Unit 1 of the curriculum: Some Principles of Bahá’í Education.
As a further contribution to the research challenge: increasing understanding around
learning processes in the case of collaborative study circles, I suggest a research project
that would follow the participants through the entire learning process:
   Collaborators complete the three units in the curriculum: teaching children’s classes,

> which are: unit 1: some principles of Bahá’í Education; unit 2: 15 Lessons for
> Children, where each lesson includes a prayer to be memorized, a song around the
> theme of values, exercises that help to understand the prayer, a short quotation related
> to a quality, a story that relates to a certain value, a cooperative game, and a colouring
> activity; unit 3: Conducting Classes for Children. The purpose of this unit is to learn
> some methods and understand some basic ideas on how to conduct a Bahá’í class.

> Apart from the required knowledge and enthusiasm to guarantee good results, success
> depends on the way the class is managed and a relationship with children and their
> parents, based on unconditional love and deep respect.
   Collaborators start to assist teaching a children’s class with someone more

> experienced. Once, they feel confident and have sufficient experience and skills, they
> start their own class.

Ideally, the tutor accompanies the collaborators during this process. The duration of such
a project could take 6 to 18 months. A number of research questions are addressed. What
tools do collaborators use in order to complete the process outlined below? What are the
indicators that favour collaborative learning? How do collaborators experience this
process? How does this process contribute towards social transformation?
Another research approach would take the form of action research, or interventionist
research. Analysis 12: Comprehension: inappropriate learning task, offers an instance
where participants are uncomfortable with the proposed tool of filling in missing text, in
order to increase their understanding of a relevant passage. At this stage, the researcher
questions the participants as to what alternative tools they can come up with in order to
become more familiar with essential text passages. With the experience of this study, a
similar research project would include active intervention by the researcher throughout
the project that the participants would be engaged in, while completing the curriculum
and gaining experience in teaching children’s classes.
A second area of research worthy of investigation is the Bahá’í concept of consultation,
a distinctive method of non-adversarial decision-making, a procedure for building
consensus and investigating truth, and a vital instrument for social criticism. The Bahá’í
concept of learning includes four aspects that are interlinked: study, action, reflection on
action and consultation (Lample, 2009). While the concept of consultation is well
described in Bahá’í literature, I have not found research that shows how participants in a
collaborative environment apply consultation.
The following research questions will contribute to answering issues related to social
cohesion. How does the Bahá’í concept of consultation seeks to build consensus in a
manner that unites various constituencies, instead of dividing them? How do the
principles of consultation encourage diversity of opinion and acts to control the struggle
for power that is otherwise so common in traditional decision-making systems? How do

the principles of consultation contribute towards problem-solving? The four principles of
Bahá’í consultation are described in Appendix B: Consultation.
A third area of research relates to the worldwide spread of collaborative study circles and
their effectiveness. In chapter 5.5.2, existing standard practices are questioned in a global
context. The ‘raison d’être’ of the Bahá’í community is to bring about individual and
social transformation, and the collaborative study circles with their sequence of courses
are the vehicle, the tool for this transformation. Since the curriculum of the course:
teaching children’s classes, states that “the dynamics of educating children vary greatly
from community to community in the Bahá’í world” (Ruhi Institute, 2007, p. 1), further
research may focus on the variations in the dynamics of educating children in different
cultural and historical settings, and: How can an educational system such as the children’s
class curriculum be implemented and work effectively across various cultures? A
study could analyse and compare the learning activities of collaborative study circles in
different cultures. Education and Multilingualism, one of the five focus areas of the
University of Luxembourg, seeks answers to the research question: Can an education
system that works well in one culture be implemented in another?

6\.4 Conclusion
I wish to draw some conclusions based on the insights gained from the study, and discuss
their implications, so as to bridge the “research to practice” gap.
The first conclusion is that participants have been reluctant to use a number of tools given
in the curriculum; that participants have become aware that they have not achieved the
desired outcome, but that they have not searched for other tools that would help them
achieve their goal. Participants had read and discussed several key concepts on children’s
education, had not been satisfied with the tools suggested, in order to fully understand and
memorize the concepts, but had not suggested alternative tools.
When those engaged in a collaborative learning process focus on their objective and
outcome, the choice of appropriate tools can be negotiated by the group themselves, as
they take on responsibility for their own learning. Tools are means to achieve goals.
The second conclusion is that participants have brought into the activity multiple voices.
These voices are attached to the historicity of the participants, and indicate groups of
voices: voices, where we see ourselves collectively, voices of those we care for and love,
voices of those that are keen to learn and are curious, voices of those that want to
contribute and share their skills, voices of those with qualities and values, voices of those
that endure physical hardship, those that are close to nature, and finally the voices of
those that are not satisfied by certain learning tools. All of these voices relate to the object
and outcome of the activity undertaken. The interrelationship between the individual and
the group activity exists. I assume that the learning activity acts upon multivoicedness and
that participants bring into the activity their multivoicedness. We choose to bring out
certain voices and not to bring out others. I assume that certain voices further learning
processes more than others, when they echo with their objects of learning.
The third conclusion is that learning takes place through a complex interaction between
all of the elements uncovered through the cultural-historical activity system. The study
circle observed is at the beginning of its historicity; study circles are developing with their
own historicity in different contexts and cultures, and they influence the learning activity.
As participants bring in their own historicity and multivoicedness, they influence the
learning activity, and in this way, there is interconnectedness and a reciprocal influence
between participants and the study circle. The study has shown that a number of actions

and conditions favour learning processes. In the study circle, and among participants, the
existence and deliberate creation of certain conditions, such as mutual trust, a welcoming
and encouraging attitude, a respect for the opinion of others, adopting a humble learning
attitude, and taking ownership for one’s learning, contribute towards a richer and
meaningful learning activity.
I assume that these elements constitute the foundation that allow for a rich individual and
social transformation; something I consider to be a burning issue today.

8 APPENDIXES
8\.1 Appendix: Definitions
I will define here a number of concepts and terms requiring a more detailed explanation
for the reader that is not familiar with some terms related to the Bahá’í Faith. Other terms
that are widely used needed to be defined in the context of this study in an attempt to
reduce ambiguity as to their meaning.
Bahá’í: A person becomes a Bahá’í by recognizing Bahá’u’lláh as the Messenger of God
for this age and accepting to follow His laws and teachings and the administrative
institutions He established for the unification of humankind. People enrol in a Bahá’í
community by signifying such belief and commitment, orally or in writing, to the
responsible Bahá'í institution.
Bahá’í Faith/Religion: Founded a century and a half ago, the Bahá’í Faith is today
among the fastest-growing of the world’s religions. With more than five million
followers, who reside in virtually every nation on earth, it is the second-most widespread
faith, surpassing every religion but Christianity in its geographic reach. Bahá’ís reside in
more than 100,000 localities around the world, an expansion that reflects their dedication
to the ideal of world citizenship (Bahá’í International Community, 2011c).
Culture: Man’s general control, refinement, and improvement of himself. Culture, seen
as a vast panoply of ideas, facts, relics, secrets, techniques, applications, formulas, and
documents; the sum of our ways of doing things, and the sum of “knowledge” as we
know it. Culture arises from the dialectic between the individual and the social world
(Wagner, 1981).
Collaborative Study for Individual and Social Transformation: At the heart of the
Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the force of transformation, both of the individual and of
society. The transformation of the individual is not an isolated process, not ascetic nor
centered wholly on one’s self-fulfilment. In Bahá'í terms, the process of one’s individual
development and fulfilment is tied to the centering of one’s energies on the betterment of
humankind and serving the needs of the community and the larger society.
Prayer and meditation, fighting one’s spiritual battles, living according to spiritual laws
and teachings—all are essential elements in fulfilling life’s purpose, but such efforts
reach their fullest transformative effect when they are dedicated to service.
Thus, Bahá'ís are actively engaged in developing knowledge, skills, and spiritual insights
that enable them to act as effective human resources and which are vital to the integrated
process of personal and social transformation. Presently, such collective learning takes
the form of study circles—a local, collaborative, self-directed learning process being
undertaken by Bahá’í communities around the world. All are welcome in the classes,
regardless of their ideas or beliefs.

By learning about our spiritual reality and our individual role in the progress of society,
we can better understand our purpose in life and the way to improve our own lives and
the lives of those around us.
Participants in the courses learn, for example, to teach values to children, to engage in
community service activities, to assist and empower others to independently investigate
spiritual truths, to learn how to competently express one’s views, and to engage oneself in
serving the broader needs of society for unity, justice, and equity.
Participants in study circles often experience a new sense of direction in life, better
relationships with family and friends, and a fruitful re-evaluation of the contribution one
can make to the wider community.
Education: Bahá’ís emphasize the importance of education in both its religious and
‘secular’ aspects, seeing it as a major element in the spiritual and material development of
the individual and society as a whole (Smith, 2002, p. 130).
International Teaching Centre: Established in Haifa by the Universal House of Justice
in June 1973. Duties include: to be fully informed of the situation of the Faith in all parts
of the world, and on the basis of that knowledge make recommendations to the House of
Justice and advice the Continental Counsellors; to be alert to the possibilities for the
extension of Bahá’í teaching activity; to work out regional and global teaching plans for
approval by the House of Justice.
Rationality: Bernstein calls for an alternative approach to human rationality that seeks a
way beyond objectivism and relativism. Drawing upon the work of a number of
individuals, he proposes an approach whose features include the importance of dialogue
among a community of inquirers, practical reasoning born of experience, and an ability to
refine human understanding through action over time (Lample, 2009, p. 172).
Reality: As David Bohm, the well-known physicist and philosopher, has pointed out, the
way most intellectual disciplines treat theory today is intimately connected with the
fragmentation of thought that is prevalent in society. At the most fundamental level, this
fragmentation arises, he argues, from our insistence that our theories correspond to
“reality as it is” rather than being manageable models of limited sets of phenomena
occurring within an objective reality that is infinitely complex. Since our theories are
necessarily fragmented, by considering them replicas of “reality as it is,” we end up
assuming that reality itself is fragmented. And so we miss the interconnectedness of all
things. . . . (Lample, 2009, p. 137).
Relativism: The view that any claim to truth, knowledge or morality are not absolute but
exist only in relation to a particular culture, society, or historical context (Lample, 2009,
p. 170).
Religion: Religion here is not viewed as a conglomeration of conflicting sects, but as a
body of spiritual teachings revealed progressively throughout the various stages of the
evolution of the human race (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 134).

Religion and Science: The antagonism towards science held by some religious people is
to be condemned. Knowledge is the gift of God to humanity, and divine religion promotes
truth. How then can religion oppose science? To do so is ignorance and a denial of human
intelligence. It is ignorance, not science, which threatens the foundations of religion:
dogmatism and irrationality are the cause of irreligion and the growth of secularism.
Religion should be in conformity with science and reason. Thus its foundation will be
solid, and it will be able to influence the human heart. It needs to be based on
investigation and not mere imitation. Religion that is not in accordance with science is
superstition and a human invention. It should be discarded. The maintenance of irrational
beliefs engenders vacillation and is ultimately untenable. Both science and true religion
are based on reason and should ‘bear its test’. Together they fortify each other: science
protects religion from becoming superstition; religion protects science from becoming a
barren materialism (Smith, 2002, p. 290–291).
Social reality: Social reality is ontologically subjective and epistemologically objective
(Searle, 1997, p. 12–13) Ontology has to do with the nature of being, epistemology with
what we know. Subjectivity pertains to what is personal, and objectivity to what is
independent of personal opinion. Thus, to say that social reality is ontologically
subjective means that the features of social reality do not have an existence outside of the
consensus of the human beings that create it. For example, a certain piece of paper is
money because of the intent of the social agents that created it, not because of its inherent
physical qualities. To say that social reality is epistemologically objective means that
what we know about social reality isn’t just a matter of the opinion of one individual, but
consists of objectively ascertainable facts. Thus, determining whether a particular piece of
paper is money is not a matter of the personal opinion of a single individual (Lample,
2009, p. 236).
Society: is the outcome of the consciously applied skills of human agents (Giddens, 1993,
p. 20).
Spiritual qualities: The Bahá’í writings abound with references to various spiritual and
moral qualities which the individual should seek to acquire. The attributes of good
character include the fear of God; reverence; piety; obedience to religious law; love for
God expressed in love for humanity; prayerfulness; compassion; consideration for others;
courtesy; philanthropy; service to others; industriousness; selflessness; forbearance and
calm; meekness; amiability; a lack of malice; loyalty; courage; magnanimity; generosity;
energy and zeal; a sense of honour and regard for the rights of others; high-mindedness;
detachment from material things; submissiveness to the will of God; humility; control of
the passions; temperance; purity; chastity; justice (including equity and fair-mindedness);
honesty (including truthfulness, candour and financial probity); trustworthiness (including
reliability); faithfulness; integrity; sincerity; wisdom; and moderation. Purity of
motivation is crucial. Such virtues are conducive to human dignity and honour, and the
attainment of ‘man’s true station’. Each individual should ‘strive diligently’ to acquire
them. Moral and religious qualities are also to be balanced by reason and knowledge.
Bahá’ís should be distinguished by their moral qualities. They should promote freedom.

The ‘sword’ of upright conduct is ‘sharper than blades of steel’. If the Bahá’ís succeed in
exemplifying divine virtues then they will become both completely united among
themselves and a magnet for others, who will want to discover the source of their
radiance and joy. Each individual is responsible for their own life, and should seek to
perfect their own character (and avoid backbiting about others) (Smith, 2002, p. 327).
The Universal House of Justice: Ordained by Bahá'u'lláh as the legislative authority in
the Bahá'í Faith came into existence in 1963. It is a nine-member body elected at five-
year intervals by the entire membership of the national governing institutions of the
Bahá'í world. The House of Justice directs the spiritual and administrative affairs of the
Bahá'í International Community. It serves, as well, as custodian and trustee of the Bahá'í
Holy Places and other properties in the Holy Land. Endowed by Bahá'u'lláh with the
authority to legislate on all matters not specifically laid down in the Bahá'í scriptures, the
House of Justice is the institution that keeps the Bahá'í community abreast of an ever-
changing world.
Training Institute : L’institut Pierre Becker est un institut de formation initié par la
Communauté bahá’íe du Luxembourg. Son programme s'adresse à tous ceux qui
s'intéressent à une gestion globale des défis individuels et sociaux de l'âge de maturité de
la race humaine. Il repose sur les enseignements profonds du fondateur de la Foi bahá’íe,
Bahá'u'lláh, qui unissent spiritualité et logique. L'Institut s'efforce de développer les
caractéristiques suivantes: développer conjointement les connaissances, le discernement
spirituel et les compétences de ses participants; offrir une méthodologie variée basée sur
l'étude, la consultation, l'art et la méditation ; veiller à la participation active et
l'enrichissement mutuel de tous ses étudiants; encourager tous ses étudiants à soutenir
l'évolution de la société par leur potentiel individuel unique; s'adapter continuellement et
évoluer de manière organique à l'aide du feedback de ses étudiants. Pierre Becker était un
instituteur dévoué à Kayl et un membre estimé, créatif et de longue date du Comité baha'i
pour l'éducation des enfants. Avec sa femme Christiane il a contribué de façon
significative au développement et à l'enrichissement des classes et des fêtes d'enfants.
Pierre Becker est décédé au printemps 1994 aux suites d'une tumeur cérébrale. Cet
Institut est dédié à sa personne et à son engagement infatigable pour l'éducation et
l'encouragement des enfants et des jeunes du Grand Duché (Communauté bahá’íe du
Luxembourg, 2011).
Understanding: there are two mental tools, both extremely powerful in the process of
investigation reality. One is analysis, that is, breaking things into smaller parts and then
examining the relations and interactions of these parts. The other consists of placing
things in larger contexts in order to gain insights into causes and reasons for their
existence and behavior (FUNDAEC, 2003, p. 26).

08   Tut:   ... ech hat d’Buch 1 gemaach, an do sinn ech Bahá’í ginn. Mat

1 an 3 kanns de souguer scho Kannerklassen halen.
09   Res:   How are you involved with education and how do you see

education in general
10   Tut:   Ech sinn an engem neie Schoulprojet am Moment, ((name of the

> school)), wou mer vill, vill, vill, schwätzen, wou mer eis
> zesummen immens entwéckelen, sou dass mer permanent an
> Diskussioun sinn, wéi mer sollen erzéien,
11   Tut:   an et ass eng Wëssenschaftlerin, d’Barbara Rogoff, an déi

> beschreift 3 Modeller, vun Erzéiung: si nennt een den Adult
> one, deen aneren Children, an deen aneren Community of
> Learners, a wou ech mengen, dass ech a vill, den Adult one
> praktizéiert hunn, wou ech geschafft hunn, ... ech war de

Récipient, a mir fëllen deen.
12   Tut:   An elo an der Schoul a mat menge Kollegen, an den Text, dee

> mech impressionéiert huet, de community of learners, et ass
> net e bësse vun deem an net e bëssi vun deem, et ass einfach
> eppes ganz aneschtes, wous de dech zesummen op e Wee vu Léiere

> entdecks, wou zwar déi Erwuesse méi Verantwortung fir
> d’Léieren huelen, an déi och e Kader musse schafen, et ass jo
> hir Roll, mee d’Kanner solle permanent gesinn dass den
> Erwuessenen och e Learner ass.
13   Tut:   ....permanent léiers. Fir mech ass Léieren elo eppes wat am

> Dialog geschitt mat anere Leit, an der Konfrontatioun mat
> Leit, mat Material.
14   Tut:   …wat mech frou mécht, ass dat d’Bahá’í Texter am Fong

> datselwecht soen, d’Wëssenschaft, neurobiologesch Texter, de
> Mënsch ass e Bergwerk reich an Edelsteinen, dat gëtt am Fong

15   Res:   How do you view your role ass a facilitator?
16   Tut:   Ech hunn et elo am Summer fir d’éischt gemaach, et war och do

> en Zesummeléieren, ech hunn eng Chance, dat ech konnt mat
> aneren iwwerleeën, an dass ech do e Virsprong hunn, d’Caddy an
> d’Sandrine, si hunn och Kanner, ... a si hunn och sou vill
> Erfahrung, ((the participants of the first book 3)),
17   Tut:   ech gesi meng Roll zum Deel fir heiansdo, wann d’Gespréich

18   Res:   What do you make of the three levels of understandings that

the book 1 mentions?
19   Tut:   Dat eent ass den Text verstoen, an dann? ... wat fir mech

> flott war, fir d’Buch 1 an 3 nach eng Kéier ze maachen, a wou

20   Tut:   ...op der Ebene vum Wuert immens Ënnerscheeder sinn, ech soen

> wier doriwwer ewechgaang, ...dass de d’Wuert vill méi
> zerplécks, da kritt et méi eng Déift,

21   Res:   Would you like to add anything else?
22   Tut:   Wat ech immens schéi fannen, fir Kannerklassen ze halen, eben

> och elo fir Tuteur ze sinn, dat ass wanns de anere Leit eppes

3. S1E1: 25.01.
01    Ann:   Pour moi c’est une question de de langage, alors je suis assez

> surprise de lire « enseigner les (2.0) en enseignant dES
> enfants », d’après moi on enseigne aUX enfants
03    Ann:   Ça revient (2.0) « lorsque nous enseignons les enfants »
04           ((looks and points at the book on Romain’s lap))
05           Ça me semble bizarre, alors je ne sais pas si cela
06    Tut:   L’enseignement DES enfants
07    Ann:   Oui ((looks again in the book)) on enseigne à quelqu’un (2.0)

apparament
08           Et là hm ((looks again in the book)) on enseigne les enfants, par

exemple
09           Au b) lorsque nous enseignons les enfants
10                                          = ((giggles by Romain, Anne))
11    Tut:                                        =ah, ok
12    Ann:   alors je ne sais pas si c’est, parce qu’on doit comprendre

l’enseignement autrement, ou si c’est hm une mauvais traduction
13    Tut:   C’est souvent utile de voir dans d’autres langues
14    Rom:   Comme consulter
15    Ann:                             =oui, hehe, justement quoi, c’est
16    Tut:                             =là, die Kinder unterrichten
17    Rom:                             =to teach children
18    Tut:   Teach children
19           (3.0)
20    Rom:   Donc, enseigner à quelqu’un, ˂inaudible.1˃ (on ne peut pas dire)

enseigner quelqu’un, c’est Ç A que tu dis ?

21    Ann:   Oui, on enseigne quelque chose en fait
22    Tut:   Hm ok
23    Rom:   Ok

24   Tut:   Et c’est pour ça que ça gène un peu
25   Ann:   Oui
26   Jos:   C’est BON, oui
27   Rom:   C’est bon mais c’est bizarre
28          ((Romain looks at Anne, both giggling, Josefa is leaning her head

to look closer in the book at the text))
29   Ham:   ˂inaudible.1˃
30   Ann:   Oui c’est, bon c’est, je trouve que, c’est hm, c’est écrit en

> français à la base, et, mais ça peut, hm, c’est bizarre comme
> tournure, voilà
31   Tut:   Non, mais, je pense pas qu’on veut les enfants comme des objets,

ça je suis sûr, mais je comprends que ça peut gêner (2.0)
32   Rom:   En fait c’est hm, enseignons est un peu confondu avec éduquer, car

> on éduque quelqu’un, mais on enseigne à quelqu’un ((looking at
> Anne) (.)
33   Ann:   Oui
34   Jos:   (Bien) qu’il connaisse bien la langue (1) et puis qui a rédigé le

livre ((taps with one hand on the book))
35          ˂inaudible.1˃ ((comments mixed with giggles)
36   Tut:   C’est possible, hm
37   Ham:   L’enseignement c’est dans le sens d’éduquer ici, non ((taps on the

> book and Anne, Romain and Josefa look towards him)) (2.0) c’est
> dans le même sens
38   Rom:   Oui
39   Ham:   =education
40   Rom:   C’est tout à fait le même sens, mais, hm, c’est pas utilisé
41   Ham:   Ah, d’accord
42   Rom:   Car comme disait Anne, on enseigne quelque chose à quelqu’un. Mais

je pense c’est tout simplement ˂inaudible.1˃
43   Tut:   Sûrement
44   Ham:   Le language
45          Hm hm ((not sure by whom this comment was made))

46    Tut:    Moi quand j’ai lu hm, (.5) quand nous enseignons ((giggles)) les

> enfants, nous adorons Dieu, ça m’a, c’est la première fois que
> cette phrase m’a si touché mais (2.0) pour moi c’était (.) très
> beau, car tous les jours j’ai la chance d’enseigner, d’adorer Dieu
> tout le temps (giggles). C’est de choses que je sais mais cette
> phrase m’a touché aujourd’hui plus que d’autres fois.

4. S1E2: 25.01.

001    Tut:    Qu’est-ce-que c’est les pierres précieuses?
002    Jos:    C’est les valeurs, toujours, (3.0) c’est de mettre en pratique

> chaque jour, (5.0) je crois par exemple, nous sommes entrain de
> faire <inaudible.1> l’éducation, ça c’est une valeur qu’on met en
> priorité (3.0) ((participants look in their books))
003    Rom:    Aussi, tous les exemples qu’ils donnent ici, hm, justice, vérité,

> loyauté, fidélité, hm, il est évident que aucune soit citée
> pourrait exister sans un minimum de ses valeurs là, c’est tout à
> fait impossible, qu’il y ait la moindre cohésion sociale. (3.0)
> Donc plus la complexité de connaissance et d’éducation, plus
> cette complexité s’accroit, (devient) plus grande, plus je pense
> il est important justement de développer les connaissances de
> l’humanité, tout ce trésor caché, (2.0) en nous, et dans nos
> enfants (3.0).

004    Jos:    Tu veux dire, plus qu’on est évolué, plus (.) on trouve ça?
005    Tut:    Plus c’est important
006    Rom:    Oui, plus, je ne sais pas, par exemple le téléphone portable

> ((points to the telephone on the coffee table)), à quel point,
> l’utilité, c’est, est maintenant connecté d’une manière
> différente, disant que par exemple il y a 50 ans, et plus qu’il y
> a de connexions réelles physiques, dans le monde, mais toutes les
> connexions qui se font amicales, ou clubs, professions, à tous
> les niveaux, plus il y a de nouvelles connections
007    Ham:    interactions
008    Rom:    Interactions, plus il est important d’avoir des valeurs pour tous

> le monde, et le plus de valeurs possibles, sinon on va droit dans
> le mûr
009    Jos:    parce que si je donne juste un exemple, parfois quand je veux

> vivre vraiment cette situation de valeurs vraies, moi je retourne
> un peu dans ma famille, qui est au Brésil, qui vit vraiment dans
> les champs. Je demande aux gens chaque fois que je vais chez la
> voisine, quand j’allais visiter cette gens, ils sont pas
> instruits de l’école, rien du tout, il y a des gens qui vivent de
> façon vraiment indigènes, mais qu’il y TANT de valeurs, que c’est
> TELLEMENT beau, qu’il y a un différent façon de passer cette

> message (.) parfois je retourne en arrière pour avoir un peu de
> la force pour le monde qui peut rester tellement vide (.) vous
> comprenez ce que je veux dire ?

010   Rom:    Oue oue
011   Jos:    C’est   comme si avant nous avons             ça vraiment, hm, PLUS, et vous

> allez   sentir ça si un jour vous             allez dans un endroit comme ça,
> c’est   beaucoup plus FORT, quand             même. Je trouve que le monde là,
> il va   trop vite, et nous vivons             très peu tous ces valeurs (2.0)
012   Tut:    Je suis pas toujours
013   Jos:                               [non ?
014   Tut:    Oui, et non, parce que je pense aussi dans le passé il y a des

histoires, au moyen âge et même encore dans des guerres,
015   Jos:                                                    [oui ?
016   Tut:    Horribles, donc on peut pas dire que il y a 50 ans,
017   Jos:    oui dans certains cas
018   Tut:    Dans certains donc je pense pas qu’il y a 50 ans ou 100 ans les

gens avaient plus de valeurs, hmm
019   Jos:    Pas qu’il y avait plus de valeurs, mais ils mettaient plus en

> pratique ces valeurs, je pense, peut-être qu’ils avaient plus de
> possibilités à donner cette innocence, (à passer) cette innocence
> parce que c’est une façon d’innocence aussi (.5) je ne sais pas,
> mais quand même on a eu déjà ça, c’est bien (qu’on ramène) parce
> que autrement si nous avons pas ça en arrière, je ne pense pas
> que nous avons la capacité d’être ici aujourd’hui entrain de
> parler de ça.

020   Tut:    Hmm ((wondering))
021   Jos:    Vous savez (.) mais c’est bien (.) il faut vraiment avoir la

force hm ?
022   Ham:    Mais je crois le (problème) est relatif, il y a 50 ans, on ne

> connaissait pas le futur, on aurait le même argument en disait
> oui il y a 50 ans les gens, seraient (in touch with) c’est
> toujours relatif au point.

023   Jos:    Hmm ((agreeing))
024   Ham:    Dans 50 ans on va dire, oui, il y a 50 ans on était beaucoup plus

dans les valeurs, car c’est toujours relatif
025   Tut:    Il y a Socrates, c’est vraiment en vieux grec, 2000 ans, euh, je

> ne sais pas, et il y a une citation de lui quand il dit oui mais
> les jeunes ils ne travaillent pas, ils s’amusent juste, et quand

01    Tut:     ((whispers))Ok alors un bonjour à jean-marie

02          ((Anne and Tutor wave at the camera))
03   Tut:   Bonjour jean-marie
04   Rom:   Bonjour jean-marie
05          ((Hamed leans forward and Josefa giggles)
06   Tut:   Alors Josefa la dernière fois on avait parlé des différents éléments

qui sont dans les classes
07   Tut:   Que qu’on apprend des citations par cœur et avant de les apprendre

par cœur on explique les différents mots aux enfants
08   Tut:   Et hm on fait la musique
09   Jos:   oui
10   Tut:   C’est comme ça aussi qu’on chante des prières ou des chansons
11   Tut:   Et après hm on raconte les histoires que souvent (ce sont) des

> histoires de la vie d’'Abdu'l-Bahá qui est l’exemple parfait de la
> vie bahá’íe
12   Tut:   Mais aussi d’autres histoires, mais très souvent c’est des histoires
13   Jos:   seulement
14   Tut:   C’est des histoires sur la vie d’'Abdu'l-Bahá
15   Tut:   Et après hm des jeux aussi des jeux dans des classes souvent des

jeux coopératifs (on joue) ensemble pour un but commun
16   Tut:   Et c’est là qu’on c’est arrêté donc on va continuer un peu sur les

jeux
17   Tut:   Donc ça c’est les différentes activités qu’on fait dans une classe
18   Jos:   D’accord
19   Tut:   Ok ?
20   Tut:   Hamed, tu veux commencer la section 9

((Hamed reads section 9 and section 10))
21   Ham:   Exercez-vous à expliquer trois jeux différents à vos collaborateurs
22   Tut:   ((giggles))
23   Ann:   ((looks up to Hamed, while smiling))
24   Tut:   Alors tu nous expliques ((giggles while talking))

25    Ham:   (je connais pas de jeux)
26    Tut:   Tu pourrais nous expliquer le jeu « porter le malade » et nous on va

> porter Romain à la cuisine ((giggles))((« carry the sick » )) is a
> game that was introduced and explained in section 10))
27    Rom:   D’accord
28    Ann:   Il faut vraiment le faire ?
29    Ham:   on a compris(2.0)
31    Ham:   Pourquoi est-il nécessaire de motiver les enfants et de leur

> expliquer le but du jeu, même s’ils sont déjà familiers avec le
> jeu ? ((Hamed goes on to read the next question))

16. S5E2: 26.4.
01    Tut:   Mais il faut aussi veiller hm à ce que les enfants n’ont pas

> seulement le plaisir, parce-que nous ont est tout le temps entrain
> de d’applaudir hm
02    Tut:   C’est important aussi qu’ils ont le plaisir de jouer pour le jeu de

> faire des actions pour les actions, de ne pas dépendre des adultes
> qui tout le temps encouragent
03    Rom:   Oui
04    Tut:   Là c’est aussi un peu la balance (2.0) à trouver hm
05    Rom:   Eh
06    Tut:   Qu’il n’ont pas seulement la joie de jouer parce que on est tout le

> temps entrain de faire les clowns ((lifts up her hands and shakes
> them))
07    Tut:   Mais qu’ils ont vraiment aussi le plaisir au jeu
08    Rom:   Donc de nouveau l’importance de bien expliquer les règles et de

canaliser hm
09    Tut:   [et de répéter aussi les jeux hm pour donner la chance parce que un

> jeu qu’on joue une fois hm on est plus encore concentré sur les
> règles et comment ça marche
10    Tut:   C’est après seulement qu’on peut hm avoir plus de plaisir et de

> devenir mieux au jeu je pense que c’est aussi on est de nouveau
> ((points briefly pen to Hamed)) à la repetition Mr Hamed
11           ((some short giggles))
12    Tut:   La dernière fois ((turning towards Josefa)) Hamed il a dit que la

répétition c’est la mère du savoir

13   Tut:   Quand on répète beaucoup les choses
14   Jos:   C’est vrai
15   Ham:   Mais c’est pas de moi
16   Tut:   Oui, tu as cité
17          ((some short giggles))
18   Tut:   Ok
18          (5.0)
a
18   Rom:   Est-ce-que les enfants doivent savoir parfaitement jouer au jeu pour
b           éprouver du succès ((reads question 3))
19          ((the section on games has been read and discussed; section 13 on

colouring has been read by the tutor))
20   Tut:   Donc les coloriages sont ici hm ((flicks through the pages of the

book)) (2.0) ((the participants also flick through their books))
21   Tut:   Mais moi je dois leur dire que ça n’éveille pas trop les sentiments

> de beauté ((she stresses the words « sentiments de beauté » with
> giggles))
22   Rom:   ((giggles))
23   Tut:   Je sais pas ce que vous en pensez? (2.0)
24   Rom:   Pour la plupart je suis d’accord avec toi (2.0)
25   Ann:   Mais il faut les colorier c’est peut-être (plus) ((raises her hand))
26   Rom:   Justement, voilà, ils ont tout misé là-dessus. ((giggles by Anne,

tutor and Josefa)) (2.0))
27   Tut:   Enfin c’est vrai il y a des enfants qui aiment colorier, mais on

> trouve aussi d’autres activités peut-être plus créatifs que enfin
> moi je suis pas trop pour le coloriage
28   Ham:   Il y a toujours la situation qui va avec c’est une leçon en meme

> temps ((underneath each drawing is a short quotation that goes with
> the drawing))
29   Tut:   Mais on peut aussi trouver d’autres (1.0) par exemple pour la

> citation « vous êtes tous des feuilles d’un même arbre » je leur
> avait dessinée un arbre et donnée des papiers de différents tons de
> vert et ils ont découpé les feuilles dessus donc c’était un peu plus

> plus aussi on met toujours la citation mais on essaie de faire un
> peu plus (1.0) je pense si on n’a pas toujours les moyens de d’avoir
> des bricolages alors c’est quand même [ils aiment bien colorer hm je
> suis toujours étonnée ((giggles)) (4.0)

30    Tut:      voilà?
31    Ann:      (ceux qui ont) de l’imagination de
32    Tut:      Oui On peut se débrouiller comme ça ils aiment bien mais on peut

plus varier si on

01    Res:      Si vous voulez, on peut faire un petit tour, chacun s’exprime un

02              (2.0)
03    Res:      Ça va?
04    ?         Toi d’abord ((giggles))
05    Tut:      Oui ça nous intéresse
06    Ann:      Mais oui
07    Res:      Bon, c’est intéressant de noter que le programme du master

18. INTS5E1: 26.4.
01    Ham:      Si j’ai développé ou changé, hm, ff, hm, (2.0) je dirais que oui,

> hm, mais peut être pas très <inaudible.1> en fait, dans un

02    Ham:      mais ce qui était dans ce sens nouveau pour moi, le développement

que je l’ai vu dans un contexte très pratique,
03    Ham:      et maintenant surtout en ayant deux enfants, on s’imagine vraiment

> le contexte, concret, dans tous ce qui, avant tous ces concepts
> c’était rien que théorique,
04    Ham:      on apprend, mais on ne réfléchit pas vraiment dessus, le

> questions,
05    Ham:      mais maintenant, j’ai l’occasion vraiment de voir dans un contexte

> très réel, de ce point de vue là, c’est un développement qui se
> produit.
06    Jos:      Par exemple la partie (qui voir) le bien <inaudible.1> (transformer

toujours) le mal, même pour nous c’est très difficile, hm.

07   Jos:   ça on doit réellement travailler avec nous, pour que nous on passer

> ça vraiment à nos enfants, autrement ça va pas passer la

> pense (0.5)
08   Jos:   mais c’est un long travail parce que, éduquer nous-mêmes, ce n’est

pas si facile que ça. ((giggles by Josefa et Anne)
09   Ann:   C’est bien dit
10   Jos:   L’histoire de Bahá’u’lláh, qui est vraiment très belle, mais c’est

> vrai pour appliquer tous les jours, ce n’est pas si facile, mais on
> arrivera.
11   Ham:   Si je peux retourner, comme par exemple en fait, que (considérez)

> l’homme comme une mine riche en gemmes, est quelque chose, une
> citation qu’on a, que j’ai relu et entendu des milliers, et milliers

> vraiment donné beaucoup de joie, c’est vraiment quelque chose qui
> (était) là, des mots très belles, une situation très <inaudible.1>,
> et en visualisant mon propre enfant dans ce contexte, ca fait battre

12   Ann:   Hm, mon développement, effectivement, comme on disait au début on se

13   Rom:   Moi je suis très content d’être avec vous ici ce soir, ((group

14   Res:   Tu as parlé aussi de toi, le développement chez toi?
15   Rom:   Je pense que oui, un grand oui, parce que comme disait Hamed, avoir

> compris d’une certaine manière certaines choses depuis certaines

16   Tut:   Hm, donc moi je suis tout au début de mon activité de tutrice,

17   Res:   Et tu as trouvé quelque chose qui te permet maintenant
18   Tut:   [Pour l’instant je suis très <inaudible.1> quand je suis moins

21    Rom:   Tu sens que tu te développes, dans ton rôle de tutrice, tu sens

22    Tut:   [pas aussi vite que j’aimerais ((giggles)) je me sens pas encore

23    Jos:   Alors les élèves ici étaient un peu durs
24    Tut:   Ah oui, he, ((giggles)) mais ils étaient toujours très gentils, les

03    Ann:   Ah d’accord, mais dans le Ruhi 1 ça m’avait déjà BEAUCOUP

embêté ((giggles by Josefa))
04    Tut:   Donc c’est pas mieux dans le Ruhi 3 ?
05    Jos:   Peut-être il fallait changer un peu, dans la façon un peu

plus adulte
06   Ann:      Ou c’est voulu
07   Rom:      Forcément c’est voulu, à ce niveau, c’est (2) comment vous

avez appris

09   Tut:      Hm ((agreeing))
10   Rom:      Mais moi j’ai mis 10 ans à revenir, car ca me dérangeait

énormément aussi
11   Jos:      Oui, oui, c’est plusieurs personnes alors
12   Res:      Ça peut être une recommandation
13   Tut:      À un moment c’était vraiment beaucoup, c’était vraiment la

16   Tut:      Ça va être difficile, hm
17   Tut:      Si c’est pas trop long, ca va
18   Tut:      Ça reste pas
19   Rom:      Ça reste pas
20   Ham:      Ça devient un automatisme
21   Tut:      C’est comme Anne l’a dit, quand c’est trop, on voulait juste

encore finir, hm ?
22   Ham:      E pour les passages qui sont plus brefs, on est stimulé, on

voulait
23   ?         Oui, oui,

8\.3 Appendix: Data collected: Documents
8\.3.1 Document 1: Learning through the Ruhi Institute
The Ruhi Institute curriculum had been tested and adapted over many years. It has enabled the
friends in different countries to get the institute system up and running in a short time. Rather than
having the participants be passive listeners to a wide array of unconnected talks, the Ruhi Institute
materials seek to engage the friends fully in the process of learning. Bahá'ís with diverse cultural
and educational backgrounds have found the curriculum's deceptively simple approach, based
heavily on connecting the believers to the Creative Word, both appealing and empowering
(International Teaching Centre, 2000, p. 5).

8\.3.2 Document 2: Collaborative Study for Individual and Social

Transformation
At the heart of the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the force of transformation, both of the individual
and of society. The transformation of the individual is not an isolated process, not ascetic nor
centered wholly on one’s self-fulfilment. In Bahá'í terms, the process of one’s individual
development and fulfilment is tied to the centering of one’s energies on the betterment of
humankind and serving the needs of the community and the larger society.
Prayer and meditation, fighting one’s spiritual battles, living according to spiritual laws and
teachings—all are essential elements in fulfilling life’s purpose, but such efforts reach their fullest
transformative effect when they are dedicated to service.
Thus, Bahá'ís are actively engaged in developing knowledge, skills, and spiritual insights that
enable them to act as effective human resources and which are vital to the integrated process of
personal and social transformation. Presently, such collective learning takes the form of study
circles—a local, collaborative, self-directed learning process being undertaken by Bahá’í
communities around the world. All are welcome in the classes, regardless of their ideas or beliefs.
By learning about our spiritual reality and our individual role in the progress of society, we can
better understand our purpose in life and the way to improve our own lives and the lives of those
around us.
Participants in the courses learn, for example, to teach values to children, to engage in community
service activities, to assist and empower others to independently investigate spiritual truths, to
learn how to competently express one’s views, and to engage oneself in serving the broader needs
of society for unity, justice, and equity.
Participants in study circles often experience a new sense of direction in life, better relationships
with family and friends, and a fruitful re-evaluation of the contribution one can make to the wider
community (Bahá’í International Community, 2011a).

Transmitted by email: [...]
Mr Jean-Marie Nau
Luxembourg
Dear Bahá’í Friend,
[...] In response to the query you raised [...], the Universal House of Justice has instructed us to
write to you as follows.
[...] the House of Justice appreciates your desire to champion the activities that lie at the heart of

8\.3.4 Document 4: Object of every religion
Appendix A: A national education program: core curriculum for spiritual education
Is it not the object of every Revelation to effect a transformation in the whole character of
mankind, a transformation that shall manifest itself, both outwardly and inwardly, that shall affect
both its inner life and external conditions? For if the character of mankind be not changed, the
futility of God's universal Manifestations would be apparent (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of
Bahá'u'lláh, p. 25, Compilations, NSA USA - Developing Distinctive Baha'i Communities)
8\.3.5 Document 5: Dialogical process
Individual interpretation rarely remains wholly personal. One studies the teachings and derives
insights, but inevitably, these views are shared with others in a dialogical process that guides the
collective quest for intersubjective agreement upon which action rests. This consultative process
is to be conducted in a manner that preserves unity while striving to achieve Bahá’u’lláh’s
purpose for humanity. In such a dialogue, individual opinions “lack authority,” and a person is to
“offer his own idea as a contribution to knowledge, making it clear that his views are merely his
own.”
While “every believer is fully entitled to voice” personal views, these ideas “can never be upheld
as a standard for others to accept, nor should disputes ever be permitted to arise over differences
in such opinions.” Such views are to be expressed without pressing them on fellow believers. And
it is then incumbent upon the listener not to suppress the views of others, which would be a
restriction of individual freedom, but to respond in a tolerant, dispassionate and courteous way
(Lample, 2009, p. 35).
8\.3.6 Document 6: Investigating reality like a ‘scout’
The learned Bahá’í is not an “impartial observer.” The resolution of important questions requires
more than the application of methods of the natural sciences. It is not possible to stand apart from
the community to study it without influencing it or being influenced by it.
Perhaps the learned Bahá’í is more like the “scout” who helps to guide an expedition on a journey
into unexplored territory. This role involves investigating the unknown and generating and
applying knowledge to contribute to the success of the mission at hand. It is someone who
participates actively in the journey, but whose specialized knowledge, skills, and experience
informs various aspects of the struggle to make progress: constructive perspectives into the past,
present, and future; insight and technical capacity for ongoing study of the Text; problem posing
and problem solving; the defining of culture and intercultural relations. On this journey, the
learned individual/scout does not have authority, and, while making a vital contribution, like any
other participant is fallible and learns over time.
One of the distinctions often made between the natural and social sciences is that in the natural
sciences, the study is of objects; in the social sciences the study is of people—“the object is a
subject.”78 This presents a special challenge to the social sciences because not only are
researchers attempting to make sense of their studies, but the people they are attempting to
understand are also continually engaged in an ever-changing process of interpretation and action.
The implication of this specific challenge is not that one cannot conduct research in areas that
pertain to human beings, but rather, that in doing so one must be aware of the inherent limitations
and potential consequences in order to determine how best to be effective (Lample, 2009, p. 152)

8\.3.7 Document 7: Tutor and student as collaborators
TO THE COLLABORATORS
The Ruhi Institute uses the term “collaborators” to refer to all who study, teach or apply its
courses, wherever they may reside. These participants are indeed collaborators, because all
share the Institute’s purpose: to use the courses as means of serving the Cause and promoting
the well-being of humanity. In every study group there is always a more experienced person
who acts as a tutor. The other members of the group constitute the “students” who seek the
tutor’s help with their studies. However, it is clearly understood by all participants that they
are engaged in a reciprocal process, one in which everyone learns. The responsibility of
learning rests with each participant. It is the student who undertakes the active work of
learning. The tutor facilitates this process and also gains new insights into the material. The
relationship is not that of a learned one with a group of ignorant people (Ruhi Institute, 1999,
p. 1).
8\.3.8 Document 8: Towards a Bahá’í educational system
The first unit of the book, "Some Principles of Baha'i Education", is concerned with certain basic
concepts. There is no educational system in the world today that can properly be called "Baha'i".
Such a system can only be created through the efforts of numerous educators working in diverse
settings and cultures over an extended period of time. Nevertheless, certain principles and
concepts can be identified that should influence endeavours to develop elements of Baha'i
education, and this unit briefly examines some of them.
One of the basic concepts discussed in the unit is the nobility of man. It is essential for the
participants in the course -- future teachers of children -- to understand the impact this extremely
important principle will have on the kind of education he or she will eventually offer. By the
mere acceptance that each student is a "mine rich in gems of inestimable value", the teacher of a
beginning children's class takes an enormous step away from current educational practices. Yet
the acceptance of this concept is not, in itself, sufficient. Baha'i teachers should also be familiar
with the nature of spiritual qualities and know enough about human talents and capacities to be
able to discover these gems in their students and actively help polish them. They also have to be
fully aware of the importance of helping children develop habits and patterns of behavior that are
in keeping with a Baha'i way of life.
In general, this unit is not complex and, like all Ruhi Institute materials, is taught in courses that
are conducted tutorially. This is best done by dividing the participants into small groups and
allowing each group to move along at its own pace and according to its own rhythm. This point is
crucial, because an attempt to accelerate or slow down any participant's pace, forcing him or her
to move at the same rate as the others, can hamper the learning process. In this respect it should
be noted that the tutor's role is not any less important for the fast learners than it is for those who
learn at a slower pace. The tutor should discuss all of the sections with each group of students. A
Ruhi Institute course should not be treated as an independent study by the participants, the results
of which are merely checked by the tutor. Some discussion with the tutor is needed so that
participants understand the materials presented in each section at three levels of comprehension:
the meaning of the words and sentences, the application of the concepts in one's life and work,
and their implications for certain related situations (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 1–2).

8\.3.9 Document 9: Acquisition of knowledge
A Problem of Knowledge
[...] there is a process of understanding and action in which the Bahá’í community explores
reality, grows in comprehension and knowledge, unifies thought, and contributes to transforming
the world in accordance with the truths expressed in Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation (Lample, 2009, p.
161).
We need to become conscious that any contemporary understanding of an evolving Faith must be
to some degree imperfect; that over time, through the processes that Bahá’u’lláh has put into
place, we can create a community more closely attuned to His will and purpose—and indeed we
must constantly struggle and sacrifice in order to do so; that the acquisition of knowledge through
science and religion is the motive force driving progress; and that acquisition of knowledge must
be associated with action and reflection on action. We face, therefore, not the contending
alternatives of liberalism and fundamentalism, each of which contains aspects that contradict the
teachings; rather, we are collectively attempting, under the guidance of the Universal House of
Justice, to define a course along the “Straight Path” that avoids the dangers of “irresponsible
freedom” and “extreme orthodoxy.” What is necessary, as we increasingly elucidate and refine
understanding and practice in the Bahá’í community, is to recognize that Scylla and Charybdis
are, after all, myths (Lample, 2009, p. 189).
8\.3.10 Document 10: Limits on understanding
The Bahá’í Writings place definite limits on understanding. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that human
beings cannot know the essence of a thing, but only its qualities.25 He also states that all ways of
human knowing—reason, tradition, the senses, and inspiration—are fallible, and therefore must
be checked against one another.26 Science, then, is extolled for its powers of empirical
investigation and reason, but its limitations are also acknowledged. Religion takes its place along
with science as a means for investigating reality, educating humanity, and contributing to the
advancement of civilization (Lample, 2009, p. 175).
8\.3.11 Document 11: Education and Consultation
Bahá'ís see education in terms of the knowledge, qualities, skills, attitudes, and capacities that
enable individuals to become conscious subjects of their own growth, and active, responsible
participants in a systematic process of building a new world order. Ongoing education is at the
very heart of any healthy Bahá'í community. Successful community action requires the
development of each person's capacity for intellectual investigation. Through community
consultation, members learn to analyze social conditions and discover the forces that have caused
them. In order to contribute to consultation on community problems and generate plans, each
person must develop the ability to express ideas and listen carefully to others. A well-educated
community member is a determined yet humble participant who helps overcome conflict and
division, thereby contributing to a spirit of unity and collaboration (Bahá’í International
Community, 1990).
8\.3.12 Document 12: Understanding our being-in-the-world
According to Bernstein, if we want to exorcise the Cartesian Anxiety, then we need a different
way of thinking and of understanding our being-in-the-world. If we are dialogical beings—always
engaged in conversation, interpretation, and action—then the dynamics of understanding underlie

and pervade all human activity. At the same time, there is a need to preserve the
Enlightenment/Cartesian meaning of truth: that all claims to truth can withstand evaluation by a
community of interpreters based on a commonly agreed upon standard of acceptability. In the
final section of his book, Bernstein gives a summary of the views of four different philosophers—
Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, and Hannah Arendt— and puts forward a description
of the elements of the new conversation he sees. Its features may be summarized as follows:
There are no universal frameworks for knowing; however, progress is possible. Instead of
considering knowledge as a platform on which you stand as a bedrock of certainty, perhaps it
might be more accurate to compare knowledge to a rope that is “connected” from above to some
aspect of truth about reality. Humanity struggles unsteadily to climb this rope to achieve higher
understanding. Thus, there is no secure basis on which we stand; certainty lies beyond our grasp,
but we advance in knowledge indefinitely. At a certain point, a particular “rope”— some body of
knowledge or theory—takes us only so far, in which case we transfer to a new rope that takes us
further in our understanding of reality.
Knowledge is obtained through a process that associates hermeneutics and praxis, that is,
interpretation and action. Of course, there are specific circumstances when a particular method
has been proven to be effective in uncovering or applying knowledge within fixed circumstances.
Examples include certain methods for conducting scientific experiments, for constructing a
building, or for growing a particular crop. But the advancement of the field itself—science,
architecture, agriculture—takes place in a context of learning that encompasses hermeneutics and
praxis.
Understanding is a form of practical reasoning and practical knowledge. As a community acts, it
engages in the judgment and discourse of everyday practice. Such reasoning involves mediation
between the universal and particular. It includes practical application of value judgments. Human
beings aspire to universality even though they know every claim to it is fallible. Indeed, all speech
presupposes universal claims. When consensus in a community breaks down, as in the case of
questions of rightness or appropriateness, then discourse is needed to re-establish the collective
agreement on which further action depends.
The investigation of reality and discovery of new knowledge comes from a community in
discourse. There is a communal character to rationality and decisions are not arbitrary or
subjective. There must be conscious effort to foster the emergence of dialogical communities in
the political, scientific, and other realms. Bernstein explains that vestiges of positivism / scientism
/ absolutism that impose an orthodoxy in the name of scientific truth have to be uprooted in order
to allow for learning and practical wisdom. It must also be affirmed that there is access to truth
that is available to humanity outside the functioning of normal science.
As a community engages in dialogue, a tradition emerges over time. Historical experience is an
important contribution to understanding. A tradition shapes the investigator of truth, it defines the
evolving set of standards, practices and understandings that enables the community to distinguish
between truth and error, and it is the repository for the body of knowledge accumulated over time.
The tradition must be living—that is, open to influence from the unknown that it encounters,
allowing itself to be reshaped and refocused. Otherwise, it becomes fossilized and, gradually, a
collection of superstitions. Different traditions interact in an encounter of horizons that reshapes
each.
On some questions, at a given point in history, two inquirers can come to different conclusions
without either using faulty logic or method. The standards for making judgments evolve over time

as part of the learning process of a community. At a certain point in history, standards may not
exist for resolving a contradiction. In this case, judgment must be withheld, and parallel paths of
action or experimentation permitted. Time will tell, allowing the better arguments, standards, and
practices to eventually demonstrate their superiority (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 92–93).
8\.3.13 Document 13: Learning as action, reflection, consultation and study
It will proceed naturally as the friends in every cluster persevere in applying the provisions of the
Plan through a process of action, reflection, consultation and study, and learn as a result. (Ridván
Messages, Ridván 167, 2010)
8\.3.14 Document 14: The Independent Investigation of Truth
Baha'u'llah emphasizes the fundamental obligation of human beings to acquire knowledge with
their "own eyes and not through the eyes of others." One of the main sources of conflict in the
world today is the fact that many people blindly and uncritically follow various traditions,
movements, and opinions. God has given each human being a mind and the capacity to
differentiate truth from falsehood. If individuals fail to use their reasoning capacities and choose
instead to accept without question certain opinions and ideas, either out of admiration for or fear
of those who hold them, then they are neglecting their basic moral responsibility as human beings.
Moreover, when people act in this way, they often become attached to some particular opinion or
tradition and thus intolerant of those who do not share it. Such attachments can, in turn, lead to
conflict. History has witnessed conflict and even bloodshed over slight alterations in religious
practice, or a minor change in the interpretation of doctrine. Personal search for truth enables the
individual to know why he or she adheres to a given ideology or doctrine.
Bahá'ís believe that, as there is only one reality, all people will gradually discover its different
facets and will ultimately come to common understanding and unity, provided they sincerely seek
after truth. In this connection, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said:
Being one, truth cannot be divided, and the differences that appear to exist among the many
nations only result from their attachment to prejudice. If only men would search out truth, they
would find themselves united.
And further: The fact that we imagine ourselves to be right and everybody else wrong is the
greatest of all obstacles in the path towards unity, and unity is necessary if we would reach truth,
for truth is one (Bahá’í International Community, 2011b).
8\.3.15 Document 15: Understanding and Memorization
To the collaborators
The methodology of the children’s classes combines different activities, all focused on the
principle goal of motivating the development of attitudes and spiritual qualities. All these
activities revolve around the Creative Word, which alone has the power to awaken spiritual
susceptibilities in the children, and a strong emphasis is placed memorizing the Creative Word.
Memorization has an even greater effect if what is being memorized is well understood. For this
reason, each lesson includes material to help children understand the meaning of the quotation, as
well as activities to help further this understanding. Unfortunately, at this point, there is not an
abundance of songs, games and stories which directly reinforce the ideas presented in the

quotations to be memorized. It is hoped that, in the future, many more such activities will be
created and compiled for the use of Bahá’í children’s class teachers (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 3)
8\.3.16 Document 16: Memorization
Unit 1
Section 1 [...] By studying the following quotations of Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá you will
begin to appreciate your work as a children’s class teacher. It will help you to memorize these
words and have them always in mind when you teach. [...]
“Blessed is that teacher who shall arise to instruct the children...”
“Among the greatest of all services that can possibly be rendered by man to Almighty God is the
education and training of children....”
“According to the explicit divine Text, teaching the children is indispensable and obligatory. It
followeth that teachers are servants of the Lord God, since they have arisen to perform this task,
which is the same as worship. You must therefore offer praise with every breath, for you are
educating your spiritual children.”
Section 3 [...] “Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone,
cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.”
Section 4 Now, memorize the above words of Bahá'u'lláh [...].
Section 8 [...] Read and memorize the following words of Bahá'u'lláh:
“Whoso ariseth among you to teach the Cause of his Lord, let him, before all else, teach his own
self, that his speech may attract the hearts of them that hear him.”
Section 10 [...] Memorize the following words of Bahá'u'lláh:
“Let God be your fear, O people, and be ye of them that tread the path of righteousness” (Ruhi
Institute, 1995).
8\.3.17 Document 17: Memorization
Some principles of Bahá’í education – Section 3
After you have explained to the children the meaning of a quotation, the next step is to help them
memorize it. Surely, in your life you have memorized many quotations and poems. How can this
be done? Once the meaning of a quotation is understood, memorizing it is very simple. The
quotation is divided into parts and you begin by memorizing the first part. Later, the second part
is learned, and then both parts are repeated together. You continue in this way until the entire
quotation is learned by heart. For example in order to learn the prayer in Section 2, you begin with
“Oh God, guide me ...,” and ask the children, sometimes individually and other times as a group,
to repeat the words. Then you combine “Oh God, guide me” with “protect me ...,” repeat the two
phrases together, then add “...make of me a shining lamp...,” and so on with each phrase until the
end of the prayer. Once the whole group of children has repeated the entire prayer, each child is
patiently helped to recite the prayer by heart.
Undoubtedly, as a conscientious Bahá’í teacher, you will with to begin your new tasks by
teaching yourself. Therefore, when you look at the 15 lessons for children presented further on in
this unit, dedicate some time to studying the meaning of the quotations, thinking about examples

given to clarify the meaning for the children, and memorizing the quotations (Ruhi Institute,
1995, p. 27)
8\.3.18 Document 18: The Aim of Education

> for the occasion of the United Nations Year of Literacy. The text has been slightly
> modified to make the reading suitable for this unit. Although the original document is
> concerned with literacy, the paragraphs presented here contain ideas that are pertinent to

Education is a continuous and creative process. Its aim is to develop the capacities latent in
human nature and to coordinate their expression for the enrichment and progress of society.
Within this creative process, it is possible to achieve harmony between faith and reason through
an approach to education that encourages the free investigation of reality and trains minds to
recognize truth, irrespective of its origin.
Today’s worldwide educational crisis calls for a global redefinition of education in order to
emphasize its transformational role in both individual lives and social organization. It is necessary
to define concepts such as basic education, literacy, and vocational education in a way that does
not limit the horizons of the great majority of humanity to the acquisition of a few skills and the
grasp of a few facts. The minimum requirements of education need to be conceived in terms of
the understanding of basic concepts and the development of qualities, attitudes, skills and abilities
that enable individuals to become conscious subjects of their own growth and active, responsible
participants in a systematic process of building a world civilization.
An educational approach aimed at personal growth and societal transformation must admit that
when words and actions are not directed by a moral force, scientific knowledge and technological
know-how conduce as readily to misery as they do to prosperity and happiness. But moral values
are not mere constructs of social processes. Rather, they are expressions of the inner forces that
operate in the spiritual reality of every human being, and education must concern itself with these
forces if it is to tap the roots of motivation and produce meaning and lasting change.
Within this context we propose that programs of literacy and basic education look beyond the
skills of reading, writing, and simple arithmetic and also consider the following achievements as
compelling goals for their participants:
-   The realization that it is chiefly service to humanity and dedication to the unification of

> humankind that unlock individual capacity and release creative powers latent in human
> nature.
-   The understanding that the mere knowledge of principles is insufficient to ensure personal

growth and social change, that both require the exercise and application of will.
-   A firm conviction that human honor and happiness lie in self-respect and noble purposes, in

integrity and moral quality, and not in the pursuit of wealth and power for their own sake.
-   A reasonable degree of excellence in at least one productive skill through which individuals

> can experience the truth that work is worship when performed in a spirit of service, and can
> secure the means of existence with dignity and honor.
-   An adequate understanding, at least in the local context, of some of the concerns of programs

of social progress, such as health and sanitation, agriculture, crafts, and industry.

-   Some development of the individual’s capacity for intellectual investigation as a

> distinguishing power of the human mind and as an indispensable instrument for successful
> community action.
-   Some capacity to analyze social conditions and discover the forces that have caused them, and

> a corresponding ability to express ideas, so as to be able to contribute to consultation on
> community problems.
-   The capacity to take part in community planning and action as a determined yet humble

> participant who helps overcome conflict and division and contributes to the establishment of a
> spirit of unity and collaboration.
-   A disposition to analyze and a desire to understand the features of different forms of

government, law, and public administration (FUNDAEC, 2003, p. 17–18).

8\.3.19 Document 19: Content and expected outcome of learning
Instructions to the tutor
Participants should be divided into groups, allowing each group to move along at its own pace
and according to its own rhythm, so as to facilitate the learning process (in the case study, there
was only one group of 4 participants).
The tutor should discuss each section with each group of students, so that they understand the
content at three levels of comprehension: the meaning of words and sentences, the application of
the concepts in one’s life and work, and their implications for certain related situations (the first
and second level has been observed during observations of the case study).
What participants are expected to know after completing Ruhi book 3: Unit 1
There is no educational system in the world today that can be properly called “Bahá’í”.
Understand some of the basic principles of Bahá’í education of children.
-   The nobility of man, accepting that each student is a mine rich in gems, and understanding the

impact of this principle on the education offered.

-   Being familiar with the nature of spiritual qualities.
-   Knowing about human talents and capabilities that allow the discovery of the gems in their

students and actively help polish them.
-   Helping children to develop habits and patterns of behaviour that are in keeping with a Bahá’í

way of life.

What participants are expected to know after completing Ruhi book 3: Unit 2
Learn to teach simple children’s classes consisting of memorization of prayers and quotations,
songs, stories, games and colouring.
-   The tutor should allow a great deal of time for the future teachers to practice giving the

> classes as they study the course (None of the four participants have taken the course in order
> to give children’s classes. Their first motive was in educating their own children. This is
> documented in the written questionnaire).
-   The unit offers suggestions to counteract the normal tendency for participants to recreate for

> them the same learning experiences they had in their own formative stages (Here is good
> example of an evolving element in conceptual framework for social action, as the following
> generations would have received more appropriate learning experiences).

-   The emphasis is on the development in the children attitudes and spiritual qualities that will

> bring them closer to God. Establishing the foundations of the child’s character take priority
> and are followed by giving general knowledge about the Faith in later years. Instructions
> given in Ruhi book 3 to the tutor as to how the course should conducted.
-   The methodology of the children’s classes combine different activities, all focused on the

> principal goal of motivating the development of attitudes and spiritual qualities. The activities
> revolve around the Creative Word, which alone has the power to awaken spiritual

> lesson includes material to help children understand the meaning of the quotation as well as
activities to help further this understanding.
o Constant practice will enable participants to tell stories of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the Exemplar

> of Bahá’í life, and to remember the details that give excitement to a story and present
> the events in an effective way.
o It is advisable that participants start out alongside experienced teachers or with a

> small number of children (four or five). It is possible to teach only certain elements
> (quotations, or a story) at the beginning, and as confidence develops, introduce more
> elements and more children.
o Songs used in the lessons accompany the material and many more are available

> online. They help the teacher and the children to learn how to sing the songs (Some
> participants play the guitar and played with the group, teaching them songs).

What participants are expected to know after completing Ruhi book 3: Unit 3
-   Participants develop the skills and abilities needed to conduct classes for children, managing

> the class with a great deal of love and understanding and, at the same time, with the discipline
> necessary to create a proper learning environment. Participants should achieve a balanced
> understanding of how to keep a class happy and full of love, yet also highly disciplined. They
> should develop a capacity to inculcate in each child the spiritual discipline that results from
> love and trust in God, and not impose discipline through fear of punishment.
-   Participants should consult upon each section, together with their tutor, a person that is more

experienced (Ruhi Institute, 1995).

8\.5 Appendix B: Consultation
The administrative bodies of the Bahá'í Faith at all levels use a distinctive method of non-
adversarial decision-making, known as consultation.
The principles of consultation were laid down in Bahá'u'lláh's writings and, as a procedure for
building consensus and investigating truth, they have the potential for wide application. Indeed,
Bahá'ís have found them to be useful in virtually any arena where group decision-making and
cooperation is required. These principles are used not only by the Faith's own institutions, but in
Bahá'í-owned businesses, in Bahá'í-operated schools, and in day-to-day decision-making of Bahá'í
families.
In essence, consultation seeks to build consensus in a manner that unites various constituencies
instead of dividing them. It encourages diversity of opinion and acts to control the struggle for
power that is otherwise so common in traditional decision-making systems.
Bahá'í consultation is based on the following principles:
   Information should be gathered from the widest possible range of sources, seeking a

> diversity of points of view. This may mean making special efforts to seek the views of
> specialists--such as lawyers, doctors, or scientists. It may also mean looking for
> information outside traditional specialties or making a special effort to consider the views
> of community members from diverse backgrounds.
   During discussion, participants must make every effort to be as frank and candid as

> possible, while maintaining a courteous interest in the views of others. Personal attacks,
> blanket ultimatums and prejudicial statements are to be avoided.
   When an idea is put forth it becomes at once the property of the group. Although this

> notion sounds simple, it is perhaps the most profound principle of consultation. For in this
> rule, all ideas cease to be the property of any individual, sub-group, or constituency.
> When followed, this principle encourages those ideas that spring forth from a sincere
> desire to serve, as opposed to ideas that emanate from a desire for personal
> aggrandizement or constituency-building.
   The group strives for unanimity, but a majority vote can be taken to bring about a

> conclusion and make the decision. An important aspect to this principle is the
> understanding that once a decision is made, it is incumbent on the entire group to act on it
> with unity--regardless of how many supported the measure.

In this sense, there can be no "minority" report or "position of the opposition" in consultation.
Rather, Bahá'ís believe that if a decision is a wrong one, it will become evident in its
implementation--but only if the decision-making group and, indeed, the community at large,
support it wholeheartedly.
This commitment to unity ensures that if a decision or a project fails, the problem lies in the idea
itself, and not in lack of support from the community or the obstinate actions of opponents
(Bahá’í International Community, 2011d).

Table 12: Perspective on Reality (Lample, 2009, p. 121)
I see in this table the two sources of knowledge available to humanity; a religious and a scientific
source. Level 1 represents a reality beyond the reach of scientific investigation. I know about this
reality through the religious source of knowledge, represented in the table as R2-4.
(R2) represents the Revelation that can be known, the revealed Word of God; the Book and its
authoritative interpretation. S2 represents the laws of nature, the facts of the physical world, and
the mental and social dimensions of humanity, summarized as “the universe”. These are aspects
of existence that are potentially discoverable by humanity. Human knowledge can be divided into
two levels that are essentially integrated; a level that represents the knowledge system of science
(S3), with a distinct body of knowledge that grows and evolves over time through the application
of accepted methods, and a level that represents the technical or practical knowledge derived from
the application of scientific knowledge or from practice to contribute to an ever-advancing
civilization and which is comparable to religious practice (S4).
The conception of truth varies in relation to each of these levels of comprehension. The truth that
is associated with the essential nature of reality is beyond human capacity to even contemplate
(level 1). Humanity attempts to investigate the truth that corresponds with reality as manifested in
the text of the Revelation (R2) and the physical and human world (S2). Because of the limitations
of human capacity, we cannot achieve this level of understanding. Yet, we also cannot avoid the
implications of the truths of reality. The mutable knowledge that constitutes the horizon of human
comprehension is continually tested against the brute facts of physical reality, through the
understanding and methods of the scientific community (S3), and against the verses of
Revelation, through the understanding and methods of the religious community (R3). Truth, at
this third level, is justified knowledge, and represents humanity’s best insight into the universe
and Revelation (S2 and R2). Such truths are subject to alteration or refinement over time as more
profound understandings that encompass and transcend previous notions emerge through practical
action to shape society (S4 and R4) (Lample, 2009, p. 121).

8\.7 Appendix D: A perspective on history
While a comprehensive theory of history demands the examination of numerous factors and the
description of their operation in various realms of social existence: religious, political, economic,
and cultural, I describe below a general outline that is internally consistent of a perspective of
history in 11 elements, an interpretation able to withstand critical analysis in light of the data
available about humanity’s past. It is my summary from an online course entitled: Specialisation
in Education for Development, Constructing a Conceptual Framework for Social Action
(FUNDAEC, 2010) that I recently completed.
1\. Every created being evolves towards its stage of maturity. As it evolves, it has requirements

> and opportunities for development. Challenges are continuously present throughout this
> process.
2\. Humanity can also be viewed as an organic entity that, in its collective life, undergoes

> evolution towards maturity. Its evolution is not linear but filled with advances, setbacks,
> tragedies and triumphs.
3\. Today, humanity stands at the threshold of maturity. This stage is apparent especially in the

phenomenal expansion of human knowledge.
4\. The distinguishing attribute of this maturity is the unification of the human race. It is an

> organic process and requires a complete reordering of the life of the individual, the life of the
> community, and the structure of society.
5\. The transition to maturity is characterized by the interplay of two sets of forces, constructive

> and destructive. One is responsible for unprecented turmoil in society, while at the same time
> breaking down barriers that hinder the unification of the human race. The other gives rise to a
> new and steadily growing system, founded on the principles of oneness and justice.
6\. There is purpose in the creation of the universe. For the individual it is the development of

> spiritual qualities and perfections, and advancing towards God. Neither idle worship nor a life
> dedicated to the pursuit of worldly desire will help achieve this purpose. Activity in the arena
> of the collective life of humanity, selfless service to society is called for.
7\. To carry forward an ever-advancing civilization is the purpose of the collective life of

> humankind. This civilization has two essential components, material and spiritual, both of
> which need to advance simultaneously if humanity is to achieve prosperity and true
> happiness.
8\. What causes ultimately the advancement of civilization is the progressive education of

> humanity by the Manifestations of God, in accordance to the requirements of the particular
> stage in the development of humanity, expanding the provisions of the previous set of
> teachings.
9\. Science and religion are the two knowledge systems that propel the progress of civilization

> and that are necessary for its proper unfoldment. Science without religion becomes the victim
> of materialism and generates tools of destruction. Religion without the light of science and
> reason degenerates into superstition.

10\. The present age is a period in human history of great regeneration, marked by spiritual vigour.
11\. Purposeful evolutionary processes allow for ample room for the will of the individual and of

> the collectivity. The way knowledge is generated and used influences the outcome. A
> continual battle between the forces of knowledge and blind imitation, between moral courage
> and vain desire goes on at the center stage in the unfolding drama of history.

8\.10 Appendix G: Government minister praises Baha'i contribution to

Luxembourg
24 July 2011
LUXEMBOURG CITY, Luxembourg — The Luxembourg Baha'i community's
involvement in society has been praised by a high-ranking government minister on a
special visit to the national Baha'i centre.
Minister of Finance Luc Frieden made his remarks at a celebration marking National Day,
the official birthday of His Royal Highness Henri, Grand-Duke of Luxembourg.
Citing the importance of the values of tolerance and unity, the minister expressed the
government's gratitude to the Baha'is for their commitment to the life of the country.
"The value of a religious community, or any other organization, should be a reflection of
the contribution it makes towards the development of society," said Mr Frieden.
To that end, Mr Frieden spoke of the importance of people being involved in the
community in which they live, "looking more to the common good and the effects of their
actions on others."
Amir Saberin, the chair of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Luxembourg
described the occasion as "very historic and significant for us."
"For the first time, Mr Frieden came in order to show the government's appreciation and
recognition of the work of the Baha'i community," said Dr. Saberin.
"He wanted to know what we are doing practically. We talked about education and how
we are particularly trying to be involved with our fellow citizens to give responsibility to,
and develop the potential of, young people."
Dr. Saberin also mentioned the situation in Iran today where young Baha'is are barred
from entering university, and their subsequent efforts to continue their education are
branded as illegal.
In response, Mr Frieden expressed his support for an increased focus on education,
mutual respect and the "fundamental values inherent to all civilization."
The minister was accompanied at the event – which took place on 21 June – by two
deputies of the Luxembourgish Parliament, Martine Stein-Mergen and Fernand Kartheiser
(Bahá’í World News Service, 2011)

8\.12 Appendix I: Description of the data collected, in chronological order
I have collected between December 2010 and July 2011 the following excerpts:

1. INT01: Interview 1 - 12.10.2010

I interviewed the tutor at her home before the start of the study course, and asked her a
number of questions, videotaped and archived under folder: dataset 1.

2. WQ01: Written questionnaire 1 - 25.01.2011

I asked the tutor to take a moment at the start of session 1, at the home of Anne and
Romain, so that the participants could fill out the following short questionnaire. Four
sheets of paper were collected from the four participants, three were written in French and
one in Portuguese. I have collected the texts, transcribed and translated them. They are
archived under folder: dataset 2.

3. S1E1: Session 1, 1 - 25.01.

I had requested that the tutor videotapes the sessions. The first session started as the
participants greet me through the camera that stands at the corner of the living-room.
Participants sit around a small coffee table on a canapé and a sofa. Romain and Anne, the
hosts, share one course material.
At the very start of session 1, just after 9 minutes, Anne is commenting on a sentence that
they had just read in the text, in section 1, page 7 of the curriculum, where participants are
asked to decide whether a number of statements are true or false. The second question
states: Lorsque nous enseignons les enfants, nous adorons Dieu. vrai  faux. Before
line 1 of the transcript, the tutor asks the participants whether they have any reflexions or
questions.

4. S1E2: Session 1, 2 – 25.01.

Session 1 was videotaped by the tutor at the home of the participants Romain and Anne.
Four participants were present: Romain, Anne, Hamed, and Josefa. Session 1 is archived
under folder: dataset 3.
This passage takes place immediately after Hamed has read section 4, page 9 in the
curriculum. Section 4 reads as follows:
Now, memorize the above words of Bahá'u'lláh, [Regard man as a mine rich in gems of
inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to
benefit therefrom.] and think about the following questions: What are some of the gems that we
possess? Can we consider the virtues latent within us, such as love and kindness, justice,
truthfulness, constancy, integrity, and sincerity, as some of these gems? What do you think about
the capacities of the human mind, its powers to discover the world of nature, to produce beautiful
works of art, to express beautiful and noble thoughts? And what would happen without true
education? Could we show forth all of those treasures which God has conferred upon us? Consult
about these ideas with the participants in your group (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 9).

N0: Note 0, 26.01.
I received this note from Romain with the initial answers to the questionnaire at the start
of session 1. At that time, I had already shared some initial thoughts about my research
with the participants.

5. S2E1: Session 2, 1 - 02.02.

Session 2 was videotaped by the tutor at the home of the participants Romain and Anne.
Participants present: Romain, Anne, Hamed; absent: Josefa; two new participants joined:
Pia, and Francine. Session 2 is archived under folder: dataset 4.
This is a passage from Section 9 in the curriculum, stating that “ to succeed in teaching
heavenly virtues to children, you must sow the seeds of love for God and fear of God in the pure
soil of their hearts”, and that “they should learn that we were created out of the infinite love God
has for His creatures, and that we are continually protected and nurtured by this love” (Ruhi
Institute, 1995, p. 13). The tutor then starts a discussion by stating how the concept of the
fear of God is a difficult one. Others share their understanding and the tutor mentions how
the German translation of the word fear may be helpful in understanding the concept. A
discussion follows.

6. N1: Note 1 – 17.3.

When I picked up the video tape from the tutor on 17.3.2011 and I asked her how the
course came along she gave me this update:
a. Anne will stop attending the class, had already worries with book 1, but for the 3 rd

session had planed something else. This info comes from Romain, her husband.

b. Pia had to stop attending, due to other commitments.
c. Francine and Josefa are still attending, but have to be reminded to come.

7. INTS3: Interview before Session 3, 19.3.

This is the very start of session 3. Hamed, Romain and the tutor are present. The greetings
to me, while not present physically but through the camera are followed by the questions
that the tutor is asking the participants, upon my request, about the influence the course
might have on them in their daily lives. This is videotaped and archived under folder:
dataset 5.

S3E1: Session 3, 1 – 19.3.
Analogy as a tool for explaining
This is an instance where the tutor shares an analogy with the participants. Hamed has
read section 13, point K. Page 21. The curriculum presents in this section a number of
situations that could easily occur in the children’s classes. Participants are asked to apply
the principles that they have learned thus far in order to resolve them. Fifteen situations
are given with three or four possibilities or other possibilities to be completed by the
participants. Here is the text from the curriculum that Hamed has just read:

> K. One little girl has problems learning in a group. She sits alone in a corner, playing, and
> does not pay attention in class. The teacher notices that the child does not understand
things as well as others. What can the teacher do?

> 1. Call her back to the group and tell her that by paying more attention she will
> understand things better.
> 2. Punish her for being naughty.
> 3. Have her leave the class because, with 20 other students in the class who want
> to progress, the teacher does not have time to spend with a child who is always
> behind.
> 4. Since she is not interrupting the class, let her do what she wants; while others
> are working on individual projects, dedicate special time to her.
8. S4E1: Session 4, 1 – 29.3.

Session 4 was videotaped by the tutor at the home of the participants Romain and Anne.
Participants present: Romain, Anne, Hamed; absent: Josefa. Session 4 is archived under
folder: dataset 6.
Stories as a tool for learning - Stories too difficult
This passage is taken from session 4, where the group is starting the 2nd part of the
curriculum: learn to teach simple children’s classes, consisting of memorization of
prayers and quotations, songs, stories, games and colouring. The tutor comments on the
15 stories for children in the curriculum. Section 5 starts with a text that encourages
participants to carry out the activity of storytelling. After having read the text, three
questions were asked in the course: why are stories important in a child’s education? Who
is 'Abdu'l-Bahá? Why is it important to learn stories about the life of 'Abdu'l-Bahá? Then
the tutor starts by asking the participants what they have to say on the subject of
storytelling.

9. S4E2: Session 4, 2 – 29.3.

Memorization as a tool for learning

Romain makes a comment about this during session 4.

10. S4E3: Session 4, 3 – 29.3.

Memorization as a tool for learning
The tutor remembers that Hamed, one of the participants made a comment about the
concept of repetition, who said that “repetition is the mother of knowledge”.

11. S4E4: Session 4, 4 – 29.3.

Humour - Chanting as a tool for memorization
In session 4, section 4 page 27, Anne has just read the passage that encourages
participants to sing spiritual songs with the children which fill their hearts with happiness.
The text includes a quotation by 'Abdu'l-Bahá:
The art of music is divine and effective. It is the food of the soul and spirit. Through the power
and charm of music the spirit of man is uplifted. It has wonderful sway and effect in the hearts of
children, for their hearts are pure, and melodies have great influence in them. The latent talents
with which the hearts of these children are endowed will find expression through the medium of
music.
The curriculum goes on to suggest that participants learn the songs of the 15 lessons of
this unit well, either from the tutor or with the help of a cassette.

12. N2: Note 2, 16.4.

Regarding the subject of attendance, I had asked the tutor by email on the 16.4.2011
whether she knew who would come to session 5 on 26.4.2011 apart from Anne and
Romain, she replied a day later, saying:

13. S5E1: Session 5, 1 - 26.4.

Session 5 was videotaped by the tutor at the home of the participants Romain and Anne.
Participants present: Romain, Anne, Hamed, Josefa. Session 5 is archived under folder:
dataset 7.
Participants greet the researcher – Tutor gives summary of last session to Josefa
Tutor starts the session 5 by whispering to the group to greet the researcher. The tutor
gives a brief summary of the last session to Josefa, who was absent. The excerpt precedes
the reading of section 9, page 32, on the topic of the games presented in the 15 lessons for
children.

14. S5E2: Session 5, 2 - 26.4.

I interviewed the tutor and the 4 participants after session 5. This is audiotaped and
archived under folder: dataset 7.

Playing games - Instance of remembering something a participant said regarding
repetition and memorization
Section 12, page 33 stresses the importance that children experience a sense of success
and that the role of the teacher is very important in achieving this. Participants are asked
to consult on these questions:

> 1.    How does a teacher contribute to the children’s sense of success?
> 2.    Which actions of a teacher contribute to the children’s sense of failure?

15. INTS5E0: Interview after Session 5, 0 – 26.4.

Instance where two participants express their interest in the research I conduct with the
study circle.

16. INTS5E1: Interview after Session 5, 1 - 26.4.

Interview about development
After session 5, I joined the group to give them a brief update on my theoretical ideas for
the master thesis. I then asked them their own development after 5 sessions of learning
together. I did this in the group through an audio recording.

17. INTS5E2: Interview after Session 5, 2 - 26.4.

Historicity, at the start of expansive learning
During my interview with the group I had commented on my observations that not all of
the tools for learning, suggested in the curriculum were used. This started the discussion
below.

18. WQS6E1: Written Questionnaire after Session 6, 1 - 5.7.

Upon my request, the tutor gave the participants a short written questionnaire after
session 6 to fill out. The tutor however did not fill out the questionnaire. This is archived
under folder: dataset 8.
The participants had completed 6 sessions and only 1 session remained. I decided to ask
them note down their thoughts on the following two questions: one thing they had learned
and what they will do now. The tutor had answered the questions.

19. WQS6E2: Written Questionnaire after Session 6, 2 - 5.7.

When the tutor gave me the completed questionnaire on 22.7.2011, she had not answered
the questions. I asked her to send them to me by mail. I received her comments on
27\.7.2011. This is archived under folder: dataset 8.

Longwy en France. Depuis 1998 il enseigne au Luxembourg où il s’est spécialisé dans
l’apprentissage de la langue luxembourgeoise.
Dans le cadre du Projet MOIEN, (projet de formation, élaboré en 1996 à la suite d’une demande
du Conseil National pour Etrangers qui vise à favoriser l’apprentissage de la langue
luxembourgeoise par les étrangers ayant accès au marché du travail luxembourgeois) Mr Nau a
participé aux formations de formateurs et a contribué en tant que formateur au succès de ce projet.
Parmi les nombreuses formations, on retrouve :

> -   L’approche communicative basée sur la méthode structuro-globale audio-visuelle
> -   L’approche simulation globale
> -   L’audit linguistique
> -   L’évaluation des compétences
> -   L’ingénierie pédagogique
> -   La nouvelle orthographe luxembourgeoise
> -   La suggestopédie
> -   Les compétences de communication à l’oral
> -   L’évaluation des compétences
> -   La gestion de groupes hétérogènes
> -   Les compétences de communications (compréhension écrite et expression orale)
> -   Lëtzebuergesch Phonetik

Il a également participé aux formations en didactique de la langue luxembourgeoise pour adultes,
organisées par le Ministère de l’éducation nationale, de la formation professionnelle et des sports,
ainsi que la formation : Le cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues et portfolio des
langues.
Mr Nau utilise dans ses cours de langues des méthodes innovatrices comme l’apprentissage à
travers les jeux et les chansons. L’accent est mis sur la compréhension et l’expression orale, ainsi
que l’histoire et la culture du Luxembourg à travers des visites de musées et d’institutions
culturelles et publiques. Mr Nau est également guide touristique officiel de la Ville de
Luxembourg.
Au cours de ces onze dernières années, Mr Nau a pu former plus que 1800 apprenants de langue
luxembourgeoise, dans diverses structures et centres de formation. (Centre de Langues,
Luxembourg www.cll.lu ; Communes de Walferdange www.walfer.lu, Steinsel www.steinsel.lu ,

www.zarabina.lu .
12 à 15 participants, venant de différents pays, ayant des origines, des cultures, des croyances
variées, forment le noyau d’une classe typique. C’est cette richesse culturelle que Mr Nau utilise
et qu’il met au service de l’apprentissage de la langue luxembourgeoise. Une pédagogie qui est
basée sur la curiosité naturelle et spontanée de tout être humain, son désir et sa volonté de
communiquer.
Une partie du cours vise à responsabiliser l’apprenant en lui offrant une large de gamme de
stratégies à sa disposition afin de lui permettre d’atteindre son but : comprendre et parler le
luxembourgeois. A cette fin sont mis à sa disposition touts les outils pédagogiques existants,
comme l’utilisation des nouvelles technologies et des médias sociaux. (www.elearning.lu , site
d’introduction à l’apprentissage du luxembourgeois ; www.eurotalk.com , logiciel interactif d’apprentissage

Nouveaux horizons
Depuis 2009, Mr Nau s’est engagé dans une nouvelle expérience, en commençant avec
l’étude du Master multi-LEARN, Learning & development in multilingual and
multicultural contexts, à l’université du Luxembourg. Ce programme innovateur et
interdisciplinaire lui a permis d’explorer des processus d’apprentissage divers. Mr Nau
souhaite poursuivre ses recherches en explorant davantage les processus d’apprentissage
qui promeuvent la cohésion sociale et d’équité en matière d’éducation.

Cultural-historical activity theory perspective on individual and social transformation

Zusammenfassung

Diese Masterarbeit erfasst mit Hilfe der kulturell-historischen Aktivitätstheorie
Lernprozesse einer Probandengruppe und untersucht individuelle und gruppenspezifische
Veränderungen.      Erkenntnisse      werden      gewonnen,       wie    Lernen      während     der
Gruppenaktivität stattfindet, wie die Vielstimmigkeit der Teilnehmer den Lernprozess
beeinflusst, welche Instrumente die Teilnehmer verwenden und inwiefern diese
Hilfsmittel ihr Lernen bestimmen.
Die Probandengruppe besteht aus fünf Teilnehmern, die an einem Kurs zur Vermittlung
moralischer und spiritueller Werte für fünf- bis achtjährige Kinder teilnehmen. Die
gesammelten Daten enthalten fünf Viedeoaufzeichnungen der Studiensitzungen sowie
Interviews, schriftliche Fragen, Notizen und eine Reihe von Dokumenten, darunter auch
Originaltexte wesentlicher Autoren und Institutionen der Bahai-Gemeinschaft, aber auch
anderer Autoren und Bahai-naher Organisationen.
Die Aktivitätstheorie dient der Studie als Rahmen, wobei die Daten mit Hilfe der
Diskursanalyse      untersucht    werden.      Die     Aktivitätstheorie     besagt,     dass    eine
gemeinschaftliche Aktivität von Menschen durchgeführt wird, die von einem
gemeinsamen Ziel und Ergebnis geleitet werden und dazu angemessene Hilfsmittel
verwenden, eingeschränkt und beeinflusst durch kulturelle Werte                 in einem sozialen
Umfeld.
Wenn wir kommunizieren, streben wir Klarheit an, sind aber immer in einen historischen
Kontext eingebunden und was wir sagen, wird durch unsere Vielstimmigkeit beeinflusst.
Die Diskursanalyse untersucht, was Leute gesagt und geschrieben haben und befasst sich
mit der Bedeutung und Interpretation dieser Äußerungen (Gee, 2005).
Die Studie zeigt:
-   wie Teilnehmer mit vom Lernmaterial vorgegebenen Instrumenten kritisch

> umgehen und schlägt vor, dass die Teilnehmer eines gemeinschaftlichen
> Lernprozesses sich auf ihre Ziele und Ergebnisse fokussieren, um so selbst
> geeignete Werkzeuge zu wählen, zu definieren und sich anzueignen.

-   wie Teilnehmer ihre Vielstimmigkeit und Historizität in die Tätigkeit einbringen.

> Die meisten dieser Stimmen helfen den Teilnehmern, ihre Ziele und Ergebnisse zu

-   wie   Lernen durch ein komplexes              Zusammenspiel aller           Elemente   im

> Historizität und Vielstimmigkeit mit einbringen, beeinflussen sie die Lernaktivität,
> und auf diese Weise entsteht eine gegenseitige Beeinflussung zwischen
> Teilnehmern und Lernaktivität.

Die Studie legt nahe, dass die Existenz und gezielte Erzeugung von Bedingungen, wie
gegenseitiges Zuhören und Vertrauen, Einheit, eine einladende und ermutigende Haltung,
Humor und eigenverantwortliches Lernen, zwischen den Teilnehmern in einer
Lernaktivität den Lernprozess beeinflussen.

Cultural-historical activity theory perspective on individual and social transformation

Résumé

Le but de cette étude est d'explorer, à l’aide de la théorie de l'activité culturelle et
historique, les processus d'apprentissage d'un groupe d'études collaboratif, engagé sur une
voie de transformation individuelle et sociale. L'objectif est de mieux comprendre
comment l'apprentissage se déroule pendant l'activité, comment les participants
s’exprimant en leur nom ou donnant voix à d’autres, influencent le processus
d'apprentissage, quels outils les participants utilisent dans le cadre de l'activité, et
comment ces outils les guident dans leur apprentissage.
L'unité d'analyse consiste en un groupe de cinq participants qui commencent une
formation pour développer la capacité d’offrir aux enfants, âgés de cinq à huit ans, un
cours d’éducation aux valeurs morales et spirituelles. Les données ont été recueillies au
cours de cinq sessions menées par le groupe et comprennent des enregistrements vidéo et
des interviews, des questionnaires écrits, des notes et un certain nombre de documents,
dont de la littérature primaire c’est-à-dire issue des figures centrales de la Foi Bahá’íe,
des textes écrits ou commandités par les institutions de la communauté bahá'íe, ou par des
organisations d’inspiration bahá’íe ou enfin des textes d’auteurs bahá’ís. Chaque session
durait en moyenne deux heures et entre la première session et le questionnaire écrit, fait
après la sixième session, cinq mois s’étaient déroulés. 21 extraits choisis sont analysés en
profondeur.
Cette étude est basée sur le cadre conceptuel culturel-historique de l’apprentissage et du
développement et le concept de l’apprentissage est appliqué au niveau individuel et
social. La théorie de l'activité sert de cadre à cette étude, tandis que celle de l'analyse du
discours est utilisée pour analyser les données recueillies. Selon la théorie de l'activité,
une activité collective, dont l'objectif de base est partagé par d’autres, est menée par des
personnes qui trouvent leur motivation dans le partage d’un même but ou la recherche de
la solution à un même problème. Des outils servent de médiateur à l’activité et sont
utilisés dans le but de parvenir à un résultat. L’étude fait référence à des approches
d’acquisition et de participation et leur interconnectivité.
Quand nous communiquons, même si nous nous efforçons d’être clairs, nous sommes
toujours situés dans un contexte historique et donc, ce que nous disons est influencé par
notre « multivoicedness », le fait que nous soyons des porteurs de paroles multiples.

Exploring learning processes within a collaborative study circle

Réfléchir sur ce que les gens ont dit et écrit, et ainsi en découvrir des significations et
interprétations possibles, est à la base de l'analyse du discours (Gee, 2005).
Le sujet de l’étude ouvre une fenêtre sur des processus dans des communautés
d’apprentissage au-delà de l’éducation scolaire. L’analyse au niveau micro se réfère à des
énoncés individuels et à des conversations en commun. L'étude montre que les
participants ont négocié les outils contenus dans le programme d'étude. Cela laisse
penser que les participants impliqués dans une activité d'apprentissage collaboratif
focalisent sur leurs objectifs et leurs résultats, et donc choisissent, définissent par eux-
mêmes et s’approprient les outils les plus adaptés. Dans ce travail, on voit comment les
participants ont apporté dans l'activité leur façon d’être porteurs de paroles multiples
(multivoicedness) et leur historicité. La plupart de ces différentes voix portées ont aidé les
participants à atteindre leur objectif et les résultats escomptés. Je suggère que les
participants, engagés dans des activités d'apprentissage, deviennent davantage conscients
que ces voix multiples dont ils sont porteurs (multivoicedness) les influencent dans leur
processus d’apprentissage. L'étude s’attache à relever la façon dont l'apprentissage se fait
à travers une interaction complexe entre tous les éléments dans le système de l'activité.
Le cercle d'études observé est au début de son historicité. Les cercles d'études sont en
développement avec leur propre historicité dans différents contextes et cultures, et
influencent la façon dont les participants apprennent. De même, les participants apportent
leur historicité et multivoicedness, et ainsi, ils influencent l'activité d'apprentissage. De
cette façon, il y a interdépendance et influence mutuelle entre les participants et l'activité
d'apprentissage.
L'étude suggère que l'existence et la création délibérée de certaines conditions parmi les
participants à une activité d'apprentissage influencent le processus d'apprentissage. Ces
conditions comprennent la confiance mutuelle, l'honnêteté, l'unité, une attitude
accueillante et encourageante, un respect pour l'opinion des autres, une attitude humble
d'apprentissage, l'humour, et l'appropriation personnelle de son apprentissage.

Mots-clés: théorie de l'activité culturelle et historique, les outils de médiation, processus
d’apprentissage, développement, historicité, multivoicedness.

Cultural-historical activity theory perspective on individual and social transformation

Abstract

Aims and objectives
The purpose of this study is to explore learning processes of a collaborative study group,
engaged on a path of individual and social transformation, with the perspective of
cultural-historical activity theory. The topic opens up a window on processes in learning
communities beyond school-related education. The objective is to gain insights how
learning takes place in the activity, what the tools are that the participants use in the
activity, how these tools guide their learning, and how the participants’ multivoicedness
influences the learning process,.
Research as a process
Scientific method is a truth seeking exercise, is interpretive, and any researcher needs to
be clear about the basic set of beliefs that guides his action, his interpretive framework,
and the network that contains his (1) ontological (the kind of human being we are; the
nature of our reality), (2) epistemological (the relationship between the inquirer and the
known, the observer and the observed), and (3) methodological premises (how we know
the world or gain knowledge of it).
(1) To consider man as a noble being, as mine rich in gems which education can bring
out, is a core element of a conceptual framework that governs every educational activity,
and stands at the centre of the empirical data I have observed. Bahá’í texts state that the
crucial need facing humanity today is to find a unifying vision of the nature and purpose
of life and of the future of society. The object of the Bahá’í Faith is to effect a
transformation in the whole character of mankind. Every human being has a two-fold
moral purpose; to develop their latent potentialities through efforts to contribute to the
advancement of civilization (Institute for Global Prosperity, 2012).
(2 & 3) Our culture(s), our language(s), our belief(s), our institutions and educational
systems influence our understanding. They are products of the human mind. Social reality
mediates our engagement with the world, and we have the capacity to create anew this
reality. I advance on a path of learning that reduces ambiguity, where the mind does have
access to reliable knowledge. The nonfoundational approach to knowledge recognizes the
legitimacy of different points of view and the limitations on certainty, but unlike a
relativistic approach, permits judgments about inadequacy or error. Human capacity for

Exploring learning processes within a collaborative study circle

comprehending reality is circumscribed, but the mind does have access to reliable
knowledge. We learn to live with uncertainty, and without epistemological guarantees, we
act and strive to reduce ambiguity. This research presents a modest contribution to
explore a tiny facet and fragment of social reality, and is not a description of the world as
it is. The study represents one perspective on social reality, a reality that is whole.
I take the teleological stand that history is not just a series of events, but develops.
Humanity as an organic entity evolves, in its collective life, towards maturity. Humanity
stands today at the threshold of maturity and the distinguishing attribute of this maturity is
the unification of the human race. My belief in the oneness of humankind stands at the
center of a conception of existence within which the nature of the fundamental processes
and structures of the collective life on the planet are defined.
Participants and research instruments
The unit of analysis consists of a group of five participants who start a course on how to
provide children, aged five to eight, moral, spiritual, and values-based training. The data
collected includes five video-recorded group sessions and interviews, written
questionnaires, notes, and a number of documents, which include primary texts, written
by the central authors and institutions of the Bahá’í community, by individuals or Bahá’í
inspired organisations. Each of the five video-recorded sessions lasted on average two
hours, and there was a lapse of five months between the first study session and the last
written questionnaire, carried out after session six. 21 excerpts chosen are analysed in
depth.
The research is founded on the framework of the cultural-historical school of learning and
development, which is referred to during the analysis of the interactional data. The
concept of learning is applied to the individual and social plane. The analysis at the
micro-level is referring to individual utterances and joint conversations. References are
made to acquisition and participation approaches and their interconnectedness.
I use activity theory to frame the analysis and discourse analysis to analyze the data.
Activity theory states, that a collective activity, with the basic purpose shared by others, is
undertaken by people who are motivated by a purpose or towards the solution of a
problem, which is mediated by tools, used in order to achieve an outcome.
When we communicate, we may strive for clarity, but we are always situated in an
historical context and what we say is influenced by our multivoicedness. Reflecting on

Cultural-historical activity theory perspective on individual and social transformation

what people have said and written, and thereby discovering meaning and interpretation is
the basis of discourse analysis (Gee, 2005).
Findings & Implications
The study shows how learning takes place through a complex interaction between all of
the elements in the activity system. Nine distinct instances offer insights that this
particular type of collaborative activity encourages and promotes the exchange of
questions, ideas, experiences, thoughts and knowledge among participants:

> 1. ideas bounce and comments resonate with other participants
> 2. cultural differences meet in a collaborative activity through value negotiation
> 3. a known concept connects to a new context of having to raise children
4. the object of learning is considered a positive source, spread out worldwide for the

first time
> 5. learning develops through comparison and identity develops
> 6. an research interest is shown in what participants do and how they do it
> 7. the activity undertaken is value-oriented
> 8. participants negotiate the suggested learning tools, mediation is present
> 9. the tutor shares experiences and skills
The study shows that participants negotiate tools given by the content-based curriculum
and suggests that participants in a collaborative learning activity focus on their objectives
and outcome, and thus choose, define and appropriate themselves suitable tools. The
following mediating artefacts, tools and signs were used by the participants and shaped
their learning:

> -   three languages (French, Luxembourgish, and German)
> -   the curriculum and the negotiation of the tools provided
> -   writing
> -   participants’ cultural-historical background and the tools they added to the activity
The study circle observed is at the beginning of its historicity. Study circles are
developing with their own historicity in different contexts and cultures, and on the one,
influence the way participants learn. On the other hand, as participants bring in their
historicity and multivoicedness, they influence the learning activity. In this way, there is
interconnectedness and mutual influence between participants and the learning activity.

The study shows how participants bring into the activity their multivoicedness and
historicity. Most of these voices help the participants towards reaching their objective and
outcome.
In the analysis of the 21 excerpts, I identified 32 voices that participants bring into the
activity, collected into seven interacting and overlapping categories:
-   voices that are in the name of everyone, or for everyone, when we see ourselves

collectively
> -   voices of those we care for and love
-   voices of those that are keen to learn and curious to find out more about human

existence
-   voices of someone that takes part in an activity, someone that shares his skills,

someone willing to contribute as best as possible.
-   voices of someone with certain qualities, skills and values that transmit and

portray certain qualities
> -   voices of those that endure physical hardship and are close to nature
> -   voices of those not satisfied by certain learning tools
I suggest that participants, engaged in collaborative learning activities, raise their
awareness that their multivoicedness influences their learning.
The study suggests that the existence and deliberate creation of certain conditions among
participants in a learning activity influence the learning process. They include mutual
trust, honesty, unity, a welcoming and encouraging attitude, a respect for the opinion of
others, adopting a humble learning attitude, humour, and taking ownership of one’s
learning.
In a further research step, the challenge of expansive learning, that is, transforming the
context of the learning activity through joint achievement can be analysed and achieved
through an interventionist approach. Additionally, a more distant stance towards the
processes in the collaborative study circle can be taken through a meta-level analysis,
facilitated by the cultural-historical activity theory framework.

Keywords: cultural-historical activity theory, mediating artefacts, learning, development,
historicity, multivoicedness.

1 CHAPTER ONE: MY RESEARCH AS A PROCESS
Hardly a day goes by where I do not learn something new; discover a new way of doing
something. Over the last two years, I have been engaged in a process of learning about
qualitative research. I have made progress and my thoughts have developed towards a
more holistic view of the world, although I am aware that my perspective of the world
can only be fragmentary and incomplete. Qualitative research informs us that there is no
such thing as objective observation.
Scientific method is in the business of truth seeking. The researcher should be clear about
the basic set of beliefs that guides his action, his paradigm, or interpretative framework,
the network that         contains the researchers’          epistemological,      ontological,    and
methodological premises (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003, p. 29). This is also true for the
participants observed during the research. They hold a set of beliefs that guide their action
and influence their learning. For Denzin and Lincoln (2003), qualitative researchers
believe that rich descriptions of the social world are valuable; that the field of qualitative
research is characterized by an embarrassment of choices; that researchers have never
before had so many paradigms, strategies of inquiry, and methods of analysis to draw
upon and utilize; that the qualitative research act can no longer be viewed from within a
neutral or objective positivist perspective, that “class, race, gender, and ethnicity shape
inquiry, making research a multicultural process” (2003, p. 29), and that the present is a
politically charged space.
As a researcher and explorer of learning processes, these statements are relevant.
Qualitative research is described as a process that involves three interconnected, generic
activities:

> The gendered, multiculturally situated researcher approaches the world with a set
> of ideas, a framework (theory, ontology) [1] that specifies a set of questions
> (epistemology) [2] that he or she then examines in specific ways (methodology,
> analysis) [3]. [He] collects empirical materials bearing on the question and then
> analyzes and writes about those materials (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003, p. 29–30).
> [...] No single method can grasp all the subtle variations in ongoing human
> experience. Consequently, qualitative researchers deploy a wide range of
> interconnected interpretive methods; always seeking better ways to make more
> understandable the worlds of experience they have studied (Denzin & Lincoln,
> 2003, p. 31).

While it may be so that there “is no clear window into the inner life of an individual”
(Denzin & Lincoln, 2005, p. 1–32), this study tries to look at the activity of participants
engaged in a course as the unit of analysis.
1\.1 The Researcher as a Multicultural Subject

> Culture, language, beliefs, institutions, educational systems—all are real, all have
> an impact on our understanding, but are all products of the human mind. Social
> reality mediates our engagement with the world, physical and spiritual, and it is
> this reality that we have the capacity to create anew (Lample, 2009, p. 7).

My current view of the world has been inspired by the writings of Bahá'u'lláh (1817-
1892). “Let your vision be world embracing […]. Be anxiously concerned with the needs
of the age you live in, and center your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.
The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens” (Bahá’u’lláh, 1983, p. 97,213).
Science and religion ought to develop harmoniously, as they constitute the two sources of
knowledge available to humankind. I have seized the opportunity to learn more about
how ‘scientific knowledge’ can help advancing civilization in a way that is in agreement
with my view of the world.
World peace is the crying need of our time. The crucial need facing humanity today is to
find a unifying vision of the nature and purpose of life and of the future of society. Such a
vision unfolds in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh.
This study looks at aspects of learning in a group of individuals “who wish to undertake
the highly meritorious service of teaching regular classes for the spiritual education of
children” (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 1).
The statement that considers man as a mine rich in gems which education can bring out.
(Bahá’u’lláh, 1983) is a core element of a conceptual framework that governs every
educational activity, and stands at the centre of the empirical data I have observed; four
participants that are engaged with a tutor in a ‘collaborative study’ of a curriculum
applied in virtually every corner of the world, called: Teaching Children’s Classes, Grade

\[1\] These concepts have been part of my life over the last 25 years, having lived in Israel and
Northern Ireland for over 11 years, and being in close contact with the Persian and Arabic
culture for over 20 years.

Worldviews: the world as an organic whole or the world as a jungle?
What motivates me to keep on learning is my perspective to view the world as an organic
whole, much like that of a human body where the different parts are connected to form a
whole, rather than as a jungle, where the strongest, the most powerful wins. This leads me
to the assumption that humanity has the responsibility to care for this organic whole.
Recognizing this however does not represent an influence able to establish in the
consciousness of people a new system of values. A “breakthrough in understanding that is
scientific and spiritual [...] will empower the human race to assume the trusteeship toward
which history impels it” (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 98). I have outlined below my perspective
on reality and how history is not only a series of happenings, but a process of
development.
Perspective on reality
I take a Bahá’í view of the harmony between science and religion by drawing parallels
between physical and spiritual reality. The table I provide in the Appendixes: Appendix
C: A perspective on reality considered overly reductionistic by the author (Lample, 2009)
gives certain insights that emerge from a comparison of the levels of comprehending
reality. Lample proposes four levels in order to distinguish between the levels of
theoretical and practical knowledge.
Telos
I take the teleological view that “history is not only a series of happenings, but rather is in
a process of development” (Tuomi, 2001, p. 37). I view humanity as an organic entity
that, in its collective life, undergoes evolution towards maturity. Today, humanity stands
at the threshold of maturity and the distinguishing attribute of this maturity is the
unification of the human race. My belief in the oneness of humankind stands at the center
of a conception of existence within which the nature of the fundamental processes and
structures of the collective life on the planet are defined. I have included a summary of a
perspective on history in the Appendixes: Appendix D: A perspective on history.
Nonfoundationalism as an alternative to foundationalist or relativist views
Seeking to advance on a path of learning that reduces ambiguity, where the mind does
have access to reliable knowledge, I am aware that my understanding is influenced by
circumstances and factors such as language, time, space and the people that I live with. A
nonfoundational approach to knowledge, as Lample (2009, p. 178) states, “recognizes the

legitimacy of different points of view and the limitations on certainty”, but unlike a
relativistic approach, “it permits judgments about inadequacy or error”. While Bahá’í
teachings indicate that human capacity for comprehending reality is circumscribed, they
also make it clear that the mind does have access to reliable knowledge. Schwandt (1996)
in (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005, p. 922) states: “We must learn to live with uncertainty, with
the absence of final vindications, without the hope of solutions in the form of
epistemological guarantees. Contingency, fallibilism, dialogue, and deliberation mark our
way of being in the world. [...] these ontological conditions are not equivalent to eternal
ambiguity, the lack of commitment, [and] the inability to act in the face of uncertainty”.
Wholeness rather than fragmentation
When I observe human activity, I am convinced that I make statements that describe a
tiny fragment of social reality. Bohm (1996, p. 7) states that this “fragmentation is
continually being brought about by the almost universal habit of taking the content of our
thought for a ‘description of the world as it is’”, and that “it is just because reality is
whole that man, with his fragmentary approach, will inevitably be answered with a
correspondingly fragmentary response”. As a researcher, I need to give attention to this
habit of fragmentary thought, I need to be aware of it, and thus bring it to an end. My
approach to reality may then be whole, and so my response will be whole.
1\.2 Main idea about this research
As a member of the Bahá’í Faith and a researcher, I need to take a critical look at my
religion. Bahá’ís believe that the crucial need facing humanity is to find a unifying vision
of the nature of human being, the purpose of life and of the future of society. Such a
vision unfolds in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá’í Faith (Bahá’í
International Community, 2010). Furthermore, the object of the Bahá’í Faith is to “to
effect a transformation in the whole character of mankind, a transformation that shall
manifest itself both outwardly and inwardly“(see Appendixes: document 4). Education is
regarded as a powerful tool to achieve this object. Thus, at the heart of the Revelation of
Bahá'u'lláh is the force of transformation, both of the individual and of society. The
individual is encouraged to start a process “tied to the centering of one’s energies on the
betterment of humankind and serving the needs of the community and the larger society.
[...] Thus, Bahá'ís are actively engaged in developing knowledge, skills, and spiritual

insights that enable them to act as effective human resources and which are vital to the
integrated process of personal and social transformation.
Presently, such collective learning takes the form of study circles—a local, collaborative,
self-directed learning process being undertaken by Bahá’í communities around the world.
All are welcome in the classes, regardless of their ideas or beliefs. [...] Participants in the
courses learn, for example, to teach values to children, to engage in community service
activities, to assist and empower others to independently investigate spiritual truths, to
learn how to competently express one’s views, and to engage themselves in serving the
broader needs of society for unity, justice, and equity. Participants in study circles often
experience a new sense of direction in life, better relationships with family and friends,
and a fruitful re-evaluation of the contribution one can make to the wider community”
(Bahá’í International Community, 2011a); see also Appendix K: Sequence of courses:
purpose and practice elements.
1\.2.1 Learning as an issue: learning, consultation and participation
Wenger outlines the social perspective on learning in twelve principles: learning is
inherent in human nature; it is first and foremost the ability to negotiate new meaning, it
creates emergent structures, it is fundamentally experiential and fundamentally social, it
transforms our identities, it constitutes trajectories of participation, it means dealing with
boundaries, it is a matter of social energy and power, it is a matter of engagement, it is a
matter of imagination, it is a matter of alignment and it involves an interplay between the
local and the global (Wenger, 1999, p. 226–8).
Learning that attempts to bring about social change needs to include the following four
elements: study, action, reflection on action and consultation.              They are interacting
components, intertwined and interconnected (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 132).
The term consultation that I use in this context and throughout the study is a distinctive
method of non-adversarial decision-making, a procedure for building consensus and
investigating truth, and a vital instrument for social criticism. The administrative bodies
of the Bahá’í Faith at all levels learn to apply this method and it is suitable for individuals
and groups to use (Appendix B: Consultation).
Wenger (1999, p. 55) uses the term participation “to describe the social experience of
living in the world in terms of membership in social communities and active involvement

in social enterprises”. This study looks at participants engaged in “collective learning
[that] takes the form of study circles – a local, collaborative, self-directed learning
process being undertaken by Bahá’í communities around the world. All are welcome in
the classes, regardless of their ideas or beliefs” (Baha’i International Community, 2011).
I have chosen to observe a group of participants engaged in a content-based course that
provides them with skills and abilities to teach children’s classes.
1\.3 Research questions – significance of the study
In order to gain more insights as to how participants learn to bring about individual and
social transformation, I will focus on three main questions:

> 1. How does learning take place in the study circle?
> 2. What tools are used by the participants and how do they shape their learning?

3. How does the participants’ multivoicedness influence the learning process?

When we are engaged in a practice, we learn. “Learning is the engine of practice, and
practice is the history of that learning” (Wenger, 1999, p. 96). Whether the group has
learned to apply what they have learned –teaching regular classes for the spiritual
education of children– will only become visible as they apply their learning through
action. “As in science, where theory is tested by experimentation, spiritual insights must
be tested by their expression in the world. The aim is to give effective material form to
spiritual truth. Interpretation creates meaning. But meaning is tested in action, and action
shapes reality” (Lample, 2009, p. 47).
Significance of the study
I am convinced that this study gives the participants deeper insights into the learning
processes that take place as they engage in finding useful concepts and develop tools in
order to educate children. This study provides an increased understanding into tutor-
student relationships.
This study is a contribution to the research literature that explores learning processes in
study circles the world over, and contributes as to how learning will look like in the
future. The internet and social media tools constantly provide information, knowledge
and tools for learning in new individual and collaborative ways. A report by the European
Commission called: School’s Over: Learning Spaces in Europe in 2020: An Imagining

Exercise on the Future of Learning (Miller, Shapiro, & Hilding-Hamann, 2008), builds on
the premise that the context for learning is already changing, and that in the 21 st Century
Learning-intensive Society, Learning Spaces are the next school. It is significant that the
content based curriculum, a major tool in this study circle activity, relies on tools (paper,
writing material) that are normally available even in remote corners of the planet,
allowing participants to learn together.
While this study does not attempt a critical analysis of the content of the course that the
participants are engaged in, there is growing evidence that in multicultural and
multilingual contexts, we need to provide learning spaces, and define common values for
children and teachers. Tuomi in her book Human Dignity in the Learning Environment,
“focuses on how to provide children with tools to prevent problems from starting, dealing
with the problems that occur and creating a milieu conducive to learning” (2001 book
cover). She presents a theory for the “realization of a just, diversity-positive environment
in schools with a practical application in a two-year action research intervention with
school starters” (Tuomi, 2001).
I decided to observe and analyse a study circle, in order to give the reader insights into the
kind of tools that are offered by the curriculum and how they are used by the participants.
This study questions critically the practices offered through Bahá’í study circles. The
insights gained offer participants, tutors and study circle organisers avenues to improve
practices and increase awareness of the elements that influence object and outcome.

2 CHAPTER TWO: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Bahá’í texts claim that the object of every religion is to transform the whole character of
mankind. When members of the Bahá’í community engage with their friends in studying
and completing the course material that aims to give them skills for teaching values to
children, they use a particular method.
A selection of current research has given me insights into how learning takes place. There
are many kinds of learning theory. Learning is a natural concern for students of
neurological functions. Learning has traditionally been the province of psychological
theories that include behaviourist (Skinner, 1988), cognitive (Wenger, 1987),
constructivist (Piaget, 1954), and social learning theories (Bandura, 1977), and some
theories have moved away from an exclusively psychological approach, towards a
cultural-historical school of thought (Vygotsky, 1978); activity theory (Engeström, 1987),
socialization (Parsons, 1967), and organizational theories (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).
For this study I have taken the perspective of the cultural-historical school of thought in
the legacy of Vygotsky, Leont’ev and later on Engeström to look at learning activities.
The Bahá’í perspective on education states that “learning is the educative object of any
study circle. Education is a continuous and creative process. Its aim is to develop the
capacities latent in human nature and to coordinate their expression for the enrichment
and progress of society.” (Document 18, see Appendixes).
Commonly used terms describe and show aspects of learning and development. I can
think of statements made, that indicate that learning has taken place, such as: “I have
changed, I have come a long way, I have learned how to ..., “. They include forward or
backward movement. A process has taken place. The Bahá’í community encourages
learning and development, with a focus on individual and social transformation.
Many theories of learning focus on processes where an individual or a group acquires
some identifiable knowledge or skills in a way that a corresponding, relatively lasting
behavioural change is observed, and this presupposes that the knowledge or skill to be
acquired is itself stable and well defined, and the teacher knows what is to be learned.
However, people and groups often learn things that are not stable, not well defined or
even understood ahead of time. This is true in important transformations of our personal
lives.

2\.1 Learning: constructing a social-cultural view on learning
Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus suggest that individuals pass through five distinct stages from
novice to expert when acquiring skills, be they technical, such as building a house, or
intellectual, such as analyzing a text (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 2000). The reader may be
familiar with the example of learning how to drive a car with a manual transmission, and
the amount of facts, rules, procedures, circumstances and practice necessary in order to
become an expert driver.

> “Continual practice and accumulation of experience, knowledge and action become
> integrated into a coordinated pattern without the need to remember context-independent
> facts and rules. At an expert level, the driver seamlessly integrates shifting gears into
> other aspects of driving practice, and can even simultaneously juggle other tasks like
> eating or talking on a cell phone” (Lample, 2009, p. 63).

Participants in the study course acquire some of the skills and gain insights through
participating in the activity of discussing, asking questions and drawing conclusions.

> “[L]earning skills in Bahá’í practice follows similar stages. Therefore it may appear, at
> the beginning of a new endeavour, that the process is fairly mechanical. We cling to the
> guidance as if applying a formula. But this rigid and inflexible behaviour, which is a
> natural part of learning something new, gradually becomes more sophisticated and
> adaptive with the accumulation of more and more experience” (Lample, 2009, p. 64).

Participating systematically in study circles is a relatively new practice. This study shows
that the tutor demonstrates flexibility in using the curriculum in a way, suited to her ‘way
of doing things’.
Flyvbjerg (1998) wanted to know how new skills come into being and outcompete old
ones. He proposed a sixth stage for innovation. Later, Hubert Dreyfus (2008) embraced
both a sixth and a seventh stage, taking into account innovation and practical wisdom.
The example of learning how to drive a car has an element that has not been mentioned:
the driving instructor.
Vygotsky (1978) developed the concept of a zone of proximal development (ZPD); the
difference between what a learner can do without help and what her or she can do with
help. “Through collaboration one can achieve to higher level outcomes than by working
alone” (Tynjälä, 2008). ZPD is the gap between actual competence level (what problem
level a student is able to independently solve), and the potential development level (what
problem level could he solve with guidance from a tutor). ZPD is based on the mental
functions that have not yet matured but are being in the process of maturation. ZPD states

the role of the tutor as a necessary mediator of the learners’ cognitive development. This
development may also be traced with the elements of rules and division of labour in
activity theory. In Vygotsky’s view, learning is an interactive, interpersonal activity
where the tutor and participants co-construct the solution to a problem, where inequality
between the tutor and the participants resides only in their respective levels of
understanding, where authority is shared and where the psychological mechanism is to
create (external) activities that will be later internalized by the participants.
Lave and Wenger (1991) emphasize the social character of learning as well. They “place
the emphasis on the whole person, and by viewing agent, activity, and world as mutually
constitutive, they give us the opportunity to escape from the tyranny of the assumption
that learning is the reception of factual knowledge or information” (1991). They suggest
that learning is “a process of participation in communities of practice, participation that is
at first legitimately peripheral but that increases gradually in engagement and
complexity” (1991).
2\.1.1 Learning as acquisition or participation?
Individuals not only learn by themselves. They learn together with others. Learning is
relational. Sfard (1998) suggests that learning can be viewed in metaphorical terms as
either being acquisition or participation. She warns of the dangers of just choosing one
metaphor and provides a table with the metaphorical mappings, using six concepts,
showing what they mean for the acquisition metaphor and the participation metaphor.
Table 1: Learning as acquisition-participation (Sfard, 1998)

2\.2 Learning as dialogue with the environment
My study explores conditions that promote sustained participant engagement and a
willingness to engage in discourse aimed at increasing understanding (Wells, 2001, p. 1).
According to Vygotsky (1988), the relationship between the individual and the culture of
which he or she is a member is one of interdependence and in their development, each
shapes and is shaped by the other. When we discuss knowing in action and reflection,
Wells states that “knowledge is only truly known when it is being used by particular
individuals in the course of solving specific problems”, and thus “it is on knowing in
action undertaken jointly with others that the emphasis needs to be placed, and on
opportunities for reflecting on what has been learned in the process (Wells, 2001, p. 9).
Regarding discourse and knowledge, Wells brings together Vygotsky’s insights about the
role of discourse in the individual’s appropriation and mastery of the “higher mental
functions”, and two of Bakhtin’s ideas concerned with the essential dialogicality of
discourse; the principles of “responsivity” and “multivoicedness” (Bakhtin, 1983). Our
meanings are taken over from others as well as being our own constructions. These ideas
help in the attempts made to situate knowing and coming to know in the co-construction
of meaning that takes place in discourse that is truly dialogic. Knowledge building takes
place between people doing things together, and at least part of this doing involves
dialogue (Wells, 2001, p. 13–14).
For Singh monologic communication involves persuasive communication in which the
“speaking” party attempts to alter the “listening” party’s stance, with little or no
expectation of altering their own position. Dialogic communication is then
communication in which both parties problem solve and arrive at mutually altered
positions (Singh, 2008, p. 66).
For Idan, the transformation from mass and monologic communication to conversational
dialogic communication is one of the three most defining characteristics of change, the
other two being the transformation from mass representational democracy to direct
communal democracy and the transformation from one-to-many education to many-to-
many education (Idan, 2010).

Dialogical Inquiry and knowledge
If we are dialogical beings—always engaged in conversation, interpretation, and action—
then the dynamics of understanding underlie and pervade all human activity. I take a view
shared by Gadamer, Habermas, Rorty and Arendt, summarized by Bernstein (1983):

> There are no universal frameworks for knowing; however, progress is possible.
> Knowledge is obtained through a process that associates hermeneutics and praxis,
> that is, interpretation and action. Understanding is a form of practical reasoning and
> practical knowledge. The investigation of reality and discovery of new knowledge
> comes from a community in discourse. As a community engages in dialogue, a
> tradition emerges over time. On some questions, at a given point in history, two
> inquirers can come to different conclusions without either using faulty logic or
> method (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 95).

2\.3 Bateson’s levels of learning – Knowledge creation
Bateson (1972) views learning as a systemic phenomenon (Tosey, 2006). Three levels of
learning are distinguished. Learning (I) refers to conditioning, acquisition of responses
deemed correct in a given context. Wherever Learning (I) is observed, Learning (II) can
also take place. Rules (explicit and tacit) and patterns of behaviour, characteristic to the
context, are acquired. When the context bombards participants with contradictory
demands, Learning (II) creates a double bind (if, for example, your employer tells you to
do a job, but doesn’t allow enough time for you to do it, and you are in danger of losing
your job if you question the situation, you are in double bind), and such pressures can
lead to learning (III). The sense and meaning of the context is radically questioned and a
wider alternative context is constructed. Learning (III) is a collective endeavour and these
processes are rare and dangerous. The conceptualization of Learning (III) was not an
elaborated theory. The theory of expansive learning (Engeström, 2001) develops
Bateson’s idea into a systematic framework, and is seen as a learning activity which has
its own typical actions and tools. The object of expansive learning activity is the entire
activity system in which the learners are engaged. Expansive learning activity produces
culturally new patterns of activity.

Knowledge creation
Organizational theories concern themselves both with the ways individuals learn in
organizational contexts and with the ways in which organizations can be said to learn as
organizations (Wenger, 1999, p. 280). They need to describe the processes or actions that
make the learning process. Nonaka and Takeuchi’s (1995) framework of cyclic
knowledge creation is based on conversions between tacit and explicit knowledge.

Figure 1: Framework of cyclic knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995)
Locating knowledge creation helps to provide insights into how we learn and what the
key actions of learning are. Knowledge creation may come from outside the group that is
engaged in an activity and it may happen in the activity. What is to be created (in my
study: children’s classes) and learned (concepts, skills and abilities) may be partly a
decision given by the curriculum and therefore outside the bounds of the local process
and partly constructed in local practice.
A crucial triggering action in the expansive learning process (Engeström, 1987) is the
conflictual questioning of the existing standard practice.

2\.4 Summary: Sociocultural perspective on learning
The sociocultural perspective views learning as a process of appropriating tools for
thinking, that are made available by social agents who initially act as interpreters and
guides in the individual’s cultural apprenticeship.
Sociocultural theory locates all human activity in a particular historical, cultural and
institutional context. Human behaviour cannot be understood by focussing on the
individual in isolation nor by considering the individual only in face to face interactions
with social agents such as parents or teachers. Episodes of social interaction need to be
located in more encompassing political, cultural, and historical contexts.
An anthropological interpretation of ‘learning as participation’ tends to lose sight on what
learning really is, and that the action theoretical approach to learning, on the other hand,
tends to lose sight on the sociocultural embeddedness of all learning. He suggests
combining both approaches. When learning is to be seen as a cultural phenomenon
embedded in cultural activities, it is necessary to explain the aspects of meaning in
learning as well. A sociocultural explanation of learning can only be complete when it
can account for the process of meaningful learning. In short: learning is a process that
describes the changes in both the structure of human actions and the meaning of human
actions.

3 CHAPTER THREE: LEARNING AS                                    ACTIVITY: ANALYTICAL

FRAMEWORK
I will now present some key aspects that seem relevant for the purpose of my study.
Learning always take place in a social and cultural context and this setting needs to be
included when exploring learning processes. Cultural historical activity theory includes
these elements that together make up the unit of analysis. Activity Theory is a framework
or descriptive tool for analysing interactions within a system. People are socio-culturally
embedded actors. There exists a hierarchical analysis of motivated human action (levels
of activity analysis). The originators are Vygotsky, Leont’ev, Luria, and others starting in
the 1920s.
Activity Theory is more of a descriptive meta-theory or framework than a predictive
theory, and considers the entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations,
etc.) beyond just one actor or user. Activity theory accounts for the environment, the
history of the person, culture, the role of the artefact, motivations, the complexity of real
life action, etc.
Activity theory has its focus on the structure of activities as historically constituted
entities, is essentially a systemic approach, is dynamic and can be used by a variety of
disciplines to understand the way people act. Activity theory is a heuristic method, an
experience-based technique for problem solving, learning, and discovering.
The premise of activity theory is that a collective activity, with the basic purpose shared
by others (community), is undertaken by people (subjects) who are motivated by a
purpose or towards the solution of a problem (object), which is mediated by tools and/or
signs (artefacts or instruments) used in order to achieve an outcome (University of
Warwick, 2011). The activity is constrained and influenced by cultural factors including
conventions (rules) and social organisation (division of labour) within the immediate
context and framed by broader social patterns (of production, consumption, distribution
and exchange). Engeström’s model below shows the structure of a human activity system.

Figure 2: The structure of a human activity system (Engeström, 1987)
Activity theory provides a conceptual framework from which we can understand the
inter-relationship between activities, actions, operations and artefacts, subjects’ motives
and goals, and aspects of the social, organisational and societal contexts within which
these activities are framed.
The idea of internal contradictions as the driving force of change and development in
activity systems, powerfully conceptualized by Evald Ilyenkov (1977; 1982), began to
gain its due status as a guiding principle of empirical research. When activity theory went
international, questions of diversity and dialogue between different traditions or
perspectives became increasingly serious challenges, and the third generation of activity
theory has to deal with these challenges. The third generation of activity theory needs to
develop conceptual tools to understand dialogue, multiple perspectives and voices, and
networks of interacting activity systems. In this mode of research, the basic model is
expanded to include minimally two interacting activity systems.
Engeström’s model above (figure 1) is useful for understanding how a wide range of
factors work together to impact an activity. In order to reach an outcome it is necessary to
share an object and to actively collaborate to put this object into concrete human activity.
Human activity is mediated by artefacts (e.g. tools used, documents, recipes, etc.)
Activity is also mediated by an organization or community. In addition, the community
imposes rules that affect activity. The subject works as part of the community to achieve
the object. An activity normally also features a division of labour.

Leont’ev distinguished a three-level model of activity: activity, action and operation.
Collective activity is driven by an object-related motive. Individual or group action is
driven by a conscious goal, and automatic operations that are driven by conditions and
tools of the action at hand (Leont’ev, 1978).
The four principles described below form an integrated system, as they are associated
with various aspects of the whole activity. They are of relevance for my investigation
about study circles.
   (object-orientedness) People live in a reality that is objective in a broad sense: the

> things that constitute this reality have not only the properties that are considered
> objective according to natural sciences but socially/culturally defined properties as
> well.
   (internalization/externalization) Internal activities cannot be understood if they

> are analyzed separately from external activities, because they transform into each
> other. Internalization is the transformation of external activities into internal ones.
> Internalization provides a means for people to try potential interactions with
> reality without performing actual manipulation with real objects (mental
> simulations, imaginings, considering alternative plans, etc.). Externalization
> transforms internal activities into external ones. Externalization is often necessary
> when an internalized action needs to be “repaired,” or scaled, and is important
> when collaboration between several people requires their activities to be
> performed externally in order to be coordinated.
   (mediation) Human activity is mediated by tools in a broad sense. Tools are

> created and transformed during the development of the activity itself and carry
> with them a particular culture – historical remains from their development. So, the
> use of tools is an accumulation and transmission of social knowledge. Tool use
> influences the nature of external behavior and also the mental functioning of
> individuals.
   (research method – development) Development is not only an object of study; it

> is also a general research methodology. The basic research method in Activity
> Theory is not traditional laboratory experiments but the formative experiment
> which combines active participation with monitoring of the developmental
> changes of the study participants. Ethnographic methods exist today that track the
> history and development of a practice.

I will describe below five main foci when analysing a learning cycle.
3\.1 Activity system: etic view – Participants’ multivoicedness: emic

view
The main unit of analysis is a collective, artifact-mediated and object-orientated activity
system, seen in its network relations to other activity systems. Activities such as content
based course offered by educational organisations are called ‘shells’. Madyarov suggests

> a construct of a shell to denote such a ready-made, pre-packaged environment that
> includes all the elements of an activity system except for the subject and object.
> Courses in modern school-going often represent such shells in that they have a
> structure imposed upon students, where they could bring in their existing objects,
> develop new ones, or simply perform a number of isolated actions not oriented
> towards any object, much like Engeström (1987) suggests. The idea of a shell is
> somewhat opposite to the organic formation of a human activity in that it is not
> constructed by the subjects of the activity.
> ... Thus, a shell is in a way an inorganic context in that individual subjects entering it
> from outside have not created it on their own to suit their motives. Sometimes they
> match the needs of the subjects and their objects very well, and such courses are
> considered successful. When they do not, however, the subjects decide to comply by
> forming their own objects or by bringing in those that would naturally fit the shell
> (Madyarov, 2008, p. 144) .

Subsequent analysis is needed, in order to determine how far the activity of the
collaborative study circle is constructed by participants.
Participants and their multivoicedness – emic view
Activity systems are multi-voiced with subjects that have multiple points of view,
traditions and interests. Multivoicedness is the attribute of the individual, whose actions
are influenced by participation in other communities, and where these participants in
other communities shape and contribute to what that individual is in a particular time and
place.
The division of labour in an activity creates different positions for the subjects, as they
carry their own diverse histories, and the activity system itself carries multiple layers and
strands of history engraved in its artifacts, rules and conventions. The multivoicedness is
multiplied in networks of interacting activity systems, and is a source of trouble and
innovations, demanding actions of translation and negotiation.

3\.2 Historicity of an activity system – Contradictions
Activity systems take shape and get transformed over lengthy periods of time. Their
problems and potentials can only be understood against their own history. History itself
needs to be studied as local history of the activity and its objects, and as history of the
theoretical ideas and tools that have shaped the activity (Engeström, 2001). Cole (1996)
demonstrated that activity theory needs to understand the simultaneous co-existence and
interaction of various different cultures and activities - not just the historical evolution of
a single culture. For the purpose of this study, I will look at the historicity of study circles
as an activity, and that of the tutor, acting as a tutor, throughout the instances analysed,
using a discourse analysis approach.
Contradictions – when people are at cross-purposes
Contradictions take a central role as sources of change and development. They are not the
same as problems or conflicts, but are historically accumulating structural tensions within
and between activity systems. Activities are open systems. When an element from the
outside is adopted (for example a new technology or new object), it often leads to an
aggravated secondary contradiction where some old element (for example, the rules of
the division of labour) collides with the new one. Such contradictions generate
disturbances and conflicts, but also innovative attempts to change the activity. Russell
(2001, p. 64–82) states that contradictions occur when people are at cross-purposes. I
favour this, as the term contradiction is usually used when affirmations, ideas or actions
exclude themselves mutually. In activity systems, what happens more often is that people
have slightly different purposes while engaged in the same activity.
Engeström (1987) proposes primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary contradictions.
Primary contradictions arise within the elements of the activity system: subject, object,
instruments, community, rules and division of labour. In school settings with a capitalist
socio-economic formation, the primary contradictions in the elements of activity acquire
the nature of use and exchange value. Learning can be viewed as a use value-oriented
(genuine interest) or exchange value-oriented (for the sake of the grade) activity
(Madyarov, 2008, p. 340). Secondary contradictions are those that emerge between these
elements within an activity system. Tertiary contradictions arise when a culturally more
advanced activity within the central activity of interest introduces a more advanced

object or motive. Quaternary contradictions exist between the central activity system and
the outside systems (Madyarov, 2008, p. 34).
3\.3 Expansive transformations
Qualitative transformations take place in activity systems over extended cycles. As the
contradictions of an activity system are aggravated, some participants begin to question
and deviate from established norms. This may turn into collaborative envisioning and a
deliberate collective change effort. An expansive transformation is accomplished when
the object and motive of the activity are reconceptualised to embrace a radically wider
horizon of possibilities than in the previous mode of the activity. A full cycle of
expansive transformation is thus a collective journey through the zone of proximal
development of the activity; it is the distance between the present everyday actions of the
individuals and the historically new form of the societal activity that can be collectively
generated as a solution to the double bind potentially embedded in the everyday actions
(Engeström, 1987, p. 174). When the five principles outlined above are cross-tabulated
with the four central questions of any theory of learning, the following matrix below
serves as a framework for summarizing the answers offered by the theory of expansive
learning (Engeström, 2001, p. 150).

3\.4 Summary: Learning as an activity
Learning processes always take place in a social and cultural context. Activity theory
accounts for the environment, the history of the person, culture, the role of the artefact,
motivations, and the complexity of real life action.
The following four principles are associated with various aspects of an activity and form
an integrated system. (a) People live in a reality with things that are considered objective
and have socially and culturally defined properties. (b) People try potential interactions
with reality without performing actual manipulations with real objects. Externalization
transforms internal activities into external ones. Collaboration between several people
requires their activities to be performed externally in order to be coordinated. (c) People
create, use, and transform tools during the development of an activity. This use is an
accumulation and transmission of social knowledge. Tool use influences the nature of
external behavior and also the mental functioning of individuals. Human activity is
mediated by tools. (d) Development is a general research methodology in Activity
Theory, the formative experiment which combines active participation with monitoring of
the developmental changes of the study participants, and ethnographic methods that track
the history and development of a practice.
When analysing a learning cycle, the five main foci are considered. (a) The activity is
described from the outside. An etic view is taken. (b) The activity is described from the
inside, by using the participants’ voices. An emic view is taken. (c) The activity is
described as it took shape and got transformed over time. (d) Whenever people are at
cross-purposes while doing an activity, change and development becomes possible. (e) As
participants in an activity begin to question and deviate from established norms, the
object and motive of the activity are reconceptualised in order to embrace a wider horizon
of possibilities, and expansive transformation is taking place.

4 CHAPTER FOUR: METHODOLOGY
4\.1 Rationale on methodological choices - Research Strategies
I will use cultural-historical activity theory, also known as CHAT (Engeström, 2006) in
order to frame the analysis of the data collected. Such an open framework allows
uncovering some of the relationships between the elements of the study circle seen as an
activity system.
CHAT is a sociocultural perspective that provides rich possibilities for analysing learning
processes; it allows the analysis of the elements that contribute to the learning process and
places processes in larger historical and cultural contexts.
The theoretical paradigms and perspectives shape our research strategies. The approaches
and methods that I use sit on the above theoretical assumptions. Theory and experience
are intertwined and they reinforce each other.
My choice of method was guided by the desire to bring theory and practice as close
together as possible; the wholeness of the method as a way “to rid ourselves of the ever-
present dichotomy between theoretical elaboration and practice” (FUNDAEC, 2010, p.
133).
CHAT seeks to capture learning processes and provides rich insights. The unit of analysis
is a motivated activity directed at an object (goal). Internal contradictions are seen as the
driving force of change and development in activity systems.
4\.2 Methods of Data Collection and Analysis
I had the opportunity to carry out my research with a group of five participants that were
about to start a course on how to teach children spiritual values. Before the beginning of
the course, I was able to meet with the tutor, and conducted a video-recorded interview
with her. As I was not able to attend the five evening sessions with the group, the tutor
agreed to video-record the sessions. Upon my request, she also asked the participants a
few questions about their motives in joining such a course. I did not wish to carry out
extensive interviews as my focus was directed towards the observation and analysis of the
actual activity. I did however ask the tutor to ask the participants at the beginning of the
third session about the impact the activity has had on them. In addition, after the fifth
session, I was able to join the group after their course for an in depth interview on their

progress and what they had learned up to then. This was done over a period of eight
months between December 2010 and July 2011. At that point, the group still had to
complete two formal sessions. This would complete the first part of their coursework. The
next part would include assisting others that hold already children’s classes.
I asked the tutor to video-record five out of seven sessions, lasting each about 90 minutes.
They show the participants with their tutor engaged in completing the curriculum:
Teaching Children’s Classes, Grade 1, book 3 (Ruhi Institute, 1995).
Data collection methods include the initial interview with the tutor before the start of the
course, the written questionnaire at the start of the course, meeting the group after session
five in order to carry out an in depth interview and sharing of my observations and
findings, as well as ongoing observations, personal notes, and email exchanges with the
group.
I use CHAT as the framework to place the collected data, and discourse analysis to
analyze the data. These two tools allow me to answer my research questions. With over
10 hours of recording, I chose to organize the data into meaningful chunks and label them
according to the activity theory approach. I am aware that further analysis with the same
data might no doubt bring to light more insights according to the method of interpretation
used.
The video-recording of the sessions provides the possibility of capturing the multi-modal
sensitivity to conversational data. I observed an underlying calm and peaceful atmosphere
during the sessions, a friendly and respectful manner in which participants talked to each
other, the trusting non-verbal communication and other elements that are an integral part
of the concept of Bahá’í consultation. A brief description of what constitutes Bahá’í
consultation can be found in Appendix B: Bahá’í consultation.
4\.2.1 Interview design
For the first interview with the tutor, (Appendix: Excerpts collected: 1: INT01) I asked
the following questions in Luxembourgish:

> Q1: Please present yourself briefly
> Q2: How did you become interested in the course 3 on children’s education?
> Q3: How are you involved with education and how do you see education in general?
> Q4: How do you view your role as a facilitator?

Q5: Would you like to add anything else?

At the start of session 3, I asked the tutor in an email to ask the participants (Hamed and
Romain were present) the following question:

> Q1: How does the participation in the study course affect your daily life? Are their initial
> experiences, discussions and thoughts?

This question was verbally put to the participants by the tutor as follows in
Luxembourgish:

> “Does participating in the course have an influence on your daily life? Can you already
> notice something?” (19.3.INTS3, line 12)
Care was taken not to ask any leading questions, to keep questions open-ended if
possible, to allow for additional comments to be made. The responses to the interviews
and questionnaires represent a description of multivoicedness and historicity, an element
of activity theory. They possibly confirm subsequent observations during the activity.
4\.2.2 Questionnaire design
For the short written questionnaire given to the participants, before the start of the
session, I asked the following questions (Appendix: Excerpts collected: 2: WQ01

> Q1: Please present yourself briefly
> Q2: How did you become interested in participating in this course?
> Q3: How are you involved with education and how do you see education in general?
> Q4: How do you see this quotation: “Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable
> value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to
> benefit there from”.
> Q5: How do you view your role as a participant?
> Q6: What are your expectations?

Q7: Would you like to add anything else?

4\.3 Data collection
In order to obtain different types of data and allow a rich and multimodal description, I
have collected a number of data sets for this study. Five video-recorded sessions with
the participants (upon my request, this was done by the tutor) present the main body of
data. They are the recording during which participants complete their course work, the
Ruhi book 3. They include the exercises, the readings and the group discussions.
The video- and audio-recorded interview data (I was present during some interviews,
while for others, the tutor asked the questions) represent the feedback and comments
given by the participants.

The written questionnaire data present short passages, during which participants have
written down their comments and answers.
The notes, which include emails and notes from my own observations, provide additional
data which add to a richer description used for this study.
From this large body of empirical data, I have chosen 21 data excerpts, after having
viewed and listened to the data several times. I have selected the excerpts according to
their relevance with my research questions and the general framework of activity theory.
They are brought together further below in an overview grid of data collected and used.
The transcripts of the 21 data excerpts in chronological order are located in the
Appendixes, Excerpts collected.
I have also collected a number of documents, which include a range of primary texts,
written or commissioned by the central authors and institutions of the Bahá’í community,
by individuals or Bahá’í inspired organisations. These 19 documents are brought together
further below in an overview grid of documents used. The documents are located in the
Appendixes: Data collected: Documents.
Being aware that questionnaires and interviews can be subject to numerous interpretations
and challenge the participants in the study to give either the answer the researcher wants
to hear or give a desired answer for them, I chose to relate this data to the recording of the
sessions. Participants were well aware that the sessions were recorded, but their main
object was to complete their workbook together.
I use the elements of the activity system to interconnect data excerpts with a focus on my
research questions that center on the analysis of learning processes. I include a detailed
chronology of the data excerpts in Appendix I.
4\.4 Data analysis through Discourse Analysis
Gee (2005) states that discourse analysis considers how language, both spoken and
written, enacts social and cultural perspectives and identities. In this passage, I have
selected some passages that seem relevant for my analysis.
In my study I looked at aspects on how learning takes place within a study circle. For this
research, the data I collected are: video-recordings and selected transcripts from the

sessions, written comments by the participants, interviews, authoritative Bahá’í texts and
other documents.
When we communicate, we may strive for clarity, but we always are situated in an
historical context and what we say is influenced by our multivoicedness. Reflecting on
what people have said and written, and thereby discovering meaning and interpretation is
the basis of discourse analysis (2005). I have chosen the passages and texts in order to
reflect what the participants and prominent Bahá’í texts have said about learning.
We continuously create language, and giving our listening skills a second chance to hear
what has been said and written becomes a principle of ethics. This attitude, namely, to
listen more carefully and ponder more deeply on what we hear and read, contributes to
make the world a more just and equitable place to live. Following this idea, as Gee states,
we will be better placed to cooperate with others in human endeavours, especially in a
fast-changing, global, culturally diverse (and often dangerous) world (2005).
For Gee, human language serves mainly two closely related functions: to support the
performance of social activities and social identities and to support human affiliation
within cultures, social groups, and institutions. So “when we speak or write we always
use the grammar of our language to take a particular perspective on what the “world” is
like” (2005, p. 1–2).
Bahá’í texts provide a particular perspective on what the world is like and strive towards
a “more just” place to live together. In my study, I have looked at some of these texts and
I have looked at some transcripts of what the participants engaged in the particular study
circle are saying about learning.
For Gee (2005, p. 5), “”truth”, (which he would define “as doing better, rather than
worse, in not getting physically, socially, culturally, or morally “bitten” by the world), is
a matter of taking, negotiating, and contesting perspectives created in and through
language”.
He claims that no set of research tools and no theory belong to a single person, and he
sees his approach to discourse analysis as one where he has freely “borrowed and patched
together”. His approach seeks to balance talk about the mind, talk about social interaction
and activities, and talk about society and institutions. For him “research adopts and adapts
specific tools of inquiry and strategies for implementing them” and that “these tools and

strategies ultimately reside in a “community of practice” formed by those engaged in such
research” (2005, p. 6).
Furthermore, Gee introduces a number of tools of inquiry for D/discourse analysis and
strategies for using them. The way language is used to enact activities and identities is
called “discourse” with a “little d”. But when “little d” discourses (language-in-use) are
melded with non-language “stuff” to enact specific identities and activities, “big D”
Discourses are involved (2005, p. 7). Tools of inquiry study discourse in Discourses.
It is only possible to make sense of what someone has said, written, or done if the person
has an idea who he/she is and what he/she is doing. We have at times access to different
identities and activities that are connected to different sorts of status and social goods, and
this may constitute one source of inequality in society. Analysing and raising awareness
in such matters is a contribution to social justice. “Since different identities and activities
are enacted in and through language, the study of language is integrally connected to
matters of equity and justice” (Gee, 2005, p. 22).
Gee states that “language has meaning only in and through social practices” (2005, p. 8).
In this study, I look in detail at the social practice of the study circle and explore some
learning processes in the Bahá’í context of a collaborative study circle for individual and
social transformation.
Discourse analysis, from a wider perspective, seeks to advance our common enterprise of
understanding how language works in society in order to create better and worse
worlds, institutions, and human relationships (2005, p. 8).
Reflexivity is a property of language where meaning is situated in actual contexts of use.
Language and context can be regarded as being like two mirrors facing each other and
constantly and endlessly reflecting their own images back and forth between each other.
There exists reciprocity between language and reality. Language reflects reality (the way
things are) (Gee, 2005, p. 97).
People build situations by using language to carry out seven building tasks, discourse
situations, situations in which language is put to use:

> an activity or related set of activities (building task 2) in which people take on
> certain sorts of identities or roles (building task 3), contract certain sorts of
> relationships with each other (building task 4), and use certain sorts of sign

> systems and forms of knowledge (building task 7). In such a situation, people and
> things take on certain meanings or significance (building task 1); things are
> connected or disconnected, relevant or non-relevant to each other in various ways
> (building task 6); and various sorts of social goods are at stake in various ways
> (building task 5) (Gee, 2005, p. 97).
(1) Participants in the study circle use language to make things significant, to give them

meaning or value, to build significance.
(2) Participants may use language to get recognized as engaging in a certain sort of

activity.

(3) Participants use language to get recognized as taking on a certain identity or role.
(4) Participants use language to signal what sort of relationship they have, want to have,

> or are trying to have with other people, groups or institutions about whom they are
> communicating; they use language to build social relationships.
(5) Participants use language to convey a perspective on the nature of the distribution of

social goods (e.g.: politics), that is, to build a perspective on social goods.
(6) Participants use language to render certain things connected or relevant (or not) to

other things, that is, to build connections or relevance.
(7) Participants use language to make certain sign systems and certain forms of

> knowledge and belief relevant or privileged, or not, in given situations, that is, to
> build privilege or prestige for one sign system or knowledge claim over another.

In this study, I have been able to analyse some of these elements, by using the activity
theory framework and by looking carefully at the different transcripts. These building
tasks are often supported by the same words and phrases.

After a session had taken place, I picked up the tape at the tutor’s place of work in the city
and she kept me informed about the progress of the group, as well as any new
developments. I would then transfer the tapes to the computer’s hard disk. While looking
at the data thus collected, my efforts went into identifying rich moments, discovering

unusual ‘things’ that occurred and looking for items related to my research question.
Then, during subsequent viewings I used a grid model that allowed me to look deeper into
the data. The grid contains columns for the sections in the curriculum, and the
corresponding comments and interactions made by the participants. From this grid I than
selected pertinent items and transcribe them fully.
4\.6 Context
The Luxembourgish Bahá’í community counts 414 members, 296 adult members, 38
youth between 15 and 20, 27 adolescents (also called pre-youth) between 12 and 15 and
53 children. The Bahá’í Faith was first introduced to Luxembourg just over 60 years ago.
Worldwide, over 350.000 people finished the first course of the Institute, and over
130\.000 people, having finished the course on children’s education, are now potential
children’s class teachers (Universal House of Justice, 2010b).
My study focuses on the activity where five participants were engaged in completing the
curriculum: Teaching children’s classes Grade 1 in Luxembourg. This pattern, where
members of the Bahá’í community, together with their friends, neighbours and colleagues
participate in classes that provide them with the necessary skills and insights in order to
teach children spiritual values, is repeated in every country the world over. As a direct
result of past participants completing a number of books that are part of an educational
program in Luxembourg, as of March 2011, there were 12 regular proximity classes with
58 children. 124 participants have completed the course: Teaching children’s classes
Grade 1.
Teaching children’s classes Grade 1(see Appendix H for the cover illustration) is the third
book that is part of a sequence of courses offered to those interested in teaching values to
children, and more broadly, the process of one’s individual development and fulfilment
tied to the centering of one’s energies on the betterment of humankind and serving the
needs of the community and the larger society. Appendix K provides an outline of the
courses offered at present, together with the units covered, their purpose and any practice
elements.
Those that wish to complete the course: Teaching children’s classes Grade 1 should have
at least completed the first course, available to anyone aged 15 and over, called:
Reflections on the Life of the Spirit. Developed by the Ruhi Institute in Colombia, the
workbook uses an interactive, question-and-answer format that fosters a participatory

learning process in which the entire group develops a new capacity for individual and
social action.
Participating in a collaborative study circle as a student or a tutor is done on a voluntary
basis. The study courses, a form of collective learning, form a collaborative, self-directed
learning process being undertaken by Bahá’í communities around the world, where all are
welcome, regardless of their ideas and beliefs, but with the aim of serving the needs of
the community and the larger society.
Educational program
   Today there is no educational system in the world that can be called “Bahá’í”.

> Such a system can only be created through the efforts of numerous educators
> working in diverse settings and cultures over an extended period of time.
> Nevertheless, certain principles and concepts can be identified that should
> influence endeavours to develop elements of Bahá’í education (Ruhi Institute,
> 1995, p. 1).
   Educational programs are conducted for diverse age groups, from the tender age

> of 5 and 6 to adulthood. Currently, three programs are conducted and the material
> continues to undergo changes as experience in the field advances and as an
> increasing number of curricular elements under development reach the stage
> where they can be made widely available. The main sequence of courses is part of
> a formal educational program aimed at building capacity for service. The
> sequence is conceived in terms of three cycles, each one concerned with the
> spiritual and moral empowerment of individuals from a particular perspective.

The institute that organises the study circles in Luxembourg pays attention to include all
members of the Bahá’í community in their educational activities. The tutor, who is also
the coordinator for organising the study circles on education children, had asked the
participants whether they would be interested in this educational activity, since they had
themselves children and might also be interested in serving as a teacher for children’s
classes.
4\.7 Participants
After consulting with the other coordinators of the Institute and the auxiliary board
member (person appointed in order to assist the community in the propagation of the

Faith), the tutor had identified a number of Bahá’ís that had completed at least book 1
and/or book 2 of the sequence of courses. She had contacted them and four of them
agreed to start the course.
Three of the participants live in the same geographical area, close to the city of
Luxembourg, another participant lives also close to the city and the tutor lives in the south
of Luxembourg. All five meetings that the tutor was able to video-record took place in the
apartment of Anne and Romain, a couple with a young child that currently attends a
children’s class. The meetings took place on Tuesday evenings between January and July
2011\. Although I focus on the material collected until July 2011, the remaining sessions
are being video-recorded and I keep up-to-date with how the group is progressing.
Two participants joined the course at some stage, but didn’t stay on due to other
commitments. According to the tutor, the participants are not close friends and do not
know each other well, although they have met occasionally in Bahá’í activities and
gatherings. They all have young children in need of education. All are members of the
Luxembourgish Bahá’í community, except Anne.
The tutor, in her early forty’s, comes from the south of Luxembourg. She is married with
two children, has grown up in Luxembourg, and works as a teacher in the city, involved
in an innovative school project. Since she has become a Bahá’í a few years ago, she has
completed the sequence of study circle courses, has been appointed coordinator of the
children’s classes within the institute that organises the courses. She holds children’s
classes on a regular basis at her home. Her husband is not a Bahá’í.
Romain, in his late twenty’s, lives in one of the areas around the city centre. He is
married to Anne, who also participates in the course. They have a young boy, attending
Bahá’í children’s classes. Romain works as an educator and sociologist. He has been a
Bahá’í for many years.
Anne, in her late twenty’s, is married to Romain. She has participated in Ruhi book 1.
She grew up in France, speaks French, Russian and English, and holds an administrative
position in the city.
Josefa, in her late thirty’s, lives in the same area as Romain and Anne. She is married to
Paulo, a Portuguese man, who works as a painter and decorator. They are both Bahá’ís,
with three young children. She comes from Brazil, and has moved to Luxembourg a few

years ago. She speaks French and Portuguese. She stays at home and looks after their
children.
Hamed, in his late twenty’s, is married to a Chinese Bahá’í. They live in a flat in another
area around the city of Luxembourg. They have two young children. Hamed works as an
independent real estate developer and speaks fluently Luxembourgish, English, French,
German, Persian and some Chinese. His parents are both Persian. He was brought up in a
‘Bahá’í environment’.
Participants and their use of languages
Participants have used French during the discussions. On isolated occasions, when the
Luxembourgish speaking participants were together, they used Luxembourgish. In
excerpt two and 20, Josefa’s written text has been translated from Portuguese into
English, and the original document in Portuguese is included in the Appendixes, after
excerpt two and 20. The table below lists the participants and the languages they are
familiar with.

4\.8 Limitations and ethical considerations
This study is focussing on a single case study in which participants were engaged in a
learning activity in the frame of a collaborative study circle. No comparisons are made
with other learning groups or individual learning. The instruments and methods that I
apply to the study attempt to uncover only so much and I do not claim that ‘no stone has
been left unturned’. Applying other methods reveal different aspects of the same reality.
Ethical considerations: When conducting my research, I was guided by three
fundamental ethical principles from the Belmont Report: (1) respect for the participants
involved in the study, (2) beneficence, and (3) justice (Bui, 2009, p. 81). I provided the
participants with adequate information so that they could make an informed consent.

Participants were informed as to who was conducting the research, and that I could be
contacted before, during and after the research. I informed the participants about the
purpose and the potential benefits of the study. This research involved to my knowledge
no potential risks. The third principle refers to fairness and equity in the selection of
participants and the distribution of benefits. Participants were selected because they were
part of a group that was about to start a study circle that provided an opportunity for my
research.
In order to preserve a degree of anonymity, I have changed the names of the participants,
as well as names of people and places mentioned in the transcriptions. All of the
participants agreed that the sessions and interviews would be audio and/or video-
recorded.

5 CHAPTER FIVE: DATA ANALYSIS
5\.1 The collaborative study circle as an activity system: a Bahá’í view
5\.1.1 Historicity of the study circle
Any activity system carries multiple layers and strands of history engraved in its artifacts,
rules and conventions; it is a source of trouble and innovations, demanding actions of
translation and negotiation.
The study circle I have observed has a limited duration with a specific object. As an
activity it has been developed over a number of years, in various contexts and
environments, by national and international Bahá’í institutions. Together with actors at
the grass-roots, they continually seek to engage participants in a process of learning.
Consider document 1:
Instance 1: Document 1

> The Ruhi Institute curriculum had been tested and adapted over many years. It has
> enabled the friends in different countries to get the institute system up and running in a
> short time. Rather than having the participants be passive listeners to a wide array of
> unconnected talks, the Ruhi Institute materials seek to engage the friends fully in the
> process of learning. Bahá'ís with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds have found
> the curriculum's deceptively simple approach, based heavily on connecting the believers
> to the Creative Word, both appealing and empowering (International Teaching Centre,
> 2000, p. 5).

Analysis 1: Historicity of the study circle
This passage indicates that the curriculum used in the study circles has been tested and
adapted over many years on a world wide scale; it shows the motive for engaging in a
series of educational activities suitable for diverse cultural backgrounds.
Study circles started in Luxembourg around 2001 and have since evolved, although the
basic material, the curriculum that includes selected Bahá’í quotations, have remained the
same, at least for some of the course material. These collaborative study circles,
presenting the response to an increased educational need within the Bahá’í community are
going to stay and will develop over an extended period of time. This content based
curriculum with a focus on individual and social transformation has been designed with a
minimum of mediating artifacts, rules and conventions, thereby allowing the expression
of diverse cultural and linguistic nuances, as the material is being used in the most diverse
parts of the world.

Collaborators participate in a sequence of currently eight courses (see Appendix K:
sequence of courses: purpose and practice elements) and each course, a study circle, is
considered an activity system. Problems and opportunities have occurred in previous
study circles. The activity system that I looked at required collaborators to have
completed at least Ruhi book one. In addition, learning around the different study circles
has taken place. Over time, the organisers of the study circles, together with the
collaborators have gained experience in Luxembourg and in other parts of the world, in
what constitutes a successful study circle (possibility to expand on the bottom up
collecting of experience and top down suggestion for change as a result). This can be for
example the fact that collaborators make an effort to carry out the service/action tasks
asked for in the curriculum.
The collaborative study circles are “activities that lie at the heart of a current series of
global Plans” (document 3), and “each of the various elements that form part of the
framework of the current series of Plans evolves through a process of learning guided by
the decisions of the Universal House of Justice and overseen by the International
Teaching Centre”. This learning process takes place at the grassroots. It is “characterized
by structured reflection woven into action at the local level, enables materials and
methods to benefit from the experience of the Bahá’í community worldwide in their use,
ensuring their continued efficacy” (Universal House of Justice, 2011 letter to the author).
Historicity of the study circle goes all the way back to the birth of the Bahá’í Faith, whose
purpose is to “effect a transformation in the whole character of mankind [...]. For if the
character of mankind be not changed, the futility of God’s universal Manifestations
would be apparent” (document 4).

Figure 3: The study circle as an activity system

Activity: what type of activity is taking place?

In this study I have observed a group of four participants and a tutor, called collaborators
(term used by the Ruhi Institute to refer to all who study, teach, or apply its courses,
wherever they reside), engaged over a period of several months and six sessions of about
two hours each, in a collective activity: completing book 3: teaching children’s classes:
grade 1. They form what is called a collaborative study circle.

Community: in what environment is this activity being carried out?

The basic purpose of the activity is shared by others (community), interested in learning
skills for the education of children. This community is firstly the Bahá’í community, who
invites their friends and neighbours, to participate in the activity. A growing number of
these study courses are taking place in neighbourhood areas throughout the country.
There is a growing recognition that the Bahá’í community has a valuable contribution
towards achieving a greater social cohesion. Two recent examples demonstrate this: the
presence of the Bahá’í community at the Forum du Bénévolat during one week at the City
Concorde in Bertrange, offering to interested individuals the possibility to become
teachers for children’s classes (see Appendix F: Forum du bénévolat); and the recent
attendance of the Minister of Finance, Luc Frieden, at the yearly celebration of the
National Day in Luxembourg, stating that the value of a religious community or any other
organisation must be the reflection of the contribution it is bringing to the development of
society (see Appendix G).

Subjects: who is involved?

The activity is undertaken by people interested in child education. The curriculum calls
them collaborators (subjects). Students and tutors/facilitators are considered collaborators,
as they share the Institute’s purpose: to use the courses as a means of promoting the well-
being of humanity. In every group, there is always a more experienced person who acts as
a tutor; the other members of the group constitute the “students” who seek the tutor’s help
with their studies. It is however clearly understood by all participants that they are
engaged in a reciprocal process, one in which everyone learns. The responsibility of
learning rests with each participant, who undertakes the active work of learning. The tutor
facilitates this process, and also gains new insights into the material. The relationship is
not that of a learned one with a group of ignorant people (Ruhi Institute, 1999, p. 1).

Object(ive): why is the activity taking place?

The activity has to do with the education of children. This is the object of the activity.
The curriculum states that participants are motivated by a purpose which consists in
educating children and solving a number of practical problems (object) that they are
confronted with. This could for instance be how to deal with children that are agitated,
children that do not wish to share colouring pencils, etc.
The activity is also happening, because the tutor, who is also the children’s class
coordinator for Luxembourg, has called and asked those members of the Bahá’í
community that have children, whether they would be interested in a course on child
education.
Bahá’í institutions worldwide also encourage their members to engage in a process of
change and education, being more systematic and inviting their friends and neighbours to
participate in their activities for individual and social transformation.
Engaging in a collaborative study promotes a more active way of learning, as the
following passage from document 1 in the Appendix section indicates: “[...] the Ruhi
Institute materials seek to engage the friends fully in the process of learning”.

Rules and regulations: are there any cultural norms, rules and values?

The activity is guided by certain conventions (rules, written and unwritten) and has a
certain social organisation (division of labour). This would include the practice of
alternate reading by each participant of the material used. The meeting would usually be
on a Tuesday evening between 8 and 10pm. The activity that I have observed has always
been held at the apartment of the married couple with two children, located closely to
where the other 2 participants live. This meant that the tutor had the longest distance to
drive, about 35 minutes. The hosts would usually serve refreshments. Members of the
group have brought with them certain expectations as they had to complete the study of
book 1 in order to participate in this activity, book 3. This specific rule is applied partly
from the tutor and from the national institute coordinator.
Each member that joins the activity brings along a cultural and historical baggage that
will influence behaviour and norms. As all but one of the participants (Anne) in this study
circle are members of the Bahá’í community, they are influenced by a set of values that
guide their actions and interactions within the group.

Tools: what means are used in performing the activity?

The activity is mediated by a number of tools, signs and artefacts (instruments); the
means that are used in performing the activity. The language used was French and the
textbook was in French, with the option to refer to other languages, such as German
(during session 1, see excerpt 3), the tutor referred to the German book), English or
Portuguese. Three participants have their own course content, book 3 and the two
participants that are married (Anne and Romain), share one copy. Writing material is
used to answer the questions and write their reflections in their book. The tutor is
considered here as a mediating person/agent, someone who has more experience with
the material studied, and would have already undertaken children’s classes. Each
participant brings to the activity tools coming from his or her cultural and historical
background (on a few occasions participants mentioned that Hamed comes from a long
standing Baha’i family. Hamed has cultural roots that link him closely to the founder of
the Baha’i faith. Both Hamed, born towards the end of the 20th century, and Bahá'u'lláh,
founder of the Bahá’í Faith, born at the beginning of the 19th century, share the same
country of birth, Persia). Two of the participants have some musical skills and play the
guitar (singing songs with the children is one the skills that the course encourages).
Additional online tools, such as resources for carrying out the classes, comments and the
sharing of experiences from other participants worldwide are available (mentioned during
session 5 by the tutor).
Tools can become hindrances and weaknesses for the participants, if, for example, a
participant does not speak or understand well the language in which the course takes
place. The tutor and the participants adapt to such a situation through a number of tools
available to them, and are guided by their values.

Outcomes: what is the desired outcome?

The activity system is made up of three sets of outcomes; the desired outcome suggested
in the curriculum; the desired outcome as observed through interviews and observations
of the participants; and the actual outcome, as stated by the participants. In the analysis 4,
table 7, I compare the expected and actual outcome as described by participants.

Expected outcome suggested by the curriculum
Participants are motivated by a threefold purpose: to understand some of the basic
principles of Bahá’í education of children; learning to teach simple children’s classes

consisting of memorization of prayers and quotations, songs, stories, games and
colouring; and to develop the skills and abilities needed to conduct classes for children,
managing the class with a great deal of love and understanding and, at the same time,
with the discipline necessary to create a proper learning environment. Achieving the
outcome includes a number of things: understanding of one of the basic concepts which is
the nobility of man (values); understanding that each human being is a mine rich in gems
which education can uncover and develop (values); participants engage in children’s
education, be it through interaction with their own children and those of others in their
home and neighbourhood, and be it through children’s classes (practice); participants
have gained a number of skills (teach children to memorize prayers and quotations (1),
teach them songs (2), tell them stories (3), teach them games (4) and encourage their
creativity through colouring (5), as well as organising the class (6)). Document 19 in the
Appendix section gives further details what participants are expected to know after the
completing the different units and offers suggestions to the tutor. Appendix L provides a
list of Bahá’í texts, to be read, meditated on and, or to be memorized.

Indicators that measure outcome
Measuring the achievement of some of these goals includes finding indicators. The
number of children participating in a children’s class and the number of participants that
engage in such an activity is currently used as an indicator for success by the institute that
organises the collaborative study circles and assists with the setting up of classes for
children throughout the country. The institute organises regular tutor gatherings, where
tutors can exchange their experiences that would include challenges, achievements and
aspects of the course content. The institute also encourages tutors to accompany
participants in their path of learning, during and beyond the time of the study circle.
The tutor, whose role it is to accompany the participants may ask them to take action: to
assist in a children’s class. This will be one indicator that shows whether learning has
taken place. Each participant has been engaged in a process of learning and has voiced
this in the written questionnaire, excerpts 20 and 21 (see also table 3: overview grid –
kind of data collected and used in this study).

Division of labour
The role of the tutor is to accompany participants along the path of learning, study and
action. The tutor in this activity system is responsible for accompanying the participants

along the path of completing the curriculum. She encourages them to reach their expected
outcomes. In the present study it was the tutor’s role to fix the meetings, to record the
sessions, to move along at a reasonable speed in order to complete the curriculum.
Participants carry out the exercises in the course book. The tutor has completed book 1
and 3. Although it is usually necessary to complete the sequence of courses in order to
tutor a book, I was told by the tutor for this study circle that an exception was made
(verbal comment made to researcher on 30.7.2011). A number of tasks have been given to
some participants. The hosts provide refreshments and snacks. Here it was Romain and
Anne that took care of having their home ready to receive the group.
There is an intense relation between the rules and the division of labour. Out of the
division of labour, rules and regulations emerge and vice-versa.
In this study, the unit of analysis is the activity of the study circle. Activity theory has in
this study partly being used as a tool that participants may use to get a clearer
understanding of the activity they are involved in. After session 5 (excerpt 18), I joined
the group to give them an update on my theoretical ideas and how activity theory may
help them in their learning.
5\.2 The collaborative study circle through the eyes of the participants
5\.2.1 Multivoicedness - voices of the participants
Activity systems are multi-voiced, as each participant carries one or more voices in the
activity. The study circle is a community of multiple points of view, traditions and
interests. The division of labour in an activity creates different positions for the
collaborators, as they carry their own diverse histories.
The five collaborators bring into the study circle their historicity and multivoicedness. I
present them here by going chronologically through the data as they appear.
Instance 2: Excerpts 1-21
Analysis 2: Participants’ Multivoicedness

The tutor
speaks with the voice of a teacher in a relatively new forward thinking school project
(excerpt 1, L1, 5, 10). She speaks with the voice of a teacher exposed to ongoing research
in her school environment and these experiences are brought into the activity (L11, 12).

She voices her view as a Bahá’í and that of an educator, as it is part of her history, her
life experience, and she connects the two voices into one, “because deep down, they say
the same thing”, well si am Fong, datselwecht soen (L14). She makes it clear that
for her learning is happening constantly and something that happens in dialogue and
confrontation with others (L13). She speaks with the voice of the tutor (excerpt 18, L16)
She expresses on a number of occasions her joy of being with children and the beauty of
being engaged in a process of teaching: (L22), schrecklech gär (L05), wat fir mech
flott war (L19), “pour moi c’était très beau, car tous les jours j’ai la chance
d’enseigner” (excerpt 3, L46). This is meaningful, when on the following occasion, je
me sens pas encore cent pour cent à l’aise (excerpt 18, L22), as she reflects as
a tutor on how this study circle went.
The tutor brings out the understanding voice during the sessions, (excerpt 3, L24), or by
asking open ended questions that encourage dialogue among participants (L1), (excerpt
8, L16).
She speaks through a number of different voices that have shaped her over time and
makes her who she is continuously. Some examples include Socrates (L025), Anne, one
of the participants when she refers to her (excerpt 3, L42), a friend of hers (excerpt 9,
L04), in the name of a child in general, or all the children (excerpt 9, L13, 16, 20, 29, 31).
These observations are often when the tutor shares her teaching experiences with the
group.
Occasionally, she takes the voice of the participants: we, mir sinn net vill den
Owend, awer mir schaffe ganz gutt (excerpt 8, L11), (excerpt 9, L02), (excerpt 12,
L01), on va chanter (excerpt 13, L14, 16, 29), on va trouver un Kassettespiller
(L43), or: in the name of the researcher (L37).
The tutor brings in the voice of Hamed, a participant, and Mr Furutan, the person that
Hamed quoted (excerpt 12, L01, 03). This adds weight to what Hamed said as it comes
from a respected and well-known Bahá’í scholar. This is repeated in the last
questionnaire (excerpt 21, L03).
As the tutor reflects on what she as a tutor has learned, she focuses on the concept of
memorization, and how repetition is the mother of knowledge (excerpt 21, L03),
she combines a number of voices: the voice of Hamed, who quoted this short passage on
repetition from Mr Furutan; the voice of her son who talked about the importance of

repetition in the context of mastering Judo, and how while he was in Japan for three
weeks, the Japanese Judo master spent three hours practicing one movement, and the
voice of Ken Robinson, a writer who talks about how 10.000 hours of training can bring
pure joy and happiness, when one has found ‘one’s element’. By combining the elements
of repetition, knowledge and happiness, the tutor voiced in a few sentences her own
voice (1), and the voices of Hamed (2), Mr Furutan (3), her son (4), the Japanese Judo
master (5) and Ken Robinson (6). This description serves as an example of the depth and
richness that historicity and multivoicedness is able to offer when analysing learning
processes. It allows visualising and connecting the different voices used by the
participants. I now wish to briefly describe this aspect for the other participants.

Josefa
starts by taking the voice of ‘we’, presumably she, her husband and the children,
consumed by the daily life and in need of doing something on the spiritual side
(excerpt 2, L3). She takes the voice of someone that wants to give the best of herself,
something that really comes from within (excerpt 2, L5). She voices the wish to
bring out her creative side in order to do things that can be multiplied and thus have real
results (excerpt 2, L7).
Josefa speaks with the voice of ‘we’ in another context, meaning the participants in the
study circle (excerpt 4, L11, 21), or the parents engaged in educating their children, or
the teachers (excerpt 4, L2). Her voice goes back to her family in Brazil (excerpt 4, L9),
taking the voice of those living and working on the fields, that have no formal
instruction, but so much values. She wants to be understood by checking on what she
said: vous comprenez ce que je veux dire?
Josefa takes the voice of those that need to work hard, those that need to develop first, in
order to pass it on to others and our children (excerpt 18, L7, 8, 10). She takes on the
voice of several of her friends (excerpt 19, L2). Josefa had missed two of the six sessions
that had been recorded.

Anne
speaks with the voice of someone, who by being a mother, needs to educate her child and
help him to develop. She speaks with the voice of someone open to learn from the
experience from the other participants and share with them her experiences. It is a
rational voice, eager to know more about child education (excerpt 2, L1, 2, 3, 5).

Anne, being French speaking, takes in the first session a strong voice of someone that
knows how to write French (excerpt 3, L01). This has been analysed in detail further
above. In the passages I have selected, Anne does not express herself a lot verbally. She
has missed session three. She does voice her thoughts during the interview after session
five and for the written questionnaire after session six.
She takes the voice of someone that has got to know better the other participants and
takes on Hamed’s voice, as being ‘only’ parents (excerpt 18, L12), trying to do their best
and “taking” the resources and inspirations a bit from everywhere.
When questioned, Anne takes her voice as someone annoyed by certain practices, ways
of doing an exercise and brings in historicity, as this had already annoyed her some time
ago when she had done Ruhi book 1 (excerpt 19, L1, 3).

Romain
speaks with his own voice as someone eager to learn (excerpt 2, L1), who sees the
education of children as interesting and important (excerpt 2, L2). He takes the voice of
everyone, being responsible for the education of humanity (excerpt 2, L3). He takes the
role of someone that wants to participate in a study so widespread the world over
(excerpt 2, L5), (excerpt 18, l13).
Romain, being aware that Anne, his wife, may not agree with all of the content of the
course, carries to voice of the mediator, the understanding one (excerpt 3, L20, 32, 40,
42), I could imagine that e person, who discovers this idea for the first
time    in   this     book,     that     would       be   much    stronger,         possibly   an
electroshock. (excerpt 8, L30, 32, 34). He takes the voice of the curriculum writers
(excerpt 4, L3), (excerpt 16, L26), the voice of the group (excerpt 8, L2), (excerpt 19, L7,
15), the voice of another participant (excerpt 8, L26) (excerpt 18, L15, 21), the voice of
“one”, ce qu’on sait par cœur, on a toujours avec soi, (excerpt 11, L1),
(excerpt 13, L8, 12, 129), (excerpt 18, L1), the voice of the researcher (L30), the voice of
children (L107), the voice of his parents (L115).
Romain speaks with a voice of confidence regarding the children’s classes, and that it
comes from a pure positive source (excerpt 18, L13).

Hamed
speaks with the voice of a father hoping to play a productive role in the education of his
children (excerpt 2, L3), a learner and a contributor (excerpt 2, L5).

Hamed, borrowing the voice of the tutor (excerpt 4, L16) who makes reference to 50
years ago, picks it up and also refers to the past, il y a 50 ans (excerpt 4, L22), and
also speaks in the voice of “one”, (excerpt 13, L1), (excerpt 15, L29). He then projects
this 50 years ago to 50 years from now (excerpt 4, L24). Hamed takes the voice of the
group (excerpt 9, L9), the voice of the researcher (excerpt 13, L32), the voice of one of
his children (excerpt 13, L96, 98). Hamed had taken the voice of Mr Furutan, covered in
a proverb: repetition is the mother of knowledge (excerpt 12, L2), and making it clear
that it was not his voice (excerpt 16, L15). Here he seems to take the voice of someone
who carries certain norms and values, with respect for a well-known an imminent Bahá’í
scholar, by correcting the tutor and adding “Mr” before the name (excerpt 11, L4).
Hamed brings out his humorous voice, here by using a question, c’est quoi une
cassette (excerpt 13, L1).
In the interview after session 5, Hamed makes a clear distinction in time. What he had
learned now in the study circle made all the more sense and gave meaning to him,
because now, he had children. His context had changed (excerpt 18, L1-5). For Hamed,
his child, at the beginning of the study circle became the mediating artefact, directing
him toward the object of teaching that child (excerpt 18, L11), and giving him the
necessary motivation to engage in a learning process. He takes the strong voice of a
father, who brings context and meaning to values and aspects of Bahá’í teachings, that
used to be only words before. Hamed, in the written questionnaire after session 6, takes
the voice of a confident person, with a desire to teach children’s classes (excerpt 20, L2).
To conclude this description of the multivoicedness and multiple layers of history that the
participants bring to the activity, it is worthwhile drafting a chart where the participants
and their voices are collected.

Participants voiced their expected outcome during the written questionnaire at the start of
session 1, (WQ01), by answering question 6: what are your expectations? I am aware that
this question does not fully answer the question of expected outcome. I include also an
instance from the interview with the tutor before the start of session 1, (INT01).

Analysis 3: Participants’ expected outcome
Josefa hopes to realise a quarter of everything Bahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá’í Faith is
asking. She refers to spirituality, and adds her desire to “create things that can be
multiplied in order to have real results”. This is a clear indication that her expected
outcome includes action. Anne wants to know more about education and about the
children’s’ classes that her son is attending. She will learn from the experience of the
other participants and share with them her experience and knowledge. Anne has clearly
identified that this learning experience has a collaborative nature. Romain, Anne’s
husband, expects from this course that he will be more clear-sighted about the importance
of child education. Romain looks forward to a good study with the rest of the group and
gives education thumbs up. Hamed is uncertain what exactly to expect from this course.
He would like to complete the sequence of courses offered by the Institute, and the theme
of education is especially close to his heart.
The tutor was not directly asked about the expected outcome, however a few insights can
be gained from the initial interview I did with her before the start of session 1 (1. INT01).
By doing again the curriculum of book 3, the tutor is happy to get a different perspective
(L19). The tutor is aware that collaborative learning enhances greatly one’s own
understanding (L22).
5\.2.3 Actual outcome suggested by the participants after six sessions
The observations and the interview after session six show some development regarding
the understanding of the participants. In this activity, actual outcome is a process that
stretches over many months and years. Has the way they educate their children changed
as a result of participating in this activity? The actual outcome may be measured against
the expected outcome suggested in the curriculum and against the expected outcome
suggested by the participants.

My analysis of the short written questionnaire after session six has shown a change from
the initial expected outcome. Before that, I had not observed any participant stating an
interest in giving children’s classes, apart from the tutor, who is already giving children’s
classes. This is what the participants wrote when asked, what was the one thing they had
learned, and what they would do now:

Analysis 4: Participants’ actual outcome
Hamed (L2) feels now capable to teach children’s classes, and the course has given him
confidence and a desire to teach classes. When asked what he will do, he states (L7) that
he is open to the possibility of teaching a class if necessary. Josefa (L5) wants to apply
what she has learned to her kids and those that need education, and (L10) she hopes to do
a children’s class in the future. Romain (L8) states that he is probably available to give
children‘s classes. Anne (L4, 9) tells us about two necessary requirements for teaching:
valorising the child and render the subject interesting. As far as her action is concerned,
she will keep the content of the book in mind. The table below shows expected and actual
outcome analysed above.
The tutor (see instance 2a) has learned more than one thing (L2). She states that
repetition is the mother of knowledge, and she felt uneasy to say this, in a time
where everything should be fun and work by itself (L3). She elaborates this topic by
bringing in her son’s experience, who spent three weeks in Japan in order to practice
Judo, and who stressed the importance of repetition. I have analysed this aspect in an
earlier part on memorization, point j. The tutor has now a clearer understanding about the
concept of the ‘fear of God’ (L10). She wants to do the course on how to become a tutor,
and work on herself so as to stay authentic (true) as regards to all the people. (L13)

5\.2.4 Object of the study circle: Teaching children’s classes
The data below has allowed me to see what participants consider to be their objective in
attending the study circle. The stated object is the teaching of children’s classes. This
questionnaire was completed at the start of the first session.

Analysis 5: Participants’ objectives
In C2, Romain states the importance of children’s education. In B3, Anne takes the role
of the mother. She has to educate her child, which means for her, helping the child to
develop. In D3, Hamed hopes to play a productive role in the education of his two
children. Regarding the role as a participant, Hamed in D5 mentions his hope to be able to
contribute, without being specific. In B6, Anne shows her interest in knowing more about
education and the children’s classes. Josefa in B6 wants to realise something in terms of
spirituality and values. Hamed in D6 uses the verb ‘parcourir’ (English translation: go
through); he wishes to complete the sequence of Ruhi courses. Again in B7, Josefa uses
an action verb, wishing to “create” things that can be multiplied and have real results.
Throughout the questionnaire, participants do not mention their wish to teach children’s
classes directly. This is clearly expressed in Line 6, when they answer the question: what
are your expectations? Josefa: to realise..., Anne: to know more..., Romain: to
be more..., and Hamed: to go through....

5\.2.5 Contradictions: Being at cross-purposes
Participants of the study circle may be at cross-purposes (Russell, 2001). Primary
contradictions may arise within the elements of the activity system (Engeström, 1987).
Learning can be motivated out of a genuine interest (use value-oriented), or for the sake
of getting a grade (exchange value-oriented). This represents a contradiction between
use value and exchange value of the object of the activity. Other motives are neither use
value-oriented nor exchange value-oriented. In the context known to me, Anne may

participate in this study circle, because her husband Romain is a member of the Bahá’í
community and/or because their son Serge has started to attend a children’s class and she
wishes to be informed about what Serge is learning (excerpt 2). Another motive is the
desire to show obedience towards national and international Bahá’í institutions, since
members trust their judgment, and that Bahá’í institutions form an integral part of the
Bahá’í Faith.
In this study, participants do not usually receive a grade. A certificate of participation has
been given by the organising institute in past study circles. The motive for this seems to
be to encourage and praise participants that have completed a book. (Appendix E: livret
3, certificat de participation). More recently, being a teacher of children’s classes has
been valued as a service to society by an agency outside the Bahá’í Faith (see Appendix
F: Forum du Bénévolat). The five participants each have their motivations for taking the
course, as can be seen from the written questionnaire below, at the start of the study
circle, and from the interview with the tutor before the start of session 1.
Instance 6a: Excerpt 2 (WQ01)

> huet mech ëmmer interesséiert,
Analysis 6: Use value-oriented activity
Josefa and Romain clearly express their interest. Anne, married to Romain, a Bahá’í, is
possibly confronted with the situation that their child is attending class and as a mother
she needs to educate her child. Hamed, who is known by the group as someone coming
from a long standing Bahá’í family, makes use of the opportunity to take the course. He

writes later that he has two children and hopes to play a productive role in their education
(Q3).
The tutor (L05) has expressed her great interest and love for the education of children,
thereby clarifying that her motivation is clearly use-value-oriented.
5\.2.6 Rules being negotiated
Participants bring into the activity their own rules, norms and values. The following
observations will show this.

Formality - Politeness as a rule
Hamed is from an eastern background, brought up in a Bahá’í family. During a session,
he would mention the name of a prominent Bahá’í without the title Mister. When the
tutor makes sure that she understood the name correctly and repeats the name, Hamed
corrects her.
01      Tut:    Et puis répéter, toi, tu avais dit la dernière fois, Hamed, hm,

repetition is the mother or father ?
02      Ham:    Of knowledge, mother of knowledge. Mais c’est pas moi, c’est Furutan

qui le dit
03      Tut:    Mais c’est vrai aussi, hm (2.0) et c’est Furutan ?
04      Ham:    MOnsieur Furutan (4.0) qui d’ailleurs était pédagogue je pense
05      Tut:    Oui?
06      Ham:    Je crois qu’il était pédagogue (3.0) je crois
07      Rom:    il me semble bien que oui
Analysis 7: Formality - Politeness as a rule
The tutor has joined the Bahá’í Faith a few years ago and has grown up in Luxembourg.
She may not know Mr Furutan and the fact that he is well-known, at least by parts of the
Persian speaking Bahá’í community. The tutor remembers that Hamed talked about the
value of repetition, but she wasn’t sure how Hamed had phrased it (L1). Hamed confirms
this, but makes it clear that this concept is not from him, but comes from Furutan (L2). In
this instance, Hamed has applied the rule of formality to the tutor, but not to himself. He
emphasises Mr Furutan’s status by adding his profession (L4).

5\.2.7 Language use as a rule and a norm
Anne questioned an expression in the French text that seemed to contain a grammatical
error. The group discussed this issue for over 3 minutes.
01   Ann:    Pour moi c’est une question de langage, alors je suis assez

> surprise de lire « enseigner les (2.0) en enseignant dES
> enfants », d’après moi on enseigne aUX enfants
Analysis 8: Language use as a rule and norm
This was picked up by her, coming from a French culture, whereas the other participants
grew up either in Luxembourg or Brazil. For Anne, speaking French correctly is
important and constitutes an underlying value and an important norm. As Anne is not so
familiar with some of the Bahá’í concepts on education, she is worried that what she read
suggests an interpretation that children are considered to be objects. I analyse this part
also analysed from a monologic versus dialogic discourse perspective (Instance 15).
5\.3 Skill development: Participants negotiate tools given by the

curriculum – an emic view
Participants are expected to develop a number of skills suggested by the curriculum when
they will be carrying out children’s classes. This part starts by looking at a number of
instances where participants negotiate the mediating tools suggested in the curriculum.
In this part, I will show how participants negotiate the skill of memorizing and
understanding the Creative Word (Bahá’í Writings). Participants are encouraged to
understand and memorize themselves selected key passages. They are also encouraged to
teach the children to understand and memorize selected key passages.
Participants bring into the activity their own skills, used as tools. I look at two instances
here: code-switching in order to clarify understanding and the use of monologic and
dialogic discourse/communication.
Participants establish relationships between different elements of the activity systems. I
have looked at two relationships: the relationship between subjects, tools and division of
labour and the relationship between subjects, community and the rules, norms and values.

Skill development through mediating tools
As individuals and groups develop skills in order to achieve their objective, the process
follows stages that are fairly mechanical, with a rigid and inflexible behaviour, towards
gradually more sophisticated and adaptive behaviour, as discussed earlier.
Evidence for such behavior has been gathered from numerous observations where the
tutor offered adaptations to the tools of memorizations, the use of stories, and the use of
colouring material. She also used code-switching in the study circle as a tool for better
understanding.

Mediation
For Piaget, human beings make sense of their world by means of their mental structures.
For Vygotsky, knowledge is viewed as the internalization of social activity. Mediation
means that human beings purposefully interpose tools between them and their
environment, in order to modify it and obtain certain benefits. Mediation is a central
concept in Vygotsky’s view of cognitive development. It offers a complementary
perspective to the behaviourist view. He states that by using activity mediators, the
human being is able to modify the environment, and this is his way of interacting with
nature. Two phenomena marked the mediated relationship of humans with their
environment: the use of tools within socially organized activities and the use of language
as a cultural form of mediation.
5\.3.1 Learning through action: Explaining a game to children
The data example below follows a section in the book that talks about how to teach games
to children. Participants have just read, that in order to teach a game to kids, three things
need to be done very well: “clearly explain the purpose of the game; make sure all the
children understand how to play the game; and make sure they all feel a sense of success
when the game is over.”
21   Ham:    Exercez-vous à expliquer trois jeux différents à vos collaborateurs

((giggles))
22   Tut:    ((giggles))
23   Ann:    ((looks up to Hamed, while smiling))
24   Tut:    Alors tu nous expliques ((giggles while talking))

25   Ham:    (je connais pas de jeux)
26   Tut:    Tu pourrais nous expliquer le jeu « porter le malade » et nous on va

> porter Romain à la cuisine ((giggles))((« carry the sick » )) is a
> game that was introduced and explained in section 10))
27   Rom:    D’accord
28   Ann:    Il faut vraiment le faire ?
29   Ham:    on a compris(2.0)
Analysis 9: Learning through action: explaining a game to children
After Hamed (L21) has read the question that he should explain three different games to
the collaborators, the tutor (L24) asks Hamed to explain. Hamed (L25) probably says that
he doesn’t know any games and the tutor goes on asking Hamed to explain the game they
had just seen in detail in the previous section. While Josefa is busy looking and possibly
writing in her course book, Romain is happy to be part of the game that the tutor proposes
and Anne (L28) is wondering whether it is really necessary to do the game. Hamed’s
response (L29) is simply to state: “we have understood”. After a two second pause, he
goes on reading the next question.
The Bahá’í concept of learning includes 4 aspects that are interlinked: study, action,
reflection on action and consultation (Lample, 2009). This process of learning includes
action and therefore it is suggested that action favours learning. In this instance, the tutor
and Hamed do not take up their role as being responsible for their own learning, as stated
in the first study course (Ruhi Institute, 1999, p. 1). An opportunity to learn through
action has been missed in this sequence.
5\.3.2 Colouring activities for children
The tutor has just read section 13, the last activity for the children: colouring pictures.
The children are given an opportunity to “test their artistic capacities and develop their
concepts of beauty”.
20   Tut:    Donc les coloriages sont ici hm ((flicks through the pages of the

book)) (2.0) ((the participants also flick through their books))
21   Tut:    Mais moi je dois leur dire que ça n’éveille pas trop les sentiments

> de beauté ((she stresses the words « sentiments de beauté » with
> giggles))
22   Rom:    ((giggles))

23   Tut:    Je sais pas ce que vous en pensez? (2.0)
24   Rom:    Pour la plupart je suis d’accord avec toi (2.0)
25   Ann:    Mais il faut les colorier c’est peut-être (plus) ((raises her hand))
26   Rom:    Justement, voilà, ils ont tout misé là-dessus. ((giggles by Anne,

tutor and Josefa)) (2.0))
27   Tut:    Enfin c’est vrai il y a des enfants qui aiment colorier, mais on

> trouve aussi d’autres activités peut-être plus créatifs que enfin
> moi je suis pas trop pour le coloriage
28   Ham:    Il y a toujours la situation qui va avec c’est une leçon en même

29   Tut:    Mais on peut aussi trouver d’autres (1.0) par exemple pour la

30   Tut:    voilà?
31   Ann:    (ceux qui ont) de l’imagination de
32   Tut:    oui On peut se débrouiller comme ça ils aiment bien mais on peut

plus varier si on
Analysis 10: Colouring activities for children
The tutor (L21) doesn’t find the colouring pictures too beautiful and seeks (L23) the
opinion of the group. Romain (L24) mostly agrees with her while Anne (L25) suggests
that the colouring might add some beauty to it, and Romain (L26) agrees. The tutor (L27)
takes the voice of the children that like colouring and she has noticed (L29) that they do
and it surprises her. The tutor shares an example (L29) how she made the activity more
creative, but also mentions that not all children have material means to do the activity
differently. She summarizes the topic (L32) by stating that it is possible to get by as
suggested, and children like it or it is possible to add variation to the activity. The tutor
suggests that participants should be flexible and according to their circumstances and
preferences, adapts the activity so that it is enjoyable and helps the children with the
understanding of the quotation.

5\.3.3 Appropriate selection of stories for children
In the example below, the tutor comments on the 15 stories suggested for children in the
curriculum. She shares her experiences about the stories to be learned and to be shared
with the children and how some stories for the very young (aged 4) have not been suitable
in her children’s class.
01    Tut:    C’est quand même très pratique, hm. Surtout quand on commence,

c’est rassurant d’avoir quelque chose …sous la main.
02    Tut:    Mais bon je dois dire, il y a parfois des histoires, … comme j’ai

> les tout petits de 4, 5 ans, par exemple la première leçon, c’est
> sur les <inaudible.1>, et cette histoire là, je n’ai pas
> <inaudible.1>, de la faire. Elle parle donc des gens qui étaient
> contre les bahá’ís, des musulmans, et si tu parles à des enfants
> de 4 ans sur les religions, c’est …, ils auraient rien compris
> hm, alors on a pris une autre histoire, simplement.
03    Tut:    Non il faut aussi parfois prendre une autre histoire, on trouve

aussi tout plein d’histoires sur internet.

Analysis 11: Appropriate selection of stories for children
The tutor stresses the benefit of having stories in the curriculum (L1) and emphasizes the
need to adapt the stories to the circumstances of the children that one is teaching (L2).
She makes a brief reference to the internet as a pool for many stories, thereby
encouraging participants to be open and flexible, and suggesting new tools in order to
achieve the desired objective (L3). The curriculum, which can be viewed as a pool of
tools for the education of children, is adapted to the needs and circumstances of the
children, who are at the heart of education and learning.
5\.3.4 Understanding and Memorization

Comprehension: inappropriate learning task
In this excerpt, participants discuss the difficulty and usefulness of filling in missing text,
as a tool to gain a better understanding of certain essential texts.
Instance 12: Excerpt 19 (INTS5E2)
01   Ann:     Maintenant que je feuille, quand même, il faut que je te

> dise, … mais ces trucs à trou là, ou il faut trouver les
> bonnes réponses, ... c’est très embêtant en fait, c’est pas
> très ... C’est la répétition un peu bébête, je sais pas,

02   Jos:   Tu sais c’est quoi ça, car plusieurs copines m’ont raconté la

03   Ann:   Ah d’accord, mais dans le Ruhi 1 ça m’avait déjà BEAUCOUP

04   Tut:   Donc c’est pas mieux dans le Ruhi 3 ?
05   Jos:   Peut-être il fallait changer un peu, dans la façon un peu

Analysis 12: Comprehension: inappropriate learning task
Anne (L1) brings up the subject on filling in the missing text, and how she finds it a bit
childish. Josefa (L2) brings in the voices of her friends and that they had told her the same
story, and she suggests changing it to a more adult way (L5). Anne (L03) brings to light a
past unease with the material and this highlights the influence of historicity in an activity
system. Romain (L10) states that it took him 10 years to come back to participating in this
sort of activity (historicity), as it was for him a great disturbance. Romain (L15)
recognizes that although participants are not happy with the tool of filling in the missing
text, the group has not found an alternative, new way of remembering the texts. The tutor
(L18) suggests that it is ok to fill in the missing text if it is not too long. Hamed (L23)
confirms this and Romain adds the argument that participants didn’t know each other that
well at the beginning. This has made the exercise even more awkward. Romain indicates
here how the participants have got to know each other better after spending five sessions
together. This last element seems to indicate that the participants in the activity have
learned something about each other. This indicates that a group has more chances of
learning together, when they get to know each other.
This passage highlights the benefit of questioning current practices openly. It shows
how the other participants contribute towards possibly changing an existing practice that
seems unessential. Participants resisted using certain tools proposed in the curriculum.
Most participants during the interview after session five voiced their unhappiness about
filling in missing text, as a tool to gain a better understanding of certain texts. The
interview after session five confirmed that the proposed tool in the curriculum, which
consists of filling in the missing text, seemed too childish to some participants. I may
question the participants in further research as to what alternative tools they come up with
in order to become more familiar with essential text passages.

Negotiating: Memorization skill
Participants are encouraged to understand and memorize themselves selected key
passages. They are also encouraged to teach the children to understand and memorize
selected key passages.
I present here some document examples from the curriculum, video-recorded data
samples from the two sessions, an interview data sample, and a written questionnaire data
sample, all related to the subject of memorization and understanding. The data examples
are presented together, followed by the analysis.
Instance 13a: Data: Document 15 (curriculum)
The methodology of the children’s classes combines different activities, all focused on the
principle goal of motivating the development of attitudes and spiritual qualities. All these
activities revolve around the Creative Word, which alone has the power to awaken spiritual
susceptibilities in the children, and a strong emphasis is placed memorizing the Creative Word.
Memorization has an even greater effect if what is being memorized is well understood. For this
reason, each lesson includes material to help children understand the meaning of the quotation, as
well as activities to help further this understanding. Unfortunately, at this point, there is not an
abundance of songs, games and stories which directly reinforce the ideas presented in the
quotations to be memorized. It is hoped that, in the future, many more such activities will be
created and compiled for the use of Bahá’í children’s class teachers (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 3)
Instance 13b: Data: Document 16 (curriculum)
Unit 1: Section 1 [...] By studying the following quotations of Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá you
will begin to appreciate your work as a children’s class teacher. It will help you to memorize these
words and have them always in mind when you teach. [...]
Section 4 Now, memorize the above words of Bahá'u'lláh [...].
Section 8 [...] Read and memorize the following words of Bahá'u'lláh: [...]
Section 10 [...] Memorize the following words of Bahá'u'lláh: [...]
Instance 13c: Data: Document 17 (curriculum)
Some principles of Bahá’í education – Section 3
After you have explained to the children the meaning of a quotation, the next step is to help them
memorize it. Surely, in your life you have memorized many quotations and poems. How can this
be done? Once the meaning of a quotation is understood, memorizing it is very simple. The
quotation is divided into parts and you begin by memorizing the first part. Later, the second part
is learned, and then both parts are repeated together. You continue in this way until the entire
quotation is learned by heart. For example in order to learn the prayer in Section 2, you begin with
“Oh God, guide me ...,” and ask the children, sometimes individually and other times as a group,
to repeat the words. Then you combine “Oh God, guide me” with “protect me ...,” repeat the two
phrases together, then add “...make of me a shining lamp...,” and so on with each phrase until the

end of the prayer. Once the whole group of children has repeated the entire prayer, each child is
patiently helped to recite the prayer by heart.
Undoubtedly, as a conscientious Bahá’í teacher, you will with to begin your new tasks by
teaching yourself. Therefore, when you look at the 15 lessons for children presented further on in
this unit, dedicate some time to studying the meaning of the quotations, thinking about examples
given to clarify the meaning for the children, and memorizing the quotations (Ruhi Institute,
1995, p. 27)

Analysis 13: Understanding and Memorization
a) The Ruhi 3 book curriculum suggests in the introduction to the collaborators
(document 15) the understanding and memorization of passages from Bahá’í texts as tools
for the development of attitudes and spiritual qualities. Songs, games and stories are used
to reinforce the concepts presented in the quotations to be memorized.
b) This document presents four different passages where participants are encouraged to
memorize passages. Further analysis below will show that neither the tutor, nor the
participants, who should be responsible for their own learning (see document 7: “The
responsibility of learning rests with each participant”) memorize these passages during
the sessions or suggest that they should be memorized.
c) This passage explains how the participants, the future teachers of children’s classes,
should help the children memorize Bahá’í texts. The text makes participants aware that
they need to teach themselves before teaching the children, and understand and memorize
the quotations.
d) Romain shares how useful it is to have memorized things, as you carry them with you
all the time.
e) The tutor and Hamed relate repetition to memorization and the acquisition of
knowledge, and by bringing it up, emphasize the use and importance of memorization.
f) The tutor repeats what is stated in the course book; to explain to the children the words
that are to be memorized.
g) The tutor (L12) brings again to the group that Hamed mentioned how repetition was
the mother of knowledge, this time in relation to learning how to play and remember how
to play games (L10).
h) Anne found memorizing through filling the gap childish and quite boring. She wonders
how it could bring her something.
i) Josefa wishes to do the book over and over again (L05). Romain (L08) wants to read
the course again in order to deepen the children-teacher relations. Anne wishes to keep
the book in mind.
j) The tutor (L03) brings out the voice of Hamed, one of the participants, and through him
the voice of Mr Furutan, an imminent Bahá’í and pedagogue, and the concept of

repetition as the basis for knowledge as something she learned during this study circle. As
she is situating herself in the present cultural context (historicity), where everything
should be fun, and should go automatically, she did not wish to insist on repetition. She
(L04-06) then brings in the voice of her son to reinforce her understanding on repetition.
Her son spent 3 weeks in Japan and told him about the importance of repetition, as he
participated in a training course with the national Japanese judo master. She (L07) then
brings in the voice of Ken Robinson’s book entitled: “In my element”. The book is about
finding the things one is comfortable in, then train endlessly, and then realising that the
training is pure joy and happiness.

Memorization that combines texts, sessions, interviews and questionnaires
Document: The curriculum encourages the understanding and memorization of passages
from Bahá’í texts (a). As the participants complete the first unit, they are asked four
times, in the course book, to memorize short quotations (b). Then, in section 3, an entire
paragraph explains to the participants how they may help the children memorize Bahá’í
texts. The paragraph also mentions that before all else, they should teach themselves and
they should memorize the quotations (c).
Sessions: The following 4 session excerpts (d-g) show how participants value repetition
and memorization as a tool to acquire knowledge, that it is necessary to explain the words
to children, and that the repetition of games enables children to get better at it and to
enjoy them more.
Interviews and questionnaires: For Anne (h), it seemed a boring and childish repetition
to fill in the missing text. This was for a specific tool. Overall, in the questionnaire (i),
Anne wishes to keep the book in mind, Josefa wants to the book over and over again and
Romain wants to read the course again in order to deepen the children-teacher relations.
The tutor start to answer the question as to what she had learned by bringing out the
voices of Hamed, and through him Mr Furutan, the voice of her son, and through him the
voice of a Japanese judo master, and the voice of Ken Robinson and his book. For her,
repetition and memorization of the things one feels comfortable with can bring
tremendous joy and happiness.

5\.3.5 Participants bring to the activity their own skills

Code-switching
In this excerpt, as the participants share their understanding about the concept of the ‘fear
of God’, the tutor makes reference to the German word for ‘crainte de Dieu’.
01   Tut:    La parole allemande pour crainte de Dieu, c’est Ehrfurcht, donc il

> y a un peu moins de peur, et beaucoup de respect aussi, non? enfin
> pou (mon) sentiment Ehrfurcht
02   Rom:    Hm
03   Tut:    non?
04           (2.0)
05   Tut:    C’est la crainte mais aussi un énorme respect
06   Pia:    C’est pas seulement peur
07   Tut:    C’est pas seulement peur
Analysis 14: Code-switching
The tutor brings into the group the meaning of the German translation for the word “fear”
(L1), thereby expanding the meaning of this concept for the other participants, which was
acknowledged by Romain (L2) and Pia (L6). Knowing more than one language is seen
here as a tool, allowing for comparison and widening of understanding the concept of the
fear of God. The tutor is more familiar with the German vocabulary, due to her practice
and work with children.

Monologic and dialogic discourse - communication
My observations have shown how participants use different tools, according to their
cultural and historical background. In the following transcript, Anne was concerned about
a language issue. In the French text of the curriculum there seemed to be a grammatical
error that led to a possible different interpretation as to how we look at education. The
participant seemed to use in this instance a monological, rather than a dialogical discourse
(Wells, 2001). Idan talks about the use of monological communication (Idan, 2010). This
concern was not shared with other members, whose first language is not French.
It is shown in Anne’s use of monologic discourse/communication at the beginning of
session 1, excerpt 3. After reading section 1, page 7 of the curriculum, participants are
asked to decide whether a number of statements are true or false. The second question
states: Lorsque nous enseignons les enfants, nous adorons Dieu. vrai  faux

Before line 1 of the transcript, the tutor asks the participants whether they have any
reflexions or questions.
01   Anne       Pour moi c’est une question de de langage, alors je suis

> assez surprise de lire « enseigner les (..) en enseignant
> dES enfants », d’après moi on enseigne aUX enfants
02   Tutor      hm
03   Anne       Ça revient (2.0) « lorsque nous enseignons les enfants »
04              ((looks and points at the book on Romain’s lap))
05              Ça me semble bizarre, alors je ne sais pas si cela

28              ((Romain looks at Anne, both giggling, Josefa is leaning

her head to look closer in the book at the text))
29   Hamed      ˂inaudible.2˃

45              Hm hm ((not sure by whom this comment was made))

> chance d’enseigner, d’adorer Dieu tout le temps (giggles).
> C’est de choses que je sais mais cette phrase m’a touché
> aujourd’hui plus que d’autres fois.

Analysis 15: monologic - dialogic discourse
In line 1, Anne communicates in a monological way. Her statement is clear and allows no
room for dialogue. The tutor wonders in line 2, and Anne continues her reasoning as she
finds another incident. She is convinced that it is not correct French stating: “nous
enseignons les enfants”. She is concerned with the way of saying things, as in line 5 and
30\. In line 7, Anne tends to go toward a dialogic discourse, when she states how the
sentence should be written, adding: ‘apparently’. In line 12, she opens two possibilities.
Although she is not sure how to interpret her difficulty, she doesn’t ask the other
participants for their advice.
The tutor communicates in a dialogical manner. This is visible in line 6, when she makes
sure she understands what is being stated, in line 11 when she confirms that she
understands. In line 13, she makes use of the tool of other languages as a way to resolve
this issue. In line 46, she concludes this intervention by Anne by relating her own
experience as she is able to teach every day.

5\.3.6 Relationships between elements of the activity system

Relationship between subjects, tools and division of labour
When participants are able to use certain tools, in the pursuit of the object of the activity,
for example being able to play the guitar, this can influence the division of labour. The
participant who plays the guitar may bring it to the activity, in order to practice and sing
songs with the rest of the group. The figure below highlights this relationship between the
subjects, the tools they use and the division of labour.

Figure 4: Relationships between subjects, tools and division of labour
The example below illustrates the negotiation between participants as to their musical
skills and the availability of instruments in order to prepare the musical part for the
following session. Anne has just read the passage that encourages participants to sing
spiritual songs with the children which fill their hearts with happiness. The text on page
27 includes a quotation by 'Abdu'l-Bahá:
The art of music is divine and effective. It is the food of the soul and spirit. Through the power
and charm of music the spirit of man is uplifted. It has wonderful sway and effect in the hearts of
children, for their hearts are pure, and melodies have great influence in them. The latent talents
with which the hearts of these children are endowed will find expression through the medium of
music (Abdu’l-Bahá, 1982, p. 52).
The curriculum goes on to suggest that participants learn the songs of the 15 lessons of
this unit well, either from the tutor or with the help of a cassette.

139    Tut:    Alors la prochaine fois c’est leçon musique, ok
140    Ann:    [On peut compter sur toi Romain ((giggles))
Analysis 16: Relationship between subjects, tools and division of labour
The tutor (L037) shares with the group her experience how singing and the sound of the
guitar helps the children to concentrate, to calm down and to listen. In lines 069-76,
Hamed, Romain and the tutor negotiate who should play the guitar for the next session.
Romain clarifies the difference between having a guitar and not having played it for three
years (L76). Between lines 77 and 131, the tutor leads a discussion where she is asking
the participants about whether they play any instruments (see Appendix: Session 4,

Excerpt 13). In lines 132-140, the tutor concludes the topic by leading to the next session,
which could be a musical lesson. Anne is suggesting that Romain will play the piano
(L140). Please note that we are at the home of Anne and Romain and that the sessions
have all taken place at their home. Here, the home also serves as a mediating tool, as
musical instruments are stored and available, that otherwise might be difficult to
transport. In this excerpt the tutor is clearly negotiating the relationship between the
subjects, the tools and the division of labour, as she is asking who plays what instruments.
She stresses the concentrating effect that singing and playing the guitar has on children
(L037).

Relationship between subjects, community and rules, norms and values
Participants bring with them their own historicity and multivoicedness that includes
certain rules, norms and values pertaining to the community in which they live, lived in
and were part of. This relationship can be seen in the figure below.

Figure 5: Relationships between subjects, community and rules
Participants have just heard the quote read by Hamed, [Regard man as a mine rich in gems of
inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to
benefit therefrom.] and the curriculum suggests that they think about some questions and to
consult about these ideas in the group.

001    Tut:    Qu’est-ce-que c’est les pierres précieuses?
002    Jos:    C’est les valeurs, toujours, (3.0) c’est de mettre en pratique

Analysis 17: Relationship between subjects, community, norms and values
As the tutor starts the discussion by asking the participants what they consider to be those
precious gems (L1), Josefa responds by emphasizing that it is the values that need to be
practised daily and giving priority to the value of education (L2). Romain continues by
enumerating some values and how they represent the bare minimum in order to have at
least some social cohesion (L3). He then makes a relationship between the increase of
complexity in knowledge and education and the importance of developing humanity’s
knowledge, this hidden treasure in us and in our children. Here it seems that Romain is
identifying humanity’s collective knowledge as part of the hidden treasure, a wording
borrowed from the quote read just before the discussion by Hamed. Josefa then attempts
to clarify what Romain stated by asking whether the more one evolves, the more one
finds that (L4). Then the tutor attempts to answer Josefa’s question to Romain by stating
that the more we evolve the more it is important to develop humanity’s collective
knowledge and the hidden treasure within us (L5). Romain confirms this with a yes. He
then gives the example of the portable phone and adding another relationship by stating
that 50 years ago we were connected differently and that the more real physical
connections we have, the more new connections we have (L6). Hamed suggests the word
interactions (L7). Romain adopts the word from Hamed and continues his relationship by
stating that more important it is to have values for everyone and the most amount of
values possible (L8). Josefa follows on without waiting by also giving now an example,
in order “to really live this situation of true values”. When she goes back
to her family in Brazil, who lives on the fields, and when she goes to the neighbour, and
visits them, they have no formal education, there are people who have so many values,
and “how beautiful” this is, and that there is a different way of passing this message.
And sometimes Josefa would go back in order “to have some strength for a world
that can stay so empty” (L9). Romain confirms twice with a yes that he understood
(L10) and Josefa continues by making a relationship with the past and how the world
today moves too quickly and that they live those values very poorly (L11).
In the chosen example, it is evident how Josefa relates her values to a community she
knows well and respects for the values they seem to show without any formal education
and her unease with the world she is experiencing currently, a world that is moving too

fast for her and with too little values. Romain brings to the discussion his view of the
world that is becoming more and more interconnected through communication
technology, a world that is developing knowledge, requiring a minimum of common
values, so that a minimum of social cohesion can be possible.
This instance shows how subjects from different communities have different rules and
have difficulties to communicate their perspective of a given issue. Added awareness by
the participants how each of them brings historicity and multivoicedness into the
discussions brings added understanding. Questions may be asked to Josefa in order to get
a better understanding as to what these values are that she appreciates so much and as to
who brought and taught those values to the indigenous people in Brazil.
5\.4 Learning Processes in the activity system
In the first part, I describe a Bahá’í perspective on learning that looks at six distinct
topics: the goal of learning; learning itself; the role of the student and of the teacher; the
concept of knowledge, and knowing. Part two starts by analysing what participants say as
they look back on their development after five sessions. Part three examines how the
participants adopt a research view as they take an interest in the research. Part four
addresses the four central questions on learning: who is learning, why do people learn,
what do they learn, and how do they learn? Part five looks at the possibilities for
expansive learning.
5\.4.1 Learning: a Bahá’í perspective
It is helpful to view learning as being partly a process of acquisition and partly a process
of participation. A Bahá’í concept of learning is found in the content of the curriculum
and other sources (Lample, 2009), suggesting that learning is partly acquired (for
example: memorization, suggested in Ruhi book 3, page 3) and partly a process of
participation in an activity (for example: sharing understanding in a study circle, as
described in Ruhi book 3, page 1). Based on Sfard’s (1998) table, I have added a column
that suggests a Bahá’í concept of learning that includes both acquisition and participation
metaphors.

(AM and PM)
My findings described in the column D are based on my research into some Bahá’í
principles and in the course of preparing this study.
1 Topic: Goal of learning
Instance 18: Data: Document 2

> [...] In Bahá'í terms, the process of one’s individual development and fulfilment is tied to
> the centering of one’s energies on the betterment of humankind and serving the needs of
> the community and the larger society. [...] Thus, Bahá'ís are actively engaged in
> developing knowledge, skills, and spiritual insights that enable them to act as effective
> human resources and which are vital to the integrated process of personal and social
> transformation (Bahá’í International Community, 2010 Study Classes).

Analysis 18: Goal of learning
In this document, emphasis is put on individual development, linked to the purpose of
community building. The goal of learning is clearly defined: develop knowledge, skills
and spiritual insights, so that they can be used for the betterment of the society at large.
Individual enrichment is combined with community building and both are interdependent.
2 Topic: Learning
Instance 19a: Data: Document 2

> [...] Bahá'ís are actively engaged in developing knowledge, skills, and spiritual insights
> that enable them to act as effective human resources and which are vital to the integrated

Instance 19b: Data: Document 5

> Individual interpretation rarely remains wholly personal. One studies the teachings

Instance 19d: Data: Document 14

> The Independent Investigation of Truth
> Baha'u'llah emphasizes the fundamental obligation of human beings to acquire knowledge
> with their "own eyes and not through the eyes of others." One of the main sources of
> conflict in the world today is the fact that many people blindly and uncritically follow

> various traditions, movements, and opinions. God has given each human being a mind
> and the capacity to differentiate truth from falsehood. If individuals fail to use their
> reasoning capacities and choose instead to accept without question certain opinions and
> ideas, either out of admiration for or fear of those who hold them, then they are neglecting
> their basic moral responsibility as human beings. Moreover, when people act in this way,
> they often become attached to some particular opinion or tradition and thus intolerant of
> those who do not share it. Such attachments can, in turn, lead to conflict. History has
> witnessed conflict and even bloodshed over slight alterations in religious practice, or a

> individual to know why he or she adheres to a given ideology or doctrine.
> Bahá'ís believe that, as there is only one reality, all people will gradually discover its
> different facets and will ultimately come to a common understanding and unity, provided
> they sincerely seek after truth [...] (Bahá’í International Community, 2011b)
Analysis 19: Learning
Skills are actively acquired and developed, and learners become participants through
collective learning in the form of study circles. In document 13, learning is described as a
process of action, reflection, consultation and study. Document 14 suggests that in order
to learn and to acquire knowledge, it is necessary to search independently for the truth.
Reitz-Koncebovski proposes that the independent search for truth should also be made the
first principle of learning and teaching in school (2006, p. 195). Learning encompasses
the acquisition of skills and the participation in an activity.
3 Topic: Role of the student
Instance 20a: Data: Document 6

> [...] Perhaps the learned Bahá’í is more like the “scout” who helps to guide an expedition
> on a journey into unexplored territory. This role involves investigating the unknown and
> generating and applying knowledge to contribute to the success of the mission at hand. It
> is someone who participates actively in the journey, but whose specialized knowledge,
> skills, and experience informs various aspects of the struggle to make progress:
> constructive perspectives into the past, present, and future; insight and technical capacity
> for ongoing study of the Text; problem posing and problem solving; the defining of
> culture and intercultural relations. On this journey, the learned individual/scout does not
> have authority, and, while making a vital contribution, like any other participant is fallible
> and learns over time [...] (Lample, 2009, p. 152).
Instance 20b: Data: Document 1

> [...]Rather than having the participants be passive listeners to a wide array of unconnected
> talks, the Ruhi Institute materials seek to engage the friends fully in the process of
> learning (International Teaching Centre, 2000, p. 5).

Instance 20c: Data: Document 7

> The Ruhi Institute uses the term “collaborators” to refer to all who study, teach or apply
> its courses, wherever they may reside. These participants are indeed collaborators,
> because all share the Institute’s purpose: to use the courses as means of serving the Cause
> and promoting the well-being of humanity. In every study group there is always a more
> experienced person who acts as a tutor. The other members of the group constitute the
> “students” who seek the tutor’s help with their studies. However, it is clearly understood
> by all participants that they are engaged in a reciprocal process, one in which everyone
> learns. The responsibility of learning rests with each participant. It is the student who
> undertakes the active work of learning. The tutor facilitates this process and also gains
> new insights into the material. The relationship is not that of a learned one with a group of
> ignorant people (Ruhi Institute, 1999, p. 1).
Instance 20d: Data: Document 8

> [...] One of the basic concepts discussed in the unit is the nobility of man. It is essential
> for the participants in the course -- future teachers of children -- to understand the impact
> this extremely important principle will have on the kind of education he or she will
> eventually offer. By the mere acceptance that each student is a "mine rich in gems of
> inestimable value", the teacher of a beginning children's class takes an enormous step
> away from current educational practices. Yet the acceptance of this concept is not, in
> itself, sufficient. Baha'i teachers should also be familiar with the nature of spiritual
> qualities and know enough about human talents and capacities to be able to discover these
> gems in their students and actively help polish them. They also have to be fully aware of
> the importance of helping children develop habits and patterns of behavior that are in
> keeping with a Baha'i way of life [...] (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 1–2).

Analysis 20: Role of the student
The student in document 6 explores new territory and generates and applies knowledge
that contributes to the success of the objective. The student in document 1 actively
participates in the activity. The student is defined in document 7 as a collaborator who
studies, teaches, applies the courses, and is responsible for his or her learning. Document
8 shows how the student is considered a noble person, as a mine rich in gems of
inestimable value. The student listens and is attentive to new information, constructs the
information into knowledge according to his understanding and his filters of culture,
language, values, beliefs, attitudes, expectations, and intentions. This activity may take
place in an activity with others.

4 Topic: Role of the teacher
Instance 21: Data: Document 7 (see above) Document 8 (see above)
Analysis 21: Role of the teacher
The teacher in document 7 is seen as someone who collaborates, together with the learner
in a common project. The teacher is the expert, facilitates the active work of learning, but
the process of learning is also reciprocal, “one in which everyone learns” (document 7).
The teacher in document 8 is seen as someone that knows about human talents and
capacities to be able to discover these gems in their students and actively helps to polish
them. He provides help and assists, facilitates the activity and mediates between
collaborators.
5 Topic: Concept of knowledge
Instance 22: Data: Document 9

> A Problem of Knowledge
> [...] there is a process of understanding and action in which the Bahá’í community
> explores reality, grows in comprehension and knowledge, unifies thought, and contributes
> to transforming the world in accordance with the truths expressed in Bahá’u’lláh’s
> Revelation (Lample, 2009, p. 161). [...] the acquisition of knowledge through science and
> religion is the motive force driving progress; and that acquisition of knowledge must be
> associated with action and reflection on action [...] (Lample, 2009, p. 189).

Analysis 22: Concept of knowledge
Document 9 states that science and religion are the two sources of knowledge and that if
we are to acquire knowledge, it should be done through action and reflection on action. A
Bahá’í perspective on the concept of knowledge proposes an ontologically objective
reality that is beyond the reach of scientific investigation. The scientific source of
knowledge allows for the exploration of the universe, physical and human reality, facts,
patterns and the laws of creation that can be known by the human mind. The religious
source of knowledge allows for a revelation that can be known, the revealed Word of
God, the Book and its authoritative interpretation. Further details on this perspective can
be found in the Appendix C: Perspective on Reality (Lample, 2009, p. 121).
6 Topic: Knowing
Instance 23: Data: Document 10

> The Bahá’í Writings place definite limits on understanding. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that
> human beings cannot know the essence of a thing, but only its qualities. He also states
> that all ways of human knowing—reason, tradition, the senses, and inspiration—are
> fallible, and therefore must be checked against one another. Science, then, is extolled for
> its powers of empirical investigation and reason, but its limitations are also
> acknowledged. Religion takes its place along with science as a means for investigating

> reality, educating humanity, and contributing to the advancement of civilization (Lample,
> 2009, p. 175).

Analysis 23: Knowing
Document 10 states that human beings are limited in knowing the essence of things; that
our ways of knowing are fallible and must be checked against one another; that the
limitations of science must be acknowledged and that along with science, religion must be
used for investigating reality. While we acquire knowledge, we belong to a social reality
that is created, changes and evolves constantly through participating in meaningful
activities.
5\.4.2 Participants look back on their development
This study has been carried out over a period of several months, from December 2010
until July 2011. While six sessions had taken place, two more sessions remained to be
done at the end of July. Earlier in the analysis, I looked at the actual outcome suggested
by the participant after six sessions, asking them what was the one thing they had learned,
and what they would do now. The following analysis looks at the interview carried out
after five sessions, where I asked them about their development. As this was a group
interview, participants listened to what the others in the group were saying about their
own development and this had an impact on the statements made by the subsequent
participants. As I was present for the interview, I guided the discussion by asking them
about their development.

Analysis 24: Learning and development
Hamed starts by saying that he has developed or changed (L1), the development he has
seen (L2), and the development that is taking place (L5). This development is strongly
connected to the context of having two children (L3). Hamed knew the concepts but up to
now they remained theoretical (L3). He had heard over a thousand times the concept that
man should be regarded as a mine rich in gems, but that this were but words. By
visualising his own child in this context, he became aware, it gave him joy, the words
became beautiful and his heart was beating a bit faster (L11).
In these few lines, Hamed illustrates his experience of how a new element in his life, his
child, creates a new context that gives meaning to learning and promotes development.
Words have become beautiful and concepts have taken on new meaning.
Josefa mentions with the voice of ‘we’ how the good is transforming the bad or evil and
that this is very difficult (L6). Work is needed to pass on to our children, being like a
channel, and this work is part of development. It includes constant listening, support
people, our children, and first of all ourselves (L7). The work of educating ourselves
takes a long time and is not easy (L8). Josefa sees in the history of Bahá’u’lláh a model

that she wants to apply in her daily life, and this is not easy. Again, she takes the voice of
‘we’ to highlight this point (L10).
Josefa emphasizes the need for transformation, the need to become a channel in order to
pass a message to others and the fact that this process requires hard work.
It is now Anne’s turn and she links her development to a better knowledge within the
group, to the creation of certain habits, the sharing of different ideas about education and
what one should be doing and the time it takes to integrate these ideas. She states that her
development is developing and when this is linked to the education of one’s child, one is
only a parent, trying one’s best and taking inspiration from good methods from many
sources, and that anyhow, it is always beneficial to learn (L12).
For Anne, development is expressed in the group cohesion, facing the similar situation of
educating one’s child with others in the group. She states that her development is
developing, through participating in the activity of the study circle and she trusts the
value of learning.
Romain follows Anne’s contribution by confirming his joy to be with the group and his
confidence in everything related to the children’s classes as their son Serge attends them.
His vision of how the class is organised has changed, he knows much better, he knows, he
has a better comprehension of what is taking place not only where he lives, but almost
everywhere else in the world. This is for him amazing, that today one is engaged in a
learning process and that this learning comes from a pure positive source, spread out the
world over and that it is a unique historical phenomenon, and this clearly is a
development (L13).
When I asked Romain to speak also about his own development, he confirms that he has
developed, by making reference to Hamed and the values he has received since his early
age. Romain sees himself as being part of a learning process that cannot but affect the
person engaged in such a process. It gives him courage to take a certain direction and
linking personal development to planetary development (L14).
While Romain mentions that his son takes part in children’s classes, and that now he
knows more about this aspect, he focuses mainly on being part of a global enterprise, and
he relates increased understanding of the context and the “map” to an increased
understanding of ”directing oneself in a certain direction”.

The tutor, being at the beginning of her activity as a tutor, compares herself with another
tutor, where she participated in a number of study circles, stating how she finds it difficult
to know how to let participants speak, to make the group move forward when needed, and
to know when to wait. She sees her development as learning to be a tutor, to be patient,
how to manage the group and recognizing that each group is different (L16). She is more
concerned with the manner of tutoring as to the content. At present, she completes a study
circle with two different tutors that have two different approaches, she pays attention how
they advance the group, when they intervene and she wants to learn by taking them as
models so that she can find her role as a tutor, and a learner (L18, 20). She compares
herself also with the other participants, some of them being a Bahá’í much longer then
herself, and being probably more knowledgeable about the history then her (L22). This
unease seems to come from within herself, due to her own fear (L24).
The tutor expresses her development in a learning mode, comparing herself to other more
experienced tutors, being aware of her own shortcomings, and being concerned about the
form the study circle is taking, and the way she can learn alongside with the participants.
5\.4.3 Participants’ interest in this research: adopting a research view
During the course of the sessions, I have taken the time to describe to the group some of
the approaches used for this study. At this stage it is not clear, whether this description
has helped participants in their study. Sharing my observations throughout the study and
during the interview after session 5, participants wanted to know more about my research
and were very happy that I decided to carry out this research project. I received the
following note with the initial answers to the questionnaire at the start of session 1. At
that time, I had already shared some initial thoughts about my research with the
participants.
Instance 25a: Excerpt 5 (N0)
01   Rom:       Salut Jean-Marie
02   Rom:       Ech gratuléieren dech. Dat mess du wierklech gutt. Ganz flott

Proaktivitéit, a gutt Organisatioun
Below is an instance where two participants express their interest in the research I
conduct with the study circle.
Instance 25b: Excerpt 17 (INTS5E0)
01   Res:       Si vous voulez, on peut faire un petit tour, chacun s’exprime un

petit peu. Moi, je peux aussi dire quelques minutes, où est-ce-que

j’en suis avec la recherche
02           (2.0)
03   Res:    Ça va?
04   ?       Toi d’abord ((giggles))
05   Tut:    Oui ça nous intéresse
06   Ann:    Mais oui
Analysis 25: Participants adopting a research view
In excerpt 5, Romain congratulates the researcher, supposedly for his research initiative
and approach. In excerpt 17, the tutor and Anne verbally show that they are interested to
know more about my research with their study circle. The tutor speaks here with the voice
of the other participants: “it interests us”. This indicates that participants approve of the
use of scientific methods. An opportunity for learning has thus been created. Additional
interviews may provide more tangent answers, as to whether activity theory as a method
has afforded participants with a tool for learning and action.
5\.4.4 Analysis of the study circle: four central questions on learning
Any theory of learning needs to address four central questions: Who are learning, how are
they defined and located? Why do they learn, what makes them make the effort? What do
they learn, what are the contents and outcomes of learning? How do they learn, what are
the key actions or processes of learning? I have already answered some of the questions
in the description of the study circle as an activity system, and refer the reader to that
section.

Who are learning, how are they defined and located? (Subjects and Community)
The participants are engaged in a process of collective learning in a shared domain of
human endeavour and they form a community of practice. Participants also belong to
other activity systems. This constellation of activity systems is different for each
participant in the activity analysed. Activity systems that are connected to the activity of
the collaborative study circle include the immediate family, their circles of friends and
neighbours, their workplace, their religious community and the school their children go
to. Analysing these interconnections would go beyond the scope of this study, which
focuses on the collaborative study circle as an activity system.

Why do they learn – what makes them make the effort? (Object)
The participants that are members of the Bahá’í community (apart from Anne) are
encouraged to participate in collaborative study circles. It is useful to them, as they each

have children that need to be educated. They are ‘confronted’ with this new situation that
is not going away and it is this change in their environment that is a part in the motivation
for taking part in the study circle. The fact that this activity is taking place in almost every
part of the globe is a motivation factor for Romain.
Excerpt 2 : WQ01 : C5
Rôle de quelqu’un de responsable et de soucieux du sort de l’humanité.
Important de participer à une étude (Ruhi 3) si largement répandue sur
toute la planète.
Each participant brings in historicity and multivoicedness.

What are they learning, what are the contents and outcomes of learning?

Participants learn principles and concepts, skills, techniques and abilities, they learn to
manage situations and they learn to create environments. They familiarize themselves
with a number of concepts of Bahá’í education, and acquire skills in order to hold
children’s classes. Document 19 provides a more detailed description of the content and
expected outcome of learning.
An aspect of learning that is not directly addressed in the curriculum is how to invite their
neighbours and friends to participate in a learning activity that demands a number of
skills, and needs to be systematic. It is a tool and part of a norm in the activity system.

How do they learn – what are the key actions?

I have observed over the five sessions that the five participants do a number of actions
together. They study and go over the course material of the Ruhi book 3: teaching
children’s classes. They read the material, discuss the various concepts presented to them
and consult about the exercises. They are confronted with classroom situations and the
course book gives them a number of alternatives to choose from or come up with another
solution to the situation. Participants share their teaching experiences and mostly the tutor
does this, as she has had a lot of experience in child education and as she is a trained
educator. The participants negotiate the course content as they accept the suggestions in
full or partly, or choose other resources that seem more suitable to achieve their object:
teaching their children and in the process also teaching children’s classes. They do not
follow all the rules given to them by the tutor or the curriculum. They do not fill in the
missing texts, they do not explain games to the other participants, they do not find all the
stories suitable for the children, they use other ways then colouring in order to understand

and memorize a quotation, and they do not memorize the passages suggested in the
curriculum. Participants carry out some of the actions suggested and they bring into the
group their talents, abilities and skills. Some of them play the guitar, some play the piano,
some sing, and some play songs; thereby preparing to sing songs with their children and
other children.
As they study, act and reflect on their actions and the experiences, they get to know each
other as a group with a shared object, they feel more comfortable with each other, and the
atmosphere is one where laughter is frequent.
5\.4.5 Possibilities for expansive learning
Conflictual questioning of existing standard practice is crucial triggering action in the
expansive learning process (Engeström, 1987).While there is certainly room for
expansive learning, I cannot confirm that expansive learning is happening in this study
circle. I have observed participants challenging existing practices of standard practice.
They clearly begin to question and deviate from established norms. This may turn into
collaborative envisioning and a deliberate collective change effort. These practices relate
to the tools used in order to achieve an object. Participants, as mentioned above, have
used additional and alternative tools, in order to carry out the desired action, or not carry
it out. The example below is a passage where participants discuss the exercise of filling
in missing text.
Instance 26: Excerpt 19 (INTS5E2)
01   Ann:    Maintenant que je feuille, quand même, il faut que je te

03   Ann:    Ah d’accord, mais dans le Ruhi 1 ça m’avait déjà BEAUCOUP

embêté ((giggles by Josefa))
04   Tut:      Donc c’est pas mieux dans le Ruhi 3 ?
05   Jos:      Peut-être il fallait changer un peu, dans la façon un peu

même phrase.
14   Ham:      C’était non stop, broken record (laughter, tutor) fast

15   Rom:      Le problème c’est que si maintenant on demande à qui que ce

> soit de citer la moindre phrase qu’on a réécrite, qu’on a

16   Tut:      Ça va être difficile, hm
17   Tut:      Si c’est pas trop long, ca va
18   Tut:      Ça reste pas
19   Rom:      Ça reste pas
20   Ham:      Ça devient un automatisme
21   Tut:      C’est comme Anne l’a dit, quand c’est trop, on voulait juste

encore finir, hm ?
22   Ham:      E pour les passages qui sont plus brefs, on est stimulé, on

voulait
23   ?         Oui, oui,
24   Rom:      Et au début, on se connaissait encore moins, o la la, il faut

bien répondre, et puis faire ces exercices

Analysis 26: Possibilities for expansive learning
Anne (L1) voices her unease with the exercise of filling in missing text. Josefa (L2)
confirms this by bringing in the voices of several of her friends, who told the same
“story”. Anne (L3) remembers how already during the Ruhi book 1 it had bothered her a
lot. The tutor (L4) acknowledges what Anne is saying, and Josefa (L5) envisions a change
that would be more “adult”. Romain, in line 10 confirms, like Anne, that 10 years ago,
this had bothered him so much, that he had stopped doing the study circles, and that it
took him 10 years to “come back”. More voices are added to the topic and Hamed (L14)
brings in a bit of humour by saying that at some stage, it was “non stop, broken record”.
Romain (L15), while agreeing with the group about deviating from the established norm
of memorising texts and filling in the gap in texts, highlighted the fact, that none of the
participants would remember much from the texts studied. This is confirmed by the tutor
(L16, 18).
Josefa suggested a change in practice without suggesting how it could be done practically
and Romain expressed his concern that the object of the exercise had simply not been
achieved.
This event provides the tutor with an opportunity to encourage among the participants a
discussion on finding other, more creative ways of achieving the object of the exercise,
simply by returning to what Josefa and Romain had said in lines 5 and 15.

5\.5 Outlook
5\.5.1 Matrix for possible expansive learning
An expansive transformation is accomplished when the object and motive of the activity
are reconceptualised to embrace a radically wider horizon of possibilities than in the
previous mode of the activity. The activity system analysed here does not show that the
object and motive have changed. Participants have decided not to use certain tools to
accomplish a task, to achieve the object. A contradiction between the rules and the object
exists. They have not embraced a wider horizon of possibilities, such as coming up with
different tools, in order to achieve their object. At this point, the question remains
whether the tutor, other participants in this activity or other activity systems that they are
surrounded in, will provide stimulation that will contribute to achieve their object.
When the five principles of CHAT, described earlier, are cross-tabulated with the four
central questions of any theory of learning, the matrix below helps visualising
possibilities for expansive learning.

5\.5.2 Questioning existing standard practice in a wider context
In a much larger context however, it is noteworthy that at the heart of the Bahá’í Faith, as
Bahá'u'lláh, its founder stated: “the object of every Revelation” is to “effect a
transformation in the whole character of mankind, a transformation that shall affect both
its inner life and external conditions” (see document 4). This quest for transformation has
found expression in the curriculum of Ruhi book 3. Existing standard practice is
portrayed in the introduction: “Bahá’í children’s classes are not like the classes of
indoctrination which are common in many other religions. [...] the emphasis is on
learning to think, reflect and to apply spiritual laws to the life of the individual and
society. [...] The desire to avoid indoctrination or catechism should not, however, lead to
laxity in religious instruction” (Ruhi Institute, 2007, p. 1). This is further explained with
the conclusion that “humanity, left to its own devices without divine guidance, has
produced nothing more than chaos, injustice and suffering” (Ruhi Institute, 2007, p. 1).
The curriculum is currently being used worldwide in over 184 national communities and
it is clarified that “the dynamics of educating children vary greatly from community to
community in the Bahá’í world” (Ruhi Institute, 2007, p. 1). Further research should
focus on the variations in the dynamics of educating children in different cultural and
historical settings.
5\.6 Summary of Findings related to the research questions
5\.6.1 Research question 1
How does learning take place in the study circle?
I have used in this study the cultural-historical activity theory perspective and the
discourse analysis approach in order to provide elements that show how learning takes
place in this collaborative study circle. The different elements that describe this study
circle as an activity system (chapter 5.1.2) offer a first insight into the complexity of what
happens, when five participants engage in a collaborative learning activity. In chapter
5\.4.4, I describe the four central questions on learning, including how people have
learned, and what their key actions were.
Several instances from the selected excerpts below offer insights that this particular type
of collaborative activity encourages and promotes the exchange of questions, ideas,
experiences, thoughts and knowledge among participants.

When an idea bounces – how one comment resonates with other participants
During an interview after session five, Anne raised her unease that the curriculum
suggested to fill in missing text, in order to help memorizing certain passages. Josefa
picked up on this point, remembering how several of her friends told her about the same
unease when doing the curriculum with her. Romain shared his unease and the fact that it
took him 10 years before restarting this curriculum. Then the tutor picks up by stating
that at some stage the repetition of the same sentence was really too much. Hamed
continues by bringing in some humour to this discussion, and comparing this repetition to
a “broken record” (Chapter 5.3.4).
During this instance and throughout the recordings observed during five sessions, the
general atmosphere was calm and serene. Over time, the group came closer to each other,
as laughter became more frequent, humour was present, and participants mentioned
during interviews that they got to know each other better. Such conditions promote
learning opportunities.
When cultural differences meet in a collaborative activity through value negotiation
During session one (Instance 17) Josefa relates her values to a community she knows
well, and respects for the values they seem to show without any formal education, and her
unease with the world she is experiencing currently, a world that is moving too fast for
her and with not enough values. Romain brings to the discussion his view of the world,
one that is becoming more interconnected through communication technology, a world
that is developing knowledge, requiring a minimum of common values, so that a
minimum of social cohesion can be possible.
This instance shows that the negotiation of cultural differences in a collaborative activity
offers different perspectives on values and thus provides learning opportunities.
Participants need to question their assumptions, gain from the sharing of ideas by others
and are able to rethink their position. As participants look back on their development and
share their thoughts in the group, new insights can be gained (Chapter 5.4.2).
When a known concept connects to a new context of having to raise children
Hamed had heard over a thousand times the concept that man should be regarded as a
mine rich in gems, but that this were but words. By visualising his own child in this
context, he became aware, it gave him joy, the words became beautiful and his heart was

beating a bit faster (L11). Thus, the concept, together with the context gave meaning to
the words and provided a learning experience.
Anne states that through the study circle, she came to know the participants, and as a
young parent, was able to share different ideas about education, and that it takes time to
integrate these ideas. She says that her development is developing, and as a parent, she
takes inspiration from good methods, and that it is always beneficial to learn (L12). This
instance offers another indication that the collaborative activity promotes learning under
certain conditions: being able to share ideas; the confidence that learning is beneficial.
When the object of learning is seen as a positive source, spread out worldwide for the first time,
in a joyous attitude
In this instance, Romain is very happy to be able to participate in the study circle, and
also as his son attends a children’s class, with a teacher that has completed the same
curriculum. Romain is aware of this unique historical phenomenon, and this has given
him added motivation and direction. His identity is strengthened, knowing that he
collaborates in a global learning process. Thus, his personal development is linked to
individual and social transformation (L14).
When learning develops through comparison and identity development
This instance shows the tutor, who compares her role as a tutor with other tutors where
she participates and completes further courses that lead towards tutor training. She also
compares herself to other participants, who have been Bahá’ís much longer and who may
know more about some aspects of the Faith. A part of her identity is that of a learner.
When an interest is shown in what participants do and how they do it
As I informed the study circle of my intention to carry out my research on the exploration
of learning processes, three participants showed their interest (Chapter 5.4.3).
Subsequently, through meeting the group, each participant seemed happy and encouraged
about my interest in their activity. I never got the impression, that my interest and my
questions were not welcome.
Value-oriented activity
In this instance, participants attend the study circle motivated by a genuine interest (use
value-oriented), and not for the sake of getting a grade (exchange value-oriented). As

seen in chapter 5.2.5, some participants may want to show obedience towards Bahá’í
institutions, in which they trust, and these institutions form an integral part of the Bahá’í
Faith. This last analysis stems from my observations as a member of the Bahá’í
community.
Mediation: When participants are confronted with learning tools
People interpose purposefully tools between them and their environment, in order to
modify it and obtain certain benefits. In the process of using and applying the tools within
socially organized activities such as this collaborative study circle, opportunities for
learning are created. The use of language is a cultural form of mediation. In the following
instance, an opportunity to learn through action has been missed. In chapter 5.3.1, the
curriculum suggested that participants explain a game to the group, so that they could
practice in order to be able to explain games to children.
When the tutor shares their experiences and skills
In chapter 5.3.2, the tutor finds that not all stories meant for children, that are included in
the curriculum are suitable for the very young. She relates this from experience, and
reassures the participants that many suitable stories are now readily available online.
In chapter 5.3.5 the tutor brings into the group the meaning of the German translation for
the word “fear”, thereby expanding the meaning of this concept for other participants,
which was acknowledged by Romain and Pia. Code-switching is seen here as a tool,
allowing for comparison, and further understanding the concept of the fear of God. The
tutor is familiar with the German vocabulary, due to her practice and work with children.
5\.6.2 Research question 2
What tools are used by the participants and how do they shape their learning?
From the sociocultural perspective, learning is seen as a process of appropriating tools for
thinking (Rogoff, 1990). These tools and instruments are one element in the cultural
historical activity system. They constitute the means that are used in performing the
activity. Figure 3 shows the study circle as an activity system and provides the first
answers as to what tools are used by the participants.
Participants used mainly French during the sessions, as well as the French curriculum.
Luxembourgish was used in discussions when the participants present shared this

language. German was used at least on one occasion in order to clarify understanding of
a French concept in the curriculum.
The curriculum was in the form of a published book of a 128 pages, consisting of an
introduction, addressed to the collaborators, as well as three distinct units. Each unit
provided the participants with additional tools that would guide their learning. They
include:
   passages from the Bahá’í Writings (authoritative texts) to be memorized;
   passages with questions where the answers could be found in the passages to be

memorized;
   open-ended questions that would encourage reflection and discussions among

participants;
   statements made that are either true or false;
   passages with missing text to be filled in;
   suggested stories to be told to children; colouring material and games to be explained

to children;
These activities were carried out in the group, composed of five participants, and each
one was encouraged by the tutor to collaborate. My analysis has shown how these tools,
suggested by the curriculum, were negotiated at times, and used less then suggested in
the curriculum.
The tutor encouraged each participant to complete the necessary exercises in the course
book, by writing and filling in the required exercises. Each participant had a copy. The
couple, Anne and Romain, shared one book. As a result, they were not able to carry out
individually the task of answering questions in the book, and other writing exercises.
They shared a tool.
Participants asked the tutor questions regarding the education of children and the tutor is
considered a mediating agent, someone that has already studied the curriculum, someone
with some experience with giving children’s classes and someone that has completed a
tutor-training course. In this instance, the tutor had not yet completed this course. She
mentioned this in a written questionnaire, stating that it was an element that she felt she
needed to complete now.
The participants’ cultural-historical background gives them tools which they bring into
the activity. They include:

   knowledge of a prominent pedagogue in the Bahá’í Faith (Mr Furutan);
   musical skills that include singing, playing the guitar and the piano;
   awareness of online resources that help carrying out children’s classes;
   professional experience in teaching children;
   additional languages that give a different perspective to a number of concepts;
   the use of humour during the sessions;
I assume that these instruments, tools and mediating agents have guided and influenced
significantly the learning process. My analysis shows that participants were motivated to
learn more about child education, and all are young parents. All have a common task in
providing guidance and education to their children. All share a common vision, and by
being constantly guided by this vision, this objective of teaching their children, the
collaborators made use of the tools at their disposal, in a way that would bring them
closer to their objective: knowing more about child education. My analysis shows that the
participants struggled at times with the tools offered in the curriculum. They did not
however turn to new tools that would guide and favour their learning.
5\.6.3 Research question 3
How does the participants’ multivoicedness influence the learning process?
The five collaborators engage in an activity system that is called a study circle, have
multiple points of view, traditions and interests. This multivoicedness has a direct effect
on the learning process as it creates different positions for the participants in the activity
of developing skills that allow them to teach children’s classes.
Looking through the 21 selected excerpts that include interviews (5), written
questionnaires (3), group sessions (10) and notes (3), I identified and analysed the
different voices that the participants brought into the activity. I assume that they represent
a fraction of the multivoicedness inherent in the voicing of thoughts and ideas, namely
those that were written or pronounced during the activity.
I identified the voices, brought together in table 6: Summary of voices used by
participants, indicating how many participants ‘used’ a specific voice. In the light of my
knowledge and understanding about this particular group, I suggest the following
interpretation, in an attempt to regroup the different voices, brought together in the table
below. On the left side are the voices observed in the 21 excerpts, and on the right side
my interpretation and summary of seven types of voices.

I assume that the activity that the participants were engaged in, triggered a number of
voices to become manifest, and to become active. The participation in this specific
learning activity gave rise to voices to be heard. At the same time, the multivoicedness of
the participants and their interaction in the activity shaped and influenced the learning
process.
The following incident shows how multivoicedness affects the learning process. Several
excerpts show how Hamed is referring to a well-known Bahá’í pedagogue and scholar
who used to say that “repetition is the mother of knowledge”. The tutor repeats this as the

participants negotiate a number of instances in the curriculum when they are confronted
with memorizing a passage from the Bahá’í Writings or fill in missing text, so as to
remember better certain passages. The analyses show how most participants struggle with
the tools given in order to memorize the suggested passages. On one occasion, Romain
voices his unhappiness with having to fill in missing text, and shares with the group that
due to these kinds of exercises, it took him 10 years to come back, because he didn’t like
it at all. Hamed jokes about it and Romain shows clearly that he has not been able to
come up with an alternative tool to help the group memorize important passages. He says
that the problem is that if someone was to ask the group about even one sentence that they
wrote down, (he doesn’t finish the sentence), this would be difficult (the tutor completed
the sentence) (chapter 5.3.4, instance 12, L10, 15, 16). I have not observed the tutor
intervening and trying to encourage the group to find other ways to memorize pertinent
passages.
In the written questionnaire after session six, the tutor describes the importance of
repetition in order to acquire certain habits and qualities. She brings in a number of voices
in order to further make the point that repetition is important.
The tutor brings in the voice of Hamed, a participant, and Mr Furutan, the person that
Hamed quoted. This adds weight to what Hamed said as it comes from a respected and
well-known Bahá’í scholar. This is repeated in the last questionnaire. As the tutor reflects
on what she as a tutor has learned, she focuses on the concept of memorization, and how
repetition is the mother of knowledge, she combines a number of voices: the voice of
Hamed, who quoted this short passage on repetition from Mr Furutan; the voice of her
son who talked about the importance of repetition in the context of mastering Judo, and
how while he was in Japan for three weeks, the Japanese Judo master spent three hours
practicing one movement, and the voice of Ken Robinson, a writer who talks about how
10\.000 hours of training can bring pure joy and happiness, when one has found ‘one’s
element’. By combining the elements of repetition, knowledge and happiness, the tutor
voiced in a few sentences her own voice (1), and the voices of Hamed (2), Mr Furutan
(3), her son (4), the Japanese Judo master (5) and Ken Robinson (6). This description
serves as an example of the depth and richness that historicity and multivoicedness is able
to offer when analysing learning processes. It allows visualising and connecting the
different voices used by the participants (chapter 5.2.1.).

This instance shows how multivoicedness guided the tutor’s learning process, as it
reinforced the concept that memorization is a valuable tool. Multivoicedness is linked to
historicity, as this instance shows poignantly.

6 CHAPTER SIX: DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
6\.1 Limitations
If I had to do the study again, I would do a number of things differently. A major
challenge has been the selection of data out of over 10 hours of video-recording, and this
is due to the difficulty in determining appropriate research questions. The experience
gained at this stage has helped me to further understand the concepts of observation,
analysis, interpretation, and assumption. I was able to do this through my actions;
carrying out the above tasks, and being able to study, act, and reflect upon learning
processes in the safe environment of the university, with ample opportunities to exchange
ideas with fellow students and professors.
In an effort to develop further this research in regards to discourse analysis, I would apply
systematically a number of tools of inquiry such as those used by Gee (2005, p. 20), so as
to gain more research depth.
For further development of this research as far as the use of cultural-historical activity
theory is concerned, I would complete the study by taking a more distant stance towards
the processes in the study circle and overview the analysis on a meta-level.
In an effort to further develop this study, I would analyse the video-recorded sessions and
take a critical approach, stating that multicultural and multilingual contexts offer
challenges, and may initially slow down expected learning outcome; participants struggle
to get across intended meaning; participants are unfamiliar with the use of French;
participants may be ignorant about the importance of knowing the historicity and
multivoicedness of others.
This study explored learning processes within a study group. I would briefly describe
methods from other disciplines, such as developmental and cognitive psychology, and
neurobiological processes, and how they shed light on the unit of analysis: participants
that learn in a collaborative study.
As an insider, a member of the Bahá’í community, I do research within a group of people,
and four out of five are members of the Bahá’í community. Throughout the study, I need
to be attentive that my beliefs and convictions do not veil existing learning issues within

the group. Appropriate methods are called for in order to prevent this possibility;
safeguards are required.
6\.2 Discussion on analysis and insights
At this stage of this research, I suggest an interpretation of the insights gained; describe
what they mean and how they contribute to the research problem: increasing
understanding around learning processes and how learning takes place in the case of a
particular collaborative study circle.
This study circle allowed the collaborators to come together in a peaceful environment,
full of happiness and careful consideration towards others. The discussions were carried
out in a caring, dignified, respectful, and non-judgmental manner, allowing participants to
freely express themselves. My observations and experience as a member of the Bahá’í
community show that in Luxembourg and France, the term ‘participant’ is preferred to the
term ‘collaborator’. On one occasion, someone remarked that the term ‘collaborator’ was
associated with the French ‘collaborateur’ during the second world war. The equivalent
Luxembourgish term ‘Mataarbechter’ is appropriate. Code-switching improves in this
instance desired meaning.
Recommendations
The following suggestions serve all those involved in the implementation and
organisation of collaborative study circles. The tutor is a pivotal agent in this enterprise.
Considering the multicultural and multilingual context of many study circles,
organisers and tutors would do well to plan enough time to allow participants a full and
frank understanding of essential concepts around the issue of values. Tutors need to be
aware that the French curriculum translation needs a revision. In this way, precious time
can be given to allow for a deeper understanding of the essential concept of the nobility of
man.
The mediating tools offered in the curriculum did on occasions not suit the participants.
An initial discussion at the start of a study circle should emphasise that the common
vision takes priority over the choice of tools in order to reach the desired outcome. All are
responsible to gain adequate understanding of the basic concepts through creative means
at their disposal.

The elements of the activity system present a powerful visual indication and guide to a
process of learning that is complex and not easy to grasp. By providing participants with
relationships between elements, awareness is raised.
This study has shown that a collaborative learning activity is rich in instances of
multivoicedness. Participants have shared awareness about the historicity of study
circles. They take part in a global learning process that helps to strengthen identity and
purpose. Study circles are evolving and growing. As experiences from study circles
taking place in different cultures, are collected and analysed, new insights are gained and
shared.
As collaborators complete the curriculum on teaching children’s classes, and as they are
encouraged to be responsible for their own learning, action-based tasks such as starting
children’s classes, will offer those involved valuable experiences. As they progress
through ongoing learning that includes study, action, reflection on action, and
consultation, they become social actors and improve and transform their neighbourhoods.
They will advance step by step in achieving their desired outcome, as stated in the title of
this study: individual and social transformation.
6\.3 Future research directions
I was privileged to carry out research in the way people learn, progress and develop in the
setting of a collaborative study circle. I was able to analyse the first five sessions and a
short written questionnaire after session six. In this regard, collaborators had completed
Unit 1 of the curriculum: Some Principles of Bahá’í Education.
As a further contribution to the research challenge: increasing understanding around
learning processes in the case of collaborative study circles, I suggest a research project
that would follow the participants through the entire learning process:
   Collaborators complete the three units in the curriculum: teaching children’s classes,

> which are: unit 1: some principles of Bahá’í Education; unit 2: 15 Lessons for
> Children, where each lesson includes a prayer to be memorized, a song around the
> theme of values, exercises that help to understand the prayer, a short quotation related
> to a quality, a story that relates to a certain value, a cooperative game, and a colouring
> activity; unit 3: Conducting Classes for Children. The purpose of this unit is to learn
> some methods and understand some basic ideas on how to conduct a Bahá’í class.

> Apart from the required knowledge and enthusiasm to guarantee good results, success
> depends on the way the class is managed and a relationship with children and their
> parents, based on unconditional love and deep respect.
   Collaborators start to assist teaching a children’s class with someone more

> experienced. Once, they feel confident and have sufficient experience and skills, they
> start their own class.

Ideally, the tutor accompanies the collaborators during this process. The duration of such
a project could take 6 to 18 months. A number of research questions are addressed. What
tools do collaborators use in order to complete the process outlined below? What are the
indicators that favour collaborative learning? How do collaborators experience this
process? How does this process contribute towards social transformation?
Another research approach would take the form of action research, or interventionist
research. Analysis 12: Comprehension: inappropriate learning task, offers an instance
where participants are uncomfortable with the proposed tool of filling in missing text, in
order to increase their understanding of a relevant passage. At this stage, the researcher
questions the participants as to what alternative tools they can come up with in order to
become more familiar with essential text passages. With the experience of this study, a
similar research project would include active intervention by the researcher throughout
the project that the participants would be engaged in, while completing the curriculum
and gaining experience in teaching children’s classes.
A second area of research worthy of investigation is the Bahá’í concept of consultation,
a distinctive method of non-adversarial decision-making, a procedure for building
consensus and investigating truth, and a vital instrument for social criticism. The Bahá’í
concept of learning includes four aspects that are interlinked: study, action, reflection on
action and consultation (Lample, 2009). While the concept of consultation is well
described in Bahá’í literature, I have not found research that shows how participants in a
collaborative environment apply consultation.
The following research questions will contribute to answering issues related to social
cohesion. How does the Bahá’í concept of consultation seeks to build consensus in a
manner that unites various constituencies, instead of dividing them? How do the
principles of consultation encourage diversity of opinion and acts to control the struggle
for power that is otherwise so common in traditional decision-making systems? How do

the principles of consultation contribute towards problem-solving? The four principles of
Bahá’í consultation are described in Appendix B: Consultation.
A third area of research relates to the worldwide spread of collaborative study circles and
their effectiveness. In chapter 5.5.2, existing standard practices are questioned in a global
context. The ‘raison d’être’ of the Bahá’í community is to bring about individual and
social transformation, and the collaborative study circles with their sequence of courses
are the vehicle, the tool for this transformation. Since the curriculum of the course:
teaching children’s classes, states that “the dynamics of educating children vary greatly
from community to community in the Bahá’í world” (Ruhi Institute, 2007, p. 1), further
research may focus on the variations in the dynamics of educating children in different
cultural and historical settings, and: How can an educational system such as the children’s
class curriculum be implemented and work effectively across various cultures? A
study could analyse and compare the learning activities of collaborative study circles in
different cultures. Education and Multilingualism, one of the five focus areas of the
University of Luxembourg, seeks answers to the research question: Can an education
system that works well in one culture be implemented in another?

6\.4 Conclusion
I wish to draw some conclusions based on the insights gained from the study, and discuss
their implications, so as to bridge the “research to practice” gap.
The first conclusion is that participants have been reluctant to use a number of tools given
in the curriculum; that participants have become aware that they have not achieved the
desired outcome, but that they have not searched for other tools that would help them
achieve their goal. Participants had read and discussed several key concepts on children’s
education, had not been satisfied with the tools suggested, in order to fully understand and
memorize the concepts, but had not suggested alternative tools.
When those engaged in a collaborative learning process focus on their objective and
outcome, the choice of appropriate tools can be negotiated by the group themselves, as
they take on responsibility for their own learning. Tools are means to achieve goals.
The second conclusion is that participants have brought into the activity multiple voices.
These voices are attached to the historicity of the participants, and indicate groups of
voices: voices, where we see ourselves collectively, voices of those we care for and love,
voices of those that are keen to learn and are curious, voices of those that want to
contribute and share their skills, voices of those with qualities and values, voices of those
that endure physical hardship, those that are close to nature, and finally the voices of
those that are not satisfied by certain learning tools. All of these voices relate to the object
and outcome of the activity undertaken. The interrelationship between the individual and
the group activity exists. I assume that the learning activity acts upon multivoicedness and
that participants bring into the activity their multivoicedness. We choose to bring out
certain voices and not to bring out others. I assume that certain voices further learning
processes more than others, when they echo with their objects of learning.
The third conclusion is that learning takes place through a complex interaction between
all of the elements uncovered through the cultural-historical activity system. The study
circle observed is at the beginning of its historicity; study circles are developing with their
own historicity in different contexts and cultures, and they influence the learning activity.
As participants bring in their own historicity and multivoicedness, they influence the
learning activity, and in this way, there is interconnectedness and a reciprocal influence
between participants and the study circle. The study has shown that a number of actions

and conditions favour learning processes. In the study circle, and among participants, the
existence and deliberate creation of certain conditions, such as mutual trust, a welcoming
and encouraging attitude, a respect for the opinion of others, adopting a humble learning
attitude, and taking ownership for one’s learning, contribute towards a richer and
meaningful learning activity.
I assume that these elements constitute the foundation that allow for a rich individual and
social transformation; something I consider to be a burning issue today.

8 APPENDIXES
8\.1 Appendix: Definitions
I will define here a number of concepts and terms requiring a more detailed explanation
for the reader that is not familiar with some terms related to the Bahá’í Faith. Other terms
that are widely used needed to be defined in the context of this study in an attempt to
reduce ambiguity as to their meaning.
Bahá’í: A person becomes a Bahá’í by recognizing Bahá’u’lláh as the Messenger of God
for this age and accepting to follow His laws and teachings and the administrative
institutions He established for the unification of humankind. People enrol in a Bahá’í
community by signifying such belief and commitment, orally or in writing, to the
responsible Bahá'í institution.
Bahá’í Faith/Religion: Founded a century and a half ago, the Bahá’í Faith is today
among the fastest-growing of the world’s religions. With more than five million
followers, who reside in virtually every nation on earth, it is the second-most widespread
faith, surpassing every religion but Christianity in its geographic reach. Bahá’ís reside in
more than 100,000 localities around the world, an expansion that reflects their dedication
to the ideal of world citizenship (Bahá’í International Community, 2011c).
Culture: Man’s general control, refinement, and improvement of himself. Culture, seen
as a vast panoply of ideas, facts, relics, secrets, techniques, applications, formulas, and
documents; the sum of our ways of doing things, and the sum of “knowledge” as we
know it. Culture arises from the dialectic between the individual and the social world
(Wagner, 1981).
Collaborative Study for Individual and Social Transformation: At the heart of the
Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the force of transformation, both of the individual and of
society. The transformation of the individual is not an isolated process, not ascetic nor
centered wholly on one’s self-fulfilment. In Bahá'í terms, the process of one’s individual
development and fulfilment is tied to the centering of one’s energies on the betterment of
humankind and serving the needs of the community and the larger society.
Prayer and meditation, fighting one’s spiritual battles, living according to spiritual laws
and teachings—all are essential elements in fulfilling life’s purpose, but such efforts
reach their fullest transformative effect when they are dedicated to service.
Thus, Bahá'ís are actively engaged in developing knowledge, skills, and spiritual insights
that enable them to act as effective human resources and which are vital to the integrated
process of personal and social transformation. Presently, such collective learning takes
the form of study circles—a local, collaborative, self-directed learning process being
undertaken by Bahá’í communities around the world. All are welcome in the classes,
regardless of their ideas or beliefs.

By learning about our spiritual reality and our individual role in the progress of society,
we can better understand our purpose in life and the way to improve our own lives and
the lives of those around us.
Participants in the courses learn, for example, to teach values to children, to engage in
community service activities, to assist and empower others to independently investigate
spiritual truths, to learn how to competently express one’s views, and to engage oneself in
serving the broader needs of society for unity, justice, and equity.
Participants in study circles often experience a new sense of direction in life, better
relationships with family and friends, and a fruitful re-evaluation of the contribution one
can make to the wider community.
Education: Bahá’ís emphasize the importance of education in both its religious and
‘secular’ aspects, seeing it as a major element in the spiritual and material development of
the individual and society as a whole (Smith, 2002, p. 130).
International Teaching Centre: Established in Haifa by the Universal House of Justice
in June 1973. Duties include: to be fully informed of the situation of the Faith in all parts
of the world, and on the basis of that knowledge make recommendations to the House of
Justice and advice the Continental Counsellors; to be alert to the possibilities for the
extension of Bahá’í teaching activity; to work out regional and global teaching plans for
approval by the House of Justice.
Rationality: Bernstein calls for an alternative approach to human rationality that seeks a
way beyond objectivism and relativism. Drawing upon the work of a number of
individuals, he proposes an approach whose features include the importance of dialogue
among a community of inquirers, practical reasoning born of experience, and an ability to
refine human understanding through action over time (Lample, 2009, p. 172).
Reality: As David Bohm, the well-known physicist and philosopher, has pointed out, the
way most intellectual disciplines treat theory today is intimately connected with the
fragmentation of thought that is prevalent in society. At the most fundamental level, this
fragmentation arises, he argues, from our insistence that our theories correspond to
“reality as it is” rather than being manageable models of limited sets of phenomena
occurring within an objective reality that is infinitely complex. Since our theories are
necessarily fragmented, by considering them replicas of “reality as it is,” we end up
assuming that reality itself is fragmented. And so we miss the interconnectedness of all
things. . . . (Lample, 2009, p. 137).
Relativism: The view that any claim to truth, knowledge or morality are not absolute but
exist only in relation to a particular culture, society, or historical context (Lample, 2009,
p. 170).
Religion: Religion here is not viewed as a conglomeration of conflicting sects, but as a
body of spiritual teachings revealed progressively throughout the various stages of the
evolution of the human race (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 134).

Religion and Science: The antagonism towards science held by some religious people is
to be condemned. Knowledge is the gift of God to humanity, and divine religion promotes
truth. How then can religion oppose science? To do so is ignorance and a denial of human
intelligence. It is ignorance, not science, which threatens the foundations of religion:
dogmatism and irrationality are the cause of irreligion and the growth of secularism.
Religion should be in conformity with science and reason. Thus its foundation will be
solid, and it will be able to influence the human heart. It needs to be based on
investigation and not mere imitation. Religion that is not in accordance with science is
superstition and a human invention. It should be discarded. The maintenance of irrational
beliefs engenders vacillation and is ultimately untenable. Both science and true religion
are based on reason and should ‘bear its test’. Together they fortify each other: science
protects religion from becoming superstition; religion protects science from becoming a
barren materialism (Smith, 2002, p. 290–291).
Social reality: Social reality is ontologically subjective and epistemologically objective
(Searle, 1997, p. 12–13) Ontology has to do with the nature of being, epistemology with
what we know. Subjectivity pertains to what is personal, and objectivity to what is
independent of personal opinion. Thus, to say that social reality is ontologically
subjective means that the features of social reality do not have an existence outside of the
consensus of the human beings that create it. For example, a certain piece of paper is
money because of the intent of the social agents that created it, not because of its inherent
physical qualities. To say that social reality is epistemologically objective means that
what we know about social reality isn’t just a matter of the opinion of one individual, but
consists of objectively ascertainable facts. Thus, determining whether a particular piece of
paper is money is not a matter of the personal opinion of a single individual (Lample,
2009, p. 236).
Society: is the outcome of the consciously applied skills of human agents (Giddens, 1993,
p. 20).
Spiritual qualities: The Bahá’í writings abound with references to various spiritual and
moral qualities which the individual should seek to acquire. The attributes of good
character include the fear of God; reverence; piety; obedience to religious law; love for
God expressed in love for humanity; prayerfulness; compassion; consideration for others;
courtesy; philanthropy; service to others; industriousness; selflessness; forbearance and
calm; meekness; amiability; a lack of malice; loyalty; courage; magnanimity; generosity;
energy and zeal; a sense of honour and regard for the rights of others; high-mindedness;
detachment from material things; submissiveness to the will of God; humility; control of
the passions; temperance; purity; chastity; justice (including equity and fair-mindedness);
honesty (including truthfulness, candour and financial probity); trustworthiness (including
reliability); faithfulness; integrity; sincerity; wisdom; and moderation. Purity of
motivation is crucial. Such virtues are conducive to human dignity and honour, and the
attainment of ‘man’s true station’. Each individual should ‘strive diligently’ to acquire
them. Moral and religious qualities are also to be balanced by reason and knowledge.
Bahá’ís should be distinguished by their moral qualities. They should promote freedom.

The ‘sword’ of upright conduct is ‘sharper than blades of steel’. If the Bahá’ís succeed in
exemplifying divine virtues then they will become both completely united among
themselves and a magnet for others, who will want to discover the source of their
radiance and joy. Each individual is responsible for their own life, and should seek to
perfect their own character (and avoid backbiting about others) (Smith, 2002, p. 327).
The Universal House of Justice: Ordained by Bahá'u'lláh as the legislative authority in
the Bahá'í Faith came into existence in 1963. It is a nine-member body elected at five-
year intervals by the entire membership of the national governing institutions of the
Bahá'í world. The House of Justice directs the spiritual and administrative affairs of the
Bahá'í International Community. It serves, as well, as custodian and trustee of the Bahá'í
Holy Places and other properties in the Holy Land. Endowed by Bahá'u'lláh with the
authority to legislate on all matters not specifically laid down in the Bahá'í scriptures, the
House of Justice is the institution that keeps the Bahá'í community abreast of an ever-
changing world.
Training Institute : L’institut Pierre Becker est un institut de formation initié par la
Communauté bahá’íe du Luxembourg. Son programme s'adresse à tous ceux qui
s'intéressent à une gestion globale des défis individuels et sociaux de l'âge de maturité de
la race humaine. Il repose sur les enseignements profonds du fondateur de la Foi bahá’íe,
Bahá'u'lláh, qui unissent spiritualité et logique. L'Institut s'efforce de développer les
caractéristiques suivantes: développer conjointement les connaissances, le discernement
spirituel et les compétences de ses participants; offrir une méthodologie variée basée sur
l'étude, la consultation, l'art et la méditation ; veiller à la participation active et
l'enrichissement mutuel de tous ses étudiants; encourager tous ses étudiants à soutenir
l'évolution de la société par leur potentiel individuel unique; s'adapter continuellement et
évoluer de manière organique à l'aide du feedback de ses étudiants. Pierre Becker était un
instituteur dévoué à Kayl et un membre estimé, créatif et de longue date du Comité baha'i
pour l'éducation des enfants. Avec sa femme Christiane il a contribué de façon
significative au développement et à l'enrichissement des classes et des fêtes d'enfants.
Pierre Becker est décédé au printemps 1994 aux suites d'une tumeur cérébrale. Cet
Institut est dédié à sa personne et à son engagement infatigable pour l'éducation et
l'encouragement des enfants et des jeunes du Grand Duché (Communauté bahá’íe du
Luxembourg, 2011).
Understanding: there are two mental tools, both extremely powerful in the process of
investigation reality. One is analysis, that is, breaking things into smaller parts and then
examining the relations and interactions of these parts. The other consists of placing
things in larger contexts in order to gain insights into causes and reasons for their
existence and behavior (FUNDAEC, 2003, p. 26).

19           (3.0)
20    Rom:   Donc, enseigner à quelqu’un, ˂inaudible.1˃ (on ne peut pas dire)

enseigner quelqu’un, c’est Ç A que tu dis ?

21    Ann:   Oui, on enseigne quelque chose en fait
22    Tut:   Hm ok
23    Rom:   Ok

24   Tut:   Et c’est pour ça que ça gène un peu
25   Ann:   Oui
26   Jos:   C’est BON, oui
27   Rom:   C’est bon mais c’est bizarre
28          ((Romain looks at Anne, both giggling, Josefa is leaning her head

to look closer in the book at the text))
29   Ham:   ˂inaudible.1˃
30   Ann:   Oui c’est, bon c’est, je trouve que, c’est hm, c’est écrit en

31   Tut:   Non, mais, je pense pas qu’on veut les enfants comme des objets,

ça je suis sûr, mais je comprends que ça peut gêner (2.0)
32   Rom:   En fait c’est hm, enseignons est un peu confondu avec éduquer, car

> on éduque quelqu’un, mais on enseigne à quelqu’un ((looking at
> Anne) (.)
33   Ann:   Oui
34   Jos:   (Bien) qu’il connaisse bien la langue (1) et puis qui a rédigé le

livre ((taps with one hand on the book))
35          ˂inaudible.1˃ ((comments mixed with giggles)
36   Tut:   C’est possible, hm
37   Ham:   L’enseignement c’est dans le sens d’éduquer ici, non ((taps on the

38   Rom:   Oui
39   Ham:   =education
40   Rom:   C’est tout à fait le même sens, mais, hm, c’est pas utilisé
41   Ham:   Ah, d’accord
42   Rom:   Car comme disait Anne, on enseigne quelque chose à quelqu’un. Mais

je pense c’est tout simplement ˂inaudible.1˃
43   Tut:   Sûrement
44   Ham:   Le language
45          Hm hm ((not sure by whom this comment was made))

4. S1E2: 25.01.

001    Tut:    Qu’est-ce-que c’est les pierres précieuses?
002    Jos:    C’est les valeurs, toujours, (3.0) c’est de mettre en pratique

> chaque jour, (5.0) je crois par exemple, nous sommes entrain de
> faire <inaudible.1> l’éducation, ça c’est une valeur qu’on met en
> priorité (3.0) ((participants look in their books))
003    Rom:    Aussi, tous les exemples qu’ils donnent ici, hm, justice, vérité,

> loyauté, fidélité, hm, il est évident que aucune soit citée
> pourrait exister sans un minimum de ses valeurs là, c’est tout à

> cette complexité s’accroit, (devient) plus grande, plus je pense
> il est important justement de développer les connaissances de

> enfants (3.0).

004    Jos:    Tu veux dire, plus qu’on est évolué, plus (.) on trouve ça?
005    Tut:    Plus c’est important
006    Rom:    Oui, plus, je ne sais pas, par exemple le téléphone portable

> ((points to the telephone on the coffee table)), à quel point,
> l’utilité, c’est, est maintenant connecté d’une manière
> différente, disant que par exemple il y a 50 ans, et plus qu’il y

> connexions qui se font amicales, ou clubs, professions, à tous
> les niveaux, plus il y a de nouvelles connections
007    Ham:    interactions
008    Rom:    Interactions, plus il est important d’avoir des valeurs pour tous

> le monde, et le plus de valeurs possibles, sinon on va droit dans
> le mûr
009    Jos:    parce que si je donne juste un exemple, parfois quand je veux

> vivre vraiment cette situation de valeurs vraies, moi je retourne
> un peu dans ma famille, qui est au Brésil, qui vit vraiment dans
> les champs. Je demande aux gens chaque fois que je vais chez la
> voisine, quand j’allais visiter cette gens, ils sont pas
> instruits de l’école, rien du tout, il y a des gens qui vivent de
> façon vraiment indigènes, mais qu’il y TANT de valeurs, que c’est
> TELLEMENT beau, qu’il y a un différent façon de passer cette

> message (.) parfois je retourne en arrière pour avoir un peu de
> la force pour le monde qui peut rester tellement vide (.) vous
> comprenez ce que je veux dire ?

010   Rom:    Oue oue
011   Jos:    C’est   comme si avant nous avons             ça vraiment, hm, PLUS, et vous

> allez   sentir ça si un jour vous             allez dans un endroit comme ça,
> c’est   beaucoup plus FORT, quand             même. Je trouve que le monde là,
> il va   trop vite, et nous vivons             très peu tous ces valeurs (2.0)
012   Tut:    Je suis pas toujours
013   Jos:                               [non ?
014   Tut:    Oui, et non, parce que je pense aussi dans le passé il y a des

histoires, au moyen âge et même encore dans des guerres,
015   Jos:                                                    [oui ?
016   Tut:    Horribles, donc on peut pas dire que il y a 50 ans,
017   Jos:    oui dans certains cas
018   Tut:    Dans certains donc je pense pas qu’il y a 50 ans ou 100 ans les

gens avaient plus de valeurs, hmm
019   Jos:    Pas qu’il y avait plus de valeurs, mais ils mettaient plus en

> pratique ces valeurs, je pense, peut-être qu’ils avaient plus de
> possibilités à donner cette innocence, (à passer) cette innocence
> parce que c’est une façon d’innocence aussi (.5) je ne sais pas,
> mais quand même on a eu déjà ça, c’est bien (qu’on ramène) parce
> que autrement si nous avons pas ça en arrière, je ne pense pas
> que nous avons la capacité d’être ici aujourd’hui entrain de

020   Tut:    Hmm ((wondering))
021   Jos:    Vous savez (.) mais c’est bien (.) il faut vraiment avoir la

force hm ?
022   Ham:    Mais je crois le (problème) est relatif, il y a 50 ans, on ne

> connaissait pas le futur, on aurait le même argument en disait
> oui il y a 50 ans les gens, seraient (in touch with) c’est
> toujours relatif au point.

023   Jos:    Hmm ((agreeing))
024   Ham:    Dans 50 ans on va dire, oui, il y a 50 ans on était beaucoup plus

dans les valeurs, car c’est toujours relatif
025   Tut:    Il y a Socrates, c’est vraiment en vieux grec, 2000 ans, euh, je

> ne sais pas, et il y a une citation de lui quand il dit oui mais
> les jeunes ils ne travaillent pas, ils s’amusent juste, et quand

026    Jos:    On (pourrait)
027    Tut:                    [pardon
028    Jos:    Ça peut aussi être négatif
029    Tut:    Oui voilà et pouvoir utiliser toutes ces choses parce que c’est

> quand même aussi des cadeaux, hM toutes les technologies, de

119   Rom:   C’est dur, c’est dur le violon mais ma plus grande difficulté

> c’était de rester debout apparemment je devais rester debout et ça
> c’était très dur pour moi
120          (2.0) ((Anne giggles slightly))
121   Rom:   Et c’est vrai il faut plusieurs années avant que ce soit acceptable

pour les oreilles d’autrui
122   Tut:   Oui, mais le piano après deux lessons c’est bon
123   Ann:   Et on peut être assis

124     Tut:    ET on peut être assis ((giggles)) et on peut jouer à deux
125     Ann:    Et on plus
126     Tut:    Et toi tu joues aussi un instrument ((looking at Anne))
127     Ann:    Du piano un petit peu il y a fort longtemps (.) vraiment il y a

> très longtemps (.) je n’ai pas été très douée d’ailleurs
128     Tut:    Bien
129     Rom:    (on dit toujours) 2% le reste
130     Ann:    Je n’ai jamais été très persévérant (2.0) probablement
131     Rom:    Mais encore tu (émet) des mélodies quand tu mets tes mains sur

((imitating putting hands on the piano))
132     Tut:    Vous avez un piano ici?

15. S5E1: 26.4.

01    Tut:     ((whispers))Ok alors un bonjour à jean-marie

02          ((Anne and Tutor wave at the camera))
03   Tut:   Bonjour jean-marie
04   Rom:   Bonjour jean-marie
05          ((Hamed leans forward and Josefa giggles)
06   Tut:   Alors Josefa la dernière fois on avait parlé des différents éléments

qui sont dans les classes
07   Tut:   Que qu’on apprend des citations par cœur et avant de les apprendre

par cœur on explique les différents mots aux enfants
08   Tut:   Et hm on fait la musique
09   Jos:   oui
10   Tut:   C’est comme ça aussi qu’on chante des prières ou des chansons
11   Tut:   Et après hm on raconte les histoires que souvent (ce sont) des

> histoires de la vie d’'Abdu'l-Bahá qui est l’exemple parfait de la
> vie bahá’íe
12   Tut:   Mais aussi d’autres histoires, mais très souvent c’est des histoires
13   Jos:   seulement
14   Tut:   C’est des histoires sur la vie d’'Abdu'l-Bahá
15   Tut:   Et après hm des jeux aussi des jeux dans des classes souvent des

jeux coopératifs (on joue) ensemble pour un but commun
16   Tut:   Et c’est là qu’on c’est arrêté donc on va continuer un peu sur les

jeux
17   Tut:   Donc ça c’est les différentes activités qu’on fait dans une classe
18   Jos:   D’accord
19   Tut:   Ok ?
20   Tut:   Hamed, tu veux commencer la section 9

((Hamed reads section 9 and section 10))
21   Ham:   Exercez-vous à expliquer trois jeux différents à vos collaborateurs
22   Tut:   ((giggles))
23   Ann:   ((looks up to Hamed, while smiling))
24   Tut:   Alors tu nous expliques ((giggles while talking))

25    Ham:   (je connais pas de jeux)
26    Tut:   Tu pourrais nous expliquer le jeu « porter le malade » et nous on va

> porter Romain à la cuisine ((giggles))((« carry the sick » )) is a
> game that was introduced and explained in section 10))
27    Rom:   D’accord
28    Ann:   Il faut vraiment le faire ?
29    Ham:   on a compris(2.0)
31    Ham:   Pourquoi est-il nécessaire de motiver les enfants et de leur

> expliquer le but du jeu, même s’ils sont déjà familiers avec le
> jeu ? ((Hamed goes on to read the next question))

16. S5E2: 26.4.
01    Tut:   Mais il faut aussi veiller hm à ce que les enfants n’ont pas

> seulement le plaisir, parce-que nous ont est tout le temps entrain
> de d’applaudir hm
02    Tut:   C’est important aussi qu’ils ont le plaisir de jouer pour le jeu de

> faire des actions pour les actions, de ne pas dépendre des adultes
> qui tout le temps encouragent
03    Rom:   Oui
04    Tut:   Là c’est aussi un peu la balance (2.0) à trouver hm
05    Rom:   Eh
06    Tut:   Qu’il n’ont pas seulement la joie de jouer parce que on est tout le

> temps entrain de faire les clowns ((lifts up her hands and shakes
> them))
07    Tut:   Mais qu’ils ont vraiment aussi le plaisir au jeu
08    Rom:   Donc de nouveau l’importance de bien expliquer les règles et de

canaliser hm
09    Tut:   [et de répéter aussi les jeux hm pour donner la chance parce que un

> jeu qu’on joue une fois hm on est plus encore concentré sur les
> règles et comment ça marche
10    Tut:   C’est après seulement qu’on peut hm avoir plus de plaisir et de

> devenir mieux au jeu je pense que c’est aussi on est de nouveau
> ((points briefly pen to Hamed)) à la repetition Mr Hamed
11           ((some short giggles))
12    Tut:   La dernière fois ((turning towards Josefa)) Hamed il a dit que la

répétition c’est la mère du savoir

13   Tut:   Quand on répète beaucoup les choses
14   Jos:   C’est vrai
15   Ham:   Mais c’est pas de moi
16   Tut:   Oui, tu as cité
17          ((some short giggles))
18   Tut:   Ok
18          (5.0)
a
18   Rom:   Est-ce-que les enfants doivent savoir parfaitement jouer au jeu pour
b           éprouver du succès ((reads question 3))
19          ((the section on games has been read and discussed; section 13 on

colouring has been read by the tutor))
20   Tut:   Donc les coloriages sont ici hm ((flicks through the pages of the

book)) (2.0) ((the participants also flick through their books))
21   Tut:   Mais moi je dois leur dire que ça n’éveille pas trop les sentiments

> de beauté ((she stresses the words « sentiments de beauté » with
> giggles))
22   Rom:   ((giggles))
23   Tut:   Je sais pas ce que vous en pensez? (2.0)
24   Rom:   Pour la plupart je suis d’accord avec toi (2.0)
25   Ann:   Mais il faut les colorier c’est peut-être (plus) ((raises her hand))
26   Rom:   Justement, voilà, ils ont tout misé là-dessus. ((giggles by Anne,

tutor and Josefa)) (2.0))
27   Tut:   Enfin c’est vrai il y a des enfants qui aiment colorier, mais on

> trouve aussi d’autres activités peut-être plus créatifs que enfin
> moi je suis pas trop pour le coloriage
28   Ham:   Il y a toujours la situation qui va avec c’est une leçon en meme

29   Tut:   Mais on peut aussi trouver d’autres (1.0) par exemple pour la

30    Tut:      voilà?
31    Ann:      (ceux qui ont) de l’imagination de
32    Tut:      Oui On peut se débrouiller comme ça ils aiment bien mais on peut

plus varier si on

01    Res:      Si vous voulez, on peut faire un petit tour, chacun s’exprime un

02              (2.0)
03    Res:      Ça va?
04    ?         Toi d’abord ((giggles))
05    Tut:      Oui ça nous intéresse
06    Ann:      Mais oui
07    Res:      Bon, c’est intéressant de noter que le programme du master

> s’appelle apprentissage et développement dans un contexte
> multiculturel et multilingue

18. INTS5E1: 26.4.
01    Ham:      Si j’ai développé ou changé, hm, ff, hm, (2.0) je dirais que oui,

> hm, mais peut être pas très <inaudible.1> en fait, dans un
> environnement, c’est basé sur des concepts, toute ma vie, rien était
> vraiment révolutionnaire pour moi,
02    Ham:      mais ce qui était dans ce sens nouveau pour moi, le développement

que je l’ai vu dans un contexte très pratique,
03    Ham:      et maintenant surtout en ayant deux enfants, on s’imagine vraiment

> le contexte, concret, dans tous ce qui, avant tous ces concepts
> c’était rien que théorique,
04    Ham:      on apprend, mais on ne réfléchit pas vraiment dessus, le

> développement pour moi était vraiment tout ce qui toujours, sans
> questions,
05    Ham:      mais maintenant, j’ai l’occasion vraiment de voir dans un contexte

> très réel, de ce point de vue là, c’est un développement qui se
> produit.
06    Jos:      Par exemple la partie (qui voir) le bien <inaudible.1> (transformer

toujours) le mal, même pour nous c’est très difficile, hm.

07   Jos:   ça on doit réellement travailler avec nous, pour que nous on passer

> ça vraiment à nos enfants, autrement ça va pas passer la
> canalisation, comme le jouet là, si nous on ne travaille pas, ca
> fait partie du développement, toujours écouter un peu, tout ca, pour
> soutenir vraiment (les) gens, nos enfants, nous-mêmes, d’abord pour
> nous même, sinon, ça ne va pas marcher pour les enfants (.) je
> pense (0.5)
08   Jos:   mais c’est un long travail parce que, éduquer nous-mêmes, ce n’est

pas si facile que ça. ((giggles by Josefa et Anne)
09   Ann:   C’est bien dit
10   Jos:   L’histoire de Bahá’u’lláh, qui est vraiment très belle, mais c’est

> vrai pour appliquer tous les jours, ce n’est pas si facile, mais on
> arrivera.
11   Ham:   Si je peux retourner, comme par exemple en fait, que (considérez)

> l’homme comme une mine riche en gemmes, est quelque chose, une
> citation qu’on a, que j’ai relu et entendu des milliers, et milliers
> de fois, mais c’était que des mots, mais maintenant, je me rappelle

> vraiment donné beaucoup de joie, c’est vraiment quelque chose qui
> (était) là, des mots très belles, une situation très <inaudible.1>,
> et en visualisant mon propre enfant dans ce contexte, ca fait battre
> le cœur un peu plus vite.
12   Ann:   Hm, mon développement, effectivement, comme on disait au début on se

> connaissait pas beaucoup, (ça crée) une certaine habitude, on se
> voit, les autres, le développement, une éducation à ce qu’il

13   Rom:   Moi je suis très content d’être avec vous ici ce soir, ((group

14   Res:   Tu as parlé aussi de toi, le développement chez toi?
15   Rom:   Je pense que oui, un grand oui, parce que comme disait Hamed, avoir

> compris d’une certaine manière certaines choses depuis certaines

> tout petit il a cette présence dans son éducation de ses valeurs hm,

16   Tut:   Hm, donc moi je suis tout au début de mon activité de tutrice,

> ((giggles)) et j’ai fait tout plein de Ruhis ((the sequence of

17   Res:   Et tu as trouvé quelque chose qui te permet maintenant
18   Tut:   [Pour l’instant je suis très <inaudible.1> quand je suis moins

21    Rom:   Tu sens que tu te développes, dans ton rôle de tutrice, tu sens

qu’il y a un
22    Tut:   [pas aussi vite que j’aimerais ((giggles)) je me sens pas encore

03    Ann:   Ah d’accord, mais dans le Ruhi 1 ça m’avait déjà BEAUCOUP

embêté ((giggles by Josefa))
04    Tut:   Donc c’est pas mieux dans le Ruhi 3 ?
05    Jos:   Peut-être il fallait changer un peu, dans la façon un peu

plus adulte
06   Ann:      Ou c’est voulu
07   Rom:      Forcément c’est voulu, à ce niveau, c’est (2) comment vous

avez appris
08   Res:      Mais là, je vois chez Anne, ça devient presque un obstacle, à

09   Tut:      Hm ((agreeing))

8\.3 Appendix: Data collected: Documents
8\.3.1 Document 1: Learning through the Ruhi Institute
The Ruhi Institute curriculum had been tested and adapted over many years. It has enabled the
friends in different countries to get the institute system up and running in a short time. Rather than
having the participants be passive listeners to a wide array of unconnected talks, the Ruhi Institute
materials seek to engage the friends fully in the process of learning. Bahá'ís with diverse cultural
and educational backgrounds have found the curriculum's deceptively simple approach, based
heavily on connecting the believers to the Creative Word, both appealing and empowering
(International Teaching Centre, 2000, p. 5).

8\.3.2 Document 2: Collaborative Study for Individual and Social

Transformation
At the heart of the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the force of transformation, both of the individual
and of society. The transformation of the individual is not an isolated process, not ascetic nor
centered wholly on one’s self-fulfilment. In Bahá'í terms, the process of one’s individual
development and fulfilment is tied to the centering of one’s energies on the betterment of
humankind and serving the needs of the community and the larger society.
Prayer and meditation, fighting one’s spiritual battles, living according to spiritual laws and
teachings—all are essential elements in fulfilling life’s purpose, but such efforts reach their fullest
transformative effect when they are dedicated to service.
Thus, Bahá'ís are actively engaged in developing knowledge, skills, and spiritual insights that
enable them to act as effective human resources and which are vital to the integrated process of
personal and social transformation. Presently, such collective learning takes the form of study
circles—a local, collaborative, self-directed learning process being undertaken by Bahá’í
communities around the world. All are welcome in the classes, regardless of their ideas or beliefs.
By learning about our spiritual reality and our individual role in the progress of society, we can
better understand our purpose in life and the way to improve our own lives and the lives of those
around us.
Participants in the courses learn, for example, to teach values to children, to engage in community
service activities, to assist and empower others to independently investigate spiritual truths, to
learn how to competently express one’s views, and to engage oneself in serving the broader needs
of society for unity, justice, and equity.
Participants in study circles often experience a new sense of direction in life, better relationships
with family and friends, and a fruitful re-evaluation of the contribution one can make to the wider
community (Bahá’í International Community, 2011a).

enables materials and methods to benefit from the experience of the Bahá’í community worldwide
in their use, ensuring their continued efficacy. [...]
With loving Bahá’í greetings, Department of the Secretariat

8\.3.4 Document 4: Object of every religion
Appendix A: A national education program: core curriculum for spiritual education
Is it not the object of every Revelation to effect a transformation in the whole character of
mankind, a transformation that shall manifest itself, both outwardly and inwardly, that shall affect
both its inner life and external conditions? For if the character of mankind be not changed, the
futility of God's universal Manifestations would be apparent (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of
Bahá'u'lláh, p. 25, Compilations, NSA USA - Developing Distinctive Baha'i Communities)
8\.3.5 Document 5: Dialogical process
Individual interpretation rarely remains wholly personal. One studies the teachings and derives
insights, but inevitably, these views are shared with others in a dialogical process that guides the
collective quest for intersubjective agreement upon which action rests. This consultative process
is to be conducted in a manner that preserves unity while striving to achieve Bahá’u’lláh’s
purpose for humanity. In such a dialogue, individual opinions “lack authority,” and a person is to
“offer his own idea as a contribution to knowledge, making it clear that his views are merely his
own.”
While “every believer is fully entitled to voice” personal views, these ideas “can never be upheld
as a standard for others to accept, nor should disputes ever be permitted to arise over differences
in such opinions.” Such views are to be expressed without pressing them on fellow believers. And
it is then incumbent upon the listener not to suppress the views of others, which would be a
restriction of individual freedom, but to respond in a tolerant, dispassionate and courteous way
(Lample, 2009, p. 35).
8\.3.6 Document 6: Investigating reality like a ‘scout’
The learned Bahá’í is not an “impartial observer.” The resolution of important questions requires
more than the application of methods of the natural sciences. It is not possible to stand apart from
the community to study it without influencing it or being influenced by it.
Perhaps the learned Bahá’í is more like the “scout” who helps to guide an expedition on a journey
into unexplored territory. This role involves investigating the unknown and generating and
applying knowledge to contribute to the success of the mission at hand. It is someone who
participates actively in the journey, but whose specialized knowledge, skills, and experience
informs various aspects of the struggle to make progress: constructive perspectives into the past,
present, and future; insight and technical capacity for ongoing study of the Text; problem posing
and problem solving; the defining of culture and intercultural relations. On this journey, the
learned individual/scout does not have authority, and, while making a vital contribution, like any
other participant is fallible and learns over time.
One of the distinctions often made between the natural and social sciences is that in the natural
sciences, the study is of objects; in the social sciences the study is of people—“the object is a
subject.”78 This presents a special challenge to the social sciences because not only are
researchers attempting to make sense of their studies, but the people they are attempting to
understand are also continually engaged in an ever-changing process of interpretation and action.
The implication of this specific challenge is not that one cannot conduct research in areas that
pertain to human beings, but rather, that in doing so one must be aware of the inherent limitations
and potential consequences in order to determine how best to be effective (Lample, 2009, p. 152)

8\.3.7 Document 7: Tutor and student as collaborators
TO THE COLLABORATORS
The Ruhi Institute uses the term “collaborators” to refer to all who study, teach or apply its
courses, wherever they may reside. These participants are indeed collaborators, because all
share the Institute’s purpose: to use the courses as means of serving the Cause and promoting
the well-being of humanity. In every study group there is always a more experienced person
who acts as a tutor. The other members of the group constitute the “students” who seek the
tutor’s help with their studies. However, it is clearly understood by all participants that they
are engaged in a reciprocal process, one in which everyone learns. The responsibility of
learning rests with each participant. It is the student who undertakes the active work of
learning. The tutor facilitates this process and also gains new insights into the material. The
relationship is not that of a learned one with a group of ignorant people (Ruhi Institute, 1999,
p. 1).
8\.3.8 Document 8: Towards a Bahá’í educational system
The first unit of the book, "Some Principles of Baha'i Education", is concerned with certain basic
concepts. There is no educational system in the world today that can properly be called "Baha'i".
Such a system can only be created through the efforts of numerous educators working in diverse
settings and cultures over an extended period of time. Nevertheless, certain principles and
concepts can be identified that should influence endeavours to develop elements of Baha'i
education, and this unit briefly examines some of them.
One of the basic concepts discussed in the unit is the nobility of man. It is essential for the
participants in the course -- future teachers of children -- to understand the impact this extremely
important principle will have on the kind of education he or she will eventually offer. By the
mere acceptance that each student is a "mine rich in gems of inestimable value", the teacher of a
beginning children's class takes an enormous step away from current educational practices. Yet
the acceptance of this concept is not, in itself, sufficient. Baha'i teachers should also be familiar
with the nature of spiritual qualities and know enough about human talents and capacities to be
able to discover these gems in their students and actively help polish them. They also have to be
fully aware of the importance of helping children develop habits and patterns of behavior that are
in keeping with a Baha'i way of life.
In general, this unit is not complex and, like all Ruhi Institute materials, is taught in courses that
are conducted tutorially. This is best done by dividing the participants into small groups and
allowing each group to move along at its own pace and according to its own rhythm. This point is
crucial, because an attempt to accelerate or slow down any participant's pace, forcing him or her
to move at the same rate as the others, can hamper the learning process. In this respect it should
be noted that the tutor's role is not any less important for the fast learners than it is for those who
learn at a slower pace. The tutor should discuss all of the sections with each group of students. A
Ruhi Institute course should not be treated as an independent study by the participants, the results
of which are merely checked by the tutor. Some discussion with the tutor is needed so that
participants understand the materials presented in each section at three levels of comprehension:
the meaning of the words and sentences, the application of the concepts in one's life and work,
and their implications for certain related situations (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 1–2).

8\.3.9 Document 9: Acquisition of knowledge
A Problem of Knowledge
[...] there is a process of understanding and action in which the Bahá’í community explores
reality, grows in comprehension and knowledge, unifies thought, and contributes to transforming
the world in accordance with the truths expressed in Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation (Lample, 2009, p.
161).
We need to become conscious that any contemporary understanding of an evolving Faith must be
to some degree imperfect; that over time, through the processes that Bahá’u’lláh has put into
place, we can create a community more closely attuned to His will and purpose—and indeed we
must constantly struggle and sacrifice in order to do so; that the acquisition of knowledge through
science and religion is the motive force driving progress; and that acquisition of knowledge must
be associated with action and reflection on action. We face, therefore, not the contending
alternatives of liberalism and fundamentalism, each of which contains aspects that contradict the
teachings; rather, we are collectively attempting, under the guidance of the Universal House of
Justice, to define a course along the “Straight Path” that avoids the dangers of “irresponsible
freedom” and “extreme orthodoxy.” What is necessary, as we increasingly elucidate and refine
understanding and practice in the Bahá’í community, is to recognize that Scylla and Charybdis
are, after all, myths (Lample, 2009, p. 189).
8\.3.10 Document 10: Limits on understanding
The Bahá’í Writings place definite limits on understanding. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that human
beings cannot know the essence of a thing, but only its qualities.25 He also states that all ways of
human knowing—reason, tradition, the senses, and inspiration—are fallible, and therefore must
be checked against one another.26 Science, then, is extolled for its powers of empirical
investigation and reason, but its limitations are also acknowledged. Religion takes its place along
with science as a means for investigating reality, educating humanity, and contributing to the
advancement of civilization (Lample, 2009, p. 175).
8\.3.11 Document 11: Education and Consultation
Bahá'ís see education in terms of the knowledge, qualities, skills, attitudes, and capacities that
enable individuals to become conscious subjects of their own growth, and active, responsible
participants in a systematic process of building a new world order. Ongoing education is at the
very heart of any healthy Bahá'í community. Successful community action requires the
development of each person's capacity for intellectual investigation. Through community
consultation, members learn to analyze social conditions and discover the forces that have caused
them. In order to contribute to consultation on community problems and generate plans, each
person must develop the ability to express ideas and listen carefully to others. A well-educated
community member is a determined yet humble participant who helps overcome conflict and
division, thereby contributing to a spirit of unity and collaboration (Bahá’í International
Community, 1990).
8\.3.12 Document 12: Understanding our being-in-the-world
According to Bernstein, if we want to exorcise the Cartesian Anxiety, then we need a different
way of thinking and of understanding our being-in-the-world. If we are dialogical beings—always
engaged in conversation, interpretation, and action—then the dynamics of understanding underlie

and pervade all human activity. At the same time, there is a need to preserve the
Enlightenment/Cartesian meaning of truth: that all claims to truth can withstand evaluation by a
community of interpreters based on a commonly agreed upon standard of acceptability. In the
final section of his book, Bernstein gives a summary of the views of four different philosophers—
Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, and Hannah Arendt— and puts forward a description
of the elements of the new conversation he sees. Its features may be summarized as follows:
There are no universal frameworks for knowing; however, progress is possible. Instead of
considering knowledge as a platform on which you stand as a bedrock of certainty, perhaps it
might be more accurate to compare knowledge to a rope that is “connected” from above to some
aspect of truth about reality. Humanity struggles unsteadily to climb this rope to achieve higher
understanding. Thus, there is no secure basis on which we stand; certainty lies beyond our grasp,
but we advance in knowledge indefinitely. At a certain point, a particular “rope”— some body of
knowledge or theory—takes us only so far, in which case we transfer to a new rope that takes us
further in our understanding of reality.
Knowledge is obtained through a process that associates hermeneutics and praxis, that is,
interpretation and action. Of course, there are specific circumstances when a particular method
has been proven to be effective in uncovering or applying knowledge within fixed circumstances.
Examples include certain methods for conducting scientific experiments, for constructing a
building, or for growing a particular crop. But the advancement of the field itself—science,
architecture, agriculture—takes place in a context of learning that encompasses hermeneutics and
praxis.
Understanding is a form of practical reasoning and practical knowledge. As a community acts, it
engages in the judgment and discourse of everyday practice. Such reasoning involves mediation
between the universal and particular. It includes practical application of value judgments. Human
beings aspire to universality even though they know every claim to it is fallible. Indeed, all speech
presupposes universal claims. When consensus in a community breaks down, as in the case of
questions of rightness or appropriateness, then discourse is needed to re-establish the collective
agreement on which further action depends.
The investigation of reality and discovery of new knowledge comes from a community in
discourse. There is a communal character to rationality and decisions are not arbitrary or
subjective. There must be conscious effort to foster the emergence of dialogical communities in
the political, scientific, and other realms. Bernstein explains that vestiges of positivism / scientism
/ absolutism that impose an orthodoxy in the name of scientific truth have to be uprooted in order
to allow for learning and practical wisdom. It must also be affirmed that there is access to truth
that is available to humanity outside the functioning of normal science.
As a community engages in dialogue, a tradition emerges over time. Historical experience is an
important contribution to understanding. A tradition shapes the investigator of truth, it defines the
evolving set of standards, practices and understandings that enables the community to distinguish
between truth and error, and it is the repository for the body of knowledge accumulated over time.
The tradition must be living—that is, open to influence from the unknown that it encounters,
allowing itself to be reshaped and refocused. Otherwise, it becomes fossilized and, gradually, a
collection of superstitions. Different traditions interact in an encounter of horizons that reshapes
each.
On some questions, at a given point in history, two inquirers can come to different conclusions
without either using faulty logic or method. The standards for making judgments evolve over time

as part of the learning process of a community. At a certain point in history, standards may not
exist for resolving a contradiction. In this case, judgment must be withheld, and parallel paths of
action or experimentation permitted. Time will tell, allowing the better arguments, standards, and
practices to eventually demonstrate their superiority (FUNDAEC, 2010, p. 92–93).
8\.3.13 Document 13: Learning as action, reflection, consultation and study
It will proceed naturally as the friends in every cluster persevere in applying the provisions of the
Plan through a process of action, reflection, consultation and study, and learn as a result. (Ridván
Messages, Ridván 167, 2010)
8\.3.14 Document 14: The Independent Investigation of Truth
Baha'u'llah emphasizes the fundamental obligation of human beings to acquire knowledge with
their "own eyes and not through the eyes of others." One of the main sources of conflict in the
world today is the fact that many people blindly and uncritically follow various traditions,
movements, and opinions. God has given each human being a mind and the capacity to
differentiate truth from falsehood. If individuals fail to use their reasoning capacities and choose
instead to accept without question certain opinions and ideas, either out of admiration for or fear
of those who hold them, then they are neglecting their basic moral responsibility as human beings.
Moreover, when people act in this way, they often become attached to some particular opinion or
tradition and thus intolerant of those who do not share it. Such attachments can, in turn, lead to
conflict. History has witnessed conflict and even bloodshed over slight alterations in religious
practice, or a minor change in the interpretation of doctrine. Personal search for truth enables the
individual to know why he or she adheres to a given ideology or doctrine.
Bahá'ís believe that, as there is only one reality, all people will gradually discover its different
facets and will ultimately come to common understanding and unity, provided they sincerely seek
after truth. In this connection, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said:
Being one, truth cannot be divided, and the differences that appear to exist among the many
nations only result from their attachment to prejudice. If only men would search out truth, they
would find themselves united.
And further: The fact that we imagine ourselves to be right and everybody else wrong is the
greatest of all obstacles in the path towards unity, and unity is necessary if we would reach truth,
for truth is one (Bahá’í International Community, 2011b).
8\.3.15 Document 15: Understanding and Memorization
To the collaborators
The methodology of the children’s classes combines different activities, all focused on the
principle goal of motivating the development of attitudes and spiritual qualities. All these
activities revolve around the Creative Word, which alone has the power to awaken spiritual
susceptibilities in the children, and a strong emphasis is placed memorizing the Creative Word.
Memorization has an even greater effect if what is being memorized is well understood. For this
reason, each lesson includes material to help children understand the meaning of the quotation, as
well as activities to help further this understanding. Unfortunately, at this point, there is not an
abundance of songs, games and stories which directly reinforce the ideas presented in the

quotations to be memorized. It is hoped that, in the future, many more such activities will be
created and compiled for the use of Bahá’í children’s class teachers (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 3)
8\.3.16 Document 16: Memorization
Unit 1
Section 1 [...] By studying the following quotations of Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá you will
begin to appreciate your work as a children’s class teacher. It will help you to memorize these
words and have them always in mind when you teach. [...]
“Blessed is that teacher who shall arise to instruct the children...”
“Among the greatest of all services that can possibly be rendered by man to Almighty God is the
education and training of children....”
“According to the explicit divine Text, teaching the children is indispensable and obligatory. It
followeth that teachers are servants of the Lord God, since they have arisen to perform this task,
which is the same as worship. You must therefore offer praise with every breath, for you are
educating your spiritual children.”
Section 3 [...] “Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone,
cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.”
Section 4 Now, memorize the above words of Bahá'u'lláh [...].
Section 8 [...] Read and memorize the following words of Bahá'u'lláh:
“Whoso ariseth among you to teach the Cause of his Lord, let him, before all else, teach his own
self, that his speech may attract the hearts of them that hear him.”
Section 10 [...] Memorize the following words of Bahá'u'lláh:
“Let God be your fear, O people, and be ye of them that tread the path of righteousness” (Ruhi
Institute, 1995).
8\.3.17 Document 17: Memorization
Some principles of Bahá’í education – Section 3
After you have explained to the children the meaning of a quotation, the next step is to help them
memorize it. Surely, in your life you have memorized many quotations and poems. How can this
be done? Once the meaning of a quotation is understood, memorizing it is very simple. The
quotation is divided into parts and you begin by memorizing the first part. Later, the second part
is learned, and then both parts are repeated together. You continue in this way until the entire
quotation is learned by heart. For example in order to learn the prayer in Section 2, you begin with
“Oh God, guide me ...,” and ask the children, sometimes individually and other times as a group,
to repeat the words. Then you combine “Oh God, guide me” with “protect me ...,” repeat the two
phrases together, then add “...make of me a shining lamp...,” and so on with each phrase until the
end of the prayer. Once the whole group of children has repeated the entire prayer, each child is
patiently helped to recite the prayer by heart.
Undoubtedly, as a conscientious Bahá’í teacher, you will with to begin your new tasks by
teaching yourself. Therefore, when you look at the 15 lessons for children presented further on in
this unit, dedicate some time to studying the meaning of the quotations, thinking about examples

given to clarify the meaning for the children, and memorizing the quotations (Ruhi Institute,
1995, p. 27)
8\.3.18 Document 18: The Aim of Education

Education is a continuous and creative process. Its aim is to develop the capacities latent in
human nature and to coordinate their expression for the enrichment and progress of society.
Within this creative process, it is possible to achieve harmony between faith and reason through
an approach to education that encourages the free investigation of reality and trains minds to
recognize truth, irrespective of its origin.
Today’s worldwide educational crisis calls for a global redefinition of education in order to
emphasize its transformational role in both individual lives and social organization. It is necessary
to define concepts such as basic education, literacy, and vocational education in a way that does
not limit the horizons of the great majority of humanity to the acquisition of a few skills and the
grasp of a few facts. The minimum requirements of education need to be conceived in terms of
the understanding of basic concepts and the development of qualities, attitudes, skills and abilities
that enable individuals to become conscious subjects of their own growth and active, responsible
participants in a systematic process of building a world civilization.
An educational approach aimed at personal growth and societal transformation must admit that
when words and actions are not directed by a moral force, scientific knowledge and technological
know-how conduce as readily to misery as they do to prosperity and happiness. But moral values
are not mere constructs of social processes. Rather, they are expressions of the inner forces that
operate in the spiritual reality of every human being, and education must concern itself with these
forces if it is to tap the roots of motivation and produce meaning and lasting change.
Within this context we propose that programs of literacy and basic education look beyond the
skills of reading, writing, and simple arithmetic and also consider the following achievements as
compelling goals for their participants:
-   The realization that it is chiefly service to humanity and dedication to the unification of

> humankind that unlock individual capacity and release creative powers latent in human
> nature.
-   The understanding that the mere knowledge of principles is insufficient to ensure personal

growth and social change, that both require the exercise and application of will.
-   A firm conviction that human honor and happiness lie in self-respect and noble purposes, in

integrity and moral quality, and not in the pursuit of wealth and power for their own sake.
-   A reasonable degree of excellence in at least one productive skill through which individuals

> can experience the truth that work is worship when performed in a spirit of service, and can
> secure the means of existence with dignity and honor.
-   An adequate understanding, at least in the local context, of some of the concerns of programs

of social progress, such as health and sanitation, agriculture, crafts, and industry.

-   Some development of the individual’s capacity for intellectual investigation as a

> distinguishing power of the human mind and as an indispensable instrument for successful
> community action.
-   Some capacity to analyze social conditions and discover the forces that have caused them, and

> a corresponding ability to express ideas, so as to be able to contribute to consultation on
> community problems.
-   The capacity to take part in community planning and action as a determined yet humble

> participant who helps overcome conflict and division and contributes to the establishment of a
> spirit of unity and collaboration.
-   A disposition to analyze and a desire to understand the features of different forms of

government, law, and public administration (FUNDAEC, 2003, p. 17–18).

8\.3.19 Document 19: Content and expected outcome of learning
Instructions to the tutor
Participants should be divided into groups, allowing each group to move along at its own pace
and according to its own rhythm, so as to facilitate the learning process (in the case study, there
was only one group of 4 participants).
The tutor should discuss each section with each group of students, so that they understand the
content at three levels of comprehension: the meaning of words and sentences, the application of
the concepts in one’s life and work, and their implications for certain related situations (the first
and second level has been observed during observations of the case study).
What participants are expected to know after completing Ruhi book 3: Unit 1
There is no educational system in the world today that can be properly called “Bahá’í”.
Understand some of the basic principles of Bahá’í education of children.
-   The nobility of man, accepting that each student is a mine rich in gems, and understanding the

impact of this principle on the education offered.

-   Being familiar with the nature of spiritual qualities.
-   Knowing about human talents and capabilities that allow the discovery of the gems in their

students and actively help polish them.
-   Helping children to develop habits and patterns of behaviour that are in keeping with a Bahá’í

way of life.

What participants are expected to know after completing Ruhi book 3: Unit 2
Learn to teach simple children’s classes consisting of memorization of prayers and quotations,
songs, stories, games and colouring.
-   The tutor should allow a great deal of time for the future teachers to practice giving the

> classes as they study the course (None of the four participants have taken the course in order
> to give children’s classes. Their first motive was in educating their own children. This is
> documented in the written questionnaire).
-   The unit offers suggestions to counteract the normal tendency for participants to recreate for

> them the same learning experiences they had in their own formative stages (Here is good
> example of an evolving element in conceptual framework for social action, as the following
> generations would have received more appropriate learning experiences).

-   The emphasis is on the development in the children attitudes and spiritual qualities that will

> bring them closer to God. Establishing the foundations of the child’s character take priority
> and are followed by giving general knowledge about the Faith in later years. Instructions
> given in Ruhi book 3 to the tutor as to how the course should conducted.
-   The methodology of the children’s classes combine different activities, all focused on the

> principal goal of motivating the development of attitudes and spiritual qualities. The activities
> revolve around the Creative Word, which alone has the power to awaken spiritual
> susceptibilities in the children, and a strong emphasis is placed on memorizing the Creative
> Word. Memorization has an even greater effect if what is memorized is well understood. Each
> lesson includes material to help children understand the meaning of the quotation as well as
activities to help further this understanding.
o Constant practice will enable participants to tell stories of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the Exemplar

> of Bahá’í life, and to remember the details that give excitement to a story and present
> the events in an effective way.
o It is advisable that participants start out alongside experienced teachers or with a

> small number of children (four or five). It is possible to teach only certain elements
> (quotations, or a story) at the beginning, and as confidence develops, introduce more
> elements and more children.
o Songs used in the lessons accompany the material and many more are available

> online. They help the teacher and the children to learn how to sing the songs (Some
> participants play the guitar and played with the group, teaching them songs).

What participants are expected to know after completing Ruhi book 3: Unit 3
-   Participants develop the skills and abilities needed to conduct classes for children, managing

> the class with a great deal of love and understanding and, at the same time, with the discipline
> necessary to create a proper learning environment. Participants should achieve a balanced
> understanding of how to keep a class happy and full of love, yet also highly disciplined. They
> should develop a capacity to inculcate in each child the spiritual discipline that results from
> love and trust in God, and not impose discipline through fear of punishment.
-   Participants should consult upon each section, together with their tutor, a person that is more

experienced (Ruhi Institute, 1995).

8\.5 Appendix B: Consultation
The administrative bodies of the Bahá'í Faith at all levels use a distinctive method of non-
adversarial decision-making, known as consultation.
The principles of consultation were laid down in Bahá'u'lláh's writings and, as a procedure for
building consensus and investigating truth, they have the potential for wide application. Indeed,
Bahá'ís have found them to be useful in virtually any arena where group decision-making and
cooperation is required. These principles are used not only by the Faith's own institutions, but in
Bahá'í-owned businesses, in Bahá'í-operated schools, and in day-to-day decision-making of Bahá'í
families.
In essence, consultation seeks to build consensus in a manner that unites various constituencies
instead of dividing them. It encourages diversity of opinion and acts to control the struggle for
power that is otherwise so common in traditional decision-making systems.
Bahá'í consultation is based on the following principles:
   Information should be gathered from the widest possible range of sources, seeking a

> diversity of points of view. This may mean making special efforts to seek the views of
> specialists--such as lawyers, doctors, or scientists. It may also mean looking for
> information outside traditional specialties or making a special effort to consider the views
> of community members from diverse backgrounds.
   During discussion, participants must make every effort to be as frank and candid as

> possible, while maintaining a courteous interest in the views of others. Personal attacks,
> blanket ultimatums and prejudicial statements are to be avoided.
   When an idea is put forth it becomes at once the property of the group. Although this

> notion sounds simple, it is perhaps the most profound principle of consultation. For in this
> rule, all ideas cease to be the property of any individual, sub-group, or constituency.
> When followed, this principle encourages those ideas that spring forth from a sincere
> desire to serve, as opposed to ideas that emanate from a desire for personal
> aggrandizement or constituency-building.
   The group strives for unanimity, but a majority vote can be taken to bring about a

> conclusion and make the decision. An important aspect to this principle is the
> understanding that once a decision is made, it is incumbent on the entire group to act on it
> with unity--regardless of how many supported the measure.

In this sense, there can be no "minority" report or "position of the opposition" in consultation.
Rather, Bahá'ís believe that if a decision is a wrong one, it will become evident in its
implementation--but only if the decision-making group and, indeed, the community at large,
support it wholeheartedly.
This commitment to unity ensures that if a decision or a project fails, the problem lies in the idea
itself, and not in lack of support from the community or the obstinate actions of opponents
(Bahá’í International Community, 2011d).

Revelation (R2)

the Universe (S2)
Level     Revelation that can be known; the revealed
2       Word of God; the Book and its authoritative             physical and human reality; facts,
interpretation                         patterns and laws of creation that can be

known by the human mind

The body of religious knowledge, including              (the body of scientific knowledge,
Level       methods and moral social practice (R4)               including methods and standards of

inquiry and justification
practical knowledge associated with               technology and practical knowledge
Level    spiritual life and moral social practice (R4)        associated with material progress. (S4)

Table 12: Perspective on Reality (Lample, 2009, p. 121)
I see in this table the two sources of knowledge available to humanity; a religious and a scientific
source. Level 1 represents a reality beyond the reach of scientific investigation. I know about this
reality through the religious source of knowledge, represented in the table as R2-4.
(R2) represents the Revelation that can be known, the revealed Word of God; the Book and its
authoritative interpretation. S2 represents the laws of nature, the facts of the physical world, and
the mental and social dimensions of humanity, summarized as “the universe”. These are aspects
of existence that are potentially discoverable by humanity. Human knowledge can be divided into
two levels that are essentially integrated; a level that represents the knowledge system of science
(S3), with a distinct body of knowledge that grows and evolves over time through the application
of accepted methods, and a level that represents the technical or practical knowledge derived from
the application of scientific knowledge or from practice to contribute to an ever-advancing
civilization and which is comparable to religious practice (S4).
The conception of truth varies in relation to each of these levels of comprehension. The truth that
is associated with the essential nature of reality is beyond human capacity to even contemplate
(level 1). Humanity attempts to investigate the truth that corresponds with reality as manifested in
the text of the Revelation (R2) and the physical and human world (S2). Because of the limitations
of human capacity, we cannot achieve this level of understanding. Yet, we also cannot avoid the
implications of the truths of reality. The mutable knowledge that constitutes the horizon of human
comprehension is continually tested against the brute facts of physical reality, through the
understanding and methods of the scientific community (S3), and against the verses of
Revelation, through the understanding and methods of the religious community (R3). Truth, at
this third level, is justified knowledge, and represents humanity’s best insight into the universe
and Revelation (S2 and R2). Such truths are subject to alteration or refinement over time as more
profound understandings that encompass and transcend previous notions emerge through practical
action to shape society (S4 and R4) (Lample, 2009, p. 121).

8\.7 Appendix D: A perspective on history
While a comprehensive theory of history demands the examination of numerous factors and the
description of their operation in various realms of social existence: religious, political, economic,
and cultural, I describe below a general outline that is internally consistent of a perspective of
history in 11 elements, an interpretation able to withstand critical analysis in light of the data
available about humanity’s past. It is my summary from an online course entitled: Specialisation
in Education for Development, Constructing a Conceptual Framework for Social Action
(FUNDAEC, 2010) that I recently completed.
1\. Every created being evolves towards its stage of maturity. As it evolves, it has requirements

> and opportunities for development. Challenges are continuously present throughout this
> process.
2\. Humanity can also be viewed as an organic entity that, in its collective life, undergoes

> evolution towards maturity. Its evolution is not linear but filled with advances, setbacks,
> tragedies and triumphs.
3\. Today, humanity stands at the threshold of maturity. This stage is apparent especially in the

phenomenal expansion of human knowledge.
4\. The distinguishing attribute of this maturity is the unification of the human race. It is an

> organic process and requires a complete reordering of the life of the individual, the life of the
> community, and the structure of society.
5\. The transition to maturity is characterized by the interplay of two sets of forces, constructive

> and destructive. One is responsible for unprecented turmoil in society, while at the same time
> breaking down barriers that hinder the unification of the human race. The other gives rise to a
> new and steadily growing system, founded on the principles of oneness and justice.
6\. There is purpose in the creation of the universe. For the individual it is the development of

> spiritual qualities and perfections, and advancing towards God. Neither idle worship nor a life
> dedicated to the pursuit of worldly desire will help achieve this purpose. Activity in the arena
> of the collective life of humanity, selfless service to society is called for.
7\. To carry forward an ever-advancing civilization is the purpose of the collective life of

> humankind. This civilization has two essential components, material and spiritual, both of
> which need to advance simultaneously if humanity is to achieve prosperity and true
> happiness.
8\. What causes ultimately the advancement of civilization is the progressive education of

> humanity by the Manifestations of God, in accordance to the requirements of the particular
> stage in the development of humanity, expanding the provisions of the previous set of
> teachings.
9\. Science and religion are the two knowledge systems that propel the progress of civilization

> and that are necessary for its proper unfoldment. Science without religion becomes the victim
> of materialism and generates tools of destruction. Religion without the light of science and
> reason degenerates into superstition.

10\. The present age is a period in human history of great regeneration, marked by spiritual vigour.
11\. Purposeful evolutionary processes allow for ample room for the will of the individual and of

> the collectivity. The way knowledge is generated and used influences the outcome. A
> continual battle between the forces of knowledge and blind imitation, between moral courage
> and vain desire goes on at the center stage in the unfolding drama of history.

8\.10 Appendix G: Government minister praises Baha'i contribution to

Luxembourg
24 July 2011
LUXEMBOURG CITY, Luxembourg — The Luxembourg Baha'i community's
involvement in society has been praised by a high-ranking government minister on a
special visit to the national Baha'i centre.
Minister of Finance Luc Frieden made his remarks at a celebration marking National Day,
the official birthday of His Royal Highness Henri, Grand-Duke of Luxembourg.
Citing the importance of the values of tolerance and unity, the minister expressed the
government's gratitude to the Baha'is for their commitment to the life of the country.
"The value of a religious community, or any other organization, should be a reflection of
the contribution it makes towards the development of society," said Mr Frieden.
To that end, Mr Frieden spoke of the importance of people being involved in the
community in which they live, "looking more to the common good and the effects of their
actions on others."
Amir Saberin, the chair of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Luxembourg
described the occasion as "very historic and significant for us."
"For the first time, Mr Frieden came in order to show the government's appreciation and
recognition of the work of the Baha'i community," said Dr. Saberin.
"He wanted to know what we are doing practically. We talked about education and how
we are particularly trying to be involved with our fellow citizens to give responsibility to,
and develop the potential of, young people."
Dr. Saberin also mentioned the situation in Iran today where young Baha'is are barred
from entering university, and their subsequent efforts to continue their education are
branded as illegal.
In response, Mr Frieden expressed his support for an increased focus on education,
mutual respect and the "fundamental values inherent to all civilization."
The minister was accompanied at the event – which took place on 21 June – by two
deputies of the Luxembourgish Parliament, Martine Stein-Mergen and Fernand Kartheiser
(Bahá’í World News Service, 2011)

8\.11 Appendix H: Ruhi 3 book cover

8\.12 Appendix I: Description of the data collected, in chronological order
I have collected between December 2010 and July 2011 the following excerpts:

1. INT01: Interview 1 - 12.10.2010

I interviewed the tutor at her home before the start of the study course, and asked her a
number of questions, videotaped and archived under folder: dataset 1.

2. WQ01: Written questionnaire 1 - 25.01.2011

I asked the tutor to take a moment at the start of session 1, at the home of Anne and
Romain, so that the participants could fill out the following short questionnaire. Four
sheets of paper were collected from the four participants, three were written in French and
one in Portuguese. I have collected the texts, transcribed and translated them. They are
archived under folder: dataset 2.

3. S1E1: Session 1, 1 - 25.01.

I had requested that the tutor videotapes the sessions. The first session started as the
participants greet me through the camera that stands at the corner of the living-room.
Participants sit around a small coffee table on a canapé and a sofa. Romain and Anne, the
hosts, share one course material.
At the very start of session 1, just after 9 minutes, Anne is commenting on a sentence that
they had just read in the text, in section 1, page 7 of the curriculum, where participants are
asked to decide whether a number of statements are true or false. The second question
states: Lorsque nous enseignons les enfants, nous adorons Dieu. vrai  faux. Before
line 1 of the transcript, the tutor asks the participants whether they have any reflexions or
questions.

4. S1E2: Session 1, 2 – 25.01.

Session 1 was videotaped by the tutor at the home of the participants Romain and Anne.
Four participants were present: Romain, Anne, Hamed, and Josefa. Session 1 is archived
under folder: dataset 3.
This passage takes place immediately after Hamed has read section 4, page 9 in the
curriculum. Section 4 reads as follows:
Now, memorize the above words of Bahá'u'lláh, [Regard man as a mine rich in gems of
inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to
benefit therefrom.] and think about the following questions: What are some of the gems that we
possess? Can we consider the virtues latent within us, such as love and kindness, justice,
truthfulness, constancy, integrity, and sincerity, as some of these gems? What do you think about
the capacities of the human mind, its powers to discover the world of nature, to produce beautiful
works of art, to express beautiful and noble thoughts? And what would happen without true
education? Could we show forth all of those treasures which God has conferred upon us? Consult
about these ideas with the participants in your group (Ruhi Institute, 1995, p. 9).

N0: Note 0, 26.01.
I received this note from Romain with the initial answers to the questionnaire at the start
of session 1. At that time, I had already shared some initial thoughts about my research
with the participants.

5. S2E1: Session 2, 1 - 02.02.

Session 2 was videotaped by the tutor at the home of the participants Romain and Anne.
Participants present: Romain, Anne, Hamed; absent: Josefa; two new participants joined:
Pia, and Francine. Session 2 is archived under folder: dataset 4.
This is a passage from Section 9 in the curriculum, stating that “ to succeed in teaching
heavenly virtues to children, you must sow the seeds of love for God and fear of God in the pure
soil of their hearts”, and that “they should learn that we were created out of the infinite love God
has for His creatures, and that we are continually protected and nurtured by this love” (Ruhi
Institute, 1995, p. 13). The tutor then starts a discussion by stating how the concept of the
fear of God is a difficult one. Others share their understanding and the tutor mentions how
the German translation of the word fear may be helpful in understanding the concept. A
discussion follows.

6. N1: Note 1 – 17.3.

When I picked up the video tape from the tutor on 17.3.2011 and I asked her how the
course came along she gave me this update:
a. Anne will stop attending the class, had already worries with book 1, but for the 3 rd

session had planed something else. This info comes from Romain, her husband.

b. Pia had to stop attending, due to other commitments.
c. Francine and Josefa are still attending, but have to be reminded to come.

7. INTS3: Interview before Session 3, 19.3.

This is the very start of session 3. Hamed, Romain and the tutor are present. The greetings
to me, while not present physically but through the camera are followed by the questions
that the tutor is asking the participants, upon my request, about the influence the course
might have on them in their daily lives. This is videotaped and archived under folder:
dataset 5.

S3E1: Session 3, 1 – 19.3.
Analogy as a tool for explaining
This is an instance where the tutor shares an analogy with the participants. Hamed has
read section 13, point K. Page 21. The curriculum presents in this section a number of
situations that could easily occur in the children’s classes. Participants are asked to apply
the principles that they have learned thus far in order to resolve them. Fifteen situations
are given with three or four possibilities or other possibilities to be completed by the
participants. Here is the text from the curriculum that Hamed has just read:

> K. One little girl has problems learning in a group. She sits alone in a corner, playing, and
> does not pay attention in class. The teacher notices that the child does not understand
things as well as others. What can the teacher do?

> 1. Call her back to the group and tell her that by paying more attention she will
> understand things better.
> 2. Punish her for being naughty.
> 3. Have her leave the class because, with 20 other students in the class who want
> to progress, the teacher does not have time to spend with a child who is always
> behind.
> 4. Since she is not interrupting the class, let her do what she wants; while others
> are working on individual projects, dedicate special time to her.
8. S4E1: Session 4, 1 – 29.3.

Session 4 was videotaped by the tutor at the home of the participants Romain and Anne.
Participants present: Romain, Anne, Hamed; absent: Josefa. Session 4 is archived under
folder: dataset 6.
Stories as a tool for learning - Stories too difficult
This passage is taken from session 4, where the group is starting the 2nd part of the
curriculum: learn to teach simple children’s classes, consisting of memorization of
prayers and quotations, songs, stories, games and colouring. The tutor comments on the
15 stories for children in the curriculum. Section 5 starts with a text that encourages
participants to carry out the activity of storytelling. After having read the text, three
questions were asked in the course: why are stories important in a child’s education? Who
is 'Abdu'l-Bahá? Why is it important to learn stories about the life of 'Abdu'l-Bahá? Then
the tutor starts by asking the participants what they have to say on the subject of
storytelling.

9. S4E2: Session 4, 2 – 29.3.

Memorization as a tool for learning

Romain makes a comment about this during session 4.

10. S4E3: Session 4, 3 – 29.3.

Memorization as a tool for learning
The tutor remembers that Hamed, one of the participants made a comment about the
concept of repetition, who said that “repetition is the mother of knowledge”.

11. S4E4: Session 4, 4 – 29.3.

Humour - Chanting as a tool for memorization
In session 4, section 4 page 27, Anne has just read the passage that encourages
participants to sing spiritual songs with the children which fill their hearts with happiness.
The text includes a quotation by 'Abdu'l-Bahá:
The art of music is divine and effective. It is the food of the soul and spirit. Through the power
and charm of music the spirit of man is uplifted. It has wonderful sway and effect in the hearts of
children, for their hearts are pure, and melodies have great influence in them. The latent talents
with which the hearts of these children are endowed will find expression through the medium of
music.
The curriculum goes on to suggest that participants learn the songs of the 15 lessons of
this unit well, either from the tutor or with the help of a cassette.

12. N2: Note 2, 16.4.

Regarding the subject of attendance, I had asked the tutor by email on the 16.4.2011
whether she knew who would come to session 5 on 26.4.2011 apart from Anne and
Romain, she replied a day later, saying:

13. S5E1: Session 5, 1 - 26.4.

Session 5 was videotaped by the tutor at the home of the participants Romain and Anne.
Participants present: Romain, Anne, Hamed, Josefa. Session 5 is archived under folder:
dataset 7.
Participants greet the researcher – Tutor gives summary of last session to Josefa
Tutor starts the session 5 by whispering to the group to greet the researcher. The tutor
gives a brief summary of the last session to Josefa, who was absent. The excerpt precedes
the reading of section 9, page 32, on the topic of the games presented in the 15 lessons for
children.

14. S5E2: Session 5, 2 - 26.4.

I interviewed the tutor and the 4 participants after session 5. This is audiotaped and
archived under folder: dataset 7.

Playing games - Instance of remembering something a participant said regarding
repetition and memorization
Section 12, page 33 stresses the importance that children experience a sense of success
and that the role of the teacher is very important in achieving this. Participants are asked
to consult on these questions:

> 1.    How does a teacher contribute to the children’s sense of success?
> 2.    Which actions of a teacher contribute to the children’s sense of failure?

15. INTS5E0: Interview after Session 5, 0 – 26.4.

Instance where two participants express their interest in the research I conduct with the
study circle.

16. INTS5E1: Interview after Session 5, 1 - 26.4.

Interview about development
After session 5, I joined the group to give them a brief update on my theoretical ideas for
the master thesis. I then asked them their own development after 5 sessions of learning
together. I did this in the group through an audio recording.

17. INTS5E2: Interview after Session 5, 2 - 26.4.

Historicity, at the start of expansive learning
During my interview with the group I had commented on my observations that not all of
the tools for learning, suggested in the curriculum were used. This started the discussion
below.

18. WQS6E1: Written Questionnaire after Session 6, 1 - 5.7.

Upon my request, the tutor gave the participants a short written questionnaire after
session 6 to fill out. The tutor however did not fill out the questionnaire. This is archived
under folder: dataset 8.
The participants had completed 6 sessions and only 1 session remained. I decided to ask
them note down their thoughts on the following two questions: one thing they had learned
and what they will do now. The tutor had answered the questions.

19. WQS6E2: Written Questionnaire after Session 6, 2 - 5.7.

When the tutor gave me the completed questionnaire on 22.7.2011, she had not answered
the questions. I asked her to send them to me by mail. I received her comments on
27\.7.2011. This is archived under folder: dataset 8.

> (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, #106, p. 133)
> “According to the explicit divine Text, teaching the children is indispensable and obligatory.
> It followeth that teachers are servants of the Lord God, since they have arisen to perform this

> are educating your spiritual children.”
> (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’í Education - A Compilation, p. 33)

Sections 4, 5 & 6 – No Quotations
> “As to thy question regarding the education of children: it behoveth thee to nurture them at
> the breast of the love of God, and urge them onward to the things of the spirit, that they may
> turn their faces unto God; that their ways may conform to the rules of good conduct and their
> character be second to none; that they make their own all of the graces and praiseworthy
> qualities of humankind; acquire a sound knowledge of the various branches of learning, so
> that from the very beginning of life they may become spiritual beings, dwellers in the
> Kingdom, enamored of the sweet breath of holiness, and may receive an education religious,
> spiritual, and of the Heavenly Realm. Verily will I call upon God to grant them a happy
> outcome in this.”
> (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, #122, p. 142)
> “Whoso ariseth among you to teach the Cause of his Lord, let him, before all else, teach his

> “The Tongue of My power hath, from the heaven of My omnipotent glory, addressed to My
> creation these words: ‘Observe My commandments, for the love of My beauty.’ Happy is
> the lover that hath inhaled the divine fragrance of His Best-Beloved from these words, laden
> with the perfume of a grace which no tongue can describe.”
> (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Aqdas, pp. 20-21)
> “Let the flame of the love of God burn brightly within your radiant hearts. Feed it with the
> oil of Divine guidance, and protect it within the shelter of your constancy. Guard it within
> the globe of trust and detachment from all else but God, so that the evil whisperings of the
> ungodly may not extinguish its light.”
> (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, CLIII, pp. 325-326)

UNIT 3 – Conducting Classes For Children
Sections 1, 2 & 3 – No Quotations

> “Every day at first light, ye gather the Bahá’í children together and teach them the communes

> should this be necessary. It is not, however, permissible to strike a child, or vilify him, for
> the child’s character will be totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or verbal abuse.”

9 ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Jean-Marie NAU est gestionnaire de l’organisme de formation professionnelle continue
No 109024, MINISTERE DES CLASSES MOYENNES, DU TOURISME ET DU LOGEMENT.
Il a un parcours professionnel riche en expériences linguistiques et multiculturelles. Il a travaillé
et enseigné à Haïfa en ISRAEL, à Belfast en Irlande DU NORD, à Saarbrücken en Allemagne et à
Longwy en France. Depuis 1998 il enseigne au Luxembourg où il s’est spécialisé dans
l’apprentissage de la langue luxembourgeoise.
Dans le cadre du Projet MOIEN, (projet de formation, élaboré en 1996 à la suite d’une demande
du Conseil National pour Etrangers qui vise à favoriser l’apprentissage de la langue
luxembourgeoise par les étrangers ayant accès au marché du travail luxembourgeois) Mr Nau a
participé aux formations de formateurs et a contribué en tant que formateur au succès de ce projet.
Parmi les nombreuses formations, on retrouve :

> -   L’approche communicative basée sur la méthode structuro-globale audio-visuelle
> -   L’approche simulation globale
> -   L’audit linguistique
> -   L’évaluation des compétences
> -   L’ingénierie pédagogique
> -   La nouvelle orthographe luxembourgeoise
> -   La suggestopédie
> -   Les compétences de communication à l’oral
> -   L’évaluation des compétences
> -   La gestion de groupes hétérogènes
> -   Les compétences de communications (compréhension écrite et expression orale)
> -   Lëtzebuergesch Phonetik

Il a également participé aux formations en didactique de la langue luxembourgeoise pour adultes,
organisées par le Ministère de l’éducation nationale, de la formation professionnelle et des sports,
ainsi que la formation : Le cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues et portfolio des
langues.
Mr Nau utilise dans ses cours de langues des méthodes innovatrices comme l’apprentissage à
travers les jeux et les chansons. L’accent est mis sur la compréhension et l’expression orale, ainsi
que l’histoire et la culture du Luxembourg à travers des visites de musées et d’institutions
culturelles et publiques. Mr Nau est également guide touristique officiel de la Ville de
Luxembourg.
Au cours de ces onze dernières années, Mr Nau a pu former plus que 1800 apprenants de langue
luxembourgeoise, dans diverses structures et centres de formation. (Centre de Langues,
Luxembourg www.cll.lu ; Communes de Walferdange www.walfer.lu, Steinsel www.steinsel.lu ,
Koerich www.koerich.lu, Luxembourg-Ville www.vdl.lu, Kopstal www.kopstal, et Capellen
www.mamer ; Centres de Gériatrie à Hamm et Pfaffenthal ; Commission de Surveillance du
Secteur Financier www.cssf.lu ; Centres d’accueil et Crèches dans le cadre du Projet MOIEN ;
Institut National d’Administration Publique www.inap.public.lu/ ; Centre National de Formation
Professionnelle Continue à Esch www.cnfpc.lu ) ; Objectif Plein Emploi www.ope.lu, et Zarabina
www.zarabina.lu .
12 à 15 participants, venant de différents pays, ayant des origines, des cultures, des croyances
variées, forment le noyau d’une classe typique. C’est cette richesse culturelle que Mr Nau utilise
et qu’il met au service de l’apprentissage de la langue luxembourgeoise. Une pédagogie qui est
basée sur la curiosité naturelle et spontanée de tout être humain, son désir et sa volonté de
communiquer.
Une partie du cours vise à responsabiliser l’apprenant en lui offrant une large de gamme de
stratégies à sa disposition afin de lui permettre d’atteindre son but : comprendre et parler le
luxembourgeois. A cette fin sont mis à sa disposition touts les outils pédagogiques existants,
comme l’utilisation des nouvelles technologies et des médias sociaux. (www.elearning.lu , site
d’introduction à l’apprentissage du luxembourgeois ; www.eurotalk.com , logiciel interactif d’apprentissage
du luxembourgeois, avec une interface d’une centaine de langues; www.transparent.com , languages of the
world, logiciel d’apprentissage du luxembourgeois à télécharger directement du site.)
Nouveaux horizons
Depuis 2009, Mr Nau s’est engagé dans une nouvelle expérience, en commençant avec
l’étude du Master multi-LEARN, Learning & development in multilingual and
multicultural contexts, à l’université du Luxembourg. Ce programme innovateur et
interdisciplinaire lui a permis d’explorer des processus d’apprentissage divers. Mr Nau
souhaite poursuivre ses recherches en explorant davantage les processus d’apprentissage
qui promeuvent la cohésion sociale et d’équité en matière d’éducation.

Since different identities and activities are enacted in and through language,
the study of language is integrally connected to matters of equity and justice

(Gee, 2005, p. 22)

True learning is that which is conducive to the well-being of the world
