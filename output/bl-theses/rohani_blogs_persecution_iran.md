> **Abstract:** This dissertation will demonstrate how the modern communication form of ‘blogging’ has been used by writers to highlight the issue of human rights. ‘Blogs’ are an aspect of online participatory culture and interactive communication channels have emerged from this platform. The case of Iran’s Baha’i community has been documented online; this independent world religion has some six million adherents worldwide, but is officially outlawed in the Islamic republic of Iran. This has been noted by various; academics, journalists and non-governmental organisations as an issue of social concern, what has uniquely been addressed in this research is the role blogs are playing as interactive channels reporting on the ongoing persecution of the Baha’is in Iran.
> 
> This is viewed from those who blog from outside of Iran, since the Middle East faces many restrictions on freedom of speech and authors can face censorship. As well as using an online survey to gain an understanding of an international but closely knit blogging community, a multi-method documentation of the individual dynamics of the posts of the Muslim Network for Bahá’í Rights blog has been implemented. This blog has promoted its cause since 2007 by using; collaborative blogging, viral videos, podcasts and comics. This research concludes that such a blog has effectively used innovative media to enhance its coverage of the persecution of members of the Bahá’í Faith.
