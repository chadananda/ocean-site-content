ABSTRACT

This study examines the rise of the Babi movement in its first phase (1844-
47), the formative period which has been less fully explored than later phases
(1847-52) but deserves a thorough critical examination. An attempt has been
made to explain the complex relationship between the intellectual and social
aspects of the movement; ideas, events and personalities are seen in a wide
historical perspective, and the early impact of the movement on 'ulama, tujjar
and other groups in Iranian urban society, and the reactions it evoked from them,
are examined.

The first two chapters deal with the intellectual and social climate of Iran
in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, with particular attention to the
development of milleharian ideas. Chapters III and IV are concerned with the
process which eventually gave birth to the movement. The early life of Sayyid
^Ali Muhammad, the Bab, his family background and personal characteristics are
discussed in some detail, so as to show the external influences and inner
experiences which finally brought him to proclaim a new 'revelation' in 1844.
The conflicts and confusions within the Shaykhi ranks, which served as a stimulus
to the conversion of those Shaykhi students who formed the first Babi nucleus in
Shiraz, are examined; so too the traditional Shi^i ideas and their similarities
and differences with the new doctrine.

Chapters Five to Seven study the earliest Babi attempts in the ^Atabat and
Iran to spread the new message to specific groups, and to a wider public in
general, and the opposition first of the religious authorities and then of the
secular power. Chapter Eight is a case-study of the growth of the early Babi
community in Khurasan, within the context of socio-political change, the pattern
of the local economy, and inter-communal links in the small rural and urban
centres.  Chapter Nine, finally, looks at the Bab's own efforts to declare his
mission to a wider public; however circumstances forced him to reinterpret the
mission in a symbolic way, and for the first time the enormous practical problems
which faced the expansion of the movement were realised.

NOTE ON TRANSLITERATION

The system of transliteration adopted both for Persian and Arabic is that
of IJMES with modifications.   Words which occur frequently appear without
diacritical marks; therefore Bab, Babi, Shaykhi, Shi^i, Sufi, ''ulama* appear as
Bab, Babi, Shaykhi, Shi^i, Sufi and ''ulama.   Well known place-names are either
written in their common forms (as in The Oxford Atlas} or without diacritical
marks; therefore Tihran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz are written Tehran, Isfahan,
Shiraz and Tabriz. The less known place-names are fully transliterated. Karbala*
is transliterated according to its Persian pronounciation, Karbila'. Names of
people are all transliterated, Persian and Persianized names as pronounced in
Persian and Arabic names as in Arabic; Husayn is transliterated as Husain and
Tahira as Tahirih. Technical terms which exist both in Persian and Arabic are
transliterated according to the original language of the text; for example risala
in Arabic and risatih in Persian. The silent h ( -kyd*j-fr A ) in Persian is
represented by ih or occasionally ah, but in Arabic always by a. The Arabic
definite article at- ( J') is not assimilated to the noun; for example Nasikh
al-Tawav-ikh and not Nasikh at-Tawarikh or Nasikh ut-Tawarikh. Persian works with
Arabic titles are transliterated in their Arabic forms: Tadhkirat at-Wafa* and
not Tazkirat at-Vafa y . The Letter (ayn ( £) is represented by "''" and hamza
( *), regardless of its bearer, is "»".

INTRODUCTION

This study is an attempt to write the history of the Babi movement - an
effort to understand, rather than criticise or praise, the ideas and acts of
people who lived in a world widely different from ours and had hopes and
aspirations different from those of our time. What has been recorded of them
in most accounts presents them either as condemned heretics or revered saints,
depending on the point of view of the writer, and these views have rarely been
impartial and still more rarely, consistent. The history of the Babi movement
has not only been distorted by hostile chroniclers and biographers but often
misunderstood by the pro-Babi hagiographers. In spite of the relative richness
of the primary sources, little attempt has been made to give a thorough critical
account of the movement or to put it in the broader context of the social and
intellectual developments of the time.   It is therefore necessary to go behind
these accounts and try to discover what they have omitted.    In order to do this
it would be necessary to see the movement in connection with the main events of
Iranian history in the early 19th century. Seen in this light, like any other
millenarian movement, it will help us to understand people whose ideas and
activities are largely absent from the historiography of the time. Millenarianism
is a key to understanding the aspirations of those who were outside the circle
of the learned or those who were on the border between the world of scholarship
and popular belief.  Although it contains ideas and beliefs which may seem
totally unconventional and unacceptable even by the standards of its time,
nevertheless it has its own 'logic 1 and system of thought.   Millenarianism is a
hidden current which weaves its course in and out of the political and social
history of the period. It can only be clearly observed and understood if and
when its inner 'logic' is understood.

The study of millenarian movements is one of the more recent undertakings
of modern historiography.   The contributions of western historians have largely
focussed on the social and political aspects of these movements in given
circumstances, and to a lesser extent on the ideas and beliefs which were held
by them as a kind of political idealogy .     The study of millenarianism both

from the theological and social points of view is a formidable task compared to
other more conventional forms of historiography.        This is not only because of
the complexity of the issues or the multifaceted        and often cryptic nature of
the messianic claims, but also because records of these movements are scarce and
often poorly preserved.     The biased treatment of the official accounts and the
low standard of historiography in modern Iran makes this task more formidable.

In the Islamic past, the distinction between millenarian thought, or what
more precisely could be defined as belief in a millennium, and actual millenarian
movements was very clear.     As far as the theory was concerned, the expectation
of the return of the Mahdi was linked with principles of Ma^ad or Qiyamat
(Resurrection) and therefore was integrated into the body of Islamic popular
belief.   In practice, however, any attempt to realise these expectations or to
anticipate their near fulfilment naturally met with the greatest resistance from
the religious authorities.        These movements in general were usually referred to
as constituting heresy (rafd, zandaqa, hartaqa).       The theoretical beliefs held

by the millenarians were classified under a wide range of general terms from
'innovation' (bid^at) and extremism (ghuluv} to disbelief (ilhad) and apostasy

(irtidad) ; more precisely, the claim to the advent of the Mahdi was defined as
id&fa-yi Mahdaviyat.   The social and political movements to which they gave rise
were often referred to as fitna or fitnih (in a literal sense, revolution) .

> IV (VII) pp.303-460, throws some light on the subject of the Concealed Imam
in Ithna ^Ashari Shi^ism.
In Shi 1 Islam, the concept of the Advent or Manifestation (Zuhur)  of the

Qa'im is much more deeply assimilated into the body of general doctrine. The
belief in the advent of the Qa'im (the Twelfth Imam, Muhammad   ibn Hasan in Ithna

(Ashari Shi''ism) which is prophesied in innumerable eschatological traditions,
made Shi^ism the most appropriate ground for the continuous renewal of millenarian

> claims. Indeed it may be argued that the whole of the Shi (ism is bound up with
> these expectations. Throughout Ithna ^Ashari history, the belief in the
> continual presence of the Twelfth Imam in Concealment inspired many to claim
> that they were delegated by him rather than themselves claiming the position of
Qa'imiyat. Deputyship (NZyabat), Gateship (Babiyat), Vicegerency (Khilafat) and
Guardianship (Vilayat) were different definitions of the same original function
of representing the Qa'im in a world which was not yet prepared for the advent
of Baqiyatallah (the Remnant of God) . In Shi^i society this yearning for the
Zuhur penetrated deeply into the minds of ordinary people who saw in the appear-
ance of the Imam, or to a lesser extent in the appearance of his assumed agents
and representatives, some hope for Salvation.

A brief survey of the intellectual history of Shi^ism, from the earliest
days up to modern times, reveals that the two major currents of thought, which
may be loosely defined as 'orthodoxy' and 'heterodoxy', developed parallel to
each other. The informal trends of 'heterodoxy' survived in the Shi^i environ­
ment in spite of constant opposition from the secular authorities. Sometimes
covered by a cloak of mysticism, sometimes as a minor part of the main body of

and perhaps misleading, to draw a clear line between 'orthodoxy' and 'heterodoxy'.

It has often been the case that after a short outburst of millenarian activities,
the ideas and beliefs which they had left behind gradually created a whole
spectrum of beliefs and practices which could hardly be classified under either
of those two general definitions. Nevertheless, outlinesmay be formulated of
the chief characteristics shared by many of these movements from the early Shi^i
sects up to the IsmaTli, Hurufi, Nuqtavi, Shi^i-Sufi orders and Shaykhis. But
the similarities which exist do so more as a result of factors such as identical
textual and oral traditions, comparable social and intellectual circumstances
and the presence of similar forces of opposition than because of any direct link.
These factors often led to the rediscovery of esoteric themes which were always
present in the Shi ^i environment.

'Heterodox' doctrines are identifiable by their strong emphasis on eschato-
logical aspects of religion. Almost without exception they contain some form
of redemptive, resurrective or prognostic message which is primarily based on
the extensive, and often diverse Shi''i millenarian traditions. Depending on
the direction in which these doctrines are developed, it is believed that either
the forthcoming Final Day or the advent of the Qa'im is preceeded by a fore­
runner whose function is to expound the impending events in terms of past
prophecies. It is this strong emphasis on the eschatological future which has
provided the necessary pretext for the messianic leaders or their followers to
question the-legitimacy of the established system. By claiming a direct and

intuitive contact with the divine source, the preachers of messianism by-passed
the formal barriers of established authority.

Such systems of thought had certain predominant characteristics. The first
was the presence of a 'holy' figure who was regarded by the believers as the
source of divine inspiration and the only link between this world and the world
beyond. The second was the existence of esoteric forms of 'knowledge* as well
as symbolic practices. Though the 'holy' figure was not always responsible for
the actions or the aspirations of his followers, his sole existence was regarded
as the major proof of the legitimacy and truthfulness of the new mission. His
visible austerity and piety, his preoccupation with esoteric and unconventional
knowledge, and his mortifications and sufferings, sufficed to put him in the
eyes of believers above any religious or temporal authority.

A wide range of esoteric symbols and images which had special appeal to
believers was used in order to explain the inner secrets of the new 'revelation'.
These 'secrets' were meant to clarify the ambiguities of the Book and the
traditions only to a close circle of intimate followers who were capable of
'tolerating' the 'truth 1 which ordinary people might find 'terrifying' and

unacceptable. Special attention was paid to 'cognition' (ma^r-ifat) and the
knowledge of the 'internal' (bat-in), in order to enable the followers to go
beyond the boundaries of 'dogma' and into the realm of 'pure religion*. The
messianic future which was promised by millenarians, was indeed a nostalgic and
symbolic one: a return to an idealised past which they believed could only be
materialised with the return of the equally idealised 'Promised One' who had
'true 1 descent from the 'holy branch' of the prophethood and possessed qualities
of 'infallibility', 'divine inspiration' and material superiority.

Messianic movements no doubt had a concealed socio-political message. The
concepts of Resurrection, the Final Judgement, vengeance against the oppressors
and the ultimate victory of 'good' against 'evil' had a general appeal to the
underprivileged and less educated public as well as to many sophisticated and
more learned groups. The millenarian mission made it possible for individuals
from different backgrounds to envisage a common cause and a common destiny since
spiritual salvation inflamed a hope for a final victory against the dominating
forces of the time. The message evoked the inner emotions and aspirations of
men who saw in the new 'revelation' all the divine attributes, and through it
wished to gain immortality and salvation. The teachings of these movements,
contrary to those of 'scholastic' theological disciplines, were chiefly based on
the non-rational and mystical aspects of religion which elevated the believers
from their troublesome world of appearance to the fascinating realm of saints
and prophets, and allowed them to imagine themselves as symbolic embodiments of
past heroes.

It is for this reason that millenarian thought often gave rise to active
social and political movements. Three main features may be identified in such
movements. The first is that a majority of them were urban phenomena. It was
in the cities that messianic ideas could grow into full scale movements. To
say this is not to rule out the possibility of millenarian claims arising in non-
urban settings. There are examples of messianic ideas which first appeared in
a rural and tribal environment, but with few exceptions they all later transferred
to cities where they found the suitable conditions to grow into a movement. In
cities the dissident urban 'intelligentia' had the opportunity to mobilise the
urban public or certain sections of it, under the messianic banner. Groups
which did not necessarily lack economic means, but were threatened by political
or economic upheavals, were particularly attracted to movements which promised
them spiritual consolation for their worldly sufferings and agonies.

Secondly, these movements usually appeared at times of crisis, but more
particularly at those moments when some degree of security and prosperity was
still maintained in the community. Contrary to what might appear in the first

instance, the effects of messianic movements at times of total insecurity and
anarchy were minimal. This was because in these circumstances the collapse of
the internal urban order, which was usually caused by violent incursions from
outside, did not allow the popular forces with a messianic idealogy to be formed.
A majority of these movements emerged when the cities could afford some degree
of internal order, but only enough to show the sharp contrasts between
conflicting interests, contrasts which were often sharpened by sudden changes in
population, fluctuations in the local economy and threats from outside forces.
Yet the relationship between the socio-political situation and the rise of
messianic movements was much more subtle than some have suggested. Contrary to
what might first appear, the public move towards messianism was not made in order
to regain or to improve a threatened or a lost political or economic status but
to take refuge from material problems in the world of Utopian hopes and promises.
Thirdly, the message of these movements, however crude and incoherent in
comparison to orthodoxy, served as a popular ideology for the ordinary man. In
most cases it preached a radical and even violent change and in some, it
compensated for the lack of clear political orientation and the passivity of
the religious leadership. This sense of extremism not infrequently caused the
retreat, defeat and even total annihilation of the movement after a certain
period of time but occasionally it also resulted in an internal reconstruction
of the movement as a tolerant and compromising 'sect' capable of producing a new
'orthodoxy 1 or submerging itself in the existing one.

Millenarianism expressed itself in various forms. Sometimes it showed
itself in those moderate expectations and speculations which may frequently be
found in the works of theologians and other serious writers as well as in the
words of preachers, wandering dervishes and other popular figures. However
implicit or indeed insignificant and trivial these prognostications may appear
to the mind of the modern man, yet even in their most concealed forms they were
regarded by 'orthodoxy' as signs of deviation and disbelief. The other forms
of messianic expression appeared in the claims and divinations of those
individuals who because of their assumed 'inspiration', their piety, their holy
descent, or their 'divine' knowledge, regarded themselves as standing in close
proximity to a sacred character whose imminent manifestation was expected in the
near future. But as far as the established authorities were concerned, the
threat of these sporadic claims was not so great as long as they were confined
within their limits and had no determined following or coherent doctrine. The
real threat came from another form of millenarian expression. Messianic move­
ments and revolts which usually appeared at the end of a long period of wide­
spread speculation and in an atmosphere which was charged with anticipations of

Zuhur, presented the real danger to the established doctrine.       They contained

controversial ideas, which in spite of their logical or practical shortcomings
were still capable of convincing large multitudes of their legitimacy.         These
movements were formed around a central figure and consisted of a nucleus of
devoted followers who together had the collective aim of fulfilling the 'Signs'
of the Final Day.     The ideas and messages adopted by these forms of millenarianism
were often a popularised version of themes which had been previously contemplated
by earlier generations of 'serious' and 'learned' divines and scholars.        Though
in their theological content they seldom passed the limits of the accepted
prophecies, it was in the interpretation of these prophecies, and still further
in the purpose for which such interpretations were made, that they widely
differed from their learned predecessors.      The theoretical framework of millen-
arian movements may have remained more or less the same, but it was the hopes
and the expectations of the converts which changed in the course of time.

In spite of their diversity in both theory and action, the essence of these
movements, whether they took         the form of pure theological speculation,
popular preaching, prophetic claims or proper millenarian movements, was of a
similar nature.      For all of them there was a yearning for change from old to
new.      It was the idea of establishing the 'true' order which caught the

imagination of the millenarians over the centuries but nevertheless, the
realisation of this 'true 1 order, no matter how much it was interpreted or

> justified in terms of past ideals and inherited values, was still an attempt to

> ism was the message of a changing age which was expressed in the language of a
distant past.

The transitional period of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries marks the start of a new era in the history of modern Shi fi millenar­
ianism.     General developments in the history of Iran during this period, from
the last years of Karim Khan's reign (1163-1193/1750-79) up to the middle of
the nineteenth century, hastened the formation of new trends .       Currents of

messianism continued to function as the voices of protest, while the forces of
the secular and religious authorities constantly suppressed their successive
outbursts. The interplay between nostalgic idealism and material necessities
created moments in which messianism occurred as a natural response to the
problems of a changing age.

From the political point of view, this period begins with the rise of Aqa
Muhammad Khan to power (1779-97) and ends with the appearance of the earliest

symptoms of a significant change in the power structure of the state in the
1840's. The period consisted of successive sequences of political turmoil
followed by phases of relative stability and security. After the death of Karim
Khan, in a long series of civil wars, Aqa Muhammad  Khan eliminated all his rivals

and finally managed to establish the Qajars on the throne. Fath• fAli Shah's
reign (1797-1834) brought a relative calm and stability to the country, yet

throughout this period signs of conflict and chronic disorder hardly ever
disappeared. A central government which relied for its stability on a growing
bureaucracy, a tribal military force and a network of princes and notables who

> governed provinces, was the basis of the Qajar state in this period. Powerful
sons of Fath fAli Shah such as (Abbas Mirza in Azarbaijan, Husain ^Ali Mirza in

Fars, Hasan ''Ali Mirza Shuja 1' al-Saltanih in Kirman (and then in Isfahan),

Muhammad ''Ali Mirza Daulatshah in western Iran and Muhammad   Vali Mirza in

Khurasan, created well-established, almost autonomous provincial governments
with their own courts, bureaucracy and military forces. Ruthless and efficient
as they'might appear, the provincial governments were only partly able to control

(sometimes only within the boundaries of provincial cities) those semi-
authonomous local powers who were quick to react against the government when there
was any threat to their carefully guarded interests. When they could come to
terms with this local power, however, the provincial governments were able to
establish self-contained provincial units which were almost free from intervention
by the central government. Some sort of understanding between the provincial
government and the urban notables, the tribal chiefs and major landowners in the
province secured the interests of all parties involved while it often forced the

central government to be contented with an unguaranteed annual revenue and

occasional verbal tributes.
Under Muhammad Shah (1834-48/1250-64) the pattern began to change. Though

the structure of the bureaucracy and military remained as before, their power
and efficiency started to decline, thus affecting in a broader way the central
administration which itself was suffering from mismanagement, rivalry and
foreign intervention.  The effectiveness of the provincial governments was
reduced, mainly because of a change which took place in the methods of appointing
governors . The financial difficulties of the central government were not helped
by the chronic deterioration in the collection of taxes and revenues. Yet
changes within the central government were not felt by the ordinary man directly
as much as by way of their local repercussions. It may be argued that centrali­
sation, or indeed the lack of it, was always the chronic problem for any
political system in pre-modern Iran. Nevertheless it should be noted that this
semi-authonomous provincial system worked reasonably well for the greater part
of the period between the turn of the century and the beginning of the 1830 f s
before deteriorating towards the end of Fath ^Ali Shah's reign. What Muhammad

*                             •

Shah inherited from his predecessor was a weaker provincial administration and
a stronger local resistance which could not easily be controlled by the unstable
and often incompetent officials.

This process of change from a relatively stable to an unstable provincial
government can be seen in the province of Fars in a way which was broadly
similar to other provinces. Under the governorship of Husain  ^Ali Mirza (1810-

-35) some revival in the local trade and economy (in continuation of Karim Khan's
time) made Fars the second most prosperous province after Azarbaijan in the
whole of the country. Yet this fragile security seldom prevented the intensi­
fication of internal conflicts both in and out of the city. Frequent tribal
resurgences, inter-tribal clashes, incursions into towns and villages, and the
disruption in the security of the roads are particularly visible from the
beginning of the 1830 ! s onwards. To this must be added an increase in the urban
conflicts between the city notables which often resulted in violent clashes
between city divisions and full-scale riots.

If the chronic vacillations inside the socio-political system were
instrumental in preparing the social ground for the emergence of millenarian
responses, the threat from external forces also facilitated this process.
During the first few decades of the 19th century the threat of the neighbouring
powers was first seriously felt in the north. The Qajars' successive defeats

1.   See below Chapter Six, Section I.

in two rounds of Russo-Persian wars, which resulted in considerable territorial
losses to their expansionist neighbour, generated fear of a total takeover not
only amongst members of the political elite, but in a wider scale among the
ordinary people. The further consolidation of the British position on the other
hand, particularly after the annexation of Sind in 1843, created a similar
anxiety in the south. Indeed, from the time of Muhammad  Shah's unsuccessful

Herat campaign in 1835-6, which was mainly frustrated because of a change in
British policy in Afghanistan, the presence of the British and their readiness
to use military force to secure their interests in the area, were fully realised
by the Iranian government. But it was from the beginning of the 1840 f s that
the increasing interventions of the rival powers in the internal affairs of
Iran went beyond the diplomatic and political levels and began to affect the
whole economic, monetary and commercial structure of the country. Fears of this
foreign threat, of which the real nature was largely unknown to ordinary people,
hardly ever manifested themselves in a sense of patriotism or the possibility of
the breakdown and fall of the Qajars, which would even have been welcomed by the
people. Nor was the response to the unknown danger expressed in any effective
protest at economic dislocations caused by the western powers. What caused

this sense of gradual decline and subjection which preoccupied the minds of a
great many millenarians both in the circles of the learned divines and in the
sphere of popular religion.

The purpose of this study is to examine the rise of the Babi movement as the
final result of a long millenarian process. The first part of the study (Chapters
One and Two) deal with various manifestations of millenarianism in the late 18th
and early 19th centuries. This serves as a general background to the developments
which eventually culminated in the Babi movement. The second part (Chapters
Three and Four) deal more specifically with the formation of the Babi movement
both by looking at the early life of Sayyid ''All Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab, and

by examining the circumstances under which the actual 'proclamation 1 of the Bab
took shape. The third part (Chapters Five to Nine) discuss the early expansion
of the movement between 1844 and 1847 (1260-63), the formation of the early
circles, the persons and groups involved and the earliest setbacks which came

following the responses of the opposition.   The main emphasis of the study as a
whole is to illustrate the way in which a millenarian movement comes into
existence, the nature of its claims, the background of the persons involved,
and the circumstances under which messianic claims turn into a millenarian
movement. No attempt therefore has been made to study the chronological history
of the movement in a systematic way or to discuss the events of the later years
(1847-52), save for some scattered references. The aim is to arrive at a more
comprehensive understanding of millenarianism from both the intellectual and
social points of view and to show how the two aspects are inseparably inter­
mingled.   Contrary to the view which treats the movement either as a 'heresy 1
or in more impartial terms, as the outcome of a theological (or religious)
mutation and contrary also to the opposite view which interprets the rise of
the movement purely in economic and political terms without paying any serious
attention to the theoretical content of the Babi message, here some efforts
have been made to draw a parallel comparison between the two aspects in order to
show the delicate and subtle relationship between intellectual and spiritual
concepts on the one hand and social and political conditions on the other.
The subject of the study dictates the method and the approach. The Babi movement
aimed to reconcile the spiritual and intellectual values of the learned culture
with the realities of the material world in the light of a 'new revelation'.
Therefore it is only appropriate to study this aspiration in its entirety without
evaluating it with the logical and rational criteria of a modern mind.

CHAPTER ONE

The   uiama in the Late 18th and Early 19th Centuries

'Orthodoxy' and 'Heterodoxy'

More than eighty years of intellectual and social development in the post-
Safavid era prepared the way for one of the major events of modern Iranian

history, the rise of the ''ulama in the early decades of the 19th century.
Simultaneous with the rise of the Qajars to a central political power, and almost
parallel to their establishment, a new breed of the ^ulama emerged in the form of
an 'orthodoxy' with a consistent doctrine and specific social and political
characteristics. These two processes, the development of the religious authority
and secular power, were in many ways complementary to each other.      The Qajars
consolidated their position in the urban centres by means of a military and
administrative presence, while the 'ulama strengthened their stand by exerting a
religious authority which they considered to be their prime function. It has
been said, no doubt with some justification, that the emergence of the 'ulama as
an influential urban force first occurred in the last decades of the 18th century
to compensate for the prolonged absence of a dominant political power. But it
was in the early decades of the 19th century that, benefiting from the relative
security of the cities provided by the Qajars, they flourished to become the most
important independent force in the urban centres.      Their relation with the Qajars
may be defined as one of guarded co-existence if not implicit cooperation.
Setting aside their objection in principle to the legitimacy of any secular power,
something which even in theory was seldom defined in clear terms, and in spite
of the efforts which have recently been made to render a militant picture of the

'ulama as the champions of the urban 'masses' in the fight against government opp­
ression, in practice " at least in the earlier decades of the 19th century - they
frequently found themselves obliged to compromise with the secular authority,
particularly at times when their own existence was endangered by other threats.

In their own sphere of influence in the cities, the 'ulama enjoyed a
relative independence in their control over the non-governmental judiciary as
well as the educational institutions.      By supervising most of the public endow­
ments and by receiving alms and other religious dues, they maintained a consider­
able financial leverage outside the traditional zone of government intervention.
Through the mosques, where they preached sermons and conducted public prayers,
they were able to establish direct contact with people.      They often enjoyed the

support of the public who looked upon them for protection, and in particular,
the backing of those groups who shared with them some common interests. This
area of influence was usually recognised by the government and if there were
frictions and disagreements between the 'ulama and the state they were either on
issues which were not fully defined, or more often, because of each side's
intention to expand its area of control beyond the recognised boundaries. Though
both sides were willing to undermine the authority of the other, they were
unwilling, and indeed unable, to risk any serious confrontation. As far as the
'ulama and the government were concerned, in this delicate equilibrium there was
no room for any other force, neither theoretically nor politically, that could
question their legitimacy. In moments of need, the survival of this balance was
the most important element which brought the two sides into a united front.

The social and political role of the ''ulama and its practical implications
are directly related to the doctrine of Usulism, which in its essence, facilitates

the intervention of the religious authority in the affairs of the world. The
llama's drive for political power can be best explained if this theoretical
framework is examined in some of its relevant details. The development of Usuli

thinking was the outcome of a long process which occurred mostly outside the
milieu of the Iranian cities and against the background of other religious trends
common in the ^Atabat in the late 18th century. The rise of the Akhbari school,
both in its modified form in the late 18th century, and shortly afterwards in the
form of a 'heterodoxy 1 , the ascetic and even mystical tendencies of some of the

'ulama and finally the emergence of the Shaykhi school are three of the more
significant currents which existed parallel to the development of the Usuli school,

In this chapter, some general observations will be made on the circumstances which
led to the development of the Usuli 'orthodoxy' in relation to the above mentioned

'non-orthodox' trends, with the aim of discerning an intellectual precedent within
the sphere of learned Shi^ism for those ideas which later gave rise to messianic
thinking.

The flight of the Iranian ^ulama to Iraq throughout the second half of the
18th century brought about some distinctive changes in the religious climate of
the 'Atabat. This is often defined in terms of a doctrinal division between
Akhbaris and Usulis. The Usuli school was first formed by those Iranian 'ulama

(or 'ulama of Iranian descent) who had received their formal training in the
'Atabat and hence were barely influenced by Majlisi's 'traditionalist' school.
Aqa Muhammad Baqir Bihbahani (1118-1205/1706-90), the recognised 'founder'

(mu'assis} of the modern Usuli school is often regarded as the first to realise

the need for a new approach to f-iqk.   He was a young Isfahani talab-ih in his

twenties when he arrived in the ^Atabat.    Though he received his early training
from his father in Isfahan, it was in the     Atabat that he seriously undertook
theological studies under well known scholars such as Shaykh Yusuf Bahrani, Aqa

_ -                           -i
Sayyid Muhammad Tabataba'i and Sayyid Sadr al-Din Qumi . By general definition

•      •   •                  •

these scholars may all be considered as Akhbaris since their main emphasis was
on the theory that beside Kitab, the traditions (Akhbar) , as they were transmitted
from the past generations, were the premises for every theological investigation,
yet they were not totally unaware of the need for some reconsideration of the
methods and means of such an investigation.     Shaykh Yusuf Bahrani, for instance,

who by origin and by training came from a 'traditionalist' school in Bahrain, is
held to be the representative of the Akhbari school in the ''Atabat, yet it was

_                    2

from his moderate views that the first signs of an Usuli tendency emerged . A
kind of" 'rationalist' tendency appears not only in his 'pragmatic' treatment of
fiqh, or in his writings in the field of rijal, but in his criticism of Ibn Abi
al-Hadid, and the denunciation of Mulla Muhsin Fayz and Mulla Muhammad Amin

' - - -                                - - 3

Astarabadi, the renowned advocates of Akhbarism . This approach then seems to
have been taken by Bihbahani and others, and developed further into a definite
theological school with strong emphasis on a rational methodology.

Already, prior to his final settlement in the ''Atabat (1159/1746-7), the
decline of the Akhbaris and their inflexibility in the face of a new social
climate was witnessed by Aqa Muhammad Baqir Bihbahani.     In his encounters with

the Bahraini, or Bahraini-descended ''ulama in Bihbahan, where he spent twenty

five years of his life, the sectarianism between the two major quarters in the
city may have given some reason to Bihbahani to abandon Akhbari fundamentalism,
and seek a convenient way to justify and to assert the independent position of
the fulama .   To some extent the social and political conditions of the time had
a bearing on the adoption of this new approach.   After the fall of the Safavids,

the vacuum in the religious leadership attracted many Akhbari ''ulama of Bahrain
and the coasts of the Persian Gulf, who themselves were escaping from greater
dangers and insecurities in their homelands, to Iranian cities.   In Bihbahan for
example, where in the second and third quarters of the 18th century many ''ulama
had taken refuge from Afghan incursions, rivalries and frictions between the two
groups of Persian and Arab ''ulama materialised in the form of a theoretical
conflict.   Some practical implications of this conflict may be observed in the
divisions between the city quarters where each of the two main sections of the
city of Bihbahan paid its allegiance to two main groups of Persian and Arab
'ulama.

But nevertheless, it was in the 'Atabat that in the later decades of the
18th century a serious intellectual encounter took place between the represent-

2                       - -
atives of the two tenets . Here, while the Akhbaris were failing to sort out the
difficulties and deficiencies of the Akhbari theory, and hence were losing their
stand or simply fading away, Bihbahani and his disciples, many of them Akhbari
converts, managed to develop Usuli thought into a major theory for the newly

emerged class of 'ulama.   For Bihbahani and his disciples, contrary to Akhbaris,
the first priority was to employ a deductive reasoning in order to draw conclusions
applicable to the new circumstances, from premises inherited from the past.     The
major political changes at the time and the crisis of legitimacy and leadership
demanded such a logical approach in order to give the ''ulama the necessary means

to play their part in the affairs of the temporal world . Contrary to what is

usually assumed, the decline of the Akhbaris in the last quarter of the 18th
century was the natural outcome of a long process from 'transmission' (naql) to
a method of logical reasoning rather than the instant victory of Bihbahani over
his rivals .

Bihbahani T s efforts nevertheless resulted in consolidation of the position
of ijtihad both in theory and in practice. The precept of 'acting in accordance
with presumption' ( ^canal-i bi zanri)
*
, the maxim of the Usuli

doctrine which was
in contrast to the Akhbari precepts of yaq^n (certitude) and ^ilm (knowledge) ,
enabled mujtahids to go far beyond the former practice both in gaining particular
judgement and in formulating general principles. But Usulism also made it clear

that ijtihad, or more specifically the rational process of arriving at conclusions
was restricted to mujtahids who, because of their specific training, acquired a
prominent intellectual status which enabled them to deduce facts and draw
conclusions from the Qu^an or hadZth (which by itself was the subject of great

—                               2

scrutiny), or through 'consensus' (ij'moO and mere 'reasoning' (.^aqV) • Hence,
by defining terms and conditions of ijtihadt and by recognising the intellectual
and moral advantages of mujtahids, the Usulis designated themselves as a

religious elite entitled to rights and priorities above the others, and most of
all to leadership of the community. This elitist attitude, almost unprecedented
in the past history of Shi 'ism, was an important element in the religious
history of the 19th century. The theoretical ground for this approach is very
much evident in the writings of the followers and students of Bihbahani. Its
practical implications however are more discernible in the activities of the
second generation of the Usulis.

The theoretical progress of the school owed much to those ^ulama who
gathered in Bihbahani 's circle. Either by producing highly specialised works on
fiqh, usul al-fiqh, and to a lesser extent hadith, or by training a new

generation of students, the Usuli nucleus constructed the backbone of Shi ^i

orthodoxy for the whole of the 19th century. While scholars such as Shaykh Ja ff ar

The second generation of students on the other hand were trained under Usuli

teachers in the ''Atabat and were responsible for broadening the mujtahid's sphere
of influence beyond academic circles and into the community. They consisted of
three major groups.   The first was that of sons and grandsons of some eminent
mujtahids of the ''Atabat who following their fathers' career and often in close
family contact with each other, managed to maintain some form of monopoly, or
at least control, over teaching circles in the 'Atabat. By despatching their
students to various centres in Iran, and by extensive travelling to Iran, during
which they maintained a dialogue with the Qajar monarchs, the ruling princes
and the urban notables, these ulama of high descent continued their fathers'
efforts to strengthen the Usuli positions. Of these, the Tabatab'a'Ts (Sayyid

The second group were the Persian ^ulama who often came from humble origins
in the towns and villages of central and northern Iran. They began to arrive in
the ^Atabat in the late 18th century, usually after completing their preliminary
studies in religious centres such as Isfahan, Qazvin, Qum and Mashhad. Their
long residence in the ^Atabat to study under eminent teachers and acquiring
authorisation to exercise ijt-ihad (ijazM, usually acquainted them with certain
norms and values, and gave them specific qualities, which were characteristic of
all the Usuli ^ulama in the 19th century. A majority of them on their return to
Iran made their home towns, or main provincial centres, their permanent residence,
while only a few remained in the ^Atabat and achieved high positions. In due
course, these ^ulama, both in Iraq and in Iran, trained a larger number of
Persian students and established a vast network of Usali ^ulama throughout the

country. Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shafti, Haji Ibrahim Karbasi, Muhammad Taqi and

offices such as imam jitm^ih and Shaykh al-Islam.   They retained their traditional
positions, some dating from as early as the time of the Safavids,

in the more
important urban centres of Iran. Throughout the 19th century these families of
official divines, sometimes in cooperation but often in competition with the
other independent mujtahids, retained their position as the executors of Shar
and the official representatives of the 'ulama class. No doubt the support given
by the government assisted them in maintaining their authority, but cases of
conflicts with the state policies were not rare. Amongst the ^ulama of this

clergy (known as mullas and akhunds in a general sense) included clergy in the
smaller cities, towns and large villages, the aides and entourage of prominent
mujtahids, mudarrisin (teachers of the intermediary level) in the local theo­
logical schools, or secretaries of the religious courts, while the low rank
clergy including rauz-ihkhans, mas'alih-gus and other nrCnbari mullas, high and
low level tullab, teachers of the elementary level (mu^allims) , khuddam and low
level mutavall-is of shrines, mosques, and madrasihs, semi-professional and
rural mullas and sayyids with no fixed occupations, all provided an important
support for the mujtahids. Being financially and hierarchically dependent on
their superiors, they often functioned as means of influence and if necessary
instruments of propaganda and incitement in the community. But the lower ranks
did not always follow the general guide lines of the mujtahids.   Many sparks
of protest, dissidence and revolt first flared amongst these very groups, who
according to their training, their background, or their attachment to various
individuals or doctrines, occasionally reacted against the domination of the
high-ranking ''ulama. It took a long time however before these primitive signs
of discontent could be fully expressed in any significant movement of protest.
The loosely formed hierarchy of the Shi^i ^ulama, though allowed the occasional
upsurges of discontent, also prevented a concerted reaction.   Hence, up to the
first quarter of the 19th century, the voice of the higher 'ulama expressed
that of the greater part of the religious community.
Thanks to the Usuli doctrine of active execution of the religious law, the
'ulama enjoyed a legal status not only different from the members of the secular
judicial system, but in many ways superior to it. They also enjoyed an economic
and financial position largely independent from the secular power.   These
advantages not only gave them the necessary resources to support their students,
aides and subordinates, but also put them in constant touch with other urban
groups, most noticeably merchants and landlords.   Later some of the ''ulama them­
selves entered the economic market and became rivals to both merchants and land­
owners. Various factors such as the absence of a centralised judicial power,
the chronic weaknesses of the state in controlling its holdings, and the common
misappropriation of the endowment revenues, encouraged the 'ulama to venture
into the fields of trade, agriculture, money lending and property, often
commissioning the same merchants and small landowners as their agents . This
gave them a stand far above simple theologians and jurists.    Many mujtahids such

1\.   See below Chapter Seven, I,      the case of the Nahri brothers in Isfahan
and their cooperation with both Shaft! and Sayyid Muhammad Imam Jum^ih.

as Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shafti, the Baraghanis of Qazvin, the Shaykh al-Islams

of Tabriz and the Imam Jum^ihs of Isfahan owed their power and influence, more
than anything else, to the very economic power which no doubt facilitated their
involvement in the political and religious spheres.

The integration of this clerical body into a coherent entity, in such a
manner that it could guarantee the high position of the mujtahids, necessitated
the adoption of more systematic lines of authority.                Above all, the recognition
of a 'head 1 or a leader fulfilled the need for a superior theological authority
who, by embodying both rational capacity and moral piety, could sanctify the
high authority of other members of the hierarchy.                Already in late 18th century,
perhaps with some attention to the great scholars of the past and in comparison
with the Sunni religious hierarchy, Aqa Muhammad Baqir Bihbahani was acknowledged

as the 'Master' (Ustad-i kull) , the 'Founder' (Mu 3 assis) and the 'Promoter'
(Muravwij") of the modern Usuli school .         This seems to have been the motive of

some Usuli writers, most of them Bihbahani's own students, in regarding him as
'the Renewer of the beginning of the century' (Mujaddid-i ra*s-i ma*a) , a

_                       2
concept more familiar in Sunni than in Shi ^i thought .

After Bihbahani however, this implicit problem of recognition of a 'head'

seems to have remained unresolved for the next few decades.                Though some regarded
Sayyid Mahdi Bahr

al-^Ulum, Bihbahani's most prominent student and one of the
outstanding 'ulama of the late 18th century (1155-1212/1742-97), as the most

<3

eminent of the 'ulama of the 'Atabat , yet from his early death up to the middle
of the 1820's for almost two decades, no Shi^i divine emerged as the prominent
leader of the community. This was probably due to the fact that few of
BihbahanT's students such as Sayyid ^Ali Tabataba'i, Shaykh Ja^far Najafi and

Mirza-yi Qumi enjoyed an equal degree of academic respect and popular support.
Later however, when almost all the students of the first generation had died,
a few mujtahids of the second generation emerged as leaders.                Between the 1820's
and 1840's, Sayyid Muhammad Tabataba'i, Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shafti (Hujjat al-

Muhammad Hasan Najafi were considered as the chief religious authorities .           In

the second half of the 19th century, however, Shaykh Murtaza Ansari and after

him Mirza Hasan Shirazi emerged as the sole Marja^-i Taqlid, and their authority

was acknowledged by the ^ulama of both Arab and Persian origins.

Besides its legal and judicial implications, the emergence of Marja^
reflected a profound need in the religious community for a spiritual and moral
head.      Though the Usuli doctrine equipped the high-ranking fulama with the

weapon of ijtihad, yet in its essence the rationalism propounded in the Usuli
theory largely contradicted the spiritual standing attributed to the maYJa^s in
order to enhance their prestige in the eyes of their followers. To conceal this
paradox, attributions of unworldly qualities such as piety, lack of temporal
desire, devotion and asceticism may frequently be found in reference to prominent
mujtahids.           Hence, many of the characteristics and modes of behaviour of
mujtahids may be interpreted in the light of their attempt either to reconcile
these conflicting aspects or to compensate for lack of worldly detachment. When
for instance Aqa Muhammad Baqir Bihbahani announced in the Shrine of Husain in

Karbila* that he was 'the Proof of God' (Bujjat-i Khuda) , he did not mean to

_2

proclaim any messianic message heralding the future coming of the Mahdi . What
he implied was the superiority of his 'rationalist' approach over the
'traditionalist' creed. This is further evident when he continues by denouncing
Shaykh Yusuf Bahrani and demanding a place in his pulpit and requiring Bahrani's

students to attend his lectures . Indeed his logical approach would not have
allowed him to expect an obscure and cumbersome 'Saviour' who was supposed to
appear under the most unimaginable circumstances.           Instead, his Usulism would

allow the spiritual guidance of the Imam to be manifested in general 'deputyship'
(niyabat) of the mujtahids. In one of his sermons, Bihbahani even implied the
futility of awaiting the 'Departure' of the Imam, arguing that present
circumstances would not tolerate the austerity and burden of his 'advent'.           This

But if there was a strong emphasis on arriving at conclusions by way of
deductive reasoning, this very concept of niyabat-i ^amm (general deputyship),
as it was assigned to the mujtahids, was not free from elements of non-rationality
from which Usulism,
at least in practice, could not escape. Judgements (dhkam)

were not only achieved by mere rational 'effort' (jahd) , for which the fuqaha 3
were called mujtahids, but also by an 'intuitive' and 'illuminative' perception
from the word of the 'infallible* (kashf-i qaul—i mansion).  This latter concept

was an Akhbari legacy which had some precedent in the Shi^i scholars of the past,
ranging from Shaykh Baha' al-Din ^Amili and Mulla Muhsin  Fiyz Kashani to Mulla

Muhammad Taqi and Mulla Muhammad Baqir Majlisi. Later on, from the last quarter

of the 18th century onwards, in spite of a general orientation of the ''ulama
towards the Usuli kind of rationalism and their efforts to consolidate the
foundations of fiqh, distinctive examples of asceticism and mystical experience
are still discernible in certain individuals. This tendency developed, often in
peace with Shi^i orthodoxy, amongst some ^ulama, chiefly to compensate for the
widening gap which had been produced by the growth of Usuli rationalism. These

'intuitive' experiences, though at first glance they seem to fall strictly
within the lawful framework of Shar^ , upon closer examination reveal traces of
millenarian expectations which contradicted the very basis of orthodoxy.

response towards Sufism.      Tara* -iq al-Haqa* -iq reports that during Nur ^Ali's stay

in the 'Atabat, his popular preachings moved his enemies to seek the opinion of
Bahr al-'uium, who in response interviewed Nur ^Ali and as a result became

profoundly impressed by his character . However, his sympathetic attitude
towards the Ni^matallahis should not be exaggerated since in a brief fatva which
he issued in reply to Aqa Muhammad 'Ali Bihbahani on the question of the

Ni 'matallahis ' activities, he emphasised, in a thinly veiled reference, that
'Beyond any doubt, the deviation of this condemned group from the path of right-
fulness and true guidance, and their efforts to provoke discontent and to

corrupt people of the cities, have become obvious and apparent' . The problem
of Bahr al-^Ulum's Sufi affiliation became even more enigmatic when towards the

end of the century a sub-branch of Ni' matallahis claimed a chain of spiritual

o
descendancy through Bahr al-'Ulum from Nur 'Ali Shah .
However, if his sympathetic attitude towards Sufis may be in doubt, there
is evidence which supports his preoccupation with mystical experiences.         Qisas

al-^Ulama't refers to 'frequent retirements' (£ ^tikaf) and 'acts of devotion' in
the mosques of Sahlah and Kufah 4 . On a few occasions the author referred to
'concealed secrets' (khafaya-yi, asTar) and mystical 'encounters' in the course
of which he visited the Concealed Imam both in dreams and in the state of wake-
fulness.  During one encounter with Sahib al-Amr, in reply to his enquiry on

certain points of fiqh t he was even instructed by the Imam 'to follow the path
of "apparent reasons" (adallah-yi zah-iviyah) in the affairs of Shar^ 1 . These

•                     ^^
alleged visits, and other 'supernatural feats' (karamat') , gave Bahr al-^Ulum a
status above other jurists and made some sources even suggest some similarities
between him and the Imam of the Age . One chronogram composed on his demise reads
'Mahdi of the Lord of the Age       has passed away 1 (Mahdi-yi sahib zaman zi

Many students, including some of the most prominent mujtahids of the next
generation, recognised Bahr al- 'Ulum as the sole successor of Bihbahani and

thus considered it as an honour to have been among his students . However, few
of them seem to bear the stamp of his intuitive approach.             'Abd al-Samad

Hamadani was later converted to the Ni^matallahi order             whereas Mirza Muhammad

Akhbari and Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i, while remaining in the ranks of the ''ulama,

maintained diverse mystical and 'non-orthodox* interests different from those of
Suf ism.

In his unorthodox approach to the question of the cognition of the Imam,
Mirza Muhammad Akhbari (1178-1232/1764-1816), a theologian of great calibre and
chief advocate of later Akhbarism, went far beyond the mild asceticism of his

teacher Bahr al-^Ulum  . A strong reaction against the prevalence of Usulism,
and efforts to reintroduce a 'militant 1 version of Akhbari thought which was
considerably different to the moderate views of his intellectual predecessor
Shaykh Yusuf Bahrani, turned Mirza Muhammad into a dangerous enemy for the high-

ranking ''ulama. His challenge to them, perhaps, was the most important after
the setback of the Ni^matallahis about a decade earlier at the turn of the 19th
century .          In his writings, as in his frequent public debates with the prominent
mujtahids of his time, he sharply criticised the position of the Usulis on
-                                                             ' 5

, and their methodology and excessive use of logical arguments . But
perhaps what offended the ''ulama most were his direct attacks on three arch
defenders of Usulism.         He criticised Mirza Abul Qasim Qumi and his disciples,

whom he nicknamed Baqasima. , for their domination of religious circles while Sayyid
'Ali Tabataba'i and his adherents, whom he called Azaviqa ,            were attacked for

their innovations in the field of fiqh and their deviations from the lawful
framework of traditions.          In his debates with Shaykh Ja ^f ar Najafi, his skill

in jadal (logical disputation) many times silenced the old mujtahid .
In many ways Mirza Muhammad Akhbari should not be regarded as an Akhbari in
the traditional definition only because he rejected any dispute in the
authenticity of the traditions by means of deductive reasoning. Of course
Akhbarism provided some room for intuitive approach but his ideas and behaviour
suggested a more 'heterodox' approach than that of theoretical 'intuition'
(Kashf) of the Akhbaris of the past generation. Preoccupation with 'hidden
sciences' ( fulum—i, khafiyyah) gave Mirza Muhammad the reputation of an eccentric
scholar with supernatural powers. His bargain with Fath ^Ali Shah to bring the
head of the Russian commander Tsitsianov by magical practices in exchange for
eradication of the mujtahids' influence is reminiscent of earlier Sufi attempts
to attract the secular power in the hope of defeating the fulama 2 . He also
produced a number of works on the subject of the occult, of which Anmuzaj al-

— —              3
Murtadin is an example . However, his works are not limited to refutations and
'occult sciences'. He was a prolific writer who, like his teacher Bahr al-
and his contemporary Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i, was known for his 'universality'

His views on the question of the Concealed Imam, discussed in Fath al-Bab
and Haqiqat al-Shuhud, imply that contrary to the 'general deputyship' of the
Usulis, he considered the 'Gate of Knowledge' (Bab-i ^Ilm) open only to those
who can grasp the presence of the Imam by their intuitive experience 5 . This
approach contained elements of messianism which could even be taken as a
precursor of later trends. Numerological prognostications often quoted from
him lay stress on expectations no^ dissimilar from those of the contemporary
Sufis or scholars such as Ahsa'i and Sayyid Ja ''f ar Kashf i . In his poetry, with

reference to a certain tradition ascribed to 0\li, he states: 'In the year

witness how the nations, the rulers, the people, and the Faith of the God shall

familiar with Mirza Muhammad's speculations, since he wrote a commentary on

al-Burhan in which he criticised some of the author's views . In Dala'tl-i
Sab^ah, the Bab refers to Mirza Muhammad as one of those who forecast his

imminent 'manifestation' .       He quotes a certain Sayyid ^Abd al-Husain Shushtari

who had once met Mirza Muhammad in a gathering in Kazimayn.        When the latter was

asked about the ZuhuT of the Imam, he looked at the audience and pointed at (Abd

- 3
al-Husain,
•       assuring him that 'you will witness the time of the Zuhur 1 • But
more than his speculations, it was his unreserved opposition to the mujtahids
that put him in constant danger, and finally cost him his life.          Charging him
with heresy, blasphemy and 'constant abuse of the fulama', Shaykh Musa Najafi
(son of Ja^far), in full accord with the other prominent fulama of the ^Atabat,
issued a fatva declaring that 'his execution is a religious obligation, and
whoever participates in the shedding of his blood, his entrance to Heaven will
be guaranteed'.  The fatva was signed by all the others and Mirza Muhammad was

killed by the mob in Kazimayn . Shirvani states that he had even forecast his
own death in a chronogram: ' sadduq ghuliba' = 1232 Q. (the truthful was overcome) 5

However, if the anti-Usuli stand adopted by Mirza Muhammad was largely an
unsuccessful attempt to check the power of the mujtahids, his intuitive approach
on the other hand, was not uncommon amongst some other distinguished divines.
Already, a few decades earlier, Aqa Muhammad Bidabadi (died 1197/1782-3), who
was one of the last survivors of the old Isfahan school, had shown interest in
mystical experiences.    Though he had a distinguished orthodox training, it was
his piety, lack of worldly ambitions, interest in alchemy and other 'hidden
sciences', mainly derived from his family's mystical background, which made him

mysticism is apparent from his mystical aphorisms and sermons .
Another scholar, Sayyid Jarfar Darabi (1189-1267/1775-1850) also claimed a

similar intuitive knowledge, for which he is known as Kashf-i . He was related
to a celebrated family of Bahraini

Al-^Usfur, a great Akhbari scholar who himself was the nephew of Shaykh Yusuf

Bahrani . Shaykh Husain was a key figure in the diffusion of the Bahraini     school
of thought both in the ^Atabat and in Southern Iran, and it is not unlikely that
his views influenced Darabi. When Kashfi for example emphasises that, as a
result of a revealing dream he has realised that the Friday communal prayer
during the Greater Concealment is unlawful, he echoes an Akhbari view . The
symbolic significance of this statement lies in the fact that it allows the
exercise of religious authority only after the emergence of the Imam. Kashfi
particularly pointed out that whoever conducts'this prayer 'is ambitious for
riyasa and is a usurper of the right position of the venerable Imam' .

The same attitude is also shared by Mulla Asadallah Burujirdi Hujjat al-

He claimed that these merits came to him as a result of a tauqi ^ (tablet) which
was addressed to him from the Concealed Imam .      But nevertheless, in spite of
occasional manifestations of an intuitive method, the remnants of Akhbarism or
offshoots of this school, largely lacked the necessary impulse to leave a
permanent mark.   The general current of Usuli orthodoxy, then in its full flow,

was powerful enough not to be affected by any outburst of protest.       Yet some
elements of this survived, either by direct transmission or in the form of
diffused ideas and influences, to be exploited in later movements.

II

With Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i (1166-1241/1752-1825) and his visionary theophany,

Shi ^i thought generated a new synthesis which was essential for a new phase of
millenarianism, a phase which eventually ended in the formation of the Babi
movement.    The Babi movement derived both its theoretical formation and its
converts more from Shaykhism than from any other school. But such a close
relationship can be best appreciated when Shaykhism in itself is considered as
the final outcome of a fusion between three major trends of thought in post-
Safavid Shi ^ism; the theosophic school of Isfahan (hikmat-i ilahi) , which itself

benefited from the theoretical Sufism of Ibn ^Arabi and the 'Oriental' theosophy
(hikmat-i Iskraq) of Suhravardi, the Akhbari 'traditionalist' school of Bahrain
which traced its chain of transmission to the early narrators of hadith mostly

by the way of 'intuitive' perception and the Gnosticism which was diffused in
the Shi ' i milieu and was strongly influenced by crypto-Isma^ili ideas as well as
other heterodoxies of southern.and southwestern Iran. However, this syncretism,
the zenith of the late 18th century Shi''i 'universality' (jam^iyat) does not
detract from the originality of Shaykh Ahmad's thought,      since he attempted to

incorporate both zahir (exoteric) and batin (esoteric) aspects in one

comprehensive system.  This required as much philosophical scepticism as
intuitive experience and knowledge of kalam and traditions, in order to achieve
an overall insight which Corbin defines as 'integrisme' (in the original sense

of the word) , and Shaykh Ahmad himself refers to it as 'Perfect Shi''ism 1 (Shi^a

al-Kamil).    Though in the past such a theme was long pursued in Islamic
intellectual history; from the Isma^ili ta'vT.1 of Nasir Khusrau and others, to

decessors.

A comprehensive survey of Shaykhism, from the theoretical and historical
point of view, is beyond the capacity of this study. Though some aspects of
Ahsa'i

1 s have been investigated, many areas remain to be fully covered . Here
however, the main emphasis is on those eschatological aspects which gave rise
to messianic expectations and hence were regarded by the opponents of the
school as contrary to the course of orthodoxy. Ahsa'i's    challenge in two major

areas, namely the problem of spiritual authority, and the esoteric interpretation
of Resurrection (AfcrQf), posed a threat to the doctrine of the majority. As
was previously the case with the early Nifmatallahis and then with Mirza
Muhammad Akhbari, attempts were made to confront this threat by the isolation

of Shaykhism almost to the point of total denunciation. Nevertheless this was
a formidable challenge, since Shaykhism was equally at home with Shi^i traditions
and with philosophical argumentations. Ahsa'i puts forward a concept of

transmission which relied on the Akhbari school without being totally committed
to its fundamentalism. He asserted his propositions on the basis of his
intuitions whereas the fuqaha* endeavoured to base their conclusions on usul
al-fiqh.

have been exposed to some local trends in the area .          Though Corbin tends to
believe that he was an uvaysi, and had no formal training except a ' supra-

-
sensible (invisible) guide' (Shaykh al-ghayba t ustad-i       - 2

reasons to believe that by way of self education he benefited from available
sources in his vicinity. If the words of Qisas al- Ulama* can be relied upon,

Shaykh Ahmad seems to have had access to the remnants of Ibn Abi Jumhur Ahsa'i's

many points in common with Abi Jumhur . Indeed considering the care and attention
paid by the local scholars in preserving their precious collections 4 , it is not
impossible that some of the texts had survived for a few centuries up to Shaykh
Ahmad's time. The fact that Shaykh Ahmad's views on many subjects resemble

the origins of his thoughts.
Furthermore, the continuous contacts of the Bahraini 'ulama with centres of

theological trends or even the circulation of religious and philosophical texts
in a remote area like al-Ahsa' possible . Yet in spite of these early influences,

Shaykh Abmad's son, in a biographical account of his father, states that in al-
Ahsa' besides the majority of the Sunni population who had Sufi tendencies, the

remaining Ithna ^Ashari ^ulama were dominated by dogmatic literalists ( 'ulama-yi
zah-iri-yi, qishri) , 'who had nothing to do with theosophy (hikmat) , let alone with
the secrets of creation'. He maintains that this attitude obliged Shaykh Ahmad •

to emigrate to the ^Atabat 'in the hope of finding someone who could sympathise

with his views' . But in the 'Atabat his attendance at the lectures of Usulis

such as Bihbahanl, Sayyid ''All Tabataba'i and possibly Shaykh Ja^far Najafi,

did not convert him to either of these two schools, and to a large extent he

remained loyal to an ascetic approach pioneered by Bahr al-'Ulum . This approach

especially appealed to Ahsa'i who had earlier experienced revelatory dreams and

and visions in which he claimed to have contacted the holy Imams and even
received instructions from them . These visions indicated his enthusiasm for
the world hereafter.  The symbolic interpretation of these dreams provided a
ground for Shaykh Ahmad to posit the existence of an intermediary world beyond

the terrestrial life, thus opening new horizons for future intuitive meditations
to be based on visionary experiences .

Besides preoccupations with asceticism and holy dreams, another familiar
aspect in Shaykh Ahmad's thought was his keen interest in 'hidden sciences' in

general and alchemy in particular.     Although in this context there is some
resemblance between Ahsa'i and a few of his contemporaries such as Mirza

Muhammad Akhbari and Sayyid Ja*far Kashfi, yet his use of these symbolic

expressions was more for the purpose of exploring a kind of philosophical
methodology.  In the course of his discussions on the transcendental evolution
of the body and soul, he frequently makes analogies with the alchemical

process .  Here, an esoteric interpretation of the unravelled secrets of alchemy
served as an instrument or a method for attaining an intuitive perception of
the complex states of man's existence. By elaborating an eschatological system
in which the nature of the individual and collective resurrection have been
discussed at great length, Ahsa'i goes beyond the limits of his contemporaries.

In a cyclic process, a divine substance accompanies the spirit in its descent
from the realm of the eternal truth (malakut) to terrestrial earth and after
passing through earthly life, eventually ascends to its origin. But in this
journey, man's being passes through an intermediary realm which neither belongs
to the elemental existence, nor to the realm of malakut.

This is the celestial world of Hurqalya which is a purifying stage through
which all beings must pass before being finally judged on the Day of Resurrection.
This visionary world of Hurqalya, this archetypal barzakh (purgatory) or the world
of forms and images, is the 'earth' of the soul, because it is the soul's vision -
'a world whose state is neither the absolutely subtle state of separate

substances, nor the opaque density of the material things of our world' .
According to this theory man's being is comprised of a fourfold body. It

consists of a twofold 'accidental' body and a twofold 'essential' body . The
elemental corpse (jasad al-^unsu^C) which is a compound of 'sublunar' (physical)
elements, perishes after death, decomposes to its original elements and will
never return, whereas the 'subtle spiritual corpse' (jasad al-batini) , the

celestial or astral body (ji.sm al-bati.ri'C) and the essential body (j-tsm al-asli.

al-haq-iqi) ascends to the world of Hurqalya. In this celestial conservatory,
the threefold body remains till the Day when man will be resurrected to reclaim
a new elemental existence and to meet the Final Judgement. Then he will again
be stripped of all bodily existence (except the essential body) in order to be

Now the question may be asked about the significance of the multifold
existence in this imaginary world of Hurqalya since the same theme was previously
pondered upon by earlier thinkers.    A comparison may be found with Platonic
archetypal images as they are interpreted amongst neoplatonists such as Proclus
and Dionysius 3 . The Neoplatonic influence may also be observed through the
'Oriental' theosophy of Shaykh Ishraq who uses the term Hurqalya to describe the
location of his intuitive experience, but he considers the celestial earth of

-     -                      - 4
Hurqalya as the earth of Malakut • Shaykh Ahmad himself acknowledged that he

-     - from the Sabeans
adopted the Syriac term Hurqalya                  (Mandeans) of Basra 5 . In fact
as Corbin points out, Shaykh Ahmad's concept of Hurqalya corresponds in its

essence   to the world of Doubles or celestial Images, Mshunia Kushta in Mandean
cosmology .   More significantly the traces of Shi (i thinkers and theosophists
may also be observed in Ahsa'i with greater clarity.   The presence of mystical

revelation (Kashf) and illumination (ishraq) , or the intermediary world of

immortal images (. f alam-i m-itlial) together with a mystical interpretation of
Shi^i theology and traditions, confirms a possible influence by Ibn Abi Jumhur
Ahsa'i on the ideas of Shaykh Ahmad. Abi Jumhur maintains that 'the Imam's soul

does not disintegrate at the time of death'. As for other people, in accordance
with the form the soul has acquired through its good and evil actions, it will
either enter the "World of Images" in an incorporal shape and enjoy its pleasures,
or it will be returned to the earth in the bodies of lowly animals in order to
suffer punishment* . The concept of reincarnation, as it appears in Abi Jumhur
is foreign to Shaykh Ahmad but on the point of the 'minor resurrection' (at-
qiyamat al-sugkra 3 } or the individual resurrection of man in the intermediary
world, some resemblance may be discerned . Later, in more modern times, Fayz
Kashani describes his world of Barzakh as 'a world through which bodies are

spiritualised, and spirits embodied' .
But in spite of earlier interpretations, Shaykh Ahmad's

definition of the
celestial world pointed in a specific messianic direction. By introducing this
intermediary stage, he tried to resolve some of the major obstacles in the way
of Shi^i eschatological thinking, hence laying the theoretical foundation of a
new trend of millenarianism. First by esoteric interpretation of the Quranic
verses or the Shi^i traditions, Shaykh Ahmad

redefined the concept of
Resurrection contrary to the veiw held by the orthodox 'literalists'. The
survival of the 'spiritual being 1 (jasad al-batini, plus ji.sm al-haq-iq-i) in the
world of Hurqalya, removes the problem of corporal resurrection from the earthly
grave, the concept known as mu^ad jismani,. The corporal elemental cast
perishes and will never return. The spiritual corpse however, which is main­

tained in the celestial grave as a shapeless, luminous and refined substance
composed of elements of the world of Hurqalya, will be resurrected and recast in
a new but still identical elemental corpse.
In his commentary on H-ikmat al-^Arshlya of Sadr al-Din Shirazi, Shaykh

Ahmad describes  the final Resurrection  in the  following  words:

> 'When the divine Will intends to renew Creation and to cause
> the seeds from the preceding existence to germinate, Seraph
> is commanded to blow into the Trumpet the breath of the
> great Awakening. As opposed to the "blazing sound", this
> is a propulsive breath. Entering the sixth dwelling, it
> propels the intellect towards the pnewna in the fifth
> dwelling; next it propels intellect and pneuma together

1\.   Madelung, 'Ibn Abi Gumhur', op.cit. 149.
2\.   Terre Celeste, 159 (101).

> towards the soul in the fourth dwelling; then it propels
> all three together, intellect, pnewna, and soul, towards
> the subtle conubstantial matter in the second dwelling;
> finally it propels all five toward the Image or archetypal
> Form in the first dwelling. Then the "I" spirit finds
> again its composition and structure, its consciousness
and capacity to feel.

On the other hand, before the vibration of the breath

> is symbolically mentioned. For then the individual arises
> in his imperishable Form, shaking the terrestrial dust
> from his head. "As you were made in the beginning, that
> you will again become" as it is said'-'-.
Secondly, the Earth of the intermediary world provides a location for the
visionary encounter with the Concealed Imam. It is from the West of this world
that the Imam will appear.     'When we speak of Jabalqa and Jdbarsa* writes Shaykh

Ahmad, 'we mean the lower regions of this intermediate world.    Jabalqa is the

city of the East, that is, in the direction of the beginning. Jabarsa is the
city of the West, that is, in the direction of the return and ending' . It is
only in this visionary world of meditation that the existence of the Imam and
his eternal presence in the world of Hurqalya can be experienced. This idea of
a subtle, visionary state rescues the Concealed Imam from the obscure and
inaccessible masses of confused Shi^i traditions. Again, contrary to the
orthodox eschatological literature produced on the subject of concealment, with
the definite purpose of undermining and even denying the possibility of any
tangible existence of the Imam, relegating him to the oblivion of a never coming
future and thus diminishing the chances of any possible 'revelation', here
Shaykh Ahmad paves the way not only for an esoteric encounter with the Imam,

but for his reappearance from the celestial world in the world of elemental
existence.  Ironically, the very school which preached rationalism and a logical
approach discouraged and even condemned the flesh and blood image of the Qa'im,
leaving it to the mystical and pensive Ahsa'i to yearn for a Qa'im who in his

very being promulgated a historical necessity.

Nevertheless, this necessity was never discussed beyond the point of
metaphorical allusions.    What is more clearly emphasised is the possibility of

1\.   Ibid. 327 (217-18).     The verse referred to is from the QuJan, VII, 28.
2\.   Ibid. 295-6 (192).

an encounter with the Imam in the world of visions and dreams.        This is the
third aspect of Shaykh Ahmad's eschatology.       He maintains that so long as the
Imam remains in the Concealment, while the world still undergoes the process of
final separation between good and evil, only the 'presential knowledge' ('llm
huduri') would lead the seeking man to the Hidden Imam.       Hurqalya is not only an
intermediary world which one enters after physical death, but is the very state
of intuitive imagination perceptible by acquirement of a transcendental
consciousness.       If thinking in a 'horizontal dimension' (silsilat al-^ard)
enables man to grasp a static understanding of elemental creation, the
'longitudinal dimension' (silsilat al-tul) transcends him to the state of
Hurqalya where he would attend the presence of the Imam .

By introducing this 'longitudinal dimension 1 in which the the past is 'under
our feet' and not behind us, Ahsa'I proposes a collective historical conscious­
ness shared by all those who are elevated to the state of 'presence' (hudur) and
thus can visualise this all embracing state of consciousness, as symbolised in
the person of the Imam.        This was not an unprecedented concept in Islamic
history.   Both Isma^ilism and Sufism pondered the necessity of this 'invisible'
guide in the course of man's historical perfection.        The 'Perfect Shi'i' (Sh-i'a
al-Kam-il) or Natiq Vahid in Shaykhism implies the same characteristics of Natiq

9    /N   •                                                        •

and Insan-i, KJamil .      After the first three principles of the 'unity of God'
(Tauh-id) , prophethood (Nabuwat) and recognition of the Imamat, the principal
of V-ilayat (which is defined as the perfect Shi ^i) becomes the 'Fourth Pillar 1
(Rukn al-Rabi^ of the Shaykhi doctrine.        Henceforth the Perfect Shi^i is the
same 'Gate' (Bab} or Deputy (Na*i,b) who in the state of revelatory meditation

comes into the presence of the Concealed Imam .
These three aspects of Shaykh Ahmad's thought, the redefinition of the
Resurrection, the location of the Imam in the intermediary world of Hurqalya and
the encounter between the Imam and the Perfect Shi(i in the state of meditation,
more than any other factor consolidated the foundation of millenarian thinking.
This process, in spite of attempts made by the successors: of Shaykh Ahmad to
readjust the Shaykhi doctrine at the orthodox theory of 'Concealment', remained
largely independent of the dominant orthodoxy and was bound to come into
collision with it later. The position of Ahsa'i in relation to the Ithna
^Ashari eschatology deserves further attention.

of the Imam's existence in the material world by emphasising that a prolonged
biological life for the Imam was not impossible .    But since the Imam was in
Concealment, and since after the completion of 'Lesser Concealment' and the time
of the 'Four Agents' (Nuvvab Arba^a ) the chances of any regular contact with
the Imam were remote, it was the responsibility of the mujtahids to guide the
believers during this interregnum.  However, this attitude did not prevent the

accumulation of a large number of intuitive experiences . Part of the literature
of Ghaybat was exclusively devoted to these experiences, mainly to prove three
points: first, to provide some evidence for the abiding presence of the Imam
and to stretch his presence in the material world; secondly, to sanctify the
position of the mujtahids as true representatives of the Imam, and thirdly, to
compensate for the scarcity of supernatural experiences in orthodoxy in a lawful
way.

But these experiences hardly ever went beyond a subsidiary support.      Indeed
the contents of the books of Ghaybat or R-Lj^at in no way encouraged any sincere
expectation for the advent of the Qa'im.    On the contrary, they implied greatest
theoretical obstacles to the materialisation of any of the prophecies which were
the very basis of the Ithna ^Ashari theory of Concealment.    The prohibition on
setting a date for the 'revelation 1 , on identifying any specific name for the
Imam, or the possibility of declaring specific deputyship, naturally made any
attempt to fulfil the prophecies, or even any speculation on the subject, a

matter of controversy if not heresy . A considerable number of treatises,
written to remove doubts about any single point of prohibition, indicate the
potential danger which the unconventional approach might have for 'orthodoxy' 4 .

In this context the position of Ahsa'i and his successor Sayyid Kazim
Rashti is somewhat complicated.    On the one hand it is apparent that in spite
of his philosophical orientation, in instances, at least on the surface, he
agrees with the common orthodox interpretation.     In Sharh al-Ziyara Ahsa'i
devotes a whole section to the question of R-ij^at and the appearance of the
Qa'im, entirely on the basis of traditions cited in the works of the previous

scholars.  Though remarkable in providing a systematic and consistent account of
the existing traditions, and equally remarkable for demonstrating their messianic
messages, he barely touches on the esoteric themes . In his more popular works

such as Hayat al-Nafs , or a treatise in response to Muhammad ^Ali Mirza ,
dealing with the question of 'Resurrection' and 'Return', Ahsa'i cites traditions

the symbolic meaning   of the apocalyptic 'Signs' (^Alamat)• The same approach
may also be observed   in the works of Sayyid Kazim Rashti . Ahsa'i's opinion
about some messianic   tendencies of his own time also confirms this conservative
outlook. He wrote a    short tract in reply to Shaykh Musa Bahrani in which he
denounced a claimant   who declared himself to be the deputy of the Imam of the
Age (vakil-i Imam-i Zaman) .

The ostensible contradiction between      Shaykh Ahmad's theoretical
assumptions and his practical position could only partly be justified by his
efforts to combine the 'internal' (batM and the 'external' (zah-i?) . For the
most part however it was the practice of taqiya (prudential dissimulation) which
was responsible for the confinement of the Shaykhi eschatology to philosophical
and academic arguments. Ahsa'T's frequent references to the necessity of
taq-iya owing to the limited capacity of the ordinary man to grasp the true
meaning of the secrets of religion, bears clear signs of his hesitation to
declare his controversial views .

In a Persian risaHh in reply to Muhammad Riza Mirza on the question of
'Resurrection', Sayyid Kazim Rashti acknowledges these intellectual limits when
in the introduction of the treatise he maintains that:

Prudence and secrecy inspired an allegorical language which is not uncommon in
other proto-millenarian ideas of the past. Signs of these allegorical
speculations may be detected in Ahsa'i' s works which on one occasion for example

specified the date of birth and the date of 'Revelation' of the Qa'im in a

codified message . In another instance he quoted a tradition in which, regarding
the appearance of the Qa'im, Imam Ja ^f ar Sadiq       is reported to have said; 'His

cause will appear and his name will arise in the year sixty (yazhuru fi sana

Some cryptic speculations are also evident in a brief letter written by
Shaykh Ahmad to Sayyid Kazim in response to the complaints made by the latter

of the persecutions inflicted upon Shaykhis in the ^Atabat , and perhaps with
reference to Rashti's enquiries about the time when the appearance of the Imam
would resolve the hostilities. Ahsa'i replies with an enigmatic sentence:

> 'Regarding the possibilities (of Zwftur?) mentioned (in
> traditions) , there is no other way but to wait . . . There
> is no alteration in this cause, and for every call there
> is a deliverer but setting a precise date is not favour­

The verse quoted in the passage is from the Qu^an XXXVIII, 88.

The allusion in the above Quranic verse to 'after a while* (ba'd-a lni,n)

encouraged some Shaykhis to search for the definite date.               Mulla Ja 'f ar
Kirmanshahi who met Ahsa'i in 1241 Q. in the last months of the latter 's life,
related that when a group of his companions asked Shaykh Ahmad to indicate 'Signs

of Deliverance' ( fAlamat al-Faraj") , he replied 'sixty eight', and when they
asked for an explanation he replied with the same verse from the Qurhn: 'You
shall surely have news of it after a while'. Then they asked for further
elaboration, to which Ahsa'l replied: 'Is it not that the numerical value of o

i
is equal to 68?' .

This preoccupation with the revelation of the 'Promised One'

sometimes drew the attention of non-Shaykhi writers such as Tunikabuni who on a
few occasions in Q-isas aWc/Zama'discusses Ahsa'i 1 s views on Ma*ad and the Return

2   ' '                       *       - -
of Sahib
• •   al-Amr   . He  states that according   to Ahsa'i

.     the existence of the Imam
in this world is an assumption which could not be reached by deductive reasoning.
Although Tunikabuni believes that this is a 'firm and complete argument', yet
he states that this view differs from the majority of the 'ulama who usually
substantiate the existence of the Imam with the 'rule of Benevolence' (qa'-idih—i

3                             -   -
Lutf) . On another occasion, Tunikabuni recalls that in one of his lectures
Sayyid Kazim Rashti was commenting on a verse by Shaykh Ahmad; 'The smoke you see

shall ascend after me, I am the ignitor of that flame'.         The author then remarks
that this prophecy was fully realised. Not only did a great animosity exist
between Sayyid Kazim and the fuqaha3 , but two of his students, Ha j i-- Muhammad

Karim Khan Kirmani and Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad the Bab caused the greatest schism

.4

in the country. 'The flames of that fire are still alive 1 . The significance
of this remark is that Tunikabuni, as a representative of the dominant
notices a continuous line between the ideas of Ahsa'i and the emergence of the

Babi movement.
Cryptic speculations during the time of Sayyid Kazim Rashti, and the close

circle of his followers, continued to develop on the theme of spiritual
'Resurrection', yet in spite of its messianic undercurrent, Shaykhism remained
a school, close in many ways to the orthodox Shi^i theory, if not in harmony with
the prominent jurists. Rashti accepted the Usuli approach to 'external' matters,
and went to great lengths to represent the Shaykhi point of view on fiqh, usul

5                                '

and traditions in a purely academic manner . This was also aided by the

increasing pressure which was put on the Shaykhis during incessant waves of
condemnation at the end of Ahsa'i's life and throughout Rashti 's leadership. In
response to charges of 'deviation 1 and blasphemy levelled against them, Rashti

source of authority whose function cannot be replaced by the process of reasoning 2 .

— — 3         -
In a commentary on Qas-ida Lanriya , Rashti introduces a cyclical concept of
> prophethood which resembles the Isma ^ili view of history. He maintains that at
> the end of the twelfth century, the first cycle of prophethood, which corresponded
to the Prophet and eleven Imams, came to an end. This was the cycle of 'exteriors'
(zavahir) which was designed to perfect the 'external' capacities of human 'soul 1 .
The new cycle which is the cycle of 'interiors' (bavatin) or the cycle of
unveiling secrets, is to perfect the capacities of the human 'spirit'. As the
first cycle was an embryonic phase for spiritual evolution, the second cycle is the
age of adolescence.

> 'Thus when the first solar cycle of the prophethood (shams al-
> ndbuwwa) , which belongs to the perfection of exteriors and
> corresponds to the revelation of the name of Muhammad, is
> completed, there begins the second solar cycle of prophethood

> messenger of God in Heaven is Ahmad, and Ahmad also is the name
> of the murawij (promoter) and ra'is (head) at the beginning of
> this century, and certainly he came from the best land and purest
> climate '4.
Here, a new cycle of prophethood is contemplated which starts in the thirteenth
century A.H. The divine Sun manifests itself again in Ahmad, who is the heavenly
prototype of Muhammad in the past cycle, and whose reflection on the Earth illumi­
nated the initiator of the new cycle namely Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i. But if Shaykh
Ahmad    is    the    initiator    of    the   cyle   of   internal, where does the

Qa'im fit into this picture? Here, as far as the revelation of the Qa'im is
concerned, Rashti's enigmatic answer is open to interpretation. It is likely
that he regarded Ahsa'i and possibly himself as precursors, Gates or even

reflections of the Concealed Imam whose celestial existence is to justify the
unravelling of the interior. This is more understandable if Ahsa'i's theory
of multifold bodies is considered. If the Imam, the internal name of the new
revelation is still in the intermediary world of Hurqalya, the Gate (Bab} who
is the Perfect Shi^i, will be the only physical representation of him in this
world. Writing in 1263 Q. (1847), al-Qatil al-Karball'i, a student of Sayyid
Kazim

and a later Babi adherent, in his interpretation of the secret of s-ittin
(sixty) complies with the same opinion. He states that in the course of the
second cycle, from the beginning of the century up to the end of Sayyid Kazim's
life (1259/1844) was the age of bat-in. The representatives of this age, Ahsa'i
and Rashti, were indeed like elemental corpses (ajsad) for the celestial body

(jisrn) of the messenger, namely the Imam of the Age. But in the year sixty, the
spiritual body (j-ism haqiqi) which is the interior of the interior (batin al-

- .             1
batin)

appeared   . One may assume that in this stage of the development of the
Shaykhi thought under Rashti, while the 'gate' of the recognition of the Imam
is regarded as being reopened by Ahsa*i, his corporal return is still to be
awaited.

Further hints of the future appearance of the Imam may also be found in
> the oral accounts related from Rashti. Considering the danger of any open
> speculation, it is not unnatural that these oral references were confined to a
> small circle of devoted students. Almost all the accounts agree that towards
the end of his life, he became increasingly interested in the advent of the
'Promised One' who would appear after him. Haji Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmani,
who because of his opposition to the Babis constantly tries in his works to play
down the messianic content of Rashti's teachings, still agrees that when Rashti
was asked about his successor, he replied "Soon the cause of God would reach its
maturity". On many occasions in reply to the same question, he hinted; 'those
who are destined to be destroyed will be destroyed by the Proof (bayyi.no) , and
those who are destined to be resurrected will be resurrected by the Proof 2 .
It is also related that after twenty years during which Sayyid Kazim had

implicitly propounded the circumstance of the advent of the 'Promised One', in

1\.   Qattl. (513).
2\.   Haji Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmani, Izhaq al-Batil, Kirman, 1392, Q. t 14.

Ramadan 1258 (1842), just before that revolt of the Shi fi population of Karbila'

and the consequent massacre of the inhabitants by the Ottoman forces , he openly
publicised the imminence of the next Zuhur.

> 'After maintaining that He (the Promised One) is clear of
> any physical defect and imperfection, he (Sayyid Kazim)
> then specified His heavenly name (ism al-Samawi') , as the
> Prophet said my name in Heaven is Ahmad and on the Earth
> is Muhammad. Sayyid Kazim ended that month in describing
> His virtues, perfections and characteristics'2.

It appears however, that the increasing hostility of his opponents, and the
allegations brought against him regarding his role in the events of Karbila',
discouraged Sayyid Kazim from publicising his views on this particular matter.

Again Qattl reports that when in Ramadan 1259 (1843) Rashti was asked by his

students to disclose the secrets of the 'Perfect Shi^i' and the 'Fourth Pillar',
he replied:

> 'Last year we paid the greatest attention and fully
> discussed (this question), but we saw neither any

In spite of his reluctance to speak in public, in the remaining three months
of his life, from Ramadan to 10th Dhu al-Hijja 1259 (31st December 1843), Rashti

never failed to emphasise to his close companions the possibility of the
'revelation of the cause of God' soon after his own death, which he implied
would occur in the near future. Though he never made it clear to whom or to
what position he exactly refers by this revelation, amongst his students some
tended to believe that this was a reference to the appearance of a messianic
figure more significant than Ahsa'i or Rashti themselves. Many of the early Babi

sources reported that in Dhu al-Hijja 1259 during his last annual pilgrimage to

Kazimayn, when his students showed their grief and distress over his predicted

2\.   Qattl. (507) quoting Mull! rAli Tabriz!.
3\.   Ibid. (508).

death, he replied: 'would you not wish me to die so the cause of your Imam may
be revealed? 1  Further on his way, he warned two of his most well known students,
Mulla Hasan Gauhar and Mirza Muhit  Kirmani not to dispute and disunite after his

death on the question of succession since 'in thirty weeks the Cause will be
revealed to you* . In a gathering of his followers in Baghdad, he pointed to a
sword in front of him and repeated three times: 'Swear to God, the sword is
closer than what you might imagine* . QatH adds that many people misunderstood
him, but later when Mulla Muhammad Taqi Hiravi asked him the real meaning of his

allusion he replied: 'the cause of God would reach its maturity' and added 'but
our cause is not the same as that of the Gates' (Abwab: the Four Agents of the

Hidden Imam) .
The intention behind Sayyid Kazim's allusive remarks is not precisely clear,

but at least two conclusions may be reached. The first is his preoccupation
with messianic prophecies, the fulfilment of which he anticipated in the near
future, when the evolution of the cycle would reach its maturity. However, so
far as can be judged, it is unlikely that this was an anticipation of the
emergence of the Twelfth Imam in its full traditional definition, since his own
writings made such emergence conditional on the fulfilment of a series of complex
eschatological processes . But he also attached far greater importance to the
spiritual position of this 'Promised One' and to the circumstances of his

'revelation', than that of any Agent of the Imam. In a sense he implied that
the process which was started by Shaykh Ahmad at the beginning of the century
was a preliminary phase that would reach its culmination during the next critical
stage. Whether this 'Promised One' could be defined as the Bab , the 'Perfect
Shi^i', the 'Deputy of the Imam' or in fact the Imam himself is open to inter­
pretation.
Secondly, the teaching of Shaykh Ahmad and the esoteric interpretation

alluded to by Sayyid Kazim,

motivated many of his students and followers to
adopt a messianic outlook, often in contrast with the academic norms of their

1\.   Qatll. (508) cf. Nabil. 45. Qatll gives the list of the 14 of Rashti's

time.  The crisis of succession which occurred immediately after the death of
Rashti, and the widening difference between the 'conservative 1 and 'progressive 1
factions in the Shaykhi school, may be best explained in terms of such messianic
anticipations. While Haji Muhammad Karim Khan, Mulla Hasan Gauhar, Mirza Muhit

.       .                       .                     « •
Kirmani, Mulla Muhammad Mamaqani and Mirza Shafif Tabrizi each justified their

own assumed leaderships of the 'sect' in terms of academic and communal positions,
others such as Mulla Husain Bushruyihi, Mulla ^Ali Bastami, Mulla Sadiq

Khurasani, Sayyid Javad Karbala'i, Mulla Yusuf Ardabili and many other future
Babis, regarded the age of Ahsa'i and Rashti merely as a preparatory period for

achieving 'the interior of the interior (batin al-battn) to which Rashti was

—    -                              1"

considered as Baballah al-Muqaddam (the first Gate) .

The development of the theory of messianism in the ideas of Ahsa'i

and
Rashti, was only partly responsible for the enthusiastic reception, or equally
hostile response, which the Shaykhi school received in its forty years of activity
in Iraq and in Iran. The actual progress of the school and the practical
implications of this growth formed another factor influential in its appeal to
certain groups in the society. Elements such as pronounced piety and lack of
worldly interests in the Shaykhi leaders, and the very fact that Ahsa'i

for
nearly twenty years (circa 1221-1240/1806-24), with the exception of a few
intervals, spent his life visiting most of the important cities in western,
central and eastern Iran, greatly assisted the formation of a community of
followers throughout the country. Indeed paying visits at least of shorter
duration to cities such as Kirmanshah, Tehran, Mashhad, Yazd, Isfahan, Shiraz,

Qazvin, was a not uncommon practice among prominent mujtahids of the 'Atabat .
They usually visited these places by invitation of the local 'ulama, notables,
governors and state officials who had a special devotion to them. Ahsa'i

also
visited most Iranian cities and towns and attracted followers from the middle
and lower ranks of 'ulama, local merchants, local officials and some members of
the Qajar family. The diffusion of some ''ulama of Bahraini descent in cities

like Yazd, Shiraz and Kirman, who had either in one stage studied under Ahsa'i

or
were acquainted with him, or else regarded him as their head or leader, greatly
facilitated these visits. These were mostly the middle rank ''ulama, possibly

with Akhbari tendencies, who in the second half of the 18th century, chiefly
because of the Wahhabi incursions on the western coasts of the Persian Gulf,
immigrated to southern and eastern Iran .
Besides the above group, towards the end of Ahsa'i's life, many of the

Iranian ^ulama who had studied under him in the ^Atabat or met him during his
visits to Iran, and were influenced by his views, upon returning to their home
towns or villages, some of them remote, began to set up local teaching circles
and drew public attention to the Shaykhi cause. Shaykhi communities in Yazd,
Azarbaijan, Mazandaran and Kirman were the first which flourished as a result of
the efforts of Shaykh Ahmad's students. Distinguished mujtahids such as Haji

Isma G.1 ^Aq'da'i helped the expansion of Shaykhism in various provinces. Though
Isfahan was firmly in the hand of prominent jurists such as Shafti and Muhammad

Taqi Najafi, there were still eminent ^ulama such as Haji Mulla Ibrahim Karbasi,
who himself had studied under Shaykh Ahmad,   and showed great respect for Ahsa'i      .
During Rashti's leadership (1241-59/1825-43), the expansion of these early
circles was further boosted by the activities of the second generation of Shaykhi
students who had first been brought up in the local centres of learning in Iran,

often under students of Ahsa'i, and then studied with Sayyid   Kazim in  ''Atabat    .

They were more actively and firmly committed to Shaykhi teachings than their
predecessors whose attachment to Shaykhism rarely went beyond sympathy or personal
admiration for Ahsa'i. They tended to turn Shaykhism into more of a religious

school with a relatively strong nucleus in Karbila' and with a growing network
of students and followers in Iran, Iraq and India. Though from a practical angle
Shaykhism was still within the boundary of religious orthodoxy, yet by the time
of Rashti, it was beginning to be defined as an independent school, if not sect,

with a cohesive theoretical system and definite points of difference with the
opposition camp .

Though in this stage the Shaykhi community consisted of <ulama and the
religious students, it was also dependent on other groups who gave them their
allegiance. Thus the points of distinction between Shaykhis and non-Shaykhis
known to Shaykhis as Balasavis were not entirely based on theoretical differences.
Many of the Shaykhi sympathisers had a limited understanding of or interest in
the theoretical subtleties which differentiated Shaykh Ahmad

from the others.

Many of the merchants, small landowners, local state officials and other
educated and semi-educated groups who together with the middle and lower rank
mullas, were attracted to Shaykhism, often had a theological training too limited
to allow them to follow any philosophical argument. What interested them, as was
the case with multitudes of town dwellers and villagers who followed   Shaykhi
mullas, in jum^ih prayers or Shaykhi mujtahids in cities, was the moral and
spiritual values which they attributed to these leaders.

The sense of piety, devotion and austerity which characterised so
emphatically all the accounts of Ahsa'i's life, and usually exaggerated the

reality of his life, corresponded more than any other thing to this public need
for a saintly figure who could exemplify these highly admirable values. The
veneration and popularity which Ahsa'i enjoyed put him above his contemporaries.

In this sense Shaykhism, almost like the Ni (matallahis, responded to a public
demand for a spiritual leadership, which by its purity and unworldliness, could
stand above any temporal or 'orthodox' authority. This need became even more
tangible when during the first quarter of the 19th century, the growing power
of orthodoxy gradually reclaimed its ground by eliminating most of the unorthodox
elements and weakening the rival influences of the Sufis in Iran and the (Atabat.
The Usuli orthodoxy, owing to its very essence, and owing to its limited

margin for any intuitive meditation, was only partly able to satisfy this public
demand for a holy man. References to excessive devotion and lawful asceticism

mujtahids such as Bihbahani, Shaykh Ja^far Najafi, Shafti and Mulla Muhammad

Taqi Baraghani  may  be taken as signs of a general trend  amongst the fuqaha to
add spiritual virtues to their -Cjt-ihad qualities, so as to form a complete image of
a perfect divine. In the biographical accounts of Bihbahani, Ja^far Najafi,
Sayyid Ibrahim Qazvini, Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi and Shaykh Murtaza Ansari,

1\.   Dalil al-Mutahayyir-in (e.g. pp.10-11, 70-5, 138-40) gives clear indications

> of Sayyid Kazim's own notion of Shaykhism as an independent theological
school.

in addition to riyasat and marja^iyat, there are implicit references to niyabat.
Though such a position was often justified in terms of attainable qualities of
•ijtihad, it still has some sense of exceptional moral values attached to it.

However, in spite of spiritual attributions, the concept of •ijt'ihad was
always predominant. Thus one may suggest that the vacuum which emerged as a
result of the fuqaha' rs domination, was filled by Shaykhism, when all other trends
were effectively barred by orthodoxy. This emphasis on moral and spiritual
values seems to have appealed especially to certain sections of society, of which
the most noticeable were merchants and the middle rank mullas who both tradition­
ally looked towards the ^ulama for support, as they had the greatest respect
for their piety and godliness. As is reported by Ahsa'i's son, Shaykh Ahmad's-

long residence in Yazd was chiefly due to the enthusiasm which the inhabitants
showed for him, almost to the extent of extreme veneration . It is interesting
to notice that the bulk of this favourable response came from tujjar since Yazd
was one of the prosperous cities and perhaps the most important trade centre in
the whole of southern Iran in the first quarter of the 19th century 2 . The same
veneration was also expressed during Ahsa'T's visits by the inhabitants of other

-                  -   - 3
important trade centres such as Isfahan, Qazvin, Shiraz and Kirmanshah .

Shaykhi links with the merchant class is further evident in Sayyid Kazim
himself who was the son of Sayyid Qasim Hariri, a silk merchant from Gilan .

to Ahsa'T's discourses in Yazd, when he was still in his early twenties . Though
such mystical preoccupation, or attention to religious studies was not un­
precedented in the merchant families, still this was an important indication of
the popularity of the Shaykhis amongst the merchants. More examples of Shaykhi

merchants, or tullab with mercantile background may also be detected among Sayyid
Kazim's students. The network of Shaykhi sympathisers developed under Sayyid
Kazim, played an important role in the future progress of the Babi movement. Some

aspects of this mercantile involvement will be discussed in the following
chapters, but lack of sufficient information on the causes and nature of this
involvement prevents any further elaboration .

The second group of followers who became increasingly attracted to the
school were those local mullas and religious students who often came from a
humble social background. Contrary to the circles of the prominent fuqaha* which
were partly, though not entirely, formed of the students with clerical back­
grounds, and more particularly of sons and relatives of high ranking fulama of
the ^Atabat and Iran, the majority of the students in Rashti's circle, with the
exception of a few, were alike in their humble origins. Further attention will
be paid to this aspect of Shaykhism in the following chapters, but what needs
to be emphasised is the fact that Shaykhism under Sayyid Kazim provided an

opportunity for his adherents to unite in a religious body distinctively
independent from the rest of the scholarly community of the CAtabat. This
sense of solidarity and common identity was further strengthened by the critical
circumstances in which Rashti and his students found themselves almost
immediately after his succession to Ahsa'i.

It should be noticed that at the time when Rashti was appointed by Ahsa'i

to establish a teaching circle in Karbila* (circa 1240/1824),  he was only   twenty
nine years of age and thus had barely experienced the conventional training

which qualified most of his contemporaries for establishing teaching circles .
However, as can be judged from his numerous works, he was a talented writer, a
sophisticated philosopher and a skilful theologian who tried with some success
to continue the 'universality' of his teacher, though he hardly ever claimed
to have any of the personal mystical experience which was so characteristic of
Ahsa'i. From the very beginning of his leadership up to the end of his life,

he was continuously attacked from the side of the fuqaha' • Attempts first made
by Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani and his allies to issue denunciations (t

of Ahsa'i on the ground of his disbelief , were further intensified during

Sayyid Kazim's time who was less able than his teacher to rely on his position

and public respect. The same consideration which encouraged the mujtahid's to
drive Ahsa'i out of Iran and then the fAtabat, again motivated them to attack

Rashti, when he gradually managed to solidify his base in Karbila 5 by broadening
the Shaykhi network, attracting more students or involving himself in the local
politics .

The fuqdha* r s response came primarily from the hereditary ''ulama families,
and was then amplified by other mujtahids who claimed riyasat in the *Atabat.
In contrast to Shaykh Musa and Shaykh 'Ali Najafi, sons of Shaykh Ja^far, who at
the end of Ahsa'I's life, tried to patch up the differences between the two sides,
here Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi Tabataba'i (son of Sayyid Gvii and grandson of

Bihbahani) was the arch-enemy of Shaykhis and the chief instigator of numerous
takfirs. Others such as Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi, Shaykh Muhammad Husain

and many others in Iran assisted the ''ulama of the ''Atabat in their anti-Shaykhi
campaign. Though the Bahraini ^ulama generally remained silent, or occasionally

sympathised with Rashti, and though Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shafti, the most
influential of all the fuqdha 3 in the 1830's and 40's in Iran, refused to ratify
the fatva of denunciation , the result of the takf-irs was still effective. As
a result of this dispute which every now and then was renewed over a new issue,
Shaykhis were gradually forced into a defensive position, and then were isolated
at least in the 'Atabat.
The events of Karbila' in 1258/1842 temporarily strengthened the Shaykhis
hand from a political standpoint, though it further damaged their relation with
their adversaries. But it appears that Shaykhis isolation, and occasional

persecution in the ^Atabat, hardly affected their performance in Iran especially
in the towns and villages of Khurasan, Azarbaijan and Mazandaran. Indeed this
seems to have been a source of anxiety for many opponents of the school who saw
danger in this expansion. This anxiety was even further increased by the signs
of the Qajars' inclination towards the Shaykhi leaders. Throughout his journeys,
Shaykh Ahmad was enthusiastically received, and on many occasions invited by
the Qajar princes and governors who in some cases even argued with each other
over his place of residence. But the hospitality and devotion shown by Prince
Muhammad ^Ali Mirza Daulatshah in Kirmanshah and by Amin al-Daulih in Yazd and

Fath• ''Ali Shah in the Capital, or the tributes paid by Ibrahim Khan Zahir

al-
Daulih the governor of Kirman (Fath. ^Ali Shah's uncle and the father of Haji
Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmani) towards Shaykh Ahmad,    should not entirely be taken

as gestures of religiosity and devotion. Although some genuine religious motives
may be found in Muhammad ''Ali Mirza who always treated Shaykh Ahmad above the

responded to the action of the government .

Ahsa'i's lack of interest in politics was partly compensated for by Sayyid
Kazim who, in search of allies, became involved in the local politics of Iraq.
He maintained a limited but friendly relation with the Qajars, and especially
after the death of Fath ^Ali Shah with the Qajar princes exiled in the ^Atabat .
But he also managed to develop intimate relations with the Ottoman provincial
authorities.  His negotiation with Najib Pasha, the vali of Baghdad, during the
events of Karbila' (1842), and the safe conduct which he secured for his
followers when the Ottomans sacked the city and massacred the inhabitants, is a
sign of a friendly relation which was chiefly developed in contrast to the line

- -      - -3             T
taken by the other mujtahids such as Sayyid Ibrahim Qazvini . Yet Rashti's
policy should not be seen as wholly pro-Ottoman since some of the leaders of the
Yirmaz rebels in the city of Karbila' such as Ibrahim Za^farani, a luti of
Iranian origin who was reported to be responsible for the Karbila' rebellion,
appear to have been connected with Rashti. The earlier references concerning
Sayyid Kazim and his preachings in Ramadan 1258 (1842), nearly two months before

*—                            *                                      /
the Karbila' massacre, in which he publicised the advent of the 'Divine Cause' ,
make it possible to suggest that a movement which first started with some
messianic overtones later, in spite of Rashti's intention, went out of hand and
turned into a full scale rebellion with disastrous consequences.

By and large, however, involvement in politics remained always a secondary
issue for Shaykhism, compared with its main conflict with the fuqdha 3 . What was
decisively effective in the outlook and the character of the close students and
followers of Rashti, was the hostility which they increasingly experienced in
their encounter with their adversaries the Balasaris. In spite of attempts by
Rashti to reduce the tension and to follow a moderate, and on many occasions a
compromising policy, the pressure from the opposition was directly felt by some
members of the circle in the ^Atabat in the late 1830's and early 40's. The
internal divisions discernible in the Shaykhi ranks, even prior to the death of
Rashti, basically resulted from the differing policies recommended by each of
the two factions in response to the outside threat. While one faction, for a
variety of reasons, was more devoted to the messianism preached by the school

and sought the answer to the Shaykhi prophecies in the anticipation of the
advent of a spiritual leader to fulfil what the present Bab, namely Sayyid Kazim

was unable to carry out, the other faction, by undermining the messianic message
while minimising points of difference with the dominant orthodoxy, moved further
towards becoming a 'respectable 1 religious sect. As the first trend eventually
culminated in the Babi movement, the second trend resulted in full submission
to 'orthodoxy 1 (as with the Azarbaijani Shaykhis), or in the sectarianism of
Haji Muhammad Karim Khan and the Kirmani Shaykhis, or in the quietism of Mulla

Hasan Gauhar and Muhit Kirmani. Thus contrary to the opinion expressed by Corbin

and others that 'Babisme' was a deviatory current that 'departed from' the main­
stream of Shaykhi thought , it should be emphasised that not only in theory and
practice did Shaykhism offer the greatest contribution to the emergence of the
Babi movement, but in fact the latter was the natural outcome of almost half a
century of Shaykhi speculation on the problem of Resurrection.

CHAPTER TWO

Sufism and Popular Religion

The theoretical discussions put forward by Shaykhis as well as by other
individual scholars within the learned circles were only a part of a greater
concern with the messianic expectations in the Shi ^i environment.   Throughout
the last quarter of the 18th and the first half of the 19th century, the
elements of messianism also re-emerge in two other major developments; the
revival of the Sufi orders, and the widespread diffusion of popular prophecies.
Though these trends seldom passed the boundaries of speculation and intuitive
meditation, they were nevertheless highly influential in a process which
eventually resulted in the formation of a more comprehensive movement.

The revival of the Sufi orders in Iran were part of a greater revival of
Sufism in the Islamic world .   It manifested itself both in the reorganisation
of the old Sufi khaniqahi orders, and in the widespread preaching of the wandering

dervishes. The reasons for this renewed interest remain to be fully investigated .
yet it is evident that the existing vacuum in the intellectual climate in the
middle of the 18th century was largely responsible.   The weakening of the
'orthodox' domination which is shown in the transfer of the Shi^i religious
scholarship to the ^Atabat, was further increased by the less enthusiastic
reception of the ^ulama under Nadir and even Karim Khan.   This, to some extent,
temporarily reduced their influence, and allowed the wider diffusion of the
'non-orthodox' tendencies.   In the cities, especially in the central and
southern Iran, the need for leadership was satisfied by local figures who often

adopted Sufi affiliations to attract popular support.   Relative prosperity in
the regional economy, the recovery of trade in the later decades and the
improvement of communication between urban centres, permitted the Sufi
missionaries to seek new bases in these centres.   One of the important signs of
this mystical revivalism was in the diffusion of the Indian popular Sufism which
was reintroduced into the Shi ^i environment almost a century and a half after the
decline of Sufi orders in Iran.

The most outstanding example of this revival may be seen in the activities
of Ni 'matallahi emissaries who had by the last quarter of the 18th century
attracted a large audience in southern and central Iran.     In spite of a gradual
decline in the Iranian branch of the order during the 17th century, the Indian
branch which had survived in Dec can under Bahmani and Nizam Shahi rulers, seems

to have enjoyed favour and influence.   In the latter part of Riza ^Ali Shah's
life (died circa 1214/1799), who was the last important qutb of the order in

\
India , some of his Indian disciples were dispatched to Iran for the purpose of
'guiding' the remnants of the order. This appears to be not unconnected with
the pressures imposed on Riza ''Ali Shah after the death of his patron Nizam ''Ali

Khan of Deccan. Already in the 1760's, a certain Shah Tahir Dakani, who was

assigned by Riza ''Ali, had visited Mashhad and Yazd where he busied himself with
recruiting new disciples and even sending a certain Sayyid Muhammad, son of a
Yazdi merchant, to his qutb in Deccan 2 .
But it was sometime later in 1776/1190, when another well known Ni''matallahi
emissary, Mir ^Abd al-Hamid Ma''sum ''Ali Shah, arrived in Shiraz, that a serious
effort was made to win over the public . Riza Quli Khan Hidayat states that
Ma''sum ''Ali Shah's despatch was the result of a demand by Persian followers for

a delegation from India in order to preach the long eclipsed Ni''matallahi cause

in Iran . During the two and half years of his stay in the capital of Karim

Khan, he succeeded in organising a small but active group of devoted followers
who had been mainly recruited from the remaining survivors of the Ni fmatallahi-
Isma^ili communities of eastern Iran .     One of his earliest converts was a
certain Mirza ^Abd al-Husain, known as Fayz ^Ali Shah, who was originally from

Tun in Quhistan.   He had been the hereditary imam jum^ih of the town before
being converted to Sufism.   It is said that the discovery of a mysterious
message in his father's notes, which advised him to 'take "Knowledge" from the
mouths of Men' and make it a 'lamp' for his 'path', made him abandon his position,
change into old clothes, sew patches on his robe and travel to Isfahan where he
studied jafr and other 'hidden sciences' (^ ulum-i khafiyih} , before finally

reaching Shiraz . This remarkable change from shar^ to the practice of 'hidden
sciences' and then adherence to an Indian qalandar, were familiar signs of a
renewed millenarian tendency which had long persisted in communities with
unpronounced heterodox traditions.     The conversion of many other early disciples
from towns and villages of eastern Iran such as Mushtaq ''Ali Shah, originally
from Turbat Haydariyih, Darvish ''Abbas from Zaydabad in Sirjan; the centre of

Isma Tli affiliated tribe of ^Ata'allahis, Raunaq ''Ali Shah from Bam, Muzaffar
''Ali Shah from Kirman and many others from southern Khurasan, Kirman and Herat
indicates that this area with its long crypto-Isma^ili tradition was a fertile
ground for the growth of popular Sufism 3 .
What was preached by Ma^sum ''Ali and other Ni 'matallahi qalandars, was more

than the common guidance of the Sufi orders.     In its expansion, the order largely

reconstructed the old pattern of hierarchy , and also advocated the necessity
of Sha?( 2 (in spite of frequent charges of blasphemy and disbelief levelled
against them by their opponents),       yet in its essence it contained elements of
messianic thought.     The large audience which was attracted to them, first in
Isfahan and then in Kirman, Herat, Mashhad, Shiraz, the (Atabat and Kirmanshah,

—     —                              —     -   — 3
saw in figures like Ma (sum (Ali and his two young disciples Nur (Ali Shah and

Mushtaq (Ali Shah, saintly characters whose detachment from the worldly affairs
and material poverty had given them some exceptional superiority over the others.
Their eccentricity, meditations, wanderings, voluntary poverty, and claims of
prognostication as well as their assumed power of influencing the course of
events, made them popular with the common people as well as with the rulers and
political contestants.        In the unstable political situation of the last decades
of the 18th century, some of the local governors and semi-independent rulers
sought the alliance of the dervishes, chiefly to gain popular support, but also
because they believed in Sufi's magical powers which could be employed in their
favour.
Ma^sum (Ali Shah himself appears however to have claimed       no specific

messianic title, though  he maintained that his mission came as the result of a
dream in which his master had been instructed by the Eighth Imam to send his
disciples for 'guidance' (irshacC) to Iran .      The writings of the other early
Ni (matallahis however, bear evidence of some spiritual claims which are unmis­
takably millenarian.     The outstanding poetry of Nur (Ali Shah for instance,
contains frequent references with clear pantheistic connotations:

The same message reappears in the work of another Ni^matallahi poet, Muzaffar

'Ali, who in praise of his 'guide 1 Mushtaq ''All, recites:

> 'I am the treasure of the prophethood.
> I am the mirror of Iskandar.
> Swear to God, I am the eternal essence of this cycle.
> I am the seeker (mushtaq) of Haydari wine.
> Swear to God, I am the minstrel in this cycle,

> On the spur of the moment, I remove from the King's head,
> the crown and headgear of sovereignty.
> Today, Mushtaq ^Alt made it publicly manifest,
> the secret of QalandarZ 1 ?•.
The above examples, two of many similar pieces, reveal a sense of 'general'

messianic 'revelation' in the early Sufi converts. Nur ''Ali hints at a claim
of deputyship in the return of the past manifestations, whereas Muzaffar       ''Ali

justifies Mushtaq's deputyship by demonstrating his Ithna ^Ashari commitments.
References to Haydar    ( ^Ali), Ja^far (Imam Ja ffar Sadiq) and ^Asgar (Imam Hasan

''Asgari, the Eleventh Imam) are particularly important because they indicate a
new development in the belief of the Ni'matallahis who in the past had largely
remained uncommitted to Twelver Shi^ism. Significantly, Muzaffar,        a physician

with firm orthodox beliefs, like Fayz ''Ali rejected 'orthodoxy' while adopting
its messianic elements into his new Sufi beliefs.

Ambiguous references to claims of deputyship and divine manifestations, not
uncommon in past Ni''matallahi history, were connected to their attraction towards
the 'holders of secular power'. But their preoccupation with politics in the
more recent times was hardly ever expressed in terms of a militant uprising.
Instead, they regarded this involvement as complementary to the spiritual aspects
of vilayat* Assuming that the voli, or the qutb      of the time was assigned by the

Concealed Imam to supervise and implement both secular and spiritual aspects of

the Imam's authority, Ni^matallahis were content to 'vest' the secular power in
theory in the 'just 1 ruler of the time. This was a fifteenth century heritage
of Shah Ni (matallah and his other contemporaries which was originally designed
to reconcile the position of the qutb with that of the secular rulers,

particularly those who showed favour and respect towards the Sufis. This device
in the late 18th century enabled dervishes to take sides with the 'rightful'
ruler in the course of struggle between the fading Zands and the rising Qajars .
Already in the late 1770's in Shiraz, secret contacts had been made between
Sayyid Ma''sum ^Ali Shah and Aqa Muhammad Khan Qajar, then still under detention

•                       *

in Karim Khan's court, which suggest the Nifmatallahis' search for some sort of

secular support . Indeed Karim Khan's suspicion of the newly arrived Sufis was
not wholly unfounded, his fear being due not so much to Ni''matallahis' growing
popularity or the llama's possible reaction, as the dervishes' political align­
ment with the Qajars. This is also evident in the charges levelled against them
by a certain pro-Zand Darvish Jani Hindi who accused Ma''sum and his disciples of
plotting against Karim Khan . However, when they were expelled from Shiraz in
the middle of 1779/1093, they found temporary shelter in Isfahan. There they
offered their support and assistance to ^Ali Murad Khan, the Zand chief and the
governor of the city, in his bid for power against his numerous rivals just after
Karim Khan's death. In a t-ik-iyCh which was especially built for Fayz CAli, he
set up a screen to manipulate numbers and read the fortune of ^Ali Murad. But
even the practice of the 'hidden sciences' could not rescue Isfahan or change
the fate of the Khan . Thus it is not surprising to see that when ''Ali Murad
temporarily withdrew from the city, the Ni''matallahis, together with other
dervishes, shifted their allegiance to the victorious Aqa Muhammad  Khan Qajar,

'the Hero of Iran' (Qahriman-i Iran). On the temporary recapture of the city by
Zands, the Ni''matallahis were accused of having seditious ambitions similar to
those of Safavid Sayyids for bringing Qajars to power. As a result they were

humiliated, physically punished and expelled from the city.

Ten years later, on another occasion, the Ni''matallahis became involved in
a new round of tense political conflict in the city of Kirman, when in 1790-92

(1205-6) in alliance with the head of the Isma^ili sect Abul Hasan Khan the

biglarbaygi of the city, they mobilised the people of Kirman to hold out against
the desperate attempts by the Zands to recapture the city . The ambiguous
connections between the Isma^ilis and Ni Gnatallahis entered a new stage when the
popular support for Nur 'Ali and Mushtaq 'Ali was channelled against the pro-Zand

- -     -rr -         2

faction and in favour of pro-Qajar Isma'ili notables . This brought confrontation
with Mulla fAbdallah the chief mujtahid of Kirman, who encouraged his supporters
to attack dervishes. In a public meeting in the Jum^ih mosque, the agitated
public stoned Mushtaq ''Ali to death and injured other dervishes. Nur ''Ali Shah
fled from Kirman and a brief victory was achieved by the anti-Qajars. However,
shortly afterwards in 1793 when Kirman was captured by Aqa Muhammad Khan, a
brutal purge of the hostile elements was launched 3 .

No doubt the Ni''matallahis political activities were not independent of
their messianic claims. As in the past popular Sufi trends there was room for
the rise of secular rulers to be interpreted as an event with messianic
significance. But after the establishment of the Qajars in the opening years of
the 19th century the Ni''matallahis' role as political 'propagandists' was
gradually replaced by one of influential and respected figures involved in the
interfactional politics of the ruling family. Nevertheless, in the early
decades of the century they were still a considerable threat to be reckoned with
by the Shi^i ^ulama. As their sphere of influence gradually moved westward, it
clashed with that of the Usuli 'ulama who themselves had returned to the cities

of western and central Iran after the restoration of political stability. The
danger was first felt when in the period between 1793-5 Nur ^Ali Shah and then
his teacher Ma''sum ^Ali in the company of his close disciples, moved to the

^Atabat and began to preach amongst pilgrims and tullab of the religious

schools .  Save for a few reported cases of brief dialogues with a few of the
prominent fulama, the hostile reception of the anti-Sufi fanatics pushed
NiGnatallahis out of the ^Atabat and back to the border towns of Kurdistan,
where they seem to have enjoyed some popularity in the areas traditionally

influenced by Ahl-i Haqq . It is also from this period that many new disciples
from western Iran who had joined the order as a result of Nur ''All's efforts,
dispersed to northwest and central Iran and established permanent circles in the
first two decades of the 19th century.

In spite of a large but ephemeral popularity, the Sufis were losing ground
to the ^ulama who under Fath ^Ali Shah enjoyed the support of the monarch.

Indeed regardless of his occasional favours to dervishes, Fath ^Ali Shah's
general attitude towards Sufis was one of reticence and suspicion, a bitter
irony for the Ni^matallahis who in the past had supported the Qajars so
vigorously. The Shah's attitude no doubt contributed to the increasing hostility
of the fulama which is reflected in their numerous anti-Sufi refutations and

as 5iM.fi Kush, around 1211/1795 and the death of Nur ^Ali in Mosul under

suspicious circumstances, were signs of the 'ulama's increasing ability to
destroy their rivals sometimes even in accord with the State's wishes. In
Khayratiyih, Muhammad ^Ali Bihbahani himself plainly declares that 'The

responsibility of such acts (i.e. execution of the Sufis) falls only within the

jurisdiction of the 'ulama and the executors of shar'1 .

In the course of the next few decades, persecution and hostility reduced
the messianic zeal of the wandering qalandars, giving way to the urbanised
quietism of influential and often well versed Sufis who behaved no more as
eccentric figures, but as revered heads of an organised order. Beside the
theoretical ground for a conflict, the unanimous opposition of the clergy should
be seen in the light of their tense competition with the Sufis for the moral
leadership of the. community. In this struggle the Ni^matallahis' efforts created
a nucleus of devoted disciples who were able to recruit urban crowds or appeal to
groups of merchants, notables, local rulers and the Qajar aristocracy for moral
and financial support. But they lacked the commitment to a shari^at which gave

A
strength to their rivals and greatly facilitated their establishment. To this
must be added the attitude adopted by the state representatives. The influence
of the 'ulama over the public and the way they successfully channelled this
influence to political ends, persuaded the Qajars, or at least the dominant
faction within the ruling family, to come to terms with the ''ulama in order to
avoid instability and civil strife in the cities. Therefore, the Sufis'
popularity was not desired by the ''ulama or the state who equally feared the
resurgence of what the} labelled as 'heretical' feelings. Examples of cooperation
between the 'ulama and the state in suppressing Sufi elements can be seen not
only in the activities of Muhammad ^Ali Bihbahani which had the blessings of the

adepts, Muzaffar

Shah and Kausar 'Ali Shah some attempts to seek support from the pro-Sufi
elements in the Qajar state are visible. In the later years, in the course of
Muhammad Shah's accession to the throne (1834/1250), and subsequently during the

events which led to the downfall of Qa'im Maqam and the appointment of Haji

Mirza Aqasi, Ni ''matallahis played some part. This was primarily due to the
earlier influence of Sufis such as Kausar ''Ali Shah, Haji Zayn al-'Abidin

monarch , and his policy of restraining the ^llama's influence in the political
sphere, hardly produced any striking result.         The Ni ^matallahi order was largely
alienated from its original claims and was unable to recapture the public
attention and save for a few minor cases, the order remained passive throughout
the rest of the 19th century.        The exception was Haji Mulla Sultan ^Ali Gunabadi

(1251-1327/1835-1909) the qut'o of the Gunabadi suborder, who re-emphasised the
position of the qutb not only as the 'guide 1 , but as the representative and gate
to the imam of the Age.       The concepts of Tabavvub (Gateship) and bay ''at (oath of
allegiance) to Vali-yi Amr, may well be interpreted as a renewal of the older
traditions, yet the influence of the other messianic trends and the fact that he
originated in the area of Quhistan, the home ground of many earlier trends,

should not be underestimated .

Furthermore, a wide range of works produced by Ni ''matallahi writers were
important contributions to the development of esoteric understanding of the Qur'an
in the 19th century. In contrast to the fuqah3 r s interest in the exoteric dogmas
of religion discussed in f-iqh and usul al-fiqh, the Sufi authors, in an attempt
to solidify their esoteric interpretations, concentrated more on exegesis
(-afsir).   Nur C\li Shah's poetical work Tafs'tr-i, SuTra-yi. Baqara was followed by
Muzaffar ^Ali Shah's Tafsir al-Sab f zl-Mathcm/l and McL^rrru^at al-Bihar and then by

Majzub 'All Shah's Sharh-i, du (<2-yi vcrtd az Amir al-Mu? nrinin . Kausar <Ali Shah's
Persian commentary on the Qur y CZI,DUPCLT al-Haz-in:, was an attempt to give a scholarly
representation of the Sufi tafslr . This tradition of writing commentaries,
more than the actual content of these works, seems to have had some influence on
those later claimants who also used the commentaries on the Quzfan as means of
giving esoteric and messianic interpretations.

The revival of the Ni 'matallahi order was not the only example of Shi ^i-
Sufi revivalism in Iran though it was the most outstanding.          Other orders such
as the Zahabi, Nurbakhshi and Khaksar, after a long period of almost virtual
eclipse, began to emerge from obscurity. In Pars, Qutb al-Din Muhammad Zahabi

Iran and a long residence in Najaf, during which he taught al-Futuhat al-Makkiya,
settled in Shiraz, where he lived and taught for the rest of his life. Some
important Sufis of the next generation, often from different orders, studied
under him.  Yet the claim of some later Zahabi sources regarding the pupilage
of some well known 'ulama of the (Atabat such as Shaykh Ja ff ar Najaf i, Sayyid
Mahdi Bahr al-Ulum and Mulla Mihrab Gilani, and that they were instructed by
Qutb al-Din for spiritual guidance, should only be accepted with some reser-
vations.   Still further, the assumed connection with Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i while
the former was residing in Ahsa-,seems almost impossible if we consider the
chronological difference. In the next few decades the successors of Qutb al-Din
promoted the order in-Shiraz and attracted some local notables. The trusteeship
of the Shrine of Shah Chiragh (Ahmad b. Musa son of Imam Musa Kazim),the most
important pilgrimage place in Fars greatly assisted their stand. Yet the
Zahabis' claim of spiritual descent in their chain of 'guidance' from Imam Musa
Kazim

which entitled them to the trusteeship of the Shrine, and the fact that
they only recognised eight of the Imams specially aroused the (ulamas' hostility.
In the middle decades of the 19th century under Mirza ^Abd al-Nabi Sharifi
(d. 1231/1815) and Mirza Abul Qasim Sharifi Shirazi known as Mirza Baba the
order enjoyed some significance both in its social standing and in the field of
mystical and literary works, but in no way it infringed the norms of a formal

khaniqahi order by venturing any spectacular claim .

In the same period, the remnants of a branch of the Nurbakhshi order which
had survived from the pre-Safavid times in Khurasan and then in Na'in, also
appear to have undergone some revival. Haji ^Abd al-Wahhab Na'ini (d. 121/1797)
was the first modern qutb of any significance. Though references to his Uvaysi
attitude (one who is able to attain spiritual knowledge without a visible 'guide')
illustrate an 'intuitive' approach similar to Sayyid Muhammad Nurbakhsh, it also
gives his affiliation with the order something of a loose nature 3 . Other
branches and offshoots of the Nurbakhshi order were also known, in Quhistan and

adherents in Shiraz.      His contacts with the Ni^matallahis and his association
with some city notables and Qashqa'i khans gave him a strong position much
disliked by the fulama who accused him of 'contemplating khuruj' . The old
conflict between the Gilama and the Sufis continued to create animosity in
Shiraz from the 1820's to the 1840's.         But in Shiraz the climate was not always
in favour of the fulama.       In spite of chronic waves of persecution and violent
attacks by the mob, the Sufis seemed to have held out against their opponents.

nor the expulsion of Zayn al-"Abidin Shirvani from the city (circa 1236/1820) ,
nor the expulsion of Muhibb ^Ali Shah of the Chishti order , could much weaken
the Sufis' strength.      It appears that up to the death of the tolerant mujtahid
Mirza Ibrahim Fasa'i (died 1255/1839), the Sufis were accepted as part of the
religious elite in the city .

f            At the time of the
Wahhabi invasion of Iraq (1216/1801) he fled from Karbila', and eventually ended
in Shiraz where he was well received as a prominent mujtahid and continued as
a prosperous merchant and money lender. Though his sons continued their
father's dual profession, two of them, Haji Muhammad Husain (died 1249/1833) and

Aqa Muhammad Shirazi (later titled Munawar ''All Shah) (1224-1301/1809-1883),

_ i
were converted to Sufism and became disciples of Sukut . This was followed by
the grandsons of Haji Muhammad Hasan, who much to the mujtahid's disgust, turned

•      «     •

to Sufism; of them the most important was the future head of the Ni fmatallahi
order, Muhammad Husain Rahmat ''All Shah (1208-1278/1793-1861) 2 . By the time of

Mirza Ma''sum Na j ib al-Sadr, the great grandson of Haji   Muhammad Hasan and the

author of Tara'-iq al-Haqa*iq, the whole family were committed to the order.
But it was not because of their financial strength that they were able to
encourage Sufism in the city. In 1250/1834-5 after Muhammad       Shah's accession,

owing to the moral support he had long received from Ni''matallahis, Rahmat ^Ali

Shah was appointed to the office of Na'ib al-Sadr in Shiraz . This appointment,

which was greatly in the Sufis' favour, provided a considerable control by
Rahmat  ''Ali Shah over the pensions and allowances of ''ulama and -kufiab

<      in Shiraz,
as well as over the collection and distribution of the income from endowments in
the province. This gave the Sufis some official backing which lasted up to the
end of Muhammad Shah's reign.

Thus, in the period between 1790 T s to 1840's, the growth and establishment
of three major orders, which were all represented in Shiraz, turned this city
into one of the important centres of Sufism in the central and southern Iran.
This in turn allowed the emergence of. an intellectual climate hardly discernible
in any other part. But besides the established Sufi orders, the city also hosted
a great number of wandering dervishes with Jalali, ''Ajam and other Khaksar
affiliations who in their journeys to and from India, Anatolia and central Asia,

took up their abode in the Hkiyihs of Shiraz .   Their vast network extended
from ChishtT khaniqahs of Punjab and Deccan to central and then western Iran,
to Kurdistan and Azarbaijan
••        amongst the communities of Ahl-i Haqq,

•     and then
further to Anatolia, Roumelia (and as far as Albania) where they were connected
with Bektashi, Naqshbandi and Mewlevi centres. In the east, they were
concentrated in central Khurasan in Turbat-i Haydariyih where the tomb of Qutb-
al-Din Haydar was located 2 , and from there they
'

travelled up to Central Asia,*
•                                                                        ^
to Marv, Khiva, Samarqand and Bukhara, to visit the Tomb of Sultan Jalal al-Din

Haydar and stay in Naqshbandi khaniqahs. On the way back they passed through

Balkh, Herat and Qandihar to end up again in northern India. Their journeys
also included frequent visits to the 'Atabat, the Hijaz and southern Arabia.

Widespread travels and contacts with various orders, sects and ideas,
defined as sayr-i afaq va anfus (exploring horizons and souls), which in theory
was to purify the 'seeker' so as to give him a material detachment and moral
insight, in reality opened the wandering qalandars to an amalgamation of broad
and diverse 'heterodox' ideas and attitudes. They seem not to have had a firm
hierarchical order and lacked a well defined doctrine, yet on a popular level,
their function as intermediary agents between various schools of Sufism and
over a large geographical territory, was highly significant. The wandering
dervishes were indeed responsible for the reintroduction and diffusion in the
Iranian environment of many 'heterodox' ideas, rites, popular beliefs and
behaviours which ranged from Hurufi cabbalistic gnosticism inherited by the

BektashTs, to the extremism of Ahl-i Haqq, Nusayrism in western Iran (or others

in Central Asia), popular Indian pantheism, and pagan pre-Islamic beliefs of
Arabia. Their ideas and expressions were often too eccentric and spectacular
to be taken seriously. Henceforth they rarely caused any concern for the
authorities, and if they ever did create any trouble they were easily thrown out
of towns. But their eccentricity gave them a chance to transmit messages and
ideas which could not be conveyed otherwise. By way of entertainment, story
telling, singing and reciting poetry, or by performing magical and other extra­
ordinary acts, they were able to draw public attention.

References in most sources hardly ever go beyond description of the appear­
ance and the public behaviour of the wandering dervishes .   Some hints, however,
in the accounts of encounters with dervishes of Jalali, Bektashi and Mewlavi
orders shed some light on their attitudes, particularly with regard to the new
developments which were taking place around them.   The way they saw and inter­
preted the superiority of the 'Christians' over 'Moslems' is an example of the
apprehension which by the 1840's was beginning to develop amongst the ordinary
people of Iran, Turkey and Central Asia, mostly in response to the imminent
threat by the neighbouring powers.   The widely travelled dervishes were amongst
the first to notice and interpret these changes by identifying them with the
past calamities or with the familiar examples of messianic movements*   On his
way from Tabriz to Tehran Dr. Wolff, for instance, records meeting a 'learned'
dervish called ^Abd al-Wahhab Gilani who in response to the former's evangelical
preachings, likened him to the disciples of Badr al-Din of Samawna who believed
that 'the property of men ought to be used in common'.   The dervish then gave an
account of the 15th century revolt of Burkoluj Mustafa who 'he believed was still

2                                                    T
alive'. He considered Wolff as the protoype of the 'farangis', and with the
usual mixture of satire and fantasy added:

> 'I heard of you at Delhi where you have conversed with
> Akbar Shah, the king of Delhi, and mewlevees there,
> and I have heard of you at Cashmere. You have been a
> Jew, and all great events proceeded from the followers
> of Moses, and will proceed again until Eesa (Jesus)
> will again make his appearance. When these events
> shall take place, and you shall see yourself surrounded
> by your followers, then remember derveesh of Geelan.
> Abd-ool Wahab has not succeeded in reforming the world,
> but you will'3.

Again on another occasion on his way back from Bukhara, Wolff met a party
of dervishes who warned him that 'the time will come when there shall be no
difference between rich and poor, between high and low, when property shall be

in common - even wives and children' .      Wolff heard of an Afghani sayyid
that:

> 'I know these Frankee derveeshes - I know these English
> derveeshes. They go into a country, spy out mountains
> and valleys, seas and rivers; find out a convenient adit,
> and then go home, inform a gentleman there - a chief,
> who has the name of Company, who sends soldiers, and
> takes the country 1 2.

This idea was repeated by other dervishes. In a gathering in Marv a dervish
while relating the deeds of Timur, suddenly broke off, and turning to Wolff,
said:

> 'The English people are now Timur,   for they are descendants
> of Ghengis Khan. The Inglees will    be the conquerors of the
> world. On my pilgrimage to Mecca,    I came to Aden, where
> they keep a strong force, and from   whence they may march
> to Mecca wherever they please; and   march towards Mecca they
> shall'.

Wolff relates that when a Turkoman in the audience said; 'the Russians shall be
the conquerors of the world' and 'all is over with Islam', another dervish
agreed with him: 'the great mullas of Samarcand assert that Russia is the Jaaj-
Majooj (Gog and Magog), and this has been already predicted by Ameer Sultan,

3 Only to a limited degree should the above remarks
the great derveesh of Room'
be taken as signs of a general alarm, but nonetheless they convey an impending
sense of millenarian yearning. It is evident how the fear of a superior alien
power whose nature is not clearly known, can stimulate the imagination of
ordinary people to look into their own past and their eschatological future in
order to find an identity for this unknown danger.

The wandering dervishes were not the only group who were speculating on the
political changes. By the second quarter of the 19th century, particularly in
the uncertain times of Fath• ^Ali Shah's later years, there was a tendency in
Sufi circles to prognosticate political changes and more specifically the future
of the monarchy. The Sufi adepts who had by then abandoned their own independent
extreme claims, now tried to solidify further their links with the secular rulers
not only by means of converting members of the ruling family and high rank
state officials to their orders, but by predicting the future accession to the
throne of a pro-Sufi prince. Tara*iq al-Raqcf iq relates that at the time there

•          *

was a widespread prophecy amongst the mystics and ascetics that after Fath• 'Ali
Shah, the monarchy would be transferred to a certain Muhammad who had Sufi

leanings and was attached to the Ni fmatallahi order.   The author sees this as
the chief reason for Fath ^Ali Shah's hostility towards Sufis 'since he imagined

• f                                                    i
that these people (i.e. dervishes) were in favour of termination of his dynasty 1 .
He then states that some merchants sought the opinion of the ascetics,
astrologers, geomancers and jaffars to specify whether after Fath ''Ali Shah the

_   — _                     _ — _        *   _ 9
monarchy would go to ''Abbas Mirza or to Muhammad ''Ali Mirza Daulat Shah . But

—         —
opinions were divided. Shaykh fAbdallah ibn Mubarak believed that Fath

Shah would outlive both his sons and then after him the monarchy   would go to a
certain Muhammad. Sayyid Sadr al-Din Dizfuli a Zahabi Sufi from    Shiraz believed

the same . Haji Muhammad Hasan Na'ini (died 1247/1831) the qutb    of the

Nurbakhshis in Na'in, forecast that 'this prince would ascend to   the throne but
because of slaying an innocent sayyid, he would not enjoy his rule' .

These and many other speculations suggest that towards the end of Fath• ''Ali
Shah's reign, the uncertainty on the question of succession, a growing power
struggle between rival contestants and the increasing threat of the outside
powers, encouraged speculations which were in some cases vital for the interests
of the various supporting groups .

But these prognostications were not confined to the future of the monarchy.

Some mystics with an Uvaysi approach, frequently expressed interest in the
mysteries of Zuhur. The Babi chronicler Shaykh Muhammad Nabil Zarandi quotes
an aged Babi, Mirza Muhammad Qamsariwho had himself visited Haji Muhammad Hasan

•                                       ...
Na'ini. In his youth while he was in Kashan, Mirza Muhammad heard of 'a certain
man in Na'in who had arisen to announce the tiding of a new Revelation, and
under whose spell fell all who heard him, whether scholars, officials of the
government, or the uneducated among the people 1 . In search of the truth of
this claim, Mirza Muhammad proceeded to Na'in where he himself heard Haji
> Hasan declaring 'Ere long will the earth be turned into a paradise.

Ere long will Persia be made the Shrine around which will circle the people of
the earth'. On another occasion Haji Muhammad Hasan during his zikr even

_ _                    .        •    •
informed Mirza Muhammad 'that which I have announcing to you is now revealed'.

At this very hour the light of the 'Promised One' has broken and is shedding
illumination upon the world' 2 . This intuitive prognostication may also be
detected in another ascetic, Mulla Hasan Arandi Na'ini, one of Muhammad Hasan's
disciples. al-Ma 3 athir va al-Athar states that Mulla Hasan T s 'intuitive
knowedge' was so strong, that, as has been often mentioned, he had 'forecast

__                              Q
the harm which would come to the Shai^i^at from the Bab's appearance' .
It is not a mere coincidence that Haji Muhammad Hasan, and his disciple
Mulla Hasan, though from entirely different backgrounds, both represented a

recognisable Way si approach. Haji Muhammad Hasan was the son of a prosperous
merchant of Yazd , whereas Mulla Hasan was a simple shepherd in the deserts

around Na'in before 'being chosen' by Muhammad Hasan to follow the Uvaysi path.

Indeed the latter's life is characteristic of Sufi asceticism. For sixty years
he lived in a single room in Madrasih-i Nimavard in Isfahan.

The same austerity, voluntary poverty and intuitive insight may also be seen in
other Uvays'is.   The spirit of expectation in the independent ascetics, as in the
wandering dervishes or the Ni^matallahis, had little direct effect on the course
of the later messianic developments, but nevertheless its echoes survived in the
heterodox milieu only to recur in the course of the messianism of the later
decades.

II

Theories and speculations which developed among ascetics and Sufis often
served as primary motives for a wide range of popular prognostications and
anticipations.    What developed in tariqat or amongst individual ascetics in

many instances revitalised incoherent expectations which already existed on a
popular level.    Occasionally traces of theoretical messianism are clearly
visible in popular beliefs, but usually it had an effect in a diffused form on
individuals who were on the borderline between popular religion and the world
of scholarship.
A clear example may be perceived in the works of Muhammad Hashim Asif

- 2                             '
known as Rustam al-Hukama' . He belongs to a generation of the urban dwellers

who in their lifetime witnessed the change in the sixty years span between the

fall of the Zands and the end of Muhammad Shah's reign (from 1780's to 1840 f s)

(UCLA MS. p.71 ff) he also gives some information on his background.

His concise and simple, yet sometimes deliberately pompous, rhythmical and
sarcastic style, his imaginary characters, titles, positions and events, as
well as his constant shifts from reality to fiction, suggest a strong influence
of popular narratives in his work. Rustam al-Hukama''s  interpretations of

historical facts and political realities are often mixed with his apocalyptic
fictions.  This is evident in his references to the circumstances of the
imminent Zuhwt? of the Imam Mahdi. They reflect the political upheavals which

by the second and third decades of the 19th century were beginning to affect the
Iranian public. Similar to the Sufis and the wandering dervishes, Rustam al-
Hukama* tries to explain these changes in terms of millenarian events.

An example of these speculations appears inRustam al-Tawarikh. In an
additional introductory passage, most probably written prior to the final draft ,
the author in the middle of an imaginary story hints at the advent of the Mahdi:

> 'By God's will in the year 1251 (1835-6) in Iran, one of

With the assistance of his minister, an old man from Fars who would be perfect
in all virtues, embellished with honesty and faithfulness and skilled in all
sciences, the Qa'im would rule with justice. 'But the peo.ple of the world
would never be content with justice and equity, and therefore when He is away

against Him and would claim that He is a Sufyani ruler'. Then from the notables

seen anything like it 1 . In one of his qas^dihs, which was evidently composed

—           —                 2

in imitation of Shah Ni^matallah' s famous elegy , he again states that the
shortcomings and failures of the Muslims would bring forth a disastrous defeat
by the Russians.     But the pressure of the oppressors would not last long:

> 'The Qa'im of the house of Mustafa would appear
> I see in him the glory,
> He is the guide to all the misled in the world
> I see the celebrated

Another example of Rustam al-Hukama' 's speculations appears in an epilogue
to the collection of his Nas/ihat Namih which was written in 1260-61 (1844-5)
when he was almost eighty years old.     Here, he lays emphasis more on the Mahdi
and less on the na'ib, whom he vigorously expects to appear in 1250.         Already
in the epilogue of Rustam al-Tawarikh he had postponed the date of the 'great
disaster' to 1252-3 (1835-6) , but here after ten years it appears that he is
no more interested in the appearance of the 'deputy' of the Imam whom he had
anticipated to be one of the Qajars.     It is difficult to know if his lack of
interest was because of the poor performance of Muhammad Shah, who could hardly

match the glorious na'ib-i Mahdi of Rustam al-Hukama', or because of a change in

his attitude towards the 'ill-fated Christians' whom        he so gravely feared.
Nevertheless, in a short passage written in 1262 he admires the people of Rum,
Turkistan, India, Russia, and the seven kingdoms of Europe (haft qirat-i, farang) .

> 'In those places, there is justice, equity and order,
> and in every matter law and order is prevalent in
> its highest degree, whereas in Iran, contrary to these
> places, the people are only capable of understanding
> traditional knowledge (manqul fahrri) and susceptible
> to fables (afsanih paztr} ' -> .

In spite, however , of his earlier disappointments about the time of the Zuhur,
the idea of the advent of the Qa'im reoccurs in the writing of Rustam al-Hukama'.

Again in Dhu al-Hijja 1260 (December 1844),    he confirms that in fifteen months

*—                                                               6

time, that is Rabi^ al-Awwal 1262 (April 1846), the Qa'im would finally appear .

He praises the Qa'im with the highest titles in another qasidih in which he
describes the circumstances of the Zuhur. He confirms that this would happen

in the year Rabb—i Ghani, which numerologically is equal to 1262 . But he warns
his reader to be on guard against the appearance of 'imposters'. In the list
of his works, he refers to a risalih which he compiled 'in rejection and denial
of those who claim to be the na*ib of Sahib al-Zaman'.

Fear and admiration for the West, in comparison to instability, insecurity
and decline at home, led Rustam al-Hukama' to seek for some messianic prophecies.

But in spite of his long lasting anticipations, in reality Rustam al-Hukama'

still firmly recognises the 'just king' and the 'just divine', as the true
holders of a divine mandate. His condemnation of those who claimed to be the
deputy of the Imam leaves no doubt that his expectations were entirely within

the boundaries of the existing secular and religious systems . Although in
theory he expects an Arab youth to rise, in reality he is not prepared to see
anyone but the accepted authorities as the deputy of the Imam. This might
suggest that his condemnation of the 'imposters' is perhaps referring to the

Babis, who had at the time begun to propagate the advent of the Bab .
Besides ideas expressed by Rustam al-Hukama', there are other popular

prophecies and speculations which indicate the widespread diffusion of
millenarianism in this period. Such ideas had distinctive effects on the later
currents of thought. For instance they not only influenced the conversion of

many individuals to the Babi movement, but affected the entire formation of
the movement in its early days.   These themes particularly caught the attention
of the Babi-Baha'i sources who often in order to emphasise the extraordinary
aspect of the new manifestation, took care to record them.   Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad

the Bab himself made reference to the 'coincidences' (iqtiranat') and the
circumstantial 'signs' and 'prophecies' which he believed to have been
emphatically pointed towards his revelation, while maintaining that in spite of
their sincerity and true inspiration, they could be taken only as secondary
proofs of his claim .   It may be argued that accounts in the Babi sources
concerning the earlier prophecies about the Zuhur may have been assembled with
a hindsight in order to justify the 'cause' of the Bab.   Nevertheless the fact
that the early accounts such as Nuqtat al-Kaf or Qat-il, as well as the writings
of the Bab himself make use of such ideas shows that they were greatly influenced
by prognostications and speculations of their time.

Amongst other things, the Bab occasionally referred to an Indian jaffar,
who with his knowledge of numerology even prognosticated his name and the date
of his revelation:

> 'The Lord will return to you amid the two initiations (fi,
> al-nash*atayn) ,
> To revitalise the religion after ra and ghayn (i.e.    j :
> 200 +    £ : 1000 = 1200)
> Thus multiply the essence of huwa (i.e.     -*: 5 + j:
> 6 = 11 : >A ) by number of its letters (i.e. 2 x 11 = 22)
> And that is the name of the pole of the two worlds'"2.

Other sources also acknowledged the Indian Jaffa? in Karbila' who heralded
the emergence of the Bab, though not surprisingly with conflicting inter­
pretations.  al-Qatil al-Karbala'i maintained that the jaffar's mathematical
calculations confirmed the authenticity of the Bab . Tunikabuni on the other
hand states that when Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad visited Karbila' prior to 1260, a

murtaz (an ascetic; usually Indian) forecast the evils which would soon arise

4                                -        - -
from his claim. More significantly, Sayyid Javad Karbala'i, a follower of

Rashti and one of the earlier believers in the Bab , relates that speculations
of the Indian ascetic known as Sayin in Karbila', greatly assisted him in his
search for the 'Promised One'.  In his brief reply to Sayyid Javad, Sayin wrote
a short message containing a series of mysterious figures. When Sayyid Javad
eventually deciphered the message, he noticed that by employing hisdb-i, jumal,
each figure contains a message:

Other signs of the Indian influence on the early Babis may also be seen
in Aqa Sayyid Basir Hindi, a blind mystic from a family of Sufi dervishes in
India whose search for the spiritual 'guide' eventually introduced him to

-                    3           ...

Sayyid Kazim and then the Bab . He was first motivated by his forefather's
prophecy regarding the appearance of the 'Perfect Soul' (Nafs—i Kamil) in the

land of Iran . The prophecies of another Indian also aroused the curiosity of
Mirza Muhammad ^Ali and Mirza Hadi Nahri, two Babi brothers from Isfahan who

once met in Karbila* a Shi^i pilgrim from the 'remote parts of India' who in
reply to their query, told tl ^m that according to the traditions circulating
in his homeland, the revelation of the Qa'im would occur in the thirteenth
century A.H.    There were other allusions which also led the 'seekers' to the
Bab. Years before the appearance of the Bab, another convert, a certain Shaykh
''Ali Khurasani heard some poetry from a pilgrim in Mecca that alluded to the
date of Zuhur . Mirza ''Abd al-Wahhab Khurasani, who also was a Babi, first met

- *                                  T                              7

Also the Bab refers to an Azarbaijani believer who twenty years prior to the
Bab's arrival in Azarbaijan in 1263 (1847) saw in his dreams two men who read
an Arabic quatrain:

> 'Sixty and two renewed,
> the cause which was unpreceded,
> He is a Guardian (vaVT) or an assigned messenger,
> who descended from two pure branches' 1 .

Indeed Azarbaijan was a breeding ground for a variety of popular
speculations in this period.    One may assume that this is not unrelated to a
rich popular mysticism in the towns and villages of the province which survived
up to the 19th century.    Haji Mu^in al-Saltanih, himself a native of Tabriz,

*                •

in a section devoted to the 'heralds of the Revelation', describes a number of
individuals who at various levels were influenced by these popular messianic
ideas.   Amongst them was a humble old Tabrizi who some time prior to 1260 used
to decorate walls and gates of mosques and houses in Tabriz with a mysterious
inscription   »^1 • Jb *   On one occasion when he was questioned by one of the
'ulama of the city about the meaning of this strange practice, he replied that
it was an allusion to the forthcoming ZuhuT of the 'Proof of God', and that he

was only performing a duty for which he had no logical explanation .

In spite of an evident contradiction with the traditions about setting a
date for the revelation of the Imam, emphasis on the significance of 1260 may
be observed in the popular beliefs of the time.    The widespread circulation of
ambiguous accounts concerning the death of the Eleventh Imam and the Concealment
of the Twelfth Imam in 260 A.H. (873-4) was a source of inspiration for many
popular figures, and for those who were preoccupied with messianic prophecies,
to speculate on the occurrence of the Zuhur after the lapse of a millenium.

Besides Rustam al-Hukama', the Indian Jaffa? t or the old man from Tabriz, many

other popular prognosticators in the 19th century were also obsessed with setting

m

the precise date. The numerological chronogram la Zuhur al-Haqq (<>*»•''o*t-*:> v )

' *                             3

which is equal in numerical value to 1261 was much favoured by early sources .

> See^for example NK. 93. Also the title of Mirza Asadallah Fazil Mazandarani' s
Zuhur al-Haqq seems to have been inspired by the same epigram.

Qatil al-Karbala'i states that this point was not only noticed by the Shi^i
sources, but others such as Christians, Europeans (Farangi) , Mandaeans (Sabi'i ),

Zaroastrians and Jews as well as Ni'matallahis, Isma'ilis, Zaydis and Vaqifis,
all acknowledged the importance of the year sixty-one . To strengthen his
argument, he refers to the Jews who he believes were expecting the coming of the

r\

messenger in Rabi' al-Awwal of that year . Further he gives some examples of
Sufi writings, including poetry of Shah Ni'matallah Vali and Muhi•

al-Din Ibn
^Arabi who, as Qatil alleges, both prophesied the occurrence of the Zuhur in

3      r
the year sixty one . Qatil f s tone, like most other Babi sources, tends to
emphasise that in spite of their clear implications, which he believed were
solely directed towards the Bab's revelation, these prophecies had been mis­
interpreted by the followers of these creeds.

Some astrologers (munajjims) were also credited with predicting the date,
or confirming the magnitude of the new revelation. Timur Khvarazmi, an
astrologer from Isfahan, predicted that between 1230-50 (1814-34) great upheavals

> 4   T ___                  __                               _ .

would prevail . Mirza Aqa Munajjim Isfahani, who was an astrologer to Manuchihr
Khan Mu'tamid al-Daulih in Isfahan, was more specific when he pointed out that
the year 1260 Q. would witness 'incredible events' . Another astrologer, Mirza
Ja'far Tabrizi believed that his astrological tables made it certain that the
cause of the young Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad, then at the beginning of his 'mission',

•                       £

would expand in the world and would last for a millennium .

Not only astrological coincidences, but disasters and human miseries, were
also taken as signs that would precede greater apocalyptic upheavals. In
particular, the outbreaks of cholera which up to the end of the 18th century
was unknown in Iran, generated some speculation . Mulla Muhammad Hamza*

Shari^atmadar, a student of Ahsa'i,

believed that the outbreaks of cholera and
plague in the ^Atabat in 1830's (because of which he reckons only one tenth of
the population survived) were a divine punishment for the 'ulama's negligence
and enmity towards the true message of Shaykhism. He maintains that this was a
prepatory measure for the emergence of the Qa'im . So does another Shaykhi,
Mulla Ja^far Qazvini, who relates that while Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i was staying in

Kirmanshah, he warned the public of the imminent outbreak of cholera and plague

as a sign of revelation . The Bab himself also implies that the cholera was a
punishment for negligence towards his message, and states that:

> 'From the beginning of the Revelation, see the multitudes
> who lost their lives because of cholera. This is one of
> the signs of the Zuhur which people tend to neglect.
> In four years, probably more than one hundred thousand
> souls from among the Shi'i's alone, perished, and no one
> is aware of its (hidden) meaning'3.
Cholera was only one of many symptoms which were detected as 'signs' of the
emergence of a comprehensive 'Revolution' (Fitnih, Fitna} at the End of the Time.
Though the Bab himself, chiefly because of his peaceful nature, was very cautious
in using the term, others such as the author of Nuqtat al-Kaf did not hesitate

to use the words Fitnih and Imtihan (torment) to describe the violent events

which were to take place at the time of the Qa'im's manifestation . The author
states that the speculations of the astrologers, the poetry of the mystics, and
other fallible evidences, would only confirm the proofs of hikmat, the Quranic

verses and Imam's sayings in establishing the occurrence of an inevitable
some time after the year sixty. He points out that though 'common people may
assume that the emergence of the Qa'im, may peace be upon him, will be immediately
followed by a mass conversion' in reality it is almost impossible for him to
prevail without being engaged in a violent struggle with his enemies. Basing
his arguments on the traditions about Fitnih, he further emphasises that the
severity of such trial is    such that even amongst the Qa'im's Companions
(Nuqaba*), only a small group would be able to hold their allegiance up to the
very end .

Similarly to    Qatil, in the mind of Haji Mirza Jani, the 'signs' of the

manifestation and the upheavals of the Final Day were not confined to the lands
of Islam, but stretched beyond to European lands (mulk-i Farang) . When for
example describing the events following the execution of the Bab in Tabriz in
1266 (1850), the author refers to the enquiry made by the Russian and the Ottoman
envoys (ilchi-yi Rus va ilohi-yi Rum) regarding the Bab and the Babis. He
believed that this was because they also had 'oppressed subjects' (zu^afa-yi
ra^iyat) in their own countries, but treated them better, and tried to understand
their problems . Yet in the author's view, the prime cause for the Farangls'
enquiries was that in their traditions (akhbar) , the 'Promised One' would draw
the sign of the Cross (Khaj): something which in the author's view is identical
with the Bab's numerous calligraphic inscriptions in the shape of the haykal

Yy      . Also in their Akhbar, Nuqtat al-Kaf notifies, 'a dragon would
appear in the Land of Parang, from whose head Parang-is would remove a diamond'.
Finally he states that one of the 'signs' which has already been fulfilled is
that the monarchy of Farang has collapsed and instead a republican state
(daulat-i jumhuri) has been established . Strange fantasies aside, the
connection between the 'suffering subjects', the fall of the monarchy and the
establishment of a republican state in Europe, and the 'signs' of a messianic
Fitnih, should not be underestimated. Beyond the official chroniclers, perhaps
this is one of the earliest interpretations which were made of the political
developments in Europe. This deserves more attention, since such events were
treated with the familiar concepts of a traditional system of thought, rather
than being accepted or rejected in any subjective way as     was the case fo\
some thinkers in the late 19th century Iran.

However exciting this new awareness of the European developments may sound,
the popular messianism was still very much envisaged in terms of traditional

eschatology.     But some middle and low rank Mullas who conveyed the message to
the public also became in their own right conscious of a more realistic image
of the advent of the Imam.    Haji Mulla Iskandar, a preacher in Khuy, who was

known for his karamat, over a long period of time, drew the attention of his
audience to the plausible circumstances of the forthcoming Zuhur and the

eagerly anticipated imminent upheavals . Similarly, Haji Mulla Ou.i Akbar the

Shaykh al-Islam of Maraghih was also preoccupied with such expectations. Mu f in
al-Saltanih believes that some of the Babis from Maraghih such as Mulla Ahmad

being converted to the Babi movement .

If the origin of these ideas and inspirations was roughly foreshadowed in
the semi-rural Sufi asceticism in Azarbaijan, the preaching of Haji

Asadallah
Saysani had a more recognisable link with better known trends. Originally a
peasant from Saysan, a village near Tabriz (with possible Ahl-i Haqq background) ,

Asadallah spent two years in the company of the other local ascetics (ahl-i
tanassuk) in retirement and mystical mortifications on Mount Sahand . After
that in his wanderings around the country he came across Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i

(possibly in Kirmanshah, a centre of Ahl-i Haqq), and was deeply influenced by

his teachings.     On his return to Saysan, his preaching, mostly composed of
messianic admonitions, gained him popularity, sanctity and- respect amongst the

villagers .  Distinctively affected by the Shaykhi picture of the Imam,
Asadallah presented a more plausible and human image of the Qa'im and the advent
of the Final Day. The Qa'im would come to this world not by ascending from the
Eight Climate or the cities of Jabulqa and Jabarsa (which Shaykhis believed
were misunderstood by the fuqdha') , but by natural birth, and would live a life
like any other human being. Similarly to the author of Nuqtat al-Kaf, Asadallah
also emphasised that the Qa'im's appearance would inevitably entail his
suffering, hardship and subjugation (maqkuriyat) at the hand of his enemies.
The opposition of the ^ulama against the Qa'im, Asadallah declared, was the best
proof of his righteousness 3 . Their anti-clerical and sometimes anti-governmental
sentiments, non-orthodox image of Qa'im and the Qtyamat, and high popularity and
sanctity in the community are elements which distinguish characters such as
Asadallah Saysani as intermediaries, whose function was to popularise the
speculative messianic theories of 'high culture' for ordinary men. It is not
surprising to see that after his death in c-ii>ca 1258 (1842) , in the early stages
of the Babi movement, almost the entire village of Saysan embraced the new
'cause 1 , and in due time the village became one of the Babi-Baha'i centres in
Azarbaijan .

Babis of the future who were responsible for mobilising local communities under
the Babi banners, performed the same intermediary function. It is beyond the
capacity of this chapter to give a thorough study of these figures but something
at least should be said about each of them. They all shared similar character­
istics. They are all known for their anti-clerical and occasionally anti-
governmental feelings.  Also they have in common strong bonds with the communities
of adherents, skilful oratory, and above all association with certain trends of
non-orthodox thought either because of their family background or their training.

Shari^atmadar who during his tutelage, on Shaykh Ahmad's advice, retired

for forty days in the mosque of Kufah, was known to the Barfurushis for his
asceticism and his prognostications .    He was also admired for his unceremonious
and humble manners.   He spoke and preached in local Mazandarani dialect, and
often dressed like local shepherds.  He excited his audience from the pulpit by

stressing the speculative themes which were common amongst the Shaykhis . He
bitterly criticised the Usuli 'ulama, and most of all his rival Mulla Sa'id
Barfurushi , and he was seldom in good terms with the governors and local state

officials . The prolonged conflicts in Barfurush between Ni'mati and Haydari

quarters was largely expressed in this period in terms of Shaykhi-Usuli

dispute
between Shari'atmadar and Sa'id al-^Ulama*. The later development of this-
conflict, by the time of Mulla Muhammad ''Ali Barfurushi (Quddus) who himself at

one stage was a student of Shari''atmadar, turned to a full scale confrontation
between the Babis and their enemies in the city, and became one of the origins
of the Tabarsi

uprising in 1848-9. Earlier, even before the death of Sayyid
Kazim

Rashti, clear signs of messianic expectations may be found in the writings
of Quddus, particularly in connection with his theological argumentations with
SaTd al-fuiama' 5 . It appears that in the late 1250 T s and early 1260's (1841-8),
the leadership of the Shaykhi faction in the Ni^mati quarters of Barfurush was
gradually transferred from the old Shari'atmadar to a young and militant Quddus,
who in turn mobilised the inhabitants in the newly emerged Babi movement.

The same pattern may also be detected in the ideas and activities of Mulla

Muhammad ^Ali Hujjat Zanjani , who unlike the above examples, was influenced by

Akhbarism, at least in the matters of Shar 1 . He was the son of a local Zanjani
divine, who was known for his karamat.         For some years Hujjat

was educated in
the ^Atabat before moving to Hamadan, which in the early decades of the 19th
century survived as one of the Akhbari strongholds in Iran.         On his return to
Zanjan, after the death of his father, Hujjat enjoyed immense popularity in those

quarters of the city which had previously been loyal to his father.         The intro­
duction of a series of severe juristic prohibitions, which was inspired by Hujjat's

Akhbari views, together with some traces of extremism (ghul/uv) reflected in his
religious discourses, provided the necessary pretext for a clash with the rival
Usuli ^ulama in the city.   The extension of this conflict in the mid 1250 f s (late
1830*s) resulted in the intervention of the local and then central authorities,

_______                           3
which in accordance with Haji
Mirza Aqasi's religious policy   , summoned Hujjat

and kept him in exile in the capital.      After spending some time in Tehran, his
triumphal return to Zanjan increased his popularity, even to the extent of
zealous devotion, mostly at the expense of both Usuli ''ulama and the local
government .

In the following years, prior to his second exile to Tehran in 1847 (1263),
Hujjat

became increasingly preoccupied with the inevitability of a prophetic
revelation.    He was convinced that divine revelation would manifest itself in
the form of a human being with no physical or supernatural imparity.         In their
essence, his views on the appearance of the 'Promised One* did not comply with
the teachings of the Akhbaris who took the traditions at their face value.
Instead, his picture of the advent of the Qa'im, like that of some of the above
mentioned Shaykhis, was closer to reality.        However, the realistic prospects

for a Zuhur by no means reduced the intensity of the expectation of the Qa'im's
advent. The unreserved support offered by Hujjat in the early stages of the

movement following the Bab's proclamation, even though no meeting ever took
place between the two of them, indicates the enthusiasm and vigour with which
Hujjat anticipated a manifestation . His conversion was followed by that of a
large body of his adherents who according to one estimate, exceeded three
thousand 2 . They mainly consisted of middle and lower groups of the city
inhabitants and included merchants, petty merchants, traders, members of various
guilds, shopkeepers, lutis, religious students, and low ranking army personnel.

The revolutionary zeal of what by now had become the Babi faction, which had
once already expressed itself in the scandalous expulsion of the oppressive

.— siege (1266/
- - governor (1847/1263) 3 , reached its zenith during the Zanjan
Qajar
1850) when Hujjat and his followers put up a stiff resistance against the joint

forces of the government and the local lilama. The episode of Zanjan, one of
the most exciting chapters in the history of the Babi movement, fully
demonstrates a complete process of messianism; from expectations to revelation
and then to militancy, confrontation, defeat and submission.

Throughout Iran, other communities in Fars, Yazd and Khurasan were also
motivated by individuals who like the above examples, were inspired by the
messianic messages. The preparatory teachings of these figures are of prime
importance since not only were they vehicles for the adaptation of past ideas
and beliefs to the new circumstances, but to a large extent they prepared the way
for the interpretation of social and political realities of the time in a
messianic language which would be understandable to the ordinary public.

were others which, independently of the Babi development, though on a smaller
scale, proceeded from theoretical speculation to the stage of proclamation and
fulfilment of the prophecies.   The revival of the Isma Tlis in the 19th century,
for example, was a renewal of long forgotten aspirations in an area of Iran
which still preserved some aspects of Isma Tli millenarianism. These aspirations
might have been first inspired by similar developments in the communities of
Isma'Tlis in India.  Already in 1175/1762 amongst the Da'udi community in Gujarat
a certain Hibatallah ibn Isma Tl had claimed that he was in direct contact with
the Concealed Imam, and had been appointed by him to the rank of al-Hujjat al-

- -I                  - -                                          *
Ildhi . Amongst the Nizaris of eastern Iran, in the period under Abul Hasan Khan
(Shah), the Isma'Tli imam and the governor of Kirman between 1169-1206/1756-91,
the past connections between the Ni 'matallahis and Isma Tlis were further

strengthened . This must have had some effect on the messianic attitude of the
Isma Tlis since the next imam, Shah KhalTlallah son of Abul Hasan Shah, despite
some pure political amibitions which brought him close to the Qajars, appears to
have revived some of the Isma Tli messianic claims. His efforts at organising
the IsmaTli sympathisers in Yazd, Kirman and Quhistan came to an abrupt end,
when he was murdered in Yazd by an excited mob who were incited by a certain

_            _        o
mujtahid Mulla Husain Yazdi in 1817 . Not much is known about the nature of his

da^wa or the extent of his support, but from what is known about the Ni'matallahi
influence, as well as from the revolt of his son Aqa Khan Husain ^Ali Shah (1843-
4), one may suspect that at least in the early stages the messianic da^wa was
the mobilising force behind a movement which later turned into a political

revolt .

Whatever the motives of Khalilallah and Aqa Khan, their actions must have

planted some hopes in the hearts of some Isma ^Tli followers.        Qatil al-Karbala'i
states that though the Isma'ilis are a small and insignificant community who
'are mostly illiterate and ignorant', nevertheless they also anticipate a
manifestation among the descendants of Khalllallah .        He relates that once in
1258 (1842) he and his friends met in Najaf an Isma'Tli mystic and scholar of
high calibre, who prophesied the forthcoming downfall of the Qajars and the

- _   -2
transference of the monarchy to Aqa Khan .

But if the claims of Khalllallah hardly extended beyond the traditional
limits of the Isma^li Imamat, there were others who put forward more independent,
and at the same time less sophisticated claims.         A good example of this kind of
millenarianism, which often appears in the garb of rural sainthood, can be traced
in the communities of Ahl-i Haqq in Azarbaijan.         As early as 1191/1777, a

certain Qasim, a shepherd from the village of Dihkhariqan near Tabriz, following

- .              3

some experience and holy dreams, claimed to be the Deputy (Na*ib) of the Imam .
He immediately gained an immense popularity amongst the villagers in the area,
and after expelling the village's local mulla, became an unchallenged holy
'saint' in the whole area.     Pilgrims came to the village to visit Shaykh Shaban
and pay tribute to the new 'Deputy' who allegedly could cure the sick and give
sight to the blind. The increasing number of his followers gave him such
significance that Biglarbaygi Najaf Quli Khan Dunbuli (died 1199/1784) invited
him to visit the city. He was warmly received by the governor and the
inhabitants of Tabriz and was put up in the governor's private quarters. However,
he was again opposed by the (ulama of the city, who contrary to the Sufis,
denied his supernatural capacities. In response Shaykh Qasim's followers
attacked the chief faqih of the city, a certain Akhund Mulla Ibrahim, and forced

him to flee from Tabriz .

For some time, his popularity remained at its height. Because of a dream
in which he saw the Mahdi performing prayers in a certain mosque in Tabriz,
Najaf Quli Khan, who had a firm belief in him, or more probably was obliged to
comply with public demand, erected the Shrine known as Maqam-i Sahib al-Amr in
the ruins of an old mosque .       His fame even gave Karim Khan Zand a cause for

concern.     Yet after two years his fame and glory gradually faded away presumably
because his prophecies regarding the advent of the Qa'im did not come true.
Eight years later, when in 1199 (1784) ^Abd al-Razzaq Dunbuli met him in Tabriz,
he found      a wretched wanderer in the streets of Tabriz, who had lost all his
past reputation .        DunbulT points out that had it not been for his fervent
supporters who gathered around him, and publicised his claim amongst the ignorant
public, he might have never gained such a high position and instead would have
remained a simple shepherd in his own village.           Yet when he reached such a high
degree of popularity, ^Abd al-Razzaq concludes, his failure to revolt against
the authority of the state, which would have secured him the whole province of

— _                             2
Azarbaijan, brought about his decline .
The shrine of Sahib al-Amr however remained one of the sacred places in

Tabriz, and attracted pilgrims from all over Azarbaijan.            Throughout the 19th
century this shrine was always associated with the Shaykhi faction of the 'ulama
in Tabriz.  In 1848 (1264) following an alleged miracle, in which a cow fled
from the slaughter-house and took refuge in the Shrine, a riot broke out in the
city in which the Shaykhi Shaykh al-Islam of the city, Haji Mirza 'Ali Asghar

played the major part.           This riot, like many other sectarian conflicts in Tabriz,
should be seen in the light of a division of the quarters between the Shaykhi
and non-Shaykhi factions. With much difficulty, the central government finally
managed to reassert its control over Tabriz, and exile the Shaykh al-Islam and
his son to Tehran 3 ".

A similar example of agreement between 'heterodox' claimants and the local
governors may be seen in Kashan, this time directed against the authority of the
central government.          In 1261 Q. (1801-2), during the governorship of Husain Quli

Khan, a certain Muhammad Qasim Bayg, a dervish from the Biravand tribe (whom

the author of Rowdat al-Safa* believes to be the same person who earlier appeared

under the assumed name of Mulla Barani, and claimed to possess the secrets of
Alchemy and other 'hidden sciences 1 ), in collaboration with an unknown sayyid

from Kashan who claimed to be the Deputy of the Imam, encouraged Husain

Quli
Khan to rebel against his brother Fath (Ali Shah for the second time and seize
the throne . A brief success in capturing Natanz and then Isfahan soon turned

to defeat at the hand of the Qajar forces. Husain
.      Quli in company with Muhammad
Qasim, fled to Luristan where they might have hoped to receive some support from
Biravand and other affiliated tribes. Later on, however, because of disagreement
between the Lur chiefs, Husain Quli Khan fled to Qum and took refuge in the

' -                 -2
Shrine, whereas Muhammad  Qasim fled to Baghdad .

This was indeed not the only example of messianism with a tribal affiliation,
Besides the above mentioned Shah Khalilallah who was supported by the Isma^ili
tribe of  Ata'allahis in the vicinity of Kirman, other popular claimants also

emerged in eastern Iran, who led tribal resurgences against the Qajars. In 1222
(1807;8), a certain outcast Bukhara'i dervish known as Sufi Islam, who once had
been ejected by the Bakjan (amir) of Bukhara, managed to gain a wide acceptance
among the nomads of eastern Khurasan. It is claimed that he organised fifty
thousand horsemen from Afghan and Uymaqat, and then joined forces with the rebel
governor of Herat Firuz al-Din Mirza against the Qajar governor of Khurasan

- - -3
Muhammad Vali Mirza . In the course of a fatal battle, the Afghans suffered a

heavy defeat and Sufi Islam, who himself supervised his forces from a golden
houda (hudafi , and was guarded by 366 of his close companions, was killed .

A few years later, another Sufi figure appeared in Central Asia, who also
tried to unify the Turkoman nomads of the north-eastern frontiers against the
central government. Khvajih Yusuf Kashghari, a descendant of a family of Central
Asian Sufi amirs who for three generations had a secular and spiritual control
over Kashghar, after some years of wandering in Kurdistan, Egypt, Bombay and
Basrah, Shiraz and Tehran (which seems to have sharpened his militant attitude)
finally went amongst the Turkomans in Gurgan, and tried to organise various
sub-branches of Kuklan and Yamut under a united leadership . Earlier skirmishes
with local government forces eventually ended in 1228 (1813) in a full scale
battle in which, in spite of early success, Khvajih Yusuf was finally killed, and
the Turkoman forces of twenty thousand strong were defeated .       Besides Sufi

What is clear, however, is that both figures tried, though with not much success,
to exploit the potentials of tribal mobility, as well as their possible Sufi
affiliations, to create an independent power in the existing vacuum between a
declining central government and the semi-autonomous    centres in the periphery.
In both cases they failed, not because of the superiority of the Qajar forces,
but because of the fragile unity within the tribal ranks.

It is important to notice that these tribal resurgences were rooted in the
rural and semi-tribal heterodox traditions which in the past had inspired many
important messianic movements. Even as late as 1891, the revolt of a man of
Kurdish origin, Sayyid Husain Kalardashti ('Alamgir), who claimed to be the

deputy of the Imam, was just another outburst of the semi-tribal messianism of
the Kurdish Ahl-i Haqq community in Mazandaran . One might suggest that Ahl-i

Haqq's influence in western Iran, and to a lesser extent Naqshbandi's influence

on the eastern borders, kept the spirit of messianism alive in the rural and
tribal communities, in much the same way as other urban trends such as later
Akhbaris and the Sufis did in the cities.

Only a few cases of claimants with open messianic messages could however
be found in non-Sufi circles.  One example is an anonymous Persian-speaking
mulla from the Shi'i community in Georgia (Gurjistan), who in the late 1830's,
gained a widespread popularity in the whole area even as far as Azarbaijan. His
'pretentions', as it is reported by an English observer, were 'very humble 1 and
confined to a restoration of 'the ancient purity', or opposition to 'the vices

of the people, and the unfaithfulness of the priests' . The twenty thousand
armed men who reportedly gathered round him, worried the Russians, who saw in
his claims the possible insurrection of the Moslem population against the Russian
aggression. 'The corruption which had fallen' on the Religion (i.e. Islam), as
preached by this claimant, could have been a dangerous allusion to the subjection
of the Moslems by the Russian 'infidels'; a humiliation which had already
motivated the second round of Russo - Persian wars.    In spite therefore of the
will of his 'enraged followers', who were prepared to resist, he was escorted to

Tiflis, where he appeared to have spent some time in captivity .      As is
characteristic of most other messianic trends (like Shaykh Shaban), his claims
were exaggerated by his eager believers, who appear to have attributed to him
far greater claims than what he originally intended.      Though 'he declared that
he had no power to work miracles', the enthusiastic public in the neighbouring
Tabriz and Urumiyih, not only ascribed to him various miracles and feats, but
even received his Persian 'Book', a combination of 'hyperbole and moral

disquisitions', as a sign that 'he might after all be the expected Imam' .

Another interesting case is that of a certain anonymous ascetic in Karbila*
who has been mentioned by Haji Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmani as an example of a

' 3

similar 'imposter' prior to the Bab . He was an ascetic recluse among    Sayyid
Kazim's students who seems to have enjoyed the wide popularity in the

circle.    As Kirmani describes him, he was a knowledgeable scholar, who could
resolve other students' problems.    His reputation for piety was such that he
led the Shaykhis in their prayers.    But because of his unusual mortifications
and isolation, he 'had been possessed by the devil'. Thus he put forward
'blasphemous claims' which were 'beyond human capacity'. As a result, he was
disowned by Sayyid Kazim, who according to Karim Khan, publicly expelled him

4     '--.--
from his circle . Karim Khan Kirmani also vaguely refers to two other claimants
who seem  to have appeared in the last years of Sayyid Kazim.  One person used

to send to Sayyid Kazim, 'tablets' of incomprehensible words, presumably calling

upon Rashti to recognise his claims. There was also a certain Mulla Sadiq in

Azarbaijan, who apparently with some inspiration from Shaykhi teachings on the
emergence of the 'Renovator' (muravvij) of the thirteenth century, promised the
advent of Zuhur, and managed to secure a large following in the area . To these

claimants, showing Shaykhi influence, may also be added Mulla Muhammad Tahir

Hakkak Khurasani, who towards the end of the 19th century, claimed to have a

divine mission for reforming the world and unifying divided mankind in one
universal community.  It is said that in his youth he was a student of Sayyid
Kazim Rashti but nevertheless it was in the closing years of the century that he

expounded his ideas in his work Nasihat at-^Alam which was a combination of
religious moral recommendations and Sufi popular beliefs .      Finally Haji Muhammad

Karim Khan's own claim, that he had reached the position of the 'Fourth Pillar'
(Rukn-i Rab-i^ y should also be taken as a non-orthodox if not messianic claim.
However, as time passed, in the decades following the emergence of the Babi
movement, the interpretation of the position of the 'Fourth Pillar' in Kirmani's
works underwent a drastic change, mainly to fit within the boundaries of Shi^i
orthodoxy, and thus secure the claimant from charges of blasphemy .

From what has been discussed in this chapter, it may be concluded that in
the period under study, the process of popular millenarianism was mainly expressed
in three traditional forms of Sufi and non-Sufi asceticism, popular divination
and prophetic proclamations.      The formal Shi ^i traditions aside, these trends
were often used as vehicles for conveying complex and heterogeneous messages,
which survived over centuries in an imperceptible network of oral and written
traditions.      The imperishable desire for a 'saviour', and for fulfilling
apocalpytic events, time and again reappeared in manifestations, which in their
apparent form were not far different from those in the past; either by the way
of direct continuation, or by inconspicuous influence from diffused traditions.
However, in rekindling the messianic zeal, the chain effects of other
contemporary ideas should not be neglected.      The image of the Qa'im, the focal
point of almost all prophecies in this period, as 'the one who is supported by
the Truth', and thus will 'fill the world with justice in the same way that it
had been filled with inequity', remained largely unchanged.      So did the image
of the precursor or 'Deputy 1 who whould proceed the advent of the Imam.
Significantly, none of the claimants openly assumed the position of Mahdaviyat,
or Qa'imiyat.  Instead, in all the proto-messianic 'revelations', the claimants
were content to regard themselves as agents, representatives, or mere contacts
of the Concealed Imam. Neither the theoretical framework, nor the attitude of
the public, even amongst the most eager millenarians, allowed the full scale
ZuhuT under the name of the Qa'im.

Thus in the interim period, prior to the appearance of the Mahdi, the real
message of the claimants consisted not only of 'warnings' and 'admonitions', but
of allusions to the 'secrets' which were yet to be revealed fully at the time
of Zuhur.      They were 'assigned' to render some hidden aspects of a 'true order'

and a 'pure religion' of which they believed the dogmatic 'literalists' tend to
see only the facade.      The 'superficial' relationship governing this external

1\.       Amongst other works on this subject, his Rukn-i Rabi ( (Kinnln, 1368 Q.)

> presents a conservative interpretation of the concept of the 'Fourth Pillar'.
See for further details below Chapter Four, I.

system was either criticised by the claimants, or else accepted in part, only
when a prior understanding was reached about its symbolic value. In other words,
the traditional messianism, if not yet in revolt against the current norms, at
least urged substantial revisions in practices, which it held to have been
exploited both by religious and secular authorities.

What gave the emergence of these ideas a distinctive character were the
circumstances under which they were born and bred. The growth of these ideas
and movements, which was further accelerated by the sense of urgency in their
message, and by recruitment from the ordinary people, inevitably disturbed the
tranquillity of a traditional balance in society, and brought the claimants into
collision with the forces of opposition. A constant oscillation between security
and instability in the 'town' and 'countryside' always provided a fertile ground
for millenarianism. Regardless of their short term effects, the events of the
late 18th and early 19th centuries, which eventually established the Qajars
throughout Iran, encouraged this process, both on the theoretical and practical
level. Throughout the reign of Path• ^Ali Shah and Muhammad

Shah, a limited
degree of internal security made possible the revival of religious and academic
activities. On the other hand, a constant political conflict, and threats of
outside forces, led some mystics and prognosticators such as Rustam al-Hukama*

to try to explain the situation in terms of messianic events.

Preoccupation with 'orthodoxy', more than any other factor, exhausted the
forces of millenarianism.    In confrontation with the 'ulama, the messianic trends
were either totally crushed and annihilated, or else reduced to harmless semi-
cryptic sections which were unable to cause any serious threat to the dominant
'orthodoxy'.  In some instances the ^llama's hostile response led some Sufis,
such as the Ni'matallahis or popular claimants such as Shaykh Shaban to appeal
for the support of the secular authorities.    Yet the alliance between the state
and heterodox claimants could seldom last long.    Either the claimant would lose
his millenarian zeal in earnest (and with it his messianic following), and serve
the secular power as propagandist of political legitimacy, or the irrational,
unworldly aspects of the movement would be so strong as to make any compromise
with the state impossible.   The prolonged conflict between the state and the
fulama, as two sources of control over the community, encouraged the public to
search for a third alternative which could express their grievances. In spite
of their deficiencies, the millenarian trends expressed this voice of protest
and public discontent against the authorities.    Regardless of the fact that an
outdated message, insufficient means and methods of preaching, the limited span
of geographical diffusion, and a weak theoretical foundation, eventually caused

the decline of most of them, their very continuation throughout the period was
an indication of a strong drive in some sections of the society to create a more
consistent response.

The emergence of the Shaykhi doctrine, which in its essence was a fusion of
various trends of esotericism, asceticism and popular beliefs, contributed both
in theory and in practice to the development of a new approach. The Shaykhi
school provided more favourable circumstances for the emergence of the Qa'im,
not only by rescuing him from the web of Shi^i traditions, which prevented his
presence in any historical circumstances, but also by depicting a tangible human
face for the 'saviour', whose extraordinary qualities lay in his moral and
spiritual merits rather than in his super-physical and supernatural capabilities.

In view of Shaykhism, the revelation of the Imam would be the inevitable
consequence of the 'maturing' of man's intellectual evolution in the course of
history, rather than a supernatural punishment which would be inflicted upon
mankind from the world above. His appearance would not bring an immediate
victory over the forces of falsehood, but only begin a long and painful Fi-tnih
in the course of which many of the opponents as well as his supporters, would
be destroyed. It was this 'realistic' concept of Resurrection and the Return
which was essential in providing a coherent sense of expectation amongst the
close followers of the Shaykhi leaders, as amongst other individuals or
communities who shared a similar opinion. This was the first step in the
direction of a more comprehensive'revelation*.

CHAPTER THREE

Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad Shirazi,      the Bab: the early years

Our chief motive for the study of the early life of the Bab, which is the
subject of this chapter, is to examine various aspects of his background, his
upbringing, his material life and his intellectual experiences, which appear
to have contributed to the development of his complex personality; first as a
pious merchant, then as a vigorous ascetic, and finally as an inspired
precursor who claimed to be chosen for the delivery of a long awaited mission.
Some general themes which were related to the emergence of the Babi movement
in a broader sense, were discussed in previous chapters and will be discussed
further in the following chapters. What particularly interests us at this
stage is to see what special merits Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad Shirazi, rather than

any other individual, possessed which caused him to be regarded by himself and
his followers as qualified, to put forward unorthodox claims, and more
important, to be accepted by a large group of followers.

Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad, later known as the Bab, was born in 1235 Q. (1819)

1                                               .-2
in Shiraz . He was the only child of Sayyid Muhammad   Riza , a small merchant

in the Bazar of Shiraz. His family were originally from Shiraz, and it appears
that they lived in the city for generations. Though Mirza Ahmad    Shirazi Ishik-

aqasi, one of the closest sources to the Bab's family, believes that the Bab's
forefathers belonged to the sayyids of Herat (Harat), and even maintains that

Sayyid Muhammad Riza himself emigrated from Herat and settled in Shiraz ,
nonetheless the accuracy of this remark, which is not helped by the ambiguous
style of the text, is open to question. It is true that Mirza Ahmad

and his
family 'maintained an intimate relation' with the family of the Bab, and it is
also true that the title Afir, which is used by some sources instead of 'sayyid*
for the Bab and his forbears, sometimes refers to ShiCi sayyids of Herati
origin, and that in the early decades of the nineteenth century they not
infrequently immigrated to towns and cities of Iran, but still the Herati
origin of the Bab is not confirmed by any other source. On the contrary the

1\.   In al-SahZfa Bayn al-HaramOyn the Bab specifies the date of his birth
as first Muharram 1235' Q. (20 October 1819). (Brcwne Or. MSS F(9)).

2\.   Born circa 1195 Q. (1780).      3.      Ahnad- 446.

available evidence on the background of the Bab suggests the opposite .

As far as the genealogy of the Bab can be traced, it appears that up to
the sixth generation his paternal ancestors were all sayyids coming from Shiraz,
and his great grandfather in the sixth generation was a certain Mfr Muhammad

T   .   r   T - r2
Mumin Husaini Najafi Shirazi . It is difficult to reconcile these two contra-

dictory opinions unless one assumes that Sayyid Muhammad Riza, or his

ascendents, immigrated to Herat at some stage, and then returned to their home
town. His mother Fatimih/B

aygum, who had a strong influence on the early life
of the Bab,     also descended from a relatively well known family of sayyids
of Shiraz. Her brothers, and most of her paternal relatives, one of whose
daughters later married Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad, were traditionally engaged in

large scale trade. As the Fora Nonrih confirms, they were counted amongst the

3                                — -
old and reputable merchants of Shiraz . Though in the Bab's family, siyodat
did not indicate any specific religious or clerical advantage above that of
other sadat families in the city, yet it greatly contributed to the high esteem
and veneration which they enjoyed in Shiraz. The claim to an impeccable siyadat ,
in the later years, assisted the Bab and his followers, as a major proof in
the justification of his holy descendancy.

Some sources such as Tar-Ekh-i AmrZ-yi Sh-Zraz or Tarikh-i Mu ^n al-Saltanih
imply that Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad's

family on his father's side were also involved
in large scale trade, but it appears that as far as Sayyid Muhammad Riza was

concerned, he was more of a local merchant than a big merchant like his brother-

in-laws.   This is evident from a remark made by the Bab's wife Khadijih Khanum
who says that her father-in-law was 'engaged in retail trade 1 (tijarat-i j
This is also confirmed by other sources such as Mirza Ahmad and Sipihr who

state that the Bab's father 'carried on a clothier's business (bazzaz-l") in the

bazar of Shiraz' . Hence Sayyid Muhammad

Riza should not be regarded as an
exceptionally prosperous trader. Yet he inherited a small house in the quarter

of Bazar-i Murgh , and a shop in Sara-yi Rugharii at the entrance of the Bazar-i
Vakil , married into a family of big merchants, and left enough savings to
support his wife and his son when he died prematurely at the age of forty nine,
possibly in one of the outbreaks of cholera in Fars (circa 1243 Q./1826-7) .
The shop owned by his father contained a family business which could be traced
back to the Zand period and beyond .

Indeed, the pattern of the Bab's immediate family suggests a social
position which emerged as a hybrid between the lower-middle stratum of
traditional bazari retail traders with strong religious ties, and the well
established prosperous families of big merchants (tujjor} in the city - a union
which not infrequently allows the lower stratum to benefit from social and
economic advantages, and thus ascend the social ladder, often, in the next
generation. The Bab's childhood, his education and his later engagement in
trade, is a clear example of such a union that benefited from the norms and

values of both traditions.

Perhaps an indication of the Bab's family status, is the quarter in which
he and his family resided.   His father's house on the street of Shamshirgarha
was located in Bazar-i Murgh quarter, whereas his maternal uncle's house was
situated in the neighbouring Darb-i Shahzadih quarter.          These two Haydari

quarters encapsuled the whole of the bazar complex, as well as some of the
most important shrines and mosques in the city.       Bazar-i Murgh located in the
centre and on the border line between the rival Haydaris and Ni'matis in a city
dominated by internal factions, housed most of the commercial premises and the
dwellings of the middle and lower merchant classes and their associates.
Though probably the most important economic and religious quarter in the city,
Bazar-i Murgh was susceptible to pressures exerted from rival poles of power.
Frequently the inhabitants witnessed their quarter being turned into a battle
ground of the rival forces, their prime objective being the control of the
bazar.   One may assume that the loyalty of the inhabitants of Bazar-i Murgh
primarily laid in their group interest rather than any factional affiliation .
Little is known about Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad's childhood apart from

anecdotes which were directly aimed and especially related to illustrate the
'extraordinary 1 aspects of the Bab's character. Like most children coming
from a family of urban 'middle class', Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad was sent to the

—   — 9     *
nearby maktab of a certain Shaykh Zayn al-^Abidin         in Tikkiyih of Qahvih-yi
Auliya in the same quarter of Bazar-i Murgh, where he received some elementary
tuition. Mirza Habiballah takes particular care to say that, according to his

source, a certain Mulla Fathallah Khadim, who was in the same maktab as the

Bab, this school was exclusively for the children of 'tujjar, notables and
dignitaries', since Shaykh ^Abid 'never admitted anybody's child, especially
those of shopkeepers of bazar, because of their ill behaviour and their filthy
clothes' 3 . However there are reasons to doubt the accuracy of this remark.
Binning, the English traveller who visited Shiraz in 1850 states that elementary
schools 'are very numerous' but 'the children of the wealthy are generally
educated at home, by a tutor 1 . An example of this private tuition is Mirza

Hasan Shlrazi (born 1230 Q./1814-15), a distant cousin of the Bab, and future
marja^-i- taqlid of the late nineteenth century who first started his
elementary schooling at the age of four at home . Whether Sayyid Ali
Muhammad was less privileged than his cousin, or whether there was any other

reason, he was sent to the local maktabkhanih, which contrary to what is
quoted, seems to have been for the children of a humble background as well
as for those of the more affluent families.
As for Shaykhi Mu allim, he appears to have received attention and

—                \ f        \
respect greater than was given to a simple maktabdar. As his title Mu'allim
implies, being a mulla of middle status, he taught religious texts to pupils at
a higher level, and as is confirmed by one source, to young talabihs of

/%

elementary level . His acquaintance with Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad's

father and
his uncle Haji

Sayyid ^Ali was not only due to their residence in the same
quarter, or the occasional recitation of theQur'an in the house of the uncles
of the Bab, but more particularly because Shaykh ^Abid, like many similar

o
middle rank mullas   and mu^allims, was a follower of the Shaykhi school   , and
thus in conformity with relatives of the Bab who also seem to have been
followers of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i . Though the commitment of the Bab's relatives
to the Shaykhi school is not directly mentioned in any of the sources, many
indications suggest that at least they had a strong sympathy towards the
Shaykhi leaders and maintained constant contacts with the Shaykhi followers .
His school was situated in a relatively new and unknown tikkiyih (Qahvih-yi
Auliya), which like many other Sufi gathering places in the city, was originally
the tomb of certain Sufis. It is probable that even at the time of the Bab, it

was used by dervishes for their nightly prayers and solitary retirements .

The Bab's formal education, both in his childhood and his adolescence,
was always a point of disagreement between the chroniclers and apologists, since
it formed part of a greater controversy to prove or to reject one of the
essential grounds for allowing his claims; namely his 'unlearned knowledge 1
((-ilm-i ladurmi) .   Perhaps it is useful to pay attention to some details, which
may at first glance seem unimportant or indeed irrelevant, but can in fact give
a better picture of the Bab and his somewhat misunderstood character. It is
fairly clear that during his years of pupillage in the maktab between the age of
five and ten, he had hardly received a solid and regular education, even by
comparison with the standard of his own classmates. However as far as the
accounts in the existing sources imply, he enjoyed an unusual level of
intelligence and perception 2 . The brief remark
"       -
in Nastkh        — —

al-Tawar'ikh that in
his early years he studied subjects in Persian and some elementary Arabic* 3 ,
gives some indication of his training, whereas samples of his handwriting, and
his exceptional enthusiasm for calligraphy, show some of his early interests .
On the other hand his irregular presence in the school, and complaints by his
teacher of his preoccupation with his own imaginary world suggest that he could
not effectively cope with a school system which is often described as cruel,
archaic and monotonous. Signs of his hatred for school atmosphere are
particularly reflected in his later remarks on corporal punishment, where in
the Arabic Bayan he calls upon a certain Muhammad Mu^allim, an unknown teacher

of his, not to flog (or bastinado) his students more than a limited number of
lashes , and in the Persian Bayan he even specifies the limit: 'It is forbidden
to all to discipline children, even verbally, or cause any grief to them before
the age of five, and (even) after reaching that age, punishment should not
exceed more than five light lashes and not even on bare flesh' . This no doubt

is a sign of the Bab's personal experience of the rough treatment which children
received in the traditional school system.

In his spare hours, even in his father T s lifetime, when he was only a boy
of eight or nine years, like many children of his age and background, he spent
part of his time in his father's shop . 'On his father's death 1 as Mirza Ahmad
states, 'his maternal uncles undertook his education, especially Haji Mirza

n
Sayyid ^Ali, who was reputed to be the most sympathetic of the brothers' . The
care and attention given by Mirza Sayyid (All was not confined to his education,
or investing in trade the capital left by his brother-in-law to support the
orphan 3 , but extended to a deep sympathy towards his somewhat unusual nephew.
Indeed he was later to play a significant role in the development of the Bab's
early claims and to take an important part in the events of the first two years
of the Bab's residence in Shiraz after his declaration. But nevertheless, it
appears that with the death of his father, the time spent in the bazar occupied
most of Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad's hours, as he continued to work there, now in the
office of his uncles . Whether this was because of the Bab's own disinclination
to continue school,    his poor record in the maktab,     lack of financial
support, or more probably, the concern of his uncles with his future as a
merchant rather than anything else, the question of his future studies was
neglected and gradually set aside. While one account states that Sayyid ^Ali
Muhammad's own lack of enthusiasm for formal school teaching finally forced
Shaykh ^Abid to send him back to his mother complaining of his strange remarks
which were, he thought, beyond the capacity of an ordinary child , another
account insists that when Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad was taken out of school in order
to work full time in the bazar, the same Shaykh ^Abid remarked that 'if the
father of this child were alive, he would never have let his son be deprived
from learning, and instead be engaged in trade 1 .

Whatever the reasons might have been, one may conclude that the inconsistent
and disrupted education of Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad was not only due to his early
orphanage, or his unsuitable schooling, but was more because of the fact that

the whole system was designed to prevent the development of an imaginative and
unusually talented mind in a direction different to the accepted norms and
standards of the society.  This, no doubt, was an important element in the
Bab's later inclination towards discoveries in the unconventional fields of
imagination and spiritual experience.

An interesting account given by Mulla ^Abd al-Rahim Qazvini suggests that
after a few years, when Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad was about fifteen years old (cirea

1835) his uncle arranged for him to resume his studies under Mulla ^Abd al-Khaliq
Yazdi (then the imam of jima^at in Shiraz and a student of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i)

but he lacked the basic knowledge essential for any further religious studies;

> 'In Mashad, I visited Akhund Mulla ''Abd al-Khaliq Yazdi who was
> one of the eminent ^ulama and a follower of Shaykh (Ahmad Ahsa'i).
> On one occasion, when a remark was made about His holiness (i.e.

The same indication is also given by Mulla Muhammad Hamza' Shari^atmadar

Barfurushi who with regard to the Bab's later attempts to restart religious
studies, states that he did not study elementary texts (rrruqaddamat) beyond

rt

Suyuti. and Hashiya of Mulla ^Abdallah . It seems however, that neither the
study of Arabic grammar, nor logic or other of the elementaries attracted the
Bab, since in Bayan on two occasions, he bans the believers of the excessive

study of grammar (sarf
va naho)
But nonetheless, in spite of his distaste for the conventional religious

education, and perhaps as a result of that, he developed sane interest in the
then less common subjects such as mathematics and astrology .     This attention
towards subjects which in spite of their rich background in Islamic tradition,
were overshadowed in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries by more
formal and orthodox theological subjects, can be explained by the survival of
such themes, sometimes in the garb of T popular' or 'hidden 1 sciences, encouraged
through the works of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i and some of his contemporaries.     What

made the Bab to escape learning of 'rmqaddamat 1 , and instead enjoy the more
amusing, and certainly more mysterious field of 'hidden sciences', seems to
have been his desire to achieve perfection by abandoning the traditional methods
by which subjects were taught in the nineteenth century schools.

Despite his usual bias and hostility towards Persian institutions Binning
is not unperceptive when he observes, about a decade later, that the ten
madrasihs of Da? al-^Ilm of Shiraz, either because of lack of funds, or because
of 'the general decline in the standard of scholarship were sunk into the
condition of mere schools where little is taught, except simple elementary
instructions' 2 . He adds that:

> languages, the Koran and commentaries upon it, theology, law, moral

It is precisely this 'dry study of the Arabic language' and its complicated
grammar, partly the result of an excessive scrutiny of the details of usul-i.
fiqh t that the Bab never could, or in fact desired, to master.    Years later,
when his claims were published, his lack of sufficient knowledge of     Arabic,
in which he wrote some of his works, was constantly attacked by his critics.

1\.   Aimed. 447.                    2.   Op.cit., I, pp.282-3.
3\.   Ibid. The author also maintains that the study of astronomy has

Whether in his trial at Tabriz in 1848, or in interviews between his disciples
and their adversaries, or in refutations written by his opponents, there are
numerous references to his 'weakness' in Arabic and other elementaries .
Though this is regarded by his critics as a great handicap totally improper
to his claims and constant reminder of his poor educational background, it was
considered by him as a divine merit demonstrating his 'intuitive knowledge';

> 'The fact that on some occasions words were altered or words
> uttered contrary to the rules of the people of doubt (gftl-i,

> (Therefore) he justifies (lit. refers) these innovative alterations
> and what is contrary to rules, with the divine rules, as_ the same
> matter frequently occurred in the Book of God (ire. Qur'aty . . . ? 2 4

The same theme was also expressed in another of his     Arabic tablets
addressed to a divine, this time with more emphasis on his lack of school
education:

> 'I swear on my own soul that I did not read a word of the conventional
> sciences (fiZtf? al-(aycai) t and I do not know a word of the rules of

> Today if someone asks me of various scholarly matters cited in books,

> the grammar and syntax (al-^arf va al-ndhw) 9 and I am proud of it,
> since God in the day of Q-iyama will prove to all that I was assisted
> by his generosity ...'3.

But emphasis on his lack of formal education and his ignorance of the
'conventional sciences' which is also confirmed by other sources, by no means
implies that caning fran a merchant family, he was solely engaged in commercial
activities; for even from his early days, he regarded his trade as secondary
matter compared to his vigorous search for moral and spiritual perfection.
As far as his family is concerned, as was not uncommon amongst members of the
merchant class, their traditional esteem for moral values; piety, godliness
and honesty, seems to have developed into a noticeable interest in- learning
and scholarship.   Contrary to Sayyid fAli Muhammad's antipathy for conventional

In order to examine more closely the intellectual background of the Bab
it is worth investigating the careers of some other members of his family.
Haji Sayyid Javad Shirazi (Kirmani), a distant cousin of the Bab, whose father
was also a merchant in Shiraz, after obtaining his ijazih in ^Atabat, and then
spending seme time in the religious circles of Mecca and Medina, had returned
to Shiraz around the mid 1240's (1820's), where he held lectures on theology
and mysticism.     Later, he was invited to Kirman(circa 1248/1832-3) and by the
order of Fath ''All Shah he settled there.        A few years later in 1253 Q. (1837-

8) he assumed the office of imam jum^ih of Kirman, which he held till the end
of his life (1287/1870-1).     He was a moderately orthodox divine with mystical
tendencies, whose lectures on the Masnavi of Rumi, something unusual for a
Shi^i mujtahid, attracted students from other places to Kirman, including the
celebrated philosopher Haji Mulla Hadi Sabzivari .        He was also the chief

rival of Haji Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmani, and therefore friend of his enemies.

His tendencies towards hiknat, and his previous acquaintance with Rashtl's
students in (Atabat, gave him the opportunity to behave favourably towards the
Babis in 1261-2 (1845-6).     In spite of Muhammad Karim Khan's fierce denunciation

of the Babi emissaries, on a few occasions he saved the Babis against the attacks
of the mob .

What is of particular interest as regards the family of the Bab, is the
continuing movement which took place amongst those frcm mercantile background
to a life of religious scholarship.    A later and much better known example of
the relatives of the Bab who moved to religious studies is Haji Sayyid Muhammad
Shirazi known as Mirza-yi Shirazi or Mujaddid-i Shirazi, the celebrated
mujtahid and marja^-i taql'ld of the late nineteenth century, who is particularly
known because of his role in the Tobacco Protest of 1891-2.           His father Mirza
Muhammad Husain Shirazi, a cousin of Sayyid Muhammad Riza    (the Bab's father),

•       .                                    .

was a distinguished calligrapher, who in spite of his mercantile background and
some participation in trade and land-owning, was himself a tutor in Shiraz .

Mirza Hasan was born in 1230 Q. (1815-16) five years earlier than Sayyid
Muhammad, and was brought up in Shiraz where he began his elementary studies.

At an early age he completed his studies in basic Persian, Arabic, fiqh and
usul before moving to Isfahan as a young talabih of eighteen where he acquired
his ijazih from Haji Mulla Ibrahim Karbasi . Being a talented student he soon

»
passed all the conventional stages in advanced religious education. He moved
to I'Atabat in the mid 1840's, and there, after a long period of study under

Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi and then Shaykh Murtaza Ansari, he reached the

stage of A f lamlyat. He settled in Samirra and later emerged as marja f, and
finally died there in 1312 Q. (1894/5) 3 .

These two examples of highly esteemed mujtahids on the paternal side of
Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad's

family and their educational background,reflects a
noticeable drift towards religious studies, at their most conventional. But
there are other examples amongst the relatives of the Bab on the maternal side,
who although had enjoyed the same educational background in its early stages,
showed a less orthodox approach to the religious and intellectual questions of
their own time. Mirza Sayyid Hasan

Shirazi, son of Mirza Sayyid ''Ali Tajir,
(later known as Afnan-i Kabir), a brother-in-law of the Bab (born in circa
1225/1810-11) was basically a merchant with a wide interest in sciences and
theology. He was an amateur scholar (mutifannin) , who had spent part of his
early life as a religious student in Shiraz and then in Isfahan in the company
of the above mentioned Mirza Hasan Shirazi around the early 1260's . Though
by profession he was a merchant, throughout his life he maintained a serious

interest in various fields of science.     It is stated that beside his interest
for 'complicated problems of theology,     he was skilful in material sciences
such as mathematics, geometry and geography, and thus (not only) was he an
expert in various practical sciences (funun-i shata) , but he also had a
perfect knowledge of thoughts in the past and present. During the day he spent
a few hours in his business but most of his time was spent on reading and
discussion 1 . While still a talabih in Isfahan, he specialised in usul-i fiqh,

- -    - -     '- -2

and according to one source, was even authorised by Haji Ibrahim Karbasi . In
a letter to Mirza Sayyid Hasan, the Bab refers to a recent work on usul which
was produced by the former. He condemns the study of usul and urges his brother-
in-law to abandon these useless speculations 3 . Even before the Bab's marriage,
Sayyid Hasan

was in close contact with the Bab's immediate family. In fact by
the death of Sayyid Hasan 1 s father, like Sayyid ''All Muhammad's, the guardian-
ship of his family was entrusted to the Bab's eldest uncle . Perhaps it is
not a coincidence that both Sayyid ''All Muhammad
.     and Mirza Sayyid Hasan

.     (in a
similar circumstance under the same guardianship), developed a certain interest
in subjects such as mathematics and astrology. In the following years
enthusiasm for astrology in Mirza Sayyid Hasan

led him to the study of western
astronomy, nightly observations, and even building a private observatory in
his house in Yazd .

A reference should also be made to another brother-in-law of the Bab;
Haji Muhammad
Mahdi Hijab

Shirazi . Coming from the same mercantile background,
he also benefited from a similar education in literature, Arabic, logic and
hikmat and later developed some interest in poetry and mysticism. After
finishing his elementary studies, 'he moved to India for commercial purposes
and resided for a long time in Bombay, where he managed to accumulate some

capital.   Then returning to his homeland, he abandoned his trade and became
acquainted with the followers of perfection and masters of ecstasy' . Though
nothing is known of his Sufi affiliation, his general tendency towards
mysticism, and his poetical talent, made him a relatively well known figure in
Shiraz in his own time .

The above examples suggest three common characteristics: first, that in
the family of Sayyid All Muhammad,
t

as a typical merchant family in the middle
decades of the 19th century, some distinct religious and intellectual tendencies
which sometimes went beyond the usual boundaries of the merchant class, can be
traced. Secondly, that these tendencies manifested themselves in various forms.
It allowed a humble talabih like Mirza Hasan  Shirazi or Sayyid Javad Shirazi,

both from non clerical backgrounds, to reach high positions in religious rank,
or certain merchants such as Mirza Sayyid Hasan  Afnan Kabir or Hijab Shirazi

to develop part time interests in less orthodox fields of mysticism, or the
applied sciences . Thirdly, it is important to notice that they all had a
similar introductory education, and to various degrees benefited from the
'scholastic 1 teachings of their own time.

It is against this background that the intellectual upbringing of Sayyid
'Ali Muhammad

should be examined. As far as the early education of the Bab is
concerned, this was his major difference with his contemporaries. He largely
lacked, and in later years deliberately shunned, school education. Still, as
will be discussed in the next sections, the same enthusiasm and vigour which
led the above pe-rsons to various intellectual pursuits, in the Bab developed
to a different, but not wholly unprecedented search for spiritual perfection.
For Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad, his disillusion with school, when combined with a

need 'for earning his livelihood' , left no other choice but to become an
assistant to his uncles in their trade in the port of Bushihr. As he himself
mentioned in the 'Letter to the f ulama'; 'When this youth reached the age of
compulsory learning, in the tradition of the Prophet of God in the past, he
arrived in Jazirat al-Bahr (i.e. Bushihr). He did not study your scientific
methods with any of you (i.e. with the ^ulama) and thus in the preserved
tablet of the divine order, he is an uneducated (wmrL) , ''Ajami and descendent

of the Prophet of God'

II

Throughout his five years residence in Bushihr (1835-40/1250-6) sometimes
in the company of one of his uncles, and most of the time in their absence,
Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad

participated mainly in the family business as a
commercial agent. However as time passed it appears that he managed to become

a partner, and even carry on some independent trade . Some observations of
his commercial activities in this period,     a brief survey of the general
pattern of the family trade, and also some observations on the moral aspects
of the merchant's social behaviour, would lead to a better understanding of
the later changes in the ideas and attitudes of the Bab.

The trade of the Bab's uncles throughout the middle decades of the nine­
teenth century was based on the general pattern of the southern trade in this

period . They should be counted among the big merchants (tujjar) of Southern
Iran who were based in Shiraz and Yazd and carried import-exports from Bushihr
and Bandar   ^Abbas to the Indian ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, as to
other ports of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea such as Muscat, Bahrain and as
far as Zanzibar and Java. i The trade accounts (siyaq) of Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad
between 1250-56 (1835-40) show that their trade with the interior of Iran

reached the main markets of southern and central Iran.   References to
transactions with the local merchants in Isfahan, Kashan and Tehran, mainly
concern agricultural and food exports in exchange for imports of fabrics, tea,
sugar and spices. These documents also confirm that the Bab had acquired the
necessary skill for keeping accurate accounts and handling commercial orders.

The commercial background on both the paternal and maternal side of the
Bab's family no doubt helped him in finding his way in the mercantile community
of Bushihr. Mir Isma ll, the Bab's paternal grandfather, himself sometime
during Sayyid ' All Muhammad's childhood lived in Bushihr,     had trade links
with his uncles 1 . The extent of the family business sometimes even stretched
to those members who were not directly involved in trade. The above-mentioned
Sayyid Javad Shirazi, while on his way to the Hijaz for further studies, still
sold his father's merchandise in the Muscat market .

But the large scale trade in the family really flourished at the time of
his elder uncle Haji Sayyid Muhammad whose marriage to one of the oldest and

* — families * known as 'Abd
most reputable tujjar                    r     al-flusaini— must have partly
contributed to his success 3 . In spite of chronic waves of political insecurity
and risks of economic failure, the ^Abd al-Husaini managed to establish a trade

in Bushihr which according to Pars Nanrih ,'extended from the remotest parts of
India to the farthest corners of Farangistan' , and survived for generations.

Sayyid Hasan

'Ali and their relatives and descendents, later known as Afnans ,
throughout the nineteenth century and up to the early decades of the present
century, operated large scale trade from Shiraz, Yazd, Bushihr and Bandar 'Abbas
inside Iran, and Bombay, Hong Kong, Ishqabad (Ashkhabad) and Beirut outside
Iran. Muhammad Ali Afnan, one of the three sons of Haji Sayyid Muhammad and

a maternal cousin of the Bab, who was of almost the same age, first started
from Shiraz in the 1830's and then with the expansion of the Iranian opium trade
in the 1860's and 70's, moved to Bombay and then to Hong Kong where in
participation with his sons, his brothers and his brothers-in-law, he managed
to control 'a large portion of the opium exports from Isfahan, Yazd and Pars'
to China . Another son, Haji Muhammad Taqi Vakil al-Haqq, who succeeded the

Bab in the Bushihr office in the 1840's, later moved to Yazd and then to
Ashkhabad . Also Haji Sayyid Muhammad's five grandsons were all engaged in

9   *             *                 — —                 —
land and trade . The younger uncle of the Bab, Haji Sayyid Hasan ^Ali was

based in Yazd. He married the daughter of another reputable merchant of
Shiraz, Haji ^Abd al-Rasul Tajir Shirazi, and in collaboration with his brothers,
handled their trade in the eastern markets of Kirman, Mashhad, and Tabas 3 .

The Bab's father-in-law, Haji Mirza ''All Tajir Shirazi, , was also a

descendent of another merchant family which was a branch of the maternal family
of the Bab. He and one of-his sons, Mirza Abul Qasim Shirazi (sometimes known
as Saqqa Khanih-i, born 1226/1811-12) also participated in the Bushihr trade.
Pars Nonrih confirms that Mirza Abul Qasim's trade was substantial. 'As he
embarked on his forefathers' trade, he commissioned commercial agents in every

4              r -
corner'    When Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad returned to Shiraz in the early 1840's
and married, it seems that he started some commercial activities with Mirza
Abul Qasim. He established his office in Sara-yi Gumruk in the bazar of Shiraz
near the office of his brother-in-law .

The summary picture given above of the family of the Bab, as an example
of merchant families in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, proves
that there was a very distinctive drive towards commercial activities in the
family, which in spite of various exceptional departures, often survived in
remarkable conformity and harmony with its side interests, and in fact
flourished in later decades, to give rise to a prosperous and affluent family

with close intercommunal links which was the nucleus for a larger commercial
network.   These inter-marital links between tujjar families of Shiraz, of which
the marriage of the Bab, his uncle's, his cousins, and the sons and grandsons
of his father-in-law are examples, are the signs of a more comprehensive
interrelation, which held the merchant community of Shiraz together.     The
prosperity of the community, though constantly threatened by frequent political
upheavals, urban disorders and economic hazards, chiefly owed its survival to
these intercommunal, professional and family relations. This in turn allowed
the emergence of a close community, with a cohesive and homogenous character,
of which a collective response to outside threats, professional cooperation,
economic flexibility, strong religious beliefs and respect for moral values are
features. These characteristics were a reflection of the general norms and
values of an urban 'middle class', and in a mutual interplay with the social
and economic structure, an ethic was conceived with emphasis on personal and
professional moral qualities.

It is in the light of this communal ethic, that the ideas and attitudes of
the Bab, which are first reflected in his personal piety, professional trust­
worthiness, and then in vigorous asceticism and unorthodox religious and
mystical themes, should be examined. This sense of moral obligation, or
attention towards religious and mystical themes, was no doubt connected to the
social and economic conditions which for instance enabled the merchants to
afford education or other intellectual and enlightened pursuits, or encouraged
strong links with religious, and to a lesser extent, mystical fig,ares in
society. Characteristics such as piety, professional honesty and integrity,
were further strengthened by the weight that in theory was given to the honest
and pious merchant in a religious context. The religious teachings which were
embellished by the traditions and deeds of the Prophet and imams,served as a
theoretical framework for the emergence of an ideal type in the mind of
merchants . Teachings which praised honesty and godliness in trade, and warned
the evildoers, and the very fact that trade was the profession of Muhammad

al-Amin, had a special meaning for the merchants. It was these teachings which

guaranteed that 'the trustworthy, just and believing merchant shall stand at
the day of judgement among the witnesses of blood' , or reminded them that
'the merchants will be raised up on the day of resurrection as evildoers,
except those who fear God, are honest and speak the truth' 2 .

The problem remains as to what extent these moral values, emphasised in
traditions or in the Islamic legal code for transactions and trade, were
observed in practice. No doubt a need for cooperation and mutual trust
encouraged merchants to seek some practical application in their economic
activity and even more in their personal conduct. Numerous references to the
honesty and trustworthiness of merchants in texts such as Pars NanrCh , may be
better appreciated when compared to the contemporary European accounts. In
Trots Ans en Asie Gobineau gives an interesting account of Persian merchants:

> '... In Persia merchants are perhaps the most respectable part
> of the population. They are regarded as being very honest.
> Since they do not take unnecessary risks, and as merchants are
> more often than not sons of merchants who have inherited a more
> or less substantial fortune which they will transmit to their
> sons, they are devoid of worldly ambition and above many forms
> of intrigue. They need public esteem and carefully cultivate
> it. As a result, this witty, sceptical, mocking, and distrust­
> ful people does not hesitate to entrust merchants with its money
> for investment; in this respect merchants play the same part as
> European credit institutions. They therefore hold most of the
> capital of Persia, which gives them great importance in the eye
> of government, which is always harassed by financial obligations
> and which would not know what to do if they were not there to
> help it out' 3 .

He then points out that although 'the Persian merchant is almost always
strictly honest 1 , in some of their practices such as delay in payment of bills
of exchange, they do not stand up to their reputation. But 'from the point of
view of morality', he maintains, 'it would perhaps be wrong to judge this mode
of behaviour with the vigour of our commercial principles. This kind of easy­
going behaviour does not stop Persian merchants from acting in good faith in

their business dealings' .

Almost the same universal characteristics are also detected by Malcolm
who on his second visit (circa 1810) to Iran met merchants in Bushihr, Shiraz
and Isfahan, and everywhere 'found their general characters nearly the same':

> "The plunder of a merchant, without some pretext, would shake
> all confidence, and be fatal to that commerce from which a
> great proportion of the public revenue is derived; the most
> tyrannical monarchs, therefore, have seldom committed so

> so severely in the late revolutions of the country that they
> continue to act with great caution ... Some few make a display
> of their wealth; but in general their habits are not merely
> frugal, but penurious'1.

Other sources attributed similar characteristics. Edward Scott Waring in
the first decade of the nineteenth century writes that 'the merchants of Persia
are a shrewd, sensible and thrifty class of people, willing to undergo any
hardship if they have a prospect of making money' 2 . Whereas Edward Burgess
himself a merchant in Tabriz (between 1828-55) on a few occasions praises the
honesty and thoroughness of Tabriz"! merchants who are 'so regular in their
payments that upon most occasions I have not even to send a servant for the
money ...' 3 . Thus the contrary view expressed by some writers seems largely
unjustified. C.J. Wills, a medical officer in Iran in the late 1860 ? s and
early 1870's believed that the 'merchant class are generally the most bigoted
and penurious of the Persian race. Only on retiring from business do they
dare to launch out into ostentation; for the mere suspicion of wealth in Persia
exposed them to the exaction of those in power' . To this, Binning adds:

Regardless of the exaggeration and bigotry of some of the above remarks,
which is perhaps due to a change which occurred in the attitude of the
European travellers in the second half of the nineteenth century, one may
observe changes in the habits and practices of the Persian merchants over the
years. Recurring references to the problems of insecurity, governmental
pressure, and changes in the economic climate, suggest some links between
outside factors and the moral standards of the merchants. These external

which were no doubt vital for the survival of any mutual trust in professional
relations given the changing political and economic situation. The inter-
family and inter-community bonds between the big merchants, or between the
various groups within the merchant community, or between merchants in different
cities provided a network within which not only the process of commercial and
financial transactions was regulated, but more important for this argument, a
set of universal norms existed which were developed into the communities'
standard ethical and ultimately intellectual values. The practical implications,
or the change and modifications which appeared in these norms is beyond the
capacity of this study, but what is of particular interest here is the
realisation of these values in the person of the Bab, first in his trade and
method of transactions, and then as independent abstract entities which formed
one of the pillars of his future revelation.

These qualities of trustworthiness and honesty, as far as the principles
of commercial activities are concerned, are detectable in the Bab, his family
and his relatives. FSrs Namih's brief mention of the uncles of the Bab that
'for generations they were engaged in trade and are known for their honesty' 2
goes beyond a casual complimentary remark when Mirza Ahmad Shirazi states that
'all of them (i.e. uncles of the Bab) are trustworthy merchants and reputed to
be noble Sayyids* 3 . The same qualities have also been attributed to the Bab,

and can be seen in a number of anecdotes narrated from his days in Bushihr.
These anecdotes more than anything suggest that his strict observation of
religious precepts for a thorough and honest trade, was to some extent in
contrast with the 'easy-going' behaviour of his colleagues, and in turn demanded
firmer observation of the religious law.

On one occasion, a merchant in Bushihr, a certain Hajl Mirza Abul Hasan
_                                                   •               •
Yazdi, who was on his way to the pilgrimage of Hajj, entrusted the Bab with
some merchandise to be sold in his absence. But while he'was away, the price
of the merchandise fell and it was sold at a price cheaper than was expected.
However, on his return to Bushihr, Sayyid (Ali Muhammad, contrary to the
general practice of the time, which only obliged him to pay back the value of
the sold merchandise, included the extra amount of 175 tuman; the difference
between the original value and the price fetched, insisting that failing to
pay the original price is contrary to the code of trustworthiness . On another
occasion, the sale of a cargo of indigo was agreed between Sayyid ''All Muhammad
and some merchants in Bushihr. After the delivery of the goods, at the time
of the payment, the purchasers came back to Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad and asked for
a discount; a general method of after sale bargaining practised in all Iranian
markets and known as ddbbih 2 . When the Bab declined to consider the customary
reduction, he found himself with the purchasers' objection who argued that such
reduction is a 'national custom' (rasm-i mamlikat} , and should be observed by
everyone. But it is reported that the Bab insisted that 'soon many unlawful
customs will be abolished', and further in response to their refusal to pay
the full sum, took back the merchandise and made the contract void. The
merchants who regarded the cancellation of the deal and the return of the
merchandise as a blow to their commercial credit, wrote complaints to his uncle
Haji Sayyid Muhammad, who in turn blamed Sayyid ''All Muhammad for not 'acting
in accordance with people's wishes and neglecting accepted customs and

practices' .

Although the author of Nuqtat al-Kdf believes that the Bab during his
residence in Bushihr, was successful in his business 'to the extent that the

.-
chiefs of tujjar took notice of his holiness 1 mastery in commercial matters' 2 ,
he also maintains that the Bab became known to people because of 'spending all
his capital', either by giving away 70 tuman to the poor, or being too engaged
in his prayers and devotions and thus making substantial losses in the market 3 .
One may assume that it is this attitude which made the continuation of the
partnership with his uncles a formidable task. As"MuT.n al-Saltanih points out;
'considering the existing necessities of the time', the Bab finally separated
from his uncles and set up his own independent trade 4 .

The above evidence illustrates that for young Sayyid All Muhammad
engagement in trade not only served as a means for earning his livelihood, but
more significantly was a means of emphasising those moral aspects which were
for him idealised in the words and deeds of the Prophet. In one of his letters,
presumably to some merchants, he refers to these 'true' qualities;

> 'SayI What God formerly authorised for Muhammad, and then for
> ''All Muhammad, was trade, of which you have also prospered and

> honest in his business, God will guarantee him against fraud.
> So, those of you who established your trade on the path of
> God, and thus with the "Manifestation of God", are truthful in
> your trade'^
> This comparison between the Bab and the Prophet is also drawn in the
writings of the followers of the Bab such as Haji Mirza Jani, himself a
merchant , who states that Sayyid fAli Muhammad's engagement in trade 'was
designed to "accomplish the proof" to the people, so they would not be able to
claim that he lacked the capacity of dealing with people. Thus the same
mysterious considerations behind the engagement of his venerated ancestor (i.e.
the Prophet) in trade, could also be applied to him. So, in every sense he
could be a sign of that "original light" even in his orphanhood 1 .

This moralistic approach to various aspects of commercial transactions,
which is detectable also in his scattered and often brief references in the
Bay an, suggests that in fact his later teachings, though they sometimes approved
of some of the accepted practices common among merchants, denounced many other
customs as unlawful and improper.    Thus contrary to the restricted regulations
set up by Shar , but in compliance with common practice, he allows a lawful
interest on the borrowed money 'as it is now practised among the merchants',
or allows agreement in the extension or delay of the repayment of exchange bills.
He regards the mutual satisfaction of both parties as the essential condition
for the lawfulness of any contract regardless of age or position, whether they
are 'under age, adults, slaves or free men' . On the subject of foreigners,
he emphasises that only those Christian merchants (huruf—i k-itab-i alif i.e.
followers of the Gospel) who follow useful trades and professions are permitted

to dwell in the countries of believers . On another occasion, he refers to
changes in the monetary system and acknowledges that any depreciation of
currency, both gold and silver, brings losses to tujj"ar. He hopes that in the

future these fluctuations will settle . As far as prohibition of some
merchandise is concerned, he strictly forbids trade of opium, intoxicating
drugs and liquors for believers, but under certain conditions allows their use
for medical purposes .

Compared to other professions, in most of his references, special attention
was paid to the respectability of an honest, thorough and fair trade. But
nonetheless, the extent of this attention should not be exaggerated. In fact
the bulk of the Bab's writings in the years after his 'revelation* was mainly
focused on mystical, moral, devotional and ritualistic themes, which in effect
left little room for the development of any consistent social and economic
idealogy.  This implies that the effect of professional background in the
personality and teachings of the Bab is much more subtle than a direct

reflection of the material wishes of the nineteenth century merchant class .
For him this material life, and the struggle for livelihood could only be
valued when it was treated as an instrument for a far more important spiritual
and moral perfection. It is with regard to this interpretation that his
engagement in trade, or his excessive preoccupation with moral values, find
their proper place as tests for assessing this perfection. For the Bab, as he
himself describes it, trade was an act of worship and veneration of God; he
swears that during his days of trade, he never bowed to put a hall-mark on a
bale or merchandise, unless to remember and to venerate the greatness of God 2 .
This is the attitude which underlined the Bab's approach to material life, and
gradually brought him closer to an ascetic and mystical life.

Ill

The two aspects of professional honesty and lack of proper school
education, further supplemented by references, all retrospective, to other
'extraordinary 1 characters, and produce a picture of a young Sayyid ''All
Muhammad in which asceticism, devotion and the supernatural are the main
features. References to his preoccupation with prayers, revealing dreams, and
extraordinary remarks during his childhood and youth explain the origins of
those qualities of 'innocence' and 'holiness 1 , which more than any other
intellectual faculty led him and his followers to believe that these were
signs of a divine deputation. They provide a primary justification for his
later claims since they depict him to his followers as an exceptionally pure
person who from the very beginning was designated to receive inspiration.
Close examination of the content of these supernatural experiences may no doubt
provide a more understandable answer to the question of his future 'revelation' 3 .
Dreams in particular seem to have played a significant role in the Bab's own

assumption of his spiritual faculties.      It is related that in his childhood
he had a dream of a huge balance suspended between heaven and earth. On one
scale of the balance he saw Imam Ja far Sadiq, a character who in Sh/i Islam
is renowned for his vast and almost comprehensive knowledge; then an unseen
hand put the Bab on the other scale and his side proved heavier, and tended
towards the earth . In 3aJjZfah-yi, ^Adliyah, he himself pointed to the influence
of dreams on his ability to reveal verses; 'RememberI the emanation of all
these verses and prayers and all these unlearnt sciences ( ulum—i ladunni) i s
because of a dream which I once had of the holy head of the Master of Martyrs
(Sayyid al-Shuhada* i.e. Imam Husain) upon him be peace, detached from his
holy body, together with the heads of other companions. I drank seven handfuls
of his holy blood with greatest joy, and it is now the blessing of that blood
which illuminated my heart with such verses and prayers' 2 .

Again in another dream in 1262 (1846) he saw that at the hour of the spring
equinox, some books were sent down to him. When he opened one of them he noticed
that its pages were covered with the dust of Imam Husain's

tomb. He looked
more closely and saw a tablet in an excellent sh-ikastih style written in red
ink, and at the bottom was an astral seal with the epigram 'I entrusted my cause
to God' and signed Mahdl. The contents of the tablet were confirmation of his

claims . All these references to dreams and the way they implicitly prove
certain spiritual and moral points, should be seen in the light of a continuous
tradition of revelatory dreams in Shi'i esoteric thinking of visiting the
Prophet and Imams and particularly the Twelfth Imam. In particular these dreams
have a striking similarity to those described by Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i - dreams
which disclose the secret of the Book, unfold the dubious points of Akhbar, and

explain various theological and mystical problems by means of direct encounter
with the Prophet or Imam . These strong prophetic allusions in the Bab's
dreams, which could no doubt hardly be delivered in the state of wakefulness,
should be regarded as a prelude to his later divinations.
Other reports on the early life of Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad

also contributed
to his image as an 'extraordinary' child. It is related that once in his early
days at the maktab, when his teacher instructed him to memorise the verse 'He

is the Deliverer, the All-Knowing' Q?uua al-Fattah al- fAlZm) he insisted first

on understanding the meaning, and thus enraged Shaykh ^Abid . In another
instance he replied to his fellow classmate who asked him about his reluctance
to follow the other students in their reading exercises with a couplet from
Hafiz;
* / * 'Hearest thou not the whistle's call, this snare should now thy prison

spent his time in prayers . Sayyid Javad Karbala'i who was a friend of his
uncles', and a frequent visitor to their house, related that he saw the Bab
deeply devoted to his daily prayers when he was a child of about ten. He also
related that one day, when Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad had come late to school and

was questioned by the school master, he replied that he had been in the house
of his ancestor (dor khanih-i jaddam budam) , referring to the Prophet. To his
teacher's remonstration that as a child daily prayer is not demanded of him,
he answered 'I wish to be like my ancestor' . Again on a day trip to the shrine
of Sabzpushan in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, his uncle Haji Sayyid ''Ali was

deeply impressed when he found his young nephew in a small cave in the nearby
mountain reading his prayers in the middle of the night .

quoting Mirza ''All Asghar Sami'' Rashti a childhood friend of Rashti).

The mystery of the holy dreams and unconventional words and deeds, can
only partly be interpreted by the myth, which later encompassed his image as a
holy and infallible man who was born with the right qualities to carry out a
prophetic mission.   For the greater part, it was his own austerity and his
innate obsession with a divine support, which later found a way to express
itself in spiritual symbolism and the language of dream interpretation as it
was commonly employed in Shaykhism.

His years of residence in Bushihr were also marked by similar accounts of
devotion and austerity. In fact as time passed, this sense of religiosity and
devotion developed to some mystical tendencies which were not far from self
mortification and seclusion practised by the Sufis or ascetics of the time.
More than anything else it was devotion, self denial, 'extreme courtesy and
the serene expression on his face' and 'his humility and lowliness' that is
said to have left a favourable effect on his friends, relatives and colleagues.
Haji Sayyid Javad who once dwelt for six months in the house of the Bab in

Bushihr recounts; 'I often heard those who were closely associated with him
testify to the purity of his character, to the charm of his manner, to his
self-effacement, to his high integrity and to his extreme devotion to God' .
The same impression could be seen in other accounts. Mirza Ahmad Shirazi pointed

out that 'I have gathered, as a result of my inquiries, that he was very
quiet, modest and shy during his childhood, and that he showed signs of piety

on reaching the age of maturity' . But a more interesting account comes from
a certain Haji Muhammad Husain, a colleague of the Bab in Bushihr who related;

•      •         *

> 'Since the Bab was a native of Shiraz, and yet had not
> assumed any claims, I, in the company of other Shirazi
> merchants, used to go to Saray-i Maymandi to visit him,
> and we became intimate with him, But he was very taciturn,

> absorbed in his own thoughts, and was preoccupied with
> repetition of his prayers and verses (azkar). He was a
> handsome man with a thin beard, dressed in clean clothes,
> wearing a green shawl, and a black turban'3.

Signs of sanctity and religious zeal which attracted his colleagues, also
appear in his ascetic practices, and are clearly evident from a much quoted
reference to his ascetic exercises (riyazat) on the roof of his trade house in

1\.   Cited in Nabil. 79.

Bushihr.     Attacking the Bab's deviation from the path of 'true religion',
Nas-ikh al-Tauar-ilh states that 'when evil temptations and selfish ambitions

> encouraged him, in spite of (the order of) the holy Sfozz1 , he yielded towards
> arduous purifications     (y-iyazat-'i shaqqih ), and tended to reach the high
stages (&a oz"£j—£ aliy'ih'). As I have heard, once in Bushihr, where hot winds
are as burning as the breath of a furnace, at the peak of the heat, he ascended
up to the roofs and stood in the sun bare-headed, reciting his prayers (wwra^)' .
To this Hidayat adds that the purpose of ascetic exercises was to 'dominate
the sun 1 (taskhir-i shams) . However implausible these reports might appear,
they are in line with Mirza Ahmad's reference to the Bab's intention for
'mastering the science of planets, particularly the sun' 3 . Even Nabil

— Zarandi~
confirms that in the oppressive heat of Bushihr, each Friday while exposed to
the fierce rays of the noontide sun, he devoted several hours to continuous
worship upon the roof of his house . Although 'the headless and ignorant
around him thought him to be enamoured with the sun itself, in fact 'from early
dawn till sunshine, and from midday till late in the afternoon, he dedicated
his time to meditation and pious worship' .

The authors of court chronicles such as Sipihr and Hidayat in typical
statements show a mixture of sarcasm, hostility and accusations made with words
chosen solely to serve the purpose of the rhyme. They attack the Bab's
asceticism as the symptom of 'evil temptations, which finally caused him to
exhaust his body so relentlessly that his mind became defective and his brain
was disturbed' or suggest that 'the effect of the sun's heat totally
evaporated the moisture of his brain and led him to sun-worship' . This is
perhaps due to the fact that same preoccupation with asceticism and devotion
which earlier were taken as the positive sign of the Bab's holiness and sanctity,
after the proclamation of the Babi movement were interpreted as evidence for
his 'evil' intentions. But in fact such harsh practices further motivated an
unorthodox quest for achieving an exceptional level of purity and divination,
not only by austerity and self denial but by paying attention to esoteric ideas
and practices which were not attainable in conventional ways. These tendencies

The Bab's association with Sufi orders, or seeking guidance from a Sufi

the Bab's unlearned knowledge, rules out affiliation to any order, or reception
of spiritual guidance, but it is likely that at least to some extent the Bab
was exposed to certain heterodox ideas and practices then in circulation in
his environment.
It should be pointed out that Bushihr was one of the strongholds of those

o
Akhbarl ^ulama who were originally from Bahrain . Their significance in this
context becomes more evident since similar interests in austerity, and 'ulum-i

can be traced among leading Akhbarl figures such as the well known
Mirza Muhammad

Akhbarl . Besides, long established contacts between Shaykh
Ahmad Ahsa'l   and his successor Sayyid Kazim

Rashtl with the Akhbarl ' ulama of

Bahrain and also the fulama of the Al ^ Us• fur family in Bushihr, to whome the
Bab paid a special tribute, should not be overlooked . However none of the
existing evidence can lead us to any firm and concrete result, since the Bab
himself remained almost totally silent on the subject of his past intellectual
experiences .
Yet an interesting passage in Sdhifah-yi,

^ Adliydh suggests that at least in
the later years of his life the Bab regarded all important currents in
contemporary Shi^i thinking as deviant and misdirected;

schools did not however prevent him from an inclination towards Shaykh Ahmad's
teachings; of him he speaks with reverence and respect. His serious interest
in the Shaykhi schools first appears to have been procured by Sayyid Javad

Karbala'i in Bushihr . This seems to have coincided with the production of
some of his earliest writings.   Nicolas makes a passing reference to certain
Risala   Fiqlriya written in Bushihr, in which 'il montre une vraie piete une
effusion islamique qui semblaint lui presager un brillant avenir dans les liens

*j
de 1'orthodoxie chiite 1 . Apparently it is these writings (written towards the
end of his residence in Bushihr, around 1257 Q.) which being unorthodox in their
contents, worried the uncle Haji Sayyid Muhammad, and obliged him to ask Haji
Sayyid Javad for assistance by advising his nephew 'not to write or to speak
about certain matters, and not to reveal certain things which might arouse
people's jealousy, because they cannot see how a young uneducated merchant

would be able to reveal such learned words' .

Preoccupation with these ideas and practices gradually isolated Sayyid Ali
Muhamma

d from his commercial duties, and led him to abandon his business and
leave Bushihr for ' Atabat. If such a decision was perhaps partly due to the
Bab's longing to visit the shrine of the Imams where he could, like many other
ascetics, in the adjacency of the shrines pray and meditate, it was also due
to his enthusiasm for visiting, and possibly attending theological circles, and
in particular that of Sayyid Kazim Rashtl, for whom he felt a special affection.
But when he informed his family of his intention, his uncles who were already
disturbed by his unusual behaviour, tried to discourage him by simply ignoring
his constant requests that they settle their commercial accounts. But in spite
of their deliberate delays, Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad who was determined in his
decision, himself settled all the accounts and made all the necessary arrange­
ments before leaving for ''Atabat sometime in 1256-7 (1840-41) after more than

Although the Bab's abode in the 'Holy Land' (Ard al-Muqaddas , i.e.''Atabat)

lasted less than a year as he himself specificed , and although of his eleven
months of residence he spent eight in Karbila* and three in various other holy
cities 3 , even this short stay was enough to draw the attention of some curious
observers, most of them students and followers of Sayyid Kazim

Rashti, to the

unusual and 'magnetic 1 character of the young Sayyid from Shiraz.    The same
characteristic which had given him a halo of innocence in Bushihr, appeared
even more emphatically here in his ritualism on his frequent visits to the
Shrine of Imam Husain.

Beside Sayyid Javad Karbala'i, among other would-be followers of the Bab,
Mulla Sadiq Khurasan! - who owing to his piety and devotion was surnamed
Muqaddas - first saw the Bab in the Shrine of Husain, where the lamentations
and humbleness of the young Sayyid made a great effect on him . He was even
more bewildered when Sayyid 'All Muhammad, who first even refused to reply to
his greetings in the courtyard, on his exit from the shrine apologised and
explained his behaviour by maintaining that the 'mosque is the place where
attention should not be paid to anybody or any direction except to God' .
This behaviour of the Bab is better understandable when in his ZiyZrat Mm-ih, he
instructs the pilgrims to 'enter (the shrine), without uttering a single word,
and walk with gravity until thou reachest (a distance of) seven paces below

o
the foot (of the tomb)' .

Referring to the circumstances of the Bab's visit Nuqtat al-Kaf states
that, 'At the time of his holiness* visit to the shrine of his holy ancestors,
some strange and wonderful expositions, such as the manner of entering or
visting the shrine, and the state of presence (hukur) in which he was seen,

o              _
astonished a great number of people' . To this, Haji

Rasul, a Shaykhi merchant
from Qazvin adds that he never saw any other person 'whether from divines,
mystics, spiritual guides, nobles and merchants' who could match 'the humility,
devotion or magnificence' in his visits 4 .      Other Shaykhis such as the
Nahri brothers, two young merchants from Isfahan attending Sayyid Kazim's

Mirza Riza Javahiri Isfahan!, also *a merchant 6 ,

Karbila'. Even the unsympathetic Mirza Muhammad Tunikaburii, the author of Qisas

,                                     •
at- tflamc?> who at the time was a talabih, noticed the Bab's unusual method of
visiting the shrine:

> 'One day I was sitting with a certain pious (Muqaddas) above the
> head of his Holiness' holy tomb (i.e. tomb of Iniam Husain) when
> we saw this Sayyid (i.e. the Bab) enter the Shrine.* He stood in
> the doorway, read his visitation and left without entering the
> Shrine. I asked Muqaddas; "who was this man?" Muqaddas replied;
> "He was Mir ''All Muhammad Shlrazi, and he is a student of Sayyid
> Kazim". I asked "wny did he visit the Shrine in this manner?"
> "Because he considers this as the most respectful way" he answered.
> I said "this is wrong since visiting (ztyarat) is one of the

> the tomb is like failing to perform non-obligatory prayers
> (namaz-i riafilih} on the grounds that we are not worthy to stand
> in the threshold of our Lord." 1

This emphasis on the Bab's manner of visiting the shrine, to which
Tunikabunl's account alludes, is chiefly due to the preference which this act
of devotion received in the ShiCi and especially Shaykhi teachings. In a
theological system like Shaykhism with a strong esoteric element, the visit of
shrines was regarded as the visit of the Imam himself with almost the same
status as intuition and revealing dreams. It is because of this that the
followers of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i, at the time of visiting shrines performed

.      •
carefully observed rites in order to pay their full homage, and to avoid any
act which might be a desecration of the shrine, they never proceeded beyond the
foot of the tomb. This method of visiting was one of the distinctive character­
istics of the Shaykhis. Hence they spoke of non-Shaykhis, perhaps with a sense

- -   —                                                           2

of disapproval, as BaZasoz^s, or those who approach the head of the Imam's tomb .
But nonetheless, this attention to the act of visiting and self-humiliation and
unbounded abasement were not confined to the Shaykhis. As it is reported, Aqa
Muhammad Baqir Bihbahani,     one of the ma.s'HS.yi-'k'h of Shaykh Ahmad,

visited the
shrine of Husain in a spirit of submission and grief which is not far different

from the practice of the Shaykhis or that of Sayyid ''All Muhammad the Bab .

In some of his early writings the Bab went to great lengths to discuss
the details of the rites of visitation, and the secret of every action and
movement. In dl-SahZfah Bayn al-Haramayn , written at the beginning of 1261 ,
he gave minute instructions for various acts of ritual ablution, entrance to
the shrine, and recitation of the appropriate verses and prayers, while
emphasising the numerical and alphabetical significance of every stage of

o                                               /
ztyarat . As is evident from some of his instructions , the Bab adopted a
method of ZT/yarat which was influenced by current Shaykhi ideas both in rituals
and in esoteric interpretation . Nevertheless he adopts some new values both
on visitation and on prayers which are a new departure complementing those of
Shaykhism. Indeed, signs of new developments in the Bab's thinking already
appear in one of his earlier works, Zt-yarat Namih-i At Allah which judging from
its contents, must have been written during, or immediately after his journey
to 'Atabat. It is this work which E.G. Browne rightly believes has 'the utmost
interest and importance in tracing the gradual formation of the Bab's ideas',
and is so far 'the sole record of this early period of his life, before he put
forward any claim to divine inspiration 1 . The contents of this work, like the
SahZfa, 'reflects the doctrines of the Bab's masters, but an undercurrent of
new ideas, still hardly defined, is discernible in places' .

This attitude of humility and detachment on behalf of the Bab at the time
of z-iyarat, as though he was 'admitted in the presence of the Lord 1 no doubt
had the greatest appeal to those who especially admired these qualities. It
was the 'sanctity' and 'sinlessness' of the Bab, as well as his innocent
appearance, which more than any intellectual faculty or scholarly acquirement
could attract students and followers of the Shaykhi school. And in fact it was
because of this admiration, that contacts were established between the Bab and
the Shaykhi students. By the invitation of Mulla Sadiq Muqaddas, he attended
a Friday public gathering where he was introduced to Sayyid Kazim and others,
and reportedly received his sympathetic attention. In the same gathering, the
Bab was said to have been deeply touched when Mulla Husain Bushruyihi recited
some of the poetry of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'I 2 .
The public gathering to which the Bab was invited was most probably the
Diwan al-Rashti, a literary circle set up by Sayyid Kazim, which met in the
building of his well known library, to allow an exchange of opinion on all
poetical, literary and theological themes 3 . A spirit of patronage was augmented
by Sayyid Kazim's desire to broaden his sphere of intellectual and political
influence. This was not a rare phenomenon in 19th century fAtabat. Mostly at
the expense of his rivals, it provided for Sayyid Kazim substantial support not
only from Persian religious students, but from a large and heterogeneous body
of Persian merchants, Arab origin fulama and literary and poetical figures.

Thus in the light of Sayyid Kazim's general enthusiasm for attracting new
followers and supporters, it is not unusual to see that Sayyid ''All Muhammad,
who came from a merchant family with Shaykhi connections, received some
attention in the circle. But still it is hard to know to what extent, as it
is hinted by later sources, this was a deliberate move by the Shaykhi leader
to single out the Bab as an exceptional, or in fact superior person. Shaykh
Hasan Zunuzi, an intimate disciple of Rashti, and a later follower of the Bab ,

who accompanied his teacher to the abode of the Bab for paying a visit to T a
highly esteemed and distinguished person', is deeply bewildered by the
submissive behaviour of Rashti in front of the young Shirazi merchant; 'I could
not explain the motive which could have induced the Sayyid to manifest such
profound reverence in the presence of that youth - a reverence which even the
sight of the shrine of the Siyyidu f sh-Shuhada' had failed to excite' . But
nonetheless, beside Zunuzi's account, which may have been affected by his zeal
for the new movement, as is apparent from the indirect allusions inherent in
the comparison between the visit to the young Sayyid and a visit to the shrine,
there'is very limited evidence to prove or deny Sayyid Kazim's approval of the
Bab as his successor.

Much has been said about the Bab's pupillage under Sayyid Kazim. Non-Babi
sources, whose main objective is to discredit the Babis' claim of 'unlearned
knowledge', insist that he was a talabih of Rashti. Ndsikh al-TauarZkh for
example maintains that 'he attended the teaching circle of Sayyid Kazim Rashti .
.. and benefited from his words, and followed the path of Shaykh Ahmad 1 2 .
The author of Q-istas al-^lflama3 who claims to have been present at Sayyid Kazim's
lecture at the time, writes: 'Mir ^Ali Muhammad also used to come to his
lectures, and had with him pen and ink-stand, and whatever Sayyid Kazim said,

3    - -'

of moist and dry, he used to write down in the same lecture' . Haji Muhammad
Karim Khan Kirmani, in his refutation Izhaq al-Battl (written in 1261/1845)
which is representative of the non-Babi, Shaykhi attitude, despite all his
enmity towards the Bab, maintains that; 'as it is reported, he possesses
(qualities) of peacefulness, gravity and dignity, but in his heart he possesses
presumption and arrogance' 4 . He then adds: 'For a while he remained in the
service of Sayyid (i.e. Rashti), but due to the immense glory and loftiness of
our centre of faith and the protector of the splendid Shar^, he was not then
able to reveal what he had in his heart' . The official chronicler Hidayat
even suggests that the Bab 'was encircled in the teaching circles of the ^ulama
of the time, especially that of Sayyid Kazim Rashti'

In contrast to the above references, a second group of pro-Babi sources
insist that Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad's attendance in the circle of Karbill'

was short and infrequent.     Nuqtat al-Kaf in particular takes care to state that

'what has been said about the presence of his holiness in the lectures of the
late Sayyid is not correct, but his holiness every now and then attended the
preaching sessions (majlis-i mua'izih) of the late Sayyid 1 . It was in these

gatherings that Shaykh Hasan Zunuzi noticed the presence of the Shirazi youth

and noticed an enigmatic allusion by his master, which in his eyes was a clear
indication of Sayyid Kazim's special attention towards the Bab. As soon as

Sayyid Kazim's eye fell upon the Bab sitting amidst the assembly, he discontinued

his address and held his peace. 'Whereupon one of his disciples begged .him to
resume the argument which he had left unfinished. "What more shall I say?"
replied Sayyid Kazim, as he turned his face towards the Bab. "Lo, the Truth is
more manifest than the ray of light that has fallen upon that lap'" 2 . To what
extent Zunuzi's account can be taken as a positive sign of Rashti's approval of
the Bab, or to what degree Sayyid Kazim 'benefited from the inner light

_     _                    _        *                          _ _   _     — "3
(nur-i bat-in)' of Sayyid 0\li Muhammad, as it is suggested by Haji Mirza Jani ,

•                      »                             •

can only be measured by the zealousness of those Babi writers and narrators
who were anxious to find at least some convincing evidence for establishing a
justifiable background to the Bab's claims.

However, the real answer may lie with the better informed Qatil Karbala'i,
one of the earliest Babi polemists, and himself a student under Sayyid Kazim

for ten years. When in 1263 (1847) in reply to Haji Muhammad Karim Khan's

attacks, he described his recollections of the Bab's abode in Karbila', he was
more anxious to prove the Bab's 'unlearned knowledge' and his command in various
sciences, rather than looking for any sign of approval by Sayyid Kazim. He

argues that

What Qatil implies may be better explained by another reference by Mirza Ahmad who

believes that once or twice the Bab heard 'traditions expounded by Sayyid Kazim

> Rashti' while he was still studying 'elementary subjects' with some members of
> the Shaykhi circle which in due course led him to become 'an adherent of the
> Shaykhi cause' . In fact Mulla Sadiq Muqaddas himself not only confirmed that
once in Karbila* he was asked to teach Sayyid''All Muhammad, but that he was also

2 '
determined to convert him to the Shaykhi doctrine .

One year in 'Atabat was just enough to make Sayyid ''All Muhammad acquainted
with the Shaykhis but was hardly sufficient for him to acquire a deep under­

standing of Shaykhi doctrine. Soon, the anxieties of his mother and his uncles,
which were aggravated by his sudden departure from Bushihr, put an unwanted end

> to his residence in Iraq. His uncle Hajl Mirza Sayyid 'All especially journeyed
> to Karbila'to visit his nephew and possibly encourage him to return. But he
found the Bab utterly reluctant to accompany him back to Shiraz. It appears

that some of the students of Sayyid Kazim also contributed to this reluctance,
since in a visit to Sayyid All, Muqaddas made some effort to convince the
former to allow his nephew to stay for further studies. But Hajl Mirza Sayyid

All who saw that his nephew was neither interested in the family business, nor
in serious theological studies, in reply to the admiration expressed by
Muqaddas admitted that his nephew possessed remarkable moral qualities but as
he was not engaged in any serious learning and not willing to do so, therefore
he was determined not to let him stay in ''Atabat any longer.
It is said that the Bab's resistance finally forced Hajl Sayyid All to
seek the advice of Sayyid Kazim Rashti. Sayyid Kazim first declined to give
any personal opinion, leaving all in the hands of the Bab himself, but later
because of Sayyid 'All's insistence, reluctantly allowed him to return. Thus
Sayyid 'All was able to encourage the Bab to leave Karbila'and return, at least
temporarily, to Shiraz 4 .

An answer to the question whether the Bab studied under Sayyid Kazim
Rashti is important, not because it is supposed to clarify the Bab's unlearned
knowledge' - a matter which cannot be verified by historical scrutiny - but as
to define the extent of his affiliation to the Shaykhi school. If he did not
attend Rashti's lectures more than three times, as it is almost certain from
mentioned statements, and at any rate he did not stay long enough in Karbil"a

to fully grasp the essence of his teachings, it is questionable why he should
have paid homage to Ahsa'i or refer to Rashti as his reverent teacher. As far
as it can be judged from the references in his own writings, one may conclude
that he had some knowledge of Shaykhi ideas and thoughts, at least to the extent
that he could justify his own later claims, or even on occasions, argue or dis­
agree withsome points made by Ahsa'I or Rashti. Furthermore, what is known of
his small collection of books, also specifies the possession of a few well
known Shaykhi texts such as Shark al-ZZyara of Ahsa'I and Shark al-QasZda of

•ri                        * regard to this
Rashti . Hence, perhaps it is with               ' benefit from their writings,
or with the awareness of the fact that they were forerunners and spiritual
predecessors to his manifestation, that he refers to Rashti as 'the revered
scholar and my intimate teacher 1 . This should not be taken literally,, but
as a symbolic acknowledgement of their spiritual affinity.

The Bab's return to Shiraz in the beginning of 1842 (1257-8) was soon
followed by his marriage at the age of twenty three 3 . His marriage, as it is
implied by Mirza Hablballah, was particularly arranged to dissuade the Bab
from his prime intention of returning to fAtabat . He married on 8th Rajab
1258 (1842). His wife Khadijih Ba'ygum, herself described the circumstances
which led to her marriage. He settled with his wife and his mother in his own
house and resumed his trade, this time with greater independence, in an office
in Sara-yi Gumruk .

During the next two years, in spite of the frequent recurrence of riots
and civil disturbances in Shiraz , Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad, owing to his respected
profession and his renowned piousness, seemed to pass a tranquil and relatively
prosperous life. Some years later, during his imprisonment in Maku (1847-8) he

remembered those 'happy days' (ayyam-i surur) with some nostalgia . This life
allowed him enough time to meditate and to concentrate on his newly discovered
eagerness for writing verses. Particularly, as one source points out, after
his return from ^Atabat, he gradually 'eased off his commercial dealings and
his business transactions' 2 . Every morning, before dawn, he would spend some
time in prayers and meditation in his private room before leaving for his
office. Upon his return, an hour after sunset, he performed his evening prayers,
and after supper 'as it was customary amongst merchants, he asked for his

account books' . But as his wife recollected; 'I noticed that those did not
resemble commercial accounts. But whenever I asked him what those papers were,
he smilingly replied "this is the people's book of deeds" (in daftar-i hisab-i
'khalayiq ast) , and if someone unexpectedly called upon him, he would cover the
papers with a cloth 1 . Here, the Bab clearly alluded to the 'reckoning' (hisab)
which according to the Qur*an and traditions, God will require from every man
on the 'Day of Reading of Accounts' (lawn dl-H'isab') or the Day of Judgement.
Each man will receive a 'book' on which his actions are inscribed, and God 'is
prompt in demanding an account'     Very little is known about the Bab's writing
of this period, but the above reference, together with other occasional
references, suggest that prior to his proclamation, he was preoccupied with
writings which had some redemptive and even messianic connotations . A cousin
of his, Muhammad Taq"i Vakil al-Haqq was once given a piece by the Bab which
'resembled the prayers of al-Sahtfa al-SajjadZya' . Whatever the style and
the content of these writings might have been, they were the earliest signs of
an inner development, which ultimately gave the Bab the necessary assurance to
claim the 'divine inspiration'.

However at the time, it was his piety and austerity which brought him some

popularity and recognition in the character of a mystic or a hermit.     'As the
fame of his devotion and piety grew' Sayyid ''All Muhammad 'became known as

Sayyid-i Zikr 1 . If the reference in Kazem Beg could be relied on, even during
his stay in Karbila', due to his 'singularity' and his 'austerity' he acquired
the epithet Majzub.   He adds that;

It is not known fron what source Kazem Beg acquired this information, but
regardless of his euphuistic language and sometimes inaccurate details it is hard
to imagine that the whole of the above account has no base in fact. This would
perhaps confirm the other hints that even before 1844 Sayyid ''All Muhammad must
have aroused more excitement than is usually suggested. But no matter how much
he was known for his intuitions or his austerity, he was still only a young
merchant with an exemplary degree of piety and integrity. 'He still retained
his popularity by reason of his piety and honesty. No one suspected in him any

ulterior or evil motives' . The Bab himself referred to these well known

virtues when drawing a comparison between the mission of the Prophet and that
of his own; 'Prior to the descent of the Divine Comnand, (people) testified to
the godliness, nobility and excellence of the Prophet of God. But see what they
said about him, after the revelation of Furqan, that even the pen is ashamed of
mentioning it.  In the same manner look at the Point of Bayan (Nuqtih-i Bayan);

( ilm -i tcuzuri} , it was also the result of Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad's preoccupation
with forces which he thought were leading him towards an inescapable destiny.
The example of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i, the widespread esoteric tradition, and his
interest in hidden sciences drew his attention towards eschatological thinking 2 .
He was beginning to believe that due to his singular characteristics he must
have been chosen for a divine mission, a mission which brought him into direct

According to Mu 'in al-Saltanih, prior to 1844 he expressed his mission that he
was chosen to accomplish     God's command (Safyib al-Amr) to his mother and his
uncle Hajl Mirza Sayyid ''All, for the first time. To substantiate his sincerity,
the Bab again refers to his religious devotion and personal integrity, stressing
that he only reflected what had been revealed to him 3 . The Bab's wife, who with
great astonishment and perhaps even fear, witnessed the earliest signs of a
strange development in the character of the Bab, related that for the member of
the family 'who saw him being preoccupied most of the time with prayers and
worship, it was only clear that his holiness was a superior person, and we
therefore showed the greatest respect towards him' . But this veneration and

respect came to a critical moment when his family 'greatly horrified and
distressed by hearing such words, sharply blamed him and strongly advised him
to repent from his blasphemy and return to God and never again utter any such
words' . But as Hashtrudi reports, in spite of strong protests, after some
discussions, the Bab was able to win over his uncle Hajl Mirza Sayyid ''Ali.

Convincing him of the "righteousness" of his mission, the Bab maintained that
his claim must remain a secret since 'the will of God has not yet rested upon

disclosure and publication 1 .

What is quoted about the recognition of the Bab by his uncle, seems rather
unconvincing, and in fact simplistic, if two facts were not taken into account.
First, that at the time, the position which the Bab claimed had broad and
rather vague implications, and could still be fitted within the acceptable
framework of common religious beliefs. As it is already noted, the Shaykhi
ideas, as well as other manifestations of millenarianism advocated a sense of
expectation for Zuhur without any direct or distinct indication of the exact
nature, identity or position of the promised one 3 . Secondly, the fact that
Hajl Sayyid ''All himself appeared to have been highly influenced by millenarian
expectations, and his brief Shaykhi contacts made him watchful and vigilant for
the appearance of the promised Zutiur to say the least. Vakil al-Haqq in his
brief but important reference makes it clear that Haji Sayyid 'Ali 'four years
prior to the year sixty (1260) abandoned his trade and withdrew from the public,
and was expectant (for Zuhur') . At the time of ZuTzzIr, when the cause was
declared, he immediately recognised it' 4 . The above references to seclusion,
abandoning material pursuits and vigilant expectations, provide some clues to
the intellectual state of many people like Haji Mirza Sayyid All . On one

occasion in reply to his younger brother Haj I Sayyid Hasan ''All who disputed
the righteousness of the Bab, Hajl Sayyid ''All stated that all the signs of
piety and uniqueness which he had witnessed in the past in his nephew
'convinced him beyond any doubt (hi, ilm al-yaqtn va haqq al~yaqiri)' of the

rectitude of the new cause .

In the years after, Haj I Sayyid   All never abandoned his sincere convictions
towards the Bab, and up to the end he remained one of the advocates of the new
cause. In contrast to his other two brothers, and most other members of his
family who showed apprehension and embarrassment on the publication of the new
claims, he lost no opportunity to vindicate the cause. In 1261 (1845) after
the Bab's return from Haj j , in an important letter from Bushihr to his brother
in Shiraz, HajI

Sayyid 'All openly expressed his full commitment to the Bab .

A few months later during the first round of the anti-Babi persecution, when
the Bab was taken into custody by the Governor of Fars Husain Khan Ajudahbashi,
Haj! Sayyid' All consented to guarantee bail and act as sponsor to his nephew .

Throughout the Bab's house arrest (1261-2/1845-6), Haji Mirza Sayyid r All played
the important role of intermediary between the Bab and his eager followers.
Even after the Bab's departure from Shiraz he never lost his contact with him
or with his disciples. In 1265 (1849) he visited the Bab for the last time in
the fortress of Chihrfq. A few months later, at the beginning of 1266 (1850)
while he was in Tehran, he was arrested, together with a number of other Babis,
by the order of Mirza Taqf Khan Amir Kabir. Admitting his total commitment to
the Babi cause and refusing to retract, together with six other renowned Babis,
he was charged with conspiracy and corruption of belief, and they were put to
death in the Sabzih Maydan market in the capital. At the time he was about
fifty five years of age. It is reported that, to save his life 'eminent merchants
of Shiraz and Tehran' including Malik al-Tujjar himself, interceded, offering
his ransom, but 'he refused to heed their counsel and faced, until his last
hour, with complete resignation, the persecution to which he was subjected' 4 .

Mirza Sayyid ''All's attachment to his nephew should not be regarded as a
one sided relationship. No doubt prior to his proclamation, and in the early
days of the movement, he was a source of encouragement for Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad.
'It was he who surrounded him, while under his care, with unfailing solicitude,
who served him with such devotion, and who acted as intermediary between him
and the host of his followers who flocked to Shiraz to see him 1 . This inter­
mediary role gave him an outstanding position in the early diffusion of the

movement .

These early signs of the new development in the character of the Bab lead
us to the assumption that by this time he was already beginning to move in the
direction of certain new revelations. The nature of this progress and the
manner in which he expressed his spiritual state of mind is hardly clear, but
nevertheless some scattered evidence     suggest that these changes in the
attitude were not completely unknown to a certain number of the people. Even
prior to 1260 Q.(1844), Haji

Sayyid ^Ali's role could be assessed from the
contents of a letter which is quoted in Kawakib al-Dwriya..   Writing in 1843
(1259) from Bushihr to Shiraz, the Bab asks his uncle to inform the tullab

that
'the cause (of God) is still not ripened, and the time has not matured. There­
fore, if anyone attributes anything to me but submission to Islamic laws and
beliefs, I and my holy ancestors will be discontented with him both in this
world and in the next* 3 .

However, since the origin of this partly quoted letter is not clearly
known, it is only fair to acknowledge that it is not possible to make other
than general speculations. This would mean that first, by the year 1259 when
Sayyid Kazim Rashti was still alive (since he died in the last days of 1259)
the Bab's name was known to some people, or groups at least in a local level,
to the extent that there were some students who regarded him as the embodiment

of some form of Ziihur , and attributed to him certain virtues which were beyond
the recognised limits of common religious beliefs.    Secondly, that at the time
Sayyid <Ali Mujiammad himself assumed a certain position, and contemplated a new
doctrine, though he believed that the time of its publication had still not
arrived.  Thirdly, this would explain, at least to some degree, the later
arrival of Mulla Husain Bushruyihi and his companions from Karbila to Bushihr
and then Shiraz in 1260 . Perhaps it is not unrealistic to assume that some
of these tullab, even if they were not the same as those who came from Karbila)
were at least in contact with the Shaykhis in ^Atabat. Mulla Sadiq Muqaddas,
who at the time was travelling between Isfahan, Shiraz and Khurasan, may have
been a vital link. However these speculations can only be extended as far as a
possible link between the Bab, probably through his uncle, with the Shaykhis in
^Atabat, a link which is vital for the understanding of the inexplicable
conversion of a large number of Shaykhi students to the Babi cause.

What is discussed in the above pages leads us back to the original question:
under what circumstances could Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad Shirazi claim to be a
divinely inspired figure? As far as the Bab himself is concerned, he represented
three major characteristics which were considered as crucial for at least some
intellectual currents of the time, and certainly for the popular version of
millenarian beliefs.   First, he was an uneducated (umnrC) layman, who never truly
benefited from the conventional knowledge of the time. Secondly, he possessed
.a degree of piety, devotion and sanctity that was considered as exceptional.
Thirdly, in his intellectual and mystical pursuits he had a non-rational and
unorthodox approach. These characteristics, if unprecedented, were at least in
conformity with the heterodox and messianic trends of the time.

Nevertheless, they developed in a new circumstance mainly as a result of
an interplay between two major themes in the early life of the Bab; the mercantile
ethic and esoteric beliefs.  As a merchant who was brought up in a traditional
merchant family, he inherited a code of personal and social practices which was
one of the chief characteristics of the merchant class.   The earliest
manifestations of this can be seen in the Bab's business practices.      However,
these moral values did not stop within their own traditional sphere of controlling
personal and professional relations.    In the Bab, and some members of his own
family, these ethical values gradually gave rise to some other intellectual

1\.   See below Chapter Four, I.

interests. Some were attracted to religious scholarship, mysticism and even
secular sciences, and some of them were fully absorbed into scholarly and
theological circles to become well known ulama. But for the Bab, such a
departure from the basic practical ethic took a different shape. His lack of
school education, whether voluntary or else the outcome of his failure to cope
with conventional methods of learning, brought him close to an unorthodox
approach to religion. His strivings to reach the 'Truth 1 by way of asceticism
and austerity, his constant imitation of holy figures of the past, and his
deliberate comparisons with the deeds of the Prophet and Imams, his reluctance
to comply with or even to grasp the basis of theology, Arabic and the other
formal sciences and instead his attention towards mastering the secrets of
gnostic knowledge are all features of various aspects of the same approach.
Being distant, but not totally isolated from the esoteric trends of his time,
he was able to set foot on a self styled asceticism, and to some extent
ritualistic path which ultimately led him to an 'intuitive knowledge 1 with
distinct eschatological and millenarian connotations.

Contacts with the Shaykhi circle in 'Atabat had a mutual effect both on
the Bab and some of the students of Sayyid Kazim Rashti. But contrary to what
is usually believed, the influence of the Shaykhi school on the person of the
Bab, though not on the Babi movement, is far less than what may have been
expected. However it is fair to say that at this stage prior to the proclamation,
the millenarian message of the Shaykhi school, and its treatment of Shi i
eschatology, contributed to the Bab's inner search for identifying his own
spiritual status. Ihese contacts helped the Bab to see his position, his methods,
and his 'inspirations' in the broader prospect of Shi'i-Shaykhi theophany.

On the other hand, it seems as though during his residence in 'Atabat, the
impact which the Bab had on the students of the Shaykhi circle, was considerable.
To some members in the circle who, under the influence of Shaykhi ideas, were
seeking a new 'holy man', the young uneducated pious and 'innocent' Sayyid 'All

had a special appeal. This visit to 'Atabat seems to have originated
many later conversions among the students and other followers alike, who saw in
the person and in the behaviour of the Bab, some exceptional qualities which
equipped him for extraordinary claims.

CHAPTER FOUR

The Emergence of the Babi Movement

> The death of Sayyid Kazim Rashti on llth Dhu al-Hijja 1259 (1st January
1844) marked the end of the second stage in the development of the Shaykhi

school . Even before his death, the problem of his succession, and the hidden
struggle between the conflicting factions, had caused some frictions within the
circle of his intimate followers. Rashti's reluctance to acknowledge any of his
disciples as his permanent successor accelerated the process of dissolution in
the Shaykhi school.   His hesitation was partly due to his emphasis on the
messianic revelation, and partly the result of his frustration in the tense
environment of *Atabat.   This process was further intensified by the very
internal conflict in the school, which prevented him from deciding on any of
his students as the sole leader 3 .

The high regard felt for Rashti by his followers also to large extent
prevented them from subordinating themselves to the authority of the new
leader, unless they should observe in him the right signs and qualities, which
they believed had been often meticulously described by Sayyid Kazim. It was

not just the academic ties, but a sense of spiritual devotion which bound them
to their late teacher, elevating him to the position of Rukn—i Rabi^ and
Babiyat. The emphasis in Rashti f s teachings on 'imminence of the Revelation 1
(qurb-i Zuhur) , and his occasional hints of the occurrence of critical events
in the near future, encouraged some disciples, in spite of the wishes of the
'moderate' faction, to search for the unknown leader after Rashti's death.
In the last years of his life, Rashti's effort to preserve the unity of the
school by advising his students to guard their 'unity and integrity' in case
of his death, and by appointing a temporary or caretaker head, did not prevent
an inevitable breach.

These doubts and confusions were further intensified by the premature
death of Rashti, still in his late fifties.   Yet, two of the early sources,
Qatil Karbala'i and Mulla Ja^far Qazvlni, both agree that some time before

3-   Dalll al-Mutahayyirln, op.cit. pp.51 ff. cf. ;/£. 100-3; Nabil. 36-40;
MJQ. pp.461-3*.

Rashti had temporarily set Mulla Hasan Gauhar over the students in Atabat,

while affirming that the day when they would hear of the advent of the 'Promised
One 1 was at hand :

> 'Then someone asked, "After you, with whom should we
> take refuge?" He (Sayyid Kazim) replied "With none,
> for it is not permitted (bi, akadZ jayiz no). Stay for
> a few days around Mulla Hasan Gauhar, God shall not
> leave you in darkness. The Truth (Haqq) is bound to
> appear". Then he confirmed that Mulla Hasan f s leader­
> ship would not exceed forty-five days, and at the end
> of that period He would appear to enlighten the world
> with the eternal beauty of his light'2.
But in spite of Rashti's strong advice to Mirza Muhit Kirmani and Gauhar
against personal rivalries and sectarianism3 , disagreement over the future of
the school was bound to happen. As Gauhar was assumed to be the executor of
Rashti's will (vasty) , Mirza Muhit claimed to be the supervisor and the guardian
of Rashti's family (nazir) ; claims which in those uncertain times encouraged them
to assume some spiritual  leadership for themselves 4 . Nevertheless, since neither
of them, owing to his personal character and his conciliatory attitude was
capable of satisfying that group of the students who were in search for a
charismatic 'guide', they both failed to attract any serious following. Qatil
relates that after a few weeks, when they were reminded of Rashti's promises of
the nearness of Zuhur, Gauhar denied any previous references to it in Rashti's

words, whereas Muhit replied: 'I remember something, but he (i.e. Rashti) did
not say that he would appear immediately. Therefore, it is your duty not to be
dispersed from Karbila', and make it known amongst people that many claimants
are not justified in their claims, since our master said that "the cause will
appear a year after me'" . Qatil then points out that such an attitude, though
for a few months it persuaded the students to remain in Karbila', eventually
disillusioned them with Muhit and Gauhar, and thus they left Karbila' for various
destinations .

fying their own claims.

But if Mirza Muhit and Mulla Hasan Gauhar by their conciliatory attitude

and their disregard for the messianic side of Shaykhi teachings, tried to
minimise their differences with the fuqaha', and thus continued Shaykhism more
as a teaching circle in 'Atabat, another contestant in Kirman, Haji Muhammad
Karim Khan Kirmani, tended to create a new independent centre for Shaykhism
away from the conflicts in ^Atabat. Thanks to his family wealth and influence
in Kirman, which put him in an advanced place above the other students, and also
owing to his talent and intelligence, especially in popularising Shaykhism
almost to the level of a religious 'sect', Karim Khan was able to establish
himself not so much as a messianic leader, but as a respectable head of a 'sect'.
Though in theory he heavily relied on the authority of the Shaykh Ahmad and

Sayyid Kazim

to justify his own claims, in reality he was only satisfying a
need for leadership in a city which had long been torn by sectarianism.
Of course this did not prevent him from claiming a broader leadership over the
whole Shaykhi community including students in 'Atabat. The propaganda of a
certain Sayyid Ovii Kirmani, Rashti's secretary and one of the influential
figures in the circle, who as Qatil alleges, had forged a visal'i'h in the name
of Sayyid Kazim to justify Karim Khan's succession,at least temporarily
attracted the attention of some Shaykhi followers in Karbila* .

Similarly to Muhit and Gauhar, Karim Khan also failed to attract the bulk
of Shaykhi students, not only because he was away from 'Atabat and in far
distant Kirman, but because his personal 'conservative' attitude as well as his
Qajar background, prevented him from being the ideal 'Bab' and the 'spiritual
guide' for those who were already charged with millenarianism. Indeed the
reluctance of any of the three figures to comply with the messianic expectations,
left those who were expecting the Zuhur

with the only other alternative offered
by Mulla Husain Bushruyihi. No matter what the real intentions of Rashti in
his allusions to Zuhur were, for Mulla Husain and those who followed him in his

search, the emergence of an unconventional and, by any standard superior figure,
was the ultimate aim. When Mulla Husain arrived in Karbila* from Khurasan,
after a year of absence from ^Atabat, just after Rashti's death, he must have
decided at least on his rejection of any conventional claim of succession
coming from the ex-students. In discussion with Gauhar and Muhit,•   •

he expressed
his commitment to the promises of Rashti, but the intentions of the two
'moderate* Shaykhis were far less ambitious. They had resolved to stay in
Karbila*, and eventually occupy Rahsti's place .

Mulla Husain on the other hand represented a more radical and uncompro-

raising attitude. If Gauhar and Muhit  were fearful of the number and strength

of the 'enemies' of the Shaykhis and thus preferred to remain in Karbila 5 and
'guard the vacant seat' of Rashti, he inclined to fulfil a more idealistic
mission which he believed to be in contrast with any further scholastic and
academic endeavour. His life and character exemplify many features which were
shared by many who had similar intentions.

Mulla Muhammad Husain, the elder son of a small landowner and cloth-dyer,

was born in the hamlet of Zirak near Bushruyih, a small agricultural town on
the edge of the Khurasan desert, around 1229 Q./ 1813-14. His father Haji•

Mulla (Abdallah Sabbagh originally came from Yasar (outside Bushruyih) and

'owned land and property' . He was a relatively affluent man, and possessed

a number of shops in which he employed some of his relatives . The title
Sabbagh (cloth dyer) suggests that perhaps this was his main profession, while

the title Mulla indicates a religious status, possibly a part-time engagement
as leader of prayers in a local mosque. He was brought up in his native town

where he received his early education in the local religious madrasih . Later
he was sent to Mashhad to study in Madrasih Mirza Ja ''far , probably to fulfil
his parents' ambitions that he should become a religious man. His mother was a
source of encouragement to him and had a personal interest in his education.
She was 'a knowledgeable poet' of some talent who 'enjoyed respect amongst
people' .

He left Bushruyih around 1241 (1826-7) when he was a child of twelve .
In Mashhad, like many other Khurasani tullab,  he studied under Sayyid Muhammad

Qasir Razavi, himself a student of Bihbahani and Bahr al-^tllum and a well known
— on the authority of Qasir's
mudai>i"is in the city 8 . Qatil,                           son, states that in

Perhaps his decision to study in ^Atabat came not only as a result of a general
tradition of following higher studies in the teaching circles of Najaf and
Karbila', but also from specific plans to attend Sayyid Kazim's discourses. But

before setting out for 'Atabat, he returned to his home town around 1248 (1832-3),
primarily to seek his father's permission. In Bushruyih he was enthusiastically
received by the local governor who urged him to stay in town presumably to take
a religious position which he declined to accept, and eventually he headed
towards f'Atabat sometime about 1251 (1835-6) 4 . In Tehran, he heard of his
father's death, returned to Bushruyih, sold some of his father's possessions,
and then set out for ''Atabat .

His growing interest in Shaykhism seems to be not unconnected with his
personal experiences. If the account of some of the sources could be relied
upon, even in his early youth, Mulla Husain apparently had some curious dreams

c                       •
of the Prophet , which later was followed by 'strange spiritual behaviour'
(atvar-i
ruhiyih4gharibih)

; a remark which may be taken as indication of his
mystical preoccupation. When still in Isfahan, it was his striving to acquire
'knowledge' (.^-ilm) and pass the 'stages of mysticism' (maqamat-'C ^r/an) which

g
seems to have attracted his attention to Shaykhism . These early interests
have some significance in his later career. Like some other Khurasani students
who later converted to the Babi movement, and some of whom were Mulla Husain's

fellow students, Bushruyihi came from Quhistan in central Khurasan, which
because of its past history was known for heterodox, and particularly crypto-
IsmaTli ideas, which in one form or another had survived in the shape of
common beliefs if not in well defined theories 9 .

In fAtabat, Mulla Husain joined the Shaykhi circle in Karbila'. He seems

to have exclusively studied with Sayyid Kazim since there is no evidence to

suggest his pupilship under any other teacher. Soon, as Qatil reports, he
distinguished himself amongst the Shaykhi tullab by demonstrating considerable
skill in the study of the Shaykhi texts to the extent that he was entrusted
with the task of supervising the junior students and dealing with some of
Rashti's correspondence. Qatil takes particular care to point out that his
position amongst the students was superior both in knowledge and steadfastness
and in order not to be accused of exaggerating on Bushruyihi's personality, he
then gives as witness the names of a number of Shaykhis who either studied with
him various Shaykhi texts, or regarded him as a trustworthy and dedicated

student . Amongst them, many Khurasanis such as Mulla *Abd al-Khaliq Yazdi,
Mulla Muhammad     T .    -       - -              -3
.     Taqi Hiravi and Mirza Ahmad

.    Azghandi  and Arabs such as Sayyid
'Ali Bushr, Shaykh Bashir Najafi and Shaykh Ahmad Shakur Najafi were later
converted to the Babi movement 4 . This may be taken as an indication of the
significance of previous personal relations in the later formation of the Babi
network.

While in 'Atabat, Mulla Husain compiled two long works and a number of
tracts and apologetical treatises in the Shaykhi tradition 5 . One work, Shark
Sura al-Kawthar, which was a commentary in Shaykhi style received Rashti's
high commendation. His praises of Mulla Husain on the pulpit induced many

Shaykhis to think that perhaps Mulla Husain was the successor to Rashti. The
circulation of such speculations compelled Mulla Husain openly to deny any

particular claim . Of what have survived of his writings however, there is an
Arabic commentary on messianic akhbar (compiled in Qazvln circa 1262-3/1846-7)
which argues mostly on the basis of various Shi^i works such as Kitab al-^Awalim

1\.   Qatil. (521) particularly refers to Lawami^ al-Husayrilya by Rashti (Tabriz,

traditions which emphasise the role of the Persians and particularly Khurasanis

-                            _ 9

in assisting the Qa'im at the event of his Khuruj . Judging by the quality of
this work, which was written on the eve of the Babi uprising of Tabarsi,

perhaps to justify the public call for the gathering of the Babis in Khurasan,
one may assume that Mulla Husain was well versed in Shi Oi. traditions. His

preoccupation with messianic traditions no doubt was not an isolated case.
Considering the extent to which Rashti and his students were interested in this
matter, one may suspect that most of Bushruyihi's writings were on the same
theme.
In Karbila' Mulla Husain  lived the humble life of a devoted talabih.

As

Mulla Husain

Dakhil Maraghihl, who was an intimate friend of Bushruyihi in
Karbila* relates, for their living expenses they were dependent on copying

Shaykh Ahmad's

works   . Another report confirms that, while in Isfahan, for
seven months Mulla Husain  lived entirely on his own personal labour. 'He was

working one day a week as a hired labourer while he was living contentedly

and mostly fasting' . This may suggest that apparently there was no customary
pension for Mulla Husain even in his mission to Isfahan on the instruction of
Rashti5 .
Another characteristic of Mulla Husain  which is mentioned by most sources

was his physical condition. Qatil indicates that when he first arrived in
Karbila', he suffered from bad health . Nuqtat al-Kaf reports the trembling

Furughi rejected the idea which was put forward by Raudat al-Safa that Mulla
Husain had 'in his early youth been instructed in the art of swordsmanship' and
'that he acquired his proficiency only after a considerable period of training' 4 .
Furughi affirmed:

Bushruyihi was an ardent supporter and admirer of Rashti who seems to have
had a magnetic influence on him as on many other of his students and followers.
This personal charisma was a crucial factor in absorbing tullab into the Shaykhi
circle and charging them with enthusiasm and zeal, since only Rashti's affection
and care for his adherents could compensate for the lack of financial reward, or
even more crucial, the humiliation and persecution which they suffered at the
hands of the Balasaris. However, as factional harassment and anti-Shaykhi
allegations intensified, particularly towards the end of Rashti's life, and hence
Sayyid Kazim became more isolated amongst the high ranking 'ulama, his reliance

on the support of his students and followers increased .

Iran and Iraq .  To be more effective however, it required the approval of Mulla

-         r2        T
Muhammad Baqir Shafti . Shafti, who saw the consequences of sanctioning such a

fatva and for a variety of reasons did not want the total separation of Shaykhism
from the body of the Shi *i orthodoxy, decided to postpone his ratification,
appending it to the reply to a letter he despatched to Rashti inviting him to
Isfahan to defend Shaykhis . This encouraged Sayyid Kazim to approach Shafti

with the intention of 'securing the support and good will 1 of Shafti since he
rightly thought that Shafti's friendship might well protect him against the
opposition of the Balasaris of (Atabat.
Rashti designated Mulla Husain to represent him in Isfahan. In this appoint-

ment, he perhaps considered    the  delicacy of the mission since neither Mulla Hasan

Gauhar, who had once been nominated to present the Shaykhi case to the jurists

4          -      -        - -                                          5
of Najaf , nor Mulla Muhit    Kirmani  who himself volunteered for this mission was

chosen. Rashti's reluctance to travel himself to Isfahan, may be explained by
his apprehension that his presence might have provoked further controversy and in
turn influenced Shafti's decision to ratify the fatva. This would have caused
him humiliation and disrepute. It was with this consideration that Mulla Husain

was assigned to return to Iran. Although there is no reference to confirm that
he acquired his ijazih for ijtihad , yet it is possible to assume that having
spent more than nine years in 'Atabat , he had finished his studies and was him­
self willing to return to his homeland.
Mulla Husain's appearance at Shafti's lecture in Isfahan in his long Arab

shirt, tattered and ragged from the hardships of his journey, attracted
considerable attention . For three days he privately conversed with Shafti about

the 'heretical beliefs' which were alleged in the proposed fatva .       In these
sessions, Mulla Husain
argued the Shaykhi viewpoints

on 'the eternal presence
and the unceasing vigilance of the Imam' and discredited the accusations of
holding extremist views (ghuluv) on the authority of Rukn-i Rabi^ .       As almost
all the sources agree, his argument was convincing enough to oblige Shafti to
deny his backing for the takfir . Instead, he tore up the fatva and invited
Mulla Husain to address the public on the subject of the Shaykhi beliefs . He

also wrote a conciliatory letter to Rashti in which he praised Ahsa'i by calling
him 'Sayyid al- fUlama" . When Mulla Husain clarified the Shaykhis' position

from the pulpit by reading from Dalil al-Mutahayyirin and discussed the views of

Ahsa'i and Rashti, it is reported that Shafti himself applauded him for his

"                    6                    —
courage and obedience . As it was Shafti's custom to give financial assistance
to tullab
and 'possessor of knowledge' , Mulla Husain

was also offered a bonus
of one hundred tumans which he sent back with the retort: 'We nourish your soul

8      —
for the sake of God; we seek from you neither recompense nor thanks' . Qatil
reports that when he left Isfahan for Khurasan without notice, Shafti sent after
him and invited him to return to Isfahan g .
No doubt in addition to Mulla Husain's impressive performance, there were

other influential elements in Shafti's decision to quash the fatva. His long and
intimate friendship with Haji Mulla Ibrahim Karbasi may have effected this move

Finally one may suspect that his close relation with Shaykhi merchants such as
the Nahris in Isfahan might have prevented him from allowing any drastic rejection
of the Shaykhi school .

Shafti's cooperation was an important victory for the Shaykhis. The Bab's
reference in DaVcf ll-i, Sab'ah to Mulla Husain's achievement in Isfahan indicates
the admiration and respect which he received as a result of this mission:

> 'You yourself know the first believer (a reference to
> Mulla Husain) whose knowledge and virtue is acknowledged
by Shaykhi and Sayyidi (i.e. the followers of Rashti)

'ulama as well as by the others. When I arrived at

Muhammad Blqir who was the greatest divine in that land' .

This success no doubt promoted Mulla Husain's position in the eyes of Rashti"

and his students and in due course gave him a greater say in the future of the
movement. In a letter addressed to Mulla Husain in Mashhad, presumably in reply
to the report of his activities in Isfahan, Rashti greatly appreciated his efforts.
Calling him his brother, Sayyid Kazim, who was clearly delighted with the
performance of his student, states:

> 'You have revealed the truth and rooted out the forces
> of falsehood. This is greater for you than all the
> devotions and prayers since all these are subsidiary

indicate the degree of attention paid by Rashti to this mission. Bushruyihi's
interview with Mirza-yi ^Asgari, the influential mujtahids of Mashhad, was indeed
in compliance with the same explanatory mission .

While returning from his home town Bushruyih, to 'Atabat some time in the
last days of 1259 or early days of Muharram 1260, he learned of Rashti f s death in

_    — 2                           *       —
Kirmanshah . He immediately set out for ^Atabat and arrived there shortly after ^ .
No particular indication is given of the reason for his hasty return to Karbila',
but one may suspect that counting himself amongst the senior students of Rashti,
he felt committed to participate in the debate concerning the future of the
Shaykhi school. Frequent indications in Rashti's discourses regarding the near­
ness of the Time, no doubt, made the issue far more important than that of a
conventional succession in an academic or even a Sufi circle. Unlike Haji
Muhammad Karim Khan and a few of the other senior students of Rashti who estab­
lished themselves in various centres, Bushruyihi was not willing to settle, and
indeed, as became more apparent in the course of the next few months, he was
opposed to the continuation of any academic pursuit. Thus his return to 'Atabat
was not with the intention of occupying Rashti's place. Neither was he prepared
to yield to the authority of any other of the students. He was a firm and
resolute man with the dedication and zeal of a millenarian. He was a good
orator, a knowledgeable student of Shaykhism and a sharp and astute man in his
relations with others. He perhaps did not clearly know what he wanted, but he
certainly knew what he was prepared to reject. Equally, he never wished to assume
any independent position or authority for himself, not out of modesty or lack of
self-confidence, but because he did not believe that either he or any of the
others around him possessed the qualities that could match the ideal type which
the teachings of Rashti and Ahsa'i portrayed in his mind. He had lived long
enough in Karbila* to know the shortcomings and weaknesses of his colleagues and
was fairminded enough to realise his own imperfections. The very essence of
messianism no doubt perpetuated these 'high expectations' 4 . For him, as for
those who later joined him, the idealised image of the guide or leader was still
not fully developed in their minds, but yet they were certain that he should not
be sought in the madrasahs of ^Atabat.

On his return to Karbila', Mulla Husain found himself faced with a situation

which encouraged him to propose a clear guide line. He no doubt enjoyed some
degree of popularity and support amongst those students who, after being dis­
illusioned with Gauhar and Muhit, were prepared to comply with Mulla Husain f s
view that they should seek the advent of the 'Promised One'. Amid the confusion
and disagreement which prevailed after Rashti, Mulla Husain stressed the earlier
advice of the late teacher 'to quit their homes, scatter far and wide, purge
their hearts from every ideal desire, and dedicate themselves to the quest of
Him' . This idea had some significance for those students who 'pledged their
loyalty and obedience' to Mulla Husain . But in spite of their support, Mulla
Husain seems to have realised that if he ever wished to realise his intentions,
he would not be able to do so in Karbila' where he encountered the apathy, if not
the opposition, of other senior students. This became more apparent to him during
his two month stay in Karbila' (Muharram and Safar 1260/January-February 1844) ,
where he witnessed quarrels, allegations and petty conflicts which were in progress
between different rival factions for succeeding Rashti and establishing teaching

circles . His decision to leave Karbila' for Najaf and on the way to retire in
the mosque of Kufah for a period of one arba*in (forty days), was to make his
position clear both to his supporters and to those who did not approve of his
messianic expectations .

Accompanied by his brother Mulla Hasan, he started his retirement (i^tikaf)
with prayers and contemplation 5 . But soon he was joined by other Shaykhi students
who acknowledged Mulla Husain f s symbolic gesture in his 'search' for the 'Perfect
Shi'i 1 . Some individually, and some in the company of other senior students such
as Mulla ^Ali Bastami and Mulla Yusuf Ardabili arrived in Kufah . Although
neither the identity nor the number of all the participants is clear, it is
almost certain that between fifteen to twenty Shaykhis attended the

.     This was a considerable success for Bushruyihi who in this way managed
to attract attention and outmanoeuvre the other claimants in Karbila' at the time
when according to Qat-il the Shaykhis were 'disillusioned and discontented with
the activities and manners' of both Muhit and Gauhar and hence 'were scattered
to the wind in the deserts and wastelands and resided in the shrines and mosques' .

The practice of j, ^tikaf was not unprecedented for Mulla Husain and his
associates.     In its literal sense, i, ^tikaf meant 'prayer and suffering of an
ascetic in a mosque' and its essence was described as abstinence (imsdk) , assertion
(isba€) and mortification (-ihldk) .    It was regarded as a means or method for
investigating the Truth by abstinence from all desires, assertion of Haqq and

desctruction of falsehood . In practice, it was a period of devotion, nightly
vigilance, fasting and abstinence from food.      Though in its origin it was a Sufi
practice, it was also widely common amongst Shaykhis and indeed amongst many
other non-Shaykhi ^ulama.     Both Ahsa'i and Rashti are known to have had similar

experiences.     On a few occasions Q-isas al-fylama' reports on Shaykh Ahmad's
strict asceticism (riyazat) •    It states on the authority of Sayyid Kazim that

Ahsa'i retired for forty arba^ins in order to be able to reach a high spiritual
state . This practice had also a precedent in Ahsa'i' s teacher Sayyid Mahdi Bahr
al- uium, who in his retirement in the mosque of Sahlah in Kufah, is reported to
have had visions of the Qa'im and sometimes even to have conversed with him about
his problems in jurisprudence .     As far as Mulla Husain himself is concerned,

there are indications that he also had previous experiences of i^tikaf. Mulla
Ja *f ar Qazvini in his first visit to ^Atabat had witnessed an earlier retirement
of Mulla Husain in Kufah .

The exceptional sanctity of the ruined mosque of Kufah, where ^Ali was
struck with a poisoned sword in 39 A.H. (656), made it a      suitable place for

n

the occurrence of messianic events at the Final Day . The Shi ^i dhadlt'h  foretold

the appearance of the Mahdi in Kufah in order   to avenge the persecution and the

_<5

wrong suffered there by the house of ^Ali . This aspect was underlined in the
Shaykhi teachings. Even in a popular work such as Hayat    al-Nafs, on the subject

of the 'return of the believers' souls to their bodies' on the Day of Ressurection,
Shaykh Ahmad states:

> '... and then they (i.e. the believers) will arrive at
> the Vadi al-Salam behind Kufah and will remain there
> till the end of the Day (lit. beginning of sunset) ...
> and those who died in this world will return to be
> killed anew, and thus God will raise Muhammad and his
> descendants from the earth and revive mankind for
> forty days '^.

That is the reason for the many holy dreams and visitations of the Imam in the
Kufah mosque throughout Shi^i history. In this meeting place, it was always
hoped, a visit from the Qa'im would take place, in dream or in vision, or at
least some indication of his presence could be sensed. For Shaykhis like Mulla
Husain and his companions this was not a far-fetched and irrational idea. For

them the presence of the Qa'im was an undisputable fact and so was his contact
with those who were seriously and faithfully searching for him. Indeed Haji

Mirza Jani maintains that it was according to Rashti's instruction and with regard
to his teachings that Mulla Husain entered seclusion in Kufah .

However, the precedence of i tikaf amongst Shaykhis and the emphasis on Kufah
in the traditions, may be taken as secondary motives for Mulla Husain, whose

primary intention for the retirement was to gather a coherent body of Shaykhi

students who could identify themselves with a common goal. The significance of
this experience lay in the fact that it provided an opportunity for the group to
embark upon the task of searching for the 'Perfect Shi^i'. It was the existence
of this collective consciousness that allowed Mulla Husain to put his views

across and share them with the others. The days of retirement in Kufah are
wrapped in ambiguity to an extent that prevents us from reaching any definite
conclusion. Yet there are some indications which allow us to speculate on the
motives which finally resulted in the departure of Mulla Husain

and his followers
for Iran in mid Rabif al-Thani 1260.

Most Babi sources either simply give no explanation for the departure or,
not surprisingly, attribute it to some supernatural inspiration. Qatil, for
instance, states that Mulla Husain remained in retirement in Kufah till he was

put out of his patience 'and then after visiting the Shrine in Karbila', set out

1                      2                — 3
towards his destination* , whereas Qurrat al-^Ayn and Nuqtat al-Kaf both imply
that his departure came after an intuitive awareness which he acquired in his
prayers and asceticism. This may suggest that in spite of their proximity to the
time of the event, the authors of the above accounts had no clear knowledge of
Mulla Husain's

intentions. Equally, one may assume that indeed there was no
clear motive for Mulla Husain's journey to Iran. However, Mirza Ahmad

Ishik

Aqasi, on the authority of a certain unnamed Shaykhi who claimed to have been
present in Kufah, believes that Mulla Husain's decision was related to Rashti's

4       r -
earlier instructions . Mirza Ahmad quoted the Shaykhi student as saying:

> 'We were a large body who accompanied MullI Husain every­
> where and it was our belief that after the death of Haji
> Sayyid Kazim the leadership of the Shaykhi sect would be
> vested in Mulla Husain, because we did not know anyone

Two days later one of the adherents arrived there and

Although the narrator of this account does not agree with other sources on
the time and duration of -i^tikaf, all other details indicate that this is a
genuine account given by someone who was present at Kufah. A few lines below,
the same account makes it clear that indeed, as Mulla Husain himself confessed

later, he was not ordered to travel to Kirman but to Fars: 'and since I did not
anticipate seeing anyone in Fars' says Mulla Husain to his followers, 'I presumed
that my destination was Kirman 1 . This may suggest that either there was a clear
instruction from Rashti, regarding travel to Fars, of which Mulla Husain became
aware after the former's death, or more likely there were allusions in the letter
which were interpreted by Mulla Husain as instructions for travel to Iran.

Though the tone of the above account tends to suggest that at the time Mulla
was unaware of the possibility of meeting anyone in Fars, one may still
think that his apparent intention to visit Kirman was a purely tactical move in
order to convince others of the necessity of undertaking such a journey. It is
hard to believe - as indeed almost all the available evidence suggests the
opposite - that Mulla Husain was prepared to accept Haji Muhammad Karim Khan's
authority, since he had already rejected the claims of the others in ^Atabat.
Mulla Muhammad Taqi Hashtrudi particularly takes care to point out that Kirman
was only 'the apparent destination' of Mulla Husain 3 . Similarly, the accounts
given by Nabil Zarandi and Qatil about the lack of support for Karim Khan amongst
the Shaykhi students 4 suggest that Mulla Husain was not particularly keen to

visit Kirman.

1\.   Ahmad. 448 n.                      2.   Ibid.
3\.   Abwab al-Huda' cited in TMS. 56.
4\.   Nabil. pp.39-40 citing the account of Shaykh Abu Turlb Ishtihardi.

However, the matter appears to be even more engimatic when another passage
in Qatil's narrative is considered. Here the author describes the activities of
the above mentioned Mulla (Ali Kirmani who because of his hostility to Mulla Hasan

Gauhar over the execution of Rashti's will, canvassed the succession of Karim
Khan with the help of a tract which he allegedly forged in the name and the style
of Rashti . In this visala^ as we were told by Qatil, Karim Khan was praised in
highest terms. He was described as (the one who is aware of the*Point of Knowledge'
and admired as the 'most deserving of the students' through whom the others must
seek guidance . Mul-la 'Ali later admitted to this forgery and because of it was
forced to flee to Mecca, but at the time, the publication of this risala, as
Qatil maintains, created some excitement amongst the Shaykhis and 'was one of the

reasons for some to go to Shiraz with the intention of travelling to Kirman' .
On the basis of this account two points may be raised. First, perhaps even the
letter which was delivered to Mulla Husain in Kufah was no more than this very

forged tract, since both the letter and the forged tract enhance the position of
Karim Khan as the source for seeking guidance. Secondly, the rumours and
allegations might have encouraged Mulla Husain,    or some of his associates, to

visit Kirman in order to investigate the truth of the claims which apparently
were put forward by Karim Khan in his dispatches to the Shaykhi ''ulama of
of Kazimayn . Qatil alleges that even in these letters he claimed to be 'the
- . * bi at-Amr who appeared after being                         .5
Qa'im                                      concealed from the public' .

But in addition to these 'apparent intentions', there are other indications
which might be taken as the signs of a vague attention to Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad

in Shiraz. If not Mulla Husain     himself, at least some of his friends and

colleagues had already become acquainted with the Bab, and reportedly were
impressed by him at the time of his pilgrimage to ^Atabat . Furthermore, the
letter by the Bab cited in the previous chapter, which was written in late 1259
and hinted at a connection between him and some unknown tufiab and the possibility

of a 'revelation 1 in the near future, may also be taken into account . However,
the significance of this probable contact should not be exaggerated, since the
later behaviour of Mulla Husain   in Shiraz proved that if indeed there had been a

previous acquaintance, or even intention to visit him, it certainly was not with

any clear idea of his acclaimed position.

II

On his return to Iran, Mulla Husain apparently was ahead of other Shaykhi
tullab who seemed to be still engaged in the forty days retirement 1 . Accompanied

by his brother and his cousin, he arrived in Bushihr via Basrah.  After a short
stay there, he reached Shiraz some time in late Rabi C al-Thani or early Jumada
al-Ula' 1260 (mid May 1844). The other tullab followed him shortly afterwards
on the same route. There, they met Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad and after recognising
him as the 'Promised One' (Mounted), formed the first group of his disciples,
later known as Huruf-i Hayy. In spite of its importance in the formation of the
early Babi nucleus and in spite of numerous accounts related by various primary
and secondary sources, still the manner in which Mulla Husain and his companions
were first acquainted with Sayyid (Ali Muhammad is not fully clear.
The Shaykhi student who is quoted by Mirza Ahmad relates that when the whole
party reached the outskirts of Shiraz, they were received by the Abyssinian
servant of Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad at Dukkan Riva, half a farsakh from Shiraz, who
enquired about Mulla Husain:

> 'We pointed him out, and the negro approached Mulla Husain
> and stopped him, whispering certain words in his ears
while he remained on his horse. We saw Mulla Husain

•    dis-
> mount, his attitude greatly changed. He made the negro

> what we should do, and the negro told us to go to the

> went in, and there we saw Mulla Husain sitting most

sayyid's house, giving us another residence'-3 .

_                                  -           - -4
Nabil Zarandi, on the other hand, (citing Mulla Ahmad Qazvini who relates
the story from Mulla Husain himself) maintains that Mulla Husain met the Bab
accidentally outside the city gates in the afternoon of the 5th Jumada al-Ula'
(22nd May) while The New History (citing Haji Mirza Jani who relates it from

Mulla (&bd al-Wahhab Khurasani who heard it from Mulla Husain)

states that since
Mulla Husain was previously acquainted with Sayyid GUi Muhammad in ^Atabat, he
'at once on reaching Shiraz sought out his abode' and was received with
hospitality . Mulla Ja^far Qazvini on the other hand relates from Mulla ^Abd
al-Jalil Urumi who was himself present in Shiraz, that Sayyid fAli Muhammad first

_                                                                  *
attended Mulla Husain 1 s lectures on Shark al-Ziyara in the mosque of Vakil in
Shiraz. Once in the course of these lectures, Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad asked him:
'If someone expounded better than you, what would you say?'. Mulla Husain
answered: 'I will obey and listen'. Then Sayyid ^All Muhammad asked what would
his reaction be if one expounded better than Rashti and even Ahsa'i himself, to
which question Mulla Husain
.       gave the same reply. Then Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad
presented him with some of his writings. 'Immediately after reading them',
recalls Urumi, 'he was overwhelmed and deeply moved. But the Bab advised him to

2                 -              -         - -
conceal his emotions' . Finally Mulla Muhammad Taqi Hashtrudi relates that having
a brief acquaintance from the days of Karbila', they again met each other in the
lectures of a certain mudarris in Shiraz. There, Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad gradually
introduced Mulla Husain to his ideas and claims 3 .

The discrepancy and confusion in these five accounts are typical of much of
the available information on the 'proclamation' (izhar-i amr) of the Bab and the
formation of the early circle. But this should not be regarded merely as the
inaccuracy of the sources. More probably, it should be attributed to a somewhat
deeper problem in the formation of the first Babi nucleus and its treatment by
the sources. Some later sources such as Nabil constantly tried to give a super­
natural sense to their accounts in order to make it more comparable to the
traditional concept of izhar-i amr prevailing in their minds. Such treatment no
doubt puts emphasis on extraordinary aspects while disregarding, if not deliber­
ately neglecting, the actual process of events. Furthemore, Mulla Husain himself
was the origin of most of the existing accounts, and this implies that perhaps his
later attitudes and sympathies after 'conversion' had influenced his narration and
led him to explain the 'proclamation' in terms of 'divine will' 4 . The relevant

accounts also suffer from the secrecy and concealment adopted by the Bab and
early believers throughout the early stages of the movement .

Taking into account all the confusions and disagreements, it is still
possible however to render a relatively plausible version of the process which
eventually resulted in the formation of the movement. It is almost certain that
even if Mulla Husain had a vague image of Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad

•      as an exceptionally
holy man, he had no previous intention of visiting him with the purpose of finding
in him the 'Promised One 1 for whom he was searching. Their encounter might not
have been accidental, but still, even on the part of Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad, there

was no clear intention of 'proclaiming' his 'mission', especially to Mulla Husain

Bushruyihi. What is certain however, is that prior to this encounter and following
his earlier dreams and intuitions , Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad became more and more

convinced that he was divinely inspired and that after Rashti he was to become
the 'place of descent' (mahbit-i v<zhy) and 'source of divine emanation'.

•     t
'Nineteen days before the commencement of the revelation, he (i.e. Rashti) joined
the Heavenly Host (Mala 3 —£ A^la) and the beginning of 1260 was the time when the
secret was first revealed' 3 . Then, sometime after, he became fully aware of
these 'revelations'. 'In truth, the first day that the spirit descended in the
heart of this slave, was the fifteenth of the month of Rabi' al-Awwal f . His
image of the mission which he believed was entrusted to him is illustrated in a
khutba on the commentary on Sura al-Baqara, one of his earliest works:

> '0, My Lord! You instructed me on the day when I started
> composing this book. Verily I saw, on that night in a

The allusions in this dream not only tend to explain the new claims by the
announcement of the Rashti's death, but also hints at the termination of the

"Atabat era which in his view is concurrent with the commencement of the new
'dispensation*.

With a remarkable self-reliance which perhaps sprang from his confidence in
the authenticity of his 'inspirations', he met with Mulla Husain.       First with

allegorical remarks and then with complete clarity he announced his claim. His
manner, words and writings make us believe that indeed he was sincere in his
inner convictions. Such conviction had a special meaning for those Shaykhis who
were expectant for some sort of 'revelation' since throughout the course of these
early encounters, the spirit of messianism which dominated over the claimant as
well as the converts, was a decisive factor in the occurrence of conversions.
The account recorded by Haji Mirza Jani demonstrates the process by which this

anticipation had become explicit when Mulla Husain   first conversed with Sayyid

Ali Muhammad in the upper chamber of the latter's house. Mulla Husain

himself

related that first the Bab asked him: '"Whom do you now recognise as your
Master"? "As yet", Mulla Husain replied, "we have recognised no one". "What

manner of man", asked he, "must the Master be"? Thereupon I enumerated some of
the requisite qualifications and characteristics. "Do you observe these in me"?
he asked'. To this suggestion Mulla Husain gave a negative answer: 'I see in you
none of these qualities'. Later in the same meeting as Mulla Husain

reported,
he observed a commentary of Suva al-Baqara on the shelf. When he asked about
the author, Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad replied: 'A mere youthful beginner who never-

theless lays claim to a high degree of knowledge and greatness' .
These remarks, as reported by Mulla Husain,

created a torment and inner
struggle in him which lasted for several days. On the one hand, he was impressed
by his host, and on the other hand, he saw in front of him 'a youthful merchant*
who lacked theological training even to the extent that he could not correctly
read the verses of Sura al-Baqara to which he claimed to have written a

insistence on the traditional conditions set by the Shi 1 prophecies led him
to dispute with the Bab. Aqa Sayyid Mu'min Khurasani related that:

> 'One day in the presence of the Bab-al-Bab (Mulla
> Husain's later title) in Khurasan (probably Mashhad),
> we were passing a theological school (madras^}. He
> looked at the school and recited this verse: "Not one

> realised the meaning of the saying 'knowledge is the
> greatest veil (al-^lm hijab al-akbary through the
> fruits of this ruined place. I wished I had no
> education1 "!.

Such words demonstrate Mulla Husain's contempt for theological values which
he now believed to have been the source of his earlier disregard for the Bab,
though either he or Sayyid Mu'min might have exaggerated its duration. Another
report indicates that, in the course of the Tabarsi upheaval, on a few occasions
Mulla Husain stated: 'I wish my steps had never reached the Madrasih, so I
would never have bothered the Proof of God for three days and nights' 2 .
This difference of opinion has also been observed by Mirza Ahmad's source
who maintains that: 'We could see that there was some difference (of opinion)
between the Sayyid (i.e. the Bab) and Mulla Husain; but at every subsequent
meeting Mulla Husain showed more respect and loyalty (to the Sayyid) than on the
previous occasion 1 3 . Even after the first few meetings with the Bab, Mulla
Husain reported to his friends: 'However, I have not satisfied my mind completely

We must hold several other conversations; and I must obtain full discernment,

4                          - _
for the matter of religion is a difficult one' . To this, Mulla Jalil Urumi
adds that Mulla Husain 'could not sleep the whole night for his inner struggle
and mental occupation' 5 .

However, after overcoming these uncertainties, a short time later, perhaps
as short as three days - as he has been quoted to say - Mulla Husain recognised
the Bab and became his 'First Disciple' (Awwal man Aman). The night of the 5th

Jumada al-Ula* 1260 (22nd May 1844) is set as the formal beginning of the move­
ment, since all the sources confirm that it was on this night that Sayyid ''Ali
Muhammad's claim was fully accepted by Bushruyihi .        Bearing in mind the negative
elements which first prevented Mulla Husain from complying with Sayyid

Muhammad's claims, it should now be asked what motives encouraged him to become

the first believer.
First of all Mulla Husain

and his companions were influenced by a sense of
messianic expectation. As has already been discussed, such anticipation
psychologically prepared them for expecting the 'Promised One 1 to be revealed in
someone who might not fulfil all those extraordinary and often impossible
'conditions' which had long been regarded in Shi ^i circles as 'signs' of the
'Expected One' but could certainly materialise the more realistic and plausible
conditions set by the late Shaykhi- teachers. All through the account given by
Mulla Ahmad Qazvini, symptoms of Mulla Husain   's 'unrelaxing vigilance' and

'singleness of mind' in searching for and identifying the 'Promised One' are
apparent. When Mulla Husain first entered Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad's house he

thought: 'Might not my visit to this house enable me to draw nearer to the object
of my quest? Might it not hasten the period of intense longing, of strenuous

search, of increasing anxiety, which such a quest involves' . Again, when he
stood beside the Bab for prayers he breathed this prayer: 'I have striven with
all my soul, 0 my God, and until now have failed to find thy promised

messenger. I testify that thy word fails not, and that thy promise is sure' .
Even if the tone and the style of the recollections can be attributed to the
terminology which later Mulla Husain adopted to express his enthusiasm, or to

exaggeration of Qazvini or even more probably of Nab-il's sentimental and often
bombastic style, still it is not unrealistic to detect such an attitude in a
person who all through his life had been in search of an ideal guide: first in
Sayyid Kazim Rashti, then in Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad   the Bab and finally in Mulla

•                                   .

Muhammad ''Ali Mazandarani Quddus. The image of the 'Fourth Pillar' as it was
developed in Shaykhi teachings greatly contributed to the picture of this 'ideal'
leader with which Mulla Husain 's mind was particularly preoccupied.

Secondly, for a taldbah like Mulla Husain who had spent all his life in

the isolation of the madrasihs and retirement of the mosques, and whose mental
preoccupation was to study hikmat, hadith and other subjects in the Shaykhi
curriculum, Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad's simplicity had a special appeal. He repre-
sented a totally different background, yet they had enough common points to

3\.       Ibid. 56.

permit a dialogue.  Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad was a man of piety and austerity who

was also occupied with messianic 'revelations'. He also regarded Ahsa'i and

_                                                              •
Rashti with high respect and was interested in their teachings. But beyond that,
in their training, their social background and even their outlook, he and Mulla
Husain represented two different types. But it was this very difference which

was a source of attraction to Mulla Husain and other Shaykhi companions who saw
in the Shirazi merchant unusual 'holiness'. His appearance, his manner, and
his 'hospitality' (muhabbat va lutf-i raftar) were all elements appealing to

Bushruyihi and others.   As Mulla Husain himself recalls, he was 'profoundly

impressed by the gentle yet compelling manner in which that strange youth' spoke
to him . It was 'the music of his voice', 'the radiance of the countenance',
'the expression of affection* 2 and the 'sitting in a most dignified and majestic

attitude' which fascinated him and brought him to the point of 'conversion'.
Indeed this was not an uncommon attraction since, in the course of the next few
years, the Bab's appearance was often one of the most important factors in the
conversion of those believers who chanced to meet him. The picture sketched by
Dr. Cormick, an English physician who visited the Bab in 1264-5 (1848-9) in the
castle of Chihriq in Azarbaijan, helps to explain the impression which he often
made on his visitors. 'He was a very mild and delicate-looking man, rather
small in stature and very fair for a Persian, with a melodious soft voice,
which struck me much. ... In fact his whole look and deportment went far to
dispose one in his favour' .

In a traditional society in which manner, public appearance and physical
features were noted both by the common people and by the educated as a
distinctive part of one's character, it is not surprising that these features
played an important role in arousing loyalty and sympathy towards a messianic
character. The description given of the Qa'im in the Shi^i traditions, idealised
not only the holy lineage and the personal virtues of the Imam, but featured
him as the 'ideal 1 of beauty and perfection.
The third element instrumental in the conversion of Mulla Husain was the
'proofs' (hujaj ) which Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad rendered in justification of his
claims. In this context, the latter basically stressed two points. First, he
emphasised the prophecies of Sayyid Kazim, of which he must have become aware
either at the time of his sojourn in the 'Atabat or later through his Shaykhi

1\.   Ibid. 53.                        2.    Ibid. pp.52-62.

contacts.   Hence, he laid claim to an ambiguous position which throughout the
early encounters was often described as that of the 'Promised One' .      Neither
the Bab nor Mulla Husain have clearly defined the term as though at the time

they were reluctant to refer to any particular title.     It is not implausible
that Sayyid Kazim was also deliberately vague on this point.      However what seems

to be finally agreed upon in these early discussions was that Sayyid (All
Muhammad held a position above what was usually attributed to Rashti. He did

not consider himself only as the successor of Rashti or the head of the Shaykhis
but assumed a position much nearer to a messianic intermediary.      It is with this
consideration that titles like the Bab, the Zik? and alike were adopted. These
positions of Babiyat and ZtkrZyat were assumed with a vague sense of deputyship

or delegation from the Concealed Imam.     Although, as has already been noted, in
some Shaykhi-Babi texts such as Qat-il and the Risal-ih of Qurrat al-^Ayn, Rashti

_    -              2

had also been referred to by the title Baballah al-Muqaddam , it is in regard to
Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad that the title directly points towards the advent of a

messianic revelation in the near future. One may even suspect that the title
Bdballah al-Muqaddam was either in use in a small circle of Shaykhis in the
later years of Rashti and with some implication of the Rukn-i Pabi (', or this
was a title which was given to Rashti by the Babi writers posthumously in order
to provide some sort of viable precedent for Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad's claim. In
either case it was not a widely known title and in fact had a cryptic meaning.
As was to become more apparent to the Shaykhi converts in the course of the next
few years, Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad's aim in assuming Babiyat was different from the
past Shaykhi leaders 3 . It is not unlikely that the adjective Muqaddam (primary,
preliminary) in Rashti 's title was applied with a sense of continuous progress
in revelation. As Sayyid Kazim was believed to be higher in his position of

Babiyat than the 'Four Deputies' (Nuvvab-i Arba^a), so he himself was a
preliminary 'Gate' to the next Bab who would make his stand public  . The same
consideration, it appears, was Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad's motive in conferring the

title of Bab al-Bab (the Gate of the Gate) on his first follower. Hence Mulla

1\.   Nabil. 57 cf. NH. 35, calling himself Sahib-i Amr and Akmad. 449 n. 'the

True One'.

2\.   See above Chapter One, I.
3\.   See below.
4\.   Qurrat al- rAyn (Tahirih), RisaUh, Z. (493).

Husain also would be the preliminary 'Gate' for access to the Bab . Although it
is arguable that this title was given to Mulla Husain in the early stage, never-
theless it signifies the high position he held in the later process of the
announcement of the movement.

The second point put forward by the Bab as 'proof of his veracity was his
writing and especially his assumed skill and efficiency in producing and
compiling numerous works. This was the most positive 'proof he continuously
furnished up to the end of his life as the obvious miracle of his 'mission'.
No doubt, this was a 'proof postulated with direct attention to the saying of
the Quran that the 'Book' which is 'sent down' to the Prophet is the 'sign' (ayat)

from God . In response to Mulla Husain's

demand, he first replied to some
questions raised in a short tract which Bushruyihi had written previously on
some Shaykhi topics. Then he wrote a commentary on Sura al-Yusuf, later known
as Qayyum al-Asma* , which is one of his most important works of the early period.
As it is reported, on the night of the 5th Jumada al-Ula* he compiled the first
chapter of the commentary known as Sura al-Mulk and in the following days the
rest of the hundred and eleven suras were compiled 3 . The speed with which he
'revealed verses' particularly impressed Mulla Husain who recalled: 'Not for
one moment did he interrupt the flow of the verses which streamed from his pen' 4 .
On another occasion Mulla Husain observed with 'amazement' the commentary which

the Bab wrote on the well-known 'hadith al-Jariya 1 since he recalled that Rashti

used to attribute the compilation of the commentary on this hadith to the Sah-ib
al-Amr .

As far as can be verified from the available sources, up to this time the
Bab did not produce any work of significance and it was only during his encounter
with his early believers that he first became aware of his 'exceptional 1 talent
for producing works of tafsir. To Mulla Husain and the other early Babis, the

al-Anwar,' VIII, Chapter 64, pp.671-7.

works of the Bab were to be valued not as examples of conventional Shi ^i and
non-Shi^i exegesis but because of their novelty of style and messianic content.
Again the preconceived attributes of the traditions which required the revelation
by the Qa'im of a commentary on the 'Best of the Stories' (Ahsan al-Qisas:
Sura al-Yusuf) , convinced the Bab as much as his believers, that his writings
possessed all the 'extraordinary' qualities which are special to the Qa'im .
However while emphasising these two aspects, the Bab still asserted that his
mere 'proclamation' sufficed for the credibility of his claim, and that indeed
even if he was not able to produce any 'sign', this did not nullify his
revelation. He told Mulla Husain:

> 'Where I fail to resolve your perplexities, could the
> reality that shines within me be regarded as powerless,
> or my knowledge be accused as faulty? Nay, by the
> righteousness of God! it behoves on this day the
> peoples and nations of both the East and the West to
> hasten to this threshold, and here seek to obtain the
> revivifying grace of the Merciful'2.
The above considerations explain Mulla Husain's  commitment to the presumption

that Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad was indeed the one he was in search for. This process

typifies what is usually regarded as 'conversion 1 into the movement. At least
in this early stage, conversion was not purely a commitment to a set of ideas
and beliefs or even merely devotion to the person of the Bab as an individual.
More fundamentally, the obligation to 'support' (nusrat)  the Imam required from

the believers that they search for and recognise the Qa'im and his companions
once any indication of them appeared and therefore conversion was an obligation
which was required by religion to be accomplished. Thus the 'cognition'
(ma^r-ifat} of the truthfulness of the claimant was the chief motive for Mulla
and the others in their conversion.
But this interpretation is contradictory to the idea suggested by some,
even as early as the time of Qati1 y that indeed it was mainly Mulla Husain who

instigated and induced Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad to claim Babiyat and that he was the

author of those writings which are attributed to the Bab . It is however too
simple to assume that Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad was no more than an instrument in the

hand of Mulla Husain or that indeed Mulla Husain had the intention of manipulating

unrealistic to think, as it is usually implied by the Babi writers, that Sayyid
^Ali Muhammad

was purely independent and free from any outside influence in the
course of his 'proclamation 1 .

Such committed views from either side should not however prevent us from
stressing the fact that in specific circumstances, the encounter between two
millenarians, one with a strong desire to discern the 'Signs' and the other with
sincere belief in his own inspiration, would naturally result in a messianic
claim in which both parties played an active role. One may suggest then, that
if Mulla Husain at that particular moment had not met the Bab in Shiraz, the
course of Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad's

spiritual development would have taken different
direction. The role performed by Mulla Husain      and other early believers was far

greater than what is usually attributed to them, since they were the ones who
directed this undefined and sometimes unintelligible 'revelation' of the Bab
into the ready-made theoretical framework of Shaykhi prophecies. Although the
ideas and images contained in the Bab's writings soon created a theoretical
system different from that of the Shaykhi or in some instances Shi ^i thought,
yet in practice the early believers elaborated on these ideas and themes, mostly
with the benefit of their own Shaykhi orientated outlook, and then spread these
interpretations amongst others who shared with them the same outlook.

The position of the early believers in the writings of the Bab is highly
exalted, mostly in order to stress this very contribution. Similarly, the brief
and enigmatic remark made by Qatil that the Shaykhi tullab     first entered Shiraz

without Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad's consent and 'submitted themselves to his claim 1
may be taken as a sign of their active role . Shaykh Sultan  •

Karbala'i also
observes that if the early believers had not entered 'the Land of Safety' (Balad
al-Arnn: Shiraz), 'the cause of God would never have emerged. When God's will
rested upon that, then they were sent towards the Imam (i.e. the Bab), may peace
be upon him* .
In the days following his meeting with the Bab, Mulla Husain

gave lectures
and public sermons in the mosque of Ilkhani in the neighbourhood of Sayyid ^Ali
Muhammad's house, and soon managed to attract a number of Shaykhis amongst the
inhabitants. Besides Mirza Ahmad Shirazi who attended these meetings, and Sayyid

—                          *              — ^
''Ali Muhammad who himself invited other tujjar , the identities of the rest of
the participants are not clear. However these sessions served the purpose of
acquainting the Bab with other Shaykhi tullab who mostly resided in the mosque.

1\.   Ibid. (520).                       2.   Z. (249).
3\.   NH. 36; Nabil. 65.

After the conversion of Mulla Husain it was agreed between him and the Bab that

prior to the time of public proclamation the matter must remain secret to all
but a few . It is for this reason that Mirza Ahmad noted:

> 'Mirza ^All Muhammad used to attend the assemblage, and
> each of them evinced the utmost respect for the other.
> On leaving the public gathering, they used to retire to
> a small mosque near Haji Mirza Ou.i Muhammad's house,
> and there they busied themselves in composing and
> writing correspondence. No one at the time knew what
> they were doing, except one or two men who enjoyed their
> full confidence .

Nevertheless the Shaykhi students were kept informed by Mulla Husain of his
encounters with the Bab. When he was questioned by the rest of the party for
the reasons of their prolonged stay in Shiraz he replied: 'I am stranded here'
and referring to Rashti's instruction, added: 'I was not ordered to Kirman but
to Fars ... I am inclined to think that this is the man whom the Sayyid (Kazim)
mentioned to me in his prediction about the appearance of the True One' 3 . These
revelations caused some disagreement and commotion among the students, even
though they were generally obedient to Mulla Husain. But these differences were
mostly resolved, as Mulla Muhammad Taqi Hashtrudi states, when they were taken
by Mulla Husain to the house of the Bab. 'We had faith in you' said one of the
students to Mulla Husain. He replied: 'Here is he whom we had been seeking' 4 .
Hashtrudi continues:

> 'Then those ^ulama who supported his (the Bab's) claim
> argued with those who denied it, until each with a
> measure (rriZzan) in hand to examine Bahib-i, Zuhur, some
> with traditions and others with difficult problems came

> his prepared question, and somehow the dilemma of each
> of them was resolved until they all recognised him. Then
> Mulla Husain called upon Mulla ^Ali (presumably Bastami):
> "this is the one about whom you blamed me" .
Although narratives such as NabZl and The New History in their usual manner
attribute the conversion of the rest of the group to guiding dreams and
inspirations, yet it is almost certain that gatherings in the Ilkhani mosque and
discussions with Mulla Husain and assurances given by him that the Bab 'in truth
was the very man whose advent was promised', brought about their final

acceptance.         This was a slow process.   The Bab himself mentioned in Bayan the
duration of this period:

> 'For forty days none except first the Letter Sin (the
> cipher title for Mulla Husain) believed in the Ba (the
> Bab) and then gradually the other Letters of B-ismallah
> (B-ismallah al-rahman al-rah-im) adorned the cloak of   ,
> recognition, till the first Unit (Vahid) was completed' .

Regardless of the metaphors implied in this passage 2 , the above remarks
make it certain that between the 5th Jumada al-Ula* and the 15th Jumada al-Thani
(July 2nd 1844) eighteen individuals were initiated as believers in the Bab.
'The second believer', after Mulla Husain, was Mulla (All Bastami who, according
to Nabil 'by hearing a single verse without any other proof recognised him 3 .
In allegorical language the Bab identified him as ''Ali who returned to earth
with all those who believed in him and he is the second who believed in the Point
after the Letter SZrf.         Here the Bab himself, is / the

i Point in the Letter Ba of

Bismallah al-rahman al-vahim (             f———!**>ll<>->^'A^V"*"v' ) so Mulla Husain is the
Sin and Mulla ^Ali and the others the remaining seventeen letters of the same
verse or 'all those who believed in him' .

But who were these other believers?            Although no clear chronological order
can be established, it is evident from Qatil that in addition to Mulla Muhammad
.     and Mulla Muhammad Baqir Bushruyihi who were counted among the believers
after Mulla Husain, the six remaining members of a seven man group (rijal sab'a)

* - -                     5
headed by Bastami, were also converted . In"an order which apparently corresponds

to their conversion in the days of the week they are named as follows: Mulla
^Abd al-Jalil Urumi, Mulla Muhammad ^Ali Qazvini, Mulla Hasan Bajistani, Mulla
Muhammad Mayamay'i, Mulla Ahmad Ibdal Maraghihi and Mulla Mahmud Khu'i.
Following them four other individuals, Sayyid Husain Yazdi, Mirza Muhammad

.                     .
(Rauzi,h Khan) Yazdi, Mulla Muhammad Baqir Tabrizi and Mulla Muhammad ^Ali

Mazandarani (later known as Quddus) were also named . Altogether Qatil named
fourteen individuals. But this list in some points contradicts Nabil who believes
that thirteen students were in Bastami's group and in all seventeen individuals
were in Shiraz 7 . Although Qatil is the oldest of all the sources which gave the
list of the early believers, it is not the most comprehensive since, for
instance, it omits Mulla Yusuf Ardabili who reportedly was present in Kufah and

Q
Shiraz .          Indeed if we accept that what the Bab said in 1263 about the nineteen-

man unit (Vdhid) is what actually existed in 1260, then it is necessary that

the extra three individuals in Nabil's list should be added: MullI Yusuf
Ardabili, Mulla Khudabakhsh Quchani and Mulla Sa''id Hindi. The eighteenth was
Qurrat al-''Ayn whose name, according to the sources compiled after 1263, was
included amongst the believers in her absence . Moreover Nab-il also added Mulla
Hadi Qazvini (son of ^Abd al-Wahhab, and brother of Mulla Muhammad CAli) instead

t
of Mulla Muhammad Mayamay'i but in the light of what Qatil says about the former,
that in spite of his brother's vigour, 'he was in darkness' 1 and of the fact
that in the later years he never showed any serious interest in the movement 2 ,
it is possible to suggest with some degree of certainty that he was not among
the early believers. Equally the later preachings of Mulla Muhammad Mayamay'i
in his home-town Mayamay may also increase the probability of his being in this
group . Strangely enough of other persons in NabzZ's list, beside Mulla Hadi,
Mulla Sa *Td Hindi and Mulla Khuda Bakhsh Quchani either remained largely inactive
or in the case of the former, completely obscure.

Such a discrepancy over the identity and number of the believers can be
mainly explained by the secrecy which covered all the activities of the early
days. Furthermore, the Bab's later attempts to put his early believers into a
hierarchical order and the difference of opinion which arose over this
distinction may have contributed to these inaccuracies. At any rate, it is
clear that between fourteen to seventeen people recognised the Bab 4 . But this
by no means suggests that in all cases the conversions were achieved in easy
ways. At least in the case of senior students, the process was the result of
some person: i. inquiry.

A yearning to be in the presence of the Qa'im combined with scrupulous
observation is, for instance, evident in Mulla Yusuf Ardabili. As Nuqtat al-Kaf

examined all the possible candidates before finally recognising Sayyid 'Ali
Muhammad as the Bab . There are indications which confirm that indeed not all

those who were in the party recognised the Bab. According to Nabil the Bab
warned Mulla Husain that 'certain ones amongst them will be counted, in the

sight of God, as his chosen and favoured disciples. Like the others they will
tread the middle way.  The fate of the rest will remain undeclared until the
hour when all that is hidden shall be made manifest 1 2 . This is further
clarified by Shaykh Sultan Karbala'i who remarks:

Another important point concerning the formation of the early group is
that some of the converts might have been informed directly of the proclamation
of the Bab or at least the possibility of such action, independently of the
'Atabat party. It is agreed by all the sources that Mulla Muhammad (Ali
Barfurushi (Quddus) who was the last to be counted amongst the early circle and
was later entitled by the Bab as the Last (Letter in the) Name of God (ismallah
al-Akhlr) or the Last Point (Nuqtatal-Ukhrd) , came to Shiraz not in the company

_ _                        _ 4
of Mulla Husain or Bastami but directly from Barfurush . He was a student of
Rashti, who after spending some time in 'Atabat, had returned to Barfurush prior
to the death of Rashti . His arrival in Shiraz towards the end of Jumada al-Ula
may not have been accidental. It has been said that while passing through
Shiraz on his way to the Mecca pilgrimage, Barfurushi, owing to his previous
acquaintance with other Shaykhis, eventually recognised the Bab . However it
is unreasonable to think that Barfurushi had started his journey to Mecca seven

months prior to the actual time of the pilgrimage without taking into consider­
ation the possibility of his having some previous knowledge of Sayyid GUi
Muhammad and perhaps intending to join the others.

Besides Barfurushi, Qatil's reference to three other individuals, Sayyid
Husain Yazdi, Mirza Muhammad Yazdi and Mulla Muhammad Baqir Tabrizi, who joined
.                      •                       •
after the 'seven man group', may also be interpreted as indicating their
independent decisions to come to Shiraz . Yet there is no other evidence to
prove this. Another source, Aqa Mirza Haydar ^Ali Usku'i, reported in his

narrative that Mulla Ahmad Ibdal Maraghihi, another of the early believers,

'before the proclamation (of the Bab) took up his staff and set out from Maraghih

to Shiraz where he was honoured (by visiting the Bab)' . This too is not
confirmed by any other source but still may reflect some advanced knowledge of
the Bab's presence in Shiraz.    Finally Qurrat al-^Ayn (Zarrin Taj, later known as
Tahirih) was also counted amongst the first believers.     The circumstances of her

conversion will be discus'sed in the next chapter but here it suffices to say
that she had been informed by the Shaykhi students of the search for the
'Promised One* when she first arrived in the ^Atabat.    As she herself says in
one of her works, she had a vague idea of the possibility of the 'revelation' in

o                                       _              _      _ _
Shiraz .    The letter which was given to Mulla Muhammad ^Ali Qazvini (her brother-

in-law) to be delivered to the 'Promised Bab' may also be seen as a sign of this
previous awareness 4 .

The formation of the Babi nucleus and its relevance to the later development
of the movement, should be looked at from two different angles; first, from
the theoretical point of view where each and all the members of the group, often
regardless of their real identity, maintained a function in the Babi theoretical
system, and secondly, from that of their actual contribution to the development
of the movement.  As far as the theoretical distinction is concerned, the
concept of 'the early believers' underwent some changes which to some extent
were responsible for the problem of leadership, or indeed the lack of it, in the
movement.    So far as can be traced, one of the earliest references in the
writings of the Bab to the formation of the group is in a letter written in mid-
1261 (May-June 1845), in which he states:

> 'After the death of the late Sayyid (i.e. Rashti) someone
> like him must exist in their sect (Shaykhis) in every age.

Here, the early believers were only described as the 'virtuous people 1

without any other hierarchical distinction being attached to them.               But considering
the date of this letter written after the Bab's return from the Hajj, when he was

disillusioned with the possibility of any mass conversion in the Hijaz or in the
— 7                                                                   *

, it is evident that he began to realise the importance of the early
disciples as the main support for the expansion of the movement.               Moreover, the
person to .whom this letter is addressed, a certain Mulla Ibrahim Shirazi, is one
of the group of three who later questioned the superiority of Mulla Husain and

the others and in due course defected from the movement . One may suspect that
even from the very early days the authority entrusted to Mulla Husain and the

influence he exerted upon the rest of the members, disenchanted some who perhaps
knew the Bab prior to the party from ^Atabat.      But in the course of the next
three years (1261-3/1845-7) , as the pressure on the Bab from both outside and
inside increased, his unpredicted isolation weighed further in favour of the
'early believers' and in particular a handful of the more active ones.

It is for this reason that in his writings and correspondence of this
period, the Bab exalted the disciples of Shiraz with distinctive titles such as
the Sablqin (or SabiqurC) , the Nuqaba* , the Nujaba3 and such like. In a letter
in reply to Sayyid Ja ^f ar Shibr sometime in 1262 (1846), he states that he
'entrusted his cause to the "guardians of the people" (ulu al-avdi) ' , an allusion

which may be taken as indicating his intention to leave the practical aspects of
his 'cause' to his chief disciples.     Sometime later in    Baktfch-yi fAdliyah

which is written at 'the height of grief and isolation' (dar buhbuhih-yihuzn va
infirad) in 1262 , the Bab elaborated an eschatological hierarchy to demonstrate
further his own stand with regard to the position of the early disciples.
Beneath the position of the Imam in his classification, he makes it essential
for the believers to have the 'cognition* of the two other successive groups,
the Nuqaba* and the Nujaba 3 . The Nuqaba' are the closest to the Imam. Their
number is not determined and they could be as many as thirty.         'They are amongst
the people and are intimate with them, but their identities are not known to

people except to some of the Nujaba' who know some of them* .   They are the
'bearers of the emanation' (homil-i fayz-and) and responsible for the appointment
of the Nujaba 3 . The conduct of 'wordly affairs (tadb-Cr-i arz) ' is bestowed
upon them. If ever any of the believers enquires about their identity, 'the Imam
will come to him in a dream and make it known to him in a truthful manner' 3 .
The Nujaba* on the other hand are known to the people but still their real status
and title is not clear. Their number is not certain but a few of them whose
number is equal to 'the soul of Ha' ( HA ) (numerologically equal to seven:
_A : 5 +    1:1+       •:!= 'La : 7) are the closest to the sublime sight. They
are hidden from the public, but the identities of some of them are divulged
because of the hostility of some 'devils in human guise' 4 .

From these enigmatic references at least three points can be derived: the
first is that, in view of the increasing difficulties, the Bab felt it necessary
to create a systematic order by borrowing from the existing messianic terminology,
but the incomplete process of 'revelation', particularly in the uncertain years
of 1261-3, prevented him from adopting a clear guideline. Secondly, secrecy is
a dominating theme in the writings of the Bab in this period. With some
justification, he tries to protect the movement from hostile forces by covering
his own real acclaimed position as well as that of his disciples. Thirdly, he
makes an important concession by entrusting 'worldly affairs' to the hands of
the Nuqaba 3 and through them to the Nujaba' . Although in this particular stage
the Bab was not willing to identify himself with any particular title, it is
certain that he ranks his early disciples in one or other of the two groups.
The allusion to 'the cognition of the seven' (ma ^ri-fat al- ab ^d) may be taken as
a vague reference to seven of the believers in Shiraz (rijal sdb^a) whereas
Mulla Husain's title Bab al-Bab may indicate the level of the Nuqaba'.

These attempts in the writings of the Bab brought about further speculation
amongst the Babis over the identity of Nujaba* and Sabiqin. The criticism
which was directed against Mulla Husain and other believers of Shiraz, mainly
from three quarters 5 , make it necessary for the Babi writers to provide some
appropriate interpretation of the Bab's allusions in order to satisfy the

curiosity of the other Babis.   In her treatise, Qurrat al-(Ayn, for example,
insisted that since Mulla Husain is amongst the Sabiqin, and they are 'in their
position exalted, therefore no one should aspire to their status' I . In reply
to Valiyani's criticism of Bushruyihi, she points out 'obedience to the Sabiqin
is obligatory and necessary for Ldhiqin (those who joined later)' . The
definition of Sabiqin on the other hand is given in the Maktub of Shaykh Sultan

Karbala'i where he defined them as those believers who recognised the Bab prior
to his pilgrimage to the Hajj:

> 'As for the Sabiqin, may peace be upon them, who in the Book
> are praised as muqarribin (those near to the Throne), they
> recognised the Dhikr (Zikr) of the name of the Lord (i.e.
> the Bab) prior to the Hajj. Verily, the truth has not been
> revealed to any soul unless he was amongst the
The same attitude in regard to criticism of the Shiraz group again encouraged
Qatil al-Karbala'i to elaborate on the hierarchy (maratib) and describe the
virtues which promoted the Sabiqin above the Lahiqin. On the basis of Sahifa-yi

*                        # *

^Adliyah he then argues that no doubt Mulla Husain is one of the Nujaba* and
hence he is above the Fuqatia* and the Sulaha* (the learned and the virtuous).
However he considered the rest of the Sabiqun 'those who accompanied Mulla
Husain to Dar al-Arm (i.e. Shiraz) to be in their position beneath the Nujaba*
and above the Sulaha* ' .

The speculations and interpretations of the Bab and the Babis in their
writings may seem trivial or at most an excessive preoccupation with numerology.
Yet in reality, in the face of the mounting pressure on the movement, they
indicated an urgent need for an assertion of leadership to fill the gap which
gradually emerged after the captivity of the Bab in 1262. In response to this
need the Bab made some attempt to clarify in the new terminology the position
and the number, but not the identity, of his early disciples. As has already
been shown, he alluded in the Bayan to their number when he stated that the
first Vahid is equal to the letters of Bismallah al-rahman al-rahim. Then
for the first time in 1263 he referred to the Huruf-i Hayy (the Letters of the
Living) as the eighteen members of the first Vahid of nineteen headed by himself.
The significance of this new classification lay in the fact that here the Bab

3\.   The term Sabiqin (or Sabiqun) is borrowed from the Qurtm, IX, 100 and LVI,

shared with the Huruf-i Hayy in the formation of a unit which in his theory is
the basis of the 'Whole Being' (Kullu-Shay' ) 1 .
In Bayan he reveals the metaphorical identity of the Letters:

> 'And for the Best Names (Asma 3 al-Husna) , God specified
> in this cycle (Kaur) the names of the Letters of the
> Living, because there were fourteen sacred, hidden and
> secure souls together with the Four Gates (Abvab-i
> fArb^a ) or Lights of the Throne (Anvar-i *Arsh) or
> bearers of Creation, Livelihood, Death and Life which
> total the number of Hayy . These are the most proximate
> Names of God and the rest of the names will follow their
> guidance' .

The numerological value of the word Hayy is 18 ( r : 8 + ^   : 10 — 18: £ ) and
perhaps this is the basic explanation for the actual number of Letters. The
word Huruf indicates the relation of each letter (in abjad arrangement) with

each member of the group . The word Hayy on the other hand means not only
'living' and 'alive' but more specifically 'clan' or 'tribe'.  Thus a sense of

grouping as well as revitalisation or giving birth is attached to the word .
In the Babi doctrine the number eighteen represents the fourteen 'Infallibles'
namely the Prophet Muhammad, the Twelve Imams, Fatima and the four Archangels.
The equivalence of these two values, namely the early disciples and the Shi'i

'infallibles' is not accidental.   Representatives of the past revelation now
re-emerge in the Letters of Eayy to witness the resurrection where each letter

represents the corporal existence of a 'Name'. The whole of the first Vahid of
Bayan deals with the 'Return 1 (Rijtat) of the Imams and the 'Four Gates' in the
Babi revelation. Each chapter refers to one Letter of the Living as the
of one character, which also includes the return of those who were accompanying
him .

But this first Unit ( j^ Vahid :19= 9 : 6 +         1:1+ ^ : 8 +        j :4)
is not complete without the Bab who is now manifested not only as the Qa'im but
as the Nuqt-ih-i Bayan (the Point of Bayan, later Nuqtih-i Ula') or the 'Essence

.                                         .
of the Seven Letters' (Zat-i Huruf-i Sab^ . Both titles are indications of the
formation of a new independent 'revelation'. Therefore the number nineteen plays
an important role in the Babi doctrine. It not only indicates the formation of
the first Unit, but as the 'Explanatory Unit' (Vahid-i Mubin) it originates the
Kullu-Shay' .

> 'In this revelation the result is the multiplication of the
> First Unit, until the Heavens, the earth and that which is
> in between is completed . . . and all these units in their
> degrees end in the First Unit. If you divide the whole

> till it reaches the last one. This is the First Unit which

The value of Kullu-shay' is 361 ( d : 20 + J : 30 + J. : 300 + * : 1 + ^ : 10 =

'V
£-Jj : 361) which is also equal to nineteen units of the value of nineteen.

Here Kullu-Shay' has a broad and complex meaning. Since it represents the
'Whole Being', one can identify it with 'material being' (Vujud-i rrnujud) or
'being conditioned to things' (vujud-i bishart-i shay'). This concept
originates in the Qiafan: 'All things (kullu-shay') perish, except His Face

1\.   Bayan, I,.-1-19 (4-10). In a letter written in 1266 (1850-1) the Bab openly
declares that his first two disciples were the return of the Prophet and

''All to the earth: 'The first who returned to the world was God's Messenger

2\.   Bayan. VII, 8 (248).

(Vajha-hu) ' • The Bab, similarly to the Sufis and Hurufis in the past, inter-
preted the 'Face of God 1 ( A^^J :19= j : 6 + £:3+-f.:5+<j:5)as the
secret of the 'Whole Being*.    Thus the secret of the 'Whole Being' is concealed
in the first Vahid and the secret of the Vahid is in the Point (NuqtM of Bayan

*      —                    *                         *
which is the point of Ba of the nineteen lettered B-ismallah al-rahman al-rahim.
This theoretical framework served as a metaphor for what the Bab intended
to create in reality. In the formation of the first Vahid he implied a
collective responsibility shared by other Letters: 'God the one and only provided
for his own revelation (i.e. the Bab's) eighteen souls who had been created
before Kullu-Shay' for his soul (i.e. the Bab's) and established the sign of
their recognition within the existence of all things' 2 . He expounded a theory
in which the Letters participated in developing the 'secret of his mission'.
The first Vcthid and the eighteen successive Units which follow in the process of
the formation of Kullu-Shay' in theory are the structure of the whole Babi
organisation. Although this 'sacred' order never materialised beyond the first
Vah-id, occasionally terms such as M-iraya* (Mirrors), Adilla* (Proofs) and
Shuhada* (Martyrs) were used with what could be interpreted as reference to
other Vah-ids 3 . But in spite of these elaborations and in spite of the theoretical
significance given to the Letters, the question of practical leadership to a
large extent remained unsolved. The Bab's references in Bayan to Man Yuzhiruhu
Allah (He whom God shall manifest) was an attempt to append further action and
indeed the whole future of the Babi cause to the appearance of another messianic
character who, as can be understood from Bayan, was due to appear after the Bab.
In reality however the responsibility entrusted to the Letters of Hayy took a
different course.

The actual part played by the early disciples differed to some extent from
the theoretical hierarchy set up by the Bab. The insufficient details supplied
by the sources only to a limited extent inform us of the geographical
distribution, the social background and the past religious affiliations of the
early believers. But bearing in mind the problems of identification, it is still
possible to make a general analysis. Of the eighteen individuals who were
counted amongst the early believers, seven were from Khurasan, five from

3\.   KD. II, 227 ; Hasht Bihisht, pp.284-5 and Gobineau, pp.277-8.

Contents of the Persian Bayan', under "He whom God shall manifest" (p.LXLX).

Azarbaijan, two from Qazvin, two from Yazd, one from Mazandaran and one from
Inida.   Both Khurasan and Azarbaijan were the provinces where Shaykhis had a
greater degree of popularity and following.   Similarly in Qazvin, Yazd and
Mazandaran (in the city of Barfurush in particular), the teachings of the
students of Ahsa'i

provided the ground for the spread of the Shaykhi ideas .

Seven Khurasanis and three of the Azarbaijanis originated in small rural or semi-
rural towns whereas the remaining seven were from commercial and provincial
centres. (There is no indication of the origin of Sa^id Hindi). This may be

interpreted as an even distribution between 'city' and 'village' .

From the point of social background, however, such a distinction may not
seem very explicit. All the disciples with the exception of two, were from
humble or relatively modest backgrounds. Though not much is known about their
past, there is enough evidence to suggest that they were mostly from families
similar to Mulla Husain's. Mulla Muhammad ^Ali Barfurushi (Quddus) was the son
of a small land owner (rice-cultivator) in the outskirts of Barfurush . Sayyid

-         4      - /• -       - T
Husain Yazdi was son of a low-ranking Shaykhi Mulla in Yazd . Mulla 'Ali Bastami
•                                             c      _             _      _ _ *
may have come from a small land-owning family . Mulla Muhammad 'Ali Qazvini was

the only one (except Qurrat al-^Ayn) who came from a family of high-ranking
Shaykhi mujtahids of Qazvin , but as Qatil points out he was not typical of the
sons of eminent 'ulama and did not show their usual ambition to inherit their
father's position . This relatively homogeneous background no doubt had some
bearings on the integration and coherence of the early disciples and in due
course influenced the pattern of conversion in the early Babi community.

These two elements of geographical distribution and social background are
complementary to the religious bonds which existed in the group. They were all
Shaykhis and students of Rashti. Though there are various references, both in
the Babi and non-Babi sources to the theological knowledge, steadfastness and
piety of senior students such as Mulla Husain, Bastami and Urumi, there is

no indication to confirm that indeed any of them had acquired authorisation for
iftihad. Therefore in the absence of any further information it is only fair
to classify them as senior tullab or qarib al-ij-tihad. Except in the three
cases of Sayyid Husain Yazdi, Mulla Muhammad Qazvini and Qurrat al-(Ayn, the
past religious affiliation of their families is not known 1 . But in most cases
they themselves were converted to Shaykhism either when they were still in their
home towns, or in the early stages of their studies in provincial centres such
as Isfahan, Mashhad or Tabriz.      Almost in all cases their earlier interest in
Shaykhism was followed by their later study under Rashti - an indication of the
importance of the local Shaykhi 'ulama in attracting students and recruiting
them for the Shaykhi circle in the (Atabat.         But what was perhaps distinctive
in their version of Shaykhism, was that they were all deeply motivated by

messianic ideas. Reference has already been made to the presence in Mulla Husain

These elements would explain the similarity of the early disciples in their
intentions, but nevertheless they would not indicate an equal participation in
the future of the movement.       In the course of the first four years, up to the
time of the Badasht gathering and the events which led to the upheaval of
Tabarsi,
t

the group of early disciples hardly had the opportunity to act
collectively or indeed to implement a common policy.        Thus, the efforts and
activities of the members of the early group were guided by their own individual

initiatives.  According to their actual contribution to the progress of the
movement, they can be divided into four groups. First are those who played
leading parts both by converting new individuals and by expounding the Babi
doctrine.  Mulla Husain, Mulla *Ali Bastami,  Qurrat al-fAyn and in the later

«                     •
stages Mulla Muhammad  ^Ali Mazandarani (Quddus) are the most important of the

early Babi leaders. The second group are those who had a major participation
in the development of the movement, but could not be defined as leaders. "They
are Mulla Jalil Urumi, Mulla Muhammad  Ckli Qazvini, Mulla Ahmad

Ibdal Maraghihi,

Mulla Muhammad Baqir Tabrizi, Mulla Yusuf Ardabili and Sayyid Husain  Yazdi.

The third group were those who did not play an important part in the course of
the events but yet remained dedicated Babis. Mulla Hasan   Bushruyihi, Mulla

Muhammad Baqir Bushruyihi, Mulla Mahmud Khu'i and Mulla Muhammad Mayamay'i are

among this group. The fourth are those who remained totally inactive or obscure,
or else defected from the Babi ranks. They were Mulla Muhammad   Rauzih Khan

Yazdi, Mulla Khudabakhsh Quchani, Mulla Sa *Td Hindi and Mulla Hasan

Bajistani.
The theoretical hierarchy of the First Vah-id only partly corresponded to

reality. With the exception of the limited success of the Bab in converting new
individuals to the movement, the main burden of advocating the new creed rested
an the shoulders of the first group who, in cooperation with the members of the
second group as well as other important figures who later joined the movement,
created a network which, though small in size and ability, was active enough to
expand the movement beyond the community of the Shaykhis .

The 'proclamation' of the Bab and the formation of the Babi nucleus was the
first step towards a more comprehensive 'manifestation' with the main aim of
delivering the new message to a wider audience. In simple terms, the message
was typical of what may be expected of a millenarian movement. It preached the
appearance of a central 'holy' figure who was the sole representative of the
Concealed Imam, and who was variably defined as the Bab, the Zikr, Baqiyatallah
the Hujjat and similar terms. He was entrusted by the Imam with heralding the
nearness of the Zuhur and the approach of the Day of Return (Yaum al-R-ij^a) and
then the Day of Resurrection (Yawn al-Qiyama') .    But before the advent of the

1268 (1852) in Tehran.

Imam himself, the Bab and his companions were commissioned to warn the people,
to call them to 'recognise' the 'truth' and to join the rank of the 'supporters'
of the Qa'im. But this was only the facade to a more complex process which
shaped the early Babi theory of Zuhur. Plans and policies for the 'declaration'

of the advent of the Imam, the various dimensions of the position claimed by the
Bab, the appeal of the movement to the public and its warning to the secular and
religious authorities, were features which gave distinctive characteristics to
the new message.

To justify their claims, the Bab and his followers relied more than anything
on the past messianic prophecies. Although on a few occasions, particularly in
his later works, the Bab tried to minimise the significance of the Shi^i
traditions in justifying his 'truthfulness' (hujj iyat ), nevertheless, neither
he nor his followers escaped the overwhelming influence of the prophecies of
Rij^at and Qiyamat. In Dala'-il-i Sab^ah for instance the Bab points out that

> 'Since your orientation is still towards the past words
> of the "People of the House" (Ahl-i Bayt, i.e. The Prophet
> and the Imams), thus you search in the ahadtth to find
> justifications. However, it is not right to establish
> the (truthfulness) of the possessor of the proofs and
> signs (i.e. the Bab himself) by means of the past
> traditions since the return of the authors of these
> traditions would be brought about by his words'^-.
Yet in the same work he refers to traditions related by Mufaddal, Abi Lubayd
'Makhzuni, Ibn ''Abbas, to al-Khutba al-Tutunj-iya attributed to <Ali, the tradition

•             »
of Lauh al-Fatima , the tradition of Azarbaijan

~2        and the prayers of Nudba and
Ramadan to make the same justification . In his letter to Muhammad Shah he
concludes: 'And all the torments reported in the akhbar, which are cited on
innumerable occasions, are now fulfilled' 3 . These traditions, whether in their
original form, or in more concise forms suggested by Shaykhism , remained at the
centre of the activities planned to be carried out in the early stages of the
movement. In this adoption of the past prophecies, the Babis tended towards a
more symbolic presentation of the Resurrection, yet the idealistic aspect of
their interpretation was dominant enough to remain as the basic 'scenario' for
what they tried to fulfil.

for further details.

Setting aside all the discrepancies and differences of opinion in the Shi ^i
messianic traditions, it is still possible to discern an implicit distinction
between the Day of Return and the Day of Resurrection.   Such a distinction has
some bearing on our argument.   It appears that for the Babis, this Day of Return
was the period when they, as the symbolic reincarnations of the past holy
figures, were responsible for the fulfilment of those tasks which were supposed
to be accomplished prior to the Resurrection. Mulla Muhammad Baqir Majlisi for

instance points out that in the period of Rij^at prior to the Day of Qiyamat,
and simultaneous with the appearance of the Qa'im, 'some of the best of the
people and the worst of the evil will return to the earth' . It is in this
period that the Prophet,'Ali, the other Imams, the saints and the prophets of
the past will return to accompany the Qa'im in his Khuruj- Majlisi argues that
there is no clear evidence regarding the exact time of Rij^at, yet it is most
probable that it will take place just before Resurrection 2 . As is implied by
most of the sources, this Return 'is not applicable to all creatures. Only
those believers return who are perfect in their beliefs or those whose beliefs
are sheer blasphemy 1 . Thus in this period prior to Q-iyamat-i, Kubra 3 only the
'Special Return' (R-ij^at al-Khassa) (as opposed to General Return: Rij^at al-
^Ammo) would occur to allow the Qa'im and his companions to prepare themselves
against the forces of evil 4 .

Amongst the traditions recorded about the Day of Return, the well known
hadith related by al-Mufaddal ibn 'Umar from Imam Ja ''far Sadiq , further
clarifies

_    the circumstances of• the 'Special Return 1 . According to this hadlth
the Qa'im will first appear in Mecca at the time of the annual pilgrimage. 'He
will stand between the Rukn and the Maqam and call loudly: "01 My noble men and
my companions and those whom God spared for the purpose of my assistance prior

deliver his call to the companions wherever they may be throughout the world.
Then after declaring his manifestation to the people of Mecca and preaching 'with
truthfulness and wisdom', he will call his companions to come to his
'assistance' (nusra).

In response three hundred and thirteen Shi ^i noblemen
(Nuq.aba') will join him and swear to him the oath of allegiance. On his arrival
in Madina, he will put the inhabitants to a test, to examine their faithfulness
to the House of 'Ali. He will punish the sinful and reward the faithful who will
all join him in his holy Khuruj. Then he will set out for Kufah where 'on the
land between Najaf and Kufah', he will be received by his great ancestors. The
Prophet» Ali, his son Husain      and all other Imams, prophets and saints,

companions and firm believers will be resurrected to join the Imam of the Age.
From the outskirts of Kufah, he will start his holy Khuruj against the forces of
evil in order to revenge the wrong and oppression suffered by the House of 'Ali
and their supporters throughout time. From Kufah which will be the headquarters
of the Qa'im, he will lead his forces to the four quarters of the earth. He will
wage war against the Sufyani Banners (Rayat al-Sufyani) which are the symbols of
evil, with the help of some other messianic figures such as the Hasani       Youth

(al-Fati al-Easan-i)  , the Pure Soul (al-Nafs al-Dhakiya) and the warriors of

(jihad) and a rising (qiyarn). The Qa'-im bi al-Sayf (the one who shall rise with

the sword) therefore is fulfilling the historic revenge which was postponed by
the Imams to a proper moment in the future.   These events could not take place
without the participation of the same holy characters who were involved in the
original events.  Hence the Prophet, ^All and, perhaps the most important of all,
Husain ibn ^Ali are bound to return to the same scenes. But yet in spite of all

the fighting and even the conquest of the world, the fate of the Qa'im and the
other holy figures is not wholly clear. Though some optimistic traditions
predict the Qa'im's long reign over the world and the total annihilation of all
the evil forces, others forecast his death in battle or at the hand of the evil­
doers a few years after his appearance . Perhaps the essence of the Qa'im's
mission is not so much in the ultimate conquest of the 'truth' over 'evil' as
in his very act of 'rising' (qiyam') .

In a symbolic re-enactment, the Bab and his followers were to fulfil this
eschatological Return. The Bab himself was convinced that though 'externally'
(zahirl)
he was the 'Gate' to the Imam, but 'internally' (bating

he was the
Imam himself. So each of his followers was to fulfil the return of the Imams
and the saints. The traditions gave the general guidance, whereas the theoretical
preparations in the Shaykhi theory of non-material Ma Cad permitted these
symbolic identifications 3 . Scanty references to the early ideas and plans of
the Shiraz group at least make it clear that they were only vaguely conscious of
this messianic Return, but they were less in the dark about their immediate
targets. The traditions drew the principal lines for the future plans of the
movement: the disciples would disperse all through the Shifi lands to provide
all the 'support 1 necessary for the ZuhuT

of the Qa*im, the Bab himself would
travel to Mecca to declare the advent of the Qa'im and the imminence of the
Qiyamat, though not necessarily 'revealing' himself as the Qa'im; then both he
and his disciples, accompanied by other 'supporters', would gather in ^Atabat

to fulfil the next stage of the messianic prophecies . In practice this meant

the accomplishment of three main tasks: first to inform those Shaykhi elements
who, because of a similar outlook to that of the early disciples, were likely
to recognise the Bab; secondly, to prepare the public for the general declaration;
and thirdly to address the religious and secular authorities with warnings from
the Bab. These objectives were to be achieved by mobilising the Shaykhi tullab in

^^                                                             •
the 'Atabat and preparing the ground for the arrival of the Bab, organising
Shaykhi support inside Iran, preaching admonitory sermons and speeches, visiting
the eminent fulama and mujtahids in important religious centres and addressing
the monarch and the state authorities. These were preliminary measures which
were to be carried out simultaneously with the Bab's journey to Mecca and then
to the 'Atabat where he would declare his mission to the public and divulge his
real claim and identity. Though this was never clearly pronounced, the assembly
of the Bab and his followers in the ^Atabat was to be regarded as the commencement
of the Qiyamat proper.

The Shi ' i traditions no doubt were the main impetus for the Bab and his
followers in drawing their future plans. However his acquaintance with Bihar

—             —•!                                                     *
al-Anwar of Majlisi and other Shi^i collections of traditions or the Shaykhi
treatment of these traditions in Shark• al-Ziyara and other works of Ahsa'i

and
Rashti were not the only source of inspiration for the Bab. In a speech which
the Bab delivered to his disciples in the summer of 1844, just before their
departure to their assigned missions, traces of Christian influence may also be

detected. If Nabil could be relied on for the content of this address , the Bab
even drew a direct comparison with Christ and his disciples. After expressing
his hopes for the future progress of the movement and emphasising the moral
strength and sacrifice needed for fulfilling their mission, the Bab warns his
followers of any hesitation or weakness which may lead them to retreat and
silence. He then directly refers to the words of Christ when he warns his
disciples:

> 'Ye are even as the fire which in the darkness of the
> night has been kindled upon the mountain-top. Let your
> light shine before the eyes of men ... You are the salt
> of the earth, but if the salt have lost its savour, where­
> with shall it be salted? ... The Heavenly Father is ever
> with you and keeps watch over you ... and will exalt you
> above all the rulers and kings of the world'3.

These and other remarks in this speech appear to be somewhat free references to

1\.   Data'il-i Sab fah. op.cit. 50.          2.   pp.92-4.
3\.   Ibid. pp.92-3.

Matthew .  They are sometimes chosen particularly to imply the approach of a

millenarian event: 'Scatter throughout the length and breadth of this land ...

I am preparing you for the advent of a mighty Day 1 .

The Bab's preoccupation with Christ and Christianity was beyond the common
muslim knowledge of the time which was mainly confined to the Qur'an and other
Islamic sources.  Most probably he must have taken his references directly from
the Gospels. The new Persian translation of the New Testament was available in
Iran from the 1810's and it is possible that he extracted his quotations from

this translation . Gobineau adds the translation of the New Testament by the
'Protestant missionaries' to the list of the early works which had been studied
by the Bab .. More references in his works to Christ, and his criticism of the
Christian concepts of Trinity and Atonement would also confirm this belief .
Dr. Cormick also reported that during the Bab's incarceration in Chihriq (1264-
6/1848-50) 'he was seen by sane Armenian carpenters who were sent to make some
repairs in his prison, reading the Bible, and he took no pains to conceal it,
but on the contrary told them of it* . Perhaps it was this preoccupation with
Christ and Christianity which later in 1261-2 (1845-6) encouraged some of his
opponents to 'accuse' him'of believing in Christianity and preaching the
Trinity' 8 .

Whatever the effect of Christianity on the ideas of the Bab might have been,
he was still firmly tied to the concept of Zuhur as it was interpreted in Shi^i-

Shaykhi terms. Such an attachment was not only apparent in the objectives which
the Babis set for themselves, or the style, the terminology and the criteria
used by them, but also in the titles which the Bab assumed for himself,
particularly in the early stages of his 'mission'. As has already been pointed
out, the claims of Babiyat, ZikrZyat and alike were all given a vague relationship

to the ideas propounded by the past Shaykhi teachers .      But it was apparent even
from the early days that he postulated a position beyond what was usually
intended by titles such as Shi^i, al-Kamil or Rukn al-Rabi,?.    In one of his
prayers, he maintains that his 'status' (sha'n) was not known by anyone before
the time of his proclamation:

> 'I was alone in my own abode and nobody was aware of my
> status. Then You brought out some of (Your) humble
> servants from their dwellings and sent them to me. After­
> wards You made Your cause my main concern and rewarded me
> with Your proof, till I received Your order to acquire
> Your covenant from the heart of those who recognised Your
> cause, and they submitted in such a way that no one from
> this small group denied me .

The above passage indicates the Bab's regard for his own 'status' as a
divine gift which is only made apparent when the 'humble servants' or his early
disciples recognised him. Yet in his early works he tends to explain this
'status' by attaching it to a sacred genealogy.      In the opening of the commentary
on the Sura of Yusuf, he describes his relation to the holy chain of the Imams:

> 'God ordained the revelation of this book as a commentary
to Ahsan  al-Qisas
*          f ' ^ from the presence of Muhammad,

* f ^ son of
> Hasan, son of 'All, son of Muhammad, son of 'All, son of

> Husain,
son of ''All ibn Abl-Talib.

to his servant. This *>
is a perfect divine proof from Dhikr (Zikr) to the world' .

This perhaps is the most direct reference which the Bab made in his early
works to his relation to the Concealed Imam. But still the authority which is
entrusted to the Zikr is regarded by the Bab as purely hypothetical. It is
almost certain that references to the Concealed Imam in the works of the Bab
are, even from the early stages, references to the status which inwardly he
claimed for himself. When for instance in Sah-ifah-yi, ^Adl-Cyah he maintains that:
'The Concealed Imam, may God hasten his appearance, designated one of his

servants amongst the Persians and all his Nuqdba* to protect the religion' or
when in his address to Muhammad Shah he states: 'In the year Si-ttin (i.e. 1260)

God filled my heart with firm evidence and positive knowledge of Hazrat-i Hujjat 1

these statements are only intended to cover his real claim of Qa*imlyat which
he only made public four years later . In an important passage in Dala'l-i
Sab^ah, the Bab himself explains his reasons for this concealment:

> 'See how the manifestation of God (mazhav-i. inncm/i
> anallati) revealed himself (first) in the position of
> the Babiyat of the Qa'im and even reaffirmed in his

> and the new cause and to persuade them to recognise and
> identify it with themselves and not to remain in the      -
> darkness or ignorance of what has been provided for them' .

This policy of gradual publication was not only designed to acquaint the
public with the movement in successive stages, but was adopted to protect the
Bab and his followers from being exposed to unnecessary criticism and opposition.
The Babi disciples also adopted this tactic in their attempts to win over new
converts. A few of the early Babi sources discussed the Bab's step by step
policy. Nuqtat al-Kaf for instance justifies it by laying down four conditions

for the veracity of the claimant and then applying them to the claims of the

gradual promotion of the people's spiritual status' . The conversation recorded
by Tarikh-i, Samandar between Mulla Husain -and Mulla Sadiq     Muqaddas in 1261 in

Isfahan indicates a difference of opinion over the exact claim of Sayyid <Ali
Muhammad. No doubt it was in pursuit of the same policy that Mulla Husain
argues the necessity for the appearance of the 'Promised One' in familiar
Shaykhi terms . Thus Nicolas seems to be justified when he maintains: 'Or, se

pre*tendre la Porte, c'est revendiquer par cela meme le titre de Sahib-ouz-Zeman' .

Nevertheless, the uncertainties over the real status of the Bab created a great
deal of confusion and misunderstanding.      Though for the majority of the close
disciples it was almost certain that the real intention of the Bab was to declare
himself as the Qa'im, the indications for the rest of the believers were never
clear enough to prevent confusion.     What Qatil reported (presumably on the
authority of some of the disciples who had returned to 'Atabat)      of the
instructions of the Bab to his followers in Shiraz, is typical of what most of
the early Babis outside the circle of the early disciples knew of the claims
and plans of the Qa* im Maqam , the term by which he refers to the Bab . He
quotes the Bab as saying to his followers:

> 'I have been ordered to explain only up to a point and
> neither to specify the person nor reveal the name.
> Return to your homelands till the promised person appears
> in Karbila* ... and refuse to recognise him without proofs
> and arguments and without his claim being substantiated
> by traditions of the Qa'im and the firm proof of the Quran .

Thus intensify your search and multiply your enquiry.

This indeed was the impression that the Bab and his disciples wished to
transmit to the public and even to the other believers, prior to the assembly
of the ''Atabat; a sense of anticipation for the appearance of an unidentified
'promised person* who may claim to be the Qa'im. In fact Qatil himself maintains
that at the time the Bab was practising a policy of dissimulation Qt-itman) .
Many indications in the early writings of the Bab prove Qatil's view. In a
letter addressed to Mulla Husain for example, written in early Muharram 1261

(December 1844), he strongly advised Bushruyihi not to reveal his identity and
his claim to those who may oppose him. 'Do not reveal the word of your Lord to
those who would deny it ... observe the practice of taqiya in order to avoid
persecution and imprisonment ...' . In Dald' I—i Sab ah he again confirms: 'Since
I was aware of the limits of the public, I ordered the concealment of my name' .
Similarly, in other early correspondence with his disciples he strongly forbade
them to divulge his identity .
The emphasis on taqiyah for protection and safety was often justified by

stressing the precedents for it in the Shi i traditions . On a few occasions

m

the Bab quoted well-known dhad-ith related from the Prophet and the Imams on the

necessity of taqiyah: ' Taqiya is my faith and the faith of my forefathers. Any­
one who does not practise taqiya has no faith' . In the case of the concealed
Imam in particular, a series of traditions strongly prohibit even mentioning his
name . Having this frequent use of taqiyah in mind, the Bab stated in a prayer:
'By your refined wisdom, my Lord, you made taqiya your command, thus people
practised it from the beginning of the Ghayba up to now and that practise was
the testimony to (people's) eagerness to come to your presence' 3 .

Nevertheless, even with these justifications, the ambiguity of the position
claimed by the Bab, his hesitation to reveal his identity, his reluctance to
hold a consistent stand in the face of criticism and danger, and his constant
reminder to his disciples to act with the utmost caution, were among the major
obstacles in the way of the movement's achieving its prime targets. Up to 1264
(1848) when circumstances forced the Bab to abandon his previous hesitation and

-   -                          4                    _
declare his claim of Qa' imiyat in the trial of Tabriz , the concept of taq-iyah
remained an overwhelming feature of the Bab's words and actions. The issue of
taqiyah was an unspoken point of difference in policy between the Bab and his
followers. While he intended to introduce his 'mission' in a gradual and rather
secretive way, his disciples were willing to take the risk of opposition from
both secular and religious quarters . This duality in aims and objectives,
rooted in a difference in the background and the outlook of the Bab from the
rest of his disciples, was the source of a two-fold process in the history of
the movement. As the Bab resigned himself further to an isolation which was
forced upon him, his disciples turned their attention more towards an open appeal
to the public which eventually led them to confrontation with the secular and
religious authorities.

Taking into account all the set-backs of the taqiyah policy, still the

original plan to introduce the real claim of the movement in successive stages
seems to have been a sound device for drawing the attention of the favourable
elements in society without causing serious agitation and distress.     It may even
be asked whether if the introduction of the movement had taken place according
to what the Bab originally intended, he would have been able to save himself and
the movement from persecution and ultimate destruction. In reality, however,
this is a groundless speculation.   The Bab's message, no matter how skilfully
hidden in a labyrinth of metaphors and multifaceted terms, was, in its essence,
in opposition to the whole Shi'i concept of 'expectation'. The step by step
progress from Babiyat to Qa'imiyat and then to Mazhariyat (the claim to an
independent revelation) was only the outward manifestation of the Bab's whole
interpretation of Q-iyamat.

In a gradual development, the Bab was aiming to fulfil Qiyamat not only as
a re-enactment of the past events in the symbolic embodiment of the past holy
characters, but as the end of an era and the commencement of another.     For him
the apocalypse of Q-iyamat was an extraordinary 'event' (vaq*i ati) of immense
proportions, which occurred not to terminate the course of the time in any
material or physical way, as is so often implied by the Shi^i traditions, but
to apply a new shape and pattern to man's relation with the divine truth. As
he himself puts it, although the Day of the Qiyamat is called the 'most great
Day* (Yawn-i A 1 zam) , it is externally like any other day, and passes by while
many are unaware of it . The Day of Qiyamat is 'the Day of advent of the Tree
of Truth (shajarih-i haqiqat) f .

> 'No one amongst the Shi^is seems to have understood

> which have no bearing on the divine truth. What is

> Tree of Bayan (i.e. the Bab himself) up to the setting of
> his sun, is the Qiyamat of the Prophet's revelation which
> was promised in the Qu^an ...'^.

The Bab looks at his own proclamation as the Qiyamat of Islam 'since nothing
reaches its Qlyamat before perfecting its course and the perfection of Islam was

achieved at the beginning of this revelation' .

3\.   Ibid.                             4.   Ibid. (p.31

> 'From the rise of Islam up to its decline, the Tree of

> of Bayan comes at the time when "He whom God shall

The whole concept of 'perfection 1 and the gradual growth of the 'Tree of
Truth' which bears fruit at the Qiyamat of each revelation was foreign to the
main body of Shi ^i orthodox thinking.     The idea that prophethood from Moses to
Jesus and from Jesus to Muhammad and from Muhammad to the Qa'im and from Qa'im

to 'He whom God shall manifest 1 and from him to the next was aimed to cause a
gradual exaltation of mankind, was irreconcilable with the dogma that Islam is

the 'best' and 'the most perfect' of religions and that 'the best of the times'
was the time of the Prophet.    When the Bab voices his view that now his
revelation (which he names Bayari) 'is still in its embryonic state (da? maqam-i
nutfih ast)' but by the beginning of the next revelation 'it would reach its

perfection' > he in fact inclines towards a progressive thinking which is not in
line with the 'static' view of orthodox Shi''ism. In contrast to the Shi fi
theory of a prolonged lapse in time (fatrat) during Concealment he believed

that behind this process of perfection, there is the dynamic force of
'revelations' which moves mankind forward in successive stages. The Days of
Qiyamat are the moments of revival when man encounters God (l-iqa* allati) only
through His prophetic manifestations • Thus, he concludes that presence in the
Day of Qiyamat is far more important for man than all the period in between the
two Q-iyamats since it is in this moment of time that the fruits of the previous
Zuhur would reach their accomplishment only to prepare the formation of the new
revelation •

To distinguish between the good and the evil therefore, the people will be
put to a test.   The distinction which the Bab often defines as the difference
between the light (nwr) and the fire (rcar) is therefore made with regard to
those Shi^i traditions which separate the 'supporters' of the Qa'im from his
'opponents' . In this Day the standard for belief or blasphemy is not any more
the sole recognition of the past revelations but is in the awareness of the
advent of the Time. The 'cognition of the manifestation' is the measure (jnizcm)
for becoming enlightened with the light of the Heaven (jannat) of cognition or
falling into the fire of the hell of veiledness (-ihtijab) . Explaining this
in his usual symbolic language, the Bab puts the recognition of his status the
critical distance between light and fire. The difference in the numerological
value of HUT which is 256 ( o : 50 + j : 6 + j : 200 = ^ : 256) and that of
the nar which is 251 (   o : 50 +    1:1+ j : 200 = ^ : 251) is 5 which is
equal to the value of Bab ( v :2+       l:l+v :2= V^ : 5 ) •

Of course it should be noted that the idea of successive revelations had
ancient precedents in theoretical Sufism as well as in some Isma'ili trends and
with greater clarity in the Nuqtavi doctrine . No doubt the Bab was acquainted,

at least partly, with this idea through the writings of Ahsa'i and Rashti. It

should be equally pointed out that the Bab's theory of progressive revelations
is firmly based on divine emanation and therefore could not be regarded as a
prototype or an equivalent of the anthropocenteric 'Philosophy of Progress' in
the western sense. However some points of general resemblance may be traced.
A characteristic which made the Babi theory distinguishable from the above
mentioned Islamic trends and brought it perhaps closer to the western outlook
was that this theory attached a far greater importance to the position of man
in his process of perfection. In its essence, but not in its theophanic
appearance, this theory held the believers responsible for the development and
the ultimate destiny of the revelation. Now the Qiyamat is materialised and an
attempt is made to distinguish between the 'letters of light' and the 'letters
of fire' as the first step toward defining this human responsibility. Though it
may be rightly argued that in this distinction the Bab is influenced by the
Quranic division of the world into the 'believers' and the 'infidels', never-
the less in its depth there is an emphasis on man's responsibility for his
ultimate choice.                      __________________________________

The Qa'im, who is the initiator of a new revelation, provides new norms and
values for making the distinction between the 'truth' and the 'falsehood'. In
the early stages of his 'revelation', the Bab regarded the commentary on the
Sura of Yusuf as this major 'Differentiator' (Furqan) : 'At the beginning of his
appearance', writes the Bab, 'he (i.e. himself) interpreted the Sura of his own
name and entitled each chapter (of this commentary) with one verse from the
Quran, so that it be the indication that he is the Point of Furqan in the Ba of
Bismallah' . The Bab saw 'the best of the stories' as the allegorical account
of his own prophecy, not only because he found in himself a resemblance to
Joseph , or because the story of Joseph contained the secret of taq-iycfo, but also
because of a sense of collective commitment which he shared with the other
'letters' of Bismallah, and through them with the Kullu-Shay' which is the whole of
mankind.

At the time of revelation, the first who swore allegiance
> to him (i.e. the Bab) was Muhammad and then the Amir al-
> Mu'minin and then the Imams on whom be peace. This is the
> secret of the verse "When Joseph said to his father: "Father,
> I saw eleven stars, and the sun and the moon; I saw them
> bowing down before me"^. The number of Yusuf is 156 (i.e.
> the numerical value) which is (equal) to the number of Qayywn
> This refers to the Qa'im of the House of Muhammad and he
> who is Hayy-i Qayyum 1 ^.

In this long and complex commentary, the Bab adopted a similar classification to
the Quran and attempted to open the gate of the 'divine inspiration' and resolve
the unintelligible problem of the Book. According to certain traditions the
secret of the Qtyamat is embedded in this Sura. But perhaps the most significant
aspect of this commentary is in the attention paid in the first two chapters to
the two sources of power, the state and the 'ulama. Such an address to the
secular and religious authorities demonstrates the importance attached to
them as leaders responsible for the community. In the opening chapter
of Qayywn al-Asma* called Sura al-Mulk the Bab declares:

in the shadow of the greatest Dhikr on behalf of the Pure
Religion (al-Dtn al-Khalis)

'^.

The Z-ikr or the manifestation of the Truth assumes for himself the real
possession of 'sovereignty 1 (mulk) but he will entrust it to the King (malik)
only on the condition that he will be 'content with the Ordinance of God'. Thus
the Bab confirms the legitimacy of the secular power if the soul and the sword
of the King will be in his service to 'subdue the countries' and 'purify the
Sacred Land from dhl al-radd 1 . This clearly demonstrates the Bab's view on the
question of political power. However in this address to the Kings, the
'descendants of the kings' and the 'circle around' them,there is a consciousness
of the realities of the time. The admonitory warnings in this passage, warning
the ruler of the muslims not to be blinded by power and that he must answer for
his actions to the Zikr, may well refer to the Qajars in general and Muhammad

Shah in particular. The idea of purification of the Sacred Land may also be
taken as the Bab's response to the persecution and pressure on the Shi^is in
•Atabat which had culminated in the massacre of Karbila* by the Ottomans in 1258

(1842) . These invitations to worldly conquest were also justifiable for the

1\.   QA. I, folio 2a-3b.
2\.   See above Chapter One, II.

Bab in view of his plans for the final Khuruj from the Holy Land.

But criticism of the government is still better voiced in the passage in
which he explicitly addresses the Prime Minister Haji Mirza Aqasi:

> '0 minister of the king! (vazw al-malik. or vazlr al-rmlk)
> be fearful of God, for there is no God except he who is
-   the Truth, the Just. Withdraw your soul from the King

> (or the state) . Verily, I am the one who has inherited
> the earth and whatsoever is upon it by the leave of God
> the Wise' 1 .

The Bab is not only concerned with the theoretical legitimacy of the temporal
power but also with the realities of the political situation in Iran.       He rightly
recognises Haji Mirza Aqasi as the chief initiator of the state's policy and

denounces the authority which he holds only by means of influence over the Shah.
He makes his attack on the state more open when he states: 'Your sovereignty
is futile and God has placed worldly possession in the hand of the idolaters
In the second chapter called Sura at- ^Ulama* , the Bab deals primarily with the
responsibility of religious authority.       Remarkably, he identifies the fulama as
a strong force which exercises great influence in the society.

> 'Ol assembly of (ulama, fear God in your verdicts from
> this day for the Dhikr is among you from our presence
> and truly he is the witness and the judge. Shun all
> that you are receiving from other than the Book of God,

> pp.304-14) cited an interesting risalih by Haji called Shiyam-i FakhrZ in
> which he alludes to his spiritual authority over the Shah.
3\.   QA. II, folio 3/a-b.

In the same admonitory style imitative of the Qurbn, the Bab calls upon the
(ulama to base their verdicts upon 'pure knowledge'.    Though his tone is not as
critical as in the first chapter dealing with the secular power, he still
categorically denies ijtihad and with it the position of the Usuli mujtahids.

Both the return to the concept of Pure Religion and Pure Knowledge and the open
denial of rational striving may suggest the presence of   'radical'    trends
in the ideas of the Bab.   As often in the past, the idea of 'purification' is
interwoven with millenarian beliefs, yet this attention to the 'pure' values of
the past should not be confused with the fundamentalist trends of the Akhbaris
or the Wahhabis. Here emphasis on the 'purity' and 'sanctity' of the past is
because of the idealistic message of the movement which tends to employ a
language of symbols and terms with esoteric connotation. Thus the concept of
the 'pure religion' is not so much a return to the standards and values of the
past, as it is an assertion of the new interpretation of these values which the
Bab believed to have originated from the same divine source.

The two above mentioned chapters in Qayyum al-Asma* summarise the views of
the Bab and the Babis towards the state and the ^ulama in the early days and
therefore play an important role in explaining the practical policies of the
movement. It was partly to deliver this message to the ^ulama and the secular
authorities that the early disciples were assigned to their missions. Besides
the general assignment for all the disciples to attract favourable elements to
the movement, some were especially entrusted with specific tasks. As far as
can be understood from the sources, as indeed from the course of the events,
Mulla 'Ali Bastami
and a few others such as Mulla Jalil Urumi and Mulla Muhammad

'Ali Qazvini were assigned to deliver the message to the Shaykhis and the non-
Shaykhi fulama of ^Atabat. Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi and Sayyid Ibrahim

Karbila'i were also chosen amongst the non-Shaykhi ''ulama to be addressed.
Because of their anti-Shaykhi attitude in the past, these messages were only
designed to be a 'final warning* (-itmam-i hujjat)

, so that when the 'Time'
arrived they would be held responsible for their actions. Mulla Husain

on the othe:
hand was assigned to undertake the mission inside Iran and to travel to Isfahan,
Tehran, and Khurasan where, after gathering the 'supporters', he would lead
them to the ^Atabat. Also in this journey, he was instructed to deliver the
message of the Bab in Qayyum al-Asma' (and possibly some other works of the Bab)
to the state authorities in Tehran. Mulla Yusuf Ardabili returned to his home­
land Azarbaijan perhaps with the same intention of gathering new converts to
accompany him to ''Atabat. A few others also returned to their home towns. The

Bab himself accompanied by Mulla Muhammad ^Ali Barfurushi, was to travel to

the Hijaz later in the same year.

The episode of Shiraz may well be defined as the moment of birth for the
Babi movement. In a pattern familiar to most messianic movements, after a
period of intense messianic expectation, a 'revelation 1 occurred to fulfil some
particular prophecies. In its actual occurrence, this was a spontaneous process
which involved the claimant and the converts almost without any previous
intention on their part. In its theoretical background, however, it was the
fruit of a long advance towards a more realistic and plausible image of the
Zuhur. The fulfilment of the past prophecies may seem to be an irrational

indulgence in some predestined fantasies of the past undertaken by a handful of
mystified individuals who were isolated from the realities of their time.
Nevertheless, owing to its very formation, the Babi movement was an attempt to
employ the ideals of the past, an almost mythological rather than historical
past, to interpret a changing age. The Bab and his disciples were perhaps
unaware of the nature and even sometimes the symptoms of this change, or were
vague about the ways of facing it, but in their own ways they had a historical
consciousness of the inadequacies of the ideas and values which dominated their
time. They were too preoccupied with the past ideals to be able to plan a
sensible and effective policy and, as we will see, too inconsistent to execute
it, but they had a dynamism in their outlook and the will to put their message
across to others who shared the same awareness with them.

CHAPTER FIVE

The Episode of the ^Atabat

After the primary discussions in Shiraz 1260, the first and the largest
group of the early believers set out for the 'Holy Land' (Ard al-Muqaddas) .
A prominent member of this group, Mulla 'Ali Bastami, was assigned the task of
delivering the message of the Bab to the prominent ''ulama of the ^Atabat and
also informing the members of the Shaykhi circle of the advent of the Bab and
preparing them for his forthcoming public call in the ''Atabat. This was regarded
by the Bab and his disciples as an important test for the future success of the
movement.
In this chapter some attention is first paid to Bastami and then the
achievements of his mission are examined in the light of the general situation
in the 'Atabat. The impact of the Babi call and its effects on the prominent
Shi'i leaders are also discussed. Then consequences of this encounter with the
Shi'i 'ulama, the outcome of the introduction of the new messianic element into
the already tense religious situation, and the way this affected the balance
between various religious factions are looked at in some detail. Finally, the
episode of Tahirih's stay in ''Atabat and her role in the development of the

earlier dispute is studied in a separate section.
Mulla Ali Bastami was one of the leading members of the small group of
disciples of Shiraz of 1260 and according to Qatil Karbala'i, was regarded as
the third in importance after the Bab and Mulla Husain Bushruyihi . He was born
in Bastam,

a small agricultural town on the north western border of Khurasan
sometime in the early 1230's (1810's). He first studied the 'elementaries'
(muqaddcmat) in his home town before moving to Mashhad for further studies. Like
many Shaykhi tullab from Khurasan he was first attracted to the Shaykhi school

o -                                               —
in this city . Under the influence of the Shaykhi teacher Mulla Ja^far

3\.   For further details on Khurasan! Shaykhis, see below Chapter Nine.

Kirmanshahi, himself a student of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i , as Qatil puts it:

'he gradually turned away from the superficial and shallow knowledge which is
nothing but the opinion of the common people (al-^ilm al-zdhir al-qishr va

ma^rifat al-^awam al-sirf) towards the high status of contemplation (al-jah

'2                       f                                      for
al-tafakkur) . He then travelled to 'Atabat and studied under Sayyid Kazim

seven years. His knowledge of Shaykhi literature and his 'piety and lack of
worldly interests' gave him a distinctive character amongst the Shaykhi tullab.

According to the Babi sources he became one of the senior members of the circle
and a close companion of Rashti. After long residence in Karbila* sometime in
the mid-1250 f s (1830*s and 40's) he returned to Bastam mainly because of family

pressure but he could not stay in his home town more than two years before
returning to Iraq. It seems that his life in Bastam and his commitment to his
wife and family did not long keep him from Karbila* .

On his return, Mulla 'Ali accompanied Rashti in his last annual pilgrimage
to Najaf in 1259 (1843) shortly before the latter's death. Qatil names Bastami

amongst those who understood Rashti's allusions and responded to his allegorical
remarks. 'He grasped the secret of knowledge in the whole circle of ascent and
descent, that is spirituality and tariqa

1 . After the death of Rashti he joined
Bushruyihi in his retirement in Kufah and later led a group of twelve Shaykhi
students, to whom he was the leader, to Shiraz . Thus because of his seniority
and his position among the Shaykhis of Iraq, it was natural that he should be
chosen for the 'Atabat mission. Lack of further information prevents us from
examining the way he was active in converting many of the Shaykhi mullas who
followed him to Shiraz, but no doubt the veneration of the Babi sources and the
high qualities which were attributed to him are not without any real basis.
When Bastami set out on his mission to Iraq after his conversion in Shiraz,

he passed on his way through Bushihr, where according to his instructions he
visited the Bab's uncle, Haji  Sayyid Muhammad Shirazi, and gave the news of the

*             •

Bab's proclamation. But, as appears from later evidence, Haji Sayyid Muhammad

did not respond to the Bab's call and at that time did not even realise the
significance of his claims .
From Bushihr, by the sea route via Basrah, Mulla ^Ali arrived at ''Atabat

some time between the end of Rajab and the early days of Ramadan 1260. Following
him, some of the.Letters who had first accompanied Mulla ^Ali to Shiraz also

left Iran for Iraq . As far as can be traced, it is almost certain that five
of them: Mulla Jalil Urumi, Mulla Muhammad 'Ali Qazvini, Mulla Mahmud Khu'i,

Mulla Khudabakhsh Quchani and Mulla Baqir Tabrizi were present in Karbila* in
the months after the proclamation. The arrival of these 'messengers' in ^Atabat,
nearly seven months after Rashti's death, exacerbated the leadership crisis

within the Shaykhi camp . As has been described in previous chapters, even
those few senior followers of Sayyid Kazim who had assumed leadership, at least

on a temporary basis, did not enjoy the full support of the students. Those
Shaykhi followers who did not join the Kufah group, and remained in Karbila',
would not even submit temporarily to the authority of the acclaimed leaders such
as Mulla Hasan Gauhar and Mirza Muhit Kirmani. Furthermore, the challenge from

'Atabat , as well as the rivalry between different groups and factions made it
impossible for any of the senior followers to unite all the students under one
leadership. Shaykh Sultan Karbala'i, himself one of the early believers of

'Atabat, and later one of the companions of Tahirih, in his treatise refers to

certain rival factions with some differences in approach within the Shaykhi

camp .   Though his main attention is focused on the events of 1261-3 (1845-7),
it is also evident that in the early months of 1260 the formation of these

factions was in progress . In fact, this spirit of messianic expectation caused
the Shaykhis to be unwilling to comply with the choice of a leader from amongst
their own ranks. Hence    for this reason they welcomed the promulgation of the
new message as a solution to the existing deadlock. Aqa Muhammad Mustafa al-
Baghdadi, whose father was a well known mujtahid amongst the Shaykhis, records
that before the appearance of the Bab 'all the adherants (i.e. Shaykhis) in
BaghdacJ and its outskirts were mournful at the departure of the late Sayyid,
but in the meantime they remained vigilant and watchful for the appearance of
the "Promised One" (Zuhur- al-Mu'ud)

-   till they came to the honour                   3

of his presence 1
Confusion and uncertainty amongst the Shaykhis of ''Atabat is clearly
detectable in Qatil ! s remarks when he refers to his own state of mind shortly
after Rashti's death: 'I could not decide whether I should lead my way towards
Jabriya or towards Qadariya or towards Balasariya who are Mufawwada and Dahriya.

»
Then when the time elapsed, after four months and a few days, the herald called
from heaven the name of Qa'im from the land of Pars' 4 . The above remark suggests
that already in early Jumada I 1260 (April 1844), the news of the proclamation in
Fars had reached Atabat. But it took nearly three more months before the first
group of believers from Shiraz returned and confirmed the rumours and at least
partly clarified the appearance of the new Bab.

The announcement by the Babi Letters on 26th Rajab 1260 in Najaf took place
according to plan, with the utmost precaution in order to avoid any trouble from
an unexpected quarter when the Shi ^i public were gathered from Baghdad, Hilla,
Karbila* and other places in Najaf to celebrate the day of Mob ^afh (27th Rajab) .

On one of the earliest encounters which occurred between Babis and the Shi'i
public, Qatil Karbala'i, who probably himself witnessed the event or at least

became aware of it through an eye witness, recalls:

> 'Then they (the people) heard from one of the pseudo-
> jurisprudents (muti-faqqihln^ that they (the Letters) had

> about the news and the manner in which they had achieved

> accelerated (public) opinion towards denial'1.

Following this, further preliminary preaching carried out by the Babi Letters
prior to the main declaration by Bastami which was due to take place later.

These efforts were mainly concentrated on the Shaykhis and particularly on those
who had a greater degree of sympathy and understanding of Rashti's later messianic
ideas.    But as had previously been agreed upon, the message of these preachings
was limited to general admonitions without exact reference to the identity of the
Bab.     Rarely in this period was the identity of the Bab publicly revealed, and
when in private       his name was mentioned, it was only to those whose loyalty and
thoroughness had been examined.

The general tone of the Babi missionaries was to prepare the public for the
forthcoming arrival of the Bab.       This is well illustrated in the preachings of
Mulla 'Abd al-Jalil Urumi, one of the Letters of the Living and a companion of
Bastami in the       Atabat mission, who particularly emphasized the 'extraordinary'

events which were due to take place at the time of the advent of the Imam.             In
his talks no specific reference was made to the precise name of the 'Promised One'
and although he referred to him as the Bab of the Imam, and even in some cases as
the successor to Rashti, at the same time he attributed to him qualities and
characteristics which were traditionally expected of the Qa'im . In fact, Urumi
and the others intended to project an image of the Bab, which could encompass not
only the claim of succession to Rashti and assumption of the state of Babiyat ,
but also prepare the public for the far greater claim of Qa*inriyat.         To most of
the Letters and to some of the distinguished believers in 'Atabat, it was known
that this was only a preliminary tactical device to introduce the message in
successive stages 3 .

> Qat~l. (511). The author's reference to one of al-mut-ifaqqilvin suggests that
> perhaps one of the Balasari 'ulama, who for an unknown reason had some know­

> the Babi disciples.
Ibid.                                  3.   See above Chapter Four, II & III.

The effect of these early preachings is clear from Qatil's account when he
reports that:

> 'After Rajab (1260 Q.) the cause of the Imam, peace be
> upon him, became so well known that no one from the
> committed people (mutakalliftn) of that district (^Atabat)
> remained who had not heard or did not understand ... and

> Balasarls and those people of Kazimayn who were weak in
> their Shi^i beliefs, and also the attendants of the Holy
> Shrines and all those who in the past frequently had the
> honour of his presence'1.

Beside its general implications, it is likely that by the term mutakalltfin,
Qatil. particularly refers to the supporters whom the Babi missionaries attracted
from the Shaykhis of 'Atabat, although this is not to deny the enthusiasm with
which they were also received by the nonTShaykhis of both Persian and Arab

. . 2
origin .

One of the most important persuasive factors in this early support was the
previous acquaintance of some of the later converts with Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad at
the time of his pilgrimage to the Holy Places of Iraq, which had impressed them
to the extent that even after a few years, the memory of him had not faded 3 .
Even those who did not have the chance to see him on that journey seem to have
been impressed by the oral accounts and stories which magnified the piety and
innocence of the young Sayyid. But still the recognition of supernatural claims
from an unknown and uneducated Sayyid was a formidable problem even to the most
vigilant Shaykhis. In the account of his conversion, Sayyid Javad Karbala'i
reflects his doubts and uncertainties at the time when first he was informed of
the appearance of the new Bab 5 . He states that the announcement by Mulla- ( Ali

Bastami regarding his knowledge of the new Bab created great excitement amongst

•                       _

the learned men of Karbila' and it was this influence and highly esteemed
position of Mulla 'Ali amongst the Shaykhis that were the chief reasons for the
circulation of the new message .       But as he recalls some years later:

> 'Mulla 'All was only content to reveal the title of his

If the piety and charm of the young Shirazi Sayyid by itself was not enough
for the recognition of the assumed position of Babiyat, what other elements
attracted a large group of Shaykhis towards the Bab? As has already been
discussed, the influential position of Bastami, and to a lesser extent the other

Letters, amongst both the junior and the senior followers of Rashti, facilitated
these conversions particularly at the time when a considerable degree of
confusion and scepticism lingered over the question of the succession. Further­
more, the Bab's claim was still wrapped in mystery and very few in Atabat knew
precisely the nature of his claims. This secrecy by itself was a source of
attraction.

These were perhaps the symptoms of a deeper problem which divided the Shaykhi
community into the two camps of the 'millenarians' and the moderates, a division
which had already caused the split of the group which consisted of Bushruyihi,
Bastami and the others and led them towards the proclamation of the Bab in

1\.       Ibid. 71, cf. Qatll. (503).
2\.       Kashf dl-Ghita* op.cit. 71.

Shiraz .  Hence, recognition of the Bab in ''Atabat reflected polarisation in the
Shaykhi ranks, and the intention of the extremist 'millenarians' to strengthen
their position against the moderates.  While one side wished to fulfil the
messianic expectations, the other side tried to undermine the messianic side or
confine it to the boundaries of mere academic argument. As has been previously
discussed such division was directly co-related to the position of the Shaykhis

f
in the Shi i society of Iraq and the pressures which were put upon them not only
from the quarter of their Balasari opponents, but also from the Sunni

authorities . Hence the recognition of the Bab by S.haykhis, or the later
activities of Mulla Ali to broaden the sphere of the movement beyond the Shaykhi
community 3 , may best be interpreted as manifestations of the millenarians'
response in the face of these mounting pressures.

The Babi community which formed around the nucleus of the early believers
between 1260-63 (1844-7) absorbed Shaykhis, and occasionally non-Shaykhis from
various backgrounds and with different degrees of attachment to the Shaykhi
school. Some sources allude to the existence of a considerable number of
sympathisers.  Rawlinson, the contemporary British representative in Baghdad
who recorded certain details about Mulla Ali's mission, confirms that 'a
considerable section of the Sheeahs (Shi Tis) of Najaf T supported Mulla- (Ali-4 ,
while Aqa Muhammad Mustafa Baghdadi mentions various groups of students and
adherents who following their mujtahids, were attracted to the new movement 5 .
Qatil also confirms the overwhelming support of the Shaykhis prior to the
occurrence of the first signs of strong Balasari opposition .

However the majority of those who were regarded as confirmed believers were
Shaykhi students or those who previously held some relation with Sayyid Kazim.

As far as can be traced, of the total of more than one hundred converts in ' Atabat,
nearly half were either Persian or of Persian origin. Of the remaining half more
than two-thirds were natives of Iraq who resided in Karbila', Najaf, Baghdad and
its neighbourhood. The origin of the remaining one-third is not known . The
Arab group included some mujtahids of relative importance such as Shaykh Bashir

Mulla Ahmad Mu'allim Hisari  who remained in 'Atabat were soon converted by

Bastami and the other Letters. A few Persian merchants with Shaykhi tendencies
also joined the Babi group. Amongst them the Nahris, who later moved to Isfahan 2
and a certain Haji 'Abd al-Muttalib, a resident of Kazimayn, who later in 1264

provided the necessary means for fifty Arab and Persian Babis of Iraq to travel
to Iran and participate in the march from Khurasan to Mazandaran, may be
mentioned 3 . In addition, there were groups of Shaykhis from Qazvin, Isfahan and
Mashhad who, in order to participate in the public declaration of the Bab in the
beginning of 1261, hastily arrived in Karbila*. Of these, the Qazvin group headed
by Mulla Javad Valiyani included some of the Qazvini converts who later after the
cancellation of the f Atabat plan, returned to Shiraz and met the Bab 4 .

As a whole, the composition of the Atabat group makes it clear that neither
Arab or Persian origin nor clerical rank was the prime factor in the shape of the
Babi grouping. However, as with many other Babi groups in Iran, the majority of
the converts were from the lower and middle rank ulama. But more than any
other factor, it appears that dedication and attachment to the head and leader
was the prime cause for the coherence of the group which held them together in
spite of outside pressure. It is true that the preaching of Mulla Ali Bastami
which heralded the advent of the Bab, was the main impetus for the majority of
the Shaykhis who joined the movement, but in the course of the next few years,
it was in the charismatic and highly influential personality of Tahirih that
these messianic aspirations were materialised. References to the Babis of
Atabat with the name Qurratiya (the followers of Qurrat al- Ayn, i.e. Tahirih)

-       r     -  - - r5
in some of the contemporary writers such as Shaykh Shihab   al-Din Mahmud Alusi  ,
may be taken as an indication of Tahirih f s significance for the continuation of
the Babi circle in ( Atabat.

Tahirih herself was informed of the proclamation of the Bab through a letter
which was delivered to her by Mulla Ali or possibly Mulla Muhammad Ali Qazvini,
in reply to her earlier petition which she had presented to the unknown Bab when
the Mulla Husain party were departing from Atabat a few months earlier .

Nuqtat a l-Kaf confirms that after reading the writings of the Bab, 'she reached
the state of testimonial certitude' (iman-i shuhudi.) . This corresponds to

r\
NabTl's remark on 'the Bab's immediate response to her declarations of faith'
and Mu in al-Saltanih's remark that 'in reply to her letter, an exalted Tauqi ^
was revealed to her honour' 3 . However there is some degree of uncertainty
regarding the date of her arrival at Karbila' which could indicate the time and
place of her full conversion.  Most sources agree that she arrived shortly after
Sayyid Kazim's death in the last days of 1259 (January 1844). Later Tahirih her-

•   _                    _                                  .

self in a risalih in reply to Mulla Javad Valiyani recalls the events as though
she had been present in Karbila' at the time . But in this same risalih a few
pages earlier she states that 'at the beginning of his excellency's cause (i.e.
the Bab), I was in Qazvin, but as soon as I heard of this cause, even before
reading the holy commentary (i.e. Qayywn al-Asma') or Sahifa al-Makhzuniyat i
recognised it' 5 This could only be justified if we assume that she heard of the
Bab before 1260 in Qazvin. Considering the fact that through her brother-in-law
Mulla Muhammad Ali Qazvini she was in touch with the developments in Karbila'

and therefore even before arriving at Iraq, she was aware of the possible
succession of the Bab, this is not a far fetched assumption. But at any rate it
is certain that she was in Karbila' from the latter part of 1260 onwards .

By the end of Ramadan 1260 (October 1844) , about two months after the arrival

of the Babi party, the propagation of the new message reached a new stage. On
Friday 23rd of Ramadan (6th October 1844) , following earlier arrangements, Mulla
fAll officially made the declaration

of the Babi cause, and presented the people
of Karbila' with fragments of the new Furqan. A week later, at the time of
al-Fitr (Saturday, 1st Shawwal 1260 = 14th October 1844) he again announced the

'approaching advent' of Qa'im to the people of Najaf, while 'bearing a copy of the
Koran (Qura"n) which he stated to have been delivered to him by the forerunner of
Imam Mahdi ' 9 .

It is not a coincidence that on both occasions an Islamic holy feast was
chosen for the declaration. The night of 23rd of Ramadan is, according to some
traditions, regarded as 'Laylat al-Qadr' ]^ , the night which is 'better than a

thousand months' . It was on this night that the first suras of the Qurfan were
sent down to Muhammad: *Behold, we sent it down on the Night of Qadr' . Here
again the Babi actions are particularly designed to accord with the Shi i
prophecies on the Night of Qadr. In addition the term Furqan, which in many Babi
sources appears in the same context as the Quran and Kitab, generally refers to
the Bab's first major work Qayyum  - al-Asma3
- 4.

It is precisely in this context,
and according to this Quranic tradition that Qayyum al-Asma' was first represented
to the public by Mulla ^Ali Bastami. The significance of such representation

in the name of a 'proof and 'divine Book' is clear from most of the sources.
While some sources refer to Qayyum al-Asma* as Furqan others use terms such as

— 6      —       —         — 1        — 8                             —        —
Qurfan , Qur'an—i. Sahib al-Zaman and Kitab . Several references in Qayyum   al-Asma 3

to Furqan could be regarded as the origin of the use of the word in Babi termin­
ology: 'Thus God sent down the Quran to his servants in order to inform people
that he has power over beings. He is the one who sent down Furqan in Arabic to
his servant without an deviation for the sake of pure truth' 9 .

In Quranic tradition, the term has a broad and rather complicated meaning.

The word occurs in various connections in the Qurbn and in most cases corresponds
to the concept of 'deliverance', 'redemption' and 'salvation from Judgement'. In
a broader sense the word indicates the holy scripture in each revelation and
particularly in Islam as a 'sign which confirms the prophethood'. The term also
represents 'the separation of an accepted religious community from the
unbelievers' . However in the Babi literature, the term is not only used for the

Bab's 'falsely compiled Furqan' , Qatll argues that the new Furqan is the inner
truth (bat-in) of Muhammad's Quran which is fundamentally reinterpreted and

* . .     *           . 4

reappeared in its complete version . On this basis, the author suggests that in
fact the Bab's Furqan is a new version of theQur'an which contains revelations
according to the necessities of its time in order to explain the unintelligible
passages of the Book.

The theological argument between the two controversial works, namely those
of Izhaq al-Batil and Qat~l, who are both amongst the nearest sources to the

period, suggests that the question of the newly compiled Qurbn had great
significance in the earliest controversies between the Babis and their opponents
in Atabat.       Indeed, the very use of the term Furqan confirms that what was
propagated by Bastami and others regarding the position of the new Bab, was not

simply concerned with the succession of Rashti, but more significantly hinted at
the advent of a new 'revelation' which appeared to complement the previous Book
and resolve the 'ambiguities' and 'shortcomings'.

The sharp edge of these messianic promulgations, however, was directed
towards those non-Shaykhi ulama of Atabat who because of their previous
opposition to Shaykhism, were held responsible for the 'ignorance' of the majority
of the Shi is about the teachings of Ahsa'i and Rashti. The increasing hostility

of the past few years and the intensification of sectarian hatred against the
Shaykhis under two eminent mujtahids, Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi in Najaf and

Sayyid Ibrahim Qazvini in Karbila', no doubt persuaded the Bab and his disciples
to express their disapproval of the fuqaha's conduct in plain and straight terms .

author of Jawahir al-Kalam fi Sharh Shara'-i? al-Islam , one of the most celebrated
faqihs of the whole nineteenth century, accomplished his studies under Shaykh
Ja 'far Najafi and other important jurists of the early nineteenth century .
Towards the end of his life, Shaykh Muhammad Hasan was recognised by most of his
contemporaries, and particularly by a considerable number of fuqaha*as the head
of the Shi ^is (riyasat—i Imamiyih) . The author of Raudat al-Jannat particularly
states that 'the leadership of the Imamis in our time among Arab and 'Ajam
devolved on him when in 1262 he reached his seventies'        Indeed one may see the
earliest formation of the position of Marja^-i taqlid when towards the end of his
life he designated one of his students, Shaykh Murtaza Ansari as his successor.

According to one source Shaykh Najafi 'appointed him before his departure as the
"appointed Khalifa and special deputy" and he was later recognised by the public
as the first general Deputy of the Imam (Nai 3 b—i Imam) ' . This suggests that
perhaps Shaykh Muhammad Hasan himself assumed this title (Na 3 ib—i Imam) after
which he was then * able to* deliver it to his successor 8 . On the other hand,

(Tabaqat, II, 1, 311).

Ibrahim Qazvini  places Najafi's leadership chronologically later than Sayyid
Muhammad Baqir Shafti and then Sayyid Ibrahim Qazvini , which also corresponds
to Khvansari's above mentioned remarks. However, it is clear from the above
sources that by the year 1260, while both Qazvini and Shafti were still alive,
Shaykh Muhammad Hasan enjoyed a prominent position in the Shi i community,

particularly in Najaf.

Thus, the choice of Shaykh Najafi as the first mujtahid to be informed of
the Babis 1 message was not accidental. His prominent position, his lifelong
efforts to promote the science of fiqh in place of the less dogmatic branches of
Shi i knowledge, and above all his long and bitter rejection of the Shaykhi
doctrine, made him the living embodiment of Shi i orthodoxy. Thus, Bastami's
address to NajafT signified more than anything else the final stage of this
prolonged conflict which eventually turned to open hostility between the two
opposite sides. Although Shaykh Muhammad Hasan, according to some sources, even
received an i-jazih from Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i , he did not hesitate to denounce the

Shaykhi cause in later years. In the early years of the 1240's Q. (circa 1823-26),
during the first denunciation of the Shaykhis, Shaykh Muhammad Hasan, following
other fuqaha'also expressed his opposition by issuing a fatva condemning Shaykhi

doctrine . His condemnation of the Shaykhis was not only aimed at Shaykhi
discontent with the ever increasing influence of jurists but also directed at
their treatment of Imami ahadfth . Sayyid Kazim alludes to the direct involvement
of Shaykh Najafi in later pressure upon Shaykhis after the death of Ahsa'i, when

6       —                          _ •     _ _
in a new initiative against them , Najafi together with Sayyid Mahdi Karbala'i and
Shaykh Husain Najafi reasserted their condemnation of the Shaykhi leader . In

the view of Sayyid Kazim, the chief motive for the whole anti-Shaykhi drive which

even extended to India, was the increasing popularity of Shaykhism, both in and
out of ^Atabat, since eminent mujtahids such as Najafi were greatly concerned
with this popularity and 'fearing that the public may abandon their "obedience"' .
Shaykh Muhammad Hasan did not confine his opposition to the Shaykhi school

alone but included in it the other unorthodox tendencies.   The author of Q-isas
3 quoted him as saying 'It was to abolish hikmatthat God chose Muhammad

— 7                 —   —               *               —      *
ibn ''Abdallah' . In fact Tunikabuni does not venerate Shaykh Najafi in the same
manner as other influential mujtahids. He, in conformity with other sources 2
gives some evidence of Najafi's wealth and worldly possessions and vaguely hints
that even his laxity and lack of clear discipline in bestowing certificates
(•ijazih) and confirmation (tasdiq) on his students were not only due to his weak

judgement, but to his desire to strengthen his position in the struggle for
leadership .

No doubt Mulla Ali was aware of Najafi's characteristics when he approached
him in Najaf to inform him of 'the immediate manifestation of the Imam 1 .
Addressing him in his class in the presence of students and followers, Bastami

openly proclaimed the appearance of the Hujjat and supplied Najafi with at least
two works of the Bab; a special tauqi,* addressed to the Shaykh together with
sections of Qayyum al-Asma* . Basing his argument on Surat al- Ulama 3 , Bastami

maintained that 'in the year 1261, the mystery will be revealed and the victorious
cause (of God) will dominate' . As the second sura of Qayyum al-Asma 3 questions
the legitimacy of ijti.had, Mulla Ali reminds the Shaykh that as the head of the
Shi ' i community, he is bound to respond to a message which calls for re-evaluation
of the ulama's position and only permits the attainment of the 'pure knowledge'

—                                                — 9 . On the same

as an alternative to the principle of ijtihad
ground Bastami claimed that by demonstrating an unequal ability to reveal the

word of God, 'the unschooled Hashimite youth of Persia' is the only righteous

authority on the earth .   Emphasis on 'unlearned knowledge 1 and the superior
ability to reveal verses, were in fact two recurring arguments employed by the
Bab and his disciples to justify the truthfulness of the cause.

But it is likely that, more than anything else, the two issues of divine
inspiration and the 'immediate manifestation' enraged the old Shaykh.      His
response to the claims which were put forward by Mulla   Ali was harsh and
uncompromising. As was to be expected, the chief mujtahid not only rejected the
contents of the Bab's message as 'a blasphemous production' but also 'denounced

f\

Mulla 'Ali as a heretic' and expelled him from the assembly .      But what perhaps
was less predictable for Bastami was the extent and gravity of the measures which
were adopted in response to his address. This was caused by an unexpected alliance
of opposing groups against him.

A group of ulama of Najaf and Karbila* under the direct influence of Shaykh
Muhammad Hasan formally denounced the newly born movement 3 . Furthermore, a number
of the Shaykhi (ulama also took part in the action 4 . It seems that the wide­
spread Babi preaching alarmed some individuals such as Mulla Hasan

Gauhar who, in
spite of their earlier acquaintance with Bastami,

were anxious to use the occasion
to express their opposition. As Nabil states 'even the Shaykhis who already
testified to Mulla Ali's piety, sincerity and learning' joined hands with the
disciples of Najafi, who were originally their adversaries to warn Bastami 'of
the danger which he incurred in giving currency' to the Babi prophecies .

Nevertheless, in spite of-these threats, a large section of the Shaykhis of
(                                ~ f —

Atabat continued to support Mulla Ali, regarding him as the representative of
the true Hujjat. They were 'in avowed expectation of the speedy advent of the

Imam ... and declared themselves ready to join the Precursor, as soon as he should

7                                     — f —
appear amongst them' . Because of this very support, Mulla Ali continued his
challenge and followed his previous plans to prepare the public for the arrival
of the Bab. As a result of these preachings, shortly afterwards towards the
middle of Shawwal 1260 (end of October 1844) , the opponents of Bastami

were able
to draw the attention of Turkish authorities to the danger of the new 'heresy'.

7\.   Ibid. Rawlinson's remark indeed verifies the reports of the Babi sources

> regarding the sense of messianic expectations in 'Atabat at the time of
Bastami's propagation.

The widespread distribution of the new Quran provided some concrete proof for
some Shi'i elements to accuse the Babis of what Rawlinson calls 'local
dissuasions' .   Nabil Zarandi even reports that the supporters of Shaykh Muhammad

Hasan themselves took the initiative and arrested Bastami, put him in chains and

delivered him to .the local Turkish authorities . But whatever the circumstances
were, it is clear that his arrest was with the cooperation of the Shi'i elements
in Najaf who seem to have been sufficiently disturbed to bring the Ottoman
authorities into the conflict.   Eventually Bastami was arrested on charges of

blasphemy and disturbing the public peace, and sent to Baghdad to await further
interrogation 3 .

The arrest of Mulla Ali Bastami by the Ottoman authorities gave a new
dimension to what was originally an internal Shi i problem. It was partly because
of the existing social and political circumstances in Iraq that Bastami's arrest

and then trial became an overwhelming issue to the province. The question of a
new prophetic revelation with all its theological implications affected a wide
range of political and religious interests and this eventually led to a confront­
ation which to some extent overshadowed the primary issue of the Babi claims.
Gradually representatives of various groups and factions, both Shi i and non-Shi i,
became involved in a dispute which provided the opportunity for them to demonstrate
their importance. Not only the Ottoman governor of Baghdad and the representatives
of the Iranian and British governments, but also Sunni religious authorities of
different attitudes became in one way or another involved in a case which was no
longer confined to charges brought against the 'new heresy', but had the effect
of bringing to the surface the long-standing political and factional tensions
between the government-supported Sunni ulama and the long persecuted Shi i
public. In the words of Rawlinson:

In the renewal of these sectarian tensions, the events of the previous years
and particularly the memory of the massacre of Karbila* in 1843 by the order of
Najib Pasha the governor of the province, had some part and no doubt the Shi i
public was alert and watchful of the outcome of Bastami's arrest. One may even

suspect that the swift arrest and handing over of Bastami by the followers of

Najafi was also intended to deprive the Ottoman authorities of any pretext to
cause further trouble. The appointment of Najib Pasha (1842) as the vali of Iraq
in place of the more lenient and tolerant Muhammad Riza Pasha noticeably increased
the fears of the Shi f i fulama who particularly after the reassertion of the

Turkish authority in Karbila* were more submissive to the Ottomans than before .

This change in the political climate of the province was further boosted by
the attempt to impose more powerful and centralised government 3 . Najib
.T Pasha

-    was
a ruthless governor who combined intelligence and courage with strong Sunni

convictions .       He descended from a noble and influential family in Istanbul
which enjoyed close contact with the Ottoman court . His appointment to the
troublesome and relatively backward pashaliq of Baghdad was partly due to the
intention of the Tanzimat

reformers to introduce some degree of reform into the
affairs of the province. In fact the harsh suppression of the Karbila* rebellion
would seem to have been an aspect of the application of the policy of greater
centralisation which was Najib's mandate on his appointment .

Though Najib's governorship was distinguished by some degree of success and

efficiency , it was marred by a combination of socially repressive measures,
heavy taxation which seems to have been used for his private benefit and markedly

discriminatory policy towards the minorities . This policy was regarded
particularly unfavourable by the Shi'i public which traditionally felt some
sympathy with Persia and therefore regarded the Turkish vali, as an oppressor
whose efforts were directed towards the elimination of their traditional
liberties.     Furthermore problems such as the Shi^i resistance to Ottoman legal
authority in Holy Cities, the persistance of the Shi'i mujtahids in maintaining
some form of local autonomy 3 , dissatisfaction of the Persian merchant community
in Baghdad with the newly imposed levies 4 , and the sense of grievance caused to
Persian pilgrims to the Holy Cities by the imposition of passport restrictions,
combined with long-standing troubles of incessant tribal clashes on the eastern
frontiers, endless border disputes with the Persian government over the Kurdish
boundaries and the control of the port of Muhammarah exasperated the already

grave relations between the vali, and the Persian backed Shi i community.

In dealing with the religious resistance, Najib hardly tolerated any
challenge to the authority of the Ottoman jurisdiction. On a few occasions he
strongly condemned the chief mujtahid of Karbila', Sayyid Ibrahim Qazvini, for
exercising Shi i jurisdiction in issuing fatvas on legal questions instead of
referring the matter to Ottoman Hanafi courts. In his letter to Sayyid Ibrahim

he writes:

In some instances he did not even hesitate to act with more severity and to
punish or even execute those who tried openly to challenge the domination of the

r\

Hanafi shav^ .. However, Shi 1 mujtahids such as Shaykh Hasan Najafi Kashif al-
Ghita', who feared for his personal safety, Sayyid Ibrahim Qazvini who was
practising taqiyah and Sayyid Kazim Rashti, in order to be protected against his

opponents , reconciled themselves with him, even if this compromise was against
their personal or religious values and principles. On the return of Najib from
his assault on Karbila* for example, Shaykh Hasan Kashif al-Ghita',  whose maternal

uncle had already been executed at the time of the previous voli, for a minor
charge of contempt to Sunni shar , had every reason to act cautiously when he
received Najib Pashah in Najaf. For three days Shaykh Hasan   provided every

hospitality for the val-i and his retinue in order to prevent Najib from carrying
out similar reprisals on the Shi'is of Najaf .

Under these circumstances, while the Shi *i population of Iraq was undergoing
some constraint, relations with the authorities did not improve even if they did
not actually worsen. The case of Mulla 'Ali Bastami   became the focal point for

the aspirations of that section of the community which after the massacre of
Karbila', was in search for an outlet for its resentment of increasing Ottoman
pressure. Thus it seems that Bastami's case to some extent attracted the

sympathy of the low rank tullab, discontented Persian merchants and all tho-se who

detested the compromises made by the high ranking mujtahids.

When Mulla Ali was brought to Baghdad, Najib Pasha, perhaps following
earlier examples, treated the case as a religious matter and referred it to the
official Sunni Ottoman court in the hope of reaching a mild and acceptable

outcome.    After the event of the previous year in Karbila' it was unlikely that
Najib, who was aware of the general Shi^i discontent, would attempt to aggravate
the uneasy peace which had been achieved in the last few months.      As Rawlinson
reports:

But the chief Sunni    ulama of Baghdad seems not to have held the views which
Rawlinson predicted.    In the primary gathering of religious judges and officials
in the Government House for the purpose of examining the charges against Mulla
Ali, the  ulama who represented the Sunni Shari. a were ready to demonstrate

their full legal power . In the brief cross-examination which followed the
enumeration of Bastami's charges, the  ulama upheld the charge of blasphemy and

recommended the maximum penalty of death for the Persian infidel . Indeed as is
evident from Rawlinson's report, contrary to the Pasha's earlier reassuring
platitudes, he now expressed approval of the verdict of the tribunal.      A few
lines later in his dispatch, Rawlinson reports that: 'Nejib Pasha, whose sectarian
prejudices are excitable, has, I regret to say, allowed himself to adapt to their
full extent, the views of the Soonee (Sunni) officers and I foresee that a
determined effort will be made to obtain the condemnation and the execution of
the unfortunate Shirazee (Shirazi)' .

This apparent change of direction on the part of the shrewd governor may be
explained in terms of internal sectarian conflict between the two rival religious
bodies which he deliberately fostered in order to neutralise the considerable
influence exercised by each side.   The manoeuvres of the Pasha demonstrate the
problem which he faced in dealing with the sensitive relations between the Shi i
and Sunni communities. The sentence passed by the Sunni court which had 'taken
up the case in rancorous spirit of bigotry' could not be accepted by the Shi is
who regarded the sentence as an attempt by the authorities to subordinate the

f\              *
Shi ''is to Sunni jurisdiction . From the Shi i point of view, compliance with such
verdict was equal to submission to other restrictions which would inevitably
follow this case.

In response to these apprehensions expressed from the Shi i quarter, Najib
Pasha, who feared that the 'sympathies of the entire Sheeah (Shi i) sect' might
be provoked, decided to postpone his ratification of the court's verdict pending
further investigations. In fact, a combination of internal and external forces
which were interested in the outcome of the trial, demanded a more balanced and
cautious trial by a group of jurists who would represent the main parties involved.

Following a series of long and bitter conflicts between the Persian and
Ottoman governments over the past few years, the response of the Iranian
authorities to Najib Pasha's real intentions was one of caution and mistrust.
At this time there was being held the Erzeroum (Arz-i Rum) conference which was
originally convened at the instigation of the British and Russian governments to
settle various border disputes between the two countries as well as other problems
such as the traffic of pilgrims and the status of Persian citizens resident in
the Holy Cities; important issues which were directly connected to Najib Pasha's
behaviour were still at stake and the Persian government could hardly afford to
be put in a more difficult position by another disaster such as the Karbila*
massacre 4 . In the circumstances the case of a Persian subject was certainly
serious enough to make the Persian authorities anxious about the consequences of
the trial which was bound to affect the whole Shi i community in Iraq and even
jeopardise the already shaky equilibrium in Erzeroum. As Rawlinson indicates:

'In the present state of irritable feeling which exists between the governments
of Persia and Turkey, I cannot doubt, but that the capital punishment of the
Shirazee or the persecution of the "Transendentalists" of Nejaf, will be viewed
with much exasperation by the court of Tehran' .
Muhibb ^Ali .Khan Makui, the governor of Kirmanshah, who was probably acting

with Haji Mirza Aqasi's approval, had already protested at the improper arrest

and imprisonment of a Persian subject on 'mere accusation' . In a friendly letter

to the British Consul in Baghdad , regarding the long detention of the 'inferior

Priest of Shiraz' , Muhibb Ali Khan insisted that even if he were guilty of the

charges, 'he ought not to be subjected to arrest - if his crime were proved, his
punishment should be that of banishment from the Turkish territory'.   He then
asked Rawlinson 'as a well wisher to the preservation of friendship between the
two governments' to interfere in this matter and suggest to Najib Pasha that 'if
the guilt of the Persian be fully substantiated, he may be sent to Kermanshah, in
order that I may transfer him to Tehran for punishment, 'and if on the other hand,
the accusation against him proves to be malicious and without foundation, he may

be at once released and set at liberty' .   But it was clear that the motives of
the Persian authorities in acting in support of Bastami did not spring from

humanitarian or indeed sympathetic feelings. In fact, according to Rawlinson:
'the Persian Government has itself on several occasions sustained inconvenience
from imposters, professing to be the forerunners of the Imam Mahdi' 2 . Nor did
the British representative in Baghdad show any more clemency when he declared
that '... it must be thus fully cognizant of the necessity of crushing at the
outset any popular movement connected with such a matter.. 1 3 . Thus, his
recommendation to Stratford Canning, the British ambassador in Istanbul for
'interposing the pleas both of humanity and policy in favour of the condemned

parties' , seems merely to reflect the British policy in the Ottoman Empire of
maintaining a certain degree of freedom for the religious minorities in order
to minimise the amount of sectarian conflicts in the provinces. As in the case
of Iraq, such conflict could easily lead to further disturbances and
consequently affect the British political and even commercial interests in the
area. The British interest lay in the reduction of tension and prevention of
any further deterioration of Perso-Ottoman relations.

In fact, in reporting to the ambassador, Rawlinson hoped to encourage
Canning to take measures which would ultimately reverse the Baghdad verdict.
It had happened in recent cases that British intervention had saved the lives
of religious offenders who were convicted by the Sunni tribunals. A few months
earlier, Rawlinson, in the case of a Christian who after a forced conversion,
denied his new faith , reports to Canning that:

> 'There has been a good deal of discussion among the

Furthermore, he acknowledged that 'Najib Pasha had already received
instructions from his Government to refer to Constantinople, wherever a case
occurred in this Pashalic of a Christian who had embraced Islamism returning
to his former faith'

This provided a precedence for the British consul to intervene in the
matter by forcing the stubborn Pasha to refer the case to the authorities in
Istanbul for further instruction.     It seems, however, that Najib Pasha resisted,
at least for the sake of appearance, any intervention or mediation by a foreign
power which could only worsen his position in an already difficult situation.
'His Excellency is not disposed to listen to any foreign mediation or inter­
ference 1 writes Rawlinson:

> 'In reply to my own communication he has observed that
> Persian subjects residing in Turkey are in civil,
> criminal and religious matters, entirely subject to
> Ottoman law, and that neither the Persian government,
> nor the Consuls of that power, nor the High Priests of

according to the forms and usages of Soonee tribunals ...' .

Recent concessions concerning religious minorities could only cause dis­
content amongst those Sunni ulama who observed the gradual decline in their
judicial power, not only by the introduction of new local officials but also by
instructions from the central government. In turn, such discontent could be
dangerous for the Pasha who in the eyes of the Sunni public was held responsible
for the handling of the whole affair.        To tackle so sensitive a problem, which
involved not only local religious figures, but the Persian and Ottoman govern­
ments, a foreign representative and above all the Sunni and Shi i public, the
Pasha who was fully aware of the delicacy of the situation perhaps with the
advice of the central government put forward the suggestion of a court of
examination which would consist of representatives from the parties involved.
Rawlinson reports:

> 'Najib Pasha at the same time, to give all due formality

Whatever the outcome of the controversial tribunal might be, Najib was
aware, as his subsequent actions show, that it would be possible for him to
overrule the verdict and duly refer the case to the higher authority in Istanbul.
Should it be necessary as he finally assures Rawlinson: 'he will not attempt to
carry such sentence into execution either here or at Najef, pending reference
to Constantinople ...' .   But in order to arrive at a suitable result, Najib
Pasha needed to balance the different parties represented in the tribunal.      A
brief study of the ^ulama who were present at the Baghdad trial reveals that the
va1i> carefully invited only those parties who would foil each others' initiatives,
On the one hand, the Sunni delegation headed by the mufti of Baghdad was eager to
oppose the growing Shi i self-awareness and on the other hand the Shi i
delegation composed of comparatively conciliatory mujtahids such as Mulla
Ibrahim Qazvini and Shaykh Hasan Kashif al-Ghita', though reluctant to come to

an open confrontation with their Sunni counterparts, were nevertheless ready to
resist matters which might lead to further subordination and humiliation of the
Shi ris.

The most eminent of the Sunni 'ulama who participated in the trial was
Shaykh Abu al-Thana* Shihab al-Din Mahmud Alusi, the influential mufti of Baghdad

and the author of a number of well known theological works , who seems to have
made use of the occasion to remind both the governor and Shi i mujtahids of his
religious superiority. As a prominent religious figure he had not hesitated to
take part in the political life of the province in the time of previous pashas.

1830 's came at the time when the Ottoman central government was in dire need of
local support against Muhammad Ali's threat to Iraq. In a well known work
al-Tibyan fi Shark al-Burhan fi Ita at al-Sultan , which was commissioned by

_9   *— — —           *           *
Riza Pasha , Alusi not only glorified the Ottoman Sultan, but even went as
far as to legitimise the authority of the Ottoman government and the necessity
of obeying her sovereignty according to the Islamic Shavi a .         Thus with rare
exceptions, as a whole Alusi was firmly on the side of the Ottomans and their
representatives in the province.

Alusi 's view, however, in relation to Shi ism, seems to have undergone some
changes over the years.         In 1249 (1833) he devoted a whole chapter in his above
mentioned al-Tibyan to the subject of Imama where he strongly criticised the
Shi f i theory and particularly attacked Shi ( i views on the expected Imam 4 . This
may be regarded as the Sunni response to the Shi i anti-Ottoman feelings of the
time which were particularly expressed in some Shi i circles.         But Alusi 's
opposition to Shi ism seems to have been modified towards the end of his life
when the danger of Shi i supremacy was over. In his last work Nahj al-Salama Ha
Mabahith al-Imama written in 1278 (1861-2) , when he deals with contemporary

schools such as Shaykhlyah and Babiyah, he tries to maintain an impartial
approach to Shi ism and its internal divisions . As a whole Alusi 's treatment
of Shi 'ism suggests that he was prepared to tolerate a co-existence with Shi is
only as long as they did not pose a serious threat to the superiority of the
Sunni Shar ' .

On the Shi'i side the two major mujtahids, Sayyid Ibrahim Qazvini and
Shaykh Hasan Kashif al-Ghita', in the words of Rawlinson, were 'most unwilling 1

to attend the Baghdad trial . The reluctance of the Shi^i ''ulama was presumably
because of three main reasons.   First, it was because of their sceptical
attitude towards.a case which was not only exposed to much publicity, but would
also provoke an open clash with the Sunni opposition. Secondly, they were
conscious of the fact that the main beneficiaries of thes'e trials would be the
va.l'i and the Sunni Mufti who would oppose the Shi'i defence under all circum­
stances. Thirdly, the adoption of an independent position different to that of
the Sunni authorities would in practice mean the defence of a 'heretic' who
neither because of his Shaykhi background nor because of his present stand was
acceptable to the orthodox ulama. Perhaps this very consideration prevented
Shaykh Muhammad

> Hasan

Najafi from participating in the trial though, as he was
the first person who handed over Bastami

to the Turkish authorities, it is
highly unlikely that he had not been invited to the gathering. Nevertheless,
these disadvantages were compensated by the fact that for the first time a
formal recognition of the position of the Shi i jurists was implied. Further,
participation in the trial, so long as it did not result in the ratification of
a severe anti-Shi i verdict, could even elevate their position in the internal
Shi i clerical structure, particularly those mujtahids who were prepared to come
to terms with the Ottoman authorities.

Sayyid Ibrahim Qazvini in particular according to his student Mirza
Muhammad Tunikabuni, was 'very prudent, and no-one ever heard him saying a word
of condemnation or criticism in a gathering or in public' . He was the chief
mujtahid of the Balasari majority in Karbila* , and is mostly known because of

expense of the Balasaris, caused Qazvini to be more apprehensive of his own
standing .    Nevertheless his troubles with Shaykhis hardly ever came to an open
confrontation.  For example, in reply to a request by the Shi is of India to
give his opinion on the condemnation of the Shaykhis, he carefully answered
with a few equivocal and moderate quotations from the Qur'an and hadith 2 . Later,
he even tried to prevent one of his adherents, Shaykh Mahdi Kujuri, from
publishing a refutation which was intended to reply to Sayyid Kazim's Da1i,1

Qazvini was also for a long time, the receiver and distributor of the Oudh
Bequest and other endowments in Karbila' . This delicate task, which by itself
indicated priority in the religious rank and contributed to his influential
position in Iraq, caused him to incur perpetual rivalry from other quarters in
the Shi'i community. On a number of occasions not only eminent mujtahids such
as Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi used all means at their disposal to receive the

lion's share , but also others such as covetous tullab or even the head of the

Yarmaziyah brigandage in Karbila' virtually blackmailed him in order to get part
of the annual benefits . Although Qazvini's relations with the Turkish
authorities were occasionally troubled by issues such as the validity of his

Noticeably, on several occasions Sayyid Ibrahim's intervention saved the lives
of Shi'is in Sunni official courts    .     One may suspect that perhaps his

highly respected by both Shi     is   and Sunnis alike   . Thanks to the friendly
relations between Kashif al-Ghita*'s family and Ahsa'i it seems that Shaykh

Hasan's attitude towards the Shaykhis was moderate compared to many of his
contemporaries. Ddli.1 al-Mutdhayyivin refers to Ahsa'i's occasional visits to

on the question of jabr and adl . Later, during the subsequent waves of
condemnation and persecution Shaykh Musa and Shaykh Ali, both elder brothers of
Shaykh Hasan tried to abate the Balasari enmity and even to bring about a

reconciliation between the two parties. Shaykh Hasan's good relations with the
Ottoman vali, were also instrumental in his appointment as the chief repre­
sentative from Najaf.

that the Turkish governor was anxious for all different factions within the
Shi ^i and Sunni camps to be represented .             The eight known Shi fi fulama who were
invited, represented almost all the different tendencies on the Shi ^i side.                In
addition to fuqaha'from Karbila*, Najaf and Kazimayn, the Shaykhis were also

represented by Mulla Hasan Gauhar . His presence side by side with other jurists

at the trial in which the future of a Shaykhi was at stake confirms Mulla Hasan's

conciliatory attitude.         In fact his unclarified stand tilted him so much in the
opposite direction that even Agha Buzurg Tihrani states that; 'It is not

possible to say that he was an absolute Shaykhi single because he studied under
the above mentioned (i.e. Ahsa'i and Rashti) and therefore he should be regarded

•   S)

as being of the Mut-ishawi, 'a 1 .         His anti-Babi attitude is also noted by Na'ib
al-Sadr who points out that although 'he was one of the close adherents of the

late Sayyid, he rejected both factions' of Babi and Rukni (presumably the

-    -      - - 4

followers of Karim Khan Kirmani) . At the time when he was still regarded by
some as the temporary successor of Rashti , this inclination towards non-Shaykhis
seems to have further weakened his position amongst the majority of Shaykhis .
Thus, his presence at the trial should be regarded as an attempt to retrieve
his position.      Another Shaykhi dignitary, Shaykh Muhammad Shibl Baghdadi, was

also invited presumably to represent the Arab followers of Rashti.               But being a
believer in the Bab he decided not to participate in the trial. 'He left
Baghdad in haste since he reckoned that the vali, intended to obtain approval for
the refutation of the cause of God '.

On the Sunni side however, it seems that the entire delegation was under

of the Qadiri order in Baghdad who was a former pupil of Alusi who maintained
friendly relations with his teacher . The previous mufti of Baghdad Muhammad

Sa^id Afandi who had been previously dismissed by Muhammad Riza Pasha, was also

---                       -2             .1 _ _
a Naqshbandi Sufi originally from Irbil . No doubt Alusi's sympathy for Sufism
brought him closer to the other two Sunni participants of whom he speaks in his
writings with reverence and respect . But it appears that this Sufi attachment
in no way lessened the commitment of the Sunni ulama to the exercise of Shar .

The composition of the tribunal would indicate that the mere occurrence of
the Shi i/Sunni encounter was striking enough to affect the whole of the Shi i
public. It is possible to suggest that Najib Pasha's attempt to hold the
Baghdad trial was a primary experiment with the introduction of a provincial
majlis recommended by the Tanzimat. Thus Shi'is in particular regarded the

tribunal as a major step forward in gaining equal rights in matters of religion
and legal practice. The prospects of such a gathering were encouraging enough
not only to overcome the mujtahid's original apprehensions but to attract the
attention of the Shi i notables. This is illustrated in Al Kubba, a highly
influential Shi i family of Baghdad who were anxious to provide all necessities
including a new robe for Shaykh Hasan Kashif al-Ghita* in order to dignify the
appearance of the Shi f i f ulama in the eyes of their ' opposition 4 .

Far from the excitement and publicity which surrounded his case, Mulla Ali
was spending his third month in the Baghdad gaol. Through some contacts that he
managed to establish with the outside, he was still able to transmit his teachings

had heard (from Bastami) to the believers.     During this brief period, a great

I
number of people were converted' .
Apart from Shaykh Muhammad Shibl, who perhaps due to his position was able

to visit Bastami, other visits also took place.     Rawlinson reports:

> 'This individual (i.e. Bastami), who is timid, ignorant
> and I should say entirely harmless, pleaded on his first
> arrest that he was a mere messenger not responsible for
> the contents of the volume entrusted to his charge, and

> the inspiration of the perverted passages, and I am
> apprehensive, therefore, that according to Muhammedan
> law, whether expounded by Sheeas or Soonees, he will be
> convicted of blasphemy .
These important remarks by Rawlinson suggest that although Bastami,

at the time
of his arrest, perhaps in line with the practice of taqiyah, tried not to reveal
any direct connection between his own beliefs and the text of Qayyum al-Asma* ,
yet he could not convince the authorities of his innocence. Later, during his
confinement in Baghdad, either by his own wish, or else under the pressure of
the authorities, it seems that he confessed in the presence of witnesses to the
belief that the author of Qayyum al-Asma* was motivated by divine inspiration.
Further, Alusi's involvement is also apparent from the report which shows that
the chief mufti, was anxious to collect evidence, even by deceit or force, in
order to defeat his Shi'i opposition, as well as to discredit the preacher of
a movement which, though detested by the Shi^i mujtahids, still represented the
revival of certain Shi i messianic forces.

The growing interest shown in the case by the public must, no doubt, have
encouraged the vati to set the date for the Baghdad trial. Baghdad^ states:

'when the Government saw that the following of the cause (i.e. the Babi movement)
is increasing day by day, the vali t Najib Pasha ordered the ^ulama to be present
in Baghdad' 3 . When on Monday 4th Muharram 1261 (January 13th 1845) the court

according to Babi predictions, the unknown Bab himself would appear in the Holy
Land (i.e. 'Atabat) and start his Khuruj . This timing would suggest that Najib
who was anxious about the possible revolt of the pro-Bastami public, decided to

hold the trial and gain the necessary fatva of condemnation before the due date
for the arrival of the Bab.

With Najib Pasha presiding over the assembly the trial started. The court
was chiefly concerned with three issues. The first was the nature of the
prophecies contained in the Bab's new Furqan. Further, in order to prove other
charges concerning the apostasy of the messenger, it was necessary to investigate
the content of the text. On this point, as far as the sources are concerned,
there was a unanimous belief on both sides that the book was 'a blasphemous

production' . Both sides were well aware of the potential danger of the pro­
nouncement in Surat al- Ulama* , calling for the mujtahids' resignation in favour
of the promised Zi/cp3 . The court also agreed that 'parties avowing a belief in
the readings which it contained were to be liable to the punishment of death' 4
Though the Babis were not specifically mentioned by name, this was the first
known fatva of the ^ulama which required punishment of death for belief in the
Babi cause.

After reaching conclusion on the first issue, the court proceeded to the
second issue regarding Mulla Ali's personal belief . Here, it seems that the
court decision was meant not only to affect Bastami, but to set an example for
other Babi activists, but Shi i and Sunni points of view were widely divergent
over this matter. The Sunnis who represented the dominating Hanafi law on the
basis of earlier conclusions argued that since 'this book is an innovation
(bid^a) , its bearer is also an innovator (mubdi ) and amongst the "corrupters
of the earth" , and therefore liable to death' . In reply, Shaykh Hasan Kashif
al-Ghita*, expressing the Shi i consensus, put forward a delicate technical

objection.   After a long and well documented argument in support of his
objection, he concluded that in this connection 'the book by itself could not

— C      —        — 8
be regarded as a piece of firm evidence' (la amal fi al-qirtas) and so long as
its bearer is unaware of its contents and does not believe in its claims, it is

impossible to pass the sentence of death .   Kashif al-Ghita''s objection, which

was primarily designed to save the life of Bastami, demonstrated to his Sunni

counterparts Shaykh Hasan's skill in dealing with juristic problems and know-

ledge of Hanafi law.

_ r _      _ _
As a result of this objection, Mulla Ali Bastami  was closely cross-

examined. Nearly all sources agree that his belief in the contents of the new
Furqan was scrutinised by the court. But his reply differs from one source to
another. Baghdad^ states that in reply to the court's question about the
identity of Sahib al-Amr, Bastami maintained that; 'He is the righteous expected

soul. He appeared and he is the one who was anticipated by the Holy Books' .
The author even goes as far as to suggest that Mulla Ali 'glorified the Cause'
by reciting some of the verses and prayers of the Bab to the jury and invited

them to recognise the Bab's call . Contrary to the above account, Rawlinson in
conjunction with his earlier remarks reports that 'he (i.e. Bastami) himself
distinctly repudiated the charge' , while Qi,sas at- Ulama relates that in reply

to the court inquiry the accused maintained that he had no knowledge or insight
into the contents of the Book and his belief was the belief of all muslims .
Such sharp contrast between the above sources, prevents a firm conclusion
regarding Bastami's response being reached . Yet, it is most probable that

Bastami, bearing in mind the Bab's recommendation of taqiyah, the danger of
making any public confession, and the Shi i-Sunni conflict, acknowledges the
mujtahid's assistance and avoided any direct commitment to the 'Book'.

Here, the chief mufti» trying to substantiate the charge against the Shi i
objection, presented his witnesses to the court . But it seems that he was

hardly able to provide any firm evidence against Mulla ^Ali.    'Although
witnesses were brought forward, who stated that he had in their presence
declared his adoption of the spurious text, of which he was the bearer' reports
Rawlinson, 'yet as there was reason to suspect the fidelity of their evidence,
the Shi i divines were disposed to give him the benefit of his present
disavowal' . In accordance with the above account, the author of Nabdhat at-
Gharra* also indicates that it was Shaykh Hasan who, in spite of the mufti's

persistence, once again made an objection and referring to Mulla ' Ali's own
statement, maintained that 'Since he repented, according to Shari^a, I accept
his penitence' . Following these remarks by Kashif al-Ghita* a long discussion

«

took place between the two sides during the course of which, according to Shi' i
sources, Shaykh Hasan finally established his point on the basis of Hanafi

jurisprudence and with detailed references to relevant sources . But it seems
that in spite of all their logical reasoning, in the end the two sides could not
reach any agreement on the question of Bastami's fate. The verdicts of both

parties as Rawlinson formerly predicted, had a secondary importance to the
Turkish authorities. 'After much discussion the Soonee law officers adjudged
the culprit to be convicted of blasphemy and passed sentence of death on him
accordingly, while the Sheeahs returned a verdict, that he was only guilty of
dissemination of blasphemy and liable in consequence to no heavier punishment

than imprisonment or banishment' .

According to Rawlinson, though this is not confirmed by any other sources,
a third issue was also raised in the trial concerning 'the other parties
implicated in the affair' . Here the British consul certainly refers to the
pro-Bastami Shaykhis. It is possible that the growing activities and preachings

of the Babis had irritated the 'ulama as much as the governor. Naturally as
the report indicated; 'The same difference of opinion was found to prevail
between the Sheeah and Soonee divines 1 . While the Shi is were in favour of
forcible removal of all 'parties openly avowing a belief in the expected
immediate advent of the Imam', from the Holy Cities, the Sunnis recommended a
tougher line and called for 'punishment of death' .

Here a distinction should be made between the various sources regarding the

charges brought against Bastami and others in the court.      This has great

significance for the outcome of the trial since it illustrates the way in which
the penal Islamic code was adopted in the case of the new Babi 'heresy'.          Qisas
al- fylama' implies that the ground for the prosecution of Bastami was bida *

•      •*

muharrama (unlawful innovation) and he was accused of being mubtadi          , whereas

Rawlinson states that the charge of blasphemy, which perhaps could be translated
as ilhad, was levelled. However the allusion in Nabdhat al-Gharra' regarding

Shaykh Hasan's acceptance of Bastami's penitence (tauba) suggests that the charge

brought against the latter was most probably irtidad (apostasy) which is punish­
able both according to Shi i and Hanafi law, by death, particularly in the case

. *2

of an apostate who was born muslim . Thus it is very likely that the main
difference of opinion (ikhtilaf}. between the two sides was on the right of the
accused to have an opportunity to repent and return to Islam since the views
of the jurists in both Shi i and Sunni schools of fiqh differ in this matter.
This provided a chance for the Shi is to challenge Alusi and other Sunni jurists

However, according to Tunikabuni, Sayyid Ibrahim Qazvini was silent all through
the trial because 'he was extremely timid and never abandoned the practice of

taqiyah 1 , and therefore the main responsibility fell on Shaykh Hasan

to try to
nullify the Sunni opinion on two main grounds; first, by making a distinction
between the bearer (rasuV) and the content of the 'blasphemous book', and
secondly, by emphasising the fact that even if the accused could be regarded as
an apostate he should still have been given a chance to repent.

But whatever the opinion of the two sides might have been and however eager
they were to have their verdicts prevail, it was fairly clear to all the parties
involved that neither of the sentences passed was going to be put into effect
before reference was made to the Sublime Porte. As Rawlinson states: 'The
different opinions have been duly recorded and attested and a reference on the

understanding amongst the 'ulama present at the trial supports the view that
most of the quarrel between Shi i and Sunni over the case, was merely for the
sake of their legal and religious standing in relation to the Ottoman central
authority.   Both sides were anxious to demonstrate their independence in legal
and juristic matters.      While the Shi is were apprehensive that defeat in the
trial might be used as an excuse for applying further pressure upon them in
order to subordinate them to the Ottoman law, the Sunni muftis were anxious to
demonstrate to the Sublime Porte that in their view there was no room within the
newly introduced reforms for any compromise with the Shi'i 'ulama.

As far as Bastami was concerned, the result of the Baghdad trial, as might

have been expected, had little effect on his situation.       He remained in Baghdad
gaol for another three months      before any instruction from Istanbul concerning
his case reached Baghdad.      But nevertheless, the question of the BabLs' appearance
must have preoccupied him.      As the date of the Bab's arrival, during mid
Muharram 1261, approached, the excitement reached its highest level.       A

'considerable uneasiness is beginning to display itself at Karbila* and Najef
in regard to the expected manifestation of the Imam' writes Rawlinson towards
the end of his dispatch; 'and I am apprehensive that the measures now in progress

will rather increase than allay excitement' .
But as the time arrived, and the critical period of mid Muharram passed

without incident, the delay and finally the cancellation (bada'} of the Bab's
journey to     Atabat caused bitter disillusion and resentment to those who
believed that the manifestation of the Bab would end the hardship and persecution

forced upon his messenger . For Bastami himself, though none of the sources

recorded any information regarding the rest of his imprisonment in Baghdad, it
is not impossible to assume that he himself must have been worried about the
effects of cancellation both on himself and on the future of the embryonic Babi
community in     Atabat.   In practice it seems that his worries were not misplaced.
In spite of the presence, at least for a period of time, of a noticeable number
of Letters in the Holy Cities who are surprisingly absent from all the accounts
during the period of the trial, no fresh attempt was made either to organise

the sympathisers or later to challenge the governor's decision to keep Bastami

in custody. Till the emergence of Tahirih as an influential leader, the early

Babi community in Iraq suffered from the consequences of Bastami ? s arrest and

trial and the cancellation of the Bab's plan to visit ^Atabat.

Meanwhile the efforts during the following months by the Persian and to a
lesser extent British government to settle Bastami's case through diplomatic

channels produced no definite result. Towards the    middle of February 1845
(early Saffar 1261), Haji Mirza Aqasi, who by then   was informed of the result

of the Baghdad trial, instructed the Persian agent   in Baghdad 'to demand the
delivery into his own hand of the priest of Shiraz   imprisoned for blasphemy,
with a view to his deportation to Persia' .
Here it may be asked why Haji

Mirza Aqasi was so anxious about the fate of
an 'inferior priest of Persia'. After all, if Mulla Ali had declared his
mission in Iran and been tried under Shi i jurisdiction, he would hardly have
received any better treatment from the authorities, witness the trial and
persecution shortly afterwards of many of the supporters of the Bab. The answer
lies in the Persian policy towards the Ottoman government. Beside all the moral
and political commitments felt by the Persian government towards its subjects in
Iraq, Haji

was obliged, perhaps because of the pressure of public opinion, to
take action on a case which demonstrated clearly the growing Ottoman pressure to
subdue Persian subjects fully to its authority. As is evident from the dispatch
sent by Rawlinson to Sheil in February 1845, the fears and apprehensions of the
Persian population of Iraq had not yet fully diminished:

> 'The condemnation to death of a Persian Moolla at Baghdad

A few days later, the British ambassador in Istanbul as a result of
Rawlinson's report and perhaps also because of the Iranian demand, in concert

with the Russian minister, impressed upon the Porte 'the expediency of issuing
instruction to the Governor of Baghdad to abstain from putting the individual
in question to death, inflicting on him the mildest punishment consistent with
the public tranquility' .   It is probable that both the British and the Russian
representatives who were concerned about the effects of this recent event on
Ottoman-Persian relations, used their influence to prevent the Ottoman govern­
ment from taking any drastic action.     The British consul in Baghdad seems to
have been conscious of the fact that Turkish persistence in carrying out any
tough measures would result in further sectarian conflict; 'the more in fact
these Mujtahids are degraded by the Turkish government, the more complete, I
think, will be their ascendancy over the minds of their disciples and the only
results, therefore, which are likely to attend the proscription of their public
duties, are the more complete isolation of the Persian community of this
province, and an increase of the rancorous feeling with which the dominant

Soonee party is regarded' .
Finally the Ottoman government which at first seemed reluctant to make any
positive response to foreign diplomatic pressure but preferred to use Bastami

as a means of demonstrating strength in its relations with Iran, decided to make
a gesture of good faith. On 14th April 1845 (24th Rabl^ al-Awwal 1261), Najib

Pasha received instructions from Istanbul to transfer Bastami  to the capital .
On 30th April 1845 (10th Rabi*" al-Thani 1261) Rawlinson reports that with the
last Baghdad post, 'the Persian priest of Shiraz so long detained in confinement
at this place, was sent to Constantinople' . By the removal of the central
figure from the area of controversy to Istanbul, the case was reduced to an
insignificant issue in the Ottoman capital .

After his transfer to Istanbul, the fate of Mulla     Ali is not absolutely
clear since the sources either lack any information or else are uncertain,

confused or contradictory.  Nabil Zarandi compresses the whole matter into a
single incident , by quoting a certain Haji Hashim ''Attar as saying that: 'On
the night of that same day (i.e. Baghdad trial) he had departed to

Constantinople' . Then putting alternative suggestions on what eventually
befell Mulla 'Ali, he continues; 'A few believed that on his way to
Constantinople he had fallen ill and died. Others maintained that he had
suffered martyrdom' . Mirza Yahya Subh-i Azal on the other hand, states in his

- f' r4*
historical account that Mulla 'Ali , who according to him was originally on his
way to Rum (i.e. Istanbul) , was arrested in Baghdad and after the mufti's
fatva was moved to Istanbul. But, he continues 'near Baghdad    in a place known
as Badra'i he was poisoned and suffered martyrdom' .

The most significant and interesting account, however, is a brief report,
written by the Persian representative in Istanbul in reply to some enquiries
in connection with the Bastami affair, possibly from the authorities in Tehran .

According to this report, about the facts of which the writer claims to have
made personal enquiries, ' a certain Mulla Ali' on his way to the capital, 'was

held for a while in a place known as Buli , before being moved to the capital' .
He adds, 'they (i.e. the Ottoman authorities in Istanbul) summoned him (i.e.
Mulla 'Ali) to a gathering (majits) and enquired about certain matters, and he,
without thinking of practising any taqiyah, made certain verbal confessions.
Therefore according to the declaration of the Baghdadi      ulama and in view of
of his own confession, he was banished to Kurk (sic. presumably Kirkuk) for the

time being' . The above remarks throw some light on the final stages of the
Bastami affair in Istanbul.      It is clear that Mulla ''Ali did not hesitate to

accept charges which were brought against him, but the lack of further
information prevents us from specifying these charges.      However, the proceedings
of the Baghdad trial suggest that the enquiry was perhaps confined to the
question of 'dissemination of blasphemy' 4 , which according
.             f.

to the Shi'i view in
the trial, was punishable only by imprisonment or banishment .
One month after Bastami's exile the same Iranian representative in Istanbul

sent one of his officials to the Porte to protest against Mulla 'Ali's imprison­
ment.  He was probably instructed by the Iranian government to follow the case
in Istanbul. In his request to the Ottoman government he maintains that since
the prisoner who was sent to Kirkuk was a Persian subject he must be extradited
to his own country and 'if he is found guilty of any charges, he will be
punished by the exalted Iranian government' . In response, the Ottoman
authorities 'first denied that he was a Persian subject by claiming that he had
been a Baghdadi citizen, but after long persistance they gave way' .
But in spite of all these efforts, the close of Bastami's brief mission was

tragic.   'When they sent orders to Kirkuk to lift his chains and take him out
of prison, he had already passed away a few days earlier and come to the mercy

Q
of God' .  The cause of his death is not clear. While earlier hints concerning
the possibility of poisoning should be taken into account, it is also probable

that his death was due to prison hardship or some illness. The outbreak of
cholera in Iraq during 1261-2 (1845-7) could provide a satisfactory answer to
this question . However, it is arguable that had he survived he could hardly
have escaped a similar fate in his own country.

Bastami's mission to 'Atabat and the consequent events proved first that the

appeal of the new message was directed almost entirely to the Shaykhis who in
pursuit of their messianic ideas supported Bastami's mission at a time when

following their conflicts with the Balasaris and because of the lack of any clear
orientation after Rashti, they were seeking a decisive leadership. Secondly, the
expansion of the movement hardly went beyond the Shaykhi community since in their
attempt to deliver the message to the leading ulama of the Balasari faction,
the Babi policy of itmam-i hujjat was faced with total opposition. The growing
sympathy of the public to the new movement induced some of the 'ulama to seek
the assistance of the Turkish authorities, fearing that the revival of the
messianic tendencies would bring about further troubles with the provincial
government. Thirdly, perhaps contrary to the Shi'is' expectation, the Ottomans,
in cooperation with the Sunni muftis, took up the issue to tighten their control
over the Shi i community. Thus contrary to their will, the Shi'i 'ulama were
forced to intervene in the case, fearing that lack of action would be interpreted
as resignation from their legal and juristic responsibilities. The trial of
Baghdad demonstrated that in order to protect their own legal privileges, the
Shi i ulama were prepared to defend an individual who represented an attitude
totally against their own principles. But if in their manoeuvres they failed to
achieve an immediate supremacy over the Sunni muftis, at least they managed to
establish an equilibrium in which the messianic zeal of the Babis was checked by
the Ottoman measures without causing any serious threat to their own positions.
Bastami was not executed by the verdict of the Sunni muftis, but he was banished

from 'Atabat and with that, at least temporarily, were subsided the expectations
of   his followers.

From the early months of 1261 (1845) Tahirih gradually emerged as the new

leader of the Babi community in Atabat. In spite of the disadvantage of being
a woman, she was capable of taking her place amongst the ex-students of Rashti.

Her remarkable personality gave a new spirit to the Babis who as a result of the
events of the past few months were disillusioned and demoralised. Although a
full account of her life, character and ideas is beyond the scope of this study,
it is necessary to give a short sketch of her background before discussing her
role in the development of the movement, particularly during the years of her

19th century . Later, the two elder brothers moved to Qum, Isfahan and then

^Atabat where they were educated under well known Usuli teachers and acquired
their authorisation for igtihaa . In spite of their humble background and their
earlier poverty, on their return to Qazvin, both the elder brother Mulla Muhammad
Taqi and Mulla Muhammad Salih succeeded in accumulating a large fortune as well

as establishing their religious domination in the city. This was at a time in
the early decades of the century when Qazvin was thriving as a major trade centre
between north and south. Moreover, the Baraghanis enjoyed the full advantages
of circumstances which in the first half of the 19th century brought about the
rise of the high-ranking mujtahids as centres of religious and economic power.
Tahirih's father Mulla Muhammad Salih, was mostly known for his scholarly
works in tafsir such as Bahr al-^Irfan, in f-iqh such as Ghanimat al-Ma^ad fi

contrast to his elder brothers, adopted Shaykhi views and became a firm follower

and her sister Marziyih were brought up in a purely religious and
yet affluent environment. In her early youth, partly because of her personal
talent and partly because of her father's relatively tolerant outlook, Tahirih
found the opportunity to further her studies beyond the elementary level, some­
thing which was a novelty for a woman at the time. Under her father and her
uncles she perfected her theological and juridical knowledge to the extent that
it has been said that she preceded many of her father's students . Nevertheless,

in spite of her studies which apparently brought her even to the level of
ijtihaa , and in spite of her promising literary and poetic talents which she
developed in those years , she could not escape the family pressure which perhaps
against her will, obliged her to marry at an early age to her cousin Mulla
Muhammad Baraghani, son of Mulla Muhammad Taqi and later Imam Jum ih of Qazvin.

Of this marriage she had two sons and one daughter when she was still under
twenty five .

who provided for her some of Ahsa'i's writings 4 .

They seem to have had an immense influence on her and eventually converted her
to the Shaykhi school. Consequently, though she hesitated to express her views
in public, still she was faced with the reproaches of her elder uncle, her
husband and her father who all rebuked her for showing this devotion to Shaykhism
and dissuaded her against any further pursuit of her Shaykhi studies . However,
she seems to have enjoyed some support from her younger uncle, Mulla 'Ali, Mulla
Javad and later her brother-in-law Mulla Muhammad 'Ali Qazvini (son of Mulla 'Abd

al-Wahhab Qazvini and a later Letter of Hayy) who all were firm Shaykhis. Through

these contacts Tahirih corresponded with Rashti and sent him an apologetic

treatise which she wrote in vindication of Shaykhism. In reply, Rashti praised
her and addressed her as 'the delight of my eye and the soul of my heart' (ya
qurrat al- ayni wa ruh al-fu'ad) . No doubt Rashti was impressed by the talent

of the young woman, but he must have been also pleased that in addition to Mulla

Ali, he had found another ally in the immediate family of his arch-enemy, Mulla

Taqi. Yet such a consideration should not be interpreted as though
herself did not merit such high praise.
The ideological disagreements within the Baraghani family were so deeply
rooted that even the marriage bond could not prevent the inevitable separation.

Tahirih's open devotion to Shaykhis brought increasing quarrels and
confrontations with the family, particularly when her father-in-law publicly
attacked and criticised Shaykhis from the pulpit. Thus, as her relations with
her husband deteriorated, she decided to part with him and her children.
Apparently, at this stage her father either could not discourage her from
separation, or more probably agreed with her since he himself did not approve of
his elder brother's public condemnation of the Shaykhis. It should be noted that
his second daughter had been married to the son of Mulla Abd al-Wahhab Qazvini
who was a prominent Shaykhi figure in Qazvin . Shortly afterwards, in spite of
all the obstacles she decided, with the advice and assistance of Mulla Ali who
perhaps had seen in Tahirih an exceptional aptitude, to join the Shaykhi circle
in Karbila* .
Together with her sister Marziyih, she set out for Atabat towards the end

of 1259 (1843) . As was previously noted, her knowledge of the Bab's existence

her own remarks confirm that she was watchful for some form of revelation . It
is not clear whether she left Qazvin after Rashti's death or whether she was
indeed aware of the latter's recent death. When she arrived in Karbila' in the
last days of 1259 shortly after the death of Rashti , she found herself faced
with the controversy which divided the Shaykhi students. Although some reports
regarding her participation in the i'tikaf in the Kufah mosque should not be
relied upon , it is certain that from the very early stages she was supporting
the Bushruyihi faction.

Tahirih settled in the house of Sayyid Kazim and became closely acquainted

not only with Rashti's wife and the other women in the household, but with the
students and adherents of the late Sayyid . By staying in Rashti's house,
Tahirih benefited from the reputation of Rashti to strengthen her position
amongst the students and adherents. Moreover, by allying herself with the wife
of Rashti, Tahirih organised amongst the Shaykhi women a much needed support for
the cause of Sayyid Ali Muhammad   the Bab and his disciples. Such support was

important for the legitimacy of the movement: in the confusion which prevailed

_                 _                 _      2
after the death of Rashti, not only Rashti's young son Mulla Ahmad   , with the

persuasion of certain Mulla Husain  Khadim and others and with the tacit approval

of Gauhar and Muhit, put forward certain claims about his succession to his

father , but the two distinguished students of Rashti, namely Gauhar and Muhit,
by emphasising their self-assumed trusteeship (wisayat) , attempted to exercise

some authority over the private affairs of their late teacher . Although the
details of these factional differences are not fully clear, at least it is
certain that Qurrat al- 'Ayn played a major role in orientation of the. Shaykhi
students towards the Bab. Shaykh Sultan  Karbala'i's account makes it clear that

it was largely because of Tahirih's efforts that eventually a united party of

the Shaykhi-Babis were formed which could hold against both the Shaykhi and
Balasari hostility and intrigue.
Holding regular gatherings in the outer chambers of Rashti's house, Tahirih,

who spoke to the audience from behind a curtain, gradually gathered a large body
of Arab and Persian Shaykhis who after Bastami, offered their loyalty to her .

No doubt her predominance over them was primarily because of her personality,
which combined with her knowledge and her oratory skills, made a great impact

on those who saw in her signs of prophetic inspiration. For the greater part,
the teachings of Tahirih and her argumentations were based on Shaykhi ideas,

though in many aspects she went far beyond the limits which hold Shaykhism
within the boundary of Islam. Some sources report that in earlier stages she
even assumed the title of 'the Point of the Divine Knowledge' (Nuqtih-i

^         «• ^                                                   *
Ilmiyih-i Ilah-iyih) which would imply that perhaps she considered some
revelatory status for herself . The fact that she had her own independent views
on the matters of furu ' which were clearly contradictory to the Islamic code, and
the fact that she adopted certain ascetic practices such as devotional prayers 2
and abstaining from having meat, and cooked food 3 may also confirm her uncon­
ventional stand. Hence in this respect, her commitment to the Bab provided a
framework for the realisation of her views within a new system of beliefs.
Although at this stage it is difficult to say how far her commitment was a purely
emotional consequence of her messianic expectations or on the contrary was the
result of her thorough investigation of the Babi beliefs, nevertheless it is
certain that she truly believed in the new revelation as the inevitable outcome
of the Shaykhi teachings. It is only later in 1262 (1846) that it can be proved
for certain that she was aware of the ideas of the Bab as they were reflected in
his writings.
The surviving samples of Tahirih's works from this early period testify to
her considerable skill in making use of the Qurbn , hadith and tafslr for arguing
the theory of progressive revelations 4 . For instance in a treatise written in

1262 in reply to her cousin Mulla Javad Valiyani (who first became a follower of
the Bab but later following the events of 1261-2 abandoned the new faith and
even started anti-Babi activities) she discussed some of the essential points in
the Babi thinking that exemplified her argument, and perhaps that of many other
early Babis, with regard to the legitimacy of the Bab. Discussing the position
of Sayyid "All Muhammad the Bab in relation to that of Shaykh Ahmad

and Sayyid

Kazim, since this was a question which preoccupied many of the Shaykhis in this

period, she concludes that the Hujjatallah al- f uzma' , the title by which she
refers to the Bab, is the fulfilment of Shaykhi thought. She emphasises that
those students of Rashti who had not grasped the essence of his teachings to the
extent that Rashti expected, are naturally foreign to the concept of a continuous
process of unfolding revelation .

To prove her point she states that Rashti himself regarded his own position
as being above the Four Abwab of the Lesser Concealment and this, according to
Tahirih,

is a sign that after him the process will be continued to another
revelation of a greater magnitude since there is no evidence from the word of
God or that of the Guardians (Auliya*) or 'the abwab to the infallibles 1 (i.e.
Ahsa'i and Rashti) which prevents the occurrence of such complimentary

revelations . To acknowledge this unfolding process, she points out, it is
necessary to bear in mind that 'the divine norm' (sunnat-i i'tahT) basically
differs from 'the human norm' (sunnat-i bashari.) or indeed ffom the habits of
the past, and therefore 'the norms for testing the truthfulness of the Proof of
God are not apparent to the people 1 3 . Hence, to recognise the Proof, she suggests,
only an inner awareness of the divine norm, as opposed to the human norm, would
lead us to the right path. However, she immediately takes care to point out that
this inner awareness or indeed the awareness of the Bab himself of his mission
should not be confused with the theory of incarnation (hulul) of the 'blasphemous
Sufis' since by doing so one misses the essence or 'the secret of the secrets'
/                                    -4
(s'irv  al-asTO.?} of the new revelation .

To realise this 'secret of the secrets' and to prevent any false preception,
she insists that the teachings of Ahsa'i

and Rashti should be used as a 'key'
(miftah) for unravelling the complexity of this revelatory process. Here she
distinguishes two complementary concepts in Shaykhi thought: on the one hand she
prescribes mujahidah (spiritual endeavour) as opposed to mujadaldh (rational
argumentation) for distinguishing the truth . This would imply that contrary to
her verbal rejection of the contemporary Sufis, in many respects she is

influenced by the intuitive methods of Sufism.     She states that the truthful­
ness of the Bab, as indeed that of the prophets of the past, is only conceivable
'by insight of the heart and (search) for the true essence' (bi-nazar-i fu'ad va

—        — 1                                                   *
haqiqat-i. zat) .
But in Tahirih's view, this intuitive approach is inseparable from hikmat

' -             2                                           - *
reasoning (dalil-i Insikmat) • What makes such an inherence between rnujahidah and
dali,l-i> h-ikmat a necessity is that according to her, the latter is complementary
to the former for acknowledgement of the fact that 'in every age there is a
necessity for a bearer (hamil) and interpreter who would supervise in all

matters' . This was a significant aspect of the Shaykhi-Babi thinking that
employed hikmat (in this sense theosophy or more precisely theosophical method-
ology) in order to justify a continuous spiritual progress of man, and hence
conclude that 'the emanation of God and His favour is unceasing' . The rational
outcome of such an assumption was the percept of 'progress' which the Bab, and
following him the Babi writers such as Tahirih, adapted in their arguments.
Here the maxim: 'the cycle is in progress' (KauT dar taraqist) -   5 contains one of
the essential concepts of Babi thought since the term cycle or Kaur which could
be better defined as cycle of the universe or the forward movement of man in
the rotation of celestial spheres, was used in a historical sense.
Distinguishing between the past and the present, the Babi writers alluded to a
sense of betterment in the course of time which though not without precedent in
Islamic history, was essentially irreconcilable with the basis of Islam. This
was Tahirih's

prime concern in seeking a £ 'revelation' since at the basis of the
Bab's theory of successive resurrections lay a vision of the future which could
only be materialised if a break occurred with the past. Perhaps this very

> interpretation should be taken as the origin of a widening difference between
the Shi^i and the Babi worlds.
In practice, Tahirih's action was complementary to this belief. On the one
hand she questioned and in many instances rejected the soundness of the ideas

> and practices of the 'past generations' in the matters of fiqh and furu, and
> on the other hand by emphasising the imminent advent of Qiyamat, she made a

food was unlawful .   This no doubt was a defensive response to the pressure on
the Babis who were now rejected as unbelievers. To purify the unlawful food
however, she would then order the Babis to bring to her all the food, so that by
her purifying sight she could make them suitable to use 2 . These little devices,
however trivial or indeed impractical, still show her as an astute and subtle
leader in maintaining the morale of the Babis in hostile surroundings.
But not all the 'infringements of the religious law' (kharq-i hudud) were
limited to the Babi's relations to their adversaries. Perhaps the most daring
and unconventional of her acts was her appearing unveiled in the gathering of
of her followers which by any standards was unacceptable, even to some of the
Babis in 'Atabat . Still more 'blasphemous' and 'heretical' to her opponents
were her hints that the compulsory obligations (takallf) should be lifted because
'the age of interval' (ayyam-i, fatrat) prior to the advent of the next
dispensation had started 4 .

She advocated these ideas at a time when every infringement of the
conventional rules of religion met with strongest resistance from the ^ulama.
Her courage is admirable, but what is perhaps more important are the ideas which
lay behind her action. Perhaps Tahirih should be regarded as the first Persian
woman in modern times who considered unveiling on her own initiative and as a
result of a genuine intellectual quest. Indeed, it is in this period that a
small circle of Babi women was formed around her, who under her guidance
appeared to have achieved a preliminary consciousness of the deprivations and
discriminations of women. For these women Tahirih exemplified a heroine of

intellectual and moral reforms. They were educated and enlightened women who
were all later distinguished for their Babi commitment. Khurshid Bagum entitled
Shams al-2uha (wife of Mirza Muhammad 'Ali Nahri) and Marziyih (Tahirih's sister)

*                   •                                  •
were both deeply influenced by her. Also known to us are Mulla Husain

al-Firdaus) , wife of Sayyid Kazim Rashti who was originally from Shiraz and
Tahirih's maid known as Qanitih .   In the later years in Qazvin, daughters of

Haji Asadallah Farhadi, Khatun Jan, Shirin and Sahibih also became her faithful

followers. As will be discussed later, it was Khatun Jan who assisted Tahirih
in her escape from Qazvin . On her return from QUabat in 1263 Tahirih also

attracted the attention of the wives of the local notables in Hamadan and
particularly impressed two women: Shahzadih Zubiydih Khanum known as Firishtih

the daughter of Fath 'Ali Shah and mother of Amir Muhammad Husain Khan Hisam al-

•                                *      *          C *
Mulk (the vali of Kurdistan) who was a poetess with the pen name Jahan , and
Hajiyih Khanum, wife of Mahmud Khan Nasir al-Mulk . The influence of Tahirih

may also be seen in another Babi poetess Shams Jahan, the daughter of Muhammad

Riza Mirza and granddaughter of Fath ^Ali Shah with the pen name Fitnih who in

her Masnawi
gave an account of her first acquaintance with Tahirih

when she was
imprisoned in the house of Mahmud Khan the kalantar of Tehran between 1266-8
(1850-2) 7 .
However it should be pointed out that what was advocated by Tahirih and the

women around her concerning the position of women was very different from the
'emancipation of women 1 in the western sense which appeared in Iran much later
after the constitutional revolution. The source of encouragement for Tahirih

and other Babi women to unveil was primarily a religious innovation rather than
the modern concept of 'women's rights'. It is likely that Tahirih

viewed the
deprivations of women in a purely religious context, and hence saw no other
solution than a change in religious norms. At least this is the impression
which one gets of the attitude and behaviour of Tahirih,  since there is no written

evidence which suggests that she was specifically preoccupied with the question
of women .

> Tahirih's attempt to unveil brought some reactions from inside the Babi

community.  In 1263 (1847) a group of Babis of (Atabat who disapproved of
Tahirih's activities wrote to the Bab and sought his opinion . No doubt the

manner in which Tahirih publicized her ideas as well as unreserved criticism of

her adversaries was also for those traditional Babi ^ulama such as Sayyid (Ali
Bushr Kazimayni who still tended to see the Babi movement within the Shaykhi

context. Furthermore as Shaykh Sultan Karbala'i reported, the false accusations

and allegations against Tahirih which were circulated in ^Atabat by Mulla Ahmad

Rashti and his allies were also effective in turning some of the Babis away from

her . In reply to these criticisms, the Bab publicly defended Qurrat al-
and her positions, and to show his disapproval of the allegations of immorality,
entitled her Tahirih
(pure). The Bab's response not only approved of Tahirih

in
person and her leadership over the Babis of ^Atabat, but significantly acknowledged
a liberal tendency in the movement even at the expense of losing some of the
fundamentalist followers 3 . When his reply was read to a gathering of seventy
Babis in Kazimayn, a number of followers who saw this as an open breach of the

Islamic code declined to accept the Bab's view and consequently left the Babi

ranks . Later, in a commentary on Sura al-Hamd which is probably addressed to

Bushr and his faction, again the Bab confirmed his approval of Tahirih while in

the meantime trying to convince the defecting followers by urging them to set
themselves free of these 'non-essential matters' (shu'unat al-^aradiya) . This
was an important development since perhaps for the first time the Bab openly
approved the ideas and actions of his most outspoken and controversial disciple.
The fact that the matter is referred to .he judgement of the Bab also illustrates
his significance as the core and the supreme authority in the movement.

With the exception of a few defecting members, the rest of the Babis in

> ^ularna was much deeper. Her ideas as a whole, her teaching sessions which were
attended by more than thirty Babis and her remarks on religious obligations were
enough to arouse the deepest suspicion of the ^ulama who had long been seeking

an opportunity to condemn her.   Such an opportunity came about in the beginning
of 1262 (1846) when in the first of Muharram of that year, Tahirih advised the

Babis to celebrate the anniversary of the birthday of the Bab in spite of the
annual mourning throughout this month for the Karbila' martyrs .    Contrary to
the custom of wearing black clothes in this month, she herself dressed in colour
and appeared at the feast again without wearing a veil.   This open disregard for
the Shi'i traditions, even though it was performed in the gathering of the Babis,
especially enraged the Shi' i ''ulama who seem to have been informed of the
occasion by Mulla Ahmad

Rashti and his allies. As can be understood from Shaykh
Sultan's account, it was the Shaykhi ^ulama who took the initiative of protesting

to the local governor of Karbila' and to incite the mob to attack Rashti T s house ,
To prevent any further disturbance the governor of the city interfered in the
dispute by putting Tahirih

under arrest in the Rashti T s house for a period of
about three months, pending her release by the decision of the Baghdad
authorities .
Apparently it is in this period that Tahirih, who seems not to have been

apprehensive of the recurrence of anti-Babi feelings, first invited the Shi ^i
mujtahids to an open debate and then, when none of the ^ulama accepted the
challenge, called upon them to stand with her for mubahala 4 . Naturally the

'ulama were not prepared to risk such an encounter and indeed perhaps this was
a manoeuvre on behalf of Tahirih to prove her innocence to the Ottoman

authorities as much as to the Shi^i public. According to some sources, at the
end of the third month, presumably since no order came from Baghdad, Tahirih,

who perhaps was exposed to further criticism and threat, persuaded the governor
to allow her to leave Karbila' and took up her quarters in the house of Shaykh
.      Shibl Baghdadi in Baghdad . No doubt the death of Sayyid Kazim's
widow, who was a follower and supporter of Tahirih at the beginning of 1262,

gave new reasons to Mulla Ahmad Rashti to press for his demand for the removal

of Tahirih and the return of the Diwan to his control . However, as Baghdadi

confirms 'she was sent to Baghdad by the order of the vail 1 who probably had
decided on this as a result of Shaykh Muhammad Shibl's intervention . This
precautionary measure temporarily defused tension and mob excitement in the H.oly
Cities since by the transfer of Tahirih, most of her followers also moved to
Baghdad.

But shortly afterwards in Baghdad, she again renewed her activities mostly
in response to the public which was curious to find out about the woman who was
advocating the advent of a new revelation. The rising fame of Tahirih in
Baghdad again faced Najib Pasha with the risk of provoking factional discontent
if he should leave Tahirih to continue her anti-''ulama preaching. So this time

instead of calling for a tribunal of Shi^i/Sunni ''ulama he simply summoned
and questioned her about her beliefs. The details of this interrogation
are not known, nor are the persons or officials who were present, but as far as
Samandar informs us, it appears that Najib, and possibly his aides, could not
find any evidence which could convince them of her heretical or non-Islamic

beliefs . Hence, perhaps it was for the purpose of further investigation by the
chief mufti that Najib ordered the transfer of Tahirih to the house of Shaykh

Alusi,  while in the meantime her case was referred to the Sublime Porte   .

The Pasha's milder response to the renewal of Babi activities may have resulted
from the fact that on the previous occasion, in the case of Bastami, no definite
result had been achieved from the trial except for the tacit victory of the
Ship's, who sagaciously caused the banishment of Bastami from ^Atabat. Perhaps
earlier instructions from Istanbul which warned him against any further factional
friction were also effective. On the other hand, it was unprecedented to put a
woman on trial particularly for a charge such that neither the evidence nor the
laws of apostacy, as it was applied to women, showed the prospect of any definite
verdict . Finally, if there was a trial, Tahirih's skilful tactics and her
oratory might have worked in her favour and provided her with an opportunity to
publicise her views even further .

For this speculation some ground may be found in the writings of Alusi,
who seems, in passing a verdict on Qurrat al- ^Ayn, to reserve his highest praise
for her:

The tone of Alusi in reference to Tahirih would imply that during her two month
stay in his house there was an occasion for a sincere dialogue between Tahirih

and the Sunni scholar.    Perhaps it is owing to this sympathetic dialogue that
some months later, the Bab sent him a 'tablet' in which he called upon him to

2                             ......
recognise his mission .   Apparently at the same time as Tahirih was in his house

a gathering was held in the same place which the Sunni 'ulama and muftis
attended. The details of such an assembly are not known 3 .

3\.   Only Samandar . (pp.348-9) reported of a certain Hakim Masih, an Arab Babi of
Jewish descent, who saw Qurrat al-^Ayn in Baghdad conversing with the Sunni
ulama.

Shortly afterwards the orders came from Istanbul for the deportation of
Tahirih.       Though the contents of the Forte's instruction are not known, yet
another passage from Alusi, this time from Ruh al-Ma^ari!,, gives some insight
into the situation which finally persuaded the Pasha to arrange for the banish­
ment of Tahirih and her followers:

> '... And thus appeared on that time (i.e. early 1260's)
> a group of Shi (i ghulat calling themselves Bablya ...
> All those who possess wisdom would testify to their
> blasphemous beliefs. A group of them would have remained

> consensus. He humiliated them, may God help him, and
> disturbed their assembly and became furious at them, may
> God be content with him, and disrupted their activities,
> may God repay him with his benevolence ...'•'•
These reproachful remarks sound contradictory to his above mentioned praise of
if one does not consider the mufti's apprehension of the potential threat
from the Babis for the removal of which he praised Najib Pasha so flatteringly.
The second passage is written in ci,Toa 1265-6 (1849-50) when the Babi uprisings
in Iran made it appropriate for Alusi to make explicit his resentment at the
resurgence of yet another Shi ^i extremism, whereas the first passage regarding
Qurrat al-*Ayn is written later (very probably in 1270 (1861-2)) before his
death and two years after the final defeat of the movement and the execution of
Tahirih when the diminishing anxieties of the Mufti allowed him to write a less
biased account.
As was rightly noticed by Alusi, the deportation of Tahirih was the end of

the effective presence of the Babis (or indeed the Shaykhis) in ^Atabat for the
next five years, before the arrival of Baha'allah and his party who were exiled

to Iraq towards the middle of 1269 (1853) . In the early months of 1263 (1847)
accompanied by an Ottoman officer, Tahirih was sent to Khanaqin on the Iranian

border. With her was travelling a body of about thirty of her followers. Her
journey from Baghdad to Qazvin took about three months in the course of which
she passed through Karand, Kirmanshah and Hamadan before reaching Qazvin towards

the middle of 1263 (1847).      All along the way she, together with her disciples
such as Mulla Ibrahim Mahallati, Mulla Salih Karimavi and Shaykh Sultan Karbala'i,

•        i     •   •                        •
publicly propagated the new cause . In numerous gatherings she entered into
discussions with the mujtahids, Sufis and notables informing them of the advent
of the Bab.  In spite of her disappointments in ^Atabat, she seems to have been
in high spirits throughout the journey and did not hesitate the violent
reactions    which not infrequently she and her followers were faced with in the
course of the journey.

Her arrival in Qazvin opened a new phase in her activities. The troubled
months of her stay in the city finally ended with the assassination of her uncle
Mulla Muhammad Taqi by the Babi elements and her subsequent escape from Qazvin
to Tehran towards the middle of 1264 (1848) 2 . Later, following the general call
upon the Babis to assemble in Khurasan, she left Tehran and attended the Badasht
conference where she played a major role in determining the future of the
movement. She indeed led the militant and uncompromising faction within the
movement which called for the full separation from Islam and the declaration of
a new revelation. Her struggle with Quddus, possibly over the leadership of the
movement, came to some settlement, but nevertheless its effect remained in the
course of the events for the next few years.

After Badasht, between the end of 1264 to the beginning of 1266 (1848-50),
she was in hiding in the Nur region in Mazandaran, virtually escaping from
village to village or hiding for about a year in a farmhouse on the outskirts
of the village of Vaz, before being arrested on charges of cooperation in the
assassination of her uncle, as well as her Babi associations 3 . She was brought
to Tehran in Rabi ^ al-Awwal 1266 (January 1850) to be imprisoned in the upper
room of the house of Mahmud Khan Kalantar for the rest of her life. In late
1268 (1852) after the attempt of the Babis on the life of the Shah, it was
eventually decided by the government that she should be executed. She was first
interrogated by two senior mujtahids of Tehran, Mulla Ou.i Kani and Mulla
Muhammad Andarmani and then at the end of Dhiqa^da 1268 (September 1852) was

taken to Bagh Ilkhani.      She was strangled and her body dumped in a shallow well

at the back of the garden .

Two major features may be identified in Tahirih's life, particularly with

regard to the episode of her stay in fAtabat: first, from the general point of
view, her life, ideas and works characterise her as an exceptional figure in pre-
modern Iranian history whose thoughts and actions were ahead of her time, yet
she is often misunderstood or misrepresented. She is the embodiment of what she
herself described in her poetry as 'enamoured with torment' (shiftih-yi bala') ;
a total commitment, with heart and mind, to an apocalpytic ordeal which she was
convinced to be the secret of man's historical existence. This was an approach
which can only make sense in a messianic setting where reason and inspiration
combine to anticipate the arrival of a changing era. Although one may partly
agree with Browne that Babi thought was essentially Shi fi in its Weltanschauung
and that the Babi history was a re-enactment of the idealised Shi fi past , yet
at the core of this fascination with suffering and martyrdom lay the seed of a
progressive dynamism of which Tahirih's   ideas were a good example. In her

intellectual development she benefited from two conflicting currents; the
orthodox rationalist Usulism   of her affluent family background, and the mystical

theosophy of Shaykhism with its popular potential. These themes, were employed,
though not fully approved of, to produce a hybrid of 'dialectical' messianism.

Secondly, this synthesis only appealed to a small section of the Shifi
intelligentsia who were already acquainted with the origins of this thought.

and the other Babi disciples alike, had little chance to popularise this
idea in such a way that it could appeal to the ordinary public. The period of
''Atabat proved to Tahirih and her followers that any attempt to advocate this

change in outlook on the academic or scholastic level were bound to fail either
because it would be isolated as a sectarian current and hence remain within a
small circle, while if there were any attempt to broaden the sphere of its
appeal, it would be suppressed by the religious and secular establishments who
by their nature, were opposed to any sign of change.

CHAPTER SIX
The Response of the ''uiama

The departure of the early   disciples of the Bab from Shiraz was finally
completed when Mulla Husain set   out for Isfahan sometime around 20th Jumada

- -             *       1                                            _
al-Thani 1260 (July 3rd 1844) .    As it has already been described, Bushruyihi's
journey inside Iran was carried  out according to the initial plans. This was a
prelude to the major campaign which was due to begin in Hijaz, and later reach
its climax in ^Atabat. His task primarily was to inform those Shaykhis of Iran
already acquainted with an impending Zuhur of the claims of Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad

•                                    .

the Bab, while at the same time preparing the public for the open declaration.
Further, the mission aimed to reveal the Bab's message in Qayyum al-Asmd* to
both the religious and secular authorities. It was for these aims that Mulla
left on his long journey to the central and eastern provinces 2 . But
contrary to Bastami's mission, which due to the fierce opposition it faced

•                                   o
failed to penetrate the Shi^i community in ''Atabat and could not achieve the
results hoped for even amongst the Shaykhis, Mulla Husain enjoyed the advantage
of a favourable environment and the sympathy of some Shaykhi circles. Further­
more, he benefited from the remarkable gift of impressing his audience and
winning them over with his oratorical skills. Without his efforts perhaps the
movement would never have had a broad impact on the society. For a better
understanding, it is necessary to examine different aspects of his mission and
try to set a pattern for the new believers, the method adopted and the reception
he received from the public.
The first signs of Mulla Husain f s progress appeared in Isfahan, when he
drew the attention of a number of Shaykhi 'ulama of various levels to the
appearance of the new Bab. He must have arrived in Isfahan in the last days of
Jumada al-Thani, and immediately started his task. Amongst those who were first
visited was Mulla Sadiq Khurasani. His conversion was the first in a series of
early conversions, which occurred because of Mulla Husain's personal influence,
and resulted in the formation of an active group who made a remarkable
contribution to the progress of the movement in the next few years. After

Isfahan, Mulla Husain headed towards Tehran in the second stage of his journey.
In the absence of further reliable sources, it is hard to establish dates for
his departure, or indeed for the whole of his journey from Shiraz to Khurasan.
However, by comparing the available evidence, it is possible to reckon that his
departure from Isfahan took place approximately in late Rajab 1260 (August 1844).
On his way Mulla Husain stopped in Kashan, where he was able to attract a

number of Shaykhi sympathisers and to call upon a celebrated mujtahid of the
city. He then proceeded towards Qum, where according to Nabil Zarandi, 'he
found the people utterly unprepared to heed his call 1 . This is perhaps due to
the absence of any Shaykhi connection in the town. The lack of support for any
unorthodox doctrine, including Shaykhism, does not seem unnatural for a city

A

which for centuries was regarded as the stronghold of the Shi^i orthodoxy . His
stay in Tehran resulted in a number of conversions amongst the ''ulama and some
state officials but he was also faced with the earliest criticism from the
Shaykhi camp. In spite of the opposition expressed in Tehran, he was able to
fulfil one of the major tasks of his mission, the delivery of the Surat al-Mulk
to Muhammad Shah and Haji Mirza Aqasi. However it looks as though Mulla Husain f s
activities in the capital were not as open as they had been in Isfahan and later
in Mashhad. At this stage, it appears that he had neither the intention nor the
capacity to face any threat from the fulama or state.
During this journey, Mulla Husain 1 s efforts were mainly focused on three

different groups of Shaykhi sympathisers: the ''ulama, tujjar and some government

officials.   In this chapter the position of the   ulama and their significance in
the later expansion of the Babi doctrine is discussed in some detail.

The efforts of Mulla Husain amongst the ''ulama of Isfahan resulted in the

early recognition of the Bab by two relatively important mujtahids: Mulla Sadiq

Khurasani (Muqaddas) and Mulla Muhammad Taqi Karat!.   Their entry into the Babi

circle no doubt added some weight and reputation to the new doctrine and in
addition, provided an opportunity for Mulla Husain to convey his message to a

greater number of the Shaykhis and non-Shaykhis in the city.
Mulla Sadiq, son of a humble mulla from Khurasan, was born and bred in
Mashhad , where he undertook his preliminary studies with a local mujtahid Haji

Sayyid Muhammad Qasir

•   Razavi . Probably it was during the course of these
lessons that he became acquainted with Mulla Husain who is known to have studied

3                      '                    -        - -
under the same teacher . Later, as he himself related to Shaykh Kazim Qazvini,

he received the status of imam-i Jama^at, presumably in one of the Mashhad's
mosques, a position usually conferred upon a pious and devoted member of the

religious corps . On his title of Muqaddas (holy, an epithet commonly used for
those thought to be specially ascetic), Samandar comments: 'from the early years
of his career, he was well known amongst the people as the essence of sacredness,
purity and piety, and therefore was known as Muqaddas' .
Mulla Sadiq then moved to ^Atabat to continue his studies, where like some

other Khurasani students he subsequently became a member of the Shaykhi circle

in Karbila .  Over the years he was gradually promoted to be one of the senior

2       .                     _
students of the circle , and finally received his ijazih (authorisation) in
RabiC al-Awwal 1259 Q. (April 1843), a few months before Rashtl's death. In

_   3          _
this ijazih , Sayyid Kazim expresses his views on his devoted student by calling

him 'my trustworthy brother' and praising him as 'an accomplished scholar' who
is 'superior amongst his peers because of his high understanding, his outstanding
insight, and his sharp intelligence, a possessor of both rational (rna^qul) and
traditional (jnanqul) sciences and holder of a high degree in furu ? (branches) and
usul (principles)'. Rashti then maintains:

> 'Since I have found him (i.e. Mulla Sadiq) possessor of these
> perfections and high standards, capable of bearing the traditions
> (Stftar) of the holy imams, peace be upon them so long as Heaven
> and Earth endure, I thus acknowledged his request with obedience,
> though I should confess to my own incapabilities and lack of
> worthy qualities in these fields and (maintain) that I wasted
> the essence of my life in vain, yet I seek God's guidance and
> by his name, authorise (him to issue) fatwa and therefore (to
> relate from me) whatever this humble servant has composed
> whether books, compiled works, treatises or replies to religious
> problems and whatever by God's will, may appear in future'^.

By certifying him both to issue fatva and relate traditions, Sayyid in fact
granted him what has been defined as -ijazih-'i ijtihad (authorization for
independent exertion of religious law), and ijazih-i ravayat (authorization for
relating traditions according to the teacher's chain      of mashayikh), yet it
seems that he avoids using the term -L.jti.had . Such an ijazih was an essential
tool for any capable talabih, whether Shaykhi or non-Shaykhi, to make his way
to a high status and to gain respect and authority. As Qisas al-^ulama puts it:

1\.   Ibid.     Also Nieolas. pp.191, 198.
2\.   Samandar. 163.
3\.   The facsimile of the original ijazih in Arabic appears in Z. 145 (supp.).

5\.   Q{.§as &l- fUlamaf (pp.9, 24) distinguishes between two types of ijazih. The

an i^azih from a mujtahid of a high calibre could serve two purposes; 'Not only
does it reassure the public in their taqlld and in their judicial problems (qaza)
but in addition a connection will occur in the chain of authorities on which the
traditions are based, and the person will enter the chain of the narrators
(ruvat )' .
Authorisation for ijtihad enabled Mulla Sadiq to claim an independent
authority in his judgements. This has great bearing on his later recognition of
the Bab since, being regarded as an authentic bearer of the teachings of Ahsa'I
and Rashti, he could approve of the Bab's claims as the genuine realisation of
past expectations - an approval which was essential for the general recognition
of the movement by the Shaykhi followers. It is not surprising that the Babi
sources, in spite of their general disapproval of the mujtahids, lay stress on
this point. The Babi poet Zabih Kashani particularly refers in his Masnawi to
this accomplishment 2 :

> 'He was a scholar (QzZ-WT?) and a mujtahid in every field,
> No mystic ever appeared as luminous as he,
> Not only was he accomplished in the path of the Shaykh (Alisa'i)
But he was also in love with the Lord'3.

Thus his newly acquired ijtihad, together with other characteristics, his
humble clerical background along with the piety and devotion attributed to him,
made Muqaddas an ideal example of the new generation of Shaykhi ^ulama, who in
the early days were attracted to the Babi movement. The esoteric tendencies of
the Shaykhi school inspired his messianic anticipations, whereas his early

f    - 4

acquaintance with the Bab, during the latter's pilgrimage to 'Atabat   , and his
reported admiration for the young merchant, had rendered possible the acknowledge­
ment of the new message. Like Mulla Husain, Bastami, and many other middle rank
mujtahids who turned to the Babi cause, he was perplexed over the future of the
Shaykhi school, but no doubt his loyalty to the internal grouping in the school
inclined him towards Mulla Husain. The trilateral oath of fraternity between
Muqaddas, Mulla Husain and Mulla Hasan Gauhar, which implied a desire for
unanimity in the choice of a spiritual leader upon the death of Sayyid Kazim,
should not be underestimated 5 .

By the time Mulla Husain met Muqaddas in Isfahan in Rajab 1260, he had
already visited Khurasan, and came from there to Isfahan by way of Yazd some
time in early 1260 . It seems that he enjoyed a high degree of popularity and
respect in Isfahan, since a Tabrizi merchant who was visiting Isfahan at the time
related that Mulla Sadiq f s popularity amongst the inhabitants was so great that

—         —       *                                                          7

as imam-i jima'at, about four thousand people followed him in the Friday prayer .
One can assume that, being a Shaykhi mujtahid, he received the bulk of this
support from Shaykhi sympathisers in the city, but probably the volume of this
popularity has been exaggerated.

Nearly all the relevant sources have given the account of his conversion as
a fine example of an ardent seeker who, guided by his visions, finally finds his
way towards the hidden truth. Yet at the same time, they indicate that his
previous knowledge of Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad assisted him in these visions through
which he discovered the identity of the Bab. Typical of these early conversions
was the manner in which the whole process of Khurasani's conversion was moulded
in a traditional form, adopting the mystical concept of kzshf, where the
mysterious truths behind the veil appear in their entirety. Modelled from

.       vision functioned as an instrument for trans-
mitting the hidden identity of the Bab, while Mulla Husain f s role, as the

possessor of the secret, was to inspire the seeker to grasp the hidden name
without passing the forbidden barriers 4 . Immediately after realising the
identity of the Bab, Mulla Sadiq decided to set out for Shiraz, where he could

personally meet the Bab and dispel his final uncertainties. Dressed as a humble
villager , it is reported that he travelled the distance between the two cities
on foot 6 .

Just before his departure, Aqa Faraj Tabrizi, who recognised him in Bazar-i
Isfahan, recalls in the following words:

> 'After greeting each other, I kissed his hand, and humbly asked:

The way Mulla Sadiq was trying to fulfil his 'individual duty' (far'z-i f

calls to mind the Shi^i traditions regarding the duty of the believer to support
the Mahdi's cause (Nusrat) ; 'And when you see him (i.e. Imam Mahdi), give him
your word of allegiance, even if it is necessary to make your way in the snow on
hands and feet, since he is God's deputy' 3 . This sense of suffering and
asceticism which repeatedly occurs in the course of the conversions is a sign of
Shi'i esoteric influence in shaping the formative period of the movement.
After some time, Mulla Sadiq arrived at Shiraz, in mid Rajab 1260 (July-
August 1844). Here as a result of his interview with the Bab, he finally over-
came his previous doubts and fully recognised the Bab's claims 4 . The point which
had puzzled Mulla Sadiq, like many other early believers, was that Sayyid Ali
Muhammad did not enjoy the 'nominal accomplishments' and 'official qualities' 5

of a high ranking divine, and even lacked the basic education necessary for any
Shi^i talabih.

Yet at the same time, this very factor worked in favour of the
Bab; 'The solid, firm verses and the nature of his knowledge ... revealed by the
young uneducated merchant 1 , could only be regarded as an infallible proof for
his rightfullness .

However, Mulla Sadiq*s journey to Shiraz was not solely for the purpose of

visiting the Bab, but for the greater task of advocating the cause in the Bab's
home town . Already prior to his departure from Shiraz, Mulla Husain had

_^ •
publicly declared that 'manifestation of the Proof of God (zuhur-i

> Ha'zrat-i

Eujjat) is close at hand' and by his appearance 'all these regulations and

customs which are in vogue amongst you will be abolished, and He will bring a
new book and tradition' . Yet Bushruyihi's reservation in revealing the identity
of the Promised One puzzled some of the enthusiastic audience. Mirza Ahmad
Shirazi, who himself was present at the time of Mulla Husain's departure,
objected that 'You have misguided and perplexed the people. You pretended that
the True One has appeared and that these regulations will be abandoned. Now you
are going, and neither has any True One appeared, nor has any sign of Him been
seen. The people will remain in doubt and astonishment' . In reply Mulla
Husain pointed out:

> 'I was not commissioned by the lawgiver (^dh/ib-i- sharZ'at) to do
> more than this. He sent me to give the warning, as an act of
> grace to the people, and to inform them that the appearance of
> the True One draws near, so that when the manifestation actually
> happens, they may not oppose it and perish. Whatever I was not
> ordered to state will be made known by the one named Mulla Sadiq,
> who will come two months after my departure'^.
It is clear that Mulla Husain, acting with the Bab's approval, had left

the critical task of proclamation in Shiraz to Muqaddas, who was to publicise
the new manifestation in conjunction with Bastami in "Atabat. After the meeting,
Mirza Ahmad asked Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad about his opinions of Mulla Husain 1 s

words, to which the Bab replied: 'Mulla Husain is an honest and truthful man,

and he is above making unfounded statements. Undoubtedly these words of his
have a foundation' .
Mulla Sadiq began preparation for the public declaration first by setting

up lectures and preachings in the mosque of Aqa Qasim but it appears that, for

Najafi Isfahan!

, the notorious enemy of the Babi-Baha'is, who had temporarily
moved from Isfahan to Mashhad (1877-8), put his seal of approval on the fatva
to strengthen his weakening position against the state authorities and perhaps
to enhance his nationwide reputation for executing Babis. Accused of being a
heretic, Mirza ^Abd al-Majid could have escaped execution if he had denied his
beliefs, but to the very last moment he insisted on them and regarded his death
as the only way to achieve f salvation 1 , and was therefore executed 2 .

Amongst the early conversions, though the contribution of members of the
'ulama and trade were predominant, the presence of a small group of low ranking
local officials also deserves some attention. During his first mission to
Khurasan, Mulla Husain when passing through Sabzivar, paid a brief visit to a
number of local mustaufis (revenue accountants), who had perhaps had some contact
with Shaykhis in the past. Later, two brothers, Mirza fAlI Riza MustaufI
Sabzivari, and then his brother Mirza Muhammad Riza (later Mu'taman al-Saltanih),
and some of their relatives became supporters of the Babi cause 3 . Though their
affiliation to the movement seems to some extent to have remained secret, never­
theless their moral and material support first included funds for the

-       — inarch4

Mazandaran         , and in the following years provided some comfort for the
Babis at times of persecution and trouble . Towards the 1870 f s (1290's), both
brothers were promoted in their offices. While Mirza 'Ali Riza became one of

his brother occupied the office of vizarat-i Khurasan (chief revenue accountant
of Khurasan) . Hence, since Nasir al-Din Shah was highly suspicious of Mu'taman
al-Saltanih

f s Babi sentiments, he ordered his transfer to the city of Kashan
where he was virtually in exile. Later, in a well-thought-out plan to eliminate
Mu'taman al-Saltanih, the Shah summoned him to the capital, and he was first
obliged to marry the Shah's sister, and then forced to drink 'poisonous coffee'
(qahvih-yi Qajar) from his wife's hand (1310 Q./1892-3) 2 .
Mirza Muhammad Taqi Juvayni Sabzivari, another Babi figure, came from
amongst the Sabzivari officials. Though he was a humble scribe and accountant

f\

(dabvr va avarihnigar) , in his Babi career he showed himself to be a courageous
and faithful Babi fighter. He was born in the village of Juvayn and encountered
Mulla Husain

on one of his visits to the town. Juvayni's effective participation
began when, in 1264 (1848), in the course of the Tabarsi upheaval he held the

•             i
responsibility for receipts and expenditure of the common funds , and on a few
occasions acted as the representative of the Babi party in negotiations with the
local chiefs and state officials . His most dramatic act, which could be seen
as a final declaration of war against the government, was the slaying of Khusrau
Khan Qadikala'i* in the forests around Barfurush, as a reprisal for his deceit­
ful behaviour towards the defenceless and confused Babi column . In the final
surrender of the Babi fighters, Mirza Muhammad Taqi was captured and put to
death by the Qajar troops. His head was spiked on the top of a spear and carried
around the city of Barfurush .

The study of the above indi/iduals may serve as examples for other non-
clerical members of the early Babi circle in Khurasan. As in the case of the
^ulama who were committed to the new doctrine, previous affiliations and

connections were the chief elements for the attraction of the local merchants
and state officials to the movement.     However, the degree of their participation
and the nature of their involvement in the movement also seem to be partly
determined by their occupation and rank.     Both groups represented an urban
provincial 'middle class* which began to form in the middle decades of the 19th
century.   But any attempt to establish a definite link between the conversion of
these groups and their socio-political background, beyond the intermediary
element of messianic expectations, could not go further than general speculation.
In fact, the millenarian ideas are the strongest unifying factor in bringing
individuals from different ranks and positions to acceptance of the Babi
doctrine.

The appeal of the message was mainly due to the fact that the new movement,
in contrast to existing religious or secular currents, was able to channel
common aspirations towards a tangible goal, particularly at times when Khurasani
society, which traditionally looked to the ^ulama for protection and security,
seems to have been less satisfied with the performance of the orthodox fulama.
In these circumstances the appeal of a messianic movement was not something
unpredictable, exceptionally when the power of the clergy was exhausted by
private conflicts and petty revenges within the framework of city politics.
Up to a point this was always a frequent characteristic of urban and religious
life in Iran, but the structure and ethos of religious life in Mashhad during
this decade has suggested grounds for an unusual degree of fragmentation and
loss of control.

As regards the ultimate plans and goals of the movement, the formation of
the Khurasan group may be counted as one of the major achievements of the early
years. Its role, in theory and in practice, in the course of the general
development of the movement and in particular during the events of which Tabarsi
was the climax, was highly significant. At a time when Mulla Ali Bastami and
other Babi Letters were entangled in increasing obstacles in 'Atabat, in spite
of their early success, and the Bab himself was disillusioned by his reception
in the Hijaz, Mulla Husain, by contrast, was able to organise a community which
played an important role in the progress of the movement.

CHAPTER NINE

Pilgrimage to Mecca

In an earlier chapter, the theological justification for announcing the
Babi message in Mecca and then in Kufah was discussed, and the symbolic impli­
cations of such a declaration were examined . After the departure of the early
disciples to their assignment, the Bab himself, 'according to the previous

2    .                                                         _
arrangements' , which he made with his followers, decided to set out for Hijaz,
where in the course of Hajj he intended to proclaim his mission. This was an

attempt to fulfil those Shi/i traditions which emphatically required the open
declaration of the Qa'im in front of the Ka^ba, prior to the final uprising
(Khuruj) in the land of Kufah.

Reasserting the inevitable fulfilment of the prophecies, the Bab himself
underlines the significance of the Mecca declaration in the following words:

> 'Thus on-that month (Ptili al-ffijja)whatever is promised by
> your God to every young and old, will happen. Soon he
> will appear in the Holy Land with the word that will
> "split asunder" whatever is in the heavens and earth.
> Behold his word; the righteous Qa'im (Qa'-im—i b-i, dl-haqq)
> who is the just Qa'im (Qo*im-i, hi al-qist) will arise in
> Mecca according to what has been uttered: "When the Qa'im
> appears, give him your support together with all those
> who will come to his assistance from distant corners".
> When they (his opponents) "have corrupted the earth",
> then he will commence the new cause in the hinterland
> of Kufah'3.

In the Bab's mind, the fulfilment of these prophecies was attributed to a divine
force beyond his control, which first assigned him to this mission to 'set out
for pilgrimage to Baytallah al-Haram 1 and promoted the cause 'to reach the East

and the West and in between' and 'expanded the (intellectual) capacity of the
people' to enable them to grasp 'the cause of the heart (hukm—i fu'ad) 1 , before
'returning him from Baytallah al-Haram to his homeland' .       This is what the Bab

was convinced to be an irreversible course, with all its details destined to happen
as was predicted.

To the above considerations for Hajj, one should also add some more tangible
facts which accelerated the departure of Sayyid ''All Muhammad from Shiraz in 26th
Sha^ban 1260 (10th September 1844) . Various indications make it possible to
assume that some considerations of a personal nature and particularly in relation
to his safety, influenced his decision to leave Shiraz in some haste. In a
letter to Mulla ^Abd al-Khaliq Yazdi, which is written in an invocatory style,
the Bab makes a brief but important reference to the situation in which he left
Shiraz:

> f O my God, you know my cause, and witness my inner
> intentions, and that I did not undertake this cause
> but to promote your pure religion (dZn—i khalis) and
> your hidden message. I had warned those who know me
> not to reveal my name. But I set out for pilgrimage
> to your house when I became terrified of the accomplices
> of the devil who were the corrupt people'2.

The same anxiety over the publication of his identity is also expressed in
another letter to Shaykh r Ali Qa'ini, son of Mulla r Abd al-Khaliq, in which the
Bab complains bitterly of the carelessness of some of his followers: 'When I
left this city (Shiraz) for the destination of Baytallah al-Haram, if after my
departure no one had divulged my name, no one would have been tormented. But
my believers are responsible towards God. Now there happened what ought to
happen' 3 .

> departure and arrival dates as well as the length of his stay in various
> places throughout his journey to the Hijaz. This Khutba is used in this
> chapter as the most reliable source for setting dates'.

> In one place (p.67) the Bab sends his regards to Shaykh ^Ali's father,

> and son, which contain similar remarks on the same issue, indicate a
> possible enquiry or even criticism from 'Abd al-Khaliq's quarter over the
Bab's change of policy (see below).

These complaints over the disclosure of his identity, even before his
departure, are the first signs of the Bab's displeasure with the activities of
some of his followers. He feared, perhaps with some justification, that the
untimely exposure of what should have remained a closely guarded secret, brought

.                                                              ( —
with it unnecessary harassment and persecution. As early as Sha ban 1260,
traces of a rift can be identified in the Babi ranks, which in the next few years
turned to a major crisis within the movement. At this stage, it is not possible
to identify any individual or group responsible for this embarrassing disclosure.
However, as far as the two prominent disciples were concerned, the statement
made by Mulla Husain  at the time of his departure from Shiraz , as well as the

reluctance shown by Mulla ' Ali Bastami to reveal the name of the promised Bab

_ n                       .

in ' Atabat , indicates that to a large extent they observed the secrecy agreed
upon 3 .

What seems to be the source of the Bab's apprehension was the fact that in
the disturbed conditions of Shiraz, the widespread rumours, which stimulated
peoples' curiosity to learn about the new claimant, could create harmful
agitation and trouble. Haji Mirza Muhammad Taqi Vakil al-Haqq,     the Bab's
maternal cousin, who at the time was residing in the city, recollects that 'in
the year 1260 in Shiraz, a rumour broke out that a noble sayyid claimed to be
the deputy (no3 ib) of the Qa'im, but his sacred name was not mentioned' . In
the course of one of his visits to the Bab in the month of Sha ban, about a week
before his departure, Muhammad Taqi saw the Bab sitting on the terrace of his
house and writing prayers and verses. When Vakil al-Haqq     enquired about the

•                _ _^

rumours that the new Deputy of the Imam prohibited the smoking of qal'iyan, the
Bab confirmed it without any further comments . As in his reply to Haji       Ahmad

Ishik Aqasi, here the  Bab preserves a   non-committal position on the enquiry
about the new revelation .

This unwanted publicity and its effect on the Bab's decision are also
reported by Mirza Kazem-Beg, who on the basis of an unspecified source, maintains
that:

Fears of the 'devil's accomplices' and 'the corrupt people' in the 'fertile
ground of prejudice and superstition' can only be fully appreciated if the
matter is examined in the context of the -general developments which at the time
were taking place in Shiraz. A brief look at the disturbed state of Fars
province reveals the nature of the threat which compelled the Bab to leave
Shiraz in secret, the same threat which was to endanger him when he returned
from Hajj .

A series of riots and public disturbances in the towns and villages of
Fars, which had already started earlier in the year, reached their climax in the
month of Sha^ban (August-September 1844) when the inner city clashes and open
rebellion against an exceptionally ineffective and unpopular government brought
the province to total anarchy and chaos. This is illustrated in various reports
by Colonel Sheil and his agent in Shiraz throughout 1844-5, in which the
typical course of an urban uprising, and its natural outcome of violence and
insecurity, can be observed 2 . With regard to the protests and agitations which
followed the appointment of Mirza Nabi Khan Mazandarani to the governorship of
Fars, in early August 1844 (Rajab 1260) Sheil reports: "The province of Fars

still remains in the same disturbed state. Mirza Nabee TChan the Governor,
being perfectly destitute of authority and unable to levy the revenue' . The
new governor, whose only reason for being appointed was his ability to offer
the highest bid for the office, not only lacked a basic support in the capital

2                                               T —
but also in the province . In fact from the early days of his office, Mirza
Nabi was faced with fierce opposition from the local notables, who for a variety
of reasons, did not approve of his appointment.

In order to express even further their disapproval of Mirza Nabi and his
repressive measures for collecting excessive taxes, a delegation of local
notables arrived in Tehran to press for his removal. The delegation from Shiraz
represented all five Haydari quarters in the city, as well as the leaders of the

Ni^mati quarters and thus provided a relatively united front . The pattern of
the opposition, and the channels through which the involved parties organised
and expressed their protest, indicate that the current conflict not only
included the influential notables at a high level, but also embraced large
groups of the inhabitants at lower levels.
The deep rooted Haydari-Ni^mati division in most Iranian cities in the 19th
century, according to Persian sources, goes back to the late 15th century.
Though such a division does not represent any ideological or even social
difference between the two parties, it should still be regarded as a major
feature in the pattern of city politics, especially at times of disturbance and
turmoil. These divisions provide an insight into the origin of many urban
conflicts, and the way such conflicts developed in the course of a local power
struggle. As it was strictly based on divisions of city quarters, the
inhabitants of each quarter had an almost compulsory affiliation to one of the
two factions. Though the Kadkhudas were officially in charge of the quarter,
it appears that during crises and civil strife, groups of lutis and their
patrons were the real force in action. In one of his reports Sheil states:
'In all the principal towns of Persia, the inhabitants are divided into two
parties, the Hyderees and the Ne^metees, who engage in contests which are
usually periodical and insignificant, but which increase in fierceness and

Indeed the composition of the delegation to Tehran illustrates the strength
of the two divisions in the city which in the previous ten years of Muhammad

Shah's reign had successfully brought down successive provincial governments,
and made the province of Fars virtually ungovernable. Haji    Mirza Muhammad Khan

as important as Qavam. These three together with three other notables of the
remaining Haydari  quarters (Haydari  Khanih) as well as with the tacit cooperation

with the chief of Ni fmati Khanih were able to exert the same pressure which had
caused the fall of Manuchihr Khan Mu r tamid al-Daulih in 1252 (1836-7), Firaydun
Mirza in 1256 (1840-1) and Farhad Mirza in 1258 (1842-3) from the governorship
of Fars .

Various motives encouraged the local leaders to take up an independent
stand towards the central government. At times they emerged as natural leaders
of the public, and their challenge enjoyed the strong support of the inhabitants,
who themselves suffered from the maltreatment of the government agents. To a
powerful figure like Qavam al-Mulk who combined landownership with effective
control over the city's affairs, the establishment of a stable government meant

less control over the administration of the city, as well as a loss of revenue
in town and countryside. Equally, for his powerful ally Muhammad Khan Ilbaygi
Qashqa'i, the establishment of a strong provincial government which could control
the countryside meant restrictions on the activities of the tribe as well as
payment of the due taxes.

The traditional alliance which existed between biglarbaygi, kadkhudabashis
and kadkhudas on the one hand, and various elements with tribal or urban origin
such as Ilbaygi, prominent ulama and members of the city brigandage on the
other, created an impenetrable urban network which could hardly be disunited by
any outside force. While Qavam al-Mulk and his officers practically controlled
the city quarters, Ilbaygi guaranteed the balancing force which was necessary to
check the threat of the government troops, and turbulent lutis ensured the
violence and disorder which were necessary for creating embarrassment for the
government. Towards the 1250's and 60's different scenes of an orchestrated
resistance can be seen, in which the lutis of the rival quarters, usually under
the influence of rival figures, played a major role in the development of events 1 .
In mid-August 1844, Mirza Nabi attempted to publish the farmccn for commercial
regulations regarding the recovery of debts due to English merchants, by reading
it in the principal mosque; 'the rabble and disaffected persons in Sheeraz
assembled round, and would allow no one to approach the mosque. Their
supposition was probably that the Ferman contained an order to replace Mirza
Nabee Khan in Government 1 2 .
It is hard to establish to what extent the violence of the lutis voiced
people's grievances against the government, but no doubt at times of social and
political turmoil they created a major problem for the security of the quarters
and the safety of the inhabitants. It seems that even the truce, or the nominal
understanding, which was reached at a higher level between the representatives
of quarters,

quarter , who according to the customary divisions of the quarters, lost no
opportunity to settle old feuds. The eye witness account of the Shiraz agent
of the British mission in Tehran provides a vivid picture of the hostilities in
the city:

After referring to various disturbances which simultaneously occurred in
other towns and villages of Fars, and also the dispute which broke out between
the Simnani and Hamadani troops over their lodging in the city, the report gives
an example of the damage and casualties which the inhabitants of Shiraz on one
occasion suffered from gang-warfare:

Giving some figures for the recent fighting, the report counts at least 8 dead
and 132 injured in various incidents in Shiraz and 56 dead in other parts 3 .
Finally, appealing to the British representative to intervene, the agent states:

Thus, in the,absence of an effective governmental or civilian authority
for the enforcement of law and order, and as the direct outcome of the resistance
shown by the local forces towards the central government, an ideal condition
prevailed for the mob to assume control of the quarters and stage a full scale
war, which caused great danger and suffering for the ordinary inhabitants. The
local notables who were probably the real instigators of these factional dis-

orders, certainly had a limited ability to maintain peace and order .

Under such circumstances, the publication of a highly sensitive issue such
as the mission preached by the Bab would naturally have added a new dimension
to the existing situation. Here the Bab was faced with two options: either he
could have proclaimed his mission in the hope of attracting the attention of the
curious public, or else in spite of a growing interest towards his claims,
leave the city and commence his pilgrimage to the Hajj.   In choosing the first

option, the absence of a powerful provincial government and the existing turmoil
might have given him the chance to recruit freely without serious fear of the
llama's reaction, since they lacked the official backing of the government.
But such publication would inevitably have meant involvement in city politics
and taking sides in the Haydari-Ni''mati divisions, since in the event of any

strong action from the opposing ''ulama which could have been implemented by
provocation and incitement of the mob, he would have had to rely upon the
opposite faction for security and protection. But such protection could not have
materialised without the Bab leaning towards the leaders of these divisions and
ultimately being manipulated by certain notables in the city to fulfil ambitions
beyond his original claims and intentions.

Thus as soon as the Bab felt that the disclosure of his identity might lead
to further trouble, he chose to leave Shiraz in haste since he had no intention
of facing the dangers of an unpredictable situation. He belonged to the merchant
class which, because of its functions, always held a neutral position in local

entourage of Mulla Husain's abilities in theological arguments . Thus, it seems

that he was hesitant to take part in an argument, which would lead him into
unnecessary conflict with an obscure group.

Following Sayyid Asadallah's reservations, it appears that the Babi
opposition also failed to gain Karbasi's cooperation in this matter. The
cautious mujtahid went only so far as to promise that if he recovered from his

illness, he would 'investigate the matter himself and 'ascertain the truth' .
Karbasi, who had for years avoided major participation in the frequent power

struggles or political rivalries in the city, was not prepared to risk his
reputation as a just and impartial authority by passing a verdict on an ambiguous
accusation against a Shaykhi disciple. During his long and intimate friendship
with Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shafti , they had come to an implicit agreement, that
as a matter of principle, Karbasi should leave all judicial and legal decisions

to his powerful colleague, and confine himself wholly to his academic
activities .   Karbasi was reluctant to take part, even in minor practices such
as collecting and distributing religious dues, or if he ever did he was
meticulously   anxious to observe all religious details .   It is quite incon­
ceivable that a mujtahid who, according to Qisas al-^UlcanaJ6 gave alms to a beggar

" *
only after calling upon witnesses to testify to his poverty , should have passed
a fatva of condemnation on a person with whom he shared a certain sympathy, even
if he did not, as Nabil claims, praise his faculties .

Yet it appears that the extent of the hostility was wide enough to reach the
court of Manuchihr Khan Mu^tamid al-Daulih, the powerful governor of the province
But he in turn, according to Nabil Zarandi, 'refused to interfere' in a matter
which 'fell extensively within the jurisdiction of the fulama' .   The author of

Nasikh al-Tawarikh, however, goes as far as to state that the governor even
defended the new cause; 'He acknowledged that the Bab is a pious man and main­
tained that it could be that he (the Bab) is the deputy (na'i'b) of the Hidden
Imam 1 . In fact the successful policy adopted by the governor in the last five
years, which had to some extent subordinated the important religious figures to
the authority of the state, dictated non-commitment in these circumstances on
behalf of the governor in a matter which was primarily religious. Considering
the long history of urban disturbances and riots in the city, it is more likely
that the governor only warned the intriguers 'to abstain from mischief and to
cease disturbing the peace and tranquility 1 2 .

The failure of the opposition in gaining active support from the authori­
ties, perhaps indicates that the time was still not ready for the religious
leadership to wage a war against the Babi elements. The full weight of Babi
teachings had not yet been felt in religious circles, and the religious leaders
did not see the movement as a real threat to their position in society. Indeed
the result of the unsuccessful attempt to ban Babi teaching, was that the small
Babi group managed to benefit from the opportunity, and act more freely and openly
in its teachings. The relatively mild policy adopted by the religious and
secular powers, provided the ideal atmosphere for the arrival of the Bab in 1262.
During the next two years, the internal conflict between the religious factions,
particularly encouraged the provincial government to search for a new alternative.
However, in spite of some claims made by the biased authors, it is highly
unrealistic to assume that Mu'tamid al-Daulih, however gifted he might have been
in formulating his policies, regarded the Babi movement at this stage as a strong
or organised force which could be employed against the religious authorities in

O

Isfahan . But, in addition to the natural resistance of the ^ulama to the
distribution of an unorthodox message, there were, no doubt, other motives behind
their attempt to condemn the new movement. With regard to the earlier contentions
between the adherents of Sayyid Muhammad

Baqir Shafti and the supporters of ' Imam
Jum^ih, it is possible to suggest that the same factions were also active in this
instance. Though there is no clear evidence to suggest any association between

Mulla Husain with either Imam Jum^ih or Mu^tamid al-Daulih, certain links can

be traced through Harati or Nahris.
Mir Sayyid Muhammad Khatunabadi, who held the office of imam jum^ih of

Isfahan between 1254-91 (1838-74) by right of an inheritance going back to Mulla
Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, exercised a considerable influence on affairs of the city ,

His wealth and property, his family connections, and his function as the inter­
mediary between the 'ulama and the government enabled him to enjoy the privileges
of a respected mujtahid, a high ranking state official and a powerful landlord.
Though in theory he voiced the government's religious attitude, in practice he
exercised a large degree of independence, which could only be matched by powerful
mujtahids such as Shafti, Karbasi, Muhammad Taqi Najafi, or equally powerful

governors such as Mu^tamid al-Daulih and later Zill al-Sultan. By 1262 (1846)

the death of the two leading mujtahids of Isfahan, namely Shafti and Karbasi,
had given him the opportunity to rise to a higher position above the others,
mostly at the expense of the rival faction who, due to internal discord, lacked
an effective leadership. His amicable relations with Mu^tamid al-Daulih more
than anything had originated in their mutual desire to tighten their control over
the city.

When in Rajab 1262 (July 1846) the Bab finally managed to escape the
persecution, harassment and arrest which for the past two years he and his close
followers had suffered in Shiraz, it was with the assurance of Mu'tamid and ther\

blessings of Imam Jum/ih, conveyed by the believers, that he entered Isfahan .
What persuaded the Bab to seek refuge in Isfahan was the encouragement which he
apparently received from a number of Isfahani believers concerning Mu^tamid's
enthusiasm and sympathy towards the new call. As it is hinted, one might even
assume that Harati was behind the dignified reception of the Bab and also his

Q

residence in the house of Imam Jum/ih himself .

Manuchihr Khan's enthusiasm and interest for religious discourses no doubt
played a major part in his personal attraction towards a messianic character like
the Bab.    This was an interest which, even if rooted in his own complex religious

history, still had some relevance to his ambition for temporal power . Imam
Jumfih however, in his overall assessment of the Bab, seems to be more sceptical.
Beside his curiosity, which appears to be further aroused by Harati, perhaps it
was the instruction of the governor which obliged him to play host to the Bab.
But whatever the motives, the presence of the Bab first worked to their advantage.
Because of his personal charm, his extraordinary claims and his'miraculous deedsi
news of which was spread by his close disciples in the city, the Bab gained a
considerable popularity in Isfahan. This caused some apprehension amongst those
<ulama who had already been alarmed by the earlier activites of Mulla Husain and
other believers. The warnings of the ^ulama of Shiraz concerning the threat of

the new heresy , and the dispatches of Haji Mirza Aqasi from Tehran 3 , who for his

own reasons concerning the dangerous outcomes of an alliance between the Babis and
his old rival Muftamid al-Daulih, urged them to take action against the new
claimant, encouraged some of the 'ulama such as Mulla Muhammad Mahdl Karbasi, son
of Haji Ibrahim, Mulla Husain 'Ali Tusirkani and Mirza Hasan Mudarris, to denounce

•                    >                               .

from the pulpit the open Babi activities in the city and the official backing given
to them by the governor and Imam Jumfih .

In response, Mu 'tamid was obliged to take some action in order to silence
the opposition. By inviting the 'ulama to a public meeting for the purpose of
interviewing the Bab, Mu^tamid hoped to put the ''ulama in an irreversible
position, since he reckoned that challenging a young merchant by means of
scholastic reasoning and logic would be to raise his position in the eyes of the
public. Precisely for the same reason contemplated by Mu'tamid, an important
group of ''ulama led by Sayyid Isadallah Shafti and Mulla Muhammad Ja far Abadih'i
turned down the invitation and abstained from the meeting . Others however
headed by Mulla Muhammad Mahdi Karbasi and Mulla Muhammad Hasan Nuri, son of

in the teaching circles of Isfahan.    In both cases the theological and philo­
sophical questions which were posed by the mujtahids with almost total disregard
for the claims of the Bab and his intuitive justifications for such claims,
demonstrate   the intellectual gap which separated the mujtahids from the Bab,
and prevented any constructive dialogue .

If the gathering did not lead to any concrete result, the 'ulama still had
at their disposal the effective weapon of takfir, which they duly used to prevent
the further expansion of the movement. When a large number of the ^ulama of
Isfahan, according to one estimate more than seventy of them   , signed a fatva to
condemn the Bab, and even demand his execution on the grounds of blasphemy, Imam
Jum'ih, who was already through his cousin Sayyid Abul Qasim the Imam. Jum^ih of
Tehran,      under pressure from Haj i Mirza Aqasi's quarter,     decided to

withdraw his support for the Bab by issuing a half-hearted fatva in which he
testified to the Bab's true belief and piety, while at the same time stating that

he is 'devoid of reason and judgement' .

Hence, after forty days of open preaching of the Babi message fron the house
of Imam Jum'ih, the Bab again came under strong attack. In turn Mu^tamid was
forced to retreat, and offered the Bab a secret dwelling in ^Imarat-i Khurshid
in his private quarters.   The Bab, perhaps out of desperation, promptly accepted.
For the next few- months, till the end of Mu^tamid's life (circa Rabi

1263 Q. : March 1847) , the Bab remained in hiding in Isfahan, without any further
contact with the Isfahani public. Though there were some moves by the Babis of
Isfahan to show their discontent, the Bab himself, as on many other occasions,
declined to recommend any violent action. Whether because of the Bab's own
peaceful character or the pressure which might have been put upon them by
Mu^tamid, the Babi community of Isfahan failed to excite a mass reaction.

The Babi activities between 1260-3 (1844-7) occurred at a time when Isfahan,
after a period of clerical domination, both in the religious and the political
sense during the first four decades of the 19th century, entered a phase of
religious decline, from which the city never fully recovered. The Babi doctrine
then was a message for those groups who no longer felt the full domination of the
powerful mujtahids and thus tended towards less conventional schools of thought

with messianic tendencies, first Shaykhism and then the Babi movement.               But the
extent of these messianic expectations was not big enough to overcome the
mujtahids' influence.   On the contrary, the new generation of mujtahids, who
mostly occupied their fathers' positions and benefited from the remnants of their
wealth and influence were, in spite of their internal differences, able to divert
the public attention from the Babis, and, in a concerted action, isolate them in
Isfahan.   As in Shiraz in 1261-2 and Tabriz in 1264,                  in Isfahan   the
encounter between the Bab and the high ranking mujtahids showed the insurmountable
difference between the two conflicting attitudes.

IV

Throughout his journey to Kashan and Tehran in 1260, Mulla Husain again
experienced the antagonism of some important mujtahids to the publication of the
Babi ideas. Their disapproval was mostly expressed in the form of mild
condemnation, or personal refusal to comply with tendencies which might result
in heresy. Mulla Husain 1 s visit to Naraqi in Kashan illustrates the nature of

these early encounters.
Mulla Muhammad Naraqi Hujjat al-Islam, son of Mulla Ahmad, son of Mulla

Muhammad Mahdi, was brought up in a traditional 'ulama family. Like Asadallah

Shafti, and many others, Mulla Muhammad also belonged to a generation of mujtahids

who, more than anything, owed their positions to their celebrated fathers. Family
connections, inherited wealth and influence, combined to provide them with
sufficient means to establish their authority and maintain their place in the
community. Naraqi received his ijazih from his father Mulla Ahmad , who is

known for his contribution in fiqh as well as in philosophy and h ikmat in the
19th century Shi'i circles . Further, he was the son-in-law of the chief mujtahid
of Qum, Mirza-yi Qumi . His family, which was originally from the village of
Naraq near Kashan       first moved to the city in the 1770' s .       The Naraqis greatly
prospered under the Qajars, due to their policy of supporting some local fu
in large cities. Being the rqutavaUi. of Madrasih-i Sultani which was built by

Fath 'Ali Shah with the trusteeship of its endowments bestowed indefinitely upon

his family , Mulla Muhammad enjoyed good relations with the local and central
government . His local influence, as well as his relations with the Qajars, put
him in a position to exercise an undisputed judicial authority in the city. It
appears that these qualities, rather than his scholarly abilities which were

— _         _ o
limited to a number of works on fiqh, usul and kalam , encouraged the author of

Nasikh al-Tawzrikh to praise him, rather flatteringly, as 'today's most superior
scholar in Iran both in knowledge and practice' .
When Mulla Husain encountered Naraqi, the sharp difference between a well

established mujtahid and a millenarian preacher was represented by the divergence
of opinion over the question of the Imam's emergence.       Yet beneath the theor
logical discrepancy runs a wide gap between the social standing of the two men,
both in terms of their past background and future goals. When Mulla Husain

-        -       — -                 - -5

presented copies of Qayyum al-Asma1 and Ziyarat NanrCh to Naraqi , the scrupulous
mujtahid lost no time in pointing out the grammatical faults throughout the
text.     In reply Mulla Husain, who himself seemed to be aware of the grammatical

violations in the Bab's writings, quotes the Bab with a poetical and indeed
symbolic remark, which was totally foreign to the rational framework of an
orthodox scholar like Mulla Muhammad; 'Up to now the nahv (i.e. ^tlm-i nahv:

grammar, esp. syntax) due to a sin once committed, was enchained and incarcerated.
Now I have mediated for its sin, and set it free from its chains and bonds.
Therefore it is excusable if (people) pronounce an accusative (mansub) instead

—                     *       f\
of a nominative (marfu^), or a genitive (jnajrur') instead of an accusative* .

Taking no notice of the metaphor borrowed by the Bab to show his disgust
with the rules and regulations which so much occupied the minds of scholars,
Mulla Muhammad sharply criticised the Bab by stating that 'it is an erroneous
task for Persians to present 'Arabic compositions as proofs for their claims' 7 .
It is interesting that this objection came fron a man whose father and teacher

Mulla Ahmad once composed the famous line f l wonder why a madrasih should be
built in the place where a tavern could be founded 1 . Following his father ! s
practice, Mulla Muhammad who himself was a poet of some talent compiled a

»   •
this instance he.seems to avoid 'confusing arguments' by drawing on another body
of evidence (khilt-i Mabhas) which might have given some weight to Mulla Husain's
remark.

As far as the contents of the Bab's writing were concerned, as Nasikh
al-TawarZkh describes, Naraqi was more interested in rejecting the legitimacy of
the Bab's claim than in paying attention to the actual message embedded in the
Suva al-fularna* of Qayyum al-Asma* which was emphatically addressed to the
Culama. As an example of scholastic responses , Naraqi argues that 'in order
to prove a claim beyond the boundary of our principles (qanun) , one must produce
a clear justification. With these absurd deceptions and futile nonsense verses
it is impossible to arrive at a realistic conclusion' 3 . Thus nothing positive
came out of a meeting which was bound to be disrupted by the mujtahid's outraged
cries of disapproval. As Sipihr rightly points out, 'since the Bab's call did
not go beyond the state of niyabat-i Babiyat' , Mulla Muhammad preferred not to
go further in his condemnation.

In spite of Naraqi's denial, others from the ranks of the clergy were
attracted to Mulla Husain. Haji Mir 'Abd-al-Baqi Kashani, the imam-i jima at

^Atabat under Sayyid Kazim Rashti , and also a friend of Haji Mirza Jani ,
showed some interest, but felt 'unable to sacrifice rank and leadership for the

Q
message which his friend brought him' . His sceptical inclination towards the
movement, apparently did not lead him to any firm recognition even after

visiting the Bab in Kashan in 1263 . According to Nabil Zarandi, after the
departure of the Bab, ^Abd al-Baqi renounced society and led a life of unrelieved
seclusion . However the authors of Tarikh-i Amri-yi Kashan and Tarikh-i Jadid
believe that he fully recognised the Bab's revelation . The significance of

community in the city , Abd al-Baqi, who was also qualified with an ijazih

~~         —2

from Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shafti , was himself a respected mujtahid and the
chief representative of a family of f ulama in Kashan

- - 3 . As the imam of the main
madrasih, he might have been a challenge to the position of Mulla Muhammad Naraqi
who after his father's death, by the Shah's decree was the sole mutavallZ of the
Madrasih, and controlled the khalisih endowments of the Madrasih which consisted
of a number of shops in the bazar, a share of the irrigating water of the qanats
and some agricultural land .

Even some junior members of the Naraqi family, who were not of the same
rank as Mulla Muhammad

and were held in less public esteem in the town and its
surroundings, joined the movement. Mulla Ja far Naraqi, son of Mulla Mahdi
(known as Aqa Buzurg), who was a cousin of Mulla Muhammad , together with Mulla
Hashim,    the youngest son of Mulla- Ahmad 6 , and later two sons of another brother
of Mulla Muhammad called Mirza Mahmud and Haji Mirza Kamal al-Din who were

'                   7 '

resident in Naraq, became Babis . There are some contradictions over the
conversion of Mulla Ja'far who is the author of the Shi i prayer al-Hujjat al-

,  while Nabil believes that  during   his visit to the Bab in Kashan,
'despite his consummate eloquence', Mulla Ja'far was compelled to acknowledge
outwardly the merits of the cause of his adversary (i.e. The Bab), though at
heart he refused to believe in its truth' . But it appears that Nabil's
disapproval of 'the haughty and imperious' Mulla Ja far and emphasis on his
dubious recognition is expressed in the light of his later Azali tendencies

In Tehran, Mulla Husain stayed in the Madrasih-i Mirza Salih (Pa Minar),
which was then a gathering place for Shaykhi tullab in the capital . Despite

his earlier success with Shaykhis, he was faced here with the firm rejection of
the chief mudarris of the school. Haji Mirza Muhammad Khurasani (Muhawalati) ,

' - 2

who according to-Nabil was 'the leader of the Shaykhi community of Tihran* ,
strongly criticised Bushruyihi for provoking a schism in the Shaykhi camp, at
a time when there was an urgent need to deliver Shaykhism 'from the obscurity
into which it was sunk 1 . He warned Mulla Husain   that his 'subversive doctrines'

would eventually endanger the existence of 'the remnants of the Shaykhis in the
city 1 . Khurasani, who seemed to have had some previous knowledge of Mulla
Husain, expressed his regret that after the death of Sayyid Kazim, Mulla Husain

did not 'strive to promote the best interests of the Shaykhi community ...' .
These remarks imply that unlike the younger and more challenging students of
Sayyid Kazim,

Khurasani in accordance with some other Shaykhis of moderate
attitude such as Mulla Hasan Gauhar in Karbila', Mulla Muhammad Mamaqani and

_     _f      _ _   •_    — _                        •__                  -

Khan Kirmani, was inclined to treat the Shaykhi doctrine as a beneficial and
inoffensive scholastic subject rather than paying attention to its messianic
aspects. Hence, his worries about the 'obscurity' of the Shaykhi cause and the
possible extinction of a declining community of believers in the face of
continuous pressure from its opponents seem justified, taking into account the
risk of a new wave of reaction in response to the new call. Besides it is not
unlikely that Khurasani was afraid of losing his reputation vis-a-vis an active
rival like Mulla Husain, who had already begun to attract his best students .
Mulla Husain's response to the 'evasive answers' and 'contemptuous behaviour'
of Haji Mirza Muhammad appears to have been mild and even apologetic. He
assures Khurasani that he has no intention of prolonging his stay in Tehran or
indeed that he aims to 'abase or suppress the teachings of the Shaykh and
Sayyid.' . He appears to have been under some pressure not only from the Shaykhi
quarter, but perhaps also from the government to limit his activities to a

and distribute some Babi literature. Perhaps with the help of some friends,
he duplicated copies of Qayywn al-Asma9 , and distributed them amongst eighteen

As his title shows, though he was still a talabih, he was engaged in private
tuition in the houses of notables and government officials in order to meet his
financial needs . After Nuri's conversion, in the same year Mulla Mahdi and
his brother Mulla Baqir Kandi (Kani), who were both private tutors, were
initiated amongst the believers . Mulla Mahdi, in addition, acted as imam-i

V

Mulla Husain's

journeys to central and eastern Iran in the course of the
first three years of the movement resulted in the formation of Babi groups and
communities in the major cities based almost entirely on the previous Shaykhi
network. The conversion of the Shaykhi elements in these centres created the
backbone of the Babi (and then Baha'i) community of Iran, and some of these
converted fulama played a crucial role in the developments of the next few
years. But Mulla Husain's missions were characteristic of few other missions

which were undertaken inside Iran in the same period. The efforts of Mulla
Yusuf Ardabili, an ardent and energetic preacher and the Letter of Hayy,   who in

his numerous visits to various provinces, never stayed in any place more than a

In spite of successes in the lower and middle ranks of the Shaykhi ^ulama,
in his interviews with the well established Shaykhi mujtahids such as Mulla
Muhammad Mamaqani in Tabriz and Haji Muhammad Karim Khan in Kirman, Mulla Yusuf
failed to gain their support for the Bab. Indeed both his mission and those of
Mulla Muhammad
•       fAli Barfurushl (Quddus) and Mulla Sadiq Muqaddas to Kirman for
the purpose of delivering the Babi message to Karim Khan were faced with his
strongest disapproval 2 . The tense Babi activities throughout Iran, which mainly
focussed on the conversion of the Shaykhi elements, before causing any serious
concern for non-Shaykhi (ulama, alarmed influential Shaykhis, who saw the
expansion of the Babi movement in direct contrast to their own influence and
authority in the Shaykhi community, and thus employed all they had at their
disposal to defy the Bab. But the opposition of Karim Khan did not prevent

of the community remained sympathetic towards the Shaykhis, various attempts
made by Mulla Muhammad Zakir Yazdi and Ardabili to win over the public, met with

hostile reactions. In spite of the assistance they received from Mulla Ahmad
Azghandi, a young Shaykhi mujtahid who already after his conversion by Mulla

in Khurasan was instructed to introduce the Babi message in Yazd, the
Babi missions failed to attract the allegiance of the Shaykhi community primarily

intimidations and assaults of the incited mob . This implicit support for the
Babis in the early years, more than anything, was aimed towards weakening of
the rival (ulama factions by using the Babi issue - a motive which is comparable
to the support of Imam Jum^ih of Isfahan or that of Shi^i ''ulama of ^Atabat in
the trial of Bastami. Nevertheless, in spite of these ephemeral supports, the

anti-Babi feeling in Yazd was so predominant that it forced Mulla Muhammad     •

(a Letter of Hayy) eventually to switch              sides to Karim Khan's camp and

the Nayriz upheaval, that the public preachings of Sayyid Yahya            Darabi (Vahid)

"3
in Yazd attracted a large audience and caused some excitement .

In Qazvin, in spite of the anti-Shaykhi sentiments long expressed by Mulla
Muhammad Taqi Baraghani, the Babi message managed not only to attract the

sympathy of Haji     ^Abd al-Wahhab Qazvini, an eminent mujtahid of Qazvin whose

sons Mulla Muhammad      fAli and Mulla Hadi were both initiated amongst the Letters

of Hayy, but also to absorb mullas with Shaykhi affiliation. Mulla Taqi Qazvini,

Mulla Jaffar Qazvini, Mulla ^Abd al-Husain          Qazvini, all Shaykhis from Rudbar,

Mulla Javad Valiyani, Mulla ''Ali Baraghani (brother of Mulla Muhammad           Taqi and

uncle of Tahirih), Haji      Shaykh Muhammad     Nabil Qazvini, Mulla Hasan   Kallih ,
Darritii, and many other Shaykhi merchants and tradesmen were amongst the first
who accepted the Bab, chiefly as a result of the activities of Mulla Jalil Urumi,

-             - _               -     4
Mulla Yusuf Ardabili and later Tahirih         .

As in Isfahan and Tabriz, but perhaps more explicitly in Qazvin, the wide­
> spread acceptance of the Bab by the Shaykhi mullas was the result of the past

message reached Qazvin at a time when the Shaykhi community, due to the anti-

Next day, he ascended the pulpit and proclaimed the advent of the Bab, calling
for the support of the believers. After forty days, in company with a large
group of followers he set out for Atabat .

In the course of the next four years as the Babi community of Qazvin
expanded, the confrontation between them and their adversaries intensified.
After the arrival of Tahirih and her companions from ''Atabat in 1263 (1847), the

conflict reached its height in a secret battle, which finally resulted in the
assassination of Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani in early 1264 (1848) and

following that the severe persecution of the Babis of Qazvin. The earliest
recorded executions of Babis (Shaykh Salih Karimavl, an Arab disciple of Tahirih

and two other Babi mullas, Mulla Tahir Shirazi and Mulla Ibrahim Mahallati) were

carried out as a reprisal for Baraghani's death. As in Shiraz and Isfahan in
1261-3, here in Qazvin the hostile rejection of the ^ulama and the isolation of
the Babis resulted in further militancy by the Babis and the polarisation of the
Qazvin community into a pro-Babi minority and an anti-Babi majority.

The pattern of the activities of the early Babi preachers, and the nation­
wide support they received from the new generation of the middle and low rank
Shaykhi 'ulama, signifies the potential of the movement to absorb and mobilise
a large body of the 'ulama (who formed the lower strata of the clerical
structure)entirely on the grounds of their previous Shaykhi conviction.
Considering the fact that they were exposed to the Shaykhi messianic prophecies,
the converted 'ulama represented that section of the clergy who for some time
were subjected to the domination, if not the direct pressure, of the high ranking
mujtahids, both in terms of ideological and social control. If by undermining
the messianic aspects of the Shaykhi teachings, the older generation of the
Shaykhi mujtahids contented themselves with a marginal leadership over small
communities of Shaykhi sympathisers by adopting a framework almost identical to
that of their non-Shaykhi counterparts, and if, on the other hand, some Shaykhis
like Karim Khan who enjoyed exceptional privileges were able to propound a new
sectarian tendency, then the majority of the younger Shaykhi mujtahids, or mullas
of the lower ranks, or senior religious students (tulldb-'C

qarib at—ijtihad) ,
who witnessed the decline and retreat of Shaykhism under the pressure of thefuqaha'
became disillusioned with the ineffectiveness of the older generation and
attracted to a more drastic solution, which offered them a convincing answer not
only to the problem of succession after Rashti, but to their hesitations in

1\.   MJQ. (pp.473-4).

breaking away from the ''ulama hierarchy.

Contrary to the Shaykhi support, the response of the ''ulama from a non-
Shaykhi background was generally hostile. This reaction mainly came from those
younger mujtahids, who in spite of their hereditary privileges or advantages
from being associated with a certain eminent mujtahid, still were not able to
consolidate their positions as the sole religious leaders in various cities, in
the void which appeared after the death of a number of important mujtahids.
Though at first they did not see the danger of the Babi activities, as some of
the Shaykhis did, and though their reaction was hesitant and half-hearted, in
the later stages, when the movement broadened its popular base, they reacted
with alarm. Their anxieties increased further when they saw the possibility
of backing for the movement coming from certain factions of the government, or
from high ranking imam jum^ihs of various cities. Imam jun/ihs in particular,
after a period of relegation to secondary positions under the independent fuqaha,
had now found the chance to reassert their old domination by allying themselves
with the Babis, but only to an extent that would not harm their reputation.

However, the overall support given by the state to the ''ulama, and the
obedience of the public towards them, greatly assisted the mujtahids in
maintaining their control, by isolating the Babi elements, and thus diminishing
the chances of mass conversion in major cities. The events of the first four
years above all made it clear that in spite of continuous efforts by the Babis
to open a dialogue with mujtahids, the high ranking 'ulama never impartially
considered the message of the Babi movement, nor tolerated its growth at any
point. But they were shrewd enough to notice that the theoretical basis on
which the Babi movement was founded conflicted with their own authority and
their monopoly over the community. By isolating the Babi minority in the cities,
and by applying all forms of pressure and persecution, the 'ulama forced the
Babis into a defensive position and thus to take a more militant stance which
manifested itself in the form of armed resistance.

CHAPTER SEVEN

Tujjar and Asnaf

In the early years of the movement, parallel to the conversion of the
Shaykhi 'ulama, some progress was also achieved in converting members of the
merchant class in the commercial and industrial centres of Iran.   The conversion
of the tujjar, significantly from the lower ranks but also including some
important merchants, and following them the conversions of members of the Asnaf,
such as industrial manufacturers, wholesalers, traders and local craftsmen,
created the second largest group of believers after the ''ulama in the early
Babi community. In these conversions, the role of the early Babi missionaries
was instrumental, but it was the inter-communal bonds between the Shaykhi 'ulama
and tujjar, as well as the family background and the past occupation of the Bab
himself, which encouraged the merchants to join the new movement.

The Bab's involvement in trade has been discussed in an earlier chapter,
together with his mercantile family background and the movements which took
place from trade to religious scholarship in his family . In addition, the
religious, mystical and pious inclinations amongst the tujjar and their
implications for the intellectual development of the Bab were also examined at
some length. Indeed, for a converted merchant with a similar background to
that of the Bab, Sayyid ^Ali Muhammad represented an ideal type to whom he could
look as his spiritual guide, and with whose mission he could identify himself.

Here a question should be asked about the nature of the involvement of the
merchants and guilds in the movement, and the extent to which economic
activities, or occupational inter-connections contributed to their new
affiliation. Bearing in mind the economic climate of the time, it is vital to
examine to what degree support of the new movement was a reflection of the
growing aspirations, or for that matter dissatisfaction of the merchants who
sought salvation in the fulfilment of the messianic prophecies in the new
movement. Equally important is how far the educational training, religious and
mystical attachments, or more important for this study, acquaintance with
Shaykhi teachings, were responsible for the conversion of the above groups.
When the circumstances combined both these aspects, namely economic climate and
intellectual orientation, then it appears that the message of the Babi movement

1\.   See above Chapter Three.

found the chance to penetrate the hearts and minds of those individuals who had
long been in search for a cause which would embody their expectations or console
their grievances.

To demonstrate the role of the tujjar in the early days of the movement,
some attention is given in this chapter to a few merchants in Isfahan, Kashan
and Qazvin. This limited observation in no way aims to provide a comprehensive
survey of all Babi merchants or guild members throughout Iran, yet it is an
attempt to reach a better understanding of the character, ideas and activities
of a few against the background of the general economic situation of the time.

In the early days of the publication of the new message in Qazvin, Mulla
Ja^far Qazvini was present at a conversation which clearly exemplifies the
circumstances under which most of the conversions, sometimes contrary to the
wishes of the older generation, had taken place. This sums up the way in which
the two aspects of material life and spiritual values were combined together in
order to prepare the way for the recognition of the Bab. When young Mirza
Muhammad Mahdi Baghibanbashi writes to his father Haji ^Abd al-Karim,he in fact

•                                                .

reflects the attitude of the majority of adherents, who in one way or another,
in taking up the cause of the SKIrazI merchant, were in search of new sets of
values.
Enclosing a booklet which contained extracts of the Bab's writings, Muhammad

Mahdi informs his father of the loss of merchandise in the course of his journey:

> 'Five thousand tumans worth of silk which belonged to us,
> to my uncle, and to others, was totally sunk in the sea.
> Divers and rescue workers made attempts to save it, but
> with no success. However God granted us an unexhaustible
> treasure of which not a particle will be lost if we consume
> till the Final Day. Here I send it to you to benefit and
> and let others benefit without fearing of its exhaustion^.

Mulla Ja^far relates that after receiving the letter his father was weeping and
saying to his friends; 'How on earth can this booklet provide money for the

expenses of my family' .

Not only in the case of Baghibanbashi in Qazvin, but in Isfahan, Kashan,
Tabriz, Yazd and Shiraz, the same sense of unworldliness and detachment from
material possessions was the cause of attraction for young believers. Reaction
against the values and standards of the older generation seems to have increased
at times of general economic changes 3 when the new generation turns its

1\.   MJQ. (pp.473-4).                    2.   Ibid.

attention from the traditional way of life to new alternative approaches.

Amongst the earliest converts in Isfahan, good examples of this attitude of
the new generation of the Shaykhi tujjar may be observed in Sayyid Muhammad ''All

—       —   v                                     *
and Sayyid Muhammad Hadi Nahri Tabataba'i, two brothers descended from a well
established Shaykhi family of Isfahan, who were well known becuase of their
social and economic status. Their attention was first drawn to the new
revelation when they were in ^Atabat in 1260. They had heard of the new claims
through Mulla ' Ali Bastami or perhaps some other Letters since they had past

acquaintance with many students of Rashti. After the publication of the message
in Karbila, they immediately decided to set out for Shiraz, but when they arrived,
the Bab had already left the city for Hijaz . On their return to Isfahan, they
met Mulla Husain whom they appeared to know from ^Atabat and to whom they

declared their faith . Later
A

in 1261 (1845) they made another journey to Shiraz
to pay a visit to the Bab . Afterwards Muhammad ^Ali returned to Karbila,

I          •
whereas Hadi remained in Isfahan . As Shaykhi dignitaries both in Isfahan and
Karbila, the Nahris were able to encourage others to give their support to the
movement.

The Nahris' association with the Shi i community of Atabat started with
their father Sayyid Mahdi, who emigrated from India to Najaf, and later became
a devoted adherent of Ahsa'i

. He gained a good reputation by founding a number
of public endowments such as a caravanserai and public bath in Najaf, and
constructing a channel to supply drinking water for the inhabitants . He also
invested the family fortune in land and property and acquired a number of shops
in the area. Later, because of the Wahhabi invasion of Iraq, he returned to

Isfahan for the rest of his life, it seems that he retained his links with Atabat,

Brought up in a devoted Shaykhi environment, his son Sayyid Muhammad Ali
joined the ranks of the 'ulama. He finished his primary studies in Isfahan, and
later joined Sayyid Kazim's circle in Karbila! His brother Sayyid Hadi however
remained in Isfahan. Though he was a Shaykhi, he developed close relations with

—                                      —          2                 — —
Shafti, and later married his niece, Khurshid    Baygum . Later, Sayyid Hadi also
moved to Karbila, where he and his wife both attended Rashti's lectures. Their
elder brother Sayyid Ibrahim remained in Isfahan presumably to look after the
family business .

Like their father, the Nahri brothers represented an intermediary link be­
tween the ''ulama and tujjar. Parallel to their enthusiasm for theological studies,
Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad and Sayyid Hadi were also active in the field of trade. As
members of the Persian mercantile community of Iraq, they conducted their trade
with Iran from their office in Baghdad . Probably Sayyid Ibrahim, who in addition
to his local ventures was also involved in trade, acted in partnership with his
brothers . Yet the fortune accumulated during the next few decades was not only
due to trade, but mainly the result of their investment in land, agricultural
tenure and property in Isfahan . In fact, on the basis of the pattern of colla­
boration between Sayyid Ibrahim and some of the religious figures in Isfahan,
there is some evidence to think that Sayyid Mahdi and even Sayyid Hadi for a
while acted as the economic and financial advisers and also bankers and brokers
to the eminent mujtahids such as Imam Jum'ih and Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shafti,
who were always on excellent terms with them 7 .

brothers met their death in 1296 (1879). (Ishraq Khavari, pp.52 ff).

But the emergence of the new movement brought about some dramatic changes
in the life of the family. While still in Karbila, the two brothers met Sayyid
''Ali Muhammad the Bab during his pilgrimage (1258/1842), and like others, they

I
too were impressed by his character . Therefore, by the time the Bab announced
his mission in Isfahan, Hadi and Muhammad  'Ali were among the first to give their

allegiance, whereas Sayyid Ibrahim showed no great enthusiasm for the new move-

ment at this time . The economic condition of the family was also affected by
the new movement. It seems that after their conversion, the Baghdad trade was
gradually liquidated. However it is likely that this happened as a result of

the stagnation in the trade of southern Iran and in particular the Baghdad trade
At the same time, as the Nahris were gradually pulling out of business, they
devoted their time, money and effort to the progress of the movement.

The Nahri brothers are a clear example of the prosperous families from this
social category in the mid-nineteenth century, with both religious and economic
affiliations who possessed influential positions in city life. They belonged to
a generation of enlightened merchants who either developed a strong inclination
towards theological studies, or else provided effective support for the Shaykhi
leaders. They regarded the appearance of the Bab, in the person of a young
Shlrazi merchant, as the personification of the new concept of the holy man,
contrary to the traditional image of the ^ulama. Thus any economic factor which
may have influenced their religious commitments was certainly less important
than the purely intellectual and religious tendencies which emerged as a result
of the Shaykhi environment. Without such teaching, which perhaps had a greater
significance for them than their economic ventures, they would have been unlikely
to have joined a messianic movement, particularly at such an early stage.

The preoccupation of the Nahris with those Shi^i prophecies is evident in
a number of enquiries which they made in 'Atabat prior to 1260 . Also in their

early correspondence with the Bab, on one occasion they asked about certain
remarks in the first part of the 'Commentary of the Book' (i.e. Qayywn al-Asma ( )
regarding 'the signs and the evidences' (Ayat va ^Alamaf) of the 'pure religion'
(Din-i Khalis) . Further, referring to the traditions concerning the occurrence
of r-ija^t they questioned the liability of the proofs for the immediate

__  f\
manifestation of Qa'im . On two other occasions, while quoting a verse from the
Quran: 'God blots out and he establishes whatever He will; and with Him is the
Essence of the Book' 3 , they enquired about the implications of the renovation
of the Book in the new revelation 4-. These questions, together with many others
along the same lines, suggest that the Nahris, in spite of being primarily
merchants, were preoccupied with messianic themes which were advocated at that
time in the Shaykhi circle in ''Atabat.

In the course of the next few years, the Nahris remained active Babis both
in Isfahan and in Karbila, where in cooperation with others they were instru­
mental in the conversion of a number of believers from different social and
occupational backgrounds. In spite of the Nahris' approach to the question of
the Bab's revelation, which is best reflected in their opposition to Tahirih in
»   •

^
the gathering of Badasht in 1264 (1848), it appears that Shams al-2uha* (Sayyid
Hadi's wife) held much more liberated views on the ideas and aims of the Babi
movement. Immediately after the Badasht, Sayyid Muhammad Hadi was killed in the
course of a night attack which was carried out by the inhabitants of the village
of Niyala against a company of the Babis who were on their way to Mazandaran.
.      ^Ali returned to Isfahan and after the events of Tabarsi and the
execution of the Bab, remained largely inactive, though he kept his firm commit­
ment to the Babi and later Baha'i beliefs.

The Nahri brothers were not the only early converts amongst merchants of
Isfahan. Haji Muhammad Riza Javahiri, who was a young merchant in his twenties,
was also converted to the movement when the news of the appearance of the Bab
first spread in Isfahan. Like many other early Babis whose conversions were the
outcome of some earlier mystical and intuitive experiences, Muhammad Riza's
recognition of the Bab was preceeded by a dream in which he had visited the Imam

of the Age at the time of his pilgrimage to the shrine of Husain.  As it is

reported, this dream was the source of inspiration for Muhammad Riza to pursue

the Imam in the world of reality. He also appears to have enjoyed inherited
wealth and public respect, and like the Nahris conducted trade through the
Baghdad route. After his conversion, his new commitments not only cost him
financial loss and then bankruptcy, but the hostility and antagonism of his
close relatives. He was arrested for a brief period in 1266 (1850) and imprisoned
in Anbar-i Daulati in Tehran before being freed by an Armenian merchant who paid
four thousand tuman for his freedom. Later in 1268 (1852) he was arrested and
executed in Tehran together with other suspected Babis .

Beside the merchants in Isfahan, there were Babi converts in other
commercial centres. One of the most celebrated of them was Haji  Mirza Jani

(sometimes called Parpa), a young merchant from Kashan who is mostly known for
the highly important historical account of Nuqtat al-Kaf, of which he was

apparently the writer . He embraced the cause of the Bab when in 1260 he met
Mulla Husain in Kashan.

As is evident from remarks cited in Nuqtat

al-Kaf t Mirza Jani's enthusiasm
for Shaykhism originated in the admiration he felt for the eminent Shaykhi
leaders, rather than in a systematic study of the Shaykhi doctrine. 'Although
because I had not studied the principals of the sciences (of religion) (qava'id-'i
^ulumY writes the author of Nuqtat  al-Kaf, 'I was not formally affiliated to

this highly elevated order (i.e. Shaykhism), yet out of my deepest emotions

reference to the past Shaykhi leaders  as Babayn   may  be taken as  a   clue to his
previous messianic inclinations.
Another quotation attributed to Haji Mirza Jani, again clearly indicates

his preoccupation with the problem of 'emergence 1 , then a common question for
the students of the Sayyid Kazim:

Indeed the few passages in Tarikh-i Jadid which are either directly or indirectly

attributed to Haji, imply that at the time of Shaykh 's i^tikaf in Kuf ah , Haji
must have been present in ^Atabat . This is not confirmed by Nuqtat al-Kaf or

- -                  '               4
indeed by any other source, yet considering Haji's commercial links with Baghdad

it is not unlikely that he was in contact with the Shaykhi community, and
therefore was aware of the developments within the circle.

A similar acknowledgement of the Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kazim can also be
observed in Mirza Jani's younger brother Haji Mirza Muhammad Isma (il Kashani,

T 5                —6            -
known as Zabih . In his Masnawi. , while Zabih drew a comparison between the

—"  •             —"            *""   •

Shaykhi leaders and the fulama of the time, he stresses the spiritual insight
which enabled them to unveil the truth of the forthcoming Zuhur;

> 'The fulama of the time are the false lights.
> They are obstacles to the emergence of the sun,
> for this reason, the sun of universe ordered:
> "unveil the curtain from his face".
The emergence of the Shaykh (Shaykh Ahmad) and Kazim (Sayyid Kazim)

disclosed all the hidden veils.

> They lifted the false curtain from the face of the truth,
therefore the (ulama became their enemies, and prevented people from

understanding ' ? .

Resemblance in the outlook of the Kashani brothers goes beyond their
dedication to the Shaykhi leaders. The two works of Nuqtat al-Kaf and the
Masnavi of Zabih show certain similarities which in turn suggest the common

intellectual background of their authors. Beside their general historical
value, both works betray the attitudes and beliefs of the compilers. Mirza
Muhammad Isma'' il's Masnavl shows clear signs of Sufi influence, which is evident
not only in the general style of the poetry and the extensive usage of Sufi
vocabulary, but in its treatment of the Bab's (and later Baha'allah's) spiritual
status.  The same influence can be traced in the introduction of Nuqtat al-Kaf f
which basically gives a Shi/i-Sufi justification of the Bab's revelation which
is supported by the Islamic traditions .

The origins of this Sufi inspiration are almost unknown, and there is very
little evidence to suggest a previous connection with the Sufi orders of the
time prior to the conversion of both brothers to the movement. Yet the
possibility of such a connection, particularly through wandering dervishes
should not be ruled out. On a few occasions, Haji Mirza Jani refers to
dervishes who accompanied him on his journies in Iran and Iraq both for the
purpose of trade and later for visiting the Babis in other cities 2 . Considering
the spread of messianic ideas amongst wandering Sufis 3 , it is not surprising
that Haji Mirza Jani should have been influenced by these trends. Indeed the
pantheistic tone of both Nuqtat al-Kaf and Masnavi and their narrative style,
as well as Haji Mirza Jani's interpretation of the 'signs' of Zuhur , indicates
the obvious influence of popular Sufism4 .

On the other hand it is also possible to assume that as an outcome of their
Shaykhi tendencies, some of their interests were directed towards Sufi ideas
and literature. At the same time, it is arguable that this influence, at least
in the case of Nuqtat al-Kaf was partly inspired by the writings of the Bab,
which themselves have strong mystical overtones. Later this tendency was
further intensified by the Sufi ideas current in Babi circles . As for Zabih,
he was also affected by the development in the early phase of the formation of
the Baha't thought, and inevitably shared the Sufi attitudes of its founder

in this period . But still, even after considering the above influences, it is
hard to imagine that such a tendency could have been developed without a
previous knowledge of Sufi terminology and content. Zabih's Masnav-i seems

^m                          **   *     ^

largely inspired by Masnawi, of Rumi. It is divided into seven books (by
comparison with the five of Rumi' s Masnawi, ) and in many parts has clear signs
of the allegorical stories and parables of the above work. The style of Nuqtat
al-Kaf> however, in some parts is reminiscent of Sufi biographical works such
as ''Attar's Tadhk^mt al-Awliya*.

This mystical tendency laid a suitable foundation for the reshaping of
eschatological expectations within the framework of the Shaykhi-Sufi traditions.
The sense of awe and respect for religious leaders gradually developed into a
sense of anticipation for the Promised One. For Zabih as for the author of
Nuqtat al-Kaf* the emergence of the Imam was primarily defined in terms of the

•                   —
Shi^i expectation of Sahib al-Zaman, but it also benefited from the Sufi concept

of the holy guide. In a passage of the Masnavi, which is reminiscent of the
Shaykhi visitation dreams, Zabih describes a vision of Sahib al-Zaman. In this
vision, which occurs only after the kind of long and laborious vigilance common
amongst Sufis, Zabih
~™  •

became aware of the material existence of the Imam, whom he
is able to visit later in reality in the character of the Bab;

> 'Twenty years ago, in the state of khals-ih 2 ,
> I saw that perfect jarrial •
> From then onwards, in order to come to his presence,
> I sought for Sahib al-Zaman.
> Because I was aware that the lord of universe is alive,
> therefore I sought for his visit.

> Whether it was a vision or a dream,
> I cannot say what state I was in,
> I only know that I saw him,         ~
> twenty years prior to his emergence* .

Again in 1263 (1847), when the Bab was passing through Kashan on his way
from Isfahan to Tehran, Zabih expresses his own eagerness for visiting the Bab

1\.   In his Masnav-i, Zabih refers to his visits to Baha'allah on several

in the form of another anticipatory dream:

> 'Before "the lord of the people" (khudavand-i anam i. e . the Bab)
> sets out for Kashan, every day and night,
> I prayed to God for the honour of his sight.
> One night, I had a serene dream,
> that his excellency, who resembles the sun,
> shone in Klshln.
> Next morning I said to my brother,
> that soon the sublime sun will rise.
> He said, there is no news of him in the whole world,
> I briefly replied; "He will come today".
> It so happened that his excellency arrived the same day,
shining like the sun'l.
It was this same visit of the Bab to Kashan that illustrated the depth of
Kashani brothers' devotion to the Babi cause. It also provided them with an
opportunity to arrange several meetings between the Bab and some sympathisers

^                               _
amongst the Shaykhi 'ulama and tujjar . At the same time the Kashani Babis
offered their assistance to the Bab who had shown some intention of being
rescued from the government security escort which was taking him to the capital.
As it is reported by Tarikh—i Jadid, Zabih declared in conformity with the other
believers of Kashan that they were ready to provide the necessary means for the
escape: 'It would be possible to bring you forth from hence; we pray you there­
fore to accord us permission, and you can go whithersoever you please, and we
will attend and accompany you wherever it be; for we will thankfully and gladly
give up our lives, our wealth, our wives, and our children for your sake* 4 .

The Bab's response to this offer was the usual resignation and willingness
to accept his 'destiny': 'We need the help and support of none but God, and His
will only do we regard 1 . Nevertheless, the Bab's reluctance to take any
militant action did not prevent the Kashani brothers from showing their loyalty
and dedication to the cause of the Bab. As it is evident from Zabih's own

remarks in the course of the next few years, their zealous adherence to the
movement lessened their popularity in the city of Kashan:

In spite of the mounting criticism and open hostility, especially after
1265 (1849) both brothers remained 'the slaves of his (i.e. the Bab's) thresh-
hold'    Zabih refers to his brother as 'a lost-hearted Haji, who was ready to
sacrifice his life' 3 , an aspiration which soon turned into reality. After the
unsuccessful attempt on the life of Nasir al-Din Shah in 1268 (1852) , together
with many other Babis, he was arrested in the shrine of Shah (Abd al- Azim near
Tehran, whre he probably compiled his historical account of the movement. The
sanctity of the bast was ignored, and he was taken to the Anbar dungeon, only
to be killed shortly after by the hand of Aqa Mahdi Malik al-Tujjar and other

merchants of Tehran . Zabih remembers the death of his brother in the

following words:

> 'That lover of the truth, the adorer of the Rabb-i A fla (i.e. the Bab)
> he dedicated his possession and his life in the path of his Lord.

> He was finally taken to the dungeon of oppression,
> and then they strangled him with a piece of rope.
> No man the like of that devoted man ever came to this world.
> His death burnt the heart of sorrowful Zabih.
> A mystic like him the world never witnessed,
> he finally was martyred in the path of truth.
> His name would remain in the book of lovers,
> his soul would ascend to Heaven'^.

The Shaykhi merchants of Isfahan and Kashan were not the only converts in
the ranks of the tujjar. In other cities of Iran, families of merchants with

similar religious and occupational backgrounds were also attracted towards the
Bab. In Qazvin the Farhadis were amongst the first who supported the new cause

in early 1261/1845 . In the few decades prior to 1260, two brothers of
Azarbaijaii origin, Haji Allah Virdi Farhadi and Haji Asadallah Farhadi who had

~                   •                             .
long been engaged in the internal trade between Qazvin and Yazd, or sometimes
between Yazd and India, managed to establish themselves amongst the well

> only reason for their distinction since their Shaykhi affiliation differentiated

to their previous acquaintance with Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i in Yazd, or their close
association with Mulla ^Abd al-Wahhab Qazvini, the imam of the shah mosque and
a close student and adherent of Ahsa'i , the Farhadis became devoted Shaykhis
and in Ahsa'i 1 s last visit to Qazvin towards the end of his life, played host to
.him

For merchants like the Farhadis, commitment to Shaykhism was before any
theoretical conviction, an affection for Ahsa'i and a devotional attachment to
his close disciples like Mulla ^Abd al-Wahhab Qazvini - an adherence which was
deeply rooted in their social and occupational loyalties. In the tense struggle
for religious control of Qazvin, the Farhadis were in the camp of Mulla Abd al-
Wahhab and thus in opposition to the rising authority of the newly established
and highly ambitious Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani (and to a lesser extent his
brother Mulla Muhammad Salih Baraghani, the father of Tahirih) who was trained

t              . But the theoretical differences between the two mujtahids served
as a pretext for a more material conflict which owed much to the territorial
divisions and possibly the Haydari-Ni mati hostility (known in Qazvin as luti
bazar ) between the city quarters .

Mulla 'Abd al-Wahhab, from Bar al-Shafa* in the Darb-i Kushk quarter was a
well established mujtahid of Qazvin who was respected by his fellow mujtahids in
Iran and 'Atabat mainly because he studied under all important ulama of the
first generation in f Atabat such as Shaykh Ja^far Najafl, Sayyid Muhammad

_   _ _            3

Tabataba'i and others . However, by the 1840 f s as he grew old his religious
control over Qazvin seems to have been weakened by the threat of the Baraghanis
who gradually broadened their sphere of influence from the quarters of Dimaj
and Qumlaq in the west of the city towards the centre where both major mosques
of Qazvin, the Jami' mosque in Khiyaban quarter and the Shah mosque (or Khaqan-i
Maghfur) in Darb-i Kushk quarter were located . Control of the central mosques
and advancement to the office of imam jum ih were important not only because of
the fact that they provided a larger public audience, and a greater degree of
attention from the public and the government, but also because these mosques
held extensive endowments both in land and property which were almost solely
under the control of the mutavallis .

In the early years of his stay in Qazvin after his return from 'Atabat,
Mulla Muhammad Taqi was well received by 'Abd al-Wahhab who even helped him to

"6                                                                   — —
establish himself in the city . But nevertheless this did not hinder Baraghani's
drive for power which he implemented by means of economic wealth and religious
leadership. The anecdotes related by Tunikabuni in the biography of Mulla
Muhammad Taqi, in a few cases clearly demonstrate that his legal and religious

judgements were greatly influenced by his personal interests rather than being

directed by the soundness and impartiality required from a mujtahid . Either
by presiding over substantial legal and financial cases of which he received a
large percentage under the pretext of expenses and legal charges, or by
collecting alms, expropriating the revenues of the unmanaged endowments or
Khalisih villages, and even directly participating in economic activities, the
Baraghanis were soon able to amass a large fortune. Hence it is not surprising
that like Shafti and Karbasi, Mulla Muhammad Taqi who in his youth, when still a
talabih, was in such poverty that he could not even afford to eat properly for

r
several days, in less than two decades became amongst the richest of the ulama
of Iran. The mosque and madrasih of Salihiyih in the Qumlaq quarter which is
one of the biggest mosques in Iran, and the mosque of the neighbouring Dimaj
quarter were built in the 1250's and 60's at Mulla Muhammad Salih's and Mulla

Muhammad Taqi's own expense and were signs of their prosperity, erected in order
to glorify their position 2 .

Not only in financial and legal matters, but in gaining a superior
religious leadership, Mulla Muhammad Taqi was anxious to outweight his rivals
even at the expense of denying the ijtihad of his own brother 3 . At one stage,
contrary to the Usuli doctrine, he ruled for the prohibition of the Friday

prayer. However when the opportunity arose he overruled his own f&tva and
conducted the Friday prayers of the city in the absence of another rival Haji
Sayyid Muhammad Taqi Qazvini . One may assume that one of his objectives for
gaining the office of imam jum ih and the trusteeship of the Jami mosque over
which he was in dispute with Haji Sayyid Muhammad Taqi was to control the
extensive endowments of the mosque. This assumption may further be substantiated
when it is considered that a portion of these endowments, including five shops
and the lease of fifteen houses were located in the Qumlaq quarter where the
Baraghanis had already established their authority .

Among many reasons which have been given for the opposition of Mulla
Muhammad Taqi to Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i (which in due course gave rise to

condemnation of Ahsa'i by the fuqaha of             Atabat and Iran)   one is particularly

relevant to this specific       internal conflict in Qazvin.           It has been reported
that Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani who in mid 1820's regarded himself as the

chief mujtahid and the most knowledgeable (a'Zom) of the ''ulama of Qazvin,
expected Ahsa'i

to arrive and stay in his house rather than in the house of those
whom he regarded as inferior to himself. Yet Shaykh Ahmad preferred to stay in

r             - 2
the house of ' Abd al-Wahhab . For Mulla Muhammad Taqi this was interpreted as
a hostile gesture far more humiliating than a simple breach of social etiquette.
As in Yazd and Isfahan, in Qazvin the arrival of Shaykh Ahmad introduced a new
dimension to the old conflict and widened the divisions between the ulama. No
doubt receiving support from a revered scholar like Ahsa'i with his growing
popularity was a blessing which could not be underestimated since for their
support the 'ulama were dependent on the loyalty of the public in general and
the urban notables and merchants in particular.
In the opinion of Mulla Muhammad Taqi this wa-s a threat to his superior
authority. The danger of Shaykhism's becoming an alternative to the dominant
orthodoxy was further felt by Muhammad Taqi when his own younger brother Mulla

~                               *         *3                                   U-l

i became a follower of Shaykh Ahmad . In an important letter to Mulla Abd

al-Wahhab, Shaykh Ahmad refers to the Baraghani's fear of losing his economic
and religious privileges when he states: 'the devil incited him (i.e. Mulla
Muhammad Taqi) to declare that what I say is blasphemy, and I am blasphemous
and Akhund Mulla 'Abd al-Wahhab is blasphemous, and others in his faction helped
him. Thus came persecution and hardship, and he who was the leader amongst
them, may great misery be upon him, was fearful of his revenues in Iran and
India (darahim al- !fAjam—i va al-Hind)...'

•       4 . This would confirm that in the
condemnation of the Shaykhis, the rZyasat of the Baraghani and many mujtahids
alike were at stake and with it their domination over the endowments, religious
courts, alms, as well as their control of madrasihs and religious students.

In this context, the deterioration of the conflict and the polarisatwnof

the city community into two camps, inevitably drew merchants like the Farhadis
further into the dispute. Primarily because of their religious loyalty, but
also because of a threat to their material interests, they were concerned with
the increasing power of Mulla Muhammad Taqi. Not only did the latter's anti-

Shaykhi propaganda endanger their economic security, but also his ventures in
land and property to some extent limited their control of their holdings.
Considering the fact that many merchants like the Nahris in Isfahan acted as
functionaries, brokers and financial consultants to the mujtahids in the manage­
ment of the religious endowments, one may suspect that the decline in the
influence of ' Abd al-Wahhab in terms of losses of revenue from the endowments
was a source of animosity between the Farhadis and Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani.

However lack of information prevents us from coming to any definite answer, yet
it is known that on occasions, Mulla Muhammad Taqi's controversial verdicts over
financial transactions, commercial contracts and the like»dissatisfied merchants
and forced them to take drastic measures against him .

But if in the elder generation opposition to the fuqaha was expressed in
terms of moral and financial support for the Shaykhi cause, in the younger
generation this opposition turned into a more militant confrontation. Perhaps
it is not a coincidence that such confrontation intensified at a time when in
the 1840 T s the decline in the southern trade and particularly the fall in demand

active in this trade , more than ever made them dependent
on their agricultural and urban holdings in Qazvin, a source of revenue which
inevitably caused frictions and clashes with Baraghani.

The manifestation of this militancy is clearly visible after the Farhadis
recognition of the Bab. By 1260, after the death of Allah Virdi, his four sons,
who had married the four daughters of their uncle Haji Asadallah, in collaboration
with the latter continued the family business 3 . The earliest news regarding the
proclamation of the new Bab came through Haji Mirza Mahmud, a merchant from
Shiraz who visited Qazvin after his pilgrimage of Hajj during which he travelled

with the Bab in the same boat . Their enthusiasm for learning the identity of

the Sahib al-Zaman appears to have been further invigorated by the conversion
of ^Abd al-Wahhab f s sons Mulla Muhammad Hadi and Mulla Muhammad All who were

1                     _          •        _
amongst the Letters of Hayy . Thus Haji Asadallah despatched Mulla Javad

- - - to Shiraz        '

Valiyani             to investigate the' truth of the new revelation 2 . Afterwards,
when Mulla ^Abd al-Jalil Urumi came to Qazvin with the instruction of the Bab,

- T                                              3

the Farhadis became totally committed to the Babi cause . Their commitment,
however, was based less on theological and mystical convictions and more on
occupational loyalties, since neither Asadallah nor Hadi seems to have had any
theological training. In the course of the first few years, the Farhadis were
the centre of Babi activities in Qazvin and the host to many Babi missionaries
and visitors who enjoyed both their hospitality, and in moments of need, their
financial support .
The role of the second of the four brothers, Aqa Muhammad Hadi Farhadi, was

5                                   "

particularly important , since he gradually emerged as one of the leaders of the
Babi community of Qazvin, at the time when the forces of opposition headed by
Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani were determined to eliminate the remnants of the
Shaykhi-Babi influence in the city. After the death of Sayyid Kazim, Abd al-
Wahhab who then was in his seventies, remained undecided over the claims of the
Bab, and despite some attempts by his sons and by other Babis to convince him,
never publicly came to the defence of the Babis . Thus the task of the
protection and security of the community was inevitably transferred to the
younger generation of Shaykhi-Babi mullas and merchants such as Aqa Muhammad
Hadi Farhadi who had the courage and the means of challenging the opposing
'ulama. This was an important development, since Aqa Muhammad Hadi like many
other Babi merchants looked to the Bab as the symbol of the merchants' leader­
ship.

The important role played by the tujjar in effecting the course of prolonged
conflict in Qazvin is best illustrated in the events of 1264 (1848) when in the

face of mounting hostility the Farhadis used all they had at their disposal,
including their wealth and their connections with the asnaf and the lutis in the
city in order to defend themselves and their fellow Babis. In late 1263 (1847)
after the return of Tahirih and her companions to Qazvin , the old chronic
hostilities were- again renewed in the form of a tense anti-Babi campaign.

Shortly afterwards, the death of Mulla 'Abd al-Wahhab left the stage clear for
Muhammad Taqi to attack the Babis from the pulpit by denouncing them as infidels
and religiously unclean. Violence, clashes and physical attacks on the Babis
followed these verbal incitements . When Mulla ''Abd al-Jalll UrumI (Urdubadi)
who, under the protection of the Farhadis was preaching in Qazvin, was attacked
by the mob and was dragged to the madrasih of Mulla Muhammad Taqi to be
bastinadoed in his presence, it was Aqa Muhammad Hadi, his brother Aqa Muhammad

rescued 'Abd al-Jalil     . In another occasion earlier in 1263 (1847) when the Bab
was passing through Miyanih on his way from Tehran to Azarbaijan,
Aqa Muhammad
Hadi and a group of his followers came to his rescue but, as on previous
occasions in Kashan and Tehran, the offer of assistance was turned down by the
Bab 5 .

The Bab's refusal to be rescued by the Farhadis' aid was not because he was
reluctant to escape captivity in Azarbaijan, but chiefly because he considered
any violent confrontation as harmful and ineffective action that would only
worsen his condition. When he was passing through the outskirts of Qazvin, he
wrote a letter to Mulla 'Abd al-Wahhab, calling upon him to intervene on his
behalf and order the mounted escort to set him free in Qazvin . There is no

evidence to suggest any connection between the Bab's letter and Farhadi's action,
nevertheless both indicate the sense of desperation and discontent which then
prevailed over the Bab and his followers. As the Bab in his isolation in the
fortress of Maku and Chihriq more and more adopted a fatalistic attitude towards
his mission, the Babis turned more towards a militant and uncompromising
position.

Signs of his attitude are discernible in the Farhadis when Mulla Muhammad
—                                                                    •
Taqi who could not directly condemn his own niece and daughter-in-law Tahirih,
concentrated his attacks on her followers and companions as well as on other
Babis in the city. Perhaps it is in response to this pressure that Aqa Muhammad

Hadi set up a workshop in the basement of his own house to produce swords and
distribute them among the followers . When Mulla Yahya Darabi (Vahld) who appears

to have been experienced in warfare, arrived in Qazvin that year, Aqa Muhammad
Hadi arranged for training sessions in his house .
The assassination of Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani at the beginning of 1264

(1848) brought the conflict to its peak. It is not clear whether the assassin
or assassins were assisted by Aqa Muhammad Hadi, or whether Mirza (Mulla)
'Abdallah Shirazi who himself claimed to be the assassin was in contact with
Tahirih through the Farhadis, or whether he was independent in his decision.
These are matters which remain to be fully investigated 3 . What is clear however,
is that both Tahirih and the Farhadis came under strongest suspicion and were
accused of being the chief instigators and accomplices. The assassination of
Mulla Muhammad Taqi was the earliest sign of the Babis' militant response to the
pressure which was exerted upon them from the religious authorities.

In the riots which broke out in the city, the house of the Farhadis was
twice sacked by the pro-Baraghani mob and both Haji Asadallah Farhadi and Aqa

Muhammad Mahdi were arrested and detained in the government house together with

Asadallah together with Mirza Abdallah Shirazi and three other Babis were sent
to Tehran as the chief accomplices in the assassination . Due to old age,
suffering on the road and the hardship of prison, Asadallah died in Tehran,
whereas ''Abdallah managed to escape. The three other Babis were brought back to
Qazvin and were executed .
The hostility expressed by Mulla Muhammad towards the Babis,more than being

motivated by a sense of vengeance, was designed to warn Tahirih          and her followers

of the grave consequences of creating any more trouble. However, in spite of
general apprehension amongst the Babis, Aqa Muhammad       Hadi was not demoralised

by the course of events. After the assassination of Baraghani, he avoided
certain arrest and persecution by escaping to Tehran in disguise, but was daring
enough to return to Qazvin in the disguise of a Yazdi caravaneer and rescue his
younger brother from government detention . But Tahirih,          who was still not

divorced from her husband, was under strict surveillance in her father's house
guarded  by trusted women of the   household   and a group  of   lutis  at the gate   .
However, in spite of all the security measures, Aqa Muhammad          Hadi, in colla-

boration with Mirza Husain Ali Baha'allah, drew up a plan to rescue her. At

night Aqa Muhammad Hadi secretly entered Qazvin and after sending a message to

Tahirih through his wife Khatun Jan who disguised herself as a launderess, with

the help of a few friends, Aqa Hasan Najjar, Vali the peddler and Quli ^who were

both lutis, managed to rescue her, and then ride all the way from Qazvin to

Tehran on horses before any of the Baraghanis were able to stop them at the
city gates .
The escape of Tahirih was a blow to Mulla Muhammad and Baraghanis'

•                                •     _ _
reputations.  For the third time the house  of  the   Farhadis was attacked by
tullab and lutis and completely looted, and the whole family underwent severe

persecution and hardship. Fearing for their lives, Khatun Jan and her three
sisters took refuge in the ruined Imamzadih Ahmad outside the city for four

Muhammad Hadi remained in the company of Tahirih on her journey to Badasht, but _ _
after the gathering of Badasht no trace of him was     found.  Even his brother Aqa
Muhammad Javad seems to have been unaware of his ultimate fate . As for the

other Babis, they were also persecuted, their houses and properties were
confiscated by the local governor as a surety for payment of larger ransoms and
they themselves were either imprisoned or forced into exile . It was some years
till the Qazvin Babi community could regain some of its past strength.

Thus in spite of some ephemeral victories, the Qazvin episode ended in set­
back and disbandment of the Babi elements. As in Isfahan and Kashan, in Qazvin
the merchants played a major role in the recruitment and organisation of the new
converts, but unlike the peaceful activities of their fellow Babis in other
places, they intended to put up a stiff resistance against the encroachments of
their opponents. However in this task they largely failed. Although they
enjoyed the cooperation of some of the ulama and the sympathy and assistance
of some other groups, the forces of the opposing ulama which at moments of
crisis were backed by the government, were powerful enough to crush the Babi
minority. Perhaps against their original intention the merchants were forced
to take a militant position. The events of Qazvin in 1264 (1848) was a prologue
to the later resistance which in the next four years dominated the course of
Babi history. The upheavals of Tabarsi, Nayriz and Zanjan and the events of

1268 (1852) in Tehran in various degrees bear the signs of the merchants'
militancy which only appeared when they became disillusioned with the prospect
of adopting a peaceful course in their relation with their opponents.

For these merchants with identical Shaykhi attachments, family links and
professional affiliations, the image of the young Shirazi merchant of a mystical
and ascetic character formed a vision which enabled them to find a sense of
identity and unity in the new movement. The list of converted merchants through­
out Iran is a proof of these emerging forces which represented a distinctive
professional as well as intellectual bond. In Shiraz, Haji Abul Hasan, Aqa

The participation of the tujjar in the expansion of the movement was not
limited to their direct involvement in the course of events. Their main
contribution perhaps was their role as intermediaries in attracting the attention
of other individuals. This is best illustrated in the conversion of members of
various guilds, small manufacturers and craftsmen who were in the course of the
early years increasingly attracted to the Babi ranks. Although no mass conversion
of the asnaf

ever took place - except in the case of Zanjan which happened later,
mostly after 1264 Q.(1848) and culminated in the events of 1266-7 (1850-1) -
many individuals, apparently independent from the guild organisations and mostly
on the basis of local contacts and professional association with the tujjar or
fulama, were directed towards the new mission .

The pattern of the journeys of Babi merchants on the trade routes of central
and western Iran is one indication of the way the Babi doctrine spread in trade
centres, particularly amongst the local merchants and their associated groups.
Haji

Mirza Jani's journey to Iraq in 1259-60 (1843-4) can be regarded not only
as a pilgrimage but also as a journey connected to his trade. "•Zabih• too was
present in Baghdad on a few occasions between 1265-70 (1849-54), presumably for
the same purpose . Sometime prior to 1264 (1848) we find Haji Mirza Jani in

Barfurush, as he himself puts it, 'for the purpose of trade 1 . The mobility of
the merchants bears great significance in the expansion of the movement in all
directions since in the course of these journeys, by employing trade channels
and connections, merchants like Haji Mirza Jani were able to attract new converts
from their own rank.

A group of young local merchants and manufacturers who assembled around
Haji

Mirza Jani and ~*Zabih• in Kashan serves as an example for this relation which
emerged in most Babi communities around the country. As far as the identity of
the converts in Kashan is known, in addition to the younger brothers of Haji

Kamranibaf , Haji Sayyid Mahmud , Mirza Aqa Tajir Kashani 3 and Haji Mirza
Muhammad Riza Makhmalbaf Kashani were all manufacturers and local merchants
who seem to have been in professional contact with Haji Mirza Jani. Haji

~*        <•»                           *                  *
Muhammad Riza Makhmalbaf for example owned a number of velvet weaving workshops
in Kashan, and even operated a trade with India, Istanbul and Baghdad , the
same pattern of trade as Haji Mirza Jani and Zabih, who both seem to have been
engaged in the export of silk products to Baghdad and the Caucasus 6 .

In Isfahan however, the introduction of the movement to the members of
various professions was due to the efforts of the Babi ulama rather than the
merchants.    In this context the role of some individuals who in addition to
their main professions had some minor religious qualifications, is of some
interest. Amongst the Babis of Isfahan, Mulla Ja far Gandum Pakkun (sifter of
wheat) , Mulla Ahmad Saffar (tin-plater), Mulla- Husain Misgar (copper-smith) 8
and Mulla- f Ali- Muhammad Sarraj
- (leather-worker) 9", all

were mentioned with the
title of mulla . In other places converts such as Mulla Kazim Banna (mason)
in Kirman , Mulla Mahdi Kurihpaz (kiln-worker), Mulla Muhammad Musa Namadmal
(felt-maker) and Mulla Ja'far Muzahhib (book-gilder), all in Nayriz , would
suggest that while the second part of their names indicates their main professions
the title mulla was added for some extra religious engagement. Whether this was
a low rank engagement such as being a zakir (one who chants the tragedies of
Karbila) or qari (the reciter of the Qur'an or this was simply an acknowledge­
ment of their religious training, is not known but at any rate they seem to have
been within closer reach of the Babi missionaries.

In the early success of the movement in Isfahan, a special place is
attributed to Mulla Ja'far Gandum Pakkun. Nabil Zarandi believes that he was

the first person to accept Mulla Husain's message in Isfahan .         However it is

likely that he was only attracted to the movement in 1260 (1844) due to 'a
close association with Mulla Husain 1 and he only fully recognised the Bab
later at the time of the latter ! s arrival in Isfahan in 1262 (1846) .       Yet this
emphasis on the early acceptance of Gandum Pakkun perhaps is due to his low
status.   Indeed the Babi sources regard the conversion of Gandum Pakkun and his
honest and wholehearted devotion which ended in his death in the fortress of
Tabarsi as an example of the attention paid by the poor and underprivileged

to the new message.   The Bab himself explains the significance of this conversion
by featuring Mulla Ja^far as a humble individual who was able to grasp the
reality of his cause; 'Look at the Land of Sad (i.e. Isfahan) which in appearance

is the greatest of lands where in each corner of its schools numerous students
are found under the name of knowledge and ijtihad, yet, at the time of refining
(jauharg-iri) Gandum Pakkun will put on the garb of primacy (qamis-i, niqdbat ).
This is the secret of the word of the People of the House (Ahl-i Bayt} regarding
the Time of Manifestation when they say: "The lowest of the people shall become
the most exalted and the most exalted shall become the lowest" 1 .

The conversion of some believers from the ranks of craftsmen and local
producers took place because of their direct contacts with the Babi missionaries
who delivered the message by distributing Babi literature.       Aqa   Ali Akbar
Najjar (carpenter) and Aqa Muhammad Hanasab (henna-miller) first learned of the
new Bab and his claims through Mulla Husain. Aqa Sayyid Abd al-Rahim on the
other hand who was one of Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shafti's bailiffs (mubashir) on

his holdings in the village of Siyafshad on the outskirts of the city, first
heard of the movement through Aqa Akbar Najjar .       As he himself narrated, on
one of his trips to Isfahan, while in the city to complain against a recent
robbery in the village, he accidentally met his close friend Aqa ^Ali Akbar
Najjar and noticed in his possession a tablet written in red ink, which most
probably was a copy of the earlier parts of Qayywn al-AsmaJ .      In reply to his
enquiry, Aqa ''Ali Akbar revealed that he had received the tablet from a certain

scholar (fal-im) who had recently arrived from Shiraz. He was then directed by
his friend to the quarter of Darb-i Kushk , where in the course of the first
visit to Mulla Husain

he professed his acceptance of the new creed. In later
years he became an active Babi after he had paid a visit to the Bab in Isfahan
in 1263 and received a tablet in which he was called by the title of Ismallah
al-Muhazz* .

The above mentioned case exemplifies the way these early conversions led
to the further enquiry and acceptance of other individuals mainly on the basis
of friendship, occupation and religious affiliation. By 1848-50 the number of
artisans, craftsmen and skilled workers who had joined the Babi ranks formed a
sizeable part of the urban Babi communities. There is no record of the number,
the identity and the occupation of the Babis to enable us to make any accurate
assessment of these communities but even judging by the name of those who
participated in specific events such as Babi resistances in Tabarsi, Nayriz and
Zanjan, it is evident that a variety of occupations were represented. From the
360 participants in Tabarsi

four other skilled workers ; one copper-smith (misgar}; one tin-plater (saffar);
one leather-worker (sarraj) and one sifter of wheat (gandim pakkun) , and four
shopkeepers and traders, two apothecaries (''attar), one butcher (qassab) and

one cloth-dealer (bazzaz) . Of 41 Isfahanis,

Tehran .

In fact, if due to its wide geographical distribution the occupational
pattern of the participants of Tabarsi can be taken as a reliable sample which
is representative of the rest of the Babi community throughout the country
around 1264 (1848), it is evident that the participation of the asnaf in the
movement is only second to the fulama. As a whole, of 222 participants whose
occupations are known, more than half (60%) were from the ^ulama (mujtahids,
middle and low rank mullas), less than one third (26%) were from asnaf, about
8% were from small land owners and the remaining 6% were from tujjar, low and
middle rank government officials and other professions. Of course, it is

possible to assume that of 138 participants whose occupations are unknown, a
large proportion were either from asnaf or from peasants who , because of their
humble occupations or because of the insufficiency of the sources, remained
unspecified .

In the upheaval of Zanjan (1265-6/1849-50), as far as it can be judged from
the occasional references to the names and occupations of the participants, it
appears that the involvement of the asnaf was highly significant. The urban

_                  »
nature of the Zanjan conflict not only required this involvement, but enabled
the leaders of various guilds to play leading parts in the development of the
conflict.    However lack of sufficient data prevents us from going beyond general
speculations.    In the events of 1267 (1851) in Isfahan and 1268 (1852) in Tehran,
in which the Babis tried to set up urban resistance against the       ulama and the
government, again members of the asnaf

under the supervision of the   ulama and to a
lesser extent merchants, played an important role.     Sadiq Tabrizi, a
confectioner (shir-ini furush) and Mulla Fathallah
•      Qumi, an engraver (hakkak) ,
who was the son of a book binder, were two of the three main participants who
carried out the attempt on the life of Nasir al-Din Shah, and later were
executed together with many other Babi merchants, small land owners and low
rank state officials who were assembled from all over the country in Tehran.

V

The significance of the professional adherence, as an independent element
in unifying merchants and traders under the Babi banner, calls for closer
examination.    It would be a simplification to assume that the professional
identity of certain groups, and consequently the fluctuations in their economic
conditions, were the only mobilising forces behind their participation in the
movement. Yet, there is some positive evidence which implies that the chrono­
logical parallel between the rise of the movement and fundamental changes in
the economic condition of the region could not be regarded as coincidence.
This previously unrecognised correlation can be better comprehended if the
position of the newly converted merchants and local traders is observed against
the wider economic and commercial background of the period.

The majority of converts within tujjar ranks were not men who had recently
become tujjar but had been brought up in families which were traditionally
engaged in trade.   Either by means of inheritance or collaboration with senior

1\.   Ibid.

members of the family, the new generation preserved the respect and social
standing which usually accompanied a reasonable amount of capital" in the form
of the family business. In nearly all cases they were distinguished as

'prestigious 1 and 'well respected' men, and their active participation in trade
was often indicated also. Yet, the existing sources say very little as far as
the details of this are concerned. However, if the general economic condition
of the time applied to the Babi tujjar as much as to any other, it would be
possible to assume that many of them must have been affected, in one way or
another, by the crises of the middle decades of the nineteenth century. Indeed,
towards the end of the 1830's and in the early 40's, at the time when most of
these younger tujjar, including the Bab himself, became active, the economy of
the country, particularly in sections of urban industry and trade, was under­
going changes.

In the early years of the 19th century, a rapid increase in the volume of
the foreign trade followed by a degree of internal security brought about an
economic revival. The opening of new trade routes and a rise in the consumption
of the home markets made it possible for the merchants to re-emerge as an
influential group. Thanks to their professional bonds, internal and external
contacts with their colleagues, financial ability and relative immunity from
government pressure exerted on other sections, they seem to have prospered
throughout the 1810's and 20 f s . By the mid-1830's and early 40's however,
although commerce was still expanding, Persian merchants found themselves
surrounded with unexpected difficulties. A broad survey of trade in this period
suggests that a combination of independent and often complementary factors, in
a limited space of time brought changes to the economic climate of the country.
Yet, behind these changes a major theme constantly recurs. During this period

the full impact of western commercial domination both in terms of industrial
superiority as well as political presence was experienced for the first time.
Communities of tujjar, together with local traders, craftsmen and those engaged

in small scale urban industries each began in varying degrees to suffer the

effect of foreign penetration   into the home market. The rapid and at the same
time considerable rise in the   volume of European imports, not only made Iran
less self-sufficient and more   dependent on external sources, but also made it
susceptible to fluctuation in   international trade .

In spite of the prosperity of the trade of the south which was conducted
through ports of the Persian Gulf in the earlier decades of the century, by the
end of the 1830 ? s it had begun to suffer from the competition of the north­
western route. The decline of the southern route, owing to the insecurity
prevailing in southern Iran, piracy in the Gulf, remoteness from the markets
of the more heavily populated regions of central and northern Iran, and the
incompatibility of the prices of the imports from the south compared to goods
on the central and northern markets jeopardised the business of many tujjar in

the south, and forced them to search for other alternatives . In his Report on
Commerce, Abbott points out that although in the past two decades (1830's and
40's) the total value of the southern trade had increased,'as a whole this trade
had suffered a decline. The import of cotton fabrics in particular, which at
one stage in the early 1830's amounted to about two-thirds of the total volume

of this trade, by the late 1840 f s was reduced to one-seventh of the total .
But the competition of the northern route was not the only reason for this
decline. In their exports the merchants of the south were also faced with
obstacles. The restrictions and high tariffs imposed by the British in India,
particularly with regard to the imports of opium, tobacco and wool, also highly
affected this trade. Abbott emphasises that 'if some of the few exportable
productions which Persia possesses continue to be prohibited as returns for what
she takes from India, there is no doubt that increased difficulties will attend
the future prosecution of the trade; indeed they are already beginning to be
experienced without any other cause being assignable, than the gradual exhaustion

of the country under the partial state of commercial restriction abroad, and
the continual drain upon her of the precious metals' .
The volume of the Basra-Baghdad

trade with cities in western and central
Iran, seems also to have been affected by similar crises. In addition to the
frequent Ottoman attempts to redirect commercial vessels to harbour in the
Ottoman port of Basra rather than Muhammara, the insecurity on the western
frontiers and the additional custom duty levied by the Baghdad pashalik on

exports to Iran , made it difficult for Persian merchants to operate successfully

on this route . Writing in 1843, Edward Burgess states that the Baghdad route
is more competitive than any other trade route to Persia, yet due to a variety
of obstacles such as the 'disturbed state of the Arab tribes' which made the
river navigation 'dangerous and uncertain', and disturbed frontiers between

Iraq Arab and Persia, it is very doubtful whether this trade can survive 4 .

On the other hand, the long lasting border dispute between the Persian and
Ottoman governments frequently brought difficulties for Persian merchants
active on this route, and had the effect of disrupting the normal flow of
imports and exports. In addition, the Ottoman authorities lost no opportunity
to exert a 'forcible interruption in the commerce of Muhammara' , which served
as a better alternative to Basra for the Persian merchants.
Some evidence of the difficulties created by this deterioration in Ottoman-
Persian relation can be deduced from the correspondence of Manuchihr Khan
Mu'tamid al-Daulih. In March 1845, Manuchihr Khan Mu tamid al-Daulih, by then
the governor of Isfahan, Luristan and Khuzistan, reports to Tehran that as a
result of the recent Ottoman attack oa Muhammara, about 200,000 tumans worth
of merchandise belonging to Persian merchants established in Iraq     Arab and
Kirmanshah was damaged and lost . Shortly afterwards, in another report,
Manuchihr Khan strongly objects to the measure taken by the Ottoman fleet in

preventing the entry of commercial vessels to the port of Muhammara and
forcibly redirecting them instead to Basra 1 .
In Baghdad itself, the unjust treatment of the Persian tujjar by Ottoman
authorities put an extra burden on the shoulders of those who were already
suffering from the insecurity of the roads on both sides of the border. The
negligence of the Persian representative in Baghdad, and the inability of the
Persian government to raise the matter with the Ottomans, made the Persian tujjar
even more susceptible to external pressures and fluctuations       . Rawlinson,
the British Consul in Baghdad reports: 'A strong feeling of dissatisfaction has
long prevailed among the numerous and wealthy Persian community of Baghdad at
the conduct of their national representative at this court. They allege
apparently with reason, that he is devoid of the local weight or influence
necessary for the due vindication of the interest committed to his charge 1 2 .

The trade of northern and northwestern Iran, however, enjoyed greater
prosperity. Thanks to the flourishing Russian trade through the ports of the
Caspian, Iranian merchants as far inside as Kashan and Isfahan could export their
products to Russia. The conclusion of the treaties of Gulistan and Turkamanchay
gave great advantages to Russia, but it was only some time later that the long-
term effects were felt in Perso-Russian trade. By the late 1830's and early
1840's an increase had occurred in the volume of Russian trade 3 .

More significantly, the reopening of the Tabriz-Trebizond route in the mid-
1830*s made the volume of the European imports soon grow to a higher level 4 .

Yet irregularities in the price of imported goods , and the arrival of European
entrepreneurs such as a colony of Greeks in Tabriz acting as agents and factors
to the European manufacturers, created some unexpected threats to the Persian
tujjar and local traders who more than anything feared a complete takeover by
their privileged rivals. This resulted in a series of futile protests by the
Persian merchants, and subsequently the ruination and bankruptcy of many local
traders in the early years of the 1840's 2 .

Other economic matters also contributed to the crisis. The constant drain
of precious metals and the scarcity of money which prevailed as a result, the
rapid fall in the value of the tuman, a sharp rise in prices which caused
serious inflation, the gradual accumulation of a vast deficit in the balance of
payments, the decrease in the international demand for certain Persian exports,
the exaction of new limitations on Persian exports by neighbouring countries and
the first real signs of the implementation of the Anglo-Iranian commercial
treaty of 1841 which provided great commercial advantages for British subjects
and their proteges, should all be regarded as deleterious effects of western
commercial domination on a fragile traditional economy 3 .

The amount of pressure exerted upon the economy particularly in the section
of local manufacturers, craftsmen and those local merchants involved in the
distribution and export of local products which more than any other section
suffered from these abrupt changes, can be observed in the highly vulnerable
textile industry. From the early 1830's, to the end of Fath ^Ali Shah's reign,
owing to the increased consumption of European goods, production of all sorts
of cloths declined in the local weaving centres. A considerable number of
cotton weaving workshops in the industrial cities of central Iran such as
Isfahan and Kashan, which had been prosperous in the earlier years of the
century, were completely ruined. The introduction of a Russian regulation
prohibiting the entry of silk piece goods into the Caucasus provinces also
contributed to the collapse of silk weaving and the subsequent disappearance of

a large number of silk weaving workshops (sha'rbafi) and other workshops
dependent on their exports to southern Russia .

By the mid-1840's, the effect of this decline was felt by local manu­
facturers and distributors. The merchants of Kashan and Isfahan, who like their
colleagues in Shiraz, Yazd or Tabriz had been alarmed by the prospects of total
bankruptcy and loss of business, could do little more than express their dis­
content in the form of petitions and delegations to the authorities who were
either utterly unsympathetic to their cause or else incapable of any effective
assistance. The Consul Abbott's dispatch in" March 1845 is one of the many
reports of the period which illustrates the unsuccessful attempts of Persian
merchants and manufacturers to resist foreign superiority:

From the 1830*s onwards, most of the European observers who travelled to
central Iran noticed the sharp decline in the textile industry. Eugene Flandin,
who passed through Kashan in 1841, maintains that: 'Si quelques metiers y
existent encore, il est triste d'en voir le plus grand nombre immobiles, en
attendant qu'ils disparaissent completement' 2 . He states that the devastating
effects of European competition, then so clearly visible in centres like Kashan,
were not solely the outcome of the incompatible prices or the low cost of the
British products, but were also largely due to the deliberate trade policy of
the British government 3 .

Yet, in addition to the above mentioned obstacles, the unfavourable effects
of which were often beyond the power of the mercantile community to minimise,
there were other elements which, to a lesser extent, accelerated the process of
this decline. A change in the fashion, particularly amongst the Qajar women and
their courtiers, had a major effect in the production of luxurious piece cloths.
Comte de Sercey, who visited Kashan in 1840, maintains, in agreement with Abbott's
remark: 'Depuis quelques annees ces fabriques ont beaucoup perdu par la cherte
de leurs produits et I'usage que le Roi actuel a etabli de ne se servir que de
drap et d'etoffe commune. Les tissus si celebres autrefois et si pompeux ne se
fabriquent presque plus que pour les circonstances exceptionnelles* 4 .

At a time when the production of cotton fabrics was hampered by foreign
competition, the legal prohibition on the use of pure silk dresses in Shi i
fiqh also prevented manufacturers from turning to silk weaving as their major
product in the home market. It was sometime later, during the first years of
the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah that the vigorous patronage of the Amir Kabir..

encouraged the manufacturers of Kashan to overcome the religious restriction
by introducing new types of mixed silk-cotton fabrics known as qadak and qa±rii .

Thus the bulk of manufacturers and distributors in Kashan and Isfahan, who
were heavily dependent on the sales of their products at home and abroad, came
under pressure to adapt themselves to the new conditions. The critical years
of the 1840 f s witnessed a shift in the activities of Persian merchants, while
some of them managed to stay in business by turning to other fields, others
went bankrupt^ and simply withdrew from trade altogether.

The brief survey of trade and local manufactures in the middle decades of
the 19th century more than anything would indicate three major features: decline
in the level of local manufactures, decline in the export of some products and
a change in the pattern of trade which is particularly distinctive in the
diversion of imports from south to north-west. The pressure of this transitional
period was particularly felt in the section of textiles amongst both manu­
facturers and exporters.

These changes no doubt must have affected the Shaykhi-Babi merchants as it
affected other merchants in general. But as far as the existence of any
explicit correlation between the emergence of messianic movements and the
deterioration in the economy is concerned, hardly any outright conclusion can
be drawn beyond the acknowledgement of this general effect. Indeed this
correlation is more subtle and complex than what has sometimes been implied by
some scholars. Religious devotion and adherence to a messianic saviour was
much deeper than can be simply interpreted as the manifestation of economic
dissatisfactions.

In spite of the severity of these economic changes, many of the Babi
merchants remained in business. The Farhadis and the Kashani brothers continued
their trade throughout the 1840's and onwards almost independently of their
Babi commitments. In most cases the reduction in the volume of the'trade or
total abandonment was an action resulting from religious commitment rather than
any other reason. In fact the Nahris and many like them who abandoned their

1\.   Glimpses of Life and Manners in Persia, op.cit., additional notes (by
Col. Sheil), Note H., p.378 cf. Adamiyat, AnrCr KabZr op.cit. pp.386-8.

trade, though affected by the economic climate, still possessed land and
property which would cushion them against fluctuations in trade. Even local

--T Qazvini  T-lf                 -          2
merchants such as Haji  Nasir          and 'Abd al-Majid Nishaburi , who

temporarily abandoned their trade and participated in Tabarsi,  in spite of their

harrowing experience during the upheaval, after their return to their home towns
resumed their trade for some years, though on a much reduced scale, before
being again persecuted and finally killed because of their Babi commitment .

Thus by and large if there was any effect on the movement from the economic
environment, it was on the outlook of the merchants rather than being any
conscious and direct action against socio-economic disadvantages and reversals.
The attraction towards messianic ideals occurred when there was a sense of
criticism, if not resentment and contempt for material activities and the
predominance of worldly issues in their lives. Although this did not necessarily
mean that in principle they were turning away from the respected practice of
trade, there were nevertheless moral and even ethical questions which created
an uneasy       contradiction for them and, as a result, attracted some of the
new generation of merchants towards Shaykhi, Sufi and similar spiritual
teachings, and eventually led them towards the recognition of a figure which
represented for them the achievement of a state of unworldliness and sanctity.
It was this contradiction between the time-honoured values of their profession
and the urge for unworldliness and salvation which reflects the economic changes
and disruptions which at the same time were taking place around them.

CHAPTER EIGHT

The Babis of Khurasan

The previous chapters of this study attempted to give an account of events
and activities in the early stages of the movement, in order to explain the
diffusion of the Babi cause amongst various groups and communities in the cities
of central Iran. In this chapter, however, attention is focused on Khurasan and
its Babi community. Indeed, this community may be taken as an example of many
other communities which were formed in the course of the first decade after the
emergence of the movement in other parts of Iran. The significance of Khurasan,
in terms both of the number of the Babi adherents and of their contribution to
the formation and development of the movement, calls for closer examination.
Furthermore, the geographical distribution of the Khurasanl Babis in this
province, and certain features of their social and religious background, make
this community particularly appropriate for a case study.

Between 1260 and 1264 (1844-8) the main concentration of the Khurasani
Babis was in three areas. First, in central Khurasan - in the area known as
Quhistan, on the edge of the highlands which surround the Khurasan desert .

in Iran . Secondly, on the north-western side of the borderlands of Mazandaran

particularly on the northern route to Khurasan in Bastam, Mayamay and Biyarjmand
there were also sizeable Babi communities. Thirdly, in cities such as Mashhad,
Sabzivar and Nishabur there were a number of converts with purely urban back­
grounds. As far as can be ascertained from the sources, in terms of occupations
and economic activities the Babi community in Khurasan also represents a cross
section of society. A large group of the 'ulama with rural backgrounds,
together with small landowners, local merchants and manufacturers and a few of
the local state officials, formed the backbone of this community .

Prior to the study of the Babis of Khurasan some attempt should be made to
look at the social and economic life of the province in the light of the events
and upheavals which shaped the history of Khurasan in the decades prior to the
emergence of the Babi movement. This survey needs to be carried out in order
to examine whether there was any tangible relationship between the general
pattern of change in Khurasan and the later spread of the Babi movement. Such
an investigation has some significance since it helps to verify theories which
have been put forward to explain the emergence of millenarian movements purely
in terms of political and economic processes.

From the political point of view, in the closing decades of the 18th and
the first two decades of the 19th century the province of Khurasan remained
largely independent from the rest of the country. The gradual decline in the
power of the Afshar princes, and the increase in the mobility and power of
tribal forces in the province, led to the formation of a semi-independent tribal
confederation which dominated central and southern Khurasan almost up to the end
of the 1820*s, before being finally crushed and subordinated by the Qajar central
government 2 . In this period of tribal domination, in spite of some disturbances
which occurred in the complex pattern of nomadic settlements, largely because
of some tribal movements and dislocations, and in spite of some territorial
clashes and skirmishes between local chiefs, a relative degree of tranquillity
and economic prosperity existed under the protection of powerful chiefs such as

Shah tried to assert further its authority beyond the Mashhad region in the late
1820's and early 1830's, particularly during Abbas Mirza's Khurasan campaign
(1830-3), the whole of central Khurasan went through a phase of insecurity and
unrest. In this transitory period, the limited prosperity and calm seem to
have gradually diminished as the inhabitants of towns and villages suffered
from army mobilisations, inter-tribal conflicts, sieges and the retaliatory
raids of rebellious tribes. Such elements not only directly affected the life
of the area but also weakened the tribal defence structure, and thus left the
way clear for the increased incursions of Turkomans, Hazarihs and other tribes
of the north and north-west 2 .

Yet despite the hardships of this period, a decade later, by the time the
Qajars had finally managed to maintain, at least temporarily, control over the
province in the late 1830's and early 1840's, it seems that a limited improve­
ment occurred in the overall state of towns and cities which lasted up to the
next major uprising in the province (1848-50) and the subsequent campaign of
the central government, this time against the rebellious Salar and his brothers,
sons of Asif         .3 . This brief interlude, however temporary,

due to the political stability under the capable Governor General Asif al-Daulih,

(who had been appointed in 1833/1249 Q. in cooperation with his son, Salar) and
partly to the tacit reconciliation with the local tribes which was mainly due
to Asif

al-Daulih's wish to establish an independent power base and further his
aims for advancement in the central administration.

Joseph Wolff, who visited Khurasan for the second time in 1844, states:
'the change for the better I have met with in Khorassaun, since the time I was
here in 1831, is surprising - a proof of what a well-regulated government is
able to effect; for it is evidently now better governed by the king and his
lord-lieutenant than it was under those tyrannical khans, who have been success­
fully exterminated in the most wonderful manner* . Later, in 1845, Ferrier
also noticed that at least in western and central Khurasan, in spite of all the
miseries which had left their seal on the whole province, signs of relief had
yet emerged in the cities and their surroundings. Sabzivar is described as a
town 'full of life', which is the centre of 'a rich district'; 'in its environs
are handsome villages and well-cultivated land which stretches beyond the
horizon, a sight of rare occurrence in Persia. It was the first time I had
witnessed such a scene, and this is the best proof of the efficient and
benevolent rule of the governor-general Assaf Doulet' 2 . Further eastward, in
the town of Nishabur, since 'the citadel is in ruins ... it may be readily
imagined the country in this environs has suffered in proportion; but the
villages and the cultivation which still remain sufficiently prove that not
even all this misery could induce the population wholly to retire from this
valley, for in no other part of Persia would they have found such another
fertile spot' 3 .

The comparative improvement in the affairs of the province in the early
1840's is also evident in Mashhad's regaining its function as a centre for a
flourishing trade between central and southern Persia and Central Asia. Imports

of manufactured goods as well as a variety of the local products of the Khurasan
province were exchanged with the raw materials and nomadic products of Central
Asia in the retail shops and caravanaserais of Mashhad . Products of high
quality textiles such as Mashhadi carpets, shawls, light silk goods and other
traditional crafts, provided a brisk market for the merchant investors who
imported the raw materials, used the cheap labour, and sold the finished

products with a large profit . The considerable volume of trade, revitalisation
of traditional industries, constant flow of labourers and pilgrims, revenues
from religious endowments and donations to the Shrine, construction of new
premises, and a gradual improvement in the state of the fields and orchards in
the hinterland brought some degree of prosperity to the inhabitants of the city.
In fact Ferrier's picture of Mashhad in 1845 differs considerably from Eraser f s

description of insecurity and economic decline in 1833 .

Further south of Mashhad, the extensive ruins of former villages,
caravanserais and fortresses were still the significant features of the land-

scape . Yet in the meantime, the signs of improvements in the form of f well
inhabited' villages , or 'fertile districts which produce a handsome revenue
to the Governor-General of Khorassan' , are observable. It was no coincidence that
new villages reappeared near the ruins of the old fortresses,as had always been
the case in the past. It appears that in these years, the depopulation of
central and southern Khurasan was partly compensated for by the arrival of
newcomers. Ferrier notices that the town of Shahr Nau and its environs near
the ruins of the once important fortress of Mahmudabad,

in the east of Turbat-i
Haydariyih, 'is inhabited by 2000 families of Hazarahs, who have recently
emigrated from Harat to Persia' . The village Kariz, next to the ruins of the
fort of (Abbasabad, once a well known refuge for the rebellious tribal chiefs,
'has recently been repeopled by Hazarahs ...' .

But it appears that the change in the population pattern was not wholly due
to the movements of eastern tribes. Other motives also accelerated the process
of repopulation. The continuous immigration of the Shi^i's of Herat, who were

under the persecution of their Sunni Afghan rulers, was not a new feature in
Khurasan.  However, during and after Muhammad Shah's campaign in 1837-8, the

_ •                            /•
mounting hostility of the ruling Afghans towards the pro-Persian Shi i
population sharply increased the number of Herati refugees. At the time of
the Qajar retreat, more than 30,000 Shi/i refugees of the city and district of
Herat, who were afraid of Afghan retaliation, accompanied the Qajar forces back
into Iran, and mostly settled in the towns and villages of Khurasan 2 . Not only
the Herati immigrants but refugees and immigrants from other neighbouring towns
and provinces were attracted to centres such as Mashhad. Ferrier, reckoning
the population of Mashhad, states: 'Since the immigration of the population of
Marv and Sharaks (Sarakhs), Herat and Kandahar, the number of resident
inhabitants may be fixed at 60,000 and 30,000 pilgrims and strangers ...' 3 .

However the arrival of the newcomers was not always welcomed by the
inhabitants of Khurasan. The expansion of the Hazarih, or the other tribes of
the Chahar Uymaq for instance, who because of the increase in their population
were obliged to divide and migrate 4 , was not always a peaceful process. The
raids of some of the unsettled Hazarih, who plundered villages and caravans,
were by no means less destructive than those of the Turkomans, who by now
extended further south as far as the district of Qa'in, where they 'sacked
villages and carried off the people to sell them to the Usbeks' . Under the
Asif al-Daulih, measures were taken to come to some reconciliation with local

tribes, yet the government's successive efforts from 1837 onwards, to punish
the rebellious Uymaqat or Turkomans in parts of the exterior of Khurasan, did
not have any decisive result . Nevertheless, the relative security in the less
afflicted parts provided a more tolerable life for the inhabitants.

In the interior of Khurasan, which,because of its climatic and geographical
features, offered a small volume of agricultural surplus, the inhabitants
usually allocated part of their cultivated lands to more valuable crops such as
cotton, silk and opium. This was traditionally accompanied by the use of small
scale industries as an additional source of income for these communities.     The
production of wool from the camels and flocks of sheep of the local tribes,
particularly around Tun, Tabas, Siryan and other southern towns , and the

the provincial government was effective enough to maintain some security on the
roads so as to allow the agricultural and finished products to reach the markets
of centres such as Mashhad and Yazd . Other small industries and crafts such

The output of these local industries was obviously small and not significant
by modern standards, yet within a traditional framework, village industry and
trade attracted the peasantry, primarily no doubt the surplus population.    The
case of Mulla Husain's own family illustrates a combination between agriculture
and local industry. Originally from a hamlet near Bushruyih 1 , his father Mulla
^Abdallah, who seems to have been a small land-owner, moved to the town of
Bushruyih, where as part of the local weaving industry, he ran a dye-house
(sabbaghi,) with a number of apprentices , while still maintaining his agri-
cultural holdings in the neighbourhood.

Small semi-industrial and commercial communities which were sometimes
entirely dependent on their trade and handicrafts, are discernible in some of
the contemporary accounts. Dr. Forbes, for instance, notices the weaving
communities in the districts of central and southern Khurasan. In the village

- -          _ _                                           3

of Deluvi, near Gunabad, 'the bulk of the population are weavers 1 , while in
Birjand 'since Harat began to be in a disturbed state some years ago, many of
the carpet weavers emigrated from it to this place, and carpets of a good quality
are now manufactured here, both by them and by the workmen of Birjan (Birjand)' .

The frequent movements of merchants from main centres such as Yazd and
Kandahar indicate the volume of trade in the local markets. In Tun, Ferrier
notices that due to the production of a variety of crops, 'there is a
considerable commercial movement' , while because of the light corn crops, 'in
years of drought, wheat for consumption is obliged to be imported' . In Tabas,
the export of market products was also great, and 'a large number of the
population of Tubbus (labas) are by occupation caravaneers ,8

Thus the limited improvement in the political affairs of the province
between the mid-1830's and mid-1840's, and the relative calm and tranquillity in
the countryside helped the revival of the economy in these semi-agricultural
communities. Safer communication with the market towns and cities again allowed
greater mobility, particularly for those groups who, either because of their
role in the process of production, or for religious purposes, were in closer
contact with the urban centres. It is worth noticing that by this time, the
effects of imports from the west were less felt by the manufacturers and crafts-

men of eastern Iran who contrary to their counterparts in western and central
Iran, were still playing a much more important role in the economy of the region,
But nevertheless this favourable atmosphere could hardly diminish the fear of an
outside threat.  As has already been noted, the end of tribal autonomy and
greater centralisation under the Qajars did not solve the problem of security
for these fragile and highly vulnerable communities.

Indeed the question of security long produced all types of responses from
the people who could not turn to anyone but themselves to ensure their own
safety. In the early decades of the 19th century in the villages of Quhistan,
as Macdonald Kinner describes, 'the inhabitants, in constant fear of being
attacked, never go unarmed. They even cultivate their gardens with their swords
by their sides... 1 . Methods of defence, however primitive, ineffective and
spontaneous, were adopted to safeguard lives and properties against enemies.
For example, Fraser noted that in 1833, during the Qajar campaign, when the
fields in the outskirts of Khabushan were plundered or set on fire by government

troops, the Khurasani peasants took their revenge by killing a few soldiers .
Other ways of negative resistance were also adopted by the villagers who simply
absented themselves in order to conceal their supplies of food and livestock 3 .

In the cities, however, these defensive measures in the form of popular
protests seem to have taken more complex forms. Because of the higher population
concentration, better organised resistance, the involvement of the lutis as well
as the local notables, the challenge was far more severe. Ferrier, visiting
Mashhad in 1845, during the events leading up to the Salar rebellion, witnessed
a full scale battle in the streets of the city between 'the soldiers of the
battalion of Kurds of the tribe of Guran 1 garrisoned in the city, 'and the
inhabitants of the town, who have the reputation of being the most war-like
citizens of Persia', which lasted for a few days 4 . These attempts at resistance,
however genuine in expressing the people's discontent, were often manipulated
to serve the centrifugal tendencies in Khurasan, which were usually represented

by the joint forces of the tribal chiefs and the local notables. On the eve of
the Salar rebellion, a dispute between the central government and provincial
notables led to a series of violent clashes, assassinations and faction fighting
amongst the urban elite, which subsequently provoked riots in the city of
Mashhad .

The nature of these conflicts is well illustrated in the Mashhad rebellion
of 1264/1848 which was the culmination of a long series of power struggles
during the past few years between pro- and anti-Qajar officials. In Ramadan of
that year, a crowd of Mashhadi people, headed by the baglarbaygi of Mashhad,
backed by the ex-governor of Khurasan Salar, and led by the lutis, some of the
anti-government fulama and some representatives of the merchant community, rose
against the local government . In a bloody riot, they slaughtered the mutavalli
of the Shrine and the darughih of the city, took all the strategic positions,
massacred more than seven hundred troops and government officials, and finally
after taking over control of the whole city, proceeded towards the citadel.
There, not only the Mashhadi citizens, but also the forces of the peasantry of
the region from up to ten farsakh's distance including Bulukat and Qara'i, joined
the crowd in their fight against the troops 3 . After a long period of fighting,
it took the central government three months, and the lives of 2000 Mashhadis, to
suppress the rebellion, and re-establish central authority 4 .

Summing up the motives behind the Mashhad rebellion, even a pro-Qajar
chronicle like Nasikh al-TGwarikh is obliged to acknowledge the public aversion
towards the oppressive behaviour of the Qajar forces:

> 'After the Afshar and Hamadani troops arrived at Mashhad,
> they showed insubordination by laying their hands on the
> property and belongings of the inhabitants, and committed
> such excesses, that people left their fields and crops in
> the countryside in order to protect their wives and
> children in their homes ... When troops from the camp
> entered the villages and hamlets to get provisions and
> fodder, they acted as though they were looters and
> usurpers. They looted whatever they could find. There-     ^
> fore the people of Khurasan turned wholly against them ...' .

These cases of popular revolt may perhaps be regarded as signs of a partial
social awareness, which existed particularly amongst the poorer sections of the
urban population.   The available sources only provide brief references to the
outlook of the ordinary people at the time.   Yet it is possible to perceive
the hazy image of a spirit of social awareness, not only amongst the ordinary
inhabitants of the towns and villages of Khurasan , but also amongst the lower
ranks of the 'ulama class, who more than the mujtahids of higher rank   were in
contact with the poorer and less privileged sections of society.

In the earlier decades of-the 19th century, because of the isolation of
Khurasan and the exceptional political circumstances which prevailed over the
province, the high ranking ''ulama had performed a decisive role in leading the
public and protecting the interests of the inhabitants of the cities in the
conflict between the central government and the semi-autonomous powers. One
example is Sayyid Muhammad Mahdl Mujtahid Mashhadi who, in 1217 (1802), as

representative of the people of Mashhad, took sides with the Qajars against the
declining Afsharids, and facilitated the entrance of their forces to the city -
an assistance which cost him his life. Shortly before the final victory of
the Qajars he was killed at the hands of Nadir Sultan the Afshar prince .

In the decades after his death, the    religious  authority in the province
largely remained in the control1 of his family. Both his brothers, Haji Mirza-yi
^Asgari the imam jum^ih of Mashhad and Mirza Hashim Mujtahid were amongst the

most influential mujtahids of the city . But nevertheless influence over the

public and involvement in the political affairs of the province seem to have
been employed by them more to protect their own private interests than those
of the people. This is particularly highlighted in the above mentioned riots
and disturbances in Mashhad. Indeed the trusteeship and control of the endow­
ments of the Shrine of Imam Riza were always a source of dispute between the
government appointed mutavalli and the mujtahids of the city.

In 1263 (1847) the appointment of rmtavallibashi Mirza ^Abdallah Khu'i by
Haji Mirza Aqasi renewed these disputes. A coalition which was formed between
Mirza-yi ^Asgari and the rebellious Salar against the new mutavalli in cooper­
ation with other local notables, merchants, tribal chiefs and some of the
government officials, was primarily designed to drive the mutavalli out of
office and regain control of the Shrine's endowments which were previously in
the hands of Asif al-Daulih . However involvement in the death of the mutavalli

temporarily endangered the position of Mirza-yi ''Asgari who was already under
suspicion for his cooperation with the British in the episode of the Herat
campaign (1837-8). He was summoned to the capital and there he was detained
till the end of Muhammad Shah's life . Just before his departure, at his
meeting with Dr. Wolff, Mirza-yi 'Asgari pointed out: 'I was suspected by
Muhammad Shah to be partial to England, and he therefore invited me to appear
at Tehran. I obeyed the summons, but I could drive out the Kajar (Qajars) from
Mashhad whenever I please' 3 . Indeed to safeguard his interests it appears that
^Asgari was prepared to use whatever he had at his disposal to diminish the power
of his rivals. On one occasion he was even prepared to support a preacher in
Mashhad who propagated the futility of pilgrimage, perhaps only to ch_ck the
power of the mutavalli who depended on the alms and contributions of the pilgrims ,

But if Mirza-yi ^Asgari and other leading mujtahids like him were able to
maintain high positions and obtain a large degree of influence in the affairs
of the city, this was primarily due to the loyalty to them which was shown by
the public in general and by the mullas and religious students in particular.
In the middle decades of the 19th century, however, this loyalty seems to have
been questioned by some of the mullas and religious students who, although

brought up in Mashhad's religious schools under orthodox mujtahids, were gradually
attracted towards non-orthodox trends. These were mainly students who came
either from low rank ^ulama families, or more often from the families of local
merchants and traders, the small landowners and occasionally artisans and asnaf
of the small towns and cities of Khurasan 1 . They were the best of the students
in the local schools who came to the cities like Mashhad to seek a new career
beyond the horizon of their native community. From villages to small towns,
then to provincial centres and finally to the main centres of learning in Iraq:
these were the successive stages of a long and selective course, which only a
tiny minority was able to accomplish. Beside the traditional merits of religious
studies, the quest for further knowledge, as far as the tullab of these local
schools were concerned, was a sensible alternative to the stagnant, insecure and
highly dependent life of the village. It was an accessible means of social
mobility for under-privileged groups, by means of which they might compensate
for or even supersede the advantages of power, wealth and family esteem. Though
the material position of a talabih, if not worse, was certainly not better than

that of most of the people, yet his social status as a seeker of knowledge put
him above the ordinary man in the community. After years of laborious and often
dedicated work, when the majority of these newly qualified ^ulama returned to
their home towns and villages, they had already secured a prominent position
in the community. Moreover, their involvement in the local mosques or madrasih,
however insignificant it may seem, could offer them a fair chance of advancement
in society.
It appears that some of the local tullab, who were born and bred in central
Khurasan, and later proceeded with their higher education in the provincial
centres, having passed through the customary steps in the course of their studies,
experienced the austerity and seclusion of the madrasih, were later able, when
they returned to their home towns, to enjoy the same venerated position in local
communities. Yet, it seems that under the given conditions, they also undertook
the delicate role of popular leadership of the oppressed inhabitants of the
semi-urban communities. As will be discussed, some attitudes amongst this
section of young mullas and tullab, though by no means unprecedented in
religious circles, may still be regarded as the indirect outcome of urban social
groupings in Khurasan! society. Groups of urbanised villagers, small landowners,
local retailers, small-scale craftsmen and low ranking clergy were brought up
in an environment which, despite improvements of late 1830 f s and early 1840's,

1\.   See below

still bore the marks of chronic unrest, frequent wars, tribal incursions,
oppressive rulers, and changes in the economic climate, that had been character­
istic of the earlier decades of the 19th century.

Their common social background was a positive factor in attracting the
lower ranking ulama towards a theological school such as Shaykhism which,
because of its popular and millenarian characteristics, held considerable appeal
for those from central Khurasan who perhaps had in their background some distant
traces of earlier messianic beliefs. It is noteworthy that traditionally
Quhistan was one of the two major Isma ili strongholds in the middle ages. After
the fall of Alamut and the destruction of the Isma ili strongholds in the 13th
century, the influence of the Isma ilis remained in Quhistan and occasionally
re-emerged in the form of crypto-Isma ili movements. Many of the villages in the
Quhistan area as far north as Nishabur but particularly in the region around
Turbat-i Haydariyih, Turshiz, Tabas, Qa'in and as far south as Shahr-i Babak and

•                    •       _r_ _
Kirman which have either held open Isma ili beliefs or preserved signs of an
Isma'ili past up to the present time, testify to the extent of this influence .

The rise of the Isma'ili Imams from their previous obscurity and their
involvement in the political life in the second half of the 18th century, which
is highlighted in the episode of Imam Abul Hasan Shah in Kirman (1756-1791/2)
and later the abortive attempts of Shah Khalilallah in Yazd (1817) and the
revolt of Aqa Khan (1843) confirm that there was some revival of the Isma ili
communities . Furthermore, Mirza 'Abd al-Husain Fayz 'Ali Shah, one of the most
important advocates of the Ni ''matallahi order in its revival in the late 18th
century, who was previously the imam jum ih of Tabas, seems to have come from

— — —           ^                        *
an Isma ''ili background . However the extent of this revival should not be
exaggerated, since there is no evidence to suggest that there was any direct
Isma ^ ili element in the background of the characters who were involved in the
Babi movement. Perhaps it is only possible to say that the Isma'ili ideas and
beliefs which had survived in the area in oral or written form might have
contributed to the emergence of a spirit of messianism amongst those who later
joined the Babi movement.

The influence of Shaykhi teachings on the other hand, which by the mid-19th
century had penetrated the religious circles of eastern Iran, seems to have

contributed to this sense of millenarianism more than anything else. It appears
that Shaykh Ahmad's long residence in Yazd, then a prosperous trade centre and
hence a centre for Khurasani tullab, attracted the first serious attention
towards Shaykhi ideas . According to his son Shaykh Abdallah, at the time of
Shaykh Ahmad's residence in Yazd (1223-28/1808-13), 'the cause of his reverence
was disseminated in the towns, and publicised in the provinces. All ulama and
scholars expressed their submission, and sent their problems to him. In reply
he wrote treatises in which he revealed the mysteries suitable to their capacity,
and publicised moral virtues as much as people could tolerate, till the fame of
his knowledge and his virtues reached everywhere' 2 .
Later in 1236 Q. (1820-1), he visited small cities such as Tabas and
Turbat-i Haydariyih on his way from Mashhad to Yazd, and he was warmly received
by the inhabitants, including the renowned chief of the Qara'is, Muhammad Khan,
son of Ishaq Khan . This visit had laid the foundation for the later conversion
of tullab
•         to the Shaykhi school. Many of the tullab and mujtahids, who later joined
the ranks of the Babis, appear to have been first attracted to the Shaykhi
doctrine while they were in the schools of Yazd and Mashhad . In contrast to
the established orthodoxy, Shaykhism, and especially its later messianic
interpretations, implied new scope for changes for a better and more just society
under the guidance of the Imam of the Age. Indeed the influence of the Shaykhi
school in Khurasan can be better understood in the light of the intellectual
climate in Mashhad in the early decades of the nineteenth century which by
comparison with religious centres such as Isfahan and Atabat, was less
dominated by the new generation of the Usuli fuqaha and hence better allowed
the spread of other less orthodox tendencies. The attraction of students such
as Mulla ^Abd al-Khaliq Yazdi to Shaykh Ahmad's circle in Yazd was due to this
very fact 5 .

The diffusion of messianic beliefs, more than anything else, prepared the
ground for the arrival of popular figures, in most cases bearing some contro­
versial and often undeveloped claims for reform which were in contrast with the

views of the established orthodoxy. In September 1844, during his short abode
in Mashhad, Dr. Wolff, who because of his own millennarian beliefs often paid
some attention to the religious affairs of the country, noticed the appearance
of a new schism in the city:

> 'It is remarkable that dissenters in doctrine are now
> prevailing largely in the Muhammedan religion. The
> controversy which agitates now the Christian Church,
> with regard to the usefulness of ceremonies and tradition,
> agitates now also the Muhammedan community. A Sayed
> (i.e. Sayyid) at Mashhad began to teach that the Koran
> was quite enough, and pilgrimages unnecessary. This, in
> the great city of Imaum Resa (Imam RizI) was extraordinary
> doctrine ... A strong cry of heresy was raised against
> the Sayed, but Mirza Askeree (Mirza-yi Asgari) protected
> him. A fierce schism now prevails among the Sheahs
> (Shi r is) at Mashed' 1 .

This brief but important passage, if not a vague reference to the Babis,
who at the time had just started their activities in the province, may be counted
as justifiable evidence to show the existence, of fundamentalist and perhaps even
messianic attitudes in the religious milieu of the time. Wolff who stresses the

'diminishing power of fanaticism' throughout Iran, seems to have noticed the
vacuum which in his view ought to have been appreciated by the Christian
missionaries. 'I was frequently asked for copies of the Bible; and in the cities
of Semnan (Simnan), Damghan (Damghan), Nishapoor (Nishabur) and Mashed (Mashhad),
I was invited to open discussions about religion with the chief Mullahs ...
Writings published against Muhammedanism by the late missionary, Mr. Pfander

are read at Mashed and Nishapoor with eagerness' .

However, in view of his eccentric zealousness, Wolff's remarks on religious
controversies in the province are not entirely reliable. Yet, it is fair to
assume that a considerable amount of religious tension between rival factions
paved the way for anti-orthodox claims to be heard not only by the public, but

also to receive the blessing of the anti-government mujtahids . This was perhaps
an indication of a growing tendency amongst the ordinary people to be attracted

towards low ranking mullas and sayyids who preached certain reformistic
missions   .

The conversion of the first Babis in Khurasan was due, more than anything,
to the efforts of Mulla Husain Bushruyihi and a handful of his close Babi ex-
school associates who, in their travels to various parts of Khurasan in the
first four years of the movement, by converting a number of individuals in
various towns and villages, founded the basis of the Babi community. Beside
Mulla Husain and Mulla ''Ali Bastami, there were other Khurasanis amongst the
early believers of Shiraz. Mulla Muhammad Hasan, Mulla Husain's brother, and

••          _                    *      *             *
Mulla Muhammad
Baqir his nephew,  both accompanied
"

him on   most of his journeys.
Also Mulla Hasan Bajistani and Mulla Khuda Bakhsh Quchani were amongst the

Letters of Hayy, but their role in the expansion of the movement was far less

significant than that of Mulla Husain.
Mulla Husain must have reached Mashhad some time in late Sha ban 1260

(September 1844). He stopped en route in some cities and passed on his message
to a number of 'trusted' people who seem to have had connections with him because
of previous Shaykhi links. In the later months of 1260, he was residing in
Mashhad, where he established contacts with the Shaykhi followers and
sympathisers. It was here that in collaboration with Mulla Muhammad Baqir
Qa'ini he founded the first centre for the Babi teaching known as Babiyih.
Originally a small house in the region of Bala Khiyaban belonging to Mulla
Muhammad Baqir Qa'ini, it was the residence of Mulla Husain during his visits to

t                                                  •
Mashhad. It became a centre for Mulla Husain's teaching, a place for frequent
gatherings, the abode of the Babi disciples in the city, and the focal point for
all activities in Khurasan. The role of the Babiyih in the early development of
the community of Khurasan is considerable. In the later years of the movement
it was from here that the first recruitment was made for the march to Mazandaran ,

1\.   See above Chapter One.
2\.   Ndbil. pp.126-7, Fu'adZ. p£.48-9- In the summer of 1264 (1848), Mulla

> he gave the name of Babiyih, a name that bears to the present day f (MzHZ.
267).

According to the earlier arrangement with the Bab, Mulla Husain sent a
letter to Shiraz. In this letter, as Nabil Zarandi states, he gave a full
report of his activities at different stages of his journey. 'In it, he enclosed
a list of the names of those who had responded to his call, and of whose stead­
fastness and sincerity he was assured* . If Nabil could be relied on in this
point, it seems that, as had been planned formerly, the Bab was anxious to
examine the public response to his call, reflected in Mulla Husain f s account,
before he set out for Hijaz . Indeed the outcome of Mulla Husain 1 s mission,
particularly during his stay in Mashhad, indicates that his efforts were
generally concentrated on three major groups: 'ulama and tullab, local merchants
and a few local state officials. Although it appears that such clear
distinctions were not of prime importance in Mulla Husain's mind, and he
probably approached any person whom he found prepared for his ideas, yet in this
preliminary stage the above groups seem to have responded better to his message.
On the other hand, it must be pointed out that drawing a distinctive line
between these groups, as far as 'ulama and merchants were concerned, is some­
times difficult and even misleading.

Another difficult distinction to make is that between the urban and rural
backgrounds of Mulla Husain's early followers. Although his own personal impact
was immediately felt in Mashhad, it is important to note that the groups who
received his message most enthusiastically came from semi-rural regions of
central and north-western Khurasan. It was the middle and lower ranking 'ulama
and tullab, teaching and studying in the provincial capital, who most readily
accepted his mission. It was only to be expected that these groups in their
turn were able to have considerable influence in the propagation of these new
beliefs in their own home towns and villages. As far as can be assessed from
the available sources, in Bushruyih, Mulla Husain's home town, between 1260-64

(1844-8) more than sixty individuals firmly accepted the Babi creed. Records

may also be found of the number and usually the identity of other early Babis
in central Khurasan. In fact it is possible to count more than 57 of them:
eight in Turbat-i Haydariyih, three in Azghand, three in Abdallahabad, seven in

Mahnih, ten in Hisar  and Namiq, five in Fayzabad, two in Dughabad, three in

• «

Turshiz, nine in Qa'in (seven of them originally from Herat), two from Bajistan,
two from Tabas and one each from Tun, Kakhk and Gunabad. In the north-western

region also, thirty-two can be identified in Mayamay, five from Biyarjmand and a
few from other places. Compared to the recorded names of the Babis in other
parts of Khurasan, mostly urban centres such as Mashhad (twelve), Sabzivar
(seven), Nishabur (three) and a few in other towns, it is evident that the
greater part of the Babis was concentrated in the semi-rural towns and villages
of central Khurasan.

However it must be pointed out that the above figures most probably only
represent a section of a larger community in the area. They are based on the
names of those active Babis who are known to us because of taking part in
certain events, dying in upheavals, or suffering certain persecutions. Besides,
a substantial portion of those who are identified are the local mullas of the
small towns and villages who had the support of their local communities. Thus
it is not illogical to assume that they represented a larger Babi population in
the area, particularly in the early years when, setting aside the cases of the
learned ^ulama and tullab, it is difficult to make a clear distinction between
the converts and sympathisers amongst the ordinary people. The reference in
Tarikh-i Amri-yi Khurasan that at one stage 2000 inhabitants of Bushruyih
attended Mulla Husain's preachings and were attracted to his message, may be

taken  as   one example of this public support. Similarly the support given to
Mulla Muhammad Baqir Qa'ini in Mashhad or to Mulla Zayn al-'Abidin, the mujtahid
of Mayamay and Mulla Ahmad the mujtahid of Hisar and Namiq, who were converted

together with all their students and followers, may be mentioned .

The first and foremost group among the early believers, both in position
and number, were those who came from the ranks of the 'ulama, namely low ranking

mullas, newly authorised mujtahids and a few well established ''ulama who were
mostly assembled in Mashhad. As far as can be substantiated, they were mainly
of Shaykhi background, and already anticipated, in one way or another, what
Mulla Husain proposed in his teachings. Given the paucity of information on the
religious background of the believers, one can only go so far as to say that like
Mulla Husain, most of the tullab and ''ulama who recognised the Bab were influenced

1.   Fu'Hdl, pp.276-282.

at one stage of their studies    by   Shaykhi teachings . The cases to be
discussed below clarify the position of the Shaykhi school in the religious
environment of Mashhad in the years prior to the emergence of the movement.
No doubt strong ties between the Shaykhi students, who sometimes attended the
lectures of one or a few teachers for years and shared a similar training,
also contributed to this wide acceptance. So did the family bonds which existed
between the Babi missionaries and the inhabitants of a certain town or village.

However, it may be argued that these are only outward manifestations of a
much deeper motive behind the wide acceptance of the movement in the area. What
has been said in the earlier sections about political and economic changes may
better explain the circumstances under which such conversions took place. Of
course it would be a matter of simplicity to assume that this millenarian
concern was the direct outcome of the political and economic calamities of the
time, but nevertheless such a coincidence between the events of the recent past,
almost in the life span of most of the converts, and the wide acceptance of a
messianic belief should not be underestimated. Perhaps the key to this subtle
relationship may be found in the religious inclination towards heterodox ideas
and beliefs which by itself served as a means of defence and resistance against
the ever present pressures and threats of the outside world. With the amount
of information available in the sources it is an impossible task to try to
propose a more tangible link beyond the mere demonstration of such a coincidence,
yet the very survival of heterodox tendencies in the area and their re-emergence
in the form of Shaykhi adherence may be taken as evidence for the important part
played by religion, and particularly non-orthodox religion, in reflecting the
effects of socio-political changes in society.

What perhaps made some amongst this generation of 'ulama distinctive in
their outlook was the fact that within their own theological framework they were
able to express a tangible degree of response towards conflicts in their
environment. It is arguable to what extent they were consciously aware of the
causes of conflict, or whether such causality in the modern sense had any place
in their intellectual mould, but nonetheless they were perhaps able to trace a
pattern in the course of recent developments which was in harmony with their
eschatological expectations. Therefore it is possible to suggest that they went
beyond the accepted and often isolated image of the Shi'i 'ulama whose concern
was confined to abstract theological arguments and to the everyday affairs of

1\.   See above Chapter Four, I.

the sharf . However articulate and well-cultivated they might be, they mirrored
the aspirations and frustrations of their fellow inhabitants.

Some manifestation of this role can be seen in those individuals who are
known to have been converted to the movement during Mulla Husain's first
residence in Mashhad in 1260-1 (1844-5). The first of them, Mulla r Abd al-Khaliq
Yazdi, a leading Shaykhi mujtahid of his time, was counted amongst 'the senior
r ulama' of Khurasan . A former disciple of Ahsa'i, he studied under him
especially during his residence in Yazd in the 1230's (1810's) 2 , and even
according to Mu 1f~in al-Saltanih, was sometimes his host in that city 3 . His

for his 'eloquent oratory 1 and his 'vast knowledge', and the author of Tabaqat

A^ Icon dl-Shi'a enumerates six works by him on subjects such as the sufferings
of the Imams, usul and strange sciences (known as Risala fi 'ilm al-Masa) .

Perhaps following the example of his teacher, Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i,    his venture
into the field of sciences gave him the necessary confidence to assume a certain
authority for himself in the Shaykhi camp . After Ahsa'i's death, according to

_>        _                                       •
Nabil Zarandi, he competed against and even challenged Sayyid Kazim,    but later

/                  •

in the course of time accepted his authority .

Mulla ^Abd al-Khaliq was one of the chief defenders of the Shaykhi cause in
Iran. On one occasion, when Mulla Muhammad Ja'far Astarabadi, known as

Shari^atmadar, a notorious enemy of the Shaykhis who as a result of his
provocations had twice been physically attacked by the extreme Shaykhis, arrived

> at Mashhad, Mulla 'Abd al-Khaliq openly challenged him in a public dispute .
The extent of the controversy even reached Muhammad  Shah, who on the way back

•g
from the Herat campaign (Rajab 1254 Q./1838-9) , personally intervened in the
matter, and subsequently obliged Shari^atmadar to return to Tehran . Probably
it was in connection with the same incident that, according to Nuqtat   al-Kaf,

as a result of anti-Shaykhi propaganda, Yazdi was forbidden to preach and

Babi circle.   The importance given by the Bab to Mulla   Abd al-Khaliq's
recognition is evident not only in his correspondence with the old mujtahid, but
also in one of his letters to Muhammad Shah in 1263-4, where he designates Mulla
''Abd al-Khaliq together with Sayyid Yahya Darabi (Vahid ) as the Bab's represen-

-•- •-'               *              *
tatives, known to the Shah, to whom inquiry could be made about the truth of his

cause .
As may be concluded from Nasikh al-Tawarikh , Yazdi was amongst the first to

_                   o                —           — •—
be converted by Mulla Husain in Khurasan . But, since Nasikh al-Tawarikh some-
how treats the events of four years (1844-48/1260-64) as one incident, more
proofs must be provided in order to substantiate this claim. In a long letter

A
addressed to Mulla ''Abd al-Khaliq , the Bab in his usual imprecatory style
discussed important matters, the revelation of which, had Yazdi been an
unbeliever, would have seemed quite illogical . Further there is an important
Arabic letter by Mulla ''Abd al-Khaliq addressed to the Bab (probably in reply
to his correspondence), in which he pays homage to the Bab as 'the most exalted
remembrance of God (Dhikrallah) amongst ''Arab and ''Ajam' . He wholly
acknowledges Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad's status of Bdbiyat and points out:

> 'I do not know with what tongue I should thank God

> long time, and with what speech I should apologise

The above words were written by a mujtahid of high status but they illustrate
the degree to which the previous messianic influences could justify the truth­
fulness of the new revelation. On the other hand the significance of Mulla Abd
al-Khaliq's position may be measured from the Bab's reference in a letter in
early 1262/1846 in which he informs Yazdi of the dispatch of Mulla Husain

•'     for
the second time to Khurasan. 'Thus I dispatched by my own authority to the
"Fourth Mashhad" (Mdshhad al-Rabi f ) the dearest of all people, the first of the
disciples to you and to all people. Therefore they may distinguish between good
and evil, and therefore not one of them can claim that he was not informed of

God's signs ...' . This confirms the degree of importance the Bab attributed to
Yazdi almost as the implicit head of the Khurasan circle.

In the years following 1260, Mulla 'Abd al-Khaliq remained one of the
chief preachers of the new cause in Khurasan. Speaking from the pulpit, towards
1264 (1848) prior to the disturbances in Mashhad, he expressed his outspoken
views on the truthfulness of the Bab. Faced with the governor's pressure, he
adamantly refused to revoke his Babi beliefs, and instead proposed a debate
with the ^ulama of the city. As a result he was again 'barred from jum ih
prayers, and was ordered (by the governor) to stay indoors, and consider his

seclusion as a condition for his safety' . His residence in Tehran in 1265
(1848-9) was perhaps as a result of the same dispute, which finally led to his

enforced detention in the capital . As with Mulla Muhammad 'Ali Hujjat Zanjani

and many other 'extremist 1 'ulama who at the same time were detained in the
capital, Yazdi's forced exile was aimed at avoiding further trouble. His
presence in the capital seems to have been noticed also by Prince Khanlar Mlrza,
who refers to his 'corrupted 1 beliefs when later he accuses the Babis of being
provocators and .mufsidin fi al-ard .

In 1265, the death of his young son Shaykh ''Ali in the Tabarsi uprising,
which happened at the same time as the Bab's claim for QO* imiyat 9 shattered the

2      -    —
faith of the old mujtahid, and brought him to the point of denial . Baha'allah's
references to ^Abd al-Khaliq's denunciation, clearly illustrate the latter 's
disillusion in facing the consequences of the Babi upheavals . While in Tehran,
he received a letter from the Bab sent to him through Vahid Darabl. When he
came to the sentence 'I am the righteous Qa'im whose appearance you were
promised' he threw away the letter and cried: 'Alas, my son died in vain* 2 .
He himself died three years later 4 .

Mulla *Abd al-Khaliq was a Shaykhi from central Khurasan, who had in common
with the rest of the Babis of Khurasan, a religious and geographical background.
Yet he should still be regarded as a high ranking mujtahid of the older Shaykhi
generation whose response to Babi 'extremism 1 was one of hesitation and dis­
approval. Indeed in spite of his zeal and devotion, he should be regarded as
the representative of a more moderate attitude among the early Babis who still
considered the Bab as the continuation of the Shaykhi school.

Parallel with ^Abd al-Khaliq Yazdi another example of a Babi conversion
amongst the high ranking Shaykhi 'ulama, with the same moderate views, was
Mirza (Sayyid) Ahmad Azghandi. Originally from Azghand, a village in the hinter-
land of Turbat, his sphere of activities extended from Mashhad to Yazd 5 . He
was a Shaykhi mujtahid , with some skill in Shi^i hadith. Nabil Zarandi, who ranks

him amongst the most learned ulama of the province , speaks of the 'voluminous
compilation' of 12,000 Islamic traditions which Azghandi provided, after spending
considerable time and effort, in order to justify the Bab's manifestation 2 .
This work must be counted among  the early Babi apologetic literature, which
appeared as a result of the early controversies over the veracity of the Bab's
claims, perhaps in reply to Haji Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmanl's refutation Izhaq

— — 3                   *      *
al-Batil . According to Nabil 9 the sole copy of it was destroyed by one of his
opponents, who was a supporter of Kirmani, during Azghandi's abode in Yazd .
Yet, in the light of later developments, it appears that Mirza Ahmad,

f         —                                              *
similar   to Abd al-Khaliq but different    to many others.in the Mashhad circle,
did not favour a strong reaction against the adversaries of the Babis. In a
letter to Azghandi in 1264 (1848), the Bab, perhaps for the first, time, briefly
foresaw the occurrence of the Mazandaran upheaval . Yet, as far as our sources
are concerned, Azghandi did not participate in the series of events which
finally ended in the Mazandaran campaign. Further, in relation to the followers
of Karim Khan Kirmani, who enjoyed a strong position in the city of Yazd,
Azghandi, who with his uncle Sayyid Husain

Azghandi was striving to/• hold his
position, never underestimated the potential danger of his enemies . However,
this cautious approach did not protect him even in his own base, Turbat-i
Haydariyih. In the course of the persecution and animosity which followed the
execution of the Bab in 1266 (1850), he was arrested in Azghand and was moved
to Turbat and then to Mashhad in a humiliating manner .

If Mulla ^Abd al-Khaliq and Mulla Ahmad Azghandi were representing a more

moderate attitude and were only prepared to confine their dispute with their
opponents within the limits of theological arguments, there were others who held
stronger views in the face of the mounting hostility towards the Babis. Mulla

Baqir Qa'ini (sometimes known as Harati), a learned mujtahid of Mashhad
with a relative amount of wealth and influence, was an outstanding example of
this Babi radicalism . Originally from Qa'in , it was during his residence in
Mashhad, perhaps due to past acquaintance, that he was eventually brought to the

-     . 3                                  - -
movement by Mulla Husain . He was the co-founder of the Babiyih and a devoted
preacher of the Babi cause from the pulpit 4 . His financial support covered the
expenses of the Babiyih, and after 1263 (1847) possibly extended to the purchase
of arms in Mashhad . His untiring efforts in the later years of the movement,
and his participation in Tabarsi, finally ended in his violent death in the city

of Amul. The account given by the Babi sources of the way he acted in the last
moment of his life is a iittirig conclusion to the life of an uncompromising Babi
leader .

The conversion of Qa'iril, like that of many other Babi figures, naturally
brought about the conversion of many other relatives and followers. In addition

to his wife , his son and his brother , who embraced the new faith, according
to one source, in the course of time, as a result of his open preaching, 'as
many as four hundred followers gave their support to the cause' . A large group

of followers who performed their prayers behind Qa'ini in the Babiyih, could in
fact be regarded as the backbone of the Babi forces who started the Mazandaran
campaign in 1264 (1848) .   Nearly all sources agree that Qa'ini, 'apart from his
learning, was a man of many arts and resources, and very brave and valorous,
and that it was he who had planned most of the strategic movements' of the Babis
in Tabarsi

. Indeed, the vital role played by him in the events of 1263-65

(1847-49) emphasises his knowledge of training and warfare. Further, it
demonstrates his significant place in the development of the movement towards
an armed resistance.  Nothing is known about his past experiences, yet during
the events of 1264 in Mashhad, Qa'ini himself trained and commanded the Babis
in action .

During this phase of unrest in Khurasan, just before the beginning of the
Mashhad rebellion of Ramadan, 1264/1848, it is interesting to see that the Babis,
as an organised force, were amongst the first to respond with a considerable
degree of militancy. Brief clashes occurred between the Babi armed parties and
pro-Qajar factions in the city. There is some evidence to show that this
fighting between the Mashhadi crowd and government forces had been sparked off
by these early incidents, and in some sense can be seen as a continuation of
them. However, the Babi involvement ended in the hasty departure of Mulla

f ~~           -      - 4

Husain  and his followers in Sha'ban 1264 for Mazandaran . Later, during the

Tabarsi
•       episode, he was military adviser, and after the death of Mulla Husain,
the military commander of the Babi fortress. The surviving accounts of Tabarsi

give frequent references to his skilful and  often spontaneous plans for   the
fortification of Tabarsi, his innovations in warfare, his efforts to maintain
discipline amongst the Babi corps, and his personal participation in the
fighting.
As a radical leader, Mulla Muhammad Baqir, like most Babi extremists,

combined two complementary abilities. As a preacher, he was not only able to
mobilise people from the pulpit, and charge them with messianic aspirations,
but he had also the rare ability to lead followers to open confrontation.

The fruits of Mulla Husain f s preachings may also be seen in a number of

leading position in the Babi community, especially after 1264. His extremist
tendencies, which particularly developed after the fall of Tabarsi, his ability

to organise Babis into clandestine groups in urban centres, his ingenious plans
to overthrow both religious and state authorities, and his claims for leader-
ship, made him an outstanding character amongst the early leaders 3 .

His role in later years of the movement further reveals that, contrary to
the policies of the moderate elements, he was committed to a militant approach.
After being involved in a series of unsuccessful operations in Azarbaijan, with
the ultimate purpose of releasing the Bab from his incarceration in Chihriq ,
^Azim planned a rising in Tehran in 1265 (1849), to remove Mirza Taqi Khan Amir

in Tehran. After 1266 (1850), in the leadership crisis which followed the
execution of the Bab, and the death of the most important Babi figures, Azim
assumed the deputyship of the Bab, which in practice led to his command over
the extremist elements . Again in 1268 (1852) , he was the chief organiser
behind the unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Nasir al-Din Shah, which resulted
in an extensive massacre of the Babis throughout Iran. Shaykh Ali himself met
his death when after the massacre of all the alleged conspirators, under pressure
from the government, a fatva was issued by Imam Jum ih approving Azim's
execution. Mirza ''Ali Khan Hajib al-Daulih and his executors jointly
slaughtered him2 .

The conversion of Mulla (Mirza) Muhammad Furughi on the other hand was an
example of regional interconnection between the Babis of central Khurasan 3 .
Originally from Dughabad, a hamlet near Fayzabad in the district of Muhawalat,

Besides the converted ^ ulama, who formed the basis of the circle, as in
other parts of the country, some members of the mercantile and trading community
also participated in the cause. As far as our inadequate sources can aid us in
identifying them, examples of merchants, local traders, commission-agents and
wholesalers suggest that their contribution to the new movement was next to that
of the 'ulama. Factors such as the traditional links between the ulama and
tujjar, family and commercial interconnections and affiliations with a religious
leader made it possible for them to become acquainted with the new call.

Aqa ^Ali Riza Tajir Shirazi, for instance, a well-known merchant from
Shiraz who had settled in Mashhad, was an example of those who established an
intermediary link between trade and religious studies. At one stage he was a
talabih in the Madrasih of Mirza Ja^far in Mashhad and his early recognition of
the cause was due to his friendship with later Babi figures 4 . Some time before
1260 he had sworn an oath of fraternity ( fdhd-i baradari) with his classmate
Mulla Muhammad ^Ali Barfurushi (Quddus) . It also appears that he and Quddus

•                                 _                         g
belonged to a talabih group of which Mulla Husain was also a member . At the

time of his departure from Mashhad, however, Quddus withdrew his oath, since,
according to Tarikh-i Khurasan, he believed that it was impossible for Aqa Ali

Riza to fulfil the strict terms of the pledge . Yet, whether the real reason
behind the retraction was Aqa r Ali Riza's engagement in trade, which in Quddus'
view would inevitably distance him from talabih life, or Quddus' faith in
devotional ascetism, which his counterpart was not able to match, is not known.
But nonetheless, 'his erstwhile membership of the circle made it possible for
r Ali Riza to respond to Mulla Husain's call, and subsequently offer his financial

aid to the Khurasani followers. During the turmoil of 1264 (1848) in Mashhad,
Aqa ^Ali Riza, while preparing himself to join the Babi marchers on their way to
Mazandaran, was arrested by Sam Khan the biglarbaygi of Mashhad, who coveted his
assets and under the pretext of blasphemy, bastinadoed him and extorted a large

sum from him . Later in his life, perhaps because of financial troubles, he
abandoned his trade and became a local

*    'Abdul Javad (Muhammad

•     Javad) Yazdi was another example of the Babi
merchants of Khurasan. A relative of Mulla ^Abd al-Khaliq, and presumably one
of his close adherents , he embraced the cause in its early days, perhaps as a
result of ^Abd al-Khaliq 's efforts . Established in Mashhad as a reliable
broker, he was basically a commission-agent for the Yazdi merchants in the city,
whilst his son-in-law, a certain Haji Ghulam Husain Tajir Yazdi, himself a Babi,
acted as the representative of the Afnan brothers, uncles of the Bab, in the
city of Yazd .
Being a relative of Mulla ^Abd al-Khaliq, it is very probable that Haji
^Abd al-Javad and his son-in-law were merchants with Shaykhi tendencies. Their
connection with the Afnan brothers in Shiraz and Bushihr sheds more light on
the channels through which merchants like ^Abd al-Javad and Aqa 'Ali Riza Shirazi
might have been encouraged to recognise the new call. Even more significant is

the trade organised by Shaykhi merchants on the Bushihr-Mashhad route, with
representatives in Mashhad, Tabas, Yazd, Shiraz and Bushihr, which provides
convincing evidence for the existence of a Shaykhi network of merchants, always
closely linked to Shaykhi ^ulama, throughout the country .

Apart from the above mentioned tujjar, traces of the conversion of minor
local traders and retailers are also detectable. Some of the jadld al-Islam Jews
of Turbat-i Haydariyih

for instance, who were mainly involved in local trade and
guilds, were curious about the Babi call because of their acquaintance with Babi
leaders. The jadid al-Islam Jews of Turbat, originally from Yazd, had suffered
the widespread persecution and forced conversion of 1839-40 in Khurasan and were
obliged to maintain a crypto-Judaic form under pressure 2 . Already in 1266 (1850),
according to Fu'adi,, at the time of Mulla Ahmad Azghandi's arrest and banishment,
six of the Turbati Jews who were on friendly terms with him, sympathised with
his cause, though their full conversion only took place a few years later 2 . The
real motives behind this interest which seems to have been connected with ^Abd
al-Khaliq's alleged Jewish origin, may be found in the manner in which the
deprived minority expressed itself in response to continuous waves of persecution,
forced conversions, and the strict control exerted on jadid al-Islams to observe
religious duties. As in other cases throughout the country, the members of the
repressed community who recognised the messianic promises of the Babi message,
were in fact seeking some consolation in the movement, which could restore to
them, if not their security, prosperity, or lost faith, at least some hope and
courage to survive in the face of hostile forces.
Yet perhaps Haji (Abd al-Majid Nishaburi held the most remarkable place
among the Babi merchants and traders of Khurasan. ^Abd al-Majid who was a dealer
in turquoise and high quality shawls 4 , 'through his father, enjoyed an unrivalled
prestige as the owner of the best-known turquoise mine in Nishapur 1 . Though
nothing is known about his past experience with members of the Khurasan circle,

his name appears amongst the first individuals who accepted the call through
Mulla Husain, possibly when he was passing through Nishabur on his way to
Mashhad . It seems he had not fully become convinced of the veracity of the
cause until, like . a few other Kashani and Isfahani

merchants *, he embarked on
his personal quest to visit the new manifestation. After visiting the Bab,
either in the Hijaz

or in Shiraz   , he returned to Mashhad, where he engaged in
trade as a dealer in luxury goods. In the following years, his personal
dedication together with his generous financial support put him amongst the
prominent believers in Khurasan. On the eve- of the Tabarsi episode, he
accompanied Mulla Husain on his march to Mazandaran, and not only financed most

of the outgoings with valuable Kashmir shawls or the wealth of the Nishabur mine,
but, despite being in his mid-fifties, he participated actively in the fighting
of Tabarsi .

After the fall of Tabarsi, he was captured and brought to the city of
—    _                 «
Barfurush together with Quddus and the other survivors. But unlike the others,
his life was saved by the prince commander Mahdi Quli Mirza, who noticed that
Haji ^Abd al-Majid, being a prosperous man, was too valuable to be slaughtered

by the crowd . Subsequently he managed to escape from the Tehran gaol after

"•ft                            — •" t        —
paying a ransom of a hundred tumans . In the following years, Haji 'Abd al-Majid
remained a zealous Babi and later Baha'i-. 7 .
Twenty eight years after Tabarsi in 1294 (1877-8), Haji rAbd al-Majid met
his death in the city of Mashhad in his mid-eighties. After much controversy,
following the mujtahid's fatva concerning his blasphemy, Aqa Muhammad Baqir

Majid (see below).

Najafi Isfahani , the notorious enemy of the Babi-Baha'is, who had temporarily

moved from Isfahan to Mashhad (1877-8), put his seal of approval on the fatva
to strengthen his weakening position against the state authorities and perhaps
to enhance his nationwide reputation for executing Babis. Accused of being a
heretic, Mirza 'Abd al-Majid could have escaped execution if he had denied his
beliefs, but to the very last moment he insisted on them and regarded his death

as the only way to achieve 'salvation 1 , and was therefore executed .

Amongst the early conversions, though the contribution of members of the
fulama and trade were predominant, the presence of a small group of low ranking
local officials also deserves some attention. During his first mission to
Khurasan, Mulla Husain when passing through Sabzivar, paid a brief visit to a

number of local mustaufis (revenue accountants), who had perhaps had some contact
with Shaykhis in the past. Later, two brothers, Mirza ''All Riza Mustaufi
Sabzivari, and then his brother Mirza Muhammad Riza (later Mu'taman al-Saltanih),

and some of their relatives became supporters of the Babi cause . Though their
affiliation to the movement seems to some extent to have remained secret, never­
theless their moral and material support first included funds for the

- march4 , and in the following years provided some comfort for the
Mazandaran
Babis at times of persecution and trouble . Towards the 1870 T s (1290's), both
brothers were promoted in their offices. While Mirza ^Ali Riza became one of

his brother occupied the office of vizarat-i Khurasan (chief revenue accountant
of Khurasan) . Hence, since Nasir al-Din Shah was highly suspicious of Mu'taman
al-Saltanih's Babi sentiments, he ordered his transfer to the city of Kashan
where he was virtually in exile. Later, in a well-thought-out plan to eliminate
Mu'taman al-Saltanih, the Shah summoned him to the capital, and he was first
obliged to marry the Shah's sister, and then forced to drink 'poisonous coffee'
(qahvih-yi Qajar) from his wife's hand (1310 Q./1892-3) 2 .

Mirza Muhammad Taqi Juvayni Sabzivari, another Babi figure, came from
amongst the Sabzivari officials. Though he was a humble scribe and accountant
(dabir va avarihnigar) , in his Babi career he showed himself to be a courageous
and faithful Babi fighter. He was born in the village of Juvayn and encountered
Mulla Husain on one of his visits to the town. Juvayni's effective participation
began when, in 1264 (1848), in the course of the Tabarsl upheaval he held the
responsibility for receipts and expenditure of the common funds , and on a few
occasions acted as the representative of the Babi party in negotiations with the
local chiefs and state officials . His most dramatic act, which could be seen
as a final declaration of war against the government, was the slaying of Khusrau
Khan Qadikala'i' in the forests around Barfurush, as a reprisal for his deceit­
ful behaviour towards the defenceless and confused Babi column . In the final
surrender of the Babi fighters, Mirza Muhammad Taqi was captured and put to
death by the Qajar troops. His head was spiked on the top of a spear and carried
around the city of Barfurush .

The study of the above indi /iduals may serve as examples for other non-
clerical members of the early Babi circle in Khurasan. As in the case of the
^ulama who were committed to the new doctrine, previous affiliations and

connections were the chief elements for the attraction of the local merchants
and state officials to the movement. However, the degree of their participation
and the nature of their involvement in the movement also seem to be partly
determined by their occupation and rank. Both groups represented an urban
provincial 'middle class 1 which began to form in the middle decades of the 19th
century. But any attempt to establish a definite link between the conversion of
these groups and their socio-political background, beyond the intermediary
element of messianic expectations, could not go further than general speculation.
In fact, the millenarian ideas are the strongest unifying factor in bringing
individuals from different ranks and positions to acceptance of the Babi
doctrine.

The appeal of the message was mainly due to the fact that the new movement,
in contrast to existing religious or secular currents, was able to channel
common aspirations towards a tangible goal, particularly at times when Khurasani
society, which traditionally looked to the ^ulama for protection and security,
seems to have been less satisfied with the performance of the orthodox fulama.
In these circumstances the appeal of a messianic movement was not something
unpredictable, exceptionally when the power of the clergy was exhausted by
private conflicts and petty revenges within the framework of city politics.
Up to a point this was always a frequent characteristic of urban and religious
life in Iran, but the structure and ethos of religious life in Mashhad during
this decade has suggested grounds for an unusual degree of fragmentation and
loss of control.

As regards the ultimate plans and goals of the movement, the formation of
the Khurasan group may be counted as one of the major achievements of the early
years. Its role, in theory and in practice, in the course of the general
development of the movement and in particular during the events of which Tabarsi
was the climax, was highly significant. At a time when Mulla Ali Bastami and
other Babi Letters were entangled in increasing obstacles in 'Atabat, in spite
of their early success, and the Bab himself was disillusioned by his reception
in the Hijaz, Mulla Husain, by contrast, was able to organise a community which
played an important role in the progress of the movement.

CHAPTER NINE

Pilgrimage to Mecca

In an earlier chapter, the theological justification for announcing the
Babi message in Mecca and then in Kufah was discussed, and the symbolic impli­
cations of such a declaration were examined .     After the departure of the early
disciples to their assignment, the Bab himself, 'according to the previous

2    .                                                         _
arrangements' , which he made with his followers, decided to set out for Hijaz,
where in the course of Hajj he intended to proclaim his mission.       This was an
attempt to fulfil those Shi'i traditions which emphatically required the open
declaration of the Qa'im in front of the Ka^ba, prior to the final uprising
(Khumj) in the land of Kufah.

Reasserting the inevitable fulfilment of the prophecies, the Bab himself
underlines the significance of the Mecca declaration in the following words:

> 'Thus on -that month (PKIi al-Hij j a) whatever is promised by
> your God to every young and old, will happen. Soon he
> will appear in the Holy Land with the word that will
> "split asunder" whatever is in the heavens and earth.
> Behold his word; the righteous Qa'im ($5? im-i b£ al-haqq)
> who is the just Qa'im (Qa9 im-i, b'i al-qist') will arise in
> Mecca according to what has been uttered: "When the Qa'im
> appears, give him your support together with all those
> who will come to his assistance from distant corners".
> When they (his opponents) "have corrupted the earth",
> then he will commence the new cause in the hinterland
> of Kufah' 3.

In the Bab's mind, the fulfilment of these prophecies was attributed to a divine
force beyond his control, which first assigned him to this mission to 'set out

was convinced to be an irreversible course, with all its details destined to happen
as was predicted.

To the above considerations for Hajj, one should also add some more tangible
facts which accelerated the departure of Sayyid Ali Muhammad from Shiraz in 26th

^                            1                    •

Sha^ban 1260 (10th September 1844) . Various indications make it possible to
assume that some considerations of a personal nature and particularly in relation
to his safety, influenced his decision to leave Shiraz in some haste. In a
letter to Mulla ^Abd al-Khaliq Yazdi, which is written in an invocatory style,
the Bab makes a brief but important reference to the situation in which he left
Shiraz:

> f O my God, you know my cause, and witness my inner
> intentions, and that I did not undertake this cause
> but to promote your pure religion (dSn-i fc/z5Z-ts) and
> your hidden message. I had warned those who know me
> not to reveal my name. But I set out for pilgrimage
> to your house when I became terrified of the accomplices
> of the devil who were the corrupt people'2.

The same anxiety over the publication of his identity is also expressed in
another letter to Shaykh r Ali Qa'ini, son of Mulla r Abd al-Khaliq, in which the
Bab complains bitterly of the carelessness of some of his followers: 'When I
left this city (Shiraz) for the destination of Baytallah al-Haram,

if after my
departure no one had divulged my name, no one would have been tormented. But
my believers are responsible towards God. Now there happened what ought to
happen' .

These complaints over the disclosure of his identity, even before his
departure, are the first signs of the Bab's displeasure with the activities of
some of his followers. He feared, perhaps with some justification, that the
untimely exposure of what should have remained a closely guarded secret, brought
with it unnecessary harassment and persecution. As early as Sha ban 1260,
traces of a rift can be identified in the Babi ranks, which in the next few years
turned to a major crisis within the movement. At this stage, it is not possible
to identify any individual or group responsible for this embarrassing disclosure.
However, as far as the two prominent disciples were concerned, the statement
made by Mulla Husain at the time of his departure from Shiraz , as well as the

reluctance shown by Mulla ''Ali Bastami to reveal the name of the promised Bab

— *?                      *
in ' Atabat , indicates that to a large extent they observed the secrecy agreed
upon 3 .

What seems to be the source of the Bab's apprehension was the fact that in
the disturbed conditions of Shiraz, the widespread rumours, which stimulated
peoples' curiosity to learn about the new claimant, could create harmful
agitation and trouble. Haji Mirza Muhammad Taqi Vakil al-Haqq, the Bab's

.            .                    .

maternal cousin, who at the time was residing in the city, recollects that 'in
the year 1260 in Shiraz, a rumour broke out that a noble sayyid claimed to be
the deputy (no* •££>) of the Qa'im, but his sacred name was not mentioned' . In
the course of one of his visits to the Bab in the month of Sha ban, about a week
before his departure, Muhammad Taqi saw the Bab sitting on the terrace of his
house and writing prayers and verses. When Vakil al-Haqq enquired about the

•                ^
rumours that the new Deputy of the Imam prohibited the smoking of qdliyan, the
Bab confirmed it without any further comments . As in his reply to Haji Ahmad
Ishik Aqasi, here the Bab preserves a non-committal position on the enquiry
about the new revelation .

This unwanted publicity and its effect on the Bab's decision are also
reported by Mirza Kazem-Beg, who on the basis of an unspecified source, maintains
that:

Fears of the 'devil's accomplices' and 'the corrupt people' in the 'fertile
ground of prejudice and superstition' can only be fully appreciated if the
matter is examined in the context of the general developments which at the time
were taking place in Shiraz. A brief look at the disturbed state of Fars
province reveals the nature of the threat which compelled the Bab to leave
Shiraz in secret, the same threat which was to endanger him when he returned
from Hajj .

A series of riots and public disturbances in the towns and villages of
Fars, which had already started earlier in the year, reached their climax in the
month of Sha^ban (August-September 1844) when the inner city clashes and open
rebellion against an exceptionally ineffective and unpopular government brought
the province to total anarchy and chaos. This is illustrated in various reports
by Colonel Sheil and his agent in Shiraz throughout 1844-5, in which the
typical course of an urban uprising, and its natural outcome of violence and
insecurity, can be observed 3 . With regard to the protests and agitations which
followed the appointment of Mirza Nabi Khan Mazandarani to the governorship of
Fars, in early August 1844 (Rajab 1260) Sheil reports: 'The province of Fars

still remains in the same disturbed state. Mirza Nabee TChan the Governor,
being perfectly destitute of authority and unable to levy the revenue* . The
new governor, whose only reason for being appointed was his ability to offer
the highest bid for the office, not only lacked a basic support in the capital
but also in the province . In fact from the early days of his office, Mirza
Nabi was faced with fierce opposition from the local notables, who for a variety
of reasons, did not approve of his appointment.

In order to express even further their disapproval of Mirza Nabi and his
repressive measures for collecting excessive taxes, a delegation of local
notables arrived in Tehran to press for his removal. The delegation from Shiraz
represented all five Haydari quarters in the city, as well as the leaders of the

—              *                                      *3

Ni'mati quarters and thus provided a relatively united front . The pattern of
the opposition, and the channels through which the involved parties organised
and expressed their protest, indicate that the current conflict not only
included the influential notables at a high level, but also embraced large
groups of the inhabitants at lower levels.
The deep rooted Haydari-Ni^mati division in most Iranian cities in the 19th

century, according to Persian sources, goes back to the late 15th century.
Though such a division does not represent any ideological or even social
difference between the two parties, it should still be regarded as a major
feature in the pattern of city politics, especially at times of disturbance and
turmoil. These divisions provide an insight into the origin of many urban
conflicts, and the way such conflicts developed in the course of a local power
struggle. As it was strictly based on divisions of city quarters, the
inhabitants of each quarter had an almost compulsory affiliation to one of the
two factions. Though the Kadkhudas were officially in charge of the quarter,
it appears that during crises and civil strife, groups of lutis

and their
patrons were the real force in action. In one of his reports Sheil states:
'In all the principal towns of Persia, the inhabitants are divided into two
parties, the Hyderees and the Ne^metees, who engage in contests which are
usually periodical and insignificant, but which increase in fierceness and

frequency under a weak government 1 .

Indeed the composition of the delegation to Tehran illustrates the strength
of the two divisions in the city which in the previous ten years of Muhammad
Shah's reign had successfully brought down successive  provincial governments,
and made the province of Fars virtually ungovernable. Haji Mirza Muhammad   Khan

Qavam al-Mulk, the influential and well established biglarbaygi of Fars from the
Haydari quarter of Bala Kaft , usually found himself in alliance with Muhammad

Khan Ilbaygi Qashqa'i from the Maydan-i Shah quarter (Haydari) who was almost

as important as Qavam. These three together with three other notables of the
remaining Haydari quarters (Haydari  Khan-Ch) as well as with the tacit cooperation

with the chief of Ni fmati Khanih were able to exert the same pressure which had
caused the fall of Manuchihr Khan Mu^tamid al-Daulih in 1252 (1836-7), Firaydun
Mirza in 1256 (1840-1) and Farhad Mirza in 1258 (1842-3) from the governorship
of Fars 4 .

Various motives encouraged the local leaders to take up an independent
stand towards the central government. At times they emerged as natural leaders
of the public, and their challenge enjoyed the strong support of the inhabitants,
who themselves suffered from the maltreatment of the government agents. To a
powerful figure like Qavam al-Mulk who combined landownership with effective
control over the city f s affairs, the establishment of a stable government meant

less control over the administration of the city, as well as a loss of revenue
in town and countryside. Equally, for his powerful ally Muhammad Khan Ilbaygi
MM

Qashqa'i, the establishment of a strong provincial government which could control
the countryside meant restrictions on the activities of the tribe as well as
payment of the due taxes.

The traditional alliance which existed between biglarbaygi, kadkhudabashis
and kadkhudas on the one hand, and various elements with tribal or urban origin
such as Ilbaygi, prominent 'ulama and members of the city brigandage on the
other, created an impenetrable urban network which could hardly be disunited by
any outside force. While Qavam al-Mulk and his officers practically controlled
the city quarters, Ilbaygi guaranteed the balancing force which was necessary to
check the threat of the government troops, and turbulent lutis ensured the
violence and disorder which were necessary for creating embarrassment for the
government. Towards the 1250's and 60's different scenes of an orchestrated
resistance can be seen, in which the lutis of the rival quarters, usually under

•                                        i
the influence of rival figures, played a major role in the development of events .
In mid-August 1844, Mirza Nabi attempted to publish the farman for commercial
regulations regarding the recovery of debts due to English merchants, by reading
it in the principal mosque; 'the rabble and disaffected persons in Sheeraz
assembled round, and would allow no one to approach the mosque. Their
supposition was probably that the Ferman contained an order to replace Mirza
Nabee Khan in Government 1 2 .
It is hard to establish to what extent the violence of the lutis voiced
people's grievances against the government, but no doubt at times of social and
political turmoil they created a major problem for the security of the quarters
and the safety of the inhabitants. It seems that even the truce, or the nominal
understanding, which was reached at a higher level between the representatives
of quarters, was not observed by lutis such as Ahmad Sultan from Ishaq Bayg

3                           «...

quarter , who according to the customary divisions of the quarters, lost no
opportunity to settle old feuds. The eye witness account of the Shiraz agent
of the British mission in Tehran provides a vivid picture of the hostilities in
the city:

After referring to various disturbances which simultaneously occurred in
other towns and villages of Fars, and also the dispute which broke out between
the Simnani and Hamadani troops over their lodging in the city, the report gives
an example of the damage and casualties which the inhabitants of Shiraz on one
occasion suffered from gang-warfare:

Giving some figures for the recent fighting, the report counts at least 8 dead
and 132 injured in various incidents in Shiraz and 56 dead in other parts 3 .
Finally, appealing to the British representative to intervene, the agent states:

> 'The people here come to me and say that they are in

Thus, in the.absence of an effective governmental or civilian authority
for the enforcement of law and order, and as the direct outcome of the resistance
shown by the local forces towards the central government, an ideal condition
prevailed for the mob to assume control of the quarters and stage a full scale
war, which caused great danger and suffering for the ordinary inhabitants. The
local notables who were probably the real instigators of these factional dis-

orders, certainly had a limited ability to maintain peace and order .

Under such circumstances, the publication of a highly sensitive issue such
as the mission preached by the Bab would naturally have added a new dimension
to the existing situation. Here the Bab was faced with two options: either he
could have proclaimed his mission in the hope of attracting the attention of the
curious public, or else in spite of a growing interest towards his claims,
leave the city and commence his pilgrimage to the Hajj.  In choosing the first

option, the absence of a powerful provincial government and the existing turmoil
might have given him the chance to recruit freely without serious fear of the
'ulama's reaction, since they lacked the official backing of the government.
But such publication would inevitably have meant involvement in city politics
and taking sides in the Haydari-Ni'mati divisions, since in the event of any

strong action from the opposing 'ulama which could have been implemented by
provocation and incitement of the mob, he would have had to rely upon the
opposite faction for security and protection. But such protection could not have
materialised without the Bab leaning towards the leaders of these divisions and
ultimately being manipulated by certain notables in the city to fulfil ambitions
beyond his original claims and intentions.

Thus as soon as the Bab felt that the disclosure of his identity might lead
to further trouble, he chose to leave Shiraz in haste since he had no intention
of facing the dangers of an unpredictable situation. He belonged to the merchant
class which, because of its functions, always held a neutral position in local

city politics in Shiraz.  He was a sayyid and an ascetic who belonged to a
respected merchant family and like most members of merchant families, held
himself above these involvements.   Moreover his peaceful and non-violent
character made him regard his mission, sometimes even contrary to his own
disciples, as being beyond political conflicts. His idealistic image of
proclamation and public acceptance was too much influenced by Shi i prophecies
to be scaled down to a realistic engagement in temporal affairs. Indeed as the
events of the next few years showed, he largely lacked a sense of political
timing and hence never managed to exploit the situation in his own favour.
Perhaps it was a wise move to leave the public declaration in Shiraz to Mulla
Sadiq

Muqaddas, but as we saw earlier, in spite of Muqaddas' courageous efforts,
the whole mission ended in failure and later resulted in the arrest and
detention of the Bab . This was because the declaration coincided with the
arrival of the new governor who backed the ^ulama, but more significantly because
the nature of the message was so unconventional that it could hardly attract the
support of the influential factions in an effective way.

Nevertheless, the extent of the Bab's concern with his own safety should
not be exaggerated. His decision to leave Shiraz before further difficulties
occurred should also be interpreted as a temporary remedy to a much deeper
struggle which tormented the Bab's mind, a struggle between his self-assumed
duty to declare publicly his 'divine truth' only for himself and his close
circle of followers. As we will see, the inner tension which had already started
in Shiraz, reached its height during Hajj, and in the course of 1261-2 (1845-6).

Later events bring this intellectual conflict more to the surface, and show the
Bab's preoccupation with the nature of his mission and its possible implications.

After leaving Shiraz, the Bab arrived at the port of Bushihr in 6th Ramadan
(20th September 1844) where he stayed for two weeks before boarding the sailing
vessel which took the pilgrims to Jidda on 19th Ramadan. Two days after his
arrival at Jaz-irat al-Bahr 2 , while still waiting for his departure, he wrote a
letter to his wife in which he expressed his deep affection. Here again he
refers to considerations which encouraged him to leave, and speaks of the

1\.   See above Chapter Six, I.
2\.   The title given to Bushihr by the Bab (Khutba   al-Jidda, op.cit. p.66)

destiny by which he was assigned to this mission:

> T God is my witness that since the time of our

> that in this very month the ship will sail. Gracious
> God shall protect us'2.

In this journey, beside his faithful Abyssinian servant Mubarak, only Mulla

^Ali Barfurushi (Quddus) accompanied the Bab . Quddus, who attended
the Bab as his secretary (kattb) , seems to have been chosen by the Bab partly
because of the former's original intention to perform Hajj in the same year ,

and partly because of the Bab's personal affection for his young disciple, who
later played a crucial role in the leadership of the movement after 1848. When
he instructed his other disciples to embark on their assignments, the Bab
designated Quddus to accompany him to Mecca, where he apparently took the oath
of fraternity (si-ghih—i ukhuwat) with him . However, it appears that Quddus

did not play any major part throughout the journey, and it was only after their
return that his involvement in the events of Shiraz 1261 (1845) and Kirman 1262
(1846) gave him some significance amongst his followers.

first Dhu al-Bijja 1260 (22nd December 1844), the sea journey took 71 days. As
far as can be reckoned from various letters and addresses written en route,
between the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean and then the Red Sea, the vessel
stopped in Kangan, a small port half-way between Bushihr and Bandar ^Abbas on
the Persian coast , Muscat, and Mocha (in Bab al-Mandab) before finally arriving
at Jidda . Besides the inland caravan routes to the Hijaz      , the other means of
transport available to most Persian pilgrims of central and southern Iran were
the sailing carriers which operated between ports of the Persian Gulf and the
Red Sea coast. The sailing carriers on this route, in addition to their trade
journeys throughout the year, seem also to have carried passengers for the
Hijaz

at the pilgrimage season .
While on board, the excessively humid and hot weather, the rough sea, and
the inconvenience of the sailing vessel, added to the difficulties of a slow
and tiresome voyage, and left an unpleasant effect on the Bab who had never
before experienced the sea . This experience seems to have been worsened because
of the offensive behaviour of some fellow-pilgrims on board. In Bayan t on the
subject of pilgrimage, the Bab recalls:

> 'On my journey to Mecca, I personally witnessed someone
> regarded as a respected figure in the vessel, who under­
> took luxurious expenses, but deprived his fellow-friend
> and room-mate even of a glass of water. From Bushihr to
> Muscat, which took us twelve days, as we were not able to
> take water, I contented myself with the juice of sweet
> lemon 1 6.
The agony of pilgrimage so much tormented the Bab that later in Bayan, he

exempted, amongst others, those who should undertake a sea voyage to Mecca from
Hajj. Even for those who are obliged (mustati* ) to make Hajj, he only
prescribes a pilgrimage if 'on the way there would be no grief for the traveller,
since on the sea there is nothing but grief (huzn) ' . Indeed in spite of the
traditional Islamic view which sometimes even extols the sufferings of the
pilgrims as a necessary purifying process, the Bab looks forward to the improve­
ment of roads and communications in the Islamic lands. In one of his rare
references to the West, he praises the rapid and secure road and communication
system in Arz-i Farangistan and regrets that even the ctiaparZ service in Iran
is monopolised by 'the possessors of authority' and is not available to the

__ r\
deprived and poor (mustaza ( fin) .
As a whole the Bab's impression of his fellow pilgrims throughout Hajj,
indicated in many of his writings, was a mixed sense of resentment and pity.
He recounts:

> 'On the way to Mecca one matter which was most disgrace­
> ful towards God, and indeed diminishing to their
> (original) intention, was the pilgrim's quarrels with
> each other, since such behaviour was prohibited, and
> remains so. Tradition for believers is nothing but
> forebearing, patience, decency and moderation. The
> House repudiates such people who circumambulate around
> it'3.

Such complaints about the behaviour of pilgrims is also acknowledged by some
contemporary European travellers, who on their way to Hajj, occasionally came
across groups of Persian pilgrims. George August Wallin, the Finnish traveller
who ventured through Hijaz in 1845, a year later than the Bab, remarks that
Persian pilgrims 'are extremely awkward and tiresome on a desert journey' 4 .

In addition to the general discrimination and ill treatment which all
Persians experienced during Hajj, the Bab seems also to have suffered from the
deliberate molesting and provocation of his fellow pilgrims. References to
'quarrels' between pilgrims, and the 'ignorance' of passengers should be seen

in the light of the criticism which was made against him. Apparently on board
the vessel he had already preached hinting at the advent of the promised Imam.
He himself remarks that amongst the passengers he did not see any believer in
the Book, except one, 'since the rest of the pilgrims were a bunch of useless
and ignorant people 1 . Mlrza Abul Hasan Shirazi, a merchant on board the same
vessel, and most probably the same believer who is mentioned by the Bab, gives
an eye witness account of the Bab's constant preoccupation with his writings 2 .

An incident on board illustrates the alarming opposition which the Bab
faced in his earliest steps to publicise his claim. The expression of his real
intentions for this journey, no matter how reticently and indirectly, when added
to constant revelations of numerous khutbas and tablets from the young sayyid

• o
with 'extraordinary and strange behaviour' , naturally created a good excuse
for a fellow citizen such as Shaykh Abu Hashim Shirazi to stage a strong
attack against the Bab. But as the provocations and insults of Abu Hashim
became increasingly intolerable for the other passengers as well as the Bab, the
captain of the vessel who probably feared a full scale fight on board, ordered
Abu Hashim to be seized and thrown into the sea. However in spite of the
captain's determination to be rid of the Shaykh, the Bab stepped forward to
intercede for him. Mirza Abul Hasan recounts that 'the captain, who was impressed
by the Bab's innocence and his attempt at mediation, finally accepted'. Yet
Abu Hashim, in spite of the Bab's mediation, lost no time in creating more
trouble for the Bab , by reporting his activity to the ulama even before he
returned to Shiraz.

Reaching Muscat, the Bab arrived at the house of the Imam Jum'ih of the
city, where he delivered 'the message of God' to him. Though at first sight
he was impressed by his writings and 'was counted amongst the rightly guided',
later, as the Bab puts it, he 'followed his own worldly desires, and thus the

Book judged him amongst assailants' .      Similarly the effect of his message on
the pilgrims and the local dignitaries in most cases proved to be negative. Yet
there are the exceptions of individuals who anxiously undertook the pilgrimage
in pursuit of the promised Zuhur . Sayyid Javad Muharrir, the Isfahan! scribe
who had already heard of the advent of the Qa'im from Mulla- Husain 2 and hurriedly
arrived at Shiraz when the Bab had already left the city, finally visited in
Muscat the Shirazi merchant whom he reckoned to be the promised Bab.

From the description given by Mulla Husain he must have had a vague idea,
if not full knowledge, of the man whom he was seeking, since in the house of
the Imam Jun/ih of Muscat he was able to find 'the signs which had been related
by the imams about the Qa'im 1 (i.e. his face, height, manners etc.) fully

identical with the features of Sayyid r Ali Muhammad Shirazi . In spite of the
Bab's deliberate efforts not to reveal his identity, the enthusiasm shown by
Sayyid Javad should be taken as an example of the eagerness of the early
believers to affiliate themselves with the new cause. Not long after, he saw
the Bab again in Jidda and later on a few occasions in Mecca and Medina. When
he asked the Bab: 'How could I succeed in your sublime recognition', the Bab
replied: 'How did you recognise the late Shaykh (i.e. Ahsa'i) and Sayyid-i
Rashti?' I humbly said 'With intimate companionship'. He then said: 'Here you
should do the same' . This prudent answer indeed encouraged Sayyid Javad to
join a gathering of the Bab and his companions in Medina:

> Quddus was busy reading and collating the commentary
> on Sweat al-Baqara which had been revealed from the
> Holy Pen. When he saw me he paused for a moment before

Scenes described-by Sayyid Javad of his efforts to recognise the Bab illustrate
the initiation which most early Babis passed through before being admitted fully
to the circle of trusted followers.

After arriving in Mecca in first DhuaL-Hijja the Bab prepared himself for
Hajj rituals (manasik) . He performed thoroughly all the required rites of
dressing in ihram, visiting the Great Mosque, circumambulation of the Ka^ba,
sa fy between Safa and Marwa, ceremonies of the Hajj proper in ^Arafa, and the

sacrifice of lawn al-Nafa* . He remained in Mecca till the 23rd of the same
month before moving to Medina where he visited the shrine of the Prophet. On
27th Muharram

1261 after 27 days abode in Medina (10th January to 6th February
1844) he returned to Jidda in 18th Safar     1261. Here after a brief halt he

boarded the same vessel for Bushihr in 24th Safar,     and arrived sometime at the

^                                 •

end of Jmnada II 1261 (June 1845) after nearly seven months travel. On his
return from Medina, it appears that the Bab reached Jidda by way of Yahbu and
Rabigh, since he did not give any indication of passing through Mecca for a
second time. Around this time, the whole region was in a state of disturbance
and revolt. Ibn Rumi, the Shaykh of the Harb      tribe had revolted against Ottoman

administration because the Pasha had failed to pay directly to him a subsidy
which he had formerly received for the safe conduct of the pilgrims through his
area, and consequently signalled his displeasure by attacking the small Turkish
garrison in the little port of Rabigh .

Thus the general insecurity of the area also affected the Bab on the road.
After he departed from Medina, on first Safar 1261, in spite of the constant

vigilance of his companions, a roving Bedouin suddenly appeared on the horizon,
drew near to the Bab and snatching the saddlebag that had been lying on the
ground beside him,        'which contained His writings and papers', vanished into

the desert . The loss in this robbery of various sahifaa, khutbas and
commentaries, which were the result of his 'revelations' in the past few months,
further frustrated him. Though this was an act 'decreed by God 1 , and he had
already 'read it in the sahifa of his soul 1 beforehand, yet it added to other
hardships and grievances, which no doubt affected the Bab's decision to abandon
his original plan, and take the safe route to Balad al-Arm (i.e. Shiraz) 2 .

The pilgrimage to Mecca was primarily designed to fulfil the vital task of
public declaration. To demonstrate the significance of this task, it is
necessary to elaborate on some aspects of this attempt, which in spite of their
importance, have received little attention in most historical accounts. It is
important to see how, when the Bab had reached Mecca, the Holy places affected
and changed the plans which had been previously formulated. Available
materials, whether accounts of eye witnesses or the Bab's own references,
provide a convincing picture which in some areas, nevertheless remains ambiguous.
Mirza Abul Hasan Shirazi seems to be the only account which clearly states that
at the end of Hajj rites, when the floor and the roof of Masjid al-Haram were
fully occupied with pilgrims, in the presence of Quddus and others, the Bab
stood against the wall, holding the ring knob of the Ka ba's door and three
times in 'the most eloquent and exquisite voice', announced; 'I am the Qa'im

- ' '' ' rj n ^- • // " ' *'•    3
whom you were expecting. ( <jjJt*"uA t >^$j oJt fJbJlbi ^\, ) .

This was the verse which according to Mirza Abul Hasan was recited by the
Bab in order to announce his mission. However, according to the Shi i traditions,
the verse which the Qa'im is supposed to read at the time of declaration in
Mecca varies from source to source. Shaykh Sadduq in Kamal al-D-in and Muhammad

— in his Kitab
Ibn Ibrahim           — al-Ghayba 5 under the"                       — quoted the* verse

from the Qjr3 an XXVI, 20: 'So I fled from you, fearing you. But ray Lord gave me
judgement, and made me one of the Envoys 1 . Mufaddal on the other hand has
mentioned the verse which the Qa'im will repeat when he will invite his
companions to take the oath of allegiance; '0 believers! If you help God, He
will help you, and confirm your feet. But as for the unbelievers, ill chance
shall befall them!' . But here Mirza Abul Hasan seems to be particularly
influenced by the content of those prophecies which anticipate the occurrence
of the 'Outcry 1 (Sayha) or 'Announcement 1 (Nida* ) on the Day of Khuruj when the

•   m

Miwadi (Announcer) or the Archangel Gabriel will announce in eloquent Arabic the
appearance of Mahdi . However, the content of it could also be compared with
the hadith related from Imam Muhammad Baqir in which the Qa'im, standing against
the black stone, will announce his claim 3 .
Mirza Abul Hasan

then continues: 'It was extraordinary, that in spite of
that noise, immediately the crowd became silent, in a way that even the flapping
of the wings of a passing sparrow was audible'. He maintains that all the
pilgrims heard the Bab's call, and interpreted it for each other. They discussed
it, and in their letters, reported the new proclamation to the people in their
homelands .
Although Mirza Abul Hasan was an eye witness on this occasion, it seems

likely that he allowed his imagination to colour his description. He must have
exaggerated not only the general reception of the Bab's call, but indeed the
manner and the extent to which the Bab uncovered his inner intentions. The
combination of the massive influence of the traditions which prophesied the
Qa'im's proclamation in Mecca, and the Bab's enigmatic and multi-faceted claim
no doubt affected the clarity of vision of a believer who, at the distance of
some years, could no longer distinguish the puzzling stages of the revelation of
the Bab.

The Bab's own references to the Mecca declaration, make it clear that he
did not receive any widespread response, whether favourable or unfavourable.
However they never clarify to what extent he actually conveyed his mission to
the public, or, considering the practical obstacles, whether indeed he was
inclined to do so. Referring to himself as 'the founder of the House', the Bab
acknowledges the pilgrim's general lack of insight in recognising his true
position;

> 'One thousand two hundred and seventy years from the
> (Prophet's) Designation (B^tha) have passed and each
> year innumerable people have circumambulated the House.
> In the final year, the founder of the House himself

> him, and he recognised all. And the only one who
> recognised him was the one who accompanied him in his
> pilgrimage, and he is the one whose (name) is equal
> to eight vahid, and God is proud of him' 1 .

On another occasion he asserts that of all pilgrims only three managed to perform
a correct Hajj, which again implied that not only was he disenchanted by the
fact that the public paid no real attention to him, but that he only approved
of the pilgrimage of those who succeeded in recognising him2 .
Given the general circumstances of the Hajj, when religious emotions and
zeal were at their height, even if a public declaration as such could have taken
place, it could hardly have had a favourable effect on the audience, if it did
not in fact provoke their suspicion and anger. In the course of Hajj, and
primarily as a result of his experiences with his fellow pilgrims, it seems
that the Bab became increasingly aware of this fact. This is more apparent in
his contacts and interviews with some known individuals in whom, because of
their past views, the Bab invested some hope. The interview with Mulla Muhammad
Husain Muhit Kirmani, to which the Bab paid special attention, clearly shows
•        . •
that such prophetical admonitions, no matter how dramatic they were, usually led
to no positive result.

Being a well known member of the Shaykhi circle in Karbila', Muhit Kirmani
was regarded as one of the contenders for leadership of the Shaykhis after the
death of Rashtl . His presence in Mecca in the same year as the Bab could be
in connection with the news which had reached him of the conversion of his ex-
associates and classmates to the cause of the new Bab in Shiraz. Qatil Karbala'i
maintains that few months after the death of Rashti the remaining students in
''Atabat gradually left Karbila for various destinations and left Muhlt without

2                                  _/•___••
any following . No doubt the preachings of Mulla Ali Bastami played some part
in diverting the attention of the Shaykhi students towards the revelation in
Shiraz and the imminent journey of Sayyid ''Ali Muhammad to the Hijaz and
r     - 3                                          '
'Atabat . Presumably it was under the influence of   these preachings that Muhit
himself decided to travel to the Hijaz and meet the Bab.
Hence, the Bab seems to have taken Mirza Muhit by surprise when in the
course of Hajj

.   he approached him in the middle of the crowd. Urging him to
clarify his attitude, the Bab demanded Muhit to choose either to submit himself
unreservedly to his cause or to repudiate it entirely . In this 'peremptory
challenge 1 the Bab acknowledged the outstanding position of Muhit by referring
to his self assumed claim of being the direct inheritor of 'those twin great
Lights' , while pronouncing his own authority which by its nature superseded
any other claim of leadership; 'Verily I declare, none beside me in this day,
whether in the East or in the West, can claim to be the Gate (Bab) that leads
men to the knowledge of God' . In this delicate statement, the Bab deliberately
emphasises the title of Bdb'iyat and avoids the open claim of Qa? imiyat , which
no doubt under the circumstances would have been hazardous and unwise. Yet by
maintaining that he is the 'Gate* to the knowledge of God, he seems to stress
a quality which is more identified with the Qa'im, or even with an independent
revelation, than with the traditional image of Bab-i Imam. For the Shaykhis
the title Bab, in the sense that it was applied to previous Masters, was not
unprecedented, hence it is evident that Muhit was faced with a dilemma in that

the claim had gone well beyond the boundary of the 'Perfect STii'i' m Muhit

__ _                                                                  • •
Kirmani, as the representative of those in the Shaykhi school who tended to
diverge towards 'scholasticism 1 , and thus to undermine its messianic message,
was confronted by the Bab who on the grounds of his message advocated the need
for continuous spiritual guidance.
The Bab's answer to the scepticism of Muhit 'is none other than that proof

• •          i
whereby the truth of the Prophet Muhammad was established' .

> 'If you choose to reject my message, I will not let
> go your hand until you pledge your word to declare

Here, a demand for rendering satisfactory proofs was met by the Bab, not by any
conventional reasoning, but by direct appeal to irrevocable divine arbitration,
a practice which was consciously inspired by, and no doubt was strongly
reminiscent of, the Prophet's practice of mubahala with the disavowing
Christians of Najran, which took place roughly at the same date (around 23rd

—                                   o
Dhual-Hijja

in the outskirts of Medina .
But more recent examples might have been uppermost in the Bab's mind when
he made this appeal. Besides its Quranic precedence, mubahala was not an
unfamiliar practice in later times, often as the last resort for settling
theological disputes between two uncompromising parties with opposite views.

outside the gates of Tehran in order to distinguish the truth or the falsehood
of the Akhbari creed. Although the rrrubahala never took place, the presence of
the two parties with their followers turned into a test of popularity for the
two rivals . More significant is the call for mubahzla proposed by Sayyid
Kazim Rashti to Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi in response to the latter 1 s

•                           •      .

provocations and allegations against the Shaykhis in Najaf. Rashti offered
that the mubahzla should take place in the Shrine of Husain or the Shrine of

'Abbas or any other of the holy places and left it to Najafi to decide whether
it should be in public or private. Yet Najafi gave no reply to this call .

In his writings, the Bab also regards mubahzla as the ultimate means for
distinguishing truth from falsehood. He refers to this with the following
words:

> 'I accomplished the proof of mubahzla in Masjid al-Haram
> in the presence of eye witnesses, and the one who was
> addressed with what has been said in Sahifa al-Bayn al-

> Muhammad 'All Mazandarani, and there were others as well* .
By the description of his claim to Muhit, and the details recorded in

t  •
Sahifa al-Bayn al-Haramayn, the Bab implies that by following the example of

*                *
the Prophet, he has fulfilled the requirements of the prophecies:

> 'My GodI I take you as witness to what I said in Masjid

For the Bab, the call or mubahata had far greater symbolic meaning than a simple
delivery of his message to Muhit or a challenge for the leadership of the
Shaykhi community. By performing certain rites or summoning the 'renouncers to
his covenant 1 , of which Muhit is a representative, in fact the Bab is announcing
his mission to the people in'the most sacred place on the Earth', and in the
presence of the divine arbitrator, he pledges to God to be witness and the judge,
between him and those who are doomed to deny him.

The unexpected challenge left Muhit in a mood of distress and embarrassment .

• t
To escape an undesirable situation, and to postpone his final decision, he
proposed some theological problems to the Bab. Though mainly insignificant or

even irrelevant to the case, these questions demonstrate the way Muhit looked

upon the Bab's claims, and how he evaluated them .    On his return to Karbila',
Muhit
• • remained unmoved by the alarming tone of SaJrlfa which strongly advised him
to rebuff from his soul 'those signs of (false) scrutiny', since such illusions
would prevent him 'from grasping the knowledge of certitude* 2 . In a letter to
Mulla Husain Bushruyihi, the Bab acknowledges the 'accomplishment of his proof
to Muhit and expresses his doubts on his sincerity.   But he still hopes that
'soon God will remove what Satan has implanted in his heart.         He then instructs
Mulla Husain to convey his warning to Muhit, and remind him of the outcome of

4                             * *
his denial . But in spite of all efforts he remained opposed to the Bab. His
uncertainties, however, caused him to vacillate between maintaining an inde­
pendent position, and aligning himself with Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmani .
The refusal of Muhit no doubt was a set-back for the Bab, who perhaps
counted on Muhit's cooperation as an important factor in the conversion of the

• «

remaining Shaykhis.   But Muhit was not the only one who in the course of the

Hajj

encountered the Bab and refused to give his allegiance.       Other individuals
also met the Bab in Mecca but unlike the symbolic proclamation to Muhit, less

attention has been paid to these encounters. Yet they illustrate the Bab's
efforts to promote his mission amongst those dignitaries who, owing to their
past acquaintances, or their theological outlook, were more likely to appreciate
if not fully recognise his mission.

Sayyid Ja^far Darabi, known as Kashfi (illuminated), is an example of such
persons.  Being outside the sphere of Shaykhi thought, but yet with certain
views common to it, he developed a theology which could be regarded as a bridge

between mysticism, in the broad sense of the word, and less rigid forms of
fiqh . Kashfi remained, to a large extent, an unknown figure in Shi i theology.
But in fact he was an outstanding philosopher, moralist, and mystic, who in
some aspects greatly contributed to the development of Shi^i thought in the
first half of the nineteenth century. His diverse interests in Islamic subjects
made him a respected scholar in many ways comparable with Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i .

Paying special attention to ways and means of attaining the pure knowledge,
Kashfi tackled important issues such as Ma'* ad and Qiyamat in the light of some

esoteric ideas . Like the Shaykhis, he implicitly advocated the irreplaceable
position of a spiritual figure, who could only be known to the seekers by
mediation and vigilance. This approach is evident in Sanabarq , one of KashfI 1 s
important theological works. The Bab, who had read this work, maintained that,
in his mystical discourses, Sayyid Ja far has only become conscious of his own
soul, and therefore described his own servitude. He pointed out that the
knowledge of the status of Al Allah (the House of God) is beyond the capacity
of any individual, and then recommends Kashfi to study works of Shaykh Ahmad

[.                                                    *_    •
on this subject . On the other hand, regarding the question of Ma ad, the Bab
implicitly compared the Shaykhi theory of Hurqalya and the non-occurrence of
the 'corporal resurrection' (Ma (ad jismani) with Sayyid Ja r far's ideas in
Sandbarq and showed greater sympathy with the latter . No doubt the ideas of

Kashfi played some part in the development of the Babi theory of Qiyamat , yet
he remained silent when he was faced with the Bab, who in many aspects fulfilled
his theoretical requirements. Mirza Abul Hasan Shirazi states that 'I myself

~*. T   .     r                      '

met Haji Sayyid Ja' far. He was present in Mecca, he saw with his own eyes, and
heard with his own ears, but he did not become a believer 1 . The author even
claims that Kashfi was primarily attracted to Mecca because his knowledge of

_          o
jafp and other hidden sciences helped him to set the time of Zuhur in 1260 .

Nevertheless his lack of interest in the Bab and his message, which is also
reported on a few other occasions, could be regarded as the cautious response

of an aged scholar encountering highly controversial claims . Being far from
the main current of orthodoxy, Kashfi in theory was in line with a doctrine
which advocated the appearance of a saintly figure. In practice however, the
vehemence of the Babi message proved to be too strong and hazardous to be
accepted by him.

Another example of those whom the Bab encountered in Mecca was Haji Sulayman
Khan Afshar Sa'in Qal^ih entitled Amir al-Umara, son-in-law of Fath. Ali Shah
and one of the distinguished Afshar tribal chiefs during the reign of Muhammad
Shah and the early part of the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah . Though coming from
a very different background to most Shaykhis, Sulayman Khan, who was a staunch
adherent of Sayyid Kazim Rashti, and father-in-law to his daughter, had many

things in common with the others. He was said to have been enthusiastic to
learn the Time of Zuhur when he visited Rashti shortly before his death . From

then on he was also baffled by the delay in the emergence of the new master.
However, by the time he visited the Bab in Mecca , it appears that he had
already shown some sympathy, if not full support, towards Haji Muhammad Karim

»       W   M                                             *      *

Khan Kirmani. The Bab's allusion in the letter addressed to Sulayman Khan from
Medina is directed towards this very commitment to Kirmani. After the Mecca
pilgrimage, in later years as the nature of the Babi cause was further divulged,
it became increasingly apparent for the wealthy and powerful chief that align­
ment with Kirmani, who enjoyed veneration and respect amongst the Qajars, was
more realistic. However, conversion of his son Riza Quli Khan Sartip (son-in-
law of Rashti) to the Babi movement seems to have been a source of embarrassment
for Sulayman Khan, who perhaps as a reaction to his son's conversion, partici­
pated as the commander of the Qajar forces in the campaigns of both Tabarsi and
Zanj an .

Though from entirely different backgrounds, what Kashfi had in common with
Sulayman Khan was that their sons were later converted to the Babi movement.
Furthermore, they both had earlier inclinations towards ideas which anticipated
some form of messianic revelation. But contrary to their sons, their non-
acceptance of the Bab's call indicates the attitude of the older generation who,
either on theoretical grounds or because of political loyalties, was not
prepared to go as far as to recognise the 'manifestation' in the way the Bab
and his followers were propagating. But not all those who met the Bab during
his three week stay in Mecca remained unsympathetic towards his call. For
those who lacked Kashfi's theoretical sophistication or did not enjoy the same
social position as Sulayman Khan, the Bab and his mission seem to have a special
attraction.

author of Nuqtat al-Kaf about his own impression of the Bab and his message,
which is almost identical to the recollections of Sayyid Javad Muharrir ,

illustrates the extent of   this fascination.  When Haji Muhammad Riza visited

* f    '

'the Master of the Earth 1 , circumambulating        Ka ba, he noticed such great
'devotion and submission' in him that he felt certain that 'either this person
is the Qa'im of the House of Muhammad, or else he is one of his chiefs (naqiby

Here, Makhmal Baf who is 'an honest man belonging to a tujjar family and known
to be good-natured, sharp and intelligent' has in fact identified in the Bab
an ambiguous state between the deputyship of the Imam and the Qa*imiyat itself.
The same attitude could also be detected in Aqa Sayyid-i Hindi later known as
Basir, a young blind dervish from a 'well known family of Daghdariyih dervishes
in India' , who in the course of his travels in Iran, Hijaz  and Atabat, had

visited  Sayyid Kazim Rashti sometime towards the end of the latter's life.
When he returned to Bombay, he learned about the Zuhur, perhaps from Mulla Sa id

—                                             •
Hindi, and as a result travelled back to Hijaz, and met the Bab in Mecca.

'Though in his appearance he was blind, he recognised at once the truth of his
(i.e. the Bab's) mission with the eye of his heart. He discovered the status
of Qafinriyat (in him) and acknowledged it' . Here again the main emphasis has
been put on the claim of the Qafinriyat, which is only comprehensible to those
who are prepared to learn the secret.

It is with reference to this very position of the Qo*irmyat that on a few
occasions the Bab designated some of his close disciples as the only individuals
who understood the true content of his message. In a letter to Mulla Husain  he

points out: 'Your Lord did not testify to the faith of any one in the month of
Hajj except you and the one who followed the instruction in the same manner as
* 6                                                                  —   7

and his mission.
7\.   INBA. 91, IV, p.11-12.

It is presumably this position of the QaJ inriyat the Bab had in mind when he
states that in the course of Hajj only Quddus had recognised him. This
recognition did not occur because Quddus was specially favoured, but only because
'he appreciated the essence of his Truthfulness (HujjZyat) , while the others,

—       * —                       1

in spite of the allusions embedded in Qayyum al-Asma*  , failed to grasp it 1 .

The above remarks make it clearer that in the course of Hajj the Bab never
embarked upon a large scale declaration of his mission. Instead he only sufficed
to inform a number of individuals whom he thought were prepared to recognise
his real claims and intentions. But the significance of the Hajj experience
should be seen in its effect on the Bab, his aspirations and his future decisions.
More than having had any influence on the general progress of the movement, this
experience helped the Bab to overcome his earlier illusions of mass conversion,
and gave him the opportunity to examine the realities of the outside world.
The general circumstances under which the Bab publicised his claim had a
considerable impact on the nature of his prophecy. The effect of these holy
surroundings, at the time of his visits to the House and the Shrine of the
Prophet, is clearly visible in his constant references to these places in most
of his letters, addresses, books and treatises. In fact the period of Hajj
should be regarded as one of the most productive periods in the Bab's short
life. As can be reckoned from the available sources 2 , his writings during Hajj
include three independent works: Sahlfa al-Bayan al-Haramayn , Sahifa al-A ( mal
al-Sana t and Kitdb al-Ruh, two commentaries: Commentary on Sura al—Nur         and
Commentary on At/at al-Kurst-, two commentaries on Qasida 'of al-Humayr-i- and Mi-sbah,
26 khutbas, numerous private letters and declarations.

But although because of his 'inspirations' he was convinced more than ever
of his divine mission, yet in his contacts with the public, to whom he felt his
mission was orientated, and particularly in his interviews with the above
mentioned individuals, for the first time he appreciated the formidable
obstacles to his task. This is clearly evident in most of his writings in this
period. al-Sahifa Bayn al-Haramayn mirrors his deepest emotions when he

1\.   Bayan. IV, 18 (p.148).
2\.   INBA. cf. Z. pp.288-9 and Browne Or. MSS.

encountered the pilgrims in the holy places . Here he considers himself as
'the Remembrance of God* (Dh-ikrallah) , 'the son of God's Prophet' and 'the
Arab youth' (fati al- fArabi) who 'is inspired by the (Holy) Spirit (Ruh) at

2    ....                                                      "

all times' . His mission is to enforce 'the command of the Remnant of God'
(Baqiyatallah) , a clear reference to the Qa'im, and to unfold the secret of
the 'two Shrines' for the people of the Earth. He holds the 'Knowledge of the
unity' and is the only one who can interpret the secrets of the Book . The
responsibilities the Bab assumes for himself clearly match the picture which
was given of the Qa'im in the Shi r i traditions. This image is further
elaborated by constant reference to the nearness of the 'Day of Termination'
(lawn al-Fasl) and 'the Time of Catastrophe' (Zalzalat al-Sa fa).

But in spite of his 'warnings' or his 'proofs', the recipients of his
message either ignored or renounced his call. The Bab refers to them in Sdkifa:

> 'Those who are accusing the Remembrance of the "Divine
> Name" (Dhikr-i Ismallah) (of blasphemy) are amongst the
> evil doers. They are disputing my verses and finding
> them empty of Quranic inspiration. They are accusing
> the "Word of God" (KaliwatallWi) of falsehood. So let

He then warns that because of their negligence, 'God therefore suspended the

appearance of His signs' till that Hour when the believers would be able to
'witness the Lord'. 'And a majority of them (i.e. the people) are not'among
the believers and thus ridicule His verses' . Addressing the bulk of pilgrims
in Mecca,-, his sharp criticism clearly reflects his bitter disappointment; 'The
majority of the .people are even less than animals in comprehending the words

of the Quran, and most of them are ignorant' . He then turns his attention
towards the leaders of the community, more specifically the 'ulama, and states:

> 'Those who in their selfish illusions claim to be
> mandated by God, they are amongst liars. They have
> not read a word of God's Book and thus misrepresent
> the words of God, of which they have no knowledge.
> And soon God will destroy what the devil has
> implanted in their souls'3.

The same sense of disappointment and anger is also reflected in his other
writings. In his letter to Mulla Husain he again emphasises that 'God will not
testify to any of the visitors (of the House) except with words of agony and
punishment. Soon God will arbitrate between me and them on the Day of Judgement.
And God is not unfair towards his servants' .        Again in his address to the
people of Mecca he condemns those who declined to take his word seriously, and
ranks them as idolaters and 'companions of Fire':

> 'Say, 0 people of MeccaI This is God's command in
> his Book. So obey if you are among his worshippers.
> I did not see many who were believers, and I saw
> many of them who were mockers (mustahzi*In) of God's
> verses. In the Book of your Lord, they are the
> companions of the Fire and God will not testify for the
> oppressors but with hatred. And "We place between
> thee and those who do not believe in the world to come
> a curtain obstructing"'5.

Calling on the Hanafi Imam of Medina, the Bab warns the people of Medina

of the forthcoming Yawn al-Qiyama. , when T God will judge his people with utmost
fairness 1 . As is clear from the above example, the style, as well as the
content, of most of his writings in this period, were heavily influenced by
the admonitory.tone of the Quranic verses. He seems to be conscious, if not
deliberately imitative of those verses which had long been considered as clues
to the nature of the Final Day. The above warnings in the Sahzfa

or in the
tablet to the people of Mecca for instance, bear an unmistakeable resemblance
to certain verses in the Sura Hud in the Qur'an:

> 'And if thou sayest, "You shall surely be raised up
> after death", the unbelievers will say, "This is
> naught but a manifest sorcery". And if we postpone
> the chastisement for them till a reckoned moment,
> they will say "what is detaining it?" Surely, the
> day    shall come to them, it shall not be turned
> aside from them, and they shall be encompassed by
> that they mocked at ... Whoso desires the present
> life and its adornment, we will pay them in full
> for their works therein, and they shall not be
> defrauded there; those are they for whom in the
> world to come there is only Fire, their deeds there
> will have failed, and void will be their works'2.

Here, the deliberate resemblance between 'the verses of the Book* and his own
writings not only supports his warnings that finally the renouncers and the
mockers will be placed in the Fire, or that the end of the Time is at hand,
but more significantly .it justifies his first allusions to the unavoidable
postponement of the promised KhuruJ.

The Bab's preoccupation with the nature of his mission, however, did not
resolve the immediate obstacles which loomed in the way of fulfilling the next
stage of the original plan. The Bab did not expect that the publication of the
message would so rapidly be confronted with the serious opposition of the
religious and secular authorities. The events of ^Atabat during the previous

'All Bastami's open teachings, demonstrated the ^ulama's resolution to fight

the threat of a millenarian movement. It equally revealed the extent to which
the Ottoman government was prepared to prevent the recurrence of Shi ^i resurgence
in ^Atabat. These unforseen troubles in ^Atabat, no doubt, left some effect on
the Bab. Being under great inner pressure, the Bab who was already disillusioned
with the general response in Mecca, decided to cancel his visit to ^Atabat, and
instead set out for his homeland Fars.

It is almost certain that the Bab was first informed of the troubles in
''Atabat by two ex-students of Sayyid Kazim Rashti, Sayyid ''All Kirmani and Mulla

•      Khurasani,    who embarked on the journey to Hajj not only to visit the Bab,
but probably to convey the news of Bastami's arrest by the Ottoman authorities.
Sayyid 'Ali Kirmani who was the scribe and one of the close companions of Rashti,
was effectively involved in various developments which took place in ^Atabat
after the death of Sayyid Kazim . After his meeting with Mulla Jalil Urumi, one
of the Letters of Hayy, he declared his support of the Bab, and repented of his

past falsifications against the Bab 2 . 'When he decided to become one of the
believers of this cause' writes Qatil, 'fearing his opponents, he fled (from
Karbila') and made the pilgrimage to Mecca, where he had the honour of accompany­
ing the 'Great Star' (Nayyir-i A^zam, i.e. the Bab) and sitting with him in the
same mahnil. ..' 3 .

Implicit references to the cancellation of the Atabat gathering first
appear in the Bab's writings after his interview with the above persons in Mecca.
In the early days of Muharram 1261, at the time of the rituals of visiting the

shrine of Husain, in reply to Sayyid 'Ali K.rmani the Bab in a passing reference
states: 'So let it be known to you that it is not possible to visit (the shrine
of Husain), unless your God's will rests upon it' 4 . The same message is trans-
mitted in more open terms in a letter in reply to the same Sayyid ''Ali Kirmani,
probably after the latter's return to 'Atabat: 'I have read your letter. So now
remember that at present it is not possible for me to meet you' . No doubt it
is due to this very fact that in a letter of instruction to Mulla Husain, which
is dated 10th Muharram 1261 and addressed to Kufah, (since at the time the Bab
was under the impression that Mulla Husain, according to the original plan, must

have reached Kufah), the Bab indicated his change of decision and gave brief
instructions to his followers.   After referring to his encounter with Muhit, he

goes on to express his sympathy towards Mulla Husain, while advising him to keep

away from 'idolaters' who are his opponents, but not to fear any trouble in the
service of his Lord. He then adds:

> 'And the Divine Word (Kalimatallah) would not allow his
> servant (a reference to himself) to embark on his Cause.
> And thus for every person in the Book of your Lord there
> is a written destiny. So when God's Word will be imple­
> mented, then the Wisdom of God's command will reveal
> itself. Therefore, depart from the land which God had

> interpretation which oppressors make of the Great, Supreme
> Word. When the nobles (rij'aZ) gather in the Holy Land
> and support this cause, advise them to wait till a new
> order comes from me'^.
The above instruction was, no doubt, made with regard to the wave of
opposition which was pointed towards Bastami

and others. The letter to Mulla
Husain was written on 10th Muharram (20th January 1845), whereas the trial of
Bastami
in Baghdad took place on 6th Muharram

(16th January)   . It is very
likely that he was only aware of the arrest and imprisonment of Bastami,

and
therefore conscious of the danger which threatened him and his followers if he
ever set foot in 'Atabat. Yet at this stage, only four days after the Baghdad
trial, he certainly had not received the news of the further deterioration in
the Babi's situation. But nonetheless the situation was critical enough for him
to advise his followers to be prepared for departure. The news of Bastami's

conviction appears to have reached the Bab in reports despatched by Mulla Hasan

Khurasani, who after his return to Karbila', together with Sayyid ^Ali Khurasani,
informed the Bab of the events in ^Atabat. As can be understood from the Bab's
replies to Khurasani, the latter had expressed his deep apprehension over the
outcome of the trial, and showed his strong anxiety over the doubtful possibility
of any further Babi activity in 'Atabat.

It is in reply to these reports that the Bab, writing from Bushihr,
instructed Mulla Hasan Khurasani to convey his message to 'the just divines'

1\.   INBA. 91, IV, pp.13-14, 10th Muharram 1261.
2\.   See above Chapter Five , II.

( f ulama—i 'adl) , a clear reference to his close followers, and instruct them to
leave their homes, and come to Balad al-Dhikr in order to testify to 'the
covenant of the Remnant of God (Baqiyatallah) . Meanwhile, his advice to
Khurasani is to remain in ^Atabat till new instructions can be issued . Later
in another letter to Mulla Hasan Khurasani, he made an appeal to all believers

in 'Atabat; 'Say! 0 crowd who have gathered here, call loudly for the one who
is enthroned on the throne of the Great Sacred Place (i.e. Masjid al-Haram), and
then depart all of you according to the divine command, and enter Balad al-Amn,
if you are amongst the readers of this letter' 2 .

The result of the Baghdad trial had some effects on the followers of the
Bab in Iraq. Accordingly, the Bab, referring to the verdict given in the trial,
tries to encourage his doubting followers; 'Do not be intimidated by the Baghdad
verdict. Struggle in the path of your Lord by (means of) wisdom and firm
arguments, in which there is a remedy for the denials and the denunciations of

^
the 'ulama, if you are conscious of the Divine cause and believe in it' .
Henceforth, the high hopes of some of those who had gathered in Karbila* rapidly
faded, or even turned to scepticism and denial when the Bab failed to fulfil his
promises. The Bab was aware of this change of attitude and tried to regain the
lost support by emphasising the truthfulness of his cause which would soon be
manifested on 'the Day of Judgement 1 :

> '0 the gathered crowd! How did you pass the verdict of
> falsehood on our servant (i.e. himself) who first brought
> to you verses of proof in the manner of the Quran, after
> accepting in your souls the cause of God. So wait for
> the divine Day of Judgement, and then I will judge, with
> the mandate of your Lord, between people'^.
But however damaging this postponement might have been, it is obvious that
after the experience of Mecca, the Bab was convinced that his journey to ''Atabat
would serve no other purpose but to intensify the existing hostility. This is
evident in a prayer addressed to Mulla ^Abd al-Khaliq Yazdi, in which the Bab
explains his reasons for not attending the gathering of ^Atabat:

> '0 Lord! You know of that command in which I ordered the
> ''ulama (i.e. the early believers) to enter the Holy Land
> (i.e. fAtabat) in order (to be prepared) for the Day of

Here, the cancellation of the ^Atabat plan was indeed attributed to a divine
force, which under the new circumstances abrogated the earlier command. The idea
of badaj is no doubt hinted at in this passage and further signalled by reference
to a relevant verse in the Qurhn. This has a long history in Shi^i theology
which is particularly elaborated in the Shaykhi school 2 . In the above passage,
the sentence '... and forgive those who are repentent and obedient to Your
tradition ... f appears to be an allusion to the Qurhn (VII, 153); 'And those who
do evil deeds, then repent thereafter and believe, surely thereafter thy Lord is
All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate'. This is one of the passages in the Qurhn
which is frequently asserted in support of the theory of bada* , that God will
change his resolve to punish sinners when they repent. This allusion still could
be further confirmed by the Bab's reference to 'what I understood from your Book'
which no doubt means the Qurhn.

In fact the Bab placed the responsibility of the cancellation entirely on
God's "change of decision".   But the divine reconsideration, however, had to be
embodied in a human agency.   Thus he interprets the cause of events according to

1\.   INBA. 91, XXIII, pp. 94-102 (97-8) 'Tablet for MullI rAbd al-Khaliq Yazdi

probably written towards the end of 1261'.

divine justification.  His journey to 'Atabat, which is the most important part
of his campaign, was suspended in order to prevent further hostility. The Bab
was quick to realise that the chances of an overwhelming success in ^Atabat were
fairly narrow, since he was faced not only with Shi''i religious opposition, but
with the more important threat of the secular authorities. Considering the Bab's
hesitancy and his general dislike of violence, it is not surprising to see that
out of disillusion and despair, he turned his attention to his homeland where he
assumed the lack of an effective local authority could at least allow him to
summon his followers without fear of any serious interference or organised
persecution. Therefore, the 'Holy Land' of Kufah and Karbila' is exchanged for
the 'Pure Land' of ' Balad al-Arm 1 , in order to allow the realisation of the same
prophecies in a new location, despite the fact that the time of declaration was
postponed for an indefinite period.

The cancellation of the gathering in ^Atabat, no matter how skilfully
justified by the Bab, had a strong effect on the conviction of those who had
anticipated a swift and even violent end to the 'evil 1 forces of the opposition.
Instead, they now witnessed, both in Bastaml's trial, and in the Bab's change of
decision the retreat of the movement, and a victory for its opponents. Indeed
the course of events gave an unexpected chance to the critics of the Bab,
especially in the Shaykhi camp, to magnify the Babi setback in ^Atabat and use it
as a means for discrediting the Bab. This is well illustrated in the sharp
attacks of Haji Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmani in Izhaq al-Batil as early as Rajab
1261 (July 1845);

'So first came Muharram and then Nauruz, and no revelation

He then specified that his meeting place (rritqat) is in the

What Karim Khan implies in his account, though in many ways either exagger­
ated or else misrepresented, still reflects the general setback which the move­
ment suffered in its earliest attempt. It is fairly evident that Karim Khan's
claim that after the Bab's failure to fulfil his promises, the back-bone of the
movement was destroyed is misrepresentaticn of the facts. Indeed his entire effort
throughout Izhaq a'L-Bat'i'l was directed to playing down the widespread popularity

of a movement which threatened his position. However it is fair to say, that
the whole affair left a shadow of doubt on the Bab's claimed authority and
encouraged some less committed Babis to voice their doubts.

But perhaps more important than any other aspect is the hint in the above
passage of the reasons for the emergence of the movement as a response to the
'intensity of oppression and lack of moderation'. References to 'overthrowing
the state' and 'starting an uprising' should not be merely taken as allegations
invented by Haji Muhammad Karim Khan in order to discredit the Babis by accusing
them of having anti-Qajar attitudes. Indeed the events of later years proved

the prevalence of such attitudes in the movement.   But no doubt the means of
achieving these objectives differed in the course of time.   Such changes may well
be observed in the difference between the tone of Surat al-Mulk of Qayywn al-Asma9
and the later Babi responses after 1264 which culminated in Tabarsi and other

similar events. .However in this early stage, the Bab, either because of his
personal uncertainties which intensified particularly as a result of his dis­
illusions in the Hajj, or because of the growing persecution and enmity towards

his disciples, was persuaded to take a more moderate line. On his return to
Iran he was faced with further hostility and persecution. Both in the case of
his disciples Muqaddas and Quddus and in the event of his own arrest and detention
later in 1845, he realised that the public propagation of his mission even in
his own homeland faced serious consequences. It was the realisation of this more
than any other factor which led the Bab to a state of resignation and seclusion.
Indeed in the course of the next few years the progress of the movement was
largely due to the disciples who were appointed by the Bab to lead the followers
rather than the Bab himself who performed only the role of the spiritual head.
This was the role which not only he himself preferred to play, but also
circumstances made it unavoidable.

CONCLUSION

It has been argued throughout this study that the emergence of the Babi
movement was largely a response to certain aspirations in Shi^i society which
had culminated in the early years of the 1840's. As such the movement was an
integral part of the whole religious development and therefore not an isolated
and irrelevant event in modern Iranian history. In its origin it inherited a
deeply rooted millenarian tradition which had been revived in the late 18th
century and continued to reappear in different forms throughout the first half
of the 19th. This tradition effected the rise of the Babi movement at two
levels. On the theoretical level, an internal process within the Shi^i circles
of learning brought about the revival of millenarian aspirations in the form of
the Shaykhi school as the most obvious response to the dominant theology. The
points of emphasis in Shaykhism gave some urgency and immediacy to the advent
of the Qa'im. The main contribution of the school in this respect was to place
the Imam back in the perspective of an historical development which in turn
necessitated his emergence at a definite moment of time. At the popular level,
the sporadic appearance of proto-millenarian responses in various forms, such as
the revival of the Sufi orders, the widespread speculation on the forthcoming
Zuhur and the rise of the urban and rural saints and 'Deputies' indicate the

survival of the millenarian heterodox tradition from earlier centuries.

The first signs of a convergence between these two currents of scholarly
and popular messianism appeared amongst some millenarians, mostly within the
sphere of Shaykhism, with a more realistic interpretation of the Qa'im and the
events of his Zuhur. But the fuller merger between the complex messianic
theories and the popular prophetic claims occurred in the Babi movement and was
brought about by those who were influenced by both these traditions. Both Sayyid
'Ali Muhammad the Bab and his early disciples were the representatives of this
intellectual union. Certain characteristics of the Bab made him an appropriate
person for the embodiment of this fusion. On the one hand he was self-educated
and an ascetic who was barely influenced by the scholarly traditions of the time.
On the other hand his personality and his behaviour were of a kind which could
be regarded by the common people as saintly and exceptional. In addition, being
a merchant he embodied those qualities which were often revered in the mercantile
community.  These characteristics were idealised, at least amongst those merchants
with Shaykhi inclinations, in the shape of an ethic with a strong emphasis on
asceticism, piety and unworldliness which also largely fitted the practical
aspects of Shaykhi teachings.

When this mercantile ethic of the layman combined with the aspirations of a
group of religious students who themselves, because of their upbringing and
training were highly charged with Shi^i messianic prophecies, then the right
ingredients were provided for the emergence of a millenarian movement. The
catalyst for this transference from a state of expectation to a state of fulfil­
ment of these expectations had been provided by two important developments:
first the culmination of expectation for an apocalpytic event towards the
beginning of the 1840's and secondly the crisis within the Shaykhi circle in the
rAtabat, particularly after the death of Sayyid Kazim Rashti. Whilst the first
factor moved popular beliefs towards a more definite image of the Zuku?, the

second factor ultimately divided those Shaykhi elements who were seeking a
millenarian solution from those who tended to preserve the school within its
scholastic boundaries.

The moment of 'proclamation 1 , and of the conversions of the disciples which
followed it, was the moment of great change for both the claimant and his
converts. The date of the proclamation was continuously emphasised by the Babi
sources because it indicated for them a break with the existing norms and values
of the time in the hope of entering into the realm of an eschatological future.
The concept of the 'new creation' (khalq-i jactid) symbolised this change in
outlook. This urge towards change gave the Babis the mobility and zeal for
challenging the existing order and thus determined the ultimate direction of the
movement. Theoretically, the 'proclamation' initiated a renewal in the continuous
course of divine revelations. In real terms this was interpreted as a need for
a drastic change in the religious and secular institutions which could only be
approved by the new Proof. This resulted in the Babis' inclination towards non-
rational and unconventional methods, different from the logic and reason of
the time, in order to achieve new standards for the cognition of the 'inner
truth' of the religion. In its essence this new approach led to the appearance
of an embryonic idea of progress in Babi thought which saw the purpose of the
successive prophetic manifestations (including that of the Bab) in the promotion
of the moral consciousness of mankind in an uninterruptable course. This idea
was alien to the dominant logic which had sanctified its own statis premises of
reasoning and insistently rejected any suggestion of change.

Nevertheless, for the Babis this change was expressed in the language of
Shi'i eschatology, whose symbols, characters and terminology had revived a
distant Shi^i past and therefore were familiar to the public. This made the
message of the new movement more understandable for the common man and particu­
larly for those groups who shared the same sympathies and the same intellectual
and social values with the founders of the movement.   The expansion of the

movement largely followed the pattern of the geographical distribution of the
Shaykhi school. Many small Babi circles were formed in provincial centres
throughout Iran and in some small towns and villages, particularly in Khurasan
and Azarbaijan. But this pattern of expansion also corresponded to the layout
of the commercial network throughout the country. The message of the movement
was transmitted through the trade routes and often by those elements who were
either directly involved in the trade or were in contact with local merchants,
traders and the members of various guilds. Similarly, the low and middle rank
clergy and the religious students particularly in places which were less
dominated by fuqaha* , or places which were previously influenced by the Shaykhi
elements, were attracted to the movement. These were groups who because of
their common urban characteristics, their wider contacts with the outside world,
their less dependent socio-economic status, the broader scope of their
aspirations and expectations, and their strong intercommunal ties, were in a
better position to be absorbed into the movement. The new movement was
potentially appealing to them because they could identify themselves with its
spiritual head and still more with its early propounders. It offered them a
progressive outlook which was attractive because it provided them with an
interpretation in a comprehensible and familiar language, and because it enhanced
and idealised moral and social values which were highly revered by them. Their
attraction to the movement therefore, perhaps signified the embryonic intention
of these urban groups with common social and intellectual characteristics, to
be organised on a more comprehensive scale and to be distinguished from the rest
of the society. However inconspicuous and primitive this intention may have
been, the Babi movement may still be regarded in its social context as the
earliest attempt to satisfy the ideological needs of these groups in their
development towards what may be loosely defined as the urban 'middle class'.
Yet in spite of the wider socio-economic ties which held these individuals and
groups together, their aspirations and hopes for change were still very much
religious and redemptive.  Indeed the economic changes of the time, vacillations
in trade, political and military threats and civil disturbances and insecurity
were regarded by the Babis as part of the greater decline in the affairs of the
world which called for an awareness of the proximity of an apocalyptic calamity.

Yet in spite of its potential capacity to attract urban groups, in practice
the movement failed to achieve any sizeable support beyond the sphere of certain
selective groups. Such failure to draw the public attention towards a set of
millenarian objectives which was first contemplated in the early stages of the
movement, may be attributed to two series of internal and external causes. As.

far as the internal causes are concerned, like many other movements, the Babi
movement, because of its messianic nature, embraced many diverse social and
intellectual tendencies. The most obvious example of such diversity was the
dichotomy which even from the earliest days loomed large between the 'moderate'
tendency represented by the Bab himself and his more affluent followers, mostly
from the merchant community, and the 'militant 1 approach represented by the
Shaykhi students from lower social backgrounds.   Such a difference rarely
expressed itself in an open confrontation or a break in the movement, yet the
whole development of the movement from moderation to extremism, particularly
after 1264 (1848), was the outcome of this internal division. As the moderate
approach failed to fulfil the objectives of the movement by adopting a
conciliatory attitude, the radical tendency which prevailed over the future
course of action determined the final fate of the movement.

The question of leadership was inseparably related to this diversity of
interests. The Bab's performance as the leader of the movement was insufficient
and indecisive. Thus even from the early stages around 1261-2 (1845-6) and
more definitely after his detention and captivity, largely with his own - consent
he was regarded as the spiritual head of the movement rather than a practical
leader. The hierarchical order amongst his supporters that had been set up by
the Bab to replace him in the practical leadership hardly ever functioned
effectively and the efforts of some of his followers,such as Quddus and Mulla
Husain Bushruyihi,were only partly effective in leading them during the Babi

resistance in Tabarsi. Hence up to its very end in 1268 (1852), the movement

continued to suffer from the lack of a consistent and effective leadership.

This difference and duality in the outlook however, was only in part the
outcome of the difference in the social background. The Babis' own pre­
occupation with past prophecies also prevented them from reaching any practical
and realistic objective. Inconsistency in plans and policies, methods and means
of preaching the new message was often accompanied by an obsession with
fulfilling the prophecies of the past or adopting manners and behaviours which
were thought to be those of the past prophets and saints. The Bab's complex
style of writing in his addresses and books is a good example of such an effort
to 'reveal verses' similar, or in his view,superior to the Quzbn. Such pre­
occupation with Shi^i eschatology prevented the Babis from adopting a fresh
approach different from the past concepts of revelation and the shari'at. Though
traces of a symbolic interpretation of these prophecies may be seen in many of
the Babi writings, for the greater part the Babi outlook was dominated by the
concepts of martyrdom, sacrifice and predestined fate which in the past had so

overwhelmingly prevailed over the Shi*i consciousness.     This inner conflict was
at the heart of Babi thought.    On the one hand it wished to free itself from the
past, and on the other it was still enchained by its symbols and images.

If the internal inconsistencies within the movement weakened its structure,
the external causes dealt the fatal blows to its entire existence.     The forces
of the established religion represented by the 1 ^ulama posed the greatest and
the most immediate threat. Almost without exception the attempts of the Babis
to open a dialogue with the non-Shaykhi mujtahids failed to achieve the desired
results. The strong reaction of the high ranking ''ulama was perhaps caused by
their religious duty to oppose any deviation from the path of Shari^at, but no
doubt it also reflected a sense of insecurity amongst them. Though in appear­
ance their position was relatively strong, and in some cases they were in full
control of the community, in reality they had already begun to move away from
their previous position as the de facto representatives of the urban public.
More than thirty years of Usuli domination had created a new generation of

mujtahids who because of their privileges were separated, though not fully
alienated, from the rest of the community. The new movement was especially
regarded as a threat to these privileges, because it was mostly represented by a
rival group of low ranking and energetic ^ulama who could potentially replace
them in the leadership of the community.

In the early stages the opposition of the fulama was only partly effective
in preventing the penetration of Babi elements. Compared to the Babi preachers
the ^ulama were in an advantageous position because they defended the accepted
Shar' and safeguarded the values which had been sanctified through the course of
time. They also held a strong, and sometimes tyrannical, control over the public
through the mosques. They were able to incite the mob against their rivals and
create civil riots and disturbances. Yet in spite of these advantages, in the
first four years of the movement they were unable to defeat the Babis on all
fronts.

Their oral and written denunciation became more effective only when they
received the support of the government. Save for the few sporadic examples of
government intervention in favour of the ''ulama in the earlier years, this
support was only fully given to them after 1264 (1848), when for the first time
the central government became seriously aware of the possible threat of the
movement to its own security. In spite of the traditional opposition of the
^ulama to the government, the alliance between the two against the spread of the
movement was the most significant and effective example of their cooperation in
the face of a common enemy.     The joint action of the religious and secular
authorities brought about the persecution and suppression of the Babi community.

This in effect resulted not only in the isolation of the Babis but also in their
loss of credibility in the eyes of the public, who under the influence of the
authorities saw their humiliation and persecution as a right and just punishment
for 'heretics' who had abandoned the 'path of Islam'.   Thus it is not surprising
to see that the 'general public gradually lost its sympathy with the Babi cause
and except in a few instances when it acted in support of the movement, for most
of the time they remained a silent observer, if not an instrument in the hand
of the authorities.   The forces of the established institutions were so strong
that it hardly ever gave the movement the necessary time and      opportunity to
grow and establish itself in a natural way.

Both the internal and external causes which contributed to the unsatisfactory
performance of the movement in its early stages, had reactions on the future
course of events. From 1263 (1847) onwards, the imprisonment of the Bab in the
castle of Maku and then Chihriq (1264-6/1848-50) which lasted for the rest of
his life, as well as the isolation of the Babis in most urban centres, forced
them towards a noticeably more militant course of action. The Bab's call to
his followers at the end of 1263 (1847) in Khurasan, and the subsequent
gathering of Badasht in 1264 (1848), signify the Babis' efforts to seek a more
independent stand, a consistent policy and a decisive leadership in the face of
the mounting hostility from outside. Equally, the Bab's open claim to Qa*imiyat
in the trial of Tabriz in 1264 (1848) was also to keep pace with the movement's
acceleration towards a more open and independent stand. Such a declaration was
the sign of a departure from the previous course of reconciliation and prudence.
His later claim to Mazhariyat - which is evident from his assumed title Rabb-i
A^la - and his attempt after 1263 to create a new Shari^at of Bayan was a further
assertion of this independent position outside the sphere of Islam. He as well
as his disciples had realised that they had been left with little choice but to
resist and defend.

But still the line taken by the Babis in practice was largely decided by
the development of events beyond their own control. Mulla Husain's march from

Khurasan to Mazandaran in Shafban 1264 (July-August 1848) aimed to assemble and
reorganise into a united party those Babis who had gathered from various
provinces to join the holy crusade, though at the same time he had not seriously
contemplated an armed uprising.   But the course of events forced Mulla Husain

and his companions to reply to the attacks of the angry mob in Barfurush and
later to take refuge in the shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi.   Though the death of

Shah in Shawal 1264 (September 1848) and the confusion which followed
it helped the Babis to achieve some temporary successes, later the accession of

Nasir

al-Din Shah to the throne and the change in government worked against them.
The lenient and indecisive policy of Haji Mirza Aqasi was replaced by the care-
fully weighed and systematic action of Mirza Taqi Khan Farahani, Amir Kabir,
who from the very beginning was determined to uproot the movement. The Babi
resistance in Tabarsi was motivated by a sheer need for defence and then turned

into a bloody confrontation with the government. It possessed all the character­
istics of a millenarian uprising and not unexpectedly - even for the Babis them­
selves - ended in their disastrous defeat and the death of many, including Mulla
Husain and Quddus. The upheaval of Tabarsi had a chain effect on the other
•                     __            •
Babi uprisings in Nayriz (led by Sayyid Yahya Darabi, Vahid) and Zanjan (led by

M>                                    *             *

Mulla Muhammad rAli Zanjani, Hujjat) (1265-7/1849-51). The immediate causes of
each of these upheavals varied and they developed in widely different circum­
stances and on a different scale to that of Tabarsi, yet they reflected the same
basic problems of isolation and insecurity.

The execution of the Bab in Tabriz on the 28th Sha^ban 1266 (9th July 1850)
which was ordered by Amir Kabir to ensure the total suppression of the movement,
had an immediate effect in demoralising the remnants of the Babi activists and
forcing them to retreat into clandestine circles. Nevertheless, the crisis in
the leadership after the execution of the Bab and the persecution and harassment
of the Babis, soon forced their activists to re-assemble in small urban groups
with the purpose of organising urban resistance. The unsuccessful attempt to
assassinate Nasir al-Din Shah in Shawal 1268 (August 1852) was the last, and

the most daring, act of the Babis. It was originally intended to avenge the
execution of the Bab, yet it reflected the more profound frustration and
desperation of the remaining active Babis after three years of disillusion and
defeat. In spite of the ingenious ideas of its original instigator Shaykh 0\li
Turshizi (^Azim), this attempt was poorly planned and badly carried out and as
in previous examples of Babi responses, it resulted in a wide-scale loss of life.
Many of the remaining Babi activists were arrested and put to death in a wide­
spread and indiscriminate massacre. The episode of militant activities between
1264 and 1268 (1848-52) was the outcome of pressures from both within and outside
the movement. This was an effort to broaden its scope and to attract new groups
in order to survive as an alternative to the existing order. The same pressures,
however,caused its total defeat and destruction as a movement of socio-political
change. Yet for the next few decades it survived as an underground religious
sect before undergoing drastic change in its outlook and doctrine and eventually
giving birth to the Baha'i faith in the 1870's and 80's. Some of the Babi ideas
were also preserved in the Babl-Azali branch of the movement and later re-emerged

at the end of the 19th century and during the constitutional revolution, but more
in the shape of a nostalgic revival.

Whatever the relative importance of the internal and external causes for
failure of the movement, there is perhaps a more profound contrast between the
specific outlook of the Babi movement and the prevalent orthodoxy of the period.
Shi'ism contains a strong element of expectation and an idealistic hope for the
establishment of a 'just' and 'divine' order. But it also holds its own anti­
thesis.  The history of Shi^ism has witnessed the rise and fall of many movements
which attempted to fulfil these expectations. This eternal conflict within
Shi'ism makes it appear as an unending circle in which phases of expectation and
disillusion follow each other. The Babis, in the originality of their ideas,
at the. time of change, possessed ahistorical awareness which had the potentiality
to break free from this cycle of inevitability. They sensed the 'decline' of
Islam and, what is more important, had the urge for renewal and change both in
a progressive direction and as a continuation of past achievements. However,
they largely lacked a sufficiently practical idealogy which could replace the
established religion or fill the widening ideological gap in Iranian society
which became progressively more apparent in the course of the later 19th century.
But their awareness of change and their urge for progress was the result of an
internal process within the framework of Shi^i thought and the outcome of a
development in Iranian society without any intervention or influence from outside.
This was perhaps the last attempt of its kind, before Iran's exposure, both in
socio-economic and ideological terms, to an alien, dominant western civilisation
which f rom the second half of the 19th century gradually prevailed over
traditional society and continuously, up to the present time, has created a
disruption in the natural course of its social and intellectual development.

BIBLIOGRAPHY

A Note on Sources

The histiography of the Babi movement is surrounded by controversies which
are caused by inaccuracies and deliberate misrepresentation of both primary and
secondary sources.   Most of the general accounts of the history of the movement
were recorded after the end of the first phase of the Babis in 1268 (1852) and
thus were subjected to later interpretations.      The intensity of the events during
the course of the first decade and the persecution and pressure on the Babis,
prevented them from making a consistent record of the events.       The death of almost
all the front rank followers of the Bab in the course of the first eight years
further hindered this process.    If the necessity for writing a general account
occasionally inspired some Babis to write narratives, the pressure of hostile
forces was such that it either caused their complete extinction or only allowed
them to reach later generations in fragments or more often in a distorted form.
A relatively poor standard of historiography and the hostility and bigotry of the
non-Babi chroniclers also caused gross exaggerations and irrecoverable gaps.
Furthermore, the events of the earlier period were often interpreted by later
writers with the specific purpose of justifying or invalidating a certain claim
or point of view.    Not to mention the obvious distortion and misuse of the facts
by hostile non-Babi writers, a more important example of this diverse inter­
pretation is that which occurred as a result of the Baha'i-Azali controversy
between the 1860's and the 1890's.    In many ways, the outcome of this controversy
affected the contents of those versions produced in this period.

Yet, in spite of these difficulties, the early Babi narratives and even in
some instances, their traces in secondary accounts, have often the rare quality
of recording the event with a freshness and sincerity which is lacking in most
other historical accounts of the time.       In most cases the Babi writers were
ordinary people who recorded their observations of other ordinary men in a most
natural form which differs widely from the complexities and elaborations of the
chroniclers or the limitations of the secondary accounts.

In general, sources on the early history of the movement can be divided into
five categories: (1) Persian and Arabic primary sources; (2) European primary
accounts; (3) Persian and Arabic accounts which are in between the primary and
secondary sources; (4) Persian and Arabic secondary accounts; (5) the secondary
European accounts.

The first group of the Persian and Arabic primary sources are the general
accounts produced in a period of more than thirty years after the execution of

the Bab in 1266 (1850).     There are occasional references to an 'old' history
(taTikh-i qadim) which had covered the events of the early years, and which is
supposed to have been written by one of the early believers of the Bab, most
probably Haji

Mirza Jani Kashani sometime prior to his execution in 1268 (1852).
E.G. Browne's edition of Nuqtat al-Kaf which is believed to have been the work of

Haji

Mirza Jani, appears to be the nearest to this yet untraced 'old history'.
But there is no definite evidence to prove for certain that Nuqtat al-Kaf is the
original version of the 'old' history or indeed that it was even written by Haji

_   _   _                                                                         •
Mirza Jani.     Much controversy surrounds the authenticity of some of its passages,
the possibility of later distortions and the real identity of the author. Since
it was first published in 1910, the text of Nuqtat al-Kaf and Browne's introduction
(which incidentally was written with the assistance of Muhammad Qazvini) inspired

•               _
some Baha'i writers such as Abul Fazl Gulpayigani to try in Kashf al-Ghita* , to
resolve some of the complexities of the text and to criticise some of Browne's
views. Yet neither Browne's speculations, nor the efforts of Gulpayigani, came
to any definite answer. Similarly suggestions by later scholars such as Balyuzi
(Edward Granville Growne and the Baha'-l Faith), Muhit Tabataba'i and others, only
led to a better understanding of problems rather than resolving them. What is
certain, however, is that this account of a combination of two separate theological
and historical parts was produced sometime in the late 1260's or early 1270's by
one or a few writers (amongst whom Haji Mirza Jani was most probably the original

author) who had either witnessed the early events or reported them from other
eye-witnesses. It is possible that some of the passages concerning the events of
1266-7 (1850-1) might have been added by later copyists, yet as far as the events
of the earlier years are concerned, the text of Nuqtat al-Kaf is largely in

agreement with other reliable sources of the period.

Decades of suppression and persecution suffered by the Babis caused a sense
of disillusion and frustration in the scattered communities throughout Iran which
in turn led to the temporary neglect of their historical past, both in oral and
written forms. Towards the 1880's however, the revival of the Babi circles in
Iran demonstrated a noticeable need for the compilation of new general narratives,
more in the Baha'i than in the Azali circles, in a different language and style
and with an emphasis on historical events that could satisfy the new ideological
orientation of these groups. The revised version of the 'old' history, known as
Tarikh-i Jadid (the New History) by Mirza Husain Hamadani under the patronage of

Manakji Hataryari, the Indian Zoroastrian representative in Tehran, and with the
preliminary supervision of Mirza Abul      Fazl Gulpayigani, was the first in a series
of attempts to produce new general narratives.          E.G. Browne's assessment of
Tarikh-i Jadid in his introduction to the English translation of this work (as in

his introduction to Nuqtat al-Kaf) demonstrates the difference in content and
style, the omissions and additions as well as the different religious and political
(or rather apolitical) orientation of the author in comparison to Nuqtat al-Kaf.

However some of the harsh criticisms by Browne of what he regarded as Baha'i
distortions and deviations in Tarikh-~i Jadid, may be questioned when it is
considered that the additional information in Tavikh-i, Jadid might have come from
another copy of Haji Mirza Jani's 'old' history different to that of Browne. So

long as no other manuscript is found which precedes in date that of Gobineau's
copy in the Bibliotheque Nationale, the final verdict cannot be easily passed on
this issue. Furthermore, it is possible to argue that the author of Tavikh-i, Jadid
did not consider himself committed to write a history identical to the 'old'
version of Haji

Mirza Jani and naturally, in many ways, he considered his own
'rationalised' and moderate viewpoint superior to that of the previous author.
Browne seems sometimes to have exaggerated the prime importance of some ideas
and attitudes which he believed, almost entirely on the basis of Nuqtat al-Kaf, to
be that of all the early Babis. Moreover, he had written his introduction to
Nuqtat al-Kaf at the time when, in the aftermath of the Constitutional Revolution,

he was actively involved in amplifying the ideas and activities of those whom he
appeared to believe (though he never openly expressed this) to have been the
legitimate descendants of the early Babis.   Thus perhaps beyond the boundaries of
historiography, he sometimes saw himself as an advocate of a cause of which he
thought the Azalis, and not the Baha'is, were the true representatives.

Yet accusations, counter-accusations and speculations in this controversy
sometimes appear to pass the limits of historical enquiry and become purely a
mental exercise, a kind of detective investigation or, worst of all, the prime
material for religious refutations and apologies. What is important however,
is that Tarikh-i. Jadid was not a successful attempt to compile a general narrative,
and as Browne rightly argues, it missed, or intended to miss, the militant spirit
of the early Babi period. The changes and alterations which were carried out in
the more recent versions of this history, of which Tarikh-i, Badi^-i Bayani is one
example, did not help to disentangle the earlier confusions either. But as far
as the early period of the movement is concerned, it contains some information
which can be relied upon when verified by other more reliable sources.

To compensate for the deficiencies and inaccuracies of the earlier general
accounts, various other attempts such as Maqalih-yi Shakhsi, Sayyah of ^Abd al-

Baha* were made. This is a relatively brief account written shortly before 1890
from the view of an onlooker, a Sayyah (traveller) which was loosely based on the
available information in both the Babi and non-Babi oral and written sources. It

only adds some scattered fresh information to the knowledge of the early period.
Yet, perhaps more significantly from the point of style and approach, it is an
effort to write an account which could justify the Baha'i stand by avoiding a
highly committed language.   Browne's edition and translation of this work appeared
a year after the .Bombay edition of 1890.

Beside these two above mentioned accounts, another attempt in writing a
general history of the early years was that of Shaykh Muhammad Nabil Zarandi,
known as Nabil A^zam, which is by far the most complete of the general narratives.

Written in its final version between 1305-8 (1888-90), Nabil T s narrative was based
not only on his own personal observations but on the oral and written memoirs of
many early Babis to whose authority he refers throughout the text.        He had the
assistance of Mirza Musa Nuri, brother of Baha'allah, and his complete work
covered the history of the movement up to the time of completion.         Being himself
an early Babi and also an articulate writer, he was able to compile his history in
a systematic and chronological order superior to previous accounts. Yet his
narrative suffers some noticeable handicaps.   First is that because of his personal
religious commitments and because of his subdued fatalism, which is a good example
of the change of attitude in many Babi-Baha'is of the first generation, he some­
times in his work misuses, or in some instances intentionally ignores, the intensity
and the militancy of the early Babi history, particularly by adopting a melo­
dramatic and sensational language which he has no hesitation in putting into the
mouths of his characters. Secondly, though his style and approach, at least as
far as the events of the early period are concerned, rarely caused any deliberate
distortion of fact, nevertheless his strong commitment to Baha'allah, which like
many other of the latter's companions reached the extremes of admiration and
praise, made him over-emphasise certain aspects of Babi history or even to see in
the earlier events a mysterious cause for the later 'manifestation' of Baha'allah.
Thirdly, the existing gap of about forty years between the actual events and
their recording, no doubt caused inaccuracies as well as inconsistency in the
sequence and details of the events for which the author tried to compensate by

«*
adding an element of the marvelous and the mysterious.    These problems in some
respects reduce the credibility of Nabil's narrative and the logic of its argument.
Moreover, the original Persian manuscript is not available, and the English
translation by Shoghi Effendi which only covers the first part up to 1268 (1852)
could be only an abridged edition of the original text.       In spite of these
deficiencies, however, Nabil remains a relatively reliable source which in most
cases corresponds to the facts supplied by earlier sources.       A careful study of
Nabil can reveal many hidden facts which allow one to go beyond the impression
which it gives at the first reading.

The second group of the Persian and Arabic primary sources are the non-Babi
general accounts which were basically recorded in the years immediately following
the end of the first phase of the movement in 1852.      The best known of these are
the two official chronicles of the mid 19th century, Nasikh al-Tawa?ikh (Tarikh-i
Qajariyih) of Sipihr and Raudat al-Safa of Hidayat which both paid considerable

attention to the rise of the movement.      In recording the events, both chroniclers
are biased, sarcastic and often inaccurate.      Their accounts are charged with
enough abuse, exaggeration and accusations to discredit the movement and to please
the authorities.     Yet they both contain some interesting details and remarks
which in some instances reflect the attitude of the authorities whilst elsewhere
they demonstrate their own secret admiration.      Nasikh al-Tawarikh's account is
particularly interesting since Sipihr seems to have gathered some of his
information on the early years from sources close to the Babis.       His detailed
account of the events of Tabarsi (and particularly the details on the fortifi-

cation and defence of the fortress) on the other hand, seems to have been given
to him by some of the army chiefs and officials who had themselves been present
at the event.     Hidayat's detailed account of the proceedings of the trial of the
Bab in Tabriz in 1264 (1848) was supplied to him by the officials and fulama who
were present in the gathering.      Other contemporary chronicles such as Khunnuji's
Haqayiq al-Akhbar or later accounts such as I''timid al-Saltanih's Muntazam-i

Nas-iri either give brief references or mainly repeat the descriptions of the

above accounts.     One exception is Mutanabi ' -in of I'tizad al-Saltanih which relies
for the earlier events on Nasikh al-Tawar-ikh but adds valuable information on
the events of 1267-8 in which he was indirectly involved.
Somewhat different to these official chronicles is the history of Ahmad

ibn
Abul Hasan Sharif Shirazi Ishik Aqasi which according to the author was initially

intended to rectify the discrepancies and distortions of the chronicles.        His
final draft completed in 1286 (1869) is partly based on his notes collected in
earlier years.     Coming from a Shirazi merchant family and being in close contact
with the family of the Bab, his early interest in the movement in its formative
period makes his account an exceptionally important source for the understanding
of this period.     He is mostly an impartial and observant writer whose qualities
as a historiographer were above those of most of his contemporaries.       Part of
this work relating to the Babi movement is translated into English by Khan Bahadur
while another section of it on Mirza Taqi Khan Amir Kabir is published by the same
person in its original Persian.      The complete manuscript which is in private
hands, remains to be published.
The third group of primary sources in Arabic and Persian are the narratives

which were written on three major Babi uprisings between 1264-7 (1848-51).                 These
accounts usually are more reliable than the general histories not only because
they are free from the elaborations and restrictions of the latter group but also
because they were often written by ordinary people who had themselves
participated in these events.           Some of them like Mirza Lutf ''All Shirazi's

^^                                          •
narrative of Tabarsi were written as day to day chronicles during the course

of upheaval itself.        Some like Tarikh^i Mimiyih by Mahjur Zavarih-i or the
narrative of Aqa Mir Abu Talib Shahmirzadi on Tabarsi were written a few years
after the actual events, whereas others like 'The Personal Reminiscences of the
Babi Insurrection at Zanjan in 1850' by Aqa Abd al-Ahad Zanjani or another account
of Zanjan by Mirza Husain Zanjani were written a few decades later and thus did

not escape occasional mistakes in chronology and other details. The moving tone
of all these narratives is clear and straightforward and perhaps they are the
best specimens for understanding the ordinary Babis, yet they are only of a

> limited use for the study of the formative years.              In the course of this study

•   _   _   _
brother Haji Mirza Jani but makes no note of Nuqtat al-Kaf or indeed any other
work by him. The- first few pages of a rare manuscript of this work in the
Minasian Collection, Wadham College Library, Oxford are missing and the whole
work is not free. ;from spelling mistakes.    It is not clear whether this is the
original copy.

Amongst the manuscripts preserved in the Iran National Baha'i Archive, the
memoirs of Sayyid Javad Muharrir and Aqa Sayyid ''Abd al-Rahim Isfahani, which

both appear to be part of a greater collection of narratives on the local Babi-
Baha'i history of Isfahan, also contain new information. Amongst the manuscripts
in Browne's collection, the accounts of Mulla Rajab rAli Qahir, Sayyid Mahdi
Dahaji and Mirza Muhammad

Javad Qazvini (translated by Browne in Materials)
basically deal with the events of the later period (after 1268), but nevertheless
they have scattered references to the early events.

Amongst the published sources, the personal account of Mulla Ja'far Qazvini
of the early years of the movement in Qazvin is of great value.           Being himself a
middle rank Shaykhi mulla before becoming a Babi in the first year of the movement,
he gives a revealing account, and in many ways is unusually forceful and
uninhibited about the Shaykhi-non-Shayki conflicts in Qazvin in the early 1840's,
as well as producing some fresh information on the life of Ahsa'i and Rashti, the

introduction of the Babi movement in Qazvin, its effects on the ''ulama and the
first waves of persecution in the city.      In between descriptions of the events he
also adds lengthy accounts of his own dreams and intuitive experiences, a good
demonstration of the Shaykhi-Babi mentality.
Another published account of this kind is that of Aqa Muhammad Mustafa

Baghdadi which was compiled at the request of Abul Fazl Gulpayigani.          He was an
Arab Babi (and later Baha'i) still in his early youth when his father, Shaykh
Muhammad Shibl Baghdadi, became one of the early Babi converts in Iraq and a

follower of Tahirih. In his narrative, which is compiled mainly on the basis of
his own and his father's recollections, he describes the mission of Bastami

to
^Atabat, and gives some valuable information about Tahirih  and her supporters,

particularly their journey from ''Atabat to Qazvin in which Baghdadi also
participated in the company of his father. He also supplies some new details on
the later events up to the end of the first period.
Finally the general account written by Mirza Yahya Nuri, Subh-i

Azal, entitled
Mujmal-i Badi^ dar Vaqayi (—i Zuhur-i Mani^ should be mentioned in this group.

This is a short account which was written in reply to several enquiries by Browne.
Though it contains some new details on the first eight years of the movement, in
general it adds little to the knowledge of the early period and therefore should

be treated as a brief recollection rather than a general account which intended
to express the Azali point of view.

These four groups of works which were written with the intention of recording
historical events, only form a part of the total corpus of primary sources. The
fifth group of the primary sources however are those early Babi works which are
mainly theological but contain scattered historical information. Of these, the
most important are the writings of the Bab himself. A large volume of books
(sdhifa) , commentaries (tafsir and shark} on Quranic verses and suras as well as

on Shi' i traditions, addresses (tawq-i^ , sermons (khutba) , prayers (du^a and

_   _                                                 •
munajat) , private letters, public statements and testimonies which were produced
by the Bab in the course of six years between 1260 and 1266 (1844-50) have been
examined for two main reasons.   First, from the theoretical point of view they
are the most reliable materials for the study of the Bab's own ideas and beliefs
and the way they changed in the course of this period. Secondly, from the
historical point of view, they contain frequent references, whether directly or
indirectly, to the Bab's personal character, his emotions, intimate revelations
and private reactions to people and events. Both these aspects are important for
a better understanding of the Bab and for going beyond the conventional image
presented in the chronicles and general accounts. They are also essential for
those aspects of early Babi history which were either totally ignored or
insufficiently discussed in other accounts. Without them, any attempt to study
the formative period of the movement is bound to remain immature and fragmentary.
When expressing his intuitive experiences, his emotions, his claimed 'mission'
and his impressions from his environment, he is honest and sincere though not
always intelligible or straightforward. In his works, he sometimes practices
taq-iyah merely to conceal his real claims from the dangers of a hostile environ­
ment, yet he often makes his point clear by adopting a symbolic language or by
using allusions and synonyms. Perhaps three successive phases can be
distinguished in the writings of the Bab. In his very early works between 1260
and 1261 such as Qayyum al-Asma* , Khasa'il Sab^a and even Sahifa Bayn al-Haramayn
he puts forward his early claims (and not his real claims) with clarity and
straightforwardness.   In his works between 1261 and 1263 (1845-7) however, such
as Sah-Cfah-yi ^Adliyah, Dala'il-i Sab^ah and a number of statements which he was
forced to write in Shiraz, he is cautious and prudent but not totally repentant.
In the works after 1263 (1847) such as the Persian and Arabic Bayan, Tawqi f
Qa'inriyat and Khutba al-Qahriya however, he fully abandons his policy of taqiyak
and openly declares his real claims.      In most of his works, his complex style
and his allusive and inconsequential remarks make it sometimes difficult for the
reader to follow the line of argument. Furthermore, preoccupation with numerology

and jafr, cryptic references to persons, places and dates, and his peculiar
and in many respects unprecedented terminology, make the study of his works a
formidable task. 'Yet in his own style, he is sometimes meticulous on dates and
chronology which he believed important to be recorded with accuracy. Most of
the writings of the Bab are still unpublished and those which are published are
out of print or difficult to obtain. Manuscript copies of some of his better
known works can be found in private and public collections including Browne's
collection, the Iran National Baha'i Archive and the British Library. Some less
known works of the Bab, including tracts, treatises and other miscellaneous works
are scarce and difficult to trace. The library of INBA contains some of these
works which are often bound in volumes without any systematic order and sometimes
together with the works of others. A manuscript copy of 32 letters of the Bab
also exists in Browne's collection. But perhaps most outstanding of all his
less well known works are those which are in private hands. A series of Xerox
publications for limited private circulation (here referred to as INBA, pub.) has
been made by INBA of some of these private collections. A few of these volumes
(nos. 40, 64, 67, 82, 91, 98) contain some of the early letters, addresses,
sermons and prayers of the Bab and are of special value for the early period.
Here in the course of this study no systematic attempt has been made to assess
the works of the Bab in general. Part of this task has been carried out by
Browne but the complete survey remains to be done.

In addition to the works of the Bab, some of the writings of his disciples
may also be looked at from an ideological or historical point of view. Among
them a short tract (Zuhur al-Haqq, pp.136-9) and a r-isala (see Bibl.) by Mulla
Husain Bushruyihi as well as some works of Mulla Muhammad 'Ali Barfurushi

including some Persian apologetic tracts (Zuhur al-Haqq, pp.407-18, 426-30) and

a collection of his works entitled Abhar al-Qudduslya (or Athar al-Quddusiya) are
worth mentioning. Of greater historical significance, however, are those early
apologies which were written in the first three years in order to vindicate the
claims of the movement in the face of the growing criticism from Shaykhi
opponents.
An Arabic risala in reply to Haji Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmani (most probably
in response to his first refutation Izhaq al-Batil} which was compiled towards
the end of 1262 (1846) by an unknown Babi who calls himself al-Qatil ibn al-
Karbala'i, is of exceptional value. Apart from some of the early works of the
Bab, perhaps this risala is the most important document for the study of the
early years that has recently come to light. Although Fazil Mazandarani published
the text of this work as an appendix to his Zuhur al-Haqq, neither he nor any one
else appears to have realised its historical significance.    It may be argued that

the unclear identity of the author would have diminished the extent to which
this work can be relied upon.     Fazil's usual vagueness on the origin of his
materials would certainly not help to resolve this ambiguity.     Yet it is not
unusual for a work of this nature with highly sensitive and sometimes
controversial claims to appear under a pseudonym if indeed al-Qatil was a pseudo­
nym and not the real name of a Babi writer who like many other Babis of the
early days has remained in obscurity.

As far as the text of the risala is concerned, the information, the style
and the argument remove the slightest doubts about its authenticity and the date
of its compilation.    This is the best example of the Shaykhi-Babi outlook in the
transitory period of 1844 to 1848 in the rAtabat.    Qatil himself claims to have
been a student of Rashti for ten years and no doubt the detailed information in
the text on Sayyid Kazim and his students, of whom many were his personal friends,

supports this claim.  A considerable amount of previously unknown details on the
religious milieu in the fAtabat, messianic ideas and claims of Rashti, the
tensions and conflicts within the Shaykhi circle particularly after the death of
Rashti, the intentions of Mulla Husain and his supporters, their social background

and their training, the proclamation at Shiraz and the formation of the first
Babi group, the return of the Babi disciples and the first declaration of the
movement in the 'Atabat and the responses from within and outside the Shaykhi
community, as well as the accurate dating of many events which otherwise would
have remained unknown, leave no doubt that Qatil himself was closely involved
with the early Babi activities.

From the theological point of view, his strong attacks on Kirmani's position
reveal the depth of the conflict between the two divided factions. The notice­
able absence thoughout the account of any direct reference to Qurrat al-^Ayn
(Tahirih) who by the end of 1262 was largely regarded as the leader of the

majority of the Babis in the ''Atabat on the other hand, may give the impression
that perhaps Qatil was not in favour of her unconventional views, and was even
inclined towards the opposite party of Sayyid 'Ali Bushr and the others who later
deserted the Babi ranks. Yet, such an assumption cannot easily be justified
since throughout his account, Qatil speaks with great respect of many of the firm
supporters of Tahirih.
Two other apologies, a r-isalih in Persian by Qurrat al-'Ayn and a maktub by
Shaykh Sultan Karbala'i, are written in the same period and in the same milieu

and follow the similar line of argument as Qatil but contain relatively less
historical information. Tahirih's irlsali'h, which is discussed at some length in
Chapter Five, like some other examples of her works, are valuable for tracing the
development of new trends in Babi thought.     In some instances the style and the

information of the Mdktub of Shaykh Sultan resemble those of the Qatil.    Their

common view is no doubt partly to be explained by the fact that they were
criticised from the same quarter. Refutations produced by Shaykhis and above all
by Haji

Karim Khan Kirmani, as well as the hostile propaganda of the
defected Babis, motivated some to search for theological proofs and historical
evidence.  The long list of refutations written by Haji Muhammad Karim Khan

started with his Izhaq al-Batil (Rajab 1261/September 1845), which is probably

the earliest non-Babi source on the early activities of the Babis, and continued
with Tir-i, Shihab (1262/1846), Shihab al-Thaqib (1265/1849) and Iqadh al-Batil

(1283/1866-7).   Regardless of his theological objections to the position claimed
by the Bab, which by itself is the subject of a separate study, in some of these
refutations, as in his other works, he gives important indications of those
activities of Babis which had caused him such anxiety and apprehension.

In his writings, Kirmani rarely paid any serious attention to the develop­
ments of the Shaykhi school in the earlier period, and contrary to the Babi
sources, seldom discussed the tensions and controversies with the Balasaris or
within the Shaykhis themselves. In this context the works of Rashti himself
provided some clues.  Though most of his works, both published and unpublished,
are devoted to answering theological queries and replying to criticisms of his
opponents, they frequently contain references which are essential for under­
standing Shaykhi millenarianism. The nature of the questions and answers reveals
the kind of issues with which the Shaykhis were preoccupied. One good example of
his works however, is Dalit al-Mutahayyirin, which was intended to vindicate the

Shaykhi position by examining the points of difference with Balasaris and hence
not only discussed the theological issues in dispute, but described the origin
and the development of the conflict.

The opposite view in the Shaykhi-Balasari dispute is expressed, among other
sources, in two of the important religious biographical dictionaries of the
period.  In a relatively long section in Qisas al-^Ulama' , Tunikabuni treats

Shaykhis in a partial and rather sarcastic language whereas Khwansari in Paudat

al-Jannat speaks of Ahsa'i with care and respect. Some fresh details may also be
obtained from Qisas al- fUlama' on the background of the Bab and the mission of

_           • •
Mulla ^Ali Bastami but in general the author borrowed most of his information
from Nas-ikh al-Tawarikh.   The real significance of this work, however, lies in
the kind of information it supplies on the social and political behaviour of the
fulama, a kind of information which is somewhat unusual for a religious work of
its type.   The anecdotes and details of everyday life of the ''ulama are initially
supplied by the author to enhance their glories.    In reality however, as far as
the biographies of his contemporaries are concerned, he is rendering an informal

picture which is highly revealing on those personal aspects which are so
characteristic of the ''ulama throughout the 19th century.   He is accused by some
of exaggerating and by others of under-estimating the real position of the ''ulama
and no doubt compared to Raudat al-Jannat, his standard of scholarship lags far
behind, yet it is through these very details that the characteristics of the
'ulama and their position in the society can be assessed. Of course this should
not be taken to mean that Q-isas al-^Ulama'is free from inaccuracies, gross
exaggerations and distortions, but nonetheless he is a more realistic, authentic
voice of the dominant Shar^ of the time.

Tarikh—i R-ijal-i Iran and biobibliographies such as al-Dhari^a and Ibrahimi's
Fihr-ist-i Kutub are of great value for obtaining further information on the
background of many of the personalities involved in the events of the early years.

The second set of primary sources are those European accounts which were
written during the course of the first eight years of the movement or immediately
after.  Of these the first group are the diplomatic dispatches and reports by
the British and Russian envoys in Iran and Iraq. The two envoys in Tehran and
their consuls and agents in other cities, paid no attention to the movment in its
early years simply because the Babis had not yet formed a significant group and
were not regarded as a serious threat to the security of the state. After 1264
(1848), however, as the Babis gained further strength and eventually came to an
inevitable confrontation with the government, the foreign envoys felt it
necessary to report 'the new schism in Mohammedanism' and its potential threats
to the country. One exception is the reports despatched by Rawlinson, then
Consul-General in Baghdad between 1844 and 1845 on the trial of Mulla ^Ali
Bastami. Yet they are few and not free from the usual inaccuracies of other
diplomatic dispatches, and they suggest Rawlinson's unfamiliarity with the Shi ^i
religious environment which in his case, being himself a scholar, is particularly
surprising.

Similarly, the reports despatched by Prince Dimitrii Dolgorukov the Russian
minister to Iran and those of Colonel Justin Sheil the British envoy (between
1839 and 1847 and again between 1849 and 1853) and his Charge d'affaires, Lieut.
Col. Frances Farrant (1847-9), suffer from the same weaknesses.     They are
scanty, misinformed and badly presented.     In some instances the causes of these
inaccuracies may be traced back to the agents and servants of the missions who
on matters concerning popular events were the envoys' main informants. But in
spite of their deficiencies, when these reports are studied in comparison with

other sources, they can be useful, particularly on the Babi resistances in
Tabarsi, Nayriz, Yazd and Zanjan or for other major events such as the
execution of the Bab and the assassination attempt of 1268 (1852) and its after­
math.   Dolgorukov's 25 dispatches (between 1848 and 1852), published as an
appendix to Ivanov's The Babi Uprisings in Iran, 1848-52, provide more systematic
reporting on the development of Babi militancy. These reports should also be
examined from the point of the envoys' intervention, both Russian and British,
in the policies of the central government towards the Babis and especially their
attitude when they considered their interests were being endangered.     One
example is Dolgorukov's request to the Iranian government in 1263 (1847) to
transfer the -Bab from the castle of Maku near the Russian frontiers, fearing that
his presence might create agitation and rebellion on both sides of the border.
Besides Dolgorukov's reports, some extracts of British and Russian reports were
also published by Nicolas ('Le Dossier russo=anglais de Seyyed Ali Mohammed dit
le Bab') and more recently by Baluyzi (The Bab) and Adamiyat (Amir Kabir va Iran).
Regardless of those reports specifically dealing with Babi events, the diplomatic
dispatches in this period provide a considerable amount of additional
information on matters which though not directly connected to the movement are of
great value for the study of the social, economic and political climate of the
time.

The second group of European primary sources are the early travel accounts,
memoirs and other published materials which either give eye-witness records of
specific events or more often provide fragmentary and highly confused general
accounts. Some like Polak, Vambery and Binning have a few pages on the Babis
which in spite of their inaccuracies or their bigotry are still useful for their
details of certain events.  The brief records of the American missionaries in
Azarbaijan (such as Wright) or those of other missionaries in other places (such
as Stern) add some details to our knowledge of the Bab and the Babis particularly
after 1264.  Most of these early sources were surveyed by E.G. Browne in his
A Traveller's Narrative (Note A, Section III) and his Materials (Section III),
yet a more careful and painstaking study of the less known accounts may reveal
more details.   An exception amongst these accounts is that of Lady Sheil which,
in spite of a certain confusion on the facts and misinterpretation of Babi ideas,
still remains a valuable source.   Some of the errors are identical to those in
Colonel Sheil's reports and particularly the special report of 21 June 1850
(F.O. 60/152, no.72) which claims to be based on two accounts given by 'a
disciple of the Bab 1 and by 'a chief priest' in Yazd which the report claims are
'correct' and 'can be trusted'.    In reality, however, they reflect the rumours
and fantasies then in circulation rather than observing the facts.     In this

respect, both the published accounts and the diplomatic reports are useful for
examining the impact of the movement on public opinion and for assessing the
fears and anxieties in government circles. Frequent identification of Babi
doctrine with 'socialism' and 'communism' in most of the accounts written in the
late 1840's and 1850's no doubt is to be explained by the fantasies of travellers
who were at pains to find Persian equivalents for the European revolutionaries
of the time rather than being based on facts. No doubt such a tendency, at least
in its primitive form, did exist among certain sections of the Babis, particularly
during and after Tabarsi,

but it is hard to believe that any of the diplomats
and writers were aware of it. Their accounts clearly betray the traces of
popular exaggeration and distortion.

Watson's account in A History of Persia, 1800-1858 (1866) also falls in the
same category. Though relatively free from exaggeration, the author being for
a while resident in Iran, missed the opportunity to produce a more original
account of the Babis and instead relied for most of his narrative on Nasikh at-
Tawavikh as well as on the British and possibly Russian diplomatic reports and
hence he reflects the strength and weakness of both sources.

If the information of diplomats and travellers was brief and fragmentary,
two important accounts by Arthur Gobineau and Alexander Kazem-Beg which appeared
in 1865 and 1866 respectively, to some degree compensate for these weaknesses.
Gobineau's Religions et Philosophies dans I'Asie Centrale is perhaps one of the
most significant primary sources, not so much because of its historical
narrative but for the author's general observations and interpretations. Being
himself a political philosopher of some significance and one ;f the founders of
what later emerged as the modern theory of racialism, during the time he spent
as the French envoy in Iran (between 1855 and '58 and again between 1861 and '63),
he devoted his attention to studying the 'intellectual' and 'emotional'
characteristics of the 'Oriental people' in order to prepare the ground for the
Europe to 'civilise' them, since in his view 'the political and material
interests' of the West were dependent on its relations with these nations.
Yet it is perhaps to his credit, that his colonialist attitudes are much more
advanced (and at the same time more refined) than the crude commercial
exploitation of the western powers which he sometimes deplores in his writings.
Such attitude ultimately affected his interpretation of the 'Asians' (by which
term he often meant Persians), yet he was still able, perhaps more than many of
his contemporaries, to make an intelligent and to some extent objective, if not
always impartial, observation of the intellectual and religious characteristics
of Persian culture.   In his long introduction which forms the first part of his
work he tries to distinguish and define the main intellectual axis of Persian

society, and broadly speaking, his efforts are not always unrewarded.     He regards
one of the main distinctions between the modern western mind and the 'Asian* way
of thought, to be the latter f s excessive preoccupation with metaphysics and the
world hereafter.     Persian culture, he believes, is the meeting point of various
ancient trends arid tendencies and the outcome of a long process of intellectual
diffusion.   In his view, the dominant concept of a world in which there is an
irreconcilable gap between appearance and reality is the key to understanding
the Persian obsession with the esoteric and 'hidden sciences', the practice
of taq-iyah and the fatalism prevalent in Shi^ism.    Perhaps for the first time in
western scholarship, he interprets Shi^ism as a manifestation of Persian
intellectual identity.    Moreover, he regards Sufism as the natural response of
the free thinkers to the domination of rational orthodoxy.

In some respects such broad generalisations may seem out-dated, unjustified
and even unfounded when set against the standard of modern scholarship, but
nevertheless they demonstrate the author's efforts to fit the rise of the Babi
movement in an intellectual framework which was largely unknown to other writers
of his time.

In the second part of his work, Gobineau produces a historical narrative of
the Babi movement.     As he himself confirms, his narrative is heavily based on
the account of Nasikh al-Tawarikh of which Sipihr provided a summary for his use.
But beyond doubt Gobineau had other sources at his disposal. Some direct
indications in the text as well as the nature of the additional materials suggest
that he obtained his information from Babi oral sources. As far as can be judged
from his account, he has not used and indeed was not aware of Nuqtat al-Kaf

or any     other Babi historical account. For the third part of his work in
which he deals with the 'doctrine of the Bab, he relied on the works of the Bab
and particularly a version of the Arabic Bayan of which he gives a full but not
always accurate translation under the title Ketab-e-Hukkam (Le Livre des
Pveceptes) in the appendix.

Gobineau regards the emergence of the Babi movement as a response to the
fulamas' misuse of power, their negligence and the general corruption in the
religious and civilian institutions.     Though his picture of the Bab sometimes
suffers from his idealistic presuppositions, and though to justify his views he
relies excessively on speculation and circumstantial evidence, he is nevertheless
able to grasp the movement's potential and also its limitations.     He repeats
most of Nas-ikh al-Tawar^ikh's errors and not being an accurate historian, adds
some of his own, yet his account provides some useful details.     On the internal
structure of the Babis he is the first source who refers to the Letters of Hayy

and one of the earliest to put the Bab's claims in a historical perspective. He
distinguishes between the Bab and his followers in respect of their attitudes
and their policies, and holds the latter as the real cause for confrontation with
the government. He is inattentive towards the social and economic background of
the movement and "perhaps even his image of the ^ulama and their position is not
close to reality, yet he rightly attributes the collapse of the movement to the
alliance between the 'ulama and the government. He emphasises the role of Amir
Kabir in such a way that it may occur to the reader that indeed he holds him as a
representative of a centralised bureaucratic power responsible for suppressing
the natural course of popular protest against the authorities. In his analysis
of Babi theory and doctrine he is reasonably accurate and skillful. Though he
misses many points, especially the significance of Shaykhism as the breeding
ground for Babi theory, he is still able to point out those aspects which
distinguish Babi thought from other contemporary trends. Gobineau tries to
understand the Babi movement in its historical and intellectual perspective and
he is far more successful than most of his contemporaries or indeed than many in
later generations. He was not a scrupulous historian or a first class scholar,
but possessed a sharp and inquisitive mind thanks to which some of his ideas
both on the Babi movement and on other issues, remain useful and even stimulating.

Similar to Gobineau, Kazem-Beg's account also heavily relies on Nasikh
al-Tawar'ikh and also tries to see the movement in an analytical framework. But
although he does not fall short of Gobineau in committing mistakes and making
bold interpretations, he largely lacks Gobineau's originality and clearness of
mind. His attempt to give a more systematic representation of the Babi history
has maintained its importance because of the additional information he was able
to inject into his account. He occasionally uses a manuscript of a Babi
narrative of Tabarsi in Mazandarani dialect by a certain unknown Shaykh al-'Ajam.

This is the manuscript obtained by Dorn during his sojourn in the province in
1860 and later described by him in the Bulletin de I'Academie Imperiale de St.
Petersbourg. Kazem-Beg believes that it is 'full of inexactitudes' and 'of no
historical value 1 , but no doubt if it were to become more widely available it
might reveal new details on Tabarsi which remained unknown even to Russian scholars
such as Ivanov who inexplicably has failed to make use of it. Moreover, Kazem-
Beg uses the memoirs and notes of two of his previous students, Sevruguin, 'who
for twenty years resided in Iran', and Mochenin, a Russian agent, who at the time
of the Bab's imprisonment in Chihriq in 1850, appears to have seen the Bab
addressing the public. On the basis of these memoirs, Kazem-Beg is able to add
some new information to his account which in some cases, such as the role of the
Babi disciples in the course of the events, remains unique. Yet the same sources,

especially Sevruguin's notes, seems to have been the cause of some of the
distortions and exaggerations in the text.       In distinguishing between the peace­
ful nature of the Bab's teachings and the militant tendencies of some of his
followers, Kazem-Beg is largely justified and indeed some of his speculations
may be supported:by strong indications in other sources, but no doubt his gross
exaggeration of the alleged 'mischievous' and 'deceitful' role of some of the
Babi disciples such as Sayyid Husain Yazdi, whom he accuses of forgery and

deception, are totally unfounded.       Such interpretations more than anything else
reflect Kazem-Beg's own conservative view which pictures the Bab as an inactive
and powerless instrument in the hand of his followers, in order to condemn the
Babis generally for a 'dangerous' and 'deviatory 1 militancy.

In spite of their poverty and deficiency, the European primary sources are
important for the study of Babi history not so much for what they have said but
for what they have not said.       Their position at least enabled them to observe
the movement from a different angle, relatively free from the accusations,
distortions and bigotry of the non-Babi sources as well as the emotional and
highly committed view of the Babi writers.

In addition to the two above mentioned categories, a third category may also
be identified, of those sources which fall in between primary and secondary
sources. These consist of general accounts, narratives, local histories and
memoirs which were written much later, often in the first two decades of the
present century and often by a generation of writers who themselves saw the last
survivors of the early Babi period and recorded their recollections. They are
not always accurate and consistent, but contain a considerable amount of new
historical detail and complementary information which previously remained un­
recorded.     A series of general accounts by Baha'i writers such as Shaykh Kazim

Samandar, Haji Muhammad Mu^in al-Saltanih and Mirza Abul Fail Gulpayigani are
part of these sources. Regardless of the general outlook of these writers which
makes their account milder in tone and less controversial in style, from the
point of historical value they are reasonably reliable but wherever possible
they should be still compared with earlier sources.       Mu^in al-Saltanih's

general
history (Tarikh) which was finally completed o-L^ca 1340 Q./1921-2 contains some
fresh information on the background and the early development of the movement in
Azarbaijan.       He also frequently quotes from the now unobtainable Abwab al-Huda
of Mulla Muhammad Taqi Hashtrudi - a very valuable narrative by an early Shaykhi-
Babi who himself witnessed many events and knew many of the early disciples.
Confusions and obvious errors committed by Mu^in al-Saltanih, however, make one

particularly cautious about those details which are outside the sphere of his
personal experience or given without specifying his authority.       This is an

unpublished account which was originally intended to cover the events up to the
time of the author but in fact comes down to the end of Tabarsi.       The second

of the two copies in INBA (MS.A), which is the revised version by the author
himself, runs to 566 pages.

Samandar's Tainkh is also a relatively long account (370 pp. in its
published form) which is written in two parts.       The first part was in six
chapters compiled in 1303 Q. (1885-6) and deals with the history of his own
family, the Babis of Qazvin and part of his memoirs.       The second part was compiled
in 1332-3 (1913-14) and is mainly arranged under biographical headings of more
than seventy early Babis and Baha'is but also contains a considerable amount of
new information both on the early period of the movement and on the later
developments of the Baha'i-Azali controversy.       Born in 1268 Q. (1852) and son of
a celebrated Babi Shaykh Muhammad Nabil Akbar Qazvini, he was a merchant of some

significance in Qazvin.   In many instances his account clearly reflects his
mercantile outlook.   He based his narrative chiefly on his own eye-witness
experiences, his interviews with some of the surviving Babis of the early period,
and the scattered information he gathered in his home town Qazvin. He is
reasonably accurate and reliable on the Babis of Qazvin and not only supplies
fresh details on the well known Babis, but introduces a number of new characters
and describes new events which were either unknown or were barely referred to in
other sources.
Abul Fazl Gulpayigani's Tartkh-i Zuhur etc. is a brief introductory account

which was compiled in the style of Maqalih-i Shakhs-i Sayyah some time in the

early years of this century.       In the first two parts of this work, which cover
the history of the 'Babi religion' and the 'Baha'i religion' up to 1892, the year
of Baha'allah's death, the author clearly distinguishes between the two currents
though he is careful to establish an intellectual link as well as a historical
continuity between the two.       This is an important distinction which the Baha'i
writers of the time had made in order to defend themselves against the
accusations of deviation and deception levelled by the Azalis. But unlike the
impassioned tone of Hasht Bihisht, in reply to which, it appears, this account
was written, the tone of the writer is moderate and unoffensive.       The original
MS. of this work in INBA in Gulpayigani's own handwriting is 74 pages.       His
Hujaj al-Bdhiya translated into English as The Baha-i Proofs seems to be based on

this work.
More important for the study of the early period is his Kashf al-Ghita' which

was completed after Abul Fail's death by his nephew Sayyid Mahdi Gulpayigani.
This is a controversial Baha'i apologia which initially aimed at resolving the
problem of Nuqtat al-Kaf and demonstrating the distortions and forgeries

committed in the text.   Though in many ways it makes a valuable contribution to
the knowledge of the early period, and though in some instances the authors are
successful in showing discrepancies in the text of Nuqtat al-Kaf, in general they
created new problems and committed new errors rather than being able to resolve
the distortions of the allegedly doubtful passages.     The Kashf al-Ghita* r s basic

argument, particularly on the section written by Abul Fazl Gulpayigani seems
convincing enough to justify the author's doubts on the originality of those
passages which enhance Subh-i Azal's position, yet the whole tone of this work is

so much charged with religious zeal that it can hardly defend its argument from
an impartial viewpoint. Part of the criticism in this work is directed towards
Browne's introduction to Nuqtat al-Kaf, which the authors argue was exceeding the

limits of scholarly investigation by accusing the Baha'i writers of forgery and
distortion without providing any viable evidence.     Abul Fazl believes, perhaps
with some justification, that Browne's criticism of the Baha'is is more the
result of Azali influence than based on historical fact. As far as the events
and characters of the early period are concerned, Kashf al-Gh-ita' adds a

valuable contribution. In some instances Abul Fazl obtained his fresh
information from Haji Sayyid Javad Karbala'i whom the author met towards the end

of his life. In spite of its defects and confusions, Kashf al-Ghita* is a useful

source for the critical study of Nuqtat al-Kaf or indeed for many other sources

on the early history of the movement.

Beside the above mentioned works, some of the treatises by Gulpayigani such
as Risalih-'i. Iskandai"Cyih have occasional interesting points. Another work by
Ahmad Suhrab on the life of the Bab entitled al-Risala al-Tis^a ^Ashariya, which
is a collection of nineteen talks delivered in Haifa around 1918-19, is also of
some use.  Tadhkirat al-Wafa 3 of ^Abd al-Baha' is a collection of 71 biographies
compiled in 1915 on the lives of the early Babi-Baha'is. Though this work is
mainly concerned with those Babis who after 1268 emigrated to Baghdad and then
followed Baha'allah in his exile to Adrianople and Acre, it also gives many
references to earlier events and has entries under Qurrat al-^Ayn, Nabil Zarandi
and others.

A series of narratives on the local history of the Baha'i communities through­
out Iran, which are often based on the accounts and memoirs of the older
generation, is also recorded in this period. Among them the narrative of Mirza
Habiballah Afnan on Shiraz is of special value since it throws new light not only

on the early life of the Bab but on other Babis of Fars. Fu'adi's history of
the Babi-Baha'i community of Khurasan which was compiled in 1931, relies both on
local written and oral   accounts and is of great value for the study of the Babis
of Khurasan.   The author, himself originally from Bushruyih and educated in

Ashkhabad, made some effort to produce his history in a systematic way.        The MS.
in INBA consists of 462 pp. and is divided        into ten chapters under different
regions and gives- detailed accounts of the history of the towns and villages
of Khurasan.

Two accounts; of the local history of Azarbaijan are written by Mirza Haydar
^^   _                                                                  •
'Ali Usku'i and Aqa Muhammad Husain Milani. The first one which was compiled in

1343 (1924-5) is a relatively short account (INBA. MS. 25pp.) based on Haydar

fAli's own memoirs of the Babis and Baha'is of Usku, Milan and other parts. The
account of Muhammad Husain Milani, however, which was written shortly after

Usku'i, is more comprehensive. The first part is an independent account (INBA>
MS. Ill pp.) divided into four parts and deals with the Babi- Baha'i missions to
Azarbaijan, the important converts, the 'martyrs' of Azarbaijan and finally the
main events regarding the history of the community in this province. The second
part contains the additional notes on Usku'i's account (26 pp.). Both authors are
mainly concerned with the events of the late 19th and early 20th centuries but
supply useful inforamtion on the people, -places and events of the earlier period,
Other local accounts by Natiq Isfahani on Kashan (1309 Sh., 75 pp.), Zaraqani on

Tehran, Ishraq Khavari on Hamadan also add some new details to the early history
of the local communities. These local accounts and many others on other parts
such as Yazd and its vicinity, Rasht and Isfahan are important because they expand
the sphere of Babi history beyond the central themes and enable us to know more
about the less well known Babis and the less well known events.

Two other works by non-Babi writers may also be included in this category.
Za fim al-Daula's Miftah Bab al-Abwab is an Arabic work published in 1903 as an

abridged version of a longer unpublished account entitled Bab al-Abwab. He was
the editor of the Persian weekly Hikmat which was published in Cairo at the turn

of the century. Part of his work was again based on Nasikh al-Tawar-ikh but he
also used other less known or quite unknown sources. He was the son of Mulla
Muhammad Taqi and grandson of Mulla Muhammad Ja ''far Tabrizi. Both his grand-

father and his father were amongst the Gilama present at the Bab's trial of
1848 in Tabriz, and as he himself confirms, part of his more reliable information
is drawn from his grandfather's narrative of his interrogations of the Bab which
were carried out presumably sometime between 1264 and 1266. He also counts
amongst his sources a copy of the narrative of Haji Mirza Jani (without specifying

any title) which he particularly maintains has no indication of the succession of
Subh-i Azal or Baha^allah.   Though he might have inserted this remark with some

attention to Browne's opposite views        expressed in his introduction to The
Tarikfy-i Jadid of which Za Tm al-Daula was certainly aware, this is still a piece
of interesting evidence on the problem of Nuqtat al-Kaf. Besides his written

sources, Za^im al-Daula also met Baha'allah, ^Abd al-Baha* and some well known
Baha'is of his time, including Nabil Zarandi in Haifa. He also met Subh-i Azal

in Famagusta.   Throughout the 181 pages in which he deals with the early
history of the Babi movement, he is reasonably impartial and objective though

:

he occasionally : makes gross mistakes and bold exaggerations. In some respects,
his views have been influenced by the ideas and teaching of Sayyid Jamal al-Din
Afghani and Shaykh Muhammad ^Abduh of whom he speaks with great respect.

Occasionally such influences led him to pass unjustified judgements on the ideas
and activities of the Babis.

A brief reference should also be made to an Azali work entitled Hasht
Bihisht. This is a relatively long work produced circa 1890. It is originally
designed to vindicate the Babi-Azali position which towards the end of the 19th
century was seriously overshadowed by the spread of Baha'i teachings. Through­
out the course of the Book the effort of the writer or writers (since it is
alleged that this work was written by Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kirmani or Aqa Khan

_   _                                      •

Kirmani or both of them) is to reintroduce the Babi theology and orthodoxy in a
style and language comprehensible to late 19th century Persian intelligentsia.
Yet in interpreting both the theory and practice of the Babi religion they are
predisposed to those ideas which at the time were popular in Persian
intellectual circles outside Iran. As far as the historical value of this work
is concerned, a brief and somewhat confused account of the early Babi history
provided in Chapter Eight of this work demonstrates the relatively weak standard
of Azali historiography. Yet it still contains some interesting points. The
ugly and offensive language of the writer in the latter part of this chapter
which is marred by distortions and accusations against the Baha'is, further
illustrates the depth of the Baha'i-Azali conflict in the closing decades of
the 19th century.

Persian and Arabic secondary sources form the fourth category. Here no
attempt has been made to survey all these accounts since most of them are of
little historical value.   The main focus however, is on those secondary sources
which contain less accessible or unaccessible primary materials. Zuhur  al-Haqq

of Fazil Mazandarani is a voluminous work of nine volumes on the Babi-Baha'i
history during its first century of which only Volume III (published circa 1944)
and Parts One and Two of Volume VIII (published 1975-6) are available. Volume III
is a biographical dictionary arranged alphabetically under names of provinces
and refers to more than 660 Babis and other important characters of the first
eight years of the movement.  It is based not only on the better known
chronicles and general accounts (including the Persian text of Nabil Zarandi's
narrative) but also on local histories, memoirs and writings of the Bab and

early Babis.     Less than half of this work (240 pp. out of 532 pp.) is a full or
partial citation of fresh materials most of which cannot be found in any other
source.  It is this access to the less known sources which makes Zuhur al-Haqq

an important work for the study of the early period. Yet in some ways Fazil is
a less than meticulous historian who is at the same time bound within the limits
of a traditional historiography.        He makes errors on dates and personalities,
and almost never discusses the origins of his sources.

Another attempt to compile a general history is a two volume work by Avarih
entitled Kawakib al-Durriya which was published in 1923-4. The first volume
deals with the Babi-Baha'i history up to the end of Baha'allah's time; the
second volume comes down to the end of ^Abd al-Baha's period.        As far as the
history of the early period is concerned, Kawakib contains less fresh material
and less new detail than Zuhur al-Haqq though it exceeds the latter in the

number of historical errors and inaccuracies.       But nevertheless it is a
valuable source for study of particular events and characters. Other Baha'i
works such as Malik Khusravi's Tarikh-i Shuhada-yi Amr and Iqlim-i Nur, Fayzi's
Khandan—i Afnan and Hazrat—i Nuqtih-i Ula, Ishraq Khavari's Nurayn-'i Nayyirayn,

Qamus—i Iqan and other works are essential for the study of particular aspects
of early Babi history. In these more recent works, the authors follow the
earlier traditions of Baha'i historiography in their efforts to soften the
militant tone of the early Babi history.

The non-Baha'i secondary sources however, for the greater part, consisted
of a wide range of refutations or polemics which are designed to discredit Babi
history rather than add anything to our understanding. Their attitude is
hostile, their use of the sources biased and their facts are distorted. Even
compared to the earlier refutations of a more traditional kind their standard
is surprisingly low. A good example of these traditional refutations is Husain

Quli Jadid al-lslam's Minhaj al-TaUb-in which was published in 1320 Q. (1920-3).

In spite of its hostile and offensive tone, it still contains some new
information, including some uncommon examples of the Bab's writings.

A small group of writers who tried to give a more scholarly character to
their narratives should also be mentioned. Some like Hasani's al-Babiyun wa

al-Baha'7.yun and Mudarrisi Chahardihi's Shaykhigar-i va Babigari were able to
give a reasonably balanced version of the events.       The latter adds some
valuable new information to both Shaykhi and Babi history.       K asravi's
Baha 3 igari, is a short polemic of little historical value.     In his criticism of
the Bab and the Babis, he hardly considers the historical and intellectual
circumstances.    His judgement no doubt was partly influenced by his own vision
of Pakd-ini.

A more distorted treatment of Babi history may be observed in Adamiyat's
chapter on the Bab (Dastan-i Bab} in his Amir Kabir va Iran. Though in his
introduction, the author promises to pursue an 'analytical method free from
bigotry' and claims that his 'historical analysis' is 'realistic' and 'rational',
he by no means is prepared to apply these much vaunted values in his own account.
Besides his obvious errors in historical fact which demonstrates his insufficient
knowledge and his careless methodology, throughout this chapter he does not
hesitate to use a highly polemical and indeed offensive language in describing
the ideas and activities of the Babis. Referring to the Bab's ideas as 'a sack-
full of straw' which has no bearing on 'the world of knowledge and thought' and
by calling the Babi fighters in Zanjan 'miserable idiots' and Babis themselves
'charlatans', 'murderers', 'executioners' and 'villains', he indeed gives a very
real picture of the present state of that school of modern Iranian historiography
of which he regards himself a pioneer. Still worse is his so-called 'analytical
method' (ravish-i tahlili') which is an extraordinary mixture of a dated and mis-
understood version of the 'philosophy of progress', and a strong urge for
centralization of power which betrays itself in his glorification of Amir Kabir
and a good deal of common naivete and delusion. His total obsession with this
idealised picture of Amir Kabir prevents him from maintaining a balanced view,
let alone understanding the historical significance of any opposite current.

A few words should be added about the secondary works in European languages.

The earliest and perhaps the most significant are the works of E.G. Browne and
A.L.M. Nicolas. Though he never attempted to compile a history of the Babi
movement, Browne's efforts in translating, editing, identifying, and publishing
the Babi, Baha'i and Azali sources were of great importance in preparing the way
for a more comprehensive understanding of the Babi history. He was the first
scholar who seriously undertook the study of the Babis and dedicated a great
deal of his time and effort to introducing it to others. As he himself indicates,
one of his first attractions towards Iran, or indeed towards the 'mysterious East'
by which he was fascinated after reading Gobineau's work, was his interest in
The Babis.  Unlike many of his contemporaries, he writes with great sympathy and
understanding towards Persians in general and Babis in particular. Most of his
writings, including his A Year Amongst the Persians, and the introductions to his
translations of Babi works, bear witness to this attitude. He was an orientalist
in the traditional sense of the word. In his four books and three long articles
on Babis, he often rendered an accurate translation and a careful edition. More­
over, he added a bulk of useful notes and comments on sources, the history and
the ideology of the movement. His criticism of the Baha'is in the Azali-Baha'i
controversy, which perhaps occupies more than its fair share in his introductions

to both The New History and Nuqtat al-Kaf, is moderated to a more balanced view
> in his Materials for the Study etc. and A Literary History of Persia (vol.IV).

He seldom attempts to interpret the Babi history in an analytical way and indeed
never claims to be a historian in the more modern sense, yet some of his general
comments particularly in his later works are to be taken into account.

Nicolas, a French diplomat who spent most of his life in Iran and served as
> Consul-General for 35 years in various cities of Iran (died 1937) , shares this
> sympathy and understanding with Browne, but in some respects lacks the same
> scholarly standards. In the course of his long acquaintance with Babi history,
> he published a number of translations which start with the Bab's Data 3 il-i Sab ^ah
> entitled Le Livre des Sept Preuves de la Mission du Bab and continue with
> translations of the Arabic Bayan (1905) and the Persian Bayan (1911-14). His most
> important work however, is his Seyyed Ali Mohammed dit le Bab (1905), which is a
> general history of the first phase of the movement up to 1854. Besides general
> chronicles and better known accounts, the author also used a number of written
> and oral sources which make his account an important contribution to the history
> of this period. At the beginning of his work, Nicolas gives a list of his sources,
but throughout the text he often fails to specify them. His careless and some­

times disorganised presentation to some extent reduces the value of his work,
but still in many parts, including his accounts of the upheavals of Zanjan and
Nayriz, the execution of Tahirih and the events of 1268 (1852), it remains an
irreplaceable source. His use of the writings of the Bab is also important since
he had access to some of the private correspondence of the Bab. But again here,
his references are unclear and his translations are not always accurate.

Since the early decades of the present century other works have also been
produced on the subject. H. Roemer's Die Babi-Baha*i (1912) is a German work
devoted to the study of the Babi theology. It is based on the major writings of
the Bab and makes a careful survey of the Shaykhi background of the movement, its
millenarian significance, its relationship to Sufi and theosophic trends, its
teachings and its political ideology. Roemer pays little attention to the
historical aspect of the movement and still less to putting Babi theory into its
historical context. Tag's Le Babisme et I'Islam (1942) is another study which
concentrates on the theological aspects. Writing with some degree of Islamic
commitment, the author distinguishes between the Babi theory and the Islamic
orthodoxy by emphasising the heterodox nature of the former. Though little is
given to establish any link, whether theoretical or historical, between the Babis
and the earlier heterodox trends, the author, mainly on the basis of earlier
speculations and suggestions, tends to regard them as the continuation of the
same deviatory and 'foreign' tendencies. His thorough study of the principles as

well as the details of Babi theory in comparison to Islamic beliefs, in which
he appears to be closer to a fundamentalist Sunni position than to a Shi'i
approach, in many ways helps to a better understanding of such a distinction.

Other more recent works have also attempted to interpret the rise of the
Babi movement and its development in social, economic and political terms.
Ivanov's The Babi Uprising in Iran (1939) pioneers a new socio-economic approach.
Keddie's 'Religion and Irreligion in Early Iranian Nationalism 1 suggests some
form of continuity between the movement and the later developments in the course
of modern Iranian history. Algar's chapter in Religion and State in Iran
discusses the responses of the ''ulama and their role both in the formation and
the suppression of the movement. A detailed survey of these works and many other
works on the subject is beyond the scope of this study. Most of them use well
known primary and secondary sources and add little to our knowledge from the
point of historical fact. However, they are of value for their attempt to
analyse and interpret the Bab and the Babi movement from different angles.
