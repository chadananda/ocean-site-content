Thesis Statement

The goal of 1his project is 10 understand and comprehend the philosophy of the Baba 'i Faith and it's literature. From
tills knowledge. l hope 10 mvesugate the issue of transforming a specific Baha'i text into an architectural form. At this point.
my job is no1only10 be an architect but also a rranslator. To be able 10 create an architecrural language. which is a derivative
of the philosophy and 1hc writings of the Baha 'i Fai1h.

The piece oi literature which I have chosen based on considerable research and understanding of the Faith, is the
Seven Valleys ofBaha ·u 'I/ah. This text in acruality is a lener wrinen at a very important time of the commencement of the
Baha'i Faith. It was wrinen by Baha'u'llah. the Founder/Prophet of the Faith. and it's text was considerably influenced by sufi
thought and mysticism. The dominating centerpiece of His lerrer. as its primary vehicle of expression uses the metaphor of the
Seven Valleys found in Faridu ·o-Din Anar's most famous work. The Conference of the Birds. The thesis uses the original text
by Attar for the design of the Institute.

lo this. the issues of light color. texture. and interior spatial relationships. become very important tools of translat-
ing the Baha'i spiritual literature into architectural spaces.

> "Just as the dimension ofthe soul is depth. not breadth, so the dimensions of an interior may
> well exist below or above the physical limits ofits geometry. " Steven Holl

At a larger scale. in terms of the city, this project begins to explore the issue of the city edge. To invesitgate the
possibility of creating space. where city and the natural landscape overlap and create a boundary or a membrane. The
objective is to create space. not an object. where the building/space becomes the mediator between the city and the water.
Again. at this level the building becomes a lexicon. acting as the translator between city and nature.

There is a need to explore che possibilities of the city edge, where the land has become left over space, residual with
no fonn of use, hierarchy or mediation between the two worlds of the metropolitan city and the natural landscape. This will
be the opportunity to develop strategies to transform these types of spaces and revitalize them. These spaces could act as
the visions into the future growth and expansion of the city.

Currently the only existence of an edge. are the major highways which occupy this transitional slice of land. the
West Side Highway on the western boundary ofManhanan Island. and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, which serves as the
major cranspotation root on the eastern boundary.

Project Topic

The title of this project is The World Baha' i Instirute in New York. This title, I beleive clearly and concisely states the
program and the s ite.

The location and program of this project is very important. The site is located on the water's edge, along the Franklin
D. Roosevelt Drive, stretching perpendicularly across five blocks of Midtown Manhattan. Specifically between 35th and
39th streets, only three blocks to the south of the United Nations. The worldwide Baha' i community manages it's relations
wi th the outside world through the offices of the Baha ' i International Community. The immediate proximity to the United
Nations, represents the history of the relations between the Baha' i Faith and the United Nations.

Some of the history involves a number of World Peace conferences at the United Nations, which have been
organized and led by the Baha' is from all over the world.Therefor, this Institute will house the offices involved with the
United Nations, and other organizations.

However, besides the presence of these offices. other important programmatic elements are also included to com-
plete the functions of this Institute. The building's most important function is to be a learning center, which through spatial
and programmatic experience, will engage the occupier. and teach of the history and the ideology of the Baha' i Faith. Therefor
along with administrative elements, a library, learning center and classrooms are also included in the Institute.

The final element which compositionally and sequentially unites the building, is the memorial which commemorates
the tens of thousands ofBaha' is who have been executed through persecution during the 150 year history of the Baha'i
Faith. These series of spaces also include spaces of contemplation for prayer and detachment.

Backgr ound on the Baba ' i Faith

Bab:

The origins of the Baha'i Faith go back to a religious movement founded in AD 1844 by a young Iranian merchant,
ayyid Ali Muhammad Shirazi ( 1819- 1850). who took the title of the Bab (the Gate). His followers were therefore called Babis.

In 1844. in Shiraz m the south of Iran. the Bab gathered around himself a group of eighteen disciples whom he named the
.. Leners of the Living··. The Bab dispersed the Letters of the Living throughout Iran and surrounding countries to spread his
message. while he himselfset offon the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1844.

After his anouncement of his message, for the most part he was generally ingnored. But despite these early
setbacks. the message of the Bab spread throughout Iran.Thousands became followers. including many religious scholars of
Islam.

l.n che Muslim religion there is a belief that exactly 1000 years after the 11th Imam. ordesipleofMohammad, the 12th
Imam will anive to create the transition between the old religion and a new revelation. The cycle of the 11 Imams, was exactly
260 years, and on the Islamic year of 1260 the 12th, or the "Hidden Imam", was introduced as the Bab.

However, there was an opposition on this movement by the Shi'ite leaders of the Persian government. From then,
Bab was imprisoned. During the time o f his imprisonment, he wrote the ''Babyan". This described the advent o f the " Mani-
fesration of God who was to come after Him.". This identity was a crucial factor in the Bab's teaching and especially in the
development of the future Baha ' i movement. The purpose of the Bab was to provide the way for Baba'u' llah 's revelation.

The Bab was tortured and effortS were made to confice him to abandon his mission. and thousands of his followers
were persecuted.

In 1850, the new Shah oflran decided that the only way of stopping this religious movement would be to execute the
founder. They therefore had the bab brought to Tabriz and suspended in a public square n front of a firing squad, be was
martyred. This however, did not stop the persecutions of the Babis. Thousands more were tortured and killed in the next few
years.

Baha' u' Uab:

In 1863, after constant conflict and persecution of the Babis. Husayn Ali Nuri, the son of a prominent Iranian
nobleman, assumed leadership of the Babis, and proclaimed himself as ..Baba ' u ' llah" (the splendor of God). Baha 'u ' llah
being the founder of the Baha'i Faith, was born in Tehran on the 12th of November in the year 1817. In the first year of the
Bab's mission, 1844, Baba' u ' llah became an enthusiastic supporter of the new teachings. When the Babis began to be
persecuted. Baba'u' llab also suffered and wsa arrested several times and beaten. In 1852, be wsa arrested and thrown into an
underground pit called the Siyah Cbal.

It was during this time in the Siyab Chai when a visionary experienced occured to him which marks the start of his
mission.This occurance in the Baha' i Faith is seen as equivalent to the Burning Bush, to the Dove that descended upon
Jesus, to the enlightenment of the Buddha under the Bo tree, and to the first appearance of the Angel Gabriel to Muhammad.

The Vision ofBaha' u' llah in the Siyah Chai

> While engulfed in tribulations I heard a most wondrous, a m ost sweet voice, calling above My head. Turning
> My face, I beheld a Maiden-the embodiment of the remembrance ofthe name of My Lord-suspended in the
> air before Me. S o rejoiced was she in her very soul thal her countenance shone with the ornament of the good
> pleasuer of God, and her cheeks glowed with the brightness of the A ll-Merciful B etwixt earth and heaven she
> was raising a call which captivated the hearts and minds ofm en. She was imparting to both My inward and
> outer being tidings which rejoiced My soul, and the souls of God 's honoured servants. Pointing with her
> finger unto My head, she addressed all who are in heaven and all who are on earth, saying: 'By God/ This is
> the Best-Beloved ofthe worlds, and yet ye comprehend not. This is the Beauty of God amongs you, and the
> power of His sovereignty within you, could ye but understand. This is the Mystery of God and His Treasure,
> the Cause of God and His glory unto all who are in the kingdoms of R evelation and ofcreation, ifye be of
them that perceive. '(Quoted in S lioghi Effendi, God Passes By, pp. J01-2)

Although most of the Babi prisoners in the Siyah Chai were executed, Bah' u ' llah's life was spared because of his
high social position. Shortly after, Baha' u ' llah was released from imprisonment on the condition that he would go into exile.
The choice was offered for him to go to Russian territory, but he preferred co go to Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Baha' u' llah prodeeded to revitalize the Babi community. For two years between 1854 and 1856, he
withdrew to the mountains of Kurdistan. Here he explored, and studied mystical themes. He was a guest in a Sufi retreat, and
after his return to Bagdad. he maintained his contact with some of these Sufis. His two main mystical works, the Seven Valleys
and the Four Valleys, were writen to two Sufi leaders of this time.

The Iraninan authorities made representations to the Ottoman govemmenr about the presence and increasing
influence of Baha' u'llah in Baghdad, close to the Iranian border. Orders eventually came that Baha'u ' Uah was to go to
Istanbul. the capital of the Ottoman Empire.

His exile in Istanbul was short however. after three months he was sent to Edim (Adrianople) in European Turkey.

It was here where Baha' u' Uah openely announce his claim to be the one foretold by the Bab and the inaugurator of a new
religious beginning. He sent his followers to Iran to publicize this claim among the Babis, almost all of whom are now Baha' is.

In 1867, orders came that Baha'u' Jlah and his companions were to leave Edime.They were taken to Gallipoli and put
aboard a ship. Eventually they arrived in the prison-city of Akka in Palestine.

In A.kka, Baha'u' llah was at first imprisoned in the citadel for two years, but when that building was required for
other purposes . he was placed in a succession of houses in the city under house arrest. It was in these circumstances that
Baha 'u ' llah wrote his most important book, the Kitab-i-Aqdas (the Most Holy Book), in which be outlined his main religious
laws. This was followed in the next two decades by a series of writings (tablets as they are called by the Baha' is) in which he
gave the distinctive teachings of his religious dispensation.

In 1877, Baha'u'Uah was finally allowed to move outside the city walls, and in 1879, he took up residence in the
mansion ofBahji just outside of Akka.

The last years ofBaha ' u' llah's life were spent in writing and dictating numerous works; receiving the pilgrims that
came in increasing numbers; and directing the affairs of his religion. The religion itself was now gradually spreading into
Egypt, Anatolia, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and India. Even in Iran, despite episodes of persecution from time to time, the
religion was spreading among all classes and in all parts of the country.

Baha' u ' llah passed away on the 29th of May in 1892 in the mansion ofBahji and was buried in a nearby house. He
was seventy-four years of age and had spent forty of those years as a prisoner and in exile. His shrine is regarded by the
Baha' is as the holiest place on earth.

Abdu'I-Baba:

Before his passing, Baha'u ' llah appointed his eldest son Abdu'l-Baha. as the leader of the Baha' i community, and
the sole authorised interpreter of his writings. Abdu 'l-Baha whose given name was Abbas. was born in Tehran on May 23rd
in 1844, the same day in the same year that the Bab began his mission.

During the early years of Abdu' l-Baha's ministry. the Baha' i Faith was taken to North America. By the tum of the
twentieth century, there was a community of several thousand Baha'is in North America. Some small groups also arose in
Europe. This turning point in the Baha'i Faith demonstrated that the Faith was capable of appealing to people outside the
cultural world of the Middle East to which it bad been confined up to that point in time. After he was freed in 1908, Abdu'l-
Baha moved to Egypt for a while before setting offon the first of two journeys to theWest. In the first journey in 1911. Abdu' 1-
Baha visited France and England. Then in 1912-13, he visited North America, Great Britain, France, Gennany, and Hungary. He
spoke on many of the issues of that time: peace, women's rights, racial equality and other matters.

Finally in 1913, Abdu'l-Baha returned to Haifa a year before the first World War. During these war years,
Abdu' 1-Baha wrote the Tablets of the Divine Plan. laying down his instruction for the world~wide spread of the Baha' i Faith.

Abdu' l-Baha passed away on November 28th, 1921 , and was buried in one of the rooms of the shrine of the Bab.
Baha'i Beliefs and Teachings

Tue Baha'i Faith is a global religion followed by millions of Baba.is from virtually every country on earth. The
teachings ofBaha 'u ' llah, the Prophet-Founder of the Baba' i Faith, unite men and women of various religious. ethnic, national
and class origins into one diverse community working 10 promote the unity of humankind and the setablishment of peace in
the world . Baha' u' llah's vision for global peace and unity is practised today within Baha' i Communities throughout the
world.

Baha' is perceive a common thread underlying all religion. implying an essential universal message which fonns the
basis of all religions. Each successive religion. carries a progressive unfolding message, and each new one draws from and
revitalizes those of the past.

Baha ' is believe in one God and that knowledge of God is attained through the Divine Manifestations. Baha' is
compare the Manifestations to a mirror, when held to the sun. a mirror reflects it's light, therefor the Manifestations "reflect''
the light, wisdom, and knowledge of God.

> Every few centuries a great Divine Revea/er--a Krishna. a zoraster, a Moses. a Jesus, a Muhammed-appear in
> the East, like a spiritual sun, to illumine the likened minds ofmen and awaken their dormant souls...

Baha' is believe that Baha' u ' llah is the Manifestation of God for this age, and Baha' u ' llah was universal in his
religious scope; therefor aJI the Holy writings of the world's religions are also held sacred.

Principles of the Baba 'i Faith:

> - The oneness of the world and humanity.
> - The protection and guidance of the Holy Spirit.
> - The foundation of all religions as one.
> - Religion must be the cause of unity.
> - Religion must accord with science and reason.
> - Independent investigation of truth.
> - Equality between men and women.
> - The abandoning of all prejudices among mankind.
> - Universal peace.
> - Universal education.
> - A universal language.
> - Solution of the economic problem.

-An international tribunal.

Laws ofBaba'u'llab:

> - Obligation of daily prayer.
> - An annual fasting period of 19 days.
> - Prohibition of use ofalcoholic liquor or drugs.
> -Monogamy.
> - Marriage contingent upon the consent of all four parents.
> - Obedience to civil government.
> - Obligation to engage in useful trade, art or profession.

- Prohibition of a clergy in the Baba' i Faith.
Importance of Numbers and Rituals/Symbols

Number 9:

A simple nine-pointed star is generally used by Baha' is as a symbol of the Faith. The number nine bas a significance
in the Baha' i Revelation. Nine years after the announcement of the Bab in Shiraz, Baba' u 'llab received the intimation o f His
mission in the dungeon in Tehran (Siyab Chai). Nine, as the highest single-digit number, symbolizes completeness and
fulfillment. Since the Saha' i Faith claims to be the fulfillment of the expectations ofall prior religions, this symbol, as used for
example in nine-sided Baha·i temples, reflects that sense of fulfillment and completeness. There are also nine doors at the
House of Worship in Wilmene. Illinois. and the other Baba ' i temples. Each or these doors also represent one of the nine great
world religions.

> 1- Ancient religions
> 2-Hinduism
> 3- Zorastrian
> 4-Buddhism
> 5-Judahism
> 6- Christianity
> 7-Islam
> 8-Babi
> 9-Baha' i

Of particular sacred significance to Baha' is are calligraphic forms of the word Baba (Arabic for " Glory" ), known as
the Greatest Name, a reference to Baha'u' llab. In this category is the symbol of the nine pointed star with this calligraphy
imprinted on it, which i s engraved on personal rings and on buildings to establish their Baha'i identity.

The number nine is also derived from the name or the word Baba, which according to Persian Adj ail counting adds
up to the number nine. Which also is representative of perfection (as the highest unit) and the numerical equivalent of the
name Baba:

Baba - - - - - - - - B(2 )+A( l )+H(5 ) +A(1 )= 9

Another calligraphic form of the Greatest Name involves an invocation in Arabic Ya Bah' u' I-Abba which says: "O
Glory of the All Glorious." It is displayed in Baha' i homes and places of Baha' i activity.

Also " Nine" registered, declared Baha' is, are required to establish a local spiritual assembly.

Numberl9:

The meaning of the number " nineteen" is vague, even though it occurs frequently in the Baha' i calendar. Not only
is there a nineteen day fast. but a Baha' i month consists of nineteen days. It bas its origin, perhaps, in Persian numero logy.
The significance of the numbers may be ascertained individually; l =unity, and 9=fulfillment, therefor 19 representsa combi-
nation of the two and has a spiritual meaning fo the unity and fulfillment of religions as found in the Baha' i Faith. Also
another explanation for the importance of the number 19 is the "Leners of the Living", which the Bab named after his 18
disciples, including himself as the 19th.

The Baba' i year consists of I 9 months of 19 days each (i.e. 361 days), with the addition ofcertain "lntercalary Days"

between the 18th and 19th months in order to adjust the calendar to the solar year. The Bab named the months after the
attributes of God. The Baha'i New Year, like the ancient Persian New Year, is astronomically fixed. commencing at the March
equinox (March 21 ), which is the first day of Spring.

Saha 'i Persecutions in Iran

The crime was. 10 the eyes of the assassins, thetr religion. or Fa ith in a God. To be Baha' is. In fact t:lus persecution
record dates back to the nud l 800's when the Faith began by the movement of the Bab. Since then Baha' is of Iran have been
persecuted. tens of thousands have been manyrd. 1mpn soned. tortured. or denied of jobs. pe nsions. businesses. and
educational opporrumties. All national Baha"i admimsua11ve strucrures have been banned by the government of Iran. and
ho ly places. shrines, and cemetaries have been confiscated, vandalized or destroyed.

The 350,000 member Baha' i community in Iran. makes up the largest religious minority, and Baha'is have been
oppressed solely because of this religious hatred. Islamic fundamentali sts in Iran and elsewhere, have since the beginning,
viewed the Baha' i Faith as a threat to Islam and have branded the Baba' is as heretics.

The more than 300.000 Baba' is living in Iran are the frequent victims of beatings, imprisonment, property confisca-
tion, persecution and harassment, according to the United Nations and Human Rights watch reports. They are forbidden to
practice their religion and co attend schools and are pressured to become Muslims. More than 200 were executed when the
Ayatollah Khomeini took power in 1979.

lran 's Muslim government has a long history of persecting Baba' is. After the execution of the Bab in front ofa firing
squad. another 20.000 of his followers were executed over the next few years.

Traffic and accessibility to and around the site

Detailed analysis of the r:raffic pattern within the vicinity of the site. both pedestrian and vehicular, based on existing
conditions. The analysis illustrates and suggests possible traffic flow from the streets and avenues to better access the site
both by car and on foot. The most accessible and effective arrival to the site from the south via the ferry drop off is the most
probable and desirable approach and sequence to the Institute. Alterations of the overpass and possible elements to create
safe accessibility to the Institute is also provided.

Topography and subsurface conditions

The land on the site slopes gently east to the East River. The approximate land elevation at First Avenue is 25 feet
above sea level and there is an approximate drop of 45 feet between First Avenue and che water's edge.

A bedrock of hard Manhanan Schist. lies below the surface which forms a solid base for structure. Schist is a
crystalline rock easily split into layers. It falls off toward the river.

The Franklin D. Drive creates a man-made shelf which continues the site out to almost the bulkhead line which was
established by the United States Government. There is a pierhead line which has also been approved by the United States
Government approximately I 00 feet off the land I water edge.

The illustrations provide information of the rock contours of the site. the shoreline of 1820, showing former inden-
tation of Turtle Bay, and tehe present bulkhead line and pierhead line.

The Seven Valleys and it's history

The Seven Valleys of Baha 'u 'I/ah, in fact is a lengthy reply letter to Shaykh Muhid-Din. The reply based on the
ideas and interpretations ofBaha' u' llah on mystic thought and literarure. Baha' u' llahs dominating piece in his letter, is the
metaphor of the Seven Valleys found in Attar's most loved and famous work. The Conference ofthe Birds. In some ways
Baha'u' llah's Seven Valleys can be viewed as a restatement of mystical rruth and the mystical path.

AL the time Baha' u' llah wrote The Seven Valleys. relgious history ws situated between the transition of two
religions with inspiring individuals. The Persian Prophet, the Bab had begun a ministry in 1844 announcing the coming of a
new Messanger. Nine years after his death in 1850, Baha'u' Uah began his mission. At the time. Baha'u' llah wrote this, he had
been in seclusion in search and study of mystical thought. It was after this time that he announced his mission.

However, the text which will strongly influence the design process and structure of the Baha'i Institute, is The Seven
Valleys from Attar's The Conference ofthe Birds. The reason why this text was chosen was because of the structure of the
text and because of it's originality, and precedents in influencing Baha' u' llah. Through analysis of the text, I have found that
the structure of the writings pertains to some Baha'i beleifs and rituals which would strengthen the project. Some of these
events are coincidental. but others, are the basis on the spiritual life of a Baha' i.

Based on research and readings done on the subject, and the writtings of Bah'u'llah and Attar, the specific
recognition and comparison between Baha'u' llah's Seven Valleys, and Attar's Seven Valleys was made. I found this text
extremely important in the founding of the Baha'i Faith and as a great influence on Baha'u'llah. I therefor chose to ultimately
utilize this text, as the generator of the design of the Baha'i Institute. The Seven Valleys is a beautiful mystical essay revealing
the essentials of the seeker's quest to attain access to the lnaccessible-'God' .

The quest ofthe lover for his beloved, ofthe true seeker for the path to enlightenment, this is the
journey through The Seven Valleys of Baha 'u 'llah. Written in the mystical tradition ofthe Sufi poets,

it recounts the odyssey of the human soul as it travels from the plain ofcreation to the sphere ofthe
absolute, its ultimate goal: reunion with God.

> ... this vivid portrayal of the spiritual pilgrimage conveys che timeless verities offaith to guide and
> inspire the soul.

That is the introduction given in the book, which briefly describes the overall theme of the essay. to the followers
of the Baha' i Faith, this text has great importance and meaning, because it was written just prior to His proclamation of the
Faith.

The other text, which in response to Baha 'u 'llah 's Seven Valleys is also of great importance, is The Conference of
the Birds, written by Farid ud-Din Attar, a Persian mystic poet from the 12th century.

ln his text, Attar tells the story of the birds journey and search for divine unity, and their goal of unity with God. In
the journey, Attar uses the metaphoric Seven Valleys, which Baha ' u' llah uses as the structure from his version.

> Baha'u'Uah:                                                          Attar:
> I. Valley of Search                                                  Valley of the Quest
> 2. Valley ofLove                                                     Valley ofLove
> 3. Valley of Knowledge                                               Valley oflnsight and Mystery
> 4. Valley ofUnity                                                    Valley of Detachment

> 6. Valley of Wonderment                                              Valley ofBewilderment
7. Valley of True Poverty & Absolute Nothingness                     Valley of Poverty and Nothingness

The Valley of Seach

a-Patience
such is the patience that our pilgirms need! and many start our quest but few succeed.

{p. 171)
b. The open door
once someone cried to God: 'Lord, let me see/ The door between us opened onto me!"

'when has the door been closed, I'd like to know?" (p. 172)

The basic elements and ideology behind the ValJey of Search , are the important element of patience, and
sacrifice. The tale traces to journey of the soul, symbolised by the 'mystic wayfarer', throughout the worlds of God. In
this instance the journey takes the form of seven valleys, through which the traveller must pass before he can be reunited
with the object of his quest.

The Valley of Love

a. Desire

> loves valley is the next, and here desire I will plunge the pilgrim into seas ofJire.

(p. 172)
b. We seek true love through our linle earthly experiments.

> true lovers tread this path and turn aside I their souls rise up from death and seek above I
> the undiscovered, secret home oflove. (p. 178)

In this valley the traveller becomes unaware of the Self, and desire talces over the soul, and the traveller loses the
ability to make good judgement. Without pain this journey will never end, and everything must be done for the beloved.

> Love setteth a world aflame al every turn. and he wasteth every land where he carrieth his banne1:
> Being hath no existence in his kingdom; the wise wield no command within his realm. The leviathan
of love swalloweth the master ofreason and desrroyeth the lord of knowledge. Baha 'u 'llah

The Valley of Knowledge

a. Each person goes his own way.

> there are so many roads, and each is fit I for that one pilgrim who must follow it.

(p. 179)
b. As many religions as people.

> In this valley, the world is a dark place, and knowledge is a light. A sparkling jewel to lead you through the night.
> step outside the stage we know, the dark of our life below.
> This path brings sorrow and fear.

This kind of knowledge is only possible through the perception of the inner eye, and not through merely
acquired intellectual fact

Baba'u' llah relates the tale of an anguished lover pursued by those seeking to harm him. but who inevitably lead
him co reunion with his beloved. Had the lover been aware of the ouccom before the event, he would have seen his
pursuers as angels, not of darkness, but of light. Knowledge, then, is the perception of the end in the beginning.

The Valley of Detachment

a. Banishment of earthly lust, fears, and desires.

> all claims, all lust for meaning disappear.
> (p. 184)
> act with detachment now in eve1ything I this valley makes creation disappear.

All lust for meaning disappear. It sours the land and lays the valley waste. This valley is more like dust and death
than paradise. It is all about detaching yourself from life, earth and love.

> when one is released from the prison ofSelf, thaJ is indeedfreedom, for Self is the greatest prison
> In the Baha'i Faith history, the proof of this valley is clear. Many who were wealthy on entering the Faith had all
their belongings confiscated. But far from making them give up, it served only to make them less concerned with the
material trappings that created barriers between themselves and God.

The Valley of Unity

a. Unity in diversity?

> the many here are merged in one; one form I involves the multifarious thick swarm
> (p. 191)
b. Unity of soul with God

Representation of oneness and singleness, are the fundamentals of this valley. The many here are merged in one,
one form. This is the oneness of diversity, not oneness lacked in singularity.

This valley marks the transition from the temporal world to the metaphysical. from the plane of limitation to that
of the absolute.

The Valley of Bewilderment

a. Those mad with love for God . {p I 54)

> blinded by grief. you will not recognize I tlze days and nights that pass before you eyes.
> {p. 196)
> Ifsome asks: · what is your present state I is drunkenness or sober sense you fate...

{p. 196)
b. Man who lost his key

> the sufi said: 'And why should you complain? I You know where this door is; ifyou remain I
> outside it - even if it is shut fast I someone no doubt will open it at last, (p. 201)
b. What is the meaning of the key?

The wayfarer now discovers the immensity of creation, he is strukck dumb in wonder.

The Valley of Nothingness and Poverty

a. Nothingness is totally losing yourself in God

> whoever sinks within this sea is blest I and in selflost obtains eternal rest I the heart
> that would be lost in this wide sea I Dispersesin profound tranquility. (p. 204-5)
> I live with evei/ while my Self is here I with God both Selfand evil disappear I when
> I escape the SelfI will arise I And be as God; the yearning pilgrim flies I From this
> dark province of monality I to Nothingness and Eternity.

If any trace of the Self is left, all is finally burned away in this valley.

The Seven Valleys and the Program

The Seven Valleys srrucrure greatly influences the size and requremenrs for the program. The initial discription of
the Valleys as described in the book is used structurally and mathematically to determine the square footage of the
program. The number of sentences and their structure in each intro to the ValJeys determine a specific percentage of the
overall whole.

The dimensions of the site were determined by the text. organization and structure of the last Valley, The Valley
of Nothingness and Poverty. The intro and description of this Valley as written by Attar consists of 41 pairs of sentences
or sonnets which become the organizational elemenr of the site. These sonnets are broken up into 4 sections, the first
being J 6 pairs, the second 5 pairs, the third is 13 pairs and the final section consists of 7 pairs. Using the periods and
rituals in the Baha' i Faith, and multiplying 19 by the number of sentence pairs, we arrive at a number. This number
represents the length in feet of each section. Therefor, these sentences are seperated by 19 feet, in between each section,
there is a 90 feet span whcib acts as the break between the sonnets.

90 feet                     90 feet                     90 feet

> 16 x 19'                     5 x 19'                   13 x 19'                    7 x 19'

1049 feet

> The sum of these numbers comes to I 049 feet as the length of the site.

The width is derived from the actual length of the sentences and their structure. Each letter is represented by 9

fee~ and the syllables, which create 9 seperations in the sentence also are 9 feet apart. The average width of the site,
therefor is about 325 fe.et. extending into the water. The square footage of the site therefor, comes to approximately 340,000
square feet. From this number, 19% is dedicated to the program footprint. This number is approximately 64500 square feet
and from this a percentage relating to the text is subtracted for each VaJJey.

There are 140 pairs of sentences which make up the intro and description of all of the Seven Valleys.

From the metaphoric analysis of the text, specific programmatic elements were chosen which would best fit each
Valley.

Sequentially, the lobby, and the temporary and permanent exhibits where placed and were compared to the Valley
of Search. This marks the beginning of the journey through the Institute. In this Valley, art work, historical doctrines,
artifacts, photographs, and writings which are derivatives of the religion and the country of Iran will be on display. It will
become a space wher the general public can be taught of the history of th Faith, and to expose the works of Persian and or
Baha' i artists.

Ln the Valley of Love. the imponant garden elements of the Saha' i Faith will create a world of desire. Love and
beauty. This space therefor will consist of exterior terraces and docks and platforms which compositionally create
horizontal transitional elements between the land and the water.

ln the Valley of Knowledge, the guiding light of the Fear of God. and knowledge will create the learning and
research center. Based on fundamental guidelines of the religion. one of the most imponant issues for the Faith, is the
introduction of cumpulsory education. and the independent search after truth, which because of it's imponance, becomes
the principal element in the program and function of the building. The library, archive rooms. research halls and class-
rooms. create the Valley or annosphere of knowledge and learning of the Baha'i Faith and it's history. It becomes an
isolated clement, "a sparkling jewel to lead you through the night" which acts as the object between the traveller and the
Valley of Unity.

Here in the Valley of Unity, the members of the Baha' i faith and other organizations come together and discuss
world affairs in a 500 person auditorium. Besides this function, conferences, banquets, seminars, lectures and perfor-
mances will take place, in the singular Valley of Unity.

Another exterior and sometimes covered element which marks the transition between the temporal and meta-
physical worlds, is the VaJley of Detachment. It becomes a threshold. a plane of peace, and tranquility for contemplation
where people can pray in designated secluded areas. A space where the focus is out towards the nature and becomes
woven into the 41 walls of the Valley of Nothingness and Poverty. From here an image gallery displaying photos of
Baha' is and landmarks of the Faith, lead the traveller to the Tower of Nothingness.

Throughout the past century. the Baha'is of Iran have been persecuted. Nearly 20,000 of the Baha'is since the
dawn of the Faith, have been executed. thousands more have been imprisoned. and tens of thousands have been
deprived of jobs, pensions, businesses, and educational opponunities. All national Baba' i administrative structures have
been banned by the government of Iran, and holy places, shrines and cemeteries have been confiscated, vandalised, or
destroyed.

A second, but equally imponant clement which also represents the building and it's function and importance in
remembrance of the Baha' is is a memorial. This component which could possibly be the mediator between the city and the
water. is representative of the oppression and victimization of the Baha' i prophet, Baha' u' llah, and his family, who were
imprisoned for 40 years, but it also is a symbol for the thousands who have been tortured, imprisoned, and murdered by
the Iranian Islamic Government because of their beliefs.

The value of this last Valley and its metaphoric meaning relates to the last stage of life in the world. Dying. This
is the moment where one loses him I herself in God.

> Whoever sinks within this sea is blest I and in selflost obtains eternal rest I the heart
> that would be lost in this wide sea I Disperses in profound tranquility. (p. 204-5)
> when I escape the Self I will rise I And be as God:    From this dark province of
> mortality I to Notingness and Eternity.

If any trace of the Self is left, all is finally burned away in this Valley.
