> **Abstract:** This thesis examines the use of landscape motifs by two contemporary Canadian artists to express their spiritual aspirations. Both Robert Houle and Otto Rogers, inspired by the Canadian prairie landscape, employ its abstracted form to convey their respective spiritual ideas. The attitude of the Saulteaux (Plains Ojibway) toward the land is explored, as well as other significant aspects of their spiritual life to gain a better understanding of the spiritual iconography in Houle's art. Similarly the Bahá'í Faith's point of view toward the land is discussed together with some of its teachings that find expression in Rogers' work. There is also a discussion of their choice of abstraction as the formal conveyor of a spiritual message. A thorough analysis of several of their works is been provided to establish how both artists employ the landscape and its features to convey a sense of spirituality.

This thesis examines the use of landscape motifs by two contemporary Canadian
artists to express their spiritual aspirations. Both Robert Houle and Otto Rogers, inspired
by the Canadian prairie landscape, employ its abstracted form to convey their respective
spiritual ideas. The attitude of the Saulteaux (Plains Ojibway) toward the land is
explored, as weIl as other significant aspects of their spiritual life to gain a better
understanding of the spiritual iconography 5n Houle's art. Similarly the Baha'i Faith's
point of view toward the land is discussed tcogether with some of its teachings that find
expression in Rogers's work. There is also a discussion of their choice of abstraction as
the forrnal conveyor of a spiritual message. A thorough analysis of several of their works
is been provided to establish how both artists employ the landscape and its features to
convey a sense of spiritudity.

INTRODUCTION

Within the discipline of Canadian art history, the spiritual significance of the
Iandscape in the art of the first part of the twentieth-century, as well as the rdationship
between certain spintual ideoiogies and abstraction have been examined extensively in
the work of several artists.' However this investigation has only been extended to the
study of contemporary Canadian art to a limited degree. As these reiationships are still
relevant today, it is tirnely to apply this line of inquiry to the work of contemporary
Canadian artists. This thesis will address that void by investigating the spiritual meaning
in the landscape works of two artists: Robert Houle @. 1947) and Otto Rogers (b- 1935).
Houle and Rogers have repeatediy demonstrated in their work that they have spiritual
aspirations which they wish to convey to their respective audiences. In fact, it is no
longer adequate to discuss their works fiom a purely forma1 point of view; instead, a
thorough understanding of their work necessitates an exploration of the topic of
spirituality.

Robert Houle was born in St- Boniface, Manitoba, into a Sadteaux (or Plains
Ojibway) family. Most of his childhood was spent in a Catholic residentid school at the
Sandy Bay Indian Reservation. Rogers was born and raised on a f m near Kerrobert,
Saskatchewan, by a family that was Protestant Chnstiau but not affiliated with a specific

' Such as Lawren S. Harris, Ernily Carr, Berîrarn Brwker and Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald-

denomination. Since 1960 Rogers has been a member of the BaWi Faith. Despite their
obvious differences-in        terms of cuiturai background ana spiritual ideology-these               two
artists have much in common. Perhaps the most obvious experience they share is that
both were born and raised in the flat landscape of the Canadian prairies. But there are
other important points of convergence. First, an interest in spintuality as inflected by
their respective cultural and religious beIiefs is a common trait. Secondly, they both
understand the land to be of spiritual significance, either in reflecting another reality or in
its interconnectedness with spiritual health. Hence it is not surprising that the landscape
motif, most often recdled simply through the use of a horizon line in an otherwise
abstracted composition, features so prominently in both of their works. Landscape
features are employed by both artists to convey some of the spirituai concepts they see as
important. Finally, they also share a cornmitment to abstracted representation as central
to their formal vocabulary.

Whenever Iandscape works of a spirituai nature have been discussed, throughout
the history of art both in Canada and htemationally, the treatment has been aimost
exclusively confined to artists fkom the Judeo-Christian tradition or those artists who
where interested in the anti-materiaiisf movements that became popular towards the end
* According to Maurice Tuchman, "visual              from the generatïon born in the 1860s to contemporary
tirnes, have tumed to a variety of antimaterialist philosophies-..-"Al1 of these philosophies share "concepts
of mysticism or occultism." He M e r States that for art3ts and art historians "mysticism refers to the
search for the state of oneness with ultirnate reality. Occultism depends upon secret, concealed phenornena
that are accessible only to those who have been appropriately initiated-" Among these ami-materialist
philosophies are Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Rosicrucianism and Transcendentalism, "Hidden Meanings
in Abstract Arî," Tuchman et-al., The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting 1890-1985,(New York:
Abbeville Press, 1986), 19.

of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, such as Theosophy
and Transcendentalism. Similarly, the documentation in the literature of art history with
regards to spirituality in the works of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Symbolist
and abstract artists is almost exclusively concerned with the infiuence of Theosophy,
Rosicnicianisrn and Anthroposophy. A study of the philosophical stances of Houle and
Rogers will expand the scholarship to be more reflective of the divers* of the Canadian
population and some of the other spiritual beliefs that influence its artists today. In
particular it wiU allow for a discussion of some of the oldest spiritual teachings and a
look at one of the newest religious movements shaping the spiritual life and the artistic
output of some of Canada's artists-

A review of the existing Iiterature will show that scholarly studies have repeatedly
sought to prove the intrinsic link between landscape and spirituality, as well as that
arnong spirituality, Iandscape and abstraction in the work of Canadian artists of the fnst
part of the twentieth century. The first cornprehensive study linking the mystical
concems of a Canadian artist with landscape was Jeremy Adamson's 1978 study Lawren
S. Harris: Urbun Scenes and WiZdemess Lundscapes 1906-1930. Adamson traces
Harris's spiritual search, starting in his student years in Germany witb his introduction to

anti-materialist philosophies such as Transcendentalism and Theosophy. He discusses
how the artist turned to landscape to express inner perceptions of a mystical reality?

Whereas Adarnson looks at the first p& of Ham*s7sartistic career, in a 1985 study
Dennis Reid examines his Iater work. Ahrta Buddhi Manas: The Later Work of Lawren S.
Harris is particularly concerned with the artist's stmggle between his love for the land
and its representationai depiction on one hand and, on the other, the use of abstracted
forrns as suggested in Theosophical writhgs. Reid demonstrates that Theosophy was the
most important influence in Harris's work and recounts how the artkt eventualIy moved
toward abstraction to express the interconnectedness of ail things.J

In 1992 A n . Davis extended the study of Canadian mystical painting to include
four other artists besides Harris: Emily Carr, Fred Varley, Bertram Brooker, and Jock
Macdonald. In her Logic ofEcstasy: Canadian Mysticd Painting 1920-1940 Davis
States that an understanding of the mystical experiences and ideas of these artists is
necessary to appreciate their different artistic approaches. She establishes a clear Iink
between their interest in spirihial philosophies and their love for the Canadian landscape.
Davis identifies several different strands of mysticism which af5ected the art and Iife of

these five painters. It was the influence of these mystical theones that led the four artists
she examines to depict the landscape repeatedly.5

In 1984 Roaid Nasgaard in his exhibition catalogue The Mystic North: S ' b o l i s t
Lundscape Painting in N o r t h Europe ond North America 1890-1940,discusses how
Symbolist artists moved toward the depiction of a figure-fiee landscape îhat would give
expression to their rnystical interests. Nasgaard establishes the existence of a common
interest between the Northern European and North American artists in irnplying the
existence of unseen meanings in their landscape images. Through his study a continuous
chah of influence is forged fiom the artists of the Northem Romantic movement to the
members of Canada's Group of Seven-al1            shared an interest in spirihiality and used the
landscape as a metaphor to express it.6

Other studies have carried this line of inquiry into the second half of the twentieth
century. Though it does not address Canadian artists, Robea Rosenbium's influentid
study, Modern Painting and the Northem Romantic Tradition: Friedrich to Rothko
(1975), provides a usefbl Iink between the Northem Romantic figurative strain
represented by Caspar David Friedrich and other painters of his generation to the
Abstract Expressionists. Rosenblum discusses the importance of landscape in the

expression of spuituai ideas in the works of many artists starting with Friedrich and
extending to the anti-realist and anti-materidist interpretations of Bamett Newman, Mark
Rothko and other Abstract Expressionists, al1 of whose work is rooted in Symbolism.
They al1 were interested in e x p l o ~ spirihial

g         themes in their works but without making
use of the usuai iconography associated with religious subject matter. What
distinguished this second generation of Amencan abstract artists was their engagement
with such diverse non-Christiansources as Native art, Zen, and the Jewish Kabbalah.'

There are a few, yet significant studies that have considered spirituality in the
works of contemporary Canadian artists. The National Gallery of Canada made an
important contribution to this field of inquiry in 1992 when it organized its first major
international exhibition of contemporary art produced by Native North Amencan artists.

followers of those anti-matenalist philosophies that became popular around the tum of
the nineteenth century.

Another example in recent Canadian scholarship is Maureen Korp's 1991 Ph-D.

dissertation entitled "Earthworks: Shamanism in the religious experiences of
contemporary artists in North Arnerica." Korp investigates whether contemporary
earthworks are a religious statement by the artïsts who make thern, just as earlier, archaic
earthworks are agreed to have had a spirihial fhcti0n.P Her study is significant as it
looks at the work of contemporary North American artists, their attitudes toward the land
and their spiritual/religious experiences.

In the past thirty years, there has been a growing literature dealing with abstraction
as a means to express metaphysical ideas. A 1985 exhibition at the Los Angeles County
Museum o f Art, B e Spiritual in Art: Absiract Painting 1890-1985, was devoted
exclusively to this subject. The accompmying exhibition catalogue discusses at great
length many themes related to this topic, including the iduence of Symbolist art as well
as Theosophy, Anthroposophy,and Rosicrucianism, the Jewish Kabbalah, and North
West-Coast Aboriginal art on the works of many of the leading abstractionists in Europe,
the United States and Canada.. Maurice Tuchman, the curator and editor of the exhibition
catalogue, firmly believes that the development of abstract art was tied to spiritual ideas

Americg" (PhD. diss., Ottawa University, 199 l), Vol. 1.

as artists yearned to express deeper ideas with a new languagmoe that wodd no longer
rely on traditional pictorial terms."

Important earlier studies that established a solid relationship between mysticai
teachings and abstraction include Sixten Ringbom's article ''Art in 'the Epoch of the
Great Spiritual': Occult Elements in the Early Theory of Abstract Art," (1966). Here the
author establishes the influence of Anthroposophy and Theosophy on artists such as
Kandinsky, Franz Marc, Paul Klee and Piet Monclrian. He explains that the age-old
pictorial terrns were no longer sufficient for what these artists hoped to convey.
Comrnunicating otherworldly realities with depictions of the matenal world in figura1
terms was not a satisfactory solution and hence they moved toward non-objective art."

As demonstrated above, there is a body of literature that has established
connections between spirituality and landscape as well as among spirituality, landscape
and abstraction. Likewise, litemture specifically on Houle and Rogers, as well as the
artkts' own writings and statements, make mention of their interest in spïrihiality and the
evocation of the landscape in thek art. Houle is convinced that spirituality is necessary
for the survivai of his culture. His Native culture inextricably binds spirihiality and the
land toge*.      In his essay for the Land. Spirt, Power: First Niztions at the National

G d e y of Canada exhibition catalogue he makes the reader aware that many Western
societies have lost a sense of the sacredness of nature.'' With his art, Houle hopes to
rekindle this sense of sacredness toward the land. For an earlier project, Houle
interviewed several First Nations artists in the United States and Canada and found that,
despite their differences, the sacred relationship to the land was a common bond."

For Houle, the land-due to its spiritual significance and because of its importance
to survival-takes     on a political dimension, and this is an aspect of his art that has been
discussed fiequentiy and at length. However, his continual use of references to both
Christian theology and Sun Dance traditions in his art proves that the artist is very much
influenced by and interested in expressing spirihial ideas. In her essay for the exhibition
catalogue Robert Houle: Indiansfiorn A to Z (1990), Clara Hargittay states that Houle's
1983 work PmJlechesfor the Last Supper, for example, successfülly combines the artist7s
two-at times opposing-spirituaï          traditions. With regards to his continued interest in
the land she writes, "he is profoundly aware of the interconnectedness of man and nature,
and he is not &aid to find spllituality in the land."14 In the same catalogue, curator
Shirley Madill states that there are new perceptions of spirit in twentieth-century culture
and that these have had an impact on contemporary art, including the work of Robert

Similarly, Rogers's works have been termed cclandscapesof the soul" by art critic
Robert Enright." Curator Terrence Heath in tum referred to them as "cosmic
lands~apes."'~Although the artist does not see himself as a landscape or prairie painter,
the landscape or some of its essential features are his most important means of expressing
metaphysical subject matter- Rogers himself has reiterated the importance of the
landscape as a perfect metaphor for the spiritual. In his own writings, as well as in
numerous interviews, Rogers has expressed the importance of his religious beliefs to his
art. The artist believes that contemplation of many of the teachings and principles of the
Baha'i Faith, especially the concept of C'unity,"has directed him in his art, In addition, he
is convinced of the general importance of the arts for uplifting souls.

In an exhibition catalogue of 1982, Otto Rogers: A Suntey 1973-1982, Norman
Zepp states that any discussion of Rogers's work has to consider three elernents:
formalism, landscape and religion. He believes that an analysis that ignores any of these
elernents would be incornpiete. He sets out to understand whether Rogers is primarily a
fonnalist, a landscape artist, or a religious painter? Although Zepp touches on al1 of
these areas, a deeper exploration, especially regarding the influence of Rogers's religious
beliefs and repeated use of the landscape motif, is necessary.

This thesis will argue that a more precise and detaiIed analysis of the nature of the
spintual beliefs of both Houle and Rogers is necessary for a proper understanding of their
achievements. In addition, a discussion of their view of the land will help determine why
the landscape acts as a powerful metaphor for spirituality in their works. Moreover, the
thesis d l show that their work cannot be understood in isolation, but should be placed in
relation to the tradition of mystical abstract painting both in Canada and intemationally.

This thesis relies upon texts and scholarship of spiritual and religious traditions as
well as strictly art-historical literature. A link will be made between these philosophical
studks and purely art historical texts, such as those mentioned above, on landscape,
spirihiality and abstraction. The spiritual traditions of the Western Ojibway people wiil

be examined, particularly to understand their attitude toward the land. It will become
apparent that through colonization, the influence of Christianity and the passage of t h e ,
these traditions have evolved. The thesis will show to what extent Native spiritual
traditions and Christianity have together intluenced Robert Houle's thinking and artistic
output. It will also allow for a clear understanding of the importance of the land in
Native spiritual traditions and as a result in his work. In tum, a study of the B a h U
teachings will be undertaken, with emphasis on those that seem that have had the greatest
impact on Otto Rogers's artistic output. A look at the artist's childhood will reveal that
his association with nature led him to become an active seeker of spirituality. Therefore,
a brief discussion on the Baha'i attitude toward the physical world is also included. The
bulk of the discussion, however, concentrates on an analysis of the works of the two
artists and their use of spiritual symbolisrn in their art. This interdisciplinary study is of
an analytical nature, synthesizing formal, spintual and philosophical ideas. Conclusions
will be based on a review of the existing literature, interviews with the artists, and, most
importantly, a detailed visual analysis of some of their key works. Additional data and
information gathered at several art institutions and gaileries make up a good portion of
the primary and secondary data.

The fkst chapter will examine the influence of anti-matexialist philosophies on
Canadian artists in the earlier twentieth cenhiry, and the roots of their landscape painting
in the Northern Romantic tradition, in mder to show both continuities and divergence in

the later work of Houle and Rogers- It wili also look at how an interest in anti-materialkt
philosophies Ied artists at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
centuries toward non-figurative art, art that was devoid of any reference to the material
world. This spintual reading of abstraction, which until recently was eclipsed by
formdist interpretations, will be shown to have direct relevance to Houle's and Rogers's
own understanding of their intentions.

In the second and third chapters respectively, a theoretical basis fkom which to
discuss the works of Houle and Rogers will be established- It will discuss the
philosophical stances of the artists. Their definition of spintuality is examhed through
the artists' works and voices-Houle's     in light of the syncretic nature of Ojibway
traditions due to the Catholic influence and Rogers's in relation to his belief in the Baha'i
teachings. However, a comprehensive study of Ojibway and Baha'i spiritual beIiefs is
beyond the scope of this thesis. Both artists' attitudes toward the land are explored,
taking into account their upbringing in the prairie landscape and the spiritual ideologies
that shape their lives. Several of their works that illuminate the spirïtuality-landscape
fiamework will be discussed at length, synthesizing their formal, spiritual and
philosophical aspects.

The conclusion of the thesis will focus on how the work of Houle and Rogers can
be situated within the art-historical tradition of the twentieth century. It wiIl aiso

conclude that spirïtuality and the landscape motif, albeit in an abstracîed forrn, have been
and are continuing to be closely meshed together in the work of contemporary Canadian
artists. It wiLl make the reader aware that the subject of spirituaiity is of ongoing vitality
in the art world both in Canada and in an international context-

Close your b o d y eye, su thar you may see yourpicîurefiirsl wilh the spiritual eye.'

Robert Houle and Otto Rogers are two contemporary Canadian artists who have
repeatedly demonstrated an interest in conveying their spiritual aspirations in their art.
The chief vehicle for the expression of these concepts for both artists is landscape,
usually in an abstracted form. This chapter will argue that theü choice of the landscape
to convey their respective approaches to spirituality is not an isolated one. The modem
history of art in Canada, Europe and the United States has a long tradition of artists using
the landscape to express spiritual*.          Similarly, the more recent history of abstraction in
visual art is linked to the rise of interest in anti-materialist philosophies. Ultimately it
wiIl become evident that the spintual aspirations and interests of some artists are crucial
to the understanding of their works of art.

In Canada before World War II there were several well-known Canadian artists
who expressed a sense of spirituality through the depiction of the landscape. Among
these are Lawren S. Harris, Emily C m , Fred Vartey, Bertra.cnBrooker, and Jock
Macdonald. The landscape was a point of deparhile for d l of them and was an integral

part of their search for a new mystical visual Ianguage. Each of them was involved to a
> certain degree with one or more of the various Christian churches, Transcendentalism,
> Theosophy, or Anthroposophy. Some of their most celebrated works are those which
they approached with spiritual aspirations and these have been described by art histonan
AM Davis as "launching pad[s] for the spirit-"2

Transcendentalism had a profound effect not only on these artists, but on al1 of
North America as well. According to Davis, that form of Transcendentalism propounded
by Walt Whitman was of particular interest to Canadian artists such as Carr, Harris,
Macdonald and Brooker.' One dominant aspect of his ideas that appealed to these artists
is his assertion that doseness to nature is necessary to bring the best out in individuals-
Whitman promoted the idea that nature is formed and informed by the spirit, meaning
that every tree, mountain or lake is a symbol of a greater spiritual reality, and that God
not only created nature but also is immanent in nature. Therefore for Transcendentalists
the physical world acted both as "fact and ~ymbol-"~

Whitman was also convinced that a
divine Unxty pervaded al1 art and al1 life and that great art reflects reality.' Such ideas
provided a clear cal1 for these artists to engage fully with the Canadian landscape. For
example, we are reminded of the nurnerous northern sketching trips Harris, MacDonald

and the other members of the Group of Seven undertook, starting in 1914 with a trip to
Algonquin Park, resulting in some of the best-known landscape paintings in Canadian art.

To look for tangible effects of transcendentaI theories in the art of these Canadian
artists is difncult. Their influence according to Davis, unIike that of Theosophy, was of a
purely philosophic nature and hence one c a ~ ofind

t any specific transcendental
iconography in their art. Its impact is mostiy discemible in the writings and attitudes of
the artists. For example, reading Transcendentalist writings reinforced Harris's fondness
for the Canadian landscape. On numerous occasions he wrote about the invigorating and
healing powers of the land and especially those of the North. Harris, reflecting ideas
found in Transcendentalism, believed that ''visible nature is but a distorted reflection of a
more perfect world..        ."6   His painting From the North Shore, Lake Strperior (1923) Fig.
11 is an attempt to show the viewer more of that perfect world by combining "fact and
symbol." Harris's approach to landscape draws on empincal evidence; as the title
suggests, he refers to a specific, "fa~tual'~

site. Yet it is also symbolic, because the artist
has deviated significantly fiom the actual scene, colour and mood to create an
otherworldly feeling, especiaily through the use of ''unnatural clouds and unexpected
light.'y7

Another Canadian artist who was a great admirer of Whitman was Emily Cam.

Besides the exanipIe of the Native people of the West Coast, whom C m believed to have
an inherent understanding of nature due to their close association with it, her search for
the spirit of nature was helped dong by Whitman's writings as Davis hâs demonstrated.
They taught her, in particular, to seek the "flowing urge of life"' fiom nature, which she
repeatedly tried to translate into visuai form. Her 1933 painting The Mountain [Fig. 21
for exampte, captures this urge of life, created through a sense of movement and g r o ~ t h . ~

The desire of these Canadian artists to express their spiritual aspirations through the
depiction of their landscape was shared with their spintual predecessors in Europe-the
artists of the Northem Romantic movement, These artists were in search of a new
language to express religious devotion. They decided that the landscape was a well-
suited syrnbol for evoking spiritual or mystical responses. As early as the 1760s and
1770s, northern European artists turned to natural sites that would elicit awe and wonder
to prove the mightiness of God to their audiences- One can see in their paintings a move
away fiom anthropocentric depictions, towards the portraya1 of a sublime landscape that
would dwarfthe human or animal staffage depicted.

Ecstasy, 53.

The Geman Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich (1 774-1840) was one of the
artists who, in the increasingly secdar world of the 1800s, tried to revive spintuality
through the use of new irnzges. Traditional themes such as the Adoration and the
Crucifixion needed, in his view and in that of his contemporaries such as Philip Otto
Runge (1 777- 1810) and William Blake (1757-1 827), to be exchanged for new images
that would convey spiritual experience in the Age of Enlightenrnent. Leaving traditional
Christian iconography behind, these artkts instead used landscape or everyday situations
and converted them into scenes addressing time-honoured Christian s~bjects.'~

For
example, in 1808 Friedrich painted the altarpiece The Cross in the Mountains Fig. 31
depicting a sculpture of the crucified Chnst in a rugged Nordic landscape. Simon
Scharna explains that German critics attacked Friedrich's work, complaining that it
obliterated the difference between sacred art and landscape painting. Friedrich supplied
his critics with the explicit meanings of his symbols, where, for example, the £3trees
stand for the etemal Iife that is granted by the Resurrection." Such explicit use of
landscape features to supplant Christian iconography was augmented by the employment
of more general spiritual themes. Friedrich's image Monk by the Sea (1 809) Fig. 41 is
one such example- It features a miniscule figure in a vast, almost featureless landscape.
Here the artist was sûiving to represent nature in such a way as to evoke the grandeur and
power of God.12

Like Northem Romanticism, the Syrnbolist movement at the end of the nineteenth
> century also used Iandscape as a vehicle to convey spiritual ideas. Nthough onginally a
> literary movement, Symbolism took hold in the visual arts. It arose in reaction to the
positivist and scientific ideologies that pervaded the nineteenth century and were
particularly evident in Naturalist art and literature. This prompted some artists to explore
more mystical subjects such as inner States of being and to develop a reduced formal
vocabulary. Symbolist artists were now primarily concemed with "objecti@[ing] the
subjective (the exteriorization of the idea)"" and were no longer interested in copying
nature mirneticdly, Landscape painting was considered a minor genre in Symbolism.
However, for Symbolist-influenced Post-Impressionists such as Seurat, van Gogh,
Gauguin and the Nabis in France, as well as Symbolists outside of France, especially in
northern Europe, such as Edvard Munch and Ferdinand Hodler, the landscape continued
to be the primary subject matter. According to art historian Roald Nasgaard, %e mie
Symbolists do not so much search out new themes and subjects as invest the given ones
with subjective and traascendental meaning."'4 Hence instead of investing figurative
subjects with a mystical mood, they employed the landscape to that end. The wilderness
landscape in particular appeaied to them, as they regarded it a place for spiritual
revelation.

\[14\] Nasgaard, m i e North, 5-

This sentiment could also be found among Canadian artists. Scholarship shows
that there is a defnite link between Scandinavian and Canadian Symbolist painting.
Symbolist landscape painting came to the fore in about 1890 in Scandinavia and after

1913 in Canada when, accordhg to Nasgaard, it became 'the pre-eminent national style."

The Scandinavian Symbolists chose the "brave barren prornontories, impenetrable
forests, and high mountain peaks in order to produce new work that depended on the
cleansing effect of unspoiled wildemess." Their choice of composition, subject matter
and ideology reflected those of the earlier Northem Romantic artists such as Friedrich,
creating a historical continuum over two ~enhines.'~

In Canada, artists such as Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven could readiIy
identie not only with the use of wildemess landscape but also with the general interest in
transcendeutal ideas as expressed in Scandinavian Symbolist art. Another idea that
bound these groups together was the belief that the North was the source of both spiritual
and cultural revival; this belief was supported by Theosophical thought which interested
Lawren Hams. Crucial to the transfer of ideas fiom northern Europe to Canada was the
1913 Armory Show in Buffalo, New York visited by Harris and J.E.H. MacDonald.
There they saw in the landscape art of the Scandinavians a mode1 that fûlfilled both their
nationalistic and their spiritual aspirations. In what Nasgaard terms the second phase of
the northem Symbolist landscape tradition, which he considers continued in Canada and

the United States fiom about 1919 to 1940, the artists had the same intention as their
predecessors: to use the depiction of the landscape as a metaphor for the supernahual.

m portrayals of the landscape is that it ccpossessesan inner

coherence based on striving for the expression of affective or transcendental content
through close communion with an intimately experienced land~cape."'~

Symbolism was one of the crucial movements in the development of modem art, as
it provided an important stepping Stone toward non-representational art. Symbolist works
set the stage for artists such as Wassily Kandinsky (1 866-1944). Symbolist artists were
interested in representing subjects other than those found in the tangible world. They
moved away from traditional iconography hoping to go beyond an object's literal
meaning. Their aim was to delve into an ideal world and render the invisible in a way
that would make it visible. The newly employed forms and symbols were meant to
convey new and often transcendental meanings to their viewers." One natural outcome
was the use of reduced forms and pure colours, leading to abstraction. Hence the
inchoate abstraction of the Syrnbolists was-next             to an interest in spirituality-one of the
decisive influences that led subsequent generations of artists to pure abstraction.''

\[18\] An exarnple of a work by a Symbolist artist can been seen in the painting of the Dutch artist Johan Thom
Prikker (1 868-1 932) The Bride of Christ ( 1 892-93). AIthough the bride is depicted in an abstracted forrn,
yet the painting dso contains more readily recognizable references to the naturai world such as leaves.

Besides the Iuik that has been established between spirituaiity and landscape, recent
art histoncal scholarship has also provided ample proof that antï-materiadkt philosophies
propelied artists to make a decisive move toward non-representational art. One of the
earliest studies that estabiished an undeniable link between abstract art aind occult
teachings was that undertaken by Sixten Ringbom in 1966. Ringbom lirirks Kandinsky,
Franz Marc, Paul Klee and Mondnan in parricdar to the occtdt, to Theosophy and to
Anthropo~ophy.'~More recent studies include the numerous essays incluided in the
exhibition catalogue accompanying the exhibition organized by Maurice Tuchman
entitled The Spiritual in Art.- Abstruct Painting 1890498.5.

In Canada, Lawren Harris was the artist of the twentieth century most openiy
cornmitteci to Theosophy; as a result his work grew increasingly more abstract over his
career. Harns wrote and lectured extensively on art and Theosophy and t n e d to reflect its
teachings in his art until the end of his life. The International Theosophical Society was
founded in New York in 1875; its most influentid founding member was Mme- Helena
Petrovna Blavatsky (1 83 1-1891). Theosophy is a blend of Eastern and Western thought.
Perhaps its strongest influence on artists can be found in the doctrine of colour, which

triangles, crosses, circles and squares? These charts and writings gave artists who were
interested in Theosophy tangible examples of how to construct non-objective paintings
that would make no reference to the material world, yet intirnate the spiritual one.

Harris used the colour theory suggested by Theosophical writings as well as
geometric forms such as circles and triangles in his paintings. They c m be found
regularly in his abstractions but also, perhaps in a more concealed way, in his later
landscape works. Not only did Theosophy help Harris to move toward abstraction by
using the suggested thought forms and colour symbolism, but its underlying
philosophy-the     emphasis on the spiritual rather than the material, the universal rather
than the particular-had    helped Harris detach himself fiom the landscape and embrace
abstraction, resulting in such works as Composition No. I pig. 51 of 1941- However, his
interest in abstraction does not diminish the importance of landscape to his work. In fact,

Brooker was also influenced by Theosophy and was particularly interested in the
concept of synaesthesia, which suggests the confluence of the senses. He, for example,
experimented with music as a source for initiating abstract art in such works as

In Europe, Kandinslq was another artist who made use of the concept of
synaesthesia and was interested in how one art fonn codd evoke another. Synaesthesia
appealed to Kandinsky, because he himself had expenenced the evocation of colours
while listening to Richard Wagner's Lohengrin.24His spiritual and artistic legacy is
summarized in his book Concerning the Spiritual in Art (1912) which had a profound
eEect on generations cf artists. Among the ideas that Kandinsky expresses in his book is
the belief that the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century mark
the beginning of one of the greatest spiritual epochs in the iïfe of humanity and hence he
t e m s it the "Epoch of the Great Spiritual." For him, the role of the arts and the artist are

fbndamentally spiritual in nature. He suggests that "art is a matter of the spirit.'N
Kandinsky believes that the world is in need of a spiritual movement that wil1 negate the
rise of materialism. For him, the solution is found to a great extent in the teachings of
Theosophy. He believes that the "Epoch of the Great Spirihial" demands a new f o m of
artistic expression,

The problem that faced Kandinslq was how to express the spintual in a matenal
f o m and to find the answer, he consciously moved toward non-representational art, It is
not surprising that during the tirne period when Kandinslq was most preoccupied with
spirihial ideas, fiom 1908 to 1912, there is a gradua1 shift in his art away fiom objective
art toward depicting abstract forms that represented his "imer aspiration^."^^ He was
interested in emancipating colours and forms fiom the objects with which they were
associated. His first wholly abstract watercolour work was executed in 1910.

More recent abstraction has been inf'iuenced by a varïety of anti-materialist
philosophies. In New York Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, Adolph Goalieb and
Mark Rothko formed, according to Maurice Tuchman, "a second wave of abstract
pioneers, searching for expressive means appropriate to their generation and asserting the
need for universal tnith~."~'

were their sources of inspiration. They did not align themselves with, for example,

character.

Another notable artist who showed interest in conveying spiritual themes in his
work at this time codd be found on the West Coast Mark Tobey (1 890-1976) was
greatiy influenced by religion, according to former curator at the Museum of Modem Art
in New York, William C . Seitz.2' Tobey joined the Bahii'i Faith in 1918, and in 1934 he
studied Zen Buddhism in conjunction with Japanese calligraphy, which augmented his
knowledge of Chinese brush painting and his interest in Persian and Arabic calligraphie
styles. Al1 these influences and interests led him in 1935 to ''white writing," the non-
figurative style he is perhaps best known for- Like Rogers, Tobey was very much
interested in the principle of ' ~ t y Y

as7proposed in the writings of the Baha'i Faith. His
'%hite writing" *le     demonstrated this spiritual aspiration by reconciling Eastern and
Western artistic styles in a single work of art.

Another artist who looked at non-Christian sources was Abstract Expressionist
Bamett Newman. Thomas Hess discussed the Kabbalah as the source of many of the
artist's concepts in 1971. This was the first tirne that his work was analyzed in light of
the Jewish mystical t e a ~ h i n g s .Newman

~      b s e l f n e v e r çpoke about the Kabbalah as a
basis for his art and this might be part of its very secretive nature. However, Hess's
analysis makes it clear that an interpretation of Newman's work cannot just focus on the
forma1 elements of his work while ignoring its mysticd content- The artist's writuigs
seem to support this line of arguing. As he stated in 1971:

> The present painter is concerned not with his own feelings or with the mystery of his own
> personality but with the penetration into the world mystery. His imagination is therefore
> attempting to dig into metaphysical secrets. To that extent his art is concemed with the sublime.

It is a religious art which through symbols will catch the basic tmth of lifePO

Newman's The Stations of the Cross (1958-1966) (Fig. 6 a & b] demonstrates this
overt religious content, It is a series that directly influenced Robert Houle's seminal
work Parflechesfor the Last Supper (1 983). Here Newman transforms the sequence of
the Passion of Christ into M y abstract works. Robert Rosenblum believes that it was
partly Newman's Jewishness that allowed him to depict Christ's martyrdom in an
abstracted way. Rosenblum suggests that since images of the deity are proscnbed in the
Jewish faith, an abstract depiction, which would represent the essence and the spirit of the
Passion, was the only pictonal solution open to the artist? It is true that Newman is

that "neither the artist nor the biographer used the Kabbalah f?om a normative Jewish point of view.. ."

Jewish, and we do not know how he regarded ksus,but the pictorial tradition he cornes
from would probably influence his approach to a work that deals with the Passions of
Christ.

As has been demonstrated, twentieth-century artists have not only inherited a
landscape tradition that lent itself to the expression of spiritual ideas, but also the
quintessential twentieth-century visual language, abstraction, was itself motivated in part
by a desire to depict a reality beyond appearance. In Canada and elsewhere, mystical
philosophies and religions have directly or indirectly influenced artists. Some of these
philosophies, like Transcendentalism, promoted the already present love for the land.
Artists regarded the qualities of the land and landscape features as perfect metaphors for
conveying various spiritual concepts and ideas. They often acted as a symbol for a
greater reality or they evoked in their onlookers a sense of the might of its Creator.
Another theme that nins through the discussion of artists engaged with spintual ideology
is their move toward or adoption of a non-figurative language. Anti-matenalist
philosophies in the early part of the twentieth century proposed that it was no longer
enough to depict the material world and hope that it would evoke a spintual atmosphere.
A new language was necessary, one that had no relation to the physicd world, and hence
abstraction became favourcd. These artists also shared the conviction that the arts c m

and should be used for the uplifting of hurnanity and that the artist can play a crucial role
in this process12

Houle's interest in abstract art was reinforced due to his m t y for the works of
Newman and the spirituaiity expressed in them. Rogers has k e n striving to become
more abstract in his expressions and to move away fiom any references to the physical
world. Tobey, who also professed the same spiritual ideology, shared this attitude. Both
Rogers and Houle consider that their interest in religion and spirituality has Ied them to
consider the landscape as a perfect metaphor for conveyïng their spintual aspirations.
And both artists have chosen the formai language of abstraction as it demonstrates their
desire to go beyond the physical appearance of the materiai world.

However, their respective sources of spiritual ideology-the            spirituai teachings of
the Ojibway and the teachings of the Baha'i Faith-distinguish them fi-om artists inspired
by the Judeo-Christian tradition or the various mystical philosophies cobbled fiom
Eastern and Western spiritual traditions and science. In the history of Canadian art and
artists relatively little attention has been given to the influence of indigenous spiritual
traditions33in art, and even less to that of a young religion such as the Baha'i Faith. The
particular blend of landscape motifs with the language of abstraction, together with their

profoundly spiritual ideologies, makes the work of Robert Houle and Otto Rogers an
important subject of study for Canadian art history.

ROBERT HOULE
As dernonstrated in the previous chapter, there is a prominent history of &sts
whose interest in spiritual matters has led them to tum to the landscape as a metaphor for
mystical ideas. This tradition continues today, as can be seen in the work of the
contemporary Canadian artist Robert Houle. Since the early 1980s, Houle has shown an
interest in infusing many of his works with spiritual significance using abstracted
references to landscape. This chapter will explore the link between spkituality and the
laad in Houle's works and how he translates this idea into abstracted landscapes. It wilI
also examine the influence of the inter-cultural nature of his personai experience as an
individual who was raised in a Roman Catholic residentiai school but came fkom an
Ojibway-Saulteawc culture, as well as his more recent endeavours to embrace the
traditions of the Sun Dance-

both in Canada and abroad have been important to his development. Houle also served
nom 1977-1980as the first "curator of contemporary Indian art" of the National Museum
of Man, now the Canadian Museum of Civilization. He resigned because of
philosophical differences with the Museum's administration. The impact of his time at
that institution still reverberates in Houle's work. Those concems will be discussed later
in this chapter. Currently, Houle teaches at the Ontario College of Art and Design in
Toronto.

HouIe holds Bacbelors of Arts degrees in both Art History and Art Education.

Early on in his career Houle admired the Dutch abstract d s t , Piet Mondrian. Eventually
he turned away fiom Mondrian's work because, in his own words, "[ilt was European
and based on the Christian idea that man was the measure of al1 things. 1 couldn't corne

me. In his art one &ds a host of contemporary media, such as collage, text, sound, and
works in mixed media, but painting remains his most important form of expression.

Houle's experiences as a child and youth have influenced his art and are worth
exploring, as they also shed light on spiritual ideas that have informed him and on
attitudes toward the land. Robert Houle was bom in 1947 in St. Boniface, Manitoba. He
belongs to the plains Ojibway or Saulteaux bands that now live dong the shores and in-
flowing nvers of Lake Winnipeg.' Houle is a descendant of the Ojibway people who
migrated to the western part of Canada fkom the Great Lakes area in the late eighteenth
century.' His early childhood years were spent with his extended f d y on the Sandy
Bay Reservation in southern Manitoba, where he spoke his native language and
experienced traditional ceremonies, especially as performed by his grandparents.

The time when his loving family surrounded him soon came to an end, Like many
Native children of his generation, Houle was forced to attend a mission-nui residential
school and hence was removed both from bis Ojibway language and as well as his native
spiritual traditions. He attended the: Sandy Bay residentid school, the same school his

states, "the Bible is the single most important cultural influence on my shamanistic

shamans he knew, including Larry Bear fiom the Sandy Bay Reservation, who would
encourage him to go to church on Sunday, their reasoning being that it was the same God
they were worshipping. Houle explained that whereas the shamans were inclusive, the
Church was exclusive. It was only in his thirties that the artist realized that Roman
Catholicism was an undeniable part of himself, and that he had been ''weaned on it-" He
believes that he has a Christian tradition even ifhe is not practising it. However, he
argues that the specifics of Christian theology are irrelevant to himg

Although Houle sometimes feels tom between his native roots and the Christian
tradition, in the end he realizes that both are very much part of his identity. His ideology
is informed by the attitude of inclusiveness shown by shainans in his community. The
artist accepts both his Saulteaux roots as well as the Christian tradition he was raised in.
In fact the integration of both Native and Christian spiritual traditions is not uncornmon
among Native peoples. As the scholars Murray L. Wax and Rosalie H. W a x note,

During a January 2000 interview, Houle was asked what he thought "spirituality"

meant. He replied by saying, ccIntuitively1 don't know very much about it, but 1 have
been attracted to it in poetry and art" He gave as exampies both the poetry and
illustrations of the English artist, poet and mystic William Blake, the Dutch abstract artist
and Theosophist Piet Mondrian, the Canadian rnystical artist and promoter of Theosophy
Lawren Harris, and New York Abstract Expressionkt Bamett Newman+'*

Besides poetry and art, Houle also referred repeatedly to the spiritual significance
of dreams during the interview. Dreams and visions hold a great spiritual significance in
Ojibway traditions. It is during the so-cailed "vision quest7'when youth at puberty fast

particular Houle spoke about a recurrhg ciream that he had which was most disturbing to

become reality, as the world of dreams is closely related to real life. It was o d y when he
was able to receive help fkom a shaman back home in Winnipeg that he was cured of his
fears and no longer had such dreams. In an article entitled "The Great Dreamers" Houle

explains what dreams mean to him and links the activity of dreaming to creativity. He

> Communion with the past through dreams has [a] long tradition among the Ojibway, The world of

The importance that Houle gives to his dreams and dreaming in general shows that he
believes in spiritual worlds and conditions beyond this physical one and that drearns
continue to be of signifieance to him as they were to his ancestors.

It is quite remarkable that Houle should be so deeply steeped in the spintual
traditions of the Saulteawc, In the 1960s, when Houle was in his early menties, few
Saulteaux overtly practised their Native spiritual tradition^.'^ According to histonm
Christopher Vecsey,

Therefore, it required much detemiination and a conscious effort on the part of the
artist to re-leam howledge that was common arnong his ancestors. Part of this regaining
of Es Saulteaux identity has meant a concerted effort in re-leaming his native Ojibway
language and becoming well-versed in spiritual traditions. For example, he has studied
the medicinal powers of herbs." Traditionally the Ojibway were known for their
profound knowledge of the local flora,which enabled them to use wild plants for food
and medicine.18 Another example of Houle's interest in his Native heritage is his
participation in the Sun Dance which is one of the signincant spiritual traditions still
performed by Plains Indians, such as the ~aulteaux.'~

According to one scholar, the Sun
Dance has been of particular importance since it has been instrumental in the
revitalization and preservation of many traditional elements. It is an annuai ceremony
that revolves around renewal of the self as well as that of the world and is approprïately
held during spnngtime or in early ~ u m m e r ?During

An exploration of some of the salient features of Saulteaw spiritual traditions is
crucial to understanding Hode's work which expresses these cultural references to a
point. Although the object of this discussion is to understand the spiritual character of the
Saulteaw people, the scarcity of material on their heritage necessitates the use of more
general sources such as those on the Ojibwa people of the Great Lakes area and the Plains
Indians. In this case, even if fiom a western perspective there is a strong common ground
that binds dl Native spirihial traditions together, the nch diversity of each group should
be acknowledged. Another important factor to consider when iooking at Native spintual
traditions, or in fact any historical process, is the element of change. As Vecsey aptly
explains, "Indian religions have both changed and persisted over the last five hundred
years, as have the religions of the whites.""     Therefore, when reading about some of
these beliefs and ideologies one should keep in mind that they are constantly evolving.

Spiritual traditions afFected the everyday Iife of the Saulteaux people. For example,
in tirnes of difflculties the shaman's help was sought and people relied on his powers.
Among their youth, as with those of other Native groups, it was cornmon to go through a
''vision quest," as noted above. The Saulteaux are also known for the Midaoiwin,a
society whose main purpose was to train in the medical arts.24 Although the last regional
celebration of the Midewiwin occurred in 192625it seems to stili influence the Saulteaux

people. Houle's training in medicinal herbs, as noted earlier, reflects its enduring
influence.

For the Ojibway, as for most of the Native peopies afNorth America, spirïhiality
was so closely interwoven into everyday life that it was nat accorded a separate name. A
scholar in this field of study, Joseph E. Brown, believes tbat this is still true in the life of
contemporary Native cultures, even though it is hard to generalize and attitudes are
always shifting. He explains this concept in the following way,

> It has now become abundantly clear that it is a fundamental and universal characteristic of Native
> Amencan cultures, as indeed of al1 prima1 or primitive cultures, that b'religion"-there is no
> equivalent word for this in any Arnerican Indian language--is not a separate category of activity
> or experience that is divorced nom culture or society. Raîher, religion is prvasively present and
> is in complex interrelationships with al1 aspects of the peoples7 life-ways. 6

One idea that appears in the literature repeatedly is the dl-pemasive character of
spùitual principles in the everyday aspects of traditional Native life. The Ojibwa writer
Basil Johnston is best known for his autobiographical writings on the residential boarding

His more recent book, me Manitousr The Spiritual WorZd of the
school e~perience.~'
Ojibway, draws heavily on Ojibwa mythology to elucidate the spiritual character of the
life of the Ojibwa pe0ple.2~Johnston explains how for the Ojibwa a spiritual reality is
omnipresent:

28 Note that Johnston is writing specifically about the spiritual traditions of the Ojibwa of the Great Lakes
area rather than o f the Plains.

It was long assumed that people who were preoccupied with materid needs and wants would have

Even if Houle no longer Lives the traditional life that Johnston talks about, he nonetheless
follows the idea that the spintual world-like           the dream world-Ïs        closely connected to
the physicd one.

One signifïcant element in Native spirituality that has affected Houle's artistic
practice is his attitude towards and understanding of the land and its spiritual
significance. The close interconnectedness of spirituaiity and the land for Native peoples
of the past and, in many cases, the present is well docurnented in scholarship on Native
spiritudity. An exploration of these beliefs will help facilitate a better understanding of
Houle's artistic output.

Scholarship refers repeatediy to the solid interconnectedness between Native
spirituality and the natural environment; this suggests that the Native holistic view of life
did not allow them to distinguish absolutely between nature and divinity. They are
usually synonyrnous. In fact, the naturd world had such a profound impact on the Native
peoples of North America that the geographic specifics of their physicd environment had

between a ''hunting religion" and an 'cagriculturalreIigion." This division, for instance,
had an impact on the tribes' respective views on the afteriife- For hunting tribes, die

Vecsey takes this argument further and has identified three types of integration

This means that for example for huoting tribes, it is common to apologize to the animal

art objects celebrated and evoked nature?'

Although not a hunter himself, Houle as a Saulteaux belongs to the cultural group
of the Plains Indian who subsisted until recently on hunting and fishing. Reflecting this
heritage, he "place[d] tobacco around a young tree as an offering.. .to celebrate a
communion with nat~re.'"~This occurred during his residence as an artist at the
McMichaeI Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario, where he worked in the
former studio of Tom Thomson. With regard to the second integration, it has already
been mentioned that shamans featured prorninently in the life of the Saulteaux. Houle
himself feels close to and consults with sharnans in his home comrnunity in times of
need. In Saulteaux mythology we find evidence of symbolic integration in the fiequent
references to beings with anthropomorphic endowments. In Houle's art this occurs when
the artist evokes the land in his abstract paintings.

What all these scholars agree on is that nature is centrai to spiritual beliefs and to
lifè itseIf for Native North Americans. The natural world is the place of worship, a place
approached with much reverence, just as temples or churches are for the mainstream
religions. Similarly, for Houle, encounters with the natural world, for example during his
residencies in Winnipeg and Kleinburg, have had a profound effect on his artistic output
and his choice of using the landscape.

Since Houle has also been exposed to Christian thought and ideology, a b i e f
comment should ais0 be made on the Judeo-Christian view toward the land. The Old
Testament prominently contains several direct references to the land. Most discussions
on this issue refer to Genesis 1:28, where it mentions that the earth should be
ccsubdue[d]." Closely aligned to this idea is a concept that gained wide popularity in the
Christian world which originated in the writings and philosophies of Arïstotle and lefi its
mark through the Middle Ages d o m to the late eighteenth century, namely that the
universe is a "Great Chain of Being." According to Arthur Lovejoy, Aristotle proposed
that all creatures should be ranked accordhg to their degree, with human beings at the top
of the scale. God was considered at the very apex of this scale and infinitely higher than
any human being?

This contrasts to the Ojibway point of view where, according to Johnston, "no one
is granted primacy or dominion over the Earth or another ~pecies."~'This might or might
not include the superiority of a Supreme Being. In the pre-contact p e r i ~ dOjibways

~~,
supposedly believed that humans and animals were not very different fiom each other.
M e r contact with Europeans, Ojibways were recorded by non-natives to believe that
CCanimals

of the lowest, as weil as highest class in the chah of creation, are alike endowed
with reasoning powers and faculties," Vecsey continues,

Presently the artist's understanding of the land seems to be primarily drawn from
his Native roots rather than his Christian upbringing. And this should not only be
attributed to the fact that he was bom a Saulteau, but more importantiy to his conscious
efforts to study the traditions of his ancestors which is a means of afirrning his identity.
These traditions place great importance on the land and hence landscape painting
becomes a suitable vehicle to express his interest in spintual themes.

#en     asked in a recent interview, 'What is your relationship to the land, especially
considering that you live in the large urban environment of Toronto?" Houle explained
that his perception of time and place is more a matter of individual rather than collective
belief. He has no desire to go back to his ancestral lands. "You can bring that tirne and
space with yoy it is transportable and within you." Houle believes that the extemal
world is only a small part of an interior one. He has travelled to many places in his
dreamscape, what he terms his "inner land~cape."~'As early as 1978 the artist expressed
a similar relationship tu nature:

Like most people of Native heritage, Houle is not unrealistic or sentimentai in his
views about the natural world. His ancestors were very much aware of the potential
harshness of nature, the reality that o d y the fittest would survive and that taking a life or
giving one's own was expected. "[Tlhere was no aesthetic indulgence in the beauty and
drama of nature there was.. .an experience of nature as a realm of mystery. Nature

Houle appreciates and acknowledges the importance of the land for the spiritual and

hunting cultures, that the land cannot be ownedls For example, in his essay for the
National Gallery of Canada exhibition Land Spirit Power Houle states,

> There is no word for "landscape" in any of the languages of the ancient ones still spoken- In
> Ojibwa, whenever the word uhke is pronounceci, it is more an exaltation o f humamess than a
> declaration of property.46

This statement echoes the idea that there is no word in the many different Native
languages of North America to denote "religion7' because the spiritual aspect of Iife was
so interwoven into everyday concerns. Similady, it could be deduced from Houle's
words that landscape is so much part of the life and spiritual aspirations of the Ojibway
that it is not accorded a separate term. This reinforces the idea that there is a relationship
between spintuality and landscape in the worldview of Native peoples.

The loss of ancestral land, to Houle, does not only mean being deprived of the
source of food and shelter, but also has spiritual consequences. It has been one of the
causes of a grave identity crisis for generations of native North Arnericans. Houle has
supported the restitution of ancestml land through his politically engaged works and
statements made both as an artist and curator. His political and spiritual beliefs are
closely associated. His political advocacy on the issue of land claims is given expression
in the five mixed media paintings that constitute l'remises for SelfRule (1994). The artist

The green colourfield painting here takes
on a powerful metaphorical association with the land. According to writer and curator
Clara Hargittay, what is at the heart of this work are the "inherent rights to self-
determination" but it is the painting itself that embodies the spiritual aspect of this
quest4'

Thus far it has been established that a spirituai understanding of the land is of
primary value for Houle and this has translated into works of art that are irnbued with
spiritual significance. His Saulteaux roots and his Christian residential school expenence
both find expression in his art. His efforts to re-lem or deepen his lmowledge of his
native spiritual traditions have made him M e r aware of the importance of the land for
his and other people's well-being. This has translated into works where the abstracted
landscape plays a significant rote. More detailed analyses of some of his key works will
make the powefil motivation of spirituality clearer.

Houle repeatediy makes reference in his works to ideas, events and objects that
have iconographical value in Native traditions, Roman Cathoiic doctrine and liturgy, or
both. This tendency is evident in his work since the mid-1970s. Ali of the works that
will be discussed at length make reference in a direct or indirect manner to the land, or
visually resembie an abstract landscape. Hence the land emerges as a symbol for
spirituality in Houle's art. Houle acknowledges his use of aspects of his native Ojibway
culture in his art. In fact, he believes that '30 deny the legitimacy of this inspirational
source would be like refusing the Renaissance its Greco-Roman heritage..."M                        And in his
essay for the Land. Spirit, Power catalogue, Houle strongly urges contemporary Native
artists to "honour[. ..] their biahnght" and rerninds viewers that "no apologia is needed
for any native aesthetics at work in the creative process of these artists;.. ." He regards
contemporary Native artists as "the spintuai children of the ancient ones." Houle
believes that the new aesthetic that contemporary artists of Native ancestry are
formulating should draw inspiration fkom spiritual traditions by "involving the ritualistic
and sharnanistic art of the ancient ~nes.''~'These ideas and sentiments find expression in
the artist's own work and in his view of himself as a shaman-artist.

Indirect references to quillwork g o back to 1975, when Houle began to employ "small
taches and strokes to represent qudlwork in his painting."" They would remain a feature
in his work until the 1990s-

The Iikely reason Houle chose porcupine q d l s is that quillwork has a spiritual
significance for many Native peop3es. This activity relates to Manitou Be-na-si-ka or
"God making activity."" The repetitive nature of quillwork provided ample opportunity
for the mind and sou1 to contemplade God. Houle refers to beadwork, which often
replaced quillwork as trade with Euro-North Americans became more common~and

Before commencing quillwork7the Plains Indian women had

geometrical patterns that were created were equated with rays of the nin and hence held

Houle also employs these taches in a prht entitled Diamond Composition (1 980) in
the collection of the Hamilton Art Gallerysg Due to the nature of the medium, actual
porcupine quills are not used here but are represented by small parallel strokes. Here the
artist not only uses the small parallel lines but also employs another noteworthy feature-
a diamond-shape format with grïds. These compositional choices of the diarnond shape
and the grids aiso hearken back to Mondrian's Composition, Bright Colow Planes with
Grey Lines ( 1 919) Fig. 81.5' Victoria Henry observes that "...Houle has filled in his
spaces with his four stroke motif in a way that has no integral relationship to the
Mondrain [sic]concept of landscape and cityscape. Houle is overlaying his motifs on

The use of porcupine quills is aIso of philosophicai interest to Houle. Houle had
resigned fiom his position as a curator of contemporary Indian art at the Museum of Man,
as a way of showing his outrage with the lack of recognition accorded to the work of
contemporary Native artists. He believed that their art needed to be seen first and
foremost in art galleries rather than in the context of anthropological or ethnographic
artifacts, and recognized that contemporary Native art would never be recognized as
contemporary art as long as it was dispIayed and presented as the artwork of an extinct or
dying race. This does not mean that contemporary art produced by Native artists cannot
ernploy the-honoured symbols of Native North Amencan art. Since his resignation,
Houle has been interested in "liberating" traditional Native artifacts such as parfleches,

Pmfleches for the Lust Supper (1983) Fig. 11 a-m] demonstrates fidly how Houle
fuses his traditional Native values witi his Christian religious beliefs, using
contemporary art-makingvocabulary. It is therefore a reflection of the spiritual makeup
of the artist who created it. Spirituality is htrinsic to this work, which associates an
Ojibway rihial meal with the Last Supper of the New Testament. Although it does not
deal directly with the landscape, each parfleche is reminiscent of a flat prairie landscape
due to the repeated use of both inherent and painted horizontal

The word 'parfleche' cornes fiom the French tennparerflèche (to hun away
arrows) in reference to the irnpenetrable rawhide used? In the life of the traditional
Plains Indian, the folded rawhide was decorated and served as an envelope or pouch to
carry ceremonid objects or valuable personal items. As Plains hdians led a nomadic life
on the land, a pouch or parfleche was a necessary item to transport an individual's
valuables. As such, the presence of the parfleche motifmay be understood as an indirect
reference to the land. Parfieches have been a r e c h g feature in Houle's oeuvre,

62 William Blake, Aphorism on the Laocoôn Group. Houle chose this quote to head his entry ofthis work in
the exhiiition catalogue by the Stedelijk Museum, Notion of Conflictz22.
" The folded horizontal flap of the p d e c h e creates the illusion of a horizon line and hence the flat prairie
landscape. In addition to the horizontally mmhg flap, almost al1 of the thirteen panels have ritualistic luies
nmning parailel to the line created by the flap, hence reinforcing the idea of a landscape, At times the

especially since his resignation fkom the Museum of Man in 1980, and he has explored
their physical and spirituai qualities as recently as 1999." The aaist's aim in using
padeches, wamior staffs, and shields in hiç work bas been to revive and resurrect objects
that are of spiritual consequence to Native peoples. This resurrection and revival is
achieved in conjunction with centuries-old Christian themes or iconography.

In this work, Houle chose parfleches because they were an integral part of a
personal spiritual experience-a        naming ceremony of a sibling for which his mother had
prepared a ritual meal. The artist remembers a shaman coming to their home to
pronounce the secret name of his brother for the f k t t h e . Part of the ritual entailed
carefidly opening the flaps of a parfleche. Houle believes that the "ritual act of closuig,
folding and then opening and releasing" of a parfleche creates a spirituai aura." He uses
the idea of the ritual meaI and links it to another meal of grave spiritual consequence-
the Last Supper. The Last Supper is perhaps one of the best known events of the life of
Jesus. It was the last Passover meal that Jesus shared with his disciples before he was
crucified. During the evening Jesus distributed bread and wine and asked his disciples to
partake of these as his body and blood and therewith inaugurated the Christian sacrament
of Holy CornmUN~n.~'

See for example Manhew 26~20-28.

Houle explains that the parfleches for this work "were created out of the desire to
unite in a single continuum, the effects of Chnstianity on traditionai Saulteaux
spintuality."'    Perhaps what Houle is attempting here is a reversal of history by
appropnating Christian concepts, such as the Last Supper, to resurrect traditional Native
ideology and arWacts. Historically it was the Christian missionarïes who appropriated
Native concepts and changed them in such a way that they would be in accord with
Christian dogma but also more palatable to the concepts of the new converts.

This "dual state of being" has historicd antecedents. in the past, even those
Ojibway who professed to be Christians still interpreted and understood Jesus Christ
through their own traditional religious patterns. For example, some regarded Jesus as
another manito, one of the many powers. Others believed that Jesus would appear in
their dreams and help them with the hunt." Sunilarly Houle has stated that for him Jesus
is none other than a great ham man.'^ Vecsey explains this sirnultaneous belief in both
Christian dogma and Ojibway traditions:

> ...[slince their traditional religion adrnitted new revelation without nulliQing the old, they were
> abie to accept pieces of Christianity selecîïvely without disposing of corresponding traditional
> pieces. In short, they were able tu hold iraditional and Christian beliefs, participate in traditional

Porflches for the Last Sqper was inspired by a modern interpreîationof the
Passion of Christ-Bamett            Newman's Stations of the Cross ( 1 958- 1966) Fig. 6 a & b].
Newman's work gave Houle "the needed confidence and reassurance that religious work
could be abstract; an idiom limitless in appli~ability."~

But Houle greatly admires the
Absû-act Expressionists not only because of their formal language bu? also because of
their interest in the spiritual. As art historians Janet Berlo and Ruth Phillips explain,

> Robert Houle ...was attracted as a student to the formal language o f abstraction, and particularly to
> the art of Baniett Newman and the New York Abstract Expressionists. Houle responded in

Newman chose the traditional fourteen panels to depict the Passions of Christ. His
highly abstract and austere interpretation of the Stations of the Cross is, according to one
critic, not concemed with death but rather "Resurre~tion."~~

Houle's PaMechesfor the
Last Supper is made up of thirteen parfieches, representing the twelve Aposties and
Christ.

Both Houle and Newman are cornmitted to abstraction as their visual vocabulary.

Neither is illustrating an idea or painting an allegory, yet each is able to capture the
spiritual essence of these events. The adoption of an abstract mode of expression was not
only an outcorne of Houle's academic training, which introduced him to modemism-

There are also historical precedents in Native cultural traditions for avoiding pure
representation. c'Reahation that he [the Native artist] could not draw a flower as
perfectly as it was made by the Creator, led hùn to seek out the spirit, or essence, of the

...fl~wer."~'According to Houle, his Ojibway ancestors sought out the essence of the
object and hence made a move from representation toward abstraction. Houle believes
that just like traditional Native artists in the past, so today "[clontemporary Native artists
often follow a similar course, seeking graphically to represent emotions, spirihial essence,
or unseen forces hidden behind a subject's physical façade.'"

In the area of colour, Houle's work is distinguished fiom that of Newman. Whereas
Newman restricted his palette to raw canvas, various blacks and (in three of the Stations)
white, Houle uses in most instances bold, primary colours. He uses a bright yellow cross
for Jesus, a colour which also refers to the Sun Dance. Instead of the raw canvas that
Newman employs, Houle uses handmade paper and porcupine quills as accents. These
natural materials create a sharp contrast to the a q l i c paint used. The choice of colour
and materials, made up of natural and synthetic, symbolizes the ''two seemingly
irreconcilable polemics of the Sun dance and Catholicism," according to Houle?

cosnology, the four cardinal directions signSy the uni@ of creation.P1' ï h i s cross, which
we will see again in later works, has shafts equal in length, intersecting at their middles,
with a point at the centre. For Plains Indians, this point is not o d y the centre of the
circle, which is held sacred, but also unites within itself the four directions of the cross
and represents a human being." This is why the concept of "centrality" can be found in
many rituals such as the Sun Dance, a ceremony in which Houle takes part as often as he
can. According to Houle, this cross is also syrnbolic of a natural phenornenon: Venus,
the Morningstar, the first and last star in the ~ k y . ~ ~

PMeche # 8 Thomas is executed in black with only two thui horizontal lines in red
and white, as well as porcupine quills breaking out of the darkness. Houle appropriates
the story of Thomas's doubting of Christ and recasts it as the ccdoubtingof one's identity"
or "the doubting of one's culture.""       He achieves this by contrasting the dark parfieche of
Thomas with the bright yellow one of Jesus. As the colour yellow may refer to the Sun
Dance, a Plains Indian who doubts bis or her identity could be characterized by a
dualistic, sharply contrasting colour scheme.

Although not al1 of his works try to convey a spiritual message according to the
artist, Pageches for the Last Supper is a spintual work? It dernonstrates his interest in
his dud spintual roots-hïs         native Saulteaux traditions and his Roman Catholic
upbringing. In it he successfully bridges the gap between the two so that it sometimes
becomes dinicult to distinguish between these two unique sources of inspiration.
Through the use of the parfieche he has resurrected a spirihially significant Native article
and bas attempted to give it a place in the history of Christianity and hence Western
society. He creates a work that is both spintudly meanin@ to an Ojibway as well as a
Christian.

This series of four paintings executed in 1989 [Fig. 121, directly inspired by the
Parjlcchs for the Lmt Supper, deais both with the concept of the land as well as with a
specific spintual place that is closely related to Houle's Saulteaux hentage. Like
ParjZeches for the Last Supper, it is a bi-cultural work in which Houle's tribal beliefs and
Christian upbringing meet.

This series was produced in response to the Manitoba environment, at a tLne when
Houle was an artist-in-residence at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in 1989. Although Houle

\[85\] Interview with Robert Houle, Toronto, 25 Jan. 2000-

states that he carries the land within hùn, nevertheless his experiences during his two
residence programs show that the physical environment that surrounds him affects hirn
and his art in a significant way." In 1989, both his experiences as an artist-in-residence
at the McMchael Canadian Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario, and at the Winnipeg Art
Gallery, moved the artist to explore the subject of the land with a fiesh outlook. The
scholar of contemporary Native art, Gerald McMaster, explains how Houle realized he
had no personal vocabulary for depicting the landscape during his tirne as an artid-in-
residence at the McMichael. He immersed himself in his surrounding landscape and
realized that "Place took on a new meaning. It takes you there, you don't take it away.""
The outcome of Houle's McMichael experience was Seven in Steel (1 989) Fig. 131. This
work commemorates seven extinct Native tribes in steel, a material purposefiilly chosen
for its quality of permanence. Seven in Steel makes reference not only to art objects in
the McMichael collection, such as a Çagment of a totem pole and a traditional hunting
scene by Inuit artist Parr, but also to the landscapes of the Group of Seven and Tom
T h o r n s ~ n .Similarly,

~~        the Manitoba landscape had a great impact on Houle during this
specific time in Winnipeg, which resulted in the production of his monumental work The
Place Where God Lives. The example of these two large works seems to suggest that the
actual physical landscapes surrounding Houle have had a signincant effect on his artistic
output and partly inçpired him to explore the subject of the land.

Nthough Houle has retaïned some of the themes found in Par-echesfor the Last
Supper, this later work differs in many ways. Most importantiy, unlike the eadier work,
it was directly inspired by his experience of the Winnipeg landscape, with which he is
intimately familiar. This may explain why these panels have sornething so very personal

colours. According to McMaster, '90 Houle colours are religious.'"'           In a 1992 series

Matthew is predominantly red, P M @ green, Thomas ochre and Bartholornew blue. The
distinctiveness of each panel is enhanced a .given its own character through the use of
gestural marks, including crosses as weli as vertical, horizontal and oblique lines, the
latter probably making referenîe to quillwork. What they hold in cornmon is an allusion
to the flat prairie landscape of Manitoba, as Houle mpeatedly uses horizontal lines and
brushstrokes, particularly in the upper half of the canvas. The ambiguity of îhe horizon
line in the prairie landscape intrigues Houle. This ambiguity, he suggests, is rnystical.
For the artist, Iight is an important part of these panels, as it is light that renders the
horizon line hazy and creates a mystical aura. "The mist fkom the Lake or the grayness of

Houle sought out a painterly way to appropriate the landscape. By using the format

panels to be read as landscapes. The artist explains his intentions with this work in these

Gerdd McMaster agrees with Houle and states that, "The paintings make ailusions
to landscape, but are not landscape paintings. niey are about a special place. They are
landscapes for the mind."g5 It seems reasonable to state that these four panels do not
"represent" a landscape, nor do they depict the Narrows of Lake Manitoba. They act fïrst
and foremost as metaphors for a greater reality, as symbols of a spiritually powemil
place. However, one could disagree with McMaster, instead tenning them "landscapes of
the soui" as they have a meditative quality conducive to meditation and contemplation.
Their appeal is not so much intellectual, or structural, but operates through the use of
colour and signs, emotion and s y m b ~ l . ~ ~

The four panels also refer to the parfleches for Matthew, Philip, Thomas and
Bartholomew (sketches numbers 1,5,7, and 8). Why has Houle associated a significaat
Saulteaux sacred place with four Apostles from his Christian heritage? He may be
associating a sacred Saulteaux place with a sacred Christian topic in order to bring it to
the consciousness of his non-Native audience. In addition, the number four is signincant
in both traditions. Each panel represents one of the four directions, held sacred in Native
spirihiality, while aiso referring to the four Gospels in the New esta ment.^' Typically,
Houle successfully interweaves these seemingly coniradictory sources.

95 McMaster, "Persistence of Land Claims," 42.

\[96\] However, it needs to be pointed out that for Houle, issues conceming the land are never fàr fkom political
assertions of self-determination and self-rule- Curators have, for example, discussed this work in terms of
"reappropriating and reclairning Manitoba-" See McMaster, "Persistence of Land Claims," 42 and Susan
DougIas, "Crossroads Visualism: Robert Houle," Purachute, no. 80, Oct-Dec 1995,45,

\[97\] Conversation with Robert Houle, Toronto, 8 October 1999. Despite this reference to the four Gospels,
the artist nowhere explains why he did not select Mark, Luke and John.

Shirley Madill States that ''the landscape, both physical and spiritual, is important
to him as a means of understanding both one's past history [sic]and fùture path.'" This
notion of identity is a recrrrring theme Ï n Houle's oeuvre and is a fundamentally spiritual
activity. Without knowing oneself, it is difficult to realize one's place in the world.
Lacking awareness of one's identity makes it impossible to positively contribute to
society. The land continues to give Native peoples, like Houle, a source of identity and is
wedded to their spiritual weU-being.

The relationship toward the land, as experienced by people of Native background
who have to live in a society that largely does not share their views, is a source of crisis
and conflict with regards to identity- Art histonan Gerhard HofEnann has identified t h i s
issue as central to many works by contemporary Native artïsts- He wrïtes,

One of Houle's works that shows a "defÜnctY'version of nature is Zero Hour
(1 988). Here the artist deals with the apocalypse of a technology-driven society, warning
against a possible nuclear disaster through the depiction of an ominous "mushroom"

of nature.

M a t *es      us imrnediately about these four canvases is their physicality. Both in
terms of physical scde and boldness of colour, they stand out Scale is an integral part of
the composition and is necessary if the arn'st wishes to elicit feelings of awe fiom his
audience. Houle has fuifilled the requirements for depicting the sublime that Longinus
set down in his book On the SubZM in the £iracentury AD. He is able to create a sense
of vastness which in tum inspires awe?" To convey the idea that we are looking at the
dwelling place of God, we need to be either overwheimed, and taken over by the
grandness of these panels (each 244.0 x 182.4 cm) or to sense that we are intimately
embraced and irnrnersed in a sea of colour. The Abstract Expressionists, upon whose
work Houle has drawn repeatedly, accentuated scale. We need oniy remember the large
atmospheric canvases of Mark Rothko or the immense austere panels of Barnett
Newman. The latter believed that the sublime was ccman'snatural desire for the
e~alted."'~'The German theologian Rudolf Otto proposes that the sublime is "the most
effective means of representing the nu minou^."'^^ This hearkens back to the ideas of the
Northern Romantic artists who understood that scale was the perfect means to elicit

figures or animals as staEages, to make the landscape appear grander.
Sandy Bay

One of Houle's most recent and noteworthy works is San& Bay (1998-1999) Fig.
141, a highly persona1 piece hearkening back to his residential-school years on the Sandy
Bay Reservation- S a n e Bay can move the viewer in such a way that we feel both the
loss and suffering of the artist and at the same tùne his victory and happiness in dealing
with and overcoming a deep-seated pain. Curator Madill describes Sandy Bay as a
"healing work" where "an inner state of turnult ...can be quelled but not c ~ r e d . " ' ~

Although traditional Native iconographical motifs such as porcupine quills or the
characteristic cross of the four directions appear here, they remain secondary to the main
theme of the work, which once again addresses the duai identity of the artist. In this
work, however, his school years at a mission-nui residential school, where he was
forcefblly divorced fiom his Saulteaux culhue, takes precedence. His reference to the
landscape is cruciai in understanding this emotionally charged painting-

San& B q consists of five parts, which can be read £rom left to right. On the far
left, we see two photographs drymounted on masonite, one depichg an Oblate priest in a
garden, the other an image of the FKst Communion class, which includes the artist's
sister. Next we move to a large, almost monochromatic panel rendered in grisaille, in
which Houle has Left aside abstraction, and depicted his old school on a winter day. The
artist pointed out in conversation that the school building he had painted has no doors,
oniy windows, signifjbg that no one could corne in or go out of the school.'05 Paint
running down the lower ha& toward the bottom of the canvas, strongly suggests stxeams
of tears. Houle also employs text in this work, as he has in many others. He has included
an Ojibway lullaby that his mother used to sing to him: ON SAMKIKISEWATIS ANA
ANITOWIYAN ("Oh you are so kind and so heasured although you are g~d-iike'').~~~

The
lullaby may be a reminder that the speaking of Ojibway was strictly forbidden at the
school. An act of defiance, it is written in capital letters in the same space as the
residentid school building, just to its lower lefi. It also reminds the viewer that children
had to live far away fiom their parents and their mothers's lullabies. In this way they
were not o d y removed fiom the lovhg care of theü families, but also depnved of two
important cultural transmitters: mother and language. A narrow panel of the same height
follows in blue, a colour that spells spiritudity for the artist. Looking carefully one can
discem in the upper-half a semi-abstract landscape in Hue-black representhg the
landscape of Sandy Bay. The last, purely abstract panel, is painted in a beautifiilly rich

red, with Houle's characteristic gestural Lues and marks. Towards the lower centre of the
panel one can see short, dark red, parallet lines, perhaps a reference to quillwork and
towards the lower lefi the traditional Saulteaux cross is placed.

The use of white, blue and red may act as a reminder to the audience of the colours
of the British and French conquerors whose manifold impact on the native population
included the residentid s c h ~ o l s . 'Residential

Writing about his personal expenence at the residential school in Sandy Bay, the
artist States, "One dismal outcome of the residential school system is a self-image which
varies fiom marginality or uivisibility to one which is harshly oppressed or openly

oldest child he felt responsible for protecting his younger sibiings but instead he
compIied through his silence and felt guilty for doïng so."O

One of the fonder mernories Houle had at the Roman-Catholic-run residential
school was when he was asked to meet with a hi&-fanking pnest, who later became a
Cardinal. He felt that he was accorded a special privilege since he was the only student
asked to meet with the pnest. Looking back, Houle wonders whether he was singIed out
to detennine if he would make a good pnest himself. Besides this one incident, he
remembers resisting the priests and nuns at the school, p a d y because of the theology
they professed and partly because he was too Young. He saw them more as figures of
authority than as "spiritual beacons." Houle remembers that around grade five or six he
would go into the chape1 looking for signs of Jesus, To his great disappointment, he did
not find any."'

While working on San& Bay,Houle was very involved with his past and it created
much anguish and many tears. But these tears he believes were part of a cleansing,
healuig process that he needed to go through. He feels that through this work, he has
now dealt with his past in the residentid school and overcome this burden. Artist and
Native writer Bonnie Devine reiterates Houle's words when she explains that, in her

culture, 'the process of telling is sacred and honoured.. ..[it] contains the possibility of
heaith and re~onciliation.''~~~

The monochromatic photographs, togetber with the gray-blue-white depiction of the
school building, represent Houle's past. As the faded colours suggest, these memones
are fading and no longer haunting the artist. The blue canvas acts as a catalyst between
past and present, between a cultural discontinuity and an assured identity. Particularly
noteworthy is Houle's use of a semi-abstract landscape in this panel. The primacy of the
land, as a source of identity and spiritual well-being, cornes once again to the fore in this
work. It seems plausible that this blue panel with its landscape is important not only for
the unfoldùig of the work (or the story) but for coming to terms with his p s t . His
association with and closeness to the land will give him the strength to accept this "dual
date of being." It should also be noted that as the work moves fiom left to right, it
becomes increasingly abstract, with the last panel being void of any kind of reference to
the physical world. Hence the semi-abstract landscape, though acknowledging the
spiritual importance of the land, is also the last reference to this material world. The last
panel signals the arriva1 of the artkt at his final destiny-he       has found a balance between
the seemingly contrary cultures he knows. He uses a rich red as his main colour, making
reference to his Native roots. We aiso recognize the characteristic cross, referrhg to the

four directions which are held sacred in Native mythology and the oblique Iïnes refening
to quillwork. Everything else is pure abstraction.

This work can also be read in another way. The photograph of the school children
represents how non-Natives view people of Native heritag-as           the other, people who
need to be "civilized" in a European-style school system. The la* panel, which is
abstract, represents Houle's true identity, namely the way he sees himself. This syncretic
identity consists of traditional Native, reconstructed Native culture and Christian
ideology. Houle is stressing that what matters is not any physical or outwardly signs of
being of Native heritage but rather the spintud comection that is felt in the sou1 of an
individual. And this deep-seated identification with Houle's Native culture is nowhere
better represented than by his relationship to the land-

The use of the land, Mother Earth, is also sigoificant because it equates in the
traditions of the Ojibway with motherhood and womanhood."' For example in the peace
pipe smoking ceremony the second whiff of tobacco is offered to the land in
thanksgiving with words such as these, "To you, Mother, we give thanks.. .. M e n 1 am
hungry, you feed me; when 1am cold and wet, you shelter me; when 1am downcast, you
cornfort me. For this a m I gratefd, 1 am indebted to y o ~ . " " ~The mother figure not o d y

roots md identity.l's This M e r strengthens the argument that the land, and its
translation into a landscape in Houle's art, are crucial to the aaist's identity.

Hofkan observes that the reference to the land in the work of contemporary
Native aaists is significant and is an afhnation of their native roots. He writes,

> ...îhe Native artist is confronted with the fact that, Iike it or no& Indianness still defines his or her

Vecsey concurs that, "We cannot deny that today Amencan Indians do express an intense
association with the environment that identifies them as Indians."' l7

AIthough a highiy personal work of a cathartic nature, Sandy B q contains a
universal message: a personal spintual renaissance is possible through the understanding
of one's spintuai traditions, in this case through close identification with the land, in
order to overcome past SUffe~gs.For Native peoples who in early childhood were
removed fiom their homes to be brought up in an environment that was totally unfamiliar
and where any mention of one's spiritual and cultural heritage was forbidden, a great deal

of effort is requued to once again feel close to that culture. Perhaps the first step in that
spintual revival is an appreciation of the spirihial importance of the land to the Native
worldview.

Houle's interest in the spirituai and its expression in his art are clearly central to his
work. The art& is able to weave elements of both Saulteaux and Christian spiritual
iconography into his works of art. His more recent immersion üito his native culture has
meant a closer identification with the land and a greater understanding of its spirihial
signincance. This new understaading, together with his experiences as artist-in-
residence, have led Houle to explore the subject of the land in an innovative and
meaningful way. His references to the land have alluded to the once nomadic life-style of
the Plains Indians, as in P-fleches for the Last Supper. In me Place Where God Lives,
Houle uses the image of the land to refer to a place held sacred in Saulteaux mythology.
And in Sandy Bay the landscape acts as a reminder that the land is significant for the
spiritual happiness of Native peoples and that it helps them gain a better understanding of
their own identities. Using the formd language of contemporary art,Houle introduces
elements of his two spirituai traditions, which to an untrahed eye could easily go
unnoticed. Abstraction becomes a suitable vehicle to express cultural ideas in ail of these
three major works discussed.

or matenal aspects of life. They also share the fact of their u p b ~ g i n g

on the Canadian
prairies; its influence is manifest in their repeated use of the landscape motif. The most

Although predominantly known for his landscape paintings, Otto Rogers has also
produced a number of still lifes, portraits, collages and sculptures over the course of his
long career, which spans forty years. His works have been widely exhibited in al1 parts
of Canada, as well as in Europe and the United States. He taught art at the University of
Saskatchewan for thirty years (1959-1988) and acted as head of that department for

several years. He has participated in and later coordinated several programs at the
celebrated Emma Lake workshops held in Saskatchewan.'

It was Rogers's art instructor at teachers' college in Saskatoon, Wynona Mulcaster,
who introduced him to the works of such twentieth-century masters as Georges Braque,
Pablo Picasso, &M Matisse and Paul Klee through illustrations in books. Rogers was
irnmediately drawn to their works. Muicaster encouraged him to study fine arts and he
left for Wisconsin, where he received a Bachelors degree in art education and a Masters
degree in fine art. Upon the completion of his degrees, Rogers retumed home to
Saskatchewan where he started his career in the academic world and as an artist-
Although the Emma Lake workshops, closely connected to the New York School of
colour field abstractionists, were innuential for many painters of his generation, Rogers
claims to feel more affnity to the European masters than to those artists generationally
closer to him such as the Abstract Expressionists. However he does admire Pollock,
Rothko, Still, Gottlieb, Johns, and Rauschenberg and learned fiom their example "the
abandonment, or large-scale, what Greenberg would cal1 'Big Attack' approach.. .
Rogers's work is iduenced by ''the totality of the image, the idea of continuous space
that you have in Pollock; also the simplicity of the image..."'

From 1988 to 1998 Rogers lived abroad and accordingly has been somewhat less
visible in the art scene in Canada Until 1998 he was serving in a senior administrative
role at the Baha'i World Centre in Haïfa, Israel. As there are no clergy in this religion,
Baha'is fiom dl over the world either volunteer to serve or are elected or appointed to
international institutions at its World Centre. During Es residency in Haifa, Rogers had
time to paint only on weekends but still managed to have one exhibition per year in
Canada. He has now settled back in Canada and Iives and works in Ontario.

ROGERS'S UlWERSTARiDRVG OF SPIMTUALITY

Rogers has been descnbed by one cntic as a LLself-consciously

religious
painter...whose art is dedicated to the worship of God as manifest in the Persian Prophet,
Baha'u'Ilah."'     It is in this light, rather than nom a purely fonnal standpoint, that
Rogers's work needs to be addressed. The artist's search for spiritual meaning was
present long before he heard of the Baha'i Faith. In his childhood, contemplation of the
natural world led him to feel that there was something more important than this physical
world. As he States, "Al1 things were moving and 1 knew that my motion had a Mover- 1
saw in this environment a part of the creation and without hesitation 1 loved its Creator.'"

Rogers explained in a phone conversation on 26 June 2000 fiom his home in
Ontario, that his parents did not belong to any particular church, although they were God-

fearing and pious people. He grew up in a home where he was taught not to have any
prejudices and saw how his parents treated everyone equally, regardless of their ethnic
background. His father, particdarly, embraced anything that was new and progressive.
For example, he would always use the latest farming implements on his f m . He
believed that everything that was progressive and not destructive was good. Rogers
attributes this openness of muid, lack of prejudice and lack of ties to any particular
organized religion as important elements in his upbringing that encouraged him to more
fieely and independently investigate a new religioa8

Living on a vast farm in the prairies and behg the youngest child in the family,
Rogers was often left alone with nature, whose imrnensity impressed him. He had close
association and therefore developed an d f k i t y with nature- Rogers feels that there is a
definite link between his enthusiasm about God, his love for nature and his search for
something new that ultïmately has found expression in his religious beliefs and his art.

One of the spintually significant moments in his life occurred when Rogers was
o d y fourteen. His mother bought the first book the family ever owned-a                     copy of the
Bible. He read it with much enthusiasm and was especially struck by the following
passage:

Ask, and it shalI be given you; seek, and ye shall fmd; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

\[8\] Phone interview with Otto Rogers, 26 June 2000.

For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seekth findeth; and to him that knocked it shall be
opened. (Matthew, 7:7-8)'

Next to his experience with nature, this verse fanned his interest in his quest for spiritual

tnith. Although Rogers did not know what '?ruth'' might be, he felt the inclination
toward some greater purpose or idea in his life. This search came to a momentary end
when Rogers discovered his love for the arts in teachers college, However, he soon came
to believe that art is but a reflection of the truth. Not long after, while studying for his
Master's degree in Wisconsin, he met Barbara Nelson, his future wife, who introduced
him to the Bahii'i Faith." At this point Rogers did not ask many questions about this
young religion or its validity, even d e r having a Bahd'i wedding ceremony. Rogers
explained that as soon as he heard the words of Baha'u711ah, he felt that they came from
the same source as the Lord's prayer. He did not distinguish between Christianity and the
Baha'i Faith. He felt that they were essentially one, but because the latter was more
recent, it was more progressive and suited lis purpose better. He compared his decision
to embrace the Baha'i Faith to his father7sapproach of always buying the latest
equipment for the farm. l1 In 1960 while living in Saskatoon, Rogers officially joined the
Baha'i Faith. At this point, he felt that he had found the truth he had been searching for.
He has on numerous occasions stated that the Baha'i Faith has been an important source
of inspiration not only for his life but also for his art.

'Conversation with Otto Rogers, Haifa, Israel, 25 Dec. 1997.
'O   Ibid.

\[11\] Phone conversation with Rogers, 26 June 2000.

Unlike Native spiritual beliefs, the Baha'i Faith is relatively new in tenns of
religious history-less     than 200 years old-and        hence there is ample documentary
matenal and original scripture available for study. The Bahii'i Faith is characterized by
an inter-related and clearly stated set of core beliefs. It is an independent religion that
onginated in Persia (now Iran) in 1844 and, according to the 1992 Emydopuedia
Britannica Book of the Year, is one of the most geographically wide-spread religious
movements in the world. It was founded by Bahii'u'llah (18 17-1892) who detailed its
laws and teachings in over 100 volumes. A monotheistic religion, it teaches that al1
religions corne fiom the same divine source and essentially promote the same spiritual
truths. It postulates that humankind is fundamentally one, regardless of race, nationality,
sex or class.

The principle of the oneness of hurnankind, as defined by Bahh'is, is central to
Rogers's artistic practice; he repeatedly refers to the concept of unity and more
specifically, ''unity through diversity" when discussing his art. Accordmg to the Baha'i
teachings, unity is of pivotd importance.LzIt is the ultimate goal, be it at the level of the
family, the nation or the planet.13 The Baha'i writings tipulate, however, that unity is not
to be understood as uniformity; rather, it is seen as "unity in diversity." These writings
also claim that unity does not imply a suppression of îhe diversity of race, culture or

\[12\] Some of the passages where Baha'u'llah talks about unity can be found in Gleaningsfiom the Writings of
Bahd 'u'WJ,  (London: BahU hblishuig Tmst, 1978), 2 15,2 18,286.

nationality,l4 Rogers embraced the idea of d t y in diversity early on in his life and found
confinnation of these ideas in his discovery of the Baha'i Faith. He believes that the

The concept of unity in diversity is heavily stressed and often repeated by
Baha'u'llah and in other books &en              about aspects of the Baha'i Faith. Rogers is
stmngly infiuenced by his religion and is eager to attribute his approach and themes to
the innuence of his religious beliefs. Therefore it is perhaps not surprising that he is able
to place many of his works in the context of religious scnpture. For example, Rogers
uses his painting El Greco Fervor (1986) pig. 151 to explain this concept." It is one of
his many abstract bi-partite compositions where the canvas is divided horizontally, as in
this case, or vertically. Light colours such as whites, yellows and light blues characterize
the upper half of the painting. The paint is applied in such a way that it creates a swirling
motion. The lower half of the canvas is executed in a dark pink-tone with a texture
reminiscent of stucco. Geometric blocks in browns and blacks are placed dong the edges
of the canvas. In tems of colour, texture and movement the two halves are very difFerent
and yet they are unined. The artist explains:

> The desire for transcendence creates in my artistic struggle discontent with a minimum response,
> with ordering known arrangements, I am led to a juxtaposition of diverse elements which one
> might not expect to be together, such as the static opaque geometric blocks and the moving
> transparent space of the sky. These diverse elements are held together in one drama which aspires
> to a unity through diver~ity.'~

nahird world to explain spintual principles? This is because in the Bahh'i cosmology
the physical world is a means of gaining access to the spintual world in the same way
that a mirror is a vehicle by which light is conveyed."

The writings of the Bahti'i Faith further relliforce the idea that the use of physical
metaphors is useful in explaining spiritual aspirations by suggesting that human
knowledge is of two different kinds. The fist kind of knowledge is about things that are
perceived through the senses and are based on physical objects or phenornena. The
second kind of knowledge, which includes ideas of the spirit and spinhiality, is

For example, using the metaphor of the natural world, the principle of unity in
diversity is elaborated upon in the BaWi writings in the followùig way by 'Abdu'l-Bah&:

> Let us look rather at the beauty in diversity, the beauty of harmony, and l e m a lesson fkom the

This p ~ c i p l manifests

e         itself in Rogers's paintings, which have been descnbed as "static
dynamism," where "the manipulation of forms, cotour and textures.. .create[s] a sense of
balanced tension between opposing forces?               The lamiscape is a suitable metaphor of
this principle as it contains diverse elements, textures, and colours, and is yet transcended
by an overall unity.

This interest in creating unity fkom diversity rnanifests itself in his working method
and use of tools as weU. If in the beginning of his career Rogers employed only one
medium, since the 1970s he has predominantly been producing multi-media works
perhaps in an effort to demonstrate the principle of unïty through diversity. For example,
he has made nurnerous collages, and paintings are executed no longerjust with a
paintbrush but also with a spray gun and at times include charcoal and modelling paste.
Other techniques include rubbing colours with a rag, blottiag colours with paper towels,
and using rollers, and scraper^.'^ In one work he combines the use of very thick paint
with very diluted paint or even water. Although there is complexity due to the various
techniques and materials in a work, nevertheless the artist7sultimate goal is to attain a
simplified image."

The Baha'i sacred texts on the importance of the arts are also relevant to this
discussion of the influence of the Baha'i Faith on Rogers's oeuvre. The arts are regarded
highly within this religion and together with sciences and crafls are seen to be necessary

\[26\] L.Bell, "A Message of Celebration and Supplication," 22.

\[27\] The concept of unity through diversity d s o is evident in a series of experirnents with collage work that
Rogers made during the mid- to late f 970s. He wanted to do something that bridged sculpture and
painting. This resulted in a series of "fiabricationson plywood," each ofwhich contain a physical efement
such as a piece of rope, his leather belt, comgated cardboard and strips of canvas. Among these is Sdver
Field of 1976, which is reminiscent of a prairie winter scene, The artist has appiied acrylic paint as well as
charcoal to two pieces ofraw canvas, which in tum are afiixed to a board of partiy exposed plywood.
Despite-or as Rogers would argue, b e c m e o f 4 e diversity in terms of physicality and visual effect of
the materials employed, the viewer &ces a coherent and unified picture; Other examples include Power of

> manifests itself in beautifid harmonies. Again, shining though the mind of a poet, it is seen in fine

The Bahk'i writings do not impose a specific faith-based iconographicd program
on artists and Baha'is "are [noq trying to develop a Baha'i school of painting or writing."
At the same t h e as Bahii'i artists are 'Ykee to paint, write and compose as their talents

they are encouraged to "exercise a leadership role in restoring to a
guide themYm0
matenalistic society an appreciation of reverence as a vital element in the achievement of
true liberty and abiding happiness."' The Baha'i Faith proposes that the Prophets of God
do not so rnuch teach the arts, but provide a tremendous cultural impetus which
eventually and gradually leads to the creation of new art. The Baha'i wrîtings fiirther
explain that Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and other religions have each in their tum
produced different styles and movements of architecture and painting.'*

The Baha'i Faith's promotion of the arts might partly explain the attraction and
later adherence of a number of artists to the Baha'i Faith13 In the West, one of the best
known artists who was a follower of the Baha'i Faith was the Arnerican painter Mark
Tobey (1 890- 1W6), as noted in Chapter 1. A s there is no "Baha'i school of painting," it
becomes clear why there is no necessary artistic continuity between earlier Baha'i artists
such as Tobey, and younger artists such as Rogers. The very concept of uni@ in diversity
and other aspects of the Faith may make the emergence of a single "style" ideologically
inconsistent. These concepts seem to cal1 for and encourage a diversity of artistic
expression rather than a uniform and formulait approach to art.

However, Tobey and Rogers have a significant commonality: their shared attitude
toward spintual principles and their choice of abstraction as a forrnal laquage. Their use
of an increasingly non-objective mode of painting might reflect their interest in moving
away and showing detachment fkom the physical world, which is syrnbolic of their quest
to make the viewer aware of a greater reaiity. Tobey also had a more direct influence on
some of Rogers's e d y works. Some still-life paintings the young artist executed in the
early 1960s such as UntitZed (Still Life) pig. 1q (196l), now in the collection of the
Winnipeg Art Gallery, have Tobey's characteristic "white writing" style. White writing

\[33\] A portrait painter narned Juliet ïhompson introduced Mark Tobey to this reIigious movement in 1918.

In Europe the potter, and father of the studio pottery movement, Bernard Leach (1 887-1979) became an
adherent. It was Tobey who introduced both Leach and the latter's college fiend, the South AEcan artist
Reginald Turvey (1882-1968) to the teachings of Bahh'u'llilh- The three artists formed a close bond of
çiendship based on shared spintual beliefs and their cornmitment to excellence in their respective artktic
fields. See Arthur L-Dahl etai-, M d Tob-Art         andBeiieJ (Oxford: George Ronald, 1984)- L. Johnson,

was the culmination of Tobey's years of interest and study of vanous Eastern cdligraphic
styles. It is characterized by innumerable Lines, often in white, swirling and criss-
crossing the canvas. One such work that epitornizes this style is Medirative Series VIII
(1954) Fig. 171. Rogers acknowledges the infiuence of Tobey in his own work of the
early sixties. His use of gouache, a medium that the more senior artist fiequently
employed, also reflects Tobey's i . ~ e n c e . ' Both

~    artists appear to be stnvïng to
incorporate spiritual principles in their attitude towards both the process and the product
of their art. They are also among those artists who see spiritual content as a paramount
aspect of their abstract work.

Rogers repeatedIy equates the creation of art with the worship of GO^.^' In fact, the
Baha'i writings indicate that any work perforrned in the spirit of service and to the best of
one's ability is regarded as worship. Rogers echoes these ideas and states, ". ..paintings
to me are a form of prayer, as 1believe that work is worship. When 1 work 1 believe that
1 am worshipping. The paintings are a form of prayer or s~pplication."~~

Therefore
Rogers not only attempts to apply broader spirituai ideas to the formai composition of his
pahtings, but in tryîng to Iive as a Baha'i, believes that his endeavours wiü ultimately
lead to art that has a spintual purpose akin to prayer.

Rogers explains that for him the spirit and the intellect are intertwhed. Similady
he likens the creation of art to the acquisition of knowledge. He bases this argument on
the Baha'i writings that explain that there are four ways to acquire knowledge: through
the world of the senses, through the faculty of the rational mind, through tradition that
has been passed d o m , and l a d y through the spirit.37This explains why, for Rogers, art,
spirituality and intelligence are dl interrelated.

In a talk given in 1996, Rogers explained that the knowledge an artkt wants to
convey in a painting is intellectual in nature, meaning that it does not have an outward
form. However, even though it is intellectual in nature, it is conveyed in a sensate way,
for example, through coiour, texture and form. The other way that this spiritual or
intellectual knowledge is conveyed, according to the artist, is through the use of
metaphors. Rogers warns that metaphors, as some might think,are not entirely based on
the senses." Rogers supports his argument for art as an intellectual activity by drawing
on the work of Hegel as well as the Baha'i writings. The German philosopher wrote,
"Insofar as works of art are produced by mind, they are essentially spiritual," while a
Baha'i document states, "The endowments which distinguish the human race fiom al1
other forms of life are summed up in what is known as the human spirit; the müid is its

essential quality."" The sources he draws on equate the spirit and the minci, and Rogers
also sees no contradiction between spirit and intellect, art and knowledge.

Rogers believes, and openly acknowledges, that the writings and teachings o f the
Baha'i Faith have influenced to a signincant degree not only his life but also his ant. The
artist also thlliks that in turn, his art d o w s him to gain insights into some spintuall

art as an interconnected and interdependent cycle of activity. The repeated referernces to
landscape elements in his art are significant and need to be explored M e r . In view of
his emphasis on spiritual concepts, it is important to consider whether the arlist sees a

The imagery of "nature" or the "land" feahnes prominently in the works of Rogers
and it has two sources: fïrst, the Baha'i concept of nature and second, his experÎence
growing up in the Prairies. Although his art has become increasingly more abstracf since
the late 1960s, the artist himself professes that it still "hinges on landscape" and "is:
rooted in lands~ape."~*

Ao environmental writer, Paul Hanley, has identified three principles that are
paramount when considering the Bahii'i attitude of human beings to nature: unity,
detachment and hurnility. Unity indicates that alI created things, whether animate or
inanimate, are essentially interconnected- Human beings and the natural world are
therefore closely tied together and interdependent. Hanley acknowledges that it might be
difficult for some to acknowledge the sacredness of nature, and that it is perhaps more
easy to accept its interconnectedness. Secondly, and firmly related to the principle of
e t y , is the principle of detachment fiom the natural world. Detachment in this context

\[43\] Rogers, "A Short Essay in Nine Pa," ch. 7, [unpaginated].
irnplies that "the development of huma.consciousness remains limited if it is oriented
only to the matenal reality.. ..The physical world is problematic only if it is seen as an
end in itseK Thus detachment from the physical world is a means of galliing conscious
access to the spiritual reaiities that lie behind and beyond the physical. Paradoxically,
this detachment allows us to see that the physical world perfectly and fülly reflects the
spiritual world.'"     FinaUy, there is the attitude of humility, which Baha'u'llah states is
best exemplified by the earth. He reminds the reader that the source of our prosperity and
wealth is the very earth that we tread upon and he believes that anyone who is aware of
this condition will be characterized by an attitude of humility."

Based on the above concepts, the BaWi teachings propose that as hurnanity
evolves and matures, it should neither be totally dependent on nature, nor should it be
completely removed and seek to dominate it. The middle ground shodd be sought.

In addition to the Baha'i sacred writings, the other important influence on Rogers's
outlook toward the land is his close relationship to the topography of the prairies. It was
in his formative years on his parents' wheat fami near Kerrobert, Saskatchewan that the
artist began to feel a great afEnity for nature and the prairie landscape. Rogers describes
how he took obligatory walks every day-to          and from a single-room school during the
day and to gather the anirnals in the evening. He states that those "daily trips were as
much a joumey into the rnind as they were over the prairie earth."'

It was upon his retuni to Saskatchewan fiom his studies in the United States that
the landscape motif becarne increasingly important in his work. As Rogers succinctly
States, "landscape found me."" In the 1960s and 1WOs, for example, the artïst used a tree
motif repeatedly and heavenly bodies such as clouds, stars, sun and moon were also
common. We see this for example, in Cloud Rotation Fig. 181 of 1970, where clouds
and stars hover over the land, conveying a great sense of ~ p a c e .But

more naturalistic rendering of nature. Yet even here, Rogers maintains the importance of
the landscape reference:

> From the earliest years until now, my paintins have been engaged with this most perfect of
> mebphorç-the landscape- My use of the landscape was aiways indirect, first estabkhing the
> most obvious features, comrnonly understood, and then quickiy moving to a philosophic
> engagement with light and with the h o w n line, the symbolic demarcation which separates what
> can be seen fiom what can onIy be î~nagined.~'

This statement underscores that Rogers's view of nature is symbolic, which allows him to
work in a highly abstract manner. It aIso echoes the idea introduced earlier, namely that
Rogers tries to convey spiritual or intellechial knowledge through his art. This can also
be linked to the Baha'i view which proposes detachment fiorn the transitory aspects of
the physicai world,

Rogers's choice of landscape elements in his art stems fiom his close association
with the prairie landscape in his childhood as well as the Bah9'i writings which consider
the naturai world as a reflection of divine attributes and as the perfect metaphor for
spiritual concepts, It is therefore easy to understand why the landscape motif is such an
integral part of his artistic vocabulary. The following discussion will explore in more

Rogers's paintings are replete with spiritual symbolism ùispired by the teachings of
the Baha'i Faith. The artist has repeatedly stated the importance of his religion to his life
and work, while also acknowledging that his upbringing on a f                    m in the prairies had a
significant impact on his artistic output. One realkes that he is not so much trying to
portray the teachings of the Baha'i Faith or to illustrate its history, but is making an effort
to apply some of its broad principles to his art. The works that will be discussed either
make reference to the land or depict a horizon line, the demarcation point between earth
and heaven. The majority of these works are abstract-a                 visual language chosen by
Rogers because of its philosophicai and symbolic possibilities rather than for purely
format cmsiderations. Like many twentieth-century artists such as Kandinsky and Harris
before him,he found abstraction an appropriate means by which to convey spintual
concepts. Critic and curator Nancy Tousley explaias how "Rogers's goals have always
been different fiorn other abstractionists working in the prairies.. .. Aithough Rogers has
cleaved to the modernist tenets of keeping the painting flat and its surface in tension, his
equd loyalty to content determinecl that he was never a member of the formalist

In the 1960s Rogers's landscapes were more representational with recognizable
depictions of trees, hills, suns and stars. He became particulariy well known for his
cclollipop-"or ccmushroom-"shaped trees. This tree motif appeared repeatedly in his
works of those years and appears to represent for him a deeper spiritual significance.
One exarnple is his oil-painting Sunset StiZIness of 1966 [Fig. 191 where a single tree with

hovers just above the crown of the tree. Bands of green and blue surround the edges of

radiate independently without the need of an extemal ljght source. The painting also
seems to vibrate and emit warmth,

The tree motif was highly signïficant to Rogers. The shape of these trees is a

Attributing human feelings to non-human subjects, especially using landscape
elements such as trees, is, according to art historian Robert Rosenblum, very common
among certain artists. He explains that this tradition was not only practised among the
artists of the Romantic movement, but also among later artists such as Van Gogh and the
early Mondrian who inherited its traditions. Ln their works &ees ofien acted as

In his essay for the exhibition catalogue n e Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting

modes of thought. These "five underlying impulses within the spintual-abstract nexus"
have been translated by artists interested in the spiritual into non-figurative visual forms.

in works such as Sunset Stillness, are reminiscent of this concept of the spiral and the
lemniscate, especially as the latter has the sun hovering over the treea The choice of the
spiral is also significant in light of Rogers's agreement with philosopher Rudolf
Arnheirn's discussion of the perceptuai basis of the importance of a centre and a cucular
movernent dong a spiral in a composition. Arnheim shows that there is an
interrelationship between compositional organizing principles and movement fiom a
centre. He explains that the concept of the Cartesian grid-as              a rneans of creating a sense
of order-as     well as the inchsion of a centre create power and movement. Aniheim

After reading Arnheim, Rogers realized that many of his favourite paintings combined
the spiral arrangement with the g i d system?

Both deep space and light are associated with evoking a spiritual dimension. In
Sunset StiZZness Rogers seems to be particularly concemed with light in favour of deep
space for creating a spintual atmosphere. For example, he has in a characteristic rnanner
h e d the rectangular canvas with borders in dark green and a luminous blue-green
colour. At the bottom of the tree he has used a band of bright blue colour. Al1 these
formal devices create a fiame within a fiame and help to rea8firm the integrïty of the
picture plane or, more significantly, could suggest its opening up? But Rogers reanimis
that those bands on the edges of his canvas do not serve purely forma1 reasons. As he

The importance of light as an expressive element in the paintings of Rogers and
many other artists interested in the spiritual is noteworthy. Light is not just employed in
paintings for its formal effect but acts as a means of expressing the spiritual. Literary
cntic Northrop Frye identifies three phases in the myth of light: the first beginning with
"God," the second with "man" and the third with "nature." He reminds us that in the
Bible the myth of creation begins with "God said, Let there be light." He also sees light
as "the centrai symbol of al1 knowledge and understanding." Light is also used to rernind
us of the struggie with darkne~s.~'

It has been suggested that Paul Klee inspired Rogers
to use light in this particdar fashion? As Rogers is a great admirer of Klee's work, this
is quite possible.

Rogers's use of light is reminiscent of works by abstract-luminists, whose work

Rothko in particular, Rogers succeeds in this work in creating a sense of luminosity using
slriking contrasts of tone and hue. Through the manipulation of formal aspects of Sunset
Srillness work he creates a distinctly emotional or intellectud impression on the rnind
which has a spiritual effect on the viewer.

Light is fundamental to Rogers's art, as is the ever-recurrïng theme of unity.

Through the study of the Baha'i Faith, he has corne to believe that mity itself is light. He
explains,

> I came to the conclusion that obviously the most important elernent was Iight, and the most

When it comes to spirituaiïty in art Rogers equates the importance of the element of light
with the principle of unity- In Sumet StiZZness he focuses on the element of light and not
so rnuch on directly conveying the concept of unity. WhiIe some of his other works also
focus primarily on iight, increasingly he has shown more interest in conveying or

If light was the primary means of creating a sense of the spintuai in S u m
StiZIness, deep space is the most important element in 0th- works. Rogers's landscape
Cloud Rotation (1970) [Fig. 181 conveys a sense of a vast space. The painting has
horizontal bands of colour at the bottom of the canvas representing the land. The rest of
the canvas represents the s e . The sky is filled with numerous well-defined, rock-like
cloud formations and x-shaped stars. The top-most cloud is executed in blue, whereas the
rest are in green or black. One feels the expanse of the prairies created through the use of
a very low horizon Iine, where a vast sky dominates a narrow band of land. The number
and "weight" (achieved through the use of impasto) of the clouds increases toward the
top half of the painting, drawing the eye fkom the deep space of the lower halfof the
painting to the surface of the canvas, This push and puII between deep space and the
surface of the canvas creates a sense of movement or "rotation" in an otherwise cairn
painting.

"Rogers as quoted in LM."Otto Rogers-arW-sculpter," 1 1.

The use of vast space as a metaphor for spirituality is rembiscent of Friedrich's
ccdwarfingintinities of nature'" discussed in Chapter 1, or Harris's infinite spaces that
came to the fore in his Lake Superior canvases painted after 1922. For Harris, a vast
space was a metaphor for a developing conscio~sness.~~

The creation of a vast and
endless space in Rogers's paintings hearkens back to the Unmense prairie landscape but
also evokes the spiritual worlds that he as a Bahh'i believes to exist, even though they are
not visible to the eyes. He is not so much implying that his paintings are those spiritual
worlds, but is trying to make his audience aware of a greater reality beyond this physical
world.

Space and depth in a painting are created by providing the viewer with two
reference points: one near and one far. Friedrich's paintings achieve a sense of deep
space through the placement of a human figure or a tree in the fore- or middIe ground.
Harris's North Shore, Lake Superior ( 1 926)'' places the tree stump in the foreground of
the canvas and contrasts it with the vastness of the lake and sky. Rogers partiy achieves
depth and space in Cloud Rotation through the use of a low horizon line and partly by a
contrasting surface of impastoed colour used for clouds in the upper half of the canvas
against more diluted colour for those closer to the horizon line. The sheer scale of the

canvas (152.5 x 213-5cm) also contributes in a significant way to creating a sense of

the horizon line in his paintings the artist states, Tt's a point of reference-a             structural
tool that I hang the rest of the painting on."'        Even if the artist hopes to move toward
pure abstraction, the contuiued use of landscape elements in his works seems to
demonstrate that these are in fact important elements in his vocabulary and that they are
integral to conveying spiritual ideas in his art.

Writers and critics agree that the horizon h e in Rogers's work is much more than a
"structural tooi." For the critic Lora Burke, for example, Rogers's iconographie use of
the horizon line does not simply represent a division between earth and sky. Rather it is
"a transition point between the corporeal and the ethereal, between the limitations of the
physical body and the limitless fieedom of the mind."" For art critic and professor of

In a statement made in 1991 Rogers confimis the importance of the horizon Iine
beyond its compositional function:

It appears that the repeated use of the horizon line in Rogers's oeuvre is not only a formal
device but creates spiritually significant iconography on several levels. In paintings
where he employs a low horizon line, the artist is able to create a space that is spiritually
charged, evoking other realms. The inclusion of a horizon line-a             common feature of his
work in the 1980s--often facilitates the creation of space, but more importantly, it acts on
a metaphoncal level as the dividîng line between heaven and earth, the spiritual and the
material reahs.

Movernent of light rhrough M e s s (198 1)          mg. 211 was executed a decade after
Cloud Rotation, and shows Rogers's interest in moving closer to non-objective art. A
rectangle and severai dark blobs of paint, squeezed directly out of the tube, replace
landscape elements. Yet the horizon h e , which divides the canvas horizontally into
equal halves, creates an automatic reference to the landscape.

This painting is very dark and it is only afler careful observation that a narrow area
of Iight becomes discemible. As the title suggests, it indeed represents a movement, or a
struggle, of a small area of light through darkness. The source of light is a thinly spray-
painted area on raw canvas at the bottom and in the lower left corner of the canvas,
creating an L-shape. The dark brown tones in the upper half of the canvas make the
surface seem impenetrable, which is M e r suggested by its visible horizontally-ninning
brushstrokes. Yet despite d l of these factors, one gets the impression that should the
light reach this dark area, the darkness will give way to the strugglhg light as suggested
by the matte light reflected off the acrylic surface. In addition to black, the lower half is
executed in tones of somewhat higher value such as dark red and dark brown. This
seems to suggest that the area closest to the light is better able to reflect light and
therefore also has relatively more colours.

have to struggle to iocrease the light..         .. For evil to exist at all is proof there is light.   It's
a c~nnmiation-"~~

His comment is based on the Baha'i philosophy which explains that as
darkness is the absence of light, so evil is the absence of good." This is in contrast to the
Christian tradition where evil is thought to have a real presence.

The painting may be an attempt to represent the concept that since darkness is the
absence of light, therefore light is more powerfüi. This is supported by the fact that only
a small area of light is able to penetrate and potentially illuminate a vast area of darkness.
The dark parts closest to the light are already ai3ected by the light and are taking on the
characteristics of light. Thus the o v e r d effect of the painting illustrates Rogers's belief
that we must struggle to increase light.

Since 1972 the artist has repeatedly used the dot motif in his paintings, as in
Movement of Light through Darkness. These ofien dark dots have functïoned both as a
formal device by reaffimiing the picture plane but also as "a focal point, as though for

our eyes jump to the other dots whkh are seerningly randornly scatiered on both halves of
the canvas. In the end our eyes seem to always corne back to the centre dot, creating a
continuous up- and downward or spiral movement. As already noted in the discussion on
Sumet Stillness, Tuchman has identifieci the spiral as one of the five elements found in
the work of abstract artists interested in the spiritual. For example, the Swedish painter
H i h a af K h t (1 862-1944) who was interested in spiritualism and later becarne a
follower of Rudolf Steiner, uses the spiral motif repeatedly in her work. Her "painting

Rogers's use of
the spiral motif is more complex in that he attempts to direct the reaction of the viewer to
create the spiral motion. This involvement of the viewer seems to be in accord with the
artist's desire to engage the mind of the viewer.

Ascending Landscape

The collage Ascending Landscape (1980) Fig. 231 is made of severai different
coloured, layered pieces of paper as well as acrylic paint and charcoal. Rogers's
characteristic horizon line is prorninently placed in the lower half of the collage, creating
al1 at once the sensation of a landscape. At the top of the white paper is a bleeding black
charcoal Iine that swings upward. Just below if Rogers has placed a square piece of
beige paper with two small holes on the upper right and lower left of the paper and
through which a charcoal dot is visible. Below the square is a rectangular piece of dark
beige paper that has been mostly covered in jade green paint, with a small dot or sun
placed in the top centre. An obliquely placed, Iight cream-coloured rectangle runs
through the green, the dark beige and down to the supporthg white paper. Its shape is
mirrored in the upper half by the charcoal line. Through the mirroring of these two
elements the artist has introduced an unexpected twist to the composition. The collaged
paper rectangle creates a sense of upward movement that leads the eye to the dots and the
charcoal line above, and back down again. Suddenly this work which is composed of

materials of low colour value, becomes enlivened through the creation of a continuous
movement-a      characteristic important to the artist.

Like many other artists interested in the spirihial, Rogers has adopted the language
of abstraction as bis career has evolved. Ascending Landscqe is a good example of an
utterly abstracted landscape, especially as cornpared to his tree series or Cloud Rotorion.
His use of abstracted forms and his involvement with the Emma Lake workshops might
mislead some to believe that his concems are purely formal. In fact the choices he makes
in his art are primarily dictated by spiritual concerns.

Rogers justifies his use of abstraction by pointing out that an earlier religion has
encouraged it. He explained in a conversation how the prohibition of the depiction of
human forms in the Islamic tradition has resulted in a rich history of using geometric
m o t i f e a highly abstracted art form. In his view Islamic art does not necessarily depict
the Qur'h but tries to convey its spirit. He argues M e r that al1 art is abstract as it is
derived through arranging form, colour, and texture. Art is also abstract because it is not
reality. Even a photograph mediates visual expenence as it captures only a fraction of a
second. For Rogers, the language of abstraction is most suitable to express the idea that
the physical world is a reflection of the spirihiai one. He looked at Modemists such as
Matisse and realized that with his landscape paintings or landscape elements he could be
creating bridges to the unknown. For Rogers, expression is rooted in expenence and

therefore it is reasonable to start with an experience everyone is familiar with such as
hills, water and the like. As an artist he tries to create a dialogue between these two
worlds, which he believes occurs partly on a conscious level and partiy on an
unconscious one? Rogers explains his use of the landscape motif in his work in relation
to abstraction,

> Over tirne the degree o f abstraction has increased, and yet the images have become more familiar;
> even the obvious elernents such as trees and hills have given way to geometric shapes which act in
> the drama o f light and dark while providing a pictord device to anchor the flow of undefined
> energy.%

Whereas some maintain that Rogers is a landscape painter, others, like the art critic
Peter MiIIard, see him e

st and foremost as an abstract painter. AIthough Millard states
that Rogers has successfully met the real challenge of the prairies, narnely to depict its
space and light, yet he believes that "it has happened almost inadvertently while he was
pursuing artistic concerns that might seem to have little to do with prairie landscape."

~ ~ is an
Sometimes the landscape element is intentional but at others it just e r n e r g e ~ .This
accurate observation with regard to Rogers, as it is clear by now that his primary interest
is the philosophical or religious intention behind the work.

Ross Woodman offers an explanation for Rogers's choice of abstraction as his
forma1 language. According to Woodman, an abstract mode of painting empIoying

94 Rogers, "A Short Essay in Nine Parts," ch. 7 [unpaginated].
95 Millard, "Otto Rogers, " [unpaginated].

Rogers's distinctive visual vocabulary enables the creation of a universal language that
transcends any national and racial barriers. He a n i r m s that Rogers's use of abstraction
coupled with his interest in the spiritual takes back abstraction to its original intent. As
Woodman M e r explains:

> While influenced by Clernent Greenberg and the Emma Lake School-At is clear that the purely

Rogers's choice of abstraction, like that of Tobey, Harris and Kandinslq before
him, seems to largely stem fkom its suitability to express spintua1 ideas. Abstraction is
the language or tool he has chosen as the vehicle for conveying metaphors. Again, the
content for Rogers revolves around ideas of an unknowable divinity, the vastness of the
unknown, and a life beyond the physical.

> prevalent in his oeuvre. However, according to long-tirne fiiend, colleague and art dealer
> Robert Christie, it was still the same prairie landscape just turned by 90 degrees." His
> idea can be supported by the fact that Rogers has sometimes flipped these vertical
compositions by 90 degrees, establishg thereby the characteristic horizon line, and has
continued work on them in that way." For some people who are familiar with Rogers's
earlier work, even the vedcaily-divided canvases seem to be rooted in the land even if
they emerged on a subconscious and unintentionai level.

Writer Sheila Robertson believes that Rogers's challenge in these vertical
compositions "is to reconcile the separate hdves, without creating rnirror images."'*      For
example, the lefi side of the canvas is covered in dark browns and reds. The paht is
applied in such a manner that one senses movement. In contrast to that, the right half of
the unprimed canvas is left airnost intact, Save for a fine bleeding of colour from the other
half, a thin layer of spray paint and some lines and dots. The right half has a sense of
calm and stillness due to the even texture of the canvas which is only dismpted in a few
instances by lines and dots. Yet the painting has also a quality of tension to it, created
through the presence of the Iight and dark halves and the polarities of movement and
stillness. According to art critic EIizabeth Wylie, both the vertical and horizontal

divisions in his paintings, although a formal device, " c m be interpreted as spirituai
> iconography."lo1 For example it could represent the concept of unity through diversity-
where the two halves despite their differences provide a W e d cornp~sition.~~

For the
artist this "parallels the struggle.. .between the inner and outer nature."lo3

As mentioned earlier, Rogers does not try to illustrate passages directly nom the
Bahk'i scnptures in his art. However, he ofien titles a work after it is completed and after
he has tried to understand the dynamics behind the painting. He then tries to find a
relevant concept or passage fiom the Bahh'i writings based on which he selects a title.
Although the titles of his paintings are not always a key to understanding them, yet in this
instance it is helpfül to know more about the passage that gave this work its titie. The
words 'Yhe Sea of Grandeur" are found in a book by Baha'u'llah, entitled The Four

VaZleys,which in mystical Ianguage explains the path or valleys that a seeker of God
must pass through in order to attain to the goal of his or her quest. In the first of the four
valleys, Baha'uYll&htells the story of a mystic and a grammarian who in their travels, in
search of the knowledge of God, corne upon the "Sea of Grandeur." The mystic,
immediateiy throws himself into the sea, having recognized it as the object of his quest.
The learned grammarian, however, hesitates because he is too preoccupied with trying to
understand whetther he has reached his goal through the use of logic and reasoning. The

'O3   Rogers as quoted in Robertson, "Otto Rogers invites scrutiny of paintbgs," mage unknown]-

mystic urges him to forget his worldly knowledge and to f h g himself wholeheartedly
into the sea.

The bi-partite canvas acts as a metaphor on several levels in order to convey the
essence of the above story. The dark area could reflect doubt or ignorance, whereas the
light half of the canvas codd act as a syrnbol for knowledge and certitude. The divided
canvas could also be interpreted as the grammarian's dilemma: metaphorically speaking
he might be hovering between the vertical line that divides darkness fiom light. And
finally, the divided canvas could act as a syrnbol that represents human ignorance of the
spirituai worlds, despite one's closeness to them. The dots on both halves of the canvas
might suggest the interconnectedness of these two realities. The same function of
establishing a connection is fulfilled by the dark Line that runs intemiittently between the
two parts, from the top right half to the middle of the left one?

This interpretation seems to agree with the concept of "reunion and separation" as
discussed by BaWi author Bahiyyih NakhJavani.                  She proposes that this concept is
necessary for any artwork that wants to reflect the spirit of the Baha'i teachings. She

According to the philosopher Jean-François Lyotard, who shares a similar view,
"'contradictory feelings" facilitate the expression of the spirihial. He explains that the
"contradictory feeling [of] pleasure and pain, joy and anxiety, exaltation and
depression.. ." is what constitutes the                      whose "fundamental task ...[is that] of
bearing pictonai or otherwise expressive witness to the ine~pressible."'~~

Approaching the Shore of the Sea of Grandeur is one of many which evoke
"duality," another one of the five impulses of the spiritual-abstract nexus identified by
Tuchman. By duality, Tuchman means that "the universe is conceived as being
comprised ofpaired opposites (male-female, light-dark, vertical-horizontal), and [that] al1
things evolve in dialectical oppo~ition."'~~

Rogers's paintings that have been divided
either honzontally or vertically, are examples of this category. Approaching the Shore of
the Sen of Grandeur is a particularly good example as it demonstrates both verticality but
also light and darkness, as hdf of the canvas is left almost in its original state.

concept when he pmises someone's poetry and States, "Its [the poetry's] perusal hath truly proved
impressive, for it was indicative of h t t i the light of reunion and the fire of separation." 'Zawh-i-Maqsud"

Despite the polarities of light and dark, movement and stillness, the painting feels
balanced and the two halves seem harmonious. This might reflect the Baha'i concept of
moderation, where everything that is taken to excess is seen as hannful. NakhJavani
believes that "'balance" and "'moderationY'do not equate to blandness or sameness. In fact
opposing elements are required to anive at a complete whole. She explains,

> ...for a work of art to attain 'hioderationy' in B a h U terms does not require that it should be

The finai impulse identified in the spiritual-abstract nexus by Tuchman is
synaesthesia. Synaesthesia is the condition where an overlap occurs between the senses.
For example, colours rnay evoke musical tones or vice versa or tastes may suggest
colours. Synaesthesia was one of the hallmarks of the Symbolist artists, but it also
interested artists like Kandinsky and Brooker. For exarnple, Brooker's abstract painting
Sou&         Assembling (1928) Pig. 251 might be the visuai interpretation of the music of
Johann Sebastian Bach?              Rogers's In Celebrution of the Nightingale 's Song (1 98 1) pig.

c'nightingale's song" is not a piece of music. In fact Baha'u'llah in his own writings,
ofien refers to himself and to his message in the symbolic form of the nightingale and its
song. Rogers iç not so much translating a passage nom the Baha'i writings into visual
form, but rather is paying hornage to the revelation of Baha'u'llah in paint, as he would in
a prayer.

Rogers's paintings and his writings demonstrate the centrality of spirituality in his
work. The source of these concepts are the teachings of the Baha'i Faith. Although he
has been trying to move away fkom direct references to the landscape, yet it remains an
important element in his art. While his repeated use of landscape motifs can be attributed
to his upbringing on a f m in the Canadian Prairies, his metaphoncal use of natural
elements shows the profound influence of the writings of the Bahii'i Faith and its attitude
toward the natural world,

Donald Kuspit in his essay "Concerning the Spirihial in Contemporary Art," States
that "Today art does not seem so mighty an element in spirituai life, and spiritual life
does not seem so evident in art or in general.'"              In contrast, this thesis has proposed that
spirituality is indeed reIevant to some contemporary artists,and that art can be a vehicle
for spiritual insights. In fact Robert Houle and Otto Rogers make us aware that physical
existence in a materialistic society cannot be the purpose of life, but that there has to be a
more important and enduring spintual aspect to it.

Kuspit's comment is only partially true, since there are a number of artists who are
interested in exploring spirituality in their art. Thus far the rnajority of scholars and
critics have to a large extent neglected the spiritual in contemporary art. A few
exceptions were introduced in the review of literature that include the spiritual aspirations
of artists in the study of contemporary art in Canada. This thesis is a step in introducing
the work of two artists p h a r i l y fiom the standpoint of their spiritual ideology and how
this finds expression in their art. Both Houle and Rogers, have shown a repeated interest

' George Whalley, Poetic Process (Cleveland, 1967), p. xxx as quoted in NakhJavhi,         "Artist, Seeker and
Seer," 4-

Donald Kuspit, " Concerning the Spintual in Conternporary Art,"in Tuchman etal., m e Spiritual in Art:
Absrract Painting 1890-2985, (New York: Abbeville Press, 1985), 313,

in conveying a sense of spirituality through their abshact works. The thesis clearly
shows that in order to get a more complete understanding of their work a mode of inquiry
is necessary in which spintual considerations complement format anaiysis.

As was demonstrated, the landscape motif forms a central part of Houle's and
Rogers's "spiritual" vocabulary in their art. Each uses a physical landscape to symbolize
the immaterial and ethereal. Their choice of Iandscape as a metaphor for their respective
spirihial outlook places them within a definite tradition of Western artists, çtarting in the

who have employed the same means. In more recent times Canadian scholars
mid-1700~~
have shed light on some of the Group of Seven members and their contemporaries, who
were influenced not only by their Christian backgrounds but also by theK interest in
specific spiritual movernents that had become popular then, such as Transcendentalism
and Theosophy. However, in contemporary Canadian art there have only been a few
studies that have looked at spirituality and there is still much art that needs to be
discussed with a view to the spiritual aspirations of the artists.

To date the discussion of both Houle's and Rogers's work has only tangentially
discussed the spiritual aspect of their work. Although curators and critics have to some
extent discussed the sources that inform Houle's spirihial sensibilities, they have leaned
far more heavily toward an understanding of the political context of his work, even
though the artist has explicitly stated that some of his works are spirituai rather than

politicd in nature. In the light of the ùicreased activism with regard to land daims and
battles over the use of natural resources on the part of Native peoples in Canada, it is
understandable that there is a tendency to interpret Houle's works solely fkom a political
viewpoint. For instance, Houle has once again produced a work to raise the issue of the
Oka cnsis, the Mohawk stand-off of 1990 near Montreal. On the occasion of its tenth
anniversary, he has created Kanehsatake X.' It is obvious that Houle is making reference
here to a significant political issue- However, as aiready stated in chapter II, issues of the
land are closely related to spirinial wellness for many Native peoples. Hence, when
discussing Houle's work the spintual significance of the land cannot be ignored. A clear
link should be made between the land and his search for a renewed sense of his own
identity. Artist-in-residence programs both in Manitoba and in Ontario, where he dealt
directly with the land, fortified his sense of identity and led Houle to use the subject of
the land more frequently in his art-

Another issue that needs to be considered when discussing the spintuai aspect of
Houle's work is his upbringing in both Native and Christian beliefs and his endeavours as
an adult to re-learn Native traditions. Many of his works demonstrate the influence of
these two spiritual traditions on his life and art. He has demonstrated a conhued
determination to re-leam his native spiritual traditions and the Ojibway language. These

\[3\] The original Kanehsatake was made between 1990-93, collection Art Gallery of Hamilton-
have manifested themselves in diEerent ways in his work such as, for example, his use of
porcupine quills and references to the four directions held sacred in Ojibway spiritual
traditions.

Similarly, discussions of Rogers's work have primariiy focussed on formal
concerns rather than spintuai ones- His use of the landscape motif is usually related to
his upbringing on the Canadian Prairies, while its spirituai motivation is neglected. Yet,
Rogers has unequivocally stated that his art is indebted to a large extent to the teachings
of the Baha'i Faith. As stated in chapter III, Rogers is not interested in illustrating these
teachings but rather tries to incorporate them in his attitude toward his a r t - m a h g and
through the use of metaphon in his art. His engagement with the landscape is on a
phiIosophical level and he believes it to be a perfect metaphor to express his spiritual
aspirations. Baha'i writings that use examples Eom the natural world to explain spintual
concepts and propose that it is necessary to explain spiritual or inteIlectua1knowledge
thrûugh references to the physical world have been influentid for him. For Rogers
spinhial content is conveyed through the employment of the principle of ''unity through
diversity," as weil as the creation of vast space and a sense of luminousness. Rogers
M    y believes that spïrituality and religion have a place in the contemporary visual arts.
He states,

> The influence of religion on conternporary art is, however, discounted by rnany, and those artists
> who speak of such a connection may be greeted with marked suspicion. This is curious
> considering that the very study of the history of art itself is organized in relationship to the
> religions which evolved fiom the teachings of their prophet founders.-..One can understand the
reason for religion being discredited as the source of art today when the very definition of words

associated with religion fias been eclipsed by obscure man-made theology, ritual, dogma and
di~ision.~

To give form to the Iink between spirituaiity and landscape, Houle and Rogers both
turned to abstraction as their language of expression. This choice is not random. As was
discussed in the second chapter, Houle's choice of abstraction has several reasons. First,
he pays tribute to the Abstmct Expressionists who were in search for a new spiritual
vocabulary and who paid tribute to the spirituality found in Native art. Second, it was the
language he learnt during his academic training. Finally, like his spiritual ancestors he
seeks out the essence of the object and therefore prefers non-objective art. Since
Rogers's use of the landscape is syrnboIic, it is appropnate for him to work in an abstract
manner as well. His choice d s o reflects his desire to move m e r and M e r away fkom
the landscape motif in his art, symbolizuig the Bahii'i attitude of detachment fiom the
physical world.

This thesis has shown that a discussion of Rogers7s and Houle's art is not
sufficiently served by a purely formai analysis but needs to be augmented by an
exploration of their respective spiritual aspirations. While Kandinsky says that abstract
art came about to express spirituality, Kuspit claims that art is no longer spiritual in

nature, as Kmdinsb intended, but has in fact becorne materiali~tic.~

In this thesis it has
been s h o w that there are some artists whose works provide an exception.

Further studies are necessary to establish the validity of this argument, using the
works of other contemporary Canadian artists. We should explore whether spirituality
has aiways been an integral part of art. We should consider whether spirituality is present
in some art but is not made explicit. Perhaps artists have incorporated spiritual themes in
their art even without being aware of it. Have some artists perhaps unconsciously
incorporated spirituality into their works? Has spirïtuality always been there or was tfiere
a penod when it was downplayed or ignored? And if so, was it ignored by the artists or
the cntics? There is a significant nurnber of Canadian artists interested in spirituality,6
yet the past few decades have paid little attention to this aspect of art. These are just
some of the open questions which still need to be explored.

There are some new lines of inqujr that were beyond the scope of this thesis and
yet need to be explored. For example, an investigation of the use of the sublime by artists
interested in the spintual is necessary. Recent art-historical scholarship has established
once again a link between the sublime and the spiritual, extendmg earlier çtudies on the
effects of the sublime by Longinus, Edmund Burke, Immanuei Kant, Newman, and
'Kuspiî, "Concerning the Spintual in Contemporary Art," 3 13.

\[6\] See Korp's Ph-D. dissertation "Earthworks," where 120 artists took part in a study that was concerned
with questions regarding spirituality and the land,

Lyotard. More recently several British art critics and wrïters have argued that the
sublime, as manifested for example in the works of Caspar David Friedrich, allows
contemporary artists to tackle once again the subject of transcendental reality7 There is a
need to inquire into how this applies to the work of Canadian artists today.

It i s hoped that this thesis has made a contribution, however smail, to elucidating
the link between Iandscape and spirituality in the abstracted works of two contemporary
Canadian artists. It is recognized that this is one of the fkst steps in this direction and it is
the author's hope that others continue this line of investigation and that the scholarship in
this area is expanded.
