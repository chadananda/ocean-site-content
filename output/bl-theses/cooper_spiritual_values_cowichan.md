## The Faith Community as Extended Family: The Influence of Shared Spiritual Values as Experienced by Bahá'í Families in the Cowichan Valley

### by [Kenneth Paul Cooper](https://bahai-library.com/author/Kenneth+Paul+Cooper)

1997


> **Abstract:** This is an exploratory study on the community context of family life, using in depth group interviews to examine the perceptions of Bahá'í adults, children and youth about how the Bahá'í community influences their family life. The study provides a glimpse into the nature of the Bahá'í family; addresses the influence which dominant beliefs or life perspectives have on standards of behavior; and articulates a community paradigm which provides a value-based social network that is organized to provide diverse and challenging experiences and which holds the potential to do so in a more deliberate manner. The findings suggest that the influence between the family and religious community can be reciprocal and mutually beneficial, giving access to additional human resources grounded in common values and principles, and thereby extending, supporting and strengthening the family.

ABSTRACT
This is an exploratory study on the c ommunity context of family life, usi ng tn depth
group interviews to examine the perceptions of Baha'i adults, children and youth about
how the Baha'i community influences their family life. The study provides a glimpse into
the nature of the Baha'i family; addresses the influence which dominant beliefs or life
perspectives have on standards of behavior; and aniculates a community paradigm which
provides a value-based social network that is organized to provide diverse and
chal l engin g e �peri ences and which holds the potentia l to do so in a more deliberate
mann e r. The findings suggest that the influence between the family and religious
community can be reciprocal and mutually beneficial, giving access to additional human
resources. grounded in common values and principles, and thereby e xtendin g supponing

,

and strengthening the family.

ACKNO\VLEDGMENTS
r   owe a s pecial   debt of gratitu de to those \vho participated     in the group   intervie\vs
and w hose experiences in Baha'i family and communi ty life were the             subJeCt    of this
research.   Their names do      not appear anywhere in the research to maintain their
confidentiality. I thank the members of the Cowichan Baha'i Family Schools Committee
for their assistance wi th the recruitment of participants and the provision of a location for
the group interview sessions.
ram indebted to Dr. Michael P ri nce Associate Dean of the Faculty of Human and

.

Social Development at the University of Victoria, for the supportive and patient manner
in w hich he undertook to s u pe rvise my research. I felt at all times that Dr. Prince was
ge n uin ely interested in the subj ec t progress and tindings of this study. I beli e v e that \Ve

.

have become colleagues and friends.

In   addition. valuable and important feedback on the desi gn and reporting of this
study was   given by   the members of my       research   committee: Dr. Harold Coward.. Director
of the Centre for Studies in Religion and Soci ety and Dr. Martha Haylor, faculty member

,

in the School of Nursing, both at th e       University of Vi cto ri a   .

\Vhen I was first conceiving this study. I so ught and received advice from the
Universal House of Justice, supreme governing body of the Baha'i World Community,
seated on Mt. Carmel in Hai fa Israel. I am grateful not only for the content of that

,

advice, but for the considerable spiritual reassurance and encouragement that it gave to
my t:ndeavors.

Many individuals have offered support, advice or interest over the period of the
conduct of this study. Each and every interaction that I had about the study nurtured my
motivation to complete the work. However? there are some signal names in this category.

VII

They include my dear friend Mr. Otto Donald Rogers. mem ber of the Continental Board
of Counse l lors for the Baha'i Fai th in the Americas. assigned to the International
T each 1 n g Centre at the Baha'i World Centre in Haifa. IsraeL whom I consider to be my
spiritual father: and Dr. Hossai n Danesh. Director of the Landegg Academy in
S wi tzerl and.

I also wis h to express my appreciation to members of the faculty of Human and
Soc ial Development at the University of Victoria for their i nstructive and thought
provoking ideas, s hared ei ther in the c l assroom environment or in diverse conversations.

Without the willingness of my \vife Nicola. and our t\vo children \vho were stil l at
home during this project, Sarah and Jesse. to incorporate its demands and impact into o ur
family life. it could not have borne fruit. Without their patie nce in the face of my
excitement. frustration. and expectation that everybody would or should be interested i n
this study. I would not have felt o r been hrrounded. As much a s this study suggests that
the community is a context of support for the family: my fam i ly is a context of support
for me. [ conti nue to benetit from t heir advice. encouragement. wi sdo m and l ov e   .

CHAPTER I

l:STRODl'CTION

The Statement of the Problem

The interaction bet\veen the family and communi ty and our u nderstanding of the
nature and purposes of that relationship is the s u bj ect of my research interest. Since I 968
I have been interested as an education and child care practitioner in the family as the
pri m ary custodial and develop m ental environment. During that tim e period I have
participated in the atTairs of the Baha'i Faith community. Baha'i co m m unities in Canada
and abroad have striven. in the light of the Baha'i Teachings and of their experience. to
understand the nature and characteristics of Baha'i family lite and the manner in which
the comm unity can facilitate those characteristics. This understanding has been I imited
by the lack of research arti cu lating the aspects of Baha'i community structure and
c omm unity life which represent actual or potential intluences on family lift!.

The Importance of the Study

Dokecki and Moroney ( 1 9 83), and Caplan       ( 1976)) sugg est   that social po li cy values
be re-evaluated, giving consideration to the implications of valuing the i nd ividual and
family within community. Most formal community institutions. such as schools and
h o spital s, deal directly with individuals and not for the most part with families, but
religious i ns t it u tions are involved with �ntire families over each stage of the life cycle.
Historic all y , religious institutions have fulfilled an organizing capacity \vithin
communities. ln revie\'ving research on com m uni ty influences on fa m i ly fun ctio nin g and.,
despite recent interest in an ecological perspective which sees families within a wider

network of social systems. r found little attention to the pan played by rdigious
institutions ( Bronfenbrenner, Moen. and Garbarino.      1984. Bahr and Chad\v1ck. l Q85)

How can religious communities fulfill a support role for families·� And. how can
they remain open to impact and change by the diversity of family needs and individual
intluence?

In considering the research problem [ have targeted a community of Faith to which
my   own   family belongs. The Baha'i Faith community meets the overall purpose and
intent of the study because of its local organizational structure which establishes an
elected body, the local Spiritual Assembly, for the go\·ernance of community affairs. Vv'e
can tind guidance for the relationship bet\veen the individual and that body, "You should
go to them   as   a child would go to its parents" (The Local Spiritual Assembly, p.l:!). This
echoes the conclusion offered by Garbarino and Crouter (      1978) that \ve consider the
community context of parent-child relations to enhance our understanding of the ecology
of human development. Similarly, we find that body charged \Vith�       "   ... the arrangement of
the regular meetings of the friends. the feasts and anniversaries, as \veil as the special
gatherings designed to serve and promote the intellectual and spiritual interest of their
fdlow   men... " ( p.l2). This study explores the interactive and mutually reinforcing
relationship which exists bet\veen Baha'i families and Baha'i community.

For Baha'i families, found in diverse geographical. cultural, religious, and
ideological settings around the world, the teachings of their Faith hold potential both as a
form of support and as a child-rearing system in itself. This raises the hypothesis that a
community of affinity, or shared values and principles, might provide a transferable
social support network. That is� Baha'i families would find    a social net\vork, founded on
the same teachings wherever they might move. If so. this may       serve as a preventive to
the isolation seen by Garbarino and Crouter (    1978) as one factor in child maltreatment.

Should such a community. which is both abstract (subjective) and concrete
(objective)� be sho,-.n to provide social support for tamilies� then an interesting principle
would be identitied for policy makers. Resource allocation decisions could.
hypothetically. include the marshaling of existing formal net\vorks of affinity (shared
perception. value and'or beliet) to serve as agents of service delivery and centers of
community assessment

This study infonns research on the interaction between the family and community
and our understanding of the nature and purpose of that relationship.

The Purpose of tbe Study

The purpose of the study was to explore the perceptions of Baha'i adults, children
and youth about ho\v the Baha'i community influences their family life. In doing so. it
focused on four sub-problems:

> How do Baha'i tamilies describe Baha'i tamily life?
> This provides a clearer understanding of the characteristics of Baha'i family life
> for the Baha'i community itself. for professionals. and for the public at large .
..,   How do Baha'i families experience and understand the intluence of the Baha'i

> community on family life?

This identifies aspects of the Baha'i community perceived to intluence family life.
3. What Baha'i community resources do Baha'i tamilies identify as strengthening

> family life?

This tentatively identifies variables that serve to strengthen Baha'i family life.
-l. What changes in Baha'i community life would serve to strengthen family life?

> This identifies recommendations for enhancement and/or change in policy and
> practice for the Baha'i community. for professionals, and for the public at large.

V.-\Ll7ES, BELIEFS :\ND EXPERIESCES

In this c hapt er I,   \\i ll   discuss the values. belief� and e xperi ence s \vhich have
served to inform my work as              an   ed ucator and child care practitioner and which led to my
research int erest   .   My practice has been organized around an i nt erest in the education of
children� the need for that education to be developmentally based� the importance of
v aluing parents as co-educators: and the role which values play in the carrying out of o ur
lives. Given this b ac kgro und I develope d a philosophy of education based on the

following pri nc i ples :

In order to develop a health y well-adjusted and int egrated personal ity, the

> holistic development of the i ndivi d ual is necessary. Metaphorically. the
> seedling must be nurtured, the roo ts fed.           ln these terms, we understand Froebel s       '

> ( 1974) con cept of the unfolding essence that comes from             wi th in   and   dev elop s to
> manifest function, purpose, beauty and unity without
.,   Children should be introduced at an earl y age to the underlying unity of all life:

> withi n the interrela ted circles of their families, their communities, and their child
> care and education programs
3    Parents, caregivers and teachers must be concerned with the material, human and

> spirit ual education of the child. Through int eract i on with the s urround i ng
> material, human and spiritual environmen ts the child will take part in the
revela tion of his or her ovvn self.

On this philosophical basis I developed a co nceptual frame\vork for school and
child care programs (Cooper�          1981 ):

1. Provision of learning environments and expenences \vhich meet the

developmental needs of children.
..,

> Provision of opponunities to meet the needs of parents to be involved in the
> continued education of their children.
3. Development and coordination of access to and interaction \Vtth commumty

> suppon and resource services� available to children, families� schools and child
> care programs.
4. Provision of statT de velopment programs to improve the expenise of professionals

an d suppon personn e L

Parent Involvement and Education

From 1981 to   i 989 I appli ed this framework   as   an Early Childhood Education
instructor at a Community C ollege in Ontario� but I noted that students and graduates
were apprehensive about the second goal. They di d not actively promote panicipation
by, or consultation with,. parents. As          I had observed through my years    in the public
education system and indeed as a parent myself, practitioners viewed themselves as
expen and were reticent to make any more than cursory,. token efforts to acknowledge,
let alone collaborate with .. parents. The family and child care environments \vere t reated
as   di sc rete contexts for the child.

By   1989 the majority of my   work was in parent education    .   I wonde red \vhy there
was such an interest in topics such        as   Preventing Parent Bum-out and Discipline, but not
in Ages and Stages. This led me to identi fy and ret1ect upon an inter esti n g pattern.

Through the collection of course participant pro fil es [ noted what parents said about
their needs and ex pecta t ions       .   [was c uri o us about whether my workshops were m eeting
those needs. E\"aluation forms were t e l ling me that pa rttc ipan ts were satisfied \'llith the
content, the format of the sessions, and my instruction sty le              .   But   was   there congruence
bet\veen \\·hat they pe rc ei v ed        as   their interests anct or prob l ems and the    ac t ua l   content of
the courses? [f I co ul d answer that question� l had the groundi ng for the improvement of
those co ur se s and t he de v elopme nt of others. The res po nses fell into n.vo cate gon es                .   No
matter who the p anic ipants were racially, chronologically, economically, educati onally,
culturally or geograph ica l ly the statements spoke of c once rn with contlict and self

esteem They wanted to alleviate conflict but \vere not confident that they had the

information. skills or capacity to do so. Family m embe rs would not agree to work on
issues of concern because of the contlict. A vicious cycle in m ore than tigurative term, r
saw   a   chal l en ge to re-frame their q uestio ns from "how to get rid of contlict" to "h0\\1. to
achieve harmony": to re-frame their percepti on and expectation of se lf and others from
pessimistic to o pt im i st i c : and to re-frame the context of family support from discrete
parent education to conjoint., panicipatory family programs. [ re fl ec ted on my prac tice
experience     a nd   \vtsdom to discov er the common threads: families include children
through birth. adoption or temporary care, so programs have to i nc l ude children� parents
are the primary educators. so programs have to validate that rol e � each family m em ber is
at a panicular devel opmen t al stage, so programs have to recognize those stages : and
va l ues form the foundation of our actions consc ious l y or not, so programs have to be

based upon, ackn o\vledge and address val ues               .

Community Support for Families

The design of such support programs could provide insight to our ab ility to meet
the needs of children. parents. communities. and practitioners. and would be consistent
\\ith the third goal of my conceptual frame\vork which addresses the development and
coordination of access to and interaction \\lith services for families in the community
context. Anglin and Glossop ( 1986) describe the family as an open system, evolving
through the actions and interactions of family members, practitioners. and policy makers.
They suggest that this "social   ecol ogi cal   approach" (p.4) challenges our way of
understanding, analyzing ., serving and helping families. They reiterate the gro\\i n g
acknowledgment of the divers ity of family forms., ob l i gi ng      us   to consider the various and
complex dimensions of family relatio nships and functions. They argue that we no longer
need to search for a parti cular definition of the family, but rather to further our
understanding of the institutional and societal influences on how members manage
responsibilities of family life. To do this     wo r k   I \vould need to participate in the research
process with families who want harmony and who have some affinity in the values \vhich
they hold as basic. I saw that my own community of a tlinity, the Baha'i Faith
community., could serve as a starting potnt for such a study.

[n The Promulgation of Universal Peace (Abdu'l-Baha., 1922), we find a succinct
and powerful statement of the Baha'i teachings on the fami ly.

According to the teachings of Baha'u'llah the family, being a human unit� must be
> educated according to the rules of sanctity. All the virtues must be taught the family.
> The integrity of the fam ily bond must be constantly considered and the rights of the
> individual members must not be transgressed. The rights of the son., the father, the
> mother. none of them must be arbitrary. Just as the son has certain obligations to the
> father, the father, likewise has certain obligations to his son. The mother., the sister
> and the other members of the household have their certain prerogatives. All these
> rights and prerogatives must be considered, yet the unity of the family must be
> sustained. The injury of one shall be the injury of all: the comfort of each the
comfort of all� the honor of one the honor of alL

[ saw three principles arise from this statement: social order (the fan1ily bond)�
collective benefit (the i nterdependence of experience)� and social j ustice (the non-
arbttrary nature of rights). In the Baha'i Teachings authority        is   vested in the institutions
of the Faith, while po\ver rests in the actions of the believers. This is exemplified by the
absence of a clergy: the collective administration of the atfairs of the community by an
dected body called the Spiritual Assembly: and the meeting of the community membe rs
for consultation on those atfairs at the nineteen day Feast. Authority, not being a rb itrary           .

would lie in the framework of the family itself and be dependent upon collective
decision-making, using the process of consultation.

The questions began to surface. Who would educate the family? What are the
"rules of sanctity" and \\·here can they be found? What are the rights, o bligations and
prerogatives of the individual family members? Ho\v can they be considered and the
unity of the family susta in ed? [began to apply the principle of consultation. as taught
and practiced in my experience in the Baha i commun i ty to a pattern for action by

'            ,

families. That process .. the calling together of the members to jointly discuss the issues at
hand, is equally appl icable to family functioning as to the global stage. F am ily members
wanted to change their conflict to harmony or peace. According to the Universal House
of Justice, governing body of the Baha i world communi ty the precursor to peace is

'                     ,

unity. t o \vhich the   precursor is justice ( 1985). How does this pattern fit the family?
corresponded with the Universal House of Justice. The perspective of the response
( 1992) affirms the family as the primary context for the personal and social development
of the individual, both child and adult, and the community as the social support context
fo r the education and development of the family.

> The House of Justice attaches great importance to all measures which \vill foster the
development of family life, and commends your interest in carryin g out studies in the
interactive and mutually re inforc i ng relationship which should exist between the

Baha'i community and the Baha i fam ily
'        .   Both are based on Baha i values, the

'

> purpose of which is to create a cohesive social unity in which each individ ual can
> tind the means for spiritual development and service to the Cause of God� and which
> ''-ill form a training ground and bui lding block tor the development of a unitied world
society.

This statement provides useful metaphors in the terms .. training ground" and
''building block". and confirms the interests \vhich arose from my practice              e x perience :

developmental process, children and parents.. and values. The concept of atTinity is
referred to as the shared values of the fam i ly and community.

ln reviewing thoughts to this point we return to the essential bifurcation: that we
are at one and the same time the drop and the ocean. In the reconciliation of this
bifurcation� we consider our purpose. That consideration is mediated by voliti on and
leads to action. The Baha'i Teachings value the mind          as   the essential quality of the
human spirit. Choice. then., is a spiritual attribute w·hich we exerci se according to our
subjective understanding and in the light of our objective conte xt           .   The ethical agent in
the Baha'i paradigm is the individual. The choices which individuals make draw upon
the k nowledge embedded in the Baha'i Teachings� experience: and social interaction and
discourse.       Using the metaphor offered earlier. the fam i ly can be presented         as   both the
training ground for this process of human development and             as a   social unit in itself

Given this metaphor and the valuing of the mind          as   the essential� spiritual reality
of the human being., more ques tions come to mind. Can ideas be found for a framework
tor human spiritual development and social action/service? Can this framework be

applied to the systematic st ructuri ng of social support programs for the development of
institutio ns and families as training grounds and building blocks? Before developing
such a tramev;ork I \vould need to consider research and literature about some of the
concepts or terminology which have contributed to the evolution of thought on pe rsonal
and social transformation.

Personal and Social Transformation

Whi le we unde rstand the literal nature of see ing thi n gs di tferently, we similarl y
und�rstand the me ta phori cal nature of statements such as "it all depends on the \�.-ay you            .

look at it". "it depends on your point of view and so on   "                   .   This process by which human
beings create templ ates to fit over their rea l iti es is knO\\TI as a pe rs onal construct. [n
educat ion al terms we use the p rocess es of assimilation and accommodation to fit ne\v
ideas or e xperi en ces into existing, predictable constructs or schema unless and until a
new one is necessitated         .   Mezirow·   ( 1991)   ca lls this \vay of looking at things in scientific.
scholastic or social context, a me an ing perspective               .   He describ e s it as being articulated.
theory based and co l lectively held and otTers the work of F reucL Marx� and Skinner as

-

exampl es of theoretic al perspectives which have in fact genera ted new vocabularies.

Used o n an interchangeable basis with modet concept ual framework, approach
and \vorld view. Thomas Kuhn             ( 1962) introduced the term paradigm                to refer to \vays of
seei ng methods of inqui ry , beliefs, ideas, val ues and attitudes that intluence scientitic

�                                                        �

inquiry. The process of chang e in perspective \Vas described by Kuhn as paradib'111 atic
transformation.

Noting that the same event may be simultane ous ly interpreted by people as
different. Kelly (I 963) made the observation that our personal constructs have a range of
c onveni ence   .   Philip Candy      ( 1 989) proposed    that mea ni ng exists wi thin ourselves rather
than externally (e.g. in books) and identitied assum ptions about c o nstructiv i st thought,
suggesting that our me ani ngs are validated through human interaction and
c omm unication      .   He sugge sts that our acti ons are based on o ur meani n g            .   Transformation
theory th e n would suggest that how people e xplain and interpret what happens to them
impacts their actions their aspi rations the ir \Ve 11 being and their competence to a

greater e:dent than the simple event itself Expectation� I would suggest� becomes a

I I

critical element in our decisions to act. It is the change in expectation. about \vhat has.
is. or might happen that is associated vvith transfonnative learning.

Current dominant approaches to adult education emphasize both stimulus-response
associations andior the storage and retrieval of information.    Mezirow dre\v upon
Habennas's   ( 1971) distinction between instrumental and communicative learning in his
consideration of the nature of how this transfonnative process takes place     .   His
conceptualization of transfonnative learning involves reflection or critique of our
assumptions as an initial step. Through assessment or reassessment our premises may be
found to be distorting� inauthentic. or othenvise invalid. Memory is vie\..-ed as an
inherent function of perception and cognition, through which \Ve actively recognize and
re-interpret prevrously learned experience in ne\'..- contexts. So, when old mea m ng
schemes prove to be inadequate we create ne\v ones. This process of reme m bering.,
however. is dependent on the extent to which experience and.! or learning is integrated.

Habermas descri b es technical, practical, and   em ancipato ry   dimensions of human
knov.-ledge \vhich are related to the environment. other people. and po we r. He associates
the first two with instrumental and communicative learning respectively and the third
with critical retlection.   Instrumental learning, technical in nature, involves predictions
about observable, physical or social.. events which are either correct or i nco rrect are.,

hased on empirical kno\vledge� and are governed by technical rules. This styl e of
learning is task oriented and determines cause and effect through problem-solving.
Meaning is acquired by testing a hypothesis to 'make it better'. Communicative learning,
practical in nature.. has as its purpo se the understanding of \vhat others mean and making
ourselves understood by others. Habermas suggests that it is governed by consensual
norms which define reciprocal expectations understood by at least two interacting
people. The validation of such norms. to reach consensus, is achieved through a process

that Haberrnas terms rational discourse. �1ezirow describes the conditions for thi s
di scourse as a connection between what "is" and "ought". Emanci patory learning results
from selfretlection. Em anci patol)· kno\vledge. gained through critical re fl ection. IS
distinct from our techn i ca l or practical knowl edge. In this process we appraise our
condition and are em ancipated from that \vhich li mits our vo l i tion. So. the process of
constructing the self is conditional upon the interactive relationship benveen knowledge.
volition and action. Thi s reflective, purposeful implementation of acti on is referred to by
transformation theori sts such as Freire (   1970) as praxis .

Given our understanding of the process of transtonnation. and in particular the
connection between action and reflection. we are chall enged to consider the way in
which th is study addresses personal and soc i al transformati on. It ex plores the provision
of family support in a comm unity context. It provides opportunity for the children and
youth of fam i l ies to be heard. and for fam il ies to share their values and beliefs. It enabl es
eval uation of the benefits of that process and the possible impact on policy related to
fam ilies in the com munity. I \Viii reflect on the applicability of the tindi ngs of thi s study
to other com munities of affinity and policy making bodies in later chapters.

Association for Baha'i Studies in Ottawa to ascertain their a\\iareness of related Baha'i
studies. I also dre\v upon professional co ntacts in the Baha i community to solicit their

'

advice or directi on. These queri e s were met with ent husia sm and encourage ment to
cond uc t what was seen to be necessary , ground-breaking w·ork.

The sco pe of the revie\v retl e cts my research interest, the expl oratory nature of the
study, and the limited amount of literature available on the research probl em          .   The
studies that I reviewed gene r a ted predominantly c onceptua l , \\lith some empirical.
inform ati on for the purpose of providing a background for the s tudy         .

Families

Literature on the family prov ides a perspect ive on change in family behavior over
ti m e and within social and cultural context Hareven ( 1984) sugg ests that historical
research has shown that families are active in the i r contacts \vtth external forces and that
rece ntly the view of the fam ily has moved trom that of an isolated household unit to a
developmental approachT exploring family interaction \vtth other social processes and
institutions.

1�

R�cent questioning of the viability of the family has been associated by Eichler
( 1983) \\ith the notion of a particular family structure and the idea that alternatives to
that structure threaten its sun·ival. The family sening could not remain unatTected by the
rapid social, technological and economic changes of the current period. [n the context of
change which presents so many ne\v social phenomena. it is no wonder that we do not
fully understand those changes nor their implications for families and policy makers.
New panems of family interaction for children and youth are stil1 emerging, implying
another generation of transition. Eichler suggests that we move toward an understanding
of a dimensional vie\v of the family and describes some of these dimensions. One
dimension identifiecL but not addressed, is the religious/ethical dimension.

Baker ( 1990) describes seven current theoretical perspectives of the family.

1\. Structural Functionalism focuses on the structures, including the family, which govern
people's behavior and maintain a cohesive and stable society. 2. The Systems approach
focuses on how the behavior of individuals is interrelated with that of other family
members. 3. The Political Economy approach argues that how people make a living
determines relationships, lifestyles, attitudes, and values. �- Symbolic [nteractionism
suggests that social reality is created through the exercise of free \'will. 5. Exchange
Theory assumes family relationships to involve negotiation and bargaining.       6. The
Developmental perspective views the family as a series of relationships that grow and
develop over time. 7. The Feminist perspective focuses on womens' experiences of
social reality. and gender inequality. These perspectives may both enrich the study of
tamlly life and cause rifts among researchers.

The search for the good home, insensitivity to sociocultural relativity. an
exaggeration of the loss of earlier functions, and moral relativism are risks associated
\vith research about the family according to Berger and Berger    ( 1983 ). Our assessment

o f any soc i al phenomen on. t hey argue. m ust re spe ct the val ues of its pa rt ic i pants . yet
t h ere is l i tt l e certainty about the m ean i ngs and val ues of fam i l y l i fe. Their theoretical
assumptions are t hat: ( a ) people must decide what actions to t a k e to rea l i ze thei r \-al ues.
( b ) the experi ence of i ndividuals constructs soci e ty , ( c ) peop l e need to c reate i nstitutions
to transm i t pane ms o f meaning from on e ge nerat i o n to t he next., and ( d ) c hi l dren need a
world to grow into. G iven these assumptions, they argue th at the survival of soc i ety
req ui res a shared moral consensus. H i sto ri cal l y . the fam i ly has been the locale fo r suc h a
task. The B e rgers ask \vh at k i nd of fam ily in stituti on i s l i kely and desirable in the future.

What is the future of th e fam i ly? In addressi ng t h i s q ues t ion ., Keller ( 1 9 86 )
expects s ign i fic ant c h anges and the e m e rge nce of \vhat she calls novel forms of h um an
togetherness. She re iterates th e appearance of ne\v p hen omen a suc h as seri al marriages,
occupational and ge ograp h i cal mobi l ity, \vork ing mothers, previously forbidden topics
suc h   as   abortion. homosexual ity and i l l egi ti macy, and sta rt l i ng new bio logical
i nnovations . Pub l ic response to this c h a n gi n g moral and social c l imate is hard to predict
but she ant i ci pates a m u l ti pl i c ity of ex peri m e n ts and p ro posa l s . Asserting the im portance
of cons idering soc ial c hange in the li gh t of " moral doubt and moral reassessment"
( p. 532 ), K e l le r c ha l l e n ges us to ex amin e the present in order to a ffect the future.

Community Infl uences On The Fami ly

Because com m un i ty can take various forms, the dem onstration of com m unity
i nfl uences on the fam i ly is a complex matte r. Bronfenbrenner, Moen, and Garbarino
( 1 Q84 ) identi fy co m m o n elements to de finitions of com m un i ty. Fam i ly support, t h ey
argue. is contri buted by b o th formal and infonnal com m unity structures and they
j uxtapose t\vo p roc es ses that can either reinforce or co u n te rac t each other. First,
com mu ni ti e s can pro v ide diverse resources and chal lengi n g experiences. Second., bot h

fonnal and informal structures can serve              as   source s of stab i l i ty an d support. Of part i c ular
i nterest to the pro po sed study is t hei r identi fication of rel i gious organ izations                as

" part i c ul arl y sal i ent" �xam p l es o f formal co m m un i ty structures ( p. 306 ). and the ir

[t is no easy task to speci fy how particular env i ro n me n tal factors i nfl ue n ce pe op l e .

In singl i n g o u t the fam i l y-com m un i ty relationsh i p. G oodn o w     ( 1 988 ) pro pose s three
proces se s : enhancement, transm ission. and access. Goodno\v sees the fam i ly                          as a

collection of pe opl e not al ways agree i ng: nego t ia ti ng al l i ances and the d i v i s i o n o f l abor

and p ro poses that descri pt i o n s and ideas about connections among c h i ldren, parents.. and

or   restricted access to i n formation about one sel f, others, and the nature of social order.
Relation s h i ps. she says, can be described in terms of the obje c tive features of setti ngs and
the way that setti n gs a re pe rce i ved and she argues that pe op l e base ac ti on s as muc h on
what they see as feas ible as on what i s ac tual l y t he case         .

De s p i te increased interest in the exam ination of the bene ficial etfe c ts of social
support. Ec ke n ro de and Wethi n gton (        1 990 ) found l ittl e attenti on to the process by \vhich
social support bec om es mo b i l ized as pan of the proc ess of coping \vith stress                  .    What are,
t hey ask. the perso n al and si tuational c o n ti nge nc i es around the marshal ing of social
s upport reso urc e s? They identi fy a t h ree stage model of hel p-seeki ng i nvolving the
perc ept i on o f the s i tuati o n : the dec ision to seek, or not seek, help� and strate gi e s involved

nec essari ly an effective copi ng strategy. so the question is not i f mob i l ization of support
he l ps i ndividuals and fam i l ies but when and for \vhom i t hel ps.

Echoi ng the conc l us i ons above� Z i gler and Weiss ( I 985 ) propose a need tor
cont i nued action-research partnerships that go beyond the question o f \\lhether or not
pro!::rram s that support   tam i l ies   work to ask what works. for whom � ho\v. .\t he n . and why.

They define this action-research as a partnership bet\veen researchers and practitioners to
attain so l uti ons to social prob lem s and contribute to soci al sci enti fic know·l edge. This
partnership is founded on the appearance over the past t\venty years of com mon
questions about knowl edge and practice resulti ng i n a sh i ft from a chi l d-centred to an
e co logical   approach to the development of family support programs.

Ho\vever. A ngl i n and Gl osso p ( 1 9 86 ) argue that there has been a trend toward
dependence upon professional processes o f soc i al support leading to an erosion of the
viabi l ity of i n formal comm unity support networks. They advocate, convi nci ngly . that
fam i l ies have capabil ities for positive sel f-determi nation when surrounded by
comm unity·based re lationsh i ps of suppo rt . The ti me has come. they suggest . to support
the etTorts of people to develop a trusting and supporti ve network of kin� friends,
neighbors, or othe rs who provide an actual or perceived sense of com m un ity .

Using an ecological model of h uman deve lopment Garbarino and Crouter ( 1 97 8 )
studied the maltreatment o f c h i ldren as a probl em o f soc i al s upport systems and
resources . Research on the neglect of children has general ly centred on relationship
dy ads b ut th e i r study foc used on the envi ronment and i ndicators of fami ly stress . A
central proposi tion underlying the research was that iso l ation from "potent prosocial
support systems" ( p.606 ) is a necessary condi tion for child maltreatment. The results
strongly supported the over-arc hing hypothes is . They conc l ude that by systematic study
of the community context of parent -c hild re l ations we can enhance our understanding of

the ecology of h uman development and "bui ld upon the compe l l i ng i nsi ght that whi l e the
child is father to the man, the commun ity is parent to the fam i ly" ( p.6 1 ).

A l l an ( I 99 1 ) surveyed a sample of formal gro up parenti n g programs i n Austral ia
and suggests that parent education needs to broaden its concern beyond structural or
behav ioral change. to the b roader soc ial context. She argues that dom in ant be l i e fs or
perspecti ves on l i fe, favoring vested i nterests , i n fl uence people's thoughts and maintai n
standards of behavior. These dom i nant be l iefs rei n force a po\verful ideology of fam i l y
l i fe, a key factor of which i s division o f labor by gender. Responsi b i l ity for parenting
rests, almost excl usively, on mothers and thereby acts as a major factor in the oppress i on
of women. Her s urvey found very fe w programs based on a critical perspective,
questioning traditi onal bel ie fs. Most� based on h umanistic princi ples em phasizing
m utual respect, cooperation, responsibi l ity and sel f-rel iance, focus primari ly on parent­
c h i l d re lationships \vi th i n fam i l ies and on the i ndividual izi ng of probl em s . She suggests
that the focus on management and comm unication issues is done in isolation from the
material and soc ial context i n wh i c h t he parents l ive. Prob lems are sol ved i n
i ndividual istic ways and external factors are superficially ac knowledged. Wh i le Al lan
identi fies a l ack of criti cal writing abo ut parent education, she does surface rn·o emergi n g
issues. The ti rst is the need t o consider the value base o f programs. The second is the
need to study the experiences of i ndi viduals in programs. She contends that parent
education programs must enab le i ndi viduals to cri tically reflect on the i ss ues emerging
from their experience as paren ts. It is i m portant therefore that programs are deve loped
within a criti cal framework wh ich makes clear the val ue base and the assumptions
underlying them. She advocates a shift from gender neutral assumptions and language in
order that mothers and fathers can l ink their experience to social context and critical ly
question the dom i nant bel iefs that oppress mothers i n particul ar� and parents i n general .

Fa m i ly� Co m m u n ity and Rel igion

According to C rys dal e          ( 1 99 1 ), re l i gi on has t\vo broad funct io ns .       The process of

othe r sy stem s., rel i gio n is structural or obj ecti ve. The first o f these functions. '' i nv i si b l e
rel i gion" ( p. 9 3 ), i s d i tli c u l t to identi fy by   quanti tati ve ana l y s is   because of problems i n
de fi nition and articulation. either by researchers or their subjects. The s ec o nd functi on.
the e xte rna l or i nstitutional side of rel igi o n, is measured th rough members h i p, ri tual,
a ttendan ce , assent. and           k n o w l edge .   Both objecti ve and su bj ect i ve aspects of re l i gion are
i m portant and i nte rre lated components of this study. They provide a useful j uxtaposition
for understandi n g com plex patterns of soc ial behavior: that \vhich req u i res soc i al
rei n forcement by others and that which req ui res in te rnal val i d ity and s upport.

An i m portant. soc iol ogi cal an a l y si s of rel i gi o n is found in the work of E m i l e
Durkhe i m . H i s theory of re l i gi o n is articulated by Tole               ( 1 993 )    in re lation to the current
b reakdo\vn of the normative soc ial order. engendered by the                            i n c reas i n g divis ion o f
soc i ety into more complex forms and characteri zed by secularization. Th is tra n si t io n
from the sacred to the sec u l ar has ushered in a host of problems for modem societies.
Durkheim predicted an ego ist ic individualism by which the i ndi vidual is prior to soc iety
and t h us has supreme real ity. He attempted., To le argues, to un ders ta n d the intri nsi c
o b l i gati o n   that individuals have for one another, arisi ng out of the nature of group l i fe
and l eadi ng to formation of m oral codes, rel i gious precepts, and ethical systems.
Durk heim's so l ution was an ethic o f i ndividualism which grounded human freedom in
c o m m un i ty    - affi rm i ng i ndividual ri ghts       in re l at io n to the   well -be i n g of al l .

D'Antonio        ( 1 983 ) e xam i ned    the emerging       value orientations of American              society
toward the         fam i l y   and rel igi on� many o f \vhich are i n contradiction to long standing

fam i l y val ues. He fo und that re l i gi on i s i m po rtant to most Americans an d ch at a maj ori ty
consider the home to be the place for s p iritua l and rel i gi ous devel op me n t. Wh i l e fam i ly

asked this very q uest i o n and added. how?

A c lassic s t udy of c o m m un ity described "Middletown, U. S . A. "        ( Muncie , Indiana)
in th e m i d 1920's. Bahr and Chad\vic k ( I 98 5 ) studied t he c om m unity a hal f a century
later. They a na l yzed the t\vo studies for a relationship bet\veen rel i gion and fam i l y life
by co m pa ri ng i ndi cators of fam i l y and rel i gious practi ces. The fi n di n g s sho\v fam i l ies to
be more si mi lar than di fferent after fi fty years and that re l igion in Midd l eto wn is at least
as strong as it    eve r was.     They a rgue    agai nst   both the m yth of the dec l i ning fam i l y and the
m�1h     of sec ul ari zati on.   Not only was th ere a vigor to re l i gi on and fam i l y l i fe    consistent

Pa rti c i pa nt s confi rmed their rel i gi ous faith and devoti o n to fami l ies during i n-depth

thi s   re l ation s h i p be twee n fam ily life and rel i gi on is a relatively unstudied top ic in the
soc ial sciences which b egs atte nt i o n .

fn t hei r revie\v of academ ic research on the i nterface bet\vee n re l igion and tarn i ly,
Thomas and Henry ( 1985) discuss c hange in the soc ial sc ience perspective. Darwi n, at
mi d- nine teenth century, provided an evol utionary perspective that infl uenced social
sc i ence toward a vie\v o f social order as part of the natural o rder. signi ficantly altering

the dialogue bet\vee n p h i lo so phy and t h eo l o gy   .   After a dec l i ne of social scienti fic
i nterest i n rel i gion by the 1 920s there was a rev i val during the 1960s and 1 970s . [ n
consi deri ng the reasons for this res urge n ce o f i nterest. they c i te a re-eval uation o f the rol e
o f soc ial science in claiming tru th :   a c ri s is o f val ues and     sense of com m unity: and the
need to i nc l ude the spi ritual realm in understand i n g hum an behavior. However. in th1 s
surge o f researc h and theory they c i t e a fai l ure to notice the role o f rel i gion i n the fa m i l y    .

The maj ori ty of research emph asized the social contro l aspects of re l i gi ous i nsti tutions ­
that is. the structural c haracteristics of rel igion. Concern abo ut the soc ial support
fun ctions o f re l i gious i n st i tuti ons was absent. Yet v.-e associ ate both the fam i l y and
rel igious i nstitutions more with emotional l ove and support than other social institutions.
The h um an condition� they argue, is concerned about mean i ng � that meaning i nvolves
pe rce pt io n s of relationships with others; and that for many pe o p l e those relationships are
connected wi th their vi e\v of the relati onship \vi t h de i ty      .   The conc l usions and ch a l l e n ges
of this revi ew serve to inform the met hodo logic al pe rs pec ti v e of this study. We need to
study the fam i l y and re l i gious i nst itut io n s s i m ultaneo us l y to understand and appreci ate
the rec iprocal i n fl uence an<L further� as soc i al sc ienti sts we are chal lenged to l ook at our
O\'vn   presuppositions and to m ak e apparent our O\vn val ue positions because acq ui s i tio n

During the last t\vo centuries sign i ti cant changes in fa m i l y structure and
re l a t i ons h i ps connected \vit h c hanges in soc iety at l arge, have modified the organ i zation

of the fam i l y un it i ndiv idual behavior, and i n te racti ons \vi thi n the fam i ly. Thornton

they rem a i n as viable i nsti tutions in today's world.     [nterest in the i nterface between the
fam i ly and rel igi o us insti tuti ons duri n g the 1 9 80s fai led to pay attention to the i m pac t o f
t h e fami ly's rel igi ous c o m m unity. Researche rs tended t o emphasize rel i gious affil iation,
levels of orthodoxy or part i c i pation. Cornwall and Thomas (          1 990 ) explai n that rel i gion
is also experienced within pers ona l rel i gious communiti es of peopl e with whom
individuals are directly invo l ved: e xten ded fam i ly , friends and associ ates. Citing
research co nduc ted with Mormon populations, they concl ude th a t t he re lat i ons h ips
experienced i n the re l i gious com m unity, co up led with pri mary re lationships i n the
fam i l y, are responsible for devel opment of personal spiri tual devoti on which, in tum, is
predictive of adult we l l-bei ng_ They expect that future studies wi l l hel p us understand
how the soc i al contro l and soc ial support dim ensions of re l i gious com munities impact
i nd i viduals and fam i l ies.

As fam i l i es face diffic ulties arising from the   c hanges   in co ntem po rary l i fe, w hat
do they experience in their search for support from rel i gious doctri ne and practi ce?
Aldous   ( 1 983 ) exami ne d this question in the l ig ht of contem pora ry issues such as
\vomen's rights� di vorce and separation� and sexual behavior. We cannot ignore such
el ements of the i nterrelationship o f fam ily and re l i gion. lndividuals use re l igion to make
sense of discrepancies between moral standards and the ways of the \VOrl� or what they
e x pect and what they experience, and religious i nstitutions continue to exercise control
over behavior through both cle ri cal and comm un i ty sanctions. Wh i l e some com munities

These new social phenomena, pre v i o us ly unexperienced. have led to two tren ds                              .

I n an age of h um an istic rel ati v i sm� the p ro mo ti on of morals or val u�s may be

unity, cooperati on and harmony, responsibi l ity� and pri nc i p led behavior based on trust:
For examp le� the 'golden rule' is an et hic variously repeated in re l igi ous and moral
te ac hing s . The idea that we should treat ot hers as we \vo u l d wi sh to be treated is found
in the Baha'i Faith� enj o i ned by Baha'u'l lah ( p. 3 1 5 )           as,   "He sho uld not wrshfi>r others

of women, children and youth a l on g s i de the fail ure of e x i st ing social order to e ns ure t he

The Baha'i paradigm ( Universal House of Justice,               1 985) vie ws this di lemma in the
l i ght of t\\"0   v i e ws of hum an nature. One view agrees to the need for peace and hannony
whi le perceiving human nature as being aggressive a nd sel fish. Th i s                 pess i m i sm, they
argue, leaves h um anity unabl e to con struct a soc i al order which is dynam ic, progressive,
harmonious, and characterized by i ndi vidual creativity , ini ti at i ve , cooperat i o n and

These contradic to ry views of h uman n a t ure a re applicable to the global             c o mm uni ty ,   the

G eor ge Land ( 1 987) addresses the manner in which every growing th ing moves

H uma n ity, he suggests , has now created a complex network of connections bringi ng the

From our readi n g o f t h i s an alysis of the current global di lemma we see that the

CHAPTER 4

\<IETHODO LOGY

\lethodo logica l Perspective

This study explores the potentia l of re l igious instituti ons to pro v i de a co ntc<t for
i n formal social s upport and connection to formal. profe ssio na l fam i l y s upport programs
and services, by exam i n i ng one such com m un i ty netw·ork�         the Baha'i Faith community.
The s tudy combi nes an articulation o f the Baha'i fam i ly      paradi gm : parti cipation with a
gro up of Baha' i fam i l ies in group pro c es s : and documentation through the reporting of
experience. The study provides opportu n i ti es for chi ldren and youth to be heard.. and fo r
fam i l ies to share their val ues and bel i e fs , enabl ing analysis of the influence of the Baha'i
comm un i ty on Baha'i fam i ly l i fe and it explores impli cations for appl ication to other
com muni ties of affi nity and pol i cy mak i n g bod i es .

I n order to design a study which meets the content, context, val ues and ethics
i m p l i c i t in the stated research prob l em , I re-cons idered my practice work which was
based on and conducted through a "re-search " process. de fi n ed by Parker ( 1 9 89, p. 5 ) as,

> l ooki ng again� o f bei ng c urious; o f being i nterested in surprising patterns� of being
> a b l e to reflect upon \'-·hat happe ns in a systematic fas h i on: and., abo ve al l , having the
> con fidence to adopt a critical attitude towards conventional wisdom, accepted
practi ce or current fashion.

As an exam p le, I looked at a project I had undertak en          in 1 990 as a consul tant with
a First Nations comm un i ty because o f its simi l arity and part i c i patory approach . The
terms of reference incl uded the conduct of consultative          m eeti n gs   \vtth comm un ity
members, through which the identity of the comm unity             was   enhanced and the
contri butions of its members were res pected and v a l ued. Th is is an example of
partici patory research wi th a comm unity of affinity.        The similarity l ies in comm i tment to

researc h grounded i n the expt!ri ence o( and descri bing real i ty from the pe rspec ti vt! o t:
those \vho have traditional ly been excl uded from the production of research.

K i rby and Mc Kenna (    1 989.   p.65 ) suggest as s u m pti o n s on wh ich methods
appropriate to this   type   of research are grounded:

Knowl edge is soc ial l y constructed
> 2. Social i nteractions form the basis of soc ial kno\vledge
> 3 . Di fferent peop l e experience the world di ffe rently
> -1-. Because they have di fferent experience� people have di fferent knowledge
> 5 . Knowl edge changes over time
6. Di fferences in po\,,.er h ave resul ted in the commodi fication o f knowl edge and a

> monopoly on knowledge production
> This raises the i m ponant i ssue of methodo logical perspective. On the whole,
soc ial sc ientists have tended to emphasize theory. Farzam Arbab (           1 992 ) argues    that too
strong an emphasis on the development of model s or theoriesy through             experimt!ntation
and measurement� l imits the types of problems that are considered \vorthy of
i nvestigation. Research questions, he suggests, ari se fro m the interests of small groups,
are seen through the l ens of t h e dominati ng fe\v, and are exami ned \Vtth i nstruments that
have the cultural and social biases of the i nvesti gators.

A c knowledging the need for a methodological frame \\·ork \vithi n \vhich \Ve can
carry out action and reflection, this study uti l ized the process of consultation, which i s
em bedded i n the exi sting frame\vork of the Baha'i Teac hi ngs, to gather data. The
partici pants were fam iliar with this process, providing congruency benveen t h e i r
experience and the methodol ogy o f the study.

But thi s process of consultation is no mere discussion of con formity to prescribed
'truth'. fn her book, A s ki n g Questions: A Chal lenge to Fundamental ism ,       Nakhjavani

( 1 990 .,, suggests that a Baha'i is one who bel ieves i n the po\ver of asking qut:stions. She
asks ( p. 1 ),

> '' How dse can one approach an�1hi n g so dazz l i ng   as a Re,·elation and avoid
> b l i ndness? Any study of the Baha' i teachings requires that \\'e recogn i ze shadows to
> be o u r means of i nquiry, shadows to be the l anguage \Ve construct, the images we
> comprehend. The areas of shadow are \\·here t he questions arise, where \Ve see sharp
> contrasts and grapple v.ith cont rad i cti on s . That is where we can begin to s hape the
principles that \\l·o uld othenvise bl ind us. "

This idea of shapi ng, construcring7 through inquiry� our personal and col lective
understandi ng, our knowledge, is fundamental to the Baha'i perspective . Hatc h er a nd
Martin ( 1 984) explain,

"The process of community building is wel l advanced i n the Baha'i Faith. During the
> ti rst century of i ts existence� the Baha'i community was pri mari ly concentrated i n
> Persia where, as a proscribed and m uch persecuted minority, it had little opportunity
> to experiment w·ith the teachings of its founder. Once the teac h in g plans we re
> i m plemented . . . however, . . . the collective l i fe o f the bel ievers began to m anifest
some of these 'soc iety-building' potential ities. "

rn Chapter 2, I spoke about personal and soc ial transformation. Danesh ( 1 9 86)
suggests that h uman soc ieties are transformed through a m ultitude o f causes \Vhich may
bring about change thro ug h confonnity to individual or group ideology. He argues that
successful transformation of h uman soc iety m ust con form to uni versal la\vs of growt h
which propel humanity forward to\vard a mature society, characterized by th e assertion
o f the nobi l ity of every human being and the ulti mate victory o f the human spirit.

Danesh suggests that the Baha'i perspective on this process necessitates the
consci ous development of a "pol itics of transformation which \Vi i i harness the inherent
and i n\oiolable laws of l i fe and growth govern i ng h uman societies" (p. 1 1 8). Growth
dynam ics of human soc ieties, he argues, are both natural and intentional .

I chose a methodological approach grounded in the experiential knowledge of the
partici pants, because that is the knowledge being sought by the study. I wo uld better

.., .,
.., _

understand that knowledge through the process o f group consultati on. the as k i ng of
q uestions.

This approach uti l i zes data gathering techniques whi c h encourage the researcher's
experi ence to be part of the content and process of the research. Because I have been an
educator, in both fonnal and non-formal settings, for over a quarter of a century; because
my first fonnal re searc h endeavor ( I 98 1 ) i nvol ved the conduct of foc us !::'To ups o f
teachers, parents and resource professionals� and because the nature of m y \vork si nce
1 989 has pri mari l y been the conduct of training \Vorkshops for parents_ fam i l i es,
community agencies . s c hool statTs and the l i ke, [ have developed a high standard of
com petence i n moderati ng the group consu ltation process.

Glaser and Strauss ( 1 96 7) suggest that research which is experiential ly based
prov ides greater detai l which., in turn .. enables more po\verful descriptions and analysis.
Hein ( 1 988) states that by mode l i ng "the kind o f sel f-di sclosing behavior which he hopes
his subjects \vi i i adopt", the researcher estab l i shes a reflexive methodo logy \vhi c h wi l l
reveal meaningful data. G iven these aspirations, the parti cipatory method that I sdected
for th is study was the group i n terview ( Stewart and S hamdasani , 1 990 ).

Data Collection \lethods

A qual itative, desc ri pti ve design was used to guide data col lection and analysi s.

The primary source of the i n fonnation which f so ught \vas experience. The study focuses
on the direct   e xpe rie n ce   of the partici pants. while integrating the researchers ( my )
experience and taking into account� as secondary data� \\<·hat may have been written or
documented about the research topic. In order to ground the study in the experience of
the participants i t became critical to reflect on the data gathering process. People do not
necessari ly share   a   common perspective. The y do share excl usion from participation in

the construction of ex pressions o f their own experience. even tho ugh expl ai n ing the
worl d is   a   human activity.

In seeking knowl edge th i s study re flects four aspirations:      1 . It i s attentive to the
experience of the partic i pan ts. 2. It attends the dynam ics o f power by fac i l i tat i n g a voice
for the chi ldren and youth. 3 .       It goes beyond descri ption to reach for theoretical
expl anations of vv·hat is happe n ing i n the soc ial context of the partici pants. 4. Thro ugh
that process, the participants are abl e to see      themselves in the reporting of their
expenence.

The study util i ze d a group i nterview format by which the participants were asked
to describe thei r perceptions of the i n fl uence on fam i l y l i fe t hat resu l ts from study and
reflection on the Baha'i Teac hi ngs, whether in written form or through discussion: and
through parti c i pation in com m unity events and access to c ommun i ty relationsh i ps wi t h
friends, bet\veen generations,        through community service, and in the ethn ic and c u l tural
backbrrounds and traditions of its members.

[ chose the gro up i nterview method because, for several reasons , it ' fit' the researc h
prob lem structurally and phi l osophical ly.      I . It enabled an i nitial exploration of Baha'i
fam i ly and com m unity l i fe topics about which there is c urrently no research i n formation

avai l able. 2. It �nabled direct col l aboration \\lith participants in the co l l ection and
i nterpretation of data, enabling participants to work with the researcher ( me ) to ens ure
that the findi ngs accurate l y represent thei r views. Partici pants became co-researc hers i n
the process rather than subjects to be studied. 3 . The group process provided an
opportun ity for participants to gain support from one another and there i s evi dent
potential for such an experience to lead        to action planni ng.

Groups are used i n address i n g social research because people c hoose to function in
groups and thereby produc e soc ial prob lems. Moore ( 1 9 87, p. 5 ) provides four
compe l l i ng reasons for group research methods:

> 1 . A group can do som e things better than an individuaL
> 1   I t is necessary to obtai n the vi e\vs of the actors to understand soc ial problems.
3 _ If we are concerned abo ut the    c o nseq ue nces   of our researc h it is beneticial to use

groups.
-t Co mp lex i l l-defined problems can often o n l y be addressed by poo led i n tel l ige nc e .

This approach is characteristic to the t\ventieth century. As work \Vit h groups has
evo l ved techniques have been developed to overcome problems typical to groups. These

tec hniques are designed to aven aggressiveness. to generate alternative ideas. to decrease
apprehension amongst group members who have not known eac h other, and to provide
means for recording de l i berations. Because a basic tenet o f group methods is that they
would involve those l ikely to be a ffected by the knowledge generated. techniq ue s were
deve loped to assist gro ups to acco m pl i s h tasks suc h as planning for c hange so l ving

problems, or generating ideas.

Traditionally, problem so l v i ng has bee n carried out by experts who analyze and
s o l ve prob l e m s i ndependent of those who l i ve the pro ble m s. Design methods. using a
di fferent set of as sumpti o ns were devel oped i n t he 1 970's and Moore ( p. 2 1 ) provides

poi nts of com parison between \vhat he cal l s fi rst and second gen e ratio n methods. These
address expertise, dec ision m aki ng process, identi fication of fundamental issues, control
over j udgments, and col l aborative production and i m ple m e ntati on of proposals. The
lmportant poi nts of comparison are as fol lows:

The process se lected for this study fal l s \\ithin the assum ptions o f second
generation methods because it addresses an i l l-defi ned problem that requires the
partici pat ion of those respons i b l e for the so l ut i o n . Begi nning with that problem, the
group provided focus and a c lear agenda.

Stewart and Shamdasani ( 1 990 ) desc ribe the group intervi ew as di scussi o n under
the direction of a moderator, genera l l y i nvolving 8 to 1 2 individuals, lasting from one and
a   hal f to t\VO and a hal f hours, and poss i b l y i nvo l vi n g audio or video tapi n g. The
moderator may be more or less directive and, they argue, a balance between what is
i m portant to the group and what is im portant to the researc her m ust be struc k. Group
i nterviev1s are primarily conducted for the purpose of collecti ng qualitative data because
they produce a rich body of natural data expressed in the partici pants' own \vords. They
suggest that the successfu l     use   of groups requi res assurance that their use is consistent
with the objectives and purpose of the researc h. S teps for such a design are ( p. 20 ) .

The groups met t\vice during Apri l , 1 99 5 . T he first stage was a separate group
i nter i ew for adults., lasti ng two hours, and one for the chi ldren, l asting one hour. No

v

youth attended the first session. Two research tasks were addressed to produce pri mary
data. T h at data was catego ri zed in preparation for the secon d stage. The second stage,                     as

fol low up, was joi nt group consultation by the adults, lasting t\vo hours, on the nature of
the data generated by t h e first session and on a third research tas k . At that second
session, two youth attended and a separate one hour session was held with them to
address the three research tas ks and to analyze thei r respo nses             .   None of the children who
participated in the first session chose to partici pate in the second. The pri mary means of
record ing these groups interview discussions was th e use of tl i p-charts. I n addition the
sessions were recorded on audio-tape and transcribed to written notes and computer disk
to facil itate analysis. A l l of the data recorded          \vas   kept secure under lock and key. This
process of reaction, ret1ectio� clari fication and consol idation engaged the partici pants in
the analysis of the data. In Chapter 5, I         wi l l   expand on the way i n wh i ch the adul t an d
y outh participants were e ngaged in the reporting process. The design of the group
process was gui ded by four components :

> 1 . The research purpose and approac h            was     e x p la ined to participants at tirst contact.
> '"'       The questions faci l itated a shari ng of i deas� p h il osophy and experience.
3. The setting and format suggested an equal relationship between researcher and
participants.

�- The researc h process was dy n am i c. Re peated sessi o ns were planned for the

> purpose of re flection and to gat he r any new i n formation about strongly fe lt

Data Ana lysis

By us i n g group i nterviews, a l arge vo l ume of data \Vas gathered in a short t i me .

�fak i ng sense of that data, ana l ysis. was crit ical to my abi l i ty to desc ri b e and exp l ai n
what was be ing studied and to provide a deepe r understanding. The fi rst step i n my
anal�1ical p l an was o rgan i zi n g the data. The sec ond was understandin g the data. The
data col l ection plan o ffered voice to the part ic i pa nts and provided opportunity for critical
retlection on the context of the i n fonnation generated . The data an a lysi s pl an was
consistent with the c o nstant c omparative method o f G laser and Strauss            ( 1 967) and
prov i ded for the exam i n ation of soci al real i ty ch a mp i oned by Freire ( 1 985). Data were
m ana ged by groupi ng items in data fi les whi c h were expected to generate spec i fic a nd
general pattern s . Fi les were described on the basis of what they contai ned and were
analyzed by bri nging information together unti l patterns begin to emerge. Catego ri es
identi fied ideas� events"' the mes. or common properties associated with the data items.

The analysis o f data with i n categories was the first step to conso l i dati ng i n formati on and.
by analys is bet\veen catego ri es, ( looked for common properties to identi fy relationships.
The cn tena   for d e term i n i n g the data fi l es and emergi n g patterns \vere the four research
que s t i o ns which guided the st u dy    .   At the fi rst group i nterviews the adult and chi l d
parti c i pants addressed the fi rst tv·..·o quest ions by respond i n g to the         tol l o w t n g   tasks :

Fi ve forms of analysi s \vere conducted. Fi rst, after the i n terv i e\v sessions, I
ranked si m i l a r responses   as   data items . Seconc:L I sorted these items i nto categori es                   .   The
total for (!ac h category was es tab l i sh e d by add ing up the num ber of items which were
assi gned to that category. Thi rd, duri ng the second group i ntervie\vs� the data ran k i ngs
and categories were present ed to the adult part ic i pan ts by which they became part of the
analysis. Because no     yo ut h attended the ti rst      i nte rviews , these     q uest i o ns   were addressed
and the analysi s was carried o ut at the time of the second gro up i n tervi ews. The results
are reported i n Chapter 5 , Table l and Table 3 . Fourth, the characteristics from Table I
were com pared \vith those found i n a compi l ation of wri ti ngs of the Baha'i Faith on
marriage and fa m ily life ( National S piritual Assembly of the Baha' is of Canada� 1 983 )                            .

Because the second task was phrased so as to fac i l i tate the surfacing of any

Eth ics

lt is my conviction that research on a gi ven problem is best canied out by those
\vho experience it. Partici pants were seen as col laborators in this study. not o n l y
prov iding data b ut taking part� t o a l i m ited extent, in t h e analysis and presentation o f the
data. There fore, there \vere so me eth ical considerations to address . First., t he researc h
was concerned wi th gathering i n formation that would explore and perhaps transform
c urrent re lat i ons of support in the comm un i ty under study. [t also has the potential to
otTer i nsight for use in and by other comm un i ties and policy makers in the public
domai n . So, the purpose and conduct of the research was c l arified at the begi n n i ng and
duri ng the study. Fai l ure to do so wo uld have, as Hein    ( 1 9 88) argues, left the subj ects at
ri sk to be treated as too ls to ach ieve the researc her's end rather than to be seen as
co l laborators. Second, should the study have been carried out by this researcher ( me )?
The most important ethical problem for this study was the empowerment of the vo ice of
the chi ldren and youth mem bers of the partici pant fam i l ies. Based on my practice
t!xperience as a school teacher I have com petency in the conduct of group discussions
\\ith these age groups. Other issues around the i nfl uence of relationshi ps of po\ver in the
conduct of the group sessions were addressed in the data col lection process. In my vi ew�
the separation of age groups facilitated open discussion among participants about the i r
experiences and ideas. This was evidenced by the participation o f al l o f the chi ldren and

Th is l eads us to s pec i fic Issues associat ed with the !:,'l'Oup interview. K i rby and

engagement of those communi ties with the researc h topic. the study was l i m i ted to Baha'i
fam i ly members res i d i ng wi th i n the geograph ical region of the Cowie han Va l l e y     .

Because of the e xploratory and qualitative nature of the study, the groups were
l i m ited to no more than t\\l·el ve peo ple, and the catego ri es of pani c i pants v.as l i m i ted to
adult. chi ldren ( aged 1 4 and younger), and youth ( aged I S and older ) Baha'i family
panicipants .

The fo l lowing pri nc iples guided selection o f the participants:
> I . Th e panici pants had to be Baha'i fam i l y groupi ngs.
> 2. The fam i l ies had to reside within the geographical region o f the study.
3 . The panici pants had to be i nterested i n the topic of study and be wi l li n g to share

openly their experiences in the i nitial sessions and successive steps.

Poss i b l e partic i pants� whether Baha'i fam i l ies or i ndiv iduals in the CO\twic han
Val ley munic ipal ities� al l received a written i nvi tation to take part in the group researc h
workshop ( see Append i x F), clearl y indicati n g that by doi ng so th ey would be
participating i n this study . Thirteen fami lies responded by indicati ng that they wished to
panici pate. Of these, fi ve fami lies did not attend the i ntervie\v sessions, but one
additional fam i ly did turn up and ask to participate. Th us nine fami l ies are represented i n
the study.

There were four categories of partici pants i n the group i nterview sessions: mysd [
as t he researcher� the adult ( parent ) members of the fami l ies: the youth members of the
tam i 1 ies. aged      1 5 ye ars    and ol der: and the c h i l dren� aged under 1 4 years .

The partic i pants w·ere di verse on the dimensions of age and gender, and brought a
vari ety of perspect i ves and bac kgrounds to address the research q uesti ons. However.
they did not represe nt a range of ethnic groups represented                         in   the makeup of the Baha'i
com mun i ty in the Co\vic h an Val ley. Given the i m port an ce p l aced in the Baha'i teac h i ngs
on the organic unity of the human race, future work wi th Baha'i communities should pay
attention to this dimension i n recruiting and selecti ng                     pa rtic i pan ts   .   The i m pact of such
considerations         wi l l    be cons i dered in the disc ussion of the fi ndings and in the conc lusion .

A total of nventy two Baha'is took part i n this study                    .   The adult group consisted of

Describing the Natu re and Characteristics of Ba ha ' i Fam i ly Life

The fo l lo wi n g di scussion is based upon Tab l e I , the rankings of the categories of

Relationship \V ith the Baha' i Com m u n ity

This was the most frequent category overall with 29 out of a total of 1 43 i te m s
i nc l uded in Tab l e I . The category arose from the grouping of res pon se items. describi ng
Bah a i fam i ly l i fe, which made reference to i nteraction or re lat io ns hi p with the Baha'i

com m un i ty. [t was one of two fo remost categ ori es of characteristics i n the adults' v i ews
about the Baha i family, fo und in 23 out of 1 1 1 adult responses. They i ncluded

references to the "ke}·ing " of fam ily goals to Baha'i concerns: for exam ple� servi ce to the
comm unity and i ts members and the al location of fa m i ly funds to the needs of the
comm u n i ty .

The adults spoke about the re g u la r c om m un ity events ( e.g. Feasts and Holy Days )
as   a structure for fam i l y planni ng and introduced the notion of the com m un i ty                   as   a
su ppon    ne two r k :   " 71ze Huhu '1 comnzunuy   ts   an   t!Xtendedfunu(v    :
''   '\n� ask nther Ruhu 't.'"

jiJr gurdunce on jum1�v muliers ":         "we c..:n nnect wah olher Ruhu 'is. " They           a l so    m entioned
the opportun ity for roles for i nd i v i dual s p rovi d ed by the com m u n i ty : and the not i o n o f
connection to "fnstlfullons and ceremony ".

The chi l dren's responses fit in t h i s category more than any other, with fi ve o ut of
a total of 23 responses� although their items did not include re feren c e to the setting of
fam i ly goals or connection to l nsti tutions. When one child stated that.                   "we   get   ro   go   tn

Feusts and Summer School und 11.,. fun ", brief discussion took place about the di ffic ulties
of not tak in g part in C h ristmas celebrations. This pr oblem was re fi·a med as a bene ti t
when re ference was made to the four day period ca l l ed Ayyam-i-Ha� from February 25 t o

Relatio n s h i ps \\' ithin the Fam ily

The second most fequent category of characteristics� with a tota l of 25 of the 1 43

i tems. consists of re s po n se items which referred to rel ationships of support \vithin the
family . Adults gen e rated 22 of their l l l ite m s in this category . The characteristics
which \vere val ued inc l uded :      '\ensrttVllJ' to stuges 1n our c.le ve/opmenr ": ''Rahu 't

and th e sharing of fam i l y duties and tasks. One adult pa rti c i pant described a fam ily l i fe
that: "changes as we grow ".

mea ni n g that Baha'i fam i ly l i fe is based on re tlection on Ba ha i val ues and p ri nc i pl es and

This category scored the fourth highest tot al             out   of the 1 43 item s at 1 9 . The adults
cen tred 1 8 of t he i r I l l i tems on responses vihich described the fam i l y as a "lnvrng

The fi fth most freq uent category of characteri stics of Baha'i fam i ly l i fe. mentioned
i n 1 4 of 1 1 1 items by a d ul ts   �   was    seen to be those tests and di fficulties in vo lved in fac i n g

Education of all Fam ily \lembers

A l l t h ree age groupings made re fe re nce to education and/or l ea rn i n g as
characteristic aspects of Baha'i fami ly l i fe, g ivi ng rise to the sixth ranked category, w·ith a
tota l of 1 7 out of 1 43 items. The ad ul ts incl uded 1 2 statements about education, c i t i ng
the fami l y as t he location for teach ing and learni ng about Baha'i p ri n c i p l es and h istory�
re fe rri n g to the op po rt u n i ty for all fami ly members to part i c i pate in Baha'i com m un ity

Relationsh ip \Vith the �on-Baha ' i Com m u n i ty

The seventh category o f c ha racte ri sti cs was mentioned i n l l out of the 1 43 items:
e i ght t i mes by adu l ts and three by c h i l dren . The nature of the relati onsh ip betv��·een
Baha'i fam i l i es and the non-Baha'i    c ommun i ty   was variously described by adults      as

hospitality and   inviting pe op l e to the home: providing assistance to those in need: a nd
tell i ng friends about the Ba h a i Faith. C hi l dren made one reference to hospitality and t'\vo

references to telling others about their Fai th. The relative l ack o f references to
relationships outside of the Baha'i comm unity is consistent with the extent to wh ich the
partici pants describe their i n ti m ate involvement with the Baha'i community and thei r
strugg l e t o balance time� reso urces and e nergy.

Compa ring the Responses With P rev ious Work ln The F ield

Ho\v do the characteristics of fam i ly l i fe    gene rated   by the participants in this
study comp are wit h other literature in thi s area?

The a l l ocatio n of equivalent i mponance to relations hip wi t h the Baha'i
com munity and rel ati onsh ips within the fami l y is consi stent \vtth Hareven's idea        ( I 9 84 )
that our view o f the fami l y has shifted from that o f an isol ated household unit to being an
interactive social unit.

It al so s upports Eich ler's   ( 1 983 ) suggesti on that we pay attention to and explore
the re l i gi ous�C�thical dimension of fami ly l i fe to funher our understanding of the
implications o f rapid soc i al .. economic and technological ch an ges for families. Eichler
notes that fami lies vary greatly in their structure or co m pos i t i on : and in the range of
experiences from sa t is fY i ng to e xp l o i tative , that the y provide for their members. ln orde r

to avoid a restricti ve, monolithic c atego rizat ion of families., she suggests
reconceptualizing the aspects of fami ly definition from 'functions' to 'dimensions o f

fam i l i al i nteractions'. In Chapter 3 . I ment i on e d that Eichler describes some o f th ese
di mensions. She also notes other dimensions worthy of consideration, inc l ud i ng the
re li gious and ethi cal di m e n s i on   .   W i th i n eac h di mension. s he argues. vari o us degrees o f
i n teract ion can b e identi fied. Th is v i e w is use ful i n disc ussin g the res ults o f thi s study   .   It
i s apparent from the responses in Tab le 1 that the participants have described a fam i l y
l i fe which involves complex.. interactive relat i o n sh i ps . This is consi st en t wi t h E i c h ler's
perspecti ve.      Indee d interaction with those outs i de of the trad itional n uc l ear fam i l y

speci fically the Baha'i community. was referred to \vtth equal treq ue ncy as relations h i ps
\vi t hi n the fami ly. Because my categorization of the responses arose from the patterns
wh i c h emerged out of those very responses� the bias o f a preconceived defi n ition o f
fam i ly was avoided.

The partic ipants see Baha' i fam ily l i fe as i ne xtri cab l y l inked to the Baha'i
c omm uni ty   .   ln B aker's ( I 990 ) art i c ul ation of theoretical perspectives of the fam i l y, th i s
v ie\v is consistent with both Structural Functional i sm, w h i c h focuses o n the social
structures \vh ich govern behavior and mai ntai n soc ial coh es i on and stabi l ity : and the
S y s te ms app roac h which focuses on the interre l ationships \vl thin the fam i ly . The results

suggest that the latter approach also applies to the ecological relationshi p of the fam i ly
within the larger community: and \vt th val ues or pri nciples.

El even of the categories found in the compi lation on marriage and fam i ly l i fe
p ub I ished by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Canada were represented
in t h e responses gene rated by the fi rst group i ntervi ew· question. A comparison of the
t\ve lve headi ngs used in the chapte r on fam i ly l i fe ( p. 2 8 ) with the cate gori es generated i n
Tab l e 1 is fo u nd i n Table 2 . The idea that the re l ati onsh i p with fam i ly members
c onti nues after death was not raised by the partici pants. The order of the headings in the

compil ation does not im pl y any pri ority or h i erarc hy of values or pri nc ip le . and l did not
determ ine to what extent the partici pants were fam i l iar with the com pi lation.

The t!mp hasi s given by the adult panici pa nts to re lati onsh i p with the Baha'i
com m un i ty and re lationshi ps w ith i n the fam i ly s uggests congruence bet\\'een the

·

dec l aratio n of agree me nt i m p l ie d by m em bers h i p in a s pec i fi c Faith comm unity and the
striving to trans late i ts teachi ngs i nto l i festy l e . Given the cha llen ge of achieving this
balance of bel ie f and pract ice i n their fam i ly and community li ves, it is not surprising th at
several of the items generated by the adult partici pants referred to s uch a struggle.

S i m il ar ly . the children partic i pati n g in this study referred to al l of the categories
in the compil atio n except death. The youth responses d i sc l osed little about fam i ly
i nteraction but did relate to several of the co m pi l ation headi ngs.

The primary d i ffe renc e bet'w'4·een the framework of headings from the co mpi lation
and t he results of this st udy is sim pl y that the fi rst is a set of statements intended to guide
val ue, princ i ple and behavior. The second is a n anic u l at i o n of the actual experience and
observation of people striving to confonn thei r l i ves to that bTU i da nc e . The fi ndi ngs
suggest that the guidance and expectatio ns found in tht! teac hi n gs of the B aha'i Fai th have
relevance to and i n fl uence on the actions and e xperie n c e of the panici pants.

\lodeling Practice of Values and Princi ples

l n a s i m i lar m an ner to the \vay i n which. i n Tab le I , partic ipants identi fied the
fam i l y as the location for reflecti on on and appl ication of s hared val ues and pri nc i ples:
the com m unity    was   seen to be a l ocat i on of, and to have a responsibility for, mode l ing

Social Su pport for Fa m ilies

Consistent wi t h the notion that family l i fe interrelates with comm unity l i fe, the
t h i rd most frequent category, generati ng 27 o f 1 6.2 i tem s associated the com m un i ty with

i n formal social support fun cti o ns : as an extended fam i l y .        "Baha 'i communlfJl hec.:omes
nur ji.1mr�v ".   . . . u/most /rke cousms ": or a circ l e of friends providi n g fee l i n gs of i n ti m ac y
and unity, "close relationships ureformed henveenjamrlies ". The potential fo r tens ion
and estrangement was also addressed , "ucceprunc:e seems conditroned rfyou 're not up to
their standard., '': as was the extent to which the comm unity dom inates the soc ial l i fe of

fam i l ies� "opportunrlles t o snuull=e nutsule are llmued hy llme. energy. \.·ufues. he/ref\: "

This category had     the highest frequency o f res po n ses by c h i l dren who referred six
t t mes to the com m un i ty as a so urce of soc ial i n tl uence: ''!Is   u   gnud 1Jea. /. or" n(penplt:

experienced i n b ri n ging together Baha'i a nd non-Baha'i soci a l re lationsh i ps, one c h i l d
stated. ''its jun. hut I reul(v   woulcl /rke one ofm vfrlends t o hecome u Ruha 'r ".

_

Feasts, Holy Days and Fo rm a l Events

The regular or fonnal soc ial support mechanisms o f Baha'i com m unity gatherings
were menti oned as an infl uence on fam i l y l i fe with equal frequency to the i n formal social
support functions. i n a total of twenty-seven items. Thi s was d ue to the generation of 24
o ut of 1 3 8 responses by ad u lts , w·ho c i ted these events as a means by wh ich fam il ies are
connected to the community and to t he Baha'i Faith. "the Feast keeps t he famr(v in touch
'1-nth the Ruhu'i communuy and rn touch wah the Ruhu 'i udmrnLstru/ lve order ". They also
mentioned t h at t he p l a nni ng and   atmos p he re o f these events can make        it   di ffi cu l t to bring
c h i ld re n , ''event.'i can he horrng for chr/Jren and the long term ejfect rs that children don 't
wut,t to he assllciated with the Fuuh ".        Yet attendance at community events               was   seen to
l i teral ly bri n g fam i l ies togeth er. and to p ro v i de for the nurturing of sel f expresssion.

The youth referred i n t\vo of their eight responses, to com m unity gatherings                    as   an
int1 uence: "the cnmm unrty comes togelher ut Feusts. Holy /Jays und gutherrngs wluch
Wiuul(v results m the sharrng of icleus ".

Socia l S uppo rt for Individ uals

I   c hose to separate response     items which referred to social supJX>rt for individuals
from those about support for famili e s because it was a c atego ry to which                 yo uth referred

four out of f!ig ht ti mes and a bout whic h women made s i gn i fi cant a nd i m port a nJ
com ments.     "The c.:nmm unlly zs like _\:vur fuml(t,/y one youth stated, a ffi rm i ng the notion o f
t!Xtended fam i l y. "11 'rt;nuld help yn u out w a h prnhlt!m,·. �urdunce ": and. "wlzt:n someone
1n 1/ze co mtn un lly IS struggluzg, thf!)' will s upport them and pru_v iJr       thenz   ".

The adu lts i n c l uded six com ments abo u t the ex pe rie nce o f i so l a t i o n and deval umg
of women . For example�        "the present Rahu 'i communuy 1s my h1gge:·.-t challenge.               !'he
mc,ynrlly are proje.umnuls. !feel Jsn/uted. some thing rs mJs.HngjiJr me.                  I don '! kno·w m_v

"I am on('-' u mother: lnnked do wn upon tf ! ha ve difjicullles ". One adult raised the issue
o f the "hlurr1ng hetween I um u Baha 'i und I um         a   mem her of the Baha 'i communuy ".
Yet� the adults also spoke about "1ndivcduul support 1n limes ofcnsis ".                   For one,
"interac:t1ng wah the communcty 1s u _,·umu/us jiJr 1nd1v iduai growth 'y.

This category suggests that the experience o f soci a l support from the co m m u n i ty
is complex, dimensional, and related to i ndividual developmental stages, needs and
expect ations . The i m pl i ca t ion s of thi s are disc ussed in more de p th in Chapter 6 .

Ed ucation

Children and youth participants did not refer to education            as   an aspect o f
com m unity i nfl uence on fam il y l i fe: but adults ge nerated 1 4 o f I 38 i tems i n th is
category. They noted that formal classes for ch i ld ren and youth provide togetherness,
''cluldren '..: classes help cluldren to get to know other children ": that education act i v iti es
n urture spiritual ity, ''}/resides and deepening."· .,pcritualZvfeed adults ": and that there is a
need to p l an for fam i ly learning acti vities , "Baha 'i school c()uld he done a.\· a ji.lmlly
uctivity, not separated". Further discussion of the impl ications for the planni ng of
ed ucati o n activities can be found i n Chap te r 6 .

Compa ring the Responses With P revious \Vo rk in the Field

The findings of this study are consistent with the suggestion of Bronfenbrenner.

Moen. and Garbari n o     ( 1 9 84 . p. 306 ) that rel i gi ous organi zations are " particularl y sal ient "
exam ples of formal com munity structures, thereby i mp ly i ng a ro le in the well-bei ng of
c h i ldren and fami l i e s . Fi rst, t h ey argue that comm un i ty supports the fami l y by both
formal and i n formal structures. Second� these structures, they s ugges t.. should provide
di verse resources and challengi ng experiences . Th ird.. these structures sho u l d serve as
sources of stab i l i ty and support. The fi ndi ngs describe a balance i n the experience of the
participants. i nc l udi n g a c learly articulated, val ue based soc i a l structure. The fi ndings
incl ude reference to the demands and e xpectation s of com m un i ty service as wel l as the
di versity of. and opportuni ty for, experience and i nteraction. usual ly termed by the
partic i pants as service. The ti ndings provide consistent evidence that the participants
ex perience 'u pport and a se n se of be l on gi n g and purpose in the context of the Baha' i
communi ty. The descri ptions by partici pants of connections among children� pa ren ts and

set ti ngs o u ts i de th e fam i l y are consistent with the needs for access to interaction "'·i th
others: soc i a l order: and opportunity for i ndi vidual development, seen to be perti nent to
the fam i l y-co m m un i ty re lations h i p by Goodno\v ( 1 9 88). The result s suggest that the
Baha'i co m m u nity provides the type of supporti ve community-based relations h i ps
adv o c ated by Angl i n and Glossop ( I 986 ) : a net\vork that is consi stent wi th the ecological
mod e l of soc i al s upport systems and resources. From thi s po i nt of view, the Baha'i
com m unity \vo uld be \vhat Garbari no and Crouter ( 1978) desc ri b e as a po ten t prosocial

The notion of a mutually beneficial, i nteractive re lationship is underscored by this

Informal Social Support fo r Fa m i l ies

other Baha'i fam i l ies come to their house for a music evening when t hose who come play
i nstruments, l isten and sing together. This struck me as a sign i fi c an t concrete experience
for the preschool chi ld. constituting an early element in his idea of what the Baha'i
c o m munity represents. Man i festations of soc ial support surfaced in other spe c i fi c
references made by chi ldren � for i ns tan ce "pnt luck d1nners ". Adults said t ha t ''other

local elected com m uni ty counc i l , the Spiri tual Assembly, as a source of support through
g u i dance and consu ltat ion. Th is is of note because of the i m portance placed on the ro le
of the local Spiri tual Assembly i n the teachi ngs and adm i n is trati ve structure o f the Baha i           '

Describing Com m u n ity Resou rces To F u rth e r Suppo rt and Strengthen Fam ily Life

G i ven the exam ples of soc ial support generated from the first t\vo interview
questions, what suggestions would the partic i pants have for c hanges or additional
resources in the Baha'i com munity to enhance and strengthen fam i ly l i fe?

The fol lowing discussion is based upon Table 5, the rankings of the categories of
i tems by the adult and youth partic ipants in response to the t h i rd interv i e\v question. For
a   detailed accounting of the spec i fi c items v.i thin each of the catego ri es and the ir scores
see Appendi x D.

As in the analys is of the first two question s, the use o f catego ri e s was useful in
enabl i n g the i denti fication of patterns and pri ority. Of the thirty-nine total responses
generated, the three respo nses from youth addressed on ly one category to p ic : the need
for pl an ned activities for thei r age group. Th is was consistent with thei r responses to the

fi rst two questi ons, which centered on i ssues direct l y rdated to them as i ndividuals        Thi s
focus i s developmentally appropriate and thereby gi ves val idity to the results because t he
pri mary task duri n g t he teenage years i s to establ ish sel f identity.     Deve l opmental
theorists, such as Erikson ( 1 950), have explai ned that youth are i nvol ved i n antici pation
of adulthood. Young people seek leaders h i p to inspire them and test thei r ideals and try
various roles to ti nd their personal sty le. The adult partic ipants provided ideas tor the
desi gn and planning of mec hani sms to establ i sh a stable social and materi al conte xt for
fam ily l i fe . They suggest an active, m ulti-di mensional com m unity with shared val ues
and pri nci ples that guide moral standards and be h avior \vi th resources that fam i l i es can
contri bute to and draw from.

on th e part of the partic i pants that the c o mm un ity del iberately p l an for social support.

Activities for Ch ildren and Youth

The second category wi th e i ght response i te m s               was       ass oc i ated with the p l anning

A   Gathering Place

As is the case wi th most Baha'i com m un i ti es i n Canada� those in the Cowic han
Val ley gather either      in members' homes or in rented fac i l ities to observe Feasts and Ho ly
Days: to conduct educational activities : to ho ld pub l i c presentations � and for other
gatheri n gs as necessary. Yet�       as   mentioned earl ier� the Cowic han regio n is one of fe\v
locations in Canada with a Baha' i property� a res idential secondary school . I n Chapter                     6.

gathering place, and� how and fo r whom do commun i ty resources                   work and what barriers
to access exist?

Individual    G rowtb      a nd Development

Reiterating the notion of systematic p l anni ng, the adults generated five ideas
about support mechanisms to assist i ndividuals to find ro les and responsibi l i ties and to
''. . . Jevelop rndivtduu./ skrl/s and talents ": to o tTer support.. guidance and encouragement.
"

. . . to find out   what we have to offer und to connect "_ Planni ng to fac i l itate vol untary
sharing and service� was suggested to estab l i s h "more equrty            m   gro wth und development "
because, "A ll of us need to develop. not JUSt those who ure fortunate financiu/ly " .

Fa m i l y O riented Activities

Consi stt!nt with the rt!sults from the first two i nterview questions� w hi ch
suggested that the Baha'i c om m u nit prov ides a strong soci al suppo n network and

y

structure, the adults generated four res ponses reiterating the need to plan meani ngful. fun
acti vities fo r fam i l ies. and their fri ends. around the Baha'i calendar. G iven the number o f
items tound i n Tab le       3 which s ugges t th a t t he expec tat i ons and   demands of Baha' i
com mun i ty l i te are ovenvhel m i ng for some. I m ade note, somewhat humorously. of one
recommendation for "hav1ng more freq uent Buhu 'i ucttvttles ". These, one parti c i pa nt
suggested. sho u ld be, ".\,fore _ti1n uctLvrtJes to m vrt e frrend"i ".

'la rriage and Pa renting Ed uca tion

Four response items suggested the p rovi s ion of cl asses ''jiJr _vnung people 1n
prepuratton fiJr marrltlge und ufter murrtage ": classes and support for parents� marriage
retreats . Again. I heard the need to find ways to            ". . . honor the crrllcul role th ur mothers

sy st ematic , pl anned c o m m un i ty resources to enhance the strengths and addre ss t he
c hal l e n ges of Baha'i fam i l y l i fe.

Diversity and E x pa nsion

The adults made four s�i fic recommendations about the need to i ncrease the
size and diversi ty of the Baha'i c o m m unity , to ''. . . allow more divers tty and dtslnh ulwn
ofrespfJnsih ility ". This incl uded a need for        "   A fo re know ledge und understanding uhout

"Afore tnleractum wuh different cultures ji>r greater di versi ty 1n how w do things ".

Comparing t h e Responses With P revious \\'ork In The Field

The ti ndings reported in Table -I- co nfi rm that the pa rtici pa nts va l ue thei r s pi ri tua l
com m un aty as a so urce of social support. The fi ndi n gs i n T abl e 5 suggest that t h e y desi re
a more systematic approach to prov idi n g that support. How do these e xa mples o f actual
and po tent i a l support com pare \\i th l i terature on re l i gi o n . fam i l y and com m u n i ty ?

The partic i pants describe a com m unity in wh i c h individuals are aware of, and
strive to further understand� the obl i gation that they have fo r one ano th er.                 a   com m um ty
which pro v ides moral standards and ethical systems. This structural context for shared
beliefs, val ues and pri nci ples is consi stent with Crysdal e's ( 1 99 1 ) o bj ect iv e.- structural and
subjective/value based functions of religion referred to in Chapter 3 .

The findi ngs describe a v i go ro us relationship benveen re l igi on and fam i l y l i fe. i n
the Cowichan Val ley, sim i l a r to that suggested by the "Middletown, U . S.A.'' study ( Bahr
and Chadwic k,             1 9 8 5 ) in \vhich t h e pa rt ici pant s l inked rel igio us faith and devotion to
fa m i l ie s. The re s po nses in this study describe an interactive. dy nam i c, s upportive and
rec i pro ca l rel ati onship. It is this reci proc a l i n fl uence that th e methodo logy of the study
was    designed to understand.

Thomas and Henry ( 1 985) argue that the human condition is concerned with
mean i n g and re l at io ns hi ps with others� a condition which is connected with their vi e\v of
re l at i on s h i p   with de i ty . By studying the fam i ly and re l i gi o us comm unity simultaneously,
this study i nc l uded the spiritual aspects of h uman behavior and addressed the role o f
rel i gion i n the family/comm unity interface. The findings contribute t o our understand ing
of the im pact of t h e rel i gio us community as an extended fami l y and as a circle of friends
and associates. The partici pants describe an environment that nurtures meani ng,
intimacy, l ove, and concern for others. Cornwal l and Thomas ( 1 990 ) concl uded from
their wo rk with Monnon populations that the rel ation s hi ps experienced in the re l i gio us

c omm un i ty c o up led with pri m ary re lations h i ps i n the fam i l y are re spons i ble for

dev e lo p men t of person a l spiritual devotion which. i n turn, is predictive o f adult we lt              ­

bei ng. The part i c i pan ts i n this st ud y di d i ndeed, refer to this nurturi n g o f spiritual i ty .

B rigm a n   ( 1 986) i nvestigated the    i n fl uence of re l i gious bel ie fs and prac tices on
fam i l y l i fe di rectly by ask i ng fami l y l i fe pro fessionals how churches he l p to stren gthen
famil ies. He fo und the po tenti al o f churches for s trengthenin g fam i l ies to be greate r than
actual ac hievements. I have c om pared the results in Tab le 4 and Tab le 5. wh i c h show
the perceptio ns of the partic ipa n ts about actual and potential support tor fam i l ies
provided by the Baha'i community to seven characteri st i cs which Bri gman suggest s are

most etfective i n bui lding fam ily s trengt hs        .   These com parisons are found i n Tab le         6

Three aspect s of community i n fl ue nc e from Table 4, are consi ste nt wi th
Bri gman s l ist: i nformal soc ial support; the m odel ing of sp i ri t ual val ues and p ri n ci p les�

and com m unity ev e n ts   .   [ chose to associate his notion of contemporary orientation and
flexibi l ity \vtth the partici patory and consultative nature o f the Baha'i communi ty, seen in
the opportun i ti es and dem ands o f com m un ity serv ice and decis ion-maki ng. G i ven the
absence of c lergy in t he Baha'i Faith , I matc hed the role of the local S pi ritual Assembly
to B ri gman's category about coun sel ing servi ces and m inisters             .   Fam i ly l i fe ed ucatio n
programs are not spec i fical ly me ntio n ed i n the examp l es of influence, b ut education
prob'fams and activiti es for chi ldren� youth and adults are.

In    c omparing the    ideas for c h a nge or additional resources to support and
stre n gthen fam i ly l i fe found in Table 5� the topic of marriage and pa ren t i n g education
programs is inc l uded The counsel ing services and support resources suggested by
Bri gman are ec hoed i n the partici pants• articulat ion o f need for syst emati c soc ial support
and gu idance for individual growth and deve lopment. The desi re for commun ity
diversity and expansion fits Brigman's notion of a flexible and c on te mporary orie ntation                      �

and the ideas about moral education for youth and children and the provisi on of gui danc e
for i nd i v i d ua ls i s cons i stent with the app l i cat io n of spi ritual pri nc i ples to family I ife.
Fam i l y o ri ent e d activities and a support nenvork are c ategori es common to both
Brigman's I ist an d the ideas for e nh a nce m ent of co m m un i ty su pport e x p res sed by the
Baha'i part i c i pants in th is s tudy .

C o m pari n g Table 4 with Table s . s ho ws that t he partici pants i den ti fy the
co m m un i ty   as a source of i n fonnal social     s u p port and suggest the de velo p m en t of
sy ste mat i c soc ial support mechanisms.          The community is i de n ti fied as a modeling agent
for the pract i c e of val ues and pri nci ples. The partic i pants suggested p l anned activit i es
fo r the moral education o f children and yo uth � sy stemat i c g uidance and encouragement
of i n d ivi du a ls : marriage and pare n ti n g education programs� and expansion and
diversification of the community. Com m unity gatheri n gs are affirmed as a so urce of
soci al support. In pa rtic ul a r the estab l ishment of a Baha'i center, and meaningful and

fun fam i l y ac tivi ties related to the B aha' i c alen dar are s ugges te d. E ducati on as a
me cha ni sm of s upport is re ite rated i n the des i re fo r the pro v isi o n of acti vi ties for c h i l d re n
and youth and m arria ge and parenti ng e duca t i o n . Service to the comm un ity is described
as a strengthen ing aspect of the fam i l y; community i nte rfac e and is p u rs u ed in i deas about
sy ste m a ti c soc ial support and i ndividual growth and development. Final ly, the local
Spi ritual Asse mb l y , mentioned infrequent ly as a so urc e of support., is identified as the
pri mary mechanism for the systematic plann i ng of social support.

CHAPTER 6

D ISC USSIO N O F THE FIN D INGS

Th is i s an exploratory study on the community context of fam i l y 11 fe, spec1 fica l l y
exami ning the i n fl uence of th e Baha'i comm unity on Baha'i fam i ly l i fe. [ n C h apter 5 . the
results of the study were presen ted i n re lation to four res earch questions. Th i s ch apter
\vi i i prov ide a di scussion of those fi ndi ngs.

I.   Ba ha' i Fa m ily Life Involves Com plex Relationsh ips� C ndersta n d i ngs and Ski lls

The data from thi s study provide a g l i m pse i nto the nature of Baha'i fam i ly l i fe as
seen by Baha'i fam i l ies. The data i nvolve varied and com plex re lationship s \vhich
require the acquisition and appl i cation of sets of understandi ngs and ski l ls. The ti ndings
show that the characteristics of Baha'i fam i l y l i fe are associated \\i th the teac h ings and
princ i ples of the Baha' i Fai th� with the individual and col lective expectations, concerns
and di fficulties o f fam i l y members: and \vi th the Baha' i com m un i ty . Eac h o f these wi l l
b e addressed i n tum.

a.   Baha' i fa m i ly life is grounded in the values., princi p les and practices fou n d in

> the teac h i ngs of Ba h a ' u ' llah
> Th is finding d i rectly addresses the t heo l o gi ca l dimension of Baha'i family l i fe. the
relationsh ip \vith deity referred to by Thomas and Henry (         1 985 )� \Vh ich i mpacts
re lationships with others. As fol lowers of the teac hi n gs of Baha'u'llah, whose Revelation
they believe to be Divi nely i nspired � i t is i ncumbent upon Baha'is to bring the i r l ives i nto
conformity with those teachings. These are the g u i di ng ethical and moral directives upon
which individ ual and collective behavior is based. The fam ily and the co mm u n i ty

provide location and opportun i ty for the appl icati on or practice of those va l ues and
princi ples. lt is this very striving to trans late be l ief i nto behavior that constitutes a
de finable characteri stic of the Baha'i fam i l y .

Woven throughout the data generated by this study are references to Baha'i val ues
and pri nci ples. V i rt ual l y al l o f the c haracteristics of Baha'i fam i l y l i fe mentioned by the
t\\iO   y o uth participants spoke about spiritual groYvth in the fa m i l y th ro ugh prayer, study
and reflection on the Baha'i teachin gs. and behavior that is based on those teachi ngs.

While it   was   expected that the Baha'i teac hings would be associated with Baha'i
fam i l y l i fe. the responses generated across the age groupi ngs te l l us that the partici pants
act ual ly experienced the app l i cat io n o f those values and pri nciples in their fami l ies . For
example, each of the three age groups m entioned prayer as a practice of Baha'i fam il y l i fe
and re l ationships wi thin the fam ily were described       as   be i n g c haracterized by truthfu lness
and respect., com passion and em pat h y all of which are described i n the Baha'i teac h i ngs

as   virtues to be acquired and practiced.

G i ve n this context of pri nci ple and practice. we tind evi dence that these Baha'i
fam i l ies seek to create an envi ronment of love and unity through the val ui ng o f
consensus. Th is v i ew· moves away from a paternal istic o r maternal isti c view of l ove by
which one or m o re powerful individuals may assume authority and m a ke decisions for
the collective. The search for unity t h rough the practice of consultati ve dec i s i on-making,
is assoc iated in the findings "ith other characteristics of the Baha i fam i ly

'          .

b.    Ba ha' i fam i ly l i fe integrates i n d ividual and col lective needs., rights, fu nctions

The responses in Table 1 show that these Baha'i fam i l ies define a fam ily in which
indi vidual s adopt fun ct i o ns related to perc eption of needs, rather than      a   fam i l y in which
me m bers assume static roles according to age and/or gender. Indeed, this fram ing of

i ndividual function is carri ed over i nto the rel ations h i p which i n div id uals and fam i l i es
have with the comm unity a nd incl udes a consciousness of m em bersh ip in a g l oba l human
tam i ly . [t appears that i ndividuals acq u i re sen si t iv ity to d i v ers i ty and the abi l i ty to
function i n social settings according to the needs o f the moment; the requi rements of th e
si tuation : a n d individual or group d i ffe rence s and developmental stages, s i m i lar to th e
··   devel op mental   "   perspective   of t he   tam i ly ( Ba k er   .   1 990).   This i m p l ie s a c hangi ng fam i ly
dynam ic over the passage of ti me.

The adults c harac terized fam i ly l i fe as a supporti ve, respectful, consultative,
lovi ng� compas s i o n at e environment in wh ich fam i l i es have fun. c e l eb rate and honor each
other, an d create family traditions          .    They l i sted gam es , p icn i cs, reading together and      ..

other activ ities, as ways in which the ir relationships are consol idated. They identi fied the
fa m i ly s role in help i n g children to reac h their potential . They cons is te n tly referred to the

practice of c o n s ultation i n fac i l itating the free express ion and acc ept ance of i de as and
emotions, and in bringi ng about decisions on personal and fami ly issues.

The chi l dren also described the fam i ly envi ronment i n positive terms, altho ugh
they were not as forthcomi ng with exampl es about t he family doing thi ngs tog et h er                             .   The
l ack of disc losure about rel ationsh i ps by the two youth partici p an ts must be viewed in the
l i ght of the i r develop m e ntal p reocc u pation with autonomy, a focus wh i ch was
consi stently i l l ustrated in this study. They c l early view the fami ly as a l o cati on for
leadersh ip and exam p le, i m p ly i n g that fai l ure to maintai n a responsive, col laborative,
studious atmosphere would po ten t i a lly al ien ate c h i l dren and youth within fam i l ies and
from the Faith, and the reby from the comm unity.
Suc h an environment, in wh ich t he nee ds ri gh ts and functions of individuals are

eval uated and j u..xtaposed       with   the needs o f t he co l l ective fami l y unit,           within   th e
parameters and expectations of a given set of val ues and principl es would be conducive       ,

to the de ve l op m e n t of anal�1ical sk i l l s: and. at t he same ti m e � wo uld be at risk to a t ac k
of mode l s and experience o f how t o ach ieve t h i s i dea l state. Here \ve fi nd a chal lengi ng
di kmma for Baha' i fam i l ies. How, for example, woul d a Baha'i fam i l y rec on c i l e the
v iew of the mother as tirst educator of the chi ldren \vith t he establ ishment of eq ual i ty
bet \-.·een men and wome n? How does the fi rst vi e\v di ffer from discrete roles for
i n d i vi d ual family members? That i s . does it imply that the mother is the so l e educator
and/or caretaker of the c hi l dren? The resol ution is suggested by the fi ndi ngs.

In this study, we find the artic ulation of concepts, ski l l s and strategies for
organ izi ng fa m i l y l i fe which pay attention to the dive rsity of the i n d i v i d ual members o f
the fam il y. lnstead of clear c ut fam i ly roles� we fi nd reference, across t h e age groupings,
to the concept of shared duti es, functi ons and responsibi l i ties t hat are not related to
power or authority, but to the well-being of the fam i l y uni t and its constituent members .
The res ults i l l ustrate a fam i l y l i fe v.:h ic h stri ves to fac i l i tate i ndi v i d u al and coll ecti ve
gro\vth: is tlexib le and dimensional � and accepts tension and di fficu l ty as dynam ics
\vh ich are potenti al ly conduc i ve to change and evol ution. Th i s is a c o l l ecti ve and o rgan i c
vei w, consistent with the "ecological" approach ( Garbarino and Crouter�                           1 978).

Th is col l aborative approach is faci l i tated t h rough the practice of Baha'i
consultation. References to consultation� a strategy of co llective d eci s io n- m a king ,
penneate th e findi ngs. The l earn i ng and regu lar use of this strategy i n the fam i l y \vo uld
i m p l i cit l y strengthen its efficacy as the pri m ary method of decision-making used i n the
fu n cti o n i n g of the Baha'i comm un ity. The attitudes and strategies l earned in th e fam i ly
are transferable to other soc ial contexts. Thi s finding fits with the reference, fo und i n
Chapter 2, to a letter from the Uni versal House of J ustice i n whi c h they metaphorica1 Iy
describe the family-community i nterfac e              as   a   " trai ning ground" and "bui lding block" for
the devel opment of a uni fied world society.

Perhaps addressing issues of personal and social j ustice \vtthi n the context of the
pri nc i ple of unity, and through the use of consultation, \vt l l foster ne\v understandings�
i ns ights. and adaptations for those pract itioners and agencies concerned \Vt th the tam i l y .

c.   Bah a ' i family l i fe fosters critical reflection and active learning

lf Baha'i fam i ly l i te is grounded in shared val ues and pri nc i ples whic h also
constitute the basis o f at1inity around which a community, a social order, is created. lf
those shared val ues are c oncerned \Vtth col lective benetit., soci a l j ustice. and di verse.
supportive relationships. then [ am led to ask, "how are those val ues and pri nc i ples
learned and i nternal ized? .. Personal and social grovv1h and deve l opment are vari ously
referred to by the partic i pants as education and deepenin� ac hieved through refl ection.

The results describe a fam i ly environment in which there is evidence of on-go ing
reflection on Baha'i princ i ples and moral val ues. practiced through conjoint study, prayer.
and di scourse on the Baha'i teachings. ln tum.,. the chal lenge to appl y t hese princi ples to
behavior is brought to bear on i ndividuals by fami ly l i fe and by com m unity service. The
fam i ly was associated '"i t h fostering knowledge of the Baha'i h i storical paradigm. which
views Divi ne Reve latio n as progressive and related to the developmental progress and
needs of the h uman species: with the impl icit need to educate c h i ldren for kno\vledge
about, and respect for, other re l igions: and with i ndividual character development.

The adults� c hi l dren and youth groups al l artic ulated thi s process of reflection and
action in their descriptions of fami ly l i fe� and in their references to the i nteractive family­
community re lations hip. Participation in community activities and sef\l·ice to the needs
o f the community \Vere identi fied    as   opportun ities for learning and the fam i ly   was   seen to
have a role i n enco uraging its members to access community education and deepening
through participation i n c l asses, programs and/or conferences.

The Baha'i fam i l y fac i l itates personal and social tran sfo rm atio n by encouraging
c ri tical th i nki ng� acti ve learn ing., rational discourse. and reflection. [t fosters people who
respect themsel ves and others : who th i n k about themselves and about i nterre l atedness.

d.   Ba ha ' i fa m ily life is embedded in the Ba ha' i com m u nity

Regular i nteraction with the Baha'i community is a primary characteri stic o f
Baha'i family l i fe i n the Cowichan Valley. The parti c i pa nts emphatically connected
fam i ly l i fe wi th the Baha'i community, and associated complex expectati ons, demands
and emotions with that relationship. Fami ly goals are set, and dec is i ons made. in that
context. Because thi s study was designed to study the family com m unity i nterface, this i s
a significant tinding.

For adults, the Baha'i community provides support., e ncouragement, focus and
c h a l l enge . They articulated a balance bet\veen the structural context and predictab i l ity
and informal soc ial support. Their concerns emphasized res po nsi b i l i ty, accountabi l ity,
organ ization, and "shoulds". They spoke about the struggle to reconc i l e goal s and reality
and the negative i mpact of community service on time spent with the fam i ly. Th is is
understandable when \\ie recognize that they are the members who are el i gible for
e lection to Spi rit�al Assembl ies; who are most often appointed to committees and task
forces: and who are the primary source of funds for the functioning of the community.
They descri bed the community as an extended family, articulating a paradigm which
goes beyond traditi onal understandi ngs of fam i ly structure and membersh ip ( Hareven�
1 984, Eich ler. 1 9 83 ). The irony to this strong fam ily-community interface is that few
comments \Vere made about rel ationships with people outside of the Baha'i com munity.

For children� the benefits and fun of being part of a larger community of people
thro ug h regular, organized community events and through informal social interaction,

were i mportan t . Th is suggests that th e co m m uni ty provi des a s e nse of bel ongi n g and
s e c urity for chi ldren� necessary for t h e i r pri m ary developmental tasks: independence and
i nitiat i ve: and not so d i fferent from the predi ctabi l i ty and purpose su ggest ed by t h e
adults. One i n teresti n g aspect of the c h i l dren's descriptions of Baha'i         fam i ly   l i fe h ad to
do wi th the i r expressions of isolat i o n from th ei r fri e nds   .   Th ey spoke abo ut fee l i n g
"di fferent" and wi shed out loud that more of their friends were Baha'is. This is i m portant
because of the manner in w h ic h the c h i l dren framed their frustration. I found it
noteworthy that i n resol vi ng these tensions ( Christmas. etc . ), the chi ldren did not e xpress

disdai n for being part of the Baha'i com mu nity b ut ra the r e x pressed a desi re that more o f
their friends would joi n them . For these c h i ldre� the norm i s to be a Baha' i . Th i s goes
beyond a foc us on sel f and i ndicates the degree to w hi c h the Baha'i Faith is an act i ve.
dynam ic and posi ti ve factor in the i r fam i ly I i fe and their emerging sense of self

The fi ndi ngs i l l ustrate a dy n am i c soc i a l interaction at the fam i ly level both wi thi n
and outside of the requi rements and events o f a commun ity of affinity. Adults, c h i l dren
and yout h view the Baha'i comm un i ty as a s upplemen t to their fam i l y l i fe and as a
potential c:nvironment for se l f-direction and actual ization. It would serve Baha'i
commun ities wel l to consider how t hey can be accessible as a model , or as a support
mec hanism, to those outside of their Faith and how they can draw on the strengths o f
non- Baha'i i ndividuals and resources .

How Baha'i S p iritua l Assembl ies, fami ly practitioners, fami l y agencies, a nd
pol icy mak i ng bodies m i ght access and uti l ize this existing, l aten t resource nenvork wi l l

2\.   I n fl uence Between The Ba h a ' i Co m m u n ity And The Ba h a ' i Fa m i ly Is Reciproca l

Th i s st udy addresses the b roader social context of fami ly l i fe and the infl uence
\vh i c h dom i nant bel ie fs or l i fe perspecti ves have on standards of beh avior. It is not easy
to spec i fy how panicular env i ronmental fac tors in fl ue nc e pe o p le b ut the res ul ts describe

commumty of shared doctri ne and practice. Wh i l e the partic i pants described a
community st rivi n g to go beyond traditional patterns to ans\ver c urrent pro b lems . there i s
some discrepancy in experience, suggesting that for some the com m u n i ty can b e a source
of feelings of iso lation� ro l e ambiguity� lack of visib i l i ty, and c on tro l .

The Baha'i princ i p l e of t he equality of ,vomen and men, i n concert with the noti o n
that mothers are t h e tirst educators o f chi ldren, prov ides a value base to which Baha'i
fami ly mem bers could l i n k their experience. In other \\l·ords, the Baha'i teac hi ngs i nvest a
s i gn ificant worth and    vo i ce for \vomen in the atTairs of the tam i l y and community.

Yet, tor some female partic ipants , the resu lts show that the commun i ty
experience has produced fee l i ngs of i solation and exc l us i on and the deval uing of the ro le
of mothers. not un l i ke the pe rcepti on s of women in the community at l arge. Why?

I think that the res ults found in 3 categories of Table 3 offer i ns i ght to th is
question. In the responses refe rri n g to Feasts, Hol y Days and formal events, 8 responses
addressed di ffi c u l ties assoc iated \Vith bringi ng c h i l dren to Feasts. For examp le,
comments suc h as       "Feasts are stressji1f. they require chr/dren        to   sit "� "I have j(dt judged
hy how m_v children he have " and "Nohody else puches rn: so I don 't hrtng them ", coupled
with ass umptions that the respons i bi l ity tor the care of chi ldren fa l ls so le ly onto the
mother, create s a scenario i n \vhi c h mothers are pote nt i a lly iso lated from the social
i nteraction and support and the spiritual and adm inistrative content o f the Feast.

[n addition. 6 responses in the category about soc ial s upport for i ndividuals

active leadership positions i n the various com m unities in the regi o n in \vhich they reside .
Wh i l e the Canadian Baha'i community is, for the most part., comprised o f heterogeneous
groupi ngs of members, the Co\vic han Val ley has a concentrated number o f individuals
who have professio nal roles and identities which tend to be assoc iated with leadership,
authority and dom i nance. If mothers are seen to be occupied with a tradi t iona l domestic.
child rearing role, then they may also be seen to be unavai I able for community service on
appoi nted or elected groups. -t responses i n the category of items which referred to
institutions and resources spoke of l i mi tations in community roles for women .

The adult participants i n this study brought not on ly the in fl uence o f the Baha'i
Teachings and community, but also of thei r fam i l ies, cultures, races and Faiths of origin�
their education and work experience: and all of the attitudes and assumptions i nvested i n
those i n fl uences. They have gro\\n i nto adulthood a t a ti me of rapid social change and
have not experienced a larger soc ial c l i mate which has mode l ed gender equa l i ty .

A s a researc her, I a m interested i n t h i s problem and the manner i n which the
comm unity under study respon ds to it. A l dous      ( 1 983 ) argues..   whether com munities and
fami l ies react to problems th roug h c ontro l or support depends on spec i fic stances on
contemporary issues and that uncertainty about these issues contri b utes to uneasiness in

the i nterrelati ons h i p. The fi ndi ngs show a\\<areness and certainty about the pri n c i pl e o f
equal ity of men and women and about the i mportance of activi ties tor youth: and they
em phasize the suppon� rather than the contro l . function of the rel i gious comm unity. This
awareness and emphasi s. reiterated in ideas about i n itiatives and resources which would
enhance support for fami l y l i fe. provides a starti ng point for resolving " uneasi ness" and
discrepancy between word and action: pol icy and practi ce .

The Uni versal House o f J ustice described the conditions for addresss i ng these
issues in the Baha'i commun i ty in a letter to an individual (July 25� 1 985 )�

> The pri nciple of the equal ity between \vomen and men� l i ke other teac hi ngs of the
> Faith., can be effective ly and universal ly established when it is pursued in conj unction
> with al l the other aspec ts of Baha'i l i fe . Change is an evolutionary process req u i ri n g
> patience with one's sel f and others., lovi ng education and the passage of time as the
> bel i evers deepen thei r knowledge of the pri nc ipl es of the Faith� gradua l l y discard
> long-held tradi tional attitudes and progressively conform their l ives to the un i fying
teac h ings of the Cause.

This perspective is consistent with Eic hler who suggests ( 1 983, p.26 )�

> In short. then. fam i l ies are c urren tly in a process of transition that can be expected to
> continue tor anoth er generation since many of these changes at present i nvolve the

appropriate response to the situation.

Future research on this subj ect and     wi t h   the Baha'i Faith community, should pay
attention to gender discrepancies in plann i n g for the col l ection and analysi s o f data.

Youth, who are deve lopmental ly concerned wi th the establishment of sel f
identity, spoke about aspects o f comm unity l i fe which support or cor.stra i n them as
i ndividuals, and discussed the potential i mpact of i gnoring their voice and their needs.

The use of consu l tation in the fam i ly setti ng suggests a means by w h i c h women
and youth, in tact all i ndividuals, could be empowered to s hare concerns about
i n v i s i b i l i ty and j ustice. During the N i neteen Day Feasc there is opportunity for open
consultation amongst com m unity members. The use of the Feast as an i nstitutional
mec han ism is consistent \vith the concept o f un i ty \vh ich permeates the Baha'i paradigm .
[ t is the most regular and systematic comm unication l ink bet\veen the community and its
e lected governing counc i l � the local Spiritua l Assembly. Reference to this e l ected body
as a speci fic source of i n tl uence., is notab ly lac king in the res ults. So. Baha'i
comm unities m i ght pay attention to how they uti l ize their partici patory model of
governance to i n fl uence commun ity soc ial po l icy. Later in thi s c hapter. I wi l l discuss the
potential of the Spiritual Assembly to ful fi l l a support ro le for fami l ies .

The Baha'i comm unity in the Co\vic han Val ley exerts a profound i n fl uence on
fam i l y goals. aspirations and practices.    In seeki ng to understand this i n tl uence, the study
i l l ustrates an i nteractive relationsh i p \vh i c h dra\vs heavi l y upon the ti me., energy and
reso urces of individuals and fam i l ies. The expectations o f com m unity service were
variously referred to as i m portant opportun i ti es for i ndividual or tam i ly roles and as al l ­
consuming demands w h i c h can be frustrating and ovenvhe l m i ng. Clarity about the
expectations of comm unity service., and the encouragement and support for a l l fam i ly
members, and al l fami l ies, to share i n the tasks and respons ibi l iti es of the com m unity
t!nab led some partici pants to reframe the feel i ngs from "overload' to "creatrve tests : as
aspects of commitment to a com monly held faith. The findings emphasize the support
ro l e of the Baha' i com m unity. without denyi ng or i gnoring the constraints and di l emmas
i nherent in the values., princi ples and requirements of participation in and service to that
com m unity. They also suggest a need to monitor access to support in order to avoid
privi lege by age, gender� professional status or material resources.

> The p rovi si o n of soc ial suppon tor Baha'i fam i l ies is a fu nct i on of the social

po i n t is brief because the items whic h were categorized as indicators of support tor the
fami l y were derived from t h e resu lts \Vh i c h generated t he prev ious discussion on the
Baha'i fam i l y and its i nterface with the Baha'i community.

ln b ri n gi n g people together around shared spi ritual val ues and b ehavi oral norms.

the Baha' i comm unity pro v i des both a formal soc ial structure and an informal so c ia l
network. The tindings describe structural di mensions of comm unity i nfl uence such as
regular gatherings and events and, to a lesser extent., educational programs, i nstitutions
and resources., which are h i gh l y val ued by t he parti ci pants. At the same ti me. the content
and context of these responses emphasize the social nature of the benefits de ri ved trom
these events and resources. The part i c i pants in this study spoke about the benefits
derived fro m coming toget her with o ther Baha'is, whether in the ro le of friends,
confidantes. chi ld-m i nders, mentors� or behavioral models. They spoke about the
community as an environment by which they gain ac ce ss to their Baha'i peers: b y wh ich
they can structure the rhythm of thei r l i ves� and by which their spi ri tual ity, their
re l ati o n s hi p \vith deity., can be nurtured.

Which aspect takes precedence? Thi s is a moot question because, in its aski ng, it
underscores the i nteractive and rec i p rocal nature of the fam i l y c o mmun i ty interface

-

found in this study. The teac hings of Baha'u'l lah guide the rules and processes which
govern the functioning of the individual . th e fam i l y and t he co m m unity

,                       .   These fam i l ies
and i ndividuals would not necessari ly interact with each other.. except for their
c omm only held Fai th. That value based i nteraction constructs the B aha' i com m unity.

3\. The Baha ' i Com m u nity Has The Poten tial To Develop And P rovide Systematic
Suppo rt Fo r Ba ha' i Fa m il ies

The   39 item s generated i n response t o the t h i rd group interview question� deal i ng
with ideas abo ut how the com m unity could further strengthen and support fami l ies.
produced a consistent focus. A fter articulating a comm unity paradigm which prov ides a
val ue-based social network that is organized to provide di verse and c hal leng m g
experiences, the participants essenti ally said that they val ued and wanted del iberate
planning for more of the sam e . Systematic planning was fundamental to t he responses
that the adult and youth partici pants generated about how the Baha'i comm un i ty could
further strengthen and support fam i ly l i fe   .   The local Spiritual Assembly \vas identi fied as
the comm unity agent responsible to guide this syste m atic approac h .

a.   Assess ment a nd pla n n ing i s req u i red to develop strategies a n d reso u rces b y

> w h ich t h e Ba h a ' i com m u n ity cou ld p rovide systematic fa m ily support
> The res u l ts provide i nsi ghts into the c haracteri sti cs of Baha'i family l i fe and the
manner i n whic h the Baha i comm unity provides a social network to model and fac i l itate

those c haracteri sti cs. What is m issing from the findi ngs is any consistent re ference to
h uman or material resources which are proacti vely des igned and i mplemented
speci fical l y to support fami l ies . If Baha'i fam i l ies des igned support mechanisms for the
Baha i commun ity, what would they be? And, w hat are the important factors to

emphasize in planni ng for fam i l y support?

The ideas generated i n this study were deve l opmental in nature. That is, they
described "movement" in the commun ity to\vard mechanisms fo r assessment and
integration to address the apparent contradict i ons bet,veen what "is" and what "ought" for

\VOmen and youth: to "asstsf and emhrace " the "dtsadvantaged. dtsturhed. drs�Ihlec.l": and
to produce etTect!ve� systematic comm u..11ity based support for fam il ies and individual s.

The participants al so art iculated the benefits o f such a systematic approach to
''canng ". They suggest that finding ways to assi st everyone in the comm uni ty to fi nd
ro l es. responsib i l i ty and opportuniti es for service wo uld l ead to equity   m   growlh and
development and a conc urrent expansion in resources avai lable to the commun ity.

Whether i n re lation to the pl ann ing of activities for c hi ldren and youth. the
encouragement o f individuals, the model ing of mol(l l sta nci: uci s .   nr   t h� rl�v� ln p m�nt :1 nrl
prov i sion of comm un ity resources, the fi ndi ngs reflect the im portance of re� ponding           to

needs and uti l iz1 ng capac i ty. The first step in "movtng " or developing the community
\vo uld be an assessment of the needs, capacities and capabi I ities of its members . thereby
raising the awareness o f that community. That awareness would begi n the process of
remov i n g barriers which might l i m it access to comm un ity support and has the potential
to resolve discrepancies in individua l experience.

b.   Systematic s u p po rt fo r Baha ' i fa m i l ies would identify and integrate diverse

> ind ividua l and collective needs and ca pacities
> The second step to enhance community support for fam i l ies would be the
i ntegration of identi fied needs and resources in the pl anning of community events and
init iatives. This type of planning response would i ntegrate speci fic activities for c h i l dren
and youth. lt wo uld provide programs for marriage preparation. parenti ng� and fam i ly
development. It would develop and mobil ize the human and material resources
necessary to implement those i n itiatives. It would also respond to the needs. and draw
from the resources, of the community at large: those who are not Baha'is. The findings
suggest that the Baha'i comm unity should increase acquaintance and interaction with

local aboriginal cultures and other ethnic and religi ous communities_ Th is integration
\\ith the non-Baha'i community was seen as addi ng to the richness of the Baha'i
comm unity as wel l   as   provi ding di verse views of how to do things_

But the concern with social di lemmas was not l imited to cul tural diversity _ The
integration of broad social concerns and issues such as the impact o f financial , heal th and
emotional constraints \Vere also important Mechanisms by which Baha'is who are l iving
in poverty, or who are struggling with physical or emotional health issues. could access
support services within or outside of the Baha'i comm unity are not i n p lace_ What impact
would such grass roots i nterventions have on fami l ies? And. how \vould such innovative
models benetit other Baha'i communities� intbrm those who work with famil ies� and
o ffer alternatives to those who determ ine social pol icy and the al location of resources?

Another important, concrete resource for integration was the establishment of a
"Rathenng place"     where large events could be held and which would facilitate the
coming together of people of di ffering gender, age, background and interest. Shawnigan
Lake is the site of the Max\ve l l International Baha'i School . a residential secondary
school with a population of 200 students from grades         7   to 1 2 and a staff of over   75   which
operates under the auspices o f the National Spiritual Assembly o f the Baha'is of Canada ..
It has t\vo large assembly hal ls, one with a stage and faci l ities to provide meals tbr 200
people.   Why,   in spite of this faci l ity, did the participants identi fy the need for a gathering
place? Has a systematic approach been taken to the issue? Consultation between the
eight local Spiritual Assemb l ies i n the area and the school administration. about use of
the school faci l ities. paths of communication, and j urisdictional issues, has the potential
to faci l itate a mutual l y beneficial relationship.

c.   Systematic s u p port fo r Ba ha ' i fa mil ies wou ld deepen awa reness a nd

wo uld be the use of existing reso urces or the deve lopment of new ones.. to faci l itate
personal and soc ial transformation wit h i n the context of the Baha'i teachi ngs. Th is could
i nc l ude educational study programs for adul ts, known to Baha'is as deepen i ng programs:
c l asses and proj ects specifical ly desi gned for chil dren and youth: program s and activi ties
for tam ily groupi ngs or for l ike-m inded i ndividuals to pursue common i nterests: and
pub l i c programs for the com m unity at large . Both fonnal and infonnal setti ngs and
formats could be used.

These activities were identi fied in the tindings, across the age groupi ngs, as
i m portant aspects of com m un i ty suppo rt for i ndividuals and fam il ies. Educational
processes and programs were consistently use d as examples               of opportun ities for nurturi ng
spiritual deve lopment. Th is suggests that the deepeni ng of i ndividual understandi ng and
commitment in the context of a com mon ly held Fai th, a common set of val ues and
be l i efs. is a factor in strengtheni ng the fam i l y as a soc ial unit.   (n turn, because of the
reci procal nature of the fam i ly-comm unity interface, this factor i m pacts and strengthens
the social fabric of the Baha'i com m unity.

But the val ue of this process should not be li mited to Baha'i family and
comm unity acti vities. One of the d i mensions of Baha'i fam ily l i fe whi c h \Vas fo und to be
constrained by the demanding expectations of community participation was relationship
with people who are not Baha'is. The participants voiced a desire for, and systematic
planning should provide, activities to which they could i nvite the public and t heir friends.
B ut how, and by whom . would al l of these activities be mobi lized i n response to the
identi fied and expressed needs of the comm unity?

and practices. The N i ne teen day Feast, the Holy Days and observances, the Ayyam-i-Ha
cel ebrati o n. and the ann ua l e lection of a local governing counc i L are si gni ti cant focal
poi nts around which the fam i ly and comm un i ty are organized_ The design of this
partic ipatory rel igious community is such that authority is vested in el ected insti tutions.
w h i l e the power or capacity to carry out the plans of those bodies rests \vith the
com m unity. The participants. in expressing a desire for the systematic pl anni ng of soc ial
support for i ndividuals and fam i lies, recognized that the authority to direct that planning
is vested in the local Spiritual Assembly.

The findings emphasize the support, rather than the contro l , function of the Baha'i
com m un ity. The absence of a clerical order or any desi gnate d i ndividuals with authori ty
to prescri be or j udge i ndividual � fami ly or comm unity behavioral standards and
functioning could create a pol icy vacuum .         Yet. the Baha'i model produces i nstead a
ferti le po l icy environment which capita l izes on col lective dec i s ion-maki ng. The local
Spi ritual Assembly has the potential to manage the affairs of the com m unity and to
deve lop social policies based on identi fied needs. It could des i gn strategies to i m plement
social pol icy with the people who are affected by and contribute to them through
cons ultation at the nineteen day Feast. By i mproving its administrative capacities,
management of com m un i ty resources, and ab i l ity to b ui ld partnershi ps, \vithin and
outside of the Baha'i community, the local Spi ritual Assembly serves as a potent model
for how rel i gious communiti es might ful fi l l a support ro le for fam i l ies .
rn the final c hapter I will discuss the l i m itations and implications of this study and

how it informs research on the comm unity context of fam i ly l i fe .

T h e Li mita tions O f T h e Study

I chose to focus my study about the actual and potential fam i l y support role for
rel i gious comm unities on a s pec i fi c Fait h comm un i ty i n a spec i fi c geograp h i cal location.

r found   no   body o f research about Baha'i fam ily and co m m unity to draw upon. So,
altho ugh research on the fam i ly is a l arge fi e ld. I was l i m ited in the extent to \v hi ch I
could dra\v upon related work.                 The m e th odo logy which ( chose, the               group    interview,
was l i m i ted by the number of peop l e who chose to part icipate                      .   An d the diversity of age
amongst    the   pa rti c i pants was l i m ited because        no teenagers took part i n the fi rst group
i nterview session and no c h i ldren returned to take part in th e second sessi on. Because I

was i ntere sted in t he experience of the part i c i p an ts t hese l i mitations were als � i ts

s tre n gths .

Th is study in c reases the body of work in an i m portant field                 of research .    It

t he com m umty context of fam i l y l i fe. It has the pot e ntial to i m pac t the po l icy and
practice of the Baha'i c o m m un ite s in the Cowichan Val ley, throughout Canada, and
abroad.

out side of the usual c ontext of c o m m un i ty activities, I was not s urpri se d or concerned

further comm unity researc h , p h rase d    as   asses sm e nt of the needs and capacities of

of youth and chi ldren. In future studies, [ would consider specific m ethods to access the
experience and thoughts of youth and chi ldren, suc h           as   group env i ronments i n which they

The Implicat ions of The Study

The part ici pants described a fam i l y paradigm i n whi c h consultation is used to
address personal and shared i ssues: i n wh ich l ab or and reward are s h ared � and in \\ihich
there are expectations about respect� cari ng and reci procity. They described an
atm o sp h e re which fosters access to i nformati on about onesel f. others, and about soc ial
order� an atmos p h e re in which i ndiv i d ua l s are encouraged to perceive not only what " is"
feasible but w hat ough t to be feas ibl e. For them, fam i l y l i fe fosters critical t h i n k i ng
"       "

and active learn i n g. Pan i c i pants described a com m u n ity env i ronm ent in which
i nd i v iduals are concerned w\th understanding what others mean and with mak in g
themseh es    understood i n the context of s h ared norms that estab l i sh rec i p rocal
expectations. They describe an env iron ment which encourages and demands rational
disco urse, and w h i c h n urtures cri ti cal reflection leadi ng to purposeful action.

I n other words. the partici pants descri bed t he B aha' i fam i ly and the Baha'i
co m m un ity in the C ov1i c h a n Val l e y in s i m i l ar terms . The functi o n i n g of both soc ial un its
is grounded in shared val ues and princ i ples. Both provide a stable, value-based soc ial
st ructure. B o t h pro vi de access to others. and processes by whi c h the ideas of se l f and
others are heard and considered. Both the fam i ly and comm unity are sources of love                      and
cari ng. Each ho lds the po t ential to develop and o ffer concrete support for i ndiv idual s
and fami l ies through co l lective decision-making.

As I considered the fi ndi ngs of this study, the paradi gm of th e            community as an
extended fam i l y became i ncreasi ngly       useful to me. Remembering, as the Baha'i
teac h i ngs suggest� t h at Baha'is should go to the local S piritual Assembly as c hi l dren
would to a parent� the paradigm does work as a model o f extended soc ial support wh ich
i s transterab le in a time of i ncreased mobi hty and econom ic uncerta i nty. The same
com m unity structure, grounded in the same val ues and pri n ci ples , would be fo und in
va rio u s mani festations anyw h ere in the worl d. The same opportunity to contri bute to the
construction of a    given l oca l com munity would be avai lable anywhere               in the world. The
same opportunity to ti nd '' fam i l y" wo ul d exist any\vhere in t h e world. Social isolation
wo uld, theoretically, be difficult for Baha' i fami l ies to experience.

However, it is i mportant to ac knowledge the very thrust of these findings. They
i l l ustrate a family-community i nterfac e which is affected by the degree of systematic
planni ng underta k en by the l ocal governing counc i l . The capacity for and experi ence of

that pl an n i ng would be   as   varied as the l ocal ities in \vh i c h Baha'i comm un ities e x i st. We
have l e a rned that� over   1 50 years� the Ba h a' i developmental paradigm has favored
w ides pread . gl o bal dispers i o n to establ ish sma l l com munities. rather than concentrated.
l a rge com m un ities. Therefo re, the process of maturation whic h i s c;:mbedded in the
fi ndings of thi s study wou l d be local l y organ ic and respons ive rather than central ly
determi ned and i mposed. [t would c apita l ize on and learn from the sharin g o f loc a l
experience. Th i s underscores the val ue of th e shari n g of experience: and it underscores
t he val ue of this study i n c o ntrib uti ng to th at sharing.

Praxis: A F ramework Fo r Extend i ng The Fam ily

I n the I ntroduction.. I asked, "Ho w can religious commun i ties ful ti l l a support ro le
for tam i l ies? A nd., ho\v c an they remai n open to i m pact and change by the diversity of
fam i ly needs and i ndividual intl uence?"

In Chapte r 2,. I reconsidered my        practi ce experience in the 1 ight of the metaphor
used by the Universal Ho use of Justice to pi c ture the fam ily and co mm uni ty             as   tra i n i ng
grounds and b ui lding bloc ks of soc i al order. I asked� "Can ideas be found for a
framework tor human, spiritual development and soc ial action/service? Can t h i s
framework be appli ed to the        systemati c structuring o f soc i al support programs for t he
development of inst i tutions and fam i l ies      as   tra i ni ng grounds and bui lding b l oc ks?"

The findings of th i s study confirm that religious co mm uni ties can i ndeed ful fi l l a
support role for fam i l ies , in   w h i c h the i n fl uence betwee n the fami ly and c o mm un i ty can
be rec iprocal and m utually beneficial . The results also suggest a paradigm in which the
fami l y is extended by the com m uni ty context� giving access to additional human and
m ateri al resources, grounded i n common values and p ri nc i ples , whic h thereby support
and strengthen the fami l y. A sys tem at i c approach would articulate the fam i ly paradi gm

by pro v i di ng o p po rt uni t i es for i ndiv idual s and fam i l ies to be heard and to share the i r
v a lue s bel iefs a n d c on c e rn s : and e nabl i ng eval uation o f the benefits of that p rocess , and

Ideas Fo r F u rther Resea rch To Promote Com m u n ity .-\ n d Professional Lea rn i n g

Further researc h q uestions arise from the l i m i tations of t h i s study. Some have t o do
with repl icabi l i ty . Others a re co m para ti v e e x pl o ri n g wh e th er th e se fi n di n gs are a

function of i nvolvement \vith the Baha'i F ai t h , or o f i n vol ve m ent with any given
com m un i ty of shared spiri tual val ues. For e xam p l e \Ve m igh t ask. ''\Vhat wo u l d the

experie nce of Baha'i fami l ies in other local ities and/or ot he r ethno-cultural se tt i ngs be?
What would the experience o f fam il ies i n ot her Faith comm unities be? What \vo u l d the
experience of fam i l ies in o the r types o f com m unities of a ffi ni ty be? A re the findings a
function of t he soc i o-c ultural e x peri e n ce and expectations of m i ddle-c lass Canadians?"
Future studies could therefore be conducted using more exhaustive and diverse
populations.

I also wonder about ac tion research on the a ppl i c at i o n of the findi ngs, espec ially
uti l i zi n g the above frame\vork, and what the i mpact would be. Could means be de si gned
to define a nd measure that i m pact in the same region� in o t he r Baha'i settings; wi th othe r
Faith   c omm un i t i e s :   and so o n ? First, I \vould ask, how can the Baha'i S pi ri tual Asse mbly
develop and provide systematic support for Baha'i fami l ies? And, what would be the
i m pact?"

[n co nd uc t ing further research� we wo uld learn more about the nature and dynamics
of the re l at i o ns h i p bet\veen the fam Hy and Fai th com m unity and i n form our
understanding o f an important� potent source of support for fam i l ies.
