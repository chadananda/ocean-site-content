Abstract

Humanity is undergoing revolutionary change. The world is shrinking, and the
current state of politics, morals and ethics are no longer adequate as tools in which we
can successfully navigate the challenges of today. Whether it is medicine, science,
economics or psychology, every facet of civilization is affected. Like the natural world
that progresses in stages around us— examples of which include changes of season,
transitions from seeds to fruit and the caterpillar into butterfly—humanity likewise
passes through stages of development as well. From the infancy of humanity to present
times, prophecies from every culture have predicted the arrival of a long-awaited stage
of maturity. There are many indications that we are on the cusp of the most profound,
collective transition ever experienced, a change that heralds the inevitable and
promised fulfillment of these prophesies, and the ultimate unification of the planet. The
implications of these revolutionary changes, this collective transition from an age of
turbulent adolescence to the first indications of the coming age of maturity deserve
exploration. This paper investigates such implications for the future of the world, of
psychology in general, and psychotherapy in particular. It examines a recognition and
greater level of respect for the human psyche, the soul/spirit and consciousness that
this revolutionary change demands. It explores how psychotherapy will need to evolve
in order to both serve this new world and assist in its transformation. It is time for a new
and more profound worldview, one that not only appreciates the beauty inherent in
diversity, but one that honors the intrinsic spiritual nature of humanity while maintaining
an unshakeable consciousness of the power of unity.

Acknowledgments

This thesis would not have been possible without the tremendous assistance
provided by my mentor and advisor, Dr. Debashish Banerji. His patience and ability are
only exceeded by his infinite wisdom; a well with no bottom. The water from this well
stretched my understanding and guided my path without demanding a surrender of my
own creative capacity. In fact, the respect and encouragement of it was a support I
relied on throughout this process.

The writings of the prophet founder of the Bahá’í Faith, Bahá’u’lláh, together with
those of Dr. Ron Kurtz and of Sri Aurobindo—whose wisdom is a wonderful new
discovery—each and all proved themselves a great inspiration for this work.

PREFACE

The world is in travail. People are disillusioned, depressed and afraid of what the
future may bring. According to the World Health Organization, “unipolar depressive
disorders were ranked as the third leading cause of the global burden of disease in
2004 and will move into first place by 2030” (Wan, 2011).

Citing a multitude of world problems and seemingly insurmountable
challenges, there are many who fear and believe that the end of the world is at hand.
There exists an alternative perspective however, one that sees the world as undergoing
a major process of transition from adolescence to adulthood. Not only does this
alternative perspective offer answers that make sense of our collective confusion, but it
awakens a new awareness of the many signs of hope glimmering out of the present,
turbulent darkness. Albeit difficult, this transition signifies a major leap forward in the
organization and unification of the planet.

Although finding itself seduced by ongoing attempts to reduce it to a quasi-
scientific adjunct to psychiatry, psychotherapy is experiencing a Renaissance. With the
growing acceptance and exploration of transcendence and discoveries in Nonduality
consciousness, the future of psychotherapy looks bright. Never before has there been
such profound changes as witnessed today; changes that continue to lead to a
psychology that will—in the future— more fully recognize the essential spiritual nature of
homo-sapiens and the mystery of consciousness.

CHAPTER ONE
The Adolescence of Humanity
> At the beginning of this cycle of time, long ago, the Great Spirit came
> down and He made an appearance and He gathered the peoples of this
> earth together they say on an island which is now beneath the water and
> He said to the human beings, "I'm going to send you to four directions and
> over time I'm going to change you to four colors, but I'm going to give you
> some teachings and you will call these the Original Teachings and when
> you come back together with each other you will share these so that you
> can live and have peace on earth, and a great civilization will come about
> (Brown, 1986).
An Ancient Prophecy

This is an ancient Hopi prophecy told by Native spokesperson Lee Brown, a First
Nations native of Canada. Although it is a legend with slight variations depending on the
tribe, the story remains the same: that of leaving paradise, going out into a foreign world
and eventually returning to the garden wiser and kinder. According to this legend, called
the Mending of the Hoop, each race was given special gifts and talents. They were to
develop these gifts to give back to all of humanity when the hoop of life was restored
and the unity of humanity finally established. It has been a long, arduous journey of an
awakening consciousness that has reached a crescendo of crisis from every corner of
the planet and although the promised “great return” has not yet been fulfilled, the signs
of its desperate need scream louder every day.

Transition. This time of unprecedented change, weapons of mass destruction, a
suffering environment and financial insecurity is having a profound effect on the psyche
of every soul across the globe. No one is exempt from the waves of distress billowing
from every corner of the earth. Stress, anxiety and the resulting high levels of

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        2

depression are on the rise. Intimacy is suffering as communication becomes
increasingly electronic, mirroring a disconnect not only between each other but also with
nature itself. People are dealing with issues unheard of in the past as humanity enters a
new “evolutionary stage” as described by Kearl:

> According to social scientists, owing to massive urbanization, economic
> globalism, multiculturalism, rapid change in transportation and communication
> technologies, secularization, and the accelerating growth of the knowledge
> industries, the developed nations of the planet are entering a new evolutionary
> stage in the human condition--one they oxymoronically refer to as
> “postmodernism.”.…Typologizing the new kinds of people produced by this new
> kind of society has preoccupied a number of social observers. They are
> described as being increasingly individualistic, other-directed, narcissistic,
> atomistic, and unable to develop intimacy with others (Kearl, 2010).

As awareness and communications grow, every secret is exposed: tribal people
in the heart of Africa have cell phones; everyone is connected on the internet; and
“there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made
known”, according to Luke, chapter 12, of the Bible (Crossway, 2001).

The Berlin Wall’s collapse in 1989 is a prime metaphor for the walls that for
centuries protected secrets but which ultimately must crumble and fall. As such
disintegrative processes unfold, politicians, clergy, and global conglomerates cannot
avoid the glaring spotlight as their most private secrets become headlines on the
evening news. And this daily onslaught of bad news has a definite effect. Many who are
unable to cope with this onslaught of bad news disconnect and bury themselves in their
own little world, as songwriter Leonard Cohen put it so succinctly in his song,
Democracy is Coming to the USA.

> “I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean,
> I love the country but I can't stand the scene,
> And I'm neither left or right,
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013             3

> I'm just staying home tonight
> Getting lost in that hopeless little screen” (Cohen, n.d.).

The problem with this tactic is that it produces the opposite effect than the one
desired. Not only does it lead to a sense of helplessness and depression, sadly, it is the
condition of many who have given up hope of finding answers or solutions for a world
whose problems are too large and complex to manage. Instead, a growing number of
distractions demand attention, such as increasing preoccupations with sports, computer
games, habits of addiction and a preoccupation with sex. When hope dies, inventive
problem-solving and creative responses stall and apathy ensues.

There has never been a time when creative, inventive minds are needed to
discover solutions to today’s problems. Never before has there been such a dire need
for a new worldview that gives a different understanding of the process the world is
undergoing. As problems become more apparent, many assume that the world is in a
hopeless state but understanding that it is actually in an evolutionary and necessary
developmental stage casts a more hopeful light on the situation.

History demonstrates how the growth of unity has emerged in stages: from the
unity of the family to the clan, on up from the tribe and into that of a city-state and even
to the nation, the next obvious stage is the unity of the planet. This major transition the
world is presently undergoing—from a turbulent adolescent stage to maturity—difficult
as it may be, signalizes the struggle toward this unification. As in any transition, there
are obstacles to overcome.

A shrinking planet. Changes in cultural behaviors and beliefs that have
remained constant over the centuries can change in an instant as the world lurches
from one catastrophe to another. As the planet shrinks, we inevitably share life with

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           4

people who are racially or culturally different. We no longer live in isolated little pods
with people who look like us, talk like us and think like us. The choice between division,
breaking people into smaller and smaller points of agreement or an expanding unity that
is inclusive is a choice that humanity faces daily.

Martin Luther King’s refusal to be bound by exclusivity and division guided a
conflicted nation into making the right choice, a choice celebrated as a national holiday
in his name every year. Out of the darkness and confusion of these times, there are
indications that the world is learning through trial and error, the consequences of its
choices. Conflict and suffering are the outcome when actions are governed by a closed
mentality, a mentality that denies the reality of the global oneness of the human race.
The wind of unity is blowing and whatever resists its power is toppled over like a giant
oak unable to bend. The human family is converging through air travel, the Internet and
cataclysmic events. Sadly, it is often still in an atmosphere of despair and distrust:

> After thousands of centuries of slow, relatively isolated development, we are
> experiencing a forced, potentially explosive fusion of deeply ingrained, conflicting
> ideas, customs, laws, and languages. From a global perspective, we live in
> tension and diversity everywhere. That tension is killing millions and exhausting
> the world’s resources. It is a time for change. It is a time for relativists, for
> generalists, for holists, for people who love diversity, a time to find beauty in the
> whole and meanings we can all agree on (Kurtz, 1990).

Global confusion. Every conscious person today must ask themselves what the
meaning these times imply and wonder where we go from here. A rampant capitalism
and industrialization of the planet —the trademark of the age of modernity— the
remnants of colonialism that continue to enforce their social, cultural and economic
control over nations and a seductive materialism with false promises of happiness are
forces that continue to demoralize the planet.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          5

The complexity of the world’s problems is not only daunting but disequilibrating. It
has clouded and frayed our sense of direction. Sri Aurobindo, an Indian nationalist,
philosopher, and guru describes this conundrum in his book, The Ideal of Human Unity:
“Nothing is more obscure to humanity or less seized by its understanding, whether in
the power that moves it or the sense of the aim towards which it moves, than its own
communal and collective life” (Aurobindo, 1999).

The world issues cited below are examples that demonstrate the results of
systems built on disunity; systems archaic in design and indicative of the immaturity of
adolescent consciousness from which they evolved.

Global financial instability. The interconnectedness of the world financially is a
progressive sign of unity, but we have recently seen how vulnerable it is when a crisis
hits. When one country experiences a financial crisis, the whole edifice trembles and
threatens a worldwide collapse. European countries stand paralyzed and bewildered by
the economic upheavals they are now experiencing. America, once considered the
financial stability of the world, is not immune. The following quotation was written in
1938 by Shoghi Effendi, the appointed Guardian and translator of the Bahá’í Faith:

> Not even America, which until very recently prided itself on its traditional policy of
> aloofness and the self-contained character of its economy, the invulnerability of
> its institutions and the evidences of its growing prosperity and prestige, has been
> able to resist the impelling forces that have swept her into the vortex of an
> economic hurricane that now threatens to impair the basis of her own industrial
> and economic life (Effendi, 1991).

With the swelling ranks of the unemployed, the demoralization of international
markets and the destruction of the environment, it is easy to assume that the
fundamental principles underlying the very foundation upon which these systems have

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           6

been built are severely lacking. Rather than cooperation, equability of resources and
justice; competition, greed and dishonesty have ruled the marketplace. The essential
construction of an economy lacking in these principles is doomed to fail. Its failure is
built into its design. The chasm between the wealthy and the poor for example, must
lessen as these extremes have created an imbalance the world cannot sustain.

According to chaos theory, systems evolve to a higher degree of complexity until
they become unstable. Seeking equilibrium they can either jump to a higher system with
more sensitivity, bifurcate and split in two or disintegrate and fall apart. Disintegration or
further degradation of the financial system would be a huge jolt but it is exactly these
kinds of jolts that provoke new and better solutions.

Chaos theory is a helpful tool to understand the complexities and unpredictability
we face; however, it is the emergence of re-organization and creativity necessary to
meet the challenges that are the most remarkable. In the case of world finance, a shift
from ideas of scarcity and exploitation to a new worldview of cooperation and the
equitable sharing of resources is the obvious transition these tests demand.

War upon war. In March of 2003, the United States first invaded Ba’athist Iraq.

Prior to the war, the United States and England claimed that Iraq was developing
weapons of mass destruction. Based on this claim and the need to punish someone for
9/11, war was declared. Later, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, before resigning,
would apologize for providing misinformation to both the United Nations and to the
President confirming that the information given to him claiming that Iraq had weapons of
mass destruction was false. However, this did not stop the war. Critics have accused

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           7

President Bush and his administration of having ulterior motives and providing false
information to the public to pursue their invasion of a country rich with oil.

Many wars and conflicts are caused by racial, ethnic or religious intolerance but
the growing scarcity of resources such as water, viable agricultural land and fossil fuels
are bound to trigger new waves of conflict.

Environmental crises. Severe weather changes are also demanding attention
and can no longer be ignored. The growing awareness of a distressed environment
adds to the despair and sense of hopelessness of people who are cynical that their
governments can act fast enough to delay a major catastrophe, as denial is often a
strategy used by powers determined to protect their investments.

Mohamed Nasheed, the recently ousted president of the Maldives, brought
attention to the serious impact of climate change on the Maldives archipelago. It is
sinking underwater and if it continues, his children’s generation will be environmental
refugees. He appealed to world leaders at the 2009 Amsterdam Global Environmental
Change Summit, explaining to them that his beloved islands were in danger of
disappearing due to the environmental effect on the ocean.

Nasheed pleaded with the U.S., India and China to save his islands and the
world by lowering the current level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere. His plea
was to cap carbon emissions at 350 parts per million as any higher would pose a severe
risk to the environment. Both India and China asserted their right to use carbon fuels to
advance their country’s needs. They wondered why their countries should be penalized
when the U.S. has had the opportunity to develop its economy with complete disregard

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          8

of the effects of fossil fuels on the environment. This is a logical argument but
completely insane. Unless there is cooperation between all countries, including the
U.S., the fate of the Maldives is assuredly grim and merely a token of the fate awaiting
the rest of the world. The current level of CO2, measured in April 2013 at Mauna Loa
Observatory, Hawaii, is 400. Award-winning journalist Richard Harris, who has followed
this story for NPR, states "… but certainly I'm among those who think if we wanted to be
prudent about this we shouldn't have let it go over 350, so we're already into dangerous
territory. And now that we've reached 400 parts per million, we're heading deeper into
the unknown” (Harris, 2013).

Nasheed stated that his appeal might be the suicide note of his country if the
world did not listen. Sadly, it has largely been ignored. This is a powerful example of the
spell of crippling narcissism and egoism rampant in the world, a spell so powerful it has
gripped common sense by the throat and continues to extinguish the hope of a
survivable world if the right choices are ignored.

The material advantages born of industrial societies developed in the18th and19th
centuries cannot meet the demands of a world straining for a consciousness adequate
to manage the challenges of an emerging, global society. In fact, the disease of
materialism has created an alienation from nature that has ruptured the very notion of
sacredness. This sense of separation from one another and our natural connection to
the earth, fosters depression, fear and a global psyche that is fundamentally at odds
with itself.

Although there are increasing signs of positive growth, the symptoms of a
disturbed world need to be carefully considered and understood if appropriate

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            9

interventions are possible. One of the most common characteristics of adolescence is
rebellion against authority. Although this characteristic is problematic, it has been very
necessary. In earlier stages of childhood, humanity believed and obeyed authority
without question. Religions, kings and leaders, God the father; all demanded obedience
and humanity bowed the knee in forced surrender to autocratic rule. As adolescence
dawned, rebellion and revolt ripped through the fabric of every country, community and
family system. Nation building became the industry of the planet while science evolved
as the panacea to all problems. Author and physicist David Peat calls science a story in
the following quotation:

> To me science is a story. Perhaps it has more power today than other, older
> stories in that it affects so much of how we operate in our environment. Those
> other stories are much more about containing meaning within a group. Giving an
> order to behaving, to celebrating, to acknowledging spirits. But the belief in
> science as ultimate truth can result in too much confidence in our mental
> capacity, in our ability to manipulate the environment. I see danger if science isn’t
> recognized for what it is: a beautiful story of incredible creativity (Peat, 1993).

The heavy reliance on science as the ultimate truth and only way of
understanding reality has not only led us to the belief that nature is a measurable,
weigh-able commodity for our exclusive use but it has divorced us from our own
connectedness with ourselves. “One major reason we do not sense our connectedness
with all things at the deeper levels of consciousness is that our reliance on the
teachings of classical Western science has colored the way we perceive reality”
(Corbett, 2007)

Western science uses diligent disciplines and quantifiable observations to
examine the physical universe. It does not, however, recognize subjective experience
as legitimate or verifiable proof, therefore limiting its scope of investigation. Supposing

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          10

that the mind is only an emergent property of the brain— an epiphenomenon— is a
short -sighted view, as the mind is not a physical property. Buddhists have reflected on
the mind and consciousness for centuries. They have developed an understanding that
surpasses most common understanding and have a great deal of valuable information
to share with Western science. A collaboration between the two would give a greater
insight into the totality of reality, including both subjective and objective experience and
data. This process has begun.

Science has benefited humanity in a vast multitude of ways, as it is the method
for investigating material reality. However, it is but one side of the coin. The other is the
investigation of spiritual reality. Both are necessary for balance. Science without
spirituality can lead to monstrous outcomes that defy imagination. Spirituality without
science leads to superstition and conformity. This again demonstrates the need for
unity, but what does unity mean? Certainly it cannot mean uniformity as the attempts at
homogeneity experimented with in the past have all met with disastrous results.

An economy staggering from crisis to crisis, wars and conflicts abounding and a
deteriorating environment are some of the examples of a wayward world struggling in
the grips of a profound darkness. The hope is that it is the darkness just before dawn.
A Turning Point

Teetering on the edge, as we are, of extreme possibilities to choose annihilation
or rebirth, faith is needed; faith that this turning point, this chapter of cataclysmic
consequences is part of the grand scheme of things. The Hopi prophecy described in
the beginning of this chapter emphasizes the cathartic role “world shakings” perform in
creating a new level of consciousness. The inevitable result is the waking of a

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           11

slumbering world out of its ignorance. Awareness of the reality that global events are
intensifying and chaos mounting demands recognition and action. This process is taking
place at such a heightened pace, it is impossible to measure. But if we are the least bit
sensitive and aware, we can know from our own experience that a new breeze is
blowing, a spiritual revival unlike anything we have ever experienced is on the horizon.
Kurtz alluded to this shift in the following:

> We are affected by the new sciences (which gave rise to the bomb, TV and
> computers, for example) new medicines and all the new ways to live and work
> and relate that were not around thirty years ago. With the world around us
> changing so fast, it is easy to believe a change in the structure of consciousness
> is under way. Or to wonder what awaits us, if it is not. If a transformation of
> consciousness is emerging, then something incredibly new and wonderful is
> happening. It could easily be the most important happening of the last three
> centuries (Kurtz, 1990).

It is likely the most important happening ever experienced simply by the mere
fact that we have a consciousness of being one planet, one world, one humanity; a
reality that is quite a new discovery when viewed in the context of eons of history. It is
only in recent history that humanity visually saw the planet Earth from space for the first
time. This event alone testifies to the oneness of our beautiful water planet and that we
are indeed one country and subsequently, one human race.

The unity and diversity glimpsed by holy people, humanitarians and mystics of
both the past and the present have not reached critical mass, but as these concepts
continue to spread to every heart, a transformation is indeed taking place. The firm
grasps on ego and self-centeredness cannot endure if the planet is to survive.

A rocky transition. What is this sickness of self that manifests in every aspect of
a strangely disturbed world, a sickness that perplexes and concerns every person of

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        12

conscience? The hopeful answer is that similar to the stages in the growth of the
individual, humanity also evolves from one stage to the next. The Universal House of
Justice, the elected governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, wrote a document released in
1985 entitled “To the Peoples of the World.” The following paragraph from that
document is a stunning description of the transition the world is undergoing:

> The Bahá’í Faith regards the current world confusion and calamitous condition in
> human affairs as a natural phase in an organic process leading ultimately and
> irresistibly to the unification of the human race in a single social order whose
> boundaries are those of the planet. The human race, as a distinct, organic unit,
> has passed through evolutionary stages analogous to the stages of infancy and
> childhood in the lives of its individual members, and is now in the culminating
> period of its long-awaited coming of age. A candid acknowledgement that
> prejudice, war and exploitation have been the expression of immature stages in a
> vast historical process and that the human race is today experiencing the
> unavoidable tumult which marks its collective coming of age is not a reason for
> despair, but a prerequisite to undertaking the stupendous enterprise of building a
> peaceful world. That such an enterprise is possible, that the necessary
> constructive forces do exist, that unifying social structures can be erected, is the
> theme we urge you to examine (The Universal House of Justice, 1985),

Having passed through organic stages of development analogous to the
developmental stages of the individual, humanity, as described in the above quotation,
has entered a stage of adolescence in which impetuous, rebellious behavior is the
norm. Having turned away from Mother Earth and Father God —in whatever way those
wisdoms present themselves— adolescent humanity has found itself marooned on the
shores of doubt and confusion, susceptible to the next passing custom, phase or self-
appointed guru. Elsa-Brita Titchenell, author and former member of the Philosophical
Society, summarizes this developmental stage:

> The soul of humanity is adolescent and, like any adolescent, it possesses the
> characteristic powers and frailties of youth. It has passed through the initial
> phases of learning to cope with material existence on this plane of the universe
> much as the child learns to use its senses to hear, see, and to walk and talk.

Developmental Stages

Humanity's evolution has been marked by progressive stages such as family,
tribe, city-state and nation. The next and ultimate stage is world unity. Humanity in its
collective development has moved through stages that are analogous to the stages of
development in the individual. Dr. Danesh, a Canadian psychiatrist and author,
describes the three main spiritual capacities of the individual: “The three main human
capacities of knowledge, love, and will are at the very core of being human. They occur
universally and transcend gender, race, and cultural boundaries.” (Danesh, 1994).

Dr. Danesh, categorizes infancy as the stage where the power of knowledge is
limited to the instinctual level responding to outward or environmental stimuli. Love is
experienced as bonding and will by automatism. Freud described these early stages
from a more materialistic understanding; psychosexual stages such as oral, anal, phallic
and so on. This definition focuses and identifies knowledge, love and will as the primal
spiritual attributes or powers of the human spirit.

As the child develops, these three capacities are still egocentrically based. But as
early adolescence dawns, these three capacities grow as the adolescent seeks to
discover her/his own personal identity. As maturity arrives in the healthy individual, the
power to know and to love expands. Moving from the fixation on self and self-
gratification, this expansion now includes the ability to care for others. The development

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          14

of ethical principles and a need for the expression of meaning found in service to others
are examples of a growing maturity. This process of development is an ideal model to
describe the progress of civilization’s transformation from stage-to-stage.

Signs of a growing maturity. This last century was the stage of the greatest
convulsions of distress to the most remarkable advances reflective of a dual- process at
work. As every parent of an adolescent knows, there are also great positives as well as
negatives in the life of the adolescent and the same applies to the healthier aspects of
humanity. This adolescent stage exemplifies the energy, inquisitiveness, adventure and
the process of learning from experience. Signs of a growing maturity certainly cannot be
overlooked in the world today. The following is a modified list of significant historical
events indicating this growth, discovered on a website called Signs of Our Waking
Planet:

> In the 1920s, the Women’s Suffrage Amendment passed.
> The 1930s, saw significant victories won by the Labor Movement in the US.
> In 1947, Mahatma Gandhi inspired millions toward nonviolence.
> 1945 gave birth to the United Nations.
> The 1950s saw Dr. Martin Luther King head up the civil rights movement.
> 1969 saw our planet from space for the first time, proving undeniably that the
> world is one.
> In the 1970s, the Women’s Movement rose again to the spotlight.
> The 1980s saw the emergence of the Gay Rights Movement.

1989 saw the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War.

Death and Rebirth

Just as the lessons learned from adversity can foster the development of spiritual
attributes in the individual, humankind collectively can learn from its cultural and
national challenges. Social transformation requires a shift in consciousness and a
letting-go of assumptions and beliefs that are limiting for a higher level of reality;
apartheid is a prime example. The dual process at work portrays the dynamic tension
between the deaths of old systems that no longer work and the birth of new spiritual
realities dawning on the consciousness of humanity. This process is eloquently
described below by Bahá’u’lláh, prophet/founder of the Bahá’í Faith in the compilation,
Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era by J.E. Esslemont:

> But, in the world of nature, the Spring brings about not only the growth and
> awakening of new life but also the destruction and removal of the old and effete;
> for the same sun, that makes the flowers to spring and the trees to bud, causes
> also decay and disintegration of what is dead and useless; it loosens the ice and
> melts the snow of winter, and sets free the flood and the storm that cleanse and
> purify the earth. So is it also in the spiritual world. The spiritual sunshine causes
> similar commotion and change. Thus the Day of Resurrection is also the Day of
> Judgment, in which corruptions and imitations of the truth and outworn ideas and
> customs are discarded and destroyed, in which the ice and snow of prejudice
> and superstition, which accumulated during the season of winter, are melted and
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            16

> transformed, and energies long frozen and pent up are released to flood and
> renovate the world (Esselmont, 2006).

The changes taking place in the world are described as the operation of two
fundamental processes. One is disintegrative as witnessed by conflict and dissention.
The other is integrative, witnessed by the undeniably tremendous advances in equality
and human rights prevalent in many parts of the world.

The destructive process —although painful— is a cleansing action, sweeping
away old systems that are no longer useful and making way for new opportunities.
Human inspiration and innovation are born out of hardship. As each new dilemma
presents itself on the human stage, humanity is challenged to discover a solution. If this
initiative is thwarted or denied, the consequences are amplified until corrected. The
human body operates in similar fashion: if a symptom is ignored, it continues to grow
and get worse until it is taken care of. The Universal House of Justice describes this
dual process of disintegration and integration:

> Though devastating in their effects, the forces of disintegration tend to sweep
> away barriers that block humanity’s progress, opening space for the process of
> integration to draw diverse groups together and disclosing new opportunities for
> cooperation. The principle that is to infuse all facets of organized life on the
> planet is the oneness of humankind, the hallmark of the age of maturity. That
> humanity constitutes a single people is a truth that, once viewed with skepticism,
> claims widespread acceptance today. The rejection of deeply ingrained
> prejudices and a growing sense of world citizenship are among the signs of this
> heightened awareness (The Universal House of Justice, 1985).

When globalization of the planet is done unwisely, one consequence among
many is the uniformity that impinges on diverse cultures. Helped along by the
materialistic seductions portrayed by the international media, whole countries, villages
and ethnic groups are swept into a vortex of imitation that is culturally destructive: cell

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         17

phones, T-shirts, Coke and the internet are found in the deepest jungle villages of
Africa. Globalization, no matter how many barriers it overcomes, is doomed to fail
unless diversity is not only respected but also cherished and protected.
Children of the Half Light

At this time in history, we have one foot in the darkness and one in the light,
straddled between yesterday and a tomorrow filled with promise; we are the
changelings. To be alive at this time is complex and difficult, blessed and magnificent.
Understanding the significance and opportunity before us has the power to transform
hopelessness into a sense of certitude that the world is indeed evolving. It has been
said that the prophets of old claimed that they would give a thousand lives for just one
day at this time. We are at the crest of a great tidal wave that marks the shift from
adolescence to maturity, from the limitations of duality to a new consciousness of unity.

CHAPTER TWO
Emergence from Duality to Unity Consciousness
> Love is the reflection of God’s unity in the world of Duality. It constitutes
> the entire significance of creation” (Baba, 1987, 2000).

Duality

Descartes’ concept of mind/body dualism along with his mechanistic
understanding has had a significant influence on Western thought. His cogetō ergō sum,
“I think, thus I am” created a division of human consciousness between thinking and
existing. Newton’s cosmological paradigm saw the universe as a mechanical construct
with no room for consciousness, let alone spirit. This combination created a
Cartesian/Newtonian spell of secular materialism prevalent in today’s society, one that
influences science, medicine, religion and many other aspects of Western civilization.

Duality consciousness has conditioned the way we think and experience life.

The separation between the observer and the observed is an illusion that Eastern
mystics have been well aware of for centuries. “When there is a division between the
observer and the observed, there is a conflict. But when the observer is the observed
there is no control, no suppression. The self comes to an end. Duality comes to an end.
Conflict comes to an end” (Hesselink, n.d.).

Duality consciousness or ego-consciousness as it is sometimes called, is a
problem for the person when trapped in the illusion of a fragmented reality, a reality
where attachment is promoted by a dualistic society via the media and encouraged by
the values of a consumerist inclination. The struggle between polarities leads to the

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          19

desire for one and the exclusion of the other, leading to possible suffering when the
opposite of one’s preference is experienced. Desire combined with ignorance creates a
formula for suffering described in Buddhism’s Second, Noble Truth.

Duality has created a culture constricted to having to take sides; politics is a
prime example. Duality consciousness is responsible for the split between church and
state, the body and soul and it has exiled spirituality in many cases, to strange
formalities and rituals performed only on certain days such as Sunday church.

It has divided medicine, science, philosophy and the very way we view one
another. The most critical consequence has been the erosion of belief or experience
with the nature of our true selves and our relationship with the infinite. “We all have a
kind of cosmic hunger, a need to be related to all things including the infinitude of the
Universe. This is a natural by-product of consciousness” (Jordan, 1980). Psychologist
Dr. Dan Jordan is correct but sadly, the erosion of belief can short-circuit the journey
toward a connection to the underlying ineffable reality before it even begins.

Duality is a great teacher. Duality however, has been, and continues to be a
great teacher. It has taught us how the systems that evolved from this consciousness
affected nature, how the illusion of an “us and them” led to competition, greed and war.
It revealed to us a longing for a connection to our hearts where unity consciousness
awaits recognition. It taught us through hard and painful lessons the appreciation of
attributes such as compassion, love and kindness. Though duality of this world is a
reality of our existence, inherent in the human soul is the impetus for transcendence.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013      20

Nonduality is a term originally derived from the Sanskrit word Advaita which
means “not-two”. The split between the subject and object, perceiver and the perceived,
and the self and the world are the illusion spoken of by sages and wisdom traditions for
millennia. These polarities appear to be real as they are mental constructs that are
deeply ingrained and supported by cultural norms. The unitive reality that underlies
these binary dualities can be experienced however. This experience is often referred to
as a radiant, spaciousness, a connection with the true self. Sometimes it happens due
to a practice such as meditation and sometimes it happens unexpectedly. This state
was once only experienced by the spiritually adept but this is no longer true. It is
happening to more people, more frequently which has significant implications for
psychotherapy.

This new resurgence toward spirituality must be inclusive, uniting and able to
create a new worldview of the oneness of humanity otherwise what use is it? True
nonduality consciousness is the discovery of the unity underlying the cosmos and our
oneness with it. David Bohm, an American theoretical physicist, refers to it as the
“implicate order” (Bohm, 1980). If everything is interconnected, then it stands to reason
that our worldview has an influence, not only on the way we live our lives and the
choices we make, but an influence on the world around us. As the inner and outer
become one, world unity becomes a value. As identification with others grow with the
realization that there really is no “other”, care and compassion for the welfare of
humanity is a natural result.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            21

Unity however, cannot be a shallow type of monism that denies diversity. It is
diversity itself that animates and creates a unity that endures without division. Indeed, it
is this diversity that distinguishes unity from a deadening homogeneity or conformity:

> If the flowers of a garden were all of one color, the effect would be monotonous
> to the eye; but if the colors are variegated, it is most pleasing and wonderful. The
> difference in adornment of color and capacity of reflection among the flowers
> gives the garden its beauty and charm. Therefore, although we are of different
> individualities, different in ideas and of various fragrances, let us strive like
> flowers of the same divine garden to live together in harmony. Even though each
> soul has its own individual perfume and color, all are reflecting the same light, all
> contributing fragrance to the same breeze which blows through the garden, all
> continuing to grow in complete harmony and accord. Become as waves of one
> sea, trees one forest, growing in the utmost love, agreement, and unity (‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá, 1982).

In essence, duality and nonduality, are two sides of the same coin, the marriage,
the alchemical process of creation. The trap of duality consciousness is the lack of
understanding of the necessity and the unity of both, the lack of acceptance that both
polarities are part of the same whole, which the yin yang symbol portrays so elegantly.
The Lack of Reality

“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive
out hate; only love can do that.” – Martin Luther King, (King, 1977). Philosophers,
religionists and psychologists have debated the existence of evil for centuries. It is a
topic that people have struggled with forever. Carl Jung thought that evil could not be
written off as a lack of good and that instead, it was a real force to be reckoned with.
Religions vary in their interpretation of evil, but according to Bahá’í philosophy there is
no such thing as positive evil:

> … It follows from the doctrine of the unity of God that there can be no such thing
> as positive evil. There can only be one Infinite. If there were any other power in
> the universe outside of or opposed to the One, then the One would not be
> infinite. Just as darkness is but the absence or lesser degree of light, so evil is
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          22

> but the absence or lesser degree of good, the undeveloped state (Esselmont,
> 2006).

Negative qualities like fear, greed, hate or any other negative, can have power if
seen as a concrete reality that demands attention, denial, aversion or worse, attack.
Any one of them is really a description of a lack of reality or quality. For instance, hate is
a lack of love; fear/courage; greed/generosity, and so on. This understanding views evil
then as a non- reality, therefore, ending this age-old binary conflict.

Of course, it would be foolhardy to ignore danger or under-evaluate the pain
caused by life’s hardships. However, even they can promote the development of
qualities and attributes previously absent as many a severely tested, wise soul can
attest. If seen from this light, the problems of the world can be viewed as portraying the
absence of the qualities that represent maturity and yet, each one can also serve as a
demand for growth of whatever quality that situation so direly needs. If ignored, the pain
increases until it can no longer be overlooked.
A New World View

The resilience of human consciousness is forging a new and growing worldview
out of the chaos of clamoring worldviews that deny the spiritual capacity and destiny of
every soul. Just as personal trauma and heartache in the life of the individual is a
catalyst for change or a cause for despair until a change is made, humankind is facing
the same choice. Old models of power, violence and greed no longer work. Thankfully,
change and the dawning concept of unity is growing in the minds of people in every
field: quantum psychics in science, natural healing modalities that understand the body
is one, and certainly, psychology. This shift is happening in every field. Eastern religions

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           23

understand that unity is a reality and that notions of separate entities are illusion:
especially destructive is the division between the perceived self and others.

There is such a need for a new language that can describe spiritual realities, as
the current language, evolved from archaic, unconscious assumptions and from historic
worldviews no longer work. Our culture is steeped in duality and therefore, lacks a
language that describes underlying unity, infinity and/or non-duality consciousness.
Many say it is impossible as duality is intrinsic in language, but maybe the truth is that
we have yet to really develop one that does the job because non-duality consciousness
has not fully dawned. In the future, language and a world culture befitting this
evolutionary step are inevitable.

One advantage of today’s society is the personal freedom in many parts of the
world to explore new concepts and adopt worldviews that may be completely different
from those dictated by culture or upbringing. Walter Wink touches on this freedom in the
book Sacred Stories:

> What we believe is not, however, merely a matter of preference. To a far greater
> degree than we have acknowledged, it is a function of what we are allowed to
> believe by our functional worldviews. Perhaps for the first time in history, we are
> now able to step outside the worldviews that shape us and choose which we will
> believe. As this happens, the Age of Doubt may be replaced by a new Age of
> Belief, dictated not by ecclesiastical authorities, but by individuals free to make
> conscious choice (Wink, 1993).
A New Therapeutic Relationship

Forces in the world that are destructive can seem overpowering and
disheartening, but over and over, the light of consciousness finds a way to overcome
against all odds. Isn’t this the very essence of myth and fairy tales, the protagonist
discovering through hardship the right outcome and the learning that came with the

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         24

suffering? At the heart of most mystical experience is the experience of being a part of
the whole. Whether it is with source, nirvana, God or however one describes it, it is that
connection found in the inner self that is transformative. It is here where both client and
therapist can discover the deepest healing resources, if there can be an escape from
the roles traditionally accepted as the therapeutic relationship. Changing one’s
perspective from a dualistic to a non-dualistic experience means letting go of the
identifications usually associated with this therapeutic relationship. Baba Ram Dass,
formerly known as Dr. Richard Alpert, shares his thoughts in his “Advice to a
Psychotherapist”:

> Whatever the role relationships, to the extent that you are comfortable yourself in
> the place behind all of your melodrama, when you meet another being you allow
> them to be in the place behind their melodrama, because you see another being
> like yourself in her or him… You can only see a being who is being a child if,
> when you look at yourself, you see, not a psychiatrist, but a being who’s being a
> psychiatrist. Your model of being a psychiatrist or being a woman or being any
> label is entrapping, because labels are limiting,… finite, they have suffering
> connected with them. And part of the work of consciousness is to redefine your
> own being…to the point where you are, and then there’s psychiatristness and
> there’s womanness and there’s personalityness and there’s opportunityness and
> so on; these are more like phenomenal rings around your essence rather than
> who you are (Ram Dass, n.d.).

There are many pitfalls therapists must avoid, but one of the most important is
the pitfall of ego. The assumption that the therapist is the most healthy, knowing one
who has all the answers prevents the experience of communion and locks the client in
the role of being less-than, needy or sick. On the other hand, a therapist using an
exclusively non-dual approach can risk overlooking problems the client is experiencing
as reality, thereby ignoring the suffering in need of assistance. Non-duality and
psychotherapy are not at odds with each other as long as the uniqueness of the client
and their issues are not dismissed in the process. Being flexible, open and able to use

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          25

the duality of psychotherapeutic approaches while maintaining a nondual position is a
challenge:

> The different emphasis between nonduality and psychotherapy has its place.
> Nonduality tends to highlight unity and sameness, while therapy often addresses
> diverse individual situations. However, nonduality is not at odds with diversity,
> just as the trunk of a tree is not inherently separate from or at odds with its
> branches or blossoms (Kahn, n.d.).

Focusing on the positive. Rather than focusing on dysfunction and pathology
as many therapies do, Health Realization, developed by Sydney Banks, is a good
example of a therapy that focuses on the innate health and common sense of the client.
It focuses on their own ability to learn how to recognize the illusory nature of their
negative thinking. This awareness helps the client to find their inner resources of
wisdom, common sense and love, enabling them to solve their own difficulties. In this
light, it is not uncommon for problems to evaporate as stronger, healthier realizations
take their place. Therapists who themselves are jaded by a dismal worldview and
maintain a lack of faith in the client’s innate health and wisdom have lost the
fundamental basis necessary for a contract with a client that guarantees trust and
safety. Focusing on the strengths of the client, as in the example of Health Realization,
is one method of inviting the consciousness of the clients into a more non-dual view of
themselves.

This shift to a new worldview, in psychotherapy, necessitates an
understanding that the individual her/himself is one united being no matter how many
divisions different schools of psychology or science appoint to fulfill a theory. It is a
revolution of thinking, a transformation, that borrowing from the world of science, could
also be termed a paradigm shift. Below is a graph demonstrating how this paradigm

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          26

shift is transforming the way we think. On the left are some of the signs of the paradigm
the world is emerging from and on the right are the characteristics of the new paradigm.
1\. Fundamental separateness                     - Unbroken wholeness, fundamental

connectedness
2\. Absolute certitude; materialism, the         - Uncertainly, relativity, consciousness is
only matter is real                             real (dualism, monism)
3\. Exclusive, either/or logic                   - Inclusive, both/and logic
4\. Mechanical and energy models, linear         - Negentropic, co-evolving information
causality                                       models, multiple determination, non-linear

causality
5\. The mind/body split                          - Mind/body integration
6\. Reductionist explanations                    - Systems explanations
7\. External creator-authority                   - self-organization, participatory authority
8\. Simple universal laws, fluctuations          - Universal complexity, disorder
insignificant                                   significant, chaos
9\. Dominator models, society ordered            - Partnership models of society, ordered
through violence                                through family, and work association
10\. Biology is destiny                          - We create our own destinies (Kurtz,

1990).
Shift From illusion. The basis of every great spiritual principle, regardless of
what religious or spiritual source, is love and unity. Buddhism and Hinduism understand
nondualism in slightly different ways, but share with other great faith systems the belief
that a shift is needed from the egocentric mind, from the illusion of separateness to a
shift to a higher reality. A new dimension of consciousness is needed where a paradigm
shift is no longer just a scientific maxim but a transformative shift of the heart, inspiring a
new way of being in the world. As consciousness expands, more and more individuals
claim experiences with the divine or the underlying reality. It happens either through
religious or spiritual practices such as meditation, prayer or yoga, or through an internal,
mystical experience of some kind. Sometimes it is a result of experiencing hardship or

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          27

having a difficult life experience in which a new insight is gained. There is a multitude of
ways each soul is called.

In the book Flatland, Edwin Abbott uses the two-dimensional world of Flatland to
describe the social hierarchy of the period, but most significant is his description of
transcending dimensions. Abbott’s allegorical tale illustrates the difficulty of
comprehending a higher state of consciousness as his Flatland character, the Square,
discovers when he encounters a three-dimensional sphere in which he cannot
comprehend. Square has only ever experienced two dimensions: when he meets a
sphere that is three-dimensional, his reality is altered. Only after he had experienced a
higher dimension is he able to accept that other dimensions are possible:

> My Lord, your own wisdom has taught me to aspire to One even more great,

> doubtless there is One above you who combines many Spheres in One Supreme

In the sixties, Timothy Leary, Baba Ram Dass and many others purported that
psychedelics were the pathway to spiritual, Nonduality experiences. It is ironic to think
that these experiences could come in the form of a little pill, tablet, or powder, but then
again, what better way to reach a materialistic society than with a material agent? Drugs
have not gone away but are generally viewed as a crutch and not a helicopter
depositing you on the top of the mountain for the view. Instead, a growing number of
people claim to be learning through trial and error how to use their own spiritual muscles
to walk up the mountain. Whether turning to ancient practices or newer systems
(including psychotherapy), the search for meaning, connection and higher levels of

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          28

consciousness has become almost commonplace and not just a prerogative of the
spiritually adept. It demonstrates not only that people are attempting to shift from the
egocentric mind, but are now reflective enough to know that there is such a thing!
When the striving after material gains is quieted and survival is not the most dominant
preoccupation, the opportunity for inner reflection increases and the exploration of
reality is ignited.
Compassion, Love, and Kindness

Eastern philosophies and practices have established roots in the Western world,
including a new level of awareness of the need for spiritual development. Such a
blossoming change is necessary, if the transition from adolescence to adulthood is to
succeed. Characteristics of this transition are the subsequent development of
compassion, love and kindness: the golden rule of every religion. The Dalai Lama
expresses the urgency of this requirement and its impact on society in his book, A
Policy of Kindness: "Love and kindness are the very basis of society. If we lose these
feelings, society will face tremendous difficulties; the survival of humanity will be
endangered” (Dalai Lama, 2002). Eastern religious tradition teaches the concept of
unity and the illusion of separateness. Unity, however, cannot exist without diversity.
Diversity is intrinsically a part of unity and any unity that does not include it becomes
conformity instead:

> The best hope of humankind is to maintain as rich a diversity of social types as
> possible, with the expectation that each of these experiments in the human future
> will cross-fertilize with others, and thus maintain the vital diversity essential for
> indefinite survival. Competition for ascendancy in world trade, power, or military
> might are simply empty, meaningless concepts for the future. By encouraging
> diversity elsewhere, each society ensures a rich source of ideas and techniques
> for its own future (Clark, 1989).
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         29

Underlying Unity

This unity is the same one that underlies most religious or spiritual philosophies.

Mystics from all cultures claim the experience is indescribable and yet have tried for
eons to share their findings. Greek philosophers from Thales to Socrates, Plato and
beyond; these early thinkers not only dared to think outside the box but dared to share
their insights. Some were ostracized and in the case of Socrates, even murdered but
nothing can stop the human mind from inquiring.

Each philosopher described his method for acquiring knowledge or indicated
what to avoid in order to arrive at truth. Heraclitus claimed breathing and the power of
reason. Parmenides claimed high reason, and Anaxagoras tells us that through the
weakness of the sense perceptions, we cannot judge the truth. However, each is
describing the indescribable in their own way when they talk about “Being”, “Logos”, and
or “Mind”. The only way that kind of information can be obtained is through insight and
inner reflection. Their theories may seem archaic and out of date but under closer
scrutiny the essence of their truth appears to be recognizable as that same underlying
unity described by philosophers, scientists and visionaries of today:

> Despite the immense diversity of creation, we all accept that there exists in
> nature a profound underlying unity. The search for this unity provides the
> motivation for the lives of many different men--some who, like Einstein, search
> for it in general natural laws and others who, like Teilhard de Chardin, would
> trace cosmic evolution to a divine origin” (Dubos, 1990).

Unity and Diversity

Unity and diversity are not only inseparable parts of each other, but demand the
expansion of consciousness to acknowledge their inter-connectivity. The concept of
unity and diversity is not new. In addition to the Greek philosophers mentioned above, it

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           30

was honored in many diverse cultures, including numerous indigenous groups and
ancient Taoist societies. What is extraordinary about this time in history is the growing
number of people who are discovering this reality for the first time, a reality that is no
longer the purview of mystics and visionaries alone. A new worldview is being born that
is essential to overcoming the problems of today and vital to carving out a new future
where unity and diversity are not only accepted, but cherished. If a new worldview
gained popularity that honored the love of diversity so highly that racism and prejudice
can no longer find a home, the world would be transformed:

> These principles lie at the core of all the major religions and our most noble
> cultural traditions. The values of universal brotherhood, love for one's neighbor,
> and the golden rule of treating others as we ourselves would wish to be treated
> are just some of the ideals that are common to all cultures. They have fostered
> social union and amity between people for countless generations, inspired great
> works of art, and continue to underscore our highest aspirations. Today's world
> would indeed benefit from a profound affirmation of these essential spiritual
> truths (Laslow, 1989).

A worldview such as this, one that reflects this essential shift from duality to non-
duality consciousness and the love of diversity must be, if psychotherapy is to keep
stride with this shift, a prerequisite for anyone who ventures into this field. It is a
consciousness that is beginning to broaden and expand into almost every realm of
human endeavor:

> There are such people in almost every field: philosophy, science, medicine,
> theology. We are in the middle of a revolution that they are making. They are
> offering us something new—not our usual way of knowing, being and doing. It is
> a vision coming into focus, a “second language” we are still learning. The new
> paradigm does not deny the past. On the contrary, its most significant
> contribution will be to integrate past and present and to make common sense of
> the great diversity of our inherited wisdom. It is a comprehensive
> spiritual/philosophic/scientific system. It is incomplete and only just beginning to
> affect us. Wherever we’re going, we surely are not yet there. Still, the voyage has
> begun and the direction is clear enough (Kurtz, 1990).
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          31

Essential to this shift is a new orientation to spirituality and the re-discovery of the
sacred.

CHAPTER THREE
The Marriage of Mother Earth and Father God

Some traditional, mainstream psychotherapists whose training have been
influenced by Freud’s judgment of religious life as self-deceptive often fail to meet the
needs of clients who are either religious or spiritual. In that atmosphere clients daring to
share mystical or religious experiences take the risk of having their experience
diminished as a symptom of disease. There is no denying that certain clients may be
experiencing a detachment or a psychotic episode, but that type of material also needs
to be honored as mystical experiences are often mistaken as a symptom of psychosis.
Reaching for the DSM-5 (Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders) for an appropriate label needn’t be the first response. Determining what is
actually taking place is the first step. Being present and allowing its expression in a
safe, comforting environment may be all that is needed to re-frame a negative or fearful
experience into a positive one.

Although many traditional therapies have been devoid of an accepting attitude of
spirituality and religion in the past, there has been great progress lately in
understanding the importance of psycho-spiritual development and the acceptance of
spirituality as a valid aspect of the therapeutic process. Respect for the client’s belief
system is not only important for the client, but good practice for the therapist regardless
of whether the therapist is religiously or spiritually inclined. In order to have a real
respect and a sincere ability to honor the spiritual nature of the client a broader, bias
free perspective is imperative. This implies an attitude of curiosity and a willingness to

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013             33

honor the beauty in the beliefs of others. While maintaining one’s own beliefs, gaining
familiarity and respect of the mystical core of any other spiritual or religious faith helps
to unravel those unconscious judgments and biases that surreptitiously may interfere
with the therapeutic relationship.

Awareness of a lack of religious belief prevalent in a secular society is also an
equally important aspect to be mindful of. Many may have left religion behind but have
found spiritual meaning from other sources. Some may not recognize that their love for
nature for example, may be a source of spiritual sustenance. Acknowledgment of the
client’s religious or spiritual belief system, when it arises, develops empathy in the
therapeutic relationship. New and different forms of the non-traditional spirituality are
cropping up every day. Questionnaires or other methods that ask questions about the
client’s belief system are becoming popular methods of discovery in the intake process,
especially in spiritual counseling, but if there is an accepting, safe environment it is
likely that the subject will arise naturally when needed. It becomes just one more thread
in the rich and complex tapestry of the client’s experience that is available for
investigation.

Familiarity and respect of different theologies, myth and spiritual experience are
part of a lifelong learning curve that deepens tolerance and understanding, an
understanding that can expand the practice of psychotherapy to a higher level. Although
it is controversial, sometimes it is appropriate and healing to incorporate spiritual
modalities in a therapeutic session but only when initiated or agreed to by the client.
Prayer, meditation, guided imagery, forgiveness work, use and support of the client’s

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        34

religious community, helping to identify and deconstruct negative religious concepts: all
are useful when needed but training in the use of spiritual interventions is lagging
behind. Just as diversity training has become commonplace, so too must training
incorporating an appreciation of religion/spirituality and the role it plays in
psychotherapy, become commonplace.

> Although the groundswell of research as well as continued efforts to ensure
> diversity competence may prompt increased attention to religion and spirituality
> as relevant to clinical practice, at present there is no evidence to suggest
> significant curricular investment to ensure systematic and comprehensive
> education and training in this area (Shafranske, 2005).
The Loss of the Sacred

On the first day of this new millennium, Prince Charles of Wales said the
following:

> In an age of secularism I hope with all my heart that, in the new millennium, we
> will begin to rediscover a sense of the sacred in all that surrounds us, whether in
> the way we grow our crops or raise our livestock on the land that God has given
> us, whether in the way we create places for people to live in the countryside we
> have inherited, whether in the way we treat disease in our fellow human beings
> or whether in the way we educate or motivate our young people (Charles, 2000).

Secular societies have lost touch with a sense of the sacred. Losing faith in most
organized religions, people are searching for answers. As a religion ages, it can
deteriorate developing many symptoms of decay. It becomes prone to a growing
number of schisms, each sect with its own version of the truth and an inborn distrust of
other religionists outside of their group. The ecclesiastical hierarchy often warps the
essential truth that founded the religion in the first place, and their misuse of power
becomes fodder for the daily news; priests accused of sexual misconduct and mullahs
preaching hate, encouraging acts of terror are prime examples. In the meantime,

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         35

fundamentalism claims many converts as evangelism packs the house. Religions can
become so bogged down with dogma that they lose their ability to transform the human
heart. To whatever extent the essential teachings still exist, is the extent of their
remaining regenerative power.

The following is a peek into some of the major faith systems of the world. It is
only a very brief description but hopefully one that inspires therapists to continue
broadening their knowledge on behalf and in support of the multi-racial, multi-religious
backgrounds of their clients.

The Three Gates of Faith

Religion, myth and experience. Having a general knowledge of these three,
may help the therapist appreciate and understand the client’s experience while creating
an empathetic bridge; especially with clients from a culture or faith system different from
their own. For this purpose religion, myth and experience are divided below into three
separate gates. As these three gates all share aspects with each other, it’s impossible
to completely separate them but this attempt will hopefully clarify them:

> A religion is set forth as a theology, a body of ritual and personal practices, a
> form of social conduct, and a mystical core. The practices use mythic and
> symbolic structures, and the mystical core rests on numinous experiences.
> Similarly, myths can be elaborated in terms of theology, forming the basis of a
> sect or cult and reduced psychologically to numinous experiences. Again,
> numinous experiences are usually the foundation of religions with their
> theologies, symbol systems, and practices. Thus theology, symbolism, and
> numinous experience imply each other but can form independent gates of entry
> to universal spiritual understanding (Banerji, personal communication, July 23,
> 2013).
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        36

Religion, the First Gate

Monotheistic, Abrahamic religions believe in one God, and trace their
common origin to Abraham. History has proven that when a divine teacher like Moses,
Jesus, Mohammed, the Báb, and Bahá’u’lláh brings a message for humanity— a
message the Revelator claims to be a revelation direct from God— it is generally met
with opposition and persecution. Even so, the essences of these powerful teachings
survive and share some identifiable principles that unite them. The worship of one God
(no matter the title used: God Allah, or G-d), admonitions for the development of
spiritual qualities such as love, kindness, compassion (e.g. The golden rule), the
existence of life after death and belief in the human soul are just a few examples.
However, the main point in common is the shared belief by Judaism, Christianity, Islam
and Bahá’í Faith in one God, the Creator of the universe. They are all monotheistic
faiths that have sacred writings as the core authority and guide for living.

The differences primarily stem from the refusal to acknowledge each other’s
prophets. Judaism refuses to accept Jesus, Christianity accepts Moses but does not
accept Mohammed. Muslims accept the prophets of the past but do not accept
Bahá’u’lláh. Bahá’ís, however, must accept the messengers of the past if they are
faithful to the strong admonition in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh to accept all past prophets
as messengers of God.

Christians believe in sin and the downfall of Adam and Eve. It is accepted in
Islam but is not shared by the others. Islam and the Bahá’í Faith both claim that the
human is born innocent. Jews await the Messiah while Christians claim Jesus as the

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          37

Messiah. Muslims claim that Mohammed was the “seal of the prophets,” meaning none
would follow. Bahá’ís believe that there has been and always will be a continuing line of
messengers that appear approximately every 1,000 years. The term used is
“progressive revelation.”

The other main differences pertain to the rituals that have developed around the
religion and the diverse forms of practice such as communion, baptism, food laws,
prayer laws and the Sabbath. There are many layers of difference in practice and
application but the fundamental unity is the belief in God and the attempt to live a life
pleasing to God in order to move closer to Him after death. Each religion has specifics
about the immortality of the soul and its destination. Traditionally, Judaism maintains the
belief in resurrection and reincarnation. Louis Jacobs, author of The Jewish Religion: A
Companion, posits that it could be due to Islamic mysticism. However, Cabbalists claim
that reincarnation is one of the teachings of the oral Torah. Reincarnation is a common
belief in Buddhism and in some sects of Judaism, but the concepts are very different.
Judaism’s concept of an eternal soul demands that a particular soul must reincarnate.
As there is no soul in Buddhism that continues, the differences are obvious.

Non-theistic Buddhism does not believe in a god or gods. The spiritual goal of
Buddhism is to escape the repetitive cycle of life and reach a state of Nirvana, at which
point suffering no longer exists. Although most Buddhists do not believe in the existence
of God or any supernatural being, Japanese Buddhism is an exception as Buddhism is
often intertwined with the Shinto religion, which believes in numerous supernatural
entities.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         38

Buddhism is similar to other religions in that it was founded by a Revelator
Gautama Buddha, but remains different in its goals and practices. The commonality
between Buddhism and other faiths are the principles at its core. The eightfold path is
an example: 1. Right View, 2. Right Intention, 3. Right Speech, 4. Right Action, 5. Right
Livelihood, 6. Right Effort, 7. Right Mindfulness, 8. Right Concentration. They may be
expressed differently and the path to achieving them may also differ but these principles
are recognizable as worthy regardless of the spiritual path chosen. Like most faiths, it
stresses the importance of the acquisition of spiritual virtues such as compassion.
Buddhism is built on compassion and it is this compassion that desires to end suffering
by attaining Nirvana. Buddhists also believe in life after death but in very different forms.
Buddhists describe how karma effects reincarnation and the experience of different
Bardo states (or levels of being) that exist soon after death and before reincarnation
takes place.

Buddhism is now so popular in North America that making contact either by
phone or in person to different schools to gain a deeper understanding is easy to do.
Following is a very brief outline of the three major sects of Buddhism.

Theravada, which means “the teaching of the elders”, is the oldest school of
Buddhism. Their belief is that insight or enlightenment does not come gradually but all
at once and the goal is to become an arahant, meaning that no further reincarnations
are needed. Mahāyāna Buddhism’s fundamental principles are based on the possible
liberation from suffering for all beings, and finally Vajrayana Buddhism’s goal is to

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013             39

experience ultimate truth, to become a Bodhisattva, a Buddha after many
reincarnations.

All Buddhists believe in meditation as the primary tool for reaching Nirvana and
this Nirvana implies the final cessation of suffering and conflict. That said, Buddhism
places importance in this life and living it correctly in order to avoid karma that
generates future difficult reincarnations.

Polytheistic Hinduism believes in many gods but many Hindus describe these
many gods as aspects of one Supreme Being. Hinduism is often called the oldest
religion in the world. The Vedas are considered the earliest literary record and form the
bedrock of Sanatana Dharma (a Sanskrit word meaning “the eternal law”). Although
there are many sects of Hinduism, the four main sects are: Saivism, the oldest of the
four major sects that revere Shiva. Vaishnavism, the worshipers of Lord Vishnu;
Shaktism, followers of Shakti, also known as the Divine Mother; and Smartism, liberal
Hindus who accept all major deities as forms of Brahman. There are many subdivisions
of these four that also may or may not accept the Vedas as authoritative scripture.

Hinduism —with its many gods and astonishing number of philosophies, gurus,
rituals, and strong emphasis on right practice— is often and thus understandably
referred to as a way of life rather than a religion. Hinduism may be more accurately
called a collection of religious traditions. And with such a variety of ways to practice, it
has been subject to many changes, both evolutionary and from the influences of
geographical, cultural diversity. The transition in Hinduism from many gods to a

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        40

common understanding that these many gods are a reflection of the one Brahman is
one example of the organic changes over time.

The Hindu concepts of God and the soul are complex and multidimensional.

While the Divine or Absolute is generally considered timeless infinite and unknowable,
according to some belief systems, it is also a prisoner of the material world. This is one
of the many paradoxes found in Hinduism. Indeed, there exists great controversy
related to where Brahman actually exists. Some say He is in everything and others say
He is above and beyond His creation; yet others say He and the Atman in humans are
one. In some schools, Brahman refers to the essence found in all things. In other
schools, Brahman is personal, impersonal or transpersonal depending on the sect;
however, He is a central theme of almost all of the Upanishads where He is described
as the eternal principle, the omniscient, without beginning or end. These descriptions
are similar to descriptions of God in other faiths.

From the many gods in Hinduism to an angry, punishing God in the Old
Testament, to a loving, forgiving God in the New, to Allah, the All Knowing in Islam and
then to no God at all in Buddhism— presents a staggering range of belief but the unity
of them can be found in the virtues they endorse and inspire.

Myth, the Second Gate

A myth is a story and is often considered sacred. It is one that describes reality of
some sort. A study of myth and symbology is fascinating and also a very important key
for working with multi-cultural clients. Myths are a rich source of wisdom and provide an
insight into the originating culture. Most myths use metaphor, the beauty of which being

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        41

that they leave room for the creative ability of the listener. John Hatcher, author of The
Metaphorical Nature of Reality, describes the process.

> The term metaphor is often used to designate this process in general, though
> strictly speaking, the metaphor is a relatively short, implicit analogical device.
> Sometimes the term figure or the term image is also used in this general sense,
> figure denoting figure of speech or rhetorical device, and image designating
> figurative image. But whatever term one uses, and regardless of whether the
> device is a one-word metaphor or an elaborate parable, a particularly interesting
> process must occur if the device is to work effectively. The reader or listener
> must be made to think, to be a bit creative, because he must complete the final
> and most important part of the process himself. He is responsible for determining
> in what way the tenor and vehicle are similar (Hatcher, 1979-1983).

A myth travels throughout the centuries by word of mouth and in written form. It is
a currency of understanding that forms a component of religious theology, ritual and
practice. All religions use myth and symbology to convey deeper meanings of their
particular teachings. Myths are also vehicles for passing down moral and cultural
values.

Myth plays a predominant role in dreams and is used to convey symbology of the
psyche. Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung both expounded on the meaning of myth and the
role they play in the human psyche though each utilizing different interpretive keys.
Joseph Campbell, one of the world’s foremost authorities on myth, was strongly
influenced not only by Sigmund Freud but also Carl Jung’s dream work in particular. In
his book, The Power of Myth, Campbell writes: “ Myths are clues to the spiritual
potentialities of the human life.” When asked by his interviewer, Bill Moyers, “What do
you think we are looking for when we subscribe to one of these myths?” Campbell
responds, “I think we are looking for a way of experiencing the world that will open to us

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        42

the transcendent that informs it, and at the same time forms ourselves within it. That is
what people want. That is what the soul asks for” (Campbell, 1988).

Heinrich Zimmer was known for his work with myth and symbols found in Indian
art and philosophy.

> Zimmer's method was to examine religious images using their sacred
> significance as a key to their psychic transformation. His use of (Indian)
> philosophy and religious history to interpret art was at odds with traditional

> Zimmer's writings after his death. The psychiatrist Carl Jung also developed a
> long-standing relationship with Zimmer, and incidentally edited a volume of
> Zimmer's entitled Der Weg zum Selbst (The Way to the Self) (Lafontaine, 2013).

The creation of myth is a product of the human mind in an effort to understand
the universe that exists both without and within. Some of the most beautiful and
religiously significant myths are creation stories and myths that portray the integration of
the masculine and feminine; the portrayal of the marriage of the polarities within the
human psyche as well as the intertwining of the mythical father God and Mother Earth.

Mother Earth, Father God myths.

There is a multitude of creation myths from around the world that depict the
interaction between the masculine and feminine. It also represents the relationship of
the Creator (as he is called in many native cultures) and Mother Earth. The Creator God
is given the active male assignment while Mother Earth retains the role of receptive.

The idea of a higher deity or God having a male gender varies, but it appears
that the more literal the belief, the more God anthropomorphic the designation

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         43

becomes. Many religious scriptures are replete with male references to God and in
some ancient mythologies, anthropotheism is quite common as it is in many Christian
religions. This idea that God is somehow human-like or of a male/female gender
detracts from the metaphorical meaning in these myths, the marvelous story of unity
and cooperation between the yin and the yang, creating the oneness or reality. If
understood metaphorically, God and Goddess myths are rich with meaning. And yet,
the word God itself can create division and misunderstanding. It bears remembering
that any concept of God is bound to be false as it is naturally limited by human
incapacity therefore, arguments over God are pointless.

The wedding stories. The Zuni is a native tribe that lives in the Pueblo region of
New Mexico. One of their creation stories, the story of Earth Mother and Sky Father,
begins when there was nothing, but darkness. When “Áwonawilona (the Maker and
Container of All, the Creator of all, the All-father Father) solely had being” (Cushing,
1896, 2006). And after creating the Sun Father whose appearance brought light, He the
creator created the waters. The Sun Father meanwhile, created two balls from His flesh.
One became Mother Earth and the other, Father Sky. While Mother Earth and Father
Sky were together, Mother Earth conceived the first humans.

Earth Mother soon moved away from Father Sky and sank into the waters below,
but when concerned for her progeny, she re-emerged to consult with Father Sky. The
story continues with a long description of how the two cooperate together to help their
children, both humans and creatures alike.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          44

Similar wedding stories exist in other religious traditions. In Hinduism, the
Kundalini is depicted as the Divine Mother Shakti. Coiled at the base of the human
spine like a serpent, Shakti awakens and rises up through the chakras of the spine,
bringing about life and enlightenment. As she unites with Shiva, the masculine principle,
the consummation of their divine marriage produces spiritual rebirth.

This consummation, this story of the marriage of divine forces, is one told in most
cultures and has occurred throughout history. It is a story that applies to our inner
psyche and the world of duality. It describes both the process of spiritual awakening and
the resultant alchemical wedding of opposites within us. It implies the journey of
discovery each seeker must make but it also has bigger implications. It is a mythical
description of creation and the unification of polarities to achieve it.

The circle, a major symbol worldwide. Common to all ethnic groups is the
sacredness and importance of the circle. Not only is it the main format for ceremony, but
it is a way of seeing the world; tipis are round, villages were built in a circle, and the way
of thinking is nonlinear, circular. There are many examples and it is an interesting
comparison to the worship of the square in modern society: homes, furniture, books,
windows, shopping malls, fields of crops and so on, are square.

Since the beginning of recorded history, the circle has been a central symbol
culturally and spiritually. The moon, the sun, these circles were given great import. The
development of the wheel was a major turning point for humanity without which modern
locomotion and the machinery that followed, would not be possible. Science,
mathematics, astronomy and so many aspects of civilization that are taken for granted

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           45

would either not exist or be locked in a primitive stage if it were not for the circle. In
addition to these physical examples, there were deeper implications of the wheel or
circle as key symbols with spiritual significance. Some ancient civilizations believed that
their gods lived in the sky and named the constellations after them. Although other
civilizations strictly believed in the earth goddess, some early spiritual traditions
incorporated elements of both.

Early communities centered on agriculture and performed rituals to celebrate the
connection to their seasons and to the earth. The earth was often considered a
goddess— one who could either be nurturing and life-giving or destroying. Ceremonies
revolved around the seasons with many performed in circles or wheels. Remnants of
some of these ceremonies still exist today; Stonehenge and Avebury in the British Isles
are two well-known examples. In addition, stone circles have been discovered in Nabta,
Egypt and date from the 5th millennium B.C.E. Suffice it to say, the wheel or circle has
been a part of religious culture all over the world for thousands of years. Joseph
Campbell said:

> The circle on the other hand, represents totality. Everything within a circle is one
> thing, which is encircled, enframed. That would be the spatial aspect. But the
> temporal aspect of the circle is that you leave, go somewhere, and always come
> back. God is the alpha and the omega, the source and the end. The circle
> suggests immediately a completed totality, whether in time or in space
> (Campbell, 1988).

Islamists— especially Islamic artists— revere the circle because it is infinite and
represents how Allah is infinite. In Christianity, the circle represents eternity; one
example is that of the wedding ring, symbolizing the union between individuals and the
connection they have forever with Christ. In Hinduism, the word “chakra” means wheel;

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          46

It features eight spokes to mark the directions much like the Medicine Wheel of North
America and represents the circle of time, cycles of existence and the interweaving of
space and time. Buddhism also includes use of an eight-spoked wheel—each spoke
representing one of the eight tenets of Buddhist belief in addition to denoting the
eightfold path to enlightenment.

Similarly, the Celtic wheel has four quadrants representing the four directions,
the four elements, and so on. The circle is also common to Wicca and other pagan
practices. Holy sites such as the Hajj in Mecca and the Temple of the Báb in Israel are
circumambulated. Mandalas are circular and used for meditation in Buddhism. Taoism
uses the very familiar yin/yang symbol also round in shape. In the wheel of Dharma in
Buddhism, the Hindu God Shiva is depicted as dancing in a circle. There are so many
varieties of religions, customs and beliefs where the concept of the “wheel” or circle is
prominent.

As structures, labyrinths also can be found in most religious traditions and most
often take the shape of a circle; possibly the oldest examples exist at Luzzanas in
Sardinia, found in a rock carving and dating back to 2500-2000 B.C.E. Most classical
labyrinths have eleven concentric circles with a twelfth being in the center. Circles and
labyrinths of ancient times were built on principles of sacred geometry and inspired by
the intricacy of design and shape found in nature. Some were inspired by visions, as
this vision portrayed by the famous holy man, Black Elk:

> Then I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and round about
> beneath me was the whole hoop of the world. And while I stood there I saw more
> than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013       47

> manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they
> must live together like one being. And I saw that the sacred hoop of my people
> was one of many hoops that made one circle, wide as daylight and as starlight,
> and in the center grew one mighty flowering tree to shelter all the children of one
> mother and one father. And I saw that it was holy (Black Elk, 1961).

The circle was such an essential symbol that it represented the magic circle of
life, the unity of creation and of course, Mother Earth. The burial mounds of North
America were all round, as were the calendars of the Aztecs, the Hindu mandala, and
the Bindu circle of both Hinduism and Buddhism.

The Medicine Wheel Circle

Ancestors of North American native tribes believed in a great many gods and
mythical beings. The medicine wheel of the Lakota for example, currently reflects some
of this ancestral belief. Their medicine wheel places the Creator stone at its center from
which all else flows and within the wheel are other stones representing mythological
beings such as Mother Earth, Father Sun, and Grandmother Moon. The Lakota claims
that their teachings came from the White Buffalo Calf Woman while Daganawida, also
referred to as the Great Peacemaker was the founder and teacher of the
Haudenosaunee, or the Iroquois Confederacy. Just as religions from the East stemmed
from a prophet or Revelator, it is quite possible that the same process happened in the
West but they are lessor well known or remembered.

The medicine wheel of the North American tribes of the Western Plains continues
to be a very vibrant practice and is a key to understanding the indigenous spirituality or
philosophy of North America. Primarily of Lakota origin, the medicine wheel provides a
window where non-natives can gain an insight helpful in understanding native

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013              48

philosophy but also in re-connecting— in some way— with religious roots in countries of
origin, long lost and forgotten. It is a golden opportunity to shift perspectives, to venture
from the world of the square to the understanding of the circle perspective.

Although indigenous teachings differ from nation to nation, the teachings of the
medicine wheel have been adopted by many other tribes across North America and by
a growing number of non-tribal people around the world. The medicine wheel is very
appealing as it embodies the idea that divinity or sacredness is present in all things.

Symbols are multivalent not only amongst different cultures but depending on the
circumstance, they can also vary within the same religion or culture. Although examples
of medicine wheels vary amongst Native nations, they remain very powerful and
beautiful symbols manifesting the principle of unity. Having some understanding of this
point of view is not only personally enriching to therapists but of particular importance
for those who may have indigenous clients and/or who practice in North America.
Becoming familiar with the mythical roots of where one resides or works provide an
opportunity to gain insight into the spiritual philosophies of its native people and the
influences those beliefs may still exert on the culture in general.

While the medicine wheel teachings can by no means be viewed as the best or
the only truth emerging from earth religions, (whether they be from ancient or from
neopagan sources), the fact that this one in particular is derived from North America is
significant. It is significant because it co-exists in one of the most secular, materialistic
societies in the world, it is also significant because it is a portal, not only as a connection
point with the profundity of the teachings it represents but as an opportunity to

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           49

reconnect with ancient spiritual heritages left behind in countries of origin by the millions
of immigrants to this land. This may explain why so many Americans of European
descent are attracted to the medicine wheel and Native spirituality.

Description of the Medicine Wheel. Although medicine wheels differ slightly,
for the most part they consist of thirty-six stones: The Creator stone is in the center of
the circle and radiates out to create the rest of the wheel. The second stone, slightly to
the east, represents Mother Earth. Continuing clockwise is the Father Sun stone,
Grandmother Moon, followed by the four clan stones, Turtle clan (stone), Frog clan
(water), Thunderbird clan (fire) and Butterfly clan (air). The gifts of these clans are
learned and experienced by moving from one stone to the next both in life and in one’s
journey around the wheel. Each stone has great significance. The seven stones that
surround the Creator stone represent the foundation of life.

The medicine wheel is a mirror of the universe. It sets apart everything in its
place within the complete unity of the wheel. One of the great lessons of the wheel is
the understanding that everything is sacred when in its proper place; it is a matter of
relationship. A snake is a wonderful creature of nature in its right environment, but not
so sacred if found in your boot! It is a matter of understanding the relationships between
everything in creation and honoring diversity while maintaining the comprehensive
sense of the unity of all things.

The center of the wheel is the Sacred Mystery, the Creator and everything else
radiates from this point. There are four main branches or pathways with three stones
between each one forming a cross whose four limbs reach out to the outer

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          50

circumference. Each limb forms a pathway that takes the traveler on the rim of the
wheel to the Creator at the center. Their approach is from one of the four cardinal
directions. A spirit keeper, responsible for teaching the power of the cardinal direction it
represents, guards each pathway. In Native spirituality, the number four is very sacred.
The number seven is also discovered here; it is the four directions, the sky above, the
earth below, and the center of now. The organizing principle of the natural systems of
the world is read in fours: the seasons, the elements, the directions, the four stages of
life, and the four aspects of personality are just a few examples.

The Spirit Keepers. The following spirit keepers each represents one of the four
main quadrants, cardinal direction and one of the four paths of this particular wheel:
Waboose of the North, Wabun of the East, Shawnodese of the South, and
Mudjekeewis of the West. Different tribes assign different names and attributes to
these Spirit Keepers, but the description used here originates from the vision of Sun
Bear, a teacher of Chippewa descent. The following is a modified synopsis of his book,
Dancing With the Wheel: (Bear, 1991).

> Waboose, Spirit Keeper of the North, represents earth, winter, midnight, old age,
> and wisdom. Its plant is the sweet grass, the animal, white buffalo. Waboose
> represents the time when everything appears asleep, and yet the roots and
> seeds deep in the ground are performing the magic of transformation. The major
> lesson of Waboose is the giveaway.
> Wabun, Spirit Keeper of the East, represents air. The season is spring and the
> age is childhood. The Eagle is the animal that sees from great heights. The time
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013              51

> of day is dawn. This is the time of new beginnings, a time of freshness and
> creativity. The lesson of Wabun is illumination and the ability to question.
> Shawnodese, Spirit Keeper of the South, represents water. The season is
> summer and the age is adolescence. The animal is the coyote, the trickster, who
> always wonders how he trips over his own tail. Shawnodese is paradoxical, a
> time to learn the true meaning of love through trial and error. Shawnodese is the
> power of growth.
> Mudjekeewis, Spirit Keeper of the West, represents fire. The season is autumn
> and it is the age of maturity. It is during this time that the lesson of giving to the
> community of one’s talents and skills is learned. It is the harvest and the giving
> back to Mother Earth. The animal of Mudjekeewis is the grizzly bear. Just as the
> bear gets ready for the long sleep, so too is this a time for reflection and the
> understanding of one’s true purpose in life.

The medicine wheel is only complete when we learn our place in the grand
scheme of things. To do so, we must learn to honor the unity of the wheel as we journey
around it, learning from each quarter. All four gifts are an integrated part of one another.
When they are isolated, they lose balance, the wheel is disjointed and the system falls
ill.

The perception of the universe as a whole is not unique to Native Americans.

Many of the world’s mystical traditions describe a cosmos that is whole and sacred. The
beauty of this system lies in its simple yet elegant and profound portrayal of the integral
nature of the universe and the journey of spiritual discovery that the soul undertakes as
it travels around the wheel of experience.

Sun Bear’s Medicine Wheel gained through a vision (Bear, 1991).

The Numinous Experience, The Third Gate

The numinous is an English word derived from the Latin Numen. It was
popularized in the early twentieth century by the German theologian Rudolf Otto in his
book Das Heilige-(1917; translated into English as The Idea of the Holy, 1923). It is
used to describe the power or presence of a divinity. It can invoke fear and trembling, or

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013      53

a sense of compelling awe. The person experiencing it often feels that they are in
contact with an outside source. It could be God, angels, aliens or merely a voice. It
completely depends on the individual. Usually it is unexpected and not something one
can intend. It sometimes will occur in dreams or moments of insight or synchronicity.

The numinous experience is sometimes conditioned by complexes developed
from life experiences. For instance, a bad mother experience could produce a numinous
experience that represents a terrifying Kali or devouring mother image. In other words, a
numinous experience may not always be beautiful and peaceful, but regardless of how
it appears, because it is the Self that is trying to communicate, the message will be
exactly what is needed at that time for personal growth.

There is sometimes a warning that appears, a messenger that prepares the way.

Sometimes this messenger is just a passing feeling of complete and utter wellbeing or it
can come as a prophetic clue that may not be understood until the whole experience
has taken place.

Perenialist Dr. Robert Forman argues that while mystical experiences are similar at
their core, he divides religions and their numinous experiences into three categories: 1.
Transcendental nihilism (an example would be Buddhism, negative theology), 2.
Nondualism (Advaita Vedanta); and 3. Theism (Christianity and Vaishnavism). In his
book, The Innate Capacity: Mysticism, Psychology, and Philosophy, Forman describes
some of these differences:

> A constructivism emphasizes, mystical traditions are highly diverse. The first
> issue is how far they control or produce the resulting experience and whether
> they converge on a common result. To emphasize the diversity, I consider
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        54

> theistic, Advaitan and Buddhist mysticism, though I provide only rough sketches
> of some typical features. They differ in their concept of the goal, in their
> evaluation of the stages along the way, and in their practices for reaching the
> goal. As for the goal, theists do not seek to merge with Brahman, Advaitans do
> not yearn for God, and Buddhists speak merely of extinguishing the self rather
> than of yearning for or merging with anything. As for stages of the journey, when
> for example ordinary discursive thought ceases, it may be followed by a vision or
> a silent dialogue. Theism may see this as a central paradigm of the relation of the
> soul to God, while other views may treat it as a lower stage in the transforming of
> our consciousness. As for practices, theism typically moves from intense
> devotion into nonseparateness in the presence of God, while Advaita and
> Buddhism seek through meditation an awareness of the nature of being that sees
> God as at best an inadequate representation of the One (Forman, 1998).

There is a debate in religious studies between perennialism (the view that world
religions share a universal truth) and pluralism (the idea that there can be more than
one correct religion). In Dr. Banerji’s dissertation “Structure and Process”, he describes
how Sri Aurobindo’s integral consciousness of Supermind integrates this binary while
maintaining the distinctions of both. Banerji goes on to describe these two
characteristics of this integral consciousness:

1. The constituents of an integral consciousness are not merely its parts,

> assembled into an inclusive organization, but each nameable “part” is also the
> entire integral being.
2. To think an integral consciousness, one must think radical monism and radical

pluralism at the same time (Banerji, 2012b).

Banerji concludes with the following:

> Thus, there is no proper order to the process leading to Supermind. Nor is there
> a proper tradition. One may approach from any tradition, but one must have a will
> to the integral, as that which is plural, cosmically inclusive and transcendental all
> at once, without the erasure by any of any of these states. Such an apparatus
> and unthinkable experience can be an evolutionary Telos, approachable from
> any tradition as starting point (2012b).

Welcoming The Numinous. The trans-personal self is one of the main points of
departure from Freud. The subjective communication with the trans-personal allows for
the introduction of the mystical because it extends itself from the personal psyche to
universal possibilities. The psyche is no longer prisoner and from this communication
the numinous can find us.

Jung’s concept of the trans-personal self is very reminiscent of the
Atman/Brahman concept described in Hinduism: it is what is sacred. Jung views the
divine as being an experience or an internal event, rather that something outside of the
self. Jung’s preference for making God something we experience in the numinosum is
thus a valid position. Understanding that God is within was a historic breakthrough in
consciousness.

Understanding the tremendous impact formative religious experiences, good or
bad, have on the individual’s belief system is paramount. Negative religious beliefs or
experiences are often causes of deep psychological/spiritual trauma. Therapists who
have limited awareness of spirituality or religion diminish their ability to offer a safe
place for clients to access, unfold, or even discuss this aspect of their inner experience.

At the other end of the spectrum is the therapist who imposes their beliefs on
the client, believing that their own particular brand of religion or belief is the only truth
and one that the client should have. A therapy that genuinely allows the client to take
ownership of their own material and allows for the natural unfolding of spiritual, mystical,
or religious experience inherent to the client is paramount for the safety and integrity of
the therapeutic relationship.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            56

According to Hakomi Therapy, founded by Ron Kurtz, any agenda of the
therapist’s that prevents the client from accessing and exploring whatever arises in the
client organically runs counter to the principle of non-violence. Violence can be subtle
and can originate from a hidden agenda on behalf of the therapist or a trace of
superiority. Traditional psychotherapy can inadvertently breed these attitudes in the
therapist when the training received is based on the medical model. The dualistic view
of the sick patient turning to the all-knowing, superior therapist is a set-up and a
construct difficult to escape.

Regardless of the deterioration of many world religions, they continue to play a
vital part in many people’s lives. By scratching the surface of ceremony and dogma,
truth is discovered that can be nourishing and healing. The earth-based teachings are
being remembered once again in many parts of the world and form another aspect
worth consideration and finally, the numinous, the intrinsic experience of intimate
communion with the Divine, completes this trio.

Each of these paths expresses different approaches and fulfillments that need
honoring. Just as each part of the human body is unique and different but part of an
integral whole, so too is truth. The responsibility to sort truth from error lies with each
person; it can no longer be left up to clergy or any other authority. Acquiring knowledge
and appreciation for these multiple paths and the diversity they present can go a long
way in enhancing the therapeutic relationship when these subjects arise in a therapeutic
setting. By exchanging a limited or biased position for a larger and grander worldview,

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        57

especially when it comes to religion and spirituality, is a step toward one that contributes
to a more united world.

Religion, myth and experience each contain a vast array of diverse symbology,
meaning, and methods of practice. Sensitivity to this diversity grows with the art of
investigation. In this age of the growing maturity of the human race, personal
investigation of the truth is a responsibility upon the shoulders of every human being on
the planet.

CHAPTER FOUR
Implications for Psychotherapy

Something Borrowed, Something New

Psychotherapy has always existed. Cultures around the world utilize medicine
men, shamans and spiritual elders who fill the role of therapist. Shamanism is an
umbrella term under which are found many spiritual practices, the most significant being
the ability to transcend other dimensions. However, many of these practices are
drowned by a rampant modernization insensitive to the delicate balance of indigenous
cultures. Scientists and other researchers are engaged in a desperate attempt to
acquire the knowledge of the medicine people of various tribes before it is too late.
There is deep concern as many of them who are steeped in this wisdom are dying and
taking their knowledge with them without passing it on to successive generations.

> But the shamans are a dying breed. Like a bellwether species whose decline
> signals that an entire ecosystem is in peril, the dwindling number of shamans is a
> sign of the demise of their cultures. Today most shamans are elderly, members
> of the last generation to have fully learned native lore. Ethnobotanists report that,
> around the world, younger generations are rapidly losing interest in learning what
> the local shaman knows, lured away by the pulls of the modern world. In more
> and more native groups, there is no one to whom shamans can pass on their
> knowledge. "Each time a medicine man dies, it is as if a library has burned
> down," said Dr. Mark Plotkin, an ethnobotanist at Conservation International, a
> Washington-based foundation seeking to save endangered ecosystems
> (Goleman, 1991).

As of late, many fields of Western science and medicine are developing a
growing interest in shamanic belief, medicine and the practices involved.

> also described similar magico-religious practices found within the indigenous
> religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas as

> shamanism. Various historians have argued that shamanism also played a role in
> many of the pre-Christian religions of Europe, and that shamanic elements may
> have survived in popular culture right through to the Early Modern period.
> Various archaeologists and historians of religion have also suggested that
> shamanism may have been a dominant pre-religious practice for humanity during
> the Palaeolithic (Mohapatra, 2009).

Magic, ceremonial rituals, drumming and remedies derived from nature,
(including hallucinogenic substances), were, and still are, some of the tools used. The
shaman or medicine person’s ability to transcend dimensions entering supernatural
realms to gain knowledge is part of the practice.

One common view is the oneness of the mind and body. The mind/body split
does not exist in most indigenous cultures. Illnesses are often attributed to the spiritual
world of demons, gods and spirits to which the holy person or healer could
communicate. This ability to communicate with mystical beings in other dimensions is
also used to communicate with the physical world. The accounts given by Jeremy
Narby— an anthropologist and writer who spent several years living with the Ashaninca
people in the Peruvian Amazon—describe the intimate, silent language between
shamans and plants. He examined indigenous knowledge systems and the utility of a
psychoactive plant ayahuasca in gaining knowledge. Much to his amazement, these
shamans described visions of double intertwined serpents, very similar to the
description of DNA. After many experiences with shamans, which included his own
ingestion of the psychoactive ayahuasca, he came to some amazing conclusions. In an
interview with Todd Stewart of Random Media, Narby said, “Research indicates that
shamans access an intelligence, which they say is nature’s and which gives them
information that has stunning correspondences with molecular biology” (Narby, 2009).

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013       60

The secular perspective of science and psychology, has often labeled these
practices as quaint or even absurd. However, there is a new acceptance emerging as
they are increasingly explored and applied by many Western practitioners of
psychology, medicine and science. Like Narby, some of these practitioners are studying
these healers and are importing this knowledge back into their own disciplines.
Regardless of the bias of Western science and the disdain of orthodox religion, the
revival of shamanism and other ancient forms of healing are a growing trend in the West
as witnessed by the tremendous interest in this subject.

These practices were once considered as existing on the fringe or outside the
standard, but these views are changing. The emergence of Complementary and
Alternative Medicine (CAM), which refers to non-traditional therapies now commonly
used in medicine, is one example of such changing views. In fact, an increasing number
of social workers, psychotherapists and other mental health workers are incorporating
various aspects of CAM in their work. Jeffrey Barnett and Allison Shale, both from the
American Psychological Association, describe the relevance of CAM to psychologists:

> CAM is also relevant to psychologists and the care that they provide to their
> clients in the context of evidence-based practice in psychology (APA, 2005),
> described as "the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise
> in the context of patient characteristics, culture and preferences." The emphasis
> on the consideration of "patient characteristics, culture and preferences" when
> selecting treatment strategies and techniques is directly relevant to earlier
> reported data on societal trends toward health promotion, wellness and
> spirituality, as well as the data on how many Americans are now seeking out
> CAM treatments. The emphasis on "the best available research" highlights the
> need for psychologists to focus their research efforts on the many uses of CAM
> to create an expanded knowledge base about CAM, its uses and its limitations.
> The emphasis on "clinical expertise" makes clear the need for psychologists to
> develop competence regarding CAM so that it may be appropriately applied to
> meet clients' ongoing needs (Barnett & Shale, 2012).
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        61

An evolving understanding of the oneness of the mind and body, together with a
growing acceptance of cultural wisdom that has been denied access for so long, is
creating a new kind of therapy we have yet to completely envision. Carl Jung’s portrayal
of the unconscious, his ideas concerning alchemy and the theory of archetypes he
introduced to explain behaviors and personalities are all descriptive of other levels
reminiscent of the types of experiences shamans describe. Although guided imagery,
dream-work, holotropic breath-work, hypnosis and the use of mindfulness resonate with
techniques found in shamanism, the primary difference is that their foci are more
psychological and less spiritual than that which lies at the core of shamanistic practices.
And although belief systems differ, there is a growing acceptance of other realities
beyond emotion and mental processes within psychotherapy as it continues to evolve
and rediscover the wisdom of its origins.

Sacrifice of the Soul

During the 18th and 19th centuries, psychology and medicine were heavily
influenced by Freud’s theory of the psyche just as Freud was influenced by the scientific
thinking of the time. His simple understanding of the psyche as the epiphenomenon of
somatic processes contributed to a soulless philosophy, one that gathered momentum
on into the early days of Modernism. This divorce from the spirit was beneficial in one
respect: the discrimination between science and superstition led to a more
compassionate view of those suffering from psychological disorders than had been
previously considered. In the 17th century, for example, those considered insane were
chained in dungeons, and in the 18th century, patients were subjected to bloodletting,
chair spinning and all manner of devices that today would be considered torture.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          62

According to Sri Aurobindo in the Synthesis of Yoga, The work of B. F. Skinner,
Ivan Pavlov, Sigmund Freud, John Watson and other American psychologists of the
early 20th century could be classified as a “subjective science and practical psychology”
(Banerji, 2012a). The attempt to apply scientific rigor to psychotherapy, to distance
itself from ingrained religious superstition, cultural beliefs and generations of
superstition-laden mysticism was a praiseworthy ambition. However, the outright
sacrifice of the soul as an outcome was and is far too high a price to pay… No matter
how scientific or evolved a psychotherapeutic theory may appear and regardless of how
well it professes to cure— if it denies the essential, spiritual reality of the human being,
then it is a limited system.

The emerging worldview, from a cosmos made up of mechanistic parts to the
understanding of wholeness sponsored by discoveries made in quantum physics, a
holographic universe and other current theories imply a definite shift to a more holistic
point of view. In 1944, physicist Max Planck offered these astounding words:

> As a man who has devoted his whole life to… the study of matter, I can tell you
> as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All
> matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of
> an atom to vibration and holds it together. We must assume behind this force the
> existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter
> (Planck, 1944).
Early Beginnings

Known today as one of the founding figures of modern psychology, Wilhelm
Maximilian Wundt founded the first formal laboratory for psychological research at the
University of Leipzig in 1879. A psychologist, physician, physiologist, philosopher and
professor, Wundt’s research in this laboratory did much to establish the field of

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           63

psychology as a separate science from others. Following is a brief review of the work of
major Western contributors who followed, beginning with Freud. This review cannot
possibly include everyone, including many of the tremendous contributions made by
Eastern philosophies and psychology, but provides a general sense of the evolutionary
steps psychotherapy has taken.

The Evolutionary Four Forces of Psychotherapy

The following theories of psychotherapy are characterized by four major trends or
forces. They include: 1. Psychoanalysis, 2. Cognitive/behavioral, 3. Humanistic,
and 4. Transpersonal.

1st Force: Psychoanalytic therapy pioneered by Sigmund Freud describes the
mind as having three parts: the conscious, preconscious and unconscious. Of the three,
Freud’s therapy focused primarily on the preconscious (where memories are stored)
and the unconscious. It being connected to awareness less directly than the
preconscious, Freud posited that the unconscious was where urges, ideas and feelings
attached to painful or anxiety-producing material were stored. Driven by the pleasure
principle, the id strives for immediate gratification. The ego strives to satisfy the id’s
desires in realistic and socially appropriate ways. The last component of personality, the
superego holds all of the internalized moral standards and ideals that are acquired from
parents and society.

There is a great amount written obviously about Freud’s theory of personality and
vast theoretical structure beyond the scope of this piece. Suffice it to say that Freud’s
psychoanalytic system dominated the field of psychology of the twentieth century and

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            64

became the basis for a multitude of therapies that followed. Aside from his brilliant
definition of the unconscious, Freud did something so simple and yet so profound; he
listened! He listened to his patients!

> All conscious exertion is to be withheld from the capacity for attention, and one’s
> ”unconscious memory” is to be given full play; or to express it in terms of
> technique, pure and simple: one has simply to listen and not to trouble to keep in
> mind anything in particular. Failure to do this risks “never finding anything but
> what he already knows” (Freud, 1952-1974).

Although Freud’s theories have been disputed hotly over the years, probably the
two most contested are his views on penis envy (a battle cry to many feminists) and his
mind-body problem. His mechanistic understanding and belief that mental activity is
based on neurology is not a surprise given the nature of 19th century science.

Many of Freud’s students and colleagues went on to develop their own therapies.

Including Alfred Adler who pioneered new frontiers in psychotherapy. Adler maintained
that personality difficulties are rooted in feelings of inferiority and postulated a single
drive, a motivating force is behind behavior and experience. Adler’s desire to fulfill
potential is similar to the idea of self-actualization, a term used by many psychologists,
including Abraham Maslow who coined the term in the final stage of his hierarchy of
needs.

Other neo-Freudians include Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, Erick Erickson, Harry
Stack Sullivan, Clara Thompson and a host of others who agreed with Freud ‘s ideas
such as the unconscious and early childhood influences but disagreed with enough of
Freud’s concepts to motivate them to create their own theories, many of which are still
popular today.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        65

The basic tenets of psychoanalysis according to psychoanalyst and psychologist
Erich Fromm, include the following:

1. Besides the inherited constitution of personality, a person's development is

determined by events in early childhood;

2. Human behavior, experience, and cognition are largely influenced by irrational

drives;

3. Irrational drives are unconscious;

4. Attempts to bring these drives into awareness meet psychological resistance in

the form of defense mechanisms;

5. Conflicts between conscious and unconscious (repressed) material can result in

mental disturbances such as neuroses, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression, etc.;

A major shift in psychotherapy was taking place in the 19th century. New ideas
about mental illness were emerging. Works by greats like William James, American
philosopher and psychologist, emerged that set the stage for a major shift in the
concepts of psychology. James was interested in all aspects of human psychology, from
the physical to the psychical. His understanding of the full range of human possibility
had and still does have a major influence. His focus was on pragmatism and the

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          66

discovery of the usefulness of an idea rather than whether it could be proven or not;
functionalism focused on the whole and how the environment affected behavior; and the
theory of emotion developed by James and Carl Lange suggests that “emotions occur
as a result of physiological reactions to events” (Lange & James, 1922).

One of Freud’s students and associates was Carl Jung whose contributions have
had a profound effect not only on psychotherapy but also in the way we understand
ourselves and the world around us. Building on Freud’s theories, Jung described the
psyche as having three components. Within the first component—the personal
unconscious—are stored memories and drive. As the second component, the collective
unconscious not only stores one’s ideas, experiences and memories related to images
of the world but is also home to the archetypes. Jung’s definition of ego as the third
component is unique: "By ego I understand a complex of ideas which constitutes the
center of my field of consciousness and appears to possess a high degree of continuity
and identity. Hence I also speak of an ego-complex" (Jung, 1976/1990).

The Self is the core of the collective unconscious and governs the ego. This Self
is transcendental and can represent a union of opposites or a unified duality. The
integration of all of the parts of the psyche is called individuation, and Jung described
the process of individuation as a process of becoming who we truly are. The latter
phase is the transcendental function. Transcendence is the unifying of opposite
tendencies and an emergence into non-duality.

If Freud built the basement, Jung certainly built the attic when he developed the
theory of the collective unconscious and the recognition of the spiritual aspect that

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           67

drives the need for individuation. Jung’s theories made a giant leap toward the
recognition of the inherent spiritual nature of humanity, describing the human being as
having a spiritual dimension. This was a definite departure from Freud. Jung perceived
that this journey, the journey of transformation and individuation was at the mystical
heart of all religions. “It is a journey to meet the self and at the same time to meet the
Divine” (Jung: n.d.).

2nd force: Cognitive behavior therapy, grew out of two traditions, cognitive
therapy developed by Aaron Beck and Rational Emotive Therapy by Albert Ellis.
Mainstream behavior therapy challenges the client’s way of thinking and resultant
reactions. There are many varieties of this type of therapy and it is one of the most
popular in the treatment of phobias, anxiety and depression. A primary principle of
behaviorism, according to John B. Watson and others maintain that behavior can be
described scientifically. As famous for his work with rats as Pavlov is with dogs, Skinner
applied his understanding of rat behaviors to humans; many have objected to this
comparison. Skinner believed that if the environment reinforces behavior, it is
strengthened.

Behaviorism emerged in the 20th century as an opposition to the perceived
unscientific approach of psychoanalysis that did not use rigorous, experimental
methods. Behaviorism emphasized the use of laboratory experiments and observation
of behavior to predict behavior. Critics of this method argue that the therapy lacks an
appreciation for the inward aspects of consciousness in favor of outward behavioral
response. It also does not go deep enough to uncover the underlying cause, the deeper

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          68

belief systems that may be triggering thinking and behavior. Cognitive-behavioral
therapies are continually evolving and are popular. There are many branches that
evolved according to latest developments made in clinical practice and current
research. One of its benefits is its short treatment plan and thus its reduction in cost.
Cost has become a large determinant of treatment due to insurance regulations that
seek short-term therapies that have a proven track record.

The sixties and seventies saw a tremendous growth of self-help groups for
clients dissatisfied with traditional approaches. The stigma of therapy began to lessen
and become a vehicle for growth and exploration and not simply as a method for
dealing with mental or emotional illness.

3rd force: Humanistic psychology was founded by, among others, William
Glasser and Carl Rogers as a reaction to psychoanalysis and behaviorism. William
Glasser, the creator of reality and choice therapy, stressed personal choice, personal
responsibility and personal transformation as his main concepts. Glasser’s theories
have also been applied to issues such as marriage, education and other social
structures. His ten axioms of choice therapy include the following:

1. The only person whose behavior we can control is our own.

> 2. All we can give another person is information.
> 3. All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems.

4. The problem relationship is always part of our present life.
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         69

5. What happened in the past has everything to do with what we are today, but we

> can only satisfy our basic needs right now and plan to continue satisfying them in
> the future.

> 6. We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying the pictures in our Quality World.
> 7. All we do is behave.
8. All behavior is Total Behavior and is made up of four components: acting,

thinking, feeling and physiology.
9. All Total Behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and

> thinking components. We can only control our feeling and physiology indirectly
> through how we choose to act and think.
10. All Total Behavior is designated by verbs and named by the part that is the most

> recognizable (Glasser, 2010).

Glasser was not well-liked by his critics, and some claimed that “Glasser
demonizes the entire profession as charlatans who have been brainwashed by their
predecessors or who simply misrepresent many of the psychiatric illnesses to patients
as having a biological basis” (Jackson, 2003). Regardless, William Glasser was a
prolific author and his theories have had a tremendous impact both in the therapy room
and the classroom. Glasser’s focus on the choice of behavior and provision of
supportive guidance to new, healthier behaviors for the client or the student was a
complete shift away from psychoanalysis. While this therapy has proven useful,
especially in its application to education, it does not deal with deeper, core material.
That said, each therapy is an important piece of the collage and this is certainly a valid
contribution.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            70

Carl Rogers, one of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, used a
humanistic, client-centered, or person-centered therapy. His belief that the therapist
should not direct the client, that the client, (a term he used instead of patient), should be
in control. As a result, the job of the therapist/client relationship leads to insights and
change. A focus of this approach is a supportive, equal relationship between client and
therapist, rather than conforming to the rigid medical model of doctor/patient. For
Rogers, the therapist must have a genuine approach that is both humanistic and
authentic as opposed to presenting a façade. This takes a certain level of personal
development of the therapist and goes beyond technical expertise alone.

According to Rogers, self-actualization is the most fundamental drive and motive
shared by all living things, whether of a person or by a tree, and his therapy was
designed to assist clients to reach that end. Some viewed Rogers’ expectations of
people as naïve, from his clients to other therapists practicing his model. His response
was the following:

> I would not want to be misunderstood on this, I do not have a Pollyanna view of
> human nature. I am quite aware that out of defensiveness and inner fear
> individuals can and do behave in ways which are horribly destructive, immature,
> regressive, antisocial, hurtful. Yet, one of the most refreshing and invigorating
> parts of my experience is to work with such individuals and to discover the
> strongly positive directional tendencies which exist in them, as in all of us, at the
> deepest levels (Rogers, 1995).

Rogers championed the importance of a genuine, supportive and empathetic
environment in order for the person to reach their goal of self-actualization, the
fulfillment of one’s potential. Rogers was the first in the field of therapy to focus so

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           71

deeply on the reality of human potential and he did much to acknowledge the
importance of a therapeutic relationship built on equality.

4th Force: Transpersonal psychology has many different approaches. One of
its important characteristics is the inclusion of other cultural points of view and
traditional knowledge. Psychotherapist and author Marianna Caplan conveys the
history, and aims of transpersonal psychotherapy well:

> Although transpersonal psychology is relatively new as a formal discipline,
> beginning with the publication of The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology in
> 1969 and the founding of the Association for Transpersonal Psychology in 1971,
> it draws upon ancient mystical knowledge that comes from multiple traditions.
> Transpersonal psychologists attempt to integrate timeless wisdom with modern
> Western psychology and translate spiritual principles into scientifically grounded,
> contemporary language. Transpersonal psychology addresses the full spectrum
> of human psychospiritual development - from our deepest wounds and needs, to
> the existential crisis of the human being, to the most transcendent capacities of
> our consciousness (Caplan, 2009).

Maslow’s Basic Principles

Abraham Maslow, is best known for his hierarchy of needs:

(J. Finklestein,n.d.)
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         72

The bottom four needs are considered deficiency needs while the top-level needs
are psychological, related to growth. Unless the lower levels are taken care of, the
higher ones cannot be attained properly.

Maslow understood the spiritual capacity of human beings to attain peak or
transcendent experiences. He believed that personal growth, integration, and self-
actualization could be achieved by studying these experiences. These important
experiences can also be called intuitive, spiritual and numinous. Maslow challenged
older theories of psychology with his underlying theory that people are basically good
and once their lower biological needs were met, the ability to naturally and organically
achieve self-actualization was possible. Additionally, Maslow asserted that self-
actualization evolved from his scientific research of healthy and successful individuals to
discover the attributes of a self-actualized person. His idea of self-actualization
determined that a person had achieved this level of development once the basic needs
of safety/security, love/belonging, and self-esteem were accomplished. Maslow’s
theories were based on the following principles:

> The normal personality is characterized by unity, integration, consistency, and
> coherence. Organization is the natural state, and disorganization is pathological.
> The organism can be analyzed by differentiating its parts, but no part can be
> studied in isolation. The whole functions according to laws that cannot be found
> in the parts.
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         73

> The organism has one sovereign drive, that of self-actualization. People strive
> continuously to realize their inherent potential by whatever avenues are open to
> them.
> The influence of the external environment on normal development is minimal.
> The organism's potential, if allowed to unfold by an appropriate environment, will
> produce a healthy, integrated personality.
> The comprehensive study of one person is more useful than the extensive
> investigation in many people of an isolated psychological function.
> The salvation of the human being is not to be found in either behaviorism or in
> psychoanalysis as they deal only with the darker, meaner half of the individual.
> We must deal with the questions of value, individuality, consciousness, purpose,
> ethics and the higher reaches of human nature.
> Man is basically good, not evil.
> Psychopathology generally results from the denial, frustration or twisting of our
> essential nature.
> Therapy of any sort is a means of restoring a person to the path of self-
> actualization and development along the lines dictated by their inner nature.
> When the four basic needs have been satisfied, the growth need or self-
> actualization need arises: a new discontent and restlessness will develop unless
> the individual is doing what he individually is fitted for. A musician must make
> music, an artist must paint, a poet must write—in short, what people can be, they
> must be (Maslow, 1954).
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          74

The field of psychotherapy has been so enriched by great, gifted minds whose
contributions have pulled back the curtain to not only the components of the psyche, but
to the emerging wholeness and universality possible in the human being. Maslow
describes his hierarchy of needs and the expansion of self as the outcome if the needs
are completed or fulfilled. He also described how peak experiences and self-
actualization are rare experiences. He defines peak experiences as a blissful, joyous,
transpersonal and ecstatic state of being.

Maslow’s description of these states is essentially a description of a spiritually
mature human being. His views are in accordance with other views proposed by the
Institute for Consciousness Research for example. Their claim is that the awakening of
the Kundalini and cosmic consciousness is appearing in more and more people:

> As the evolution of our species proceeds, and new faculties of mind such as
> cosmic consciousness begin to appear in more and more people, as a result of
> the Kundalini process, science will have to expand its horizons to include non-
> physical aspects of creation invisible to us today” (“The Unification of Faith and
> Science”, n.d.).

The implication here is that this state of self-actualization, often characterized by
peak experiences, is no longer a rare phenomenon of mystics and saints. In 1974, The
Kundalini Research Center, based in Montreal, was engaged in research to discover not
only the growing number of people having experiences that could be identified as the
Kundalini arousal of consciousness, but to assist people having difficulty with the
process.

In addition to his work as a transpersonal psychologist, Maslow has also been
considered a humanistic psychologist. Criticisms of Maslow include comments that he

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          75

lacked scientific rigor and that his theory was not applicable to cultures outside of his
own; hence, he was considered biased by his critics. There is no doubt that Maslow’s
recognition of transcendence and the spiritual capacity of humans for self-actualization
was a giant step in the right direction.

Ken Wilber integrates a vast array of Eastern and Western thought into a “single
model” (Frager, 2009). The integral approach popularized by Wilber attempts to
coordinate and harmonize all of the practices humans are engaged in. He includes
cultural, behavioral, and subjective experience and social systems into a cohesive
philosophy: “You can’t [realistically] honor various methods and fields, without showing
how they fit together. That is how to make a genuine world philosophy” (Wilber, n.d.).

The phrase “integral psychology” is a “term coined in the 1940s by Indra Sen a
devotee of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, who established the field of integral
psychology, based on Sri Aurobindo's teachings” (Mohapatra, 2009). In his paper
“Structure and Process: Integral Philosophy and Triple Transformation,” Dr. Debashish
Banerji traces the term integral in the following:

> This brings me to the notion of the integral, which I touched on with respect to
> Ken Wilber. Wilber, of course, is not the founder of the term ‘integral’, even in its
> contemporary philosophical or psychological usage, though his popularization of
> the term is swiftly turning his use of it hegemonic. In the U.S., the academic
> precedents for this term can be found in Haridas Chaudhuri (1913-1975) (1974),
> the philosopher and educationist who founded the California Institute of Integral
> Studies (CIIS), and Pitirim Sorokin (1889-1968), a Harvard sociologist who
> coined the term “integral culture” (Sorokin, 1964, p.75). The usage of both these
> figures can be traced in turn to Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950). The use of the term
> by Wilber himself can also be traced to Sri Aurobindo, whose definitions and
> contexts of use are thus instructive to our discussion. Sri Aurobindo uses the
> term “integral” in two contexts, that of an “integral yoga” and of an “integral
> consciousness (Banerji, 2012b).
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         76

In his book A Theory of Everything, Wilber claims to have assembled over a 100

conclusions from different developmental psychology researchers. He describes how
similar they are: “Of course there are dozens of disagreements and hundreds of
conflicting details. But they all tell a generally similar tale of the growth and development
of the mind as a series of unfolding stages or waves” (Wilber, 2001a). This statement is
indicative of the mindset of Wilber as he attempts to coalesce many fragments into a
whole. He criticizes other psychologies for their inability to see the whole picture, as
their focus was limited to their own particular aspect.

> Behaviorism notoriously reduced consciousness to its observable, behavioral
> manifestations. Psychoanalysis reduced consciousness to the structures of the
> ego and their impact by the id. Existentialism reduced consciousness to its
> personal structures, and modes of intentionality. Many schools of transpersonal
> psychology focus merely on altered states of consciousness, with no coherent
> theory of the development of structures of consciousness. Asian psychologies

> computer like functions, thus devastating the lifeworld of consciousness itself
> (Wilber, 2000).

Psychotherapy, according to Wilber, is a synthesis per se of all therapies.

Although there are many interpretations of integral psychotherapy depending on the
practitioner, the essential aim of Integral psychotherapy is to harmonize mind, body and
soul. Notions of the self that stem from the East, the West and all over the world are
used in Wilber’s process.

Wilber’s theories are complex and far-reaching due to the extensive territory he
covers, and includes philosophy, religion, psychology and science. He attempts to heal

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013       77

splits he perceives not only in the human psyche, but those occurring between different
fields of knowledge. His aim was to establish a “world philosophy” that could weave the
world’s wisdom traditions and psychologies from both the East and the West into a
“Theory of Everything” (Wilber, 2001a).

Ken Wilber’s understanding of unity and the oneness of the world of humanity is
commendable and his contribution is great; however, there are criticisms. It is to be
expected that the supporters of a particular philosophy or school of psychology with
whom he criticizes and determines is limited, would object and consider him arrogant
and bereft of a true understanding of their philosophical position.

The insight to no longer exclude the wisdom of Eastern thought, but instead, to
attempt a marriage of Eastern and Western psychology is a good one. Great care
however is needed to avoid the Western habit of consuming and claiming what it
admires and then labeling it as its own. Sifting through philosophies and cherry picking
the ideas that agree with one’s own perspective may be gratifying and interesting but
having an openness to feedback and corrections is also important.

The spiritual and psychological wisdom of the East is dawning in the West at a
rapid rate. From spiritual philosophy to healing practices, Eastern influence has
permeated many fields and includes psychotherapy. Wilber’s work reflects this
contribution and champions it as a major thread in the synthesis he creates. However
courageous his intentions and no matter how significant are his contributions, a word of
caution is in order.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013              78

While the idea of a synthesis is appealing, there exists a risk of losing the
essential wholeness and diversity of each system of thought by amalgamating it all into
one. Integration is a noble but dangerous aspiration if the distinctions of each are no
longer recognizable. The quality of therapy then, must depend on the integrity and
knowledge of the practitioner; otherwise, it becomes a matter of loose interpretation.

As the world discovers the reality of oneness, it is a natural process to borrow
and learn from each other. But these exchanges must be implemented with care. The
preservation of diversity, true respect for the gifts of others and the ability to retain and
protect the original flavor and the truth of each, as well as the recognition of where or
who it originated from, are imperative. Otherwise, there is a loss and a potential for a
homogenization that loses the distinct and unique features of the original contribution.
On the other hand, the West is very creative and many of the therapies emerging today
are sincere in their attempt to honor principles gleaned from the world’s wisdom
traditions.

Therapies Uniting East and West

Already numerous, new schools of psychotherapy are emerging every day.

Given the constant debate over which ones are the best, the task of integrating them
would seem an impossible task. By looking at psychotherapy objectively, just as with
religious systems, a trace or a thread can be found that unites them. The underlying
premise and intent of all psychotherapy is to be of assistance, along with the desire to
bring about change and transformation. Many of the new schools that recognize the
spiritual reality of human beings are direct reflections of Eastern philosophies stemming

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          79

from yoga, Buddhism, meditation and other great works such as integral psychology
proposed by Sri Aurobindo; such schools include transpersonal, transformational,
spiritual, nondualism and other psychologies. Over the last century, Eastern
philosophies have without a doubt permeated Western culture. The marriage of the two
is creating very exciting prospects that will continue to unfold newer and better hybrids
as yet unimagined.

Each stage of development in the field of psychotherapy creates a clearer,
grander definition of the human being and this process of discovery continues to evolve.
Although efforts to materialize and force psychotherapy into a medical/quasi-scientific
model do exist, newer therapies that accept the profound complexity and immanently
divine nature of the mind or soul are also exuding their influence.

Descended from great thinkers such as William James, Abraham Maslow and
Carl Jung and Eastern philosophies, this path represents a shift in both the field of
psychology and the consciousness of the world.

Eastern Psychologies

Buddhist and Yoga psychologies are in accordance with Western ones in that
both view the relief of suffering as a primary goal but have a different methodology and
philosophical path to attain it. Buddhist teachings are more concerned with experience
than philosophy, and stress the individual’s responsibility for helping themselves
through the use of mental, physical and spiritual disciplines guided by a guru or teacher.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           80

The psychology of Buddhism is based on the notions that all things are
impermanent, that a separate self is but an illusion and that the cause of suffering is
desire. The goal is to achieve a higher state of consciousness where the illusion of
separateness and permanence evaporate like smoke in the face of self-knowledge and
detachment. Meditation is the primary tool used but different schools may employ
different styles. Zen, for example, uses the meditation of koans and/or paradoxes to
achieve enlightenment.

Yoga, derived from the Pre-Hindu culture is mentioned in the Vedas that date
back to 12000 B.C. - 4000 B.C. In yoga, a variety of methods are used to focus the
mind so that it can rise to a level of self-realization, one where contact with the Source
or Self can be made. Moving away from fear, attachment and ignorance, this process of
transformation is the goal of yoga. There are many types that address different aspects
or different personalities: Karma-yoga (the Yoga of action), Jinana-yoga (the Yoga of
knowledge), Bakti-yoga (the Yoga of devotion), Hatha-yoga (the Yoga of the body),
Mantra-yoga (the Yoga of sound), Kundalini-yoga (the Yoga of energy) and Raja-yoga
(the Royal Yoga of mind and body) (Frager, 2009).

Most yogas focus on just one particular aspect of being. Developed by Sri
Aurobindo, Integral Yoga is different as it focuses on the whole being and include the
physical, mental, vital, psychic and spiritual aspects. The Sapta Chatusthaya (Seven
Quartets) is the program for spiritual practice that was revealed to Sri Aurobindo and
has four goals: 1. Shuddhi (purification); 2. Mukti (liberation); 3. Siddhi (realization); and
4\. Bhukti (enjoyment) (Sandeep, n.d.).

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           81

The overarching goal is to achieve the transformation of all aspects of the human
being where no aspect is left behind. The yoga of Sri Aurobindo seeks an integral
consciousness, a wholeness that does not depend on any particular technique or
formula. Rather, it allows for individual creativity in creating a practice based on
attention, volition and affect. This transformation is to a higher state of consciousness,
to a level of truth beyond Mind to a connection and harmony with the Divine.

In the early 1900s, Sri Aurobindo described this yoga as a path for seeking the
Divine that would lift humanity out of the troughs of ignorance. Aurobindo felt that
humanity was on the brink of a major evolutionary leap. A leap to a supramental state of
knowing that would lend to the ability of perceiving the true nature of existence. The
Seven Quartets is not considered psychotherapy but more a practical psychology where
“it is rather, a system of creative practice, an archive of attention, a toolbox of
engagement and experience” (Banerji, 2012a).

Sufism is considered the mysticism of Islam. The Nafs—or the lower self, where
negative traits such as anger greed reside—is what prevents the soul from achieving
union with God. Transforming the Nafs is a lifelong journey but assisted by Sufi practice.
Sufis choose a guide who is spiritually mature and can guide the initiate from a position
of experience and wisdom.

Sufi psychology acknowledges other states of awareness and describes the
range as being from waking sleep to unity with God, the highest existing beyond words.
Whether one is a therapist, a teacher, guru or merely a lover of humanity, it appears
that the most sacred of all tasks is to assist one another on that journey. What is

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         82

needed is a refined heart that can share wisdom, light to illumine the path and faith, the
kind of faith that comes from positive knowledge that truth and love are a constant no
matter how veiled by material creation.

As Eastern philosophies have continued to exert their influence in the West,
psychotherapy has begun to adopt and modify some of these principles and practices
into new configurations of therapy. Some of the most useful adaptations are the use of
mindfulness, mind/body holism and nonduality consciousness stemming from both
Hinduism and Buddhism. These principles are such a profound contribution that they
merit further description of their therapeutic application.

Mindfulness is one of the seven elements of enlightenment in Buddhism.

“Correct” or “right” mindfulness is the seventh element of the eightfold path to
enlightenment. It can also be traced back to the early Upanishads, part of Hindu
scripture. In therapy, mindfulness is used in various ways; from teaching the client the
use of meditation to using it as a tool to deepen the process of becoming aware of inner
states. Fritz Perls, who coined the term gestalt therapy, used mindfulness as an
enhanced awareness of the present moment, including sensations, feelings, thoughts
and the relationship between the self and the environment.

Mindfulness is used in a variety of therapies, including Hakomi. In fact, Hakomi
therapy claims mindfulness as a fundamental principle and a main therapeutic tool.
Hakomi encourages clients to turn their awareness inward, staying with an experience
to gather more information. Hakomi uses interventions to help the client maintain a state

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013       83

of mindfulness, allowing the client to plummet down to the level where “organizing
beliefs” can be contacted and brought into awareness.

Organizing beliefs are those unconscious beliefs that are formed in childhood
and continue exerting influence through life. As organizing beliefs affect how we see
ourselves and how we are in the world, real change happens when these beliefs are
changed at the core level. Mindfulness is a tool to access them quickly.

Focusing on present experience, especially emotional ones, is not new. Reichian
therapy, gestalt, psychodrama and many encounter groups used this approach. In the
1980s, Moshé Feldenkrais began to move beyond to the organization of experience in
the development of the Feldenkrais method; a method that focuses on movement.
Hakomi also studies the body for clues on how these experiences are organized; how
each group of experiences gather around a particular belief. The experience of not
being loved for instance, can result in a belief that manifests in thought, body language
and behavior. Changing the original belief creates a chain of events that transcends the
previous habits controlling the client’s life.

Mindfulness directs the client toward the here and now with a focus on
observation, as opposed to changing the experience. The therapist then loses any
agenda other than supporting the inward journey of the client as each experience
bubbles to the surface. There is no force needed here, no ordinary conversation and no
manipulation. Of course, skills are needed but essentially, the main role of the therapist
is to provide safety and support so that the client can learn and explore, using the state
of mindfulness as a powerful tool to uncover beliefs that are no longer helpful.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013       84

According to Hakomi Therapy if this process is supported, the client will arrive at
wherever attention is needed. This may include mystical states, if that is what is
required to bring about healing.

> Psychotherapy is healing and healing only happens to living organisms. You can
> fix a car or a bookcase, you can repair a television set or computer—, but you
> don’t heal them. And they don’t heal themselves. Only living systems heal.
> Healing is an act of self-recreation. One being cannot heal another. The other
> can only help or hinder. The Organicity principle places the locus of healing and
> control within the client and the client-therapist relationship. The client’s growth
> and unfolding, his or her answers and resolutions, completions and new
> directions are all within. The therapist is there to help manage the process
> through which the client goes there and gets them (Kurtz, 1990).

Mindfulness has many applications including use in guided imagery. Mindfulness
can be used to make a connection with the “inner advisor” as described by Dr. Martin
Rossman in his book, Guided Imagery for Self-healing. The inner advisor is a wisdom
figure, the small voice within that can provide guidance. The client uses imagery to
contact other states such as the advisor, inner child, or guide.

Freud’s use of free association was also an attempt to delve beyond the
limitations of ordinary consciousness; almost every therapy since has developed
different strategies for uncovering what is hidden from normal consciousness. The
inclusion of mind/body and mindfulness awareness in the practice of therapy
revolutionizes it into a full experience that transcends mere talk. With the refinement of
the use of mindfulness as a therapeutic tool has come dramatic change within talk-
therapy. From conversational, long-term therapies to mindfulness-based ones, the client
has gone from talking about experiences to having them! The introduction of
mindfulness into the therapy session has revolutionized the way therapy is done. As the

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           85

use of mindfulness expands, its effectiveness and adaptability will continue to reveal
itself. “Although much remains to be worked out at theoretical and practical levels, the
future of mindfulness-based therapies are likely to depend on demonstrations of their
distinct, effective, and lasting contributions that other clinicians cannot ignore” (Mace,
Mind/body integrity is the recognition of the interconnectedness of both the
mind and body, as well as how they interact. Many new holistic psychotherapies use
mind/body holism and there are as many interpretations of this integration as there are
therapies. One of the most interesting uses is the understanding that the body offers
constant clues that can be indicators of internal psychological processes. Often, these
clues are very subtle… but a well-trained therapist both notices and uses them as a
dynamic pathway to access interior activity like thoughts, feelings, memories and
intentions.

A plethora of new therapies has evolved over the last fifty years and cover a wide
range of modalities. One example is Contemplative therapy, which is a fusion of Eastern
and Western philosophies that focuses on discovering the “brilliant sanity” that exists
within. This therapy is similar to Psychology of Mind that understands the mind has
inner wisdom and health but that incorrect thinking clouds that reality. Core Process
therapy and Hakomi therapy are two additional examples that have as a similar goal of
allowing clients to discover their own reality and trust that whatever arises in the session
is what needs addressing. Both use awareness of the body as a manifestation of
consciousness.

As therapy evolves, it increasingly incorporates the body. Integrative body
psychotherapy, biodynamic psychotherapy, bioenergetics, body psychotherapy and
concentrative movement therapy are just a few examples.

Additional examples of newer therapies include art, play, dance and drama
therapies that utilize methods that have evolved to engage the whole person. They are
often shorter and thus less expensive.

Non-duality and transpersonal therapies are breaking new ground. Clients seek
out therapists who use a non-duality therapy to overcome the myth of the self and
duality in an attempt to heal and overcome problems. Mindfulness is used alongside
other methods, but the main skill is the ability of the therapist to reflect back to the client
her/his essential nature. This is a very different role for the therapist and one that
demands a mature awareness and familiarity of higher dimensions of reality.

This new awareness is the awareness of a fundamental consciousness beyond
duality that has been referred to throughout the ages by mystics and sages alike. It is a
core realization in Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and many other great faiths.

Another Eastern concept that can be detected in non-dual therapy is that of
detachment: “An important function of non-dual therapies is to reveal attachment to

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           87

problems, and through awareness create the possibility of releasing those attachments”
(Krystal, 2011).

The Challenges Facing Psychotherapy

There is a disconnect between psychology and religion as described by Gerald
May in his book Will and Spirit:

> The present state of confusion regarding psychology and religion is not a sudden
> phenomenon. Its roots go back to the times when religion held almost total power
> over the psychological arena. In those days, psychological disorders were seen
> as resulting from demonic possession or moral turpitude, and relief was to be
> sought through exorcism or repentance. It is no wonder that modern society has
> felt considerable relief in finding objective, scientific explanations for human
> behavior and experience. But the pendulum of history may have swung a bit too
> far. Now, instead of seeing our experience in solely moralistic and spiritualistic
> terms, we are tempted to see it in the context of a positivism that leaves no room
> for meaning or spirit. Still, we continue to look for spiritual nourishment through
> modern psychological methods, and often wind up increasingly hungry (May,
> Homo-sapiens are multi-dimensional. To exclude any dimension (the spiritual in
particular) or to view it as an unwelcome part of the therapy session is a disservice to
the client and a betrayal of the original intent and nature of psychotherapy. Throughout
history, many cultures, including Egypt and Greece, have wondered about the nature of
the mind, the soul and the spirit. Theories of psychology emerged that evolved into the
multitude of psychotherapeutic models known today. If psychotherapy is to survive, it
must not abandon its original mandate in favor of a financially driven, “quick-fix”
methodology. Psychotherapy must courageously maintain its integrity or risk sinking
into the materialistic swamp that threatens to swallow it. Following are six policies that

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          88

have good motive but pose issues that will need to be followed closely and corrected to
avoid endangering the very essence of psychotherapy.

Medications. Psychotherapy is facing extreme challenges when it comes to the
rise of medications prescribed by medical practitioners and psychiatrists. When Prozac
was first introduced, it began a new trend in the treatment of depression where reliance
on medication has grown while numbers seeking psychotherapy has dwindled.

> During the decade from 1998 to 2007, the percentage of the general population
> who used psychotherapy remained stable. Over the same period, however,
> psychotherapy assumed a less prominent role in outpatient mental health care as
> a large and increasing proportion of mental health outpatients received
> psychotropic medication without psychotherapy (Olfson & Marcus, 2010).

Eclectic Therapy. The trend to choose a therapeutic method to fit the client is
commendable as each client is unique; not all therapies fit all clients. However, there is
a similarity in this approach to psychiatry where the selection of a medication, or in this
case a method, is made from a large catalog of possibility.

Although eclectic therapy can be advantageous in that it can offer a variety of
psychotherapeutic styles depending on the need of the client, the focus on the method
or methods is misleading. No matter how amazingly effective a method may appear, if
the quality of the therapist as a person is lacking, the method will fall short. Training
which consists of cramming as many techniques and methods into a young therapist’s
head becomes a disservice not only to the therapist but to his/her future clients. The
problem is that the focus becomes mechanical, materialistic and develops a reliance on
the technique while ignoring the necessary development of spiritual attributes like
compassion. Professional expertise is imperative in any training, but to emphasize

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           89

method in order to fulfill expectations of a trend toward evidence-based practice is
shortsighted.

Evidence-based practices (EBP), originally developed for medical practices,
are treatments that are supposedly based on scientific evidence. Results are
determined by studying certain treatments in large-scale clinical trials and the goal is to
discover treatments that are the most effective and that take the least amount of time.
This is an attempt to meet those important needs and at the same time, to apply some
regulation in the field of psychotherapy. While it is very important to protect the best
interests of clients, there are some very real dangers that raise the following questions.

How is a therapeutic practice judged as either a best practice or not? Every client
and every session is unique regardless of the method used, and secondly, who is doing
the judging and how do their biases affect the results? If the research is done outside of
a laboratory, in a natural setting like a therapist’s office, there are so many variables.
How can any concrete conclusion be made when the individual client comes with a
unique set of problems combined with a unique set of strengths? Add to this a unique
therapist using a model or not, in their own unique way? How can such subjective
experience be quantifiable? Then there is the problem of application. Are therapists all
of a sudden going to be visited by some outward authority to check if they are following
the rules? “Psychotherapy is an English word of Greek origin, deriving from Ancient
Greek psyche (ψυχή meaning "breath; spirit; soul") (Psychotherapy, n.d.). Trying to
force psychotherapy to fit into a scientific construct designed for the study of the natural
world is surely a death knell for psychotherapy.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013        90

Regulation. Another major issue involves regulation. Anyone can call
themselves a psychotherapist and that is an obvious danger that needs a solution.
However, a move toward state regulation is an even greater danger:

> Might psychotherapists and psychoanalysts be sleep walking to disaster in their
> collusion with the rapid progress toward state regulation? Powerful structures
> and processes that have been set in motion that could reduce psychotherapy
> (including psychoanalysis) to a set of prescribed, manualized, procedures.
> Sanctions may be applied to practitioners whose practice does not conform to
> these ‘National Occupational Standards’ set by the state appointed Health
> Professions Council (HPC). Furthermore, any practitioner using the state
> protected title psychotherapist could be subject to legal action if they are not
> registered with HPC. This state control would replace the regulation that has
> been developed by the professional organizations themselves (Mollon & Reeves,
> Economics is a real concern, especially in this economy. Having insurance is an
asset as therapy can be a very expensive investment that may be prohibitive for those
not covered. This is a positive step but there are some important cons to consider. The
discretion to authorize or deny treatment rests with a clerk in the insurance company; it
is not based on the client’s decision or even that of the therapist. The therapist must
provide a diagnosis, a “malady” in order for treatment to be covered. Again, this is
designed after the medical model and is problem-focused. The insurance company also
determines the length and frequency of sessions; not the client or the good judgment of
the therapist.

Confidentiality is no longer sacrosanct. Therapy records are a part of the
client’s medical records and can be accessed by many, including insurance companies,
law enforcement, employers and courts. Insurance companies also have way too much
control and force the therapist into a rigid position of excessive note taking and a

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013              91

cautious, defensive stance. Feeling centered, confident, innovative, creative and
completely present with eyes on the client instead of a notepad proves difficult under
these circumstances.

The Coming of Age of Psychotherapy

Western psychotherapy has come a long way since Freud. Through each “force”
or stage, the unfolding new paradigm, the growing maturity of humanity can be traced.
Psychotherapy is porous allowing as much influence in as it gives out. Each of the
pioneers in psychology mentioned herein and the many others left unnamed were each
and all influenced by the world around them. As the new paradigm emerges the higher
dimensions of consciousness and spirit are gaining recognition. In many therapies,
there already exists an integration of spiritual principles, the recognition of the spirit or
soul and the welcoming of the numinous. Of note is how the view of the human psyche
and theories of personality has undergone such a change from Freud’s nature-based
view to the transpersonal and mindfulness-based therapies of today. On the cutting
edge is a broadening of the psychotherapeutic practice beyond a narrow focus on
complexes and problems. It is not a dismissal of them by any means but rather an
attitude of acceptance of the multiple aspects of the psyche including the spiritual.

The relationship. Most schools of psychotherapy agree that the relationship
between the client and the therapist is very important, if not crucial. In order to acquire
the cooperation of the unconscious, the client must feel that the therapist is aware of
whatever is happening. The ability to understand deeply comes not so much from
technique but from the depth of experience, where compassion and acceptance have

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           92

had a chance to develop. And again, the creation of safety for the client is paramount in
order for there to be an environment that encourages the deeper layers of the self to
become accessible.

The intention of the therapist must be to allow, allow and allow rather than
supplant or assign problems or agendas to the client that somehow meet the need of
the therapist or a regulating authority more than the client. Intentions are vitally
important; constant monitoring of one’s own unconscious intentions is a healthy and
necessary practice. The problem often is the focus on doing rather than allowing. A
therapist often feels the need to be useful, helpful and competent and leads them to
want to “do” something: try a new intervention, interpret the client for them or maybe
give some good, encouraging advice. Knowing how to do all of these is important and
they have their place in the session when appropriate. But if the “doing” interferes with
the ability to relax and stay present with the client’s own unfolding in mindfulness, they
are a distraction and a detriment.

The new therapist. As psychotherapy evolves, it necessitates a higher level of
consciousness on the part of the therapist. Training is no longer enough. Maturity,
compassion, detachment, and an expansive view of humanity are the requirements a
therapist, now and in the future, will need in other words, maturity. In order to provide
real assistance to clients living in a complex world in transition, therapists must expand
their boundaries of knowledge beyond their personal beliefs, tradition, or training.

Beyond training is the development and refinement of the intuitive capacity of the
therapist. It is this intuitive capacity that picks up on what is actually happening beyond

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013               93

the words spoken, and if used properly, confirms trust in the client that the therapist is
on board and connecting. Any training or licensure requirements that rule out the use of
intuition or ignore its importance, are forgetting that most of the great advances in
psychological theories were born from someone’s intuitive ability.

Leaning away from the autocratic roles of the past, of doctor/patient or any other
permeation that gives the therapist a higher status than the client is something new for
the therapist and still under construction. Knowing how to maintain a “we”
consciousness in the therapy session is difficult. An analogy could be scuba diving with
a client. Imagine swimming along with the client as they describe what they are
experiencing: the role of the therapist is not to divert attention but to assist their clients
to pursue what interests them, which is usually important and leads to core material.
This is done in a mindful, here-and-now state. Anything outside of this is just
conversation and although helpful and necessary at times, it is not as powerful an agent
of change as the use of methods that assist the client to turn inward toward their own
internal experience.

The new therapist is a citizen of the world who rejoices in diversity while
remaining in contact with the fundamental oneness we all share. Staying abreast of the
latest developments in both science and psychotherapy that stretch awareness and
excite the imagination prevents falling into a comfortable rut. Developing a personal
practice in one’s life to maintain balance is essential. Humility and the understanding of
the equality between therapist and client, as well as the humility to accept one’s own
shortcomings, are important. There is liberation in knowing that the role of therapist

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013           94

does not demand being all knowing and perfect; instead, it demands being present in
the most authentic, humble, and loving way; it demands being a real human being.

Psychotherapy, philosophy, medicine, science; all of these facets of civilization
are spiritually based. They evolve from the mind, from inspiration and insight. It is the
magical transformation of ideas from the mind and the soul to the material plane. Each
of these many facets has a vital role to play in the transformation of society. They, too,
are recipients of this new wind of universality and as such must also play a role in
bringing about this stage of global maturity into fruition. This time offers a glorious
opportunity to contribute to the process. How can psychotherapists participate?

> Have faith in the evolutionary process of the world.
> Have faith in your client’s inner health.
> Develop a worldview that includes a deep appreciation of diversity.
> Appreciate the beauty of other faith systems.
> Broaden your understanding of unity and diversity.
> Find peace within yourself.
> Believe in yourself.
> Defend the integrity of psychotherapy.

As communication with the world is a two way street, communicate.

The Work

Psychotherapy is struggling not to be consumed by the vortex of materiality,
which is the signature of a juvenile culture that has yet to understand its capacity for
greatness. Just as there are signs in the world of a nascent maturity however, so too

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013             95

are there hopeful signs in the field of psychotherapy, a blossoming which reflects the
major paradigm shift currently underway in the world. One such indicator of a growing
maturity in psychotherapy will be its ability to find its footing in refining the dangerous
systems previously described. It must winnow out the useful systems, modifying or
discarding whichever ones threaten to suffocate the creative, innovative and intuitive
brilliance: the very fiber psychotherapy was created from. Psychotherapy needs to
recognize fearlessly the full capacity of the human being while resisting the very
definitions that diminish it. Psychotherapy, it must be remembered, is a method that
helps people change by discovering within themselves the power and wisdom to do so.
And psychotherapists need not forget that the greatest privilege is to be invited along on
the journey.

When clients seek a counselor, a psychiatrist, a psychologist or a
psychotherapist, what they are really seeking is to become whole. Regardless of the
presenting problem, the need for wholeness is always at the heart of the issue. From
time immemorial humans have sought integration and wholeness, but never was the
need as clear or as imperative as it is at this time in history. Dr. Banerji describes it as
such:

> This (drive) was not so prominent in earlier times, because the world didn’t force
> us to deal with so much bewildering and hostile difference. We can do this using
> our limited personal and cultural resources, but anything we do leaves a greater
> and greater footprint in terms of the interdependence of our times. Hence, apart
> from mindfulness, psychological models and practices which see the need for an
> expansion of personal consciousness into a true understanding of “others”
> through individuation/universalization begin to be more properly indicated the
> times to come (Banerji, personal communication, July 23, 2013).
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            96

Transcendence and the process of individuation is not the desire to assimilate,
nor is it a true representation of the elimination of differences. It is a new way of being
with oneself and as a result a new way of being in the world. It is this process, this
evolutionary step that allows one to see the “other” as the self. In a paper written by
Michael Bryson professor of English at California State, an understanding of the
process outlined by Jung and de Chardin is described:

> Transcendence of the Self is a process of leaving behind and bringing along; the
> old self-the separate, unconnected self-is abandoned, and yet it is precisely what
> is brought to the Other in any attempt at contact and joining. Jung calls this the
> process of individuation, in which one holds on to a sense of one's unique
> individuality while realizing one's connection to a larger experience of human
> existence. This is what Pierre Teilhard de Chardin calls the Grand Option, "the
> coming together of separate elements [which] does nothing to eliminate their
> differences. On the contrary, it exalts them" For de Chardin, it is of the utmost
> importance that this joining, or as he refers to it, this convergence, be a
> "conspiration informed with love" (Bryson, 2013).

The demands of a globalizing world whose transitional changes are so acute and
rapid call for a higher level of consciousness. Understanding that the human race is one
is a required aspect, but it goes deeper than that: the realization that sees the “other” as
the self. Throughout religious history the golden rule, “treat others as you yourself desire
to be treated”, has been difficult to practice. If the awareness of oneness is not at the
heart of this practice, it becomes a moralistic effort grounded in duality. “The ideals of
liberty, equality and fraternity by which modern civilization is held accountable are
important but these also are realizable in their fullness only through a psychological
condition in which the ‘other’ is known deeply as another aspect of the ‘self’ (Banerji,
personal communication, July 23, 2013).

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          97

In the past, enlightenment and transcendence were matters that concerned only
a very few and were generally mediated by the clergy, a guru or some authority figure
but this is no longer the case. As previously stated, an increasing number of people are
experiencing higher states of consciousness—and sometimes with alarm—due to the
lack of knowledge needed to understand what is taking place. Imagine if these people
could avail themselves of a wise psychotherapist to assist and enable the process.
Instead of viewing psychotherapy as only for the sick or disturbed, psychotherapy could
become a vehicle for growth way beyond our present standard. Most psychotherapists
understand that therapy is a growth process, but the kind of work indicated here is going
to become an urgent need as the world continues its own process of awakening.

The world is giving birth to a new age or era and is in need of its own collective
doula. Today the psychological need for this awakening is a calling that can be heard
from all sides. It is calling out to psychotherapy; hopefully it is listening.

Conclusion

Against All Odds

History has shown that human evolution is not limited, that the potential for
further development is limitless. Humanity has faced so many narrow escapes and
beaten so many odds, but it nevertheless continues to survive and evolve. Instead of
being destroyed by challenges, it thrives when it chooses to overcome them, just as the
individual grows wiser when hardships are conquered. The plant and animal kingdoms
are restricted by their genetic code, but humans have a consciousness, a soul that is
not bound by material existence.

An emergence from the primordial ooze to the level of sophistication of this
century, this amazing journey of transformation clearly indicates two things: that
humanity will inevitably reach an unimaginable future and that there are strong
indications that this amazing saga of evolution of the human race is and never will be an
accident. Therefore, a divine Intelligence with a definite plan is secret (and not so
secretly) guiding the ship. This process of accelerated evolution is awakening the minds
of the world to a new awareness, one that indicates an awakening to a compelling
impulse in moving forward or facing an intensification of pain and suffering until a move
is made:

> Reflecting upon the stupendous cosmic coincidences and the multibillion-year
> defiance of odds that evolution exhibits, we sense that a purpose, a Telos, calls
> the universe toward a greater existence. And we find such a calling in us. There
> is a profound affinity between the emergence of consciousness from the
> inorganic world and the emergence of new life in us (Leonard & Murphy, 1995).
Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013      99

Choosing life and the unknown take courage. The unknown is both attractive and
terrifying at the same time, but this courageous movement forward unleashes potential.
The capacities to know and to love are the bedrock of all other attributes like kindness,
compassion and curiosity to name but a few. As humanity evolves, this ability to know
and to love finds its highest expression in service to humanity, the trademark of a
growing maturity. Although the world is besieged with problems, signs of a new
awareness of the oneness of humanity and the responsibility it demands, like the sun at
dawn, will eventually and predictably rise to its zenith:

> Evolution is an act of courage. The seed has only the promise, only the signal. It
> is an act of faith, a leap into uncertainty. The seedling must emerge from its
> strong, protective sheath and venture forth. It is a time of vulnerability and
> danger. If conditions change, the seed is lost. I would agree — growth and
> change seem inevitable. It seems we must (Kurtz, 1990).

Albeit sporadic, the human race has evolved through the stages of infancy,
childhood and adolescence. Although not uniformly, as different cultures are at different
levels, there is a global and an observable shift to a new level of consciousness.
Changes in all fields of human endeavor have been so swift and unimaginable that
people living just a hundred years ago could never have imagined it. This shift from
adolescence to maturity has been marked by the convulsions of birth into the next stage
as the emergence from turbulent adolescence is transcended.

Extrication from materialism. In infinite ways, attachment to materialism has
proven to be a recipe for the destruction of the planet and the suffering of humanity.
Detachment is a fundamental teaching of most religions and faiths. Science is beginning
to unfold a vision of reality that corresponds to the spiritual understanding that the
material world, as we have understood it, is an illusion. The models built from
attachment to this illusion are crumbling and no longer work:

> The old model, with its certainties and hierarchies and violence, became
> unworkable just when it seemed to be enjoying its greatest successes. Now that
> the atom can be split, and machines of untold power and cleverness and
> diversity populate the countryside, now we feel the loss of meaning, the threat of
> death and the taste of metal in the air. Now, when the war machines are
> suddenly capable of killing us all, there is a growing awareness that somehow we
> have gone quite wrong. The old model has reached its limits. When the
> physicists searched for the atom with the tools of modern science, they found no
> solid, indestructible, absolute, eternal, separate pieces of the great machine. The
> “stuff of the world,” as Sir James Jeans noted, “is mind stuff.” A whole new view
> has emerged (Kurtz, 1990).

The crumbling of the old model and the creation of the new is fraught with
danger. The world is in turmoil, but as the old model crumbles and however painful,
people are freed from slavery and oppression, women are insisting on equality and with
the help of electronic communications, the world is discovering its oneness for the first
time. A vision once limited to mystics and prophets only is now an experience open to
everyone.

Science is learning a new story. The signs of a revolution of thought are
observable in science. There is a gradual shift from the purely mechanical, materialistic
view. Lynne McTaggart gives voice to this transition in her book, The Field:

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013          101

> It is time to relegate Newton and Descartes to their proper places, as prophets of
> a historical view that has now been surpassed. Science can only be a process of
> understanding our world and ourselves, rather than a fixed set of rules for all
> time, and with the ushering in of the new, the old must often be discarded
(McTaggart, 2002).

Moving away from a mechanistic orientation where people are viewed as things
and consciousness as an epiphenomenon of the material brain is necessary if the
development of a more helpful worldview is adopted. As science discovers that the
tiniest particles have interiority, and that atoms are mostly empty space, there is no
alternative but to detach from a view of the world as a despiritualized reality. As it leans
to the growing realization that spirit animates matter it re-discovers a realization that
spiritual people the world over have always known.

Modern science has cast a spell over the world; rejecting and banning spirituality
as a prerogative only of the delusional and misguided. As its revolution of thought
progresses, it will have a new influence that will assist in demolishing the last dregs of a
worldview that dehumanizes people and denigrates nature. This is one of the tools that
will help the world extricate itself from the prison of materiality. This is the hope for
science.

Intrinsic to humans is the drive toward unity. Isolation and a sense of
separation are anathema to the modern soul and contribute to the breakdown of society
into reductionist splintering. The field of medicine is a prime example: specialization is
so extreme that the reality of holism is eclipsed by the view that the body is merely a
collection of parts and when parts no longer communicate with each other, illness
ensues. Health on the other hand demands that each part of a healthy body necessarily

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         102

communicates to all other parts, creating a process of healing integration. There is then
organization into whole systems, which cells do naturally without any loss of purpose or
identity. Liver cells don’t become kneecap cells and stomach cells are unique from brain
cells. It is the spirit that manifests itself in the body and communicates to the brain. Like
a brilliant computer, the brain directs unity and cooperation of the diverse parts; when
this process is interrupted, confusion and disease ensue and if not corrected, the body
falls into chaos and collapse.

This is a parallel to the workings of civilization: the lack of connection and unity in
the world has allowed for the many illnesses or problems the world is experiencing.
There is a backward attempt to heal everything else before focusing on unity, but it is
unity itself that will bring the answers so sorely needed.

> “We have to heal the lack of connection between the mind and the body, which is
> emblematic of the lack of connection between us and our larger physical context,
> the earth itself. We haven’t yet accepted the truth that despite whatever divides
> us—gender, race, nationality, and ethnicity—we are a single global civilization”
> (Gore, 1993).

A new wind of unity is blowing and irresistible. The spiritual impulse, this cycle of
renewal has commenced and receptive souls are feeling its effects. It may be identified
in any number of ways and attributed to a variety of sources, but its transformative
impact is undeniable.

The Birth of a New Cycle

Throughout history, there have been these peaks, recurring cycles of brilliance:
the great philosophical traditions of ancient Greece, the age of Enlightenment, the
Renaissance are just a few pivotal ages that transformed civilization. Regardless of the

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            103

issues that stemmed from 19th century European colonialism, nationalism and
industrialization, that recent period is known as a time of great transition. Not only did it
see an enormous spike in scientific achievements, but also a new level of
understanding in philosophical and spiritual circles began to emerge. For example,
philosophers began to move away from perceiving the world as a static, unchanging
reality. “Hegel, the elder James, and Aurobindo represent an historic shift of perspective
by many thinkers from the view that the world is static to a belief that it is moving,
however haphazardly, toward higher levels of existence” (Leonard & Murphy, 1995).

In his book The Life Divine, Sri Aurobindo describes the impulse of spirit as being
involved in matter: “If it be true that Spirit is involved in Matter and apparent Nature is
secret God, the manifestation of the divine in himself and the realization of God within
and without are the highest and most legitimate aim possible to man upon earth”
(Aurobindo, 1990/2006).

In mid-18th century Europe, Freud was developing his perspective of human
nature. His psychoanalytic theory was an important advancement but was bereft of a
spiritual dimension. Soulless psychologies and materialistic philosophies of the period
denied the spiritual aspect, the most important reality of the human being, but this did
not deter the great strides into spiritual discovery others were making. While Freud was
developing his theory, Bahá'u'lláh who was unlawfully imprisoned in the fortress prison
of Akka elucidated a different perspective of human nature. From that lonely prison cell
He claimed that human nature is basically spiritual and affirmed that "the soul is a sign

of God, a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to grasp, and
whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever hope to unravel” (Bahá'u'lláh, 2006).

'Abdu'l- Bahá, the son of Bahá'u'lláh and His official interpreter, goes on to
explain more about the nature of the soul as per his father’s teachings:

> The soul is not a combination of elements, it is not composed of many atoms, it is
> of one indivisible substance and therefore eternal. It is entirely out of the order of
> the physical creation; it is immortal! Scientific philosophy has demonstrated that a
> simple element ("simple" meaning "not composed") is indestructible, eternal. The
> soul, not being a composition of elements, is, in character, as a simple element,
> and therefore cannot cease to exist. In the world of spirit there is no
> retrogression. The world of mortality is a world of contradictions, of opposites;
> motion being compulsory everything must either go forward or retreat. In the
> realm of spirit there is no retreat possible, all movement is bound to be towards a
> perfect state. ‘Progress’ is the expression of spirit in the world of matter. The
> intelligence of man, his reasoning powers, his knowledge, his scientific
> achievements, all these being manifestations of the spirit, partake of the
> inevitable law of spiritual progress and are, therefore, of necessity, immortal
> (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 2011).

The 19th century was a time of great change and progress. Many spiritual
movements grew out of this period and included many mystical schools of thought that
remain influential today. Most significant was the maturation and inspirational thinking
that emerged from those whose voices were not drowned out by the forces of
colonization, materialism and a soulless science. On May 24, 1844, the first electronic
transmission that launched the information age was sent by Samuel Morse, reading
“What hath God wrought” (“What Hath God Wrought”, n.d.).

A Vision of Hope

Without a positive vision of the future, one is at the mercy of the ups and downs
presented by life. Bouncing like a cork on a turbulent sea of world problems, it is easy to

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            105

lose hope. As a therapist, hope and faith in the future have a palpable influence on a
client and needn’t be verbal for it to exert its effect. Clients are often demoralized,
depressed and afraid, feelings exacerbated by daily exposure to the traumas the world
is experiencing. But the ability to view the strengths in the client instead of fixating on
the problems, an ability to re-frame when necessary and the capacity to find humor
when appropriate: all such skills come from a solid sense of hope. In 1966, Robert
Kennedy gave his Day of Affirmation Speech at the University of Cape Town in South
Africa and described hope as something that triggers initiative, courage and creativity:

> Some believe there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the
> enormous array of the world's ills -- against misery, against ignorance, or
> injustice and violence. Yet many of the world's great movements, of thought and
> action, have flowed from the work of a single man. A young monk began the
> Protestant reformation, a young general extended an empire from Macedonia to
> the borders of the earth, and a young woman reclaimed the territory of France. It
> was a young Italian explorer who discovered the New World, and 32-year-old
> Thomas Jefferson who proclaimed that all men are created equal. ‘Give me a
> place to stand,’ said Archimedes, ‘and I will move the world.’ These men moved
> the world, and so can we all (Kennedy, 1966).

The vision of Nonduality and its implications for the social restructuring of the
planet as a developmental next stage, the coming of age of humanity, the
understanding that the turbulence of this period is akin to labor pains… all are part of a
matrix from which psychotherapy cannot only maintain hope but re-discover its role in
the process. The main pillar of this understanding is the oneness of humanity and the
realization of “other” as an aspect of self. It can only be conceived by the complete love
and acceptance of diversity, without which it will remain a pollyanic utopia or worse, a
state- enforced globalization that threatens human rights by its inclination toward
homogeneity.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         106

Hope is nourished by the realization that humans are designed to evolve and
history certainly testifies to this fact. The potential inherent in humans is inexhaustible;
children are born with exceptional talents, skills and gifts more now than ever before.
This is a growing phenomenon that invites contemplation of what lies ahead. In the
distant future, it is quite possible that we will be viewed as spiritual pygmies.

Some have currently demonstrated great paranormal skill and documented by
P.S.I. researchers like Dr. Jeffrey Mishlove who used stringent, laboratory testing to
prove their ability. One such individual could create natural events like lightning on a
sunny day or a storm out of nowhere. However, Mishlove expressed in his class on
P.S.I. at the University of Philosophical Research that these skills are often premature
as there is a lack of spiritual development as yet to balance them. It is clear that any
concept of what a spiritually mature human race will be like in the future is mere
speculation at this point, but knowing it is both possible and inevitable is enough.

The Art of Healing

Psychotherapy originated out of compassion for the suffering and remains as its
core value. Forgetting this risks the deterioration of psychotherapy into some sort of
quasi-scientific method prone to a cold, mechanistic response. As the world undergoes
a crisis of healing, the splits that divide it become glaringly obvious. Whether between
science and religion, men and women, extremes of wealth and poverty, racial and
religious divisions, hostility between countries: all of these splits need healing and
integration. So too do we, as individuals living in a fractured world.

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013            107

The client and therapist are both subject to its influence; in his or her own regard,
each needs to do the work necessary to heal the splits that divide their own psyche.
Knowing we are “all in this together” keeps the playing field level and leaves hubris out
of the equation to a large extent. The art of healing lies within the client; when it is
inspired and protected by a compassionate and talented therapist, a therapist with a
broad experience and love of humanity, the work becomes a healing and an inspiration
for both.

As psychotherapy evolves, numerous new approaches will develop that reflect
the shift the world is undergoing. On the one hand, there is a move toward scientism.
But on the other, the rapid unfolding of more spiritual approaches indicates a growing
awareness and inclusion of the many aspects of the human psyche that were once
overlooked:

> In psychotherapy, a shift is surely underway. For one thing, there is a great
> variety of approaches which weren’t available before. Many of these are not
> taught in our universities yet, nor are they sanctioned by the health care or
> academic establishments. For another, the context has broadened to include not
> only neurosis and mental illness, but teaching, organization, and personal and
> transpersonal growth. In all of this, allegiances have shifted too. Many who
> practice psychotherapy today find philosophical ground for their work, not within
> the sphere of medicine, but in other traditions, spiritual or esoteric. For
> understanding the self, the old sciences, physics and chemistry, have been found
> wanting. The new sciences of chaos and self-organizing systems, especially as
> they relate to biology and physiology, are showing promise (Kurtz, 1990).

Evolution is an adventure and never has there been such a need for the brave
of heart. Psychotherapy must be brave now as it assists the world through this
transition. It must not lose faith in its ability to create a positive influence by believing in
the highest possibility of humanity and its clients:

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013         108

> Like the human heart, the world points beyond itself to something greater and
> more beautiful than its present condition. That something attracts us all, in
> different ways, and leads many of us to seek transformation. Does it secretly
> inform the entire evolutionary adventure? Could it be that the human heart and
> the world’s heart are one in their self-surpassing? We believe that they are. As
> we grow in love and strength, we become vehicles for the world’s growth. We
> bring new sustenance to our families, new joy to our friends, new light to our
> places of work. We enhance the physical things around us, and the earth itself
> (Leonard & Murphy, 1995).

Amidst the chaos and confusion of a world in travail, it is important to remember
the beauty of the world and the beauty of this magical time of transition, for peace of
mind and the replenishment of joy, as described in the following words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Soon the whole world as in springtime will change its garb. The bleakness of the
> wintertime is over and the spiritual springtime is at hand. The black earth is
> becoming a verdant garden; the deserts and mountains are teeming with red
> flowers. Along the borders of the wilderness the tall grasses are standing like
> advance guards before the cypress and jessamine trees, while the birds among
> the rose branches are singing loudly like the angels of the highest heavens,
> announcing the glad tidings of the spiritual springtime and the sweet music of
> their voices is causing the real essence of all things to vibrate and quiver
> (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1956/1976).

The Hopi prophecy about The Mending of the Sacred Hoop and the vision of
Black Elk described in the opening chapter are but two of a great many number of
Native prophecies. The prophecy of the unification of humanity exists in every culture
and can be found in every country of the world. The signs of both destructive and
integrative processes in the world at present are evident and exemplify the visionary
truths of these many prophecies. In fits and starts, humanity is coming of age. The
choice to assist in the process is not only one psychotherapy must make but one that
faces every soul who finds themselves here at this propitious time. Humanity may
inadvertently slow the process by making wrong choices, but if the unity and peace of
the world is part of a Divine Plan, then nothing can stop it; its realization is only a matter

Diane Kerr – heyoka9@gmail.com – Thesis The Coming of Age of Humanity – 10/23/2013       109

of time. Though difficult, the convulsions that the world is experiencing serve to release
the potentialities inherent in humanity, progressively uncovering the profound, true
nature of the human being. As children of the half-light —living between the dark night
of one age and the breaking dawn of another—we are faced with a choice. Which one
do we desire to support and choose to live in? This is the choice, this is the choice.
