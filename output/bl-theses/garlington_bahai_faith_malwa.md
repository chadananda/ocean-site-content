## The Bahá'í Faith in Malwa: A Study of a Contemporary Religious Movement

### by [William Garlington](https://bahai-library.com/author/William+Garlington)

1975


> **Abstract:** The Bahá'í World Faith is a contemporary religious movement which at the present time is supporting propagation activities in over three hundred countries and dependencies throughout the world. It is classified as a religious movement because its teachings and assertions of authority are claimed to be derived from the Sacred specifically, an omnipotent and transcendent God, as manifested in the personage of a prophet figure known by the title 'Bahá'u'lláh' (the Glory of God). Since its early years of inception in nineteenth century Persia, the Bahá'í Faith has received very little scholarly attention. Outside of the pioneering efforts of the famed Cambridge Orientalist, E. G. Browne, whose work on the early history of the Bíbí-Bahá'í movement stands unequalled, the Faith has been virtually bypassed as a topic of academic research. Even in Browne's time his work on an 'insignificant sect of Islam' brought him criticism. Browne felt, however, that a record of the early years of the Faith's development would be invaluable if it were later to evolve into an established world religion. The rapid expansion of the Bahá'í Faith in recent years has justified Browne's efforts. Since the time of his work, however, many new developments have taken place within the movement. From its tumultuous beginnings in nineteenth century Persia the Bahá'í Faith has over the past 130 years developed into an internationally recognized world religion with headquarters in Haifa, Israel, and functioning communities on every continent of the globe. It is no longer a 'Persian' religion, but an international organization whose doctrines and institutions are influencing millions of people from many different cultural backgrounds. This fact alone should make the movement one of interest to the student of comparative religion, and it was with such thoughts that the author decided to investigate the present day activities of the Bahá'í Faith.

Introduction
The Baha'1 World Faith is a contemporary religious movement which at
the present time is supporting propagation activities in over three
hundred countries and dependencies throughout the world.     It is classified
as a religious movement because its teachings and assertions of authority
are claimed to be derived from the Sacred: specifically, an omnipotent

and transcendent God, as manifested in the personage of a prophet figure
known by the title 'Baha'u'llah' (the Glory of God).

Since its early years of inception in nineteenth century Persia, the
Baha'f Faith has received very little scholarly attention.     Outside of
the pioneering efforts of the famed Cambridge Orientalist, E. G. Browne,
whose work on the early history of the Bab1-Baha'1 movement stands
unequalled, the Faith has been virtually bypassed as a topic of academic
research.* Even in Browne's time his work on an 'insignificant sect of Islam'

brought him criticism.       Browne felt, however, that a record of the early
years of the Faith's development would be invaluable if it were later to
evolve into an established world religion.         The rapid expansion of the
Baha'i Faith in recent years has justified Browne's efforts.         Since the
time of his work, however, many new developments have taken place within
the movement.   From its tumultuous beginnings in nineteenth century Persia
the Baha'f Faith has over the past 130 years developed into an
internationally recognized world religion with headQuarters in Haifa,
Israel, and functioning communities on every continent of the globe.            It
is no longer a 'Persian' religion, but an international organization whose
doctrines and institutions are influencing millions of people from many
different cultural backgrounds.      This fact alone should make the movement
one of interest to the student of comparative religion, and it was with
such thoughts that the author decided to investigate the present day
activities of the Baha'i Faith.

Having decided to conduct such a study, a suitable environment had
to be found in which research could be carried out.         One of the countries
in which the Baha'i movement has rapidly expanded in terms of declared
believers is India.      From the time of its inception in that country (1872) *
until the early 1960's, the Baha'i     cow~unity   remained a small and often
isolated group of urban believers whose numbers probably did not amount
to more than a thousand souls.      However, with the development of
internationally directed teaching campaigns aimed at enrolling the masses

of humanity, the situation changed drastically.       Almost overnight the
number of declared believers in India jumped from less than a thousand in
1960 to close to four hundred thousand by 1974. 4 The work was accomplished
by travelling Baha'f teachers who personally went to the villages of India
to proclaim the message of the Faith and enroll those villagers who wished
to become memberso      This phenomenon, known throughout the Baha'f world
as mass teaching, was particularly successful in two regions of central
India in the state of Madhya Pradesh, namely, the areas surrounding the
cities of Gwalior and Indore - Ujjain, the latter being known by the folk
name of Malwa.      In Jvlalwa alone over one hundred thousand persons signed
declaration cards. *

Having enrolled the new declarants1 the leadership of the movement
(from this time referred to as the Baha'i Administrative Order) has set
about to try and educate many of them in the various aspects of Baha'i life,
as its aim is to develop communities of believers throughout the world
which are able to function within a framework of the     mov<~ent's   socio-
religious institutions.      However, due to lack of funds and a limited
number of trained village teachers, in Malwa the Baha'i Administrative
Order has concentrated on trying to introduce the Faith's teachings and
institutions into a number of 'model village' communities, some of which
maintain resident Baha'i teachers who have been specifically trained to act
as community leaders.      It is hoped that these 'model village' communities
will be able to evolve into springboards for further community development,
and consequently they are the focal point of Bal1a 1 f educational efforts in

Halwa.    Given this situation, the region seemed an excellent laboratory
in which to examine the current activities of the Baha '1 Fai tll, and
consequently I decided to focus my study on the movement's work in rural
Malwa.

II
The main purpose of the present study is to examine the various
doctrines, teachings, and institutions of the Baha'i       Fait~   both in theoryy
and as they are being implemented in a specific cultural environment.
The work's scope, however, is not restricted to one discipline, as it
also traces the movement's historical development from its earliest days
in Persia to the advent of the mass teaching era in India and attempts to
analyze from normative and structural points of vie1f the various aspects
of Baha'i commcmi ty life.     Consequently, it is hoped that the study 1fill
be of interest to the historian and the sociologist as well as to the
student of comparative religion.

In terms of organization the \fork is divided into three parts.         Part
I (Chapters 1-3) is primarily historical in outlook, while Parts II
(Chapters 4-6) and III (Chapters 7-11) are more sociological in orientation.

Chapter l traces the gro\fth of the movement from its inception in
nineteenth century Persia to its emergence as an international .faith.
Being essentially an introductory chapter, it does not contain vast amounts
of historical detail, but focuses on the major events that have highlighted
the Baha'i Faith's historical evolution.       Regarding the early history of
the movement three main sources 1fere consulted.       The first, entitled The

.     .

Da1f!l-Breakers, 1fritten by Nab1l-i-A'zam (l·luharrmlad Zarandl), a companion of
Baha'u'llah, and translated by the movement's appointed Guardian,· Shoghi
Effendi (1897 ·- 1957), is the official Baha '1 history of the early years
of the Faith.    The other two, A Traveller's Narrative and The Tarfkh-i-Jadrd,

were both translated by E. G. Browne.          Tl1e former was 1-lri tten by the son
of Baha'u'llah, •Abdu'l-Baha 5 , while the latter was penned by a certain
Mfrza ~usayn of H8llladan.    In addition to the authors' accounts, both
works contain Brmme 1 s own notes and comments        which; being based on his
thorough exrunination of various BS,bl-Bahfi 'l, Muslim, and Eu.ropean sources,;
were extremely helpful.      Along with these major works      n~~erous    secondary
sources were consulted including anong others:          several articles written by
Brmme and published in The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great
Britain and Ireland;    his edited volume l-laterials for the Study of the            Bab~

Religion, which contains several translations of origina' documents
pertaining to the Faith;     Comte de Gobineau' s Les Relig·ions et les
Philosophies dans 1 'Asie Centrale;    H. H. Balyuzi' s The Bab and Baha' u' llah;
Lord Curzon•s Persia and the Persian Question;         and A. Bausani•s articles
on the Bab and Baha'u'lliih in the Encyclopaedia of Islam.

The period from the death of Baha 'u 'lliih to the present has been based
on several Baha' f original sources, the most important of which was Shoghi
Effendi's God Passes By, a work describing the growth of the movement from
its inception through the time of his leadership.           Other important sources
for this period include:     4 Abdu'l-Baha's    Will and Testament and Tablets of
the Divine Plan;   the letters and correspondence of Shoghi Effendi,
published in various volumes including Baha '1       Ad.~inistration,    The Promised
Day Is Come, The lforld Order of Baha'u'llah, Dawn of a llew Day, The Advent
of Divine Justice, Citadel of Faith, and Letters from the Guardian to

and the thirteen volume set of The Baha'i World: An International Record,
a series of reference 'wrks published under the auspices of the Baha' f
Faith between the years 1927 and 1970.      In addition, numerous secondary
sources were consulted, all of which are listed in the bibliography at
the end of the study.

Chapter 2 outlines the evolution of the Faith in India from the time
of its earliest contact with the subcontinent up to the beginning of the
mass teaching era.      Huch of the information in this chapter was obtained
from two American Baha'i publications, the aforementioned The Baha'i Horld,
and an early periodical, Star of the Hest (1910- 1933), both of which
contained numerous progress reports of Baha'i activities in India over
the years.   In addition to these sources, use was also made of an Indian
publication, Baha'i Newsletter, whose various installments contained
valuable information regarding the growth of the Indian Baha'i community.

Chapter 3, the last chapter in this section, deals with the rise of
the Baha' 0: movement in the area of central India knmm as   !~alwa,   tracing
its growth and development in the region from the time of the first Baha'i
resident (1942)   to the present day.     vfuile some of the information for
this chapter could be gleaned from Baha'i Newsletter and unpublished
correspondence of the Indian National Spiritual Assembly,

7 the majority
of data had to be obtained by means of personal interviews with those
individuals who participated in the events.      Consequently, a large part
of Chapter 3 is original history as recounted by the Baha'i pioneers who
made it.

Part II looks at the sociological framework vi thin which Baha'i
teachings are being promulgated.      The first part of Chapter   4 outlines
the outstanding characteristics of the contemporary Halwa village social

system, highlighting those aspects of the system that are experiencing
stress as a result of their contact with modern influences.           In the second
part Baha'1 statistical information for the region is presented along with
short descriptions of the five 'model village' communities from which the
author's examples of community development were taken.           ·rhe primary
purpose of this chapter is to inform the reader of the type of social
milieu into which Baha'i doctrines and institutions are being introduced
so that he might better appreciate both the obstacles and coagencies            ~;ith

which the movement 1 s teachers are confronted in their attempts to implement
Baha'i teachings in village communities.        In preparing the chapter two
works were extensively consulted: Adrian Hayer's Caste and Kinship in
Central India, and K. S. Nathur's Caste and Ritual in a Malwa Village.
Both of these works vere based on field studies carried out in Malwa

villages, Hayer's in village Ramkheri in Dewas district, and Mathur 1 s
in village Potlod in Indore district.         Furthermore, several sources
relating to social change in India vere used, the most outstanding of
which were N. N. Srinivas 1 Social Change in Modern India, and I. K.
Ishwaran's edited volwne Change and Continuity in India's Villages.             This
information, moreover, was supplemented by the author's own personal
experiences in Malwa. *

Chapter 5 analyzesthe organizational structure of the vehicle that
is actively promoting the propagation and consolidation efforts of the
Baha'i Faith both in    Mal~;a   and in numerous countries throughout the world,

the Baha'i administrative superstructure,      ~;ith   specific reference being
given to their modes of operation in India and the resulting influences

exerted on Hallva.      The analysis is not only based on numerous Baha'i
written sources but on personal interviews with individuals who are
actively involved at all levels of Baha'i leadership.              These included
talks with members of national and local administrative institutions in
India as well as discussions with persons holding positions of international
rank.

Chapter 6 describes the various channels of communication by which
the Baha'i Administartive Order in India maintains contact with its new
declarants.       These institutions are the primary conveyors of the
movement's teaching and consolidation activities in l·lalwa, and consequently
they can be considered the backbone of the educational program in the region.
The data concerning their structure and modes of operation was obtained
primarily through personal contact with them in the field, although some
information >ms also acquired from specific written material gathered at
the Baha'i national office in New Delhi.

Part III constitutes the core of the work.      In this section the
essential sociological questions with which the study is concerned are
raised.      They are as follows:
1)    What are the doctrinal and institutional norms of the

Baha'i Faith
2)   How are these norms being related to the Indian cultural

envirorunent?
3)   To what extent do Baha''L institutions in five 'model village'

commu11ities reflect these norms?

The individual chapters in Part III focus on the various doctrines and
socio-religious institutions that are being introduced into 'model village'
communities in 1-lalwa.      'I'hese aspects of community life can be divided into
five main categories:       doctrines and beliefs, ritual   &'1d   ceremony, social
principles, administration, and education and propagation.             Each chapter

examines the given category's teachings or     institution~   both as they are
described in official Baha '1 literature1 and as they are being taught in
rural Nalwa.    In addition, at the end of each chapter data regarding the

h as b een c1te      By comparing the structural manifestations
with the normative formulations     deductions are made as to the degree of
institutional development that has taken place in these communities.

Chapter 7 presents the fundamental doctrines and beliefs of the Baha'i
Faith.   The discussion is primarily concerned with those doctrines which
have traditionally been referred to as theological or metaphysical.         The
bases for this information have been the works of the founder of the Faith,
Baha'u'lliih, and his son 'Abdu'l-Baha.      Only official Baha'i translations
have been used, that is, translations which have been published under the
auspices of the Baha'i World Faith.       As stated at the outset of this
introduction, the present vork is concerned vith the Baha':l Faith in its
contemporary form.    As it exists today it is no longer a 'Persian' religion.

areas and not illustrations of overall community development.

Since its development into an internacional organization, the Baha'i
Faith has had its scriptures translated into numerous world languages, the
most prominent of which in terms of volume has been English.             In fact,

~

outside of Iran,English has become the unofficial language of the Baha'i

'
Faith.

> °
> From the point of view of this study the opinions held by present
day Baha'i orthodoxy are considered important, for they reflect the
doctrines which are currently being promulgated both in India and other
countries throughout the world.         Therefore, as the iWrk is being written
in English, the official translations are of greater value than the Persian
originals themselves.

The following works of Baha'u'llah were used in the preparation of
this chapter:       The Kitab-i-Iqan (Book of Certitude), revealed in Ba~dad
in the year 1862 as a reply to the questions of a certain         ~aji   Mirza Siyyid
MuJ;ammad;     crhe Hidden Words, composed in Bal:l.b_dad in the year 1858;   The

several compilations composed of various tablets and meditations have been

and Paris Talks.     Another source containing abundant material regarding
Baha'i doctrines is a collection of table talks presented by 'Abdu'l-Baha
to a Baha'i pilgrim, Laura Clifford Barney, in the prison city of •Ak&a

title of Some Answered Questions.      Finally, the author also consulted

the same pattern of construction as Chapter 7.       In both instances, after
presenting the theoretical teachings involved, the means and methods by
which they are being introduced into the rural areas are examined.           This
information is then supplemented with specific examples taken from the five
'model village' communities.      Besides making use of the above listed works,
in writing this chapter the author also consulted:       the Universal House of
Justice's recent publication, A Synonsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-
Agdas, a summary of the basic laws and ordinances laid down by Baha'u'llah;
Baha ':1 Prayers, a standard Baha'i prayerbool<;   Bah a' 2 News, an A.'llerican
periodical;    several Indian publications including The Ilew Garden and Bahai
Git {Baha'i Songbook);     and correspondence from both Shoghi Effendi and
the Indian National Spiritual Assembly.*

Chapter 10 analyzes local Baha'i administrative institutions.         As
well as introducing the Faith's doctrines and devotional institutions into
village communities, the Baha'i Administrative Order is also attempting
to establish administrative institutions within their confines 1fhich can
act both as catalysts for community development and linkf of communication
with the rest of the Baha' 2 world.     These institutions are not only being

introduced in India! but in every community around the world where Baha'is
reside, and their establishment and development is an essential part of
the Baha'i movement's consolidation plan.     In formulating this chapter
several primary works have been consulted including the previously mentioned
writings of Shoghi Effendi as well as two sources published by Baha'i
agencies in Great Britain and the United States, Principles of Baha' 1
Administration and The Baha'i Community.     Following the pattern of other
chaptersJthe author first describes the normative formulations of these
institutions and then notes how they are being established and nurtured
in the villages of rural Malwa.

The final chapter in this section, Chapter ll, states the Baha'i
position regarding community education and propagation.     It is primarily
concerned with describing the educational institutions established by
the Baha' 1 Administrative Order in Halwa, specifically, seasonal schools,
regional conferences, and village primary schools.     In addition, it briefly
examines the role villagers are playing in helping to propagate the Faith.

Chapters 7 through ll are essentially descriptive in nature.        While
some degree of analysis is contained within their pages the main analytical
discussion has been reserved for the Conclusion.     Drawing on the data
supplied in the body of the workJthe final chapter attempts to make some
comprehensive statements concerning the aims and accomplishments of the
Baha'i Faith in Malwa.

Ill

A basic Question with which we must come to terms at the outset of
this study is the one concerning the meaning of the statistical figures
cited in the above paragraphs.    In India there are almost four hundred
thousand declared believers, and i.n t<lalwa over one hundred thousand
villagers have declared their belief in Baha'u'llah.      Yet, in terms of

individual commitment what do these figures really indicate?         Of' course
the author realizes that the query is one that can never be answered
sufficiently.   The very act of asking such a question assumes that there
is an objective measure for determining an individual's faith, which
there is not.   However, from a sociological point of view certain indices,

such as attendance at religious functions, acceptance of' certain doctrines,
and participation in passage rituals;often denote, if not the strength of
an individual's belief, at least his degree of' involvement with religion
as a social institution.     In terms of the Baha'i community in India,
however, information of this nature is not available, and the large
number of' villages in Malwa alone where declarants reside (6,572) makes
the acquisition of such data virtually impossible.       Consequently, at
this time the best one can do to come to an understanding of the situation
in India in general and Malwa in particular is to rely on the information
supplied by those persons who have been most active in the teaching '10rk
within the country.

According to individuals who hold positions of leadership within the
Baha'i community in IndiaJthe Baha'i population can be divided into two
basic categories.     On the one hand there are the declarants who are
considered 'deepened' Baha'is.     This category includes those believers
who are well-informed about the history, doctrines, and teachings of' the
Faith and participate on a regular basis in the movement's various socio-
religious institutions.     This group would amount to less than     1%   of the
total number of declarants in India and would be found mainly in urban
areas.   Most of' the individuals in positions of leadership in the
community come from this segment of the Baha' f population.        On the other
hand there exists the great mass of village declarants who can be
considered 'undeepened' Baha'is.     While they have   decla~ed   their belief
in Baha'u'llab as a prophet, in terms of behavior they are still

essentially Hindu.         Consectuently, when it is said that today there are
four hundred thousand Baha'is in India, this statement must be ctualified
by adding that for close to Cf}% of the declarants being a Baha' '[ means
little more than having made an assertion on an ideological level of
the acceptance of certain religious doctrines and social concepts.
However, such declarations should not be dismissed as being completely
insignificant.         The fact that a large number of villagers in rural
Nalwa have made these assertions is indicative that there is potential
for change in the villages.        In fact, it is the faith in this possibility
that has led the Baha'i Administrative Order to undertake a campaign of
educating new declarants in the various aspects of Bah~'i community life.
An example of this faith can be seen in the following lines taken from
an unpublished essay written by one of the leading Baha'i teachers in
India:

> Baha'u'llah says that everybody on earth is capable
> to receive His Message and to know Him lfuo is the
> Manifestation of God on earth. About the creative
> power of the Word of God he says that "every liard
> that proceedeth out of the mouth of God is endowed
> with such potency as can instill new life into every
> human frame, if ye be of them that comprehend this
> truth. ll
Another C[uestion concerning the new declarants which must be brought
forward at this time is the one relating to their caste backgrounds.              Is
there any specific stratum of society from       ~rhich   the Baha 'f Faith bas
drawn its believers?       According to those teachers who have been most
active in Baha'i propagation activities in rural Jvlalwa, the initial years
of mass teaching (1961 - 1963) saw a large number of lm1er caste members
enroll in the Faith, particularly persons from those castes which have
traditionally been referred to as 'unclean' and 'untouchable'.            However,
11 Hooshmand Fat he a' zam, 'One Year Teaching Among the Hasses', unpublished
essay, p. l

with the advent of ne" teaching techniques in the mid-1960's 1ihereby
higher castes 1iere directly approached, many 'clean' caste Hindus also
enrolled.        Therefore, while in terms of numbers the majority of declarants
in Malwa would still come from the lower levels of society, in many of
those villages which have received the designation 'model village' a good
number of 'clean' caste declarants can be found, and many of the most active
Baha'is in the region come from this stratum of society.

IV

As has already been indicated, much of the data used in this study
was collected by means of personal contact with the Baha'i Faith in India.
The author spent six months in that country during which time he was able
to meet and intervie1i many of those people who are involved in directing
the movement's teaching and consolidation activities.        These included the
Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly, members of important national
and regional committees, a continental counsellor, institute teachers, and
travelling teachers.       Moreover, in lilalwa use was made of the technique
of participrult observation 1ihereby the researcher places himself in direct
face to face contact with his object of research.        This meant participating
in teaching institutes, conm1ittee meetings, teacher training sessions, and
devotional meetings, as well as making several trips to local Bw1a 1 i village
comrnuni ties.

As a technique of social research participant observation has been,
to say the least, a controversial issue among leading methodologists.
Those who diminish its value as a research tool point out the problems of
observer and subject biasJas well as the large amount of subjective
judgement inherently involved in the procedure.        For example, a well-known
research team notes that 'The mere presence of the observer means that
movements are made and orientations are developed toward him which would

.                    12

not other>nse have occurred. '      Consequently, many sociologists feel that
quantitative methods of data collection, such as survey or sampling
techniques, are much more useful in terms of analyzing material and
developing sociological generalizations.     On the other hand, those who
support participant observation argue that it is the most direct method of
gathering information.    As Howard S. Becker and Blanche Geer state in
their article 'Participant Observation and Interviewing':

> The most complete form of the sociological datum,
> after all, is the form in which the participant
> observer gathers it; an observation of some
> social event, the events which precede and follow
> it, and explanations of its meaning by participants
> and spectators, before, during, and after its
> occurrence. Such a datum gives us more information
> about the event under study than data gathered by
> any other sociological method.l3

In a similar vein, another researcher has remarked that in India 'The
officially sponsored surveys are usually quantitative, and they seldom
succeed in getting behind a mass of figures and tables t. come to grips

with the realities of social processes at the village level. •

In the present work participant observation was a vital necessity, as
it supplied the author with information which could not be obtained by
quantitative methods alone.     It allowed him the opportunity to see at first
hand the in-process workings of a religious organization, a situation which
could not be recreated by questionaires or structured surveys by themselves.
Thus, participant observation served the vi tal function of supplementing
the information received from written sources and informants with directly
perceived phenomena.

Most of the research could be carried out in English.         As stated
earlier, all of the Baha'i writings that are of consequence for the
movement's current activities are available in English.         Furthermore,
nearly all of the individuals holding positions of leadership in the Indian
Baha'i community are able to converse in this medium. 1 5       Accordingly, most
of the official records concerning the development of the Faith in India
are available in English.      In addition, a working knowledge of Hindi was
useful for reading certain sources relating to the local village         corr~unities,

and more importantly, for communicating with some of the resident village
teachers.

Before closingJit would be appropriate to make a few comments concerning
the choice of village communities to be visited.       In   se~ecting   these
communities two factors were considered.      First, as was stated earlier,
data from 'model villages' was desired:     those communities which have had
closer contact with the educational efforts of' the Baha'i Administrative
Order.      Second, the author wanted communities with varying status group
compositions.      Consequently, he selected one community which consisted
mainly of' 'low' caste declarants, one community which was predominantly
'high' caste in membership, and three communities which displayed more of a
mixed caste composition.      From among these 1 the majority of data came from
the mixed caste communities, as they presented situations in which the effect
of Baha'i social principles could more readily be observed.         It should also
be noted at this time that the names given to the village communities in
the study are pseudonyms.      This procedure has been followed mainly for the
protection of the villagers.      Since they provided the author with field data

he believes they are entitled to a certain degree of anonymity.    The
general location of each village, however, has been given both in the body
of the work and on map ii'Ji3.
In 1917 E. G. Browne wrote the folloving:

It is hoped that the data presented in this study, although limited to
a specific region of central India, will shed some light on the question
Brovne found impossible to answer and thereby add to our knowledge of the
Baha'i Faith in particular and the human religious experience in general.

Part I   Historical Development

Chapter 1             The Origins and Growth of the      Bah~'f   Faith
The Bah~'f Faith has been most directly influenced by Isl~, notably
the Shf 1ah sect of that religion, as Shf 1 ism has been the national religion
of    Ir~n   since the early sixteenth century (1502).                  Examples can be seen in the
concept of progressive revelation, the doctrine of the                     im~ate   and its
theological implications, the rejection of an official priesthood, and the
concept of the community of believers.                  In addition, there are numerous minor
similarities ranging from religious terminology to style and method of prayer.
In the course of this work many such influences will be noted, but first we

...

must turn our gaze to mid-nineteenth century Iran and trace the origins of the
new movement.

On the evening of May 22, 1844, in a small apartment in the city of
Shfr~z, a young merchant by the name of Siyyid                1

as numerous Shf 1 ah divines had recently beenannouncing the imminent appearance
of such an individual.                  The most renowned of these divines had been Shaykh
AQmad Zayni'd-Dfn ~s~'f (1743- 1826), founder of the Shaykhf school, and his
main disciple and inheritor of the school's leadership after his death, Siyyid
K~zim-i-Rashtf (1793- 1843).                  The former was considered the most learned of

prior to his declaration 1 Alf-Mu~ammad had been a pupil of Siyyid K~zim.

The Bab, as Siyyid      1Al'L-!1u~ammad    came to be known, soon gathered
around him seventeen disciples known as the 'Letters of the Living', 4
and instructed them to inform the inhabitants of Persia and •Iraq of his
appearance.     In October of 1844, having dispersed sixteen of the 'Letters'
on their mission, the Bab along with one other disciple, Quddus, left on
pilgrimage to Hecca and Medina.
During the Bab's absence.the word of his declaration quickly spread

'

throughout his home province of Fars, so much so as to raise the fury of
the conservative divines of Shiraz. 5              As a result, several Bab1s were
arrested, and in June of 1845 the Governor-General of the province, Husayn
Khan, hearing of the Bab's expected return, comrrrissioned a body of horsemen
to journey to Bushihr, the port of disembarkation for returning pilgrims,
and bring the the young Siyyid back to Shiraz where he was to be placed in
confinement.      Moreover, 'His followers were prohibited from discussing
his doctrines in public, and some of the more active were beaten, mutilated
and expelled from the t01m.       1

the Bab was insulted and struck in the face.                 Finally, at the behest
of a maternal uncle who agreed to keep him in his home away from public
view, the Bab was released.

The Bab, however, did not remain in isolation.             During the following
year he was constantly embraced by his new disciples with vhom he openly
consorted and to whose listening ears he dictated numerous tablets.
Consequently, in September of 1846, Husayn ](han once more issued orders
for his arrest.      'rhe Chief Constable of Shiraz, 'Abdu' l-~amfd Khan, was
requested to carry out the orders, but their issuance coincided with an

home, where upon arriving he fou.'1d his sons strici,en with the disease.
According to the account of the official Baha'i historian, Nah11-i-A 4 ~am,
the Bab cured his sons, causing the thankful Constable to approach the

Governor-General for his       release~       The accuracy of this account is

In the last
days of September, 1846, the Bab left for I~f'ahiin.

In I~f'ahan the Bab apparently won the heart of' the Governor-General
of' that ancient city, Manuchihr Khan, f'or the government official protected
him f'rom the wrath of the local 'ulama, seventy of' whom had declared the

Bab a heretic and condemned him to death.      For f'our months he enjoyed
the Governor-General's protection, during vhich time both the number of'
his followers      andJas a consequence, his opponents continued to mount.
The movement had by this time become so wide spread that the Shah himself,

.
Muhammad Shah Qajar, began to take personal interest in it·.

the death of Manuchihr Khan in March of' 1847, the Shah issued orders f'or
the removal of the Bab to the capital.

The Bah, however, was not destined to reach Tihran.       During the
journey to the capital his escorts received two messages:          one f'rom the

The fortress of Mah-Ku is situated on a mountain peak overlooking
the city from vhich i t is named.        Located in the province of Adharbayjan
in the extreme north-'Jest of Iran, it is but a short distance from the
Aras river and the meeting place of the Russo-Turkish frontiers.               In this
fortress, a'Taiting an interviev that vould never ts.'<e pldce, the Bab 'Tas
lodged for close to nine months.         During this time he produced one of his

On April 9, 1848, he 'Tas transferred to the castle of Chihr1q, located
in the vicinity of the region knovn today as Ri~a' 1yyih.        He   ~:vas   moved
as a result of a request submitted by a Russian minister in Tihran who
feared a possible disturbance so close to the Russian border. 14              The Bab
initially remained in Chihr1q for three months.         Apparently, during his
first stay in the castle prison he began referring to himself not only as

the Bab, but as the qa'im. 5      As ftLrza ~lusayn of Ha.rnad§:n states in his

time, the dictates of expediency,and the capacity of men, declared himself
to be the ~a'im;        though some think that he made this declaration during

the latter days of his residence at MaKu. '                Perhaps for this reason,
as well as the continued success of the movement throughout the realm, in
July of 1848 the Bab was summoned to Tabr1z by orders of the Grand Vizier
to be examined by a panel of divines in front of the Crown Prince,
Nasiri 'd-Dln Mlrza.

During his examination at Tabriz the Biib was asked by ~ajf Nulla
Ma!pnud, the Ni~amu' l- 1 Ulama, if he claimed to be the mahd1, the Lord of

Religion, to which the Bab responded- 'yes•.
was present at the interrogation ,reported the Bab stated the follmdng:
'And I swear by God that I am that person whom you have been expecting
from the beginning of Islam until now;        I am he whom forty thousand doctors

will deny.            According to E. G. Browne, during the trial the divines
of Tabriz mocked the Bab, asking him obscure questions about Arabic
grammar and reproaching him for not being able to respond to their demand
to perform a miracle.         Browne summarized the events as follows:

> That the whole examination was a farce throughout,
> that the sentence was a forgone conclusion, that

which they proceeded to build a fortress.       The presence of over three
hundred Babis in a fortified garrison led the Sa'idu'llUlama of Hazindaran

approximately three thousand Babis led by Hujjat-i-Zanjan:L (a local divine)
withstood the onslaught of over eighteen of the Shah's regiments.                                                                                                                                     The
operation drew the attention of the British envoy, Lt-Col. Sheil, who on

September 5, 1850, reported that                                                                   •••    these fanatics are reduced to a few

their defeat was only a matter of time, and in the end the great majority
of Babis at Zanjan either met with death or were imprisoned.

Two months after the start of the Zanjiin insurrection tile Bab was once
again summoned to Tabrfz, this time by                                                                         Na~iri'd-Din                           Shah's new Grand Vizier,

In the noonday sun of Tabr1z on July 9, 1850, the Bab(having received
his death warrant from Hulla Hu!1armnad-i-Mamaqan:i) was suspended by rope
along with one other disciple on a wall in the citadel square.           Three
rmm of 250 soldiers opened fire. 28       \/hen the smoke rose the Bah was
nowhere to be seen, but he was soon found in a nearby recess whence he was
returned to the scaffold and once again fired upon, the second volley of

bullets taking the desired course.        The two bodies were subsequently
dragged through the city streets and finally thrown on the edge of the
city's surrounding moat.
The death of the Bah dealt a great blow to his followers.         Constantly

attacked, they were no>r forced to accept the fact that their         promised one'
had been taken from them.     In the midst of such despairJ in August of 1852
three young Babis made an attempt on the life of the Shah.       ~'heir    ill-
conceived plan failed and brought upon the much persecuted Bab1 community
even greater governmental and ecclesiastical vengeance.       'rhe Great

readiness to meet death that made the Babees Gic] so formidable to their

assailants.'

The doctrines of the Bab were never systematized into a coherent
whole.       This was largely due to the fact that except for a short period
in Shiraz the Bab was isolated from the majority of his followers.                  It
is true that a number of his leading disciples meeting in the hanuet of
Badasht in July of 1848 decided that the movement          ~Jas   not just an offshoot
of Islam but an independent Faith, a ne\J Dispensation vhich repudiated
old laws and established new ones. -

32     However, the absence of the Bab
detracted from their attempt to formulate doctrine.               But doctrine was
not the real issue.         The Bab attracted followers by means of his personal
charisma and his claim.         In this sense he serves as a perfect example of
Max Weber's concept of prophet where ' ... the personal call is the decisive
element distinguishing the prophet from the priest.               The latter lays
claim to authority by virtue of' his service in a sacred tradition, while
the prophet's claim is based on personal revelation and charisma. • 33
This charismatic quality which drew individuals to the Bab was expressed
by his first disciple,      l~ulla ~Iusayn,   when recalling his first meeting
<~i th   his master said:

> That holy repast refreshened alike my body and
> soul.   In the presence of my Host, at that hour,
> I felt as though I <~ere feeding upon the fruits
> of Faradise ••• Had my youthful Host no other claim

> received me with that quality of hospitality and

As mentioned earlier, tl1e Bab claimed to be the gate to the imam
mahdf     and at later date to be the ga'im himself.        E. G. Brovne claims
that the Bab sav himself as the latest spokesman for God, the Eternal
Essence, Who had revealed Himself to numerous prophets in the past and
would continue to do so in the future. 35       Consequently, the Bab did not
claim to be the final mouthpiece of the Divine.         According to Browne,
in the Persian Bayil.n emphasis ' ..• is laid on the doctrine that this
revelation is not final, but that believers therein must continually expect
the coming of "Him whom God shall manifest': vho vill confirm vhat he
pleases of the Bayil.n and alter what he pleases ••• ,36      To this hope, the
appearance of 'Him whom God shall manifest', the mass of bewildered Bab{s,

vhom God shall manifest'.           Baha'u'llah expressed this experience in
the following words:

Baha' u' llah   <~as   subsequently released, possibly due to the prestige
of his family and the intervention on his behalf of a Russian minister
in Tihran, but he was exiled by order of the Shah to Ba~dad, never
again to return to his native Persia.            On January 12, 1853, together
with several members of his family Baha'u'llah began a two month journey
westward.

Upon his arrival in Ba~dad Baha'u'llah found the cummunity of Bab:Ls
(most of <~hom had fled to Ba~dad to avoid further persecution) in a state
of utter confusion.            'The community of the Bab, harassed ruod hounded ruod
heart-broken, was in grave danger of succumbing to forces of reckless

nihilism within its own rruoks.'             After remaining in   Ba~dad   for one
year, during which time he shared the leadership of the community with
his half-brother, qubl)-i-Azal (the person the Bab had made the inheritor
of community leadership grruoted he abdicate if 'Him whom God shall manifest'
should appear 40), Baha' u' ll<ih, not yet having declared his revelation,
alone ruod on foot left for Sulaymiin:Lyyih.

Then, in Harch of 1856 he returned

Balla 1 u 1 llah remained in Ba.eJ:cdad for seven years.   During this period

he revealed        three of his best known writings:       Kitab-i-Iqan (The Book
of Certi twle, Kalim3.t-i-1•1aknllnih (The Hidden Herds), and Haft-Vajl (~
Seven Valleys).       The first contains runong other themes an explanation of
the symbolism contained in the New Testament and the G;ur an;           The Hidden
Hords is a distillation of the eternal verities;            while The Seven Valleys
is an example of Baha 1 u' llah 1 s mystical prose.        At the same time,
Baha 1 u 1 lliih played an active role in helping_ reconstruct the Babi community,
1<hich had sorely declined since the death of the Bab.

Baha 1 u 1 llah 1 s active participation in the life of the Babi community
in Ba.eJ:cdad had t1<o consequences:    first, it engendered a breach between
himself and his half-brother       ~ubJ;l-i-Azal,   a split >rhich was later to have
important ramifications for the movement;            and second, it aroused the wrath
of several local divines and subsequently the hostility of the Persian
Consul-General in Ba.eJ:cdad, Hirza Buzurg Knan.          The latterJby means of his
vivid letters portraying Baha 1 u 1 llah as a threat to the security of the
empireJinduced the Shiih to instruct his Foreign Minister, Mirza Sa'id
Khan, to direct the Persian Ambassador in Constantinople to make
arrangements with the Ottoman government for Baha 1 u 1 llah's deportation to
Turkish territory.        An extract from the Foreign Ninister' s letter reads

\[41\] 'He betook Ourselves to the 'dlderness, and there, separated and alone,

ConsequentlY, in March of 1863 Baha'u'llah received a letter from          •.hi
Pasha, the Grand Vizier of the     Sul~an   of Turkey, which bade him journey
to Constantinople.     While tarrying for twelve days in the Najiblyyih
Garden, he announced to his companions before departing that he was 'Him
whom God shall manifest'.      It was the twenty-second day of April, 1863.

Baha'u'lliih and his companions in banishment arrived in Constantinople
on August 16, 1863.      There they lingered for four months m<ai ting a
decision from the government as to their fate.          In December of that year
they learned they were to be sent to Adrianople.          Following a twelve day
journey through ice and snow they arrived at their destination.

It was in Adrianople that the breach which began in Ba££dad between
Baha' u 'llah and Subh-i-Azal widened into an unbridgeable lacuna.          In this

but the appointed heir to leadership of the Babi community refused to
recognize his claim.      He and his followers asserted that it was impossible
that one revelation should so soon be abrogated by another.45           Hence, from

this time forward there were two groups >dthin the old Biibi community:
those who followed Baha' u 'llii.h were known as Baha'is;      and those who
took the side of   ~ub~-i-Azal   were termed Azalls.      By and large the

great majority of former Babis supported Baha   u I llah.

'  46
The growing enmity between the two groups (characterized by examples
of open hostility) as well as the continual strea~ of Baha'i pilgrims who
came to see their new master      began to cast suspicion in the eyes of the
Turkish authorities as to the intentions of the community.              Conseg_uently,
a decision was finally reached whereby Baha'u'llah and a number of his
companions were to be banished to the penal colony of 'ft~ka, a small island
situated in the bay near Haifa (Israel), where murderers and political
agitators from all parts of the Ottoman Empire \rere consigned, while
:;>ubJ;l-i-Azal and his followers were to be sent to    Fama~:;usta,   Cyprus.     Thus,
on August 12, 1868, the already twice banished band of Persians once again
began a journey into exile.

Baha'u'llah and his family reached 'Akka on August 31, 1868.                Until
October of 1870 they (along with approximately seventy other Baha'is)
1crere kept under closed confinement in the citadel barrac'"s.           During this
period several followers became ill and died, and Balla 1 u' llah' s you.Dger
son 1faS killed 1fben he fell through a skylight.        The group was finally
transferred to a local caravanserai, vhile Baha 1 u 1 llii.h and his family were
lodged in a small bouse within the city \ralls where tlley remained for nine
years.     After this time the restrictions placed upon Baha'u'llii.h by the
local authorities were somewhat relaxed, and he was allowed to occupy two
houses outside the city proper:      the .first located .four miles north of
'Akka, where he dwelt for two years;         and the second, a neighbouring abode
known as the mansion of Bahj1,     ~<here   he remained until his death in 1892.

'P~ka
During Baha'u'llan's exile in

1   numerous Baha'is from throughout
the Near East came on pilgrimage to the prison city.              Initially the most
they could hope for would be to catch a glimpse of their master from
beyond the city's moats, but as restrictions were gradually lifted they
were permitted to call on him in person.           Bahj1 became    ~he   center of
such activity, and it was here that the Cambridge Orientalist, E. G.
Browne, met Bah a' u' llah in person. 47

In both Adrianople and 'Akka Baha'u'llah penned numerous tablets.

These writings can be classified into roughly four categories:              laws and
ordinances, prayers and meditations, interpretations of past scriptures,
and discourses and exhortations.      Among these, two compositions stand out
in their magnaminity:    the Suriy-i-Huluk (Surih of Kings), and the Kitab-
i-Agdas ( The Host Holy Book).      The former, composed in Adrianople,
collectively addressed the major kings, rulers, and ecclesiastical leaders
of the world.    This exordium was later supplemented by letters sent to
individual rulers frbm 'Akka.      Included in the list of recipients were
«h1 Pasha, the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, the ecclesiastical
leaders of Sunnf Islam, the French Emperor, Napoleon III, the Czar of
Russia, Alexander II, Queen Victoria, Pope Pious IX, the rulers of the
Americas, and numerous others.      In these tablets:

> He called upon them to take fast hold of the "Nost
> Great Law"; proclaimed Himself to be "the King of
> Kings" and "the Desire of all Nations"; .. . exhorts
> them to be reconciled among themselves, to unite and
> to reduce their armaments; bids them refrain from
laying excessive burdens on their subjects, who, He

informs them, are their "wards" and "treasures";
> enunciates the principle that should any one among

A special tablet was likewise sent to the Shah of Persia, Na~iri' d-D:ln
Shah.      As Lord Curzon reported, the messenger who carried this tablet
' ••• received the penalty of his rash presumption by being branded to death

with red-hot bricks.'        The Kitab-i-Agdas     was revealed at Bahj:l in

This book not only set     down the laws and ordinances of Baha'u'lliih's
religion, it also established a line of succession for his cause and
ordained those institutions that would ensure its future unity.

Like the Bab, Baha'u'llah claimed to be a manifestation of God, an
appointed spokesman for the Sacred.         Ho1'ever, there were two major
differences in their ministries.         First, while the Bab directed his
message primarily to the Islamic world, Baha 1 u'llah also made his claims
known to leaders of the Occident.         He claimed to fulfill not only the
expectations of Sh:l'ah Islam       but the prophecies of other religious
traditions.     For example, in the epistle to Pope Pious IX he announced

that 'the Word which the Son concealed is made mru1ifest.'            Likewise,
his letter to the high-priests of the Zoroastrian religion proclaimed that

'the Incomparable Friend' is manifest.           Second, Baha'u'llah was able
to codify his message to a much greater extent than was the Bab.            The
latter's ministry lasted only nine years, most of it being spent in
isolation, while from the time of his declaration in       Ba~£dad   until his
death in 'Jl.kka Baha'u'llah had almost thirty years in which to elaborate
upon his teachings.     Although he too was kept a constru1t prisoner, the
numerous pilgrims that attended their master both in Adrianople and 'Akka
allowed him to maintain regular communication with his followers, ru1d

consequently, in terms of doctrines, laws, and institutions, the teachings
of Baha'u'llah are much more coherent and intact.

Baha' u' llah' s main doctrines, ><hich shall be examined at greater
length in subsequent chapters, can be summarized as follo><s.       There is
only one God, the transcendent and omnipotent Source of' the universe, Whose
Essence can be comprehended by no man.      Ho><ever, from time to time God
reveals Himself to certain individuals (manifestations) ><ho in turn reveal
to men principles by ><hich they should live their lives.      The commandments
Of God vary in accordance to the needs and exigencies of the time, but
their purpose is al><ays the same:    to draw men both as individuals and
as societies closer to the knowledge of the Sacred.      Being the latest
of God's messengers ><hose dispensation will last not less than a thousand
years, Baha' u' llah has the right to abrogate the lavrs and institutions of
the past and introduce ne>< ones.     The core of Baha'u'llah's social
teachings is the concept of the oneness of mankind.      All men regardless
of race, sex, religious background, or economic status are considered
equal in the eyes of God, and should therefore treat each other as equals.
Consequently, in the Baha'i Faith, as in Islam, there is to be no priestly
hierarchy.   Instead, there should exist a community of believers sharing
similar status.    The sole source of authority vrithin the community is
the manifestation and his duly appointed successors, be they individuals
or institutions.      The point to be stressed, however, is that Baha'u'llah
spoke with the authority of the Sacred, and his various decrees are
therefore to be follo><ed unhesitatingly.

Through his ovrn efforts Baha'u 1 llah was able to lift the Babl: community
out of its despair.      He was able to capture and transfer to himself the
charismatic qualit.ies of the Bab, and in so doing steer the movement on
its new course - that of a ><orld religion.     The powerful   irr~ression   he

made upon his followers was summed up by the poet Na'im when he sang:

> \lhy should we not see a hundred thousand souls
> His sacrifice?
> \lhy should we not see a hundred thousand hearts
> bewitched by Him? 52

Upon his death in May of 1892 the Suli;an of Turkey was notified by
telegram that ' the Sun of Baha

/ has set ' •53
After the death of Baha' u' ll8.h the leadership of the movement passed
to his eldest son,        1Abbas     Effendi.   In his last testament Baha'u'llah
alluded to 'Abbas Effendi's position as interpreter of b's writings, 5 but

when the latter claimed leadership of the Baha'i community,Baha'u'llii.h's
younger son, Nlrz8. Mu~amrnad 'Al:l, refused to recognize him, asserting that
his elder brother had concealed part of his father's testrunent.
SubsequentlyJall but two of Baha'u'llah's immediate family took the side
of H:lrza Mul}arr.illlad 'Al:l.      However, the large majority of Baha'is throughout
the Hear East followed 'Abbas Effendi, and after several years of intra-
community conflict M:lrza Huqammad' s group ceased to carry much influence
in the Baha'i ranks.              At this time 'Abbas Effendi took the title of

'Abdu'l-Baha          (the servant of Baha) by which he was later to become known
throughout the Baha'i world.

Although still a prisoner of the Turkish government, in 1894

'Abdu'l-Baha gave his approval to a Lebanese convert to introduce the
teachings of Baha 1 u 1 ll8.h in the United States, thereby initiating a new
phase in the growth of the religion.              Until this time the movement's
believers had come only from the East.              Under the leadership of 'Abdul-Baha
the Baha' 1 Faith was destined to be established both in 1\urope and

North America,

Following the fall of 'Abdu' l-Ham1d' s Ottoman government in July of
1908, 'Abd 'ul-Baha was finally released from captivity;       he was sixty-five
years old.      Three years later, in August of 1911, he left for Ylars eilles
and for the next three months addressed various groups both in London and
Paris concerning his father's teachings.         These groups ranged 1n
constitution from Archdeacon Wilberforce's congregation to Annie Beasant's
Theosophical Society.      After wintering in Egypt 'Abdu'l-Baha again
journeyed westward, this time to the United States and Canada where he
remained for over six months.         During his visit he traversed the entire
continent, lecturing from New York to California.         His subjects on these
occasions varied from talks on the nature of man to discussions about
economic principles for the modern world, but he ah1ays stressed one point,
namely, that Baha'u'llah had lived for the explicit purpose of raising
mankind to a new level of spiritual existence.         By the time 'Abdu'l-Baha
returned to the Holy Land in December of 1913, after a second trip to
Europe and a five month stay in Egypt due to poor health, numerous Baha'i
groups had been formed both in Europe and in North America •

During the war years (1916-1917) 'Abdu' 1-Baha penned the Tablets of
the Divine Plan in which he outlined a teaching campaign that would take
the message of the Baha'i Faith to 120 territories and islands.           At this

time the movement had followers in only thiro/-five countries ;' and the
initiation of the plan would have to wait until 1937 when its administrative
institutions would be strong enough to support such a campaign, but the
dark hours of World Har I could not diminish lAbdu' 1-Baha' s vision.

On November 28, 1921, 'Abdu 1 1-Baha died.    For twenty-nine years he
had been the recognized leader of the Bahil '1 Faith.      His charismatic

\[56\] Balyuzi, 'Abdu '1-Baha, p. 424

qualities    though somewhat different in nature than those of the Bab or
Baha'u'lliih were none the less compelling, as is witnessed by the
impression he   ler~   on numerous individuals both in Europe and North America.
He was not a manifestation of God; he did not claim to receive revelation
from the Sacred.       Baha'is believe, however, that 'Abdu'l-Baha was

divinely inspired and guided         and therefore contact with the Sacred did
not cease with the death of Baha'u'llah but was seen to be manifest in
the living example of hrs eldest son.

The leadership of the Baha'i community next passed to Shoghi Rabbani,
known more commonly to Baha'is as Shoghi Effendi. *      A grandson of   1 Abdu'l-

Balla, he was only twenty-four years of age when he learned he had been
appointed Guardian of the Baha'i Faith by declaration of his grandfather's
last will and testament.       The young man suddenly found himself the leader
of an emerging world religion whose adherents resided in thirty-five

\[58\] The official position of the Baha'i Faith regarding the station of
'Abdu' 1-Baha was stated by Shoghi Effendi as follows: 'He is, and

countries~        The task to which he dedicated his life involved not only
expanding this number but constructing a viable administrative system
which would link the various Baha'i communities throughout the world and

allow them to interact with one another.            A new day had come to the Cause,
new methods were required.        This was to be the era of emancipation of the
Faith, of recognition of its independent status, of the establishment of

its Order, of the up-building of its institutions.'

From his headquarters in Haifa, Israel, the center of the Baha'i
world, Shoghi Effendi began his task.        From the beginning of his
Guardianship he set out to establish the Baha'i Faith as an independent
religion.        Up to this time the Faith had been closely tied to Islam;     it
had been reared in its milieu and had deeply imbibed of its heritage.
While not denying this parentage Shoghi Effendi consciously attempted to
wean the young movement:

> Shoghi Effendi never set foot in the Mosque
> whereas 1 Abdu'l-Baha had attended it until the
> last Friday of His life. What local people had
> suspected- that the Baha'i Cause was really

> Palestine, during many years vrhen it 1-1as forbidden
> to even mention the name Bah8.'l, the Guardian now
> did overnight and began to encourage the Baha'is to
> likewise do in different parts of the world.60

Shoghi Effendi was unexpectedly aided in his efforts when on Nay 10, 1925,
the Egyptian law court of Beba, after hearing a case in which a small
village headman had demanded that the Muslim wives of several local Baha'is
be granted a divorce on the grounds that their husbands w -re heretics,

stated that:

Between the years 1923 and 1937 Shoghi Effendi personally directed
several projects.     These included sending teachers to different parts of
the world, translating literature, and guiding the construction of the
Baha'i temple in Wilmette Illinois.          The most important task he undertook
during these years, however, was the strengthening of national and local

Bah6.'i admlnlstratlve lnstltUtlons.

During the lifetime of lAbdu '1-BahaJ a national body which
administered the affairs of the various cownunities under its jurisdiction
had been introduced in the United States and Canada.          Before the
establishment of this institution there had existed throughout the world
only scattered local communities whose activities were rarely co-ordinated.
By 1934 Shoghi Effendi had created additional national bodies in Persia,
'Iraq, India-Burma, Great Britain, Germany, Ego~t-Sudan, and Australia-
New Zealand.     The National Spiritual Assembly assumed grave responsibilities,

' .•• for it has to exercise full authority over all the local Assemblies
in its province, and will have to direct the activities of the Friends,
guard vigilantly the Cause of God, and control and supervise the affairs

of the Novement in general.            Such institutions were only established
in countries where there existed a strong base of local communities.        Until
such time as other countries and regions of the Balla' f •rorld developed

this base, their local communities were guided by the Guardian himself.

Under the directive of Shoghi Effendi, in 1927 the American community
adopted a Baha' '[ National Constitution which set down the powers, duties,
and functions of the National Spiritual Assembly and gave it a firm basis
in la1v.        This Constitution in turn set an example for t,1e various national
spiritual assemblies throughout the Baha' :L world to follow.             Likewise, the
By-Laws of the Spiritual Assembly of the Bah8.' is of the Cjty Of New York,
drafted in 1931, served as a model for every local community around the
globe. 64         By means of constant letters and telegrams Shoghi Effendi
advised the various institutions, both national and local, how they should
conduct their affairs in accordance with the teachings of Baha'u'll8.h and
1Abdu   1
1-Bahii.   In such a way he   '<!aS   orienting the com1nunities towards the

common goal of becoming unified bodies directed from a world center.

In 1937 Shoghi Effendi launched the first of three systematic
teaching campaigns designed to spread the message of Baha'u'llah across
the entire planet.         Thus 1Abdu 1 1-Baha' s scheme as set dmm in the Tablets
of the Divine Plan was finally initiated.                Known as the Seven-Year Plan,
it was directed mainly towards the American community.                Its goals
included the establishment of one Baha'i community in every state of the
United States, province of Canada, and republic of Latin America.                 In
addition, the various countries in which Baha'i corruuunities existed were
called upon to extend teaching activity, increase the translation of Baha'i
literature, develop Baha'i educational courses, and work towards the
purchasing of properties or buildings to be used as future national centers.
By the time of its completion in April of 1944, the goals of the Plan as
regards the Americas were achieved, and the nUII1erous Baha'i commwli ties

throughout the world had been both numerically and structurally
strengthened.

After a two year respite1 the Second, Seven-Year Plan was begun.      Like
its predecessor, it called on the Baha'i communities in various countries

J

to continue to expand their activities in the vital areas of teaching,
publication of literature, and community education.     Horeover, it outlined
a systematic teaching campaign for Europe similar in objectives to the
previous operation in the Americas.

The latter years of the Second Seven-Year Plan saw the introduction
of two new institutions on the international level:    the International
Baha'i Council, and the Hands of the Cause.     The former, composed of
eight members appointed by the Guardian and designed to be the forerunner
of a future Baha' f international court ,66 initially served the purpose of
providing a link between the Faith and the new state of Israel.      The
second was a group of nineteen individuals (later expanded to t1?enty-seven)
also appointed by the Guardian, 1?hose duties 1?ere to help propagate m1d
protect the Baha'i Faith.:   Each Hand was assigned a specific area of the
1?orld in which he 1?as to consult with local and national institutions
regarding their teaching efforts.     He also formed a vital communicative
link bet1?een the communities under his jurisdiction and the Guardian in
Haifa.

The success of the Second Seven-Year Plan 1?as marked by the creation
of four new national spiritual assemblies;  national bodies \Jere formed in

Central America, South America, Canada, and Italy-S\fitzerlm1d, bringing
the total number of such institutions in the Baha'i world to twelve.       At

the conclusion of the Plan in 1953, Shoghi Effendi felt that the movement
was no\J strong enough to launch its most ambitious program of expansion.

Four international teaching conferences held successively in Kampala,
Uganda, Wilmette, U. S. A. , Stockholm, Sweden, and !lew Delhi, India
signaled the advent of the Ten-Year Crusade.       Shoghi Effendi notified all
Bahii ''[ communities around the world that:

> Feel hour propitious (to) proclaim (to the) entire
> Bahii'1 world (the) projected launching (on the)
> occasion (of the) convocation (of the) approaching

> remaining Sovereign States, Principal Dependencies,
> comprising Principalities, Sultanates, Emirates,
> Shaykhdoms, Protectorates, Trust Territories (and)
> CrownColonies scattered (over the) surface (of the)
> entire planet. 68

The major objectives of the Ten-Year Crusade included;doubling the number
of countries in which the Faith vas established from 131 to          260; doubling
the amount of translated literature, doubling the number of temples in
the   <lOrld from two to four: and quadrupling the number of national
spiritual assemblies to forty-eight.

In the midst of this world-wide project Shoghi Effendi suddenly died.

In November of 1957 he succumbed to a heart attack in London after being
bed ridden by a case of' the Asiatic flu.      The Bahii '1 <rorld   \laS   initially
in a state of shock.      Shoghi Effendi, the architect of the Balla '1
AdL~inistrative   Order, vas now gone.   He had appointed no successor;           the

Faith stood leaderless.      In this state of emergency the Hands of the Cause,

meeting in Haifa, assumed leadership of' the movement.       From this time
until the end of the Ten-Year Crusade in 1963 they constituted the
highest institution in the Baha'f world.

In April of 1963 elected delegates from throughout the Baha'f world
met in London to take part in the Baha'i Horld Congress, an event marking the
completion of' the Ten-Year Crusade.      By this time the number of countries
and territories opened to the Faith numbered 259 and the number of
national spiritual assemblies stood at fifty-eight.        At this meeting the
Baha'is elected a body of nine men known as The Universal House of Justice

'

which was accorded the distinction of becoming the paramount administrative
institution in the Baha'i world.       Until the passing of Shoghi Effendi the
Baha'i Faith had ·always been dependent on a specific individual to
interpret its scriptures and direct its activities.        Hith the election
of the Universal House of Justice the leadership of a charismatic
individual came to an end.

The Universal House of Justice feeling that 'The great ;rork of
teaching must be extended, not only in those areas where mass conversion

is beginning, but everywhere.', in October of 1963 announced their
formulation of the Nine-Year Plan, to be inaugurated in April of 1964.
The goals of the new Plan included raising the number of local communities
in the world to 13,700 and increasing the number of national spiritual
assemblies to 108.     It also called for the translation of literature into
133 additional languages.      In the \Wrds of the Universal House of Justice
the driving aim of the plan was, ' .•• to carry the Hessage of Baha 1 u 1 llah
to every stratum of society, not only in the towns and cities but also
in the villages and country districts where the virus of' materialism has

had much less effect on the lives of men ••• '

IJhen the Nine-Year Plan ended in April of 1973 the Baha'i Faith was
no longer an 'obscure sect of Islam'.       It had established itself as an
independent world religion, being recognized as such by the state of
Israel.     Furthermore, it had introduced its institutions into more than
three hundred countries and dependencies throughout the world and had
developed an efficient system of administration.       It had broken the bonds
of geographic isolation and become a full-fledged internotional movement.

A perusal of the short history of the Baha'i Faith reveals several
themes of analytical interest.      The first concerns the prophets' means
of legitimatizing their claims.       It has continually been stressed
throughout this chapter that both the Bab and Baha'u'llah were individuals
possessed of dynamic charismatic qualities and that their claims to
prophethood were largely based on these qualities.       For example, when
asked for a substantiation of his claim during the     ex&~ination    at Tabriz,
the Bab responded by asking his examiners iiho else had the power to reveal
so many verses of scripture in such a short period of time.          This recalls
the answer given by   Mu~ammad   twelve hundred years earlier when he used his
creation of the Qur'an as a proof of his station.       In a like manner, the
followers of Baha'u'llah pointed to the power of their leader's verses as

proof that he was 'Him whom God shall manifest'. Hence, although the two men
professed to fulfill the prophecies found in past scriptures, thus adding
an element of apologetics to their assertions, it was the self-generated
charisma which they felt to be the Sacred :dthin them tl:-'t was the decisive
factor.     Again one can not help but notice the precision iiith which their

personal qualities and characteristics match Max Heber's ideal type of
the ethical prophet.

The second theme involves what may be termed the transference of
authority.          One of the central problems in the history of religions has
been the question of the maintenance of legitimate authority.            As Max
Heber points out, after the prophet makes his claim there generally follows
a period of routinization during which a religious community arises through
a process ' ••• whereby either the prophet himself or his disciples secure
the permanence of his preaching and the congregation's distribution of
grace, hence insuring the economic existence of the enterprise and those
vho man 1."t ....   ,73   The main issues have always been;first, who has the
authority to assume the leadership of the community after the prophet 1 s
death; and second, in what sense is this authority related to the Sacred?
In fact, it is over these very issues that the major divisions within
many of the world's religious communities have resuJ.ted, the classic
example of such a rift being the one which occurred after the death of
Mul)ammad and divided the Islamic world into two mainstreams, Sunni and

During the development of the Balla 1 i community the question of
legitimate authority has arisen at each stage of transition:            Baha 1u'llah's
claim to leadership of the Babi community was challenged by           ~ub~-i-Azal;
'Abdu'l-Baba's authority was contested by his half-brother Hirza Huhammad
'Ali;     Shoghi Effendi faced the antagonism of 1Abdu'l-Baha's private
secretary,    A~d         Sohrab;   and the Universal House of Justice had to deal
with the rebellion of one of the Hands of the Cause, !-las on Remey.          However,
in each instance the overwhelming majority of community members sided with
those individuals to whom the immediate power fell, and conseq_uently the

\[73\] Heber, p. 60-61

Baha'i    Faith has to this day averted a major break within its ranks
capable of realistically challenging the established claim to legitimate
authority.

One of the important characteristics of Baha'i leadership has been
its asserted relationship to the Sacred.          Both the Bab and Baha'u'lliih
claimed to receive direct revelation from God.            The official Baha'i
position concerning 'Abdu'l-Baha is that 'Whatsoever His tongue utters,
whatsoever His pen records, that is correct;          according to the explicit
text of Baha'u'lliih in the Tablet of the Branch.'

74 Thus, although
falling into a different category than either the Bab or Jaha'u'llah, his
word is accepted by Baha'is as being inspired by the Sacred.               Likewise~
Balla ''is hold that Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice by
the power granted to them by 'Abdu' 1-Baha        are divinely guided.      As
'Abdu'l-Baha's last will and testament reads:

> The sacred and youthful branch, the guardian of
> the Cause of God as well as the Universal House
> of Justice, to be universally elected and established,
> are both under the care and protection of the Abha
> Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of
> His Holiness, the Exalted One (may my life be offered
> up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God. 75

Therefore, in the tradition of Shi'ah Islam the Baha'i Faith maintains
that contact between God and the leadership of His community has not been
severed but progressively continues.

Finally, during both its early years of growth in Persia and its later
expansion throughout the world the Baha'i Faith has attracted followers
from various social and economic bacl<grounds.           Lord Curzon found them in
every walk of life from the ministers of the royal court to the scavenger

Hence, it is difficult to argue that the movement is
solely the manifestation of a specific socio-economic class.           Rather, it
appears that the       Baha'~   Faith is a product of a world whose rapidly
collapsing civilizations, be they characterized by an overt rationalism or a
dogmatic traditionalism, have failed to answer, both individually and
socially, the basic problems of modern man.

The   Baha'~   Faith sees its historical mission as being that of creating
the foundation of a new world civilization, and therefore its teachers are
attempting to impart the Faith's message to the masses of mankind.            One
country with which the movement's connections can be traced back to its
earliest years of historical development, and one which has subsequently
become a center of mass teaching activity, is India, and it is to this
land that we shall now turn our attention.

Chapter 2           The B&ha'1 Faith in India

India's earliest contact with the new movement took place during the
time of the Bab.           The various histories of the Bab make mention of
several prominent Indian believers.               Nabll-i-A (~am te1ls us that one of
the 'Letters of the Living' was an Indian known as Shaykh Sa'1d-i-Hind1.
Like the other disciples of the Bab, he was directed by his master to
spread the message of the new revelation.                 This command took him not only
to various parts of Persia              but also to his homeland of India.      His work

in India, however,was unproductive.               As Nab1l states, '       the latter was
productive of what might seem a negligible result, its on y fruit being the
convers1on o f a cer t a1n
.   '  'd ... ,l

s1yy1                     After this, Shaykh Sa 1 1d-i-Hind1
dropped from sight, his ultimate fate remaining a mystery.

Another Indian convert during the ministry of the Bab was a certain
blind Siyyid,       Jen~b-i-Ba~1r,       about whose life the Babf histories are not in
complete agreement.           Nab1l states that this believer was none other than
the above mentioned Siyyid converted by Sa'1d-i-Hind1 in the town of Multan,
where 'Casting behind him the trappings of leadership, and severing himself
from his friends and kinsmen, he arose withafixed resolve to render his

share of service to the Cause he had embraced.'                  On the other hand,
The Tarfkh-i-Jadld claims Siyyid             Ba~1r   heard of the Bah's appearance in
BoJJihay from where he hastened to Mecca and met the Bab in person. 3                 A:rter
this meeting he returned to Persia and began to disseminate the teachings
of his new master.            Both histories agree, however, that he became active
within the Bab1 community, and that he was known for his eloquence and

depth of learning.

The activities of Jenab-i-Bas1r were finally brought to the attention
of the state authorities.         The Tari'kh-i-Jad1d says that after the
Mazindarffil upheavel Siyyid Ba~1r went to 1Iraq where he was eventually
arrested by the Prince-Governor in BurUJird who, ' ... because be was so
ready of speech and eloquent in discourse, first ordered his tongue to be
cut out, and then put him to death.'

4   Nabll says he     \Vas   arrested in
Luristan where after being tortured, he eventually succumbed. 5                It is
clear from both accounts, therefore, that Jenab-i-Ba~1r never returned to
his homeland.
A third convert from India was a dervish mentioned in The Tar1kh-i-Jad1d

under the title of 'the Indian believer•.               This is most likely the same
individual mentioned in Nab'Ll' s account who had seen the Bab in a vision
and soon hastened to Persia on foot to find the imam mahdl.                The dervish
met the Babin Chihr1q where the latter gave him the title Qahru'll1ih. 7
After leaving the Bab's presence,'the Indian believer' began to expound his
leader's doctrines.         This eventually led to his being ar12sted in the city
of Khuy where the new convert along with several other Babls was beaten

and paraded through the streets on an ass.               If indeed 'the Indian
believer' was the same Qahru' lllih mentioned by Nab1l - the likeness of the
two accounts making it appear to be so - he later, following orders from
the Bab, left on foot for India where he was to announce the appearance of
the qa' im~      Whether or not he successfully returned to India is unknown.

'fhat there were other Indian believers present in Persia during the
time of the Bab is made apparent by Hahjur's monograph on the Babi

During his stay in Bombay Jamiil Effendi delivered a great many talks
concerning the claims and. principles of the Baha'l Faith.             One such talk
was directed tm1ards the head of the Khoj a conmmni ty, the Aga Khan.
However, rather than bringing converts to the Baha'i         Fait~    his discourses
aroused the animosity of numerous religious leaders, and consequently th.e

their initial stay in the great port city was cut short, Bomhay <ras
subsequently to become one of the leading Baha'i communities in India.

After leaving Bombay the two men travelled throughout the
subcontinent delivering the message of Baha'u'llab to the elite of the
country:

> the high officials and princes and princesses of the land. 11
In 1876 an historic gathering was held in the old Mughal capital of
Delhi.     The event was the assumption of the title 'The Empress of India'
by Queen Victoria.      Present at this ceremony were all the rulers of the
various states in India, as well as numerous religious and secular leaders
of the country.      Jamal Effendi used this timely occasion to reveal the
message of the Baha'i Faith to many of the dignitaries.           For example, he
was able to meet and talk with Swami Dayanand Sarasvati, founder of the
Arya samaj.

The movement's initial reception in India vias a mixed one.          In   lllOSt

instances Jamal Effendi was met with consideration and courtesy.             There
were, however, several exceptions to this gentility.           As previously

mentioned, he met with hostility in Bombay, and at later date he
experienced similar antagonism in Calcutta.         Altogether, the fruits of his
labor seemed negligible.                                          ""' Effendi

During a year's travel in India Jamal
had managed to convert only a handful of individuals.         When he left the
subcontinent in 1878 to carry the teachings of Baha'u'llat to the countries
of South-east Asia, he left behind him three prominent converts:
Ra,:fld-din Khan of Hasanpur, J;Iaj1 Rama!;lan of Rampur, and Siyyid   Mu~~afay-i-

~ ~              13

R= of Madras.          The latter was destined not only to give great service
to the Faith in IndiaJ but also in Burma where he helped establish two
Baha'f groups, one in Rangoon, and another in 1Ylandalay. 14

The next twenty years was a period of slow growth and development for
the Baha' 'L Faith in India.    The message of the movement was spread via
the work of devoted converts to the major cities of the subcontinent.          Teaching
activities were directed from three centers of Baha'1 organization:
Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras.       Many of the programs were presented under
the auspices of the Theosophical Society, while others were carried out by
individual believers in their own way and by their own means.          Slowly the
claims of the Baha''L Faith began to reach the ears of many of the educated
members of Indian society.

During his years of leadership, 'Abdu'l-Baha sent several prominent
Baha'f teachers to India to help promote the movement.        Among these were
Mfrza Mal_lmud-i-Zarqan1, and Aga Mlrza Ma.loram.    The latter finally settled
in Bombay where he played a leading role in the Baha'i community, while
M1rza Mahmud-i-Zarqan1      toured the country and eventually returned to his
nat1.. ve p ers1.a.    Both men by means of their zealous spirits helped enhance
teaching activity throughout the country, and by the year 1908 there were a

number of Bal18.'l local spiritual assemblies (co.m._rnunities of nine or more
believers) established in India including assemblies in Bombay, Calcutta,
Aligarh, and Lahore.        Of these, the Bombay community took the forefront
in both the teaching of the Faith and the translation of literature.                     Its
advancements in the area of translation marked the first time any of the
writings of   Baha'u'll~~   had been translated into one of the native
languages of India.      The activitQes of the Bombay community were commented
upon by a travelling American Baha!1, Sydney Sprague, who in 1908 reported,
'There are three meetings a week held in Bombay and there are as a rule

eightY to a hundred men present.    1

He also emphasized that it was not easy
to become a Baha'1 in India.        'It often means a great sacrifice on the part
of a believer, a loss of friends, money, and position.• 17

In January of 1910 a convention comprised of members from the various
religions of India was held in Allahabad.              The Bah8. 1 :ls were invited to
this convention, and Siyyid Mu;!afBy-i-RUrni, one of Jamal Effendi's original
converts, presented a talk which was enthusiastically received by the
delegates.      As a result of the interest --shown at the convention           it vas
decided that teaching activities in the subcontinent should be accelerated , and
arproximately one year later a national teaching campaign was launched.
The program called for the election of a nineteen member teaching council
vhich would co-ordinate propagation activities across the entire country.

The council officially came into existence during the early months of 1911.

Two female American Ball8.'1s    >~ere   very prominent during the campaign,
and their influence was felt by the various Baha'S: communities in the
subcontinent.      One, Lua Getsinger, was personally directed by 'Abdu'l-Baha
to travel to India and spread the Faith.              'Just as 'Abdu'l-Bata had sailed

from West to East to do the same thing. ,l9          The other teacher, Mrs. H.
Stannard, a student of comparative religion,answered a call for assistance
put out by the Indian community.       For several years these two dedicated
women delivered lectures from one end of the countr; to the other.                Lua
Getsinger spoke on various aspects of the Bah a'       J: Faith at numerous meetings
sponsored by such groups as the Arya Samaj, the Brahmo Samaj, and the
Theosophical Society.      In addition to har lecture tours,        ~1rs.   Stannard
represented the Baha':l religion at the All-India Theistic Conference of

1913\.        Both women were also responsible for the publication of Bah a' J:
articles in several Indian newspapers.       For example, in the Sind Gazette
of December 24, 1913, an editorial appea~which stated that:

> than any of the Congress and Conference dignitaries - is
> Mrs. Stannard, the Baha'i Missionary. This gifted lady,

The popular response that the t\>O Americans received throughout their
travels "as portentous; in future years American believers \>ould continue to
play aD active role in the teaching campaigns of the Indian corr@unity.

Although not vrinning many converts to the movement" the teaching
campaign vas still of great importance to the development of the Baha' 1
community in India, as i t marked the first real attempt to systematically

activities were i'or the most
part efforts of individual comrmmities;. rarely was there en attempt made to
organize anything beyond the local level.          Thus, the Teaching Council of
1911 was in many ways the forerunner of the National Spiritual Assembly of
the Baha'fs of India and Burma.

December 27-29, 1920, is another significant       lanQ~ark    in the history
of the Baha'f Faith in India.        It was on these dates that the First All-
India Baha'1 Convention was held in the city of Bombay.            Hepresentati ves
of all the major world religions were present, as well as Bah a' f delegates
from throughout the country.       Although there are no official figures on
the number of Baha''fs residing in India during this time, it was estimated

that there were nearly 175 followers present at the Convention.

There were several important resolutions passed at the Convention from
which the following were taken:

> 1)   that i'unds be collected to build a Baha'1 temple in India;
2)   that a school be started in Bombay for the education of

Baha'f children;
> 3)   that a Baha'1 library be established in Inc.a;
4)   that a publishing society be established to translate

Baha'f literature into different Indian languages; and
5)   that there be a greater expansion in teaching activities and

distribution of literature.
It was to these objectives that the Balra'fs of India now turned.

It is significant to note that the First All-India Baha' 1 Convention
and the death of 'Abdu'l-Baha were separated by less than a year. It was
as if the Indian community sensed the new course the movement cmuld take

under the guidance of Shoghi Effendi.       From this point forward the Bahfi • l
comnn.mi ty in India - in accordance with the Guardian's plans for the Faith
throughout the world - iias     to an ever increasing degree    to become oriented
toiiards executing its teaching plans iiithin the framework of an
international administrative structure, the center of which was the Guardian
himself.

Between the years 1921 and 1938 the objectives initiated by the First
All-India Baha'i Convention were pursued vigorously.         Consequently, there
were notable accomplishments in all areas of endeavcr.          ?ne guidance of
these projects was entrusted to the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Ban' is of India and Burma, which Shoghi Effendi saw fit to create in April
of 1923.    The role he bequeathed to this body is evident from the contents
of the following message sent in November of 1925:

> I pray that your newly constituted National Spiritual
> Assembly may grow from strength to strength., may
> co-ordinate and consolidate the ever-expanding
> activities of the friends in India and Burma and
inaugurate a fresh campaign of 'reaching that vill

redound to the glory and power of the Most Great Name.

The National Spiritual Assembly, composed of nine individuals elected by
delegates of the various local communities in India and Burma, met
periodically in Bombay.       Ten years later, in January of 1933, it was
incorporated with the government of India.

Organized teaching activities and the distribution of literature were
greatly increased during these years.       One of the largest teaching events
took place at the centenary celebration of the birth of' the founder of the
Arya Sa.rnaj, Dyanand Sarasvati.     The commemoration was he--; d in Mathura in
the year l925,and the Baha'is were granted special camp grounds where they were
allowed to distribute their literature.       During the five day event almost
five thousand booklets explaining the principles of' the Faith "ere

The Guardian constantly encouraged the Baha'i community of India and
Burma to increase their teaching activities.            He continually stressed
that it was part of their duty as Baha'is to spread the message of
Bah   a•u • uB.h.    For example, in a message to the Baha'is of India dated
November 25, 1934, he said; 'The essential is that all the friends, 'rithout
any exception whatever, should realise the full measure of the
responsibility which Baha'u'llah has placed on them for teaching far and
wide his Message.•

At a later date he reiterated that '. . . an
unprecedented effort in the field of teaching is urgently required.             Such
an effort is of vital and paramount importance. • 27

In an effort to stimulate teaching activity, Shoghi bffendi sent
several teachers from various parts of the world to the subcontinent.
Among the most famous of these travelling teachers was an American convert,
Miss Martha Root.           She made two tours of India, one in 1930 and the other
in 1937-1938.        A short synopsis of her work shows she delivered public
lectures from Karachi to Madras, including major presentations in the
colleges and universities of Lahore, Amri tsar, Ludhiana, Delhi, Aligarh,
Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad, Benares, Patna, and Calcutta.            She also
broadcast radio messages in both Mysore and Hyderabad           and met with many
of the leading personalities of the country including the poetess Nrs.
Saroj ini Naidu.       Her work was so impressive that the National Spiritual
Assembly of India and Burma in a letter to the Baha' 'Ls of the United States
said of her, 'Martha Root has opened the whole of India for us, and it now

. .              .    28

devolves upon us to so utlllze these openlngs.

There were numerous other teachers who took to the highways and railways
of India during these years in order to help spread the lmowledge of the
Faith to a greater number of the subcontinent's inhabitants:                 .

Mr. Mahfuz- ..

'ul' ~ag_ 'Ilml carried on active propagation in Delhi; Professor Pri tam Singh
made several teaching tours of the colleges and universities of northern
India;   Mrs. Shirin Fozdar spoke to more than a thousand people in the town

hall of Calcutta        ; and Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehler made a two month lecture tour
of the major cities of the country.        Therefore, the teaching work which
Shoghi Effendi prescribed as a vital necessity to the advancement of the Faith
in India was systematically increased.

Advancements were also made in the field of publishing between the years
1921 and 1938.      Many Baha'i books were translated into several different
Indian languages including Gujarati, Bengali, Sindhi, Hindi, and Urdu.                 One
of the most internationally well known introductory books on the Faith,
Dr. J.E. Esselmont's Baha'u'llah and the New Era, was one of these texts.
Shoghi Effendi had personally encouraged the Baha'is of India to translate
this work.      In March of 1932 he wrote; 'I wish to urge you to take as soon
as you possibly can, the necessary and most effective steps to ensure the

translation of Dr. Esselmont's book into Urdu and Gujrati. •            Another
major publishing accomplishment was the establishment of a Baha' 1 monthly
magazine, the    Kau~ib-i-Hind.     The magazine was published in Urdu and had
over 200 subscribers.        In addition, over 200 articles appeared in newspapers
and magazines throughout the country including many articles in Telugu
speaking areas.

Concerning the other goals which the First All-India Baha'i Convention
had set for the Indian community, the following can be related:           A Baha'i
school for children was successfully established in Poona, and in September of'
1937 the first Indian Baha'i Summer School session was held;          Baha' 5' books

vere presented to a nwnber of major libraries arotmd the country;       and
construction of a Baha'I Center was begun in Karachi.

The efforts made by the Baha'i community in India during these years
increased the public's knovledge of the movement.      Furthermore, under the
guiding hands of Shoghi Effendi and the National Spiritual Assembly the
various Baha'i communities throughout the country    beg~~   to function as a
unit.      The time had come when Shoghi Effendi could truly speak of the
'Indian community'.      However, even with the inter-community organization
that marked the period,the number of new converts to join the movement was
practically nil;     over the eighteen year period only three ne\I local
spiritual assemblies had been added to the list of assemblies in the country.

One of the characteristics of teaching activity during this period was
that it was by and large directed towards the educated elite of the country.
In fact, ever since its inception in India the movement had been closely
connected with the intellectuals and leaders of the country.        Even though
as early as 1933 (when referring to translation work) Shoghi Effendi had said,
'I would urge you to concentrate your energy on this important and essential
preliminary to an intensive campaign of teaching among the masses in India.~

his advice went virtually unheeded,      Lecture tours and university visits
were capable of reaching only      certain strata of society, and,as previously
noted>these were the types of activity that predominated.       Perhaps for
this reason, the number of converts in India remained infinitesimal.

When in 1937 Shoghi Effendi initiated the Seven-Year Plan in the
United States, the Indian community meeting in convention in Karachi
suggested to the National Spiritual Assembly that a similar project be
started in India and Burma, and conseq_uently the National Spiritual Assembly
resolved to undertru<e a Six-Year Plan which would   con~ence   in 1938, but due

31 Shoghi Effendi, 'Hess age of March 24, 1933' , Dawn of a Ne'w Da'r, p. 42

to lack of funds, it 1<as not until     1940 that any real action 1<as taken.

It   liaS   the Guardian who finally set the project in motion by earmarking money
for the creation of' a special teaching fund to help finance the Plan.                  In
this regard, his secretary relayed that:

> He trusts that this will stimulate the body of Indian
> and Burmese Baha'is also to contribute to this Fund
> generously and by providing the necessary means to
> enable them to speedily fulfil the task they he'"'e
> avowed to carry out.32
The Six-Year Plan contained several distinguishing characteristics
which were not found in previous teaching plans.           Until this time most
teaching activities had involved lecture tours in co-ordination with
various reform movements such as the Arya Samaj, the Br~o Samaj, and the
Theosophical Society.        In the past there had been very little contact            ~<ith

sections of society outside the intellectual circles.           ~'he   new Plan
attempted to change these policies.        No longer were only the large cities
visited, but efforts were also made to hold meetings independent of' other
groups in smaller cities and towns.        Hare importantly, the emphasis was
shifted from teaching tours to the establishment of residences throughout
the country.        Individual Baha'is now left their homes and moved to areas
where they could address a larger segment of the population.             Hence, a
conscious effort was made to direct the teachings of the Faith towards a
different social stratum.

Once undernay, the Six-Year Plan produced immediate results.               By   1941

three new local spiritual assemblies had been formed:         one in Hyderabad,
one in Kota, and one in Bangalore.       As was his custom, Shoghi Effendi
wired the Indian community3 congratulating them on their achievements and

urging them to continue their eff'orts.         The next year saw three more
local spiritual assemblies established, and Baha'i Groups (communities
whose members total less than nine) were formed in Secunderabad, Belgaum,

and Uj jain.        By the time of the Fourteenth Annual Balla '1 Convention held
in Poona in 1943, eight new assemblies had been formed.           The rigorous
teaching efforts continued during the final year of the PlanJ resulting 1n
twenty-nine local spiritual assemblies being established in the subcontinent

by 1944.

The achievements of the Six-Year Plan encouraged the Indian Bah a rs:
community to launch another teaching campaign starting in April of 1946.
A month before its inception Sboghi Effendi (writing from Haifa to the
National Spiritual Assembly of the Ba..lla '1s of India and Burma) remarked:

> The believers in India have set an inspiring example
> to their fellow-believers throughout the East, and
> even to the great mass of their co-religionists in
> Baha'u'llah's native land, and have abundantly
> demonstrated to them all, what organized activity,
> boldly conceived and soundly and energetically
conducted can achieve when directed and animated by

> the ennobling influences and the generative spirit of
> the Faith of Baha'u'llah.35
Although marred by the disruptive events brought upca the subcontinent
by the partition of Pakistan and India in July of 1947, the Four-Year Plan
met with much the same success as had the previous Six-Year         Fla..~.   By Apri.l
of 1947 another eight local spiritual assemblies had been founded, ru1d the
same number of groups had been established.          In addition, each summer1
Baha'i schools for both children and adults were organized.            Due to these
encouraging figures the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma
received nearly six hundred pounds sterling from Baha'i communities
throughout the world to finance yet another teaching project, and as a
consequence, in 1951 India embarked on its third successive teaching
campaign.

One of the major accomplishments of' India's third teaching project
occurred in the area of translation and publication.           'I'he language problem
had always been a major roadblock for Baha'1 teachers in India, and during

3 4 The Baha'i World, vol. IX, p. 63

the third campaign a determined effort was made to bridge the communication
gap by translating publications into as many as fifteen different languages.
As a result, over four thousand books and pamphlets were sold and distributed.
Also, between the years 1951 and 1953 eight new local ?Piritual assemblies

were established        , and by the end of 1953 there were approximately seven-
hundred Baha'is in India.

In October of 1953 the fourth and final Intercontinental Teaching
Conference, which had been designed to inaugurate the Ten-Year Crusade/was
convened in New Delhi.        The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is
of India, Pakistan, and Burma 37 hosted the gathering.       Other participating
National Spiritual Ass:emblies included the United States, r::anada, Central
and South America, Persia, 'Ir~~. and Australia and New Zeal~~d.       Mason
Remey, a Hand of the Cause and the Guardian's representative at the Conference,
delivered Shoghi Effendi's message, which enumerated forty-one new
territories and islands within the Asia Teaching Mission to be opened to the
Faith during the Crusade •       In this message he said of the Asiatic Continent:

> ••• the cradle of the principal religions of mankind;
> the home of so many of the oldest and mightiest
> civilizations which have flourished on this planet;
> the crossways of so many kindreds and races; ... such
> a continent, so privileged among its sister continents
> and yet so long and so sadly tormented, now stands at
> the hour of the launching of a world-encompassing
> Crusade, on the threshhold of an era that may recall, in
> its glory and ultimate repercussions, the great periods
> of spiritual revival which, from the dawn of recorded
> history have, at various stages in the revelation of
> God's purposg for mankind, illuminated the path of the
> human race. 3
The 450 Baha'1s present at the Conference not only outlined strategies
for the upcoming Crusade, they also engaged in a program of public relations.
A reception held in one of Delhi's large hotels was attended by over

a thousand persons, and delegates were also sent to meet with government
leaders including the President and Vice-President of India             as well as the

Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.            When the closing prayer of the final
session had been chanted on October 15, 1953, the Indian c0mmunity once again
found itself embarking on another teaching project; one lfhich by the time of
its completion in 1963 would have completely revolutionized the composition
of the Indian Bah a' 1 community.

While not seeing any outstanding numerical increase for the Baha'i
community in India, the 1950's contained tlfo important events >rhich should
be noted.     One was the separation of the India, Pakistan, and Burmese
National Spiritual Assembly into three distinct bodies: Pakistan received
an independent national Spiritual Assembly in 1957, and Burma became
separate in 1959.      The other occurrence, although minor at the time, proved
to be an omen concerning the future direction the movement \fould take in
India.      It involved the first village teaching conference i.n India held in
village Rampur (near Benares) where several villagers had earlier been
converted.     Several recommendations came from this conference lfhich were
important in terms of their future implications.            First, it was requested
that the National Spiritual Assembly print up simple leaflets in Hindi to
be distributed in nearby villages.            Second, it was sugge ted that study
classes in Hindi be established in Rampur, and finally, it ~<as recommended
that city Balla' 1s interact   ~<ith     Rampur' s inhabitants by participating in

their religious festi valsJ thus creating an atmosphere of friendliness.

The modern period of Baha'i history in India began in 1961.             In that
year Hand of the Cause Dr. R. Muhajir, while making one of his frequent
trips to the subcontinent, decided that a village conference similar to the
one in Rampur should be held in central India.            As a result, in January of

3 9 Baha'i Ne>rsletter (India),   .:If   93, March, 1958, p.3

-     - !,o
that year a conference was held in village Sangirnanda,          located in Shajapur
district of Madhya Pradesh in the region knovm traditionally as Malwa.              At
the conclusion of the conference a great many villagers enrolled in the
Faith, and word of this occurrence spread to nearby villages.           Chapter 3
will examine in greater detail the subsequent events that followed the
conference, but for now, suffice it to say that within the next few years
a great tide of villagers declared their belief in Baha'u'llah.           In other
areas of India the B~~a'1 communities having taken note of the events in
Malwa began directing their teaching activities towards viclage communities.
Consequently, in the following years the number of both declared believers
and local spiritual assemblies in India mushroomed.          A message from the
Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land to the National Conventions of the
B~~a'   S: World in April of 1962 reflected this increase:

> India, one of the first countries in the world to receive
> the light of a newly-born Revelation has, during the past
> year, witnessed a tide of mass conversion not only wholly
> unprecedented in that country but without parallel anywhere
> in the entire world during the last one hundred years of
> Baha'i history. 41

The statistical report issued by the Indian National Spiritual Assembly
in July of 1973 (Table l) graphically demonstrates the growth of the Faith
during recent years.

As the statistics reveal, the number of declared believers in India
jumped from less than a thousand in      1961 to close on ninety thousand by
March of    1963, an increase of approximately eighty-nine thousand in two
years.      By the end of the Universal House of Justice's Nine-Year Plan in
1973, this number had risen to close on four hundred thousand.                   It had
taken nearly ninety years for the Baha'1 community in India to reach the
thousand mark in population, and then suddenly within a twelve year period
this figure was multiplied four hundred times.

The natural question which arises when one exrunines these figures is,
'Hhat was the cause of this sudden upsurge?'          In many instances the

Question is not an easy one to answer.      Many of the Indian Baha'is claim
that the recent growth was a sprouting of the seeds that had been planted
by earlier teachers.      \mile this answer may contain some grain of truth,
it seems evident that during these years there were certain new approaches
in teaching methods which set them off from earlier programs.

The most obvious change was that after 1961 teaching activities were
for the most part directed towards the village    populatio~   of the
subcontinent.      The Rampur conference had been the forerunner of this shift
in emphasis, and with the advent of the Sangimanda conference the Baha'i
teaching mission in India was converted from a primarily urban movement to
a rural oriented crusade.     As a result, the Indian Baha'i community became
known throughout the Baha':l world as a 'mass teaching' community, that is,
a community whose resources are directed towards teaching the Baha'i Faith
to the rural uneducated masses of humanity.      In fact, India   \?aS   one of the
first countries in the world since the time of the Bab and Baha'u'llah to
orient itself towards the masses.

In conjuction with this shift in goal directionJthe community out of
necessity began to reorient its teaching methods.       Before the mass teaching
era the B&1a'i community in India was more closely allied with Islam than
with Hinduism.     This development was only natural, as the early pioneers
to India had come from Persian backgrounds and were therefore more apt to
communicate with individuals who shared a similar cultural heritage.
Thus, in terms of language, theology, and cultural symb.ls the Baha'i Faith
had much more in common with Indian Islam than it did with Hinduism.               In the
1960's a conscious effort was made to relate the Baha'i message to the
Hindu tradition.      The masses of Indian villagers were rooted in this
tradition, and if the Baha'i Faith was to speak to these people it \<auld
have to do so in concepts and symbols that they could understand.           F'or
example, Baha'is in India had tended to identify the Bab and Baha'u'llah
with the §g_i 1 ite religio-cultural symbols of the ga'im and the ·.1am J.!usayn,

Needless to say, in Hinduism these   SJ~bols   have no meaning.    There is
in Hindu cosmology, however, a concept of the Sacred manifesting Itself
into the world in order to destroy evil doers and re-establish righteousness.
This is the doctrine of the avatara, most succinctly expressed in the
Bhagavad Gita.    In order to more adequately communicate their message,

Baha'i teachers spoke of Baha'u'llah as an avatara.          He was identified
with that One who periodically descends into the world.       As Krsna explains
to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita:

> Wnenever there is a decline of righteousness and rise
> of unrighteousness, 0 Bharata (Arjuna), then I send
> forth (create incarnate) Hyself. For the protection
> of the good, for the destruction of the wicked and
> for the establishment of ~tghteousness, I come in
> to being from age to age.

Furthermore, the only requisite for becoming a Baha'i was acceptance of
Baha'u'llah as an avatara, a marked contrast to earlier teaching approaches
which demanded a new declarant to have a relatively thorough knowledge of
the Faith before he was allowed to become a member of the community.

One innovation during this period which may have been partly
responsible for the large increase in declarations was the opening of three
teaching institutes in Indore, illysore, and Gwalior. 45    One of the main
functions of these institutes was to train travelling teachers, and
consequently.; special courses were given in methods of explaining the basic
teachings and institutional structure of the Faith to uneducated villagers.

43 'l'his is not to say that before the mass teaching era Baha'is in India

> had not referred to Baha 'u' llah as an avatara. For example, at the
> First All-India Baha'i Convention in 1920 Mr, Ayer gave a lecture
> which identified Balla 'u 'lliih with the avatara tradition. Rather,

44 Bhagavad Gita, IV, 7-8, English trans. hy S. Hadhakrisllnan, (New York,

1948), p. 154-155
45 One of these institutes will be examined in Chapter 6 .

For added incentive exruninations were given at the end of training
periods, and as a result Baha.' i teachers ><ere better equipped to relate the
Baha'i message to the Hindu villager.

Of course, the efforts of individual Baha'i teachers during these
years cannot be underestimated.       The upsurge in enthusiasm which saw its

initial display following the first signs of mass conversion in ldalwa in
1961, seemed to boost the confidence of the Indian Bah a' 1 community. Hen
and women ><lho were before hesitant to move in the rural areas now began to
actively teach to this segment of society.       The Indian National Spiritual
Assembly spoke of this new dedication in the following dispatch:

> There is a young man who is going to many parts of the
> country with his car, leaving behind his young ;rife and
> children and aunt to look after his business, just to
> serve the Cause of God for the love of the beloved
> Guardian. There are many like him who have left their
> jobs - whether in business or the medical profession to
> move among the people. There are a few young men who
> have given up their college studies for one year to
> teach the Faith, saying that the studies could wait but
> the Crusade of the beloved Guardian would not last
> forever. These are a few examples of the upsu1ge of
> enthusiasm which have made our previous exploits pale.46
Today there are 397,054 registered believers and 4,412 local spiritual
assemblies in India, and the Universal House of Justice has set a goal of
greatly increasing both of these figures within the next five years.       The
Baha'i Faith has no><l reached a position in Indian society where it is no
longer unknown.    Since the time of its inception in the subcontinent the
Faith has passed through several stages of development.       Initially a small
band of Persian immigrants, it subsequently evolved into a small yet
internationally linked group of educated elite,and finally into a community
characterized by its large number of uneducated rural constituents.        This
last phase has no doubt been the most important, and it is one in which a
specific region in Madhya Pradesh has played an important role.        This region
is Malwa.

Chapter 3            The Growth of the Bah a' 1 Faith in Malwa

The region in India known as Malwa is the area of the modern day state
of Madhya Pradesh that is bounded on the north by the Gwalior hills, on the
east by the Bet1ia river, on the soutr1 by the plains of l'!emar, ru1d on the
1iest by the Chambal river.               ~lal1ia   proper may be described ' ..• as a
tabel-lru1d, in general open ru1d highly cnltivated, varied 1fith small
conical ru1d table-crowned hills ru1d low ridges, watered by numerous rivers
and small streams, ru1d favoured with a rich productive soil, and a mild
climate, alike conducive to the health of mru1, and the libPral supply of

The agricultural productivity of the region has always been widely
acclaimed in India.          In 1880 Sir John Malcolm co!Ih'llented in his A Memoir

of Central India that            •••    few parts of India 1fill be found to possess more

natural advantages, or to produce greater variety of gra1n.                           Included in
these crops are 1iheat, barley, corn, millet, sugar cane, ru1d cotton.                       In
addition, certain districts are known for their opium crops, the sale of
1ihich is controlled by the government.

The region contains two major            cities~:   Ujjain of traditional fame, ru1d
Indore, a modern industrial center.                    The former is situated on the banks of

of Akbar, Halwa was governed by several Huslim rulers who had asserted
their independence from the central authority in Delhi.       After Akbar 1 s

However, during    the rule of Aurangzeb there began a period of breakdown;,

By the middle of the eighteenth century the region had passed into the
hands of the Maratha chieftans.
The peak of Maratha power in Central India was reached during the reign

Having made the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II his puppet,
he became the virtual ruler of most of northern India.       His successor,
however, met with ill times and was finally forced to sign a subsidary
alliance with the British in 1817.      The other dominant Maratha chieftan
of the period, Malhar Rao Holkar, was likewise forced to conclude a peace
treaty with the British.     Consequently, although the l1aratl:ta princes
retained their domains and titles in Malwa, by the early nineteenth century
their power had come to an end.      Until 1947 it was the British rulers of
India who held the real pm<er in Malwa.

Wnen India's independence was finally recognized in 1947, the Holkar
State of Indore, the Sindhia State of Gwalior and Dewas (both in which
parts of Malwa vere poli tica1ly situated) , and t~<enty other states acceeded
to the Dominion.     In May of 1948 these states formed the Madhya Bharat

Union.     \</hen the government of India decided to reorga.rtize its member
states on a linguistic basis, the new state of Madhya Pradesh was formed
in 1956.     The state included within its borders the former states of the
Madhya Bharat Union as well as the British Indian province of Central
Provinces and Berar.

In socio-economic terms the region is characterized by its
predominantly rural population.      Four districts have less than 20% of
their population in cities.      The largest percentage of urban dwellers is
found in Indore district where 60% of the population lives in cities.
As one might expect, in a region which is predominantly rural, literacy
is not high.     Indore district has the highest literacy rate with 38% of
its population being able to read and write.       On the low end of the
scale is Rajgarh district where only 10% of the population is literate.
The percentage of scheduled caste* members ranges from 7% in Dhar district
to 23% in Shajapur district.      Table 2 portrays by district statistical
information relating to the above mentioned categories.

the term has become synonymous with 'untouchable' or Harij an.

The history of the Ba.l}a':l Faith in Malwa is contemporary; it was
only in 1942 that the first Baha' 1 pioneer settled in the region.          During
the early years of India's Six-Year Plan Shoghi Effendi was calling for
Indian Baha'is who resided in the major cities of the subcontinent to
disperse themselves to smaller cities an<i towns for the purpose of
spreading the message of the Baha'i Faith to a greater range of the
country's inhabitants:

> Smallness of numbers, lack of skilled teachers and
> modesty of means should not discourage or deter them.
> They must remember the glorious history of the Cause
> which ... was established by dedicated souls, who,
> for the most part, were neither rich, famous, nor
> well-educated, but whose devotion, zeal and self-
> sacrifice overcame every obstacle and won miraculous
> victories for the Faith of God.    Such spititua..
> victories can now be won for India and Burma by the
> friends. Let them dedicate themselves- young, and
> old, men and women, alike- and go forth and settle in

strength will sustain 'them;   their uHn weakness
is unimportant.lO
As previously mentioned, the policy of establishing residences throughout
the country rather than solely relying on travel visits or lecture tours
was one of the major changes that distinguished the Six-Year Plan from
former plans.

At the time that the Guardian was making appeals, Iv!rs. Sh:lrin Boman
Iv!eheraban'L, a Baha' 'L of Farsi Ancestry, 'ias living with her husband in
Bombay where she was secretary of the city's Local Spiritual Assembly.
For several years she and her husbandyalong with several other Baha'is
in the Bombay communitJ! had been making teaching trips to various cities
in Iv!aharashtra and Gujarat.   While being aware of the Guardian's plea
for Baha'i pioneers to pick up their belongings and move to isolated
areas, she had not made a step in this direction, as both the family's
business and close relations were rooted in Bombay.         Finally in 1942,
having decided that she could no longer excuse herself from the Guardian's
call, Mrs. Iv!eherabiin1 approached her husband about moving away from
Bombay.   Mr. Meheraban:l was initially unresponsive to such a request,
but after a vivid dream in which he felt the Guardian call on him to make
a sacrifice for Baha'u'llab, he consented.

The Iv!eheraban'ls had not decided in which city they planned to settle.

At first they travelled with their children to Bhopal, but finding the
city unsuitable they decided to move on.      M.rs. Meheraban:L prayed for an
answer.    The next morning they went to the railway station having
determined tbat they would settle in the first town in which the afternoon
train from Bhopal would stop.      'rhis town was Ujjain.

of the family's savings.       At first Ikr. Ivleherab&.nl 1vas forced to rnake
frequent and extended trips to Bombay in order to ensure the transference
of his business to other hands,but af'ter these problems wer'' settled            he set
up a new business in Ujjain and began to spread thB message of the }'aith.

In the beginning the Meherabanfs' teaching activities were limited to
speaking to friends and acquaintances within the confines of their mm
home.      In Baha'f parlance this type of teaching is referred to as 'fireside
teaching',where the message is spread by means of open discussion within
intimate groups.      From these discussions, as well as from general
investigation, it soon became evident to the       l~eherabanfs   that before their
coming to Ujjain the Baha'f Faith was virtually unknown in Malwa.

In 1943 another Bah a' 1 family from Bombay, the Munj es, joined the
Meherab8.nls.     Dr. Munj e was one of the most prominent Bah a''[ scholars in
India, and he and his wife were a welcome addition to the Baha'f community
in Ujjain, which after a year of teaching still consisted of the
Meherabanfs and their children.

Tne year 1944 was a significant one for the Baha'f community in Ujjain.

During that year several important lan&narks \;ere established including
the formation of the city's first Local Spiritual Assembly and the holding
of the first Baha' 1 public meeting in Malwa.

The Bah a' 1 Newsletter of May, 1944, mentioned the formation of the
Local Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Ujjain, an event vhich earned
the Meheraban:Ls and the Munj es a place on the Bah a' 1 honor roll for
.  .   . h e d serVlce.

.    11   After the arrival of the Munj es j five new
d 1St1ngu1s
converts had been added to the group, four Muslims and a Hindu.            On April
21, having gathered nine believers in one community, the Baha'1s of Ujjain

ti .,
brought into being the city's first Local Spiritual AIJsembly.

The year 1944 also marked the centenary of the movement's origins;
it was 100 years earlier in Sh1raz that the Bab made his first declaration.
The Baha'i community in Ujjain, like many other local coR~unities both in
India and throughout the world, used this occasion to proclaim the message
of the Faith publicly.     On the night of May 23, 1944, the recently
established Baha'i center was illuminated with lights, and pamphlets were
di stri but ed.   On the same evening a drama depicting the major events in
the life of the Bab was presented in the tmm hall.         Both of these events
signify the first public   procla.~ation   of the Baha' 1 Faith in Malwa.

Two other opportunities for the Baha'is of Ujjain to publicly
proclaim the Faith arose within the same year.        The first was the occasion
of a Baha'i marriage ceremony, and the second vas the convening of an
Arya Samaj conference.

The marriage of one of Mrs. Neherabani' s daughters to a nevly converted
Muslim boy caused some commotion vithin the city.        According to Mrs.
Meherabani; several of the leading mullas of Uj jain hinted that violence
might erupt if the Muslim boy vas allowed to participate in the ceremony.
Mrs. Neheraban1 was personally threatened, and one mulla declared he vould
carry the black flag to the ceremony.       Although there were continual
grumblings vi thin the Muslim sector of Ujj ain, the ceremony proceeded as
plan..Ded, and the uniq_ueness of an inter-Faith vedding gave the Baha'is an
opportunity to inform the public of the universality of their religion.

Perhaps the most significant event in the year 1944 for the Uj jain
Baha'i community was their participation in one of the city's Arya Samaj
conferences.      In terms of the future development of the movement in Malwa
this conference was of great importance.        During the meeting the Baha'is
established contact with several individuals who would later be instrumental
in helping them teach the message of Baha'u'llB.h in rural t·1alwa.         Hr.

.   ..
Mahfuz-' ul' l,Iaq_' Ilmi, a vell knovn Baha' 1 travelling teacher, was asked

by the Baha'is of Ujjain to address the assembled group on the subject of
the social principles of the Baha'i Faith.        His speech attracted the
attention of one Kisan Lal, a scheduled caste leader from Shajapur (a
district located north-east of Ujjain).        Following the conference, KiSan
Lal came into active contact with the Ujjain Baha'1 cotnml.illit:t; which finally
resulted in his declaring himself a Balta' L       He then returned to Shajapur.

In Shajapur Kisan Lal informed many of his low caste compatriots
about the movement.      As a result, the Baha'i center in Ujjain lfas soon
frequented by interested Harijans from the villages of Shajapur, but the
elitist attitude that dominated the thinking of the Indian Baha'1 community
at this time prevented them from being enrolled.        The significance of
this attitude and its later transfiguration is of vital importance to an
understanding of the growth of the Baha' J: movement in Malwa, and it
therefore warrants closer examination.

,   /
Outside of Iran, the Baha'i Faith had to a large det.,£ee been associated
with middle class urban intellectuals.       This was true during its early
years of development in the Americas and Europe       and was no less
characteristic of its early years of growth in India.        The attitude
concerning   new believers which tended to characterize the Balla' J: cornrnl.illity
in India ootil the lal.illching of the Ten-Year Crusade was the following:
Before new believers could be enrolled into the movement they should not
only have an adequate knowledge of the basic doctrines and principles of
the Faith, they should also possess an acute alfareness of its administrative
organization and devotional procedures as well as a good understanding of
its historical development.      This approach to finding converts virtually
excluded the illiterate segments of society, as it was impossible for
villagers to grasp the finer details of the movement's structure and
organization.    As a result, although there were several instances of lo,er
caste interest in the Faith before the commencement of the Ten-Year Crusade,
Baha '2 connnl.illi ties in India did not take advantage of this interest.     Their

llilderstanding of what it meant to be a Bah a ':l was not acceptance of
Baha' u 'lliih as a manifestation of God, it also included the ability to
grasp the Baha'1 Faith in all its complexity.        For example, for many years
it was standard procedure in India for local administrators to examine a
potential new believer before accepting his declaration.            If they did not
feel his knowledge was adequate, he would not be enlisted.           Hence, in 19114
the Baha'1s of Ujjain did not even consider that illiterate Harijans could
be enrolled,

Between the years 1944 and 1947 several new believers were enrolled
in Ujjain, and a Baha'i community was established in nearby Indore where
Mrs. Meheraban1's brother had recently set up residence.            In addition, a
few individuals from surrollilding villages who were judged 'capable of
meeting Baha'1 standards were enrolled.       One of these individuals was
Daya Ram Malvia   who 1 like Kisan Lal 1 was a scheduled caste -.eader.      He
resided in village Harsodan, situated approximately fifteen miles outside
the Ujjain city limits.     Daya Ram in turn enlisted several prominent
scheduled caste members of his village; thereby establishing the first
Baha'1 village commllility in Malwa.

The type of teaching activities carried out by the Baha'i commllilities
in Malwa during these years can be gleaned from the National Spiritual
Assembly's Annual Report for the year 1946-47, parts of which are quoted
below:

> Teaching work: This was done through distribution

With the coming of independence to British India, and the partition
of the subcontinent into the independent states of India and Pakistan, the
Baha'i: communities in Ujjain and Indore were dealt a severe blow.         A
large percentage of the communities' believers had come from Islamic back-
ground, and therefore J when partition vras announced in ,JuJ.y of 19117 most
of them left for Pakistan.       It seemed to the Meheraban1s that all of their
efforts had come to nought.       The Ujjain Local Spiritual Assembly (the only
one in Mahra) was lost, as there were no longer nine believers within the
city.     Also, the great tension that immediately follovred partition made
any type of religious proselytizing dangerous, especially for a religion
that vras so closely related to Islam.      In this situation the Meherabanis
decided to leave Ujjain and move north to G11alior.       Consequently, Malwa
was left 11ith only a fe11 scattered believers, but the narnr Baha' 1 11as nov
kno1111 in the region, and the seeds vhich the Meherabanis had sovn would
later sprout and grov.

For the next tvelve years t-!ahm lay virtually dormant; local spiritual
assemblies were established, lost, and re-established in Indore, but that
community did not provide any real support for teaching activities.
Travelling teachers, however, frequented the region.          In one report it
was said of Ujj ain:

> This is a place ¥-There some of our pioneers had worked
> against great odds some years ago. It was pleasing
> to note that still there were some sympathisers to be
> found there 11ho are keen that the centre be opened.
Although they were non-Bal1ii<' is, they offered to keep

the centre going until some Baha' 1 could take it over.

~'he   outstanding event of' the period was a visit to Mahm following
the 1953 Intercontinental Conference in New Delhi of one of the newly
appointed Hands of the Cause, the American Dorothy Baker.                  Upon the
conclusion of the Delhi Conference; she was asked by Shoghi Effendi to stay
in the subcontinent.      She spent a fortnight in central India visiting
Gwalior, Indore, and Ujjain.          In all three cities she gave public lectures
in colleges and town halls,and in Indore alone she gave ten addresses between

December 23rd and 25th.          However, the most important aspect of Dorothy
Baker's trip was not the numerous lectures she delivered               but her excursion
to village Harsodru1.

Following her lecture program in Ujjain, Dorothy             B~ter   made an
unscheduled afternoon excursion to village Harsod8l1.               There she met not
only with the local B~a'is,          but with a large number of the lower caste
inhabitru1ts of the village.         Her attitude was one of love and concern for
the villagers as a whole - she ate with them ru1d participa"ed in their
activities.       To her, all men were B~a'is regardless of their economic or
educational backgrounds.        She seemed to exude that quality of unristricted
love that has manifested itself periodically in saints of such varied reigmus

backgrounds as St. Frru1cis or Jalalu'd-Din-i-Rlimi.                Mrs. Meherabani,
her travelling companion during the excursion, later said of Dorothy Baker:

> She gave us a completely new outlook. Before her trip
> we knew that the Faith was for all men, but we were
> concerned that those who entered its fold should have
> an understanding of the Faith.     Dorothy Baker taught
> us that the most importa.'1t thing in the Faith was
> love of B~a'u'llah ru1d our fellow men. 1'he details
> were minor. She really opened our eyes.*
The attitudes expressed by Dorothy Baker during her stay in Malva
seemed to characterize the general chru1ge in teaching approach throughout
the   B~a'i    world that followed the inauguration of the Ten-Year Crusade.

15 Dorothy Baker was killed in early 195 4 when the plane which was carrying

her from India exploded and crashed in the Mediterraniru1.
*   Mrs. Jvleherabani expressed this      during   8l1   interview in p    cW   Delhi in

March of 1974.
Emphasis was now placed    Oil   going out to the p<coplo u.ud accepting them as
individuals rather than expecting them to immediately conform to Balla' 'L
ideals and institutions.         Consequently, the feeling was slowly being
generated within the Baha'i': community by       certain far-sighted believers
that the hope of the Balla' 1 movement in India lay with the masses who
lived in the villages.      Before this vision became a reality      another
eight years would pass.

Malwa was resuscitated from its period of stagnation in 1959 when
Mr. K.H. Vajd1 and his wife settled in Ujjain.         Mr. Vajd1, a businessman
born in the Farsi community of Bombay, converted to the Baha' 1 Faith
during his youth and subsequently served the movement both in India and
AfricaJworking on various committees and participating in numerous
teaching projects.   Mrs. Vajd1, a daughter of Mrs. Meherabiin1, had just
obtained a teaching position at Ujjain's Vikram University in the Faculty
of Economics, and it was this appointment that brought the couple to Malwa.

When the Vajdls arrived in Ujjain there was only one other Baha'i':
in the city.   However, as mentioned earlier, there was a substantial group
of sympathisers in Ujjain, and the Baha'i': community in Indore,although not
active in teaching activities,had once again attained assembly status.
The Vajdls' work of reconstructing the Baha'i community in Ujjain was
carried out in much the same manner as earlier attempts; teaching activities
were primarily directed towards the upper stratum of societY, and occordingly,
the membership of the city's new Local Spiritual Assembly, which was re-
established in l960 1 reflected an upper class composition.        The members
included a secondary school teacher, three businessmen, and three clerks
as well as the Vajdls.      All the members were educated at least to the
secondary level, and, moreover, the new converts were all from high caste
Hindu backgrounds, a marked contrast to the previous community in Ujjain
which had been dominated by former Muslims.          This change was partly a
consequence of the Ten-Year Crusade's new approach of consciously directing

tho teachings of the Bahil '1 moverw.:=:n t towards Hindus.   .Buldi 'ls \-Jer·e now
better versed in the Hindu tradition and could present the Faith in a context
that was meaningful to their listeners.

During the year 1960 the Ujjain community increased by four with the
addition of' three Hindus and one Muslim.        Thus! by the end of the year,
the community consisted of thirteen members, twelve men and one woman.
These individuals together with the small Baha'i community in Indore and
the Baha'is of Harsodan and Shajapur constituted the Baha'i community in
Malwa.     Little d.id they know that the movement was on the verge of' great
expansion, the likes of which had not been experienced in the Baha'i world
since the time of' the Bab and Baha'u'lla!l.

For years Shoghi Effendi had been calling on the Baha'is of the world
to take the message of Baha'u'llalJ to the masses of' mankind.          As early as
1936 he had said:

> What the Cause now requires is not so much a group
> of highly. cultured and intellectual people who can
> adequately present its Teachings, but a number of'
> devoted, sincere and loyal supporters, who, in
> utter disregard of' their own weaknesses and limitations,
> and with hearts afire with the love of God, forsake
> their all for the sake of spreading and establishing
> His Faith. In other words, <~hat is mostly needed
> nowadays ~is a Baha'i pim;eer and not so much a Baha'i
> philosopher or scholar.lb
During the Ten-Year Crusade this plea was intensified.          The beginnings of
small-scale mass conversion in Africa during the mid-1950's presented
Shoghi Effendi   <~ith   an opportunity to reiterate the necessity of taking the
movement to the masses. His aim wm to remove from the belie· ers' minds any
misconceptions of' what it meant to be a Baha'i and thus clear the way for
all segments of society to become part of the Baha '1 co)llmuni ty.         His
secretary, writing to the National Spiritual Assembly of South and West
Africa, in July of' 1957, relayed the Guardian's feelings:

\[16\] Bahi3.'i News (United States),* 102, August, 1936, p. 2, quoted in
Directives from the Guardian, (llevr Delhi, 1973), p. 75

••• the friends should be very careful not to place
> hindrances in the way of those who wish to accept the
> Faith. If we make the rectuirements too rigorous, we
> will cool off the initial enthusiasm, rebuff the
> hearts and cease to expand rapidly. The essential
> thing is that the candidate for enrolment should "believe
> in his heart in the truth of Balla' u 'llah. Whether he
> is literate or illiterate, informed of all the Teachings
> or not, is beside the point entirely.l7
In February of 1959 the Indian National Spiritual Assembly voiced its
new attitude towards teaching the masses:

> On the other hand we should not deprive people
> to embrace the Faith pending their acctuiring
> elaborate knowledge of the Faith and details of
> administration, etc. If con¥iction in Faith has
> been established in mind and heart of our friends,
> no matter how little they know about the Faith,
> we should not deprive them to have rights and
> privileges of being Baha'fs.l~
In accordance with this policy, in 1960 Dr. R. Muhajir, Hand of the
Cause, met in special session with the Indian National Spiritual Assembly
to discuss the implementation of mass teaching in India.      His main advice
was for Baha'i teachers to go to the villages.      He called for volunteers
from the National Spiritual Assembly to launch the new campaign.        Mrs
Meherabanf, who was now a member of this body, volunteered her services
and left for the area of India she knew     best, Madhya Pradesh.

In Indore Mrs. Meherabanf took council with her broth' r.    He informed
her that some Baha'i contact had previously been made with a Bhil tribal
village located forty-five miles from Indore.      Accordingly, Mrs. Meheraban1

,left the next day for village Kweitiopani, where she remained for several
days, sharing the villagers' food and bedding and giving them the message
that Baha'u'llah, the universal avatara whose religion would unite men of
all religious and cultural backgrounds, had appeared.      During the next
few weeks she periodically returned to Kweitiopani, each time elaborating

village of 200 declared themselves lJelievers by placing their thumbprints
on enrolment cards (they could not write) which were subsequently sent to
the national office in New Delhi.

- --
Thus, Kweitiopani was the first village
in India to experience the mass teaching activities of the Baha 1 1 Faith,
and its conversions signalled the coming of a nel{ period in the history of
the movement in India.

Having initiated mass teaching in the Indore area, f.lrs. Meherabani
decided to carry out similar activity on the Uj,jain side.                 Before her
departure from Indore, however, she was informed that Dr. Huhaj ir had
returned to India and was desirous of holding a village conference in
Mal"a similar to the conference that had been held in village Rampur
several years earlier.           In consultation with the Vajdls it was decided
that village Sangfmand;;_, a predominantly scheduled caste village in
Shajapur - the district where interest in the movement had arisen years
before - would be a suitable site.             With the aid of Kisan Lal; arrangements
for the conference were made, and in late January of 1961 Dr. Muhajir
arrived in Ujjain and proceeded by jeep to the village.               The report of
the Indian National Spiritual Assembly reveals the scene that awaited him:

> When the Baha 1 is started for Samgimanda on foot
> and in bullock carts, they did not know "hat was

> The conference was publicized within a few hours and
> attracted over 300 people.l9
A great open air meeting was held at          ~ich   Baha 1 f speakers spoke of
Baha 1 u 1   llan   as bhagavan kalkin, the tenth avatara of Vi~',.lu whose return

in   Vai~t;tavite    theology will mark the end of the kali-yuga.             They also

emphasized that within the Baha'i Faith all men are considered eJ.Ual, for
God makes no distinction between rich and poor, high caste and low caste.
The latter point was particularly attractive to the villagers of
Sangimanda whoJ coming from the scheduled castesJ were often shunned by
higher caste members of society.          \fhen the meeting   conc~uded   those who
wished to declare their belief in Baha'u'lliih were asked to thumbprint
an enrolment card.          Over two hundred villagers declared themselves, and
'Representatives from neighbouring villages did not leave the place till
they were assured by the Baha 1 fs that they would send somebody to their

,21

places •..          liith the holding of the Sangimanda conference mass declaration
in Malwa had begun.

The flame that was lit in Sangimanda soon spread.          Word had circulated
to nearby villages of the new 'casteless 1 religion whose avatara considered
all men   e~ual,      and,as a result1 members of these villages were soon appealing
for   Balla'~   teachers to come to their communities and explain the teachings
and principles of the movement.          In addition, the National Spiritual
Assembly purchased several jeeps and sent Baha'i teachers on village tours
throughout the various districts of Mah1a.          !4rs. Meheraban1 and her son-
in-law Mr. Vajdi were the spearheads of the new campaign, and they spent
long hours travelling the pathways of rural Halwa proclaiming the new
religion wherever they went.          Their message was always the same:
Baha'u'llah, the new avatara, had appeared to lead men out of the age of
darkness.          As the momentum in teaching activity was accelerated, the
response of rural Malwa grew.          In fact, the large increase in declarations
in India between the years 1961 and 1963, as revealed in the statistics
presented in Chapter 2, was primarily the outcome of the mass teaching
campaigns in lvtalwa and the nearby districts surrounding the city of G1falior.

During the first few years of mass teaching in Halwa the movement

21 The Baha'i World, vol. XIII, p. 299

enlisted indl viduuLl primarily from tlw lower castes, particularly the
schedQled tribes and castes.        This was due to two basic factors.       The
first and perhaps most obvious reason was the teachings of the movement
itself.      Being anti-caste and proposing a world brotherhood of men, they
spoke to the specific plight of the Indian Harijan.            The second concerned
the initial rural contacts made by Baha'is in Malwa.            As shown earlier,
two of the original Baha'i converts in rural Malwa came from scheduled caste
background; Kisan    Lai   from Shajapur, and Daya   Ram   Malvia from Harsodan.
When the Indian National Spiritual Assembly decided to activate a campaign
of mass teaching it turned to these individuals for help, and the two men
naturally took the Baha'i teachers to those communities they knew best-
the Harijan communities.       Hence, a large percentage of declarants during
these years carne from the ranks of the scheduled castes.

The Vajdi household in Ujjain suddenly became a hub of activity where
numerous new Baha'is from surrounding villages often congregated.            It soon
became evident that a Baha'i center was necessary to accommodate the
visitors.      Consequently, a location in the city was obtained, and Baha'i
activity in Ujjain was focused around this center until 1965 >ihen a new
building and grounds situated approximately one mile outside of the city
was purchased.

During these years of rapid expansion the Faith was not free from
opposition.

-        -
TI1e Arya Sarnaj, which was happy to accommodate the movement
as long as it was an intellectual philosophy, became actively hostile when
the Faith began to enter the arena of action and enrol the masses.            Arya
Sarnajists began to follow the Baha'i teachers in the rural areas attempting
to reconvert anyone who had declared their belief in Bah a' u 'llah.         Their
main point of attack was that the movement was actually a form of Islam in
disgmse.       Villagers were told their wives would be taken: from them and
they would be forced to eat the holy mother cow. *           Animosity became so

* This    information was revealed to the author by Baha' 1 village teachers,

great that the Indian National Spiritual Assembly in their 'reaching Report
of December 1963, wrote to the Universal House of Justice:

> The greatest welcome news is the rising opposition
> of the Arya Samajists in Madhya Pradesh.       May the

> Dr. Mu.'1j e, Mrs. Shirin Boman, Mr. K. N. Pradhan and
> Mr. K.H. Vajdi toured the erupting area at a great
> personal hazard.22

Baha'i teachers answered these charges by insisting the Baha'i Faith was
an independent world religion whichJfar from being disdainful towards
Hinduism1 wanted to purity it from the dross of man-made convention.            By
the end of 1964 the anti-Bah§.' :l activities of the Arya Samaj in Nalwa had
subsided though there existed a rather bitter peace which at any time was

liable to lead to confrontation.

of the new village believers.                          .

RUJ:fyyih Kha.num's initial experience in rural Habra was her visit to
village Kwei tiopani, the first village in Halwa to experience mass teaching,

Following her excursion to Kwei tiopani1 RU.~fyyih Khan urn visited the mass
teaching district of Shaj apur where she attended a regional conference.
Before departing the area she also made numerous stops in local villages
where the response to her arrival was always one of joy and acclamation.
In the village of Jahangirpur she was greeted by a brass bend playing
royal marches, and as she walked down the village lanes people shouted

Dharm-Hata Ki Jai Ho         (long live our spiritual mother).
Returning to Indore 1 R~fyy1h Khanum presented her last talk in Halwa
in the newly acquired Baha 1 l teaching institute.        Here she addressed forty
travelling teachers on the importance of continuing the mass teaching
campaign.     She told them that consolidation of these new gains was
necessary, and a program directed towards this end would be initiated, but
the Baha 1 J:s of Malwa having begun the fire of mass teaching in India must
now turn it into a conflagration; all believers, new and old, should be
brought into active participation.

The advice which RUl.llyyih Khanum gave to the travelling teachers was
heeded by the Bah a 1 :ls of Malwa.     Active teaching was continually pursued
throughout the remaining years of the 1960 1 s, so that by the end of the
decade there were over one hundred thousand declared believers in !·1alwa.
There was one major chaage, however; that distinguished the teaching methods

2 5 Violette Nal<hjavani, Amatu 1 l-Baha Visits India, (New Delhi, n.d.),

p. 50-51

\[26\] Nakhjallani, p. 53
of the early 1960's from those of the mid and late 1960's.            During the
latter period a conscious effort >Jas made to attract other than 'low' caste
members to the movement.       As was stated earlier, a large majority of the
early mass teaching declarations     ca~e   from among the lower castes, and 1 as a
result, the upper castes tended to identify the Baha'i Faith as a scheduled
caste movement and would have nothing to do with it.            vfuen mass teaching
began in the Gwalior area in 1962)the Baha'is in that region used a new
method.     Rather than going directly to the scheduled castes they would
first approach the leading castes of the village, a technique that allowed
for a greater range of castes to join the movement, as the 'clean' castes
were not alienated by teachers entering the villages and converting 'lo>r'
castemen.       Consequently, since the Baha 1 i Faith claimed to be a religion
for all   me~   the approach used in the G1;alior area was soon realized to be
the most advantageous, and accordingly, the mid 1960's sa>J this method of
teaching introduced into Malwa with the result that during this time a
number of higher caste members declared their belief in Baha'u'llah.

The enrollment of ne>r believers >ras not the only arena of activity in
which the Baha'i teachers in Malwa participated.         As Rill_liyyih Khanum had
noted during her presentations in Indore, consolidation programs were a
necessary corollary to mass teaching.         As the main objective of the Baha'i
Faith was not just to present a set of idealistic beliefs to mankind but to
educate declarants in the various aspects of Baha'u'lliih's religion so that
a unified world order of belivers      co-ordinated by a system of local,
national, and international institutions        could evolve, a systematic plan
for 'deepening' new adherents had to be initiated.         As    ~result,   a spirited
program designed to educate specific believers in al)_ phases of the movement's
teachings was launched.

Consolidation procedures had been set in motion as early as 1963 "ith
the opening of the Indore Teaching Institute.         One of the primary functions
of this institution was to 'deepen' a number of village believers in all

facets of the Ji'ai th' s teachings so that upon returning to their respective
villages they would be able to disseminate this information muong the
remainder of the new declarants.      Special resident instructors were brought
to the Institute to teach both week-long and week-end classes in Baha'i
history, adl'linistrati ve organization, consultation methods, and ethics.
Dr. Hunje, one of the first Baha'is to settle in Malwa, and Mr. Dushyant
Kiirnar were both active in this progrmn.    By 1964 the Indore Teaching
Institute was having regular courses and had already trained many

declarants to teach their fellow villagers.        In 1965 similar courses
under the direction of Mr. Jadav were initiated in the new Baha'i Center
in Uj j ain.

Another institution designed to help educate new beF.evers was the
village primary school.     The schools served two purposes: first, they
educated village children in the fundaJUentals of primary education and
introduced them to the basic teachings of the Baha'i Faith; and second,
they served as Baha'i village centers where new believers could hold
meetings.      Such schools were only established in villages where government
schools were not present or functioning.      T'ne first school was introduced
into village Kweitiopani where the inhabitants were instructed in Hindi,
arithmetic, and Baha'i history and social principles.

The tremendous growth of teaching activity that characterized the
1960's, and the initiation of an energetic consolidation program that
followed in its wa.l<e1 necessitated the creation of new administrative
institutions.      Consequently, in the mid-1960's the National Spiritual
Assembly created the Area Teaching Committee of Central India.      The
function of this body was to formulate and supervise both teaching and
consolidation activities in the mass teaching areas of Halwa and Gwalior,
thereby relieving the already overburdened National Spir:' .;ual Assembly of

2 7 'National Spiritual Assembly Circular of Augnst 27, 1964'

having to deal with these matters directly.         After consulting, the
Committee notified the National Spiritual Assembly of its decisions, and
the national body either ratified the proposals or sent them back for
re-evaluation.

Hi th the continued expansion of the movement in 1•1adhya Pradesh the
National Spiritual Assembly in the late 1960's divided the Area Teaching
ColliDlittee into two Regional teaching committees:        one for northern l-!adhya
Pradesh and the other for southern Madhya Pradesh.            The former held its
meetings in Gwalior, while the latter alternated its meetings between
Indore and Ujjain.

In the 1970's the organization of the teaching co1r.mittees >ms once
more rearranged.     The State Teaching Committee of Hadhya Pradesh was
established in January of 1973 and had under its charge two Regional
teaching committees whose areas of jurisdiction were the same as those
mentioned above.     Consequently, by the end of the Nine-Year Plan there
were three administrative institutions directing teaching and consolidation
activities in Halwa:    the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee, the Hadhya
Pradesh State Teaching Committee, and the National Spiritual Assembly.
Since 1970 the Baha'i Administrative Order has been primarily

concerned with consolidation and       deepening' 'work.      Teaching has continued$
but not with the same pace or zeal that characterized it during the 1960's.
Baha 1 J: administrators have now set a goal of trying to develop a specific
number of 'model village' communities in Halwa.            Before examining the
various aspects of Balla '1 community life that the movement's leaders hope
to develop in such coJT.munities, the structure of both the administrative
system directing Baha'i activities and the social system into Which they
are being introduced will be examined in greater detail.
Part II   ~'he   Sociological Framework

1UU

Chapter 4     The Local Village

If we are to correctly understand the current activities of the Baha'1

Faith in Malwa, and comprehend the position the movement holds within the
total sociological panorama of the region, then it is necessary from the
beginning to make several typological distinctions.     First, there are the
local villages of Malwa.    The life patterns of the individuals who inhabit
these communities are largely determined by a traditional value system.
The traditional system,however ,is by no means homogeneous; it is
continually coming under attack from certain modern-secular values and
institutions which have emerged as a result of India's contact with the Hest.
Second, there exists the Baha'1 Faith's administrative system consisting of
local, regional, national, and international bodies which is characterized
by a set of socio-religious values markedly different to che value system
and corresponding institutional manifestations of the traditional village.
Finally, there are those villages in which the Baha'1 Administrative Order
is attempting to introduce its valuational and institutional components.
Hhile the members of these communities are still largely influenced by
traditional patterns of behavior, they are in some cases slowly coming
under the influence of Baha 1 1 socio-religious attitudes and modes of
conduct.

Part II will examine the structures of both the contemporary village
social system and the Bah a' 1 Administrative Order.    The analysis will not
be detailed; such a task would in itself demand two separate volumes.
Rather, the chapters in this section will point out the distinguishing
characteristics of each system, creating in the process a sociological
fnamework that will hopefully facilitate an understanding of Baha'1
propagation and consolidation efforts in rural Malwa.

A socia1 sy·st(:;·:m       •••   is a mode of. organization o.f action elements
relative to the persistence or ordered processes of change of the

interactive patterns of a plurality of individual actors. •                 That is,
it is a complex network of values and corresponding institutions vrhich
determines where an individual in a given group is locate'1, in relationship
to other individuals (status), and defines ;~hat the individual does in
his relations with other rnernbers of the group ( role). -

?
Tne social system of the contemporary Malwa village is made up of a
combination of traditional and modern elements.                Traditionally it has
been characterized by
1) its rigid hierarchical classification of status groups

> in this world (caste) and its belief in a corresponding
> hierarchy of deities in the other world;
> 2) its propensity towards ritual specialization;
3) its incarnation of religion in perpetual symbols or

images:
> 4) its concepts of ritual purity; and
> 5) its regional orientation.

However, since the corning of the western powers to the subcontinent
modernizing elements have slowly been finding their way into village
life.    In all spheres of life, economic, political,             soc'~,   religious,
and educational, these elements have infiltrated the inner sanctum of
tradition.      The increasing economic dependence of the village on urban
centers, the expansion of democracy, and the spread of public education

are but a fe1< examples of the forces of modernization that are continually
affecting the contemporary village,and,as a result,traditional socio-
religious values and institutions are finding themselves more and more in
a state of stress.     In order to better understand this phenomenon 1<e
must take a closer look at traditional village norms and their
corresponding modern counterparts.

Perhaps the most 1<ell kno1<n aspect of the village social structure,
and one 1<hich has had a vast number of investigators, is the caste system.
The outstanding characteristic of the system is group exclusiveness;         in
any given village there exists a range of status groups kno1{U as castes
whose members' roles as regards occupation and ritual performance are
rigidly defined.     These groups are endogamous and have strict rules
regarding commensal relations;    individual members of a given caste can
only find mates within their own caste group, and, generally speaking, they
will not eat unripe or kacca foods from a caste lower than their own. 3
In addition, there is an entire galaxy of rules and regulations ranging
from modes of address to styles of clothing that mark off the
exclusiveness of each caste.     The hierarchical ordering of castes is
justified by religious ideals.     The traditional and largely theoretical
account of the ordering of the castes is the well-kno1<n four varna
classification in which the BrarumaQs (priests) receive the highest
position, followed by the   K~atriyas     (1<arriors), Vaisyas (merchants and

artisans), and Sudras (labourers) •        Within each varna    (class) there are

3 Kacc<a foods are those cooked in water and/or salt. Included in this

> group are staple foods of cakes, unleavened sorgham meal, rice,
> curries, and chutneys. Kacca foods are distinguished fJ:om pa:kka
> foods, which are those prepared in clarified butter ( ghi). The
> latter can be shared by a greater range of castes.   --
4 The Rg Veda (X, 90) gives an account of creation whereby a primeval man

> (purusa) sacrifices himself, thereby creat~ng the univ~rse. .:rom
> vari9us parts of his body were produced Brahm8.l/, K~atr1ya, \\a1sya,
> and Sudra. Over the millennia another category, 'ur~ouchable', was
added to the list making five basic classifications.

munerous subdivisions,   ~castes    t and the position of a given caste in
the hierarchical structure can vary from one region to another, but in
every region the ranking of each caste is firmly established.

The major assumption that underlies the entire system is the
inequality of status groups.        A Braruna!J is considered superior both in
terms of' occupation and ritual status to a       K~atriya,   and a Ksatriya
superior to a Vaisya.     The main distinction in terms of ineqaulity,
however, is drawn between 'clean', 'unclean', and 'untouchable' castes.(astes of
ine first three Y9Ff!Q.!i 1being considered 'clean '1 would have more extensive
social intercourse with one another than they would with the Siidra ('unclean')
and 'untouchable' castes.      'There are no common feasts between these two
divisions of castes.    Castes of the "unclean" and "untouchable" divisions
are regarded as "servant castes", who must dine only after the "master
castes" have taken their meals.' 5        Accordingly, the political and
economic power in the village is dominated by the 'clear,• castes, and among

.                  .
them Brahmans and Rajputs (Ksatriya) stand out.

The doctrine of karma, a type of cosmic law of cause and effect,
justifies the inequality.      Individuals are born into certain castes
because of the deeds they have committed in past lives, and their actions
in the present life \?ill determine their status in future lives.          Hence,
nearly every aspect of village life is influenced by one's caste, as the
village is the cosmos in microcosm.

While caste exclusiveness still characterizes village life in Mal\ia
and determines one's status and role within the community, anti-caste
ideals are slo\ily finding their way into the system.          The two main sources
of agitation are the political arena and the educational system.           Article
14 of the Indian Constitution states that India as a secular state holds

all of its citizens equal before the la\i.          Theoretically, each citizen

5 K.S. Mathur, Caste and Ritual in a Malwa Village, (Bombay, 1964), p. 127
6 Constitutions of Asian Countries, prepared by The Secretariat of the
Aslan African Legal Consultative Cormnittee, (Bombay, 1968), p. 194

regardless of caste has an equal vote in the democratic process of
electing the nation's leaders.      An awareness of their new rights as citizens
has begun to manifest itself within the minds of many 'low' caste members,
the result being that numerous 'low' caste and particularly scheduled
caste political factions have arisen within the past two decades.      A
prominent example of this phenomenon is the rise of the politically oriented
Nee-Buddhist Movement 7 in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.     Also, the
introduction into the rural areas by the Indian government of elected
administrative bodies, pancayats,

8 is helping to undermine the traditional
village power structure, as these institutions provide opportunities for
lower castemen to hold positions of authority in the village.

In addition to a growing political awareness, the expansion of public
education is also having a disruptive influence on caste exclusiveness.
Many villagers now have the opportunity to leave their communities and go
to urban centers where they can take part in higher education, and their
introduction to new ideas often creates psychological conflicts resulting
in the rejection of tradition"'l rigidity.     For example, the author met
several village students in Ujjain who told him they would not necessarily
marry into their own caste, and while there is often a difference between
what a person says he will do and what he actually does, the fact that
these students even considered breaking caste rules regarding marriage
exemplifies the growing conflict that is manifesting itself in contemporary
Malwa villages as a result of the collision of traditional and modern
values.

One of the principal precepts of popular Hinduism, and one that is
closely related to the hierarchical ranking of status groups in the village

is the concept of purity and pollution.        'l!indu:o regard purity as the
supreme virtue.       Of the three major attributes of God and dharma, viz.
sat yam (truth) , sundaram (beauty), and si vmn (purity, auspiciousness) ,
the last is the most important. •9       According to the Hindu view of life
everything in existence is either intrinsically impure, neutral, or pure.
Being intrinsically neutral, man must continually purify himself throughout
his life by performing certain prescribed rituals known as samskaras (rites

of passage).          The number and form of these rituals vary according to
caste;    while the BrB.hman is required to perform nine samskaras, the Sudracac~es
are required to perform only three.       Moreover, contact with anything

11            thtth
2mpure            .
reqUlres   a   e po l luted b
o ject or person be pur2f2ed

..    by means
of special ritual ablution.        Two of the most well known agents of
purification are fire and water1 and hence bathing in a     he:~y   river such as
the Sipra is often prescribed as a remedy for removing the taint of impurity.
Again, differences in purification methods vary according to caste.

In terms of social interaction the concept of purity and pollution
plays an important role in village life.        Taking improper food from a
caste lower thanone's own is considered polluting, and as a result an
elaborate system of rules regulates village commensal activity.           In general,
the higher a caste's ranking, the fewer the number of castes from
which its members are allowed to accept food.        Consequently, a Braruman

•
will rarely take food from anyone but a fellow casteman, although he can
prepare food for all castes.

Purity
and pollution concepts are not just limited to their effect on commensal
relationships.        Sometimes, as in the case of certain 'untouchable' castes,

marriage, and death.
ll Examples of impure objects include body flUlds,

and feces.

lOG
the mere presence of another individual          within a specified distance is
enough to pollute a     1

clean 1 casteman.    Consequently, the Hindu ideal of
purity has traditionally acted as a conceptual support fo- the maintenance
of caste exclusiveness.

The rigidity that characterizes the Hindu concept of purity and
pollution is also coming         under attack.     In many instances, however, the
pressure for change has not come from voluntary opposition but from
involuntary circumstances which have arisen as a result of general social
and technological change.          While the Indian Constitution forbids the
implementation of such inequities as pollution by touch, changing social
conditions have done more to eliminate it than enforced legislation.              For
example, with the growth of industry in India numerous persons from both

. f
urb an an d rura1 areas were emp 1 oye d ln       .

actorles. 12      'The factories
attracted workers from all levels of traditional society as they offered

comparatively high wages.•            As a result, high and low caste members
were brought into close physical contact with each           other, a situation
which     according to the traditional concept of purity and pollution would
have in many instances necessitated ritual ablution.            However, since a
factory cannot function efficiently if its workers are cc iStantly having
to purify themselves, the traditional pattern of behavior gave way to the
more functional one.

The introduction of public transportation, notably buses, has resulted
in the same situation.          In a bus (as anyone who has travelled on an Indian
bus     well knows) a Braum~ may find himself at extremely c1ose quarters
with an 'untouchable' .         Also, as N.N. Srinivas    has pointed out, the

12 Large factories exist not only in Indore and Ujjain but in several other

Nalwa cities including Ratlam, l'!agda and Agar.

popularity of travel and teas hops where numerous castes often mix is not
confined to city folk but extends to villagers as well. 14    Hence, the
changing facts of social reality in both urban and rural India have helped
weaken, at least in some areas of social intercourse, the strong notion of
purity and pollution that has for so long permeated village life.

Another characteristic of the social system of the contemporary Malwa
village is its propensity towards ritual specialization.     As with the
concept of purity and pollution, ritual specialization reflects both one's
status and role within the    community.   In the religious life of the
village, rituals relating to fasts and feasts, rites of passage, and
individual worship vary in form and content according to caste , and as a
result in each village there is an entire hierarchy of ritual practices,
the form and content of which are determined by the relative position
within the community of the participant's status group.

Ritual is '       a category of standardized behavior (custom) in which
the relationship between the means and the end is not intrinsic, ie. is

either irrational or non-rational. •   In the traditional village numerous
areas of life are governed by such 'non-rational' symbolic activity.
These areas include the previously mentioned rites of passage and
purification rituals as well as numerous fasts, feasts, and acts of
individual worship (puja).     In general, most rituals include as part of
their content the acting out of certain symbolic formulas (according to the
specific circumstance )and the offering of a gift, often food or flowers,
to a given deity in return for the god's blessing and protection.

As stated above, both the content and objects of ritual activity vary
from caste to caste.     While many castes worship cownon deities, each

Journal of Sociology, vol. XII, 1961, (London), p. 159

caste generally has its own specific deities to whom its members offer
l!1!.i.a·      There are also variations in the procedure of worship.
are particularly striking in the matter of food offered to the deity, the
caste of the officiating priest, and the hymns or incantations recited in
honour of the del't Y• ,16      For example, Bratma~ rituals would contain many

>
more sanskritic elements than would rituals of lower castes, and Sudra
rituals would be devoid of such elements.            Rituals even vary according
to different clan groups within the village.              As Adrian Mayer has pointed
out, different clans have different mother goddesses and corresponding
rl't u al s. 17     Traditionally, variation in ritual content has symbolized the
relative position of each caste in the religio-cosmic hierarchy;                 the more
elaborate and sanskritic the ritual, the purer and therefore higher the
caste performing it.

As in other spheres of village life, the world of ritual is experiencing
some noteworthy changes.             In addition to the changes taking place in purity
and pollution rituals, there seems to be a decline in both the
elaborateness and        fre~uency   of other rituals.     For example, the rites of
passage rituals, which for higher castes were traditionally characterized

by both their number and complexity, are being simplified.                 Even daily
worship patterns are beginning to alter.             I was told by a Rajput village
informant that the young men of his village did not frequent the local
temples as often as had their forefathers.               According to K.S. Mathur's
findings in village Potlod, the number of persons visiting the temple
everyday was very small, ie. the number of devotees regularly visiting
any of the four temples being in no case more than ten, seems to support

lower castes try to raise their ritual status by adopting the ritual
conduct of higher castes) the traditionalization can in                             some ways be
understood as a result of modernization;                   lower castes in an attempt to
attain social equality, a predominantly modern and secular concept, revert
to traditional channels of change as a means of reaching their goal.                                     Seen
in this light the increased emphasis on ritual behavior is not a conservative
backlash     but a secular ideal dressed in religious clothing.

In addition, the rise of new secular oriented categories of behavior,
ie. political activity, has caused a shift in the importance of ritual
identity.       At one time caste was primarily viewed in terms of ritual-
cosmic meaning.           However, in the last thirty years castes have also become
viable political units.               In this regard one student of village India has
gone    as far as to say that modern political ideology has changed caste
identity from an essentially ritual-cosmic base to a more secular political
orientation. 21      While this may be somewhat of an overstatement, it is no
doubt true that the filtering of modern secular concepts into rural India
has undermined the extent and scope of ritual activity in the contemporary
village.

Anyone who sets foot into a Hindu village is sure to notice almost
immediately the numerous religious images and symbols that permeate the
environment.        Rural Hinduism has always been characterized by its graphic
representation of the Sacred (to which the large number of icons inhabiting
village temples and shrines are ample testimony), a fact ,.hich has often
brought down upon it the wrath of religious iconoclasts.

While as in caste ranking, the stratification of deities may vary
according to the region one is investigating, in general the highest
positions are reserved for a select group of All-India deities.           In Malwa
the figures of Rama, Siva, Hanumant, and Ga~esa are included in the highest
assemblage.     These gods iru1abit the village temples and are worshipped
daily by a 'clean' caste priest, generally a Br~ma~.           'Nobody except the
priest is allowed to touch the image, and the "unclean"         and "untouchable"
castes are prohibited from entering the temple premises by express sacred

. d .

laws of H2n msm. ,22      The lesser gods and local deities are not housed in
the main village temples but find their lodging in smaller shrines.            In
contrast to the carved figures of the All-India deities, these gods are
usually represented by a pile of painted stones and are often associated
with particular castes.         Some of the more prominent members of this
classification of gods in Malwa are Sitala, Bhairu, llag, and Folia t~aharaj.
The shrines of these deities are open to all castes and usually do not have
officiating priests;    the worshipper is allowed to approach the god directly.

Each deity has specific areas of influence for which he or she is well
known.     If an individual is embarking on a business venture he will
generally make an offering to       G~esa,   the god of prosperity.   Likewise,

;
women often approach the Siva lingam or one of the local mother goddesses
when they desire a new offspring.         In this regard one cannot help but
notice the similarities in division of labor that exist between the caste
system and the Hindu pantheon.

Perhaps more than any other aspect of village life the realm of
religious representation has changed the least with the advent of modernism.
While many reform groups, such as the Arya Samaj, and in a more radical
manner    anti-Hindu factions like the previously mentioned Nco-Buddhist

Constitution, it has often been adhered to by conservative Hindus.)

Novement, bave disdained graphic symboli::nn as a eorruption of       pure'
religion, their ideas have not been able to penetrate India's villages.
Conse~uently,   Hinduism in rural Malwa is still characterized by its
representation of the Sacred in numerous symbols and images.

Commentators on Indian society have always noted the relative
isolation of the local village,     In this regard Sir Charles Metcalf's
Minute immediately comes to mind in which he referred to India's villages
as independent republics:

> The Village Communities are little Republics, having
> nearly everything they want within themselves, and
> almost independent of any foreign relations. They
> seem to last where nothing else lasts. Dynasty after
> dynasty tumbles down; revolution succeeds to
> revolution; Hindu, Pathan, Mughul, Mahratta, Sikh,
> English, are masters in turn~ but the village
> communities remain the same.~3

While the Englishman's emphasis on the isolation of the traditional village
may have been somewhat of an oversimplification, it does point out the
relative localism that has characterized the outlook of the Indian villager.
Although Hinduism has over the millennia spread its influence throughout
the subcontinent, it is the local region that has demanded the villager's
allegiance,,    Differences in regional dialects, customs, and even deities
reflect this phenomenon.     Furthermore, the fact that the experiential
world of the Indian villager rarely spread beyond one of his own kinsman's
villages - which he might visit for marital or other religiously oriented
celebrations - of necessity resulted in his perspective being limited,
causing him to identiry himself primarily as a member of a certain caste,
sub-caste, and clan, rather than as member of a nation or adherent to a
particular'religious tradition.

With the advent of British rule, the logistic latitude of the
traditional village began to undergo adjustment.     Numerous forces,

at this time the five 'model villages' whose Baha'i communities provided
the author with the majority of his data regarding the implementation of
Baha'i values and institutions in rural Malwa.

As of January 1974, there were 113,692 declared Baha'is in Malwa
proper

29 scattered among 6,572 localities.              The following table reveals
by district the number of Baha'is and the types of communities in which
they live:

As can be gleaned from the above table there are three types of
Baha'i colll!llunities:     the isolated believer, the Group, and the Local
Spiritual Assembly.          The isolated believer, as the title suggests, is an
individual who is the only Baha'i in a given locality.                       As such, he does
not really participate in a colll!llunity       but tries to live up to Baha'i

traditional and modern va1ues.    However, unlike the majority of villages
in the area they are also harboring within their midsts the seeds of a
social system that may provide the institutional and valuational changes
needed to alleviate the friction of colliding worlds.         Short descriptions
of five such villages are given below.

Garabell

Village Garabeli is located in Ujjain district, just fifteen miles
from the city of Ujjain. *    Its inhabitants are in constant contact with
the city, as much of their produce is sold in her markets.         While the
average population of the other villages cited in this study is between
two and three hundred, Garabeli's inhabitants number more than a thousand.
Their caste distribution is as follows:      4oo Nalvi Balais, 300 Desa
Chamars, 165 Kumars, 100 Gujarati Chamars, 50 Kurmis, 25 Rajputs,
25 Neyaks, 15 Ja!s, 10 Sutars, 6 Darjis, and 6 Nais.         In addition, there

are 25 Muslims living in Garabeli.        As the figures reveal, the village
consists predominantly of scheduled castemen. 33

- - 34
Village land amounts to approximately five thousand bighas, of which
80% is owned by inhabitants (ranging in distribution from 200 bighas to
none) and 20% by the government (grazing land).         1'he main crops farmed
are wheat, barley, cotton, and sugar cane.

*   For the location of all villages see Hap   ~   3.
32 The size of Garabeli made it difficult to take as thorough a census as

> in the other villages. Village informants, however, gave a general
> estimate of the caste breakdown of the village, which for our
> purposes is sufficient.
33 Balais were traditionally involved with weaving cloth and were considered

'unclean'. Chamars were leather workers and labelled 'untouchables'.

> In actuality many Balais and Chamars are laborers or cultivators, but
> the stigma of their traditional caste occupations has remained with
> them.
34 One bigha is e~ual to approximately 3/5 of a standard acre.

Garabeli is approximately a thousand years old.     Its founders were
Rajputs who were at one time more predominant in terms of numbers but over
the centuries have been slowly displaced.    During the modern era the
village has been torn by antagonism between R~jputs and scheduled caste
factions.   Apparently, forty years .ago there was an out1creak of violenc:e
when Rajputs attempted to take some land away from a scheduled caste Bal~i.
Garabeli was visited by Baha'1 travelling teachers during the early years
of mass teaching (1961), and the village was one of the first rural
communities in Malwa to establish its Local Spiritual Assembly.      Today
the Baha'i community numbers 127. 35   Listed below is statistical

and occupation of the Baha'1s of Garabeli.

Approximately three miles west of the town of Alot (forty-five miles
north of Ujjain) lies the village of Manasa.             The village is joined to
Alot by an unmettled road which is traversed daily by a local bus.                Of
the 202 inhabitants, 188 are Raj puts;           the remaining 14 members belong to
'unclean' and 'untouchable' castes (8 Maivi Balais and           6 Desa Chamars).
Its lack of numerous castes (many of which perform essent'al services l means
that Manas a relies on near·by villages to supply sweepers, barbers and
craftsmen.     In addition, a neighboring BrahmaiJ offers daily puja in
Manasa's temple.

Close to nine hundred bfghas of land produce harvests of wheat, barley,
millet, and cotton.      Land distribution ranges from approximately one
hundred bighas, owned by the village headman (Raj put), to a small i'i ve
bigha plot farmed by a Balai family.

The village is very young, having been founded only ninety years ago
by Rajputs who left .a nearby community because of land shortage.            There
are no written records concerning Manas a's history, and it seems that besides
the occasional feast or wedding party            and the intermittent boundary
quarrel, no outstanding event marked its existence until the coming of
Baha'1 teachers early in 1963.          At that time Mr. K.H. Vajdf and

During their first visit to Manasa nine inhabitants declared (all Rajputs),
and thus in April of 1963 the communities first Local spc· dtual Assembly
was established.      In 1968 a Baha 1 1 primary school was built, and today
it is officially recognized by the government of l•ladhya Pradesh.           At
present there are fifty-two declared believers in Manasa.

Karailkani

Karahkani is located twenty miles northwest of the small town of Tal
in Mandsaur district.      It is the most isolated of the villages cited in
this study - one must travel over twenty miles of winding dirt roads to
reach its first fields.      The village is inhabited by 230 souls who are
distributed among eight castes:       90 Gujars, 89 Rajputs, 18 Br~ma~s,
7 Parjis, 16 Gujarati Chamars, 7 Maivi Balais, and 3 Panjabis.

Karankani' s main crops are similar to those grown in other Malwa
villages.    In addition, a large opium crop (which is grown under
government contract) brings lucrative returns to many fmnilies.             Land
holdings are fairly well distributed, the largest amount of land owned by
a single cultivator being fifty bighas.

The village is over seven hundred years old.         It was founded by
Guj ars, a wandering people who gave their name to the st""te located to
the northwest of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat.        In 1968 a Baha'i travelling
teacher from Mehidpur (a small local tmrn) came to Karailkani to give the
message of the Bah a' 'l Faith.     He met with the village headman ( natel) and
explained about the coming of Bhagavan Baha (Baha'u'lliih).         After spending
the night in the village, the teacher enrolled the       pa~el,   a member of the
Gujar caste, and a Rajput.        '1\ro months later, having obtained assistance
from the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee, these two men constructed a
small building which was subsequently used as both a Baha' '[ bhavan (center)
and a primary school.     Over the ne"-"t five years t1ienty-two inhabitants
declared themselves helievers in Bah a' u' lliih, and today the Bah a' 'l
community totals t1ienty-four.

Kasod

Village Kasod is located in Shajapur district, approximately ten
miles south of the small gown of Agar (forty-five miles north-east of Ujjain).
It is connected to the main high'fay that runs bet.,een Ujjain and Agar by
a series of 'finding dirt roads 'fhich at times are not more than footpaths.
The village has a population of 299, among 'fhich there are 206 Rajputs,
46 Des a Chamars, 38 MB:lvr Balais, a.11d 9 Brahmru:s.      HencP, KB.sod is
divided into t'fo main groupings;     Rajputs are rar~ed near the top of the
caste hierarchy, 'fhile the Balai and Cl1amar castes are categorized as
'unclean' and 'untouchable' respectively.           Since there are no middle
range castes in Kasod, many of' the services provided by these status
groups must be obtained in nearby villages or in Agar.

Village lands amount to fifteen hundred bighas.          The largest
landholding is that of the headman 'fho o'fns almost a hundred bighas.
On the other hand, the local Chamars O'fn no land, their livelihood being
earned from laboring in higher castemen's fields.           The main   crops farmed
are 'fheat, barley, red pepper, sugar cane, and opium.

While there are no 'fritten records concerning the history of the
village, the patel claimed Kasod was several hundred years old and that it was

- '

founded by his Rajput ancestors.   In 1967 a travelling Baha'1 teacher from
Tarana came to Kasod.        He met with the patel and a meeting was arranged
for that evening.        After the meeting, ten persons signed declaration
cards, and the village's Local Spiritual Assembly was fo_med in April of the
next year.       Another ten inhabitants decJ.ared in 1968, and by the time a

Situated ten miles north of the small ,town of Nagda (a main junction
on the Bombay-Delhi line) in Ujjain district is the village community of

Like Kasod it is linked to the outside world by a rugged unpaved
road which during the rainy season - late June to mid-September - is
virtually impassable.     Richa is inhabited by 324 people including
78 Brahmans, 58 Rajputs, 42 Gujarati Balais, 4o Gujarati Chamars,
32 Muslims, 21 Sadhus, 20 Gujarati Lahars, 18 Telis, 7 Bhangis,    4 Nais,
and 4 Jains.   Of the five villages, Rich a and Garabeli maintain the
widest range of castes.      Also like Garabeli, Richa harbors a small
Muslim community, and therefore, in addition to Hindu temples, Muslim
shrines dot the landscape.

Like other rural communi ties in Malwa, Rich a's fields yield ample
harvests of wheat, barley, cotton, and sugar cane.      Tnirteen hundred
bi/shas of land are owned by the inhabitants, and only a small number of
families from among the scheduled castes fail to own any land.

Richa was founded over a thousand years ago by Briihm~s, and the
pa}el traces his ancestry back to these original settlers.      Tne village
contains a large shrine dedicated to Sftala Mata, and inhabitants claim
it dates from the time of the community's founding.      The shrine is quite
well-known throughout the Nagda area, and nwnerous members of nearby
villages come to offer puja at its threshhold.      In 1971 a Baha'i
travelling teacher from Ujjain visited Richa.      During his stay he managed
to convert a young tertiary-educated Rajput who subsequently attended
'deepening' classes in Ujjain.     ,Upon returning he was able to enlist
another eight persons into the movement, and thus in April of 1972 the
first Local Spiritual Assembly in Richa was formed.      During the next
year forty additional inhabitants declared their belief in Baha'u'llat,
and today there are forty-eight declarants in Richa.

It is not the intention of this study to present the above
communities as 'ideal types' of Baha'i 'model village' communities in
Malwa.      Rather, the primary purpose for presenting the reader with a
short description and statistical synopsis of each village has been to
put before him a general sociological picture of the five communities
from which the author's later examples of the implementation of Baha'i
doctrines and institutions in rural Malwa were taken, ani'. thereby provide
him with an existential base to which he can orient himself.           It seems
apparent,    however, that the data reveals certain facts about each
community which might shed some light on the variety of sociological
factors that characterize Baha'i      ·~odel   villages' in general.    Consequently,
before closing this chapter a few remarks concerning the dominant
sociological characteristic of each community will be made.

The outstanding sociological characteristic of the Garabeli Baha'i
community is its large number of low caste constituents.          The community
was established during the early years of mass teaching in Malwa when the
Baha'i teaching approach was oriented towards the scheduled castes.           In
addition, intra-village strife seems to have alienated many lower casteman
from their social superiors, thus creating a situation in which the Baha'i
Faith provided a symbol for scheduled caste grievances.          Consequently,
Garabeli appears to be a good example of scheduled caste attraction to
the movement.

In Richa a different factor predominates.          Unlike Larabeli, there is
a greater balance between high and low caste membership.          However, in terms
of declarant's age distribution, Richa' s community is characteristically
young.      For example,   66% of the members are under thirty years of age,
and 95% under forty.        Here it seems the Baha'i Faith speaks to the
idealism of youth, as the village teacher -who is himself only twenty-
seven years old - has been able to enlist many of his own age group from
among both high and low castes.

The other communities appear to revolve around specific individuals.

Karankani, Manasa, and Kasod's headmen are Baha'1s, and accordingly,a
number of people under their influence have enrolled.       Similarly, the
Balai teacher in Kasod has been able to enrol a number of his fellow
castemen.

Consequently, there appear to be three main sociological agents
affecting the composition of Baha'i communities in the five villages:
caste background, age, and personal status.    While it is not possible to
draw finalized conclusions from these examples as to the nature of Baha'i
'model village' communities in general, they do provide some insight into
the types of factors influencing the declarations of Hindu villagers in
Malwa (a theme which will be explored at greater length in Chapter 12),
and therefore they deserve to be noted.

It is into village communities like Garabeli, Manasa, Kasod,
Karankani, and Richa that Baha'i doctrine and institutions are being
introduced.   This chapter has attempted to present a general picture
of the sociological nulieu in which such villages function.       It is now
time to look at the structure that is directing the activities of the
Baha'i Faith in Malwa:   the Baha'1 Administrative Order.

Chapter 5       The Baha'i Administrative Order

The Baha'i Faith is an international movement, and hence its
administrative institutions act like links in a chain;      they help connect
individual Baha'f communities with tlle larger body of believers throughout
the world.     The administrative system is multi-levelled in construction,
containir,g local and regional, national, and international institutions.
It is this system that is conducting the world-wide advancement of the
Baha'i Faith, and its influence can be seen wherever Baha'i communities
exist.    This is no less true in Malwa where mass teaching has resulted
in strenuous organizational activity on all three administrative levels.
Therefore, it is essential that we tal<e a closer look at the administrative
institutions of the Baha'{ Faith.

The heart of the Baha'i Administrative Order is the Universal House
of Justice, a body of nine whose headquarters is located in Haifa, Israel.
The members of this body are elected every five years by the members of
the various national spiritual assemblies throughout the world.      The first
Universal House of Justice was elected in 1963, six years after the death
of Shoghi Effendi;     the second in 1968; and today the Baha'i world
community is under the guidance of the third duly elected Universal
House of Justice.

The authority of the Universal House of Justice is derived from the
Faith's scriptures.     According to the official Baha'i translation of
The Tablet of Ishragat, Baha'u'llah states:

> The affairs of the people are in charge of the men
> of the House of Justice of God. They are the trustees
> of God among His servants and the sources of command in
> His countries ••• It is incumbent upon all to obey them.l
Baha'u'll!i4, The Tablet of Ishraqat, trans. by Shoghi Effendi, in The
Baha'i Revelation, p. 159

Elaborating upon this theme         1Abdu '1-Baha   IIrote:

> By this House is meant that Universal House of
> Justice which is to be elected from all countries,
> that is, from those parts in the East and \>lest
> where the loved ones are to be f'ound, after the
> manner of the customary elections in \Vestern
> countries such as those of England. 2
Being the supreme institution in the Baha'i \IOrld, the Universal House
of Justice has the right to interpret the Faith's scriptures, that is, the

IIri tings of Bah a' u 'lliih and       Abdu '1-Baha, and to legislate on any matter
not found in the IIri tings.            Again, this right is claimed from scriptural
authority; 'It is incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of' Justice to
take counsel together regarding such la\Is as have not been expressly
revealed in the Book.        Of these whatever they deem advisable and proper
that must ~hey enforce. • 3

Unlike elected representatives of contemporary parliamentary systems,
once elected, members of the Universal House of Justice are not responsible
to those they represent; they have no constituency to IIhom they must answer.
In fact, the election process is devoid of any type of electioneering or
campaigning.      Rather, the assembled members of the various national
spiritual assemblies cast nine votes, each containing the name of any
person they feel worthy of holding such a position.              The nine 1vho receive
the most votes then form the Universal House of Justice.              In this regard
Shoghi Effendi stated:

> In the conduct of the administrative affairs of the
> Faith, the enactment of the legislation necessary
> to supplement the la\Is of the Kitab-i-Aqrlas, the
> members of the Universal House of Justice, it should
> be borne in mind, are not, as Baha'u'll8h's utterances
> clearly imply, responsible to those whom they rer ,·esent,
> nor are they allo\Ied to be governed by the feelings,
> the general opinion, and even the convictions of' the mass

Thus, the decisions of the Universal House of Justice      ar~   considered free
from all error.5

Included among the duties of the Universal House of Justice are the
following:     to analyze, classify, and co-ordinate the Baha'i vritings;
to defend and protect the Faith and emancipate it from the fetters of
repression and persecution;       to propagate and teach its message; to expand
and consolidate its institutions;      to enact lavs and ordinances not found
in the scriptures;    and to provide for the arbitration and settlement of

disputes between peoples.

Some of the Universal House of Justice's most active work is rendered
in the areas of propagation and consolidation, and it is in reference to
these activities that the institution most directly influences Baha'i work
in Halwa.     The systematic programs of expansion that characterize the
world-wide Baha'i teaching effort are both conceived and guided to fruition
by the Universal House of Justice.       For example, in 1964 the Universal
House of Justice issued to the Baha'i world its first international teaching
project.     Known as the Nine-Year Plan1 it set out goals to be achieved in
every part of the world.        In terms of the Indian community the Plan called
for, among other things, the raising of the number of localities vhere
Baha'is resided to 20,000, 7which in effect meant the continuation of the
mass teaching campaign in the subcontinent.        Betveen the years

1964 and l9T3 Balla' 1 activities in Malwa,therefore, were geared to mass
teaching.

During the course of the Nine-Year Plan the Universal House of Justice
gave constant support and advice to the Indian Bah a' 1 community.         By means

of written as well as personal communication       the Universal House of
Justice encouraged the Indian National Spiritual Assembly to outline and
execute small teaching plans of their own which would help bring about
the overall objectives.     For example, in November of 1968 they wrote to
the National Spiritual Assembly:

> Your six-month teaching plan by which specific goals
> are assigned to various centres made us very happy and
> reassured us that the beloved friends in India are once
> again determined to seize the palm of victory and go
> on to new heights of achievement in the path of the
> Cause of God. 9

Consequently, it is the Universal House of Justice that determines the
pace and direction of Baha'1 teaching activities throughout the world, and
its decisions have a direct influence on propagation activities in Malwa.

The Universal House of Justice is also involved in supervising the
consolidation efforts of the movement in Malwa.        All major decisions in
the area of mass education, such as the creation of teaching institutes and
the development of village primary schools, must be ratified by the
Universal House of Justice before they can be put into effect.        In
addition, the Universal House of Justice advises the national and regional
administrative bodies as to the best way of using such institutions.           In
general, they outline the purpose and function of each institution and
ensure that it is used in the most efficient manner.        For example,
concerning     the institution of the travelling teacher (see Chapter 6),

8 This refers to the Hands of the Cause, seep. 146-147
9 'Message of Nov 3, 1968•, Extracts from Communication of the Universal
House of Justice, unpublished, p. 152

the Universal House of Justice has written:

> One of the most important duties of such travelling
> teachers should be to develop nuclei of devoted and
> active believers in the many centres who would inspire
> and assist the friends in active participation in
> the work to be done in their villages and t01ms ,10

The dimension of the Universal House of Justice's influence in the
formulation of consolidation plans in India can be gleaned from their new

Five-Year Plan                        , in which they call on the Indian community to:

> Plan and carry out a program for the training of one
> or more believers from local communities having a
> Local Spiritual Assembly which will enable them to
> assist their fellow believers to deepen in the Cause
> and to work for the consolidation of the corroounity; ..•
> increase the number of village tutorial schools, .•.
> and organize correspondence courses for deepening the
> friends in the knowledge of the Cause.12
While the Universal House of Justice is the focal point around which
all administrative activity revolves, the administrative system of the
Baha'i Faith is by no means characterized by an overt centralism; national,
regional,              ~~d       local institutions play a profound role in directing the
affairs of the movement.                                        In India these institutions are particularly
oriented towards the phenomenon of mass teaching, and cor.3equently they
greatly influence activities in Malwa.

The most prominent Baha'i administrative institution in India is the
National Spiritual Assembly.                                             Like the Universal House of Justice, the
National Spiritual Assembly is composed of nine members elected annually
in convention by delegates who represent the various local Baha'i
communities throughout the country (see Chapter 10).                                                                               The first National
Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is. of India and Burma was elected in 1923,
and in 1973 the Indian Baha'i community celebrated the fiftieth
anniversary of the founding of this institution in the subcontinent.

The immediate purpose of the National Spiritual Assembly as outlined
by Shoghi Effendi:

> ..• is to stimulate, unify and co-ordinate by frequent
> personal consultations, the manifold activities of the
> friends as well as the local Assemblies; and by
> keeping in close and constant touch with the Holy
> Land, initiate measures, and direct in general the
> affairs of the Cause in that country.l3

Specifically, these purposes, as stated in the Declaration of Trust and
By-Laws of a National Spiritual Assembly are to be realized by means of:

devotional meetings; by public meetings an~
> conferences of an educational, humanitarian and
> spiritual character; by the publication of books,
> magazines and newspapers; by the construction of
> temples of universal worship and of other institutions
> and edifices for humanitarian service; by supervising,
> unifying, promoting and generally administering the
> activities of the Baha'is of O:ndiii.) in the fulfilment
> of their religious offices, duties and ideals; and by
> any oteer means appropriate to these ends, or any of
> them,l
As the fountainhead of the movement within India, the National Spiritual
Assembly both unifies and directs the work of Baha'1s throughout the
country.     \mat the Universal House of Justice does on the international
level, the National Spiritual Assembly does on the national leve1. 15

The headquarters of the Indian National Spiritual Assembly is located
in New Delhi.     Some of its meetings, however, are held in other cities of
the subcontinent, as it is generally the desire of the National Spiritual
Assembly to be present in a specific area when special projects or progrqms
relating to that area are being discussed.      Consequently, the National
Spiritual Assembly occasionally meets in the cities of Gwalior and Ujjain
where the need for teaching and consolidation plans is· tne greatest.

religious backgrounds:      Farsi (4), Hindu (3), Jain (1), and Muslim (l).
Of these nine, two are women, and six live in either of t.le two mass
teaching areas of Nadhya Pradesh.

The Indian National Spiritual Assembly is one of a group of national
spiritual assemblies in the Baha'i world that have been designated 'mass
teaching' assemblies, as 90% of its work is directed towards the mass
teaching effort.       Accordingly, the National Spiritual Assembly's
consultative sessions are largely consumed by hours spent in both
formulating teaching plans to fulfill the Universal House of Justice's
conversion goals and outlining specific projects designed to bring new
declarants into direct contact \lith the Faith's institutions.          For example,
it was the National Spiritual Assembly that formulated the original mass
teaching program in l·lalwa whereby paid travelling teachers took to rural
pathways to announce to the common people the arrival of the new avatara.
Likewise, the development of the Indore Teaching Institute, where numerous
early converts were 'deepened' in the knowledge of the Faith, was largely
the work of the Indian National Spiritual Assembly.

The National Spiritual Assembly appoints numerous committees to help it
carry out its designated functions.       The most important of these committees
as they influence Halwa are the State and Regional Teaching Committees,
the Publishing Trust Committee, and the National Youth Committee.

The National Youth Committee is composed of five members whose main
functions are to co-ordinate and develop Bahil 1 1 groups in colleges and
mliversi ties throughout India, and direct the movement of Balla 1 i youth
to vital areas of the country where assistance in teaching and consolidation
work is reQuired.       In terms of Bah8.'i activities in rural Malwa
the latter of these two functions is the more important.       Periodically,

\[16\] Electe d 1n
. Apr1'1 , 1973

Bah a' 1 youth from Poona and Bombay travel to Malwa to help in specific
teaching and consolidation projects.         As shall be seen in Chapter 6,
such groups form one of the communicative links between the Baha'1 village
communities in Malwa and the greater administrative system.

Another of the National Spiritual Assembly's committees which has a
direct influence on 'deepening' and consolidation work in Malwa is the
Publishing Trust Committee.         This committee is responsible for making
decisions concerning the type and amount of material to be printed          and
its   subse~uent    publication into various regional languages.     One of the
committee's main tasks since the advent of the mass teaching campaign has
been to develop suitable educational materials for a largely illiterate
population.        Conse~uently,   it has seen fit to produce large numbers of
books and pamphlets written in clear and simple Hindi for semi-literate
individuals as well as pictorial publications for those members of Baha'i
communities who are unable to read.         Since it is difficult for Bah a' 1
adFinistrative institutions to maintain continuous person'k contact with
the numerous village communities in Malwa, written and visual teaching
aids have assumed a strategic position in the Administrative Order's
overall teaching objectives, and therefore       the Publishing Trust   Com.~ittee

continues to play an integral role in propagation and consolidation
programs in Malwa.

\fuile the National Spiritual Assembly formulates national propagation
and consolidation strategy, it is the various teaching committees that
are the arms of the administrative structure in India.          These institutions
work at the grass root levels in the mass teaching areas         and are largely
responsible for the implementation of both the Universal House of Justice's
and the National Spiritual Assembly's plans and programs.

Individual teaching committees were first created by the National
Spiritual Assembly during the mass teaching era.         Before this time a
single teaching committee was in charge of propagation and consolidation

activities for the entire country.      However, after the sudden increase in
declarations the National Spiritual Assembly decided that special teaching
committees whose jurisdiction would cover specific areas of the country
were necessary to the overall development of the Faith, as a unitary body
could no longer handle the immense amount of work required to continue mass
teaching projects and develop 'deepening' programs.      Consequently, in 1962
area teaching committees were formed.      During the following years, however,
the organization of teaching committees was rearranged, so that today there
exist two types of teaching committees:     the State Teaching Committee,
which as its name implies is in charge of the overall direction of teaching
and consolidation activities within a specific state of India;     and the
subordinate Regional Teaching Committee, which manages similar activities
in specific regions of a given state.      The latter generally exist in
areas where mass teaching has resulted in a large number of declarations
and the work of educating new declarants therefore cannot be accommodated
by a single committee.     Such is the case in Hadhya Pradesh where two
regional committees have been established, one for northern Madhya Pradesh
(Gwalior), and another for southern Madhya Pradesh (Ujjain).      Propagation
and consolidation activities in Malwa are under the supervision of the
Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee.

The primary function of these committees is to implement in the form
of specific projects the teaching and consolidation goals of the National
Spiritual Assembly,      Although under the supervision of that body, teaching
committees have been given the authority to act on all matters relating to
teaching and consolidation work in their areas.      For example, they can
institute publications, adopt translation and printing programs, appoint
teachers, and organize institutes and conferences.      Therefore, the teaching

committees are the custodians of the teaching and consolidation vork in
India.      As the Universal House of Justice vrote, they are the 'strong
hands' of the National Spiritual Assembly. 1 7

In Hadhya Pradesh the State Teaching Committee is primarily a
managerial body.     It makes decisions concerning a vide range of activities
and then passes on its resolutions to the Ujjain and Gwalior coJmflittees
for consideration,      Its main duties as outlined by the National Spiritual
Assembly are:     to assist the development of regional cownittees into
efficient teaching centers;     to help said   corr~ittees   in formulating
teaching and consolidation plans;     and to guide and assist them in the

publication and translation of literature.

The Madhya Pradesh State Teaching Committee consists of seven members
appointed annually by the National Spiritual Assembly.          It meets monthly
in either New Delhi, Gwalior, or Ujjain.       An examination of the minutes
of its opening session for the year 1973 reveals the types of questions on
which it consults.      The first item of business concerned the sending of
pioneers 19 to areas in the state where local groups needed assistance in
consolidating their communities.      Next the members discussed sending
travelling teachers to localities where mass teaching projects were to
be implemented.      Finally, they revie,red the questions of strengthening
village administrative institutions     and organizing teacher training
classes and special 'deepening' sessions to be held at the Indore Teaching

motion of specific plans to fulfill the particular goal.                   These suggestions
were then sent to the Ujjain and Gwalior Regional Teaching Committees.

The Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee, like the Madhya Pradesh State
Teaching Committee, is composed of seven members appointed annually by the
National Spiritual Assembly.                Its headq_uarters is located in Ujjain, where
it meets bi-monthly.              Its specific duties include the fo'lowing:        to assist

local Baha 1 f groups in consolidating and strengthening their conununi ties;
to supervise mass teaching activities for the region; to organize the
activities of travelling teachers; to arrange               deepen~ng   classes, conferences,
and teacher 1 s training classes; to implement plans for the education of
village Baha 1 1s in the knowledge of the laws and institutions of the Baha 1 1
Faith;       to establish direct contact with all the localities under its
jurisdiction through written and personal means of communication; and in
general to implement the projects of the State Teaching Committee and the

National Spiritual Assembly.                 These duties can be distilled into two
essential categories:
a) the generation and co-ordination of teaching activities,

and
b) the education of village conmunities in the various aspects

of Baha 1 1 community life.
In terms of teaching work it is the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee
that is responsible for organizing                the manpo"rer and ass :ts of the BahS: 1 {
corr~unities        in Malwa.      Accordingly, it is in charge of sending pioneers
and teaching teams to those districts in the region which the State Teaching
Committee has selected as goal areas.                In addition, it selects, trains,

and supervises the activities and movements of the region's corps of
travelling teachers (see Chapter 6), and earmarks funds for specific
teaching projects.          Conse~uently,   the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee
is the nerve-center from which all propagation activity in Malwa is
directed.

The second responsibility of the Cbmmittee is to assist in the
development of Baha'i 'model village' communities in Malwa.                   In this
regard it helps educate village declarants to understand and use the
Faith's socio-religious institutions.             The Committee implements its
'deepening' projects by making use of four main channels of communication:
written sources, teaching institutes, travelling teachers, and consolidation
teams.      An entire chapter (Chapter 6) will be devoted to discussing these
communicative channels.          For now, suffice it to say that the Ujjain
Regional Teaching Committee employs such institutions to •eaintain contact with
local communities under its jurisdiction              and thereby keep   &~   open flow of
communication between said communities and the Baha'1 Faith's greater
administrative system.

In short, the National Spiritual Assembly and its various committees
are the driving force behind Baha'1 propagation and consolidation work in
Malwa.      They formulate mass teaching plans, create institutions to carry
out these plans, and devise methods and means by which Baha'i values and
institutions can be introduced into village life.               In so doing they
direct the resources of the Indian Baha'i community towards accomplishing
the Universal House of Justice's prescribed teaching goals, and thereby
fulfill thelr

l l les 1 • 22
The bedrock of the Baha'i Administrative Order is the Local Spiritual
Assembly.      In each community where there reside nine or more Bah B. 'ls,
this locally elected body supervises and administers to the needs of
believers.      Since a more detailed analysis of its functions >!ill be made

22 Principles of Baha'i Administration, p. 74

in Chapter 10, vhere theY' will be discussed in light of the institution's
introduction into two 'model villages 'J for the present it will only be
pointed out that the Local Spiritual Assembly is the foundation stone of
the Baha'i national community, and its proper and efficient functioning
is a pre-req_uisite for the development of teaching and consolidation
plans within a given country.

Running parallel to the elected administrative institutions of
the Faith, the Universal House of Justice, the National Spiritual Assembly,
and the Local Spiritual Assembly, is a group of institutions whose members
are appointed rather than elected.     In descending order of authority
they are:   the Hands of the Cause, The Continental Board of Counsellors,
and the Auxiliary Board.     Individuals assigned to these institutions
counsel and advise both the elected administrative bodies and individual
believers in matters pertaining to the advancement of the Faith: the
Hands of the Cause work at the international level; counsellors perform
at the continental and national level; and board members work within
specific countries.

The Hands of the Cause are a select group of appointed believers
whose main function is to help propagate and protect the Baha'i Faith on
an international scale.    Their origin as an institution is traced back

According to the Faith's records~ Bah8.'u'll8.h
appointed four Hands, about whom he said:      'Ere long will God raise up
through T11ee conquering Hands and subduing Helpers who will come forth
from behind veils and will arise to win victory for the Manifestation of

God, the All-Merciful amongst all mankind. •        Although 'Abdu' 1-Baha
did not assign any Hands during his years of leadership, he testified to

their station and provided for their appointment by Shoghi Effendi.
Hence, in December of 1951 Shoghi Effendi appointed tvelve Hands of the
23 Bah a' u' 1lah, Suriy-i-Haykal, quoted in The Baha' 1 Hor1d, vol. XIII,

\[24\] 'Abdu'l-Baha, Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, p. l.

Cause, and several months later he assigned another seven persons to this
rank, bringing their total to nineteen.      This number was maintained until
1957, when a few months before his death Shoghi Effendi added eight more
names to the list of Hands of the CauseJ thus finalizing their number at
twenty-seven. 25     During the last seventeen years fifteen Hands have
passed away, and since only the Guardian had the authority to appoint them,
no further Hands of the Cause have been or will be appointed. 26

The Hands of the Cause form a personal communicative link between
the Universal House of Justice and the various Baha'i communities throughout
the world.     Each Hand has been assigned a specific area of the world in
which he meets and consults with national spiritual assemblies and oversees
the general range of Baha'i activities.     Hands are especially instrumental
in advising national spiritual assemblies concerning the formulation
of teaching plans.     This duty was assigned to them by Shoghi Effendi
during the Ten-Year Crusade.      In June of 1957 he cabled:   'TO ITS
I!E'NLY ASSUNED RESPONSIBILITY ASSIST NATIONAL SPIRITUAL   ASSE!~BLIES   BAHA 1 I

HORLD SPECIFIC PURPOSE EFFECTIVELY PROSECUTING HORLD SPIRITUAL CRUSADE •.• •
Since that time, Hands of the Cause have been actively involved in
helping national spiritual assemblies develop national teaching
projects.

\[25\] Between the years 1952 and 1957 five Hands of the Cause passed away,

> and their positions were filled by another five appointees. Thus,
> there were in all thirty-t>JO Hands of the Cause appointed by Shoghi

2 6 In its message of June 24, 1968, the Universal House of Justice said

> it saw no way in which additional Hands of the Cause could be

Periodically the Hands return to the Holy Land where they apprise the
Universal House of Justice of the current state of af'fai rs in the countries
under their jurisdiction.        Hence, the Hands of the Cause provide a direct
channel of communication between the International Center and the various
national administrative bodies throughout the world.

One Hand of the Cause who has been intimately involved with the mass
teaching movement in Malwa is Dr. Rahmatu'llii.h Huhajir.       Being assigned
his position by Shoghi Effendi in 1957, he vas one of' the last Hands of' the
Cause to be appointed.        During his years of service he has worked closely
with the Indian National Spiritual Assembly, and     ~s   was mentioned in Part I
of' this study l it was his decision to hold a village teaching conference in
Malwa in early 1961 that set the mass teaching movement in Madhya Pradesh in
motion.    For years he had advocated taking the message of the Faith to
India's   masses.     With the breakthrough in Malwa his vision became a
reality, and from that time on      the entire orientation of the   Ba~a'f   Faith
in India changed;     after   1961, teaching plans, consolidation activities,
and communicative channels vere all steered in the direction of mass teaching.

Dr. Muhajir has also been active in advising the IniHan Baha'is how to
consolidate and strengthen their new village communities.         lle played an
instrumental role in both the establishment of' India's first teaching
institute in Indore     and the purchase of a Baha'f Center in Ujjain.        In
addition, he makes occasional trips to the mass teaching areas to meet with
and encourage local Baha'is in their teaching work.       For example, in March
of' 1974 he made a special visit to Ujjain to help organize a consolidation
project whereby teams of Baha'i youth visited selected village communities
in order to encourage local believers to attend 'deepening' classes at the
Indore Teaching Institute.

The increasing responsibilities that fell on the Hands of' the Cause as
a result of the continuous growth of' the movement throughout the world            led
the Universal House of Justice in 1968 to create a new institution designed
to aid the Hands in the performance of' their dual duties of propagating and

protecting the Baha'1 Faith.      In June of that year the Universal House of
Justice announced to the Baha' :1 world that they had established eleven
continental boards of counsellors which would be responsible for the
propagation and protection of the Faith in their respective zones.            The
activities of the continental boards were to follov the pattern of' the
relationship between the Hands of the Cause and national spiritual assemblies

as outl 2ne                                 commun2ca               Thus, counsellors
were to carry out many of the same activities that had at one time been the
sole responsibility of the Hands of the Cause.

India is under the jurisdiction of' the Continental Board of' Counsellors
for South Central Asia.     The four members who make up this body meet
periodically with the Indian National Spiritual Assembly in order to consult
on the range of Baha'i activities within the country.            In addition to their
capacity as advisors, counsellors are often directly involved in specific
teaching and consolidation projects.       In both instances they maintain close
contact with the Hands of the Cause to whom they supply information and
with >rhom they consult and collaborate ..

Counsellor §b'Lr1n Boman Meheraban:l has been personally involved for
many years with the development of the Bah a '1 Faith in Nalwa.         She was
the first Baha 1 1 to settle in Malwa, establishing residence in Ujjain in
1942, and years later she was in the forefront of' the region's mass teaching
campaign.    After her appointment as a member of the Continental Board of
Counsellors for South Central Asia in 1968,her role in the mass teaching
areas became one of general overseer.        While not directly involved in the
formulation of teaching and consolidation projects, she offers advice
regarding their implementation     and on several occasions has taken to the
field to help carry them out.      For example, in ,January of 1974 she
consulted with the National Spiritual Assembly concerning the formulation of
a consolidation project whereby groups of more experienced Bah a '1s would
travel to several village cormnunities in Mal1m to meet with and instruct

\[28\] Wellspring of Guidance, p. 144

the local declarants in the workingll of llaha 1 1 community institutions.
Following the National Spiritual Assembly 1 s framing of a definite plan,
Mrs. Meherab1in1 headed one of the consolidation teams.

The continental counsellors have at their disposal another institution -
the Auxiliary Board.       This institution was established by Shoghi Effendi
in October of 1952.      In a cablegram dated October 8, 1952, he relayed the
following:

> CALL UPON FIF1'l~EN HANDS FIVE CONTINEN'rS, VIRTUE SUPREME

Today there are two auxiliary boards for South Central Asia.        The
first contains three members who are primarily concerned with protecting
the movement from external attack and internal division, while the second,
composed of fif'tcen members, is re,Jponsibie for helping propagate the
F'n.ith.    M0mbers activities are directed by the Continental Board of
Cuun:oclJor;, for 0outh Central Asia (by whom they have been appointed), and
they report to this body on a regular basis.      In Malw17 auxiliary board
members are especially instrumental in stimulating and encouraging local
communities to implement teaching and consolidation projects, and hence
they perform on the regional level many of' the same functions that
counsellors fulfill on the continental and national levels.

Being in direct contact with regional and local institutions,
o...uxiliary hoard members submit recommendations concerning teaching and
consolidation projects in their areas of jurisdiction to the Continental
Board of Co1msellors which can in turn approach the National Spiritual
Assembly.      The National Spiritual Assembly may then decide whether or not
to act on the recommendation.

2 9 'l11c llaha.' 1 World, vol. XIII, p. 335

Continental counsellors and auxiliary board members         are not
initiators of teaching and consolidation projects, neither do they
personally implement these activities;           this is the function of the National
Spiritual Assembly and its appointed committees.            While they can give advice
to the National Spiritual Assembly, the latter is by no means bound by their
suggestions.      Rather, the main function of these individuals is to help
the elected institutions implement their projects by providing personal
communicative links between the movement's various administrative levels.
Consequently, they maintain the flow of information and ensure that the
efforts of the Indian Baha'1 community will result in consistent and
unified action.     For example, 'If a National Spiritual Assembly has
adopted one goal as pre-eminent in a year, the Auxiliary Board members
should bear this in mind in all their contacts with the believers and
should direct their attention to the plans of the National Assembly
and stimulate them to enthusiastically support them.• 30

As can be gleaned from the foregoing outline, the administrative
machinery of the Baha'1 Faith is organized towards the propagation
and implementation of the movement's doctrines and ideals.            In order
to better understand how these institutions interact with one another,
and to exemplify the influence their decisions have on the local
village communities of Malwa, the evolution of a specific project will
be traced from its origin in the Holy Land to its actualization in
central India.

Several times during the course of this study reference has been made
to the important station the Local Spiritual Assembly occupies within the
overall framework of the Baha'i' Administrative Order.          Accordingly, the

\[30\] Baha' f News (United States),   :Iii 474,   September, 1970, (Wilmette,
Illinois), p. 2

establishment of these institutions in various countries throughout
the world is one of the Baha'i Faith's primary teaching goals.       In 1964
the Universal House of Justice issued to the Baha 1 1 world the Nine-Year
Plan, in which the Indian Baha'i community was called upon to raise the
number of local spiritual assemblies in the subcontinent to     4ooo.31
At the time of the Plan's initiation there were barely a thousand local
spiritual assemblies in India, and therefore the Universal House of
Justice had given the Indian National Spiritual Assembly the task of
directing a teaching campaign that within a nine year period would
quadruple the number of local spiritual assemblies within the country.

Having received the Nine-Year Plan goals from the Universal House of
Justice, the Indian National Spiritual Assembly consulted on the means
and methods by which the number of local spiritual assemblies could be
increased.     During the course of the Plan they mapped out several
smaller plans which lasted anywhere from six months to two years.         In
these plans different areas of the country were assigned specific teaching
goals, and corrwunities were called upon to support travelling teachers
and pioneers within the boundaries of their various states.       Meanwhile,
Dr. Nuhajir and the Continental Board of Counsellors for South Central
Asia   mai~tained   frequent communication with the National Spiritual AssemblyJ
offering their advice and guidance.       Periodically, Dr. Muhajir notified
the Universal House of Justice as to the progress of the Nine-Year Plan
in India.

The teaching committees were assigned the responsibility of implementing
the National Spiritual Assembly's various teaching plans.       Before 1973
this meant that local spiritual assembly objectives were given directly
to the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee.       The committee would then
draw up specific proposals designed to fulfill their assigned goals.

\[31\] Nine-Year Plan for the Baha'1s of India, page number not listed

Having calculated the number of travelling teachers needed to accomplish
a particular objective, the Committee would begin to mobilize the
resources under its sway:     veteran teachers would be assigned specific
localities;     training courses for new teachers would be arranged;   and
follow-up groups to help in the formation of new assemblies would be
organized.

At the same time, the Continental Board of Counsellors for South
Central Asia would direct auxiliary board menibers to visit local communities
such as Ujjain, Indore, and Shajapur where they would encourage individual
believers and local spiritual assemblies to give their support to the
teaching effort by offering prayers, financial assistance, manpower, or
whatever additional help they could offer.

'l'ravelling teachers would then be dispatched to their assigned areas.

For the duration of the project they would keep the Ujjain Regional
Teaching Committee informed of the numbers of declarations they had
obtained     and the names and locations of the villages in which these
declarations had taken place.     The Committee would in turn inform the
national office in New Delhi.      SubseQuently, plans for officially forming
the new assemblies would be drawn up, and on the first day of Ri(lviin

(April 21),      specially designated teachers, often under the supervision
of an auxiliary board member, would be sent to those villages in which
nine or more declarations had been received, and there supervise the
election of the local spiritual assemblies.

In this way, working through its system of elected and appointed
institutions, the Baha'f Administrative Order carries out its teaching
and consolidation projects.      What begins as a general goal in Haifa

32               -"'1   ...                             ,
The day Baha u'llah declared his mission in   Ba~Q!dad.

is rareified by means of multi-levelled consultative planning                and finally
transformed into a social reality in the rural tablelands of Malwa.

In the preceding pages the essential features of the administrative
system that is directing the advancement of the Balla '1 Faith both in
Malwa and in numerous countries of the world ha:ve·been surveyed.                Before
cJ.osing, however, it wouJ.d be appropriate to say a few          >~ords   concerning
the metaphysical and sociological assumptions that underlie the system,
for a1thOW£h they wiJ.l be elaborated upon at greater length in Part III,
the timelineus of the occasion warrants a brief discussion.

'rhe administrative institutions of the Baha'i Faith reflect in their
struct urc and modes of operation some of the basic ideals found in the
movement's World view.'     Just   ac;   a direct relationship can be seen
between the values     and ideals that constitute the 'world view! of popular
Hin<luisrn and its corresponding institutional manifestations, a similar
correlation can be observed between Baha'i ideals and social institutions.

The Bah a' f view of man as a social being is influenced by both
authoritarian and egalitarian ideals;         while all believers are considered
equal,    they are held to be subservient to a higher authority.

As in Islam, the faithful are conceived to be equal in the eyes of
God;     'In the estimation of God all men are equal. •. '33         On the institutional
plane this har; reculted. in the structure of the Faith's administrative

system heine strongly rnark.ed by democratic features.              For example,
members of local spiritual assemblies are selected by means of popular
election, the vote of each believer in the community holding the same
weight.    Moreover, altlJOugh they are not chosen by direct democratic
election, mem.berB of both national spiritual assemblies and the Universal

33 'Abdu '1-Baha, in Baha '1 World Faith, p. 240-21;1
By democratic i:-_; meant majority rule ..

House of Justice are elevated to their positions of authority by electors
whose powers can be traced back to the votes of individual believers (see
Chapter 10).      Even the appointed institutions are indirectly linked to
the democratic principle.      Except for the Hands of the Cause (of which
no more can be appointed) the members of these institutions are appointed
by elected bodies and are responsible to them.

The democratic principle is not just limited to the selection of
administrators;     it is also part and parcel of the decision making process
within council chambers.     All    Baha'i~administrative          institutions from
the Universal House of Justice to a local committee are organized around
the concept of Baha'i consultation          whereby each member of the said body
equally presents his or her opinion on a given matter.                 'When meeting
for consultation, each must use perfect liberty in stating his views and

1   35     After discussion, all
unveiling the proof of his demonstration.
decisions are reached by majority vote.

It would be incorrect, however, to perceive Baha'1 administrative
institutions only in the light of democratic ideals.                 In the first place,
they are all subservient to higher laws - the laws of God as revealed by
Baha' u t llab and interpreted by   l   Abdu 1 1-Baha and Shoghi Effendi.      Accordingly,
the powers of any given Baha'1 institution are limited by scriptural
revelation;    an assembly cannot change the laws of the Book.              Likewise,
members of appointed institutions are bound by the laws of their office.
Only the Universal House of Justice has the right to interpret the laws

of Baha'u'llah, but even this institution cannot change the divine text.
Secondly, as previously mentioned, once elected, assembly members are not
responsible to those who elect them.           As Shoghi Effendi aptly stated:
35 'Abdu'l-Baha, in Baha'i World Faith,         p.     4o6
36 Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llab, p. 149-150

The Administrative Order of the Faith of
> Baha'u'llan must in no wise be regarded as purely
> democratic in character inasmuch as the basic
> assumption which requires all democracies to
> depend fundamentally upon getting their mandate
> from the peopJ7 is altogether lacking in this
> Dispensation.

Consequently, while the administrative system is characterized by
democratic principles in terms of method of election and means of decision
making, as a whole it must be viewed as a type of autocracy in which the
law of Baha'u'llah stands supreme.

Since the beginning of mass teaching, Baha':l administrative
institutions in India have not only directed propagation activities in
Malwa;   they have also been responsible for maintaining contact with
the new declarants and educating a number of them in the various aspects
of Baha'i community life.     In performing these tasks they rely on several
important channels of commtmication, the operation of which will be the
subj cct of Chapter 6.

Chapter 6         ChE.:tilnels of Communication

One of the foremost obstacles facing the Bah a' 1 Administrative Order
in India is the    mainten~<nce    of regular channels of corrununication with
individual Baha'1 village communities.            The large number of communi ties,
the slow means of transportation, and lack of manpower have all added to
this difficulty.         In an attempt to mitigate this problem, the Baha'i
Administrative Order has established four channels of communication.               The
principal function of these institutions is to keep village Baha''Ls in
contact with the movement's regional, national, and international
administrative institutions; and thereby help facilitate the implementation
of Bah a''[ concepts and values into their lives.           The four channels of
communication include written material, teaching institutes, travelling
teachers, and consolidation teams.

Not being dependent on the movement of specific persons, the written
word provides the most extensive corununicative link in Malwa; circulars and
newsletters can be produced in great         ~uantity   and then mailed to numerous
communities.      Baha'1 communities in Malwa receive written communication
from two sources: the national office in New Delhi, and the Regional
Teaching Committee office in Ujjain.           It takes several forms, ranging from
letters and memos to newspapers and books.

The    villagers~    initial contact with written communication takes place
when they declare their belief in Baha'u'lliih.            At that time Baha'i teachers
read to them the official Baha'1 declaration form which they must sign by
either applying their signature or impressing their thumbprint.             In
cities, where converts are generally literate, individual enrolment' cards
are used, but in the mass teaching areas one large sheet for each village
is employed.      The following is a translation of the declaration sheet used
in Halwa,

Declaration Sheet;
> 0 God, Guide me, protect me, illumine the lamp of my heart
> and make me a brilliant star. Thou art the powerful and
> the mighty.

On signing this form I make a declaration of my faith in Bah a 'u' lliih,
the manifestation (avatara) of the Baha'i Faith.      I believe in the
spiri tua.I station of his herald the Bab and the ideals of the religion
of God, and in the revealed teachings of !lis Holiness Bar'i:'u'lliih.   I
accept the sacred station of 'Abdu' 1-Baha.
With this knowledge I knowingly submit for enrolment in the Baha' :l
community, of which the principles, laws and institutions were founded
by Ba.ha'u'lliih, and are compulsory to the faith of every loyal believer.

lbese forms are collected by village teachers and returned to the
Regional Teaching Committee office in Ujjain from where they are forwarded
to New Delhi.    In some cases the forms are not gathered up immediately
but are left behind with a responsible person in the village so that the

villagers can have sufficient time to make their decision.        The forms are
later returned by mail to the Regional Teaching Committee office.

Upon receiving the declaration sheets, the Regional Teaching Committee
Secretary addresses a letter to the declarants, welcoming them into the
Bah a''[ community and again reminding them of their new responsibilities as
BahS.' ls.   The following is a translation of a typical welcoming letter:

1 Unpublished correspondence of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is
of India, 'Letter to the Uni versa.I House of Justice, July 16, 1966'.

Dear friend (name)
village
Allah'u'Abha (God is most great)

The knowledge of your acceptance of the supreme manifestation
( yugavatara) of this age is very joyous.      On this holy and sacred
occasion please accept in a personal way the cordial congratulations of
the Bah a' 1 community.

Having made manifest our faith in the divine teachings of His
Holiness Baha'u'lliih, our responsibility as Baha'is is noG finished,
rather it increases.      Because, after becoming a Baha'1, it is our
sacred duty, having obtained this message, to inform others of the
sheltering canopy of Baha'u'lliih so that his spiritual message can
progress.

It is hoped that after becoming a Baha'i, while receiving the
benefits of His Holiness Baha'u'llah, you will give the proper time to
all of your Baha'i duties, and that you will prove yourself to be of
an ideal devotee of Lord Baha'u'lliih.

In His service
Secretary RTC

Once a community has been established within a village,the group
receives on a regular basis two newsletters: one from the national office
in New Delhi, and the other from the Regional Teaching Committee.

The national office publishes quarterly a small circular entitled
Bahai     Sam~c~r Patra (Baha'1 Newsletter).    Its main purpose is threefold:
to introduce villagers to some of the writings of Baha'u'lliih and
'Abdu'l-Baha; to familiarize them with Baha'i principles; and to inform
them of Baha'1 activities both in India and throughout the world.        For
example, the Bahai Sam~c~r Patra for February, 1974, contained a passage from
The Hidden Words, a commentary on meditation and reflection by      1 Abdu'l-Baha,

several references to the duties of the Local Spiritual Assembly, and news
of Baha'i activities in other parts of the country.     To give an example of
just one of these items, reproduced below is a translation of part of an
article written to inform village believers of the Universal House of
Justice's new Five-Year Plan initiated in India in May of 1974:

> The supreme institution the Universal House of Justice
> addressing the Baha'i world by means of their message
> to the national spiritual assemblies dated November 26,
> 1973, has made the announcement of the auspicious news
> that on the holy occasion of Ri~van 1974 (April 21 -
> May 2) the next plan for the spiritual conquest of the
> world will be launched, whose duration will be five years.
> To inform the friends concerning the significance and
> aims of this five year plan your National Spiri+ual
> Assembly has made preparations for the arrangement   05

a series of conferences in all parts of the country.
The Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee also produces a news bulletin
which is distributed to local Baha'i village communities in Malwa.      Its
form is essentially the same as Bru1ai Samacar Patra, except 3 being a local
publicationJmore emphasis is placed on Baha'1 activities in the immediate
areas of Malwa and Madhya Pradesh.     The importance of this bulletin as a
means of keeping contact with the villages was emphasized by the Universal
House of Justice when they wrote:

> The strength of the Regional 'l'eaching Committees in
> India is one of the important matters to which your
> National Spiritual Assembly must constantly pay
> attention. 'l'he contact of these communities with
> the believers is vital and we are therefore doubly
> appreciative of the frequent publication and circulation
> among thousands of Centres of this Bulletin by the
> Regional Teaching Committee of Ujjain. 3

Furthermore, the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee periodically publishes
a newspaper entitled Bahai Darsan    which contains a variety of articles,
ranging in content from Baha'i history to techniques of agricultural
production, and is distributed in numerous village communities.      The

2 Bahai Samacar Patra, Feb 25, 1974, (New Delhi), p. 8
3 'Message of July 25, 1972', Extracts from Communication of the Universal
House of Justice, p. 30

popuJ.arity of the newspaper among local inhabitants prompted the National
Spiritual Assembly to write to the Ujjain Regional 'l'eaching Committee:

> We are happy to receive your letter of the 6th of
> 1 Izzat    and to note that each issue of Baha'i
> Darshan is read with great interest by. the friends
> and that you have been able to add more deepening
> material to it.      Please rest assured that all
> possible assistance and co-operation will be given
> by the National Office ~o make your efforts more
> fr.ui t fu1 and effective.
In addition to the newsletters and Baha:I Darsan, the Baha'i
Administrative Order in India also produces books and pamphlets printed in
simple language for semi-literate readers and picture cards and visual aids
for those who are unable to decipher the written word.      In all cases,
however, the main purpose of these publications is to keep an open channel
of communication between the infant communities and the Baha'i Administrative
Order, and in the process help \leepen' new declarants in the teachings of the
Baha'i Faith.

In return, Baha'i village cownunities are requested to send written
communication to the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee or the National
Spiritual Assembly    informing those bodies of their activities.    In this
way the administrative institutions learn which communities are actively
functioning and which are not - information which enab1es them to organize
future consolidation plans.

Written communication, however, faces one serious problem in Malwa-
illiteracy.     As is revealed in the statistics of the five model villages
cited in Chapter 4, less then half of the members would be competent enough
to read even simple Hindi with any degree of efficiency.      The Baha'i
Administrative Order has long been aware of this situation.      From the
beginning of the mass teaching campaing in Malwa serious thought was given
to the problem of developing means of communication that wouJ.d not be

completely dependent on the written word.       This consultation eventuated
in October of 1961 in the purchase of a building and grounds in Indore
and the subsequent establishment on that site of a Baha'f teaching institute,
the first of its kind in the Baha'f world.       One of the main functions
of the Institute was to educate new village declarants in the finer teachings
of the movement.5       During visits to village communities Baha'f teachers
would encourage specific believers to attend weekend or week-long classes
in Indore.      Transportation costs were payed for by the Ujjain Regional
Teaching Committee, and participants were provided with free room and
board.     During their stay they were instructed in all aspects of Baha'f
life.      'The subjects taught usually consist of Baha'i History, Laws
and Teachings, and the Administrative Order.       Special emphasis is laid
upon living the Baha'i life, the importance of teaching, prayer, fasting,
Nineteen Day Feasts, Baha'f elections, and contribution to the Fund. ,6

In 1964, following the success of the Indore 'reaching Institute, three
more institutes were established in India:      one in Gwalior, one in Devali,
and one in Mysore.      Also, as mentioned earlier, in 1965 grounds were
purchased in Ujjain, and many declarants from surrounding villages
began attending similar classes at this site.

In December of 1973 a special nine-day 'deepening' session was
held at the Indore Teaching Institute.       In order to better understand
the institution·' s educational function, a short account of the session
will be given.

Villagers at 1deepening' session

The Indore Teaching Institute is located in the Mill section of the
city of Indore.            Situated on several acres of land, the one-story, seven-
room building provides the class rooms and sleeping quarters for
particpating villagers.               Between December 25, 1973, and January 2, 1974,
a special 'deepening' session was conducted              in which twenty-eight English
speaking members and twenty-five Hindi speakers took part.               The English
speaking group was composed of persons primarily from urban areas, while
the Hindi classes were comprised of Malwa villagers.               The form and
content of both classes was identical.

The daily format of the session was as follows:              8 am to 9 am
individual prayer and meditation; 9 am to 10 am group prayer (individuals
take turns saying prayers -not congregational prayer) 7 ; 10 am to 12 am
class; 12 am to 2 pm free time; 2 pm to 3pm individual prayer and
meditation:; 3 pm to 4 pm group prayer; 4 pm to 6 pm class.               In the
evening general social intercourse between the participants took place.
During the nine-day session individuals did not leave the Institute
groWlds.         The effect of this stipulation was that the session became a

type Of        retreat I   >   Where believerS COuld COncentrate On What the instrUCtOrS
termed 'the spiritual realities of the world'.

The classes during the session were centered around the study of
several of Baha'u'lHih's writings, with the most emphasis being placed
on the examination of a small volume of his utterances - The Hidden Words
(Kalimat-i-MaknGnih).              For several years the National Spiritual Assembly
has been advising teaching committees and institute teachers to make use of
this volume in their 'deepening' sessions.               As was stated in a letter dated

7 For an explanation of Baha':l group prayer see Chapter 8.

March 5, 1971:

> National Assembly in its recent sessions, while

The classes \iere conducted orally so that those who could not read
would still be able to participate in the program.        The institute teacher
would read a given passage from The Hidden \Vords, after which, discussion
as to its meaning and implications commenced.      The teacher directed the
discussion, emphasizing those points in the passage which he felt \iere
particularly significant.      For example, the folloliing passage from The
Hidden IVords was read:

> The best beloved of all things in My sight is
> Justice; turn not away therefrom if thou desirest
> Me, and neglect it not that I may confide in thee.
> By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and
> not through the eyes of others, and shalt !mow of

> of thy neighbor. Ponder this in thy heart; how it
> behooveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift
> to thee and the sign of ~zy loving-kindness. Set
> it then before thine eyes.9

During the     discussion that f-Ollowed, the instructors presented the points
listed below:
l) the essence of justice is obedience to the commands of

Baha' u' 11M;
2) justice is relative to time and place and therefore justice

> in a given age is determined by the revelation of the avatara;
> and
3) justice in terms of social action (group or community action)

should be implemented by Baha'i institutions and not by individuals.

9 Baha' u 1 llah, Hidden \<lords, trans. by Shoghi Effendi, rev. ed. 1 (Wilmette,
Illinois, 1963), p. 3-4

In these elaborations one can notice two main lines of thought being
stressed.       First, individuals are reminded that social harmony is dependent
on their obedience to the prophet's utterances;            only by living the Law can
the maintenance of justice be assured.            Second, social justice is dependent
on the proper functioning of Baha'i institutions; without the benefit of a
strong administrative         superstructure the teachings of Baha 'u' ll&ih are
rendered useless.          Consequently, one of the principal purposes of such
classes is to instil into the minds of village declarants the importance of
adjusting their lives both individually and collectively to the commandments
of Baha'u'll&ih so that new patterns of behavior will begin to manifest
themselves within village communities in Malwa.

In addition to acting as a center for the dissemination of Baha'i
concept~     both metaphysical and social, the Indore Teaching Institute also
provides for the education of villagers by means of exemplary conditioning;
within the Institute all activities are governed by Baha'' principles and
rules of conduct.          Accordingly, participants study, worship, and eat
together,with no distinction being made according to ,caste           backgrounds.
Even in terms of sleeping arrangements there is no such distinction made,
and as a result     1

high 1 and 11ow 1 castemen can find themselves sharing the same

room.

During the nine day session various aspects of Baha'i life were
discussed (the study format being the same as the one mentioned above), and
at the conclusion of the course trainees were instructed to share the
knowledge they had acquired with their fellow village believers.              It is
in this regard that the Indore Teaching Institute serves its most
important function,for While the number of students who pass through its
courses are relatively small in comparison to the total number of declared

10 During the first few years these prov1s1ons caused some friction, as

Baha''ls in Halwa, the information they disperse in various village
communities ensures that a larger number of declarants will come into
contact with the 'deepening' efforts of the Baha'f Administrative Order
in India.   Hence, it is as a channel of communication that the Indore
Teaching Institute provides its greatest service to consolidation
work in Malwa.

Perhaps the most effective channel of communication linking Malwa
Baha'i village communities and the movement's greater administrative system
is the travelling teacher.    It is the most effective for several reasons.
In the first place, while written communication is plentiful and distributed
on a regular basis, it faces two difficulties: illiteracy, and lack of
personal contact.   As previously mentioned, even in the better educated
communities the majority of believers cannot read.       In this vein it has
been estimated that on the whole, less than 25% of the declarants in Malwa
can read sufficient Hindi to be able to understand the contents of
Baha'i written materia1. 11   Consequently, any written material received by
village communities must be read to the group by those members who can
read, and therefore communication is indirect and often ineffective.
Furthermore, even when bulletins, newspapers, and other forms of written
commw1ication are read to village believers, the lack of personal contact
weakens their effect.   A letter received from New Delhi or Ujjain does not
carry the emotional impact that characterizes the spoken word, and thus
the human aspect of communication is lost.   Secondly, while teaching
institutes contain 'lithin their structure a means for establishing the
personal contact so vital to successful communication, they are unavailable
to the majority of rural follo'lers; the mainstream of   v~llage   declarants
cannot afford the time a'lay from their fields to attend instructional
sessions.   Also, the lack of financial resources in the Indian Baha'i
community reduces not only the size but number of institutes.       There

Committee.
are only two such centers for the entire I4alwa mass teaching area, a
region which includes within its boundaries over a hundred thousand declared
believers, and consequently the Administrative Order has had to use them
primarily for educating a few coruruunity leaders.           In an attempt to
overcome these difficulties, the institution of the Bah a '1 travelling
teacher has been created.     About such teachers the Universal House of
Justice in a letter dated October 26, 1967, said:

> It must be realized that people who are mostly
> illiterate cannot have the benefit of reading for
> themselves the written word and of deriving directly
> from it the spiritual sustenance they need for the
> enrichment of their Baha'i lives.    They become

> Assembly or the Teaching Committees responsible for

> that their choice must depend, not only on the
> knowledge or grasp of the teachings on the part of
> the teachers, but primarily upon their pure spirit
> and love for the Cause, and their capacity to convey
> that spirit and love to others. 12
The duties of travelling teachers fall into two main categories:
propagating the Faith, and assisting the consolidation efforts of the
Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee by acting as channels of communication
between the Committee's office in U,jjain and various village communities.
This chapter is primarily concerned with their role as channels of
communication;   their activities as propagators of the Baha'i Faith will
be more thoroughly developed in Chapter 11.

As collllllunicati ve links between the village communities and the Baha' :r
Administrative Order, travelling teachers' duties are basically three.
First, they carry general information from the Ujjain Regional Teaching
Committee to the various villages in their assigned localities, an assignment
which often involves conducting    1 deepening 1 prograrus   in the villages.
12 'Letter to. all .national spiritual assemblies engaged in mass teaching,

October, 26, 1967 1 , Arise to Serve, p. 118-119
Second, they meet periodically with specific local spiritual assemblies in
order to help them better understand the administrative dimensions of the
Faith.      1'hird, they keep the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee apprised
of the general condition of Baha 'f conrrnuni ties in the rural areas.

Each travelling teacher is assigned a number of key villages within
the immediate vicinity of his own town or village.         In each village
(some of which are the aforementioned 'model villages') he executes
his assignment and in turn directs specific believers to carry the given
information to surrounding communities, thus establishing a small scale
network of verbal communication.

There are thirteen such travelling teachers presently working in
Malwa, all of whom come from villages and to<Tns throughout the region.
All are literate in Hindi; one or two can converse in English; and several
are college graduates,        Every month the teachers assemble in Ujjain to
submit written reports outlining their previous month's work and to
receive their briefing instructions from the Secretary of the Ujjain
Regional Teaching Corrooittee.      After being exruuined on their instructions
they return to their various districts.

An example of' the travelling teacher can be seen in the person of
Bak~i    Ram Varma, a twenty-six year old Balla ':l who lives in a rural conununity
located in Ujjain district, not far from the small railway junction of
Nagda.      He comes from a Rajput fruuily, and together with his two brothers
farms ten acres of land.        He attended Madhav College in Ujjain where he
received his B.A. in Arts in 1971.

Bak~t   Ram first came into contact with the Balla '1 Faith in 1971 when he
met a travelling teacher in his village.         After declaring his belief in
Baha 1 u 1 lliih he took part with fifteen other new believers in a three
week 'deepening' course designed to fruuiliarize declaran+s with all
aspects of the Balla 1 1 Faith    from ritual and devotion to administrative

1'(0

organization..   Upon f)asuing a val ttc:n CA4JJ1inuti_on the participants were
q,ualified to carry out teaching and consolidation activities in village areas.

Baksi Ram has in his charge a number of village communities (located near
Nagda junction) spread out over a radius of approximately fifteen miles.              Each
month he visists a certain nwnber of them, often spending the night in the
visited community.      Every month he receives the eg_ui valent of ten
Australian dollars to help support his field work.         The type of activity in
which Bak~I Ram engages is exemplified in the following paragraphs..
Baksi Ram's specific assignment for the month of January, 1974, was to

•
inform local spiritual assemblies in his area to promote two projects in their
respective communities:     to implement the use of the phrase 'AllSb'u'Abha';

and to encourage individual contribution to the Baha'i Fund.            His journey
began in Ujjain where in conjunction with the other travelling teachers he
received his briefing instructions from the Secretary of the Ujjain Regional
Teaching Committee.      He then travelled by train to Nagda from where he took
a bus to his village.      The next day he set out for his assigned destinations.

The importance of prayer as a preparatory act for commencing teaching
and consolidation work has been greatly stressed by the Universal House of
Justice, and the Uj j ain Regional Teaching Committee therefore instructs
every teacher to engage in on.e hour of prayer before starting his mission.
Accordingly, during his travels Baksi Ram spends much time chanting prayers
and singing Bah a '1 devotional songs.     As he stated, 'I am doing the work of

Bhagavan Bah a 1 u 'llah, therefore I prepare myself by singing his verses.

The next evening Baksi Ram met with the assembly members in the first
of his designated communi ties.      As is the rule, the meeting began with a
prayer read by the chairman of the assembly, a Ha}put farmer:
l3 The propagation and consolidation activities of the Baha'i Faith are

> sustained by funds contributed by individual believers. In each country
> of the Baha'i world there exists a national fund which supports the work
> of the movement within its boundaries. Only Baha'is are allowed to

accepted.

> harass me. I will not dwell on the unpleasant
> things of' life. 0 God, Thou art more friend to
> me than I am to myself. I dedicate myself to Thee,
> 0 Lord.l4

Having expressed the well-wishes of the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee,
Bak~I Ram proceeded to elaborate upon his assigned topics.               First, he
relayed the Committee's wish that the phrase 'Allii.h'u'Abha' be employed by
assembly members when greeting each other, and that its use among all
village declarants be encouraged.        The phrase means    1

God is most great' ,
and it used by Baha'is throughout the world as a greeting, just as in the
rural areas of Malva Hindus greet each other with the traditional 'Jay
Jay Rama' (long live Rama). 1 5      Second, Bak~I Ram explained the significance
of the Baha' 1 Fund, emphasizing that the amount of money given by the
community was not important, but that universal participation was
desirable.     He also stressed that the donated money was used for paying
teachers, supporting schools, printing books and pamphlets, and generally
promoting the movement in India.

During the next week Bak~I Ram carried these instructions to the local
spiritual assemblies of several nearby villages.            In each instance he met
members of the assembly individually in their fields and again collectively
in the evening.         In some of these communities he also stressed to assembly
members the importance of maintaining written communication with the
Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee, as regular contact with the higher

l{2

administrative instituU.ons of the movement was essential to the development
of the Faith in Hah1a.

While a major part of BaksT Ram's duties are involved in relaying
information and directives from the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee to
local communities, this is not his only function;         he also carries
communications from the villages to the CollLrnittee.       In this respect he
notifes the Committee 1 s members of specific problems and concerns of
individual colUlliUJlities.    For example, in   one village, community leaders
notified Bak~i Ram that their Baha'i bhavan had been damaged during the
rainy season and was in need of certain repairs.          They requested the
Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee give them assistance in paying for
reconstruction costs.         Accordingly, in his monthly report Bak~I Ram
reiterated the request.

Baksi Ram's activities exemplifY the work being carried out by the
Ujj ain Regional Teaching Committee's travelling teachers.            Yet, because
'deepened 1 Baha'i villagers can afford little time away from their fields,
the number of such teachers in MaJ.wa is few, and therefore all of the
local spiritual assemblies in the region cannot be personrlly contacted.
As a result, travelling teachers must concentrate their efforts on those
villages which the Bah a ''l Administrative Order feels have the greatest
potential for developing strong communi ties.        Although the process is a
slow one, and the range of contact limited, the personal communication they
provide establishes the travelling teachers as the best source of
communication bet,een village communi ties and the Bah a '1 Administrative
Order,and consequently        . the future the1r

Tbe final channel of communication employed by the Baha''l
Administrative Order in MaJ.wa is the consolidation team.            This institution

areas, meeting "ith local Baha 1 i assemblies and community members and

helping with consolidation and 'deepening' programs.         It is different
to the travelling teacher, however, in that while the latter comes from
the villages and is paid for his work on a regular basis, the consolidation
team generally consists of individuals (often youth under the age of twenty-
five) from outside areas who come to Nalwa or other mass teaching areas for
specific periods to perform specific tasks.         Therefore, unlike the
travelling teacher the consolidation team does not provide a continuous and
on-going communicative link, but acts as a temporary channel designed to
implement particular programs or projects.         In addition. a consolidation
team generally travels by jeep;        since time is limited and the National
Spiritual Assembly and the Regional 'reaching Committee want a team to meet
with as many communities as possible during its stay in the region, travel
time must be shortened.

Three consolidation teams were in the field in Nalwa between February
12 and February 23, 1974.         Each team was composed of two Baha'i youth from
Poona and Bombay and one village teacher from the Halwa region.         Their
specific task on this occasion was to help administer the unit elections
whereby local communities select delegates for the National Convention. 17
They were to see that village believers understood the meaning and methods
of   Balla'~   elections and ensure that delegates were properly elected.      Also,
they were asked to select certain villagers whom they felt could act as
village teachers and invite them to attend the next training session at the
Indore Teaching Institute.

The teams assembled at the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee office
where they met with Hand of the Cause Dr. Huhajir and Cr .1tinental Counsellor

' '
Mrs. Sh 1r1n Boman L·'I eherab'an1.

'    Following a round of prayers they were
reminded of the importance of proper methodology in the Baha'i electoral
process and advised to make sure that no campaigning or electioneering
took place.        In addition, Dr. !1uhajir emphasized the importance of

finding suitable believers who couJd be trained as travelling teachers, as
the large number of cornrnunities in Malwa was making the use of conrtolidation
teams less practical each year, and therefore in the future, activities such
as election supervising would have to be carried out by Jocal inhabitants.
Furthermore, since the new Five-Year Plan called for grea" increases in
the number of communities in India, he felt it imperative that the ranks
of India's travelling teachers be increased.         After consultation the
three groups left for their assigned districts.

An examination of' one of the group's written reports evidences the
type of service the consolidation team renders.             In four villages in
Ratlam district they co-ordinated election procedures and saw that the
name of the elected delegate was safely conveyed in writing to the region's
Auxiliary Board member.      In addition, they visited six other villages for
the purpose of assessing the district's corps of travelling teachers and
school teachers.     In this regard they subsequently made recommendations
to the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee and National Spiritual Assembly
for the recall of one teacher for further training           and the addition of
another to the list of full-time travelling teachers.

18   Furthermore,
they left instructions with the district 1 s travelling teachers to send

As has been stated both in the introduction to this work and several
times throughout the preceding chapters, the Baha' 1 Administrative Order
in India is energetically involved in directing a process of communication
which is primarily educational in nature.         Over the last decade a large
number of rural villagers in Malwa have declared their belief in Baha'u'lliib

as an avatara.    From this starting point - the declaration of an
individual - the process begins.     The role of the Administrative Order
now becomes one of introducing declarants to Baha'1 values, institutions,
and modes of behavior, for the movement is not primarily concerned with the
~uestion   of personal salvation through belief in an avatara, but with the
construction of a system of values and corresponding institutions which
will change the behavior patterns of men and thereby provide the basis for
a future society whose scope will be universal and whose laws will be the
teachings of Baha'u'llah.
Part III   Aspects of Community Life

Chapter 7     Beliefs and Doctrines

The task ;rhich the Baha'i Administrative Order has set for itself
in Malwa is to educate new declarants in the various dimensions of Baha'i
community life.      As stated earlier, since the beginning of the mass
teaching campaign in India the sole requirement for becoming a Baha'i
has been acceptance of Baha'u'llah as a manifestation of God.
Consequently, when travelling teachers approach a new village they
emphasize the claims of Baha'u'llah as a manifestation of the Sacred
and not the intricacies of the Faith.          While the basic social principles
are also expounded, it is the station of Baha'u'llah that is always
stressed.      This point was made clear by the Indian National Spiritual
Assembly when it reminded the local communities that:

> An over-simplification of the Cause in the minds
> of the hearers cannot be avoided if our teachers
> present the Cause of God as a world movement,
> with noble principles, for removing prejudice and
> promoting World Peace. Such an approach may have
> its justification for stimulating inq_uiry and
> interest, but in the context of our villages, we
> should portray the Cause with simplicity of heart
> and directness of truth:l
Therefore, new believers are not expected upon declaring to immediately
manifest ;rithin their lives the teachings and principles, both individual
and social, of the Baha'i Faith.         Rather, becoming a Baha'i is viewed as
a process.      As Shoghi Effendi stated:

> The process of becoming a Baha'i is necessarily
> slo;r and gradual. The essential is not that the
> beginner should have a full and detailed kno;rledge
> of the Cause, a thing which is obviously impossible
> in the vast majority of cases, but that he should,
> by an act of his own will, be willing to uphold
> and follo;r the truth and guidance set forth in the
> Teachings, and thus open his heart and mind to the
> reality of the Manifestation. 2

!t is the responsibility of Baha'i administrative institutions in India,
namely, the National Spiritual Aslwmbly and the State ar l Regional teaching
committees to see that the new declarants are guided in the process of
becoming Bah8.'ls, and hence in accordance vith the directives of Shoghi
Effendi and tne Univc::rBal House of Justice these institutions are attempting
to direct a 'deepening 1 crunpaign in    l'·1alwa~   rrhe lack of funds and ma.npower'
however, has meant that t,he efforts of this campaign have had to be directed
towards a number of 'model village' communities.           Tbe aim of the program
has been to introduce into the 'model village' communities tbe essential
aspects of Baba' 1 community life, witt! the hope that these communities
will develop into catalysts for furtber institutional implementation in tbe
rural areas • ..)   Tbe essential elements of community life can be divided
into five categories:       beliefs and doctrines, ritual and ceremony, social
principles, administration, ancl education and propagation.

Part III will examine each of the above categories in detail.           In
each case the teaching or institution in question will first be examined
in its theoretical form, that is, as it is presented in Baba'1 literature,
and then as it is being implemented and adapted to the Indian cultural
environment,        Finally, a few examples of Baha' 1 activity in the 'model
village' communities will be cited.         It should be pointed out, however,
that greater emphasis will be placed on the theoretical and adaptive aspects
of Baba':l teacbings, as even in the 'model villages' change has not been
revolutionary, and thus the center of Baba'1 activity in Malwa is still

the educational process rather than independent conununity development.

Less than fifteen years have elapsed since the beginning of mass teaching
in India, while the traditional values and institutions of the Indian
village have roots that reach back thousands of years,         Consequently,
systematic change is of necessity a slm,r ax1d arduous process) and the
Bah8:'1 movement has just begw1 to enter the arena.

The belief dimension is perhaps the most important aspect of religious
life;     it forms the psychological source of an adherent's view of himself
and the cosmos.      In addition, the modes of action and patterns of behavior
in any given society are directly related to the system of beliefs to
which its members adhere.         Putting aside the argument of whether beliefs
and values are manifestations of socio-economic forces or the source of
the former, the author will be sat isf'ied in acknowledging the direct
relationship existing between values and beliefs and social action.            On
this point he agrees with Peter Berger that the interaction is a
dialectical one.      As Berger states:

> The dialectical relationship between religion and
> society thus precludes the doctrinaire approaches
> of either "idealism" or "materialism". It ib
> possible to show concrete instances how religious
> "ideas", even very abtruse ones, led to empirically
> available changes in the social structure. In
other instances, it is possible to show how

> empirically available structural changes had effects
> on the level of religious consciousness and ideation.
> Only a dialectical understanding of these relationships
> avoids distortions of the one-~idedly "idealist" and
> nmateri alist"   interpretations~

Thus an exrunination of the belief' dimension or 'world view' of the Baha '1
Faith is essential to an understanding of the values and institutions it9,
leaders are attempting to introduce into village life.

\[4\] Peter Berger, 'I'he Social Reality of Heligion, (London, 1969), p. 4-5

The beliefs and doctrines of the Baha 1 i :Faith are religious in nature,

as they are claimed to be derived from the Sacred.       The form which the
Sacred takes in Baha'i literature is that of a transcendent and omnipotent
God.      He is indivisible and unchanging, and His essence is eternal:

> Exalted, immeasurably exalted, art Thou above
> the strivings of mortal man to unravel Thy
> mystery, to describe Thy glory, or even to
> hint at the nature of Thine Essence.6
Moreover, He is above all names and free from all human likeness.         According
to The Kitab-i-Igan, 'To every discerning and illumined heart it is evident
that God, the unknowable Essence, the divine Being, is immensely exalted
beyond every human attribute, such as corporeal existence, ascent and

descent, egress and regress.     Consequently, all things are known by

God, but He is concealed from all men.

Through His will God created the universe which has had no beginning
in time and shall have no end:

> Know assuredly that God's creation hath existed
> from eternity, and will continue to exist forever.
> Its beginning hath had no beginning, and its end
> knoweth no end.9

Commenting on this apparent contradiction, E. G. Browne explained:         'This
Emanation of Creation was produced by the Primal Will (Mashiyyat-i-U'la),

God, and it is by His grace that they have entered the realm of existence.

While the God of the Baha '1 Faith is beyond all hum<l.ll understanding
or reproach, He is a personal God, not a neutral ground of being.         In
this sense the Baha'f conception of God closely follows the pattern of
conceptual development to be found in the historical religions of the Near
East, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, in which the Sacred in its most
exalted ideation retains certain anthropomorphic attributes and is capable
of communing with His creation in an I-Thou relationship.         This 'love'
relationship is revealed in the following passage taken from The Hidden vlords:

> 0 SON OF MAN!
> Veiled in My immemorial being and in the ancient
> eternity of By essence, I knew My love for thee;
> therefore I created thee, have engraved on thee
> Mine image and revealed to thee Hy beauty.ll
Furthermore, like Mul_lammad, Balla' u' llah' s showering of the Sacred with such
descriptive attributes as the All-lilerciful, the Most-Compassionate, the
Giver, the Gracious, the Loving, testifies to the fact that God is conceived
as being a personal deity.

Since it is impossible for created things to comprE;end the Divine
Essence, from time to time God sends forth messengers or        manifestations
who serve as a liason between Him and His creation.         In this process God
is an active agent;     through the power of His will He reveals Himself to
the manifestation.      IV!oreover, it is only through the manifestation that
man can know of His will:  'He Wh.o is everlastingly hidden from the eyes

of men can never be known except through His Manifestation, ••• '    In the

Tablets of Abdul-Balla Abbas this theme is explained in th- following
manner:

> By this Vlord it is intended that no one hath
> any access to tbe Invisible Essence. In this
> world all men must turn their faces toward
> "Him-whom God-shall m£-tni fE:-~f3t" ~ He is the
> "Dawning-place of Divinity" and the "Manifestation
> of Deity" .13

Hence, a manifestation acts as a communicative link between the Sacred and
the profane, an idea which shares ml-tch in common with the Islamic concept

of the prophet.

1che relationship between God and a manifestation in Balla' f doctrine
is one of revelation and not incarnation.          The Divinity reveals Himself'

unto His manifestation, but he does not tal'e human form.             Consequently,
a manifestation acts like a mirror;        he reflects the sun, but he is not
the embodiment of the sun itself.         According to Balla'u'lliih:

> rrhese Tabernacles of Holiness, these Primal
> Hirrors which reflect the light of unfading
> glory, are but expressions of' l!im Hho is the
> Invisible of the Invisibles. 1 6
A manifestation is a composite of three realities:         -.;he physical, the
human, and the divine.       In the first two forms he shares similarities

with his fellow men;      he has a physical body and a rational soul.           However,

he also has a divine side - he is the spokesman for God,            Accordingly,
only through him does the divine word flow.

According to the Baha'i view a manifestation is necessary because the
human intellect by itself is incapable of solving the basic problems of
life.           Only by obtaining the knowledge of God's creative purpose can man
come to an understanding of himself and thereby fulfill his ordained
station in life.           Consequently, human un.i ty depends on men following the
teachings of the manifestation~ 8 and failure to do so results in the decay
of society.           Hence Baha'i literature often depicts the manifestation as
a physician whose patient is sick humanity.            For example, the Tablets of
Abdul-Baha Abbas record that:

> Each l•lanifestation is the heart of the world and
> the proficient Physician of every patient. The
> world of humanity is sick, but that skilled
> Physician hath the healing remedy and He bestoweth
> divine teachings, eY~ortations and advices which
> are the remerly of every ailment and the dressing
for every wound.l9

Consequently, only through obedience to his commands can mankind progress.

During the course of human history God has revealed Himself through
a series of manifestations.           Just as the sun that rises and sets each
day is in reality the same sun, so the numerous messengers through whom

God has manifested Himself are one and the smne.    Although in their

ignorance men speak of Abraham, the Buddha, Moses, Zoroaster, Christ,
J4"~Jta,    and MulJ:ammad as separate and distinct realities, in truth the
voice which spoke in each of them was the one and indivisible God:

> His holy and chosen Messengers, are, without
> exception, the bearers of His names, and the
> embodiments of His attributes. They only differ

Therefore, the Baha' 1 Faith adheres to a concept of progressive revelation
whereby from the dawn of human history to the present day manifestations
have revealed to mankind the commandments and laws of God which have
subse~uently     become the catalysts for the advancement of civilization.
While the teachings of the manifestations vary according to the needs of
the time (thus making religious truth relative), they always come from
the same Source.

According to Baha' 1 scriptur'> manifestations have often spoke of
future revelations.        Ho>1ever, once a prophet appears and makes his claim,
he is rejected.        'rhus the Jews were told to expect a Messiah, but they
rejected Jesus because he did not fulfill their expectations.          Similarly,
Christians were told to e>qoect the return of their Lord, yet when he
appeared in the personage of the Arabian prophet, Muf,!ammad, they disdained
him.       Like>1ise, Huslims were expecting the arrival of' t',e mahd:l

yet when the Bab made his claim they imprisoned and finally killed him.
'l'he Bab in turn had spoken of the coming of a universal manifestation,
mentioned by all tile manifestations of the past, whom he referred to as
'Him whom God shall manifest 1 •      Baha'is believe this universal
manifestation was Baha'u'llah.

by virtue of his rationality.     Like the animal, man has a physical body
and senses which allow him to experience hunger, thirst, heat, and cold,
but his superior intelligence permits him to understand     ~n   varying degrees

himself, the world, and the spiritual realities of existence.            Man's
power of rationality is a result of his possessing a soul - a non-material

reality connected to the body through the functions of the mind.              The
soul comes into existence when the body is created, but it is independent
of the latter and survives after its demise.        Moreover, it is not       ~ffected

by the infirmities of the body or mind.

!1an' s soul allows him to imderstand the realities of existence, and
it is the knowledge and love of the source of that existence (ie. God) that
is the sole aim of his being created. 2 9 Accordingly, in the teachings
of the Baha'i Faith the purpose of man's life on earth is to know and

love God.
Each man, therefore, is created with the ability to love God, but

this ability is dependent on free will.    Accordingly, man requires a
teacher whose guidance will bring his potentialities to fruition.             As man
requires a perfect guide, the master must be at the same time ' ••• not only

a material, but also a human and spiritual educator;      and he must possess
a supernatural power, so that he may hold the position of a divine
teacher. ,32 , and it is for this reason that God reveals Himself to a
manifestation.       Knowledge of God's attributes alone, however, is not
deemed sufficient, for love of God implies that man manifest his knowledge
in the realm of action:

> If we are true Baha'is speech is not needed.
> Our actions will help on the world, will spread
> civilization, will help the progress of science,
> and cause the arts to develop. Without action
> nothing i.n the material world can be accomplished,
> neither can words unaided advance a man in the
> spiritual Kingdom.33
The emphasis placed on action in the Baha'i teachings demonstrates
that the world is not to be negated or renounced.       Rather, the Baha'i
Faith teaches that far from seeking to abandon the world and withdraw into
a spiritual domain where material concerns are suppressed, man should
develop his spirituality by actively participating in the building of an
ever-advancing civilization.       In this sense the Baha'i 'world view'

contains an element of what Max Weber termed 'inner-worldly asceticism',
whereby the world is seen to be a workshop for doing God's work.       However,
unlike the Christian variety of this phenomenon, namely, the Calvinistic
form of Puritanism, the aim of work in the world is not the winning of
individual salvation but the uplift of humanity.      As Baha'u'llall states:

> I confess that Thou hast no desire except the
> regeneration of the whole world, and the
> establishment of the unity of its peoples, and
> the sal vat ion of all of them that dwell therein. 35

Therefore, man's growth depends on the way he conducts his life in the
world, and for this reason the teachings of the Baha'i Faith place greater
emphasis on ethical activity than ritual observance.     The primary goal
of man's life is not to purify himself from the dross of the world by means
of periodic withdrawl into a realm of symbolic activity but to enter the
profane sphere with the intention of regenerating it through consciously
directed moral activity based on the teachings of the manifestation of God.

While in Baha'i doctrine the world is not seen as a place to be
shunned or renounced, neither is it viewed as an end in itself.     It is
an arena for manifesting God's glory and developing man's soul;    otherwise
it is meaningless.    Thus in one passage the worth of t.'le world is compared
to the black in the eye of a dead ant. 36   Man's true reality is his spirit
(soul), for which the world is but a training ground.     After death the
soul continues to exist~7 traversing the innumerable worlds of God and

slowly gaining in perfection in a process that has no end.

At first glance the beliefs and doctrines of the Baha'i Faith appear
to be far removed from those of popular Hinduism:    the Faith's strong
emphasis on monotheism seems to clash dramatically with Hinduism's well-
populated pantheon;   the ethical prophet of revelation appears to find no
place in the Hindu tradition;   and the Baha'i view of man and his role in

the world seems to contradict the doctrines of samsara, karma, and
moksa .•39 and their implications of fatalism and life negation.       However,
closer examination reveals that within the Hindu tradition there are
certain     elements that, if not parallel to Baha' f beliefs, are at least
similar to them.       By reason of its age and liberal attitude towards
metaphysical speculation, Hindu thought has over the centuries traversed
the span of theological concepts      from atheism to monism.     As a result,
doctrines regarding monotheism, revelation, and 'inner-worldly asceticism'
are by no means foreign to Hinduism, even at the popular level.         For
example, two of the largest sectarian groups within the Hindu fold,
Vai?ttavites and Saivites, have from the beginning of the Christian era,
if not earlier, looked on Vi?ttU or Siva as the only God.         In addition,
many of the bhakti 41 cults which have periodically flourished in India
have held to a concept of monotheism.       Even today villagers believe in
one Supreme Force who has numerous forms, an expression of qualified
monotheism. 42    Similarly, the concept of revelation is not unknown to
Hinduism.      It is commonly believed, even by villagers, that the Vedas were
revealed to the ancient rsis by the gods.       As regards fatalism, which has
often been claimed to lie at the base of the Indian character, a well-known
scholar of Indian civilization states:

\[39\] These three concepts form the core of most Hindu religious and

> philosophical systems of thought. Sarnsara poses a world of continual
> birth and rebirth (transmigration); klirma determines one's position
> in the world (see Chapter 4); and moksa is the state of
final release. For an elaboration on these doctrines see A. L.

Indeed, the Bhagavad Gita, one of the best known Hindu religious texts,
constantly stresses the importance of action in life:

> Do thou thy alloted work, for action is better
> than inaction; even the maintenance of thy       44

physical life cannot be effected without action.
Within the Hindu tradition, however, there is one particular doctrine
that displays many parallels to the Baha'1 concept of manifestation, and
as a result Baha'1 teachers in India have made a conscious effort to
identify their own doctrine with it.     This is the concept of the avatara.
As it is this doctrine that has provided the Baha'2 the Baha'2 Faith with its
breakthrough in terms of comparative theological conceptualization, it
should be examined more thoroughly.

Avatara means descent, or a coming down, and it is used in Hindu
terminology to refer to the phenomenon of a deity incarnating itself.
The concept is most clearly developed in the doctrines of the Vaisnavite
sect, one of the largest sub-groups within the Hindu fold, but it is by no
means limited to this sect.     It is commonly believed that the god   Var~a

Siva have made references to their god's appearance in the form of an avatara.

\[46\] Basham, p. 311

In fact, practically all Hindus are familiar with the concept, as it is
expounded in the two great epics, the MahSbharata and the Ramayana, as
well as in many of the Puranas (religio-mythical legends), which together
form the source of many popular religious beliefs.      S. N. Dasgupta goes
so far as to say that while the doctrine of the incarnation of God is not
elaborated upon by any of the speculative systems of thought in India, it

still forms the corner-stone of most systems of philosophy and religion.
In the same vein, Aurobindo Ghose claims:

> India has from ancient times held strongly a
> belief in the reality of the Avatar, the
> descent into form, the revelation of the God-
> head in humanity. In the West this belief has
> never really stamped itself upon the mind

> roots in the reason and general consciousness
> and attitude towards life •• But in India it has
> grown up and persisted as a logical outcome of
> the Vedantic view of life and taken firm root
> in the consciousness of the race.48
The most ancient elaboration of the avatara doctrine can be found
in the Bhagavad Gita, one of the books of the Mahabharata, often referred to as
the New Testament of Hinduism. It is here that     Vi~~u,   the Supreme Being
of   Vai~~avite   theology, manifests himself in the form of Krsna for the
purpose of revealing to Arjuna, one of the five brothers of an Indian
princely line, the true nature of reality.       During their discourse many
of the central ideas relating to the concept of the avatara are presented,
and it is around these ideas that the principal doctrines of Vaisnavite
theology revolve.

One of the more important beliefs relating to the doctrine of the
avatara is the assertion that the Divine actually appears in animal or

1932)' p. 525

human form.49  In the Bhagavad Gita K;~~a is Arjuna's comrade, and

functions
although he is a divine figure, he has the same bodily        as do the
purely human characters in the Mahabharata;         he eats, drinks, and sleeps
with his companions.        In addition, and perhaps more importantly, he also
dies.     According to the epic,    K~~~a   is fatally wounded by the arrow of
a hunter. 50     Likewise, the avatara of the Ramayana, Rama, is a man
possessing the full range of human needs and emotions, and like Krsna
he dies, his death being synibolized by a flowing river.51           However, while
the Supreme Being manifests Himself in material form, He is not limited
by this imminence.        In essence God is formless, and it is only through

His will that    Vi~~u   enters the profane sphere.        Moreover, in both epics
the avataras perform supernatural feats        and are always victorious, another
sign of their divinity.       For example, even in his childhood Krsna
performed the miracle of lifting Mount Govardhana over the heads of the
cowherds, thus sheltering them from a       storm~ 3 and   later it was through his
aid that the P-a~~avas (A:r Juna

Similarly, during the course of the Ramayana Rama slays many demons, and
when he k1lls R-

avatara represents a mingling of human and divine elements, an assertion
that God is simultaneously transcendent and imminent.

A central teaching of    Vai~~avite   theology adhered to by most Hindus
is the belief that   Vi~~u   continually incarnates Himself - He has not
limited His appearance on earth to one time and place.        According to the
most popular classifications there have been nine chief incarnations of
Visnu.   The first five avataras were mythical representations, while the
last four were semi-historical if not historical figures.        The first was
l'~tsya, the fish, who warned Manu 57 of an impending flood and subse~uently
carried him and his family to safety in a ship, thereby saving the Vedas
from destruction.    The fish incarnation was followed by KUrma (the
tortoise), Varaha (the boar), Narasimha (the man-lion), and Vamana (the
dwarf), all of whom carried out specific deeds for the benefit of mankind.
The sixth avatara was Para~urama, the son of a Bra~, who is best
remembered for his slaying of all    K~atriya   males after his father had been
killed by a wicked king who was a member of this class.        However, it is
not until the seventh avatara of    Vi~?u,   the aforementioned Rama, that the
doctrine of the incarnation takes on any real import for contemporary
Hinduism, for as the hero of the Ramayana he is known across the length
and breadth of India.    Vi~~u   incarnated Himself in the form of Rama,
Prince of Ayodhya, in order to stem the activites of the demon Ravana.
The Ramayana recounts the events of this divine deed and in the process

hardship and travail Rama slays the demon and rescues sita, and thus like
previous avataras Rama saves the world from impending danger.

The most important of the incarnations of          Vi~:'u   was the eighth avatara,
Krsna .     He has already been mentioned in the preceding pages as being the
central figure of the Bhagavad Gita, but since it is primarily with this
figure that the Baha'1 movement has sought to establish identity, an
outline of the legend surrounding         K~~:'a   will be made here.
According to tradition, Krsna was born at Hathura, his parents being
members of the Yadava tribe.        He was the second cousin of the tyrannical
king Kamsa who in an attempt to dispel a prophecy which said that he would
be killed by his cousin's eighth son set out to kill all of her children.
Kf~~a     and his brother escaped, however, and grew up in tde care of a
cowherd called Nanda.        Upon reaching manhood Krsna slew Kamsa and
subsequently founded a new kingdom.           During his reign he killed many
demons and wicked kings and, as mentioned earlier, aided the Pa~~avas in
their struggle with the Kauravas.           It was on the eve of the great battle
between the two princely clans that         Kr~~a,    while acting as Arjuna's
charioteer, revealed to him that he was an avatara of the Supreme Lord
and compelled the doubting prince to uphold his rightful dharma (duty)
by joining battle with the usurpers.               It is this episode that forms the
story-line of the Bhagavad Gita and provides the setting for Kr~~a to
inform the dismayed Arjuna of the eternal verities.                 After the Pandava's
victory     Kr~~a   returned to his kingdom only to see it marred by internal
dissension.         After years of attempting to quel the feuding          ~~~a,   while
wandering in the forest, was mistaken for a deer and shot in the heel.
Like Achilles, this was his one vulnerable spot, and the wound resulted in
his death.

The Krsna story as it is known today is no doubt strongly flavored
by myth, although it seems certain that there is some historical basis to

the legend of the hero-god. 58 The actual historicity of ~~~a, however,
is not of paramount importance.         Rather, it is the teachings and
doctrines presented in the Bhagavad Gita, those elements which contribute
to the Hindu's view of himself and the cosmos, that are of real         conse~uence.

Whether   K{~~a   really existed is not critical;      the fact that millions of
people believe he did is the important factor. and therefore the true
significance of     Kt7~a   is to be found in his symbolizatio1. of the interest
of the Divine in the affairs of men.

The ninth and most recent of the incarnations of Visnu was the
Buddha,who lived in the sixth century B.C.           He is most remembered for his
compassion, particularly to animals, as he is supposed to have put an end
to the practice of animal sacrifice.           However, having denied the
authority of the Vedas he was not elevated to a high rank in         Vai~~avite

theology, and many scholars argue that he was only included in the list of
avataras for the purpose of assimilating heterodox elements into

The essential reason for the appearance of avataras in the material
world is the maintenance of justice and the destruction of evil.            This
theme is stated in the Bhagavad Gita in the following way:

> Whenever there is a decline of righteousness and
> a rise of unrighteousness, 0 Bharata (Arjuna),
> then I send forth (create incarnate) Myself. For
> the protection of the good, for the destruction
> of the wicked and for the establishment of
> righteousness, I come into being from age to ave. 60

Conse~uently,     avataras come with a specific purpose;      they do not appear
in the physical world without reason.          For example, Kilrma dived to the
bottom of the cosmic ocean to save many of the divine treasures lost in
58 Ghose, p. 12
59 For example, this is the opinion of A. L. Basham.         See The Wonder that

was India, p. 309.

\[60\] Bhagavad Gita, IV, 7-8

the great flood;    Varata saved the earth from destruction by raising it
with his tusks from the bottom of the cosmic ocean where it had been
hurled by the demon         Hiranyaka~a;   and Narasimha slew the demon
HiraQyakasipu, who was persecuting both gods and men.            Moreover, as has
already been mentioned, the human avatai·as killed numerous demons in order
that the world could once again be brought back to a state of equilibrium.
Thus, avatii:ras 1 great purpose is ' ••• to establish dharma, to restore right

and put down wrong.     1

Finally, the avataras (especially the human incarnations) reveal a
personal God who cares for man.            He is a God of love who personally sets
an example for human beings to follow.           According to Radhakrishnan:

> The emphasis of the Gita is on the Supreme as
> the personal God who creates the perce~tible
> world by His nature (pralq"ti). He res1des in
> the heart of every being; He is the enjoyer
> and lord of all sacrifices. He stirs our hearts
> to devotion and grants our prayers. He is the
source and sustainer of values. He enters into

personal relations with us in worship and prayer.

Moreover, the birth, suffering, and death of human avataras disclose a
God who is aware of the human condition.           Thus, while avataras are divine
teachers, their discourses go beyond the realm of systematic philosophy
and reach out to the existential realities of life.           According to   s.   N.
Dasgupta:

> In the Gita abstract philosophy melts down to an
> insight into the nature of practical life and
> conduct, ••• For the God in the Gita is not a God
> of abstract philosophy or theology, but a God
> who could be a man and be capable of all personal
> relations. 63

Hence, Rama has become the epitome of righteous conduct;           beyond his heroic

62 Radhakrishnan, p. 25

\[63\] Dasgupta, p. 525

and miraculous deeds he is regarded as the ideal ruler arj husband.
Similarl~, Kf~?a   is not only remembered for his supernatural acts but for
his erotic exploits with the gopis (cowherds' wives), a symbol of the love
relationship between God and man.

In reaching the rural masses of Malwa the Baha'i Faith has used the
concept of the avatara as a cultural bridge;    it has become the primary
conceptual vehicle by which the movement's teachers present its doctrines.
In this regard India is not an exception, as the practice of presenting
its doctrines in terms and symbols that are culturally meaningful to the
inhabitants of the particular country in which propagation activities
are being implemented has been a marked characteristic of the movement's
missionary work throughout the world.     In Christian countries Baha'u'llan
is referred to as the return of Christ;    in the Islamic world he is
'The Great Announcement';   and in Buddhist countries he is known as the
fifth Buddha.    This approach was indorsed by Shoghi Effendi when he wrot·e:

> Nor should any of the pioneers, at this early
> stage in the upbuilding of Baha'i National
> Communities, overlook the fundamental
> prerequisites for any successful teaching
> enterprise, which is to adapt the presentation
> of the fundamental principles of their Faith
> to the cultural and religious backgrounds, the
> ideologies, and the temperament of the divers
> races and nations whom the~ are called upon
> to enlighten and attract.6
The main link in the identification of the concept of the manifestation
with that of the avatara has been the personage of the kalkin avatara.
In Vaij~avite doctrine there is a belief in a future avatara (kalkin) who
will appear at the close of the kali-yuga, the last of the four great ages

\[64\] Shoghi Effendi, Citadel of Faith. Messages to America, 1947- 1953,

in each cosmic aeon.               14ention of this figure has been made in several of

-    66                      - -
the Puranas    as well as in the l1ahabharata.              As the tenth avatara of
Vi~~u,      kalkin will appear for the purpose of destroying the wicked and
re-establishing righteousness in the world.                Having purified all things,
he will usher in a new age.              While John Hinnells and W. Weaver claim
that the kalkin avatara has never assumed an important place in              Hinduism~ 7
A. L. Basham points out that many simple Hindus take kalkin very
seriously,

and Sir   l~onier-Williams   noted that 'Some of the degraded
classes of India comfort themselves in their present abject condition by
looking to Kalki as their future deliverer and the restorer of their social

pos~t~on.

In Hindu cultural terms Baha' f teachers claim that Baha' u' llah was
the fulfillment of the kalkin prophecy.                His advent in nineteenth century
Persia, the symbol of the decadence that characterized the kali-yuga,
marked the beginning of a new age in the history of mankind in which
righteousness will flourish and dharma will be restored.               Through
Baha'u'lliih, the same Lord that was manifest in Krsna has once again
communed with man and re-established the eternal truths of religion.*

In using this approach the          Baha'~   movement is following much the
same procedure adopted by Ismii' J:l'L missionaries in India who during the

ninth' century presented'Ali as the promised kalkin avatara. 70      It should
be made clear, however, that while the Baha'i Faith speaks of Baha'u'llah
in terms of the avatara tradition, it does not do so at the cost of its
original doctrines.      While the doctrines of the Faith are explained in
terms and concepts that have meaning to a Hindu villager, a compromise is
not made with ideas and beliefs that are contrary or at odds with its
fundamental principles.      In this regard Shoghi Effendi and the Universal
House of Justice continually warned Baha'f teachers that the doctrines of
the Faith should not be altered for the benefit of others. 71      Therefore,
the Baha'f Faith is not eclectic in its teaching approach:       the movement's
strength lies in its ability to present the essential doctrines of its
founders in the language of various cultural traditions without changing
their original meaning

Theoretically there are several differences between the Baha'f concept
of manifestation and the doctrine of the avatara.        First, as noted earlier,
in Baha'i belief God does not descend into the physical world, as this
would limit His omnipotence.      Instead, His word is revealed through a human
messenger5   In contrast to the concept of revelation, the avatara doctrine
seems to suggest the actual incarnation of the Sacred in human form.
Hence Geoffrey Parrinder in his work Avatar and Incarnation concludes that
' ... Krishna is not a "hwnan messenger", and his successive appearances are

not human geniuses but divine theophanies. '        Second, t:,e avatara doctrine

70 T. W. Arnold, The Preaching of Islam, (Lahore, 1961), p. 215
7l 'The believers, and particularly those who have not had sufficient

72 Parrinder, p. 231

is an Indian doctrine; that is, its list of divine personages does not
go beyond the pale of the Hindu cultural heritage (with the exception of the
Buddha), whereas the Baha'1 concept of manifestation, although strongly
oriented towards Near Eastern messengers, recognizes revelations from
other cultural traditions.         However, on the existential level, on a plane
of meaning that is significant to the hopes and expectations of the
majority of men who are not involved in intellectualizing           concepts into
abstractions, these differences diminish in importance.            To the Indian
villager the distinction between incarnation and manifestation would be
a technical point that might be of some import to philosophy but not a
concern of religion.         The fact that the Sacred has communed with the
profane      displayed concern for man, and preached a message of love and hope,
is the real issue, and not the technicalities of how this communion occurs.
Moreover, the distinction between the two concepts is not always as clear

"

as it may at first appear.         There is much room in the avatara doctrine for
interpreting the .avataras as outstanding human beings or manifestations
of the God-head rather than divine theophanies.           The modern saint,
RWmakrishna, called them human beings with extraordinary powers and
entruste d   Wl"th   a D"1v1ne
.   COmmlSSlon.

. .      73   From the other side, some of the
passages from Baha'1 scripture seem to indicate that the Sacred is present
in the personage of a manifestation.            For example, one verse reads: 'Were
any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare:           "I am God'i He,

verily, speaketh the truth, and no doubt attecheth thereto.'             Conseq_uently,
the Baha'1 approach in India is not a dogmatic one.            While Baha'1 teachers
assert that God is unlimited and beyond all physical form, they do not
demand new believers to distinguish between philosophical concepts.            Instead,
they emphasize that Baha'u'llah is the latest representative of God;            that

73 Quoted in Parrinder, p. 230
74 Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 54

he has appeared as a fulfillment of Hindu prophetic expectations;         and
that he has come for the specific plrrpose of regenerating a moribund world.
Consequently, what is required of the new declarant is that he accept the
authoritative station of Baha'u'llah as the representative of the Sacred
in the world.

Moreover, the fact that the Baha '1 Faith makes mention of avataras
outside the Hindu cultural tradition is not a real deterrent to the
movement's promotion in India! 5     The freedom of theological conceptualization
which has characterized religious thought in India allows for easier
acceptance of extraneous beliefs than does the dogmatism that has dominated
metapysi·al speculation in other cultures.        For example, Ramakrishna
found no difficulty in including Jesus as an avatara, and Gandhi could
speak of   Kr~~a,   Christ and Muhammad in the same context.

While the Baha 1 1 Faith's scriptures give more emphasis to the
manifestations of Near Eastern origin, when speaking to Halwa villagers
teachers place greater emphasis on the Indian messengers, especially the
Buddha and   Kr~~a.     Both of these figures are officially recognized
manifestations of God, and as such their names appear on any list of
manifestations published by the Baha'J: Faith.       In addition, teachers often
use the example of Rama who, although not recognized as a manifestation,
finds a place as a minor prophet.

The other avataras of   Vai~~avite
theology, however, receive no mention.

75 The one exception to this rule is the personage of H~ammad. Because

76 Baha':l teachings also contain references to minor prophets. 1 Abdu'l-

~'Ul

While the Bat•a'f Faith's publications ol' the writings of Baha'u'llah
contain no references to either the Buddha or         K:;~~a,   'Abdu '1-Baha made
mention of them, and Shoghi Effendi confirmed their positions as
manifestations of God.           In Some Answered Questions t Abdu '1-Baha is recorded
as referring to the Buddha in the following way:

> Buddha also established a new religion .•. The
> founder of Buddhism was a wonderful soul.
> He established the Oneness of God, but later
> the original principles of his doctrines
> gradually disappeared, and ignorant customs
> and ceremonies arose and increased until they
> finally ended in the worship of statues and
> images.77
Shoghi Effendi maintained that the Buddha was a manifestation, but added

that his followers did not possess his authentic writings.                Concerning
Krsna    1 Abdu 1 1-Baha   is reported to have said that 'The Message of Krishna
is the message of love.         All God's prophets have brought the message of
love.•T 9 and Shoghi Effendi referred to Baha'u'llrul as 'the Immaculate

As a result of these interpretations, Baha'i teachers in Malwa make
continual reference to both Indian avatar as.          For example, during her trip
to India Hand of the Cause RUJ;l:Lyyih Khanu.rn always stressed to her audiences
the oneness of the manifestations.          As she stated in Barhana:

> 'rhe Balla '1 Faith is a new vlor1d Eeligion;

Similarly, the most popular introductory bool< on the Baha'! Faith in Malwa,
The New Garden, a source specifically designed as a teaching guide for the
Indore 'reaching Institute, says of   K:z~':la:

> l<i'isJma, the f,fanifestation of God, brought a

Concerning the Buddha the book states:

> His Hanifestation. He was the Hanifestation of
> God, therefore, He did not want people to fight
> against each other in the name of God vlhom they
> could not know except through Him.83
It would be incorrect, however, to think that previous avatar as
receive parammmt importance in the educational programs of the Baha '1
Faith in Halwa.   Vlhile an attempt is made to correlate the station of 'Him
who God shall manifest' with the positions of Indian manifestations, the
greatest emphasis is placed on the role of the yugavatara, the kalkin
of Hindu prophecy, Baha'u'llah.

As in other parts of the world, teachers in India emphasize that the
purpose of God's manifestation in this era is no less than the lmification
of the entire planet.    vlhile previous manifestations have triumphed over
evil and restored righteousness and dharma, they have all been limited to
specific spheres of inf]_uence.     Hence Rama and Krsna were not universal
manifestations.   Baha'u'llah, on the other hand, is depicted as a
manifestation for all humanity, in whose J.Uga righteousness will be
established throughout the 1wrld.      However, as in the past, the victory
of the manifestation over the forces of darkness    re~uires   a struggle.
Thus, Baha'u'llah suffered for humanity, subjecting himself to imprisonment

82 Hooshmand Fathea'zarn, The New Garden, (New Delhi, 1971), p. 18-19
83 Fathea'zam, p. 20

and banishment:

> The Ancient Beauty hath consented to be bound

> that the whole world may attain unto true
> liberty. He hath drained to its dregs the
> cup of sorrow, that all the peoples of the
> earth may attain unto abiding joy, and be
> filled with gladness.84

Yet, truth is always victorious.    Just as Rama succeeded in slaying      Rav~a,
Baha'1 teachers claim that Baha'u'llah's mission will be accomplished, and
it is for the purpose of bringing about this victory that they are spreading
his message to the masses of India.

In village teaching the doctrine of the manifestation is given the
most emphasis, as it is the feeling of the movement's administrators in
India that this concept embodies the essence of the Faith's teachings, and
therefore    if the authority of the manifestation can be incorporated into
new declarants' 'world views' , other doctrinal elements    ''~11   eventually
follow.     Conse<J.uently, while the essential doctrines outlined in the
first part of this chapter are currently being taught, they are generally
presented as adjuncts to the doctrine of the manifestation and not stressed
independently of that doctrine.     In the following paragraphs a few
examples of this approach will be given.

The God of which the Baha'1 Faith teaches is a personal God who
communes with men.     He is the Lord (Bhagavan), and His message is a
message of love.     At this point, however, one may ask, 'How does the
strict monotheism of Baha' 1 scripture find a place in the villages of Malwa
where the Sacred has traditionally been seen to reside in numerous forms?'
In answering this <J.Uestion it must be realized that at this point in time
the Baha':l Administrative Order is not overly concerned with the way
individuals conceive of the Divine.      'rhe fact that any human conception
84 Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 99

of God is realized to be only a partial understanding of the Sacred leads
to a tolerant attitutude towards conceptualization. 85     This is not to say
that Bill1a'J: teachers in Malwa accept the doctrine of polytheism and try
to include it in their presentation of Baha'1 beliefs.       To the contrary,
the oneness of God is always preached.      Rather, it means that in the
Baha '1 Faith individual interpretation is not condemned:     the approach to
metaphysics is a positive one whereby the relativity of religious truth is
accepted.    Historically, concepts of the Sacred have differed because room
for speculation about the nature of the Divine is infinite.       This being
the case, man 1 s purpose is not to contemplate the unanswerable but to follow
the teachings of the manifestation, and consequently Baha' 1 teachers do
not spend time negating traditional doctrines but constantly return to the
concept of the manifestation and his authority.       Emphasis is placed on
listening to his words and following his commands.       'l'hus it is believed
that the combination of education and role repetition wiil in time result
in new believers coming to understand and accept a more transcendent concept
of the Sacred.

There is, however, one way in which many teachers attempt to explain
the unity of the Divine to villagers and that is by describing individual
deities as expressions or attributes of the one Supreme Lord.        For example,
the author was informed by one village teacher that he portrayed God as the
Divine Being vhose three most outstanding attributes are represented by the
figures of Brahma, Vi~':,lu, and Siva :   Brahma represents God's creative aspect;
Vi~!JU symbolizes His preserving powers; and Siva exemplifies His destructive

energy.

Regarding man, villagers are taught that his purpose is to know and
love God, and that this is best achieved through proper action in the
world.         In this vein, the Baha'i teachings greatly resemble those of the
Bhagavad Gita in which Krsna advances a doctrine of action devoid of
personal desire.        According to Radbakrishnan:

> 'l'he GitB: insists not on renunciation of action
> but on action with renm1ciation of desire. ~'his
> is true sarbr1yasa ••• The Gita urges that the liberated
> soul can remain in service even after liberation
> and is opposed to the view which holds that, as
> all action springs from ignorance, when .risdom arises,
> action ceases.87
If proper action is the goal of man's life, the natural question .rhich
arises is: 'What is proper action'!'          In the villages of Mal.ra the sources
of proper action (dharma) have traditionally been three:           sacred books;
myths and legends; and traditions of the ancestors, and of the three the
last in the most universally accepted guide.           Bah8. 1 f teachers, however,

define proper action as adhering to the teachings of the manifestation.
Thus the lle.r Garden cites    Kf~ga' s   demanding Arjuna to surrender himself
as an example of man's duty to follo>r the commands of the manifestation:

> Hhen we find the Manifestation of God and embrace
> His faith, we must obey His commands. This is what
> Krishna taught us in the Gita .•. "Surrendering in
> thought all actions to Me, regarding He as the
> Supreme and restoring to Steadfastness in understanding,
> do thou fix thy thought constantly on Me"89
Of the doctrines being taught by the Bah a '1 movement in Malwa the
denial of reincarnation or transmigration of souls is at greatest odds .ri th
traditional village belief.        According to the doctrine of samsara, the
86 'I'his approach is by no means new.   As early as Gupta times (fourth and

fifth centuries A.D.) the trimurti (triple form) had been propounded.

the present life is only a link in a chain of births reaching back into
the past and extending into the future.     Hovement along this chain is
determined by karma, a typeof spiritual law of cause and effect.      Every
action has its reaction, and thus if one acquires bad karma through
improper action the consequences will become manifest in the future, which
on the popular level means being born as a. member of a lower caste or
as a member of the animal kingdom.    Concerning this belief K.• S. t-lathur

As may be recalled, the Baha'i Faith teaches that man has a soul which
upon passing from the body does not re-enter the temporal sphere of
existence but continues to evolve in other worlds of God.      Baha'i teachings
do, however, contain a doctrine of the return of qualities.     For example,
every year a tree will bring forth flowers.    The f'loVIers of this year are
the same as the floVIers of last year in terms of their qualities, but they
are not the same individual flowers that actually bloomed.     So in tl1e human
Vlorld qualities can be said to return, but the individual soul does not.
In clarifying this position Shoghi Effendi stated:

9lQuoted in James Heggie, Baha'i Concordance, vol. II, unpublished, p. 82

Consequently, Baha' f teachers explain the clothes referred to by K;~';la as
realities of the different worlds of God and not the physical bodies of
this 1wrld.      liloreover, while it is agreed that the karma one obtains in
life influences his spiritual growth in future worlds, )-t is not accepted
that an individual's position in the world is predetermined by the actions
of past lives.      Accordingly, one's dharma should not be determined by
birth status but by the teachings of the manifestation of God.

In reflec·ting on the fact that numerous Hindu villagers have declared
their belief in Balla'u'llah, three factors must be kept in mind:               first,
the relative freedom of' thoU!Sht in Hinduism;          second, the historico-
synthetic     approach of the Baha'i Faith;         and third, the awareness, even
at the village level, of the decline of' religion.

As noted earlier, theological. speculation has always been tolerated
to a greater degree in Hinduism than in other religious traditions..                ~rhe

new student of Hinduism is often amazed at the variety of 'religions' that
are con·tained within the Hindu fold, for unlike Christianity or IsHi.m there
is no 'church' <Thich controls doctrinal thought.             VTtdle in Semitic
religions acceptance of specific creeds has played an            im~)ortant   role in
determining     one 1 s position in the community, in Hinduism it has been the
adherence to specific modes of action as determined by an individual's
social status that has been considered crucial.              Hence, what is believed
is not as important as 11ha t is done.         A man can be an atheist, a monist,
a theist, a Vai~:t;;J-avite, a Saivite, or a Ved8.ntin, and sti11 be a Hindu,.
but if he violates his caste rules regarding marriage and commensality or
assumes a ritual role \-Jhich is not his by birth, he can be excorr..mun.icated
from the community.      Consequently, the fact that many Hah1a villagers
have accepted the claims of' a ne·w ~vatar~ and are learning his doctrines
does not mean that they are vi.olating ·c·he laws of Hinduism.            Moreover,
since the Bahfi 1 l movement ··-1.mlike   ot~her   religions \4hich have sought

converts in India - does not demand that a Hindu negate his past heritage
(to the contrary, Hinduism is accepted as a historically valid religious
tradition of which Bahii'u'lliih is the prophetic fulfillment), many
declarants still consider themselves Hindus:         they are Hindus who believe
in the yugavatara, Baha'u'llah.

In addition to villagers not having to denounce their Hindu heritage,
a general awareness of the decline of religion has aided the teaching

efforts of the Balla ':1 Faith.        A villager from Garabeli expressed this
feeling in the following words:

> I used to vatch the so-called believers of religion.
> They always spoke about religion ,and they always
> uttered the name of God, but for their own selfish
> ends they cheated others in every way. Having seen
> these things I became very sad. I thought, why has
> God created such people who receive benefits from
> cheating and deceiving others.

As a result of such feelings, many villagers, especially the downtrodden,
are open to doctrines and concepts which they feel are advocating a return
to 'true' religion.

As a result of these factors, the belief dimension of the Baha'i Faith
has no10 been difficult for village teachers to introduce into 'model
village' communities.      However, on the other hand, Bahr'f beliefs and
doctrines have not completely replaced traditional beliefs.          Hat her, for
the majority of declarants in the five 'mod.el village' communities
examined in this study, Baha' 1 and traditional views have become integrated..
According to village    teachers~ 3    11hile declarants vil1 admit to the belief
in one God., most of them will still offer puja at various village shrines
and temples.     Similarly, most accept the concept of heaven (parlok), but
they also accept their predestined. dharn!§::        Consequently, it appears that

92 As mentioned earlier, Hindu cosmology asserts that we are presently

living in the kali-yuga, a time of religious decline.

> from each village who have been participants in 'deepening' programs
are the most steeped in Baha 1 1 doctrines.

for the great majority of declarants in the five 'model villages' the
role of Baha'i beliefs and doctrines is at the present time one of a 'half-
way house' whereby certain categories of thought are reserved for Baha'f
concepts   while others are the domain of traditional views.     In this
respect the categorization of Baha' 1 and traditional beliefs into distinct
spheres of thought seems to some degree to reflect the social schizophrenia
mentioned in Chapter 4 which has become more characteristic of many village
communities as they try to adjust to the strain and stress brought on by
the forces of a changing world.    However, this phenomenon is also
indicative of the Baha'f teaching approach in rural areas where greater
emphasis is placed on acceptance of Baha'u'llah as an avatars than on such
concepts as the nature of the Sacred or life after death.      As a result,
it is this concept that finds universal acceptance in the 'model village'
communities, and one can hear the name Baha'u'llah as often as Rii.ma, ~?':a,

or Siva.    It is on this fundamental belief that the Baha' '[ Administrative
Order is attempting to build, and thus, as we shall shortly see, all
activities in the rural communities are in some way related to the personage
of the yugavatara.

Chapter 8   Ritual and Ceremony

In Chapter 4 it \Vas noted that behavior patterns of Halva villagers
have traditionally been influenced by a rigid system of ritual observance,
ritual being defined as a category of standardized        behavj~r    in   ~Vhich   the
relationship between means and ends is either irrational or non-rational,
or in other   ~Vords,    conventional activity based on mystical notions, whereby

a specific action and its implied end cannot be inferred from observation.
Even today ritual activity is part and parcel of villagers' life patterns,
and it can be manifestly observed on ntunerous occasions.            For example,
lfhen making an offering to a god a devotee will follow a prescribed formula
in belief that the proper performar1ce of symbolic activity will result in
beneficial consequences.         Similarly, specific events in an individual's
life cycle, such as birth, marriage, and death are commemorated by ritual
observances (samskaras), whose proper enactment insure the participant (s)
of a successful transition.         Thus, the cremated remains of a dead man are
often thrown into holy ~Vaters (in Halwa the Sipra river), an act which is
believed to gurantee the individual's salvation.          Ritual mentality even
influences the domain of dining, as it is believed that the improper
performance of eating - ie. eating certain foods which have been prepared
by a member of a caste lower than one 1 s own - will result in }!ersonal
pollution, a state requiring the enactment of another ritual (often bathing
in special water) to remove the taint.

In contrast to popular Hinduism the Baha '1 Faith is notably lacking
in ritual content.        In terms of a definition of ritual vhich implies
standardized activity based on irrational or non-rational connections between
ends and means, one vould conclude that the principal modes of behavior in

1 Max Gluckman, 'Les Rites de Passage', Essays on the Ritual of Social
Relations, ed. by Hax Gluckman, (t·lanchester, 1962), p. 22

the Faith's teachings that could be termed ritualistic <Jould be prayer

.   2   In addition, its scriptures prescribe t1v·o'passage'rituals
and fast 1ng.
which although not as elaborate as the Hindu samskiras, require specific
modes of standardized behavior whose enactment implies a type of mystical
relationship bet1reen ends and means.

There is, however, another type of standardized group activity in the
Baha'1 Faith, the primary purpose of \lhich is not the achievement of
specific ends based on participants' perforrr:.ance of symbolic action but
the development of group solidarity or social cohesion through
commemoration of important events in the movement's past.              For our
purposes this type of activity will be referred to as 'ceremonious' ,
following llax Gluckman's definition \lhich says that ceremony refers to
any complex organization of       hum~~   activity which is not specifically
technical or recreational, and which involves the use of modes of behavior
which are expressive of social relationships, but 11hich is           not

characterized by the implementation of mystical notions.

In the follo\ling pages various Baha''l rituals and ceremonies will
be examined in greater detail, first in their normative forms, and then
as   the~r   are being adapted to conditions in rural Iilalva.       Finally, a few
examples of their implementation in several 'model villa5e 1 communities
will be cited.

The core of ritual activity in the Bah€i'i Faith is prayer.           \mile
God only reveals I{imself to a manifestation, Baha'is believe that

2 Chanting or reading prescribed prayers and abstaining from food for a

given period of time are believed to be spiritually beneficial, a
belief whose results cannot be inferred from observation.

individuals can have limited comruunication with the Sacred:

> There is a "language of the spirit", which is
> independent of speech or writing, by which God
> can col!1.'lltme with and inspire those whose hearts
> are seeking after truth, wherever they are,
> whatever their native race or tongue.4

'rherefore) in the Bahii' l Faith prayer belongs to that dimension of religious
life that is concerned with 'spiritual experiences 1                                                               ,   ' ••   c   those feelings,
perceptions, and sensations 11hich are experienced by the actor or defined
by a religious group (or a society) as involving some communication,
however slight, with a divine essence, that is, with God,                                                                         ~.;ith     ultimate
reality, with transcendental authority. • 5                                                        '-Abdu 1 1-Bah&. expressed this
connection ;;i th the Sacred in the follo11ing passage:

> ~'hewisdom of prayer is this: That it causeth
> a connection between the servant and the True One,
> because in that state man with all heart and soul
> turneth his face towards His Highness the Almighty,
> seeking His association and desiring His love and
> compassion.6
The attitude of prayer, moreover, should be one of devotion.                                                                                 God is
the beloved "hom the believer longs to praise, and in so doing receives
the spiritual benefits of His returned grace.                                                              Thus prayer is not only
communication vith the Sacred but a form of worship inspired by feelings
of respect and love.                               The true devotee is detatched from the bondage of
self and seeks his joy in exalting the Lord. 7

There are essentially two types of prayer in the Baha'1 Faith:

individual devotion, and communal worship.

Individual prayer consists of the devotee chanting, reading,    01·

meditating upon the revealed verses of the Bab, Bah a' u 'llah, or 'Abdu 'l-

> Baha.8      Baha'is are supposed to pray individually at lease once each day,
> and thus prayer is considered an obligatory act, a requisite for man's
> spiritual growth. 9      The most important aspect of prayer, ho-wever, is not
the words but the devotional attitude of love within the worshiper.
Consequently, Bahii 1 l prayers are not viewed as magical mantras whose

repetition alone can bring about a state of communion with the Divine
but as objects of concentration which help elicit the feelings of
selflessness necessary for such communication.

Baha 1 i scriptures prescribe three obligatory prayers.   The believer
> is free to choose from among these, but he is under obligation to recite
> at least one each day.        The most commonly used obligatory prayer is the
short    praye~   which is reproduced below:

> I bear \Vi tness, 0 rrry God, that Thou hast created
> me to know Thee and to worship Thee. I testify,
> at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might,
> to my poverty and to Thy \fealth. There is none
> oti1er God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-
> Subsisting.lO
In addition, the believer is encouraged to chant and sing a variety of
verses throughout the day.

The second type of devotional activity in the Baha'1 Faith is communal
\forship.      In Balla' 1 commtmal lforship members of the local community gather
together to share in the chanting of prayers and the reading of scriptural
verse.       At these meetings there is no congregational prayer, that is)

dead.        Furthermore, there is no leader who directs devotional activities;
unlike Islam, the Baha'i Faith has no imams behind whom the faithful stand
to recite their prayers.          In fact, there are no priests or spiritual

leaders of any k lnd ln the Baha l communlty.              Rather, members of the
faithful take turns reciting prayers and reading scripture, each believer
being considered spiritually equal to the next.

The occasion on which community members gather for communal worship
is known as the Nineteen-Day Feast.            This gathering of the faithful was
establlshed by the Bab,

/ 14 and as its title implies it takes place every
nineteen days.          The meeting also signifies the     beginnin~    of each month
of the Baha'f year, the calendar being divided into nineteen months of
nineteen days each.

The Nineteen-Day Feast is held in a community's Baha'1 center, or in
those communities where a center does not exist              it is convened in any

spot where the group can assemble, an individual home,or the open air.

\[1\] Attendance at Nineteen-Day Feasts is not obligatory but very important,
and every believer should consider it a duty and a priviledge to be present
on such occasions. 115         Feasts occur on the following dates:

The Nineteen-Day Feast is divided into three distinct parts, only one
of which is devotional in nature,   Future pages   ~<ill   discuss the
administrative and social portions of the meeting.         As for nov, only its
devotional aspects will be examined.

\[16\] 'Abdu'l-Baha, in Principles of Baha'i Administration, p. 17

The devotional portion of the Nineteen-Day Feast is considered the
core of Baha'f communities' spiritual activity, for it is at this time
that members regularly share in the experience of communal worship.             The
devotional period takes place at the beginning of each meeting and consists
of prayers and verses f rom t h e sacred wrltlngs read by indivldual believers.
As there are no spiritual leaders who select the verses to be read, the
designated host (a duty which alternates between the members of the
community) organizes the program, but individual participants are free
to offer their own prayers and verses as they feel inspired.           The session
generally lasts between fifteen minutes and half an hour, but there is no
prescribed limit to the length of the devotional period, and it is not
concluded until all those who so desire have taken part.

The mood of the devotional period is meant to be one of communion
between the believers and the Lord.      It should be an experience in love and
unity, the faithful freely partaking of the choice wine of the word of God
and thereby becoming one     in fello1<ship vith Baha'u'llah.       Hence,   Ba..~a'   l
communal vorship reflects the ideal of the equality of believers, a value
vhich lies at the core of Baha'i social nonns.

As the above description reveals, Baha'i communal devotion is
completely lacking in symbolic drama (a traditional element of ritual
activity),its only mode of action being the verbalization of the sacred
vord.      Thus, in the Baha'i Faith ritual performance is centered on the
abstract vord, and goal achievement does not depend on t'       2   enactment of
sacremental gestures but on the experience of the 'mystery of the Holy
Utterance'.

l7 Concerning the sacred 1<ritings Shoghi Effendi wrote: 1 • • • these should
be regarded as the vritings of the Bab, Baha'u'lliih and 'Abdu'l-Baha

> and only these should be read during the purely devotional part of

18 Principles of Baha 1 1 Administration, p. 52
A second ritual in the Baha'f Faith is fasting.         The author has
classified     this abstention from food and water as a rit•1alistic act
because it is a standardized form of behavior - all Baha'fs are required
to fast during the same period - and its enactment is believed to develop,
strengthen, and purify the soul, an implied end 1lhich cannot be verified
by o b servatlon.

Regarding the regulations related to the Baha' '( fast, A Synoosis and
Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, a publication of the Universal House
of Justice which outlines the various lavs and ordinances set dovn by
Baha 1 u 1 llah and is used by Baha'1s throughout the iwrld, cites the
following:

The fast is an annual event 1lhich starts on the second day of Narch and
ends on the twentieth day of the same month.         During this nineteen day
period the believer is meant to abstain from food and drink from sW1rise

to sW1set.        'It is essentially a period of meditation and prayer, of
spiritual recuperation, during which the believer must strive to make the

necessary readjustments in his inner-life, and to refresh and reinvigorate

the spiritual forces latent in his soul. •
The prescribed manner for starting each day of the fast involves

arising before dmm to offer prayers of thanksgiving to God.                Having taken
food and drink before the sun rises, the believer abstains from both during
the daylight hours, breaking his fast at sunset after once again chanting
prayers.

Like Baha'1 communal devotion, the fast accentuates the spiritual
equality of believers;        all members of the community regardless of social
rank are required to humble themselves before the Lord in uniform
abstention from the desires of the world.            As a circular distributed by
the National Spiritual Assembly of' the Baha'is of' India aptly stated:

The final categories of' behavior in the Baha''l Faith that can be
termed ritualistic are the'passage'rites.            In Baha'1 teachings there are

of the commllility.        Accordingly, there is no ritual to denote social status
ru1til after one has become part of the commllility, and hence there are only
two life cycle rituals in the Bah a 1 'l Faith:        the marriage ceremony, and
the service for the dead.

The Baha 1 f Faith upholds marriage as a fllildamental institution of
civilization~ 5 and consequently there is no room within the commllility for
celibacy or asceticism.

The scriptures enjoin   monogamy~ 7   the requirements
for marriage including the mutual consent of the individuals involved as
well as the written approval of their parents.               Accordingly, in the Baha 1 1
commllility there are no arranged marriages without the participants'
consent, but on the other hru1d, marriage without the approval of parents
is not permitted.           In this vein, Shoghi Effendi reaffirmed that Baha 1 u 1 llah

The marriage ritual is not elaborate;       it is simple and free from

participants.           In front of at least two witnesses they must state, 'lie

'There should be no comingling of the old forms with the new and simple
one by Baha'u'llah, and Baha'is should not be married in the church or any

other aclmowledged place of worship of the followers of other faiths.'
Consequently, a Baha'f marriage generally takes place in a Baha'f center
or a private home.          Again, as there are no priests in the Bahfi 1 l Faith
no one marries the couple.          Rather, by stating their vmr in front of God
and friends the individuals pronounce themselves married.              Then follm<s a
joyous celebration at ':Ihich guests parta}r;.e of food, music, and songe

The prescriptions regarding the means of disposing of the dead in the
Baha'1 Faith are more elaborate than those regarding marriage.              The dead
are buried, and there is a prohibition against cremation.

31 As it is
believed that the body should be intermed as soon after death as
circumstances permit, there is also an interdiction against carrying it
more than an hour's journey from the place of death.

32   'caving been wrapped
in a shroud of either cotton or silk, and having had a ring placed on its
finger bearing the inscription 'I came forth from God, and return unto Him,

the body should be placed in a coffin of stone or hard
wood.

The observance should reflect attitudes of solenmi ty and respect, but
there should be no wailing or lamenting on the part of attendants.
Having gathered at the gravesight, community members hear the one

associated with Baha'f burial, the ritual is completed.

Besides the three categories of ritual: prayer and devotion, fasting,
and rites of passage, Bah&.'l.s also observe certain occasions which are
ceremonious in nature.           111ese events are knm1n as holy days, and they are
nine in number:

Baha'f ceremonies can be divided into two main categories:                   those
which are joyous and are referred to as festivals;                  and those vhich are
more solemn, the latter being commemorations of the deaths of the Faith's
founders.      Both types, however, present opportunities for believers to be
made more avare of their religio-historical heritage, a process which

should be   .i... elated   to the event being commemorated, there are no prescribed
formats for these occasions, and consequently, besides specific times at
which some of them are to be celebrated, BahB.'l ceremonJ..es are generally
lacking in standardized content.              Each observance doefl have, however, a
general type of ceremonial activity associated with it, and in the
following paragraphs short descriptions of the events 11ill be presented.

lJ1be Feast of Nm-r-RCiz (l':Iarch 21) marks the beginning of the Bah6. 'l
year and signifies the end of the fasting period.               This ceremony is one
of the joyous occasions referred to in Bal1ii'l writings as festivals.                 On
the prescribed day members of the local community assemble for the purpose
of sharing in food, song, and general merriment.               Thus, like other Hevr
Year celebrations throughout the 1wrld, the Naw--Ruz ceremony commemorates
by means of joyous community interaction the passing of the old and the
advent of the new.

The next three holy days (April 21, April 29, and Nay 2) take place
during the 'days of          RjqvAn',   a twelve day period marking Bal18.'u'll8.h's
last hours in Ba~dad before his exile to Turkey.                Of the three, the
most important is the first, the day on 1fhich Ba11a'u'llah declared to
his followers that he 1ms 'Him vhom God shall manifest'.                In celebrating
this festival Bah8. 'ls throughout the world follm'<' the advice of The Ridv8.n
Tablet:

> Rejoice with exceeding gladness, 0 people of

mournful events like the Shl 'ah cownemorution of the martyrdom of IJusayn ~l
they are different in tone and character from Balla' i festivals, the mood
of the particpants being more reverent and subdued.            During the observances
believers listen to reconstructions of the events and offer verses of
praise to the Bab and Baha'u'llah.

The final tvo holy days on the Bal1a' i calendar are the Birthday of
the Bab (October 20) and the Birthday of Bah a 'u' llah (November 12).         Both
ceremonies follov the pattern of other Bal,a' i festivals, the believers
coming together to voice the praises of the manifestations and to sha:re
in communal celebration.

As can be seen from the foregoing descriptions, one of the main
functions of Baha' :L holy day observances is to promote g_,oup solidarity.
During the ceremonies emphasis is not placed on communication vith the
Sacred or the performance of non-rational activity but on the common
emotional response.     By making followers avare of their religio-cultural
heritage and allowing them to share in a communal situation the feelings
of joy and sorrow, such occasions help instill in adherents' minds the
attitudes of common purpose and identity.      This function was understood
by 'Abdu'l-Baha 1rhen he 1rrote:

> .•. it hath been decided by the desire of God that
> union and harmony may day by day increase among the
> friends of God •.• And the greatest means for the
> union and harmony of all is Spiritual 1--Ieetings. 42

In attempting to introduce declarants in 1clahra to the ritualistic and
ceremonial aspects of BahB.'l community life the     Ba~8.'l   Administrative Order
in India has adopted a policy of gradualism.        \Vhile on the one hand new

belieV"ers are informed about the necessity of saying daily prayers)
fasting, holding feasts, and celebrating holy days, Baha' 1 administrators
have not tried to overwhelm them by demanding sudden adherence to new
patterns of behavior which are in many wa;ys alien to Hindu cultw:·e.
For example, the Baha' 1 concept of prayer vhereby the devotee's primary
activity is a verbalization of revealed. verses is essentially different
from the popular form of     nuja   found. in J.!alwa vhich involves the use of
images and. elaborate modes of symbolic drama.               Similarly, while Baha' 1
ritual and ceremony emphasizes the eq_uality of all members of the community,
Hindu feasts and. festivals are marked. by caste exclusiveness.              As K. S.
Hathu.r reported.:

> Similar restrictions are imposed on inter•caste
> participation in communal festivals and domestic
> ceremonies. In festivals in 'clean• caste houses
> all 'clean' castes participate on an equal basis.
> !.!embers of 'unclean 1 castes may be allm<ed to
> participate but only in the capacity of servants,
> whereas 'untouchable' castes are invariably
> excluded from participation. 43

Therefore, instead of requiring immediate and radical change in the behavior
patterns of nev declarants, the Bah a 1 1 Adrninistrati ve Order is trying to
slo1lly modify ritualistic modes of activity by introducing certain aspects
of Ba..l-J.a '1 ritual and ceremony into a n1.unber of   t   model village 1 communities.
In the process Bahil'i teachers do not malign traditional ritualistic

practices, neither do they demand., as do other religious groups,                 that new
d.eclarants completely abandon these observances.               Rather, an attempt is
being made to influence change through the positive process of religious
resocialization whereby old. forms are tolerated at the same time as new ones
are being   implemented~     Viewing the :movement's consolidation program in
this light, ve shall proceed. to examine those aspects of B~~a'i ritual and.

communities in rural Malwa.

The introduction of prayer presents a two-sided problem for Baha' :L
teachers in Nalwa.        First, unless a verse can be memorized,         Bru1a'l prayer
demands a literate devotee who can read from a prayerbook, and as we have
r;een, the great majority of declarant3 in l'.-1al;,.n::t.. arc; i11iterate.   iJecond)
as mentioned   earlier~   prayer in the sense that it i3 understood in the
Baha'1 Faith is not part of the local ritual tradition, and therefore
its practice does not come easy to a Hindu declarant.               In an attempt to
overcome these difficulties the Baha'i Administrative Order has adopted
certain procedural methods of approach specifically designed for use in
a rural context.

The main method by which Balla' f administrators are attempting             to
introduce prayer into the lives of village believers is by maldng use of
those followers in various communities who are literate.               The Ujjain
Regional Teaching Committee is continuously encouraging such individuals to
attend 'deepening' sessions in Indore and Ujjain, and in many instances
it pays for their transportation costs.           At these sessions literate
believers are instructed to help illiterate declarants by reading them the
prayers and vritings, thus allowing them to come into contact vith the
holy word.     In addition, these believers are encouraged to help organize
sessions of communal worship in their respective communities at vhich they
can teach fello1< declarants short prayers and devotional phrases ~5

The second means of introducing prayer into the village communities
is through the implementation of the region's corps of travelling teachers.
Of all the believers in rural Mal1m this group are the most 'deepened' in
the teachings and practices of the Baha''l F'aith, and they form the

best channel of communication between the Bahii 'l &'J.ministrative system
and the local village communities.

It has been the general feeling among members of the Ujjain Regional
Teaching Cotllmi ttee that rather than spending time teaching declarants
numerous devotional verses, the travelling teachers should concentrate on
encouraging new believers to recite one short prayer or devotional phrase.
Consequently, during their rounds travelling teachers speak to declarants
about the    import&~ce   of saying the short obligatory prayer 46 or the
traditional Baha 1 1 devotional phrases 'Allah'u 1 Abha'

47   and'Ya   Baha 1 u'l-Abha~~
Furthermore, travelling teachers are instructed to meet with the more
literate members in the various      corr~unities   and to encourage them to initiate
feasts and group devotions in their respective villages.            The philosophy
behind this approach is the same one used to justify the training of
individual       believers at the Indore Teaching Institute; namely, that
although the majority of declarants are not able to read prayers, their
presence at occasions \There the holy verses are being verbalized \Till

provide them with spiritual benefits.          In this vein, one specific
project lmmched in 1971 required travelling teachers to encourage village
believers to as semble for dawn prayers. 50

Hhile the training of literate villagers to act as initiators of
Baha'i devotional activity has to some degree alleviated the problem of

literacy ·being a prerequisite for contact vi th the 'divine' word, the
question of cultural alienation still remains.          For this reason, a form
of devotional activity more easily integrated into the Indian cultural
context has been adopted.         This is the Baha'f bhajan

A bha,jan is a style of rythmic song vhich has long been popular among
bhakti sects in India. 51 Even today, many vandering bards and devotional
singers perform these songs in tolfns and villages, and their voices are
a familiar sound in the rural areas of Malwa.          \>Jhen a bhajan is performed
in a group situation         one of the devotees stands and sings the various
verses of the song       vhile the entire assemblage joins in unison to sing
the vords of the refrain.         Bhajans 1 contents are generally devotional in
nature, their verses extolling the deeds of gods, saints and heroes.

A large number of Baha'i bhajans have arisen in India during the mass
teaching era,    n~ny   of them being the creations of village believers.
Although technically not prayers, their verses of praise give them a
definite devotional character, and as a result bha,jans have been approved
by the Indian National Spiritual Assembly as an acceptable form of Baha'i
activity.    In order that the reader might obtain a better understanding
of the form and content of Bah a 1 l bha,jans, verses from three such songs
have been translated belovr.

As the form and content of the above songs reveal, Bah a 1 1 bha,i ans
are reminiscent of traditional Hindu bhal<t:h_ poetry.               Their repetition of
verses of praise filled lfi th the glorifications of God and His avatar a
mirrors the form used by medieval bhal<ti poets.                 Furthermore, the nurnerous
references to Hindu cultural images (Visnu, Racil1a, Arjuna, koyal etc.)
reveal an attempt to correlate Baha 1 u 1 llah lfi th traditional devotional
symbols.    Because of this identification vith traditional cultural forms
and symbols, Baha 1 J: bha,j ans are more meaningful to Hindu Jeclarants than
the standard style of Baha 1 l devotion (prayer), and consequently they
have become the most popular form of devotional activity in rural 11alwa,
and travelling teachers often use them as a means of inv-olving illiterate
declarants in Baha' 1 communal gatherings, both feasts and holy day
observances.

\Thile a definite effort is being made to introduce some type of
devotional activity into the 'model village 1 cormnllli ties, the emphasis
placed on fasting and the observance of 'passage' rites has not been as
acute.        Although articles concerning these injunctions appear in the
>rritten material sent to the villages, and their significance is stressed
in 'deepening' courses, there has not been an active campaign to implement
them in village life.            It is commonly felt by Baha'i administrators in
India that at this stage in the development of Baha'f communities in rural
Halwa the most meaningful aspects of Baha' f life to be emphasized by
village teachers are the fundamental doctrines of the oneness of God, His
manifestations, and His creatures, and the communal gatherings, ><hether
devotional, ceremonious, or administrative in nature, and not the finer
laws     of   fastin~marriage,etc.            Consequently, great import has not been
attatched to the latter, for they would require declarants to make radical
changes in conventional behavior patterns, a process vrhich if forced upon
new believers might well act as a deterrent to the development of the
more important elements of the Baha' 'L educational program, if not to the
entire movement.        This is not to imply that within 'model village'
communities there are no individuals who fast or obey the finer laws of
the Faith, as in many of these com.munities there are persons who do so,
especially among the travelling teachers and village primary school teachers
(see Chapter ll).        Rather, it is to point out that in terms of mass
consolidation these elements are not considered to be the most important of
the movement's objectives •               It is interesting to note, however, that         ~<hile

The Administrative Order is, however, trying to introduce the
Hineteen-Day Feast and. holy day observances into the 'model village'

communities.        Behind this policy lies the assumption that if declarants
can begin to identify with Baha'i group activities, not only will their
new beliefs be strengthened, but they will begin to develop a sense of
Baha'i communal identity which will in time          pave the 1ray for meaningful
changes in their patterns of behavior.           Consequently, all regular channels
of communication linking village communities uith the greater administrative
institutions of the Faith are employed to help in this process.           Newsletters
and circulars sent to village communities list the dates of' feasts and
holy days and remind the declarants of the import of' observing such
occasions.     Moreover, Bahai Darsan, the neuspaper published by the Ujjain
Regional Teaching Committee and distributed in many of the local villages,
often prints special commemorative articles to mark the holy days.            For
example, in October of 1973 a special issue >ras published         in observance
of the Birth of the Bab          in which the major events of the young Siyyid' s
life vere recounted.

63 In the same manner, the Indore Teaching Institute
includes in its training classes instructions concerning the celebration
of feasts and holy    days 6 ~   and travelling teachers are specifically
instructed how and when feasts and holy day celebrations should. be
observed.       In this regard,        on one of the examinations periodically

In the five 'model village' communities examined in this study> the
implementation of Bah8.' l ritual and ceremonial activity has only been
partial.        According to village teachers, while devotional meetings and
holy day celebrations are held with some degree of regularity, on an
individual level compliance is noticeably lacldng.             For   ex&~ple,   in each
community individual prayer and fasting are practiced by only a handful of
believers, and in most cases these persons have had extensive contact with
Bah8. 1 i. institutions outside of their village; that is, they have attended
teaching institutes and regional conferences or acted as either travelling

t eac h ers or Vl"11 age prlmary
.    scnoo1 t eac h ers.      Such 'deepened' believers

appear, however, to be ardent in their endeavors;           most of them know several
prayers from memory and recite them daily.           One villager in R1cha had even
memorized the entire Tablet of Ahn1ad, a prayer of over eighty lines in
length held to be invested with special spiritual potency.              Moreover,
while the majority of declarants in these communities do not pray daily,
they do knm-r tl1e Bah&.' l devotional phrases 'All8.h' u 1 Abh8.' and 'Y8. BallS. 'u '1-
Abhai and as a result both can be heard within the villages at regular
intervals   e

\mile individual prayer and fasting are not a common phenomenon in
these    co~nunities,   the Nineteen-Day Feast is periodically celebrated,
although according to village teachers attendance at the meetings often
varies.         The fluctuation in attendance would fit into the Hindu ritual
idiom where, except for certain 'high' castes, there is no specific time
for \Iorship, and consequently people attend to these matters only when they
feel they have a need to do so.         K. S. tclathur found in his village that
'Such a view about the use of religious worship is shared by most of the
young and able-bodied men of all castes. ' 67

An   exmnple of the celebration of the Nineteen-Day Feast in rural
l<lalwa was the Feast of Sovereignty (Sultan) held in village Hlcha on the
evening of January 18, 1974.       Preparation for the meetL1g began during
the afternoon when the resident Baha'i travelling teacher visited the
community's various declarants to remind them that the meeting would take
place in the evening under one of the large trees situated on the edge of
the village.       At about half past seven believers began to assemble, and
by eight o'clock there were fourteen men present including Brahrna':ls, Hajputs
Chamars, and Balais, all of whom sat themselves in a circle around a small

fire.        The devotional part of the meeting lasted approximately fifteen
minutes.       It began with a prayer read by the Baha'i teacher who then
proceeded to elaborate on the import of the Nineteen-Day Feast in the life
of a Baha'i community.       Upon the conclusion of his talk a second member
of the community (a Brahmall) read one of The Hidden Hords.      This was
followed by the reading of several more verses from the writings of
Baha'u'lliih and 'Abdu'l-Baha (by a Brahma!,l and a Rajput) and another short
invocation by the village teacher.       Before closing the devotional period
the teacher reminded the participants of the importance of repeating the
devotional phrase 'Allah'u'Abha' during the course of their daily vork.
He then ended the devotions with a prayer.

\lhile short in duration the atmosphere surrounding the session was
one of gaiety and friendship.      Between prayers participants conversed with
one another and there vas no sign of caste exclusiveness - 'low' caste
members vere not isolated or segregated in any vay.       Horeover, following
the termination of the session all of the members shared roasted nuts and
engaged in spirited social intercourse.

As can be gleaned from the description of the Hlchil meeting,
devotional sessions in the village are not elaborate;       they are usually
short in duration and center around specific literate believers.
According to the resident teachers in the other four villages the same
pattern holds in their communities, a situation vhich is no doubt partially
a consequence of illiteracy-.       It is also an indication: however, of the
difficulty involved in trying to introduce a culturally alien institution
into village life, and conse'luently it vould appear that the future of
communal vorship in rural Malwa depends on the development of bha.ja.n
sessions which provide both a wider base for believer participation and a
more intimate link with Hindu cultural forms and symbols.        However, at
this point in time the Baha '1 Administrative Order is primarily concerned
that declarants assemble, even for short periods, and that the meetings
reflect an atmosphere of unity and brotherhood.        Thus, the fact that in
both Kasod and Garabeli members of the Balai caste read from B~~a'1
scriptures is considered more important than the length of meetings or
the number of active participants, for in traditional Hindu practice an
'unclean 1 casteman is not allowed to learn or have access to the Vedas. 9

Consequently, for the moment one of the main functions of the Nineteen-
Day Feast is to demonstrate to declarants that in Bah a '1 co:mrnunal worship
there is no variation of roles based on caste lines and thereby contrast
it with the assumptions of orthodox l!induisrn.'TO

During the author's stay in Malwa only one Baha' 1 holy day arose (trav-
Rilz).      However, in addition to supplementary information supplied by
village teachers, a written report describing another holy day observance
held earlier in the year (the Birth of Bah a' u 1 llah) 'eras obtained, and

consequently a few words concerning these two occasions will be mentioned
here.

On the evening of Harch 20, 1974, the Haw-Ruz festival was celebrated
by the Baha'i community in r.lanasa.       The ceremony took place in the village's
Baha'i bhavan , a building which acts both as a school for children during
the day and a center for community meetings and celebrations.               The resident
school teacher directed the observance at which 31 male believers were in
attendance (29 Rajputs, 1 Chamar, and 1 Balai).             After reading a prayer
and a selection from the <ll'itings of Baha 'u 'llah the teacher spoke to
the assembled group about the meaning of Naw-Ruz, comparing it to Hindu
festivals and pointing out that just as Divali ~

Holi7 2 and Dasahra 73 were
times for rejoicing, the Baha'i New Year observance was an occasion for
community celebration.       Following his speech bhajans vere sung and
participants conversed freely in an atmosphere of gaiety and friendship.

A letter vritten to the National Spiritual Assembly by a member of
another 'model village' conununity recounting the events that took place at
the observance of the Birth of Baha'u'llah reveals a similar scene to the
one in Manasa:

A village   ~~

According to village teachers the formats of the celebrations cited
above are typical of holy day observances in the five 'model village'
communities.    Thus, like devotional sessions, Baha'i ceremonies are not
elaborate affairs.     Rather, when o"bserved they appear to be simple
gatherings organized by village teachers at which the assembled declarants
listen to Bah8. 'l writings and songs and are reminded by means of
instructional talks of the significance of' particular events deemed
sacred in the Baha'i world, a process which Baha'i administrators and
teachers hope will provide new believers with the foundations for a new
religious mythology (a mythology expressed through the revealed word
rather than symbolic drama) which will act as a socio-psychological
reinforcement to group identity.

Before closing it should be pointed out that with a few exceptions
declarants in the five communities have not given up their traditional
patterns of ritual behavior, nor has it been part of the Balla '1
Administrative Order's teaching ru1d consolidation policy to demand
this of them.    Hence, while members attend Baha '1 meetings they also offer
~    in village shrines and temples and abide by caste regulations
concerning marriage and dining.      For example, in Richa a declarant who
told me he was travelling to nearby villages spreading the message of
Ba.'">a' u 1 lliih also displayed his sacred thread 75 and said be performed daily
pu,ja in the main village temple.    Similarly, in Kara.>lkani a villager

established the significance of these observations by confirming that
declarants still functioned within the Hindu :ritual   idiom~   the muin
difference between them and other villagers being their acceptance of
Baha'u'llWl and their participation in Bah&'l meetings.         Consequently~

it appears that in these communities feasts and holy day observances
are providing believers 1,rith new socio-religious frames of reference, but
they have not as yet replaced traditional forms of ritual behavior.

Chapter 9      Social Principles

One of the striking differences between the      1

world ;.,iew' of the Balla' :l
Faith and that of traditional Hinduism is their respective attitudes
towards social stratification.         In Baha'i teachings all men are considered
e~ual    in the eyes of God, and    conse~uently   within the Baha'i community there

is ideally no hierarchy of status groups.           On the other hand, in
traditional village Hinduism a man is ranl,ed according to his caste, an
institution which not only determines the nature of his social relationships
but reflects his state of purity and therefore his proximity to God.
Mention has already been made of this hierarchical structure in Chapter
4, but since its assumptions are at such great odds ;;ith the social norms
of the Baha':l Faith and are ones with which the movement must come to
terms in both    its teaching and consolidation programs, this chapter will
commence by citing a few examples of how the ideals of social              ine~uality

are manifested in the traditional village, specifically, as regards the
behavior patterns of 'unclean' and 'untouchable' caste members.                Concerning
this subject, the author is well aware, as was stated in Chapter 4, that
the influences of modernization are having a disruptive effect on the
traditional system.      However, the ideal of social         ine~uality   still remains
part and parcel of the contemporary villager 1 s 'world view', and therefore
><bile these examples are not meant to be a definitive statement regarding
the present condition of the lower castes in rural Halwa              it is the author 1 s
conviction that they reflect the essential social norms of popular Hinduism.

\[1\] In a normative sense the Bah B. 1 1 Faith is an egalitarian religion.

> Structurally, however,. there exists a hierarchy of status groups, the
> top positions being held by the manifestation, his successors:; and
> members of the Bahfi • i Adrninistrati ve Order. Regarding the latter,
> hm;ever, it should be pointed out that according to Baha'i ideals
> it is the institution and not the individual merr,bers that is raised
to a position of authority.

Two status groups which have traditionally been ranked very low in
the village social system, and ones whose nu.nibers in terms of BahS. '1:
enrollment are quite    high~      are Balais and Chrunars.      Balais are considered
Sudras and are classified as         1

Wlclc;an', 11hile Chamfirs are designated
'untouchables•. 3     Both castes receive their lm< status as a result of their
tra d ~t~ona 1 occupat.~ons.   4    Balais \Jere a weaver caste, and their work
brought them into contact vith a bov vhose string (being made of animal
tissue) defiled them. 5        Lilce~<ise,   Chamars traditionally vorked vi th      leather~
and therefore they    ~<ere    looked upon as being impure.        As a consequence
of their condition the living quarters of both Balais and Chamars are
separated from 'clean' caste dvellings, and their members are often denied
the use of specific village social services.               Moreover, in terms of
general social intercourse certain spacial taboos are applied to them.

The ground plan of most villages in Malwa, and indeed in all of India,
is characterized by its separation of 'clean' caste dvellings from
'unclean' and 'untouchable' homes.              Both K. S. l•lathur and Adrian Hayer
found this type of' housing pattern in their respective            Hal~<a villages~ and
all of the 'model village' communities investigated in this study              ~<ere

layed out along similar lines.     Consequently, Balais and Cbamtirs cannot

'clean' caste members uill rarely enter such vards.

Just as they are isolated from other members of the village in terms

Thus, they must address higher castemen uith titles of respect, and they
are expected to sit in separate groups away from the main body of villagers
during communal gatherings.     In this respect Mathur noted the following:

> l'lY observations in Potlod show that on occasions

Each caste usually has its own designated members uho perform these tasks.

'Unclean' and 'nntouchable 1 castes also have distinct deities, rituals,
and festivals which distinguish them from higher castes.                         In addition,
in those festivals which are comm1.lllal in nature they have traditionally
had to participate on an       une~ual        basis, often acting as servants to the

'clean' castes, and in many instances                  1.llltouchable 1 members have not been
allowed to participate.         !1oreover, although they are legally permitted

to enter village temples, most            1.lllclean' and 'untouchable 1 castemen will
not   fre~uent   these places because they are not allowed to worship in the
same way that 'clean' Hindus do~

Therefore, in general the role of
'unclean' and 'untouchable' castes in village social life has been one
of isolated servitude.

vlhile in popular Hinduism patterns of status group interaction are
based on concepts of purity and pollution and their implications of human
ine~uality,      the principles guiding social interaction in the Baha'i
community are more egalitarian in nature.                   The core of these principles

is the concept of the oneness of mankind, a belief which                        Abdu '1-Baha

designated as the foundation of the Faith of God                       and Shoghi Effendi
referred to as the most vital of all the principles found in Baha'u'llah's

tablets.

According to the concept of the oneness of mankind all men are
believed to be      e~ual   in the eyes of God.            :'/hile they may differ in their
potential capacities - and will of necessity attain to different intellectual

and socio-economic stations in life - they are all His children, and
their existence is sustained by His power.

14     Consequently, the social
principles of the Balla' 1 Faith are an extension of its metaphysical
beliefs.    As in Islam the emphasis placed on the Oneness and Unity of the
God-head results in a corresponding drive towards unity in the human
sphere;    God is the father of all men, and hence all of his children are
members of one family.       In the words of Balla'u'llah, 'Ye are the fruits
of one tree,and the leaves of one branch.• 15

Unlike popular Hindu doctrine, the Balla' i teachings do not posit a
belief in intrinsic impurity.       As was noted in Chapter       4, according to
Hindu belief man is born in a state of neutrality and is extremely
susceptible to impurities.      This doctrine naturally leads to a

hierarchical stratification of things 'pure' and            impure' , and in the human
sphere results in concepts of ritual inequality and thei' social
manifestations of 'untouchability' and commensal excluseivness.             Baha' 1.
doctrine, on the other hand, accepts that man is born good, and moreover that

there is nothing in existence that is intrinsically impure or evi1.
Not being divided into a range of pure and impure categories, all creation
is viewed as a unity held together by the laws of love and attraction:
Unity is necessary to existence.        Love is the very

cause of life;    on the other har1d, separation brings

From this bel1ef follolfs the social ideal that all men                       p~e   bound together

marvellous Creation. •

rrhe primary adjunct to the concept of' the oneness of mankind is the
ideal of the elimination of all prejudice - racial, sexual, national,
religious, or socio-economic.                     God loves all of His creatures equally:
'Therefore no one should glorify himself over another;                         no one should
manifest pride or superiority                   to~<ard   another;   no one should look upon
another with scorn and contempt and no one should deprive or oppress a

fellow creature.'             In terms of the Indian social environment this means
that new declarants should strive to eliminate ideas of caste exclusiveness
from their 'world         vie~<s    1

,   a goal towards which the Baha'i Administrative
Order in India is        ~<or king          but, as we shall shortly see, finding somewhat
difficult to implement.

Perhaps the most striking structural manifestation of the ideal of
equality among the faithful in the Baha'i community is L1e laclc of any type
of priesthood or body of scholars who are considered bearers of special

knovledge or guides to spiritual enlightenment.                           According to Baha'u'llan

interpretation:          a principle which allows each believer to have direct
access to his God and,unlike traditional village belief1 denies the
necessity of a religious functionary in order that communion between the
Sacred and the profane can take place~ 3

As was noted in Chapter 8, the lack of a clergy or priesthood means
that Baha'i feasts and other periods of         corr~unal   devotion are noticeably
devoid of role differentiation.           During these occasions all members of the
community are free to offer prayers, and there are no 'secret' or
sequestered verses set aside for use by specific individuals.              In fact,
according to Baha'i ideals one of the main functions of ;uch meetings is
to transcend the limitations of race, class, nationality, sect, and

personality.            Similarly, the spirit surrounding Bru1a'i ceremonies is one
of unity and equality.           All holy day observances are occasions for the
gathering of the entire body of believers~ 5 and their formats do not
provide for functional variations based on status group identification.
Instead, all members of the community sit and participate together, there
being no standardized apparel or activity distinguishing one believer

from another.           Furthermore, the programs for each occasion are not
determined by a sacrosanct body of' traditional law administered by a chosen

few but are arranged and directed by the community's derr )cratically
elected administrative body.

The structure of Baha'i local administrative institutions is also
influenced by the Faith's social principles, but as we will be examining
them in greater detail in Chapter 10 it is not necessary at this time to
give specific examples of this relationship.         It should be noted, however,
that the foundations of the entire administrative system are intimately
bound by the concept of the oneness of mankind, and as a result community
leaders are to consider themselves guardians of the faithful, their
offices being ones of service to the community and not positions of personal
status.   In this vein Shoghi Effendi 1<rote:

> Their function is not to dictate, but to consult,
> and consult not only among themselves, but as much
> as possible with the Friends whom they represent •••
> They should never be led to suppose that they are
> the central ornaments of the body of the Cause,
> intrinsically superior to others in capacity or
> merit, and sole promoters of its teachings and
> principles.27

Furthermore, as they are elected for specific periods of time, administrators
can be removed from office, and consequently there are no hereditary
positions of leadership which can undermine the concept of equality among

the faithful.

The ideal of equality of believers can also be seen in the formulation
of Baha'f laws and ordinances, as submission to the commandments of God is
part of the t1<ofold obligation of every Baha' :L:

> The first is steadfastness in His love, such
> steadfastness that neither the clamor of the enemy
> nor the claims of the idle pretender can deter him
> from cleaving unto Him vn10 is the Eternal Truth, a
> steadfastness that taketh no account of them

29 Gleanings from the Hritings of Baha'u'llah, p. 289-290

Thus, all Baha'i laws are binding on every believer, there being no special
commands set aside for a specific segment of the corrilllunlty. 30      For example,
there are no provisions for monasticism, as Baha'u'llah admonished priests
and monks to leave their cloisters and enter the world. 31          Therefore, the
laws and ordinances of the Baha 1 1 Faith help reinforce in the world of
action those lofty ideals set forth in the movement's literature - ideals
whose emphasis on unity and equality among the faithful       ~ut    them in marked
contrast to the ideals and laws of popular Hinduism which provide for

differentiation in behavior along caste lines         and thereby act as
buttresses to the concept of human inequality.

As one can readily see from the above discussion of Baha'i social
principles, the movement's approach to the question of human relations is
in fundamental conflict with the social norms of traditional village
Hinduism.    This being the case, two important queries arise:          first, why
are villagers declaring their belief in such doctrines;        and second, how
are Baha'i administrators and teachers approaching the problem of
introducing these values to new declarants?      'rhe first question will be
30 The exceptions being the aforementioned prov1s1ons for women and the

elderly regarding the fast and obligatory prayers.

considered at greater length in Chapter 12 (Conclusion) where it can be
discussed in light of the accumulated data of the entire study.      As for
the second, its issues will be dealt with in the following pages.

While stringent laws whose dictates restrict the degree of status
group interaction permitted in conventional social situations have long
been important factors in the determination of patterns of social
intercourse in the Indian village, there are two areas of life where
these injunctions have tended to break down.      The first is related to
a villager's conduct outside of his village, and the second is associated
with purely 'religious' activities.

In Hinduism the primary function of dharma (proper action) is to
maintain a given social order.      The basic unit of this social order has
traditionally been the village and to some extent its surroQ~ding region. 33
Rules of conduct, therefore, are primarily directed towards the perpetuation
of a given set of values within one's conventional social milieu;      outside
of this context such rules are not as binding.      For example, Mathur found
that:

> The general and popular view is that the actions of
> a person in a socio-cultural context ;rhich is not
> his own are not to be considered his normal social
> actions, and that, therefore, he is not judged on the
> basis of the former. Hhat he does in the city is no
> business of his caste community in the village,so
> long as his actions do not infringe the soLidarity
> of the social groups to which he belongs.34

Consequently, there is a distinct difference made between one's dharma in
conventional life and one's activities outside of that milieu.      A similar
distinction applies to what might be termed purely 'religious' activity.
For example, rules of dharma are not binding on religious ascetics who have
renounced the world, as they are not seen to be members of conventional

society.        This same type of attitude has also been applied to devotional
(bhakti) sects. 35     Hi thin the framework of a sect's devotional activities
traditional rules of dbarma are often suspended.         For example, as many
sects have been anti-caste in outlook their devotees (from different caste
backgrounds) have joined together in various forms of devotional activity

such as sharing ritually consecrated food.          However, outside of such
activities, that is, within the context of' conventional society, traditional
rules of dbanna prevail. 3 7

The path that the Baha'f Administrative Order has travelled in terms
of introducing the social teachings of the Faith to new declarants in
Malwa has been one that has taken advantage of the above mentioned
categories of' behavior.      To this date Bah a 1 f teachers have not made an
attempt to change the conventional life patterns of new oelievers but have
directed their efforts towards inducing village declarants to adopt Baha'f
modes of behavior within the context of' Baha'f activities,        These
activities are essentially two in kind:       those 'rhich take place outside
the local community;      and those which function within the village.

35 As mentioned in Chapter 7, bhru<ti means devotion to a personal god.

In Chapter 6 mention was made of the Indore Tceaching Institute and
the role it plays as a channel of communication bet-,;een local village
communi ties in Halwa and the institutions of the Baha' :L Faith's
administrative order.        Here it was noted that one of the primary functions
of' the Institute is to educate new believers by exposing them to Baha''L
social principles in action.        This is also true of Baha'i seasonal
schools and regional conferences (see Chapter ll), and conseg_uently in the
operating procedures of all three of these institutions there are no
distinctions made on the basis of caste lines;        all participants are
considered eg_ual and are treated accordingly.        For example, there are no
facilities for separate diningr

Br~~s, and the food is prepared by several hands.            Similarly, attending
members share rooms on a mixed caste basis. 39

In addition to eating, sleeping, and working together, participants
are shown at these sessions how- Baha' 0: social principles should be applied
within the frame>wrk of the movement's socio-religious institutions.          For

example, during the nine-day 'deepening' session held in December of 1973
a special Unity Feast

41   was celebrated at which institute teachers spoke of
the brotherhood of all Baha'is and stressed the necessity of all Baha'f

38 At the sessions observed by the author the eating arrilllgements were as

39 Often village participants share one large room, and thus Brahmans and

Raj puts are housed in the same area as Balais and Chamars.

feasts and ceremonies reflecting the ideal of the one:ncss of manl:ind.
During the feast villagers from both 'clean 1 and 'unclean 1 caste

backgrounds prayed, sang, and ate together.        At the same session mock
local spiritual assemblies were elected, and the Balla' 1 method of

.            .              . .     43
consultatlon was explalned and exernpllfled.

By providing such activities outside of the conventional village
setting the llaha':L Administrative Order has enabled many declarants to
experience new modes of' social behavior without en<lan{};ering the:ir   po~;itions

in traditional society. Thus, one of the main means of introducing Bah a 1 1
social ideals into the rural communi ties has been to educate a number of
key believers in a non-conventional milieu and then instruct them to help
their fellow declarants in the application of these ideals within the
context of Baha'i socio-religious institutions, such as feasts, holy day
observances, and assenibly meetings.    In this way, the Balla'{ Faith is not
put in the position of having to directly confront the     r~gidity   of the
traditional system.

In the villages themselves, moreover, Bahatl social principles are
exemplified only within a Balla' 1 frame of reference.    Baha' 1 administrators
and teachers have not interfered with the standardized patterns of status
group interaction, but have tried to concentrate on establishing the

movement as a distinct religous phenomenon.        In this sense, the Faith

~c
might be greuped in the same category as the aforementioned bhakti      J   sects
whose activities have often transcended conventional norms.     Conseq_uently,
while village teachers espouse Baha'i social principles they seldom break
the traditional rules of dharma in a conventional setting.      For example,
the travelling teacher in Richa told me that he often shares food with
a fellow Baha'i of Muslim background, but he only does so in situations
vhich are beyond the pale of conventional social interaction.

In looking at the 'model village' communities then, it car1 be assumed
that the only situations in which one can expect to find any type of change
in the traditional patterns of status group interaction will be within the
framework of Baha'i institutions, and even then, change will only be
partial, as the approach of the Baha' 'l Administrative Order has not been
to force immediate change but rather to create frames of reference
vithin which alternative modes of behavior can be introduced and nurtured
to fruition.

The application of Balla' 1 social principles in the context of the
'model village' communities can be divided into tvo basic categories;        the
breakdown of interdictions regarding spacial isolation;    and the
inhancement of eq_ual participation in group activities.     \Vi thin the

2)1;.

fra.me•mrk of the movement 1 s devotional, ceremonial, administrative, and
educational institutions attempts are being made to reduce the traditional
taboos surrounding these categories of behavior, and in the following

.     lf7
paragraphs a few instances of their results will be clted.

As was pointed out at the beginning of this chapter, traditional
patterns of status group interaction have been characterized by the

lack of        clean 1   ,   'unclean', and 'untouchable 1   ,   caste intercourse, and
consequently at village communal gatherings the latter have had to abide
by designated laws of spacial isolation.                Using this spacial taboo as an
index of caste exclusiveness, it would appear that in the 'model village'
communities under examination restrictions regarding inter-caste contact
are not as stringent as they are in more conventional spheres of village
life.      For example, in village Richa Balai and Chamar declarants are not
isolated from the remainder of the group during feasts.                    'tlhile they
generally sit next to each other they are in no way marked off as being
separate.         In fact, they often sit in close proximity to 'high' caste

and Rajputs. 48             But perhaps an even more significant event in this
regard was a Chamar's entering a Rajput household to participate in a
meeting of the communities Local Spiritual Assembly, for, as we have
already seen, llathur found in his village that 'untouchables ' were not
allowed to enter the houses of 'clean' castemen.                    On this occasion (see
Chapter 10) the Cha.mar not only entered the house but took his place among
other 'clean' caste members and participated •fi thout any sign of

There are also signs in village Kasod that spatial isolation in Baha'i
activities is less apparent than in conventional situations.             Both Balai
and Chamar castemen attend community meetings and are permitted to sit on
the headman's veranda (where such occasions usually take place), a
situation which is in marked contrast to traditional devotional and
ceremonial activity in Kasod          where each caste has its own shrines whose
locations are far removed from 'clean' caste temples.           ~-:oreover ~   the

Additional examples of the breakdown of traditional concepts of
spatial isolation in the 'model village' communities include the following:
in Hanas a a Chamar has been elected to the community's Local Spiritual
Assembly (although the community is dominated by Raj puts) and sits with
eight Rajputs during assembly meetings;           in Garabeli, where the Baha'i
community is dominated by 'unclean' Balais, there are several 'clean'
castemen who also take active part in community activities; and in all
three communities in which Baha'i primary schools have been established
(Karankani, Hanasa, and Kasod) children from 'unclean' and 'untouchable'
castes sit in the same line as 'clean' caste children and take their
respective turns reciting prayers and reading lessons.           :Moreover, in both
Richa and I;:iisod teachers reported that during feasts, food was often shared
by all participants including both 'unclean' and 'untoue;nable' caste

members.

Regarding equal participation between 'clean', 'unclean', and
'untouchable' declarants in community activities, advances are not as
noticeable.     By and large, those who are most active or most vocal in the
five 'model villages' are members of 'clean' castes.                 There are, however,
exceptions to this rule, the most obvious one being Garabel~where all of
the members of the local administrative body are members of the Balai
cas t e. 52 However, ~n
. theo tl1er   Vl'11 ages    h

I un~ouc   h abl e I
declarants are in a minority, active participation by members of these
status groups is limited to specific individuals, as on the <rhole, 'low'
castemen are still hesitant to participate on an equal basis.                    Consequently,
although in Kasod there are eight male Chamar declarants and five male
Balai believers, only one of these individuals (the Bru1a'f teacher) is
outspoken enough to participate in community discussion without any degree
of reservation.    For example, during a community meeting at which the
question arose of building a   B~a'f      bhavan, he was the only 'unclean'
casteman to enter the discussion.         Otherwise, the main flow of conversation
was dominated by Rajput and Brahman declarants.                The same situation exists
in Richa where the one Chamar who has been elected to the village's Local
Spiritual Assembly is the only 'low' casteman in the community who can be
said to play anything but a passive role in         B~a'f       activities.          Moreover,
Baha' :l activities in Kararikani are almost exclusively the domain of 'clean'
caste declarants, all administrative positions being held by members from
this stratum of society.

51 The author only witnessed one such sharing of food L, the 'model village 1

52 There are many such 'low' caste B~a':L communities in Halwa, several of
which are 'model villages'.

In summary, it appears that in the five communities some change is
beginning to occur in the patterns of status group interaction, but that
it is limited to particular frames of reference and is primarily concerned
with the breakdown of traditional concepts of spacial isolation.
Consequently, while all of the declarants in the five communities have
proclaimed their belief in the oneness of mankind, they do not marry
outside of their own castes, nor do they break traditional rules of
comrnensality in conventional social situations.    Furthermore, although
'low' caste believers are allowed to participate in Baha' 1 activities
without the stigma of spacial isolation being applied to them, in most
cases members of these status groups assume their traditional roles of
being good listeners.   Yet, the fact that Baha'i functions in the 'model
village' communities are free from the blatant acts of social descrimination
that often characterize relationships between 'high' and 'low' caste
members is seen by the Baha'i Administrative Order to be a positive step
forward, and if nurtured it may lead to more constant and significant
changes in the field of human relations.    However, in this regard Baha' :L
ad.'llinistrators hold no grandiose ideals of revitalizing the conventional
social system.   The central aim of the Baha' 1 Faith in introducing its
values and institutions into Indian villages is not to reform society but
to build from the base level a new world social order vhose institutions
will reflect the ideals and teachings of Baha'u'llah.     They see the old
world order as moribund and being on the verge of colla" se;     the salvation
of mankind depends on a new civilization.    Shoghi Effendi summarized this
view in the following words:

humanity, purged from its dross, can attain its destiny.

Consequently, the Baha'f Administrative Order in India is not concerned
with altering life patterns in the context of the conventional social
order but in establishing frames of reference in which new social ideals
can grow and.develop.     At the present time it is still in the process of
building these institutions in Nalwa, but in many of the 'model villages'
they have already come to represent, at least in word if not always in
deed, the ideal of human equality.

Chapter 10     Local Administration

Several times during the course of this study it has been mentioned
that as an international movement the Baha'f Faith is not only involved
in converting people to its teachings; it is also attempting to introduce
in various countries throughout the world socio-religious institutions
whose modes of operation have been formulated and developed by its founders
and their duly appointed successors.       These institutions are part of an
internationally linl<ed superstructure whose present form is seen to be the
embryonic state of a future world social order, referred to in Baha'i
literature as the \1orld Order of Baha' u' llah.      The prime goal of the
movement is to construct this new order, and its teaching and consolidation
activities both in rural Halwa and in numerous countries t..roughout the
world are part of the building process.       Shoghi Effendi referred to
the goal when he wrote:

> Conscious of their high calling, confident
> in the society-building power which their
> Faith possesses, they press forward,
> undeterred and undismayed, in their efforts
> to fashion and perfect the necessary
> instruments wherein the embryonic llorld Order
> of Baha'u'llah can mature and develop. It
> is this building process, slow and
> unobtrusive, to which the life of the world-
> wide Baha'f Community is wholly consecrated,
that constitutes the one hope of a stricken

society.l
In the process of establishing the World Order of Bahi'i' u' llah, the
Baha':l Faith has developed a system of administrative institutions whose
primary functions are to both guide and direct the movement's teaching and
consolidation programs    and administer to the general needs of believers.
1 shoghi Effendi, The \lorld Order of Baha 'u' lliih, p. 195

As was shm.rn in Chapter 5, the administrative institutions are
organized on three levels:   international, national, and local.       As
the first two have been discussed in Part II of the study, the present
Chapter will be primarily concerned 1lith local administrative procedures.

The fundamental local administrative institution in the Baha'i
Faith is the Local Spiritual Assembly.     Like other administrative
institutions within the Faith, its establishment vas orda'ned by
Baba'u'llah:

> The Lord hath ordained that in every
> city a House of Justice be established
> vherein shall gather the counsellors to
> the number of Baha (9) ... It is incumbent
> upon them to take counsel together and to
> have regard for the interests of the servants
> of God, for His sake, even as they regard
> their o1m interests, and to choose that
> ><hich is meet and seemly.    Thus hath the
> Lord your God commanded you.2

Baha'is hold this formulation to be particularly significant.      In fact,
Shoghi Effendi emphasized that the po><er not only of the Local Spiritual
Assembly, but of the entire administrative order >ras due to its divine
formulation:

> It should be noted in this connection that
> this Administrative Order is fundamentally
> different from anything that any Prophet
> has previously established, inasmuch as
> Baha'u'lliih has Himself revealed its
> principles, established its institutions,
> appointed the person to interpret His \lord
> and conferred the necessary authority on the
> body designed to supplement and apply His
> legislative ordinances.3
The duties of the Local Spiritual Assembly can be divided into t>ro
main categories.   First, it is meant to act as a stimulating agent for
the promotion and organization of teaching and consolidation activities
2 Quoted in Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration, (vlilmctte, Illinois,

1968), p. 21
3 Shoghi Effendi, The Horld Order of' Baha'u'llah, p. 145
on the local level.4    Accordingly, the Local Spiritual Assembly should

.•. consecrate   a certain part of its
> time, at each of its sessions, to the
> earnest and prayerful consideration of
> such >rays and means to foster the campaign
> of teaching, or may furnish whatever
> resources are available for its progress,
> extension, and consolidation.5

Consequently, at this stage in the development of the Baha'l Faith one
of the primary responsibilities of the Local Spiritual Assembly is to
see that within the city or hamlet in which it is operating, the doctrines
of the movement are both spread to those who have not heard them,and
strengthened in the minds of those who have accepted.     Second, the
body is meant to consult on affairs pertaining to the life of the local
community. 6   For example, if there is a dispute between two members
of the community, the Local Spiritual Assembly acts as a court of
arbitration, helping the parties to reconcile their differences.
As Shoghi Effendi pointed out, 'They must endeavour to promote amity
and concord amongst the Friends, efface every lingering trace of distrust,
coolness, and estrangement from every heart, and secure in its stead an
active and wholehearted co-operation for the service of the Cause. ,7

In keeping with the Baha'f ideal of equality among the faithfUl,
members of the Local Spiritual Assembly are elevated to their positions
by means of a democratic election.     Each year on the first day of Hj dv§p

\[11\] Those members not attending the meeting have the right to send their

become the   members of the Local Spiritual Assembly. 12     The believer who
receives the most votes then calls the new members together, and assembly
officers are selected.    Each assembly should elect a chairman, a vice-
chairman, a secretary, and a treasurer. 1 3   \fuen the body has selected
its officers it should report the results to the National Spiritual
Assembly.

In performing their duties members of the Local Spiritual Assembly
have certain responsibilities to the body of believers.        \Tnile they are
not 'responsible' for their acts in the way this term is understood in
contemporary parliamentary systems, they are pledged at all times to
promote the best interest of the community.     Thus, although assembly
members are directed to base their decisions on nothing but the admonitions
of thelr          •    ~ they are nevertheless

Consequently, as was pointed out in Chapter 9, the function of local
administrators is not to dictate, but consult,both among themselves          and
with members of the community at large. 1 6

There are no prescribed times when assembly meetings should be held,
although in large communities they are generally called at least once a
week.        A meeting can only take place when all members have been notified
of its time and location, but five persons at any given session constitute
a quorum, and a majority vote of those present is sufficient for conducting
business. 1 7      All meetings should be opened with a prayer, which is
generally followed by the reading of the minutes of the previous meeting
and by discussion of reports submitted by any of the body's duly appointed
committees. 18       After committee reports have been presented old and new
business is discussed, and upon conclusion of consultation the meeting is
closed with a prayer.        All sessions should be conducted in an atmosphere
of prayer, love, and harmony:

> They must when coming together turn
> their faces to the Kingdom on High and
> ask aid from the Realm of Glory. They
> must then proceed with the utmost devotion,
> courtesy, dignity, care and moderation to
> express their views.l9
The various aspects of assembly interaction are guided by the
principle of Baha'f consultation, according to which, every member of
the group has the right to express his or her views with absolute freedom.20
1 7 By-Laws of a Local Spiritual Assembly, Article VIII, SP.ction 1
18 The Local Spiritual Assembly has the authority to appoint committees,

> composed of members of the community and chaired by one of its own
> members, whose functions are to organize and co-ordinate specific
> activities within the community. For example, in a local cow~unity
> there might be committees responsible for propagation activities,
> 'deepening' programs, and child education.

19 The Baha'f Community, p. 10-11

Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the

> principle of the undoubted right of the individual to self-expression,
> his freedom to declare his conscience and set forth his views. Y (Shoghi
Effendi, in Principles of Baha'i Administration, p. 44)
When expressing their ideas, however, members are supposed to remember
that their purpose is community service.         In the words of Shoghi Effendi:

> They should approach their task with
> extreme humility, and endeavour, by
> their ope~~ndedness, their high sense
> of justice and duty, their candour, their
> modesty, their entire devotion to the
> welfare and interests of the Friends, the
> Cause, and humanity, to win, not only the
> confidence and the genuine support and
> respect of those whom they serve but also
> their esteem and real affection. 21
After all opinions have been voiced and thoroughly and impassionately
dis~ussed,    a vote is called.      A majority vote constitutes a verdict,.
and once arrived at     becomes the decision of the entire body.        'There is
no minority opinion in Baha'f Administration;          the decision of the majority
is the decision of all. t22       Moreover, the judgement must be accepted by
every believer in the community;        no one should criticize or act contrary
to the decision, as this would cause disruption and antagonism within the
community. 2 3

Part of the Local Spiritual Assembly 1 s con s..tltati ve responsibility
is to consider recommendations presented to it by the corrrnunity.         The
occasion for the formulation of community suggestions is the business
portion of the Nineteen-Day Feast.         During this time individual believers
can make recorrrnendations concerning any matter related to the Faith.
However, 'Such recommendations must be adopted by majority vote of the
community members present before constituting a resolution to be

considered by the local Spiritual Assembly. •           This mes·,s that all

recommendations must be openly aired, there being no room within the

Like assembly meetings, community discussion is governed by the rules
of Baha'i consultation.        Under the guidance of the Chairman of the Local
Spiritual Assembly every member of the community is allowed, if so desired,
to express an opinion.        After consultation the members are polled.    If
a suggestion is adopted, the Local Spiritual Assembly must consider it at
their next meeting and report their decision to the community at a future
feast.

It is also at the Nineteen-Day Feast that the Local Spiritual Assembly
performs its communicative functions.         On the one hand, it serves as a
channel through which individual believers can make suggestions to the
National Spiritual Assembly;        if a recommendation is passed by the
community, the Local Spiritual Assembly may in its discretion forward it to

the national body.          Conversely, the Local Spiritual Assembly provides a
means by which the higher administrative institutions can communicate with
individual believers.         At each feast the group's secretarJ relays to the
community any communications or directives * sent by the National Spiritual

Assembly and its appointed committees.         This contact is a vital link
in the chain of communication that binds Baha'i communities throughout
the world.        As a Baha'i administrative manual states:

Another administrative process involving the participation of members
of local communities is the selection of delegates to act as electors
of the National Spiritual Assembly.29 In every country where there exists
a national administrative body, delegates, whose number and apportiorunent
are determined by Baha'i population patterns, are annually selected by
means of democratic election to attend the National Convention.          The
method of electing delegates varies according to country.          In countries
where the Baha'i population is small, delegates are often selected in
local communities, each cormnunity being assigned a specific number of
delegate seats according to its relative size.          In coun+:ies like India
where the Baha'i population is comparatively large, delegate positions
are allocated on the basis of population density, a specific geographical
area receiving a fixed munher of seats.          Consequently, in such countries
delegates are selected at annual district conventions, an institution
which will be examined in more detail later in this chapter.
Once delegates are chosen they have the right to attend the National
Convention in the capacity of electors of the National Spiritual Assembly.
28 The Baha'i Community, p. 18
29   1 It     is expressly recorded in 1 Abdu '1-Baha' s Hri tings that these

3° In India this convention is held in Ne\f Delhi during the last >leek of April.

:'613

If a duly elected delegate cannot attend the gathering in person, he is
able to send his ballot by post or messenger, and it will be cow1ted with
the votes cast by attending delegates on election day.      A delegate, however,
is encouraged to attend the session.      According to the Faith's Guardian:

> workers on his return with the accomplishments,
> the decisions, and the aspirations of the
> assembled representatives of the believers. 31
The purpose of the National Convention is twofold.       First, as already
mentioned, it provides the opportunity for the election of the National
Spiritual Assembly.      As with other Baha'f elections there is no
electioneering or nominating of candidates.        Rather, after the reading of

he is free to choose from among all the officially delared Baha'is within
the national community.     After tabulation the nine believers who receive
the highest number of votes become the members of the National Spiritual
Assembly for the year.      In case of a tie for ninth posit.ion, a second
ballot is cast by those delegates in attendance.        The meeting's second
function is to provide a forum where (as representatives of local believers)
the delegates can consult with the new National Spiritual Assembly. 33         At
this time the opinions and sentiments of the delegates can be expressed
31 Principles of Baha' '[ Administration, p. 6 5
32 ' ... the elector ••• is called to vote for none but those whom prayer and

' ••• should familiarize the delegates with the various matters that will

34 Hence,
the National Convention allows for direct consultation between the local
and national levels of Baha'i administration and is therefore an
important appendage to the administrative activities of a local community.

In order that the reader might better understand the factors influencing
the implementation of Baha'i administrative institutions in rural l1alwa
it would be helpful before citing specific examples to say a few words
concerning the structure of contemporary village administrative institutions.
For our purpose it will not be necessary to examine these institutions in
detail.      Rather, it will be sufficient to make note of their essential
characteristics.

Within the contemporary village there are two types of leadership
positions:     the traditional institutions of the village headman and caste
councils, and the relatively modern Village Committee (pailcayat).

The office of the village headman is a hereditary position.                 In the
past it ~<as the primary position of authority in the village. 35             Most large
villages in Malwa have    t~<o   headmen, while smaller communities are under
the guidance of a single individual, generally a member of a 'clean' caste,
and very often a Rajput.         Before the introduction of the Village Committee
headmen were solely responsible for dispensing civil justice.                 Since they
were the government's official representatives, they          ~<ere   relegated the
responsibilities of maintaining       la~<   and order and collecting tax revenue.

34 Shoghi Effendi, in Princi nles of Baha' 1 Administration, p. 62
35 For a more detailed account of the role of a village headman in l,Jalwa
see Adrian Hayer, p. 93-113.

In addition, they also acted as spokesmen for their villages in legal
disputes.      For example, Adrian Mayer found that in the past Ramkheri
headmen had defended the interests of the village in land disputes by

.                f                    . .      36     Outside of their official
enlist~ng    the help o       government   off~c~als.

duties, headmen also play leading roles in both secular and religious spheres
of village life, often arbitrating inter-caste disputes or performing
specific services at village festivals.
The other traditional position of authority in the contemporary village
is the caste council.           Each caste has its own leaders whose primary functions
are to settle disputes within their respective status groups and dispense
punishment to those members who violate                      rules and mores.      The members
of these councils are generally                  elders who have had their positions
of authority bestowed upon them as a           resul~   of their age or the prestige

communities
they hold within their respective                       rJoreover, like the village
headman, their authority within a given area of jurisdiction has in the
past been unquestionable.           Consequently, traditional positions of leadership
have tended to be controlled by dominant individuals who have claimed
authority on the basis of either heredity or personal prestige.

With the introduction in the 1940's of democratic ideals on the local
level, a new institution of leadership arose within Nalila villages.                  This
was the Village Committee, or gram paiicayat.                  In reality the institution
is more often an area co:nnnittee than a village committee, for several
villages may come under the jurisdiction of one pai1cayat.                  Unlike
traditional positions of authority, membership on a ~ficavat                    is determined
by democratic election, and therefore theoretically all members of the

village have an equal say in selecting their representatives.                      Furthermore

\[36\] !·layer, p. 95
37 The election of paiicayat members generally takes place at a village -

> by a show of hands.
*rn reality these are sub-caste councils.

a committee's decision is not absolute;         appeals to higher administrative
institutions can be made (district committees).

' -
As one might imagine, the powers of the pa:ncayat_        and those of the
village patel have often come into conflict.           Originally   a couunittee
lacked the the power to collect taxes, but by the 1950's in many instances
it had assumed this right.          In 1955 Adrian Mayer found that'The present
policy seems to be to give it (Yillage Committe~ all the powers formerly
held by the headman.    1   38                                     -

However, while the powers of pa:lcayats. have
increased, in many of the smaller villages of the region,such as Hicha,
Manas a, Kararikani, and Kasod, the headman still plays an im,oortant role in
village leadership.          In all four villages be was involved in the collection
of taxes and the settling of disputes, and was generally regarded as the
most influential individual in the community.

From our point of view, however, the relative powers of village
administrative institutions are per se not important.          Interest in them
arises only in terms of the influence they have on both the introduction
and subse~uent functioning of Baha'! administrative institutions.           For
example, the importance of the Village Committee with its democratic features
of popular election and right of appeal lies in the similarities it shares
with certain Baha'i procedures.          As a result of its existence, the introduction
of Baha'i administrative institutions bas not been handicapped to any great
degree by villagers' lack of l.Ulderstanding of democratic procedures;        when
Baha'i teachers speak of elected assembly members, new declarants have a
basis in reality with which they can identify, for although many of the
principles in Baha'1 adminstration are different from those that characterize
political processes in Malwa villages, the fundamental ideal of one man one
vote is akin.       Similarly, traditional institutions cast their influence on
Bah&'l procedures.          As will be shown in following pages, customary patterns

of village leadership are still manifestly expressing themselves within
the framework of Baha'i administrative institutions.

Baha'i leadership in India has placed much importance on the
establishment and development of the Faith's administrative institutions
in the village communities in galwa, as they are the foundation on which
the Baha'i Administrative Order is trying to build the Vlorld Order of

In this regard it is believed that local spiritual assemblies
will eventually evolve into local houses of justice, the cornerstones of
local administration in the new world social order.         As Shoghi Effendi
stated:    ''l'hat the Spiritual Assemblies of today will be replaced in time
by the Houses of Justice, and are to a'll intents and purposes identical and
not separate bodies, is abundantly confirmed by    1

Abdu 1 1-Baha Himself! 39

Consequently, much of the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee's limited
manpm;er and resources is directed towards the establishment and maintenance
of local administrative institutions.     In carrying out this work they are
following the advice of the Universal House of Justice which in a letter
dated February 15, 1968, stated:

> In all your training programmes, the Baha'i
> Administration should have special attention.
> The believers should know that our administration

Every year on April 21, the 2,356 communities in Halwa in which nine
or more Baha'is reside must elect their local spiritual assemblies for the
year, and it is the responsibility of the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee

\[40\] 'Letter written to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of
India, February 15, 1968', Arise to Serve, p. 122

to help direct the procedure.    Consequently, during the entire month of
April, all of the Committee's travelling teachers take to the field for
the purpose of contacting as many   corr~unities   as possible and reminding
them of their responsibility to bold elections on the prescribed day.
Moreover, instructions regarding the election are sent to the villages.
For example, in the Bahai Darsan of March, 1974, directions concerning
the proper method of forming a local spiritual assembly were outlined.         The
following paragraph was taken from that issue:

> The members of the Local Spiritual Assembly
> are the nine Baha 1 1s who in each community
> on election day receive the most votes.
> After the election it is their duty to gather
> together and hold a meeting. From among the
> nine chosen, the one who receives the most
> votes becomes the temporary chairman, and as
> soon as possible he must call the first assembly
> meeting. It is necessary to begin this meeting
> with a prayer and to ask God's help in promoting
> the progress of the Cause. After the prayer
> it is necessary for them to select the assembly
> officers for the year. Each assembly must have
> a chairman, secretary, vice-chairman, and
> treasurer. The work of the chairman is to direct
> the meetings and to help the assembly in arriving
> at their decisions. If the members only come
> together to talk and then disperse, their meeting
> will have no benefit.41
When travelling teachers contact the village declarants they once again
explain the proper election procedures and emphasize the importance of
approaching the event in a prayerful attitude.        In addition, they request
assembly members to inform the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee of the
outcome of the election.     In the 'model villages' elections are often
supervised by travelling teachers or 'deepened' Balla' 1s.     FollOI<ing prayers,
pieces of paper are distributed among the believers who are then asked to
><rite the names of none fellow village Balla' 1s whom they feel would best
serve the community.    Those who cannot write are asked to relate their

\[41\] Bahai Darsan, March 29, 1974, p. 2
choices to the election supervisors who in turn enter the verbal vote on
a piece of paper and place it among the other ballots.               At the conclusion
of the election, votes are tabulated and results announced.               Officers are
then elected and their names sent to the Regional          ~'eaching   Committee which
in turn sends them to the national office in New Delhi.

The Regional Teaching Committee also directs and supervises the
election of convention delegates.         As mentioned earlier, delegate positions
are apportioned on the basis of Baha'i population.               In India there are a
total of 171 delegate positions, each delegate representing 2,350 believers.
Every state within the Indian Union receives at least one delegate position
regardless of the number of Baha'1s residing in its territory, while the
remaining. positions are distributed according to Baha'f population density.
Malwa has been assigned fifty-three seats, an indication that close to
one-third of the declared Baha'fs in India reside in this region.              The
number of delegate positions in    l~alwa      are listed below according to district.

In Ma.lwa the occasions for electing convention delegates are referred
to as unit elections.      To facilitate the selection process the National

\[42\] The districts of Sehore, Bas tar, Jabalpur, and Jh-abua o,lso come under
jurisdiction of the Ujjain Regional 'I'eaching Conrrnittee.

Spiritual Assembly has divided the region into eighteen sections, each of
which has .its own unit election.       In some cases a unit indicates a Baha'l
population of   2~00    declarants, while in other instances it represents a
population of 7,500 believers.        In the former units one delegate is
selected, and in the latter three are chosen.         In mid-February a special
election is held in a l'ey village 1lithin each unit, the various Baha' 1
communities in each unit having been informed prior to the gathering of
its time and location.        The entire process of electing convention delegates
lasts eighteen days, one unit convention being held        each day between
February 11, and February 28.

So as to provide complete fairness in the selection of delegates, the
elections are supervised by Baha'is who do not live \Jithin the Ul1it in
g_uestion.   They      are often members of the Ujjain Regional 'I'eaching Committee
or members of consolidation teams (see Chapter 6).         In addition, in last
year's election (1974) election sites \Jere visited by the region's Auxiliary
Board member.

At each Ul1it election supervisors open the meeting \lith prayers and
instruct the assembled declarants in the manner and method by "hich Baha' 1
elections are to be implemented.        These instructions include a review of
the essential procedures foUl1d in all Baha'1 elections as "ell as specific
directives concerning the election of unit delegates, "hich in the case of
a Ul1it representing 2,500 believers involves the "riting down of a name
of one person residing in the Ul1it whom the voter feels would make a good
delegate, and in the case of a unit representing 7,500 declarants.means the
selection of three such individuals.        Pieces of paper are then distributed,
and the election takes place.        As in assembly elections, those who cannot
write are directed to indicate their choices to an election supervisor.
After all participants have cast their ballots the election supervisors
tabulate the votes, and the individual ( s) \ii th the highest number of votes

(generally an auxiliary board member) who in turn forwards it to the national
office vhere it vill be colUlted along with the ballots of attending delegates
on the day of the election meeting.

According to members of the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee,
attendance at unit elections is generally lou;             one hundred and fifty
declarants would be considered a sizeable number for such a gathering.
For example, in the unit election held in village Harod (Ratlarn district)
the elected delegate received 84 out of 133 votes cast.              The lack of
attendance is no doubt partly due to the fact that villagers must travel
a fair distance to the election site, but it is also an            ~ndication   that
active involvement in Baha'f institutions is still limited to a minority
of declarants.

The Baha'1 Administrative Order in India is not only concerned that
assembly members and delegates be properly elected             but that local
institutions begin to function as viable commm1ity entities.             In this vein
the Universal House of Justice told the Indian National Spiritual Assembly
that 'The Spiritual Assembly should be regarded as the pivot of the activities

reiterating the feelings of Shoghi Effendi who had earlier remarked that

\[1\] \{ithout the study and application of the administration the teaching of
the Cause becomes not only meaningless, but loses in        eff~ctiveness   and
scope. • 47

In attempting to nurture local administrative institutions the
Administrative Order relies heavily on its two channels of commnnication
that provide new declarants with direct human contact, namely, teaching
institutes and travelling teachers.          As with other Baha'i consolidation
activities, an attempt has been made to educate a few key believers.          This
policy is reflected in the following message sent by the National Spiritual
Assembly to its teaching committees in April of 1971.

> Throughout the year your committee must
> concentrate on training at least the
> Secretary and Chairman or any two members
> of each Local Spiritual Assembly of your
> region, inviting them in teaching and
> deepening courses, asking the travelling
> teachers to conduct one or two day deepening
> lessons in the places where there are Local
> Spiritual Assemblies.48
Of   th~   two sources of contact, travelling teachers are the more
effective.          \{hile teaching institutes present occasions when villagers
can receive personal instruction concerning the funda.'!lentals of Baha ':L
administration, they are weakened by the fact that they do not operate in
an environment similar to the one in which administrative institutions
must fnnction.          Travelling teachers, on the other hand, can give instruction
in the villages, and hence their lessons are more meaningful.           Even with
the use of such educational channels, however, the administrative
institutions in many villages often lie dormant.          This is mainly due to the
previously mentioned lack of funds and trained manpower which prevents many
villages from receiving personal contact.         Until the Administrative Order can

increase its resources and manpower, in Malwa it is concentrating on trying
to develop local administrative institutions in the 'model villages'.
However, judging from observations and information supplied by village
teachers it would seem that even in the 'model village' communities Baha 'f
administrative institutions are still in the initial stages of development;
that is, while they are functioning they do not always follow the prescribed
procedures outlined earlier in this chapter.    'rhe attitude of the
Administrative Order, however, is characterized by patience and forbearance.
From Ha'lds of the Cause to teaching committee members, Baha '1 administrators
realize that change in the Indian village where the influence of tradition
is still strong will of necessity be a slow process, and conseQuently they
have refrained from demanding 'letter of the law' observance, preferring
to allow for gradual maturation.    In this regard they are following the
advice of the Guardian who concerning the approach to be taken towards new
believers said:

> Let him refrain, at the outset, from insisting
> on such laws and observances as might impose
> too severe a strain on the new seeker's newly-
> awalcened faith, and endeavor to nurse him,
> patiently, tactfully, and yet determinedly,
> into full maturity, and aid him to proclaim
> his unqualified acceptance o:t' whatever has
> been ordained by Baha'u'llah •.• Let him not be
> content until he has infused into his spiritual
> child so deep a longing as to impel him to arise
> independently, in his turn, and devote his
> energies to the QUickening of other souls, and
> the upholding of the la1<s and principles laid
> down by his newly-adopted Faith.49
All five of the 'model villages' examined in this study have duly
elected local spiritual assemblies functioning within their confines.     For
the Baha '1 year 1913-1914 50 the membership of each assembly according

As can be seen from the above figures, all of the local spiritual
assemblies except for Garabeli,11hich is primarily a lo11 caste community,
are dominated by 'clean' caste members, and then mainly Rajputs.                  Moreover,
in three of the communities the village headman is a member of the assembly
(Kasod, Manas a, and Kararikani ), and in Garabeli several Bal'iii caste leaders
have been elected.        Consequently, the composition of the assemblies in
these villages seems to reflect traditional leadership patterns.

According to village teachers, assembly meetings in the communities
are not al11ays held on a regular basis;            they are called 1<hen there is
a need to discuss a specific problem.              Furthermore, the assemblies only
consult on matters related to Baha'i activities;             they do not interfere
1<ith the jurisdiction of village administrative institutions.                 Here again
one can see the effects of the Baha 1 1 policy of by-passing the 'old order'.
Accordingly, Baha'i administration is completely removed from political
affairs.      In fact, Shoghi Effendi forbid          such incursion.       He never
ceased to    r~mind   the believers that the religion of Baha'u'llah demanded
allegiance to one's government:

> And this principle is no other than
> that which involves the non-participation
> by the adherents of the Faith of
> Balla' u 'lliih, whether in their individual
> capacities or collectively as local or
> national Assemblies, in any form of
> activity that might be interpreted,
> either directly or indirectly, as an
> interference in the political affairs of
> ru1y particular government.5l
Consequently, the main issues discussed at village assem-bly meetings are
those which are related to Baha'1 teaching and educational activities and
the collection and use of Baha'i funds.        There have been occasions in

the past (although not in these particular villages) when local assemblies
have had to discuss individual breaches of faith.           For example, I was
told that in one village a specific declarrult absconded with funds, and
that the matter having been discussed by the assembly was forwarded to
the National Spiritual Assembly for further consultation.           Such instances,
however, are rare, and therefore the primary function of local spiritual
assemblies in the 'model villages' is to consult on matters concerning
corr~unity   teaching and education.

On the evening of March 12, 19'74, the Local Spiritual Assembly of
Karankanimet to discuss problems relating to the condition of the village's
Baha'i primary school.       The meeting was held in the home of the resident
Baha'i school teacher who although not a member of the body is generally
present at Baha'i functions in the village as he is the main link between
the community and the Ujjain Regional Teaching Comnittee,          In addition,
being the headmaster of the school his presence at the meeting was
considered important.      Eight other persons >rere in attendance, one
member being out of station.       The meeting >ras opened with a prayer, after

Spiritual Assembly for building repairs, it would not ask for any further
assistance at this time, but the school teacher agreed to see if he could
obtain more books from the Regional Teaching Committee office in Ujjain.
The meeting was then closed with a prayer.

It seems apparent from the preceding account that the session was
not an example of an ideal assembly meeting.      In the first place, a non-
assembly member (the school teacher) was one of the most active participants
in the consultation.     Furthermore, no records were kept, nor ;ras the
proper method of voting adhered to.      Of greater significance is the
fact that the true spirit of Baha'i consultation was not present;     the
discussion was controlled by three persons.     \fuile other members were
present, they were not queried as to their own opinions, and although all
of them were members of 'clean' castes, they seemed to bow to the
authority of their superiors, a sign that traditional leadership roles
are still influential in Baha'f administrative institutions in Karankani.

Administrative meetings in village Richa are held in the home of the
resident Bru1a 1 f travelling teacher.   On the evening of January 18, 1974,
seven members of the Local Spiritual Assembly met to discuss the contents
of a message sent to various village communities by the Ujjain Regional
Teaching Committee concerning the state of the Indian Baha'i Fund.

In every country throughout the world where there exists a functioning
national spiritual assembly, there also exists a national fund.      These
funds consist of money freely given to the Faith by local adherents       <~~d
in some cases, as with India, allocated funds from the international
headquarters in Haifa)* which supports all teaching and consolidation work
within a specific country.     Contributions to Baha'i funds are meant to
be voluntary in nature, the only type of appeals for 1noney permitted being

those directed to the conununity as a whole.        The Universal House of
Justice, therefore, has supported the idea of general appeals to the
body of be}ievers.       Accordingly, the Indian National Spiritual Assembly
occasionally makes such requests.       A letter addressed to its teaching
committees reveals the Assemb.ly's position.

> VIe have to educate all the Baha'i's
> old or new, who have accepted Baha'u'llah
> that they are full and equal members of
> the BaM:' r \lor let Cormr,uni ty and as such
> they are equally responsible to the

> not hesitate, nor be diffident, in
> speaking of the Fund to the believers
> in mass teaching areas. They should
> know that giving to the Baha'r fund
> attracts blessings upon them. 54

A similar appeal was made during January of 1974, and hence the topic
of the Indian Fund was discussed during the meeting of the Local Spiritual
Assembly    in Richa.

Like the meeting in Karankani the Richa consultative session was
begun with a prayer read by the Chairman of the Assemby (Rajput) who is
also a Baha'i travelling teacher.       He then proceeded to inform the
assembled members that the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee wanted to
remind believers in Malwa that the Indian Baha'i Fund is the fmmdation
upon which all Baha'i activities in India are based;       trevelling teachers
teaching institutes, conferences, and village schools are all supported
by its resources.       Therefore, each local spiritual assembly in the
region was being asked to consult on the question of how to encourage
greater participation among the believers in their respective communities.
In the consultation that followed it was finally decided that the question

\[53\] Shoghi Effendi, The Horld Order of Baha'u'lHih, p. 9
54 Unpublished correspondence of the Hational Spiritual Asse11bly of the

Baha'is of India, 'Letter to teaching committees, J~anuary 15, 1971'
should be presented to the believers during the next feast.        However,
to set an example for the rest of the community to follow, the Assembly
would make a monthly contribution to the Indian Baha'i Fund.           Unlike
the meeting in Karankani,consultation was not dominated by specific
personalities.    \Vhile the Baha 1 1 teacher guided the discussion, several
members contributed ideas, including the Assembly's Chamar member.              In
fact, it was this 'untouchable' who suggested that the body make an
initial contribution.    Furthermore, there seemed to be a more democratic
spirit surrounding the meeting;       participants treated each other as
equals, and there Has no sign of individual superiority.

In seeking factors that might explain the differences between the
Richa andKarahkaaimeetings two conditions emerge as being particularly
significant.     First, the headman in Richa is not a Baha'i, and therefore
his influence is not felt as it is in Karankaniwhere as pointed out
earlier the Gujar headman is one of the most active declarants in the
village.   Second, the Baha'i community in Richa is characterized by
its large number of young declarants; 66 % of the community's believers
are under the age ofthirty (see Chapter 4).        Consequently, there is no
individual among them .rho represents a traditional figure of authority,
.rhereas in Karankani the t.ro elder members of the community both hold
positions of authority in the traditional po.rer structure.       If   there is
anyone in Richa who might be considered the community leader it \Wuld
be the Baha '1 travelling teacher, but his age (26) prevents him from
assuming a traditional type of authorative role.        Therefore, it .rould
seem that in villages like Richa where the Baha'i community does not
include within its ranks persons who represent traditional authoritative
positions there is greater potential for the democratic aspects of Baha'i
administrative processes to reveal themselves.
Among the five 'model villages' cited in this study, ho.rever, Richa

appears to be an exception.              In Garabel1 administrative activities tend
to be governed by Baiiu caste leaders, one of whom was among the original
Bah8.'l converts in Malwa.             Having the dual prestige of being a spokesman
for the scheduled castes and a former Baha'i travelling teacher, the
latter is looked to by other members of the community for guidance and
leadership.      In Manasa and Kasod there exist similar situations to the
one in Karallkani; in both communities tbe village headman and other
traditional village leaders are members of the Faith, and consequently
they often control Baba'1 administrative institutions.             For example, in
Hanasa the headman bas been a member of tbe village's Local Spiritual
Assembly since its establishment in the early 1960's, and bas travelled
several times to New Delhi in the role of a convention delegate, while
in Kasod the Local Spiritual Assembly is dominated by influential Rajputs.

Similar conditions seem to prevail at feasts.            \Htr1   the exception
of Rich~, community consultation is governed by a few individuals, the
majority of attendants including both high and low caste members being
only passive participants.             This situation was readily apparent during
community consultation in Kasod where as mentioned in Chapter 9 the
question of building a Baha'i bhavan was raised.             In discussing the
subject ><ith a visiting Baha'i travelling teacher, four members of the
co!1lllluni ty predominated:     t\w
Raj puts, a Brahman, and the Balai school
teacher.      vlhile other members of the commw1ity listened to the discussion
they did not air their views.

Ylhile by no means comprehensive in scope, the above accow1ts
nevertheless give an indication of the state of Baha'i administrative
institutions in the five 'model villages'.              In general it would appear
that their modus operandi is not al11ays, consistent ~ri th Bal{a '1
administrative norms:          meetings are not held    on a regular basis;    records

of those meetings which are held are not usually kept;       and roroper
methods of voting are not generally adhered to.       Hore i· ..portantly, in
most of the communi ties the spirit of Baha' '[ consultation, namely, free
and   e~ual   participation by all members of the assembly or cownunity is
lacking.      The examples of the Karankaniand K~sod meetings reflect this
phenomenon.      However, it should once again be stressed that at this
stage in the development of Baha 1 '[ administrative institutions in Malwa
the fact that elected members of a village assembly will come together
to make decisions concerning their communities is seen by the Baha'i
Administrative Order in India to be in itself a type of brea_l:through.
Given the traditional influences of hierarchical leadership and the Baha'i
policy of training specific believers to act as community leaders and
educators, the problem of dominant individuals seems to be accepted as
an inevitable stage through which the communities will have to pass.
Yet, with the continual breakdo'm of traditional village leadership roles
(as aresult of the introduction of modern secular ideals and institutions
such as the Village Committee and universal suffrage) the future holds
many possibilities for the development of Baha'1 adminisorative institutions
in Halwa, and therefore the Baha' '[ Administrative Order is primarily
concerned that for the present their presence in the villages be known,
even in a limited form, because a time may      come when they will be in a
position to develop into more significant sources of village leadership.

Chapter ll    Education and Propagation

In Baha'i literature great emphasis is placed on the cultivation of
community education.      At the same time, much importance is attatched to the
sponsoring of local propagation    campaigns~   In fact, education and
propagation are two of the pillars of Balla 'f conununity life:   one is directed
towards strengthening the community internally, while the other aims at
adding members to its ranlm.      This chapter will take a brief look at Balla 'i
teachings regarding education and propagation ,both in their theoretical forms,
and as they are being implemented in rural 11alwa.
In The Tablet of Ishraaat Bru1a'u'llah states:

> It is enjoined upon every father to provide for
> the instruction of his sons and daughters in the
> art of learning and writing and in that which
> hath been prescribed in My Epistles. He that
> neglecteth that whereunto he is bidden, if he
> be wealthy, the Trustees are to take from him
> that which is required for their education, and
> if he be poor, the matter shall devolve upon the
> House of Justice •.• l
As the preceding passage reveals, education in the Baha ':l Faith means
universal education;     all believers are given the responsibility of educating
their sons and daughters so that ignorance might be eliminated and knowledge
become the guiding light of civilization.       In this vein, 'Abdu'l-Balla penned
the following:

> The primary, the bost {ji~ urgent requirement
> is the promotion of education. It is
> inconceivable that any nation should acheive
> prosperity and success un1ess this paramount,
> this fundamental concern is carried forward.
> The principal reason for the decline a11d fall of
> peoples is ignorance. Today the mass of the
> people are uninfonned even as to ordinary affairs ,
> how much less do they grasp the core of the
> important problems and complex needs of the time. 2

In fact) so much importance is placed on the education of children in the
Baha'i Faith that it is considered an obligatory command vhich if not
obeyed leaves the individual concerned ans>lerable to God.            For example,
it is written that 'Should they neglect this matter, they shall, be held
responsible and 1mrthy of reproach in the presence of the stern Lord.' 3
Another passage repeats the warning:         1

Be\fare! Beware! that ye fail not
in this matter.   Endeavor with heart, with life, to train your children,
especially the daughters.    No excuse is acceptable in this matter. •

Education, hm<ever, does not only mean the training of children.

It also implies the development of the mental powers of all members of the
community.    Horeover, it not only involves the learning of matters related
to the temporal world, but also infers the understanding of 'divine'
realities.    ConseCJ.uently, while knowledge of' the sciences and arts is
praised, it is not held to be the only domain of education.              Rather, the
teachings of science and religion are seen to be complementary spheres of
knowledge, and a proper investigation of both is necessary for a complete
understanding of reality.     Hence, 'He may think of science as one wing
and religion as the other;    a bird needs t1m liings for flight, one alone
would be useless. • 5   However, true arts and sciences are not those topics
which begin and end in \wrds;    they are the spheres of'        klw~<ledge   <lhich
are conducive to the \<ell-being and tranCJ.uili ty of mankind.

Thus, vhile
Baha 1 fs are encouraged to acCJ.uire klwvledge of the arts and sciences, they
are also commanded to seek out the     1

divinet realities as expressed in
the writings of Baha'u'llilli and   1 Abdu'l-Baha:

3 Tablets of' Abdul-Baha Abbas, vol. III, p. 579
4 'Abdu'l-Baha, in Baha'i Horld Faith, p. 399
5 Paris Talks, p. 130
6 Baha'u'llah, EDistle to the Son of the Holf, p. 19

> Is it not astonishing that although man has
> been created for the lmmdeclge and love of
> God, for the virtues of the human viorld, for
> spirituality, heavenly illumination and life
> eternal, nevertheless he continues ignorant
> ar1d negligent of all this? Consider hm-I he
> seeks knowledge of everything except knm·rledge
> of God .•• How much he is attracted to the mysteries
> of matter and how completely unaware he is of
> the mysteries of divinity!7
One of the vital responsibilities of the Local Spiritual Assembly,
therefore, is the promotion of COllUlluni ty educational activities.        Regarding
this responsibility Shoghi Effendi 'rrote:

> They (I.ocal spiritual assemblie§) must promote
> by every means in their power the material as
> 1iell as the spiritual enlightment of youth, the
> means for the education of children, institute,
> whenever possible, Baha'i educational institutions,
> organize and supervise their work and provide the
> best means for their progress and development.8
The primary purpose of Balla' i educational activities, however, is
not just to provide believers vith a theoretical knm;ledge of the Faith's
teachings but to teach them how to translate this knowledge into the realm
of action.      In essence Bah§,'l education means learning the meaning of
Baha'i writings in .rays that will provide a basis for believers to act in
accordance to the teachings of Baha'u'llEi.h.        Consequently, Baha'i
education is largely moral education.          Its aim is to teach the believer
to know himself as part of the divine chain of creation and to sho1i him
that the development of' society is closely linked 1ri th his personal conduct.
As the Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas record:

7 Foundations of llorld Unity. Talks by        Abdu' l-Baha, (1hlmette, Illinois,

1968), p. 61,
8 Shoghi Effendi, Bahil'l Administ.ration, I)· 38

In India, where most of' the rural local spiritual assemblies are
not well developed, the BahB.' i Administrative Order has promoted corrununi ty
education by establishing educational institutions on both the regional
and local levels.    Nention has already been made of the most prominent
regional educational institution in Malwa, the Indore Teaching Institute.
In addition to the Institute there are two other educational institutions
functioning on the regional level:    regional conferences, and seasonal
schools.    Horeover, on the local level ten village primary schools have
been established.

Regional conferences are similar to teaching institutes in that they
provide occasions when declarants from throughout the region (and country)
can meet with each other for the purpose of learning about the various
aspects of Baha' 'L life.   The main difference betlfeen the two is that
teaching institutes are held in one location and rw1 on a more regular
basis, whereas conferences are held throughout the region and are generally
called for a specific purpose or event.      In addition,   a~though   they often
contain 'educational' programs within their formats, conferences tend to
be more oriented tmrards the creation of group urlity and the development
of' enthusiasm as regards teaching caJnpaigns than they are with direct study
of the writings.

After the great explosion of declarations that followed the Saii.gimanda
experiment (see Chapter 3), the Baha' 1 Administrative Order in India

9 Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas, val. II, p. 373

sponsored a series of conferences in l1alwa for the purpose of promoting
unity among the new declarants.       In August of 1961 a large conference was
held in Dhar.     This was followed by similar conferences in Ujjain and
Indore.     \men RuJ::lyyih Khamun visited Mal1m in 1964 special conferences
were held in Shajapur and Indore, and a rash of such conferences were
convened in 1968, one of which was a special 'deepening' conference held
in Uj j ain for the education of tribal declarants.

°   Furthermore, over
four hundred declarants from l1alwa attended the International Baha'i
Conference held in New Delhi in 1967.       Recent years have seen periodic
conferences both in Ujjain and Indore, and, furthermore, another large
conference is being pla.nned for l!alwa in 1975 to help promote the Universal
House of Justice's new Five-Year Plan.

The educational portions of these conferences usually involve talks
presented by special guest speakers (often prominent members of the Baha' :L
Administrative Order, such as Hands of the Cause or visiting international
personalities).     Thus the primary function of regional conferences is
not to provide intense study but to engender spirit and feelings of group
unity.

A more purely educational institution is the Baha''i seasonal school..

Originally termed summer-schools - because they were developed by early
converts in America during periods of summer vacation - these educational
gatherings of believers have over the years expanded beyond the boundaries
of a particular season so that today most Baha'1 communities around the
world hnld not only regional summer-schools but regional winter and spring-
schools.     Shoghi Effendi anticipated such a development 1<hen he relayed
that although su:m.'ller-s chools were originally convened in the summer months

' •.. there is no reason vhy they should be called "Summer Schools".'

\[10\] There have been a good number of declarations among tribal peoples in

Halwa, especially among the Bhils.
11 'Letter to a11 individual believer, December 26,        1941' , Letters from the

> Guardian to Aw::tralia a.nd Nev.r Zealand, p. l.t2

SUllllller, \linter, and spring schools are held throughout India for the
purpose of 'deepening' declarants in the kn01<ledge of the Baha' '[ vri t;ings.
Although there is no rigid format to vhich instructors must adhere, the
folloving vas advised by Shoghi Effendi:

> Shoghi Effendi feels that the real purpose of
> these S=er Schools is to deepen the knO\dedge
> of the friends. Lectures are very essential
> for they give a vonderful picture of the subject
> matter, but it is not sufficient to have a
> picture; the friends should deepen their
> knovledge and this can be achieved if, together
> vith lectures, there are study classes and
> seminar >wrk carried on by the same lecturer.12

Consequently, one of the central aims of seasonal schools is to provide
an environment in vhich believers can both hear and learn the revealed
verses of    Baha'u'll~   and 'Abdu'l-Baha.

Since the advent of mass teaching in Hal11a special seasonal schools
have been periodically held in both Ujjain and Indore.         The sessions last
from several days to a veek, during 11hich time participants eat, sleep,

and vork vi thin the confines of Baha'i educational centers •             Their
formats have usually folloved the general pattern auoted above vith

special emphasis being placed on administrative topics.         Furthermore,
much of the vork in these schools bas been oriented tovards oral education,
as the problems of illiteracy often diminish the value of direct scriptural
study.

The Baha ''L Administrative Order has not only developed educational

institutions on the regional level in Balwa, it has also sponsored the
establishment of village primary schools.         In Malva ten such schools are

. . 16 an d several
currently f unctlonlng,           - h ave b een o ff· lClally

recognlz.ed by the
l-ladhya Pradesh District Education Officer as meeting the government 1 s

req_uirements for primary schools.        Five of the schools are located in
Shajapur district;    two are situated in both Bandsaur and Ratlam districts;
and one is located in Ujjain district.        Each school has a resident Baha'i
teacher ,;ho is supported by the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee.

The curriculum in the village schools consists of Hindi, mathematics,
and geography-history.      In addition, one period each day is devoted to
Baha' J: education, ,;hich generally involves memorizing prayers and learning
about the lives of the central figures of the Faith.

Three of the five 'model village' comrr!Uni ties examined in this study
have functioning Baha' 1 primary schools within their boundaries.        The
l1anasa school was built in 1968, the sarr.c year that villa,c:ers in Karankani
constructed their school.      In Kasod there is no school house (although
members of the community have recently been considering the possibility
of building a Baha' 1 bhavan - see Chapter 9 -), and conseq_uently classes
are held in the open.     In both Richa and Garabeli government schools
have been erected, and conseq_uently there is no real need for Baha' 1
schools.

The Hanasa primary school has twenty-one students, all of whom are
boys ranging in age from four to ten years.         Three of the pupils come from
status groups which have traditionally been classified as 'unclean' and

\[16\] There were at one time close to tventy primary schools functioning in

l7 Baha''l Ne;rs (India) of September - October, 1973 noted that several
additional schools had also applied for recognition (p. 10).

\[1\] untouchable 1   ,   t1w being members of the Balai caste    and one coming from
a Chamar family.            The remainder of the children are members of the Rajput
caste.

The resident teacher is a Rajput <rho has been in the service of the
Baha 'l Faith for five years.           He conducts daily classes in all of the
above listed subjects, and his school is one of those recognized by the
l,!adhya Pradesh Educational officer as meeting            required   government
standards.

In addition to the standard subjects the teacher maintained that some
time each day is relegated for the teaching of Baha 1 f prayers, which is
accomplished by means of oral repetition.             In this process the teacher
recites a line of verse which is then repee;ted by the child until he has
mastered the prayer.            As a res1ut of this training, fifteen of the pupils
kno<r complete prayers by heart, and many of them can stand and recite

verses <rithout any difficulty .            The instructor also stated that besides
the daily session of verse repetition, lessons relating to the central
figures of the Faith are periodically presented.

The village school in Karal1kani has not as yet been recognized by
the Maih':!ya Pradesh government.           As in tlanasa, the resident teacher is in
the employment of the Ujj ain R.egional Teaching Committee, as is his wife
,,rho also teaches in the school.            In addition to his responsibility in
Karankani the teacher periodically journeys to a nearby village to help
direct the activities of a second Bah a 1 'L village school. l9

a
Tbe subjects taught in the KaraDkani Bah '1 school are the same as
those taught in Hanasa, and like its sister class 2mphasis is placed on
teaching children prayers by means of oral repetition.                Consequently,
most all of the t>renty children 1>1ho attend the school know at least one

Bah8.' l prayer.

The same situation exists in Kasod where apart from the standard
curriculum the twenty-three students learn Bah aIr prayers and listen to
stories about the leading figures in Baha':L history.       Significantly, the
village teacher in Kasod comes from an 'unclean' caste.        Although a Balai
he teaches children from both 'clean' and 'unclean' caste backgounds, many
of his students being the sons of R3.jputs.      It should be noted, moreover,
that he is not an isolated example of this phenomenon, for among the ten
village school teachers in Halwa two are Chamars and two (including the
Kasod. teacher) share Balai ancestry.

In establishing vi11age schools the Bah a' :L Administrative Order hopes
to accomplish two things:     first, to help raise the literacy rate in rural
Baha'f communities by providing declarants' children with a primary education
and the possibilityfor further advancement; and second, and perhaps more
realistically, to make village children aware of the basic ideals and modes
of behavior associated. with the Baha''l Faith, with the hope that as they
mature they will be able to assimilate these ideals into their daily life
patterns.     As ;,as mentioned. earlier, one of the main proble.'lls associated
>ri th the consolidation plans of the Baha' :L Faith in Hal;ra has been that
many of the concepts and modes of behavior found in its teachings are
culturally alien to rural Hindus.       By educating village children from an
early age Baha'f administrators in India hope to break down to some extent
this type of cultural alienation, and. in so doing, allow for the next
generation of rural BahB.' ls to become more 'deepened' in the ways of the
Faith.      In fact, members of the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee place
much of their faith in future community development in village primary
schoolc, and. consequently during the the Five-Year Plan there is hope that
additional schools can be established in l1al1.ra.     In this regard, travelling
teachers reported that many village communities are anxious to have similar
A Baha'i village school and class

institutions established in their villages, but at the present time the
Baha' :L community in India faces the financial problem of trying to
maintain widespread teaching and consolidation activities on a very
limited budget.      If this problem can be eliviated, however,            it is
likely that the 1970's will see further educational activity at the
village level.

The leaders of the Baha'1 Faith from BEJla'u'llah to the Universal
House of Justice have not only placed great emphasis on the importance of
developing community education, they have also stressed the necessity of
individual believers becoming actively involved in propagation efforts.
In this sense the Baha'i Faith is a proselytizing religion, for it seeks
to find new converts by means of 'missionary' activity.

The writings of the Baha'i Faith contain numerous references to
propagation and proclamation.       For example, in Gleanings from the ll'ri tine~s
of Baha'u'llah the .following is recorded:

> Center your energies in the propagation of the
> Faith of God. Whoso is •mrthy of so high a
> calling, let him arise and promote it. Whoso
> is umible, it is his duty to appoint him 1iho
> will, in his stead, proclaim this Revelation,
11hose power hath caused the foundations of the

> rr.ightiest structures to quake, every mountain
> to be crushed into dust, and every soul to be
> dumbfounded .18
And again,

> 'rhe Pen of the Most High hath decreed and imposed
> upon every one the obligation to teach this Cause .•.
> God will, no doubt, inspire uhosoever detacheth
> himself from all else but Him, and will cause the
> pure 11aters of' 1lisdom and utterance to gush out and
> flow copiously from his heart .19

19 Gleanings from the HritinB:s of Bah8.'u 1 llilh, p. 314

'Abdu '1-BahB., \i'hose entire life was dedicated to teaching the
doctrines of his father, and to vhom the Baha ':ls of the vorld turn as their
perfect exemplar, penned the follO\fing words in his Tablets of the Divine
~:

> In brief, I hope you vill display in this respect
> the greatest effort and magnanimity. It is assured
> that you 1<ill become assisted and confirmed. A
> person declaring the glad tidings of the appearance
> of the realities and significances of the Kingdom
> is like unto a farmer v1ho scatters pure seeds in
> the rich soil. rrhe spring cloud -.;.rill pour upon
> them the rain of bounty, and unquestionably the
> station of the farmer vill be raised in the
> estimation of the lord of the village, and many
> harvests will be gathered.20

He supplemented this statement in a letter to an individual believer when
he wrote:

> It seems that thou vast uncertain vhether to occupy
> thyself in \Vriting or delivering the tidings of the
> Cause of God. In these days, to deliver the glad-
> tidings is the best of all. Open then thy tongue
> to the guidance of the human race on any occasion
> that presents itself.21
As recorded in Chapter l, it    \?aS   Shoghi Effendi uho personally
organized and directed Baha'i propagation plans betueen the years 1921 and
1957, launching several international campaigns, the most notable of which
was the Ten-Year Crusade.      Time and again in his writings the Guardian of
the Baha'i Faith admonished the believers to arise and teach the religion
of Baha'u'llah.     For exa..'llple, in 1930 he vrote:

> Indeed to bring this message to mankind in its
> darkest hour of need is the paramount duty of
> every believer. All the agony, the suffering,
> privation and spiritual blindness afflicting
> people today ever:y><here in the world, to a greater
> or lesser degree, is because they are una\Iare of,
> or indifferent to, the Remedy God has sent them.
> Only those who are mmre of it can carry its healing
> knowledge to others, so that each Baha' 1 has an
> inescapable Emd sacred duty to perform.22

\[22\] Quoted in Directives from the Guardian, p. 74

In a like manner, upon its election in 1963 the Universal House of Justice
reiterated that 'The high intensity of teaching activity reached at the end
of the Horld Crusade, far from slackening, must nm' be increased as the
friends everywhere     dra>~   on the vast spiritual pm,rers released as a result of

House of   Just~ce.

l>'hile the pleas of Baha'i leaders have been consistent, it has only
been in the last fifteen years that the Ba.loa' :L Faith has entered into the
arena of mass teaching, and,as        >~e   have seen in previous chapters India
>~as   in the forefront of such activity.         Although slovr in starting, the
active campaign of village teaching that characterized the 1960's changed
the entire structure of the Indian Baha'i community.               India suddenly
became a mass teaching community whose resources           >~ere   channeled into
programs and campaigns designed to propagate the teachings of the Faith
among the subcontinent 1 s vast rural population.

In Halwa, teaching activities are supervised by the Ujjain Regional
Teaching Committee.         In directing local campaigns the Committee has made
an effort to utilize village        manpo>~er   whenever possible, and as a result
it has organized a corps of travelling village teachers.                In Chapter 6
it >~as noted that one of the functions of travelling teachers in Hal>~a is
to act as channels of C01lllmmication between the village communi ties and
Baha'2 administrative institutions, more particularly the Ujjain Regional
Teaching Committee.         Their second responsibility is to propagate the
Faith in the rural areas.          Concerning this vital function the Universal
House of Justice in a letter to all mass teaching national spiritual
assemblies stated the folloving:

23 'lviessage to national conventions, Nay 7, 19 63 1 , Hellsur:ing of Guidance,
P· 6

> From. among the believers native to each country,
> competent travelling teachers must be selected
> and teaching projects worked out. In the words

> sustained support should be given to the vitally
> needed and meritorious activities started by the
> native ... travelling teachers, ... who, as the
> mighty task progresses, must increasingly bear
> the brunt of responsibility for the propagation
> of the Faith in their homelands ~~24

In another letter \IT'itten specifically to the Indian National Spiritual
Assembly the Universal House of Justice elaborated on the implementation
of this institution:

> ... the progress and growth of the Cause in India
> depend on the services of your mm people, and to
> this end, a concerted effort should be made to
> integrate the friends in India into the work of
> the Cause in all its aspects, to assure universal
> participation that will resu1t in >~inning even
> greater victories for the Cause. In this connection,
> your idea of engaging a number of >rell trained
> travelling teachers in India is, in principle
> correct. You have various Teaching Institutes and
> a number of devoted, well-informed teachers at your
> disposal for this service.25
Over the years the Baha'i Administrative Order in India has trained
numerous travelling teachers to carry forth the message of Bah a' u' llah
to the village communities of .Malwa.   These individuals have come from
local towns and villages, and they have been responsible for bringing many

of the new declarants into the Baha'i Faith.        At the present time there
are thirteen such teachers actively working in the region.      All of them
have been specially selected by the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee,
and they have all participated in specific training courses.       Among the

24   'Letter to all national spiritual assemblies engaged in mass teaching,

travelling teachers.

teacher, but Garabeli contains an ex-teacher "ho ~<as very active during
the initial years of mass teaching in t.!a.hra, and the other three all have

resident primary school teachers.

Travelling teachers are supported by funds supplied by the Ujjain
Regional Teaching Cmmnittee.      Each month they receive a given allowance
to help maintain themselves in the field, but they are not considered
permanent employees of the Baha'i Faith, as Shoghi Effendi considered such
an act tantamount to having a payed      cler~;,   an institution forbidden by
Bah8.'u'll8.h.   The Guardian expressed this feeling when     r:; wrote:

> Likewise travelling teachers should be assisted

The Universal House of Justice supported the Guardian 1 s vie,;.; "\Then in a
letter addressed to all national spiritual assemblies engaged in mass
teaching they stated:

> There is a danger inthis situation ><hich must be

As their name implies, travelling teachers traverse the rural areas of
Malwa proclaiming the message of the Baha'i Faith in to1<11s and villages.

\[27\] Primary school teachers often engage in proclamation activities, but

their essential task is the 1n.aintenance of village schools.

They often travel on foot, as in many areas it is the only sui table mode
of transportation,       'rhe general policy of the Ujjain Regional Teaching
Committee has been to instruct teachers to engage in one hour of prayer
before starting on their journey.        In addition, although there is no
Official method of teaching the Faioh, they are encouraged to follow
certain procedures which have proved to be helpful in village teaching.

First, and perhaps most importantly, travelling teachers are reminded
that the most essential element in introducing the F'aith to new listeners
is not the knmrledge the teacher possesses but his spirit and love for
Baha •u •nB.h.     They are instructed to make themselves instruments through
which Baha'u'llii.h can work.      For exrunple, in one training session teachers
were told about an illiterate village teacher who upon e.tering a rural
community only said the name Baha'u'llah, but he said it with such
sincerity that several members of the village declared.        Thus , above all,
teachers are advised to be sincere and loving and not to force the message
upon unwilling listeners.

One technique employed by most travelling teachers in Halwa is to
initially seek out the village heawnan.        This procedure is followed for
several reasons.        In the first place, as this individual maintains a
position of traditional authority in the village it is considered a mark
of respect to ask his permission before initiating any teaching activity.
Second, since he often holds great influence in the community his
declaration is likely to result in other members of the village taking
interest,        Finally, since the headman generally comes from a 'clean' caste,
by approaching him Baha'i teachers are not marking themselves as

missionaries who are aiming at converting 'low' caste Hindus.

30 As stated in Chapter 3 this procedure was adopted in Aalwa during the

> mid-1960's when it vas learned that many 'clean' caste Hindus
considered the Baha'i Faith to be a religion for 'untouchables'.

Furthermore, because of the historical antagonism between Hinduism
and Islam, travelling teachers are advised not to identify the Baha' :[
Faith with the latter.      For exarr,ple, they are advised not to use the
phrase 'Allah' u' Abha' (see Chapter 6) in front of new contacts, as the
Arabic is too easily identified with Islam.       In fact, a number of village
teachers initially refer to Baha'u'llah as Bhagavan Balla. 31 In the same
vein, travelling teachers often greet their listeners with the traditional
greeting'Jay Jay Rama'.     !1oreover, as discussed in Chapter 7, Baha 1 u 1 118.h
is spoken of in terms of the avatara tradition, and in many instances
passages from the Ramayru;a and Bhaga.vad   GI ta are used to exemplify the

ideals of the Baha'f Faith.

Propagation campaigns in Halwa are often stimulated by teaching
conferences.     On these occasions Baha'i teachers from th·oughout the region
gather for two or three day sessions during ifhich time they prepare themselves
both mentally and spiritually for the tasks they are called on to         accom~lish.

As was noted earlier in this chapter, conferences are often visited by
important Baha '1 personalities ;rho address the assembled group concerning
the import of' mass teaching.
F'or example, Hand of the Cause Ruh:lyyih Khanum
spoke at numerous teaching conferences during her 1964 trip to the
subcontinent.     At one conference held in Indore she told the Baha' 1
teachers that:

> ••. a Baha'i teacher should be so dedicated to the
> Cause t:hat no obstacles could dishearten him, his
> heart must be overflmring with love for all humanity
> and he must be absolutely assured of' Baha'u'llah's
> guidance and protection.33

\[31\] Removing the cultural connotations, the ·wo have basically the same

meaning.
32 For example, one teacher declared that he often identified Baha' u' llah' s

> exhortation: 'I·!y first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and
> radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient, imperishable
> and everlasting.' with Barna's claim:    'I accept the man ifith the
> pure heart; I don't accept the man ifi th the impm•e heart. '
33Nakhjavani, p. 55

During the last few years teaching act:i vi ty in Halwa has not been as
intense as it was in the early and mid-1960's.    This is primarily due to
the fact that much of the movemenc 's energ'J in recent years has been
directed towards consolidation programs.    However, the Universal House of
Justice's new Five-Year Plan calls for an increase in the number of local
spiritual assemblies in India from the current number of   4,369   to 7,000
by the year 1979.   Consequently, one can assume that teaching activity
vill once again be accelerated.    In directing the nev campaign Baha'i
administrative institutions in India vill be guided by the closing words
of the nev Plan:

> As the old order gives >my to the new, the
> changes which must take place in human affairs
> are such to stagger the imagination. 'rhis is

Chapter 12     Conclusion

It is now time to draw together the various pieces of information
presented in the body of this study and attempt to make some comprehensive
statements about the role of the Baha' 'L Faith in   t~al>m.   In the process
t<ro fundamental questions must be answered:   first, what are the movement's
primary teaching objectives and conseg_uential methods of approach;      and
second, what functions do its institutions perform in the contemporary
village social system?    The first theme >Jill involve looking at several
additional questions regarding the Faith's evolution from a Persian
sectarian movement into a universal religion and the resulting effects this
development has had on its relationship with Hinduism, while the second
will include both an examination of the reasons why Malwa villagers are
declaring their belief in Baha'i doctrines and an analysis of the present
state of Baha''L institutions in the five 'model village' communities.
Regarding the second theme, the author is not in a position to make
finalized conclusions.    As has been mentioned several times throughout the
study, the amount of first hand observational data he was able to gather in
the village commtmi ties was limited by the official restrictions placed
upon him, and consequently, although some examples of Baha' 'L activities in
the 'model villages' were personally obllerved, additional information had
to be obtained from Baha 1 J: administrators and village teachers.    Yet, >Jhile
for the present finalized conclusions can not be dra>m, the author's
knowledge of the movement's doctrines and teaching methods when combined
with both the data received from informants and his mm personal observations
allows him, he believes, to make educated speculations as to the current
condition of Baha'i institutions in these connuunities, and consequently,
although the primary purpose of the present study has been to examine the

doctrinal and iruJtitutional components of the Baha':l Faith in the light
of how they are being taught in a specific cultural environment - the
'model village' data being primarily supplementary information designed to
give the work's abstractions some basis in reality - some remarks regarding
their actualization in the rural communities 1dll be attempted.

In one sense the Baha'1 Faith can be interpreted as a response to the
world's growing awareness of the oneness of the hwnan experience.         The
collision of worlds that accelerated with the Crusades during the middle
ages and has in the last two centuries intensified to ever increasing
degrees is shattering, admittedly not without a struggle, the ideal of
cultural exclusiveness.    Hankind is slowly coming to the realization that
cultural forms are only outward expressions and that the human experience

of greater structural significanc~
which lies behind them is '                       ln ~ ts ~,,resent form the
Baha'i Faith embodies this ideal.    Its orientation is religious;    that is,
it seeks to explain the oneness of the human experience in terms of the
Sacred - all men are created and sustained by one transcendent and
omnipotent reality which has revealed itself through numerous manifestations
who have in turn been the inspiration for the development of the world's
great religions.   The forms and symbolic modes of expression these
religions have assumed have varied according to the environment and cultural
milieu in which they have developed, but the essential experience they
engender - that of man confronting the Sacred - is universal.      It is this
last point that mal<es the Baha' :1 Faith world embracing in scope, for
numerous religions have claimed that there is only one God and that mankind
is His creation, but the former goes a step further and claims that all of
the world's major religious traditions spring from the Sacred;     a Hindu
confronting the Divine through the cultural vehicle of Hinduism has had

just as valiJ and real experience as the Christian encountering the Holy
through Christ or the l·luslim experiencing the \lord of God through l-lul_lammad.

If a universal outlook characterizes the Faith's contemporary attitude
towards other religious traditions, has this posit ion resulted from an
evolutionary process within the movement itsel:t; or have such ideas existed
from the early days of the religion's founding?        E. G-. Brmfne, who was
studying the Baha'i Faith at a time when it was just beginning to develop
into an international movement, felt that the religion had undergone great
changes since the time of the Bab.       As he wrote in the introduction to
his translation of 'rhe Tar1kh-i-Jad1d:

> At the present day, therefore, the vast majority of
> Biibls are Behil 'ls, whose doctrines, sentiments, and
> ideals are already far removed from those of the
> primitive B6,b:ls or modern Ezells.   No sooner   w&d
> Beha (Baha'u'lliih) firmly established in his authority
> than he began to make free use of the privilege accorded
> by the Bab to "Him whom God shall manifest" to abrogate,
change, cancel, and develop earlier doctrines. His

> chief aim seems to have been to introduce a more settled
> order, to discourage speculation, to direct the
> attention of his followers to practical reforms pursued
> in a prudent and unobtrusive fashion, to exalt ethics
> at the expense of metaphysics, to check mysticism, to
> conciliate existing authorities, including even the ShB.h
> of Persia, the Nero of' the Babi Faith, to abolish
> useless, unpractical and irksome regulations and
> restrictions, and, in general, to adapt the religion at
> the head of' which he now found himself to the ordinary
> exigencies of life, and to render it more capable of'
> becoming, what he intended to make it, a universal
> system suitable to all mankind.l
At a later date (December, 1917) Brovne felt that Baha'i doctrine had been
influenced by its introduction in the United States to various international,

pacifist, and feminist movements. c      Consequently, Brmme implied that both
Baha'u'llah and   1 Abdu'l-Baha   had adapted the original teachings of the Bab
to suit an international audience.

The official position of the Baha'i Faith is that Baha'u'llah was given

1 E. G. Browne, Introduction to The Tarildo-i-Jad1d, p. xxiv-xxv
2 E. G. Browne, Introduction to Materials for the ~~t:.ud.y of the BB.bl Religion,
p • .xix
the right as 'Him whom God shall manifest' to abrogate many of the la~<s
and teachings of the Bab.        Horeover, it is held that the young Siyyid's
teachings were designed to be enforced only for a short transitional period
between his own revelation and that of Baha'u'llah.          Accordingly, it is
the latter \lho is seen to be the true formulator of the Baha'i Faith's

\[1\] \lorld view', \lhile the former, although considered a manifestation of God,
is viewed more as Baha'u'llah's      forerunner~   a position not far removed
from BroHne' s interpretation.       Furthermore, Bah0.'ls maintain that the
movement 1 s evolution into a world religion \vas not the result of his
successors ( 1 Abdu' 1-Baha and Shoghi Effendi) manipulating his teachings
to suit an international audience.        Rather, these individuals are seen to
be the instruments ;rho constructed the superstructure Baha' u' llah had
envlsloned.

Regardless of whether Bah8.'u 1 ll8.h 1 s successors were only bringing to
fruition the prophet's original vision or ;rere chartering the movement in
ne;r directions as determined by their own interpretive creativity, there is
no doubt that under the leadership of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi the
Baha'i Faith broke loose from its Persian moorings and began to take on
universal significance.       There is no need to reiterate the details of this
trans format ion.     Hather, from the point of view of the present study one
specific development is particularly significm1t, and that is         1 Abdu'l-Baha

and Shoghi Effendi's interpretation that Baha'u'llah had included among
God's messengers the Indian figures of Krsna and the Buddha.           By stating
that these figures vrere manifestations of God, the Balla 'l leaders \·rere
breaking down barriers vhich had separated the orthodox Judea-Christian-
Islamic tradition from the religions of' India, as the former have tended to
view Buddhism and Hinduism as at best misguided religions.           Thus,

3 Shoghi Effendi, God Passes B;r, p. 98
4 Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Da;t Is Come, p. 122

t   Abdu 1 1-Bahii and Shoghi Effendi rnus;t be looked upon as playing leading roles
in the adapt ion of Baha' u' llii.h 1 s principle of the oneness of religion to the
specifics of the Indian cultural environment, an adaption which at a later
date would be refined and developed by Baha'i administrative institutions
in the subcontinent.       It is fair to say, therefore, that while Balla 'u' llah
may have had the vision of a universal faith, it has been his successors
who have enabled this vision to become a reality, and it is in this sense
that one can speak of the evolution of the Balla ':l Faith from a Persian
sectarian movement to a world religion.

The Baha'1 Faith, however, is not merely interested in proclaiming
the oneness of the religious experience.         If this were the case, like the
Theosophical Society or other liberal religious organizations it would be
satisfied with working for toleration between the        variou~   religions of the
world.      Instead, as this study indicates, Baha'i teachers are actively
involved in converting people to their cause and subseg_uently educating
them within a framework of specifically designated socio-religious
institutions.       In carrying out these activities, 11hat, vre liri.ght ask, are
the movement's fundamental objectives, and moreover, what are the
assumptions that lie behind them?

I t has already been suggested that the Balla' :L Faith can be interpreted
as a religious response to a unifying world.         In this type of
interpretation the international structure that the Faith embodies would be
seen to have been the formulation of a charismatic individual who like all
visionaries was aheacl of the majority of his contemporaries in realizing
the realities of the new llorld.       However, one must remember that in the
eyes of the charismatic formulator he was not reacting to a historical
situation - he was creating it.        Balla' u' llah claimed to be a manifestation
of the Sacred;      he was the instrument through whom God would accomplish
his preordained plan for man and civilization, a plan which began with

Adam 5 and would culminate with the establishrnent of             1

'l'he l1ost Great Peace'.

Hence, from the point of view of the Ba:ha'1 Faith the religion of
Bah8. 1 u' llB.h is the cause of, and not the response to a urdfying world, and
conseq_uently while Baha'i teachings espouse the historical validity of
other religious traditions, they also claim that these movements were
preliminary steps in the evolution of a world civilization                  V~hose   religious
base   V~ill   be the revelation of Baha'u'llah.           This point is important, for
it is the conviction that they are building 'God's Kingdom on Earth' that
sustains Baha' :L teachers both in India and other countries around the                   V~orld.

The Baha'i Faith's conversion objectives are also influenced by a sense
of the apocalyptic.        Hithin Baha'i    V~ritings      there are several references
to a 'catastrophe' that is         folloV~ing   mankind.      For example, Baha'u'llah
warns:

> 0 YE PEOPLES OF THE HORLD!
> KnoV~ verily that an unforeseen calamity is follolling
> you and that grevious retribution aV~aiteth you,6
Shoghi Effendi reiterated Baha'u'llah's admonition in the follwing                     V~ords:

> That the forces of a    V~orld   catastrophe can alone
> precipitate such a new phase of human thought is,
> alas, becoming increasingly apparent. That nothing
> short of the fire of a severe ordeal, unparalleled
> in its intensity, can fuse and V~eld the discordant
> entities that constitute the elements of present-day
> civilization, into the integral components of the
> V~orldcormnormealth of the future, is a truth V~hich
> future events V~ill increasingly demonstrate. 7

There is,      conse~uently,     a sense of urgency in the Baha'i         V~Orld   to lay an
institutional      groundV~ork    capable of surviving the calamitous machinations
of a strife-torn humanity.            In fact, it is this sense of urgency that has
precipitated the mass teaching and consolidation campaigns in India.                       Hand
of the Cause Rui_J'lyyih Khanum expressed this feeling during her trip to the

7 Shoghi Effendi, l'he l.Jorld Order of Baha 'u' llah, p. 46

subcontinent in   1964:

> The destiny of the human raee is to accept
> BahEi'u'llah, we know that as Bah8.'ls. Now, it has

> He are in a hurry. lie have lost a hundred years

> day, no matter what kind of probJ.ems arise from its
> going faster.8

Hence, the teaching and consolidation 1fork presently being carried out in
India is a reflection of the Baha'f Faith's supposition that the old world
order is soon to be roJ.led up and a new one laid out in its stead, and it
is onJ.y in light of this beJ.ief that the movement's policies in rural Halwa
can be fully understood.

The primary objective of the Baha'1 Faith, therefore, is to create a
ne\l \lorld social order \lhose values and socio-religious institutions \lill
be based on the teachings of Baha'u'llah, and. as a result its teachers are
currently engaged in promoting an active international propagation campaign.
In the process they employ a culturally adaptive teaching technique \lhereby
Baha'u'llah is presented as being the fulfillment of the latter-day
prophecies of the world's various religious traditions.       In India this has
meant that Baha' u 'll8.h has been identified \lith the avatara doctrine,
primariJ.y as it is formulated in the Bhae;avad c;Ita.    It vould be \lrong,
ho\lever, to suppose that the purpose of employing a culturally adaptive
teaching technique in tlalwa is to absorb Hindu elements into its mainstream
and thereby facilitate religious understanding.       In fact, one of the most
common misunderstandings concerning the Bahft 1 1 Fa:Lth 1 s approach to other

\[8\] Nakhjavani, p. 27-28

religious traditions is that it is eclectic in nature.        In truth, the
Faith's teachers use this technique solely as a means of identifying the
movement's teachings with traditional eschatological expectations.          They
do not compromise these teachings with those of Hinduism _r any other
religion but use traditional conceptual frameworks to construct cross-
cultural bridges?   Thus, by speaking of Baha'u'llah as an avatara Baha'i
teachers allow Hindus to understand his prophetic claims in terms of their
own culturally derived conceptual constructs, but they do not adopt the
various formulations the Hindu mind has built around these constructs.
Consequently, although the Bru1a'i Faith claims to be the fulfillment of
the avatara tradition, it also asserts that its own doctrines are the true
expression of traditional expectations and that the numerous doctrines which
have been built up around the avatara concept are extraneous accumulations
of man-made ideologies.    Therefore, the main purpose behind the movement's
use of a culturally adaptive teaching technique in Jl!alwa is to establish
a meaningful channel of communication through which its own teachings can
be introduced and implemented.

As mentioned in Chapter 7, when joining the Baha'i Faith Hindus are
not made to renounce Hinduism.     At first glance this policy seems to be in
conflict with the one stated above.     On the one hand, the Baha'f Faith does
not compromise its own teachings with those of contemporary Hinduism, and
yet converts are not made to renounce this heritage.        How are these
positions reconciled?

The apparent conflict is resolved by the movement's teachers
identifying it as the renewal of true Hinduism.       Reference was made in
Chapter 7 to the fact that Hindus believe they are living in the kali-yuga,
a time of religious decline.     IJ.'he Bahii' l position is similar in that it

9 Thus in terms of its presentation in t.Jalwa the movement has taken on a

> Vaisnavite coloring, as is reflected in the nu.'llerous allusions made
to this sect's religious concepts and s~nbols.

portrays contemporary religion as diluted by man-made trappings.
Accordingly, Bal1a' :L teachers refer to Baha 'u' llah' s doctrines as being the
essence of pure religion, and consequently Hindus are not asked to negate
their heritage but find its fulfillment in the Baha'i Faith.        This type
of teaching approach, however, presupposes the need for educational follow-
up.    A villager whose patterns of behavior have been determined by a
traditional set of values will not likely be able to conform to new
standards without some degree of organized reinforcement, and it is for this
reason that the Baha'i Administrative Order has organized consolidation
programs in Malwa.

The consolidation or 'deepening' activities of the Baha'f Faith in
Malwa are under the direction of the Ujjain Regional Teaching Committee.
As was stated earlier, the Committee's lack of resources and manpower has
meant that. in approaching this assignment it has had to concentrate its
efforts on trying to 'deepen' a limited number of declarants who can in turn
help promote the movement's teachings in the rural areas.       The result of
this approach has been that institutional development has been primarily
limited to a number of 'model village' communities, while the majority of
communities in rural Malwa have not advanced beyond the level of
ideological acceptance of Baha'i doctrine.

Even in the 'model villages', however, the educational activities of
the Baha' :L Faith have been characterized by their sense of gradualism.
As all of the chapters in Part III indicate, the Baha' :L hJrninistrative Order
in India has not tried to overwhelm new declarants by introducing the
entire galaxy of BahB.'l laws, ordinances, and institutions into village life.
Rather, it has concentrated on trying to establish a basic institutional
framework within which change can begin to take place -the variolls

institutions examined in this study being the building blocks in this
process.    Noreover, in introducing these institutions into 'model village'
communities the Baha'i Administrative Order has not tried to influence
direct change in conventional social situations.     Hhile declarants are
urged to put the teachings of Baha'u'llah into practice in their daily lives,
there has been no active attempt made to change traditional modes of behavior
outside of Baha'i institutions, and consequently most of the declarants
in the five communities examined in this study still function within the
Hindu ritual idiom.

In order to fully understand this 'indirect' approach to consolidation
it must be kept in mind that the Baha' 1 outlook assumes the eventual
collapse of present world social structures.     According to the Baha'i view,
as the world continues to move towards internationalism its various
traditional social systems will to ever-increasing degrees be unable to cope
with the new problems that arise.    This view was poignantly stated by
Shoghi Effendi when he wrote:

> The whole world, wherever and however we survey it,
> offers us the sad and pitiful spectacle of a vast,
> an enfeebled, and moribund organism, >Ihich is being
> torn politically and strangulated economically by
> forces it has ceased either to control or comprehend. 10

Thus, the Faith's leaders assume that radical change will be the order of
the day and that the movement does not so much have to en,-2nder change as
be able to provide doctrines and institutions that can cope with it.
Accordingly, Baha'i aruninistrative institutions in India are not interested
in using their efforts to tear down a system which they feel will eventually
collapse of its own weight.     Rather, they are trying to construct the
foundations of a new socio-religious system whose institutions will provide
declarants with alternative frames of reference in which to participate as
the old system continues to become disfunctional to the modern world.       In
10 Shoghi Effendi, The Vlorld Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 188

fact, the Adl!linistrative Order's entire program of developing a small number

of       model village' commnnities - a policy which at first glance mighc appear
to be insignificant in terms of the amonnt of behavioral change it can
induce - must be understood in terrns of this futuristic outlook.         To
Baha'is the continual breakdown of the world's social systems makes it
imperative that people are at least made aware of the alternatives that the
Baha'i Faith offers, and therefore it is the feeling of Baha':l administrators
in India that if a framework of Bah a1 i communi "ty life can be established,
even on a limited scale, in a number of key village corn.mu1rities, the time
will come when large numbers of declarants will be able to be brought into
active participation in Baha'i institutions.

Seen in this light the current consolidation policy seems to be
realistic in approach.       Demanding sudden and thorough change or directly
attacking traditional institutions in their conventional 3etting would no
doubt result in a backlash that might remove the Bah a 1 1 Faith from the
villages altogether.        Instead, by opting for a policy of gradual
resocialization the Baha'i Adl!linistrative Order has placed its faith in the

power of the Baha'i message and its implications for the future.

From what we know of the Baha'i Faith's beliefs, social principles, and

l l The philosophy behind this approach is one which asserts that as new

teaching and consolidation techniques, whut kind of speculations can be made
as to why a substantial munber of Malwa villagers have declared their belief
in Baha'u'lliih?

It seems apparent that one of the reasons villagers have declared
themselves followers of Baha'u'llah is that for many of them the Baha'i Faith
offers a means by which they can raise their own self-esteem.             Here
reference is made to the large number of 'unclean' and 'untouchable' caste
members who have reportedly enrolled in the F'ai th.        In this regard, the
Baha' 1 principle of the oneness of manldnd is very significant.           •Low' caste
Hindus are naturally attracted to a movement which preaches the           e~uality

of believers and the elimination of status group segregation.             Thus, an
overriding causal factor in the great rise of declarations in Halwa in
recent years must be the egalitarian ideals that the Faith enshrines.
However, this factor alone does not provide a complete explanation.              I f the
ideal of social    e~uality   were the only issue involved one would expect that
most 'unclean' and 'untouchable' Hindus would have converted to one of the
several 'egalitarian' religions which have found their way to the
subcontinent over the centuries.        Moreover, as the statistics from the five

communi ties cited in this study indicate, a number of'          clean' caste members
have also declared their belief in Baha'u'llah.        Therefore, there must be
additional variables influencing villagers' decisions.

Another factor which must be considered is the movement's attitude
towards Hinduism.     Although this attitude is not eclectic in formulation,
it is still syncretic, in that it does not disdain what it considers to be
'true 1 Hinduism but rather exalts it to a position of eq_uality among the
world's great religious traditions.        Conse~uently,   when a Hindu d.eclares
his belief in Baha'u'llah he does not do so at a cost to his own psycho-
cultural identification.        One of the main reasons that 'low' caste Hindus
have not converted en masse to other religions is because in the process

they are req_uired to denounce their Hindu heritage.          On the other hand, by
declaring themselves followers of Baha'u'll8.h Hindus of any caste background
are not cutting their religio-cultural roots but proclaiming their belief
in pure religion as revealed by the yu~avatara, a position which allows them
to remain within the Hindu fold and protects them from being labled converts
to a 'foreign' religion.

Here a point has been touched on ><hich at first glance might seem to be
a case of hair splitting.    Is there really a great deal of difference, one
might ask, bet><een a religion which proclaims certain socio-religious
doctrines independently of the Hindu tradition (for example, Christianity
or Isl8.m) and another religion which preaches similar ideals but does so
in the framework of the Hindu tradition?    The author feels that there is
a difference, and that an awareness of this distinction and its ramifications
when combined with an understanding of the Baha'2 policy of not directly
attacking the conventional social system gives one a better insight into
whY Hindus are declaring their belief in Baha'u'llah.

It has already been stated (Chapter 7) that as a socio-religious
organism Hinduism allows its adherents a great deal of flexibility in terms
of their conceptualization of the Sacred.     In this vein, socially
acceptable action has always been considered more important than metaphYsical
speculation.   However, in order to truly grasp what it means to be a Hindu,
one must take a further step and say that beyond the acceptance of any
particular doctrine or adherence to certain patterns of behavior, being a
Hindu means identifying oneself ><ith a specific cultural tradition.          Thus

the historian A. L. Basham defines a Hindu as       •••   a man who chiefly bases
his beliefs and way of life on the complex system of faith and practice which
has grown up organically in the Indian sub-continent over a period of at
least three millennia. •12   It is this intangible 'feeling' of belonging,
12 A. L. Basham, 'Hinduism' , The Concise Encvclopedia of Living Faiths, ed.
by R. C. Zaehner, (London, 1959), p. 225

which can not always be put into specific categorical frames of reference,
either doctrinal or behavioral, that lies at the base of a Hindu's self-
identity.   ConseQuently, one may not only hold diverse theological opinions
but also, as is the case with adherents of many bhakti sects, follow
unconventional patterns of behavior and still be considered a Hindu, whereas
if an individual were to convert to Islam, regardless of the similarities
that might exist between the doctrines and patterns of behavior to which he
would adhere as a result of such a conversion and the doctrines and patterns
of behavior ascribed to by certain unconventional bhakti sects, he would
no longer be considered a Hindu, for in claiming himself a Huslim he would
have denied his own cultural tradition.

By presenting Baha'u'llah as an avatara who has come to revitalize
Hinduism as well as the other religions of the world Bah a 1 :L teachers do not
p11t a new declarant in the position of having to deny his cultural heritage,
and in effect he can psychologically remain a Hindu, as Baha'u'llah is not
only the return of' Christ and the 'Host Great Announcement 1 but the
'Immaculate Hanif'estation of Krishna'.      Tberefore, it is tbe author's
contention that altbougb the Baha'i Faith is a universal religion, in tbe
eyes of many of its declarants in Halwa the movement would probably be more
closely identified with what he has termed the bhal,ti tradition.        As
mentioned in Chapter 9, bhalcti movements have often offered alternative
systems of metaphysical conceptualization (often strongly monotheistic) and
provided frame>wrks for 'deviant' behavior, but they have not denounced the
Hindu cultural heritage, both of which are characteristic of the opera-cing
procedures of the Baha' '[ Faith in Halwa.     '!:11is contention seems even more
plausible when it is remembered that to this day Baha'i teachers have not
actively tried to tear down or attack traditional village institutions but
have concentrated on developing independent frames of reference in which
the movement's ideals can be out>rardly manifested.       Conc-equently, it may

well be the bhakti style of approach in contrast to the     r-~ltural   militancy
of Islam or Christianity that has been partially responsible for many
villagers declaring themselves followers of Baha'u'llan.

Another variable which must be weighed when considering this question
is the overall pattern of social conflict that is becoming more characteristic
of Indian society as it tries to adjust to the influences of modernism.
As was noted in Chapter 4, this clash of values has been felt in the rural
areas as well as within the urban centers, and consequently villagers are
continually confronted by the forces of a changing world - ranging in scope
from the more subtle effects of increased technological development to the
more overt manifestations of political activism - to which they must try
and adjust.      This is especially true of younger individuals who are less
able to hide in the shadows of tradition.       Seen in this light, the Baha'f
Faith may well offer the younger generation of villagers (there are
apparently a large number enrolled in Halwa) a synthesis between the past
and the future.      On the one hand, the Baha'1 Faith supposes many of the
principles that are part and parcel of contemporary socit.-L idealism,
particularly the concept of human equality, yet it still preaches the
necessity of maintaining the religious element as a vital dimension of the
hwnan experience.      'l'hus, to many declarants the movement might represent
a means of alleviating the psychological conflicts engendered by the
collision of traditional and modern worlds.

In summation, given the Baha'1 attitude towards Hinduism, the Hindu
ideal of cultural identity, and the changing social scene in contemporary
India, it is safe to posit that many people in rural Halwa are declaring
their belief in Baha'u'llah because such a declaration allows them to
express in a culturally acceptable way their socio-religious attitudes and
feelings, many of which are in conflict ;;ith traditional ideals, without
having to actively negate in word or deed either their cultul'al heritage
01'   the tl'aditional pover structure.

It has already been suggested that the activities of the Baha''L Faith
should be viewed in terms of the movement's futuristic vision.
Nevertheless, the contemporary situation can not be completely ignored, and
it would be helpful, therefore, if some general statements concerning the
present state of Baha''L institutions in the 'model village' communities
could be made.

Looking at the assumptions which underlie Baha''L beliefs and values
in light of the corresponding assumptions of popular Hinduism it is apparent
that the former would be essentially at variance with the latter.      The
core of Baha'i metaphysical doctrine, the indivisibility of the Sacred, is
a case in point.      Although monotheism is by no means alien to Hindu thought,
even on the popular level, its formulation whereby the One Supreme Force
is seen to have numerous forms, is basically at odds with the Baha'2
conception of the Sacred as a transcendent and omnipotent God.      More
importantly, the resulting social manifestations of this difference pose
points of conflict.      The stratification of the Sacred in Hinduism provides
a theological base for status group stratification in the profane sphere
as is borne out by the fact that different status groups have different
primary deities, whereas the strong emphasis placed on the unity of the God-
head in the Baha'i Faith results in a similar emphasis being applied to the
temporal world where normatively all men worship one Creator as brothers.

In a similar fashion, the various Baha'i socio-religious institutions
discussed in this work would theoretically conflict with those of the
traditional system.      The institutions of the Nineteen-Day Feast and the
various holy day observances which stress knowledge of the revealed word and
are lacking in religio-dramatic activity are at variance with traditional
ritualistic and ceremonial institutions whose basic structures and modes
of operation revolve around this type of symbolic performance.     Furthermore,
the Baha'i abandonment of a religious functionary who presides over

devotional activity challenges the traditional assumption which holds that
in order for rituals to be sanctified they must be officiated by a Br~
or other 'clean' caste priest.       Even the institutions of the Local
Spiritual Assembly and community consultation are largely at variance        , for
although democratic ideals and institutions have become part of contemporary
village life, they are still at odds with traditional leadership patterns.

Given the theoretical divergence between the two systems one would
expect that the role of Baha'! doctrines and institutions in the 'model
village' communi ties would be primarily dysfunctional in nature, and as a
result they would either clash with traditional institutions or be isolated
from them.   From the information the author was able to obtain it would
seem that the latter situation is the more prevalent one.     The traditional
social structure does not seem to have reacted adversely to the introduction
of Baha'! institutions into village life but to have set them off as
distinct religious phenomena.       Here two important factors come into play.
The first - to which the author has already made numerous references - is
the Baha'! approach of not directly attacking the traditional system, while
the second is related to Hinduism's ability as a social organism to
categorize and isolate   ~eviant'   behavior.

The Baha'! Administrative Order's policy of gradually introducing
Baha'! values and principles into village life and thereby not forcing new
declarants to violate conventional mores has resulted in Baha'! village
institutions not being strong enough to offer a viable social alternative
to traditional institutions, and consequently at the present time the
movement does not present a threat to the existing social structure.
As the examples cited in the body of this work demonstrate, Baha'i
institutions are still in the formative stages of development.       While
devotional and administrative meetings are held in the name of the
yugavatara they are not reflections of Baha ''i: norms:    feasts and holy day

observances are generally short in duration and centered around 'deepened'

believers;   local spiritual assembly meetings are irregular and dominated
by specific individuals;   and cmmnuni ty consultation is infrequent.              This
is not to say, however, that by following a policy of gradualism the
Balla '1 Administrative Order in India has made a conscious effort to retard
Baha'i: institutional development.      Perhaps by following a more stringent
policy whereby all declarants >wuld be req_uired to renounce old patterns
of behavior and adhere to the letter of the law regarding participation
in Balla '1 institutions a greater degree of structural development might
already have taken place in the 'model village' communities, but the number
of persons accepting Baha 'l doctrines and participating in Bah8. '1

a
activities would be greatly reduced, as the Bah '1 Faith would most likely
be labeled a hostile religion.       As it is, with Bah a'     :r   institutions

reflecting little more than a basic frame\{Ork of           religious' activity,
Baha' '1 teachers can continue to educate new declarants in the application
of the Faith's principles and at the same time be tolerated by the
traditional social system, a supposition which leads to the next point,
namely, Hinduism's ability to compartmentalize 'deviant' behavior.

Although the Indian social system is often regarded as a fortress of
conservatism, historically one of its great strengths has been its ability
to adapt to certain socio-religious challenges by channeling 'deviant'
behavior into specific sociological frames of reference.               Thus, the system
has created institutional safety valves within wbich unconventional
activity can manifest itself without becoming a threat to society at large.
These safety valves apply not only to challenges from outside the Hindu
fold but to innovative developments within Hinduism as \!ell.               rhe former

has resulted in the creation of specific non-Hindu           castes~ 3   while the latter
has produced not only a great range of Hindu castes and subcastes,whose

rules of dharma often vary but the previously mentioned }2P.s.kti sects.
One scholar has gone as far as to say that the adaptive response has been
the primary means by \Ihich Indian Civilization has dealt vith change
throughout the ages.

A striking example on the personal level of this
type of compartmental mentality is an account reported by J. Hichael Nahar
of an elderly Rajput who had kept a Chamar mistress for twenty years.

views on polluting powers of Untouchables, the gentlema.'l replied that he

In terms of the Bahil:' i Faith, then, it would appear that the village
social system has been able to compartmentalize it as a specific 'religious'
phenomenon, which although essentially dysfunctional in nature, can still be

movement may find that its present harmonious relationship wi·th the
village social system could vell change, and that a type of backlash reaction
might set in.    Here this to happen, the Faith might even meet the fate
that other socio-religious movements have met, namely, being categorized as
a specific caste.    This vould mean that in order to declare their belief
in Baha 'u 1 ll8.h or participate in Bah3. '1 activities individuals lrould have
to change status group identification:;cr a predicament that vould no doubt
greatly reduce its follNring as vell as nullify its potential for acting as

institutions in the 'model village' com.munities remain static and do not
develop beyond their present state of r2i'lecting little more than a
structural outline of BahS,'l corrununity life there does not seem much hope
for them becoming strong enough to influence significant behavioral change,
and consequently the Baha' ~ movement in the rural areas vill remain
primarily an ideological set of beliefs "ith little basis in social reality.

It seems, therefore, that Baha' 'L administrators and teachers in

demand for alterna"tive social, religious, and political responses, and the
BahB.'l ideal of combining religious elements with progressive socio-

of the Baha' 0: Faith in Halwa lies in the future.   In fact, it is fair to

Appendix   A

Appendix A

Islam is divided into over seventy-two sects.             The two major divisions,
however, are known as Sunn{ and Shflah, and both groups have their own
beliefs as to the origins of their religions.                                      r

According to the   Sunn~s,   the
~                                   ~
~lah     sect was founded by 1 Abd Allah b. Saba', a Yamanite Jew who was
converted to Islam.       He is supposed to have taught doctrines which regarded
'Ali b. Talib, Mu~ammad's cousin and son-in-law, as being divine. 1 ShfCahs
deny this, claiming that he was an extremist (££ulat), and some maintain
that   1Alf   had him and his followers burnt.         Shl 4 ahs, however, are
themselves divided into a number of different groups, of which the major are
the Isma'flis and the     Ithna!a~arfs.    As the Ithnaia~ar1 branch of Sh1 1 ism
has been the state religion of Iran since the early sixteenth century and
was therefore the basis of the religio-cultural milieu in which both the
Babf and Baha'i movements developed, this appendix will be concerned
primarily with the case of the     Ithna!a~ari        Shf'ahs as presented by
themselves.

The Ithnaia~ar1s (also called rafiz1, or forsakers by Sunnis) believe
that the divine light of which     Mu~ammad   came to be the custodian was eQually
shared by 4Ali, and they base this claim on a number of traditions.               They
attatch great importance to the Prophet's last sermon at Ghadir Khumm where
he had stopped on his return from his last pilgrimage in March 632.                At
this time Mu4ammad took 'Ali's hand and said, 'He of whom I am the mawla

(the patron?), of him 'Ali is also the mawla. •              Shitahs also insist that
during his last illness Mu~ammad asked        1Umar   to provide him with material
to write his last will, but 'Umar avoided the reQuest and thus the testament
was never written.      Moreover, Shi'ahs hold that after         Mu~ammad's   death the

leadership of the community was usurped by Abu-Bakr (one of the most
prominent companions of the Prophet) who was raised to the position of
Caliph (Khilafa- representative of the Messenger of God) by •umar and a group
of followers during a meeting of the religious elite of Medina at which 'Al1
was not present as a result of his performing the last rites for Mu~ammad. 3

According to the Sh1 1 ahs,   1 Al1   disputed Abu-Bakr's right to community
leadership.   The two men's relations were further constrained, moreover,
because of the claim of Fa~imah ( 1 All's wife and Mu~ammad's daughter) to

the property of Fadak , a claim which was disregarded by Abu-Bakr.            After
Fa~imah's death, however,   1Al1   acquiesced to what had become a socio-political
reality and remained busy with his literary activities until the assassination
of the third Caliph, tuthman.

The Caliphate of 'Uthman (644 - 656) was plagued with factional disputes
which finally led to his murder in 656.         After his assassination 'Alf
reluctantly accepted the position of Caliph, but       M~ammad's   favorite wife,
'A'isha, who had opposed the killing of 'Uthman, joined against him in
battle in 656 in what was later to become known as the Battle of the Came1. 5

'Alf's forces were victorious, and 'A'isha later chose to abandon her
leadership.   During the five years of 'All's Caliphate a number of
different parties emerged, and it was also at this time that his followers
consolidated themselves, thus crystallizing the Shf 1 ah sect.         The founding
of the Umayyad Caliphate (660) drove a large number of        1Alf's   followers into

the bosom of   Shf 4ism,   and the murder of 'Alf's son, ijusayn, at Kerbela 6
in 680 permanantly divided the Muslims into Sunnfs, Shf'ahs, and other
different groups.

Although it would emerge from the above discussion that the conflict
between Sunnfs and Shf'ahs started over the question of succession, both
groups evolved their own theological doctrines and theories.           While Sunnfs
regard the first four Caliphs as rightful successors, Shf•ahs maintain that
1Alf   and his descendants are the true imams (supreme leaders) whose rights
were usurped by the first three Caliphs, and around this belief has
developed the politico-theological doctrine of the imama (imamate). 7

Shf'ahs believe that the task of divine guidance does not end with
the death of a prophet, for it is the will of God that the Islamic
community should not be left on its own.        Thus they maintain that a series
of divinely appointed hereditary imams beginning with       1Alf   were assigned
the function of intermediaries.        According to ?asan b. Yusuf b. 'Alf
Ibnu'l-Mutahhar al-Hillf (d. 1325), one of the most well-known Shf 1 ah

scholars, three of the most important issues concerning the imama are:
1) that it is a necessary institution, 2) that the imam must be immune :from
sin, and 3) that the imam must be specified.

From the ~i 1 ah point of view the imama is necessary i'or the same
reason that Prophethood is necessary, namely, so that God can        provide~en

with a leader who by his real knowledge and right actions can guide them

The doctrine of sinlessness is also fundamental to Shf 1 ah belief.
In the words of Mulla Mu~ammad Baqir Majlisf:

In a like manner   al-~illf   concludes:

of him, he would lose his place in men's hearts

and the value of his appointment would be nullified.
Finally, the imam must be specified; that is, he must be appointed by
God and not by the people. 13 Consequently, the imama

The twelfth imam (M~ammad al-ijasan al1Askar1) mysteriously disappeared
in a grotto of a Samarra mosque at the age of perhaps four or five years.
According to his followers he did not die but went into concealment.      The
twelfth imam, therefore, became known as the 'hidden imam', and although
absent (gha'ib) he is considered the true and infallible leader of the
Islamic community:

During the 'Lesser Concealment' (874-940) four men succeeded in establishing
themselves as his envoys (wakhs), the last dying in 940.       At this time
the 'Lesser Concealment' ended and the 'Greater Concealment' began.     Since
940, therefore, Sh'ftah mujtahids began to claim themselves as
representatives of the twelfth imam, a situation which denies supremacy to
secular power and thus gives the mujtahids a type of authority unknown to
the Sunnf 'ulama?

The 'hidden ~· is also considered by Shftahs to be al-mahd1

(the guided one), and he is expected to return (raj'a) before the end of
time and usher in a period of justice and blessedness.         Unlike the Sunnf
mahdl~15, however, he Wl'l1 be the same   M~ammad al-~asan   al1 Askar~" who
disappeared in 874.    He has numerous titles which include al-Hu,jjat
(the proof), al-Muntazar (the one awaited), and Qa'im al-Zaman (the master

was ln such
a climate that the Babf and Baha'f movements raised their heads.

At this point it would be appropriate to compare the Baha'i concept
of the 'prophet' as found in contemporary Baha'i literature with that
found in Islam.    According to the Baha'i view, prophets (or manifestations -

> eschatological figure who has arisen from the needs of the masses
> of Muslims over the ages (The Mugaddimah, vol. II, p. 156- 200),
> is looked upon as a restorer of the faith of Islam, but he will
> restore the concensus of Islam which has been reached by the successive

> Shf'ahs give this right only to the imam mahdf.
16 Qa'im (literally, 'he who arises') is one of the common titles used in

> reference to the imim mahdi. This title was used by Baha'u'llah in
> referring to the Bah who was considered by his followers to be the
> mahdf.
l7 An interesting example of this type of phenomenon was reported by Ibn

> Battuta during his travels in Persia and Iraq. In the city of Hilla
> (not far from Samarra) he reported that believers came daily to the
> local mosque and proceeded to call for the return of the 'Master of
> the Age'. When he did not come they returned to their homes. The
> same process was repeated day after day. For a more complete

mazahir-i-Ilahiyya) are lawgivers and founders of new cycles in religious
history.      There have been numerous manifestations in the past, as there
will be in the future.      Baha'1 literature, however, generally recognizes
nine such independent 'prophets':        Abraham, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha,   ~~~a,

All manifestations are seen to
be in reality one and the same.          Thus it is stated, 'In this respect, if
thou callest them by one name, and dost ascribe to them the same attributes,

thou hast not erred from truth. '
In Islamic theology, both Sunn1 and Sh1 1 ah, there are two types of
a rasUl is a prophet who brings a revealed book ~ while a nabf

prophets:
is one who, while receiving divine inspiration, does not create a new
shar'ftah.     While there have been both kinds of prophets in the past,
Mutammad is believed to be the 'seal of the prophets', as his revelation
as embodied in the Qur'an was complete and final.          In this vein Ibn Khaldun
states:

> All this indicates that the Qur'an is alone
> among the divine books, in that our Prophet
> received it directly in the words and phrases
> in which it appears. In this respect, it differs
> from the Torah, the Gospel, and other heavenly
> hooks. The prophets received them in the form of
> ideas during the state of revelation. After their
> return to a human state, they expressed those ideas
> in their own ordinary words. Therefore, those books
> do not have 'inimitability'   Inimitability is
> restricted to the Qur'an.20
The main distinction, therefore, between the Baha'f and Islamic
concepts of the 'prophet' (at least as far as Baha'i missionary activity
outside the Islamic world is concerned) is that the former asserts that
finality in prophethood (here meaning the revelation of a new Law) was
not reached in M'*ammad but was carried on in the personage of Baha'u'llah,
a belief which takes the movement beyond the pale of Islam.
