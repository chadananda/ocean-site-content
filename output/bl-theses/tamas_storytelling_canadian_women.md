Abstract

Despite the generaliy anti-religious stance of many feminist scholars. religions
which advocate and implement gender equality may enable female believers to resist
oppressive noms. This thesis describes the Baha'i faith as one such religion. An
ernancipatory vision of gender is enunciated in its central scnptures. and has been
implemented. albeit to varying degrees, throughout the faith's history around the
world. The author argues that activism for gender equality has diminished in recent
years in the Canadian Baha'i community. and describes the testing of storyteliing-
based consciousness-raising workshops as a rneans to increase Canadian Baha'i
women's promotion of the advancement of women.

efforts to define a n d o r create woman-positive belief systems. In the second chapter. 1

present the Bahd'i faith as an exarnple of one such system of belief. and argue that the
vision of gender enunciated in its central scriptures may act as an emancipatory force
in the Lives of Baha'i women. The third chapter is dedicated to describing the
implementation of this egalitarian vision in Baha'i communities around the world over
the faith's one hundred and fifty-odd year history. Although oppressive cultural
contexts and prevailing social norms have influenced the community's ability and
inclination to clearly interpret and apply this vision of gender. 1argue thar many
Baha'i women have been empowered and enabled by their f ' t h to resist and challenge
oppressive gender n o m s . Equality-seeking has furthermore been consistently
undertaken and supported by many Baha'i men and administrative structures.
1 propose, however. that this radicalking and emancipatory influence of the faith on
the believers' awareness of and activism on gender issues has been maintained in the
developing world but has significantly diminished in the West since the faith's arrival
at the turn of the century. In the founh chapter. 1 present and describe research
undertaken to test my central thesis: that increasing Canadian Baha'i womens access to
their history of activism through a series of consciousness-raising workshops based
on radical storytelling rnay remedy this slippage in the community's promotion of the
advancement of women.

Pursuing such a study under the auspices of a Canadian Studies program is
somewhat difficult: the Baha'i community is international in character. and although
Canada's particular sociological and geographical characteristics m u t have influenced
the emergence and form of the Canadian Baha'i community. it does not appear to be
clearly differentiated from Baha'i communities in Australia, the United States. or. for the
most part, Europe. Although there may indeed be subtle. disrinctively Canadian
Baha'i characteristics, they have not yet been discovered and investigated: the corpus
of Baha'i scholarship addressing the Canadian experience is minute. The big fish in
this tiny pond is Will C. van den Hoonaard. a sociologist at University of New

Brunswick. upon whose admirable work sections of this thesis have heavily relied. 1

have further sought to reinforce the 'Canadian-ness    of this project by conducting
my own research and testing my cornmunity intervention locally: the extent to which
my findings are influenced by their location is. however. questionable. Sirnilar
observations and results would probably be obtzined in many Bahai comrnunities
throughout the western world. As such, references to American and European Baha'i
scholarship and western Baha'i women's expenence must periodically stand in for
unavailable purely Canadian sources. Hopefully. this thesis will go some way toward
alleviating this dilemma for future students of the Canadian Bahai cornmunity.

Chapter One: The Feminist Study of Religion

Approaches and Methods in Feminist SchoIarship

The academy seems to be resistant to change. to cling to old habits of thoughr
and customs. Nonetheles. for the past thirty years. the roguish seed of feminism has
been thriving in this ordered garden. resisting all attempts to uproot it, blumng the
neat borders between disciplines. infiltrating and upsetting carefuLly composed beds of
theory. forcing scholars ofr the well-trodden paths to struggle in the thickets of thorny
new questions. Even its proponents are unsure what t o cal1 it: while Ursula King says
'ferninisrn is both a new academic method and also a new social vision."' Shulamit
Reinharz. in her exhaustive study. Feminist Methods in Social Research. concludes
that 'ferninisrn is a perspective. not a m e t h ~ d . " ~

Whatever the case may be, feminism has radically altered the face of
scholarship, challenging the rules for both the definition of knowledge and its pursuit.
It insisrs that women's expenences and opinions must be considered. arguing that to
ignore women is

> not simply to ignore a signifiant subgroup within the social structure. It is to
> misunderstand and distort the entire organization of that society.
> hcorporating women's experiences into our social analysis involves far more
> than adding another factor to our interpretation and thus correcting an
> admittedly glaring oversight. It forces us to reconsider our understanding of
> the most fundamental ordering of social relations, institutions and power
> arrangements within the society we study?

Such a fundamental re-orientation will entail both 'changing the criteria for what
counts as knowledgew4and 'the transformation of traditional processes of wnting.

teaching. learning. and thinking", a transformation which is 'inextricably connected to
the subversion of the substance of patriarchal thought.*"

But to 'subvert patriarchd thought' is a complicated t s k . The exclusion of
women's experience of the world from what has been traditionally counted as
knowledge has undermined many women's confidence and magnified their doubts. such
that they "...have Little alternative but to believe the rnyths men have created?
There is, thus. no unity of thought or purpose among women in general. Among
feminist scholars, too, there is much dissension: and in their determination not to
oppress one another. this dissension is permitted to flourish.

Nonetheless, for the most part. feminist scholars seem to agree on the principle

.

that 'constmcting knowledge about ourselves [women] with ourselves as the focal
point. is a high priority in the quest to end wornen's oppression. But we musc be free
to do it in our own wayW7 To that end. feminist scholars have proposed and used a
number of innovative research theories and strategies. re-evaluating the utility of
'experience, intuition. and evaluation as alternative modes of k n o ~ i n ~and

inclusive research orientations and tools has graduaily coalesced into an ever-
evolving, yet distinct set of practices. which (depending which feminist you ask) rnay
or may not be a methodoiogy. but which nonetheless has certain identifiable
characteristics, Six of these will now b2 introduced.

The first tenet of feminist research is chat it must acknowledge the pzrsonal
sources of Our work. Rather than write about women's experience abstractly or in the
third person. feminist scholars are bidden to use personal experience as 'the very
starting point of a study. the material from which the researcher develops questions,
and the source for finding people to study."l       ' Whereas in uaditional research. such
personal expenence is 'thought to contaminate a project's objectivity". in feminist
research. 'it is relevant and repairs the project's pseudo-o bjectivity."        '   In other
words. it prevents the construction of a pretense of objectivity. which. as noted by
Patricia Maguire. 'supposes a kind of schizophrenic researcher ...told to separate feeling
frorn knowing." l3

The personalization of one's work is dso seen as a safeguard against false
generalizations. As stated by June O'Conner. 'It is not enough to tell me what you see.
I wani to know where you are standing as you see and speak. and also why you stand
there."   '   Plaskow and Christ note that. paradoxically enough, it may be through this
avoidance of generaiizations. this 'articulation of particularity and what seems to be
difference, that connection and universality are suddenly revealed."15 Recognizing
that 'al1 knowledge is mediated through the body and that feeling is a profound source

of information about our lives.'16 feminist scholarship challenges the boundaries not
just between 'impersonal" and 'personal' scholarship but between 'objective' and
committed" scholarship as well. As Christ and Plaskow point out. k i t i n g addressed to
Our embodied selves may c d for different forms and strategies than writing addressed
to dispassionate intellects."l7 The researcher's confession and honoring of
his or her own personal interests, perspectives. and b i s e s is one of feminist
scholarship's most fundamental challenges to traditional research methods.

Comrnitted

The corollary to the personalization of feminist scholarship is its engagement.

Feminist scholars assume the oppression of women. and seek to transform. as well as to
understand, wornen's experience.18 As Patricia Maguire notes. feminist researchers
are trying to change the role of the social scientist from spectator a n d o r detached
advisor to involved activist. 'The feminist researcher cannot study women's struggles
from a safe distance. Instead, she [sic] must be a consciously partial and passionate
frcntline participant in the work to construcr a just w ~ r l d . ' ' ~ ~

Researchers express rheir cornmitment to change in a variety of wys: some
argue that "the very acc of obtaining knowledge creates the potential for change
because the paucity of research about certain groups accentuates and perpetuates
their powerlessness."20 Others include strategies for disseminating or implementing
the rindings of their research in the* project methodologies, or use the research
process itself as a social development tool. The vast majority of feminist researchers,

however they may realize it, would agree with Maguire's belief that 'our research must
go beyond documenting 'what is' to proposing an alternative and imaginative vision of
what 'should beY2

But while there is virtual unanimity on the goal, there is less clarity on the
means: a lot of ferninist researchers have insisted that something must be done to
advance the equahty of women and men. but few have suggested precisely what to do.
or how. This lack of agreement on means to effect change may anse from feminist
scholarship's emphasis on diversity and the lack of a generally accepted system for
mediating and uniting the plurality of women's expenences and views. As pointed out
tj-PJâricy   Adarnson. Linda Briskin. and Margaret McPhail.

Non-Objectifying the Subjects

The rejection of 'objectivity has also affected feminist SC holars' relations hips
with their research subjects. Infuriated by the ubiquitous objecrification of women in
patriarchal societies. many feminist scholars express a cornmitment to the ideal of non-
objectihing researcher-participant relationships. in which 'the distinction between the
researcher(s) and those on whom the research is done disappears. To achieve an
egalitarian relationship. the researcher abandons control and adopts an approach of

.

openness, reciprocity mutual disdosure. and shared risk. "23

Such egaLitarian relationships, mirroring Life in their "continuous processes of
attachment and separation. involvement and detachment. identification and

dernand that the researcher relinquish power over and distance frorn
their research subjects. This requires the abandonment of most traditional methods of
data gathering. In their stead. some feminist methodologists ask 'feminist researchers
to engage in 'conversations' with women which. in form. reflect the ferninist research
purpose of CO-operativelycreating a 'sociology for ~ o r n e n ' . " *In

~ these
'conversations'. the researchers are further expected to 'project a genuine acceptance
of the participant's viewpointwin order to create a safe situation for the r e s e a r ~ h e d . ~ ~

The extent of the practicability of these egaütarian ideals is a point of some
debate in ferninist circles. While anti-Objectificationism is a common ferninist cause.
there are those who argue that research projects need not appear to be and c m not
truly be democracies. and that pledging to "project a genuine acceptance" of the views
of research participants may run contrary to the oveniding goals of honesty and
furthering the emancipation of women. when. for instance. the participants manifest
internalized oppression. Nonetheless. while the application of this idea may be
contested, the underlying principle would be accepted by the majority of ferninist
scholars. and their research designs would make some attempt to accommodate it.

Some feminist scholars have replaced the traditional objectification of research
su bjects with an 'epistemology of insiderness. "27 in which the researchers examine
their sirnilariries and differences with the research subject(s) in order to place
themselves on a continuum of 'insiderness/outsiderness.' According to Jotley Bruce
Christman, 3his perspective stresses that it is not the scientific detachment of the

researcher that ensures validity. but knowledge of where one is dong as many
dimensions of that continuum as possible."28

While many feminist scholars advocate alertness to the sarneness andfor
otherness between the researcher and the participants, some furrher propose chat
researchers should cultivate affinity with their subjects: that is. they should actively
seek 'insiderness.' As Shularnit Reinharz explains.

> The requirement that feminists establish rapport stems from the ideology that
> women experience relationships through an ethic of care. and that Feminists. in
> particular, are supposed to be able to establish intimate relations with women
> because of our political awareness. Put even stronger. feminists are supposed
> to feel toward other women as if they are their sisters. the presumption being
> that sisters have profound positive relations and shared     inter est^.^^
This demand for involvement and intimacy with the research subjects may be
premised on the notion that such relationships are less likely to be exploitarive:
however, Reinharz has cautioned that the demand for rapport 'rnay have led us to put
on blinders compelling us to see gender as the most salient characteristic of a woman.
even when the wornan sees it o t h e r ~ i s e . "Furrherrnore.

~~           while supporting the ideal
of rapport. Christman has expressed concern that her research may in fact become an
abuse of friendship:

> A woman gave her story to me in an act of fnendship over tea at a kitchen
> table ...1still took it away From the kitchen table and set it in a context that
> served rny researc h purposes.3

The Researcher as Research Subject

Some ferninist researchers try to avoid this possibility of exploitation by
turning to themselves as research subjects. thus exposing their own wlnerability to

scholarly examination. This often occurs as the researchers seek to identib their own
subjective positions by sharing their experiences of the research process. By
disclosing uthe kind of person that we are. and how we experience the r e s e a r ~ h . " ~ ~
ferninist scholars hope to reveal the conscious and unconscious fitters through which
they have sifted the raw research data.

These attempts to level the researcher-subject hierarchy may be criticized for
failing to produce substantive equality and for focussing on the wrong end of the
problem: as Patricia Maguire insists. 'liberation will corne when ordinary women share
power rather than when powerful wornen share v u ~ n e r a b i l i t y .Voluntary

~~~
vulnerability on the part of the researchers does not necessanly preclude the
possibihty of exploitation.

While sorne feminist scholars see self-study as a necessary complement to work
with external research subjects. others focus solely on their own experience. arguing
that it is the only voice they are entitled to represent and thac they may express truly.
This ultimate extension of subjectivity is seen as the most accurate. albeit limited. form
of research.

Sources

Feminist scholars run into a whole other complex set of problems when they
turn from 'live' research to the study of texts: the main issue being that academic
sources 'record male activities and male deeds in accounts ordered by male values.
What we know of women's past are those things men considered significant ro
remember. seen and interpreted through a value system that places men at the

"women are not only readers of androcentric texts. they are d s o writers and creators of
such texts when they are schooled in and express themselves through the dominant
modes of thinking of their age."35 This problern in the literature has led ferninist
researchers away from traditional sources on a search for alternative records of
women's voices and experiences. This exploration is descnbed by Plaskow as

Perspectives In the Feminist Study of Religion

A Context of Androcentrisrn

The most notable characteristic of feminist work in religious studies is its
premise that it exists 'within an acadernic power structure which is not only male, but
white. heterosexual, middle and upper class. for the most part Christian. and not
particularly hospitable to f e m i n i ~ r n .Feminist

~     that the androcentric
appearance of investigated religions may be at least in part attributable to

In addition to the common concern that
androcentrism in the eye of the beh01der.~~
their work must ' rely to a great extent on texts and data created or described by
men.*40 feminist scholars argue that the traditional theoretical frameworks for the
study of religion are unfit for the analysis of women's experience:

> The unconscious androcentnc presuppositions undergirding almost d l work
> done to date in the history of religions causes serious deficiencies. especially at
> the primary level of data-perception and gathering. and this deficiency in turn
> generates serious deficiencies at the level of model-building and theorizing
> whenever any hint of sexuality or sexual imagery is present in the data being
> andyzed. !

Feminist scholars further complain that 'at present there is often no recognition of
women as agents and participants in their own right in most literature surveys in the
field of religious s~udies."~*
~       h argue

e ~that the discipline has become 'over-
intellectualized" and 'Iext-heavy." and insist that religious scholars must recognize -the
subjectivity and reflexivity of religious s t ~ d i e s . " ~ ~

Despite their readiness to condernn the androcentrism of traditional approaches
to religious studies. feminist scholars have not been quick to propose alternative
theories and methodologies. nor have they challenged the fundamental secularism of
the discipline: as Penelope Margaret Magee notes. 'the academy is essentially secular
and even the most Demdan post-stmcturalists do not tend to deconstruct the secular-
sacred binary opposition."44 This underlying secularism is reflected in ferninist
scholars' approaches to religious scriptures. in which it is assumed that the texts "are
not verbally inspired revelation nor doctrinal principles but histoncal formulations
within the context of a religious c o m r n ~ n i t ~The
. " ~texts

~ are thus taken as cultural         *

artifacts.

It does seem peculiar that feminist theory should have blown down the house
of academe and yet left standing the central pi1la.r of secularism. The notion that
scholars c m and should proceed as if a Divine Being may or may not exist would seem
CO cal1   for the same pseudo-detached 'objectivity' already rejected by feminist theonsts
as requiring a "schizophrenic researcher" whose feeling is separate from knowing. This
skip in feminist theory probably arises from a general discomfort with religious ideas.
which 'are seen as anomalous or difficult to approach from the viewpoint of much
feminist theory and practice.'46 An explanation for this discomfort is offered by King.
who argues that many feminists

> see religion as an external institution. authonty and power structure which
> keeps people in a state of dependence and thereby prevents them from
> acquïring autonomy and the will to actively shape their life and take full
> responsibility for it.47

46 Ibid. p. 101.

This anti-religious tendency is confirmed by Marilyn Chapin Massey and James
Massey, who describe 'a remarkable parallelmbetween the positions taken by some of
the leaders of anti-religious humanism and "significant viewpoints among
contemporary feminist religious thinkers. n48

As a result of its discornfort in the field, Naomi Goldenburg notes that early
feminist scholarship "did little more to address religious matters than to point out how
traditional religions reinforced the subjugation of ~ o r n e n . ' ~King appears to
support this position, maintaining that ferninist histonans have not always paid the
role of religion in women's lives due attention.50 In recenr years, however. the
feminist study of religion has begun to be taken more seriously. as some scholars have
recognized that "religion is not reducible to its cultural matrixw.rhat it uconstitutes an
indienable part of human life."51 and that 'the religious. social. and political are
closely interrelated and cannot be ~ e ~ a r - a t e d At    ~ same tirne. new voices have

The impact of these faith-committed scholars on the underlyng seculansm of the

Activism

As in most fields. ferninist scholars in religion generally undertake their work
with the explicit objective of social change.54 Indeed. as Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza
points out. by working with a text that 'is not just a document of past history but
functions as scripture in present day religious communities." feminisr studies in
religion are. like women's studies, ' by definition already 'engaged'." in that they 'share
both the impetus of historical biblical studies and an explicit cornmitment to a
contemporary group of people, women, who, either religiously or culturdly, are
irnpacted by the traditions of the ~ i b l e This

express it by helping women to 'End inspiration and strength in the rich historicd
data available now on the reiigious activities of women in the past.w57

Many ferninist scholars in religion are also expressly committed to examining
the diversity of women's religious experiences. Judith Plas kow States thar 'the real
impact of our cnticisrn of the universalizing tendency of much theology should be to
send us delving more and more deeply into the experiences of d l kinds of women, -58

and Piaskow and Christ c d 'the increasing chorus of rninority voices ...the single most
important developrnent in feminist work in religion in the Iast ten years."5g It is
unclear how this welcome to the diversity of women's voices and experiences would
hold up if the minority voices in question came to disagree usth the fundamental
approach of feminist scholarship in religion.

Feminists writing in religious studies can be roughly divided into two main
camps: the reformers, who tend to focus o n the transformation of exisring 'mainstream'
religions, and the revolutionaries, who advocare moving out of the mainstrearn
alrogether into a variety of religious alternatives. In the next few pages. both of these
positions will be bnefly examined in turn.

Women in Mainstream Religions

In my reading of the li~erature,three main feminist perspectives on the
position of women in mainstream religions seem to emerge. First. there are those who
argue that 'in mainstream religious traditions most women are rnarginaIized.n60 T h s
marginalization is apparent in the exclusion of women from leadership and educational
opportunities. and in women's relationship to their faith's institutional structures.
Feminists of this view tend to campaign for reforms to ensure that women and men
have the sarne access to such opportunities.

Second. there are those who propose that "women's religious lives and roles
should be investigated and understood as a pacreni of exclusion and parücipafion. " in
which

> at the most generaiized and abstract level. both males and females have access
> to the same experiences and expressions of sacrality. However. on the

concrete. most everyday and visible dimensions of the religious situation. that
> overarching sacrality is reached and expressed by differing, parallel. and
> mutually exclusive rnoàes of religious experience and expression.61

Proponents of this view argue that both men and women have their own exclusive
religious 'turfs'. and that men are rnarginalized in women's religious sphere as rnuch as
wornen are marginalized in men's. Their work, then. focuses on revatuing and
researching women's 'modes of religious evperience and expression" rather than on
getting the same treatment for both genders.

Finally, there are those feminist scholars who take the 'gynocnticd a p p r ~ a c h "

of studying women as "agents creating their own structures of rneaning.w62 Thar is.
they focus on women as makers of religious systems rather than as inert victims within
oppressive structures created by men. As Ruth Compton Brouwer points out.
women's situations are rarely so one-sided:

> Some writers on the subject have emphasized the restrictive and pernicious
> aspects of women's involvement in mainstrearn religion ...More typically. they
> have been interestea in explonng those aspects of religious ideology and
> activity that American women were able to use to enlarge their own lives. In
> religious institutions. sexism was given divine sanction. Even so. [as]
> historians such as Nancy Cott have maintained. there were abundant
opportunities within them for women to find f ~ l f i l l r n e n t . ~ ~
Scholars with this view cal1 for "the formulation of a feminist heuristic frarnework or
mode1 that allows for the oppression as well as for the historical agencywof women in
mainstream religious traditions.64

Each of these three positions impels their supporters toward different lines of
action, or. occasionally. to the same action for different reasons. Thus, feminists
working to reform mainstream traditions are following a variety of agendas. Tracing

who is doing what based on which ideology would be a drzzying piece of work. quite
beyond the scope of this thesis. Let it suffice. then, to crack the lid just enough to get a
whiff of what is going on,

One line of feminist action within mainstream traditions involves moving
beyond motherhood as the wellspring of women's spiritual resources. In nineteenth
century North America. the search "to establish a place for women in religious
terminology. imagery. and valuesw65led to the sacralizing of motherhood and
motherly virtues of self-sacrifice and Love, epitomized by the work of Carharine
Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe, who promoted the image of women as Yiner. more
tender and devoted, and l e s open to ternptation than men?             and thus responsible
for the mord and religious edification of society through their uplifting influence on
their chiidren and husbands. Whiie the idea of female moral superiority represented
progress in the starus of women. in recent years i t has been rejected by some feminist
scholars as confining women to the materna1 role and perpetuating hierarchal
thinking. In its stead. feminist theologians slich as Rosernary Radford Ruether argue
that women in mainstrearn traditions should develop cornmunities based on sisterhood,
as 'sisterhood stands for the opposite of male hierarchies and power structures of
dominant and subordinate. It is associated with communal egalitarian values. -67
More radical thinkers like Mary Daly have also made the building of sisterhood the
focus of their strategies for religious reform.

Another line of attack taken up by some ferninists in the field involves altering
a n d o r adding to a faith's scriptures in order to ensure that women's experiences are
reflected. They argue that reclaiming women's religious history through 'the search
for roots, for soiidarity with Our foresisters, and Finally for the memory of their

existing reügious authorities and structures by demanding full participation as well as
public recognition of the many-sided and varied work already done by women in
religious institutions. "69 Furthermore, they echo Carol Christ's insistence that
"psychic damage is done to the sexual identity of those who never find the experience
of their own sex reflected in the text o r tradition. and who must always appropriate
texts and traditions rnediated through the experiences of those of the opposite sexm70
As a solution, they propose that scholars produce supplemental scriptures expanding
and reworking women's stories from a feminist perspective. through a process of
'remembering and inventing. w7

On a related tack. many feminists working within mainstrearn traditions pour a
great deal of energy into 'God-talkw. or the search for acceptable labels for the Divine.
According to Charlotte Perkins Cilman. patriarchai religions         -   that is. Christianity and
Judaism at least, if not al1 "organized" religions - project 'a God of violence. wrath.

Despite the glaring Eurocentrism of these arguments, and the self-contradictory claim
that patriarchal religions are inferior because of their allegiance to hierarchal dualities.
many ferninists support this analysis of traditional God-language. and insist that the
internakation of this male God h a induced women to evoke "cosmic support of male
nilership of the earth" and to renege on their 'own woman identity.n74

The way out of this situation, they claim, is to uremind ourselves that al1

then go on to suggest a range of new terminologies.

Women Outside of the Mainstrearn

For many ierninists. these and other efforts to root androcentrism out of
mainstream faiths prove insufficient. Carroll Smith-Rosenburg argues that the more
assertively feminist one is. the tess easily one remains in mainstream religions. and the
more likely one is to pursue alternative modes of religious expression.77 This pursuit
of religious alternatives has given nse to all sorts of religious experimentation.

innovation. appropriation. and adaptation. as feminists have sought acceptable
vehicles for connection with the sacred. Often. the resulting religious constructions
are called "marginal." dthough. of course. the location of rnarginality depends on where
one has placed the centre.

The eurocentrism which appears to plague the ferninist study of religion results
in the conflating of Christianity (or, at best, Judeo-Chistianity) wirh mainstream
belief. although most women in the world and an ever-increasing proportion of women
in North Amenca and Europe do not corne from Judeo-Christian cultures.
Furthermore, while the lirerature of feminist religious exploration does document the
appropriation of certain practices and ideas from 'Eastern" faiths. there appears to be
little feminist investigation of non-Judeo-Christian major world religions as potential
religious options. The experiences of Western women who become Buddhist. Musürn,
Hindu, Sikh. BahCi. etc.. or women who cross between Christianity and Judaism.
appear not to have received much attention from feminist scholars. This may be a
refiection of an underlying feminist anti-religiousness, which assumes that women's
participation in such "organized religions" entails their CO-optionby patriarchal
s t r ~ c t u r e s .If~ d~ l religions are developed by cultures. and all cultures are
patriarchal. such an assumption may be justified: however. these prernises and their
supporting arguments do not seem well represented in the iiterature.

Instead. studies of feminist religious exploration tend to focus on new religious
movements with generdy Christian origins, founded by women. Historically. these
studies examine such groups as the Shakers. Theosophists. Quakers. and Christian
Scientists. which emerged in North Amenca in the nineteenth century. and attracted
many %sr wave ferninists", who found consolation and inspiration in the teachmgs of
a Father-Mother or genderless God. The denial of the existence or significance of the
body in some of these movements held the promise of further liberation for wornen
whose bodies had been "conceived as the site of sinfulness and a sinful nature."79

Currently, however. most feminist exploration outside of the Judeo-Christian
mainstream has moved farther away from its theological roots. New feminist theologies
and spiritual alternatives tend to prefer Goddess to God: to affirm both the body and
the spirit; and to emphasize immanence, fmding the Divine wirhin, community. and
c o n n e c t e d n e ~ s . There

~ ~ is an increasing insistence. perhaps championed most
notably by Mary Daly and her supporters. that women must leave the church en
masse and forge rheir own non-hierarchal, ernpowering religious comrnunities based on
sisterhood and a new feminist theological vision. At the same time. woman-positive
Wiccan covens are becoming increasingly popular in feminist circles. promising a
return to pre-Christian and presumably egalitarian or matriarchal traditions. Another
emerging feminist religious trend involves blending a variety of Hindu. Buddhist. First
Nations, and New Age beliefs and practices into a flexible. often agnostic. pantheist. or
animist. unstnictured 'personal" faith.

These movements, typicaily discussed under the rubric of 'ferninist
spirituality." are descnbed by Cynthia EUer as accepting anything that makes women
stronger as valid. and as assuming "that women have access to an unperverted
spirituality. one that cm prove revolutionary not only to women. but to the
world.w82 In this regard. they seem to bear a surprising iesemblance to nineteenth-

Con clusion

The emergence of alternative feminist methods of scholarship. and their
application by feminist scholars to the study of religion. has taken on a sense of
urgency fueled by both the continued oppression of women and by the current
spiritual clirnate. According to Ursula King, people - borh women and men - are iri
search of 'wholeness" and a 'sense of meaning and purpose which can direct their
thoughts and actions."84 While it may be argued that this is the eternal human
condition. she suggests that our spiritual angst is unusually severe. as 'questions
never asked before, problems never encountered in the past, possibilities never
envisaged confront us in most unsetrling and perturbing ways.w85 Mainstrearn
religions. which 'have given countless millions a pattern and a language with which to
make sense of their own selves. of others. and of the world around thernWg6have been
rejected by many feminists and are seen by others as in need of radical renewal: in any
case, they are not the source of comfort and confidence that they once might have been
for many people. As new questions multiply and old answers fail. the contemporary
world suffers 'an immense spiritual h ~ n ~ e r . " ~ ~

This spintual hunger may be one motivating force behind the increasing ranks
of feminist scholars who are turning their attention to the study of religion. These
scholars. however. are also motivated by their recognition that 'gender and religion

The main goal of ferninist religious revision and innovation has often been to
develop belief systems in which women exercise b o ~ h-spiritual or moral authority and
administrative. institutional authority: while charismatic women have from time to tirne
gained some religious power through their "direct expenence of the sacredw.they are
typically "not deemed capable of exercising religious leadership in the ways that are
institutionally routinized' in 'patriarchalV religions.90 Catherine Wessinger has
argued that 'routine. non-charismatic religious leadership by women" rnay be possible
in religions which perceive the Divine as androgynous. bisewual. or
unanthropomorphized: temper or deny the Christian doctrine of -the Fall"; deny the
need for ordained clergy: do not see marnage and motherhood as the only proper
sphere for women: and prornote ' a social expectation of the equality of ~ o r n e n . "In~ ~

teachings, it will be demonstrated that the Baha'i faith fits within these critena.

In recognition of the impermanence of leadership gains made by women. many
feminists seek a more fundamental shift in religious thinking. arguing that a 'ferninine
ethicsn based on moral feelings. desire. and non-judgmental moral reception must be
developed to counterbalance the "masculine ethics" of moral reasoning which have
beeri dominant.      One main feature of such a "ferninine ethicswis the honoring of
diffecence; as Christ and Plaskow state,

Such a world cannot emerge solely from gynocentric religious innovations, based only
on the experience of women: as Anne          E. Carr argues. following the feminist
deconstruction of error and reconstruction of reality from a feminist perspective. we
must work to develop general theories and unifying frameworks based on the
experiences of both genders.g5 Ferninist religious innovation musr therefore
ultimately rnove toward including men and male experience as =contributing to the

In general. however. the specific goals of feminist research and activisrn in
religion are necessarily vague. Shulamit Reinharz explains that 'vagueness is
warranted because Our vision and imagination are lirnited by c u r e n t experience. 97
Nonetheless. this vagueness seerns to pose no deterrent to the ranks of intrepid
feminist scholars and activists committed to questioning and creating knowledge to
transform our religious views and practices. In this grear venture. feminists are both
mu tually supportive and contradictory. However, as Ursula King observes.

Chapter Two: The Bahai Vision of Gender

Pis Ursula King described in the previous chapter. many feminists. spurred by
a widespread and 'immense spiritual hungern,are seeking palatable religious belief
systerns. Their search has resulted in efforts to either reform farniliar reiigious
traditions, or to design creative religious innovations. While many women may be
fulfded by the results of these processes, many others are left unsatisfied. In this
chapter. the Baha'i faith wiil be introduced - a new dish. as it were. on the religious
buffet - which offers a vision of gender that many of those 'spiritudly hungry" may
End appealing.

A Brief Introduction to the Bahal Faith

The Baha'i laith originated in Persia in 1844. when a young merchant called the
Bab declared himself as a spiritual reformer. and heralded the immanent amval of the
Promised One. whose teachings would usher in a new world order. He did not advocate
Islarnic renewal: rather, he clairned a new, independent Divine revelation. He attracted
many followers, both male and fernale. thousands of whom were killed as heretics.
Ultimately. the Bab himself was executed in 1850.

Three years later. one of the most prominent of the Bab's followers, an
imprisoned nobleman who came to be known as Baha'u'llah. had a vision in which he
discovered that he hirnself was this teacher whose advent the Bab had predicted. Upon
his release from prison. he and his family were banished to Baghdad. Shortly following
their amival. Baha'u'llah withdrew to the mountains and lived for two years in
seclusion. During this period, he began revealing a body of work to which he
continued to add throughout his life, and which would eventually fil1 many volumes.

including a Book of Laws, the Book of the Covenant. hundreds of tablets and prayers.

as well as shorter pieces. These writings of Baha'u'llah, which have been preserved in
the original. constitute the central scriptures of the Baha'i fdth, in addition to the
writings of the Bab, and those of Bah&illlah's son and successor. 'Abdu'l-Bah&

In 1863. after a peaceful interlude, Baha'u'llah and his family were hrther
banished from Baghdad. Prior to their departure. he publicly proclairned himself to be
the Promised One foretold by the Bab. As he had already been operating as the de
facro leader of the Babi cornmunity. the vast majority accepted his clairn and declared
themselves to be Baha'is (Literally. followers/seekers of the iight/glory). After some
time in Constantinople (Istanbul) and Adnanople (Erdine. Turkey). he and his family
were ultimately consigned to the Ottoman prison-city of Akka, on the Mediterranean
coasr in Palestine. There Baha'u'llah lived the rest of his life. gradually rnoving from his
cell. to house arrest, to a srnall estate on the outskirts of the city, where he died in
1892\.

Although the authorities had hoped by these imprisonments to crush this faith
in its infancy. they were not successful. A steady strearn of pilgrims came on foot from
Persia, and carried tablets and letters back and forth. Thus. when 'Abdu'l-Baha
assumed leadership of the Baha'i community in 1892. as stipulated by his father's will,
the community was already established throughout the Middle East and had spread to
parts of Africa and India.

In the early l9OO's. following a revolu tion in Turkey. 'Abdul-Baha was freed
afier 58 years of imprisonment.     Shortly thereafter. he traveUed to Egypt. Europe and
America. During his tenure, the Bahai faith spread to North and South America.
Australia. Japan, Hawaii. Europe. and parts of Africa. Following his death in 192 1.
Guardianship of the BahBY faith feli to his grandson. Shoghi Effendi. upon whose

passing leadership of the Baha'i community was taken on by an administrative system
designed by BahA1u'llBh. This system of appointed advisors and authoritative elected
assernblies at the local, national, and international level has administered Baha'i affairs
since 1963, and operates at the international level from the Baha'i World Centre in
Haifa, Israel.

Today. 80% of d l Baha'is are found in the Third World and over 1400 social and
econornic development programs are offered world-wide. According to the Brittanica
Yearbook for 1992, the Baha'i faith is the second most widely spread religion in the
world.' Sorne of the central principles of the faith include: that there is one.
unknowable Creator: that a l l religions have emanated from this same Creator and are
therefore inherently one: that science and religion must agree: that tmth must be
independently investigated: that wornen and men are fundamentally and absolutely
equal; that prejudices based on race. creed. nationality. and colour must be abolished:
that extremes of wealth and poverty must cease: and that education must be universal.
Baha'i laws. although not particularly numerous. include the requirement of daily
prayer and an annual period of fasting: prohibit extra-marital sex and the use of drugs
and alcohol: and set simple guidelines for commemorating Bahai mamages and deaths.
In addition. the Bahai scriptures describe the purpose of life. the nature of the soul.
the requisites of spintual growth, and provide responses to most theologicd and many
practical questions. The Baha'i teachings do not advocate separation from this world
but rather require active engagement in the world and an ethic of service. Baha'is seek
the transformation of civilization and the realization of world peace in a unified gIobal
society. They do not see their faith as the final answer but anticipate the arriva1 of
another divine teacher in the distant future.

Women and Men in the Baha'i Teachings

Unhke other major world religions, the Baha'i scriptures unequivocaily                   assert
that 'wornen and men have been and will aiways be equal in the sight of ~ o d . "Both

Thus. the human sou1 has no gender. "To accept and observe a distinction
which God has not intended in creation", BahA'is are counselled. "is ignorance and
~uperstition."~

Thus, men and wornen are described as essentiaily the same.

At the same time, Baha'i sc~pturesacknowledge rhat this reality is not reflected
by past or curent circumstances. The systernatic subordination of wornen. as
evidenced in lack of access to opportunities for education: violence and abuse at home
and in society: discrimination in incorne-producing opportunities and farnily decision-
making; inequality in, or exclusion from, econornic and political power structures; male
conrrol (and unaccountable use of) ïamily resources: and sole. socially unsupported
responsibility for child-rearing, are al1 "undermined by explitit Baha'i laws and social
principles. "6 As pointed out by M m h a Schweitz,

Thus, in addition to stating equaüty as a spiritual reaüty. the Baha'i wntings assert that
it must becorne practiced. and include provisions for ensuring that it does.

The vision of equaüty enunciated in Baha'i teachings "is not based on women's

The emancipation of women is further identified as "one of the most important.

though l e s acknowledged prerequisites of peace." In an O ften-quo ted statement. the
Bahd'i international goveming body asserts:

As the realization of world peace and interpersonal unity are highly valued in the
BahSi teachings, this places a heavy irnperative on promoting the advancement of
women. The domination of males and "so-calIed male attributes" such as force,
aggression. temtoriality. and the like. are seen as largely responsible for the dire
crises now facing humanity. l

Why Inequaliry Exists

Baha'i theology argues that God successively sends Divine guidance to us
through Manifestations. which appear at humanity's various developmental stages.
reiterate the same essential spiritual teachings (albeit in varying degrees of
sophistication), and provide social laws appropriate to the needs of the time. Some
Baha'i authors maintain that. while previous religions taught spiritual equality. the
Bahi'i faith is the first to teach social equality.18

In any case, the Baha'i writings clearly descnbe women's history of oppression.

whiie at the same time highlighting women's agency in shaping history. despite their
circumstances. 'Abdu'l-Baha often recounted the exploits of past notable queens.
female philosophers. poets. warriors and scientists, as evidence of women's inherent
equality, and further stated that

> it is well established in history that where woman has not participated in
> human affairs the outcornes have never atrained a state of completion and
> perfection ....every influential undertaking of the human world wherein woman
> has been a participant has attained importance. This is histoncally tme and
> beyond disproof even in religion. l

Generally. the appearance of inequality is attributed by the Baha'i writings to
two causes. The firsr and most frequently noted of these is lack of education and
opportuniy 'She is the coadjutor of man. his complement and he1prneet.- 'Abdu'l-
Bah3 says,

> Borh are human: both are endowed with potentialities of intelligence and
> embody the virtues of humanity. In al1 human powers and functions they are

Without doubt. education will establish her equality with men. -20

'Abdu'l-Baha often emphasized that wornen would demonstrate an equal capacity for
scholarship and the same capacities and abilities as men if given equal access ro
education.

The second cause for the appearance of inequality mentioned by the Baha'i
writings is the importance of force and bodily strength in previous ages. 'The world in
the past has been ruled by force. and man has dominated over woman by reason of his
more forceful and aggressive qualities both of body and mind." 'Abdu'l-Baha a ~ s e r t s . ~ ~

Reproduction. Sexuality. and the Family

As already noted, many aspects of Baha'i law appear to support this lack of
'discrirnination or favor'. Although a thorough examination of this topic exceeds the
present need, it may be worthwhile to briefly discuss the Baha'i laws regarding
sexuality. reproduction, and the farnily. as an area in which the seeds of inequitable
treatment are often deeply rooted.

Refraining frorn extra-marital sex is clearly required of both men and women by
Baha'i law. and no differentiation between the genders is made in this regard. By
extension. sexual harassrnent and sexual assault in any context. including within
marriage, are both condemned. as is female genital                               Furthermore. the
concept of 'ritual impurity', panicularly as applied to mensrmating women. is
abrogated by Baha'i scriptures.

Either sex is explicitly given the right to freely choose their partner and to propose
marriage, but the consent of both partners' parents must be obtained before the union
c m take place. The marriage vow consists of a mutual confession of submission to
God's will, rather than submission to one another. A small dowry is prescribed. given
by the man to the wornan. symbolizing her right to independently own property.26
Although strongly discouraged in the scriptures, both women and men have the right
to seek divorce. Thus. many of the inequities ingrained in marriage customs worldwide
are abrogated by Baha'i law.

Regarding reproduction, Baha'i texts assert that the sou1 joins the body at the
moment of conception and the fetus is fully human. Thus. abortion 'merely to
prevent the birth of an unwanted child" is forbidden. However. deciding whether or
not to terminate a pregnancy is left "to the consciences of those c ~ n c e r n e d . "and

~ ~ the
texts anticipate that there will be circumstances in which abortion is warranted. either
by medical concems or in cases involving rape. In the latter case. should a woman
decide to keep the resulting child, under Baha'i law she is free ro claim financial support
from the Farher, while he is given no parental rights.Z8

As a corollary, Baha'i men and women are free to use birth control: however. as
the primary purpose of marriage is seen as the production of children. permanent
sterilization or the use of birth control to prevent any reproduction is not supported
by Baha'i s ~ r i ~ t u r e s . ~ ~

A considerable body of Baha'i texts address the inner workings of the family.

which is seen as "the nation in miniaturew,and thus highly influentid in s ~ c i e ~ . ~ ~
According to the Baha'i ideal. the family should be neither patriarchd nor
authoritarian. The writings assert that the mother, father. and children each have
their nghts, obligations. and prerogatives, and that authority musL not be exercised
arbitrarily3                                                             .

Decision-making is to be achieved consultatively with each partner
deferring to the other at tirnes, and neither dominating the other?

Both women and men are expected to have a profession. calling. or occupation.

In addition. however, women are told that they should. if possible, 'be with the baby
to train and nurture it in its earliest days and r n o n t h ~ . ' ~The

~ early education of
children is discussed prirnarily as the responsibility of the mother. 'whose unique

Although apparently quite traditional. this division of labour differs from
current norms in several respects. First. women are given the right to decide on how
to combine mothering with other occupations, as well as the right to decide that
homemaking is their occupation. As a corollary to t h s . childreanng is seen as more
important than renumerative work:

In combination with the previously discussed principtes for decision making, this
orientation ought to ensure that husbands do not have greater power in the family
than their (perhaps temporarily) non-wage earning wives.

Women are thus given primary responsibility for childrearing. but they are
not given sole responsibility: indeed. men's duties in this regard are seen as so weighty
that a father who neglects his responsibility to educate his children 'forfeits his right of
f a t h e r h o ~ d .Furtherrnore.

~~~          'childrearing' does not include all other domestic tasks
usuaily assigned to women. This is exemplified by Baha'u'llah himself who. in
contravention of prevailing social ncrms. is known to have cooked for his family over
several years.38 It is also worth noting that spouses are clearly permirred to switch
roles if they so choose.

Differences Be tween Women And Men

Although, as previously mentioned. women and men are spiritually identical.

several passages in the wntings seem to impIy inherent and permanent gender traits.
While these distinctions may apply only to our current state. in which the masculine
and feminine elements aïe not balanced within women and men. it is interesting to note
that 'in each of these distinctions. the feminine attributes cited are viewed not as signs
of weakness or as alternative virtues, but as additional and as indications of

In addition to these differences in charactenstics. the Bah& writings envisage
some difference of functions, as ülustrated by the previous discussion of gender roles
in parenting. On this topic, the House of ~ u s t i c ehas

~ ~said:
> Equality between men and women does not. indeed physiologically it cannot.
> n e a n identity of functions. In some things women excel men. for ochers men

> that 'Abdu'l-Baha has stated that in this Dispensation 'Equaiity of men and
> women. except in some negligible circumstances. has been fully and
> categoricaily announced?

One 'negligible circumstance' which bears closer examination is the
participation of women in positions of Bah8.i leadership. As there are no clergy in this
faith. community leadership is taken on by two institutions. each of which operates at
the local, regional, national. and international levels. One of these institutions consists
of advisors. appointed for set terms. who act as individuals but have no power to enact
decisions: the international level of this institution is the highesr ranking office in the
Baha'i administrative struc t ~ r e The

. ~ ~O ther institution consists of elected councils.

which collectively decide on d l matters concerning the community. but whose
individuai members have no special starus o r authority. The decisions of the council
at the international level. the Universal House of Justice. are taken by Baha'is as
divinely inspired. Wornen and men are equally eligible for rnembership in al1 of rhese
positions except the House of Justice.

This exclusion. to many observers. does not seem 'negligible'. Women's access
to positions of leadership is seen âs an essential indicator of a tradition's patriarchal
tendencies. However. several mitigating factors bear consideraiion before a prejudicial
interpretation of this exclusion is adopted.

When asked to explain this exclusion. 'Abdu'l-Baha responded that the reasons
for it would become clear in the future.53 Bahavishave been assured that it does not
stem from some lack on the part of women. nor does it imply superiority on the part of
men.54 hdeed, a 'fundamental principlen of the Bahai teachings is that whenever a
group of people is singled out for some roie or station in the faith it is nor because of
their intrinsic s ~ ~ e n o r i t y ~ ~

W M e in the secular world. leadership. responsibility, and control are
associated with power and privilege, and such offices are actively sought by
individuals, this is not the case in the Baha'i systern. Electioneering and campaigning
are brbidden by the election structures, and individual ambition is seen as rendering
candidates unsuitable. No one seeks mernbership on Baha'i governing councils. Those
elected to serve in such capacities may benefit from the respect associated with their
office. but enjoy no consequent personal rewards. Indeed. given the demands of the
position. few Baha'is sacrifice as much and have as little persona1 autonomy as those
ser~ingon the Universal House of Justice.

Viewed in this light, it is possible to concede that this exclusion may not be
inconsistent with belief in the equdity of women and men: rather than being offensive.
it is merely puzzling. It is also worth noting that the House of Justice is envisaged as
working in the future as part of a tripartite elected system of world government:
wornen have not been excluded from membership in the legislative and executive arms
of this   stem.^^

Approach to Promoting Equali ty

The Baha'i writings indicate that establishing the equality of women and men
will require broadly-based change. 'It has widespread implications," the House of
justice has said, 'which affect and remold dl dimensions of human activity. It cdls for
a fundamental change in the manner in which people relate to each other..."j7
'Abdu'l-Baha emphasized that the required transformation of econornic. social. and legal
structures, as well as underlying attitudes, is now timely, and must not be put off to
some future date?

The writings clearly require Baha'is ro show initiative in promoting the
required change. beginning within the community, which many believers see as a sort
of workshop 'where men and women from diverse backgrounds attempt to put this.
among other Baha'i teachings, into practice.'5g As one Baha'i author has pointed out.
'though they are avowed adherents, Baha'is themselves are engaged in a gradua1

shape and success or failure of the community's efforts on this front will be examined
in chapter three: interpreting these efforts, however. requires some background
information about methods and approaches to equality-seeking recommended by the
BahCi writings.

The writings contain several practical suggestions for promoting the
development of 'full partnershp" between women and men, and modiMng those
'harmful habits" which o b s t n ~ c progress

techniques share three characteristics. First, they adopc a gradual. phased approach.
irnplementing 'long term ... systematic plans."62 As described by the House of Justice.

> Change is an evolutionary process requiring patience with one's self and
> others, loving education and the passage of time as the believers deepen their
> knowledge of the principles of the Faith, gradually discard long-held traditional
> attitudes and progressively conform their h e s to the unifying teachings of the
> ~ause.~3

This strategy. of course 'has provided abundant ammunition to antagonists of the
Baha'i faithtmb4who may interpret small steps as indicators of hypocrisy or weakness
of resolve. From the BahCi perspective. however. gradual implementation is the only
way to ensure lasting results.

A second characteristic of the Bahd'i approach is that it requires broadly-based
change. The oppression of women is not seen as an isolated phenornenon. but as
existing within a mesh of unhealthy social and individual practices: rather like a
presenting symptom of a systemic illness. Effectively and universally establishing
equality thus requires that 'it is pursued in conjunction with al1 the other aspects of
Bahai life?

Findy. the Baha'i approach to promoting equality is characterized by a
'conviction that change must be a u n i b n g force. leading towards full partnership of
men and wornen - and beyond this to the unity of the hurnan farnily.'66 Maintaining
unity is believed to attract 'spirituai blessingswand to reinforce the efficacy of Our

This orientation toward change challenges widely accepted and ingrained traditions of
adversarial merhods. The prescribed emphasis on unity. however. 'is not to be

It is worth noting that 'demonstrations of force'. by either women or men. would. in
the Baha'i context. be considered inappropriate in any case other than self-defence. On
the other hand. 'Abdu'l-Baha has commented that 'among the miracles which
distinguish this sacred dispensation is this. that women have evinced a greater
boldness than men when enlisted in the ranks of the Faith": and Shoghi Effendi. his
successor. has pointed out that this 'boldness' must 'be more convincingly

The final agency given specific duties in the promotion of equality is the Baha'i
administration. 'Abdu'l-Bah2 instnicted that -the members of the Spiritual Assem blies

The Ferninine

In order to properly understand the Baha'i vision of gender. it is necessary to
investigate both its treatment of women and its perspective on the feminine. as the
oppression of one is often associated with the deprecation of the orher. Conversely.
the elevation and reinterpretation of the feminine is seen by many ferninists as
essential to the advancement of women.

In the Baha'i writings, a variety of feminine images may be found. including the
association of the earth with the ferninine. as "the Queen of Carmel". God's holy

source language permits, the Creator is referred to with gender-neutral pronouns. We

Manifestations of God over time. This Revelation. in Baha'i scnptures. is personified

one commentator has noted. 'she enables us to ...tap into the root of transformation -
the feminine power of the Revelation to give birth, to create anew. 7

In addition to Revelarion's ferninine personification, the voice of revelation, the
text itself, is feminized as the "Mother Word" which 'is the channel of divine power. of
transformation ... as well as of the wonderful arts and sciences on which civilization
prides itself. It is the power of life in the world of ~ r e a t i o n . "Relative

the believers are conceptualized 'as children at the breast. taking our        fi^."^^   The
ferninine thus is associated with the voice of revelation, and with its 'inner meaning'?'

> Progressive Revelation [is] the continuous and ceaseless Ferninine unfolding of
> the Masculine WiU of God through an unending procession of Messengers in
> which the Divine Marriage of the Masculine and Ferninine has taken place.91

While caution must be observed - these musings cake place in commenrary on the
scriptures, and are in no way authontative - it is clear that the writings offer powerful
images of the feminine Divine, and that these images occur in interaction with
masculine forms. This interaction occurs in a context of both/and, rather chan

and the feminine advocared by the Baha'i writings. and offers images of the ferninine

associated - but rather in images of spiritual fecundity. which may hold greater
liberaüng potential.93

It bears mentioning that the maleness of the known manifestations of God
(considered by Baha'is to include Baha'u'Uah. the Bab. Mo harnmed. Jesus. Moses.
Buddha, Krishna. Zoroaster, and others, from the beginning of human history) is

As a cornmon component of philosophical discourse at the time of the Bahai
revelation, the central figures of the faith occasionally adopted terminology which
divided creation into 'active" and 'passive" elements. Typically. corresponding
ass~ciationsto the masculine and the ferninine were applied. with the feminine (and
thus women) ubiquitously linked to the passive element. However, in the Bahai
scriptures this paradigm is handled differently: humanity and God and the Divine
manifestations are conceived of as al1 simultaneously active and passive. masculine and
ferninine; both elements have equal roles, and neither is more associated with women
than with men. While the feminine is often seen exclusiveiy as a passive or receptive
element in other traditions. in the Bahai cosmology it serves 'as an acriïe principie.

Before concluding this investigation of the feminine in Baha'i scnptures. it is
worthwhile to briefly consider the writing's treatrnent of the fernale body. Most
significant. perhaps. in this regard, is that 'Abdu'l-Baha abrogates entirely the ancient
association of the Original Sin wirh women and the feminine. thus healing 'a radical

hterpretation and Conclusion

The Baha'i scriptures. in my view. enunciate a vision of gender with powerful
liberating potentiaiities. Accessing this vision. however. requires interpretation: and
interpretation can sometimes be problematic.

The most senous difficulties in this regard arise from language itself. Those
revealing scnpture must clothe Cod's perfect will in human. imperfect languages.
Many - if nor all - languages currently in use were developed in patriarchal contexts.
by men in societies with masculinist values. The reader of scripture must therefore be

wary of language*~
Happily for the Bahd*is. the Universal House of Justice is empowered to dispense
authoritative clarifications and explanations of the meaning of texts which are unclear
due to linguistic changes.

An example of this problem may be found in the translation of references to
God from the original Persian or Arabic into English, in which Cod-names tend tu have
been masculinized. both by the the use of 'He" in its generic sense and by the de-
emphasizing of ferninine or neutral God-names (Creator. Fashioner. Nurturer.
Consoler, Beloved. etc.). 1°1 The generic 'He' is particularly troubling ro rnany
believers. as current trends in ferninist thought and language usage have argued
strongly against such use. However. the Baha'i administration does not intend to re-

'O0 Rouhani Mavani. -Linguisric Gender B i a s e ~ p.

translate the texts using gender-neutral terms. perhaps because their primar-y concern
is to remain scmpulously faithful to the source documents. Bahais envision the
eventual creation of a world auxiliary language, in which, it is hoped. such
troublesome gender associations will not exist.

Another dilemma confronting Baha'is in their interpretation of the teachings is
that. while ail of the central texts are widely avadable in many languages. a great deal of
the Baha'i scnptures is still unavailable in English, as linguists painstakingly Iabor to
accurate@ translate the original documents. This mass of untranslated material
includes rnany tablets wntten by Bahau'lléih to or about Baha'i women. which have not
yet been published even in the original language.lo2

Nonetheless, the believer takes it on faith that whatever is as yet untranstated
will not fundamentally contradict that which already is: if the appearance of a
contradiction were to emerge. the House of Justice would provide the necessary
reconciliation. Indeed. as one Baha'i author has noted. 'no enlightened believer in
Baha'u'llah's Revelation will accept a prejudicial interpretation of the holy text. ~ 1 0 3
Thus. the teachings' egalitarian vision of gender appears secure.

At the end of chapter one. Catherine Wessinger's mteria for religions which
promote women's leadership were introduced: that they envision an androgynous,
bisexual. or unanthropomorphized God: that they temper or deny the doctrine of 'the
Fall"; that they deny the need for ordained clergy: that they don't confine women
exclusively to domestic roles: and that they promote a social expectation of equality.
In this chapter. it has been dernonstrated that the Baha'i teachings meet these criteria.
and promote the advancement of women not only in religion but also in the secular
world.

'O2 Rouhani Matani. 'Religion and the Myrh of Male Superiority.' p. 21.
'O3 Rouhani MaPani.-Linguisic Gender Bisses.. p -55.

Tt is unsurprising. therefore, that many Baha'i women   - and men - have
experienced these teachings as a powerful promoter of gender equality in their own
iives. In order to be effective, however, a teaching must be both understood and
irnplemented. In the next chapter, we will consider the extent to which this has
actually happened.

Chapter Three: Baha'i Women's Expenence of Gender

Eastern Origins

Iran - then Persia - in the late 1800s was not a nice place to be a woman. As
described by Ann Boyles.

> women were treated as chatte1 or as mere reproductive vessels. were held
> virtually as domestic prisoners, and were not deemed worthy of any formal
> education that would equip them for any role in greater society - or indeed. that
> would adequately prepare them to be the educators of their own children ....1

Women were subject to the authority of their husbands. fathers. brothers. and sons.
The inner area of the home. in which women spent most of their lives. 'did not even
have windows opening on the outside world.' and any attempt to seek education was
seen as 'contrary to chastityew2'Abdul-Bah& when asked about the sratus of
women in the Orient, said:

> The community of women was so abased in the East thar, in the Arabic
> language, when a mention was made of them in conversation one would Say:
> 'Far be it from thee to be a woman.' as one would Say: 'Far be it from thee to be a
> donkey.' In the Turkish language, it was said: 'Exalted be thy presence from
> the mention of a woman.' And in the Persian language. when talking about a
> woman one would Say: 'May there be no relationship': moreover. the word
> 'woman' was used as a synonym for 'weak'. 3

their quarters, and which points to pervasive oppressive beliefs about women's bodies
and sexuality-

Constant veiling emphasizeci wornen's lack of any public identity. Indeed, as
one author points out;

> A woman's existence was only properly acknowledged ...in relation to one or
> more of the male members of the family. Any attempt to discuss the events of a
> woman's life was interpreted as an intrusion on the privacy of that man. who
> had the prerogative of ensuring that the women of his household remained
> concealed and protected. 5

Birth dates, names, and any other personal information about women's lives was rarely
recorded.

Babi and Baha'i historians of the time, al1 of whom were male. w o d d thus have
had great difkulty adequately researching the lives of their female CO-religionists. It is
unlikely, however. rhat such attempts were made; as Bahaneh Rouhani Ma'ani has
noted. the attitudes of these early historians 'were so conditioned by customary
practices and unjust traditions of the tirne rhat they did not notice the stmggles of
most of the early women believers: or if they did, these appeared so insignificant to
thern that they did not warrant prof'essional historical treatrnen~."~

Dernographic
information about early Eastern Baha'i women. their social standing, ages. and
backgrounds, or even how many there were, remairs unavailable.

Thus. current attempts to investigate the impact of early Eastern Baha'i
women's faith on their experience of gender are fraught with difficulties. Nonetheless,
it is clear that the central figures of the faith both modelled to their followers and urged
them to uphold a vision of gender which differed sharply from the prevailing norrns.

Perhaps the earliest intimation of this alteration of gender norms can be seen in
the Bab's relationship with his wife, Khadijih; atthough his texts Say little or nothing

exposing thernselves to dire consequences. Female believers were often referred to as
uhandmaidens". a title which Bahb'U'llah stated -far excelleth aught else that can be seen

'Abdu'l-Baha extended this record of implementation. In his own home. his
daughters and granddaughters received lengthy educations. often being sent abroad

his rnariy interviews with EngIish-speaking visitors. l              He frequently dernonstrated

important undertakings, which often involved giving direction to both men and

second wife nor permitted his followers to do so. He corresponded at length with many
women. in both the East and the West. and often condernned the oppression of women
in his homeland. Speaking at a suffrage meeting in Amenca in 1912. he clearly
demonstrated his recognition of Eastern wornen's abilities. saying:
Today, among the Bahais of Persia, there are many women who are the very

> pride and envy of the men. They are imbued with al1 the excellences and
> virtues of humanity. They are eloquent. they are poers and scholars and
> embody the quintessence of humility. The whole Orient bears witness to their
> greatness. In political matters they have been able to withstand the abiiities of
> men. They have given their lives and forfeited their possessions in martyrdom
for humanity. Their glory, honor and traces will last forever. Tmly the pages

of the history of Persia are illumined by the lives of such women. 16

While 'Abdu'l-Baha acknowledged that women in his homeland were terribly
oppressed. he encouraged them to strive for education and advancement. In one
letter, he urges, 'do not consider thyself to be insignificant by doubting what a
handrnaiden living behind the veil can do...",             and in another he asserts that "in the
countries of Europe and Amenca the maidservants of the Merciful have won the prize
of excellence and advancement from the arena of men ...Ye, who are the blessed leaves
from the East, should burn more brightly ...Anse, therefore, and exert
yourselves.. .-18

Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Bahas actions to foster the advancement of women were
wide ranging. and a thorough examination of them would go far beyond the purview of
this thesis. The extent to which these actions affected the lives of Eastern e a d y Baha'i
women, however, is hard to determine. The vast majority of these women were
illiterate: thus. men controlled their access to the Bahd'i writings. and. as Ma'ani has
noted. 'men were iittle concerned with the needs of ~ o r n e n . "In~ fact.

~     Mavani
suggests that the Baha'i community of the time may have actively resisted
disseminating and implementing Baha'U'liah and 'Abdu'l-Baha's demands for the
advancement of the status of women:

this d a t e 2 0

Nonetheless. it is clear that some awareness of this teaching was reaching the
Eastern community, and that it was making quite a splash: copies of taiks o n women's
rights given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in America in 19 11-1912 reached Persia shortly
thereafter. and led some Persian women to "advocate the immediate abolishment of the
veil. as well as women's full participation in administrative affairs." 'Abdu'l-Baha,
fearing that such rapid change would divide the cornmunity and expose it to increased
persecu tion. counselled the women to patience and less controversial measures.
advising them not to do anything "contrary to wisdom."*            Despite this advice, some

everyone was generally so embarrassed that traditional norms were hastily re-
established.22

As Ma'ani points out, the contribution of many Eastern women to the
development of the Bahd'i community consisted mainly of their 'vast capacity for
suffering in acquiescencew,their 'self-effacement and self-sacrifice." and the 'strong
offspringwthey left behind to carry forward 'the vital work of the Faith. while their

awareness of God's purpose." she attracted and instructed hundreds of men and women
in the Babi teachings and instituted a number of innovations within the community.
including occasionally appearîng unveiied at gatherïngs.28 In response to those
outraged by her rejection of the dictates of 'chastity', the Bdb named her Tahirih. 'the
Pure One*. thus expressing his tacit approval and rebutting her critics.

While most of her biograpners have dwelt on Tahirih's interaction with men in
the public sphere, she also attracted and galvanized many early Babi women, some of
whorn have been acknowledged as historically important figures in their own right. 29
The circle of women which continuaily surrounded her. according to Susan Stiles

Whether or not she intended to be a crusader for the advancernent of women, it is clear
that many of her contemporaries experienced her as such. Indeed. in Moslern circles.
the story of her audacity and eventual execution became a cautionary tale about the

interpretation.33

If we accept for the moment that she rnay senre as a 'paradigrnatic ideal of
womanhood for Baha'is." it is interesting to consider the implications of this paradigm.

suggests that women are encouraged to be assertive. intelligent. eloquent.

modesty , gentleness. and su bmissiveness.37

The operation of such a paradigm in the community would likely have influenced the
restrictions placed on other early Eastern Baha'i women. possibly by fueling their
latent activist tendencies. It may also be that the extreme (for the time) radicalism of
this paradigm provoked resistance to change and greater gender conformity than
might have otherwise existed among some cornmunity members of both sexes.

modem Bahd'is, such women may in fact have provided more accessible role models to

woman's exper-ience.

One wornan whose life was entirely transformed by the Bahbi faith was

the domestic affairs of what became a very large and complex household. At the same
time. she cdtivated a wide range of social relationships which served to protect her
loved ones.41

While these services seem more in line with conventional notions of 'ideal
wornanhood', it is noteworthy that she did not many. and. in fact. is reported to have

Khanum achieved a greater degree of autonomy than she might otherwise have
expected only by sacrificing the opponunity to have a spouse and bear children.
That she was empowered to make such a choice, in a time and culture when women
usuaily had iittle or no influence on their own marital status. suggests that the gender
norms operant in her tife were, relative to her context, quite liberal. This impression is
confkned by the fact that. in addition to her domestic responsibilities. she was on
several occasions the international leader of the Baha'i community. as regent for both

Ir is difficulr to find examples of more 'everyday' early Eastern female believers
whose Lives illustrate the extent to which their faith affected their ability to resist
oppressive gender norms. However. several initiatives promo ting the advancement of
women (however obliquely) undertaken in the early Persian Baha'i community suggest
that Tahirih and Bahiyyih Khanum's experiencss should not be interpreted as isolated
instances of quasi-liberation. but rather as indicators of the emancipatory influence of
the Baha'i faith in the lives of many early female Eastern believers. Three such
initiatives will be btiefly described.

The first of these was the establishment of women's assemblages throughout
Iran between 1910 and 1917. by a cornmittee for the liberation of women which had
been formed by the wives of two very prominent ~ a h a ' i s .The

husbands in the community undoubtedly enabled them to agitate for equality more
aggressively than many other women without exposing themselves to the reproach of
more conservative elements in the cornmuniv. Women's assemblies were intentionaily
designed to foster the advancement of women by raising their level of knowledge and
cornpetence: their mandate. as set by 'Abdu'l-Baha, included the discussion of
educational rnethods. logical analysis and organization of religious arguments. oration.
medicine and health, general education in the various branches of knowledge. and the
cultivation of virtues such as constancy. perseverance. strength. determination. and
fxrnness of purpose. In addition, the assemblages were advised to address the rieeds of
girls and to avoid frivolous topics, while the participants were counselled to take one

~ ~ been unable to
find an explanation for the termination of the assemblages after 19 17: a combination of
factors. including increasing persecution of the community. may have corne into play.
Nonetheless. these early consciousness-raising groups musr have had a lasting impact
both on their participants and on the comnunity's reputation as a promoter of the
advancement of women.

Another Baha'i endeavour whlch advanced the status of women was the
opening of a women's clinic and gynecology department at a Baha'i hospital in Tehran.
at a time when Persian women were t o t d y deprived of skilled medical care. In 1908. a
group of male Baha'i Persian doctors, concerned about women's health. asked 'Abdu'i-
Baha to help them find a Western BahA'i woman doctor to work with them. Soon after.
Dr. Susan Moody, an Arnerican, arrived in Tehran. For 15 years she treated women of
al1 religions and social classes at her clinic and in the hospital. where she served as

45 Khan. Advancemenr of Women. pp. 187- 190.

superintendent and head of gynecology.47 In addition. she held classes for mothers
and tried to establish a school of n ~ r s i n gEventudy.

conditions in kan forced her to return to the West: but three years later. at the age of
77\. she returned to Iran, where she continued treating women until her death in 1934.

As a Western woman in Persia. Dr. Moody may have enjoyed a greater degree of
equality and inviolability than she could have expected among men of her own race-
Her engagement with men as peers and her activisrn to promote Eastern women's
interests must have challenged conventional gender norms and inspired and
empotvered the local Baha'i women. Thus. the benefits of this initiative weni beyond
the obvious irnprovernents in women's access to medical care. It may be construed
from this exarnple that the status of Eastern Baha'i women was positively affected both
by the intervention of their Western fernale CO-religionistsand by acrivities
undertaken on their behalf by male Bahb'is. whose concern and interest in women's
well-being must be attributed at least in part to rheir new-found faith.

A third Baha'i project which affected Eastern women's experience of gender
involved increasing women's access to education. Ar the time. there were no
educationd institutions for women and girls in Persia. The Baha'i writings emphasize
the necessity for education. and indicate that women's education is more importanr
than men's: however. although the community had been running very successful
boys' schools in various parts of the country since 1897. schooling for girls was only
offered by a handful of Persian women on an informal basis. In the early 1900's a group
of Baha'i women in Tehran, including Dr. Susan Moody and Munirih Khanum. one of
the women instrumental in establishing women's assemblages, began agitating for the

establishment of a formal school for girls.50 With the assistance of endowrnents and
scholanhips from many Western Bahaviwomen, including the Canadians Harriet

A few Western Baha'i women. including the Arnericans Dr. Genevieve Coy and
Lillian Kappes, were recruited by 'Abdul-Baha to ensure that the girls' schools used
modern teaching methods: several Persian early graduates. such as Ishraqiyyih

clear devotion to women7semancipation and challenging gender norms. 56

The curriculum offered to girls, according to 'Abdul-Baba, was to include -the

Persian Baha'i girls' schools used an innovative and broadly-based curriculum.

aloud. none of which were routinely permitted in society, and had gymnastics and
recesses. which would not be offered in other schools for over 15 years. 59

In addition, the girls' schools offered a program of continuing education for
mothers of students and older women, through monthly conferences which attracted
300-400 participants. Although the programs were not particularly radical. using
drarna. plays and demonstrations to inform and instruct on topics within women's
traditional sphere. the act of gathenng women for explicitly educational purposes must
have had a significant impact. 60

When, in 1934. the Baha'i schools were shut down by the government. the
community instituted pnvate classes for Baha'i boys and girls based on a 17-year
curriculum of moral and religious education. involving over 4000 students across

fundamentally challenging the conrinement of wornen's bodies and minds to domestic
concerns and paving the way for their entrance into the public sphere.

Baha'i women in the cradle of the faith were. to a surpnsing extent. enabled by their
faith to resist or (to some degree) escape the crushing confinement of traditionai gender
norms. Understanding the operation of the Baha'i faith as an emancipatory force in

their lives would require painstaking research using alternative sources: as Maneck
notes,

kthough women in the early Eastern community faced many restrictions which would
chafe the modem reader. (for instance, exclusion from the official public administration
of the Baha'i community), relative to their context. they were offered revolutionary
possibilities through allegiance to their faith. The early Eastern comrnunity clearly
struggled and to some extent succeeded in beginning to practice the vision of
emancipation it espoused. Could the same be said of Che early Ivestern Bahai
ccmmunities?

Early Western Developmen t

To properly consider this question, we must first set the fairh's Western debut
in contexr. The turn of the century throughout the Western world was characterized
by social unrest and rapid change. The last frontiers in North America had recrntly
been settled and urbanization and industrialization were a ~ c e l e r a t i n gThe

~ ~ upper
and middle classes flocked to lectures and clubs to analyse the processes of change
which were transforming the socio-cultural landscape, and to be soothed by great
theones and explanations offered by intellectuals whose status and credibility
approached and ar times surpassed that of the clergy. As pointed out by Ursula King.
'questions never asked before, problems never encountered in the pasr. possibilities
never envisaged" confronted them, and continue to confront u s 'in most unsettling
and perturbing ways. w65

Ail of this unease manifested itself in vigorous religious questioning and
transformation. Millennialism became widespread and many expected the immanent

At the same time, an increasing emphasis on science. precipitated by
Darwinism, among other forces. and reinforced by the growth of the intellectual
culture. posed a major challenge to the churches. Debates over the inerrancy of the
Bible polarized traditional and liberal Christians into separate camps. setting the stage

would take many years for most Christians to stop damning the heathens. but
ecumenism slowly began its ascent. In response to these tensions. the American Bahai
historian Robert S tockman has O bserved that:

Religious seeking became widespread. and many - particularly in America - turned to
new religious alternatives. such as Theosophy New Thought. Unity. Shakerism. and a
varïety of metaphysical, mystical, and revivalist movements.

While such religious experimentation also occurred in Canada. we were. then as
now, less religiously diverse than the States and more religiously conservative: almost
90% of the Canadian population in 1901 was Catholic. Anglican. Methodist. or
Presbyterian. This figure remained relatively constant through the fîrst half of the
centuryil Thus. though the winds of religious change blew on both sides of the
border. the Canadian tempest was sornewhat milder.

At the same tirne. the constructions of fernininity and women's roles were also
radically changing. The cult of 'me womanhood' or 'virtuous womanhood' was in full
ideological force throughout North Amenca. The 'New Woman' ran her home with
scientific efficiency and skiU. creating hawns of moral rectitude in which upstanding
citizens were lovingly and firmly molded. Women became the embodiment of delicacy.
purity. and respectability, while men were considered active, worldly, effective. and
oddly uncivilized. Hers was a glorified and entirely separate private sphere: however.
this private sphere gradually came to include a certain level of social activism. This
ideal. as described by Stockman,

rectitude that were assumed to dominate woman's character.72

In the minds of many, this ideal also included religious roles. inasmuch as women were
considered the moral guardians of their families. Women's public prayer. testihing
and preaching: the temperance, social puritv, prison reform, and abolition movements:
the proliferation of overseas missions: and. ultimately. suffrage, al1 stemmed from
women's extension of this moral guardianship from the private to the public
sphere. 73

Religion was instrumental to die mobilization of women. Indeed. Carroll Smith-
Rosenburg has pointed out that:

> Ironically. during the very years when the new bourgeois men began to
> proselytize for the confining Cult of Tme Womanhood. wild. religious women
> created a public and powerful role for themselves as a female conscience and
> moral voice crying out in a wilderness of male corruption. 74

Religion thus provided women with the cmteni of a revolution: but as J. Gordon
Melton has further noted. religion aiso provided the form: 'in the nineteenth century.
religion provided a conrext in which women could organize and from which feminist
impulses could be generated. Before there were women's clubs. women's schools. and
women's nghts groups, women's rnobilization began in the c h ~ r c h e s . "This

~ ~ view is
echoed by King. who observes that "women took to the public platrorm on behalf of
religion long before they were stirred by politics. 76 -

The changes in the Protestant church in the first half of the 19th century had
created a Christianity in which 'the immediate experience of the Holy Spirit. not the
moral and orderly progress of the fathers, signified piety....individual mystical
experiences broke through the boundarïes between divine and hurnan. female and

rnount the pulpit. Toward the end of the century. the mainstream. traditional
churches began becoming less radical. precipitating both the separation of several
evangelical sects and the protests of many women. who began to resist their
marginalkation and to seek positions of reiigious leadership. 0 ften. these ambitions
could only be realized through allegiance to the new evangelicd sects or the ever-
expanding host of mysticd and other religious movements. in which women's
charismatic leadership tended to be more readily accepted. Again, as Smith-Rosenburg
observes,

> To implement their newfound sacred and social responsibilities more effectively.
many respectable women moved beyond individually inspired behavior to form

a score of untraditional - indeed. iconoclastic - organizations. 78
Although these organizations allowed women to achieve some authority based on

~ ~ .despite the fact that sorne of thern. such as the
'direct experience of the s a ~ r e d " and
Shakers and the Universal Friends. were founded by women. most of them uItimateIy
denied women administrative or organizational power.

Thus, when a Syrian Baha'i businessman amved in Chicago and began offering
classes on the new religion in 1895, many women were seeking a mode of religious
expression which would satisfy their hunger both for God and for emancipation. and
were wiiling to leave the mainstream churches in order to find it. Within two years. his
classes had attracted 100 converts; by January of 1898, there were 225 Baha'is in
Chicago. Among these early followers were several Canadians. including Kate Cowan
Ives. a transplanted Newfoundlander. who declared her faith at the age of 22 and was
the first Western woman to remain devoted throughout her life: and Aimée Montfort. a
'stylish and well-educatedn French-Canadian schoolteacher. She became very active in
the Chicago community, seMng as president of the Women's Assembly of Teaching
and offering abundant hospitality. She was married to an eccentnc anarchist. Honoré

briefly to Canada in 1907-1909. After the First World War Aimée left her husband.
possibly with his blessings, as many anarchists saw marriage as a form of femde
slavery. 80

The first Baha'i in Canada. however. was Edith Magee. of a prominent Irish-
British famiIy of London, Ontario. Mernbers of her family had first heard of the faith at
the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893: during subsequent visits to
Chicago. Edith, at the age of 17. declared her faith. Upon her retum to London in
1898\. her rnother, 15 year old sister Harriet. and two materna1 aunts also became
converts. In 1899, they formed a Baha'i study group. which attracted the local US
consul and his family. By about 1%)0.there were 9 Baha'is in London. 81

In 1902, the Magees left Canada for New York City. where Edith married a
prominent journalist. She, her sister. and mother seem to have remained active both
in the New York Baha'i community and in the early development of a Bahai school at
Green Acre. in        aine.^^   The farnily, which was raised in an 'atmosphere of tolerance

Her sister. Harrier, was also active as secretary of the Women's Unity. a group of Baha'i
women dedicated to improving the conditions of their Eastern female CO-religionists.

The Magee's departure was soon followed by the US consul's move abroad. and
the London Baha'i comrnunity dissipated. Credit for establishing the first permanent
Canadian Baha'i community is thus given to May Maxwell of Montreal. an American
who became Baha'i in Paris. She had been raised as a Unitarian, which inclined her to
openness to new reIigious ideas: had been given to religious dreams since

in 1898. when Hearst and sorne Arnerïcan friends came through the city.87 The
group's ostensible purpose was a trip down the Nile. but May soon ferreted out their
intention to visit 'Abdu'l-Baha in Palestine. May promptly became a believer. and.
although bedridden with chronic ailrnents for the pre&us two years. as part of the
legion of middle-class fernale Victonan invalids. she persuaded Hearst to allow her to
join the group of Bah& pilgrims.

Following what must have been a rernarkable pilgrirnage.88 May returned to
Pans as the only Baha'i in Europe. Within a year. there were 14 Baha'is in Paris: by
190 1. the comrnunity had doubled. In 1902, May married Canadian architect William
Sutherland Maxwell. He had been wooing her since 1899. but May, unwilling to leave
Paris until its Baha'i community was secure. had put him off for two years until
'Abdu'l-Baha sent word that she could go. This delay in her wedding set the course for
her mariage. in which she was ro consistently place her faith over her role as wife and
mother, directly contravening the conventionai construction of womanhood and
asserting the primacy of her individud beliefs.

communiy activities. The community was thus focussed on adults rather than
families. IO3

As van den Hoonaard has noted. although many Bahais before the 1920's had
pnor ailegiances to Theosophy. Methodism. or Rosicrucianism. 'it is clear that liberal
Protestantism was the principal anvil upon which the Baha'i community was initially

composition, and influenced believers' interpretation of Baha'i teachings. producing an
emphasis on the individual. organization. and the so-cdled Twelve Pnnciples of the
Baha'i faith (rather than. for instance. mysticd union with the Divine through prayer).
This Protestant slant, combined with the dearth of children and families and the
absence of ritual and congregaüonal prayer. must have contributed to the faith's lack
of appeal to Catholics. who comprised only 4% of the Canadian communiry in 1921.
and 12% in 1947.1°8

Despite rhis grounding in traditional churches . community members O ften had
quirky tendencies. Many new BahBis had histones of activism in social reform or racial
arnity work. were suffragists. advocates of 'health fads' or the fight against fluoridarion.
were defenders of new technologies. or took up similar controversiai causes in addition
to their espousai of the Baha'i faith. Thus. many believers would have been considered
a bit odd even without their 'exotic' religion: their faith "increased or reinforced. nor
lessened. certain unpopular or deviant lifestyles: these lifestyles provided a modicum
sense of cornmunity."lo9 Such unconventional views may have occasioned the
disapproval of more conservative elements both within the community and without: in
America. where a sirnilar situation existed. one early (and unfailingly devoted) adherent
complained that.

The appeal of the faith to many activists was enhanced by the flexibility of the
teachings: very little of the scriptures were available in authorized translations. and
believers had considerable latitude to interpret the teachings in ways which supported
their preferences.          Many such behevers may have seen 'the Baha'i Faith as a
confhnation of heir personal ideas about anticipated social changewl l 2 and as an
extension of their cornmitment to the social gospel rnovernent.                BahA'is highlighted
those teachings 'that would speak to the larger cultural frame." including Liberal
Biblical interpretations, the equality of wornen and men, an emphasis on achieving
universal peace and eliminating the extremes of wealth and poverty. and a tacit

advocated active engagement in the wider society: indeed. many Baha'is "maintained
extensive ties to other circles, often keeping these circles deiiberately separate from the
Baha'i cornrnunity."l l 7 The flexibility of the teachings and the perrneability of the
community ailowed it to CO-existwith the wider society in relative harmony. despite
the range of views espoused by the believers.

While some were drawn by the allure of the faith's social teachings. many new
Bahdeis were persuaded by the charisma of individual teachers, such as May Maxwell.
In addition. van den Hoonaard asserts that:

> Some came to the new religion as a result of their spintual search or were
> attracted by the diversity of its membership. Others were initially drawn to
> Baha'i gatherings by mystical impulses. while others saw their first Baha'i

By the 1920's. the faith began to interest other believers. particularly youth. o n the
smength of its political teachings, rather than its mystical or Christian aspects. 119

The Baha'i teachings on gender must also have been attractive to many of the
over 550 Canadians who became believers during the community's first fifty years. 120
However. exactiy what these teachings were remained unclear to Western Bahais for
some time. Although they asserted that Baha'fi'llah advocated gender equality. the first
teachers of the faith in the West, as Eastern males. had infused the teachings with their
own gender biases. including the assumption thar women could not serve on elected
administrative bodies. l 2    This led to segregated assernblies and occasioned much
conflict in some communities in the States. most notably Chicago. as the 'official' men's
assernblies often Iacked financial support.122 while the parallel wornen's assernblies
represented the vast majority of the community members and thus held considerable
power.123 While rnany comrnunities. particularly srnaller ones. always had rnixed
assemblies, o n which women and men served interchangeably in al1 roles, the more
'mature' Chicago assembly's gender segregation rnay have been upheld by some as an

ideal to be e r n ~ 1 a t e d . lAny

~ ~ inclination to do so would have been stymied by
'Abdu'l-Baba's dissoIution of dl-male assemblies and demand that mùted assemblies be
elected in their stead during his visit to the West in 19 11- 19 12.

The Canadian Bah& community at the time existed as a northern branch of the
much larger American community. Thus. while segregated assemblies were not, to my
knowledge, elected in Canada. their implications for 'proper' Baha'i gender roles and the
furor they caused must have affected Canadian believers.

During his travels in America and Europe. and his visit to Montred. 'Abdu'l-
Baha made many public talks on the advancement of women. Often. he was hosted on
such occasions by non-Baha'i women's and suffrage organizations. His speeches on
the matter were widely published in English. thanks to the development of a Baha'i
newsletter which served alI of North America and parts of Europe. These speeches are
frequently cited to this day in elucidations of the Bahai view of gender. By 1912 the
Baha'i perspective on this matter. as described in detail in the previous chapter, would
therefore have been accessible to the Western community. 'Abdu'l-Baha further
elaborated and explained the Baha'i position o n gender equity to the community
through his responses to scores of letters written to him by (mostly female) Western
believers: this process of explanaiion and encouragement was continued by Shoghi
Effendi upon the passing of 'Abdul-Baha in 1921.IZ3

Despite the availability of clear statements of the Bahai vision of gender.

equality was obviously not fully implernented in this infant community, as evidenced
by the fact that although only 25-33% of the believers were male. men were seven
times more likely ihan women to receive full obituary articles in the Canadian B a h a ï
New upon their deaths.126 An xticle by Dr. Orrol Harper on the equality of wornen

and men in the 1925 B a h a ï Year Book. while not authoritaüve. suggests that at least
some members of the community were struggiing to reconcile the Baha'i teaching with
their own gender biases. In this article. men of colour (Indians and Arabs) or women
themselves are frarned as the agents of wornen's oppression. but white men escape
blame: changes in the status of women are attributed to women's self-improvement and
realizations, rather than accommodating shifts in social. political. legal. and economic
structures: women's paid work is glamourized and conceived of as appropnate only in
those occupations which resemble women's tradiüonal roles; veils are described as
protective rather than oppressive: masculinity and fernininity are equated with men
and women; equdity is described as women attaining what men have. rather than a
radicd paradigrn shift; and emancipation is seen as more-or-less achieved. l Z 7 The
publication of these views, which clearly contradict Bahai scriptures . suggest that the
community's interpretation of the Baha'i vision of gender was significantly affected by
prevailing social norms. On the other hand. publishing ventures in the early
community tended to be run by men: thus. male voices may have been privileged.
Printed records of conservative gender attitudes thus may not represent the practiced
gender norms in the community. which likely differed from place ro place and depended
to a large degree on the attitudes and aptitudes of the individuai believers in each
group.

hdeed, historical evidence appears to support the argument that early
Western Baha'i women generaily found their fairh emancipating. Examples of
individual heroism far beyond women's traditional p u ~ e w

are too numerous to
recount: however, such exceptional services were usually available only to Baha'i
women who were unrnarried or childless.'28 Some of these wornen may even have had
greater liberty than men. who were often constrained by their financial obligations: as

Jackson Armstrong Ingram has noted. 'Bahd'i women as a group had more material
resources. and the freedom that goes with thern. at their disposal. than             Of
course. the vast majority of unmanied women at that time were not wealthy widows or
women of leisure. but rather supponed themselves with low-paying. low-status jobs.

Nonetheless, women were both nurnerically and actually dominant within the
community. The husbands of married active Baha'i women. such as the Canadian
Laura Davis. would occasionaily be referred to by community members as 'Mr. Laura
Davis." in a telling reversal of traditional terrns. 130 Van den Hoonaard. in his study of
the first fifty years of Canadian Baha'i history, found that women were as likely as men
to give public talks and to lead formal and informal teaching activities. and that there
appears to have been no systematic differences in topics addressed by men and
wornen. l       Wornen's representation on Canadian local assernblies generaily reflecred
their proportion of the community. often surpassing 50%: and. while assembly
secretaries were virtually always fernale, women also often served as chairperson. 132
It is worth noting in this regard that the office of secretary in a Baha'i assembly holds
the greatest responsibility. and is not merely a derical function. Women were more
likely than men to be appointed to cornmittees. aithough often within gender
appropriate spheres, and two-thirds of those who moved to new areas to found
Canaûian Baha'i communities were women. 133

In America. the dorninance of women was supported by patronage networks, in
which wealthy Bahd'i women would sponsor those less fortunate either for specific or
extended services: although such arrangements remained private. patronesses in the
community attained considerable power and prestige and were often elected to

community offices. Men were rarely involved in this system. as those with money
tended to render services themselves. rather than sponsoring others to do so; and
those requiring patronage seldom sought it from patronesses. However. men were
sponsored on a few occasions, usuaily by virtue of their relation to an established
femde client. While the patronesses were simply fulfilling their socially expected
philanthropie role. their largesse bound together networks of women attached both to
their sponsors and horizontaliy to one another. 134 Although the Canadian
manifestation of this phenomena has not been studied, given the integration of the two
communities at the time, it is probable that the existence of these Amencan networks
influenced the Canadian community and that sorne Canadian women both gave and
received patronage.

Another alleged aspect of the Arnencan community which likewise has not been
studied in Canada but which may have influenced Baha'i womens experience of gender

theology. which was taught only to wornen judged able to comprehend it. and

revealed scnpture. its existence suggests that many early Bahdi women had no qualms
about challenging traditional gender norms, and indeed elaborated upon the tenets of
their faith in ways which they may have believed would increase their abiiity to do so.
Nternatively. this phenornenon points out that the early Western believers were often
more enthusiastic than they were knowledgeable as Bahais.

Whether or not we judge the early Baha'i women as having resisted oppressive
norrns. it is clear that their male CO-religionistsoften found them distressingly
dominant. Correspondence between two of America's most prominent early Baha'i men
indudes the following cornplaint:

> women are emotional. uncertain. unsteady, unwise in business affairs. carried
> away by 'devotion', given to dreams and imaginations. and 1am convinced that
> as long as the Cause in this land is so largely in the hands of women. it
CANNOT PROSPER. ...As long as the 'ferninine element' dominares the

rnovement, it cannot be carried on wisely and well. 138

To be fair. it must be noted that this passage was wntten before authoritative Bahai
scnptures regarding the equality of wornen and men were generally available:
nonetheless. that such a sentiment would be both felt and wntten (albeit privarely)
indicates chat some Baba'is were oflended by women's newfound leadership and
independence. Such records rnay, in fact. provide compelling proof that gender oorms
were being widely challenged within the community. as docile. cornpliant women would
hardly have occasioned such upset.

Further evidence that men were distressed by women's dominance is offered by
the August 20. 1910 issue of B a h a ï News, which contains the statement that "nine-
tenths of the active workers in the Cause in the West are women," as well as a Ietter
complaining that in most Baha'i localities women performed the bulk of the work.
holding Baha'i meetings in the early aftemoons when men were unable to attend.

'Wornen." the correspondent dieged. 'were sirnply content to attend meetings. but
men needed to d o work and very few locaüries were organized for éfficient work .-139
Men appear to have been jealous of women's ability to meet frequently. as many
women either worked from home or had flexible schedules. (The incompatibiiity of
evening meetings with chüdcare. and thus their inconvenience for women charged
with that duty. was not noted by male commentators.) Armstrong Ingram has argued
that Bahai men saw women's dominance as "a threat to the rationai control of the
development of the movementw,as rationality wzs exclusively attributed to men. 140
While Canadian examples of the foregoing are not available. it seems likely that a
sirnilar situation existed.

This male angst may be the proverbial 'smoke' which points irrefutablÿ toward
the existence of a fire; in this case. what was burning was traditional gender norms.
Whether early Western Baha'i women were feminists who embraced the faith to further
their own preconceived notions of equality. or were traditionalists whose
contravention of gender norrns arose solely from religious devotion. it is clear that the
early Western Baha'is were active iii promoting the advancement of women and strove
to implement this central Baha'i teaching in spite of their attendant fears. It could be
argued that this community was merely caught in the tide of first-wave ferninism then
sweeping the West, but the persistence of women's leadership within the community,
and the extent to which women's services challenged conventional norms. suggest that
this w u not the case. Equaiity has always been a central Baha'i teaching: that it was
then in vogue in the West was merely a happy coincidence. which probably both
hindered and helped the new Bahd'is in their struggle to understand and practice their
beliefs.

Has the Bahd'i community continued to srrive to implernent its belief in the
equality of women and men? The present project does not ailow a thorough response
to this question, but a cursory examination suggests that comrnunities around the
world have worked toward this god.

Implernenting Equality in Iran

In Iran, the cradle of the Bahai faith, speciai care has been required in the
implementation of equality, as the community continues to be vulnerable to
persecution at the hands of fanatic elements within the clergy and government. As
explained by Janet and Peter Khan, 'Baha'i actions to emancipate and educate women
were liable to be stigmatized as encouraging irnmorality. and thus to be used by those
who opposed the faith as excuses for reinstituting repressive measures.                   The
community therefore has had to be careful in its approach to controversial gender
roles. In the time of Baha'u'llah, when many Iranian Baha'is were being killed. Iranian
Baha'i women were cautioned against pioneering to open new Baha'i cornmuniries.
Later. when persecutions eased somewhat. 'Abdu'l-Baha urged rhem to arise in this
capacity: and in 1954. as the situation becarne even more secure. Shoghi Effendi
encouraged them to "outdo men" as pioneers and to -dernonstrate greater courage.
audacity. and detachment than their male counterparts,' asking that they meet or
exceed the achievements of their Western counterparts. 142

Cautious action. however. is not the same as inaction. The Iranian
community's efforts during the first part of this century have been rnentioned earlier.
Its ongoing educational programs were e ~ c h e by

d the formation of the National
Cornmittee for the Progress of Women in 1944 which organized women's activities

'

142 Shoghi Effendi. cired in Ibid. p. 21 1. and Rouhani Masani. -Religion and the Myrh of Male
Superiority," pp. 19-20.

throughout Iran and established a four-year plan with the specific goal of
administrative equaiity. This cornmittee published a monthly women's magazine and
held classes and conventions to promote women's interests. Women had for some time
been voting in Iranian Baha'i elections: in 1954. they became eligible for office.
Although only two women were observed among the hundred delegates at an Iranian
Baha'l National Convention in 1970. by the early 1980's. when Baha'i assemblies were
banned and the mernbers of the National Assembly executed. the chairperson of that
body was a woman. Zhinous Mahmoudi. a physicist who was the head of Iran's
meteorological bureau. 143

Further evidence that Baha'i women continued to resist oppressive gender
norms cornes from Judith Goldstein. an anthropologist who did field work in Iran in
the mid-1970s. Maneck. reporting on this study. says:

> She found that BahA'i women, unlike the women of other communities,
> associated freely with men and parricipated nearly equally in religious
> gatherings. The principle of the equality of men and women was a frequent
> topic of discussion. used to establish the supenority of the Baha'i teachings.
> Noting that for Baha'is, 'eloquence is a cultivated virtue: one might argue that it

> women conduct religious discussions in a manner quite different
> from the style of more traditional women's conversation. The skillful use of
> metaphor and command of argument can be seen...The Baha'i women's active

Thus, the Baha'i community in Iran. despite the attendant dangers. seems to have
persisted in its allegiance to the advancement of women. and Baha'i women appear to
have been thereby empowered to resist oppression.

In the past one hundred and fifty years. Baha'i communities have sprung up in
232 countries around the world and have attracted believers from over 2,100 different
ethnic and tribal groups. 14'         Currently, the rnajority of Baha'is live in so-called Third
World countries. with the largest communities in India. East Africa. parts of Southeast
Asia. and the Andes. BahB'is constitute up to one-quarter of the population of some

Many of these communities have developed within cultures which have long
histories of severe gender inequality; in response. Baha'is at the institutional and
individual levels have undertaken projects to improve the status of women. While
some of these projects are initiated at the local level, others are developed by rhe BahaY
International Community (BIG) , which has worked independently and in collaboration
with UN agenties and other NGOs to promote gender equality since the 1950's. This
work has included active participation in the UN'S conferences on the status of women
in 1975 /Mexico City. 1980/Copenhagen. 1985Nairobi. and 1995/Beijing.147 Since
1992\. the BIC has continued its efforts through its Office for the Advancement of
Women. which has its headquarters in New York and branches around the world. and
which is mandated to collaborate with NGOs on projects supporting the advancement
of women. as well as advising national Baha'i assernblies about opportunities for service

interventions, which focussed on female illiteracy. men's mismanagement of family

Nurnerous conferences and seminars have been sponsored by Bahgis

that, due to special encouragement, more women dian men participated in the üteracy

Such systematic and widespread efforts to promote equality have been
mandated by the Universal House of Justice's plans for the development of the
international Bahal community since the r n i d - 1 9 7 0 ' ~ .The

~ ~ ~House of Justice has also
ensured that the community continues to strive for womeri's equal representation in
Baha'i administration. In 1951 Egyptian Bahai women received the right ta hold office.
as did their Iranian CO-reügionistsin 1954: ever since. Baha'i women around the world
have been encouraged to vote for and serve on ail local and national assemblies. As
one author notes, such service is far from trivial:

> The very act of becoming a Baha'i is the frst major personal decision for most
> women in rural areas.... Because of their functions in serving on Bahai
> administrative bodies and in voting and being voted for and eIected. women
> have made great strides in a largely male dorninated society. An increasing
number of local Baha'i assernblies have women as members and local assemblies

with aLl women members have also been reported. 161

As this quotation suggests. a significant degree of women's administrative
participation has been achieved in Baha'i communities. Recent statistics (1997) indicate
that wornen make up an average of 37% of Baha'i National Assembües. ranging from
17% in Africa to 5 1% in North America. In 4 1% of cases. a 1994 study found women
serving as National Assembly secretaries, arguably the m m powerful national
administrative post.162 While these nurnbers are far from satisfactory. it should be
noted that the global average for women's participation in national secular
governments is below 10O/o. 163

Such projects and statistics suggest that the equality of women and men is
indeed gradually being implemented in Baha'i communities around the world. and that
many Baha'i women abroad have, by virtue of their faith. challenged oppressive
gender n o m s to some degree. Furthermore, it would appear that such efforts have
benefitted and are continuing to benefit both Bahais and the wider society. as the
subjugation of women is challenged by Baha'i undertakings both within the
community and without. Most of the described efforts have been initiated in
'undeveloped" countries: and. considenng that wornen have a much lower rate of
representation in Baha'i administration in such areas. one could conclude that rhis
concentration of effort is warranted. Does this imply, however. that the Baha'i
community is now Iess active than it once was in promoting the advancement of
women in the West? Has this affected Canadian Baha'i women's experience of gender?

Implementing EquaIity in the Current Canadian B a h a l Community

Canadian and American feminist scholars regularly churn out rearns of statistics
which indicate that the equality of women and men has not yet been achieved in the
econornic, political. legal. medical. or social spheres. Their vigilance in these efforts is
heightened by fexs of a growing Western 'feminist backlash' which may threaten gains
already secured. In Canada. these fears coalesce in the form of REAL women and
similar groups. which, in the view of many feminists. assume the form of the women's

movement while working counter to its aims.           In the international sphere, many
feminist efforts have been 'hoisted on their own petard', as representatives of other
cultures tum the movement's own moral relativisrn against it in their rejection of
projects to irnprove the status of women as enactrnents of Western ideological
imperialism.

Dissension has also developed within the movement itself, as modes of thought
emphasizing ciifference - intended to create solidarity between women (as opposed to
men) - instead create division, as indices of identity other than gender cornpete for
primacy. Contentious feminist positions, such as the general rejection of 'organized
rckgicn' as inherently patriarchal. have further marginalized the movement in our
predominantly Christian Canadian society. This marginalization has been furthered
by widespread angst over perceived economic crises buffeting the Canadian economy:
this angst has created governments inclined to cut rather than support 'non-essential'
programs, such as those fostering the advancement of women. At the same time.
significant progress in the emancipation of women has been achieved. and equality's
apparent ideological ascendancy in Canadian society continues unchecked.

Against this cornplex background, the Canadian comrnunity of about 15.000

Bah& is chugging dong in its own efforts to irnplernent equality.166 At the 1998
National Convention, a group of more than 80 believers from across the country
gathered for a lunch-hour discussion of the advancement of women in their
communities. Their reports of local initiatives induded participating in a variety of
consciousness-raising type groups. often with other ostensible purposes. such as
quilting; offering dinner parties with prominent women speakers: hosting concerts ro
support women' shelters: working on women's issues with multi-faith groups. like-
rninded NGOs, academics. and artists: teaching women business. skills through a
mentoring program: offering women financial planning workshops: convening regular

166 van den Hoonaard. B&*i cornrnunity of Canada. p. 2.

gatherings. both large and smaii. to discuss gender issues: supporting and mentoring
groups of female artists: hosiing community celebrations of Mother's Day and
International Women's Day; hosting retreats for businesswomen and women in
shelters: fostering a club for pre-teen girls to celebrate 'coming of age': and
volunteering in Native communities. 167

Nonetheless. it was my observation that participants in rhis meeting were
dissatisfied by the community's record of gender activism. and were more inclined to
emphasize what remains to be doiie rather than recounting its victoriec. At the same
time, many participants expressed hesitation about collaborating with non-Baha'i
feminist groups, which are perceived as having 'extreme" views. They further raised
the need for greater involvement by men in Baha'i efforts to promote the advancement
of women, and for greater access to information about Bahai women's history. 168

The Baha'i administration aiso appears to be unsatisfied: at the repeated urging
of the i~ternationaladministration. local and national governing bodies in Canada
continue to encourage the cornmunity to redouble its efforts in support of the
advancement of wornen. The March/April 1989 issue of B a h Z ï Canada. published by
the National Assembly. contained the following appeal:

> MJe cannot allow deep-rooted prejudices about women to shape Our behaviour:
> we cannot allow men or women to continue the slighting jokes. innuendoes and

to do these things we have broken a promise to Baha'u'Uah - that is, to
safeguard. uphold. promote and practice the equality between men and

women. ..169

The inclusion of such an appeai suggests both an institutionai interest in promoting
equaüty and a community-level lack of profound comrnitment and action in this regard:
aker ail. if the community were not falling short, it would not invite such a strongly-
worded exhortation. The Canadian National Assembly's concern about the
community's implementation of equaiity has persisted despiie women's equal
representation in local administration and current numerical dominance on the
National Assembly.

A recent (1995) study of 'the current status of the Baha'i community in Canada
in implementing the Baha'i teachings on the equality of men and wornenn suggests that
the National Assembly's concerns are not unfounded. 170 In this study. Deborah and
Will van den Hoonaard discovered that the comrnunity neither has a united vision of
equality and its indicators. nor has the ability to define habits which impede the
advancement of women.17            Three different approaches to the issue ernerged. The first
of these seems "mainly to support the sîarus quo....[ and] emphasize unity in the family.
suggesting that the implementation of equality rnight threaten that unity": in the
secular context. such views "normally indicate a rejection of equality."172 Advocates of
this approach defend traditional labour divisions as representing gender preference

Despite this focus on the family, some criticism of cornmunity practices also
emerged. particularly concerning the division of labour. which. according to some
believers. assigns 'glory workwlike public speaking. MCing. and chairing events to

'fernale face' for the cornmunity in the public sphere. L79 The study further noted 'a

Female participants identified the need for men to step back, not patronize. and
to discreetly encourage women: to practice feeling-centered communication, and to be
overtly anti-sexist in their rnarriages and workplaces. l8 Male participants were l e s
able to identib concrete needs. dthough some suggested that men also required
encouragement. Women in generai seemed more familiar with pertinent writings. and
found it much easier to engage in discussion of equaüty issues. Nonetheless. many of
the women participating in the study praised the Bahai community's achievements in
the area of equality: they were much more likely to do so than men. who tended to be
more critical and also more likely to cite their own personal contributions to the
cause. 182

The believers generally were cautious and ambivalent about collaborating with
other organizations in promoting the advancement of women. perhaps because many
of them are perceived as excluding men. 183 This reticence is aiso attributed to the
community's fear of accusations of hypocrisy arising from women's exclusion from the
House of ~ u s t i c e84

. ~ Furthermore, sorne cornrnunity mernbers. particularly youth.

appear hesitant to expose the community's efforts to promote equality to the scrutiny
of secular ferninists. fearing that the BahLi community's apparently good record lacks
substance. 185

Despite these mosdy depressing findings. the researchers noted that gender
dynamics within participant groups had been universally respectful. that men had
tended to neither interrupt nor contradict women's statements. and that it was

generally X e ' for women to make their contributions. The fact that such a study was
commissioned by the National Assembly further suggests an abiding dedication to
improving the status of wornen in the community. In general. however. the van den
Hoonaards' study seems to have found that the Canadian Baha'i community's response
to gender issues is predorninantly conservative.

This perception of conservativism is corroborated by several observers in
other Western communities. Three common explanations seem to emerge. One school
of thought appears to attribute it to inherent flaws in the Baha'i teachings and/or the
community's interpretation thereof: for instance. Maneck cites 'cultural barriers.
rigidity of certain administrative structures, conceptions of authority. and literalistic
interpretations of scrip ture. 186  -

Others point to insufficient effort or resistance to change within the
community:

Proponents of this view usually perceive such resistance and heel-dragging as
indicators that the Baha'f teachings have been insufficiently interndized by
community members. Thus. blame is assigned to the comrnunity. not the teachings
themselves.

On the other hand, some authors argue that the community's apparent
conservativism is not problematic. but is rather a natural consequence of the
comrnunity's graduai approach to activism. As described by Janet and Peter Khan. a d
discussed in detail in the previous chapter. this approach
is characterized by the implementation of the spiritual principle in an
> evolutionary manner over a long period of tirne. sustained by a comrnitment to
> fundamental change and nurtured by educational programs designed to assist
> individu& and communities to gradudly bring attitudes and actions into
conformity with the spiritual principle ...While the approach may not satisb

the impatient. it has the advantage of leading to enduring change. 188

Defenders of this perspective, u m f f l e d by the evidences of ongoing oppression. insisr
that the Baha'i community must provide a non-judgmencai and safe environment in
which we encourage one another in Our efforts to learn how to collectively implement

as 'the habits of centuries must be changed. and the disruption to traditional practices
must be addressed. Through the Baha'i teachings." they maintain. 'both men and
women are being assisted to transform the rnost personai aspects of their domestic lives

Regardless of their expianation for the community's conservative tendencies.

most commentators grant that there is substantiai need for improvement in its
implementation of equality. One commonly identified need is for generally accepted
indicators of progress. As pointed out by Ann Boyles. arriving a t a clear. broad
understanding of 'the advancement of women' requires a consideration of the variety of
ways in which this process can be understood. particularly given the global reach of
the Baha'i cornmunity. lg2 Statistical measures are only of limited assistance, as Bahai
institutions are expected to uphold the principle of equality regardless of their gender
composition. Ig3 Furtherrnore. numericai parity may convey the appearance of
progress, without necessanly entailing any underlying shift in the dominance of
masculine values.

In the absence of such clear indicaton, as Peggy Caton has noted. 'concepts of
'spiritual' or 'essential' equality rnay be abstractly applied to conditions of the greatest
practicd inequality without any seeming contradiction to those who do so. *lg4 She
asserts ,

> The Baha'i community must go beyond words and rhetonc: we must examine
> our behavior and attitudes and ask if they truly reflect the equality we so
> confidently proclaim we have. Too often we have setrled for premature

us to keep an open mind, to regard equality as a process. one that will always

The rigorous self-examination Caton advocates depends upon the adoption of clearly
described indicators of progress in the advancement of women. Defining such
indicators, would. of course, be a difficult and contentious project. and universally
applicable ones may not be appropriate at this point: however, in the absence of such

indicators. significant progress in the communinjs efforts to promote equality is
unlikely to occur. The presence of these indicators in the Bahai discoune would
further facilitate qualitative assessrnent of gender equity projects, which currently tend
to remain unevaluated, severely limiting the community's ability to learn thrcugh
experience.

On a related tack, authors in the field have also suggested that the community
may need to reconsider its location of inequality. The Baha'i administration has
consistently urged the believers to actively promote the advancement of women, "most
especially in those parts of the globe where the rights of women are traditionally and
persiçtently denied." l 96 Such statements are usually perceived as assigning priority
to Baha'i gender activism in non-Western countries. They may further be interpreted
as implying that such work in the West is not required. despite clear statements to the
CO n trary.   197

Accordingly, it is not uncornmon for Canadian Baha'is to assert thar equality in
the West has aiready been achieved.lg8 BahaViauthors - who rnay be more aware of
the feminisc social critique, and thus offer a more sophisticated gender analysis - are
unlikely to espouse this belief, and may take pains to contradict it. For instance, Ann
Boyles asserts:

> In the 'developed" world. the paradigm shift to equality of the sexes rnay not be
> as dramatically evident as in other parts of the planet, but the changes, whiie

Such assertions may only have a limited impact on the persistence of naive and
erroneous beliefs within the community. unless concerned believers undertake
systematic programs of consciousness-raising. In this vein. Boyies goes on to Say that

> the sacred writings as the measure of behavior .... development of consultative

developed in concert with the humility of servi~ude- a delicare and challenging

balance!200

As discussed earlier, such broadly-based and thorough educational projects are
uncommon in the Canadian community. and will probably remain so as long as we lack
clear indicators of (inlequality and perceive it as a non-Western problem.

Some authors in the field have also noted that Baha'i women need greater access
to education:

> Baha'i women have yet to become fully as well educated as men. In this respect.
> Baha'i families. for the most part, do not yet ensure that daughters are at least as
> well educated as sons. Baha'i cornmunities must encourage wornen to become
> equally capable with men in presenting the Faith publicly. in pursuing Bahai
> scholarship. and in becoming renowned for their deep knowledge of Baha'i
> teachings. 20 1

This deficit is particularly troubling as priority is clearly and incontrovertibly
assigned to the education of girls and women in the Baha'i scriptures. I t may therefore
indicate the extent to which the community is shaped by the wider society rather than
its faith.

Other authors. such as Anne Gordon Atkinson Perry and Susan Stiles Maneck.

have highlighted the needs of Baha'i women seeking to combine their careers or
callings with motherhood. Perry notes that many women are chronically fatigued or
depressed by the s a a i fices such juggIing of duties requires in our unsupportive social
context. 202 while Maneck asserts that this juggling has placed great stresses on Bahavi
women. who seek excellence both in eheir careers and as mothers. and are thus prone
to 'supermom syndrome. m203         This phenornenon is cornpounded by the cornrnunity's
tendency to adopt troublesome interpretations of the scriptural exaltation of
motherhood: as Lata Taéed points out, these writings have served as justification for
an exaggerated ernphasis on women's 'feminine' and materna1 attributes. 204 This. in
turn. has underrnined support for wornen seeking to develop their 'masculine'
attributes in non-maternal endeavors. Furthermore. it has perpetuated the
assignment of women to traditionally feminine roles - hospitality. childcare. and 'grunt
workw- within the comrnunity. and prevented men from developing their domestic
aptitudes. While the vast majority of Canadian women are sirnilarly confronted by
'double day' or 'triple day' workloads. combining paid employment, childcare. and
perhaps eldercare, as well as domestic work. the Bahai community has yet to End ways
to help women negotiate and discharge these competing obligations.

While several Baha'i authors thus readily point out the shortcomings of the
Western community's efforts to advance women's interests. few offer specific practical
remedial suggestions. This author was able to find two. First. a few authors advocate
the developmen~of 'role models' for Bah& women. drawn from the community's
histoy. which would 'exempli@ a paradigm that Bahd'i women who are devoted to
their farnilies may draw strength from. "205 Doing so effectively would depend upon

the community's ability to perceive the heroic potential of domestic work. Obviously.

Tahirih's story would not be particularly helpful in this capacity.

The other suggestion. brought forward by Trevor Finch, is that Bahd'i
thinkers and writers should, 'with compassion. courage. and enthusiasm." fosrer
'dialogue with feminists and women's groups and movements." Finch calls this an
'urgent priority." and goes on to Say:

So much emotion, frustration and energy could be refocussed to constructive
> ends among the world's women. and so much Baha'i complacency could be
> transmuted to an awareness of human need if dialogue were entered into on a
> wide-ranging and depth-plurnbing basis. 206

AS dtscussed earlier. the Canadian community seems reluctant         to do so, for a variety of
reasons. Finch acknowledges this reluctance. and even affirms that some of the
comrnunity's fears are not unfounded;

> So much of what Baha'is write is not ground-breaking. but distinctly treading
> in others' footsteps. In rnany ways we. as Baha'is. are far behind in developing
> Our thinking in the realm of equaliry and gender studies. much less enacting
> our newly-developed thought processes. Our timid explorations may well seem
> naive to the outside world. if not childish ...207

However, he insists that this collaboration must take place. and that it would increase
the efficacy of projects co promote the advancernent of women both within the
cornmunity and without. as the experience and insights of the secular wornen's
movement informs and reinvigorates Baha'i efforts. and the Baha'i "spirituality... and
non-confrontational lines of action" help heal the rifts among secular feminists.208

Conclusion

In the face of this litany of compIaints about the implementation of equaüty in
the Canadian and Western Baha'i communities. one must consider whether we are
witnessing the vigorous self-criticism of a healthy. self-aware. striving community. or
the evidences of failure. As many religious scholars have noted. 'despite initial reforms
in gender roles. religions generaily adapt to their social environ. lose their ability to
uansform society, and corne to mirror society at large.           While it would be easy to
argue that this has not happened in the developing world. the ability of the Bahais to
transform or challenge Western social norms certainly appears to have diminished
over time. This rnay be a skewed perception: Our current faults may be easier to find
than those in our past. On the other hand. perhaps we inflate the significance of
certain past events and personages to create a history of gender activism that never
was. There is no objective seat from which to fairly judge: certainly the author does
not daim one.

Nonetheless. the vision of gender offered by the Baha'i teachings does appear to
have had a significant practical impact upon the constraints faced by female believers
early in the faith's history. both in the East and the West. and in communities around
the developing world. This impact must be attnbuted both to the vision of gender
enunciated in the Bzha'i scriptures and to the believers' willingness to implemenr this
vision. a willingness informed by the conviction that equality is the will of God. and
that efforts to promote it will be assisted by Divine grace. Such conviction may, in
fact, provide stronger commitment to the cause of women's advancement than secular
motivations.2 10

But it is harder to assess the impact of their faith on current Canadian Baha'i
women's ability îo resist oppressive social norms. From some perspectives. it may
appear that the community is in facr behind the general society in its attitudes toward
the advancernent of women: this view, however, presumes that the wider society is
leading in a direction which the Baha'is seek to follow. rather than steadily pursuing a
nearby but intersecting course. It rnay be more prudent. then. if we must judge. to do
so against the community's own scriptural vision. Against this measure. in the
author's view. the Canadian Baha'i community appears to be on the right track but
perhaps moving too slowly.

chapter Four - Test Intervention

Whereas a traditional researcher might now be inclined to end up this thesis
with a sorrowful summation that 'activism among Baha'i women in the West was once
remarkable but is now. sadiy, on the decline,' or similar dismal musings. with a
melancholy satisfaction that their underlying cynical western liberal irreligious
worldview has not been challengeci by their findings. the feminist researcher
(theoretically, at least) ought to be saying, "akight. now. so what do we   DO about it?"

Feminist Action Research Methods in A Bahal Context

As discussed in chapter one's introduction to feminist scholarship.

understanding situations and translorming them are seen as inseparable. Most
feminist research could therefore be described as 'action research*,which seeks to
generate both knowledge and change. This. of course. immediately raises several
problems. Figuring out who gets to decide what is going to change. and how. can
cause wavenng in even the most stiffly principled feminist researcher.      Worhng as an
insider. with non-objectified subjects. using alternative sources. in a personalized,
cornmitted mariner. sounds lovely. but most researchers are hard-pressed to sincerely
value their research subjects' goals as much as or more highly than their own. The
fact that 'research participants bring their own purposes to any srudyW.land rhat
these purposes may be at odds with rhose of the researcher. is enough to bring the
progress of many projects to a shuddering halt. Theoretical loopholes such as the idea
of "fdse consciousness" allow some feminist researchers to place priority on their own
visions of what oughr to change while at the same tirne maintaining the semblance of a
non-hierarchal. non-exploitive. non-objectifying research dynamic.

And so. as 1move from musing about the situation of Canadian Bahai women
into doing something about it. 1must skirt some treacherous ground. Happily, îhis is
facilitated by the fact that this project's research subjects and 1are al1 Bahais. While
antithetical to most traditional forrns of research. this 'insiderness', with its implied
involvement and intimacy, would be considered ideal by many proponents of feminist
research. This similarity between the researcher and research subjects itseIf is not
enough to ensure that our goals and visions converge. The relevant (and perhaps
only) point of sirnilarity between myself and my subjects is Our religious faith.
Therefore, in addition to my own and my subjects' perhaps contesting views of what
ought to change and how, it is possible - perhaps even unavoidable - to inuoduce the
point of view enunciated by Bahai scriptures. which serve as an external authoritative
voice valued by al1 parties. Thus. deciding what to change is a process ofjoindy
seeking to understand and conform oneself to what is believed to be the will of Gad,
rarher than a simple contest between individuais. This radically transforms the power
dynamics between the researcher and the researched. as 'authority' is posited in
neither. but rather in God. As clergy are forbidden in the Baha'i faith. 1 as the
researcher am unlikely to be conflated with that authonty.

This would certainly raise the hackles of most feminist researchers. who. as
discussed in chaprer one. tend to adopt the ubiquitous secularism of the academy. and
would raise fears that Our deference to our conception of God is simply anorher form of
fernale submission to an external patriarchal structure. a pernicious snare of religious
false-consciousness keeping us back from the autonomy and independence that might
be ours. (The valuing of autonomy and independence as the ultimate good is rarely. if
ever. interrogated.) However. the e t h c of ferninist research requires that the subjects
themselves have some control, arid that the research serves their best interests.      If the
research subjects have identified their 'best interests' as seeking conformity with a code

of conduct enuncizted by a body of scnpture, what nght do 1or any researcher have
to contradict and undermine their faith?

It could be vgued that oniy a co-religionist ought to undertake feminist
research among believers. lest a secular researcher unwittingly give rise to crises of
faith. Given that many religious people value their convictions more highly than Life
itself. this could be considered a grievous harm to the research subjects. At the same
tirne, blind dogmaticism or fanaticism seems inherentiy repulsive. Walking the line
between promoting open inquiry and underrnining faith is a tricky undertaking.
Subjects may feel ashamed to voice devotion to a secular researcher. and embarrassed
to voice doubts to a co-religionist. In either case, it behooves the researcher to be
very carefuI.

In working with Baha'i women. however. 1am helped out of this corner by
several aspects of our belief system. One of the central tenets of the Bahal faith is the
independent investigation of tmth. As stated in the scripture:

> The best beloved of d l things in My sight is Justice: turn not away therefrom
> if thou desirest Me. and neglect it not that I may confide in thee. By its aid thou
shah see with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others. and shalt

know of thine own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy neighbor.
Ponder this in thy heart, how it behooveth thee to be. Verily. justice is My gifr

to thee and the sign of My loving-kindness. Set it then before thine eyesm2

Vigorous questioning and interrogation of one's beliefs and choices is an integral part
of the ideal Bahb'i üfe and is quite comrnon in the cornmunity. n e r e is. of course. a
vital difference between doing so within a context of hith or within a context of
skepticism; the scriptures also advise believers to "weigh not the Book of God with
such standards and sciences as are current amongst you. for the Book itself is the
unerring Balance established amongst men."3

'   BaMVLllbh.Hidden Words. (Wilmette. Illinois: Bahki Publishing Trust. 1985). p. 4 -

Thus, although I would not engage a group of Baha'i women in a discussion of
whether or not a Baha'i teaching were m e . we could happily discuss our various
perceptions and understandings of Baha'i teachings, and analyse Our community's
efforts to implement them. In fact. BahaY gatherings are regularily held in most
communities for this express purpose, which. given the lack of clergy. is. dong with
independenr study of the texts. prayer. and reflection. an essential component of Baha'i
life.

As indicated in chapter two. the equality of women and men is clearly
enunciated by Baha'i scriptures and its promotion is endorsed as an essential activity
by both the scnptures and current administrative bodies. Thus. further community
interventions initiated dong these lines are unlikely to occasion any disquiet in the
community - indeed, a feminist critique of the community is most likely to be welcomed
as a helpful and essential service, despite the trauma it rnight entail. While resistance
to change is ükely in some quarters. it is unlikely to receive institutional support.

This clement reception. however. depends very much upon the means
employed: contention and confict are catego~callyforbidden in Baha'i scriptures.
This mns contrary to the orientation of some feminist interventions. which actively
cultivate anger among participants, as a supposed catalyst for change. Feminist
projects which accept or support gender segregation (as with lesbian separatists) or
which engage in 'male-bashing' would be totally inappropriate in a Baha'i context. This
point is asserted in guidance issued by the Baha'i supreme governing body in 1994:

> Those Baha'is who devote thernselves to the promotion of the equality of the
> sexes. through speeches and articles. should be aware that such a process will
> be facilitated if it is carried out without disruption to the unity of the believers.

\[128\] endeavors reinforced. To maintain this unity. Baha'i men and women must

> denunciatory attitudes which distinguish so much of the movement for equality
> of the sexes in the larger society?

One should not infer frorn the foregoing that the Baha'is would sacrifice equaliq for the
sake of unity: in fact. the scriptures clearly note that m e unity without justice is
impossible.6 Rather. the Baha'i position appears to argue that consultative. non-
adversarial rnethods are simply more productive. Ferninist interventions must respect
this preference if they are to be effective in this comrnunity.

A final aspect of the Baha'i belief system pertinent to the design of community
intervention methodology concerns individual behavioral and attitudinal change. Any
process w h c h seeks to alter human behavior is premised on assumptions (usually
unstated and unexamined) about the nature of human beings. The Bahai wodd view
proposes that every human is 'a mine rich in gems of inestimable                         These
'gems' are the latent human capacity to emulate the virtues of God. The development
and manifestation of this latent capaciy is as close as one c m corne to 'knowing' God.
and. dong with contributing to the development of society, constitures the purpose of
life. Any project which is seen as furthenng these objectives is therefore likely to
attract highly motivated participants.

Fostering the expression of these virtues in ourselves is an individual
responsibility. and is pursued (with varying degrees of diligence) through prayer.
meditation. service, education. and striving to Live in accordance with the Baha'i
teachings. all of which requires persistent effort to change behaviors and attitudes.

This effort is informed by the scriptural advice that 'the attainment of any objecr is
conditioned on knowledge, volition, and a ~ t i o n . " ~

This behavior change
methodology appears identical to the 'Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills
Model" developed by William Fisher. originally in support of an AIDSIHIV fisk
reduction program. but applicable to any project seeking behavioral change. The
central supposition of this mode1 is that behavioral change can be stimulated by
'interventions that are conceptually based. comprehensively focussed on the
provision of... information. motivation. and behavioral skills. and targeted at
empirically identified. group-specific needs in each of these areas. w 9

The behavioral and attitudinal changes required for the realization of gender
equality are, thus. likely to be framed by Baha'is in terrns of what virtues must be
developed (by whom) , and. to that end. what must be known. what must be wanted.
and what must be done. Feminist action researchers working in the Baha'i community
would be well advised to consider this view of behavioral change in designing their
project methodologies.

In summary. ferninist researchers arc, of course. free to practise whatever
methods they choose in their efforts to produce change as well as papers. However.
projects undertaken in a Bah& context are more likely to succeed if:
1) God's will, as articulated in Baha'i scnptures, is taken as the arbiter of what changes
oughr to be made, taking precedence over both the researcher's and the research
subjects' views.
2) Interrogation of scriptures and cornmunity practices takes place within a faith-
positive context,

3) h i t y and gender collaboration are supported by the project design.

4) Behavioral change is frarned as a process of fostering the expression of virtues
through specific knowledge, volition. and actions.

Feminist Merhodology Models Used In This Project

Within these parameters. 1have proceeded to attempt to 'do something*to
encourage Baha'i women to become more active promoters of the advancement of
women. In so doing, 1 run no nsk of imposing my own agenda on the research
subjects, as by their profession of faith they have - wittingly or not - adopted this
objective as their own.1°

While it is undeniably convenient to chus allow a 'higher authority*to set an
uncontested objective. one must still decide how to approach this objective. To that
end. 1 have called upon the practical (though less authoritative) methodologicd
guidance of several feminisr action research theorists. Among the plethora of
approaches they suggest. two seemed particularly appropriate for my purposes.

Radical Storytelling

The first particularly inspiring bit of the discourse concerns reclaiming
womenvs history through storytelling. A variety of feminist scholars - many of them
working in religious studies - have converged upon this theme. As articulated by
Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza. this approach rests on the premise thar 'all the

This process requires alternative sources a n d o r alternative readings of androcentric
histones. as practitioners are urged 'to notice the footprints and the shadows and the
remnants that provide glimpses into stories that have not been showcased in the texts
that have been preserved".

In addition to finding these stories. however. advocates of this view argue that
the stories must be told. Judith Plaskow. in her feminist study of Judaism. asserts that

Storytelling. then. both orally and in pnnt. becomes a tool for connecting women's
history with their present expenence. and a remedy for the dissonance between "the
holes in the text and many women's felt experience."17 It also presumably relieves

the 'psychic damage" done to 'the sexual identity of those who never fmd the
experience of their own sex reflected in the text or tradition. and who must always
appropriate texts and traditions mediated through the experiences of those of the
opposite sex."18 Feminist storytelling provides an affirmation that the religious
cornrnunity "is a comrnunity of wornen and men. and it has never been o t h e r ~ i s e " . ~ ~
an affrrnation which in turn empowers women to 'challenge existing religious
authorities and structures by demanding full participation as well as public
recognition of the many-sided and varied work already done by women in religious
institutions. -2 0

While Baha'i women are not. in my view. confronted by inherently patriarchai
administrative structures, the believers who enact Baha'i administrative principles
naturdly carry with thern the baggage of a sexist society. Thus. as discussed in
chapter three. there are things going on in the Baha'i community which could benefit
from the type of challenges and demands which such storytelling is supposed to
inspire. Furthermore, as rny background is in theatre and playwrighting. and 1 have
used histonc storytelling with some success in past workshops. this method seemed
particularly suited to my skills and preferences. While the study of Baha'i history is
encouraged among the believers, and storytelling occasionally occurs in Canadian
Baha'i gatherings. storytelling [rom a feminist perspective - which I have called 'radical
storytelling*.in recognition of its change-orienration - has never been systernaticaily
introduced as a catalyst for behavioral and attitudinal change in the Canadian Baha'i
community. 1 decided ro make it a central cornponent of my community intervention.

Gatbering the Stories

1have been able to find only one article abcut Baha'i women's expenence in the
academic press. wntten by Susan Sriles Maneck. and pubüshed in Relieion and
Women, edited by Arvind Sharma. While this article is undeniably helpful. 1object to
some of the author's assumptions and resultant analyses. and its examination of Bahhi
women's history is far from exhaustive.

One is therefore compelied to rely for the most part on Baha'i histories from
non-âcademic sources. And, whïle several such histones exist. rhey are primwily
androcenvic texts, particularly those addressing early-Baha'i history in the Middle
East. The absence of Baha'i women in the records of this period (with a few notable
exceptions) is so marked that it has led at least one historian, Peter Smith. to conclude
that the faith was original& a male presenre and that generally women leamed of the
faith from their menfolk. kthough women's prominence increased over time. he
argues that men were the primary carriers of religion, while women ensured the
religious sociaüzation of ~ h i l d r e n . ~This

'    uncritical reading of the texts denies the
existence of women's 'own networks. self-sustaining and self-led. within which religious
ideas could be disseminated and promulgated. apart frorn the observation of men. -22
networks which reriiained invisible to men and for the most part unrecorded in
histoncal texts. but which nonetheless must have significantly shaped the course of
Baha'i history.

Every early Eastern Baha'i historian was. to my knowledge. male. Given that
they wrote in a society in which the mere mention of a woman's name was an insult to

her chastity, the fact that women are discussed at ail in their texts is itself remarkable.

Women's appearances were i~suallywarranted by extraordinary acts of courage or
boldness in the promulgation or defense of their faith. or by their relationship to and
service alongside prominent men. Women who did not contravene gender norms
almost never appear in print, and those who did are praised for doing so. However.
this does not necessarily indicate a nascent feminist consciousness among Eastern
early Baha'i historians. On the contrary. Canadian Baha'i historian WiU C. van den
Hoonaard has argued that. as early Eastern believers tended ro view the Baha'i
principles as a fair accompli by their very enunciation rather than as an articulation OP

a state to be achieved through ongoing conscious effort. historians were exceedingly
unlikely to conceptualize the violation of gender norms by Bahai women as part of a
general struggle for emancipation.

More modern works in Baha'i history strive to represent the role of women
more accurately. Two Bahai professors. Robert Stockman and Will van den Hoonaard.
who have recenrly published histories of the Baha'i faith in America and Canada
respectively. have also published papers investigating the significance of gender in
early Western Baha'i history. and strive to provide some gender analysis in their texts.
However. the tendency to valorize individual heroic women while ignoring their social
contexts regrettably continues in most of the recent work in Baha'i history. Even
when ostensibly focussing on women's history. Bahai authors tend to recount the
astonishing exploits of heroic and peculiar individuals. disassociated from their social
or even familial contexts. and without reference to the sunounding changes and
tensions in gender roles, even when their subjects were direct participants in political
women's movements. Perhaps because of androcenuic squeamishness about the
pnvate sphere, or in a rnisplaced desire to respect the privacy of their su bjects. most
texts dwell only on their subjects' stalwart Bahai services and triumphs in the face of
adversity .

While finding fault with anyone. particularly dead revered histoncal figures.

would be extremely inappropnate in a Baha'i context. the authors' histones run the
risk of presenting an assembly of de-humanized two-dimensional caricatures of women.
In my view. such treatments are uniikely to inspire anything except perhaps feelings
of inadequacy in the current Bahagifernale reader. In order for us to be able to identify
with Our foresisters, and draw inspiration from them. they must not be 'otheredWby
the text. This may require a more nuanced treatment, in which their famiüal contexts.
their relationships. rheir physicality. and their less-laudable emotions and reactions
are acknowledged as well as their sterling qualities and achievernents. In fact, it could
be argued that the story of their stniggles is meaningless unless one also sees what
they struggled against.

The issue of 'authenticity" in Baha'i history is complicared by the fact that the
central figures of the faith also wrote histories. and that their versions of "what
happened" are generally raken as true. However. these same central figures thernselves
pointed out that their texts were far from complete. Nonetheless. Baha'i historians are
unlikely to write supplementary histones which in any way cast doubt on the story as
told by the central figures of the faith. Any text which did so would certainly not be
well received by the community. 1wonder if perhaps historians. anxious abour their
treatment of these quasi-scepturd sources. might not have steered too wide a berth
around them. The community might in fact be much better served if historians would
set about offering a lush profusion of histories, from a range of subjective angles.
padding and intersecting with the 'officialn history, worrying less about citations and
facts and not contradicting authoritative texts. and more about texture and depth and
increasing the range of perspectives which are represented.

These problems led me inevitably toward alternative sources. There are some
female-authored secondary histoncal sources, mostly articles. many of which are quite
similar to the sources discussed above. A few really interesting feminist voices have
emerged, most notably the work of Bahiyyih Nakhjavani. Unfortunately few of these
voices are well-known or influentid in the community. and exarnples of their work are
hard to find.

This leaves us with primary sources. The aforernentioned problems in the
secondary materiai reflect to some extent the h i t a t i o n s of the available prïmary
sources. The case of early Western Baha'i women may be typical: even though they
made up two-thirds to three-quarters of the Baha'i community in the West and
frequently organized their own events, their organizations have left scant archival
records. Few examples of their correspondence, account books. minutes. or lerterhead
exist: what is available is often scrawled on the back of Lists and letters. suggesting that
women's organizations were accustomed to a level of informality which did not lend
itself to painstaking r e ~ o r d s - k e e ~ i n It

g ~is~also possible that any existing records
were not recognized as important and sirnply were not kept.

Given the trend in the earlier part of this century for women to carry on long
and intimate correspondences and to keep diaries, one could hope that these sources
would be available: unfortunately, few have corne to light. This may be due to
reticence on the part of the women, as there are accounts of them destroying their own
diaries and correspondence, presumably because their contents were deemed
unseemly. or, as some of the women themselves explained. 'were best forgotten." As
Sara M a s points out in Discourses of Difference. late-Victonan women writing about

their own Lives faced ovenvhelming discursive tensions as they attempted to make
their mark in the public sphere without being seen to depart from their respectable
roles in the private sphere. The difficulty inherent in negotiating these discursive
tensions has greatly reduced the quantity and quality of material available to
researchers. Many of the personal papers which did not end up in the coal grate are
still in the hands of the women's relatives and, for whatever reason, have not been
made available to s ~ h o l a r swhile

, ~ ~ those existing in archives are dispersed over
several continents and are difficult to access.

More problems emerge in the treatment of the available diaries. letters. travel
joumals, and fust-hand accounts by women. Occasionally. they will be pubüshed as-
is, with a brief introduction providing a few biographical derails about the authors.
These publications. however, seem to be taken as touching memoirs rather than
sources of historical facts. Bahai historians, who generally do not iocate their own
subjectivity. appear much more likely to authenticate rheir accounts of what "really
happened" by rekrences to other men's unadmittedly subjective accounts. rarher than
drawing upon these alternative primary sources. At times, it seems that women's
accounts of events experienced first- hand are perceived as less authoritathre than
men's second-hand accounts. Newsletters, bulletins, and other official reports from the
time thus tend to provide the richest field in which to dig around for stories: however.
although most of them would have seemed fair at the time of writing. they now appear
rnarred by obvious androcentric biases. 25

In this context, assembling stories is for me a process of chasing shadows and
mapping footprints. Jewish and Christian feminist historians. trying to piece together
their foresisters' stones from a history f a . more distant, have suggested a process of

24 Ibid.

'remembering and inventing together': but 1 End that 1 balk at the idea of inventing,
and. given that rny stones are only about one hundred years dead. rather than
thousands, reviving them without recourse to rny own creativity may be more
possible,

And yet it is not an easy task. Aside from the technical problems discussed
above. the process of sifting through texts for glirnpses into an unknown fabric of lives
is emotionally difficult. particulariy when seeking the stones of early Persian Baha'i
women. The few details that endure are often bloated with sadness. One gets edgy on a
diet of so rnuch depnvation: what 1am denied by the texts: what the women whose
stones 1 seek were denied. There is a constant fear of imposing too much of my own
interpretation onto these women, who seem enigmatic to me. but probably saw
themselves as quite straightfonvard. The Persian women 1 know seem as far from this
past as 1am. but 1 wonder if they might nor have clearer insights into how they felt. in
the same way as the flavour of my great-grandrnothers' and aunties' prejudices and
perceptions and passions is familiar to me. So often 1 see the women whose stories 1
seek only as posed in a moment of valour. bur 1am repulsed by the idea of cornpiling
these static monuments into a sort of Disney-tour of prominent Baha*iwomen. Yes.
they were noble and upstanding in their sacrifices. but 1yearn for rhem to be familiar.

At one point it occurred to me that assembling these stones was like walking
down a street at night. looking in windows at a variety of scenes: but on this street
98% of the curtains are drawn. and 1can see into only a few windows. Those few do
not occur at random, but because what was going on inside served the vision of a
histonan and a culture. represented what they wanted me to see and believe about the
people on this street. What 1 can observe in one window. however dimly. may be
nothing at al1 like what is going on in the dark next door.

Eventudy. despite ail the attendant difficulties, 1compiled the content for
stories which I thought might be suitably inspirational and empowering. They are.
inevitably, biased and partial. The second bit of methodological guidance I have taken
from feminist action researchers concerned how to deliver these stories to their
intended recipients.

Consciousn ess-Raising

1 have developed some strong opinions. over the course of my expenence as a
workshop faciütator, about effective strategies for shanng information with groups.
and among these opinions is the view that one's methods matter a lot more than one's
content. For this project. 1 wanted to ground rny methods in something a bit more
defensible than 'it just felt right'. 1was therefore quite happy to discover that what
tends to 'feel right' to me overlaps significanrly with the method feminist scholars
describe as consciousness-raising.

Consciousness-raising. which onginated in post civil-war Arnerican women's
educational study groups, 26 now refers to 'meetings by small groups of women over
an extended period of time for the purpose of discussing persona1 experiences without
professional leadership. In these meetings. women attsmpr to articulate a political
analysis that will facilitate changewz7 Consciousness-raising has been described as 'a
unique ferninist method" because it enables women to discuss and understand their
experiences from their own viewpoints.28 and to "make sense of the world in ways
which do not support male supremacy and which therefore promote o u r self-esteem
and personal growth.n29 Marilyn and James Massey have identified it as an ideal site

for the ferninist religious experience. which they (somewhat narrowly) define as
"getting in touch with the body and with deeply buried feelings and e r n o t i o n ~ . ~ ~ ~

While consciousness-raising has been commonly used by the women's
movement as a tiberation strategy. it is less often irnplemented by ferninist researchers
in their community          intervention^,^^ perhaps because it requires a significant time
comrnitment. Nonetheless. a modified consciousness-raising methodology appeared
right for rny project. Elements of the mode1 which I particularly wanted to incorporate
into rny work include its ernphasis on exploring and regaining the lost self, both
direccly and through accessing Our history; its aim of promoting self esteem and
persona1 growth: irs fostenng of open discussion and sharing among women: its
inclusion and honoring of the body and emotion: and its focus on articularing analyses
which promote change.

Intervention Methodology

And so, finally. we corne to the planning of Our community intervention. in
which we shall see if radical storyteUing with a modified consciousness-raising group of
Canadian Baha'i wornen increases their level of activism in the promotion of the
advancernent of women.

My first task was to decide how to assemble a group. As 1have been unable to
determine how most consciousness-raising groups recruit their members, and how the
duration of the group's existence is decided. I am unsure how far From the original
mode1 I have strayed in these respects. I decided to target Baha'i women in Ottawa. as a
medium-large, ethnically mixed. readily accessible cornmunity, not unlike dozens of

30 Massey and Massey. 'Ferninisrs on C h r i ~ t i a n i y p.

Baha'i communities across Canada. Left to my own devices, 1devised a recmitment
strategy which combined a general invitation for women to apply to participate.
published in the local Baha'i newsletter. with personal invitations to apply sent out to
a randomly-chosen fifth of the Bahd'i women in Ottawa (wtiich came out to 25
invitations.) On the invitations. 1emphasized that all were welcome to apply. but that
space was Iirnited. and a group of participants most representative of the community's
diversity would be chosen from the pool of applicants. As 'consciousness-raising
group meetings" would sound u n f d i a r and perhaps intirnidating to many Canadian
Baha'i women. the project was biiled as a senes of workshops. Copies of recmitment
matefiais are attached in appendix one.

I also took it upon myself to arbitrarily set the duracion of the required
cornmitment to five weekly meetings. Baha'is tend to be very busy people, and 1 felt
that 1would be unlikely to find many women willing to take on an open-ended tirne
commirment. Furthemore. 1myself was unwilling to do so. and felr that the demands
of my project did not warrant it.

As 1was the researcher, and 1was convening the groups. and was offering
stories. it behooved me to clariw the extent of my leadership in the group. Without
treading too heavily on the toes of the feminist power-sharing ethic. decided to
clearly assume the role of a facilitator. In addition. 1called upon the services of a co-
facilitator to assist me in leading sorne exercises. independentty lead others. and at
other times participate equally with the mernbers of the consciousness-raising group.
This CO-facilitator.Faye Dupras. with whom 1 have worked extensively in the past.
would, 1hoped. diffuse the focus on a single leader and bridge the gap between 'the
leader' and 'the led'. as well as collaborating with me in planning exercises and activities
for the group.

While recovenng the lost self. through the consciousness-raising discussion,
nicely complements the process of recovering our lost s t ~ r i e s a. ~
story

~ alone does
not a transfomative group process make. Adding storytelling to the sharing of
personal views and expenences usually characteristic of consciousness-raising groups
could leaven the discussion. broadening its base to help maintain a construcrive focus
on affrmation and change, but we still had to decide how to use and present the stories
in order to maxirnize their effectiveness, and what other activities and exercises to
combine them with.

Hashing out the procedural details of whar would be provided in each of the
five workshops was an extremely labonous process which took several rnonths. In
addition to the aspecrs of consciousness-raising groups which 1 wished to retain. and
my focus on storytelling, 1 wanted to ensure that the group process would appeal to
al1 learning styles. My CO-facilitatorand 1 therefore painstakingly drafred workshop
outlines which drew upon a wide range of facilitation and instruction strategies. These
outlines. and the materials which supported the workshops. are al1 appended.

One of rny early decisions was that participants were to receive workbooks.

This enabled us to provide a lot of content - pertinent scriptural extracts. poetry.
articles by feminist Bahal scholars, and excerpts from primary sources containing
'seed stones" (the raw materials for story-building) - without cornpressing everything
into the two or three hours per week of Our group's meetings. Each week would have
its bundle of 'homework' readings. whch supported and supplemenred the workshop's
content. and which were accompanied by a sheet of quesrions designed to stimulate a
deeper analysis of the homework material. The workbooks d s o contained a
compilation of Baha'i prayers using ferninine language a n d o r images for the

participants to use at the opening and closing of the meetings, and to be available for
use in their pnvate worship.

The provision of primary-source 'seed stoneswin the workbooks was part of a
two-pronged approach to storytelling. At each workshop, participants would bot h
have a story told to them and receive the seeds of a story on paper. still buned in its
source materials. In each case. the subject of the former would be an Eastern Baha'i
woman, and the latter, Western. My hope was thereby to demystib the story-
building process. to suggest that many stories remain hidden in the texts. and to
encourage participants to see themselves as potenual story-builders.

I divided Eastern and Western stories thus for two reasons. First, if a
participant's curiosity is piqued by the 'seed stories". they are far more likely to be
able to find further information on the subjects if they have been drawn from Our
Western and more recent history. My second reason for this approach was that it
seemed to reflect the nature of Our relationship to our predecessors: as we move doser
temporally and geographically to ourselves. our understanding of characters and
events necessarily becomes more fragmented. complex. and conflicted. Thus. the
clippings and columns of the Western seed stories p r o ~ l d ean informationai and
experiential bridge between the smooth. polished narratives of Our more distant
Eastern foresisters in their stones as told, and the jagged discontinuities we experience
in Our own lives.

Another early major decision concerned how 1 was going to present my tellings
of rhe stories. and which stories 1would tell. For the firsst workshop. needed a story
broad enough to introduce a range of women's issues and themes. accessible enough to
work with an audience which at that point might still be somewhat reserved and

passive. and controversial enough to engage their interest. No one story seemed big
enough. Instead. being a playwright, I wrote a one-act play. which my CO-facilitator
and 1would present as a staged reading at the Tist workshop. The play introduces
participants to two Baha'i women frorn 1910. and allows them to eavesdrop as they sit
on the front porch of their cabin at the first Baha'i school in North America. going
over a copy of the frst issue of the first Bahai newsletter published in the West. My
composite characters are able to voice a range of views (some of which 1 myself
perhaps would not advocate) o n a wide array of issues. accessibly condensing a huge
amount of information about the position of women in the early Eastern and Western
Baha'i comrnunities into a haif an hour of often humorous dialogue. Their at times
provocative gender analysis touches on many historic events. personalities. and
places: as many of these references may be unfarniliar to participants. glossaries were
provided for their perusal prior to the play's presentation. The play was to be
followed by open discussion of the thoughts and feelings it had stimulated. This. dong
with the initial welcomes and introductory exercises. would take up the entire first
session.

In the second workshop. I wanted to explore ideas of masculinity and
femininity. To support this objective. decided to tell the story of a generally
unknown woman named Sakinih Sulian. Eariy in her life. Sakinih was rnarried to a
man who. dong with six of his CO-religionists,was killed for his beliefs in a particularly
gruesome manner; because of this connecrion. her grandson wrote a fairly detailed
account of her life. Her story may be as close as the sources get to an account of the
life of a fairly ordinary early Baha'i woman. After the teiling, participants were to
brainstorm charactenstics of Sakinih Sultan. This would lead into brainstorming and
discussion of masculinity and femininity, as manifested in the story. after which
participants would be asked to explore their own understandings of the masculine and

the feminine. individually and in pairs, and to consider how they are manifested in
their own characters.

This exploration would then be carried into an art activity. A wide array of art
supplies - papers. paints. glues. fabrics. colored glass. metals. wood. brushes. pens.
pends, etc - would be laid out prior to the workshop. and each participant given a
cornfortable work station. For the remainder of the workshop. participants would be
free to worklplay with the art supplies. Their official mandate would be to create
something which represented their relationship to the masculine and feminine within
themselves: however, they'd be free to do whatever they liked.

The theme for the third workshop was unveiling. and the obvious choice for a
story was Tahirih, whose literal unveiling was one of the pivotal moments in the
development of our community. She was an ardent champion of the rights of women.
and utterly unconventional. Her story would provide a perfect stimulus for the
group's exploration of the role of veils and veiling in our own expenence. The story,
however. would require careful treatment. Most participants would already be larniliar
with standard presentations and interpretations of Tahirih's iife. inrerpretations which
üonized Tahirih but left the hearers static, gazing up. Through a subversive re-telling
of the story, 1 hoped to point out the gaps in our knowledge of this supposedly-
known foresister. to highlight neglected questions and parts of her story. and to bring
her closer to the participants. so that they rnight feel both reverence and affinity.

To accomplish this. 1planned to combine a careful scnpting of her story with
participatory theatre. By veiling participants, limiting their right to speak. alrering
their seating. and using mirrors. participants were to be kinesthetically drawn into the
storytelling. After the telling. participants would be given a senes of quick free-writing

triggers exploring their relationships with veils, both literd and metaphoric. This
would be followed by a n t u a h e d unveiling. after which we would be free to speak and
discuss Our expenences. The final element of the workshop would involve each
participant. without feedback. sharing their art piece from the previous session with
the group.

The fourth workshop would focus on boldness. submission. and powerlessness.

1decided to tell the story of Sharns i Duha, one of the many women who appear on the
penphery of Tahirih's story. Although she achieved a certain degree of fame. her
story is still widely unknown. She thus stands somewhere between Sakinih Sultan
and Tahirih in terms of farniliarity. Her story combines instances of both
'ordinarinessw and exceptionality. allowing us to question the othering of heroic
figures. Furthermore. her status as Tahirih's friend provides an opportunity to
challenge atornized interpretations of history. and to present an aiternative telling
which highlights the network of relationships through which many early Bahai
women supported and sustained one anot her's activisrn.

The telling would be lollowed by srnall group work and whole group
brainstorming whic h interrogated concepts of boldness, submission. and
powerlessness, with a focus on how they appeared in Shams i Duha's actions.
Su bsequentiy. participants would be offered a participatory theatre exercise, in whic h
they kmesthetically experience transformations from powerlessness to submission and
from powerlessness to boldness. The workshop would end with a guided visualization
which furthered their reflection on the workshop's themes. (Both the partidpatory
theatre exercise and the visualization are descnbed in detail in the workshop outline
contained in appendix two.)

At the fifth and final workshop. after a great deal of deliberation, 1decided not to
tell a story at all: at this point. the participants' own stories had to become central. if
they were to consider what changes and actions they personally could undertake to
promote the advancement of women. We had to be grounded in the here and now. but
at the same tirne. not limited by it: all too often. what is meant to be an empowering and
supportive sharing of experiences and feelings turns into a mutually depressing
commiseration which inflates Our feelings of grievance and powerlessness without
reinforcing the positive aspects of our tives. While sharing one's pain has a legitimate
place. it can easily stray into confession and back-biting or gossip. aU of which run
counter to Baha'i principles. and the design and Limited duration of this project did not
allow for a sustained support-group situation i n which such a process may be more
adequately handled. I decided that it would b e more productive to promote discussion
which turned Our attention to fertile ground in which growth might be fostered.

To that end. 1 planned to ask participants to discuss and contribure to the
listing and mapping of activities promoting the advancement of women on the global
and local scales. both within and outside of the Baha'i comrnunity. As a corollary. they
would individually write down what was promoting their own advancement on a 'self-
map'. and share one of those items with the group.

Subsequentiy. the group would create a joint-poem describing their vision of
an equal world (descnbed in detail in the attached workshop outline.) Comparison
between the objectives thus compiled. and the actions listed and mapped in the
previous exercise. would. 1hoped. reveal which of Our objectives have been neglected
by the activity already ongoing. This information would feed into a brainstorm of
further activities which might be undertaken to promote the advancement of wornen.
Each participant would then choose one item from this brainstorm to add to their 'self-

maps' as a new undertaking, a 'gift to themselves.' 1would then collect the self rnaps.

which, dong with a transcription of their joint-poem. a copy of their brainstorm of
activities which could promote the advancement of women. their Listing of what in
thernselves they keep veiled, a certificate of participacion. and a post-intervention
evaluation forrn, would be rnailed out to them about two months later.

The workshop would end with discussion. celebration (by way of food),
introduction to an annotated bibliography of sources used in preparïng the project,
and the frliing out of evaluations.

Resul ts

This section wIll summarize what actuaIiy happened, and assess whet.her or not
d i these Iaboriously crafted methods actuaily worked.

What Happened

My first job was to find a group. With the assistance of a community
members hip iist. provided by the Ottawa Local Spiritual Assembly invitations to
apply were rnailed out to a random sample (every fifth woman on the list) and the
workshop series was advertised in the local newsletter. Within a few days, I received
about fifteen c d s from interested women. Ultimateiy. eleven of them applied for the
workshops. As 1 had space for them all. and as they represented a good cross-section
of the cornmunity. al1 of them were accepted.

Ten of the twelve had received invitations by mail. and the other two applicants
came from an outlying community and had heard about the workshops 'through the

grapevine'. Thus. the newsletter posting was quite ineffective - probably moreso
because the ad gave a wrong phone number. Quite a few women caiied or approached
me at Bahg'i events to express their interest but inability to attend: many of them said
they would want to attend a subsequent run of the senes. Perhaps greater response
would have been achieved if the workshops were offered in the fall or winter. when
most people are at home. Another factor cooling the community's response may have
been that several multi-week 'training programs' had recently been offered in Ottawa as
part of a new national Bahai strategy for promoting community education: the local
Baha'is rnay have had their f d of workshops for the time being. or may already have
fully comrnitted their time to such programs.

There is anecdotal evidence that some women in the community felt that they
'weren't qualified" to participate in the workshops. Although the wording of the
advertising. which asked them to "applywto attend. specified that al1 were encouraged
to apply and that the application process was oniy being used ro ensure the diversity
of the group. the idea of applying seems to have intimidated some women. leading them
to believe that participants ought to have some specid knowledge or experience. Their
own fear of rejection prevented them from applying. This is particularly regrettable.
as such women may well have benefitted the most from the workshops.

While 1would have loved to know other women's reasons for not attending. 1

could not think of a way of soliciting this information w'ithout running the risk of
making them feel embarrassed. AS deepening one's knowledge of Baha'i teachings and
ability to irnplement them carries such an emphasis in the community. many women
who chose not to attend may have felt guilty about it. and 1did not want to add to
their burden by asking for an explanation.

In the end. eight women showed up at the first workshop. They ranged in age
from 28 to 60. with an average age of 40. Four were manied. one separated. one
divarced. and two single. Two were of Persian descent. one Polish. one African-
American. and four 'WASP'. While five of them had been Bahhis for twenty years or
more. one of them had been Bahd'i for three years. one for a year. and one for four
months. Half of the group said that they were moderarely active in the cornmunity.
while two members said they were slightly moreso. and two said slightiy less. When
asked if they would c d themselves feminist, five said yes. two said maybe. and one said
no, with the comment that it would -depend on the definition of 'leminist'". Several of
the women were quick to add that they were not uradical ferninists."

Seven of these eight women returned for the remaining four weekly workshops.

Although I initially had planned for a group of a dozen or more. ultirnately the small
group size lent itself to the creation of greater intimacy and ailowed individuals more
space to participate in discussions. Any fewer. rhough. would have been difficult to
work with. Most of the participants did not know each other well prior to the
workshops. although two of them had a history of prior social contact with me.

Space for the group meetings had been arranged at the Ottawa Bahzi'i
Information Centre. in downtown Ottawa. Participants preferred this location.
perhaps because it is easily accessible by bus. Tt dso had the advantage of being a
fairly neutral space. and providing lots of room for our theatre and art exercises.
However. the space was far from ideal. Most problernatic was the lack of privacy: twice,
other meetings were being held at the sarne time at the other end of the large open area,
and on several occasions. loud conversations between info centre staff and drop-in
visitors threatened to disrupt the workshops. 1 found it particularly awkward when
the interruptions occurred d u m g the play or the telling of a story. making it

extremely difficult to keep participants immersed in the dramatic expenence. Even
when we managed to be alone in the centre, the heavy traffic outside the door and the
clanking of the cantankerous furnace provided constant background noise. The space
was also full of fumes frorn an adjoining acrylic nafi emporium (not connected to the
Baha'is). Finally. its cavernous size did not foster a cozy atmosphere: this iast problem
was sornewhat remedied by tucking the group into a partially enclosed corner and
turning off many of the lights. If the group had not clearly expressed its preference
for the centre, 1certainly would have moved the workshops to a more propitious
location. Nonetheless. 1 am very grateful to the Ottawa Assembly for graciously
allowing me to use its centre.

The group agreed upon Wednesday evenings at 7:00 as a mutually convenient
time. On two occasions. a participant was absent. due to either uavel or illness. In the
future. 1 might prefer to offer the workshops on a weekend afternoon. to facilitate the
attendance of mothers of young children. and to avoid group 'burn out' after a long
day at work. Fatigue, in both the participants and myself, cropped up from time to
tirne, and required that we adjourn by ten p.m. whether or not we were ready to do so.
While six of the participants reported that the length of the workshops (2.5 hours) was
'just right*.one participant found them too long: an afternoon time slot would
probably have avoided this problern.

Mthough the five week cornmitment may have dissuaded many women from
applying. the participants seemed to have no problem with it: while five reported that
the number of workshops was 'just right,' two were eager for more. comrnenting "Want
more of everything!" and '1 realize a workshop must end at some point and it ended
with great closure but 1 would encourage another or another few... .33

Although participants seemed engaged and satisfied. 1 felt that the fist
workshop got off to a slow srart. The 'sacred objects' exercise (see appenûix). which
was rneant primarily to break the ice and introduce participants to one another, was
not weU understood by participants (and thus probably not well expiained or
conceived by me). 1was interested to observe the range of objects which represented
the ferninine and the sacred to participants - they ranged from the conventional (lace.
pearls. rose petds) to the quirky (a cantaloupe). Participants were quite guarded with
one another. and the workshop's format was not participatory enough to draw them
out, nor did the sacred objects exercise create a sense of intirnacy and trust.

Furthermore. 1was feeling hamed. as I'd arrived too lare to set the space up
calmly, and had been thrown off by finding that we would be sharing the centre with
others. In consequence. my CO-facilitatorand I were nor quite 'in sync' with each other
when we performed the play - our timing and delivery was a bit off - so although the
group thought it was wonderful, we were both a bit disappointed. as we knew from
previous performances that it could be much better. Nonetheless. after a few hiccups.
a lively discussion ensued. and participants seemed to go home satisfied and eager to
return, unburdened by the knowledge of just how great it could have been.

The second workshop was not so shaky. Participants were seated in a corner
which provided greater intimacy, and they seemed rnuch more comfortabie with one
another. At the sarne tirne, my expectations and anxiety Ievel were much lower. At the
beginning of the workshop. participants were asked if they had any questions or
comments based o n their homework readings: in this and all subsequent workshops,
the homework seemed to have been weU received and read. Participants generally had
one or two things to Say about the readings. but then were ready to move on.

While this workshop's story was very wel1 received. participants had some
difficulty with the ensuing discussion of masculinity and femininity. and tended to talk
across one another and in abstract terms. Partially. this was my fault - 1should have
frarned the discussion differently - but it also may have been due to discornfort with the
topic, which could be quite contentious and emotional. It may be that participants
were not adequately prepared for this degree of disclosure and thus kept their
comrnents bloodless and ethereal. This lack of grit and realism Frustrated at least one
participant, who urged greater honesty. Nonetheless. ail participants contributed to
the discussion.

The art work/play which folIowed was very popular. Although one or two of
the women insisted that they uweren't creative" or "weren't artistic". a l l of them really
got into it. and many of them did not want to go home. The art seemed to relax
participants. who worked calmly. laughing and chatting with one another. and
appeared to take great pleasure in it. Two of the participants identified this as their
favorite workshop: one mentioned that she "liked the sharing. the loving, the creatingeP
while the other explained that 'it was unexpected and 1 never have time to do art
despite that 1 enjoy it very much. It seems to be low on my priority list." Several of
the women were surprised by how much they enjoyed both the process and the
mworks they produced. It was enormously gratibing to see them taking so much
pleasure from the exercise. but also sad to observe how we deprive ourselves of such
simple. restorative activities in Our daily lives.

The third workshop. in which participants were involved in the telling of the
story of Tahirih, was dogged by interruptions. which diffused its impact to some
extent. Nonetheless, the veiling was very powerful, and two of the participants
identified it as their favorite part of the senes. Participants seerned quite moved, readily
responded to my direction throughout the exercise. and then were quite eager to talk

about the experience. While the freewriting exercise generated a lot of insights. it
would have been better if 1 had planned to do something with the results beyond
compiling them on a flipchart and including transcriptions of them in their post-
workshop mail-out packages. The workshop could also have benefitted from greater
use of pertinent scriptures.

By the fourth workshop. the group was working very weI1. Thankfully, this
time. there were no interruptions and we had the centre to ourselves. Participants
were able to engage with the storytelling ana subsequent discussion. However. they
particularly seemed to enjoy the participatory theatre exercise and the guided
visualization. Enough trust had been established that they were ready to use their
bodies. In the theatre exercise. some of the participants were a bit self-conscious. in
that they could not totally forget about the appearance of what they were doing. even
though they were unobserved. However. they vocalized this and recognized that it
needed to be overcome. Al1 of us were surprised by how effective and moving the
exercise was, and how it transformed our ernotional States.

The visualization was also very effective. Aftenuards. participants were calm
and reflective, and spontaneously shared their experiences in the visualization - some
of them quite personal - with a great deal of murual respect and trust. in an atmosphere
that was real withour being gnm. Two of the participants identified this as their
favorite workshop: one because of the "relaxation and expression through our bodies".
while the other said,

> I felt free to express my inner-self during the tableauexercise and was happily
> surprised at the concrete connection between concentration and stance and the
> energy felt and created within. as weU as projected. It gave me a sense of
> connection with everyone. The visuahzation revealed virtues 1 must continue
to work on and ones 1have succeeded at.34

The fifth and final workshop began with a lot of laughter: the group was happy
to see one another again, and very comfortable together. One participant brought
Mies, while another brought a poem that she had wntten based on her expenences
wirh the group. The initial mapping exercise was serni-successful: a less awkward route
to the same results would be preferable. It may have been more effective if
participants had a more active role in the exercise and it somehow involved motion.
The self-map component of the exercise, although greeted with some confusion. was
ultimately more successful. perhaps because it was participatory

The joint poem exercise was similarly well received. and produced quite rnoving
results. However. the group had a bit of trouble when asked to compare the joint
poems' statements of objectives with their self maps' statements of what is dready
happening: either the activity needs to be descnbed more clearly. or it needs co be
redesigned, or both. Perhaps the joint-poem exercise would work better if placed in an
eariier workshop. so that it could be synthesized and analysed by the facilitator(s)
before being presented as a catalys~for discussion.

Despire the bumpy ride, the participants were able to stay on track. Their
ultimare brainstorm of things which could be done to promote the advancement of
women was very fmitful, and dl of them were quite taken aback by the paucity of
activities they were able to identify in the local Baha'i cornmunity. The workshop
ended on a positive. action-onented note. The participants lingered afterwards.
chatting, unwilling to see the process end.

Was It Effective?

Part of my initial task. in designing the methodology for this project. had been
to select means of evaluating its impact. As this would be a single test. with a s m d
group. only very provisional. lirnited results could be hoped for: nonethetes, 1 was
deterrnined to seek resuits more substantive than 'how it felt' and whether or not
everyone seemed to have a good time. This thesis has asked if radical storytelling with
a modified consciousness-raising group of Baha'i women will increase their activism in
the promotion of the advancernent of women: it behooves me to try and provide at
least the beginnings of an answer.

My evaluation methodology was quite simple. Participants filed out a
questionnaire at the first workshop. which gathered personal information. as well as
gauged their attitudes toward the advancement of wornen: this questionnaire was
intended to provide a sort of 'base line" profile of the group prior to the inten7ention.
At the finai workshop. participants filled out an evaluation form. which soughr their
opinions about the series. their advice. and their assessrnent of its impact. Roughly six
weeks after the final workshop. participants received a post-workshop evaluadon f o n .
which asked what they retained from the workshops, what impact the series had had
on thern. and again gauged their attitudes toward the advancement of women. These
formal evaluation tools are appended. and were, of course, supplemented by discussion
and rny own sense of how things were going.

Participant evaluations from the last workshop were generally positive. While
one participant found the series only 'moderately interesting-. d l others rated it very
or extremely interesting. A range of workshop components were identified as most
mernorable. Four participants mentioned the stories and the play; as one commented.
'1 had never corne across such amount of incredible story relling dealing with the

feminine role." Three participants were particularly struck by the group's discussions,
noting both that the diversity of the participants had 'broadened my knowledge and
understanding," and that they'd developed a new appreciation for 'how definitions of
words can separate us and threaten compassion." Two participants identified the art
and theatre exercises and our s h e d joy and 'belly laughter" as most memorable, and
two indicated that they were most impressed by the bard work, 'creativity, honesty.
and talent" of the facilitators. Findly, and most gratifjmgly for me. one participant
said that she'd remernber ' a sense of empowermentwthe most. while another said she'd
remember 'the advancement of women and to keep working and not to give up.*

Ail participants reported that the workshops had been a worthwhile
expenence. One said. 'this is the most profound workshop 1have been a part of in the
Baha'i community or elsewhere.' Three highlighted the storytelling as particularly
useful: one said   have aiways felt disconnected from Baha'i herstory and this helped
me take ownership". while two mentioned that the stories had provided courage, new
role modeIs. and new energy to act and serve. In the same vein. two other participants
described the workshops as empowenng or inspiring action: one even asserted that
the workshops 'helped open my eyes to feminism." Three participants also noted that
'the coming together of all of us as strong women" was joyous and exciting. and had
increased their love for themselves and their Baha'i sisters.

All of this would seem to indicate that the senes had quite an impact on the
participants: however, perhaps paradoxically. al1 but one of them indicated that the
series had changed or challenged their views only to a slight or moderate degree. At
the same time. none of the participants reported feeling uncomfortable with the
information shared - which may suggest good facilitation and judgernent on my part.
but could also imply that my approach should have been more direct and hard-hitting.
One participant said she was uncomfortable with what she perceived as 'generalizing
perceived as 'gener-ng        women as having low self esteem," while another confessed:

> Actually. 1 felt, maybe. 1reveaied more than 1was expected to at times and was
> surprised at how 1 felt moved to talk and share - something 1don't always do
> comfortably.

I was quite pleased by this comment, as it implies that an open. risting group
dynamic was successfully established.

Participants were also asked for their advice about the workshops' design.

While most were content with the arnount of storytelling, two wanted more creative
exercises, three wanted more visualizations, and four wanred more discussion. The
most frequently suggested change to the series was to inctude more discussion which
referred to Baha'i scriptures and adhered to the principles of c o n s u l t a t i ~ n .Journal
keeping and sharing was also suggested in support of this aim. One participant wanted
greater clarification of the connection between the individual workshops and the series'
overall goals, while another asked that the intersection of race and gender be drawn
into the discussion, and felt that there was too much emphasis on differences between
women and men.

Although two participants thought that opening up the workshops to mixed
groups would be preferable. the rnajority were quite adamant that woman-only
workshops provided a necessary 'safe space'. At rhe sarne time. four participants
suggested that running a separate parallel men's workshop series. with occasionai
pracücal win-win joint exercises, would be ideal, as men also need an opportunity to
share and to change. and "we need to experience success in gender unity".

Post- workshop evaluation responses. obtained two months after the final
session, were also overwhelmingly positive. Several participants noted that the

to fully support.

workshops left them feeling 'more liberated" or 'more emancipated": as one of the
women wrote. "the workshops "had the effect of making me feel more free to be me -
open. determined, etc."36 In their pre-workshop questionnaires. participants
unanimously assessed the Bahai community as doing moderately well in its efforts to
practice equality (giving a grade of 3 on a 5 point scale): however. an ovewhelming
majority in the post-workshop evaluations indicated that it was 'very important' that
the community increase its efforts in this regard.37 Although prior to the workshops
many of the participants had mixed or negative feelings about feminism. after the series
four felt that it was 'very importantwthat they increase their activism on gender
issues, one felt it was 'urgent." and one felt it was 'moderately important."

Participants' cornments suggest that the workshops increased both their
awareness of women's oppression and their capacity and inclination to work against it.
One participant said the workshops 'were empowering for me as a Bahai and as a
woman ...[they] made me feel, and still make me feel that there is hope." while another
stated that they had 'reinforced in me the idea that women's roles and visibility and
acceptance must be focussed on." One woman said.

> 1pay particular attention to the role of women. my role as a woman and the
> voices of others when discussing the advancement of women. 1 feel compelled
> to move towards bringing this issue up everywhere...

Yet another comrnented that since the workshops she felt less burdened by destructive
baggage. and intended to increase her efforts to empower men as promoters of equality.
Participants mentioned a range of personal plans for promoting equality. including
bnnging it up at community consultations: proposing it as a topic for discussion in
the Local Assembly andor its comrnittees: integrating ir into childrens' classes
curriculum: giving talks: using 'ferninine" prayers at Baha'i gatherings: and attending
or hosting related workshops and events.

37 Five said ir \vas .very important': one called it *urgenrm.and one called it 'moderarely irnportanr..

While persona1 activism was recognized as 'the only way society can change."

some participants expressed qudms about their ability to take on new tasks, citing
time constraints. personal bagage, hectic schedules or the demands of single
motherhood. One participant consequentiy noted that she felt able to promote her
own advancement, but perhaps not the advancement of women in general. Typically.
however, such concems were raised as inconveniences which complicated but did not
prevent greater activism.

The following comment was particularly interesting. as it suggests that the
workshops may have provoked shifts in both the degree of activism and the methods
used:

> It also had an effect on the thinking process - your approach in the workshops
> was very organized. very systematic presentations. and perhaps now 1 think in
> a more systematic way. It had not occurred to me before but now 1apply my
> capacity for systematic thinking and organization - that 1 use in my work as a
> scientist - to promoting the advancement of women.

The post-workshop evaluations thus suggest that the intervention may have both
increased and altered participants' activism on gender issues.

Many participants identified a concomitant increase in their attachment to their
CO-religionists:one said '1 Feel a closeness to my Baha'i brothers and sisters in rising to
this challenge, particularly my sisters": another stated "it made me feel bonded to other
Bahai women [and] relieved to experience such expressions of an understanding of
women's oppression"; while a third said '1 feel closer to the workshop participants -
especidly the organizers. I also feel closer to the Baha'i wornen of the pasr." Two
participants identified this closeness as the most memorablo aspect of the series: one
was particularly impressed by "the coming together of some strong. loving women in
the community who are concerned for their well-being when it cornes to equaiity. And

are willing to roll up their sieeves to heip in this process.'   The opportunity to
network was further identified as a valuable consequence of the series.

Several participants further expressed an increased connection to the faith
itself. One woman commented. 1

' imagine 1think more as a Baha'i should think or
perhaps how 1think a Baha'i should think," while another said 'It made me think
there's much work to do and ...the best way to do it is through the Faith." One
participant explained:

> I'd like to get more involved in the Baha'i cornmunity's activities too - when 1
> work with Bahais there is more excitement and spirit and encouraging one
> another - but in non-Baha'f organizations 1 often get burned out or discouraged
> as there is too much resistance to ferninisrn.

The deepening of participants' faith and interest in community involvement appears to
be an unanticipated result of the workshop series. One woman suggested that this
involvement itself constituted a significant 3 t e p in the nghr directionwin terms of
promoting equality. The following participant's comment emphasizes this point:

> The workshops especiaLly suggested to me the need to keep closer contact with
> Bahais. T t was very joyful and when we are happy we can do more ...together
> we can do more.

On a more specific level. participants were again ükely to refer to the
storytelling, play, and other uses of the arts as mernorable components of the series.
The use of veils in the third workshop's storytelling was expenenced as particularly
powerful. One participant noted:

> The workshops*emphasis on how more than what was very nice especially for
> me who cornes home exhausted - it made us feel cornfortable. made it interesting.
> The workshops did not stuff us with knowledge and information but were
> teaching us through experience. 1 remember the journey you took us on.

suggested changes for future mns of the workshop series included more meditation:
less emphasis on gender differences: an improved meeting place: a weekend (rather

than week-night) tirne dot: a different approach to the discussion of s e ~ u a l i t ~ : ~ ~
offering a pre-arranged follow-up plan: and lengthening the series in order to
incorporate a broader analysis of gender issues. Four participants said they would
change no thing.

Discussion

Several points raised in the foregoing presentation of this project's results bear
further discussion. First among these is the group's composition. As previously
described, a variety of somewhat complicated methods were used to recruit
participants. The group thereby assembled was problematic in two regards: firsr. as
participants were self-selecting. their attitudes toward gender issues were already
somewhat more radical than t h e 'average' Canadian Baha'is. This concern is bourne
out by comparing the views expressed by participants in their pre-workshop
questionnaires to the range of attitudes found in the Canadian Bahâ'î community by
Will and Debbie van den Hoonaard's study. Expionne Near To The Heart Issues.
Extracts from these questionnaires suggest that participants were aware of inequable
practices in the community, as judged by the following indicators:

> The percentage of women serving in visible capacities in the community. The
> voices of women at leasts are silent. Very üttie respect for 'mothers' as
> educators. There is a struggle for power: men have a hard tirne stepping down ...

there's a long way to go!

> Willingness of the Baha'i community to use this principle as a b a i s for teaching
> systernatically and pubücly. F a n g support and sometimes murmurs of
> discontent when women-only or women-oriented events are run. Failure to
> support International Women's Day ...

38 1 had broached rhis topic in workshop one's play. in which the characrers discuss the sexual
activeness of Baha'ri'llah as the father of 15 (or so) children and the implications of this for Our
understanding of rhe purity or irnpurity of sex and the (fernale) body.

Tasks. duties, performed in traditional ways. ie., women in kitchen. caring for
children. Consultation dominated by men's way of thinking.

> Freedodcourage to express oneself freely. Number of women on the

> work toward this goal harder. They need to be more educated.

> 1have witnessed unwanted sexual advances. 1have heard destructive jokes. ...I
> know spousal abuse takes place in thb community. 1also know it is addressed
> at tir ne^.^^
While the van den Koonaards also found communiv members apt to raise such issues.
they concluded that the majority of Baha'is would be i d i n e d to make more
conservative criticisms. This project, then. may have successfully increased rhe
acrivism of women already more-or-less aware and engaged in the promotion of
equality: how successful it would be with a group of reluctant learners or 'anti-f'erninist'
Baha'is remains to be seen. Those most in need of consciousness-raising are
unfortunately also those most unlikely to voluntarily attend.

The second problem with the group was its size. Although the smallness of the
group ( seven participants and two facilitators ) enabled us to become quite intimate
with one another. it also increased the participants' exposure and made my job more
difficult. These are not serious concerns: however, it is wonh considering why so few
women sought to participate. It is likely that some women were put off or confused by
the required 'application* process: future O ffenngs of the workshop series. free from
academic requirements , can eschew such recruitment techniques and adopt the Iess
intimidating corne-one, corne-all approach common to many Baha'i events. It may
simply be that 1 offered an unattractive opportunity: but as many women expressed

39 Al1 quores taken from surnrnary of questionnaire results. arrached in appendix three.

their interest in the project, 1 do not believe this to be true. It is more likely that the
s m d attendance refiects a broader problem of community support for Baha'i
educational gathenngs. in which the same core of active believers are likely to support
al1 endeavors, while the majority remain peripherally involved in community life.
While the Baha'i community is well aware of this tendency. and often self-critical in this
regard. it may be that this problem is endemic to d l organizations and that the Bahais'
proportion of acrive believers is relatively high. Nonetheles, the problem of
community transformation becomes insurnountable if one is confined to working with
seven people at a time. In order for the workshop series to effect enduring change in
the implernentation of equaüty in the Canadian community, many people must
participate. The Likelihood of this happening is further diminished by the existence of
several ongoing efforts to promote other equally imperative Baha'i objectives within
the community. Alternative or supplemental methods for disseminating the
workshops' information rnay thus be advisable. such as offering the sessions at Baha'i
summer or winter schools, giving condensed presentations at feasts and other
cornmunity meetings, or preparing and distributing related print r n a t e r i a l ~ . ~ ~

A third aspect of this project which may be reconsidered in future renderings is
the location and timing. The space chosen for rhis offering of the seties had obvious
shortcomings; rather than consulting the group and following its suggestions. 1 would
in future be inclined to immediately re-locate if in my view the space was unsuitable. A
mid-sized dance studio would be ide& a home could also be effective. 1would
furthermore follow participants' suggestions regarding the senes' timing and resist
offering the workshop on a week night.

Fourth, several changes in workshop design seem advisable. 1 would be
inclined to add two or three workshops to the series. in order to facilitate the increased

40 *Feastsœare the cornrnunityes regular rneerings. held every 19 days ar the s t a n of a BahSi rnonth.

use of the scnptures and hand-outs contained in participants' workbooks. to include
more meditaüon and discussion. and to more thoroughly address the intersection of
race and gender and women's experience of sexualiy and body image.

1would further aspire to offenng an adapted parallel series of men's workshops,
perhaps with a male CO-facilitator.which could run sirnultaneously and permit some
joint muted-gender activities. Work with Baha'i men on gender issues is an essential
pre-requisite for community-wide activisrn: continuing to offer equdity-promoting
activities for women alone may perpetuate the notion that implernenting equality is
primarily women's responsibility. My failure to offer a paralle1 male-stream in this first
test of the workshop senes is an unfortunate consequence of practicai and time
cons traints.

In addition to these modifications of the structure of the workshop series.

would be inclined to introduce a few specific changes in curriculum. The joint-poem
activity. which investigates indicators of equality, would be moved from the last
workshop to the first. to replace the weaker 'sacred objects*opening exercise. The
discussion of masculinity and femininity in the second workshop would be inregrated
into a kinesthetic exercise: this and several other components of the senes would be
re-designed in order to include greater use of pertinent scriptures. Participatory
methods for the first workshop's play. the final workshop's mapping exercise, and dl
storytelling would be adopted. The results of freewriting and brainstorming would
become more integrated into subsequent activities within the workshops. and
journaling and follow-up activity planning would be added to the program. Finally. on
a more incidental note. would photograph participants' artwork produced in
workshop two for my records.

1would also undertake to challenge participants' views more directly,
particularly their hesitancy to coiiaborate with non-Baha'i feminist groups: this would
ükely require a direct interrogation of the issue of women's seMce on the House of
Justice. 1am ernboldened in this course by the participants' reports that the
workshops challenged or changed their views only slightly. Given the trust and
openness which prevailed. 1am inclined to believe that the group would have tolerated
a deeper investigation of awkward or painful topics. (Of course. going too Far in this
direction would jeopardize healthy group dynarnics). It is also possible that the
participants' self-report in this regard may be sornewhat rnisleading: the materials
presented rnay have confirmed or increased their ability to implement their views
without necessarily being perceived as changing or chailenging them.

I would also not hesitate to counter allegations of man-bashing or emphasizing
difference. One participant in the series raised these sobering charges in her
evaluations: however. neither rny CO-facilitatornor the ot her participants shared this
view, and. while 1 may delude myself. 1 had expressly sought to avoid conveying such
messages. This may be an instance of projection: in any case, would in future
respond promptly and directly to such perceptions.

A sixth issue raised in the presentation of results which bears further
discussion is my evaluation methods. The single largest flaw in this intervention. in
my view, was the poor relationship between the pre-workshop questionnaire and the
post-workshop evaluation tools, which were designed months apart. In future
offerings. the questionnaire will be re-worked to address more directly the indicators of
attitudind and behavioral change which the evaluations seek to assess. This weakness
in the questionnaire significantly limits my ability to categoncally assert that the
workshops achieved their intended purpose. Nonetheless, ar least three conclusions

may be drawn from the evaluations: first. the use of radical srorytelling as a change-
agent arnong Bahd'i wornen appears to both increase rheir dedication to act as
promoters of the advancement of women and to strengthen their atrachment ro the
Baha'i community by enabling them to access and interpret their history: second.
participatory arts-based community intervention methods foster participants'
engagement and investrnent in the process of change and are likely to be rernembered:
and finally. groups of Baba'; women rnay easily and eagerly estabüsh a sense of
sisterhood, characterized by open. supporting, loving communication and connection.
which they find empowering and inspiring. and often lacking in their lives.

Conclusion

In this thesis, 1proposed that religion can be an emancipatory force in the
Iives of women. and that the BahA'i faith has acted as such. increasing the capacity of
early female believers in the East and the West and current Baha'i women around the
world to resist oppressive gender norms. This liberating influence rnay be attributed
to the faith's egalitarian vision of gender, which is cleady enunciated in its central
scriptures. The implementation of this vision, 1 have argued. has differed over time
and space. and has been affected by the comrnunity's maturity and cultural context.
Conservativism on gender issues has surfaced in the current Canadian Baha'i
cornmunity: this thesis sought to test the efficacy of consciousness-raising groups
based on reclaiming Bahl'i women's history as a means to counter this trend by
increasing activism in the promotion of equality.

Despite the aforementioned limitations of the project. the community
intervention methods tested seem to have significantly increased participanrs'
awareness of gender issues and activism in the promotion of the advancement of
women. In addition to benefitting from the workshops*curriculum. 1was surprised to
find that participants appear to have been inspired by the systematic activism
modeiled by me and my CO-facilitatorin the course of this project. The intervention
seems also to have had the unanticipated effect of increasing participants' attachment to
their faith and to the Baha'i community. If, as van den Hoonaard h a noted. the
community tends to lack informal bonds, this sense of connection may be rare and
precious indeed, and is perhaps itself wonh al1 the bother. (After d l . one of the prime
objectives of consciousness-raising is building a sense of 'sisterhood.') The fact that
the workshops' critique of the implementation of equality in the community enhanced

rather than darnpened participants' faith further suggests that this intervention has
respected the beliefs and perspectives of the participants and has helped them further
their own aims. in keeping with the dictates of action research.

From rny own perspective. 1found the process of designing and delivering the
series unexpectedly challenging and full of learning. 1 felt quite unfit to lead the
participants. aIl of whom were older (and perhaps wiser) than me: 1was greatly assisted
by their patience, support, and encouragement. The success of the venture is further
attributable to the ideas, intelligence, and expenence of Faye Dupras. my CO-facilitator.
whose unfailing creativity and audacity shaped many of the most effective components
of the senes, and whose presence in the workshops was immeasurably helpful. In the
future 1 would certainly begin collaborating with her earlier in the planning process.

At the end of any such project, many questions must remain unanswered. As 1

bring this prccess to a close, 1 wonder if this endeavour runs the risk of adding to the
burden of imperatives and duties already bourne by Baha'i women, and if this risk is
mitigated by the fact that this final burden is the duty to free ourselves. 1 seek a
paradigm in which this process gives them wings. gives 'greater boldness." not just
guilt at insufficiency and a babysitter biil.

1 wonder, too, how meaningful such efforts can be in a community so disperse
and diverse as the Canadian Bahi'is. Nonetheless. 1 am encouraged by the ubiquitous
institutional and individual support this project has received. 1 would guess thar the
scope of my efforts to increase the implementation of equality in the community will be
limited only by my own tenacity and vision: if 1should aspire to continue this project
on the regional or national scale. 1 would likely be able to obtain further tangible and
intangible community support. Deciding on the most efficient. effective. and enjoyable

means to continue this project will take some thought: in addition to offenng further
workshops. 1may invest some time in preparing pnnt materials for wider distribution.
to quickly increase widespread access to women's stories and a gendered analysis of
Baha'i history. 1am convinced. however. that text alone will not prove sufficiently
transformative.

1look forward to collaborating with non-Baha'i feminists. whose years of
consciousness-raising work may inforrn further effarts to increase the irnplementation
of equality in Canadian Baha'i communities. institutions. workplaces and homes. arnong
Baha'i children and men and women of ail ages and ethnicities. 1also look forward to
consulting the many knowledgeable and experienced Bahais around the worid whose
labours in this field pre-date my own. so that we rnay collectively conceive means to
rransforrn academic Bahai dialogue on equality into widespread grassroots activism.
Encouraged by the success of this early test venture. 1hope to expand and extend my
own srna11 efforts in this regard, sustained by my belief that in so doing 1promote not
only finite ideas and interests. but rather that 1 ]end rny will 2nd effort to the
immutable plan of God.

five workshops will include storytekng from Baha'i women's history. reflections on
women's experience in the Baha'i community and discussion of ways to promote the
advancement of women.

Why a r e you invithg me?

This is the first time 1have offered these workshops and 1will be trying to
evaluate their effectiveness and see how they could be improved. My hope is that they
can become a powerful tool for the promotion of the advancement of women in the
Baha'i comrnunity. But in order to really find out if they work. 1 need to have a very
diverse group of participants ....not just people who would usudly go to this kind of
thing. but every kind of Baha'i wornan. So in addition to advertising the workshops in
the Cern, 1have randornly picked 30 women in the Ottawa community and have sent
out personal invitations, to encourage them to consider applying for the workshop
series. And you are one of the lucky thirty!

So what wodd Ihave to do?

Well. you would have to commit ro coming to a workshop at the Bahai Info
Centre. every Wednesday night, 7 to 10 pm.. from July 22 to August 19. Al1
interested Baha'i women are welcome to apply for a space in the workshops, but 1 can
only work with a small group. Twenty participants who represent the greatest range
of diversity will be chosen from al1 applications received. But if you are not chosen.
don't despair! 1will offer the workshops again once my research and thesis are
finished.

I want to apply. What now?

dissipated before the manifold revelarions of Thy purpose.

Salutation and blessing and glory upon thee. O Holy Leaf that hath sprung from the
Divine Lote-Tree! 1bear witness that thou hast believed in God and in His signs. and
answered His Cd,and turned unto Him. and held fast unto His cord. and clung to the

of love for His presence and in thy longing to serve Him. May God have mercy upon
him that draweth nigh unto thee, and remembereth thee through the things which My
Pen hath voiced in this, the most great station. We pray God that He may forgive us.
and forgive them that have turned unto thee. and grant their desires. and bestow upon
them, through His wondrous grace. whatever be their wish.

He. verily, is the Bountiful. the Generous. Praise be to God. He Who is the Desire of all
worlds: and the Beloved of all who recognize Him.

The Greatest Holy Leaf

This prayer was revealed by tibdu'l-Baha for die Consort of die King of Mariyrs.

He is God!

Thou seest, 0 my Lord. the assemblage of Thy loved ones. the Company of Thy friends.
gathered by the precincts of Thine dl-sufficing Shrine. and in the neighborhood of
Thine exalted garden. on a day among the days of Thy Ridvan Feast--that blessed rime
when Thou didst dawn upon the world. shedding thereon the lights of Thy holiness.
spreading abroad the bright rays of Thy oneness, and didst issue forth from Baghdad.
with a majesty and might that encompassed al1 mankind: with a glory that made al1 to
fa11 prostrate before Thee. al1 heads to bow. every neck to bend low. and the gaze of
every man to be cast down. They are calling Thee to mind and making mention of Thee.
their breasts gladdened with the üghts of Thy bestowals. their souls restored by the
evidences of Thy gifts, speaking Thy praise. turning their faces toward Thy Kingdorn.
humbly supplicating Thy lofty Realms.

They are gathered here to commemorate Thy bright and holy handmaid. a le& of Thy
green Tree of Heaven. a lurninous reality. a spiritual essence. who ever implores Thy
tender compassion. She was born into the arms of Divine wisdom, and she suckled at
the breast of certitude: she flourished in the cradle of faith and rejoiced in the bosom of
Thy love, O merciful. 0 compassionate Lord! And she grew to womanhood in a house
from which the sweet savors of oneness were spread abroad. But while she was yet a

girl. distress came upon her in Thy path. and misfortune assaiied her, 0 Thou the
Bestower. and in her defenseless youth she drank from the cups of sorrow and pain.
out of love for Thy beauty. O Thou the Forgiver!

Thou knowest, 0 rny Cod, the calarnities she joyfully bore in Thy pathway. the triais
she confronted in Thy love. with a face that radiated delight. How many a night. as
others lay on their beds in soft repose. was she wakeful. humbly entreating Thy
heavenly Realrn. How many a day did Thy people spend. safe in the citadel of Thy
sheltenng care. while her heart was hanied from what had come upon Thy holy ones.

0 my Lord. her days and her years passed by. and whenever she saw the morning
light she wept over the sorrows of Thy servants, and when the evening shadows fell
she cried and called out and burned in a fiery anguish for what had befalIen Thy
bondsmen. And she arose with dl her strength to serve Thee. to beseech the Heaven
of Thy mercy. and in lowliness to entreat Thee and to rest her heart upon Thee. And
she came forth veiled in holiness. her garments unspotted by the nature of Thy
people. and she entered into wedlock with Thy servant on whom Thou didst confer
Thy richest gifts, and in whom Thou didst reveal the ensigns of Thine endless rnercy.
and whose face, in Thine all-glorious Realm. Thou didst make to shine with everlasting
light. She married him whom Thou didst lodge in the assemblage of reunion. one with
the Company on hgh: him whom Thou didst cause to eat of al1 heavenly foods. h m on
whom Thou didst shower Thy blessings. on whom Thou didst bestow the title:
Martyrs' King.

And she dwelt for some years under the protection of that manifest Light: and with al1
her sou1 she served at Thy Threshold. holy and Iurninous: preparing foods and a place
of rest and couches for ail Thy loved ones that came. and she had no other joy but this.
Lowly and humble she was before each of Thy handmaids. deferring to each, serving
each one with her heart and sou1 and her whole being. out of love for Thy beauty. and
seeking to win Thy good pleasure. Until her house became known by Thy name. and
the farne of her husband was noised abroad. as one belonging to Thee, and the Land of
Sad (Isfahan) shook and exulted for joy, because of continual blessings from this
mighty champion of Thine: and the scented herbage of Thy knowledge and the roses of
Thy bounty began to burgeon out, and a great multitude was led to the waters of Thy
mercy.

Then the ignoble and the ignorant amongst Thy creatures rose against him, and with
granny and malice they pronounced his death: and void of justice. with harsh

oppression. they shed his immaculate blood. Under the glittering sword that noble
personage cned out to Thee: "Praised be Thou. O my God, that on the Promised Day.
Thou hast helped me to attain this manifest grace: that Thou hast reddened the dust
with my blood, spilled out upon Thy path, so that it puts forth crimson flowers. Favor
and grace are Thine. to grant me this gift which in ail the world 1longed for most.
Thanks be unto Thee that Thou didst succor me and confirm me and didst give me to
dnnk of this cup that was tempered at the camphor fountain [Qur'an 76:5] --on the
Day of Manifestation. at the hands of the cupbearer of martyrdom. in the assemblage of
delights. Thou art veniy the One full of grace. the Generous. the Bestower."

And after they had killed him they invaded his princely house. They attacked like
preying wolves. like lions at the hunt, and they sacked and plundered and pillaged.
seizing the rich furnishings, the ornarnents and the jewels. She was in dire peril then.
left with the fragments of her broken heart. This violent assault took place when the
news of his martyrdom was spread abroad. and the children cned out as panic struck at
their hearts: they waüed and shed tears. and sounds of mourning rose from out of that
splendid home. but there was none to weep over them. there was none to pity them.
Rather was the night of tyranny made to deepen about them. and the fiery Hel1 of
injustice blazed out hotter than before: nor was there any torment but the evil doers
brought it to bear, nor any agony but they inflicted it. And rhis holy Ieaf remained.
she and her brood. in the grip of their oppressors. facing the malice of the unmindful.
with none to be their shieId.

And the days passed by when tears were her only companions. and her comrades were
cries: when she was mated to anguish. and had nothing but grief for a friend. And yet
in these suffenngs. O my Lord. she did not cease to love Thee: she did nor fail Thee. O
my Beloved, in these fiery ordeals. Though disasters followed one upon another.
though tribulations compassed her about. she bore them d l . she patiently endured
them d l , to her they were Thy gifts and favors. and in al1 her massive agony--0 Thou.
Lord of most beaureous names--Thy praise was on her lips.

Then she gave up her homeland. rest. refuge and shelter, and taking her young. like
the birds she winged her way to this bright and holy Land--that here she might nest
and sing Thy praise as the birds do. and busy herself in Thy love with d l her powers.
and serve Thee with all her being. ail her sou1 and h e m . She was lowly before every
handmaid of Thine, humble before every leaf of the garden of Thy Cause. occupied
with Thy remernbrance. severed from al1 except Thyself.

And her cries were lifted up at dawntide, and the sweet accents of her chanting would
be heard in the night season and at the bright noonday, until she returned unto Thee.
and winged her way to Thy Kingdom; went seeking the shelter of Thy Threshold and
soared upward to Thine everlasting sky. 0 my Lord. reward her with the
contemplation of Thy beauty. feed her at the table of Thine eternity. give her a home
in Thy neighborhood. sustain her in the gardens of Thy holiness as Thou wiiIest and
pleasest: bless Thou her lodging. keep her safe in the shade of Thy heavenly Tree: lead
her, 0 Lord. into the pavilions of Thy godhood, make her to be one of Thy signs. one
of Thy lights.

Verily Thou art the Generous, the Bestower, the Forgiver, the All-Merciful.

Green Acre Front Porch

Spring I9I O, ac a sumriier resorr in Maine. Two rocking chairs sic on a fow pladorm. a
small cable and lamp bercveen chem. In one of the chairs s i s Mildred. wich a book. She
looks ar a pockec warch.

Mildred: Oh. ifs a fine time to be gone üke this. isn't it, and a right long time she's
been gone now, too. Past half an hour. And I'U just pop over, she said, back in a tik.
And what if you turn your ankle. I said, what if it gets dark. with the rain coming on?
What rain. she says. and 1says, oh, 1 know rain. rny dear, what with the rainstorms
f i e seen. up there in Newfoundland, caught out in a storm with the rain coming
down like God's wrath. and knowing that the men are still out there in the boat.
They'U be corning home with sait boils and half dead with cold if they're coming home
ar all. Oh, 1 know a Storm coming when 1smell one. But, Millie dear, she says. 1'11 be
quite alright. The dear Lord, and all that. and I says. the dear Lord helps those who
help thernselfs. and then doesn't she up and go. (stands. looking for Pm) Tsk.

Pru eniers. carrying a rea rray and a bundle of papers under her a m . Millie s i ~ .

Pm: (cds ou[) Were you looking for me. then?

Millie: No.

Pru: Sorry to worry you.

Millie: Just stretching my legs.

Pm: Sarah did want to chat.

(Pru p u s the lea uay on rhe table; rhey sir)

Millie: Wasn't worried a bit.

Pm: You know how she gets Ionely. And then 1had to wait for the kettle.

Millie: What've you got there?

Pm: Well. What took so long is. after Sarah'd got herself al1 settled down. and we'd
had our chat. and I'd made my excuses. see. 1told her you'd be worried. on account
of a rain coming -

Millie: Not at d.

Pm: And she said fiddlesticks, if it was going ro rain. she would have felt it in her bad
hip. but I told her you could smell it -

Millie: In any case -

Pm: Well. and then 1 got the tea dl ready to b r h g back to surprise you, d o i t you
like it?

Millie: Very kind of you, m'dear.

Pru: And then just as 1was leaving, who should arrive.

Millie: The posrman?

Pm: So Sarah said 1should stay. in case rhere was somerhing for us. you know. and
so 1did. but then the tea got bitter from sitting too long. so 1 had to throw it a l l out
and start over. But Iook at this.

Millie: Well. will you look at that. Baha'i News. volume 1 number 1. WhoTdhave
thought.

Pru: Isn't it something?

Millie: It's a piece of history, that's what. And look. at the top. there: Gertrude
Buikema, editor.

Pru: Why d'you suppose they put Albert's narne first?

Millie: Because he's more important. of course! Well, well. well.

Pm: Would you lüce some tea?

Millie: Oh, yes , please, dear.

Pm: Sarah's not so well. (pours the rea)

Millie: No?

Pm: No. 1wouldn't be surprised if...well. You know thereVsbeen talk of a
sanatorium.

Millie: You can never be too careful. 1always said. All it took was one bad f d .

Pm: It's a shame, really.

Millie: How's her spirits. then?

Pru: Muddled. I'd Say.

Millie: After all she's done.

Pm: She's afraid they'll lock her up.

Millie: Now who would do such a thing?

Pm: Well, you know how you get to thinking once you've been cooped up too long.

Millie: Paranoid.

P m : Tt's her nerves.

Millie: Poor dear.

Pm: Why don't you read us a bit, then.

Millie: Poor Sarah. I really should go see her.

Millie: Well. will you look at this.

Pm: Sweet looking fellow. But rather rnelancholy, isn't he.

Millie: It's the Master's poor dear dead brother.

Pm: You don't say!

Millie: 'We were imprisoned in the bai-racks. without any substantial change in our
manner of life, for two years. During t h s time none of us Lefr the prison." Can you
imagine the smell?

Pm: There must have been toilets and bathtubs. surely. In that climate?

Millie: In a pnson. though? Three bare rooms, that's what Lua said. and eighty-some
people sharing them.

Pm: Lord have mercy.

Millie: 'One evening towards the end of the second year. my younger brother came.
as was his habit. to write for his Father. But as he was not very well. and as others of
the family were also ill, the Blessed Perfection (Baha'o'llah) told him to go and corne
Iater. So he wenr up to the flat roof of the barracks. where we were accustomed to
walk. and which was our only recourse for fresh air and exercise." Imagine. waiking
on the roof.

Pm: Rather dangerous, I'd Say.

Millie: "He was waiking up and do             iting Tablets and gazing at the sky. when
he sturnbled. lost his balance, and fell through the opening to which the ladder [rom
beIow led up.

Pm: Good God.

Millie: The room into which he fell had a lofty ceiling: it was the living room of the
family. No one was in the room at the time. but hearing his cries. some of the family
rushed in and found hirn in a heap on the fioor with blood pouring from his mouth."

Pru: Oh. heavens.

Millie: 'We took hirn up and laid hirn on his mat. He was perfectly conscious. Later
the Blessed Perfection came and remained with him. The physician was sent for: he
said that there was no hope."

'My brother Xved for thirty hours." Thirty hours! 1 hope the dear boy had
sornething for pain!

Pm: A slug of scotch. at least.

Millie: Would they have had such a rhing?

Pm: Perhaps opium.

Millie: You don't think?

Pru: It is marvellous for pain.

Millie: Well. 1hope they had something. "When he was about to pass away the
Blessed Perfection said to him: 'What do you desire? Do you wish to live. or do you
prefer to die? Teil me what you most wish for." My brother replied: '1 don't care to
live. 1 have but one wish. 1 want the beUevers to be admitted co see their Lord. If
you will promise me this. it is al1 1ask." Can you imagine? 'The Blessed Perfection
told him that it would be as he desired."

'The death of this youngest and favorite child - of a very gentle and sweet
disposition - nearly broke his mother's heart. We feared for her reason." Well. I
should think so. Can't you picture it. Pm, her raging around them dingy rooms?
The wind howling in the bars? Beating her fists on the walls. tearing her hair. and d l
that? Orientais are so passionate. you know.

Pm: It's like Shakespeare. or one of your Brontë novels. I'd go mad.

Millie: 'When the BIessed Perfection was told of the condition of his wife, he went to
her and said: 'Your son has been taken away by God that his people might be freed.

E s lire was the ransom, and you should rejoice that you had a son so dear to give to
the Cause of God." When our mother heard these works she seemed to rally. and
after that she did not shed a tear." How can that possibly be?

Pm: She'd given her husband to God already. You'd think that was enough to ask of
one woman.

Millie: He was her sixth lost, too.

Millie: First Kazim, then two 'Ali-Muhammad's. and another boy in Tehran.

Pm: How did she lose them?

Millie: Who knows. Men don't keep track of thar sort of thing. do they. They don't
wnte it down. It mustn't be important. Not to them. anyway.

Pm: Maybe its too private.

Millie: And then the fifth. in Baghdad. Bahiyyih Khanum remebered how he went.

Pru: It was thar Mina Yahya. wasn't it. keeping the doctor away and letting the boy
die?

Miliie: That's the one. And him just a babe in arms. They all knew he was dying.
too. but whar could they do? Shat Yahya was in charge. what with Baha'u'llah being
up in Kurdistan. and the women couldn't just cal1 the doctor themselves. not in
those days.

Pm: So then he died.

Millie: Yahya gave his wee body to a stranger in the Street. Baha'u'llah's own son.
To this day they don't know where he lies.

Pm: You'd think she would have lost him, what with losing her house. and
Baha'u'llah going to prison, and living in fear with the three kids and not a sou1 to

care for her. and then three months going to Baghdad in the dead of winter. sick and
hungry and ail? And pregnant through ail thar? It's a wonder she didn't miscarry.
And then to Iose him anyway, on account of that person.

Millie: You wonder if He knew, up there in the mountains. If an angel told him. or
something. BahCu'llAh's own son. You'd think God would have wanted Him to
know.

Pm: But then He'd have come back, surely. Ir was two years He was gone, Millie.

Millie: She can't have bourne it.

Pm: It must be the hand of God touched her or something. to give her the strength.

Millie: Seeing as most of the time the hand of God lived down the hall.

Pm: Tsk! But it's something to think about. isn't it, Him having ail those kids?
Cause. you know. they didn't just come from thin air.

Milhe: And there was seven more from the other two wives. 'Course. most of them
died too. But stiU. that's 15 kids.

Pru: It's a far cry from the virgin Jesus. isn't it.

MiUie: Prudence!

Pru: But it makes you think. It can't really be a sin. then. can it.

Millie: (leasing) Why don't you ask one of the Persians.

Pm: Sure. But it does make you wonder. you know. ail those people sayng the
body's a vesse1 of sinfulness. and ail that.

Millie: Especiay a woman's.

Pm: Funny no one mentions it.

Millie: Makes them too squirmy, I'd guess.

Pm: But we're not Christian Scientists, you know. Denying the body, and a l l that.

1Say, deny al1 you want, it's not going anywhere. and it's a good thing LOO. It's not
evil, you know.

Millie: Old habits die hard-

Pm: But they don't die at all if you don't think they ought to.

Millie: Give it time. Pm. We're just babies.

Pm: Stubborn ones at that.

Millie: Some of us more so tfian others.

Millie: Shall 1go on, then? "Reception to Dr. Moody ir. Tehran." it says. A party for
Susan. It's from the 'Maidservants of God in Teizran, to the maidservants in
Washington. DC.and in other cities of the West." Now then. 'He is God. O ye sons
and daughters of God! May our iives be a sacrifice to you!" Tell me, Pru, have you
ever in your entire Life begun a letter like that?

Pm: Don't be snippy.

Millie: I'm just saying. It's so peculiar. 'In this Day the maid-servants of Baha have
gathered in this house this morning and are engaged in reading the Tablets and
discussing spintual rnatters with Dr. Moody.' Thar rneans they'd be having a good
old gab. I'd guess.

Pm: Oh. they're much too devout for that.

Millie: Wornen are wornen. And men too.

Pm: Oh, don't start.

Millie: 'She presented to us the photograph of Mrs. Henrietta Clark Wagner. which
was sent for Fareeza Khanum. It gave us great happiness and pleasure when we
looked upon it. Those who were present in the meeting kissed ir many tirnes and it

was as though that spintual sister was present among us." Oh. that's a Little much,
don't you think?

MiUie: 'We read Tablets and convened until lunch time. and after the lunch the girls
of the Bahai school chanted for us with a beautiful melody the Tablet of the Clarion."

Pm: Which one is that?

Millie: Don't know. 'We missed all of you. Afterward this maid-servant of Baha and
other maid-servants of the Cause of God, and some of the remnmts of the
martyrdoms of Yazd, served tea." Imagine saying who served the tea.

Pm: Isn't that romantic, Millie? Wouldn't you much rather be called a 'remnant of
so-and-sotwthan a plain old widow?

Millie: If a woman dies. d'you suppose they cal1 her husband a remnant?

Pru: 1doubt it.

Millie: "After the tea Dr. Moody sang a holy commune. The meeting was overflowing
with joy and fragrance, and this maid-servant read one of the Tablets of Abdul-Baha.
About 4:30 p.m. the men began to corne. and the grandson of the 'Beloved of the
Martyrswof Isphahan was present and chanted for us a glorious Tablet with a sweet
melody." (reading ahead) And then there's a bit about the picture of the Purest
Branch, how it was hard to End. but the Master told her to get it for the American
believen, and so on. 'We hope that the news of America will reach us often and that
you will communicate with us regularly. Upon ye be Baha," etc. It says 106 women
and 14 men signed it.

Pm: So at least 106 women in Tekiran can write their own names.

Millie: Thank God. What's next...the Unity Band is still at it...12 women writing to
Wornen's hsemblies in the Orient.

Pm: The same as last year?

Millie: Isabella Brittingharn. Pauline Barton-Peeke. Ida Finch. Henrietta Wagner,
Marie Botay. Harriet Latimer. Louise Waite. Elizabeth Stewart. May Maxwell -

Pm: Where's May writing?

Millie: Zanjan. Wherever that is. Leslie O'Keefe, Claudia CoIes. and Emma Goodaie.

Pru: I'd love to do sornething so noble as that. I'm just not reliable enough.

Millie: You do lots of other noble things. Pm. Besides. we can't afford the postage.
1s there more tea?

Pm: Dyou üke it. then? It's meant to be good for the digestion. (refi[ls cup) The
Swarni left it for Sarah.

Millie: Oh, don't teil me that. I was just liking it.

Pru: 1s that a new Tablet?

Millie: Seems to be. The frrst time published, it says.

Pm: How nice.

MIllie: It's a long one. too.

Pm: Don't read it out. III1 take a walk this afternoon, and sit sornewhere beautiful
and read it myself. Maybe by the river. Oh. it'll be so lovely and calm. And the
wind'll whisper in the pines...it'll be just like the wind is whispering the Blessed
Beauty's tablet to my inner being. Don't you think?

Millie: You won't be taking my Baha'i News out in the rain.

Pru: Ii's not going to rain. even the postman was saying so.

Millie: Oh. the postman. Have you taken a shine to this postman. then?

Pm:     have not.

Millie: Oh. look. here's an interesting bit. Oh. sorry. 1won't read it.

Pru: Oh. go ahead.

MilLie: You sure? ' O People! The word must be dernonstratecf by the deed. for the
nghteous witness of the Word is action. The former without the latter shalI not allay
the thirst of the needy nor open the d o o n to the sight OF the blind. The Heavenly
Wise One proclaimeth: A h a n h word is like a sword, but gentle speech is like unto
milk." Oh. thafs lovely. 'The children of the world attain to knowledge and better
themselves through this. The Tongue of Wisdom says: Whosoever possesses Me
not. has nothing. Pass by whatever exists in this world and find Me. 1 am the Sun of
Perception and Ocean of Science. 1revive the withered ones and quicken the dead. 1
am the light which illumines the path of Insight. 1am the Falcon of the Hand of the
Almighty; 1bear heding in My wings and teach the knowledge of soaring ro the
Heaven of Truth."

Pru: That's so beautiful, Millie!

Millie: Are you sure you want me to go on? Even without the pine trees. and dl?

Pm: Go on.

Millie: "OFriend! As there were few ears to hear, so for some time the Pen has been
silent in its own chamber and to such a degree that silence has preceded utterance."
Now. what do you suppose that means?

Pm: We'll ask Lua, when she gets back.

Millie: 'Say, 0 People! Words are revealed according to capacity. so that the
beginners may make progress." That's us. 1suppose. 'The rnilk must be given
according ro the measure. so thar the babe of the world may enter into the realm of
grandeur and be established in the Court of Unity."

Pru: That's quite a lot of talk of breast milk, isn't it?

Millie: I suppose so. You don't think of it. do you.

Pm: The Holy Scriptures as breast rnilk. God nursing the world. It's quite an
image. you know. A Far cry from the God we grew up with, isn't it.

Millie: Oh, look. They've set the convention program. Had a meeting at Corinne
Tme's.

Pm: Now, there's a few folk around there who could use a close reading of this here
tablet. don't you think? k i n g how it goes on about moderarion of speech. and all
that?

MiUie: It's a sharne, that whole mess. Good men and women wasting their breath
fighting each other when they just ought to be getting on with Cod's work.

Pru: And it's been such a long time. Nearly ten years now. isn't it. with the separate
Assernblies in Chicago. and who knows where al1 else. Going on over silly things.
r e d y , like where to put the centre, what meetings to hold, for pity's sake. Husbands
and wives fighting over it.

Millie: It's ridiculous. really. 1 mean, the men's assernbly may feel it's right. calling
itself a House of Justice. and all. and for al1 I know right they may be. But when
three quarters of your community is women. it's just good sense to mind their toes a
little.

Pm: Not that al1 the women were up in arms. There was Ida Brush. as good as
saying the woman's place is in the home. Which got al1 the suffragists going. didn't
it.

Millie: Of course it did. And such cliquiness. Each little group of women with their
own axe to grind. Of course. men are just the sarne. But you don't catch folks saying
so, now, do you.

Pm: But you have to admit, the men were good, for the most part. even in 1902.
when they got hold of Corinne's Tablet saying the House of Justice was just for men.
They didn't lord it over the women. 1heard. And if there was grurnbling. folks kept
it to themselves. Such lovely letters frorn the Master to set things right.

m e : But really, Pm. Women are good for more than rnaking cakes and
decorations.

Pm: 1know. Ifs hard on them. I'11 grant you that. Some feel it's not nght. still,
women not having a say in things. at least. not oficially. Iike. But we do do more
than cakes. Millie, you have to admit. There's a lot of care to the sick and needy goes
on on account of us women.

Millie: Corinne showed me a tablet, Pm. She got it last year. And it says, plain and
simple, that the Universal House of Justice is for men only, and that everything else.
including the Spiritual Assemblies, is for men and women both. She showed that
men's assembly. but they just don't see it. They think they're a House of Justice,
Pm. they're so used to being our lord and master that they can't see the word of God
plain for what it is.

Pru: Millie.

l    e They told Connne that they weren't going to put women on the Assembly.
and that they weren't going to publish her tablet. neither. for fear of stirrîng up
'misunderstandings". Misunderstanding. my eye.

Pru: Now, now.

Pm: Don't upset yourself.

Millie: It's just so plain that God wanted it one way. and here we go straight off
doing things the other way. and I just don't see how that's going to do anything to
help us reach a i l those poor people out there with God's love, when we can't even
sort out a stupid thing like this amongst ourselves.

Pm: Tsk.

Millie: They even checked the translation. Pm.

Pm: They must think they're a Universal House of Justice.

Millie: But they're not. He even said. in 1902. remember. there was that tablet.

calling them the spiritual assernblies. or a house of spirituality, or a spiritual house.
or wharever. but not a House of Justice.

Pm: They mean well, m e .

Millie: They're wrong.

Pm: WeU. it's not for you to tell them. We must support the assemblies, dear.

Millie: 1know.

Pm: Corinne's got you al1 worked up.

Pru: The Master will set it ail right. Millie. You wait and see. I'd be willing to ber he's
got sornething up his sleeve. But you mustn't go on about it. It's no better out in
San Francisco. you know, where the women run everything. Mason was saying the
men can't get a foot in the door because the women are having d l the Baha'i meetings
in the damme when they're at work.

Millie: Of course they're in the daytime. The women can't get out at night. can they!
Who'd mind the children?

Pm: But really. it's not fair to the men.

Millie: P hooey.

Pm: We mustn't argue. It's too bad for our black litùe souk.

Millie: She aura reader who was here last week distinctly said that my sou1 was
magenta. So there.

Pm: Purple with rage. no doubt.

Mme: Oh, phooey.

Pm: Anyhow. what's next? You're taking forever to get through it!

Millie: Well, if you'd stop intermpting me. Let's see. 'Persia. In a Letter from the
Bahai Assernbly at Mashad, Persia, dated October 18, l9Q9. is the foIlowing:"

Pru: (teasing) Do you suppose they have women on their assemblies. Millie?

Millie: Well, they should! 'The latest news which has happened in these parts. is
that two villages in the Province of Khorassan. called Hassar and Narnag" ...1

four of Our spiritual sisters were assaulted and wounded. and they have cut off the
ears of one of the believers; while other Bahais have been the subjects of persecution.
pillage, etc." My God, Prudence. What do you suppose they mean by 'etc?"

Pause

Pru: 1 think it's started to rain.

Millie: There's another letter from Susan. with a picture. Gosh. Will you look at
them. Pm. 'Please redeem a promise 1have made to the sisters here that their photo

Pm: They think women are fools. Or maybe think we're really clever. but wicked.

Harriet Beecher Stowe said women are morally superior. and we're responsible for

'Green Acre Front Porch" O Sophie Tamas 1998.

Green Acre

A Baha'i school in Eliot. Maine. on the Piscataqua River. Green Acre was
founded as a resort hotel in 1890 by Sarah Farmer and four business partners. By
1894\. Sarah had turned it into a retreat for the study of comparative religion.
Lectures on science, business, languages, etc. were offered d o n g with courses in
dozens of religious traditions. Farnous mystics and swarnis such as Vivekananda
frequented Green Acre during this penod. By 1901 Sarah's partners had become
critical of her increasing ernphasis on the BahA'i teachings. and Green Acre was beset
by legal and financial trials. In 1912 'Abdu'l-Baha spent a week at Green Acre and
asserted that it would be the site of the f i s t Bahai university. Gradually the role of
ascetics. spiritualists, and fortune tellers waned as Green Acre became solely devored
to Baha'i teachings. From its inception, the arts played a prominent role in Green
Acre's activities, with classes in pottery and a range of crafts: many pageants. plays.
musicds, and poetry readings: a Stream of resident painters: and weekly dances. In
its early days, many Baha'i women would spend the summer resting at Green Acre as
it's water and air were deemed healthful and restorative: this phenornena occurred
within the context of the late-Victorian women's Spa movement. in which many
upper and middle class women becarne chronic invalids as a means to escape the
confinements of a proper Victorian woman's life. Spas and retreats like Green Acre
gave such women physical and intellectual stimulation and freedom from their
domestic obligations.

Sarah Farmer

Founder of Green Acre, the only surviving child of well-to-do and free-
thinking parents. whose home was a station on the underground railroad. The
Farmers were transcendentalists and gave a great deal to charity. Her mother
Hannah was a prominent abolitionist. philanthropist, and early feminist, who
founded a country retreat for unwed mothers and poor working women from the
Boston slums, while her father was an electrical engineer and prolific inventor. In
1900 Sarah went on pilgrimage. met 'Abdu'l-Baha. and became a BahCi. She single-
handedly ran Green Acre. with the financial backing of her frïend Phoebe Hearst.
until 1907, when she became an invalid as the result of a bad Ml. In 19 10 she went
to a sanatorium, returning bnefly to Green Acre for 'Abdu'l-Baha's visit in 1912.

during which he directed a few of her fnends to End a legal means to get Sarah out of
the sanatorium. Eventudy it became apparent that she was being held against her
will. and in 1916 a group of Baha'is obtained a warrant for her release and kidnapped
her from the sanatorium against the protests of her doctors. She was very glad to be
back among her friends and things, and died peacefully a few months later.

The first newsletter of the Baha'i cornmunity in the West was started in March
1910\. In 1911 its narne changed to Star of the West. and in 1922 to the Baha'i
Magazine. It eventudy included a Persian section and had a substantial circulation
in both the West and the East. It was a key tool for the consolidation of Bahd'i
communities. Issues from March 19 10 to March 1924 were bound and published by
George Ronald in 1978. These newsletters are a source of many delightfully
surprising nuggets of history.

The Purest Branch

Named Mihdi. he was the second-last chitd of Asiyih Khanum and Baha'u'llah.

When the family left Tehran in 1853, in the dead of winter and with scant provisions
for the journey, Asiyih was persuaded to leave Mhdi. rhen about 3 years of age. with
her grandmother, as he was too weak to make the difficulr journey. He was reunited
with his farnily seven years later. He was a faithful Baha'i, and ofren served as his
Father's secretary. He was about 20 years old when he died.

Christian kien t i s ~

In the late 1800s. a great deal of religious experimentation was going on in the
United States. Swedborgians. Theosophists. Spiritualists. Shakers. and many others
sought new religious solutions for the dilemmas of the time. Wornen's access to
leadership roles in rhese new religious movements was often greater than in
traditional churches. Christian Science emerged during this period under the
leadership of Mary Baker Eddy. who. among her other teachings. promoted the
concept of the body as an illusion and referred to the Divine as a 'Father-Mother
God."

This early Baha'i woman is farnous for her years of service in Iran. She was
born in New York in 1851 to an upper-class. conventional Scottish farnily. After
working For a time as a school teacher. she began medical school. but broke it off to
study music. painting. and sculpture for several years in Chicago, Philadelphia. New
York, and Paris, berore finally completing her training as a doctor. In 1903 in
Chicago she was taught the Bahai Faith by Isabella Brittingham, and became a
confumed believer, soon opening the frst Bahai Sunday SchooI in Chicago. In 1908
'Abdu'l-Bah2 asked her to go to Iran to serve as a doctor. She stopped in Akka en
route and an-ived in Tehran in 1909, soon l e m i n g Persian (Farsi), and sending
many letters home describing women's condition in the East and her work there.
Over the next fifteen years. she established a hospitat. serving as its superintendent
and head of gynecology. and initiated the opening of a girl's school. In 1925.
conditions in Iran forced her return to Amerïca. In 1928, the Guardian asked her, at
77 years old, to return to Iran. She did so. and remained working there until her
death in 1934.

The Uniry Band

A group of Arnerican women, formed in the early 1900's. which sought to
increase amity and unity between Bahai women of the East and the West by
corresponding regularly with Women's Assemblies in a variety of cities in Iran.
Interest in such East-West exchange was fairly common at the tirne, as OrientaIism
was very popular in everything from home decor to scholarship. Generally.
however. it took the form of rnissionary work. premised on notions of Western
cultural and religious superionty. Ironicaliy. this clairn to superiority was often
supported by comparing the oppression of women in the East to the 'libertyw of
women in the 'enlightened" West. Contemporary texts often descnbed in lush.
creative detail the dissipation and debauchery of the East. and the 'sensual" nature of
Orientais was seen as another sign of Western superiority. Women's initiative in
rnissionary efforts in the East was reinforced by their newfound legitimacy as the
spiritual guardians of their race ( see 'Harriet Beecher Stowe". below) - However.
unlike most such efforts. which sought to impose a Western. 'superior". white.
Christian belief-sysrem on Eastern lands. Western Baha'is in East-West ventures
were new converts to an (at the time) essentially Eastern religion. whose teachers and
leaders were virtually all Persian. As such. although most of the Western Baha'is
concerned probably shared many of their culture's prejudices about the East. Baha'i
East-West organizing. which was very active in the early 1900s. did not sirnply
represent another example of Western cultural imperialism.

Corinne True

A prominent early Baha'i woman. Born in 1861. she married and bore 8

children. Although svictly raised by her father, a Presbyterian minister. the deaths
of five of her children and her husband led her to seek spiritual alternatives. turning
to Unity, Divine Science and Christian Science before becoming a firm Baha'i in
1899\. Following her frst pilgrimage in 1907, she became a central supporter of the
Temple building campaign. handling the massive project's finances and writing many
progress reports for the Baha'i News. She received many letters from 'Abdul-Baha
and was one of the key figures in the debate over women's participation in BahaTi
administrative bodies. She made nine pilgrimages in ail. and was elected to the first
American National Spintuai Assembly in 1922. I n 1952 the Guardian named her a
Hand of the Cause of Cod. She was an ardent teacher and travelled widely for the
faith in Europe and North America. She died in 196 1. in her one hundredth year.

Women's Assem blies

In the early l9OOs, as Baha'i communities in the West began organizing
thernselves, there was a great deal of debate over women's eligibility to serve on
communities' elected executive committees. and about what such committees should
be called. In some communities, women and men served together until about 1902,
after which women were deemed ineligible. These decisions were based on
rnisinterpretations of poor translations of guidance from 'Abdu'l-Baha. The debate
over women's representation on elected councils in the Baha'i community reflected
the iarger suffrage battle raging in America at the time. Among Bah&. however, the
issue was further complicated by the fact that women made up two-thirds to three-
quarters of the early Western cornmunity: thus, despite the male governing councils.
the real power in the community lay with women. Often. these women organized
paralle1 'Women's Assemblies, " which took on responsibility for teaching campaigns .
philanthropie work, fundraising. corresponding with Eastern communities. and a
variety of other duties, sometimes including catering and hosting events planned by
the "offinal" (men's) assemblies. Relations between men's and women's assemblies
were at times cooperative, and at other times hostile. Many letters were sent to
'Abdul-Bahb by Baha'is of differing views. asking for His guidance. which when
received inevitably ernphasized *the need for unity and cooperation between women
and men in the cornmunity. By about 191 1, the Master had become quite b l u n ~in
His cal1 for single. mixed-gender governing councils. A thorough analysis of this
aspect of Western Baha'i history has not yet been published: however, you may
refer to Robert Stockman's article "Women in the American Baha'i Community. 1900-

1912," in World Order, Winter 1993-1994, for some of the relevant tablets and
additional information.

Ida Brush

A prominent member of the Chicago Baha'i community in the early 1900s. In
1909 she wrote a paper. based on her interpretation of tablets by 'Abdu'l-Baha.
which argued that women and men should have separate spheres. and that men's and
women's assemblies' complementary functions paralleled that of a husband and wife.
Her paper went on to support the popular Victorian ideals of "virtuous womanhoodw
and "educated motherhood" (see below) ignoiing writings which indicate that women
s-uld engage in trades and professions and avoiding reference to the central Baha'i
teaching of the equality of women and men. This paper appears to have represented
the views of a minonty of Baha'i women. However. it is interesting to note that
when, in 19 12, 'Abdu'l-Bahd asked the Chicago Bahavisto re-elect a mixed assembly,
both Ida Brush and Corinne True were arnong the women elected.

Hamet Beecher S~owe

A prominent Victorian author. one of several contributors to the 'cult of
virtuous womanhood". She and her sister Catherine Beecher enunciated a new
vision of women as the spiritual saviors of their families via their edifying influence
as mothers. Defenders of this view. while usually rnaintaining that the woman's place
was the home, argued that through proper performance of their child-rearing and
wifely duties women in fact had a significant. it not central. role in the shaping of
sociev. While the equality of women and men was not suggested. women were
descnbed as inherently rnordly superior, as the urnoral guardians of the racesmThis
view was used to defend women's suffrage and their leadership in the prohibition and
abolition movements.

O thou duughfer of the Kit~g&oml

T h y Zetter was considered. On account or the
lack of tirne, a brief aaswer fa glven.

The Spiritual Assernbfies whfch are organized
for the sake of teacbfng the Trutfi, whether as-

gembILes for men, assemblfes for women or mixed
assembiies, are al1 accepted and are conducive to
-thespreading of the Fragrances of Qod. Thfs is
esaentlal. Likewise the public meeting in which,
one day during the week, the believers gather, t o
ùe engaged in the cornmernoration ot God, to read
communes and deliver effective speeches, is ac-
ceptable and belored: But now it is utterly im-
possible t o establish the Kouse of 3ustice. which
is mentioned in the Book of Akdas; nay, rather,
jt is impracticable and not to be thought of. That
is for t h e time when the Cause is proclaimeci and
the Comnands of God have become' effective-

Therefore, now is not the time for the House of
Justice, which ntust be established by general elec-
tion. Its mention is not permissibie and its retil-
ization impossible.

Endeavor ye as much as possible that differences
rnay not arise In the affairs; let not every in-
sfgnificant xnatter become the cause of dfsagree-
ment. If such a conclition exists. the end wfll b e
complete dispereion.

The believers and the maid-servants of the Mer-
ciPu1 must ail consider how to produce harmonj,
so that t h e unity of the human world rnay ùe real-
ized; not that every whoIly unimportant subject
becorne cond~icireto differences of opinion. It 1s
m y hope that the friends and maid-servants of
America become united on al1 subjects and not
disagree at ail, for disagreement destroys the foun-
datfon of the Cause of God. If they agree u p o ~a
subjeci, even thotrgh ft be wrong, it i~ better than
to disagree and be in the right. F o r this ditfer-
ence wil'i prodiice dernolition of the Divine foun-
dation, Though one of the parties may be in the
right and they disagree, that wiU be the came of a
thousand wrongs; but if they agree and both
parties are in the %-rang, as it is unity, the truth
wilf be revealed and the wrong made right.

Some Questions to Fonder
(ponder v. think over. consider: muse, be deep in thought.)

How do you think the women in the picture with Susan Moody feIt about their
situation?

The tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha was written to Louise Waite of Chicago in answer to a
question. What rnight her question have been?

Why d o you suppose 'Abdu'l-Bahd answered her the way he did? What does this
suggest about our approach to equality issues in our communities?

The extract from a tablet by 'Abdu'l-BahB cited in vol. 1 #9 rnakes several asserrions
about the role of women in the Baha'i community.
This tablet was initially sent to a believer in Persia. What impact do you think it might
have had?

What does the editor's comrnents about the extract suggest about the condition of the
comrnunity in the West?

The Unity Band was a group of Western Baha'i women who wrote monthly letters to
wornen's assemblies in Persia. (A male believer in Persia received and distributed the
letters.) In 19 11 the Unity Band sponsored a graduate of Susan Moody's girls' school
to come to America to pursue higher education. in order to return to Persia and work
as a teacher.
The attached account of her arriva1 States the hope that "...from now on rnany orhers
with come every year to ... be imbued with the principles of social freedom and equality
and c a r y back the sarne to their own sisters."
The article describes in detail the oppression of women in the East. but makes no
mention of the oppression of women in America. Why?

Question: What is the status of woman in the Orient?

Answer: The status of woman in former times was exceedingly deplorable. for it was the

belief of the Orient that it was best for woman to be ignorant. It was considered
preferable that she should not know reading or wnting in order that she might not be
informed of events in the world. Woman was considered to be created for rearing

children and attendmg to the duties of the household. If she pursued educationd
courses. it was deemed contrary to chastity: hence women were made prisoners of the

household. The houses did not even have windows opening upon the outside world.

> Bahd'u'llah destroyed these ideas and proclaimed the equality of man and woman. He
made woman respected by commanding that all women be educated, that there be no
difference in the education of the two sexes and that man and woman share the sarne
rights. In the estimation of God there is no distinction of sex. One whose thought is

pure, whose education is supenor. whose scientific attainments are greater. whose
deeds of philanthropy excel. be that one man or woman. white or colored. is entitied to
full rights and recognition: there is no differentiation whatsoever. Therefore. the status

of women in the East has undergone change. At present they attend schools and
colleges, pursue the ordinary cumculum and day by day are becoming indispensable

to men and equal to them. This is the present condition of womankind in Persia.

presence, so long as His Name, and His Remembrance. and His Kingdom. and His

In this Revelation of Baha'u'llah, the women go neck and neck with the m e n In no
movenent will they be left behind. Their rights with men are equal in degree. They will
enter al1 the administrative branches of politics. They will attain in ail such a degree as

will be considered the very highest station of the world of humanity
and will take part in all affairs. Rest ye assured. Do ye not look upon the present
conditions: in the not far distant future the world of women will become dl-refulgent
and d-glorious. For His Holiness Bahd'u'lldh Hath Willed It so! At the time of elections
the right to vote is the indienable right of women. and the envance of women into al1
human departments is an irrefutable and incontrovertible question.

No sou1 c m retard or prevent it.

and they cannot endure the sight of the horror of carnage. even if it is for the sake of

defence. From such and similar undertakings the women are exempt.

indisputable. When the women attain to the ultimate degree of progress. then.

obtain extraordinary privileges. Be ye confident on these accounts. His Hoiiness
Bahd'u'llah has greatly strengthened the cause of women, and the rights and privileges

of women is one of the greatest principles of 'Abdul-Baha. Rest ye assured! Ere long
the days shail corne when the men addressing the women. shall say: 'Blessed are ye!

The Story of Sakinih Sultan

In the house of 'Abdullah Pasha, there is a large room on the second floor. This
room has carpets on the floor, and couches around the walls. and enormous arched
windows all down one side, letting in the bright mediterranean sun and the ocean
breeze. In this room. early every morning. 'Abdu'l-Baha and his household
gathered to share dawn prayers. 'Abdu'l-Bah& sat o n the right hand corner of a
couch beside the window, with his family around him. and the families of martyrs
whom he'd taken under his care spread out around the room. Here, for an hour
each day. they would listen tu the children chant. while 'Abdu'l-Baha supplied
forgotten words: and they would play with the parrot Bahiyyih Khanum had
taught to Say, 'Shoghi Jun": and they would drink their morning tea.

The tea came from a tall. shining samovar. standing by the door on a Persian tea-
cloth. A happy-faced woman with deep dimples in her cheeks and thick black
braids sac on the floor behind the samovar. Every morning, there she sat and
served the tea, from time to time throwing a lump of sugar to the sparrows which
flew in and out of the open windows. And the pilgrims came and went. and the
fortunes of the faith swung from peril to peril. from victory to betrayal. and the
rnembers of 'Abdu'l-Baha's own farnily rose up against him and fought. and all the
while. every morning. çakinih SultAn served the tea.

She was the eldest daughter of nine children born to a respected Baha'i family of
Yazd. As a child. she probably ran and played quite freely: but from about the age
of nine, she would have been confined to the home and involved in domestic work.
At the age of 13. her mother arranged her rnarriage to a Baha'i silk-weaver. Ali-
Asghar. aged 23. At the time, marriage at such an age was seen as normal: she
moved into her husband's home, and came under the authot-ity of her husband and
his mother. She probably knew very little about s a . and nothing about birth
control; but she must have learned quickly, because within the year, she was the
mother of a little girl named Faitimih.

And so her life went: nursing. sewing. cooking. cleaning. working with the women
of the household. and listening at curtains when the men spoke of the outside
world, a world she saw only through lattices and veils. Perhaps she was content.

Perhaps her men-folk permitted her a certain power of influence in their decisions
about her life: perhaps she never missed wdking outside unattended. riding a
horse. looking a stranger in the eyes, laughing out loud in the street. going
swimming, or reading and writing.

We'lI never know. But we know she loved her husband. in her own way. And we
know that he went out one spring day when she was fifieen to meet 6 other Bahais.
And we know that the next-door neighbors told the police about this meeting. and
that rhey were raided. and arrested. and-that they refused to recant rheir faith. The
seven men had their bellies split open. their organs pulled out. bits of their bodies
cut off for trophies, and their heads put on spikes carried through town by a mob.
And we know that Sakinih Sultan was sitting with her mother-in-law in a room on
the ground floor when suddenly they heard the music and shouting of the mob
outside their door, and that the next thing she knew her husband's head had been
tossed through the window and rolled at their feet.

We are told that then Sakinih fainted. But her mother-in-law picked up her son*s
head off the floor. took it to the washstand and cleaned it. and gave it back to the
mob, saying. that which we have given to God we do not ask back.
The other believers in Yazd were scared for their own skins and hid. so they were
abandonned with no food and no water, and the mob howling outside, until some
Dutch merchants took pity on thern and sent in provisions.

So Sakinih was a widow, and al1 her male kin were dead or dispersed. We. who may
speak to strangers, and go out unescorted, and act on our own behdf in the public
sphere. c m we imagine what it \vas like for Sakinih without a man to represent her?
She was an embarrasment. an aberration. something suspect and pathetic. Her
family urged her to remarry. but she did not wish it. She had a message sent to
'Abdul-Bah& asking for his help. pleading. And he said, come. But how? BWomen
could not travel alone: nor could they travel with men who were not kin. so it was
two years before she could find an appropriate escort. two years before she and her
four year old daughter Fatimih made the long trip West to Akka. At first. she lived
with Munirih Khanum's sister, Gawhar, who was mamed to one of her uncles. but
soon she was asked by 'Abdu'l-Baha to come and live in his household.

So Sakinih became one of 'Abdul-Baha's tmsted servants. Her daughter. Fatirnih,
grew up in the Holy farnily and ir is said that she was the first girl among them to
go to school. learning reading and writing from the Nazarene Sisters in Haifa and

studying calligraphy with the eminent Mishkin-Qalam. Fatimih was clever and
gifted in hand-work and embroidery, and made 'Abdu'l-Baha several coats.
including one that was his favorite. One day, when Fatimih was in her late teens.
Gawhar came to Sakinih to arrange the mamage of Fatimih to her son Badi Effendi.
'Abdu'l-Baba approved the match: and Sakinih saw her daughter go off to Cairo to
start her married life.

Joy and pain embrace. Nine months later. Fatimih bore a son: but she took fever
after the delivery and ten days later she was dead. But Sakinih was in Lebanon.
looking after Mina Abu'l-Fadl and Shoghi Effendi in his first years at University.
so she missed both the labouring and the funeral of her only child. Ml that was left
was her newborn grandson. By custom. she had no daim to him: the children went
with their fathers. But customs had a way of yeilding to kindness and good sense
in the house of 'Abdu'l-Baha. so Sakinih was given the baby. And she raised him
in the home of the Holy family. while her black braids turned grey. and the
samovar bubbled. and the tea was served. In 1945, she died- The grandson she
raised, Labib Shahawas a faithful Baha'i all his life, and is the one who has Ieft us
her story.

AFTER   L          ~   I N T H E~ - B R I T A N N~I C A , we come
~   to Women,

~       ~   '

Diseases of'. -

This is the first reference to 'Wornen'. The idea of women
being chronic invalids seems to the Encyclopedia the most perti-
nent fact about them.

Man, of course, fares very differently. He is not pluralized, but
occurs proudly in the singular. His first heading is : 'Man, Evolu-
tion of '. He stands for a11 hunianity, and he isn't even sick.

The Britannica was written primarily by men. W e live in a
man's world ;that is the matter with it.

Pio religion prior to the Bahh'i Faith taught sex equality. The
OId Testament says to woman, of her husband 'and he shall rule
over theeT.L Ender Mosaic law, it is true that mothers are to be
honoured along &th fathers, and daughters may inherit - in the
absence of sons. But women are of less account than men. They
rnay not e w n serve as witnesses in civil or criminal cases. They
pray to givr birth, not to daughters, b u t to sons.

Marriage according t o the Old 'fistarnent is polygamous. There
is no legal

-   lirnit in Mosaic Iaw to the number cf wives and ccncu-
bines a man may have. If a man wishes a divorce, he carries out the
provisions in Deuteronomy zq:x, as follows: 'When a man hath
taken a wife, and rnarried her, and it come to pass that she find no
favour in his q e s , because he hath found some uncIeanness in her;
then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand,
and send her out of his house.'

Even after the express prohibition of polygarny by Rabbi
Gershom B. Judah, 'The Light of the Exile' (960-1028A.D.), many
of the Jcwish peoples continued to practise it; the Jews of Spain,
for example, were polygamous as late as the 14thcentury A.D.
The Jewish Encyclopedia, under polygamy, states:

> In spite of the prohibition agairrst pobgamy     and of the general
> acceptame thereof, the Jnoish laoo   siiZZ retains m y provikions
> which apply only t o a statc wltich perrnits polygamy. The marnage
> of a married man is Zegally valid and needr the fornzality of a bill
> of dic.orce for ils dissolution, chil le the nzurriage of a mawied
wuman i s zwid . . .

There is no justification for reading sex equality back into the
New Testament. It is not there.

Jesus healed women along with men; He praised a wornan's
faith and hm jove, fie condemned the scribes 'which devour
widows' houses'; He conversed with a woman in the same tones He
used to men; He gave such women as do the will of the Father the
rank of His mother and sister; He reiterated the Old Testament
commandment to honour father and mother; He forgave the
woman taken in adultery; and He softened the curse of the Old
Testament: 'in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children' with : 'as
soon as she is delivered of the &Id, she rcmernbçrcth no more thc
anguish, forjoy that a man is born into the world'.z

He protected women from the lust of nien; and H e saved them
from being cast aside in divorce, except for adultery: 'And 1 Say
irnto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for
fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and
whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.'
Again: 'And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be
married to another she committeth adultery?

But nowherç in the Xew Testament do ae find any slightest
indication as to the sexes being equal. On the contrary, the New
Testament declares woman the inferior: '[man] is the image and
g l u s of the man. For the man is not of the woman; but the wornan
of the man.'' '1 suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp autliority
over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then
Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived
was in t h e transgression.'5 'Let your women keep silence in the

churches: for it is not permitted unto thern to speak      . . . And if
they wiI1 learn anything, let thern ask their husbands a t h o m e 3
V i v e s , submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore
as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own
husbands in everything?

Christian practice down to our times has been based on the
belief that woman (Eve) is the destroyer of God's image, man; that
she is the devil's gateway and a painted hell - see the Church
fathers for-theseand other metaphors; that she is mentally and
physically deficient; that m a r r i a p is evil, although preferable to
licence; that chiIdren are born in sin. Chivalry and the worship of
Mary, both imports from the East, had Iittle appreciable effect on
the status of the average Christian u70rnan.

Anyone who believes that Christianity teaches sex equality has
only t o study the history of the Woman Suffrage movement. The
dates alone tell the story. An early, revered landrnark in the evolu-
tion of women's rights is Mary LVollstonecraft's A Vindication of
the RRights of Wmna, inspired by France's 'Liberty, Equality, and
Fraternity' and brought out in 1792.On July 19, 1848, the first
Women's Rights Convention met a t Seneca Falls, New York, a t the
home of Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton. However, the famous
gathering a t Badaçht, Q u r i s i n , Persia - which posterity will
recognize as an irrevocable break with the past, and in the course
of which woman's equality with man was unforgettably pro-
claimed - antedated this by a few days, or weeks.8 It was at
Bada& that the great Tahirih (Qurratu'l-'Ayn) appcared without
her veil, and with solemn triumph, in the heart of a Muslim nation,
addressed the stupefied gathering, crying out: 'This day is . . .
the day on which the fetters of the past are burst asundedg

Freedom for wornen was so dear to n h i r i h that she died for it.

She was 'the first woman sufirage martyr'. In August, r852, she
gave up her life, executed for lier life's work. In her last moments
she said, T o u can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop
the emancipation of women .''O

In 1867,in the case of Chorlton v. Ling, it was sought to estab-
Iish that women were persons and as such entitied to the Parlia-
mentary vote. The Married Women's Property Acts were passed in

Great Britain in 1882 and 1893; prior to this the wife's legal
existence was rnerged with her husband's: 'My wife and I are one,
and f am he,' expressed it. (The reader should, however, refer to
Mary R. Beard's Woman as Force in History for a thorough study
of the field; as her title indicates, the author shows that women, far
from being at d l times a subject sex, have activrly shaped history.
This thesis iç familiar to Baha9is; see for example a discourse
delivered by 'Abdu '1-Bahh in I g r 2.)"

I n the United States, the 19th Amendment, enacted August
26, 1920,gave ,4rnerican women the right to vote. E t reads: 'The
right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied
or abridged by the United States or by any Statr on account of
sex. '

The New Testament does not teach monogamy nor condemn
polygamy. John ilt ton's brilliant Treotise on Christian Doctrine
establishes this. He States :

> In the definition which 1have given [of marriage], 1 have no1 said,
> in cornpliance with the cornmon opinion, of one man with one

Milton denies the b a i n sMl be one Aesh' verses, so ofien ad-
vanced as meaning monogamy (e.g. Matthew 19:5), any such
connotation; he says in part, 'the context refers tu the husband and

. .'

that wife onIy whom he was seekhg to divorce . H e advances
Exodus 2 r :IO as clearly showing the sanction of polygarny : 'if he
take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of
marriage shall he not diminish.' And lie adds: 'It cannot be sup-
posed that the divine forethought intended to provide for adultery.'
MiIton continues:

Muhammad was the first modern feminist. The Qur'h gives
women many and çpecific riglits. As learncd Muslims and Islamists
have not failed to point out, this Book grants spiritual equality to
believers of either scx :

Truly the men chu resign t b m e 1 e . e ~tu God (Mudims), and the

In the Qur'in, Adam is as guilty as Eve; Satan seduced them
both and in another passage Adam is the one deceived. In wornen
Gad hns placed 'abundant good'. Men arc bidden t o 'reverence the
wombs that 6ear you'J4

Wornen inherit and own property and act as witnesses; they
receive alimony and widows also receive a provision. Divorce is

- (oral tradition) it is lawful, but
discouraged; according to a hadith
abhorred by God; arbitration is enjoined to forestall divorce: 'And
if ye fear a breach between man and wife, then send a judge chosen
from his family, and a judge chosen h m her family: if thcy are
dcsirous of agreement, God wiil effect a reconciliation . .'The
love between man and wife is one of the signs of God: 'And one of
His signç it is, that He hath created wives [mates] for you of your
own species, that ye may dwell with them, and hath put love and
tenderness betweenyou.'15
Uromen are to be protected from 1ust;'G men are to iive 'chaste-
ly . . and without taking concubin es'.^ Monogamy is enjoined,
since the Text states: 'marry but two, or three, or four; and if ye

UTecaniiot forcsee where the BoIii17iprincipk of sex equality wiIl
Lead; it is new, and connotes vital charigcs in the social structure.

fast a uinlc-fmIe cliedc arid bülnrice systein is establislied.

Few perçons or institutions today practise the Baha'i teaching of
educating the daughter rather than the son if it is impossible to
provide education for both; during the war, for example, crowded
American schools were not unknown t o favour male candidates,
neglecting the female. 'Abdu'l-Bah5 says :

> The education ofwoman is more necessary and important t h a lhat
> of man, for w o m n rk the trainer of the child from its infnncy . . .
> The mothers are the p s t educators of mankind; $ they be im-
> perject, alusfor the condition andfuture of the race?

'Abdu'l-Bahl does not accept the argument of male superiority
based on t h e size of the brain:

> Some philosophers und writers have casidered woman naturally
> and by meaiion infmioor io man, claimitg os a proof that ihe bruin

The Mastcr a f i r n s that woman should not be considered in-

'Abdu'l-Bah& describes a striking difference between man's
psychology and woman's. He states that man is more inclined to
war than woman; that wornan, once she becomes fully effective in
society, will block war. Women, then, do not derive from warfare
the psychological satisfactions obtained from it by men, and their
repupance to war should be implemented tu keep the peace:

What 'Abdu'l-Bah& teachcs rcgarding the effect of constant
negative environmental suggestion on woman should be especial$
pondered. Everywhere woman is battered down by depressing
suggestion - that she is sick, rattle-brained, incompetent, that she
ages quicker than man, and su on. One sees here the same type of
poisonous social suggestion which attacks hlack American citi-
zens.28 This gifted people (whom North America will some day
recognize as one of her most valuable population elements) is con-
tinually being told in thousands of subtle ways - in books, linguistic
expressions, movies, the theatre, from lecture pIatforms - by the
majority that they have no future, must stay in their 'place', are

biologicaIly unfit, etc. The wholesame suggestion established by
black leaders - successful artists, writers, educators, sports cham-
pions and the rest - is extremeiy important. A fact is irrefutable; it
is there for people to see. In the same way one successful woman
gives the lie to al1 the old husbands' tales of woman's inferiority :

T k only remedy is educatim, opportunity; for equalify mems

Since work in future will be allottrd only on the bâsis of know-
ledge and skill, there is no need to particularize here; it is interest-
ing, however, that " ~ b d u ' l - ~ a h iespecially recornrnends the
'industrial and agri cultural sciences' for wornen.30

Polygamy inevitably connotes woman's inferiority. Monogamy
is Bahl'i iaw. The marriage contract is a partnership of two equals;
neither agrees to o b q the other, and neither beIongs to the other;
one individuaf cannot own another.

Women, under Bahi'i law, are accorded a few exemptions in
their religious observances. Furthemore, a few restrictions apply
to wornen: women inherit a lesser share than men, although this is
not mandatory if an individuai prefers to distribute his property
otheru;ise,sI and women do not serve in the Universal House of
Justice, aithough they serve on the Local and National Houses, and
the rnembers of the last-named elect the members of the Universal
body. Of this non-membership in the Universal House of Justice,
'Abdu'l-Bah6 said the reason 'will presendy appear, even as the
Sun at middayV.s2It does not affect woman's status of equality,
since the highest rank a BahB'i can attain, that of Hand of the
Cause, is open to women as well as men.

In the United States, the rise of women is in fact bound up with the
rise of the American Negro race, It was to emancipate the black that
early women leaders needed public pIatforms - and were opposed by
the churches, who suffered them not to teach. This parallel dcvelop-
ment is thought-provoking: one oppressed group orking to serve the
other; both, so far and to a certain extent, victorious.

Certain of the words addressed by 'Abdu'l-BahA to women are identi-
cal in sense with those He spoke to the black people: to the latter He

said: 'In the estimation of God there is no distinction of coïor; a21 are

> Some Questions to Ponder

How does Gail's account of the history of women's rights make you feel?

Gai1 suggests that 'eveqrwhere woman is battered down by depressing suggestion -
that she is sick. rattle-brained, incompetent. that she ages quicker than man. and so
onw and 'Abdu'l-Bahd States that '...the assumption of superiority by man wiil
continue to be depressing to the ambition of woman. as if her attainment to equality
was creationally impossible...". How have you been affected by 'depressing
suggestion" and men's assumption of supenority?

Do you think women have already achieved equality?.

Some Questions to Pondes

Susan Moody received 'the usual schooling and orthodox religious trainingw. What
enabled her to become so unusual and to do such unorthodox things?

Susan studied music. painting, sculpture. and medicine, at a time when most wornen
were unable to get more than the most basic education. What factors in Susan's life
made her studies possible?

Revell says that 'During her fifteen years of service to the Cause in Iran, many were
her diffcuities and hardships but she had an inflexible determination to accomplish
what 'Abdu'l-Baha wished her to do." What do you think some of her hardships and
difficulties might have been?

There was only one Susan Moody. What do you suppose happened to most Persian
women when they becarne ill?

Reveli says that Susan wrote many letters descnbing her work and the lack of freedom
women faced in Persia. Some of these letters were published in the Baha'i News in
Amenca. and many of them descnbe the difficulties Susan faced in trying to estabiish a
school for girls. However. Revell also says that Susan '...found that many of the Baha'i
men were in full sympathy with her views". If the Bahii'i men supported this idea, why
did it take Susan years of detemùned effort to establish a girls' school? Why did Susan
have to work so hard at fundraising for an additional building? Why did teachers have
to be sent from America? Why were there no Baha'i classes for girls. either. until
Susan started them and personally saw that they were maintained?
Given aLI of these facts, why d o you suppose Jessie Revell nonetheless writes that the
local Baha'i men were in 'full sympathy with her views"? Furtherrnore. why doesn't
ReveU mention how the local Baha'i wornen felt about Susan's work?

Revell attributes Susan's successes to her 'keen spintual perception. a pure and
undefiled conception of the Baha'i teachings, and a desire to render instant obedience".
and describes her as noble, self-sacrificing. humble, selfless. and with "an outstanding
sense of justice."
Given the work that Susan accomplished, what other qualities d o you think she must
have had?
Why has Jessie ReveU chosen to emphasize that Susan was noble. humble. selfless,
obedient. and spiritually perceptive?

What d o you suppose Susan's private life was like? Whar had she given up in order to
d o what she did?

Supplementary Readings - Workshop Two

Now in the two lower kingdorns of nature we have seen that there is no question of the

superiority of one sex over the other. In the world of humanity we find a great
difference: the fernale sex is treated as though inferior, and is not allowed equal rights

and priviieges. This condition is due not to nature. but to education. In the Divine
> Creation there is no such distinction. Neither sex is superior to the other in the sight
of God. Why then should one sex assert the inferioricy of the other, withholding just

rights and priviIeges as though God had given His authority for such a course of
action? If women received the same educôtional advantages as those of men, the r m l t

would demonstrate the equality of capacity of both for scholarship.

In some respects woman is superior to man. She is more tender-hearted. more

receptive, her intuition is more intense.

It is not to be denied that in various directions woman at present is more backward

than man. also that this t e m p o r q inferionty is due to the lack of educational
opportunity. In the necessity of life. wornan is more instinct with power than man. for

to her he owes his very existence.

> If the mother is educated then her children wiU be well taught. When the mother is
wise. then will the children be led into the path of wisdom. If the mother be religious
she wiIl show ber children how they should love God. If the mother is moral she

guides her litde ones into the ways of uprightness.

Ir is clear therefore that the future generation depends on the mothers of today. 1s not
this a vital responsibility for the woman? Does she not require every possible

advantage to equip her for such a task?

Therefore. surely. God is not pleased that so important an instniment as woman
should suffer from want of training in order to attain the perfections desirable and
necessary for her great life's work! Divine Justice demands that the rights of both sexes

should be equally respected since neither is superior co the other in the eyes of
Heaven. Dignity before God depends. not on sex. but on purity and luminosity of

heart. Human virtues belong equally to d l !

Paris TalIcs, 160.
God is the Creator of mankind.
He has endowed both sexes with perfections and intelligence. given them physical
members and organs of sense, without differentiation or distinction as to supenority;
therefore. why should woman be considered inferior? This is not according to the plan

and justice of God. He has created them equal: in His estirnate there is no question of
sex. The one whose heart is purest. whose deeds are most perfect. is acceptable to God.
male or female. Often in history women-have been the pride of humanity--for exmple,

Mary, the mother of Jesus. She was the glory of mankind. Mary Magdalene. k y i h .

> daughter of Pharaoh, Sarah. wife of Abraham. and innumerable others have gloriried
the human race by their excellences. In this day there are women among the Baha'is

who far outshine men. They are wise. talented. well-informed. progressive, most
inteiligent and the üght of men. They surpass men in courage. When they speak in
meetings. the men iisten with great respect. Furthermore, the education of women is of
greater importance than the education of men. for they are the mothers of the race. and

rnothers rear the children. The first teachers of children are the mothers. Therefore,
they must be capably trained in order to educaie both sons and daughters. There are

many provisions in the words of Baha'u'llah in regard ro this.

> He promulgated the adoption of the sarne course of education for man and woman.

Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum of study. thereby promoting
unity of the sexes. When dl mankind shall receive the same opportunity of education
and the equality of men and women be realized. the foundations of war will be utterly

desnoyed. Without equality this will be impossible because al1 differences and
distinction are conducive to discord and strife. Equality between men and women is
conducive to the abolition of warfare for the reason that women will never be willing to

sanction it. Mothen wiU not give their sons as sacrifices upon the battlefield after
twenty years of anxiety and loving devotion in rearing them from infancy. no matter
what cause they are called upon to defend. There is no doubt that when women obtain

equality of nghts, war will entirely cease among mankind.

Promulgation of Univend Peace. 175.
Today among the Baha'is of Persia there are rnany women who are the v ~ pride   y and
envy of the men. They are imbued with all the virtues and excellences of humanity.

They are eloquent: they are poets and scholars and embody the quintessence of
humiüty. In political ability and acumen they have been able to cope and compete with

> representative men. They have consecrated their lives and forfeited their possessions
in martyrdom for the sake of humanity, and the traces of their glory will last forever.
The pages of the history of Persia are illumu-ied by the lives

and records of these women.
The purpose, in bnef. is this: that if wornan be fully educated and granted her nghts.
she will attain the capacity for wonderful accomplishments and prove henelf the equd
of man. She is the coadjutor of man, his complement and helprneet. Both are human:

both are endowed with potentialities of intelligence and embody the W u e s of
humanity. In al1 human powers and functions they are partners and coequals. At
present in spheres of human activity woman does not manifest her natal prerogatives.
owing to lack of education and opportunity. Without doubt education will establish

her equality with men.

Promulgarion of Universa[ Peace. 136.

Therefore, strïve to show in the human world that women are most capable and
> efficient, that their hearts are more tender and susceptible than the hearts of men. that
they are more philanthropie and responsive ioward the needy and suffenng. that they

are inflexibly opposed to war and are lovers of peace. Strive that the ideal of
international peace rnay become realized through the efforts of womankind, for man is
more inclined to war than wornan. and a real evidence of woman's superiority will be

her service and efficiency in the establishment of universal peace.

Promulgaoon of Universal Peace. 284.

0 handmaid of God! ... To the rnothers rnust be given the divine Teachings and effective
counsel. and they must be encouraged and made eager to train their children, for the

mother is the first educator of the child. It is she who must. at the very beginning.
suckle the newborn at the breast of God's Faith and God's Law. that divine love may

enter into hirn even with his mother's milk, and be with hirn till his final
breath. So long as the mother faileth to train her chiidren. and start them on a proper

way of life, the training which they receive later on will not take its full effect.

Selections from the WnEings of 'Abdu?-Bah& I 38.
Equaiity between men and women does not, indeed physiologically it cannot. mean
identity of functions. In some things women excel men. For others men are berter fitted

than women, while in very many things the difference of sex is of no effect at all.

The Story of Tahirih

We know so little about the women in Our history. but thereTsone woman we
rernember. We name Our daughters afier her. we write small plays about her from time
to time, and that woman is Tahirih,
So what do we know about this farnous Tahirih?

Well. for a start, unlike most wornen of a e time. including the great Asiyfh Khanum.
we know when Tahirih was born. in 1817. We know this only because someone
thought to note down that Tahirih and Bahd'u'Uah were exactly the same age.

It's also pretty cornmon knowledge that she was born in Qazvin, a city of honey-
colored brick. bound by mnning water. in the gracious home of a very religious
family. who named her Fatimih Umm Salamih. but called her Zarrin-Taj. Crown of
Gold.

She was pretty and pleasant and clever. we're told, but these things are often said
about nice little girls. What's more interesting is that her family fostered her
cleverness instead of punishing her for it. She was allowed to eavesdrop on her
brothers' tessons. and before long her facher and uncle, who were both priests. were
letting her listen in as they taught Modem scripture to large classes of men. Even
when she started butting in and contradicting them from behind the curtain, instead of
kicking her out. they admitted their error and the tmth of her point.
Remember. this was at a time when women were considered only slightly bnghter than
donkeys. and many clergy seriously doubted that women even had souls.

So how did this happen for Tahirih? Perhaps, whatever their faults. her father and
uncle bore a greater allegiance to knowledge than they did to custom. Or perhaps the
women of the household recognized Tahirih's gifts and used their covert power to
persuade the men to make an exception for her. maybe just to get this strange child
out of their hair. or maybe because they really loved her. Or maybe Tahirih was just
so gifted that none of them could bear to waste such a frighteningly bnlliant mind.
One of her brothers has wntten 'We, all of us, her brothers. her cousins. did not dare
to speak in her presence, so rnuch did her knowledge intimidate us."
Imagine. this. from a Persian brother, who ought to come first in al1 things. and be
waited on by his sisters. How admiration and resentment must have coiled rogether in
their hearts.

But even the indomitable Tahirih did not always get her way. And ifs less well known.

but m e . that she was marrïed against her will to an older cousin. also a priest. when
she was 13 years old.
Think. for a moment. of someone you know. who is 13 years old.
When we come to this, her mamied Iife, hstory draws back in silence.
We know he opposed her views.
We know he gave her three sons.
And we know, after some years, she becarne a heretic.

You may have heard of this part; how she found some books by the controversial
Shayki thinker. Siyyid Kazim, hidden in a relative's library, and. much to everyone's
dismay. declared that she agreed with him. that the Promised One was indeed at hand.
Her family thought this was ridiculous.
When she told her uncle she wanted to be the first woman to serve the new Prophet
when He appeared. because Iran had sunk so low and women were educated so poorly.
her family thought this was preposterous.
But when she started corresponding with Siyyid Kazim. and he named her Qurraruïl-
Ayn, Solace of Mine Eyes. her family must have began to get frightened.

But even in this, history muscn't be telling the whole truth. because how does a
married woman send and receive letters from a stranger. a man. without an accomplice?
Sorne male close relative who either loved her so well or was so under her thumb that
he would do her bidding. no matter how outrageous. We know she was beautiful. and
frank to a fault, but she also must have been able to charm the angels out of heaven
when needs be. and must have had her allies. because there's no other explanation for
how she got her way so often, how they didn't just bear her to a pulp.
And how she got her husband and father. suspicious as they were. to let her go off
with her sister and brother-in-law to Karbila after 13 years of mariage. It's a
pilgrimage to the holy shnnes of the Imams. they're thinking. maybe it'll bring her
back to the true Islam. Did they know her s o little? Did they not know that Karbila
was the home of Siyyid Kazim. the hotbed of Shayki thinking? Maybe they thought,
there's no nsk, here is her home. and her three sons, and everything she knows.
abandoning al1 this would be unthinkable. even for her. even the indomitable Tahirih
would not go so far as this.
h t h i n k a b l e , indeed.
And yet again, they rnisjudged her.
And history has glossed over this tear in the fabric of custom. has not inquired or
speculated or discussed how or why she could d o such a thing.

But the facr is, she got to Karbila. and went straight to Siyyid Kazim's school. and
found that he was ten days dead.
She was 26 years old and already her poetry and scholarship was famous in Persia.
Her brother-in-iaw, the only man with her whose authority she had ro worry about.
became a Shayki.
Rernember, things were a mess. Siyyid Kazirn was dead, his students were arguing
about what to do, and a bunch of them decided they ought to go out and look for the
Promised One. Ker brother-in-law went with them.

History has found this unremarkable. In fact, most people know nothing about this
whole penod. and her role in getting rid of the only male relative with her that we
know about is unknown. %utthis apparentiy left her for the fint time in her life
essentially unsupervised.
She and her sister moved in to Siyyid Kazim's house. with his family, and she took
over the teaching of Siyyid Kazim's students.
Every day, she taught classes of men. from behind a curtain. Rernernber. this is Persia.
where a woman's name couid not be spoken by anyone other than close relatives.
Allowing hundreds of strangers to hear her voice. let alone instmcting them. was seen
as blatantly immoral. If ever a shred of evidence of irnpropriety could have been
found. Tahirih would certainly have been branded a whore and killed. But somehow
in this. as in so many things, she prevailed.

But what is even less well known than this. and less remarked upon. is thar at the same
time. Tahirih also gathered and taught classes of wornen. She and her sister, and
Maryam, the sister of Mulla Husayn. and Shams-i-Duha. whom you'll hear about next
week. and who knows how rnany other women, locals and pilgrims, whose narnes
history has not found worth mentioning. met and Tahirih taught them to read. and to
write, to and analyze scripture, and to question the texts, and to question their culture,
and their veils, and the power of their clergy.

And when, one night, Tahirih had a dream in which a young man stood in the sky
reading verses from a book. and Iater found those same verses in a commentary by the
Bab, when she then declared her faith in Him as the Promised One. and wrote to Him.
and was accepted by Him as one of the Letters of the Living. the first group to become
aware of Him, when this came to p a s , naturally. Tahirih and her sisters taught the
townswomen this too.

It was like spreading sparks in a dry field.
And the men of Karbila knew fear. and the clergymen were sweaty in their cloaks.

because it is the women who pass on the culture to the next generation. and they
could feel the grip of their power slipping. The ignorance of women was their greatest
weapon. and Tahirih was taking it from them.

On the anniversary of the death of the Imam Husayn. when all of Karbila - if not ali
Iraq and Persia - wept and wore black. Tahirih wore bright party clothes to celebrate
the arriva1 of the Promised One. This final flouting of convention was more than they
could bear. and Tahirih was put under house arrest for three months.

The history books do not note the irony of this punishrnent: how different is house
arrest from a life in which you cannot leave your home without the permission of your
father or husband, and without a close male relative as your escort? In this the rural
women and the poor had greater liberty - their labour was needed outside or in the
fields. But city women - like Tahirih - this was how they iived their üves. Nor did she
suffer isolation: we're told that it was while under house arrest that skie learned of the
planned gathering of Babis at Badasht. so news and messages still reached her.

Afrer three months Tahirih negotiated a release. How. w e d o not know. Soon after. she
and her companions - a group of clever, unconventional. astonishing women. women
who were never silent in their lives but whom history has given no tongue - she and
who knows how many of them left Karbila. How many townswomen grieved behind
their veds that day, while the pnests led a mob to peIt Tahirih's howdah with rocks?

She had not seen her sons for three years, but she did not go home. Instead. she
began working her way toward Badasht. seeking permission from local officials to
travel. to enter a city. to leave. Her movement still depended on her ability to bend
men to her will. This was not freedom: you are not free when your liberty depends on
your skill at winning the indulgence of men.

At first. she got as far as Baghdad. where she had to wait for permission to leave the
country. In the meantirne. of course. she got busy. We're told that the leaders of the
Shi'ih and Sunni Moslems. and the leaders of the churches and synagogues in Baghdad
all came to argue with her. and d l came away impressed and silenced. By a woman!
Her former students in Karbila heard that she was teaching in Baghdad and many came
to hear her, and many became devoted foilowers of the Bab. And al1 the while, she and
her fnends were gathering women. and teaching them literacy and scripture. teaching
them to learn and to think for themselves.

Of course. it couldn't last, and soon enough she was under house arrest again. in the
home of the Judge of Baghdad. This judge has said of her. "1see in her such
knowledge. education, politeness, and good character as I have not seen in any great
men in this century." Who knows if he, or any of the men who were forced to
recognize Tahinh's abilities. then saw their own femde kin any differently.

Before long. we're told, Tahirih was off. with thirty people seeking to go with her. In
the first village she stopped at. 1200 people volunteered to d o her bidding. In
Kirmanshah, the Governor himself became a Babi. and the mayor and opposing priests
took fright and had her party dumped in the desert at nîght wiîh nothing but their
veils and the clothes on their backs.

But you may know all this already. History rushes on. recounting such acts. skipping
toward Badasht. while her greatest gift goes unnoticed. unrnentioned. because it
happened between womnn. It could be the best thing she ever did. Such a small.
simple thing. But a few years later, in the cold of winter. a small family wouId be
coming to Baghdad. hungry, frost-bitten. poor. with two srnall children. two brothers,
one of them weak from long imprisonment. and one woman. enormously pregnant. and
so weak and sickly that her husband was doing the cooking and her brother-in-law
doing what cleaning and shopping he could. This family would move into tiny. squalid
rooms in Baghdad. destitute and ffiendless. But within a few hours. the doors would
open on women. veiied. smiling, bringing provisions. welcoming them. touching the
swollen belly, clucking and rustling and doing what women do. They were friends
Tahirih had made in Baghdad. Arabs, who came now and befriended the farnily of
Baha'u'Uah in their time greatest need.

But the story marches on. In Hamadan a messenger came from her father. asking her
to corne home.
Asking? Telling? Begging? Al1 we are told is that she dispersed her followers and
went. though unwilling. back to Qazvin.

How the women received her we cannot Say. No one has written whether her mother
and sisters and sisters in law and aunties wept and kissed her in a fiurry of skirts and
black braids and stories to fi in the years. the showing off of new babies. the
recounting of injuries. deaths. births, and mariages. good fortune and bad. or if they
received her coldly, drawing back from this woman-once-known. now stranger. strange
in word and deed. her every direct look and firm step. the boidness of her camage

marking her as other. her difierence hanging between them like a reproach.

And if they feared and wondered at her. whispering. watching her over their
embroidery, and falling siient as she passed by, vras she hem-broken and lonely for
her soul-sisters. for their grit and iaughter and intelligence and love? For that handful
of Babi woman-fnends whose presence bore witness that she was not crazy?
Perhaps she was stronger. maybe she was one of those torches that burns hot and
ruthless, burning away al1 need for human love and understanding, in the blaze of
their single-minded devotion, in the white-hot purity and peace of the2 sacrifice.
Or maybe she came home and wept in her mother's lap, her back heaving as she
sobbed out the fear and frustration of being everywoman's hero, the weight of so many
futures pressed on her small, plump shoulders.

History decided that this was insignificant. But it tells us how the men received her:
that they gathered in a study, and her father, uncle, and husband argued with her,
pushed her to recant her faith.
Her father must have loved her still. He said. 'If you. with ali the learning and
intelligence you have, were to clairn to be the Bab or even more than that. 1would
immediately agree with you and believe in you - but what can I do when you choose to
follow this young man from Shiraz?" The agony in his heart. his twisting hands. his
po werlessness,
She replied. W i t h the knowledge which I have it is impossible that 1 could be
mistaken in recognizing Him Who is the Lord of the Worlds. Him Whom all people are
waiting for. 1have recognized him by the proofs of reason and the facts of knowledge.
But this knowledge of mine is only a drop, cornpared with the great ocean of knowledge
which is the Bab's." Knowledge 1 taught you. he is thinking. facts which you learned
at my knee. O my daughter. He is asking himself, did 1 do wrong?

Her husband. who was now the mujtahid, tried to asserc his clairn over her. to snare
her in the coi1 of his nght by marriage to rule her person, to force her back into his
home,
She was not cornpliant. 'Say to my presumptuous and arrogant kinsrnan." she said.
'to my proud and false-hearted husband. 'If your desire had really been to be a faichful
mate and cornpanion to me. you would have hastened to rneet me in Karbila and wouId
on foot have guided my howdah all the way to Qazvin. If you had done that. 1 would
have aroused you from your sleep of heedlessness and would have shown you the way
of truth. But this was not to be. We have been apart for three years. Neither in this
world nor the next c m 1ever be associated with you. 1 have cast you out of my life
forever."

And so she dumped the mujtahid.

He fought it, of course. and tned to defame her. but somehow she prevailed. His fury
cooled, perhaps. or she simpIy wore hirn down. but eventually he gave up and
divorced her.
Do you think then that he allowed her even to see her three sons?

The third man there to challenge her was an uncle, and his approach was simple. He
beat her. He cursed the Bab. and beat her, and she said to h m . ' O Uncle!" speaking
very calmly, she said '1 see your mouth filling with blood."
And then history says no more.
A thin trickle of her blood drips on the tile in the ringing silence of history. where
writers turn away. ashamed, from the battered wornan.

Tahirih's uncle becarne driven to squash the Babis, and her defiance inflamed his
resolve. Perhaps you have heard this. Finally, a fellow mulla. outraged by the man's
torture of innocents. caught hirn alone at his prayers in the rnosque. and buned a
dagger in his mouth, killing him.

The mulla confessed. but her uncle's heirs had a taste for blood. and every Babi they
could find in Qazvin was jailed, then attacked by a mob. Their bodies were hacked into
bits, and nothing was left to be buried.
But the blood that they thirsted for the most was Tahirih's. She had predicted this
corning, they reasoned, and so she must bê behind it.

She was confined to her father's house while her fate hung in the balance.
And then. we are told. Tahirih took a stand. 'If my cause be the cause of Truth." she
wrote to her husband, 'and the Lord whom I worship be none other than the One
Tnie God. He will deliver me from this house before nine days have passed. If God
does not deliver me from here, you are free to do what you wish with me."
And then she prayed. Perhaps she was crazy. to Say such a thing.
Perhaps he sneered, and gloated. her husband. at the chance to kill this woman who
had shamed hirn and to prove the falseness of her God in one fell swoop. or perhaps his
heart shook as he picked up the gauntiet she'd cast.
If it did, he needn't have worried on her behalf.

History notes she was rescued, by the efforts of Bahd'u'llah. And while that is true.
there is more to the story than this. and probably more yet that will never be known.

To some things, mer. were blind. Those standing guard saw no threat in the stooped.

veiled form. begging at the door for bread: it was, after dl. just a wornan. one black
scurrying form among many, unworthy of notice. And once in the hail. no longer
stooped, she was just one more veiled servant. She kept her hands steady. her step
calm. When she sofdy opened the cellar door. no one stopped her. and when two black
shrouded forms slipped into the street some time later, in no hurry. heads together. no
man of honor would think of approaching them, forcing them to speak their names or
show their faces in public. They would have laughed if it were not so dangerous. Who
was to know it was Tahirih that walked by. and Khatun-Jan. her sister-in-law. a fellow
Babi, who delivered her?
Who was to know. but the other women. Surely. as they crossed the courtyard.
among the playing children. and passed the others. drawing water. spinning.
chopping lamb. or mending, sitting on cushions drinking tea. surely there was a
shiver of silence, a whispering of curses or blessings at their backs. But none of them
barred the way, none whispered a word to the guard. Their silence changed the course
of history, and so we see that even in Persia in such times women have always held
some unwriuen power. We are not and never have become sheep. even when forced
to appear so.

Khatun Jan guided her friend safely through the city to a carpenter's house by the
walls, where her husband waited. At nightfall they went over the wall. Tahirih hefting
her considerable weight, and then to a slaughterhouse, where horses waited, and the
beating adrenalin of an all-night gallop to Tehran.

History does not pause here, in its rush to the reckoning at Badasht. but consider
what it might have been for them, that nighr: to straddle a horse, the wind whipping
at their clothing. the stars and the pounding of hoofs and the dust and the exultation -
had they ever been so close to the feeling of freedom? Had they ever even beer? on a
horse? And then in the gates of Tehran at dawn. the heart-pounding moment as they
slid under the glance of the guard. down the street into Baha'u'llah's home, Asiyih
there to receive them. the laughter and nursing of saddle sores and then the deep.
sweet sleep.

This is worth remembering. in my view. That night deserves its place in the history
books. And Khatun-Jan. who made it happen: she flares up at the edge of sight and
disappears, sinks back into that underground river of women who pushed history
forward, whose stories and names died with them.

And so on it goes. We see Tahirih. with the young 'Abdu'l-Baha in her lap. Perhaps
you know the rest of the story. That she knew the station of Baha'u'llzih then, when it
was years before that veil would be lifted. That her quiet act of appearing unveiled at
Badasht. her announcement. 'this is the day on which the fetters of the past are burst
asunder - 1am the Word which the Promised One is to speak. the Word which shall
put to flight the chiefs and nobles of the earth!". that this act was the pivot that swung
the Babis into the next dispensation.

You must know she was imprisoned again in the mayor's house, but they could not
keep the women from coming to her, that even in the rnidsr of a wedding party they
would cluster around her like moths to a flame. and they would Iearn. The Shah
himself told her that he'd marry her and make her the guardian of all of his women. if
only she'd becorne a good Modem.
She refused, of course, politely. When he found out rhey'd killed her behind bis back.
the history books Say that he wept.

And kill her they did. of course. First they argued. one priest after another. until
fmally she told them, "Your reasoning is like that of an ignorant and stupid child. How
long will you keep repeating these stupidities and lies?"

And then she prepared for death. She had always loved make-up. and pretty dresses.
and perfume, and candies. sweet and beautiful things. She was 36 years old and she
dressed for her death like a bride. carefully. in white siik.

She prayed alone through her last hours. and did not weep. and wenr to her death
quite calmly. we're told. When the guard came at night to take her. she kissed the
women of the mayor's house goodbye. her fiiends and would-be jailers for the past
three years. They sent dong a sun to make sure she was not raped. and he stood by
and watched the dninken soldiers bicker. watched her hand the man a silk scarf. saying
'you can kill me if you like. but you cannot stop the emancipation of women, ' watched
him strangle her with it. her limbs jerking. and quieting. watched the man kick her
body in the side and chest, his boot-prints ugly on the white dress. And then he
stepped fonvard, and saw that she was lowered into a half-dug well. and buried. The
image of her white hand, upturned on the earth, of a pale cmmple in the well. seared
into his memory.

This is the story we're told, of a woman who died by the words of her own mouth.

> 'Magic Marna"
from Mv Motheis Bodv. by Marge Piercy

8 Alfred A. Knopf. 1988

The wornan who shines with a duiI comfortable glow.
The woman who sweats honey, an aphid
enrolled to sweeten the lives of others.

The woman who puts down her work like knitting
the moment you speak. but somehow gets it done
secretly in the night while everyone sleeps.

The wornan whose lap is as wide as the Nile
delta, whose flesh is a lullaby
of goosedown petds Iaclcing the bite

of menace real lullabies ride on
(if the bough breaks. birds
and butterflies pecking out his eyes).

Whose own eyes are soft-focus mirrors.
Whose arrns are boIsters. Whose love
is laid on like the municipal water.

She is not the mother goddess. vortex
of dark and iight powers with her consorts.
her hungers. her favorites, her ternper

blasing the corn so it withers in the ear.
her bloody humor that sends the hunter fleeing
to be tracked and torn by his hounds,

the great door into the earth's darkness
where bones are rewoven into wheat.
who loves the hawk as she loves the rabbit.

Big marna has no power, not even over herself.

The taxpayer of guilt. whatever she gives
you both agree is never enough.

She is a one-way street down which pour
parades of opulent gifts and admiration
from a three-shift factory of love.

Magic marna has to make it right. straighten
the crooked, ease pain, raise the darkness,
feed the hungry and matchmake for the lonesome

and ask nothing in retum. If you win
you no longer know her, and if you lose
it is because her goodness failed you.

Whenever you creare big marna from another
woman's smile. a generosity of spirit working
like yeast in the inert matter of the day.

you are stealing from a woman her own ripe
grape sweet desire, the must of her fears,
the shadow she casts into her own future

and turning her into a diaper service,
the cleaning lady of p u r adventure.
Who thanks a light bulb for giving light?

Listen. your mother is not your mother.
She is herself and unmothered. It is tirne
to take the apron off your mind.
Excerpts from As-                 pp. 86-103

by Bahiyyih Nakhjavdni

'When Tahirih enters the room fded with eighty men. many of whom are
scholan and trained priests. and when they see she is unveiled. they have to face their
own lust. their own cupidity, their own narrow-mindedness and greed. That is why
some of them leave and never return. That is presumably why one of them slits his
throat with horror. ..."

'Veils, according to Bahii terminology, are those delusions that we carry
around based on false assumptions or misconceptions of reality. Mhen choices or
decïsions are perceived through such a delusive medium the outcome is generaily dirn.
Neither we nor anyone else benefits and frequently great harrn is done. What is
alarrning about this process is that we very often assume the veil without questioning
its vaiidity. You might almost imagine that there was something in us inclined towards
veils, but maybe that thought too is an illusion. It is like believing that a certain state
is 'natural' or 'normal' just because we have never seen an alternative to it. The most
disturbing consequence of veils is that we think by their means we are avoiding
choices when in fact we are giving ourselves false ones. ..."

'To accept [veils] is to become a prisoner of fdse premises: to impose them on
others reveals how much a prisoner one is oneself. Not surprisingly, one's own veils
c m be rent only by oneself: they are self-delusions and require self-knowledge if they
are to be removed. However well-meaning Our fnends. however supportive the
community around us, however enlightened the sociev or utopian the world. we
remain swathed so long as Our individual will is not engaged.

There is in the symbol of the veil another less abstract fear. a cultural
connotation which also leaves its traces in a Baha'i context. The veil in IsIarnic
countries has traditionally been associated with femaie exclusion. It is a wornan's
thing. Not only does it separate her from the power centers of society. bound to a
narrow and domestic world but it also symbolizes her vulnerability to men outside her
world. Her veil provides her with the appearance of unassailable virtue and protects
her from lascivious and greedy eyes. The reason she wears it is because she believes
the eyes must be greedy, men must be lascivious and her virtue will be assailed. The
veil. therefore, summarizes all that women feel and fear in a male-dorninated society.

Finally, there is a third aspect to the word, in the present context which
concerns the idea of oppression. Veils have this connotation m t only because of their
association with women but also because of the mental and psychological oppression

they symbolize for anyone. The veil is the fear that separates us from the light. that
chokes the Iight itself, that cloaks the mind's eye in chosen doubt instead of darkened
certainty. We are both unknown to ourselves and unknowing when we are veiled.
Ignorance encourages fear, even when freely chosen. ...'

'Tahirih was the daughter of a mulla. and due to her extraordinary intelIectual
abitities, had eamed herself the education of a priest: but she was a woman. and it is
this conjunction between women and fear touched upon earlier that we must finally
explore. The fact of Tahinh's femininity could never have been far from people's
thoughts at Badasht. It would have been difficult for men of such a time and place,
with their background and education, trained as so many were to become priests. to
have totally ignored her sex in revering her knowledge. Many indeed chose not to
revere her knowledge because of her sex. Even if a number of them succeeded in
abstracting her totally into a myth - 'the very incarnation of Fatimih' - her face was a
sufficient symbol, within the Islamic tradition. of her sexuality. Small wonder then
that some of those present 's'enveloppèrent la tête de leur vêtement pour ne point voir
le visage de son Altesse la Pure.' [hid their heads in their clothes so as not to see the
face of the Pure One]

No doubt. cherefore, a large percentage of that audience. unaware of the
immense spiritual significance of the One in Whose presence they were sitting.
uncertain even in retrospect perhaps that the episode might have been 'a God-sent
test designed to separate the true from the false and distinguish the faithful from the
disloyal', saw the confrontation between Quddus and Tahirih primanly on sexual
grounds. Should Quddus refuse to submit to the request of a woman because she was
his inferior? Could a woman possessed of such immense spiritual powers be a man's
superior? For some present. Quddus would have been perfectly justified in the
rudeness of his reply. the arrogance of his refusal. simply because of his sexual
superiority. Even the implicit violence written across his face at Tahirih's cataclysmic
entrance - 'holding the unsheathed sword in his hand, his lace betraying a feeling of
inexpressible anger...as if he were waiting for the moment when he could strike his fatal
blow at Tahirih' - seems to reverberate with this implied sexual outrage. a violence that
in p~ychologicalterms is rooted in the threat of castration. the impulse to punish by
rape.

We cannot underestimate the sexual impact of this confrontation or ignore the
flood of intense and pent-up sevual emotions that surge within this episode. We
should not too hastily push its significance into dimly understood abstractions or
adopr Shoghi EffendiPsterrninology without recognizing its roots. None of the issues
he raises - the 'departure from the time-honored traditions'. the 'revolution

in ...outlook, habits. ceremonials and manner of worship' - c m be fully grasped if we try
to dilute the basic challenge posed by the pnnciple of sexud equality in this context.
It was not Tahirih's station only. nor her action merely. not even her words that
caused the consternation: it was her body. It is one thing to accept the concept of
equality as a theory; is it quite another to be told what to think by that female body.
by sorneone like your wife or your mother or your sister. The profound threat which
this imposes on men. the fear it incites which has i s roots in some earlier tirne, some
deeper and subconscious issues, aU add fuel to the Bres of fanaticism that raged about
the Babi community. The women too would fear such ideas with equal if not more
virulent ferocity. They would cling to their veils and revile their sisters who did not,
because by their antagonisrn they could prove their faithfulness to the old Iaw thereby
earning honor. as Delilah did. frorn the old priests. The veil was. finally. the symbol of
sexud fear." ...

'It might be useful one last time to consider the stimng call of this 'trumpeter'

as Shoghi Effendi calls her, 'the noblest of her sex [whose] call...was the death-knell of
the twelve hundred year old law of Islam.' Here she is, a woman. claiming to be that
immaculate, hitherto dl-male Word 'which the Qa'im is to utter'. She is claiming to the
Word that has been associated with the station of the Son of God whose interpretation
has depended on those lesser sons of God, the priests. She is claiming to be
everything which in past dispensations has been associated with patriarchy: the
symbol of God's Revelation, God's Word and God's Law. ..."

"It is an earth-shattering claim. If she is the Word. and the Qa'irn is to utter it.

is not her expression and her defiance of the old order, her unrestraint and courage in
embracing the new. the very message of the age? In what way, then. does this message
challenge the men and women that hear it?"

Some Questions to Ponder

Bahiyyih Nakhjavani describes veils as 'those delusions that we carry around based
on false assumptions or misconceptions of reality." How do we veil ourselves? What
impact does this have?

How do we remove veils?

Why are we veiled?

TAhirih forced those at Badasht to confront their fear of a woman's body. Does this fear
stiU persist? In what form? How does this effect Our lives? How can it be confronted?

In 1957, Dr. Coy rctVed from the Dalton

retirement would bring, but &ter six month
shehad had a11she wantcd of retirement and at
the Intercontinental Confercnce hdd in Chic-

came forward to the platform and voluntcered
to pioncer to h k a or Africa. Her physician

mediately for Salisbury, Rfiodesia. Her con-
cluding years of srnicc were to be performed
on a third continent. The National Spiritual
Assernbly of the Bahk'fs of Rhodcsia has
written :

"Genevieve Coy came to South Africa as a
pioncer very late in fier Iife but was of trtmen-
dous service to the Faith during the period she
lived here. While in Sdisbury she f ived at the
National BahCi Centre for a tirne, enabling
many BahB'i friends to bnefit from hu: vast
knowledge of and experienœ in the Faith. She
wrote two correspondence courses which wcre
and are in wi& use, one on Baha'f History and
one on character &veIoprnent entitled 'To Live

Gcnevieve Coy's Iife was a rich and faithful

'Here 1s The Perfect Silence"

by Genevieve Coy

Here is the perfect silence.

Above the white and blue of ancient w d s ,
The siIver censer of the moon swings in rnid-heaven
Faint fragrance of white jasmine is the spirit of all love

Set free, - a still white flame within the crystal air.

Upon the seaward slope. the grove of giant pines

1s etched in rnajesty against the moonlit night:
Those tall black trunks are bars across the argent light.

A high barred window set against the sky.

At sunset, when 1knelt within the Shrine
> The windows to the West were walls of fire.

Within my sou1 the flame of His great Name
Was like a flashing sword, that severed d l my past.

From this eternal moment -
1 knew myself before the Face of God.
Too temble His glory and too great His power!
How shall one drop resist the ceaseless tide

Of His celestial sea?

But now, when night is deep upon the land

And the calrn beauty of the moon
Moves softly through the vast ethereal arch,

Peace breathes through every atom of air
And draws each living spark to one pure unity.

> The Timeless holds this instant in His hand:
> "Be still, be stil, and know that 1am God!"

Here is the perfect silence.

Supplementary Readings - Workshop Three

> Qurratu'FAyn was a Persian woman without fame and importance-- unknown. like all
other Persian women. When she saw Bahaüllah. she changed completely. visibly. and
looked within another world. The reins of volition were taken out of her hands by

> heavenly attraction. She was so overcome that physical susceptibilities ceased. Her
> husband. her sons and her family arose in the greatest hostility against Baha'u'llah.
She becarne so attracted to the divine threshold that she forsook everything and went

forth to the plain of Badasht. no feir in her heart, daunrless. intrepid. openly
proclaiming the message of light which had come to her. The Persian governrnent stood

against her. They made every effort to quiet her, they imprisoned her in the
governor's house. but she continued to speak. Then she was taken and killed. To her

very last breath she spoke with fenid eloquence and so became famous for her
complete attraction in the path of God. If she had not seen Baha'u'llah. no such effect
would have been produced. She had read and heard the teachings of scriptures a l l her
life, but the action and enkindlement were missing. AU women in Persia are enveloped
in veils in public. So completely covered are they that even the hand is not visible.

This rigid veiling is unspeakable. Qurratu'l-'Ayn tore off her veils and went forth
fearlessly. She was like a iioness. Her action caused a great turmoil throughout the
> land of Persia. So excessive and compulsory is the requirement for veiling in the East
> that the people in the West have no idea of the excitement and indignation produced
by the appearance of an unveiled woman. Qurratu'l-.Ayn lost al1 thought of herself and

was unconscious of fear in her attraction to God.

The Story of Shams-i-Duha.or Khurshid

Sharns -i-Duha. the Morning Sun, named Khurshid. was an orphan. raised by her
grandmother in the home of her cousin, Isfahan's leading rnujtahid. who recognized
her talents and character and gave her a thorough education in the sciences. arts.
and theology. And pity the poor rnujtahid: like Tahirih's father. he couid not help
teaching a child so clever. but deep down they must have known that they were
sowing the seeds of their own undoing. When she came of age - that is. when she
was about twelve - Khurshid married Hadi And this was a lucky match. for Hadi
was a free thinker. who recognized her intellectual capacity and studied the Shayki
teachings with her. Before long, the couple went to Karbila with Hadi's brother
Muhammad-Ali to study with Siyyid Kazim. In Karbila, Khurshid bore a son. 'Ali.
and a daughter, Fatimih, but at the sarne time she attended al1 of Siyyid Kazim's
classes with her husband and brother-in-law. Listening to the lectures and asking
questions from behind a curtain.

When the cry was raised that the Bab had declared Himself in Shiraz. Khurshid
immediately believed: but while her husband and brother-in-law at once lefr
Karbila to join Him, Khurshid had to stay in Karbila with her children. To make
matters worse, Siyyid Kazim soon died: but within a week, Tahirih amved in
Karbila with her sister. Khurshid. the rnorher and sister of Mulla Husayn. and
Tahinh spent most of the next three years together. deepening and teaching and
kicking up trouble in Karbila with Tahirih as their ringleader. Finally, it was too
much for the mullas; they broke into the women's house and seized Khurshid.
thinking she was Tahirih: they abused her. and cursed her. and dragged her
through the streets, beating her with clubs and rocks and assaulting her
repeatedly. undl Tahirih heard of the rnistake and sent word - '1 am at your
disposal. do not harrn any other."

The women were put under house arrest that dragged on as the government tried
to decide what to do with them. Finally, Tahirih proposed that they leave Karbila.
and so Khurshid and her children and mother in law and Tahirih and Muiia
Husayn's sister went frorn town to town. from Baghdad to Kirmanshah to
Hamadan, arriving, teaching the Faith to many of the leading men and al1 of the
townswomen, and staying in each place until the mullas intited a mob to drive

them out. Finally, they came to Qamin, where Tahinh was obliged to return to her
father's house, and where Khurshid's husband Hadi, who hâd been with the Bab in
MAh-Ku, was waiting for her.

So Khurshid left Tahirih, and went with Hadi back to their hometown of hifahan:
but no sooner had they arrived then Hadi left again to go to the conference at
Badasht with his brother. How Khurshid must have Ionged to go. knowing that
her friend Tahirih would be there! But she stayed in Isfahan. On his way back
from Badasht, her husband was attacked by a mob ana died of his wounds in a
ruined caravanserai. His brother Ali buried him by the side of the road and kept
walking.

Khurshid stayed in Isfahan. teaching the women and becoming farnous for her
cleverness and persuasive arguements. There were in Isfahan three brothers. who
were very wealthy and respecteci, and who were also Babis: it was by their financial
assistance that the Holy Family was saved from starvation in its earliest days in
Akka. Because of Khurshid's marvellous reputation. the eldest of these brothers
sought to marry her daughter Fatimih. Khurshid then came to live in his house.
where her teaching work increased. AU the wornen of Isfahan flocked to her door.
Khurshid became the grandmother of a Little boy. Abdul-Husayn. and became
known as the Bahg'i's Lady of Light.

The family was famous for its support of the Bab. and taughr boldly in the face of
the mullas of Isfahan. but they were so well-loved that most people thought chem
immune from persecution. And they may have been, too, if the Ieading rnujtahid of
Isfahan had not owed them eighteen thousand tumans, and decided that killing
them off was easier than repaying his debt. When the mob finally came. they
stripped the house. torturing, beating. cursing, and mocking the women and
children. impnsoning the men. not even sparing the infants at the breast. The
women and children fled to the homes of friends and relations, but were refused
sanctuary. Finally. they took shelter in the outer room of a telegraph office. where
they sat for a few days with no money and no food, until the scandal of their
presence in the quarters of Europeans shamed their families into take them in.
Khurshid's son-in-1aw and his brother became the King of Martyrs and the Beloved
of Martyrs, and now they came after her. S he hid in the home of her brother. a

Moslem but a pious and reclusive man who took no interest in the persecutions.

Finally, however, she was found, and her brother was told to take her to the
Governor's house. He waited outside while she was taken to the women's quarters,
where the governor kicked and beat her into unconsciousness, al1 the while c a . n g
his wife. saying. now look at the Bahg'is lady of light,' saying. this is what happens
to women who step out of line. Saying, see how this woman fdls me with fear. how
her words scare me so badly 1kick her teeth in to ma!se her stop speaking.

The women mopped up the blood, and put Khurshîd to bed in one of their roorns.
But her brother pleaded with the governor. saying, look. her only sin is her
kinship to her son-in-law, she is beaten to the point of death. let me take her home
to die there. And the governor said, she is one of the great leaders and heroines of
the Bahd'is, she will just cause another uproar. But her brother promised she
would not Say another word, and that. indeed. she would soon die and be n o more
trouble to anyone.

So he took her home, but Khurshid was not so quick to die, and inconvenienced
everyone by staying alive, praying and greiving by day and by night, and the
mob would not leave her alone. Now, you must understand. her brother was a
herrnit, and much distressed by the commotion around his house and the rnisery of
his sister. So he resolved to take her to Mashad on pilgrimage. and this he did.
And every morning he went to the mosque. and every night returned, speaking to
no-one, and if he noticed his sister's improvement, and the constant shortage of tea.
he did not ask. He was either oblivious or willingly blind. for as soon as he left
each morning, the house filled with women, their chadors puddled on the floor,
chiidren too smail to tell taies on their hips. and Khurshid moving among them.
teaching them to read, telling them about her new faith, sending them home as
Babis. And each evening they faded back into the streets before her pious brother
came home in a haze of prayer.

This went on for some time. and the townspeople in this zealously anti-Babi town
became quite aggitated. before her brother finally took action. But although he had
the right to do with her as he wished, and to kill her if he liked. he did not reproach
her. did not speak a harsh word. He quietly took her back to Isfahan without

warning. and sent her to live with her daughter, where her boldness would trouble
him no longer. So Khurshid was back with her daughter and grandson. back in
Isfahan. and back in business. teaching and proclaiming the faith as loudly and as
often as she could. And just as the government was about to rise u p again to
silence her. word came from Akka that she, her daughter. and grandson. were to
corne and take refuge with the Holy Family.

And so they made the long trip. and Khurshid knew peace for a time. But soon her
grandson tied of TB.and then. before long, Baha'u'lkh passed away. and Khurshid.
under this final, insufferable blow. released a life's worth of grieving, ending her
days bedridden, praying, teIling stones to her attendents, until finally she packed
her gear and passed into the Abha Kingdom.

Letter from Charles Mason Remey
To the Mernbers of the Kouse of Spirituality of Bah& Chicago, Illinois

From Baha'i News volume 1 #14 (Nov. 23. 1910).p. 3.

Dear Brothers -

...Of the forty and more centres which we have visited on this present tour.

but very few are organized for efficient work. In most places the worK is canied on
by the women almost entirely. The fact that in many places the meetings are held
in the early afternoon would indicate the absence of many men. Wherever we have
gone we have tried to stir up the men to organized effort. Now. if you could work
for this end with al1 of the organized assemblied in the country, 1am sure that a
great work would be accomplished. In order to hold and interest men they must be
kept busy. Women naturally gravitate together in meetings even when there is no
work doing, but men do not. Just now the men are most in need of being reached.

In sorne assemblies they have started organizing Women's Meetings before
organizing the men and women together, thus accentuating, rather than
rninistering properly. to the difficul~. Only today 1had a letter from a good maid-
servant saying that the only man in her assembly had refused to corne to meetings
because he was the only man present. 1mention this because this condition is
typical of that in rnost of the assemblies of Amenca. No one can gainsay that the
dear maid-servants have far more zeal than we have. but 1 know that in many
places the men are simply waiting for men to show them how to work and what to
do.

Now. brothers, if you c m through correspondence arouse the men in the
various assemblies to organization. you will indeed do a work for 'Abdul-Baha. In
most places the men are doing but little. As soon as they are organized and
working together they will bnng in more men - and so on.

The work of organization is, I feel, especially necessary in the early growth
of an assembly. 1have seen the ill-effects of unorganized efforts which have been
allowed to run dong indefinitely...

From what 1 have seen in rny recent travels 1 know that the Bahais
throught the couuy would hail with delight and respond to a plan of simple
organization which you could suggest. Now is the time for such a move. The
results of it will be far-reaching. All the people need is a good suggestions and a
little encouragement.. .

Dear brothers, 1know you will understand my motive so 1 will not
apologize to you for giving so much advice.

> Yours in His Service,

Some Questions to Ponder

What does Mason Remey's letter suggest about the state of the Baha'i community in
1910?

What do you think about John Wilcott's letter as an example of what men are -doing
and planning to do for the advancernent of the Cause"?

What was John Wilcott's mother's name?

Do you know any women like her?

Do you think she would have considered herself bold?

Working for the Advancement of Women
from a letter from the International Teaching Centre

to al1 Counsellors. 5 F e b r u q 1995.

'We would like...to draw your attention to the guidance the House of Justice
contained in a letter dated 5 June 1994 wntten on its behalf to a National Spiritual
Assembly. which underscores in the following terms the fundamental differences
between the 'Baha'i approach to the equality of the sexes and that advocated by
others who are striving passionately for social and attitudinal change":

> Those Baha'is who devote themselves to promotion of the equality of the
> sexes, through speeches and articles, should be aware that such a process will
> be facilitated if it is carried out without disruption to the unity of the
> believers, in order that spiritual blessings are attracted to the community and
> its endeavours reinforced. To maintain this unity. Baha'i men and women
> must work together CO-operatively,in striking contrast to the adversarial and
> denunciatory attitudes which distinguish so much of the movement for
> equality of the sexes in the larger society.

And, in that same letter.

> Baha'is should realize that the Baha'i approach to truth-seeking is
> consultative and not adversarial, and that contention between men and
> women is counter-productive in the endeavour to promote equality.

In many parts of the world women need to be encouraged to arise and play their
part. Without such encouragement they may well continue to remain in the
background. Indeed. it may not occur to tbem that their actions will make a rnarked
difference in the advancement of the Faith at this critical moment in its history. The
House of Justice has in recent years urged that encouragement be given to BahLi
women and girls to participate in their communities. and has appealed to Baha'i
women to arise and demonstrate the importance of their role in dl fields of senice to
the Faith.

It is of particular concern that we demonstrate within Our global comrnunity the
equality of men and women in Our daily lives. ...This entire issue is therefore destined
to become one of the focal points of the external affairs activities of many National
and Local Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world.
What are BahCis Doing to Promote the Advancement of Women?

From a speech by Bani Dugal Gujral
of the Baha'i International Community Office for the Advancement of Women

at the UN Beijing Women's Conference. June 1998.

'Over 40 Bahii'i communities worldwide have established special offices and cornmittees
for the advancement of women that undertake projects both independently and jointly
with other like-minded organizations. In Austraüa. the Bahai Office for the
Advancement of women is working closely with coalitions of national women's
organizations to support taskforces on 'Women and Peace' and 'Women in Decision
Making', two of the critical areas identified in the Beijing Platform for Action. In the
Federated States of Micronesia seminars have drawn indigenous women and high-
ranking government officiais together to cornmernorate International Women's Day.
In Germany the Baha'i Women's Forum has formed a number of topic groups to
promote the discussion of issues such as "women and art". 'the advancement of menw.
and 'violence against women": and in Denmark meetings have been help on 'Women
and AIDS' and female genital mutilation.

Many Baha'i projects focus on changing attitudes. In Chad. a rural radio program
devotes one hour a day to programs for the advancement of women in the Moissala
region. In Austria, a nationwide series of seminars on such themes as
'Encouragement." 'Changew. and 'Servicemhas raised the awareness of the connection
between women's issues and other important issues. In SIngapore. where women
were often unable to participate in Baha'i community activities because they were
caring for children. men have begun sharing child care responsibilities so the women
c m participate in activities of their choice.

Educating women and girls has long been a prioriiy for Bahai cornmunities. In
Equatoriai Guinea, the Baha'i community. in cooperation with the Wnistry of Women
and Social Affairs. CO-sponsoredfunctional Literacy courses for women, whose topics
included reproductive health. nutrition. and basic mathematics. In Zambia. a
residential International Secondary School emphasizing science and agriculture has
been established for rural girls in grades 8-12. The school. which provides an
internationally recognized certificate. also incorporates moral education and
community service into its curriculum. In Senegal. Baha'i women teach women in a
neighbonng village practical skills for generating income or improving their daily

Lives. In Ghana, the Bahai community participated in the first Global Wornen's Trade
Fair and Investment Forum. including conducting a workshop on '12 Essential Values
of a New Age Business Woman." They are also using consultation and team building
exercises to strengthen the skills and capacity of the community and build better
business linkages.

To seek an end to domestic violence, the Baha'i International Comrnuniy initiated a
symposium on 'Strategies for Creating a Violence-Free Family", which was co-
sponsored by UNICEF and UNIFEM. Forty experts frorn d l over the world and from
diverse professional disciplines met to develop guidelines for addressing family
violence. A project aimed at engaging men in irnproving the status of women in
Carneroon, Bolivia and Malaysia resulted in a documented decrease in domestic
violence. Developed by the Baha'i International Community and funded by UNIFEM.
the 'Traditional Mediawproject taught communities research techniques and
consultative skills which they used to investigate the status of women in their own
communities, and devise plans to improve the situation. They used traditionai media
such as songs, dance and stories to engage the larger community in discussion of these
issues. In India. tribal women are also being taught to use dance workshops to share
their concerns about problems of alcoholism and illiteracy.

Some Bahg'i comrnunities have undertaken to influence policies relating to women and
children. The Baha'i National Women's Committee in the UK worked with other
religious groups to win passage of legislation in March 1997 that would bring to justice
UK citizens involved in the exploitation of children overseas. In the United States. the
National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah& CO-chairsan NGO working group composed
of more than 100 organizations. This working group is advocating Government
ratification of the UN Convention of Women, urging the implementation of the Beijing
Platform for Action, and supporting a strong US position on the violations of the
rights of women in Afghanistan.

These are just a few examples of the ways in which Bahg'i communities - both women
and men - are attempting to promote equality, to develop women's capacities. and to
ensure women's full participation in the affairs of the world. The process may be slow.
but we are convinced that eventually both wings wili attain their full strength and the
bird of humanity will wing its flight to unimagined heights."

> Woman must endeavour then to attain greater perfection. to be man's equal in every
respect, to make progress in a l l in which she has been backward. so that man will be

compelled to acknowledge her equality of capacity and attainment.

In Europe women have made greater progress than in the East, but there is still much -
to be done! When students have arrived at the end of their school term an examination

> takes place. and the result thereof determines the knowledge and capacity of each
student. So will it be with woman; her actions will show her power. there will no

longer be any need to procIaim it by words.

It is my hope that women of the East, as well as their Western sisters. will progress

rapidly until humanity shall reach perfection.

God's Bounty is for all and gives power for all progress. When men own the equality of
women there will be no need for them to struggle for their rights! One of the pnnciples

then of Baha'u'llah is the equality of sex.

Women must make the greatest effort to acquire spiritual power and to increase in the

Wtue of wisdom and hoiiness until their eniightenment and striving succeeds in
bringing about the unity of mankind. They must work with a burning enthusiasm to
spread the Teaching of Baha'u'llah among the peoples. so that the radiant light of the

Divine Bounty may envelop the souk of al1 the nations of the world!

The Hidden Words of Baha'u 'Ilah (Persian) 676

And let it be known once more that unid woman and man recognize and realize
equality. social and political progress here or anywhere will not be possible. For the
world of humanity consists of two parts or members: one is woman: the other is man.
Untd these two members are equal in strength. the oneness of humanity cannot be
established. and the happiness and felicity of mankind will not be a reality. God

willing, this is to be so.

Promulgation of Unirrend Peace. 77.

But while this pnnciple of equaüty is tme, it is likewise tme that woman must prove
her capacity and aptitude. must show forth the evidences of' equaiity. She must become

proficient in the arts and sciences and prove by her accomplishments that her abilities
and powers have merely been latent. Demonstrations of force ... are neither becoming
nor effective in the cause of womanhood and equality. Woman must especidly devote
her energies and abilities toward the industrial and agricultural sciences. seeking to

> assist mankind in that which is rnost needful. By this means she will demonstrate

Undoubtedly God wiU confirm her in her efforts and endeavors, for in this century of

and announced that all nations. peoples and races are one.

in the Cause of God, the meaning of it is this: limit thy thoughü to teaching the Faith.

Act by day and night according to the teachings and counsels and admonitions of
Bahbu'llah. This doth not preclude marriage. Thou canst take unto thyself a husband

and at the sarne time serve the Cause of God: the one doth not preclude the other.

> Know thou the value of these days: let not this chance escape thee. Beg thou God to
make thee a lighted candle, so that thou mayest guide a great multitude rhrough this

darksome world.

Selecrions from the Wtitings of 'Abdu ?-Baha. IOO.

Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world. and this nether place is only its shadow

stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own: its existence is only a fantasy, and
nothing more: it is but images reflected in water, and seerning as pictures to the eye.

Rely upon God. Trust in Him. Praise Him, and cal1 Hirn continuaily to mind. He verily
turneth trouble into ease, and sorrow into solace. and toil into utter peace.

He verily hath dominion over all things.

If thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself from the fetters of whatsoever
corneth to p a s . Nay rather. under all conditions thank thou thy loving Lord. and yield
up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He pleaseth.

This verily is better for thee than d l else. in either world.

Selections from che Writings of 'AbduMaha. 1 77.

O handmaid of God, peace must first be established among individuals. until it leadeth

communion and durable bonds among individuals. This is your task.

committed (by principle) to equality - donVtaiways know how to implernent the principle."

'The Baha'i view of mariage and the roles of the father and mother in a farnily have both been
c o n f m e d in my life."

'No, equal nghts for men and women was aIways sornething 1 strongly believed in. But 1 think the
Bahai faith has encouraged me to be stubborn about what 1 believe. It also has helped me to give it a
suucture."

mMens/Womens Roles

'1 believe there has to be more emphasis on the opportunities rather than 'roles.' 1 think in today's
sociey it is dificult to defme roles for the two sexes.'

'1 see wornen as the one who accommodates - men, chiIdren, job. discussion. And the balancer,
defemng to others. Keeping peace in the family. looking afler her own needs lasr. Men are
traditionally the taker. on the receiving end. sometirnes deferring to women when confronted or
chaIlenged - sometimes taking initiative and letting women have equal opponunities - maybe in clhe
real important areas (job. education. etc.) *

-The role of women and men are changing at the present tirne. We seem to talk about new roles but
most 'examples' are still based on what we hzve been used to in the past."

"Men and women are human beings first, and possess al1 of the atu-ibutes and foibles of al1 mernbers
of the human race- In my culture, we have been raised to focus on differences rather than similuities.
on difFerentiation of roles rather than the synergy of two people working in harmony. Men and
women are really bound to the Sacred script' that they choose to play out male-female relations in
their lives. whether it be the societa1 n o m or some other source, Divine in nature.*

-Equa.Iity..-will corne to exist when we have a better knowledge of self as women and men. Tien we
c m work on the areas that c m unite the two sexes and allow them to work in harmony ...-- 1 see women
as controllers in areas that do not count or are nor so visible! Women are peacemakers who need to
develop the right skills for peace with justice, men need to be acknowledged and educated in their
role as provider and educator of their children ....1 beiieve now..-that women and men need to work on
the very uncornfonable issues that separate them so they can break the silence and truly l e m . "

"Women's role is to claim their unique abilities and rejoice in them. Women must dare to tntst
men. Women must boldly educate al1 to appreciate women and their role. Men ...must earn women's
trust and be able to swallow their pride and recognize their ability to abuse power and give some
power away.'

~ W h a is

t the main thing that you think you might remember from the workshops?

'Points of historicaI/spiritual significance.
A sense of empowerment-
The CREATIVITY. the HONESTY. the TALENT of the teachers.
The joy that women can share with each other.
How definition of words c m separate us and threaten compassion."

"The porch ladies.
The art work.
The candles. reverence.
The laughter - Ha Ha - BeiIy Laughter."

'The people, the stories toId by Sophie. the art and artistic expressions of Faye, contributions from
the participants.'

'The diversity of the participants added to the discussion - broadened my knowledge and
understanding.'

'The advancement of women and to keep working and not to give up."

'The hard work that you guys have put into this workshop-"

'The experience of storytelling in the Baha'i Faith- 1 had never corne across such amount of incredible
story telling dealing with the ferninine roIe."

*What do you think should be changed to improve the workshops?

'1 think this workshop was well-organized for its purpose."

'To have more discussions accornpanied by writings that would direct us toward the applicatior, of
what we read as spiritua1 guidance-"

*The overdl goals need to be emphasized more and the Iink of the individual workshops ro rhe
o v e d l goais could be made clearer.'

'More time - actually. no, it was just right-
1 felt that the issues of race and gender were ignored - but then we had no time - but ir's a real issue
for me,'

-Questions should not be Ieadùig. Some ruIes/guidelines established at the beginning to ensure a
'safe space" where people can express without judgement - perhaps some reading of the writings on
consultation. Journal writing and sharing would provide increased feedback and insight."

@Doyou feel like coming the the workshops was worthwhile for you? Why?

'YES! This is the most profound workshop 1 have been a part of in the Baha'i community or
elsewhere, It has reveaIed/confmed my role as a woman in this day as a Baha'i regarding bringing
about world unity of medwomen. Tt bas provided me wirh new role modek and new energy to
acdserve. "

'Yes - 1have Ieamed so much and I love myself and my Baha'i sisters more because of i t I have always
felt disconnected from Baha'i herstory and this heIped me take ownership."

'Yes, it was fun and reIaxing. but informative at the same tirne."

-1 enjoyed them al! - but no one identifiable change or new insight for rny personal Iife. Learning
about early Baha'i women does give courage and an example to follow."

'Yes 1 feel the coming togecher of al1 of us as suong women was joyous and exciting!"

'Yes.      enjoyed listening to other peopk's opinions in a friendiy environment"

'Yes. the workshops helped open my eyes to feminism a bit more and 1 felt empowered."

@Do you think the workshops would be more effective if there were both men and
women participants? Or separate workshops for men-only?
'1 don't know- 1 liked women on1y.-

'Yes. 1think men need to share their thoughts and feelings. They also need to hear women's honest
opinions and feelings in a peacehl environment.-

-Inan equal world the men and women would not even want to have workshops on these Issues! Now.
in our not so perfect world. whar do    think'? So the workshop for men separately would be more
effective and fruitful."

'Yes [mixed workshops] and no [men-only workshops] .*

'Women are not 'at ease' when men are present as men usualiy dominace discussions. The workshops
for men-only is a very good idea as both genders need to change."

'No, two workshops running paralle1 and then meeting cogether at certain safe times. We need to
experience success in gender unity!!! We need practical win-win exercises when we corne together.'

'Separate workshops for men-only. Women have too little areadspaces they can daim as their own in
this world. We are too often fooled into guilt for calling something our own. Tt would not be an act
of rejection - but an opportunity (and was an opporrunity) co emphasize Our SELF - without being the
'other' and wifi-our, possibly, feeling inhibited or questioned."

Summary of Post-Workshop Evaluation Responses

What (if any) effect did the workshops have on how you feel?

1' feel cioser contact with the faith."

'Putting on and taking off the veil evoked many feelings."

'1 feel more Iiberated.'

'The workshops were ernpowering for me as a Bahai and as a woman. It was good to encounter these
topics in a non-polar way (ie.. ememes). The workshops made me feel. and still make me feel rhat
there is hope.'

'1 fe1t very happy to be on my path for advancement of women with my own colors, energetic.
enthsiastic. and less burdened by age-old pain and Iimitations of rny past as being limited by being a
girl o r a woman'

-IL made me feel bonded to other Baha'i wornen.I t made me feel relieved to experience such
expressions of an understanding of women's oppression."

-1 feel closer to the workshop participants - especially the organizers. 1 also feel closer ro the Bzha'i
women of the p a x 1 like history - it always gives me courage and stimulates me co think of ~ h great

e
persons of the past-"

What (if any) effect did the workshops have on what you think?

-1 imagine I think more as a Baha'i shouid think or perhaps how 1 think   2   Baha'i shouId think,"

'It made me think there's rnuch work to do and yet. if su. the besr way to do it is through the Faith."

-Circurnstances allows some women to overIook inequity - ie-. love. children. role as peacemaker, lack
of courage. Age, experience helps one to take another look-"

'1 feel a closeness to my Bahai brothers and sisters in rising to this challenge, particularly my
sisters."

'The workshop made me think of more ways to try and help other women to heal. by empowering them
and not belittling men. Equaiity to me is ore of how we cari let go of our pzin and heal ta become
cornrades w i h men rather than disliking the way they are and making mysef to be superior m o n g
other women and continuing to feeI pain."

'1 enlarged my knowledge of Baha'i history. It also had an effect on the thinking process - your
approach in the workshops was very organized. very systematic presentations. and perhaps now 1 think
in a more systematic way. It had not occurred to me before but now 1 apply rny scientific capaciry for
systematic thinking and organization ro promoting the advancement of women."

l   What (if any) effect did the workshops have on what you do?

'1 take a more active role in the Baha'i community-'

'1 pay particular attention to the rofe of women, my role as a woman and the voices of others when
discussing the advancement of women. 1 feel compelled to move towards bringing this issue u p
everywhere - in children's classes. in my work (which 1 did.) 1 dso use the prayers and writings."

' have decided to do more of ernpowering men. those who are just and Ioving and work towards rhe

\[1\] advancement of humanity. When those men wh.o are empowered fmd voice within women who have
been hürt, they will organize *menmactivities!"

'It had the effect of making me feel more free to   be me - open. cetermined. etc."

'At the present time 1 am interested in increasing my knowledge of environmental issues - and it was
fortunate because one of the other participants was giving taik on it- These workshops provided an
opportunity to network - which is very effective and important especially for women and how wornen
work, A recenc study of the habits of successful women in business showed that chey worked in webs
of networks, and that this increased their eficiency and effectiveness-...the workshops helped me by
increasing my nenvorking."

t you remember the most from the workshops?

~ W h a do

'The sense of connection to the stories and the fellow-participants.'

'The coming together of some strong, Ioving wornen in the community who are concerned for their
well-being when it comes to equality. And are wiliing to roll up their sIeeves to help in this
process."

'The arts - hands on - because it was unusual. The play - that was a bit provocative. The stories - 1
liked the rnost. They were informative and educational. 1 enjoyed listening to them and participating
in the Fo'ollow-up discussions- The workshops' emphasis on how more than what was very nice
especially for me who comes home exhausted - it made us feel cornfortable, made it interesting. The
workshops did not stuff us with knowledge and information but were teaching us through experience.
1remember the journey you took us on."

'Putting on the veil. An actual experience, rather than irnagining how 1 would feel-"

'The storytelling, especiaIly the evening we were veiled."

'1 remember a11 the storytelling-"

'The comfon, the joy of discovery in Iistening to the stories. The creative stuff - drarna, anwork.
stories. The food! Thank you for your generous hospitality! The prayers and writings were so lovely!
Discussion was great too."

If you were running the workshops next time. what changes would you want to
make?
'1 would elhinate the remarks about the sexual life of the Propher: of God and approach a discussion
on sexuality a different way - dthough just as openly. 1 would indude more mediration.-

'1 would move away from making women to be superior by rny language, thoughts, and beliefs. Any
cornrnents that would belittle men should be eliminated from the presenter's vocabulary."

'None, I wculd do the same thing probably- Here's my wish list-- 1 wish the course ran longer so we
couId cover more ie. women of colour issues, taking action.. That's it!"

'OnIy change I can think of - irnproved meeting place."

'No specific suggestions.,. The pIace and the date - mid-week - were maybe not the best. Ifs always
good to have some follow-up pIan. to channel the momentum From such vaIuabIe experiences and
networks - through a semi-formal institute. or publishing the resulrs..- we did nor want to part at the
l a s workshop."

~        do you think it is that the Baha'i cornmunity increase its activeness in
promoting the advancement of women?
not very important - O moderacely important - 1     very importam - 5 urgent - 1

'Ifs really urgent, but so is al1 of the work of the Baha'i communiry. We've got Divine deadIines!"

How important do you think it is that you increase your activeness in promoting
the advancernent of women?
not very important - O moderateV important - 2 very important - 4 urgent -

'The contacts 1 have established allow me to get active - this is the only way the society c m change. 1
believe women have a very important role to play in social change. The higher women get in rheir
workplaces and society the harder it is for them to make an impact, to be heard."

'However 1 don't know how much more 1 can do these days?! 1am very active in my own life LO
empower myself as welI as always being in the front lines of Baha'i activities and very open when ir
cornes to the needs and education of women-"

Do you    feel able to do so? If not. what would enable you to?

'Not as much as r d wish to- But 1 can. daily, as an example. in my words.-- Time constraints and
personal baggage currently restrict me and so time and growth wiII heip and support systems and
group pmicipation/interest.'

'1 feel very abIe in promoting the advancement of women in my Iife and within the cornmunity too.
As long as there are those of us within the community working away as 'women' in every activity that
either is organized by us, supported and encouraged the change is slow but happening!-

'1 do quite a lot through the international cmography association. the cask force on women, and the
gender and cartography commission. dirough networking and sustainable development activities- T'd
like to get more involved in the Baha'i community's activities too - when I work with Baha'is there is
more excitement and spirit and encouraging one another - but in non-Baha'i organizations 1 often get
bumed out or discouraged as there is too much resisrance to feminisrn-'

'1 feel that 1am able to promote my own advancement as a womm bur 1 don't know about die
advancement of women in general.'

Do you have plans to do so? How?
'1 will need to revisit my schedule and see how and when so that 1 c m approach the cornmunity on this

issue. 1 wiU bring it up at the Community Development Consultation that I've been asked to attend
and propose it to the Assembly as a topic of consultation. Also. 1 am working with some pre-youth

boys (mostiy; 2 girls too) at the Baha'i school. Tt would be great to plan and deIiver a unic on the
advancement of wornen-"

-My plans are already at work! Within the community 1 have a voice that continuousIy gets heard and
from time to time changes occur as a result of my voice and other women like myself! The task is
challenging yet rewarding! 1enjoy serving on many cornmittees where 1 grow. suffer, and change as
well as influence change for the growth of women!"

-1 am trying to add environmentalism and gender issues to my professional Iife as a human
geographer. 1 have plans to work and give talks in this area."

'Yes.   Use of 'ferninine' prayers at Feasts. 1 have alsa made a suggestion to a cornmittee-'

'Attending workshops for women. ie.. this weekend - The Sacred joumey. Inviting 2 friends (1 Baha'i
and 1 other potential Baha'i) to my home for dinner and free reflexology ueatrnents by two other
friends (1 Bahai).

'1 am taking a diploma at Algonquin and 1 am working at mnning a househoid by myself,"

'No plans - although 1 am becoming more activeIy involved in the cornmunity.        1 feel that is a step in
the right direction."

Did the workshop series affect your answers to these questions?

'Yes. 1have had it reinforced in me, the idea that women's roles and visibiIiy and acceptance must be
focussed on.'

'Yes - especially the need to keep closer contact with Bahâ'is. It was very joyful and when we feel
happy we can do more. And together we can do more. I'd be v e v hterested in joining a group of
people working on this issue. Before my involvement in the workshops 1 wou1d not have thought of
it, but now 1 am aware and am working for mapping for minorities - children, the blinci. wornen. etc."

'The workshop was only helpful for me to recognize at what stage in life 1 am and how fortunate to
have healed rny pain as a 'woman." However. many women at mmy different stages of healing brought
Iove and syrnpathy to my h e m and 1 got again a reminder of how far we as wornen have to go to first
heal ourselves before we can make any changes in the Iives of other women."

-on yeah - it cenainly did.   1 stiH have more questions!"

'Yes. they helped me feel more emancipated-"

'1 don't know - 1 guess so - but 1 can't think specificaIly how. 1 really enjoyed them and came away
feeling reaily invigorated and Feeling more comrnitted to my involvernent in the cornmunicy-"
