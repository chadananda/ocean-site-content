A STUDY IN CHARASMATIC RENEWAL IN SHĪʿĪ ISLAM

Ph.D. Dissertation by Denis Martin MacEoin, King’s College, Cambridge

The present study seeks to explore a neglected but important development in the
history of Iranian Shiʿism in the period immediately preceding the beginning of
full-scale Western economic and political penetration. Shiʿism has, in general,
not witnessed the emergence of significant reformers in the modern period,
comparable to those of the Sunnī world. Earlier, much attention was focused on
Babism and Baha’ism, but these movements are less reformist than heterodox in
nature and, in the end, seek to move beyond an Islamic frame of reference
altogether. This, however, is paradoxical, in that early Babism and the Shaykhī
school from which it emerged both laid considerable stress on orthodoxy and on
rigid Islamic practice. It is the purpose of this thesis to demonstrate the place of
this paradox within the wider context of Twelver Shiʿism as a whole and to
explore the role of authority claims and the interplay of charismatic and legal
authority as basic factors in the emergence of the Shaykhi and Bābī movements.

The introduction discusses the relevance of the present study to
contemporary events in Iran, notably the religiously-inspired revolution led by
Ayatollah Khomeini. The first chapter considers the nature of authority and
charisma in Shiʿism following the ‘disappearance’ of the twelfth Imām,
analyzing the role of the religious establishment as a whole and the mujtahids
and marājiʿ al­taqlīd in particular, as well as the place of works of fiqh and
ḥadīth as sources of traditional authority; this chapter also concerns itself with a
detailed discussion of developments in Shiʿism in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, particularly in respect of the emergence of individual ulama as foci for
routinized charisma.

It is followed by chapters on Shaykh Aḥmad al­Aḥsāʾī (the founder of the
Shaykhi school) and his successor Sayyid Kāẓim Rashtī. Chapter Four deals
with the main schismatic developments in Shaykhism following the death of the
latter and discusses the circumstances in which Sayyid ʿAlī Muḥammad Shīrāzī
(the Bāb) established his position as the principal claimant to leadership of the
school. Chapter Five approaches the question of early Babi doctrine, first by
describing and analyzing the earliest writings of the Bab then by a detailed
consideration of his various claims in the early period. In the final chapter, the
course of the Babi propaganda among the Shaykhis in Iraq is discussed, with
emphasis on controversies centered on the figure of Qurrat al­ʿAyn, a woman
who became the leading ʿālim of the religion; the Shaykhi reaction to Babism,
divisions within the early Babi community, first steps taken by Qurrat al­ʿAyn

and her followers towards the abrogation of the Islamic sharīʿa, and the Babi
rejection of Shaykhism are all discussed.

PREFACE TO 1979 THESIS

Sources

In writing the present dissertation, I have drawn on a wide variety of manuscript
and printed sources in Persian, Arabic, English, French and, to a lesser extent,
other European languages. As regards Shīʿī Islam, general Qajar history, and
other background topics, I have relied exclusively on printed materials. For
Babism, I have drawn widely on manuscripts located in Cambridge University
Library (mostly in the E. G. Browne Collection), the British Library, the Iranian
National Bahaʾi Archives in Tehran, the International Bahaʾi Archives in Haifa
and a few private collections. I have discussed at length the relevant materials in
“A Revised Survey of the Sources for Early Babi Doctrine and History” (see
bibliography) and more briefly in this dissertation. [The “Revised Survey” has
since been published as Sources for Early Babi Doctrine and History—see
bibliography.] I have also made use of British consular and diplomatic materials
kept in the Public Record Office, London; extensive research on these for the
purpose of locating references to Shaykhism and Babism has been carried out
over a period of several years by my friend and colleague, Dr. Moojan Momen,
to whom I am most grateful for his permission to refer to his Xerox copies and
notes. Since large amounts of the main Shaykhi sources have been printed, I
have made only limited use of manuscripts for this aspect of my research.

The printed materials for Babism include large numbers of books, many
of them secondary, published by the Azalī Bābīs and the Bahaʾis in Iran. Since
these books cannot be obtained through the normal channels they are not
generally available anywhere but in private hands; thanks to the kindness of my
friends over several years, I have been able to build up an almost complete
library of these works. Particular mention should be made here of the Azalī
editions of several important works of the Bab and to Mīrzā Asad Allāh Fāḍil-i
Māzandarānī’s Tārīkh­i ẓuhūr al­ḥaqq (volume 3), which contains copious
partial and complete quotations from early Babi literature. Even less readily
obtainable are copies of facsimile reproductions of manuscripts in the Tehran
Bahaʾi archives [Iran National Bahaʾi Archives], distributed to a very limited
group of subscribers some years ago. The European printed materials by Edward
Granville Browne, Arthur Comte de Gobineau, A.­L.­M. (Louise Alphonse
Daniel) Nicolas and others are generally well known and available in most
serious libraries; I have used them widely, but with great caution, since they are
often inaccurate and certainly much outdated.

Later Bahaʾi­produced materials in Persian or English are generally of
little value for Babi history or doctrine, but I have made careful use of Shoghi

Effendi’s edited translation of Nabīl­i Zarandī’s Tārīkh­i Nabīl1 (the original text
of which has not yet been published in any form) and several recent historical
works by Muḥammad­ʿAlī Malik Khusravī (Nūrī), Muḥammad ʿAlī Fayḍī, and
Ḥasan Muvaqqar Balyuzi. The main printed materials for Shaykhism may be
found adequately catalogued in Fihrist­i kutub­i Shaykh­i ajall­i awḥad marḥūm
Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsā’ī by Abū ’l­Qāsim ibn Zayn al­ʿĀbidīn Khān Kirmānī; this
work also contains a detailed list of Shaykhi manuscripts kept in Kirman. The
only European sources dealing with early Shaykhism are works by Nicolas and
Corbin, but none of these is at all adequate for the purposes of serious research.

Transliteration and dates

The system of transliteration is, with few modifications, that used by most
scholarly publications in this field, and is largely based on that of The Oxford
Encyclopedia of Islam in the Modern World. Inconsistencies necessarily occur
where I am quoting or referring to materials in European languages using
different systems. As ever, it is a problem combining both Arabic and Persian
words and phrases in one document. For the sake of consistency, I have
preferred an Arabic­based system, since it is more sensitive to the letters in both
languages, but fully accept that this does not do justice to the pronunciation of
Persian words, even where they are straight adaptations of Arabic originals.
Those familiar with the eccentric Bahaʾi system of transliteration may find
themselves nonplussed by this essentially academic system. I can only point out
that the forms in common use by Baha’is today are inconsistent and
problematic, and that my system will prove much more accurate for the
retranscription of words back to Arabic or Persian. In the case of many names I
have used full transliteration only on their first occurrence. Common place­
names (Basra, Tehran) are written as they normally appear in atlases.

In the text, reference is made to Western and lunar Muslim dates, while in the
bibliography, use is also made of the solar Muslim, Babi/Bahaʾi (badīʿ), and
Iranian Shāhanshāhī calendars.

Preface to the published edition

This must be the strangest of the many books I have published over the years. It
is a lightly edited version of my 1979 PhD thesis, written at King’s College,
Cambridge and completed when I was twenty­nine years old. I’m now closer to
sixty, yet re­reading and editing the text for this publication, everything seems as
fresh to me now as it did then. In an ideal world, one without other
commitments, it deserved a complete re­writing. When I wrote it, not much had
been written in European languages about Shiʿism, Shaykhism, or Babism;
today, Shiʿism has become a popular academic topic and the subject of whole
conferences (let alone daily news reports from Iran and Iraq), but almost no­one
but my coeval Abbas Amanat, Todd Lawson and myself has written
substantially about the Babis, and no­one has taken Shaykhi studies an inch
further. Heavy­handedness on the part of the governing bodies of the Baha’i
religion towards academic and intellectual work has made it next to impossible
for a younger generation of Baha’i scholars to emerge from that milieu, and
interest in the subject from outsiders (besides myself and the Danish scholar
Margit Warburg) has never been kindled.

To be honest, I think it unlikely that Babism will ever be more than a
peripheral topic for academics in Islam, Shiʿism, or Iranian studies. The only
people to remain interested in this almost­forgotten byway of 19th­century
Shiʿism are members of the Baha’i faith, and they will seldom find an honest
appraisal of Babism particularly attractive.

A full re­write would have been attractive for all sorts of reasons; but my
growing commitments in the years following completion of this work proved
too great a drain on my energy and time even to contemplate something on that
scale. I did, of course, write books, articles and encyclopedia entries on
Shaykhism and Babism, all of which add up to a substantial appendix to the
present book, as can be seen from the bibliography. Many of these have been
made available online to provide readers with access to studies of Babi
militancy, ritual, texts and more, up through the important phase of Middle
Babism (roughly 1850 to the 1860s) and beyond. But, as the years passed and I
read more, I simply could not find time to write the longer study that this should
have been. That’s a shame, but I still hope the present text has enough to offer
readers a further insight into the way Babism developed out of orthodox
Shiʿism.

Since a majority of those who will read this book will be Baha’is, perhaps it is in
order to say a little about where a work of this kind stands in relation to their
beliefs and attitudes.

For my own part, I have traveled a long way since writing the thesis. I
began it as a committed Baha’i and not long after its completion parted from the
religion. That has been unfortunate in that some Baha’is have concluded that

academic study in a secular environment and with rationalist methods is inimical
to faith. As a secular humanist, I would agree that it is, but many Christians and
Jews and a tiny number of Muslims would disagree. For all that, the experience
of other Baha’i academics since then has reinforced that earlier conclusion in the
minds of many.

This is a pity, since academic pursuits ought to be encouraged in a
religious context, particularly in a religion that advocates the independent search
after truth and the harmony of science and faith. The debate is no longer mine to
a large degree. Within the Baha’i religion itself, controversy over these and
related issues rages and takes a high toll. There can be no reason at all why
sound academic study of a religion should lead to the loss of faith. Many Baha’i
academics successfully combine serious scholarship with belief, just like their
counterparts in several other religions. What will be lost is a naïve belief in
hagiography, in literal interpretations of texts, in excessive deference to religious
authorities. Those are, surely, healthy things to lose, and, indeed, Baha’is
themselves regularly counsel followers of other faiths to lose them. There should
be no conflict here.

My task in all this has simply been to show how an academic, scientific,
secular study of religion is possible. I have taken my cue from earlier work on
religious history by Jewish and Christian scholars, as well as secular­minded
academics like myself. Historical truth should not prove destructive of faith.
Destruction comes when attempts are made to deny simple facts, to wrap events
in a caul of mystery, to challenge what was through an appeal to what should
have been. There is nothing in these pages that should disturb a faithful but
intelligent Baha’i, but there is much that should challenge them.

As a simple example of how mythologizing can harm both the truth and
people’s ability to hold to a higher truth, I will mention something that is not in
these pages. Elsewhere, I have shown calculations, based on original histories,
that demonstrate beyond a shadow of doubt that the number of Babis killed
between 1844 and the early 1850s amounted to scarcely more than 3,000
persons, perhaps 4,000 if we inflate the figures. Even recently, the Baha’i
authorities have re­affirmed the accuracy of their claim that an iconic figure—
20,000—died. This is to fly in the face of all the evidence, including that of their
own sources. No historian of any quality or dignity would venture beyond the
figures I have given, and some might reduce them. My figures are based on a
count of names and rough figures given for the four main incidents in which
Babis died, together with extra figures with much smaller death counts. For
there to have been a further 17,000 deaths that are unaccounted for in
government, diplomatic, Babi, or Baha’i sources beggars belief. It is simply not
likely that as many as 20,000 Babis even existed in Iran between 1844 and 1852,
the period of the main incidents. To give some idea of how vast the discrepancy
is, we need only note that 20,000 equals the number of British dead during the
Battle of the Somme.

No intelligent historiography can continue where such irrational denials of
the obvious occur. There is absolutely nothing to stop Baha’is recognizing those
3,000 martyrs, valuing them, or writing about them in a hagiographic fashion.
They have a right to do that. What they do not have is a right to falsify or deny
explicit evidence. If they ever come up with solid proof that 20,000 died, I will
be the first to welcome the new figure. That is what this is all about: respect for
evidence, respect for honest conclusions based on rational considerations,
respect for the adventure that scientific and academic research and writing
represent.

As far as the present thesis is concerned, a few words are in order, just to
make clear a few points that some readers might misunderstand. The
personalities, books, doctrines and events discussed in this book have been, over
the years, the subject of veneration, hagiography, and propaganda within an
intense religious context ranging from vicious polemic to uncritical acceptance.
Even names like “The Bāb”, “Ṭāhira”, or “Bahaʾ Allāh” can trigger off reactions
that have their origin in religious belief, making it difficult to engage in rational
discourse about the environment in which they lived, the books they wrote, or
the things they did and said. But this is an academic work, a book that started
life as a PhD dissertation and has only been lightly revised. The methodology it
uses, the standards by which it must be judged, and the weighting it gives to
documents and persons all belong to the realms of academe and science and do
not attempt or wish to be part of any religious debate.

In order to distance this work from the thought processes of true believers,
I have deliberately written in a style designed to force a dislocation from the sort
of pious veneration that closes the mind and leads to knee­jerk responses. Baha’i
readers, if they believe in the harmony of faith and science must respect my
approach or dismiss rational processes outright. Whether they do so or not is not
my business. As an academic and a non­believer I have no investment in any of
the people around whom my narrative is based. The Bab is just another human
being: a genius, a madman, or something in between, it is hard to tell. Shaykh
Ahmad al­Ahsaʾi and Sayyid Kazim Rashti are simply two Shiʿi clerics, one of
outstanding philosophical stature, the other a learned defender of his master’s
name.

Modern Baha’is are not accustomed to see these figures of their founding
myth handled without the kid gloves of piety. Unfortunately, the prophetic aura
has no place in unbiased historiography. Throughout this book, I have tried to
wean pious readers (if there are any) off their diet of romance and mysticism.
They are welcome to go back to that diet once they have read, digested, and
dealt rationally with my presentation of the facts. But they are not welcome to
attack my findings or my presentation on the basis of what their hagiographies
tell them. Hagiographies occupy a different mental plane to academic histories,
and religious conviction is no substitute for hard fact in a rational context.

To further this process, I have tried to reduce the belief factor as far as
possible. For example, I do not use the Baha’i system of transliteration, first
because it is a very bad system, and secondly because it predisposes readers to
recollect pious versions of persons and events. I call the Babi heroine Ṭāhira
mainly by her earlier honorific, Qurrat al­ʿAyn, because the former name is too
closely associated with myth and legend to allow readers to see her freshly, to
understand her, not as the “first suffragette martyr” that she never was, but as a
learned and original woman who was, if I am not mistaken, the real driving
force behind the Babi movement and its break with Islam. I want readers to see
these things as clearly as possible, and not just revert to the cardboard cut­outs
on which they have been raised.

In the text, notes and bibliography, I regularly refer to the Bab as
“Shīrāzī” because I want to place him firmly alongside all the Hamadānīs,
Iṣfahānīs, Tehranis, and others with whom he lived and to whom he preached
his message. I hope that, in doing so, I divest him of his magical powers and let
readers come to him much as history shows us, and not as a figure outside
history. It is not for me to say whether he was in reality a mere man or a
manifestation of the divine. What I do not have the right to do in a book of this
kind is to treat him as anything but a man, for that is all our historical material
presents him as. It is the eye of faith that will render him divine if it must: the
eye of reason is restricted to this mundane existence.

There are many faults in this book, and I’m sure some reviewers will take the
opportunity to take me to task for them. I do ask them to be kind to the faults of
youth that are still exposed raw and unhealed in these pages. As a professional
writer of many years, who spends some of his days working with
undergraduates and postgraduates on the structure, grammar, and style of essays
and dissertations, let me apologize for the dire writing found here. The long
sentences, the use of jargon, the frequent density of the style are all faults I
would seek to correct in my own students, and I see no reason not to plead guilty
to the failings of my student self from all those years ago. I have walked softly
through these pages, however, making corrections where necessary, and
improving matters of style only occasionally. Bear all this in mind as you read,
and take pity on the failings of youth that seemed such shining examples of
erudition at the time.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

In the years during which research for the present study was in progress, I
became deeply indebted to numerous organizations and individuals for their
help, advice, and information. Needless to say, there have been too many for me
to list them all here, but it would be unthinkable not to mention here as many as
possible and to ask the rest to accept my grateful thanks for their kindness and
assistance. To my wife Beth, above all others, must go my abiding thanks for
her unfailing support, advice, and encouragement at all stages of this work; in a
very real sense, this dissertation would not have been written but for her. Not
only has she kept my spirits up even when I have most despaired of finishing,
but her help at all stages of the work in reading proofs, suggesting
improvements, and polishing my style has been invaluable, and her patience in
the midst of recurring chaos and disorder quite unflagging.

I must also express my very deep thanks to my supervisor, Professor
Laurence Elwell­Sutton, for so kindly undertaking the supervision of my work at
a remove of several hundred miles and for his patient understanding of my aims
and methods; to the Northern Ireland Department of Education for their
financial support during the first three years of my research; to the trustees of the
E. G. Browne Memorial Fund and the Spalding Trusts for research grants
relative to my visit to Iran in 1977; to the Universal House of Justice for
permitting me to examine materials in the International Bahaʾi Archives in
Haifa in 1976; to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahaʾis of Iran for
permission to use manuscripts in their archives in Tehran; to Mr. Fuʿād Sānaʾī
for his assistance there; to the late Mr. Ḥasan Balyuzi for his advice,
encouragement, and generous loan of materials; to Ḥājī ʿAbd al­Riḍā Khān
Ibrāhīmī (d. 1979) for his exceptional generosity in providing me with the
publications of the Shaykhi community of Kirman and for granting me several
interviews; to Mrs. Fakhr-Tāj Dawlatābādī, Mr. Nūrī Naẓarī, and other Azalī
Babis in Tehran for supplying me with books and information; to Ḥājī Shaykh
ʿAbbūd al-Ṣāliḥī for his information on the Baraghānī family of Qazvīn; to Dr.
Moojan Momen for all our discussions over the years and for letting me make
use of the fruits of his indefatigable researches in the Public Record Office and
elsewhere; to Mr. [now Dr.] Peter Smith for providing ideas and suggestions
over many years and for his help with my sociology (the many errors in which
remain very much my own); to Mr. [now Professor] Abbas Amanat for
invaluable help during the early stages of my work; to Allen Purvis, my wife,
and all the other staff of the manuscript reading room of Cambridge University
Library for their kindness and assistance in coping with my many requests; to
Mr. Wilfred Lockwood of the Oriental Department of Cambridge University
Library for his many recommendations and untiring help in locating elusive

materials; to King’s College, for providing funds to assist in the preparation of
the dissertation; to the Ashraf­Saysānī family of Tehran for their very great
kindness and hospitality during my last stay there, and above all, to the memory
of ʿAlī Ashraf Saysānī, whose death so soon after my return was a blow to us
all.

INTRODUCTION
Recent events have vividly demonstrated the continuing power of religion as a
force to be reckoned with in the life of the Iranian people. Economic
frustrations, social disadvantage, and political oppression may, as always, have
been major spurs goading the masses to revolution, but it was in devotion to
Shiʿi Islam and enthusiasm for the religious leadership (the learned or ʿulamāʾ)
who led them that they found a rallying­point and an effective means of
channeling their demands for change. More than that, religious feelings of
outrage at modernization, moral decline, and loss of religio­national identity,
coupled with the fervor produced in the Shiʿi mind by the themes of martyrdom
and suffering, proved perhaps the most important elements in driving men and
women onto the streets. It is the fundamentally religious character of the Iranian
Revolution which has excited the most comment and caused the most
mystification abroad.

The role of religion as a catalyst in revolutionary movements is well
known,2 not least in Iran, yet it is surprising how many otherwise perceptive
commentators failed, even at the eleventh hour, to appreciate fully how critical a
factor traditional Shiʿism might become among the forces of opposition to the
Pahlavī regime.3 Now that the revolution has taken place—however long it may
survive in a world its leaders seem little fit to cope with—the eyes of scholars
and journalists alike are turned towards Qum and the newly-powerful ranks of
the Shiʿi ulama; but it may be much to hope that sharp vision will replace short­
sightedness overnight and that those unfamiliar with the dynamics of Shiʿi piety
and political messianism will readily grasp the principles and forces involved in
this most medieval of all modern revolutions. Doubtless the secular forces
present throughout this period of upheaval—those most amenable to study by
Western political scientists and commentators—shall be subjected to searching
and competent dissection and analysis, but one may, I think, expect that many
will find it more difficult readily to come to terms with the purely religious
features of the revolution (insofar as these may be genuinely abstracted from the
secular factors).

Guenter Lewy and others4 have argued cogently against a narrow Marxist
or quasi-Marxist interpretation of sectarian and millenarian revolt as
“phenomena of an ongoing class struggle in societies within which the class
conflict has not yet become conscious,”5 maintaining that “medieval heresy in
all its diversity should be treated as genuine religious dissent rather than purely
as a manifestation of the class struggle”6 and that “in the case of millenarian
sentiments and movements, the Marxist thesis is similarly unsupported.”7
Christopher Hill, although himself a Marxist, has similarly stressed the
autonomy of religious and intellectual factors in the English revolution. It is
doubtless this failure to recognize that religious and ideological factors may be
more than a mere superstructure erected on an economically-determined basis

that has led Fred Halliday and others to leave them out of their calculations in
evaluating the modern history of Iran, whatever the value of a Marxist historical
approach in other instances. This is all the more tragic in that Shiʿi Islam
presents the historian and the sociologist with one of the more compelling
examples of a religio­political symbiosis in which religious elements figure with
a degree of autonomy and self-directedness rarely found elsewhere.

This is not to suggest that the role of religion has been ignored in studies
of contemporary and pre-contemporary Iran. The work of Algar, Keddie,
Lambton, and others shows a perfect grasp of the importance of the religious
phenomenon and a keen appreciation of the part it has played since Safavid
times in molding the political and social destiny of the Persian people. As a
basis for comprehending the forces behind recent and, doubtless, future, events
the studies of the above writers are likely to be unsurpassed for some time to
come. In analyzing the nature of relations between church and state on the one
hand and the impact of modernization on the religious classes an their response
to it on the other, they have identified many of the strands of thought and belief
out of which Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his zealots wove their web of
rebellion and revolutionary change.

Yet certain areas remain dim or even dark, whatever the light shed by
recent happenings, not least of which is the question of the relationship in
Shiʿism between charisma and authority and, in particular, the manner in which
charismatic renewal takes place within the context of Shiʿism as an orthodox
system. Closely linked to this question are others such as the role of the ulama
during the period of the Imām’s occultation, the continuance of the messianic
impulse among the Shiʿi masses, and the means whereby orthodoxy and
heterodoxy are distinguished and counterpoised. A careful reading of
Khomeini’s Vilāyat­i faqīh will reveal just how significant these and related
factors are for an understanding of the roots of Shiʿi Islam in the modern world.

Recent developments in Iranian Shiʿism, theoretical and actual alike
compel us to re-evaluate many earlier developments, both for the clarity they
may give to subsequent events and for the opportunity to assess past ideas and
movements anew from the perspective of the present. “It has become
necessary,” writes John Obert Voll, “to reexamine the significance of many
movements in the light of recent events. This has become an activity of special
import. Geoffrey Barraclough has suggested a reason for this: “Today it is
evident that much we have been taught to regard as central is really peripheral
and much that is usually brushed aside as peripheral had in it the seeds of the
future.”8 An excellent case in point is that of Babism and its antecedents. Almost
from its inception the object of curiosity in Europe, the Babi movement drew the
interest of contemporary observers as a potential force for religious and social
change in Iran and, perhaps, elsewhere in the Islamic world. It was, as it were,
the Iranian Revolution of its day. But even by the time of the Comte de
Gobineau (whose Religions et philosophies dans l'Asie centrale, first published

in 1865, popularized the movement throughout Europe), Babism was, in the
political sense at least, a spent force. In 1910, Edward Granville Browne, who
had devoted a considerable part of his career to the study of Babism, and who,
as late as 1893, had expressed the belief that it might “still not improbably prove
an important factor in the history of Western Asia,”9 now conceded that “the
center of interest in Persia has shifted from religion to politics.”10 Babism as a
revolutionary alternative was no longer even a remote possibility and, whatever
relative success it may have had abroad in the form of the Bahaʾi movement, it
has continued to remain far removed from the political and social life of Iran.

As Browne’s fascination for Babism faded, so too did that of other
scholars: before long, the Babi episode had been relegated to a minor place as a
passing convulsion of no long-term importance for the historian. This attitude is
expressed succinctly by Algar, who writes that “Babism was ultimately no more
than a side issue in the Qajar history.”11 This is certainly true in the obvious
sense that the Babi movement was defeated militarily, suppressed, driven
underground, and transformed into a quietist religion seeking converts in the
West. But recent events suggest that, in many ways, Browne’s early enthusiasm
for the Babis was not entirely misplaced. In its later development as a heterodox
sect, its metamorphosis into the Bahaʾi religion claiming a new faith
independent of Islam, its rejection by the majority of Shiʿi Muslims, and its
lasting incapacity to become a powerful force in the land of its birth, Babism
clearly appears as an aberration unrepresentative of contemporary Shiʿism in
Iran. But this obscures the fact that, in its earliest days, Babism was a highly
conservative, orthodox, and even reactionary religious movement (albeit
extreme in certain respects) which emerged from a milieu of Shiʿi pietism
developed in the Shaykhi school. Far from being uncharacteristic of the
mainstream of Shiʿism, the Babi sect—in its early stages at least—displays for
us in exceptionally sharp relief many of the principal features of Shiʿi doctrine
and practice which lie at the very roots of contemporary religious life and
thought in Iran. It is vital to bear in mind that neither Babism nor Shaykhism
was a movement of dissent which sought to be consciously heretical over
against a “corrupt” established church; both Shaykhis and early Babis saw
themselves (as the Shaykhis still do) as pious, devoted, and wholly orthodox
Shiʿi Muslims. They did not reject but were rejected.

Babism is really the last of the great medieval Islamic movements. It is of
unusual importance for us in that it passed through all the major phases of its
development in the period before Western pressures on Iran became too great to
be ignored. Neither Shaykhism nor Babism itself displays the least sign of
having been in any sense a reaction against Western encroachment or the
growing secularization of Iranian society. A fresh look at both movements, then,
may be expected to reveal much that cannot be learnt even from the Tobacco
Rebellion or the 1979 revolution, much that was significant in the Persian
religious mind on the eve of Western involvement.

Whatever the external economic and political forces which molded it,
Babism may be said to represent the last example of an unselfconscious
expression of Shiʿi pietism and messianic revolt untainted, as it were, by the
context of modernism. As a movement which almost succeeded in overthrowing
theQajar dynasty and establishing a new, theocratic state in its place, and as the
only sizeable Shiʿi millenarian movement of the modern period, Babism has for
too long been suffered to linger as something peripheral in the history of post-
Safavid Iran. It is time for it to be returned to its rightful place as one of the most
thought-provoking and controversial movements to arise in the Islamic world in
recent centuries. Perhaps the present study will help re-awaken an awareness
among those concerned with the study of Shiʿism and Iran of the importance of
Babism as an element to be considered in their research.

CHAPTER ONE

THE RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND

The pronouncement of a heresy charge (takfīr) against Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi
from about 1822, and the subsequent rejection of the Shaykhi school—despite
vigorous declarations by its various leaders as to its absolute orthodoxy—by the
mainstream of Twelver Shiʿism, have tended to obscure the originally close
links of Shaykh Aḥmad with the representatives of Shiʿi orthodoxy and the early
development of his school as a major element in the resurgent Shiʿism of the
early Qajar period. Although the French scholar Henry Corbin went to
considerable pains to demonstrate the position of Shaykhism as the latest and,
for him, profoundest development of the metaphysical tradition within Iranian
Islam,12 his emphasis on the theosophical elements of the school and its
association with what has always been at best a suspect yet tolerated strand in
Shiʿi thought has again clouded both the real reasons for al­Ahsaʾi’s
“excommunication” and the place of his thought within the orthodox
development of Shiʿism in the first years of the Qajar restoration. More
seriously, perhaps, Corbin’s attempt to portray the Shaykhi school as a
consistent and homogeneous movement from the time of al­Ahsaʾi to that of
Shaykh ʿAbd al­Riḍāʾ Khān Ibrāhīmī [died 1979, ed.], the last Kirmānī head of
the school, has concealed several important shifts in doctrine and avoided the
problem of changing relationships between the Shaykhi community and the
main body of Shiʿism, as well as the influence of these fluctuations on the
expression of doctrine in the literature of the school.

Not only Shaykh Aḥmad and his successor Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti, but also
Sayyid ʿAlī­Muḥammad Shīrāzī, the Bāb (1819­1850), in many of his early
works, specifically and categorically condemned as unbelievers Ṣūfīs,
philosophers (ḥukamāʾ), “Platonists” (ishrāqiyūn), and others,13 while all three
laid much emphasis on the ‘orthodox’ nature of their doctrines. As we shall see,
the Babis at the inception of the sect were almost as notable for their rigorous
orthodoxy and orthopraxy as they were later to become known for their extreme
heterodoxy. Later writers, concentrating on the “heretical” elements in Shaykhi
and Babi teaching, have lost sight of the powerful bond that existed in both
cases with traditional Twelver Shiʿi teaching, and have failed to explore the
relationship between the Shaykhi and Babi movements on the one hand and
orthodox Shiʿism on the other. The tendency of later writers to ignore or play
down the significance of Shaykhism and Babism has likewise helped draw
attention away from the fact that both movements were an integral feature of the
development of Shiʿism in Iran during the Qajar period, and that the shaping and
exposition of Shaykhi and Babi doctrine owed as much to the general conditions
of the period as did the molding of what was considered as orthodox thinking.

Before attempting to consider Shaykhism and Babism as separate phenomena,
therefore, it will be essential first to survey briefly the religious background
against which they developed.

Although the main area of investigation for our present purposes will be
the developments in Shiʿi thought in Arab Iraq and Iran in the second half of the
eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century, it seems to me both
practical and theoretically sound to begin with a discussion of certain earlier,
more general developments in Shiʿism. To be specific, I propose to reconsider
briefly the religious history of Shiʿism in the period following the “occultation”
of the twelfth Imām in 260/ 872 in terms of charismatic and legal authority and
the routinization of charisma. I intend to make such a reappraisal, not in the
hope of contributing anything original to the discussion of Weberian or post-
Weberian theory (for which I am far from qualified), but to provide a focus for
certain key ideas which, as will be seen, occupy quite prominently the stage of
Shiʿi thought during the period of my main study. The issues of authority,
charisma as invested in specific individuals, the “polar motif”, the role of ijtihād
and the development of fiqh, millenarian expectation, and the relationships
between the Imām, the ulama, and the body of the Shīʿa, are all central to any
discussion of the emergence of Shaykhism and Babism.

Charismatic and Legal Authority in Imāmī Shiʿism

The few writers who have discussed Shiʿism as a charismatic movement have
concentrated on the question of the legitimization of the authority of the Imāms
(varying in number according to the sect in question),14 generally contrasting the
charismatic nature of that authority with the legal authority of Sunnism or the
charismatic nature of the Sunni community. Early Shiʿism is a clear and useful
example of extended hereditary charismatic leadership, and there is certainly
much value in discussing the Imāms as almost classic “bearers” of Weberian
charisma of this type. To restrict ourselves to the period of the Imāms, however,
is to avoid dealing with the much more complex set of issues which centre
around the vital question of how Shiʿism came to terms with the abrupt loss of a
living bearer of absolute charismatic authority on the supposed disappearance of
the twelfth Imām, Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan (b. 868). The initial and fairly typical
response was the attempted “routinization” of the charisma of the Imām in the
persons of four successive individuals: Abū ʿAmr ʿUthmān ibn Saʿīd al­ʿUmarī,
his son Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad al­ʿUmarī (d. 305/ 917), Abū ’l­Qāsim al­
Ḥusayn ibn Rūḥ Nawbakhtī (d. 326/ 937), and Abu ’l­Ḥusayn ʿAlī ibn
Muḥammad al­Samarrī (d. 329/ 941). These are the four “gates” (abwāb),
“representatives” (nuwwāb), or “ambassadors” (sufarāʾ) who communicated
between the Imām and his followers.

It seems, however, that this attempt may have been less original or
systematic than it is represented in retrospect by pious sources: already in the

lifetimes of Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq (702? ­765) and other Imāms, numerous wukalāʾ had
acted on their behalf in various regions.15 Now, simultaneous with the four
abwāb, other nāʾibs appeared in Baghdad and elsewhere, some of whom were
accorded a degree of recognition, while others were rejected by the
community.16 Muḥammad Javād Mashkūr gives the names of six individuals,
including the eminent Ṣūfī martyr al­Ḥusayn ibn Manṣūr al­Ḥallāj ( 858­922)
and Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al­Shalmaghānī (ibn Abī ’l­ʿĀzāqir, d.
933), whom he regards as having been false claimants to the position of nāʾib,
and who were rejected by the majority of Shi‘is.17 For reasons that are not clear,
the innovation of living representatives was abandoned on the death of the
fourth bāb in 940, and no attempt was made to revive it.18

With the abandonment of the system of direct representation, in which
letters allegedly dictated by the Imām were actually written in reply to
questions, charisma could no longer be “transmitted” to (or “focused” on) a
single individual, and it became an urgent concern for the Shīʿa to discover new
ways of legitimizing authority within the community. This legitimization seems
to have taken several distinct forms.

1. Since the doctrine of the necessity of the existence of the Imām or
proof of God (ḥujja) in every age and the impossibility of the earth being
without an Imām was intrinsic to the very raison d’être of Shiʿism, it could not
be abandoned without doing irreparable damage to much of its essence;19 it was,
moreover, an established article of faith that “he who dies without an Imām, it is
as if he has died in the age of ignorance (man māta wa laysa lahu imām māta
mayatan jāhiliyyatan).”20 It was, therefore, propounded (much as it had been in
earlier Shiʿi sects faced with similar problems) that, although the twelfth Imām
was hidden from sight, he remained alive in a state of occultation (ghayba) as
the Imām and Lord of the present age (ṣāḥib al­zamān). Living in an interworld
or barzakh, within but obscured from this world, the Imām could exercise his
function as the maintainer of the equilibrium of the universe and the object of
the active faith of the Shīʿa, with whom he remained in contact through dreams,
visions, and experiential awareness of the mundus archetypus in which he
resided.21

The possibility of encountering the Imām in a visionary state and of
receiving direct guidance from him has played a major part in Shiʿi piety down
to the present day, not only for dreamers and mystics such as those mentioned
by Corbin,22 but for many leading ulama and fuqahāʾ of considerably less
imaginative bent. In 1302/1885, Ḥusayn Taqī al­Nūrī al­Ṭabarsī (ca. 1838­1902)
wrote a work entitled Jannat al-maʾwā, containing fifty­nine accounts of
encounters with the Imām related of numerous individuals, including men like
Muḥammad ibn al­Ḥasan Ḥurr al­ʿĀmilī (1624­1693), al­Ḥasan ibn Yūsuf Ibn
al­Muṭahhar al­Ḥillī (ʿAllāma al­Ḥillī, 1250­1325), Muḥammad ibn Makkī al-
Shahīd al-Awwal (1333­1380), and, in the modern period, Sayyid Muḥammad

Mahdī ibn Murtaḍā Baḥr al­ʿUlūm (1742­1797) and Muḥammad Ḥasan ibn
Bāqir al­Najāfī (1788­1850).23

These meetings would take place in men’s homes as far afield as Bahrain
or Mecca, but most commonly in the Masjid al­Kūfa, the cellar in Sāmarrā’
(where the Imām was supposed to have disappeared), the Shrine of Imām ʿAlī in
Najaf, or the Masjid al­Sahla on the outskirts of Kūfa.24 Side by side, then, with
patently other-worldly meetings in the Jazīrat al-Khadrāʾ or the cities of
Jābarsā and Jābalqā, we find records of the Imām appearing in locations known
and accessible to anyone, some associated with his earthly life, some elsewhere.
It was, for example, widely reputed that “whoever shall go to the Masjid al-
Sahla on forty Wednesdays shall behold the Mahdī.”25 The ghayba al-kubrā is,
in fact, seen as a natural and uncomplicated extension of the earthly existence of
the Imām and his period in the ghayba al-ṣughrā, as is indicated by the fact that
Nūrī Ṭabarsī’s Jannat al-maʾwā has several times been published as an
appendix to the volume of the Biḥār al­anwār dealing with the life and lesser
occultation of the twelfth Imām.26

Remarkably little of the theoretical authority of the Imām can be said to
have dissipated: he was and is alive, not only in the heart of the believer (as, for
example, in certain forms of evangelical Christianity)—not merely in a
supernatural realm accessible to the saint or mystic, but, potentially at least, in
real places, where he has been seen by real persons. At the same time, he is in
occultation, and it is this fact which strengthens his symbolic function.
Charisma, like baraka with which it is closely associated (though not identical),
would seem to be not so much something possessed by the charismatic
individual as conferred on him by others: “people in fact become possessors of
baraka by being treated as possessors of it.”27

It is significant that, in his state of occultation, the Imām appears to
function less as a figure of charismatic authority (which, in real terms, he could
not be) than as a possessor of baraka, for in such a state the subjective focusing
of the faithful becomes dominant in the charismatic relationship. Disappearance
of the charismatic figure may lead to the routinization of his charisma either in
hereditary charisma or charisma of office (giving “charismatic latency”),
whereby “the conception of personal qualities is… undergoing transformation
into a conception of a transmissible, though immaterial power which could light
on the most ordinary personality and give it authority”28—which certainly took
place in the case of the Imāms after the death of the Prophet. The further
disappearance of the bearer of hereditary charisma would normally be expected
to lead either to the evaporation of the group or to a further routinization of the
charismatic authority in a more “church­like” organization.29 While, as we shall
see, something like this did occur, the concept of the living presence of the
Imām and the belief in his return combined to postpone the process of
ecclesiastical routinization.

2. Such a condition could not, however, be considered as indefinite. There
would appear to be a tendency to avoid premature routinization of charisma
(such avoidance is, for example, a marked feature of Babi and Bahaʾi history30)
and one of the most effective means of doing this is to introduce eschatological
and chiliastic themes into the charismatic perspective. That the Imām was alive
presupposed his return as the messianic liberator of his shīʿa, as in the earlier
case of Muḥammad ibn al­Ḥanafiyya (630­700) and others. A body of traditions
now grew up, attributing to Muḥammad and the first eleven Imāms statements to
the effect that there would be a total of twelve Imāms and that the twelfth would
be the Qāʾim and Mahdī.31 Existing traditions relating to the imminent
appearance of the Mahdī seem to have been fused to some extent with later
forgeries rationalizing the fact that the Imāms must now be limited to twelve. In
this way, the cessation of an earthly Imāmate with the twelfth Imām was
justified and linked to what was now his personal eschatological role. In the
same way the Ismailis found elaborate ways in which to rationalize the
limitation of the Imāms to seven, so the Twelvers found equally elaborate means
of demonstrating that the existence of twelve Imāms was, in some sense, part of
the natural order of things, a symbol in the microcosm of a macrocosmic
reality.32

Drawing on existing messianic prophecy relating to the figure of the
Mahdī and on later aḥādīth attributed in Twelver compilations to the Prophet
and first eleven Imāms, Shiʿi scholars elaborated a corpus of traditions, some
vague, some highly explicit and many extremely contradictory, relating to the
future return (rajʿa) of the twelfth Imām before the universal resurrection
(qiyāma) as the restorer of the faith and the mujāhidīn who would lead the final
assault against infidelity.33 Whereas in Sunnism the Mahdī does not appear in
most of the ḥadīth literature, and is essentially a figure of popular piety, he is for
Shiʿism an integral element of orthodox faith whose return is anticipated in the
works of theologians as much as in popular eschatology.

More importantly, where the Mahdī of the Sunnis is merely an
unidentified man descended from the Prophet, the Messiah of the Twelver Shīʿa
is explicitly identified with the twelfth Imām, now in occultation. It is in this that
the baraka and authority of the Hidden Imām are extended indefinitely through
time up to the moment of his reappearance and final victory. Since the Imām in
his role as Qāʾim is as much a figure of charismatic focus as in his earthly or
occult states, the postponement of his return acts in some measure as a brake on
the routinization of charismatic authority. Inasmuch as the Imām—as one who is
preserved (maʿṣūm) from sin (maʿṣiyya), neglectfulness (ṣaḥw), and even
forgetfulness (nisyān),34—is the sole source of infallible guidance and legislative
renewal for the Shīʿa, the promise of his advent rules out the assumption of his
authority to carry out these functions by the ulama or the community acting
through consensus (ijmāʿ).35 The importance of this “messianic motif” for an
understanding of the dynamics of Babism has been stressed by Peter L. Berger,36

and will again be referred to by us in our discussion of the chiliastic current in
the Shaykhi community on the death of Rashti.

3. Meeting with the Imām in sleep or in a visionary state was theoretically
possible for anyone, but, in practice, very few could claim such an experience.
Pilgrimage (ziyāra) could, naturally, still be performed to the shrines of the
Imāms and of Imāmzādas, or to places associated with them, and baraka thus
acquired; but this was clearly no substitute for direct contact with the Imām or
his living representative. Similarly, the Imām might, in theory, return tomorrow,
but the tendency was to argue that his coming would be delayed until the world
had developed and was ready for his parousia.37 In the meantime, if the
community of believers was not to be dispersed and a sense of purpose and
guidance preserved, other, more immediate bearers of the Imām’s charisma had
to be found. In the corpus of Imamite akhbār which grew up rapidly in the
period following the ghayba, we find several traditions which speak of the
appearance of outstanding scholars and saints who will protect the Shiʿi faith
from corruption and act as guides to the truth. In a tradition attributed to
Muḥammad, for example, it is said that “in every generation (khalaf) of my
people, there shall be an upright man (ʿadl) who shall cast out from religion the
corruption (taḥrīf) of the extremists (al­ghālīn) the arrogation of the false and
the interpretation of the ignorant.”38 Imām ʿAlī is recorded as stating in a khuṭba
that

> I know that... You will not leave Your earth without a proof (ḥujja)
> for You to Your creatures, whether outward but unobeyed, or
> fearful and concealed, lest Your proof be made vain or Your holy
> ones be led astray after You have guided them.39

In a similar tradition, ʿAlī prays to God not to leave the earth without “one who
shall arise on behalf of God (qāʾim li ’llāh) with proof.”40 In several traditions
attributed to the Imām Jaʿfar, it is stated that:

> God shall not leave the earth without a scholar (ʿālim) who will
> know what has been increased and what has been decreased in the
> world; should the believers add anything, he shall turn them back
> from it and, should they neglect anything, he shall increase it for
> them.41

On the basis of traditions such as these and the more creative role now
played by them, numbers of individual scholars were able to achieve
considerable renown and to exercise a large amount of charismatic authority as
the de facto leaders and defenders of the faith. As “inheritors” of the mantle of
the Imāms, these individual ulama represent a significant continuation of the
“polar motif” (as derived from the concept of a quṭb or a series of aqṭāb as

centers of charismatic or latent charismatic authority in Islam) so characteristic
of Shiʿism and so vital a feature of Babi and Bahaʾi doctrine in all its stages.42

Some individuals, born at appropriate times, acquired the name of
Renewer (mujaddid) or Promulgator (murawwij) of the faith for their century,
and it is significant to note that, whereas the mujaddids of the first and second
centuries were the Imāms Jaʿfar al­Ṣādiq and ʿAlī al­Riḍāʾ ibn Mūsā
respectively, it was not deemed inappropriate to regard an ʿālim, Muḥammad
ibn Yaʿqūb al­Kulaynī (d. 941?), as the mujaddid of the third century and, after
him, other leading ulama.43 The subsequent history of Twelver Shiʿism is
particularly marked by the emergence of a series of outstanding scholars, for the
most part associated with one or more books on fiqh, uṣūl, ḥadīth, or kalām.44
Whereas the history of Sunnism is closely linked to the fortunes of dynasties and
empires, or that of Catholicism much occupied with papal reigns, councils, and
the founding of religious orders, Shiʿi history, largely divorced from the
mainstream of events in the Islamic world, is an almost unchanging realm
peopled by learned men and their books.

As we shall see, however, it was not until the thirteenth/nineteenth
century that the role of the individual scholar began to take on in practice
something of the charismatic significance with which it had, in theory, been
endowed from the time of the lesser occultation. We shall observe how the
status of mujtahid develops into that of the widely-recognized marjaʿ al­taqlīd
and ayatollah, while in Shaykhism the rukn al­rābiʿ concept comes to offer an
original solution to the problem of charismatic authority within terms of the
polar motif.

4. The doctrinal theories which have, in the past two centuries, permitted
certain individual ulama of exceptional merit or personality to hold almost
universal sway over the Shiʿi world were slow in developing. In the meantime,
traditions such as those quoted above were generally treated together with others
which imbued the body of the ulama as a whole with the authority to transmit
the grace of the Imām. In a tradition attributed to the fifth Imām, Muḥammad al­
Bāqir ibn ʿAlī Zayn al­ʿĀbidīn (d. 731), it is stated that

> God created a remnant of the people of knowledge who summon
> [men] from error to guidance, and who endure afflictions with
> them; they respond to the one who calls to God [i.e., the Imām] and
> themselves summon [others] unto God with understanding;
> preserve them, then... for they possess an exalted station. Their
> sufferings in this world are as a trust: they bring the dead to life
> through the book of God, and they see amidst blindness by the light
> of God. How many slain by the devil have they resurrected, and
> how many an erring wanderer have they guided.45

The role of the ulama during the occultation of the Imām is clearly indicated in a
tradition attributed to the eleventh Imām, Ḥasan al­ʿAskarī:

> Were it not for those of the ulama who shall remain after the
> occultation of your Imām calling [men] unto him, producing
> evidences on his behalf, and striving for his faith with the proofs of
> God, delivering the weak among the servants of God from the
> snares and demons of Satan and from the traps of the wicked, there
> would be no-one who would not abandon the faith of God.46

In a variant of one of the traditions quoted in the previous section, the Prophet is
recorded as stating that “righteous men (ʿudūl) shall bear this religion in every
century, who shall cast out from it the interpretation of the false, the corruption
of the extremists, and the arrogation of the ignorant, just as bellows remove the
dross from the iron.”47

Shiʿi ulama had already begun to emerge during the period of the Imāms,
many of them being their pupils and companions. We may note a number of
Shiʿi Qurʾān commentators (mufassirūn), transmitters of Ḥadīth (muḥaddithūn),
jurisprudents (fuqahāʾ), and, at a slightly later date, theologians (mutakallimūn)
who worked in this period.48 These include Faḍl ibn Shādhān al-Nayshābūrī,49
ʿAlī al­Maythamī (ʿAlī ibn Ismāʿīl ibn al-Maytham al-Tammār),50 and Hishām
ibn al­Ḥakam (d. ca. 815).51 It is clear, however, that individuals such as these
remained very much in the shadow of the Imāms, who were the infallible
sources of guidance in all matters. ʿAbbās Iqbāl writes that “the Imāmiyya
differed from other Islamic sects in that they always had recourse to the
infallible Imām in matters of tafsīr, interpretation of Quranic verses, and the
Sunna of the Prophet.”52

At a period when the role of the Sunni ulama was paramount in the
development of fiqh, ḥadīth, and kalām, the Shīʿa continued to depend primarily
on charismatic guidance for the solution to often complex questions of a rational
nature. The presence of a charismatic figure who is prepared to answer queries
on any issue invariably inhibits the development of independent scholarship.
This may be seen, for example, in the contrast between Catholic and Protestant
theology in the twentieth century, or the absence of serious scholarship in
Bahaʾi circles during the eras of ʿAbbās Afandī ʿAbd al­Bahāʾ (1844?­1921),
his successor Shoghi Effendi Rabbani (d. 1957) and even now under the
“infallible” rule of the Universal House of Justice (Bayt al­ʿAdl­i Aʿẓam).

During the era of the Imāms we do not see the emergence of a distinct
body of Shiʿi ulama, free from the restraints of a living higher authority. Kalām
in particular was much opposed, but the demands of polemic and apologetics
rendered it increasingly necessary; thus, from the time of Jaʿfar al­Ṣādiq, Shiʿi
mutakallimūn began to make a gradual appearance, borrowing initially from the
Muʿtazila, but later diverging strongly from them.53 It is worth noting that many

of the early Shiʿi mutakallimūn were “corrected” in their theories by the Imāms
or their close companions54—clearly, the removal of the Imām or his direct
representative was bound to lead to significant developments, but it was not
until Naṣīr al­Dīn Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al­Ṭūsī (1201­1274) that Shiʿi
kalām reached its maturity.

Later Shiʿi ulama were often divided as to how they should regard these
early theologians particularly in cases like those of Abū ʿĪsā Muḥammad ibn
Hārūn Warrāq (d. 247/ 861)55 and Aḥmad ibn Yahyā Rāwandī (d. 245/ 859),56
whose true relationship with orthodox Shiʿism remains unclear; by and large,
the works of these early writers are not those on which later Shiʿi scholarship
came to be founded. Even in cases where retrospective opinion is favorable to
earlier writers, it is clear that the supposed sense of continuity may be much less
than is thought: “Later Shiʿite writers,” says William Montgomery Watt,
“commonly refer to men like Hishām ibn al-Ḥakam and his contemporaries as
Imāmites, but it is not certain whether they used this name of themselves.”57

Although Shiʿi scholars had taken advantage of periods of relative
tolerance towards the sect, notably under the caliph Maʿmūn (786­833),58 such
intervals were few and their influence limited. The lesser occultation, however,
coincided with the beginning of a period of comparative freedom for the Shīʿa in
many places, under dynasties such as the Samanids, the Hamdanids, and the
Shiʿi Buwayhids, who took Baghdad in 334/945, only five years after the death
of the last of the abwāb al-arbaʿa. The coincidence of freedom from charismatic
restraint and political oppression gave a necessary impetus to the development
of Shiʿi scholarship.

However, in the absence of any fully­fledged, centralized, and stable
Twelver state, the religious authority of the ulama remained scattered in the
various centers of Shiʿi activity, principally in Qum (which became a major
center for religious studies from the time of the Buwayhids),59 Al­Kūfa, Baṣra,
Bahrain, Aleppo, Jabal ʿĀmil, and elsewhere.60 This meant that scholars
preserved a high degree of independence from the demands of functioning
within a wholly Shiʿi context within a single state system, and were free of the
hierarchical demands of a church-like structure which would be imposed by a
centralized body of ulama.

This position was altered radically by the rapid emergence and
consolidation of the Ṣafawī state in the early sixteenth century. “It is,” writes
Hamid Algar, “from the Safavid period onward that one may meaningfully talk
about the existence of a body of Shiʿi ulama.”61 This had at least two major
consequences: on the one hand, it led to the routinization of the inherited
charismatic authority of the ulama in something resembling an ecclesiastical
system in the context of a church-state symbiosis: on the other hand, and as the
dynasty declined, the very large body of ulama who did not accept positions as
state-appointed ecclesiastical functionaries, and who refused to recognize the

legitimacy of the Safavid or any other state became highly popular with and
influential over the Shiʿi masses, particularly in rural areas.

Contrary to Algar’s statement that “no authority in the strict sense of the
term resided in the ulama,”62 it was precisely their ability to claim an inherited
charismatic authority on behalf of the Imām and, importantly, over against the
secular, illegitimate state, which gave and still gives the ulama so much of their
power over the people. Ironically, therefore, the very existence of the Safavid,
Qajar, and Pahlavi states did much to enhance the charismatic authority of the
ulama, providing them with a political role which was clear throughout the
nineteenth century and which is, perhaps, best exemplified in the part played by
the ākhūnds in the overthrow of the Pahlavi regime and their dominant role
within the Islamic Republic.

It has, indeed, been fundamental to the thinking of Ayatollah Khomeini
that the fuqahāʾ be seen as the only legitimate sources of political authority in a
Shiʿi state, inasmuch as they and they alone are the successors (jā-nishīnān;
awṣīyā) of the Prophet and the Imāms.63 As such, they possess the same
authority to rule as the latter:

> This notion that the governing powers of the Prophet were greater
> than those of the Amīr [ʿAlī] or that the governing powers of the
> Amīr were greater than those of the faqīh, is false and mistaken.
> Undoubtedly, the endowments of the Prophet are greater than those
> of all the world, and, after him, those of the Amir are greater than
> all; but abundance of spiritual endowments does not increase
> powers of government. God has granted the same powers and
> guardianship (wilāyat) which were possessed by the Prophet and
> the rest of the Imāms... to the present government [i.e., that of the
> ulama], except that no one individual is specified; there is simply
> the term: “a just scholar (ʿālim ʿādil).”64

This wilāya of the faqīh is established by a firm appointment (naṣṣ) from the
Prophet,65 and in this way, the need for a “guardian of the cause” (walī­yi amr)
at all times is taken care of.66

5. The function of the ulama, like that of individual ʿālims, as bearers of
the charismatic authority of the Imām, lay relatively dormant until the late
eighteenth century. In the intervening period, however, they came to inherit in a
particular sense the charismatic “aura” of the Shiʿi community as a whole.
Watt’s somewhat untypical distinction between the ‘charismatic community’ of
the Sunnis and the “charismatic leader” of the Shīʿa only really holds true for
the very earliest period.67 From a relatively early date, the view developed that
not only the Imāms but their true followers also were specially blessed, guided,
and assured of salvation.68 The charisma of the Shīʿa and its polar motif were
particularly focused on the existence within the community of individuals

known as nuqabāʾ and nujabāʾ.69 A tradition ascribed to the eleventh Imām al­
Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī al­ʿAskarī ( 845­872) states that “we shall send unto them the
best of our shīʿa, such as Salmān, al-Miqdād, Abū Dharr, ʿAmmār, and their
like in the age following them, in every age until the day of ‘resurrection’.”70
This concept came to play an important role in the later version of the Shaykhi
doctrine of the rukn al­rābiʿ, along with that of the ulama as agents of the grace
of the Imām: “the existence of succor (ghawth) shall not suffice in this day
without the pillars (al­arkān), and the pillars cannot exist without the nuqabāʾ
nor the nuqabāʾ without the nujabāʾ nor the nujabāʾ without the ulama.”71

According to this view, the presence of the Hidden Imām is not sufficient
for the needs of men, who require someone visible and tangible to aid them.72
The ulama act as mediators for knowledge from the Imām to the masses (al­
ʿawāmm), while the nujabāʾ mediate for the ulama and the nuqabāʾ for the
nujabāʾ, setting up a hierarchical chain leading from men to God.73 Definition of
the role and nature of the nuqabāʾ and nujabāʾ was to form an important part of
Muḥammad Karīm Khān Kirmānī’s (1810­1872) refutation of the Bab.74

6. All of the above are ways in which Twelver Shiʿism to some extent
routinized the charisma of the Imāms from the third century. This routinization
is, perhaps, most apparent in the creation of a body of ulama from the Safavid
period onward and in the related development of a corpus of authoritative Shiʿi
literature, showing an increasing measure of formalization and organization.
During the lifetime of the Imāms, some four hundred compilations of akhbār,
entitled ʿAṣl, are said to have been drawn up by Shiʿi ulama,75 but it is clear that
the actual presence of an Imām divested these of any real authority.

With the Imām in occultation however, the need to possess authoritative
akhbār became pressing and the “four books”—al­Kulaynī’s al­Kāfī;
Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī Ibn Bābawayh’s (918­991) Man lā yaḥḍuruhu al­faqīh, and
Muḥammad ibn al­Ḥasan al­Ṭūsī’s (995­1067) Al­Istibṣār fi­mā ʾkhtalafa min
al­akhbār and Tahdhīb al­aḥkām—soon came into existence to supply this need.
The production of these collections and others such as the Nahj al­balāgha of
Muḥammad ibn al­Ḥusayn Sharīf al­Radī (969­1016) and Ibn Bābawayh’s
Madīnat al- ilm, as well as the inclusion in them of numerous aḥādīth
manufactured to justify in transcendentalized terms the mundane reality of what
had become Twelver Shiʿism, was both a powerful means of continuing in
theory Imām-centered charismatic authority and of routinizing, systematizing,
and foreclosing the doctrinal and legal options of the Imāmī school.

Other compilations of akhbār continued to appear, but it is significant that
the fullest, most systematic, and, eventually, the most popular of these—
Majlisī’s Biḥār al­anwār—came into being as an expression of the routinization
of religious authority among the ulama during the Safavid period. It is also
relevant for our present thesis to note that two of the later heads of the Shaykhi
school, Muḥammad Karīm Khān Kirmānī and his son Muḥammad Khān
Kirmānī (1846­1906), produced what are, in fact, two of the lengthiest, best­

organized, and most comprehensive collections of akhbār—the Faṣl al­khitāb
and Al­kitāb al­mubīn respectively.

7. The development, reassessment, and systematization of Shiʿi fiqh
continued much longer than in Sunnism, by reason of the doctrine of continuing
ijtihād, and is, in theory at least, an unending process. The relationship of fiqh to
the problem of retaining the authority of the Imām is made clear by Muḥammad
Ḥusayn Muẓaffarī: “After them [the four gates] access to him [the Imām] and
personal acquisition of guidance from him (al-akhdh ʿanhu raʾsan) was
terminated; the derivation of laws (al-aḥkām) was limited to ijtihād.”76 This
close relationship between imāma and ijtihād did not develop immediately,
however—whatever retrospective Shiʿi theorizing may suggest. One of the
earliest works of Shiʿi fiqh is supposed to have been a book written by the
second nāʾib Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad al­ʿAmrī, at the dictation of the Hidden
Imām77—a clear indication of how difficult it was to break away from the
influence of the original source of charismatic authority even in the development
of a new source of legal authority.

The classic Sunni distinction between ʿilm, knowledge of Quranic and
ḥadīth­based legislation, on the one hand, and fiqh, independent rational
development of points of law, on the other, existed in a particularly marked form
in the case of Shiʿism. The Imāms, in particular Jaʿfar al­Ṣādiq, had functioned
as the sole authorities according to whom Shiʿi law was developed, and for
some time Shiʿi fiqh consisted largely of compiling the akhbār collections
referred to above. Al­Kulaynī, Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad Mufīd (d. 1022),
Muḥammad ibn al­Ḥasan al­Ṭūsī (Shaykh al­Tā’ifa, 995­1067), and others
studied and wrote extensively, but the first major works on fiqh were those
produced by Ibn al­Muṭahhar al­Ḥillī, still regarded as the leading authority on
uṣūl.

Al­Ḥillī was also the first Shiʿi faqīh to lay emphasis on the role of ijtihād
as a continuing force for legislative renewal in Shiʿism, although he was not
strictly the earliest to mention it.78 His works have the distinction of being based
firmly on independent research and rational discussion, a point which
Muḥammad Bāqir Khwānsārī makes in contrasting them with those of the later
Muḥammad Bāqir ibn Muḥammad Taqī Majlisī (1627­1699).79 Ibn al­Muṭahhar
al­Ḥillī and his successors laid, as we shall see, a basis which made it possible
for Āqā Muḥammad Bāqir ibn Muḥammad Akmal Bihbahānī (1118-1207/ 1706-
1792), in the middle of the eighteenth century, to establish Uṣūlī fiqh, based on a
strongly­developed sense of the role of ijtihād, as the central bearer of legal
authority within Shiʿism.

Karīm Khān Kirmānī notes that “in these days... the knowledge of fiqh
and the outward form of the sharīʿa… has reached a state of perfection” and that
“the beginning of the appearance and spread of the fiqh and akhbār of the Shīʿa
was at the end of the eleventh century, that is, one thousand one hundred; now
(1268/1851) it is less than two hundred years that these manifest Shiʿi sciences

have been spread in the world. The truth of the matter is that the outward stages
of the holy law reached perfection in the twelfth century, that is, in one thousand
two hundred.”80

We shall observe in a later chapter the relevance of this theory to Shaykhi
concepts of the ages of ẓāhir and bāṭin, “manifest” and “hidden”. Two of
Bihbahānī’s most outstanding successors in the first half of the nineteenth
century—Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥasan al­Najāfi (1788­1850) and Shaykh Jaʿfar
al­Najafī)—produced two of the most important and original works on Shiʿi fiqh
for some time. The former’s Jawāhir al­kalām has been compared to the work
of Ibn al­Muṭahhar al­Ḥillī in respect of its independent and innovative nature.81
Similarly, Mullā Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān Tanakābunī (1819­1892) writes of
the latter’s Kashf al­ghiṭāʾ that “no such book detailing the furūʿ of the faith in
this way had been written until then.”82

This conjunction of legal authority, as seen in the development of fiqh by
the nineteenth century, and charismatic latency, as observed in the efflorescence
of the role of the mujtahid as marjaʿ al­taqlīd by the same period, is an
important feature of the age we are studying and tells us much of the character
of Shiʿism at the time of the development of Shaykhism and Babism.

To summarize, then, we may note that several strands appear to come
together in the first half of the nineteenth century. The ulama, first properly
developed under the Safavids, found themselves regrouped protected, and
increasingly powerful; the position of mujtahid had been defined and stressed
and, as we shall see, the way was open for the appearance of outstanding figures
with unprecedented personal charismatic authority. Legal authority, in the form
of fiqh, had reached the peak of its development, but its expression was still
closely linked to charismatic figures such as Muḥammad Ḥasan ibn Bāqir al­
Najāfi; messianic expectation was on the increase with the proximity of the hijri
year1260, one thousand years after the disappearance of the Imām.

By this time, however, it is obvious that there was growing tension
between these elements. The authority implicit in the exercise of independent
ijtihād did not march happily with that contained in the definitive volumes of
fiqh, nor did the charismatic role of marājiʿ al­taqlīd points of imitation and
final authorities in religious matters harmonize readily with chiliastic hope in the
return of the Imām. However, this tension did clearly represent a major
development of the third and fifth themes discussed above: the existence of
outstanding ulama in every age, and the continued presence of nuqabāʾ and
nujabāʾ in the community. The extreme veneration accorded the most
outstanding ulama conflicted to some extent with the charismatic role of the
religious scholars as a single body, and also with the more diffuse concept of
nuqabāʾ and nujabāʾ within the charismatic Shiʿi ecclesia.

This last tension is particularly marked, as we shall note, in the
contradiction between the visible role of the leaders of Shaykhism, on the one
hand and the doctrine of the “fourth support” as referring to the ulama or to the

nuqabāʾ and nujabāʾ, on the other. It is also apparent in the variety of claims to
charismatic polar authority within Babism, put forward not only by the Bab, but
by large numbers of his followers, particularly in the period after 1850, creating
what Berger calls a “charismatic field.”83 The early nineteenth century can, then,
be described as a period for Shiʿism in which several related issues came to a
head at once, and in which potential charismatic tensions which had remained
unresolved from the time of the lesser occultation came to the surface and shrilly
demanded attention.

The Eighteenth Century Reformation

Of particular importance for this development was the Shiʿi “reformation”
which took place at the shrines in Iraq at about the time Shaykh Aḥmad al­
Ahsaʾi arrived there from Bahrain in the 1790s. What amounted to a revolution
in Shiʿi thinking was being fostered there by several outstanding ulama with
many of whom al­Ahsaʾi came to be associated. This revolution, or reformation,
coinciding with the restoration of a central Shiʿi government in Iran under the
Qajar dynasty, was to set the tone for all subsequent developments in Twelver
Shiʿism, not only at the ʿatabāt (the Shiʿi shrines at Karbala, Najaf, Kāẓimiyya,
and Samarra), but even more in Iran itself. The questions raised in the course of
this reappraisal and reconstitution of Shiʿi theology were all, as we shall see, of
considerable relevance to the claims put forward by the Bab and his early
disciples and explain in large measure the general rejection of Babism by the
main body of Shiʿi Islam. The picture painted of Shiʿism in this period in many
Babi and Bahaʾi histories, as decadent, imitative, and static,84 while not lacking
altogether in validity, is only partial, and fails to take into account the major
developments we have mentioned. Both Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi and Sayyid
Kāẓim Rashti are portrayed in these accounts as far removed from the
mainstream of events in the period, and the question of their relations with other
ulama is either ignored or treated negatively.

The collapse of the Safavid dynasty in 1722 precipitated a major crisis in
Twelver Shiʿism. For some two hundred years, Shiʿi ulama had been
consolidating the position of their branch of Islam as the national religion of
Iran, had been educating the population as a whole in the fundamentals of Shiʿi
belief, and had been attempting to come to terms with the problems of co-
existence between a religious hierarchy in theory obedient only to the Hidden
Imām on the one hand, and a state ruled by a monarch claiming descent from the
seventh Imām and a large measure of divine right to rule on the other.85 But
from 1722 until many years after the Qajar restoration at the end of the
eighteenth century, the political confusion of Iran was to render doubtful the
continued existence of a Shiʿi state in that country. During the interregnum,

however, significant developments occurred in Iraq which determined the nature
of relations between the future Qajar state and the ulama.86

After the overthrow of the Safavids, many of the ulama, fearing for their
lives or their religious freedom under the Sunni Afghans and later under Nādir
Shāh (1688­1747),87 had fled to India and Arab Iraq. The region around
Baghdad where the ʿatabāt were situated was in many respects, ideal as a refuge
for such individuals. A sizeable Persian Shiʿi population had long existed there
especially in Karbala, while the shrines in general attracted Shiʿi pilgrims from
many regions. Najaf in particular became a focus on which scholars from Iran
and elsewhere converged, its more Arab character being considerably changed
and its importance as a center of learning becoming greatly increased as a
result.88 Not only was Arab Iraq situated beyond the vicissitudes convulsing Iran
at this period, but, with the appointment of Ḥasan Pāshā (ruled 1704­1723) as
governor of Baghdad in 1704, an epoch of virtual independence for the region,
under a succession of “Mamlūk” rulers, had begun.89

It has been common to speak of the period between the fall of the
Safavids and the restoration under Āqā Muḥammad Shāh, the first Qajar ruler (r.
1796­1797), as virtually devoid of religious scholars of any real ability. Sayyid
Muḥammad Hāshimī Kirmānī remarks that

> From the later years of the Safavid period, scholarship in Iran was
> extremely limited, as were the circles of theological study; during the
> period of Nādir Shāh and the Zands, the situation continued to decline.
> Several factors, the most important of which was the prevailing

> Afghanistan, Iraq, and India. A very large gathering was assembled, but,
> from the remarks made there, one can see how superficial and banal their
> scholarship had become. Moreover, their names have all come down to
> us, and we do not observe a single outstanding scholar among them.90

According to Abbas Iqbal, “the most famous of the Imāmī ulama during
this interregnum period” were Ismāʿīl ibn Muḥammad Māzandarānī (Khwājūʾī)
(d. 1173/1759), Mullā Muḥammad Rafīʿ Gīlānī, Shaykh Yūsuf ibn Aḥmad al­
Baḥrānī (1106­86/1694­5 – 1772­3) the author of the Ḥadāʾiq and al­Kashkūl),
and Muḥammad Bīdābādī Iṣfahānī (d. 11971782).91 This statement is
reproduced almost exactly by Algar, who adds that only Shaykh Yūsuf al­
Baḥrānī “produced a work that attained any fame—al­Kashkūl.”92 In these few
words, Iqbal and Algar sum up the religious activities of the period of the
interregnum and proceed to a discussion of the achievements of Āqā Bihbahānī.

It seems to me that neither Hāshimī Kirmānī nor Iqbāl offers an adequate
explanation nor a satisfactory picture of the period preceding the early Qajar
reformation. The period in question is overshadowed at one end by the figure of
Muḥammad Bāqir ibn Muḥammad Taqī Majlisī (d. 1111/1699),93 the author of
the voluminous Biḥār al­anwār, a prodigious collection of akhbār, and the most
influential of the late Safavid divines dominating the court of Shah Ḥusayn I
(1668­1726); and at the other by that of Muḥammad Bāqir ibn Muḥammad
Bihbahānī (d.1206/1791­2), regarded as the Renewer or mujaddid of the
thirteenth hijri century. Khwānsārī, for example, speaks of “the period of the
absence of the ulama (zamān fiṭrat al-ʿulamāʾ)” between Majlisī and
Bihbahānī.94

It is easy to forget, however, that the influence of Majlisī, of several of his
immediate predecessors, and some of the more eminent ulama among his
contemporaries persisted well after the fall of the Safavids, and that the
achievements of Bihbahānī had their roots in developments over the previous
century or more. Among those predecessors we may number men such as
Muḥammad ibn al­Ḥasan Hurr al­ʿĀmilī (1624­1693),95 Muḥammad ibn
Murtadā Fayd al­Kāshānī (Muḥammad Ḥasan Mūsavī Kāshānī) (1598­1680),96
Qādī Sa‘īd Qummī (1639­1691),97 and Ḥusayn ibn Muḥammad Khuwānsārī
(1607­1686?).98 Majlisī’s contemporaries included Niʿmat Allāh ibn ʿAbd Allāh
Jazāʾirī (1640­1701).99

Even if the general standard of the ulama was necessarily poor, there are
several individuals, apart from those mentioned by Iqbāl, who held positions of
some eminence in this period The most outstanding of these was Muḥammad
ibn Ḥasan Fādil al­Hindī (1651­1724), the author of the Kashf al­lithām.100
Others included Sayyid Ṣadr al­Dīn ibn Muḥammad Bāqir Raḍāwī Qummī (d.
1803);101 a son of Niʿmat Allāh ibn ʿAbd Allāh al­Jazāʾirī (1640­1701), Nūr al­
Dīn ibn Niʿmat Allāh al­Jazāʾirī (1677­1745), who had studied under al­Ḥasan
Ḥurr al­ʿĀmilī;102 a son of Nūr al­Dīn al­Jazāʾirī, Sayyid ʿAbd Allāh Shūstarī
(1702­1759);103 Sayyid Murtaḍā ibn Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabā’ī (d. 1793), the father
of Muḥammad Mahdī ibn Murtaḍā Baḥr al­ʿUlūm (1742­1797);104 Muḥammad
Bāqir ibn Muḥammad Bihbahānī, the father and teacher of Āqā Bihbahānī;105
Shaykh Abū Ṣālih Muḥammad Mahdī Fatūnī al­ʿĀmilī,106 and Shaykh
Muḥammad Taqī Darūqī al­Najāfi,107 both teachers of Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, Shaykh
Jaʿfar al­Najāfi and many others; and Shaykh Muḥammad Bāqir Hizārjarībī
Najāfi (d. 1790), a teacher of Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najāfī and Abū
‘l­Qāsim Qummī.108 Men such as these, some in Iran and others at the ‘atabāt,109
if not themselves ulama of the first grade, nevertheless set the stage for the
entrance of figures such as Āqā Bihbahānī, Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­
Najāfī, Sayyid ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabāʾī ʿAlī Iṣfahānī (1748­1815),
Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad Ibrāhīm Kalbāsī (1831­1897) and Shaykh Aḥmad
al­Ahsaʾi . The strength of the continuing tradition of Shiʿi scholarship over the
interregnum is clearly demonstrated in the fact that most of the ulama from

whom Shaykh Aḥmad received licences to teach (ijāzāt) had studied under
Yūsuf ibn Aḥmad al­Baḥrānī110 – a fact which also shows the degree of al­
Ahsaʾi’s indebtedness to that tradition.

Three major factors contributed to the development of Shiʿi thought in the
interregnum, the problems raised being resolved finally by Āqā Bihbahānī and
his contemporaries. These factors were: the challenge presented by the religious
policies of Nādir Shāh, the reinterpretation of the role of the ulama in the
absence of a Shiʿi state (and during the continued occultation of the Imām), and
the struggle for supremacy between the Akhbārī and Uṣūlī schools of thought.

The most serious threat posed to the continuation of Shiʿism in Iran by Nādir
Shāh—apart from his direct physical and economic attacks on the ulama
class111—was his aim to unite the Shiʿi sect to Sunnism through the ingenious
expedient of so modifying Shiʿism as to have it regarded as a fifth “Jaʿfarī”
madhhab within the Sunni structure. As we shall see when we come to consider
the question in more detail later, the most disturbing aspect of this proposal as
far as the Shiʿi ulama were concerned was the implication that, by placing
Shiʿism side by side with the four existing Sunni law schools, it would have to
share with them a much more limited role for ijtihād,112 with the Imām Jaʿfar al­
Ṣādiq the Shiʿi equivalent of the founders of the fourth Sunni schools of law.
Not only would this have denied to the Imāms after Jaʿfar their traditional role
as sources of continued divine guidance, thereby removing the central feature of
Twelver Shiʿism, but it would have all but dispensed with the role of the Shiʿi
mujtahid as a source of legislative renewal (in theory, at least) during the
occultation of the Imām.113 As we shall see, this latter possibility was a
particularly disturbing threat at this point.

The question of the relationship between church and state in Shiʿi theory
and practice has attracted much attention and been discussed at length
elsewhere;114 there is no need to do more here than summarize the situation
insofar as it affected the ulama following the collapse of the Safavid dynasty.
For centuries before the establishment of the Safavid state, Ithnāʾ­ʿasharī
Shiʿism had persisted as a minority sect for which all secular authority –
Umayyad, Abbasid, or otherwise—was illegitimate. This very sense of
illegitimacy lay at the root of Shiʿi belief, and led it inevitably to a sense of the
illegitimacy of any state whatever.115 “In contrast with the Sunni ulama,” writes
Keddie, “who had to work out their doctrine under the rule of a government that
claimed political sovereignty, the Shiʿis lacked political protectors, which for
centuries weakened their real power, but also enabled them in theory to deny the
sovereign claims of any state.”116

The peculiar manner in which the Safavid regime was created had meant
that, when a religious hierarchy finally developed, it had to come to terms with
an existing secular state which had brought it into being, which sought to foster
it (albeit it in an inferior role to the secular hierarchy), and which claimed a

legitimacy based in part on religious considerations. The early Safavid ulama
seem to have been content to accept the role forced on them by a state which
held in its hands effective power over both secular and religious affairs. Initially,
it would seem, the fact that a Shiʿi monarch sat on the throne precluded any
question of illegitimacy in the rule of the state. The doctrinal theory which
denied legitimacy to secular rulers had been developed originally against the
Sunni ‘usurpers’ of the caliphate, and it was some time before the ulama began
openly to infer from that theory that the rule of a Shiʿi monarch must equally
involve the usurpation of the function of the Imām as the divinely-appointed
head of the Islamic umma.117 As the power of the Safavid state declined,
however, that of the ulama increased, and, towards the end of the seventeenth
century, it was being claimed openly that not only was the rule of the shah
illegal, but that, in the absence of the Imām, true authority lay with the
mujtahids as his representatives.118

Although the collapse of Safavid rule and the ensuing anarchy caused
much harm to the ulama, this was little more than a physical and economic
setback. Sequestered in the comparative safety of the ʿatabāt, or in various
enclaves in an Iran conspicuously deprived of effective centralized government,
the ulama could well regard themselves as the remaining representatives of the
vanished Shiʿi state, and could now give free rein to speculation on the role of
the mujtahid class, whether in the perpetual absence of a Twelver Shiʿi state, or
in whatever new order came to fill the vacuum left by the disappearance of the
Safavids.

The Akhbari­Usuli Split

The resulting debate took the form of a final clash between the Akhbari and
Usuli (or Mujtahidī) schools of thought, and culminated in the victory of the
latter party on the eve of the Qajar restoration. Since this debate and its
consequences have a considerable bearing on the interpretation of Shaykh
Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi’s role among the early Qajar ulama, it will be worthwhile to
touch on the major aspects of the controversy.

The origins of the debate are somewhat obscure. Later Shiʿi writers
normally regard the Akhbaris as innovators first appearing in the 17th century
with the emergence of Muḥammad Amīn ibn Muḥammad Sharif Astarābādī
(d.1623). It is more probable, however, that the appearance of an Akhbari school
at this date is more a reflection of the growing power of the mujtahids and the
early development of what came to be identified as the Usuli position. The
doctrine of the role of the mujtahid as the interpreter of the will of the Imām “is
apparently a late one that has no basis in early Twelver theory,”119 and it seems
likely that the Akhbari party was less innovatory than conservative, the true

respective positions of the two schools becoming distorted after the victory of
the Usulis.

That the Akhbaris represented a purer and more primitive line of thought
within Shiʿism clearly seems to have been the belief of Mullā Muḥammad Amīn
Astarābādī, regarded as “the first to open the door of reviling against the
mujtahids”120 and as “the leader of the sect of Akhbaris.”121 A Persian work of
his, the Dānish­nāma­yi shāhī,122 seeks to demonstrate that the Ijtihādī (Usuli)
school was an innovation which had not existed before the time of Muḥammad
ibn Yaʿqūb al­Kulaynī.123 “Up to the latter period of the lesser occultation,
people followed the Akhbari school.”124 Muḥammad Amīn saw his own role as
that of restoring the Akhbari teachings to their former position of dominance
within Shiʿism.

He himself had studied initially under two of the leading Shiʿi scholars of
his day, Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al­ʿĀmilī (1539­1600)125 the author of an
important work entitled the Madārik al­aḥkām,126 and Shaykh Jamāl al­Dīn Abū
Manṣūr Ḥasan al­ʿĀmilī) (1551­1602),127 the author of the Maʿālim al­dīn wa­
malādh al­mujtahidīn 128 and a son of Shaykh Zayn al­Dīn ibn ʿAlī al­Shahīd al­
Thānī (1506­1558). He later lived in Mecca and Medina, and studied during this
period under Mullā Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī Astarābādī (d. 1028/1619).129 It was
this man who encouraged Muḥammad Amīn to ‘revive’ the Akhbari school. The
latter writes in his Danish-nāma: “After he [Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī] had instructed
me in all the traditions, he indicated that I should revive the school of the
Akhbaris and should remove the doubts that were opposed to that school. ‘I have
intended to do this,’ he said, ‘but God has decreed that your pen take up this
subject.’”130 Muḥammad Amīn undertook the composition of his most important
work, al­Fawāʾīd al-madaniyya fī raddi man qāla bi ’l­ijtihād,131 as a direct
attack on the theory of independent reasoning then current in Shiʿi thought. He
himself states that the work was well received,132 a fact confirmed by
Muḥammad Taqī ibn Maqṣūd ʿAlī Majlisī (1594­1659), the father of
Muḥammad Bāqir in his Lavāmiʿ­i ṣāḥib­qirānī,133 when he writes:

> About thirty years ago, the erudite scholar Mullā Muḥammad Amīn
> Astarābādī busied himself with comparing and studying the traditions of
> the blessed Imāms, turned his attention to the condemnation of decisions
> reached by speculation and analogy (ārāʾ wa maqāyis), and understood
> the path of the companions of the Imāms. He wrote the Fawāʾiḍ­i
> madaniyya [sic] and sent it to this country. Most of the people of Najaf
> and the ʿatabāt approved of his thinking (ṭarīqat) and began to refer to the
> traditions (akhbār) as their sources. In truth, most of what Mullā
> Muḥammad Amīn has said is true.134

In the Fawāʾīḍ al-madaniyya, Astarābādī argues that the first individuals
to abandon the path followed by the companions of the Imāms and to rely on the

art of theological discussion (kalām) and the juridical principles (uṣūl al­fiqh)
based on rational arguments as common among Sunnis (al­ʿāmma) were, as far
as I know, Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad al-Junayd, who acted on the basis of analogy
(qiyās) and Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī ibn Abī ʿAqīl al­ʿUmanī the mutakallim.135

He goes on to say that, when al-Shaykh al­Mufīd (d. 413/ 1022)136

expressed his views on the worth of these two men to his own pupils, these ideas
continued to spread over a long period until the time of the foremost Shiʿi
authority on uṣūl, al­ʿAllāma al­Ḥillī,137 who emphasized them in his writings.
Astarābādī brings the development of Usuli thought down to his own time
through Muḥammad ibn Makkī al­ʿĀmilī al­Shahīd al­Awwal ( 731­86/ 1333­
84),138 Shaykh ʿAlī (presumably ʿAlī ibn ʿAbd al­ʿAlī al­ʿĀmilī, al­Muḥaqqiq
al­Thānī ( c.870­940/ 1465­1533),139 Zayn al­Dīn ibn ʿAlī al­ʿĀmilī al­Shahīd
al­Thānī (d. 966/ 1558),140 his son, and the teacher of Astarābādī, Shaykh
Jamāl al­Dīn Abū Manṣūr al­ʿĀmilī and, finally, his own contemporary Bahāʾ
al-Dīn Muḥammad al­ʿĀmilī (d. 1030/ 1620), better known Shaykh Bahāʾī.141

The fundamentalist nature of Astarābādī’s thought is evident from the
foregoing. Not only was he opposed to the practice of ijtihād as current in his
day, but he retrospectively criticized several of the leading figures in Shiʿi
theology in the period following the occultation of the Imām.142 Surprisingly
enough, however, Astarābādī’s views, as we have seen, were at first well
received, and in succeeding years several important scholars adopted, in varying
degrees, the ideas he had put forward. Among these were Shaykh Muḥammad
ibn al­Ḥasan al­Ḥurr al­ʿĀmilī, one of the “three Muḥammads of the modern
period and the author of several important works, including the influential
Waṣāʾil al shīʿa ilā taḥsīl masāʾil al­sharīʿa and the Amal al­āmil;143 Mullā
Muḥsin Fayḍ Kāshānī (1598­1680), another of the “three Muḥammads” of later
Shiʿism, a student and son-in­law of Mullā Ṣadrā (d. 1641), and one of the most
eminent of the Safavid philosophers; 144 Qāḍī Saʿīd Qummī (d. 1103/ 1691) a
philosopher of some note who also achieved recognition as a faqīh;145 Sayyid
Nīʿmat Allāh al­Jazāʾirī (1640­1701), the leading contemporary of Muḥammad
Bāqir Majlisī;146 and Mīrzā Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al­Nabī Nīshāpūrī Akhbārī (b.
1178/1765), the last and, perhaps, the most intransigent of the Akhbari
controversialists, best known for his involvement with the incident of the
“Inspector’s head” during the reign of Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh (r.1797­1834).147 A
number of other important ulama, if not totally committed Akhbaris, tried to
walk a medial path between the Usuli and Akhbari positions. These included
Shaykh Yūsuf al­Baḥrānī148 and Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh ibn Nūr al-Dīn al-Jazāʾirī
(1701­59).149

For a considerable time, the Akhbari teachings enjoyed a respectability
and influence later obscured by the victory of the Usulis. There is no space here
to enter in into a detailed discussion of what these teachings were: in his Minyat
al­mumārisīn, Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh ibn Ṣālih al­Samāhijī al-Baḥrānī (d.
1135/1722-3), an Akhbari ʿālim of some distinction,150 1ists forty points of

disagreement between the Akhbari and Usuli schools,151 a clear indication of
how, towards the end of the Safavid era, Astarābādī’s comparatively simple
objections to the use of ijtihād had become elaborated to the point where,
instead of two slightly diverging schools of thought co-existing peacefully
within the body of Twelver Shiʿism, the Akhbari and Usuli positions had
become mutually antagonistic on a large number of issues, many of them very
unimportant, even factitious—a pattern which was to be repeated in the
Shaykhi­Bālāsārī dispute.

For our present purposes, it will suffice to note a few more important
elements in the Akhbari­Usuli debate which have a bearing on the developments
with which we are primarily concerned. The Minyat al-mumārisīn mentions the
following areas of disagreement of interest to us:

1. the Usulis accept ijtihād, but the Akhbaris accept only what is related
by the Imāms; 2. the Usulis have four sources of authority, namely the Qurʾan,
Sunna, ijmāʿ, and ʿaql whereas the Akhbaris accept only the first two of these,
some even rejecting all but the first; 3. the Usulis divide mankind into two
groups, muqallid (an imitator) and mujtahid (one empowered to use independent
reasoning), while the Akhbaris hold that all are muqallid to the Imām; 4. the
Usulis say that ijtihād is obligatory in the period of occultation and that direct
derivation is possible only in the Imam’s presence, but the Akhbaris make it
obligatory to go to him even if through an intermediary; 5. the Usulis only
permit fatwās through ijtihād, but the Akhbaris permit them if there is a
(relevant) tradition from an Imām; 6. the Usulis say that a perfect mujtahid
(mujtahid muṭlaq) is learned in all religious ordinances through the strength of
his intellect, whereas the Akhbaris maintain that only the Imām is informed of
all religious ordinances; 7. the Usulis forbid taqlīd to a deceased marjaʿ, while
the Akhbaris permit it; 8. the Usulis say that the mujtahid must be obeyed as
much as the Imām, whereas the Akhbaris reject this.152

It is worth noting at this stage that several of the Akhbari doctrines listed
here, particularly those relating to the overriding position of the Imāms, bear a
significant resemblance to many of the views of Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi which
formed the basis for the doctrine of the Shaykhi school.

The collapse of Safavid power appears initially to have meant an increase
in influence for the Akhbari party, despite the advances made by the Usulis in
the late seventeenth century. The reason for this development is probably very
simple: the Usuli/mujtahidī party had been elaborating its position in the context
of a Shiʿi state in which the role of ijtihād vis­à­vis the secular powers was
progressing satisfactorily, particularly in the reign of Ḥusayn I (1668­1726). The
removal of a Shiʿi government created a need to revise the role of ijtihād. The
Akhbari position, however, needed little or no reappraisal. The existence or
absence of a Shiʿi state had small bearing on a system which depended solely on
the Qurʾan, aḥādīth, or the Imāms for guidance in all affairs, and which
accorded to no contemporary authority the right to apply ijtihād in either the

private or the public sphere. For some time after the Safavid collapse, indeed the
Akhbaris clearly offered a more viable system in the absence of a centralized
government and a state-fostered religious hierarchy. Until the mujtahids found a
way to reinterpret and reassert their position, the ulama at the ʿatabāt were
dominated by the Akhbari school.153

The Usuli revival which led to the final reversal in the position of the two
schools was the result of a process which, as we have indicated, went on
throughout the interregnum. However, the Usulis owed their eventual victory to
one man above all others: Muḥammad Bāqir ibn Muḥammad Akmal, Vaḥīd­i
Bihbahānī, (1118-1207/ 1706-1792).154

Bihbahānī was born in Isfahan, spent his childhood in Bihbahān, and later went
to Karbala. He studied at first under his father, Shaykh Muḥammad Akmal,155
and later with other teachers, including Mullā Ṣadru’d-Dīn Tūnī,156 whose
daughter he married; Shaykh Yūsuf al-Baḥrānī;157 and Sayyid Muḥammad
Burujirdī.158 Through his ijāzas from his father and Mullā Ṣadr al­Dīn Tūnī,
Bihbahānī possessed a chain of riwāya going back to Muḥammad Bāqir ibn
Muḥammad Taqī Majlisī and, like many other ulama of this period, was himself
descended from the Majlisī family159—both indications of the continuity which
existed between the later Safavid divines and those of the post-Safavid era.

Vaḥīd­i Bihbahānī was, in many ways, the outstanding link between the
late Safavid and early Qajar periods. Referring to his pupils, Muḥammad ʿAlī
Muʿallim Ḥabībābādī states that “if we did not possess the link of their
transmission (riwāya) from him; and, if his chain (silsila) of transmission and
one or two other chains apart from his did not go back to ʿAllāma Majlisī and
certain others in the twelfth [Isalamic] century, there might have been a break in
the chain of transmission of the Shiʿi ulama during that troubled interval
(fiṭrat).”160 Bihbahānī’s central position in the transmission of authority is
abundantly clear from the ijāzāt of many modern ulama such as the late
Muḥammad Muhsin Āghā Buzurg al­Ṭihrānī (1875­1970), whose isnād is as
follows: from ʿAllāma Mīrzā Ḥusayn Nūrī (1254-1320/1839-1902), from
Murtaḍā ibn Muḥammad Amīn Anṣārī (Shaykh Murtaḍā Ansārī (1214-
1281/1800-1865), from Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Mahdī Nirāqī (1771­1828),
from Sayyid Mahdī Baḥr al­ʿUlūm (1155-1022/1742­1797), from Bihbahānī ,
from his father Shaykh Muḥammad Akmal, from ʿAllāma Majlisī.161

Going in the opposite direction, we note that many of the eminent ulama
of the early thirteenth century hijri were numbered among Bihbahānī’s pupils.
Muḥammad ʿAlī Muʿallim Ḥabībābādī lists no fewer than forty ulama of some
note who studied under him.162 Of those mentioned, the following seem to the
present writer to be of most importance: Bihbahānī’s son­in­law Āqā Sayyid
ʿAlī Ṭabāṭabāʾī Iṣfahānī;163 his sons Āqā Muḥammad ʿAlī Bihbahānī (d. ca.
1207/1792) 164 and Āqā ʿAbd al-Ḥusayn Bihbahānī ;165 Āqā Sayyid Muḥammad
Mahdī Ṭabāṭabāʾī Baḥr al­ʿUlūm;166 Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najāfī;167 Shaykh Asad

Allah Dizfūlī Kāẓimaynī;168 Āqā Sayyid Muḥsin al-Aʿrajī al-Kāẓimaynī;169

Mīrzā Abū ‘l­Qāsim Qummī (Mīrzā-yi Qummī);170 Mīrzā Muḥammad Mahdī
Nirāqī;171 his son, Ḥājj Mullā Aḥmad Nirāqī;172 Mīrzā Yūsuf Mujtahid
Tabrizī;173 Muḥammad Mahdī Kāẓimī (b. 1901), known as Sayyid Mīrzā
Muḥammad Mahdī Iṣfahānī, Shahīd­i Rābiʿ);174 Hājī Muḥammad Ibrāhīm
Kalbāsī;175 and Sayyid ʿAbd Allāh Shubbar al-Kāẓimī.176

Lest a false impression be given, it is necessary to stress that the
individuals named here and others of Bihbahānī’s students do not form a single
group of scholars working under one man. They have in common the fact that
they all studied, for varying lengths of time, under the most outstanding figure
of the period, some like Mīrzā Muḥammad Mahdī Baḥr al­ʿUlūm and Mullā
Abd al­Ṣamad Hamadānī,177 were associated with Bihbahānī for many years,
while others attended his classes for only a short time.

Several of the older students of Bihbahānī (such as Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, Sayyid
ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabā’ī ʿAlī Iṣfahānī and Muḥammad Mahdī Nirāqī)
had studied under Shaykh Yūsuf al-Baḥrānī, and some (Bahr al­‘Ulūm, Sayyid
Muḥammad Mahdī Isfahānī, Abū ’l­Qāsim Qummī, and Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najāfī)
under Shaykh Muḥammad Mahdī Fatūnī, and thus themselves had direct links
with the late Safavid period.

Younger individuals studied under these men as well as Bihbahānī; thus,
for example, Shaykh Asad Allāh Kāẓimaynī was taught by Sayyid ʿAlī ibn
Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabāʾī, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najāfī, Mīrzā Abū ’l­Qāsim Qummī,
Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, and Mīrzā Muḥammad Mahdī Shahristānī,178 while Ḥājī
Muḥammad Ibrāhīm Kalbāsī studied under Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­
Najāfī, and Sayyid ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabāʾī.

At the same time, it was not uncommon for individuals to teach a
particular book or subject to one of their contemporaries or even to individuals
older than themselves. Thus, for example, Baḥr al­ʿUlūm included among his
pupils Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najāfī, Sayyid Muḥsin al-Aʿraji, Āqā Sayyid
Muḥammad Shubbar, and Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi , while he himself studied
falsafa under Mīrzā Muḥammad Mahdī Iṣfahānī. Sayyid ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad
Ṭabāṭabā’ī was sent to join the classes of pupils much older than himself.179

The centralization of Shiʿi scholarship at the ʿatabāt resulted in the
weaving of a complex web of master-pupil relationships, in which generations
and individuals repeatedly overlapped. Where the Safavid and earlier periods
had seen a relative scattering of Shiʿi learning through Iran, Arab Iraq, and the
Bahrain and Jabal ʿĀmil regions, the second half of the eighteenth century
witnessed a high degree of concentration of scholars in a central location to
which students headed in growing numbers, and from which some left as well
qualified ulama to teach in Iran, India, and elsewhere. Before proceeding to
consider the developments which followed him, let us return for a moment to
evaluate the impact of Āqā­yi Bihbahānī himself on the Shiʿi world of his
period.

The Impact of Āqā­yi Bihbihānī

Bihbahānī’s great achievement was twofold. On the one hand, he destroyed the
influence of the Akhbaris at the ʿatabāt: “Before him,” writes Mullā
Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān Tanakābunī, “the Akhbaris were in ascendancy and
were extremely numerous, but he uprooted them.”180 His Risālat al­ijtihād wa ’l­
akhbār remains the most important and influential treatment of the arguments
used to invalidate the Akhbari position and to justify that of the Usulis. On the
other hand, he redefined the nature of ijtihād, established the role of the
mujtahid, and laid the basis for a system of fiqh which has been in use in
Twelver Shiʿism ever since.181 “He reformed and refashioned the bases of
jurisprudence (uṣūl al­fiqh), writes Muḥammad ʿAlī Muʿallim Ḥabībābādī, “in a
fresh and delightful manner and, by reason of his new insights into the areas of
debate in the subject, provided a forceful and impressive impetus to its
development.”182 As a result of this formidable achievement, Bihbahānī came to
be regarded as the mujaddid or murawwij of the thirteenth century hijri.183 That
this was recognized by his contemporaries is amply testified by Sayyid ʿAlī ibn
Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabāʾī in his ijāza to Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi , where he
refers to Bihbahānī as “the Founder [muʾassis] of the nation of the Prince of
mankind at the beginning of the thirteenth century.”184

The reformation inspired by Bihbahānī was fraught with serious
consequences for Twelver Shiʿism. Before he launched his offensive against the
Akhbaris, relations between them and the Usulis had not resulted in serious
animosity, much less in outright condemnation of one side by the other for
heresy. By pronouncing a sentence of takfīr against the Akhbaris, Bihbahānī set
a dangerous precedent which was soon to be used against Shaykh Aḥmad al­
Ahsaʾi and his followers. From the time of Bihbahānī, Shiʿi orthodoxy became
more sharply defined than ever before, and the threat of takfīr came into use as
the ultimate weapon against ideas and individuals likely to challenge the
orthodox system or its exponents. It is, above all, a token of the routinization
into a church form which was taking place in Shiʿism at this time.

During the early Safavid period, heterodox and semi-heterodox groups
had been to some extent integrated within the rather amorphous form of Shiʿism
promoted by Shah Ismā’īl I (1487­1524).185 The situation soon changed with
regard to the theological extremists (ghulāt) and the Ṣūfīs, but, in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, the existence of philosopher theologians such as
Shaykh Bahaʾi, Mullā Ṣadrā, Mīr Dāmād (Muḥammad Bāqir ibn Muḥammad
Dāmād (d. 1040/1631), and Mullā Muḥammad ibn Murtaḍā Muhsin Fayḍ­i
Kāshānī (d. 1091/1680) indicated that orthodox Shiʿism could embrace a wide
range of views.186 The growth in the power of the mujtahids in the Safavid
epoch culminated in the person of Mullā Muḥammad Bāqir Majlisī, whose

fanaticism was legendary. But even he praised Mullā Muḥammad Amīn
Astarābādī in his Biḥār al­anwār.187

In the period of the interregnum, however, the Usulis grasped an
opportunity to develop—given the absence of a central government—the theory
of the mujtahid as a living source of charismatic authority in the period of
ghayba. By refusing to recognize this authority, the Akhbaris presented a serious
obstacle to the complete domination of the Shiʿi world and mind by the Usuli
school or—more precisely—by its representatives; what had been a relatively
polite theological disagreement intensified rapidly into a struggle for mastery
over the development of post-Safavid Shiʿism in its entirety. It was inevitable
that the Usulis would win the struggle. The power vacuum created by the
Afghan invasion had brought into existence a psychological need among the
Shiʿi population for stability and authority, and this is precisely what the Usuli
party offered.

The Usuli victory had many consequences, but one in particular is of
considerable importance in helping us understand the reaction of the mass of
ulama to Shaykhism and Babism, and, indeed, their very emergence in the first
place. This is that taqlīd or taking guidance in religious matters, limited by the
Akhbaris to the Imāms,188 was applied by the Usulis to the mujtahid. As the
mujtahids grew in power, so the role of the marjaʿ al­taqlīd increased in
importance, not only as a source of charismatic authority, along the lines
suggested earlier in this chapter, but increasingly as a source of unity for the
Shiʿi population.

Some modern authorities have adopted a practice of identifying certain
leading ulama between al­Kulaynī and the modern period as outstanding marājiʿ
al­taqlīd. Thus, for example, ʿAbd al­Hādī Ḥāʾirī, citing a monograph by Āqā
Muḥammad Vakīlī Qummī, refers to no less than fifty-eight mujtahids between
al­Kulaynī and Ayatollah Ḥusayn al­Ṭabāṭabāʾī Burujirdī (1875­1961) as having
been “recognized as great marājiʿ al­taqlīd.”189 Ḥusayn Khurāsānī, however,
gives the names of only twenty-four marājiʿ from al­Kulaynī to (Ayatollah)
Sayyid Āqā Ḥusayn ibn Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabāʾī Qummī Ḥā’irī (1282­
1366/1865­1947).190 This would, nevertheless, appear to be a highly innovatory
practice which obscures the fact that the concept of marjaʿiyya seems only to
have been clearly defined from the mid­nineteenth century. There is general
agreement, however, that the theory of the role of the marjaʿ as, ideally, a single
individual universally recognized, was first embodied in the person of
Muḥammad Ḥasan ibn Bāqir Najafī (c. 1202-1266/1788-1850), the author of the
celebrated work on fiqh known as the Jawāhir al-kalām.191

Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥasan had studied for the most part under students of
Bihbahānī , including men such as Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī and his son Shaykh
Mūsā ibn Jaʿfar Āl Kāshif al­Ghiṭā (1180–1243/1766­1827), and held an ijāza
from Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi . Khwānsārī states that

none has been seen like him to this day in the elaboration of
> questions, nor have any beheld his like in the division of unusual
> elements of the law by means of various proofs; no-one has dealt
> with the classifications of fiqh so fully as he, nor has anyone
> systematized the rules of uṣūl as he has nor has any mujtahid before
> him so consolidated the elements of ratiocination. How might it be
> otherwise when he has written a book on the fiqh of this school
> from beginning to end, known as the Jawāhir al-aḥkām [sic].192

He goes on to say that “the leadership of the Shiʿis, both Arabs and Persians in
this age, fell to him.”193 A measure of the influence enjoyed by Shaykh Jaʿfar
al­Najafī is to be found in the fact that, when Sayyid ʿAlī­Muḥammad Shīrāzī
declared himself bāb in 1260/ 1844, one of his first acts was to send a letter
pressing his claims to the Shaykh,194 while also dispatching letters to Tehran for
Muḥammad Shāh, (r. 1838­1848) and Hājī Mīrzā Āqāsī, the prime minister.195

It was, however, a pupil of Shaykh Jaʿfar, Shaykh Murtaḍā Anṣārī, who
carried the role of mujtahid to its highest point. Having succeeded al­Najafī at
the ʿatabāt,196 Anṣārī was acknowledged as marjaʿ not only in Iraq and Iran, but
in Turkey, Arabia, and India, thus becoming the first to be universally
recognized throughout virtually the entire Shiʿi world.197 Of particular
significance in the present context is the statement of Iʿtimād al­Salṭana
Muḥammad Ḥasan Khān (d. 1896) that Anṣārī was “the first general vicegerent
Nāʾib al­ʿĀmm) of the Imām.198 The Bab’s claim was, in the first instance, held
by some to be that of ‘special vicegerent’ (Nā'ib al­Khāṣṣ).199

The sense of unity thus achieved was ruptured for a short time by various
claims to leadership on the death of Anṣārī, but was continued in the end by
Mīrzā Sayyid Muḥammad Ḥasan ibn Maḥmūd Shīrāzī (1230­1312/ 1815­1895),
the Mīrzā-yi Shīrāzī who issued a fatwā against the Tobacco Regie in 1892.200 In
many respects, the importance of Mīrzā-yi Shīrāzī exceeded that of Anṣārī, to
whose position he had succeeded. He is described by his pupil Ḥasan ibn Hādī
Ṣadr (1856­1935) in his Takmilat Amal al­āmil as “the leader of Islam, the nāʾib
of the Imām, the renewer [mujaddid] of the divine laws [at the beginning of the
fourteenth century hijri]. The leadership of the Jaʿfari sect through the world
was centered in [him] towards the end of his life.”201 Iʿtimād al­Salṭana, writing
in Shīrāzī’s lifetime, states that “today he is the most learned of the mujtahids in
the eyes of the people of discernment.”202

The lack of any real, hierarchically-organized ecclesiastical system meant
that the situation after Shīrāzī became somewhat unclear, with little agreement
as to which precise individuals might be regarded as worthy of holding the
position of sole marjaʿ. Hairi states that ‘if at a given time there existed several
equally qualified mujtahids, some might be able to gain recognition as the sole
marjaʿ,203 and gives the example of Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbd al­
Raḥīm Nāʾīnī Najafī (1277­1355/1860­1936), Ayatollah ʿAbd al­Karīm ibn

Muḥammad Jaʿfar Ḥā’irī­Yazdī (1276­1355/1859­1937), and Abu ‘l­Ḥasan
Mūsawī al­Isbahānī (known as Sayyid Abu ‘l-Ḥasan Iṣfahānī, 1284­1365/1867­
1946), in the period before the death of the first two. Nevertheless, a succession
of individual scholars did appear who fostered the role of marjaʿ on an absolute
or partial basis and kept alive the possibility of a source of charismatic authority
in the Shiʿi world.204 Ayatollah Burūjirdī, who died in 1961, was particularly
successful in establishing his position as sole marjaʿ, although even here there
were those who tended to see him as head of the body of ulama in an
organizational rather than ideal charismatic sense.205 During this period, the title
ayatollah came to be used widely of mujtahids who had acquired the standing of
marjaʿ, and, in more recent times, there has been a tendency to institutionalize
the title, particularly in the form “Āyat Allāh al-ʿUẓmā”, used of the most
outstanding mujtahid. Thus, Burūjirdī was recognized as Āyat Allāh al-ʿUẓmā
in his lifetime,206 as was Ayatollah Khomeini after the revolution. Even Sunnis
have spoken of Khomeini as the mujaddid of the fifteenth Islamic century. This
is all the more intriguing when we consider that he achieved his present position
more by virtue of his political success and charismatic appeal than by any
outstanding abilities as an ʿālim—in some ways a reversal of the trend towards
ecclesiastical routinization by the irruption of latent charisma.

The implications of this development as a means of extending or
projecting the charisma of the Imām into individual figures of supreme or near
supreme authority are clear. The marjaʿ or Ayatollah is the living deputy of the
Imām in an active and distinct sense. Thus, Mahmoud Shehabi writes that

> The order was received that during the long absence the ignorant
> are to be guided by the orders and the religious ideas of the
> leaders—called public deputies (i.e. nāʾib­i ʿamm), or deputies not
> specifically appointed (i.e. as opposed to the nāʾib­i khāṣṣ)—who
> know jurisprudence, can protect their religion, and are thus able to
> save the people from sins, corruption, and earthly desires. Such
> public deputies who have a thorough knowledge from the proper
> sources are, during the long absence, like an Imam and following
> them is comparable to following an Imam. Since Shī‘a depends
> [sic] upon the one who is the most learned and accepts him as the
> public deputy, in every epoch the person who is the most learned
> and pious is regarded as the public deputy and the people follow his
> ideas and his decisions concerning religious affairs.207

This link with the Imām is vividly illustrated by Ḥājī Mīrzā Yaḥyā Dawlatābādī,
when he points out that one of the factors inducing Mīrzā yi Shīrāzī to live in
Samarra was the existence there of the cellar in which the twelfth Imām was said
to have entered occultation, a fact which increased the stature of the nāʾib of the
Imām living there.208 According to Leonard Binder, “Burujirdī’s supporters

came close to representing him as the sole spokesman for the Hidden Imām.”209

Some of Khomeini’s followers have, in fact, gone as far as to speak of him
openly and in print as the nāʾib of the Imām210 while his arrival in Iran in the
early days of the revolution had what can only be described as messianic
overtones. The significance of the role of the Rukn­i Rābiʿ in Shaykhism, or of
the bāb in early Babism becomes much clearer in the context of a growing
demand for a single source of charismatic authority in Shiʿism from the time of
Bihbahānī onwards. In the case of Babism, however, we shall see that the
charisma was original rather than latent.

In this regard, it is important to understand that the emergence of Shaykh
Muḥammad Ḥasan Najafi as supreme marjaʿ al­taqlīd was itself the result of a
development in which several individuals of importance figured. We have
indicated above how many of the leading ulama of the early nineteenth century
studied under Bihbahānī and one another, creating a complex network of
masters and pupils. Out of this group there emerged a number of ulama who
were, in a sense, prototypes of Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥasan Najafi and his
successors, on the one hand, and of the wealthy, influential ulama of the later
Qajar period (such as Mullā ʿAlī Kanī, Shaykh Muḥammad Taqī Iṣfahānī Āqā
Najafī (d. 1914), and Hājī Āqā Muḥsin ʿIrāqī) on the other.

Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī Ṭabāṭabāʾī Baḥr al­ʿUlūm was widely
regarded in Bihbahānī’s lifetime as possessing influence at the ʿatabāt second
only to that of the latter, and was certainly the leading ʿālim in the brief period
between Bihbahānī’s death and his own. This ‘Ocean of the Sciences’ was born
in 1155/1742 in Karbala, where he studied initially under his father, Sayyid
Murtaḍā Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, later receiving instruction from Shaykh Yūsuf al­
Baḥrānī (d. 1772?). He then went to Najaf, where, he studied under Shaykh
Muḥammad Mahdī Fatūnī, Shaykh Muḥammad Taqī Darūqī al-Najafi, and
several other ulama. Following this, he returned to Karbala to study under
Bihbahānī . Among his pupils were Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī, Sayyid Jawād al-
Āmilī, Mullā Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Mahdī Narāqī Kāshānī (d. 1245/ 1829),
Hājī Muḥammad Ibrāhīm Kalbāsī, Shaykh ʿAbd ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad al-
Baḥrānī, and Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi , to whom he gave an ijāza. His writings
are comparatively few, including the Hāshiyyat al-wāfiyya on uṣūl, the Durrat
al­manẓūma on fiqh, and the Fawāʾid al­Uṣūliyya.211

Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī, whose polemics against Mīrzā Muḥammad
Akhbārī in the time of Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh put a seal on Bihbahānī’s victory over the
Akhbari movement, exercised great influence, not only at the ʿatabāt but in Iran
itself, where he commanded the obedience of the Shah. According to
Tanakābunī, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī,

> permitted Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh to ascend the throne (idhn dar salṭanat
> dād), and appointed him as his deputy (nāʾib), but on certain
> conditions: that he appoint a muʾadhdhin to each of the regiments

of the army and an Imām Jumʿa for the army as a whole, who
> should deliver a sermon once a week and give instructions on
> [religious] questions.212

Despite his well-known love for food and sex, he had a reputation as a
sternly religious man, attending rigorously to his devotions, and it was his
example which inspired Mullā Muḥammad Taqī Baraghānī Qazvīnī (d. 1847) to
apply himself to his prayers during the night, even in winter.213 Apart from
Bihbahānī, Shaykh Jaʿfar studied under Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, Shaykh Muḥammad
Mahdī Fatūnī, and Shaykh Muḥammad Taqī Darūqī al-Najafī (themselves
teachers of Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, as noted earlier). An Arab, whose Persian was not
very fluent, his influence in Iran—where he traveled almost every year—
prefigures in many respects that exercised by Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi, who
was, in fact, one of his pupils. In particular, his influence in Isfahan and Qazvīn
shows a striking resemblance to that achieved a short time later by al­Ahsaʾi in
those same places, and, with the notable exception of Muḥammad Taqī
Baraghānī, exercised over many of the same people. We have referred earlier to
the importance of Shaykh Jaʿfar’s work on fiqh, the Kashf al­ghiṭāʾ, as an
example of the conjunction of charismatic and legal authority in the work of
certain individual scholars. He was, in the words of Khwānsārī, “obeyed by both
Arabs and Persians,”214 and became, as he himself writes, “the Shaykh of all the
Shaykhs of the Muslims.”215 Āghā Buzurg al-Ṭihrānī describes him as “the
favored leader of the Shiʿis, and their greatest marjaʿ in his day.”216 Some even
regarded him as the nāʾib of the Imām,217 a point of some significance in the
present context.

Among the most important contemporaries of al­Najafī, we may note Hājī
Mīrzā Abu ‘l­Qāsim Qummī (1734?­1816) (Mīrzā-yi Qummī) and Sayyid ʿAlī
ibn Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabāʾī. Qummī studied under Bihbahānī, Shaftī, Fatūnī,
and others, and eventually came to live and teach in Qum, where he did much to
raise the standard of religious studies. His important work on fiqh, al­Qawanin
al-muhkama, is one of the most important contributions to the study of uṣūl, to
the extent that Khwānsārī claims “it has abrogated all the books of uṣūl”218—yet
another example of the way in which Shiʿi fiqh was perceived as developing in
this period.

Another Ṭabāṭabāʾī, Sayyid ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad (1748-1815)219 is the
author of another famous work on fiqh, the Riyāḍ al­masāʾil fī bayān al­aḥkām
bi ‘l­dalā’il, noted for its contribution to furūʿ. Born in Kāẓimiyya, he was
descended from Mullā Muḥammad Taqī Majlisī, the father of Mullā Muḥammad
Bāqir, while his own father had married a sister of Āqā Bihbahānī; he himself
later married one of Bihbahānī’s daughters. His early studies were carried out
under the direction of Bihbahānī’s eldest son, Āqā Muḥammad ʿAlī Bihbahānī ,
but he later studied under the murawwij himself. He too taught a number of
important ulama, including Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi , Hājī Muḥammad Ibrāhīm

Kalbāsī, Hājī Sayyid Muḥammad Bāqir Shaftī, Muḥammad Taqī Baraghānī and
his brother, Hājī Mullā Muḥammad Ṣāliḥ Baraghānī (d. ca. 1853), (the father of
the Babi leader Qurrat al-ʿAyn (1817­1852), about whom much will be said in
succeeding pages.

Sayyid ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad provides us with an excellent example of an
increasingly common phenomenon in the period under review: the ʿālim with
close links not only by means of ijāza but also through physical descent and
marriage with other ulama of significance. From the late Safavid period on, we
can observe how religious authority passed not only from teacher to pupil but
from father to son as well; descendants of Muḥammad Taqī Majlisī and
Muḥammad Bāqir Majlisī, of Nīʿmat Allāh ibn ʿAbd Allāh al­Jazāʾirī, Āqā
Bihbahānī, Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, Shaykh Ja‘far al­Najafī, and Sayyid ʿAlī ibn
Muḥammad Ṭabātabāʾī himself came to occupy positions of importance in the
religious hierarchy.

Not only was the power of the individual mujtahids increasing, but the
influence of certain clerical families was growing. Intermarriage between the
members of these families strengthened this power to a degree that made entry
into the highest echelons of the ulama class increasingly difficult for someone
outside the circles of this power structure (although, as Bill has noted, the
religious classes have provided a path into the middle sector of society for
young men of humble birth up to the modern period).220 By way of contrast, as
we shall note, Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi was neither descended from a clerical
family nor related to one by marriage. None of his descendants aspired to rank
within the religious hierarchy, although many of his students rose to eminence.

Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti, similarly, came from an important family of sayyids
who had no connection with the ulama, and, although some of them were
scholars, none of his descendants (with the limited exception of his son Sayyid
Aḥmad) held a notable position within the Shiʿi hierarchy. Ḥājī Muḥammad
Karīm Khān Kirmānī, Rashti’s successor as head of the Shaykhi school, was the
only ʿālim in a family closely related to the ruling Qajar house, but it is
significant to note that he succeeded in establishing his own small dynasty of
scholars in Kirman, as did his rival, Mullā Muḥammad Māmaqānī Ḥujjat al­
Islām (d. 1269/1852), in Tabriz. Although Sayyid ʿAlī­Muḥammad­i­Shīrāzī
was related through his father to Mīrzā-yi Shīrāzī and Sayyid Jawād Shīrāzī (an
important Imām Jumʿa of Kirman), his family was primarily composed of
wholesale merchants (tujjār). Much the same is true of several (but by no means
all) of the Bab’s disciples, including Mullā Muḥammad Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī
(1814?­1849) and Mullā Muḥammad ʿAlī Bārfurūshī (d. 1849).

A student of Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī, Bihbahānī , Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, Sayyid
ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabā’ī, and Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi, Hājī
Muḥammad Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad Ḥasan Kalbāsī (1766-1845) seems to have
been one of the earliest mujtahids to achieve recognition as a marjaʿ beyond a
restricted area, being acknowledged as such for the whole of Iran, Arabia, and

India221—although his recognition cannot be said to have been universal in those
regions. Khwānsārī describes him as “the source of sciences, wisdom, and
writings, the center of the circle of noble scholars, the axis around which the
sharīʿa revolved in this age, and the support of the Shiʿa and their distinguished
and mighty shaykh.”222 Descendants of Kalbāsī are numbered among the leading
ulama of the later period in Isfahan and Iraq. His contemporary and associate in
Isfahan, Mullā Muḥammad Bāqir Shaftī (Rashti), Ḥujjāt al­Islām (1761–l844)
had studied under Bihbahānī, Sayyid ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabā’ī Bahr al­
‘Ulūm, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī, Sayyid Muḥsin al­Aʿraji, and Abu ‘l­Qāsim
Qummī. He is described by Algar as “the first example of the wealthy, assertive
mujtahid, whose power—judicial, economic, and political—exceeds that of the
secular government, which functions, indeed, only with his consent and subject
to his ultimate control.”223 Shaftī’s influence did not end, however, in the
financial or political spheres; he acquired a considerable reputation as a scholar,
attracting pupils from several countries,224 and became, in the words of an
English observer, “renowned for his sanctity from Kerbelah to the Ganges, and
considered the most shining luminary of the Sheeah faith.”225 The importance of
his position towards the time of his death is indicated by the fact that Sayyid
Kāẓim Rashti singled him out as the one individual whose approval of the
Shaykhi position would secure for it considerable protection from the attacks of
other ulama, and sought to influence him by sending Mullā Muḥammad Ḥusayn
Bushrūʾī to Isfahan, in order to win his allegiance.226

Had it not been for the pronouncement against him of takfīr in about
1822, Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi might well have been the first Shiʿi ālim to
achieve universal marjaʿīyya. Despite the takfīr and the continuing prejudice
against Shaykhism in orthodox circles, later writers have almost universally
accorded him the highest praise, and there is no doubt that, in his own lifetime
he was one of the most powerful and respected ulama living in Iran. Although
strongly favored by Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh, and, from 1814, lavishly patronized by
Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā in Kirmanshah, he succeeded in avoiding any
imputation of having sold out to the secular powers, and was regarded as both
pious and brilliant. No study of the development of charismatic authority in
Shiʿism during this period would be complete without detailed reference to al­
Ahsaʾi, not least because of the manner in which the Shaykhi school after him
and, from 1844, the Babi movement interpreted and expressed the nature and
function of such authority and of the ‘gnostic motif’. Having provided some idea
of the intellectual milieu of Twelver Shiʿism at the time of his arrival in Iraq
from Arabia, let us now discuss at greater length the career of al­Ahsaʾi himself.

Chapter TWO
SHAYKH AḤMAD AL­AHSAʾI

Birth, Childhood, and Youth

Viewed in the light of his later fame as one of the leading Shiʿi ulama of his day,
the circumstances of al­Ahsaʾi’s birth were most inauspicious. The individuality
of his contribution to Shiʿi thought in the early years of the nineteenth century
may, in some ways, be attributed to his formative years. Unfortunately, our
sources reveal comparatively little about this period, and we must depend on
circumstantial evidence in attempting to trace the main influences on his thought
and outlook, cast as they are in an original and at times eccentric form.

According to his own testimony, al­Ahsaʾi was born in the month of
Rajab 1166/May 1753.227 His birthplace was a small Shiʿi village called al-
Maṭayrafī, situated in the oasis of al-Aḥsāʾ (or al­Ḥasāʾ) near the east coast of
the Arabian Peninsula,228 where his family had lived for several generations. The
first of his ancestors to settle there had been Shaykh Dāghir, his great-great­
great­grandfather, who had become estranged from his father Ramaḍān and
gone to live in the village. The dispute was almost certainly about religion:
Dāghir was the first of al­Ahsaʾi’s ancestors to embrace Shiʿism, at about the
time local tradition speaks of the conversion of several Arab tribes, about four
hundred years ago.229 Before that, the Shaykh’s forebears had been nomadic
Sunnis.230 None of our sources provides details as to the occupation of Shaykh
Aḥmad’s father or other relatives, but it is reasonable to assume that none of
them were ulama. It is possible, however, that his family was of some influence
in the area, since they belonged to the dominant Mahāshir clan, of the ruling
Banū Khālid.231

Despite the religious diversity of al­Aḥsāʾ, which, in the eighteenth
century, included Jews and Sabaeans as well as Shiʿis and Sunnis,232 the
principal religious orientation of the region was Shiʿi. When the Safavid dynasty
in Iran found itself compelled to look abroad for Shiʿi scholars to instruct the
Iranian population in Twelver doctrine, they went to Jabal ʿĀmil in Lebanon
and to Bahrain.233 Men such as Sayyid Zayn al­Dīn ʿAlī ibn Sulaymān al­
Baḥrānī Umm al­Ḥadīth (d. 1064/ 1653),234 Hāshim ibn Sulaymān al­Baḥrānī (d.
1109/1695), the author of the Ghāyat al­marām,235 Shaykh Sulaymān ibn ʿAbd
Allāh al­Muḥaqqiq al­Baḥrānī (d. 1120/1708­9),236 and Shaykh Aḥmad ibn
Muḥammad al­Khaṭṭī al­Baḥrānī (d. 1120/ 1708­9)237 are among the numerous
ulama from Bahrain who achieved distinction in orthodox Shiʿi circles in the
Safavid period.

Side by side with the development of Shiʿi orthodoxy in the region,
however, there appears to have been a recurrent tendency to favour more

heterodox systems. One of the most eminent Ishrāqī thinkers, Muḥammad ibn
ʿAlī Ibn Abī Jumhūr al­Ahsaʾi (d. ca. 1473), was a native of the region. Mullā
Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān Tanakābunī has claimed that Shaykh Aḥmad
obtained the library of Ibn Abī Jumhūr and that the books in it proved a major
influence on his mind as a young man.238 Whether or not this is true—and it
seems highly unlikely—al­Ahsaʾi certainly acquired considerable familiarity
with Ishrāqī literature at some point.

Of possibly greater significance in the Shaykh’s development may have
been residual Qarmaṭī influence in the area. As is well known, the Qarmaṭī sect
founded a state in al­Aḥsāʾ under Abū Saʿīd al­Jannābī (d. 300/ 913) in 899.
Although the military power of the Qarāmaṭī declined by the eleventh century,
the state in al­Ahsaʾi remained in existence, its internal affairs being run by a
representative council of sādāt which “seems to have maintained local
autonomy down to the xviiith century.”239 There is also evidence of fresh
Qarmaṭī influence from Yemen in eighteenth century Aḥsāʾ.

In the 1760s, one of the most important of the Ismaili (Sulaymani­
Mustaʿli) tribes in Yemen, the Banū Yām, came under the control of the
Makramī family, by whom it has been ruled down to the present day.240 The first
Makramī sheikh—whose name appears to have been Ḥasan ibn Hibbat
Allāh241—was made governor of Najrān by the Imām of Saana, but soon
achieved independence, extending his influence by 1763 over other Ismaili
tribes in Saʿfān, Ḥarāz, Manākha, and Ṭayba.242 In 1764, several members of the
Banū ʿAjmān who had been defeated by the Wahhabis at Hadba Qidhla, fled to
Najrān and persuaded the tribes there to join in a counter-attack on the
Wahhabis. Ḥasan ibn Hibbat Allāh led his forces to Wadī Ḥanīfa and defeated a
Wahhabi force under ʿAbd al­ʿAzīz (1766­1803).243 Although Ḥasan eventually
left after negotiations, it seems that, at this time, he entered al­Aḥsāʾ for a
period.244 Louis Massignon (1883­1962) maintains that the Makramīs attempted
to revive Qarmatism while in al­Aḥsāʾ, and that Qarāmaṭī still exist there in the
form of what he calls “neo-Ismailis”.245

The possibility of an Ismaili revival in the region at that time is highly
suggestive, and may not impossibly lead to fresh conclusions as to the sources of
much of al­Ahsaʾi’s thought. Certain intriguing parallels exist between elements
in his later teaching and Qarmaṭī/Ismaili doctrine. The Qarmaṭī view that the
Imamate is not a hereditary function but one which may be conferred through a
form of divine illumination, making the new Imām the “substituted” son of his
predecessor, may well have influenced the Shaykhi theory of succession (up to
Muḥammad Khān Kirmānī (d. 1906)) and even played a part in the transition
from Shaykhism to Babism.

The concept of the world as a series of phenomena being repeated in
cycles, like a drama replaying itself, which is found in Qarmaṭī and Ḥurūfī
doctrine, offers a parallel to the Babi view of successive ẓuhūrāt, in which the
chief actors of the divine drama return to the stage in each epoch, while the use

of jafr equivalents for the letters of the alphabet is a recurring feature of
Qarmaṭī, mainline Ismaili, Ḥurūfī, and Babi thought. Significant also is the
appearance in both Shaykhi and Babi literature of technical terms common to
extreme Shiʿi sects like the Qarmatiyya, and it is not impossible that much of
the curious Arabic terminology adopted by Shaykh Aḥmad had such an origin.
We shall observe in our final chapters a number of further points of resemblance
between Shaykhi/Babi and Ismaili doctrine.

Until further evidence becomes available, however, it would be unwise to
fall back too readily on Qarmaṭī/Ismaili influence in the direct sense as an
explanation for the development of al­Ahsaʾi’s thought along lines somewhat
different to those of the majority of Twelver Shiʿi ulama at the shrine cities or in
Iran during this period. It is, nevertheless, clear that, in respect of orthodox
Shiʿism, al­Aḥsāʾ in the eighteenth century was not a place where a young man
of scholarly bent could readily find instruction beyond the rudimentary level.
There were, of course, ulama in the region. Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh al­Ahsaʾi speaks
of “those learned in externals (ulamā­yi ẓāhirī) in al­Aḥsāʾ”at the time of
Shaykh Aḥmad’s first departure for Iraq.246 The same source indicates that many
of the ulama in the area were Sunnis, most of whom were also Sufis.247 Several
Shiʿi ulama of the period are referred to by Shaykh Yūsuf al-Baḥrānī in his
Lu’luʾatay al­Baḥrayn, composed in 1182/1768. Many of Shaykh Aḥmad’s own
letters are addressed to ulama in al­Aḥsāʾ and al­Qatif, particularly the latter
region. As we shall see later, two of al­Ahsaʾi’s ijāzāt were obtained from ulama
resident in Bahrain, while Rashti speaks of scholars there and in al­Qatif and al­
Aḥsāʾ who were among the admirers of Shaykh Aḥmad.248 Much of Rashti’s
own correspondence, like that of al­Ahsaʾi, was in reply to questions from
clerics in that region, but it was not there that the more capable and influential
scholars resided.

With the movement of large numbers of Iranian ulama to the ʿatabāt
following the Afghan invasion, and the subsequent revival of Shiʿi learning at
the holy cities in the latter half of the eighteenth century, the better scholars had
largely been drawn away from peripheral centres such as Bahrain. Although
Wahhabis did not conquer al­Aḥsāʾ until the 1790s, their progress elsewhere in
the Arabian Peninsula and occasional clashes with the Banū Khālid appear to
have caused lively distress to the Shiʿi ulama in the Bahrain region. Sayyid
Muḥammad Hāshimī Kirmānī has suggested that Shaykh Aḥmad left al­Aḥsāʾ in
the wake of a general exodus of Arab ulama (presumably Shiʿi) who went to
Iran to escape the Wahhabis.249 Many of these clerics settled in Fārs and
Kirman, and were later among the admirers of al­Ahsaʾi in those parts. This
exodus of Shiʿi ulama during the period of the Shaykh’s early life may have
been a factor in his own decision to leave his home for a brief time when he was
twenty.

There are indications that Aḥsāʾ in that period was regarded as little more
than a provincial backwater, lacking proper facilities for anything but the most

elementary intellectual pursuits. Baḥr al­ʿUlūm expressed surprise that someone
as learned as Shaykh Aḥmad should be a native of “a region which is empty of
knowledge and wisdom, and whose inhabitants are desert-dwellers and country-
folk, the furthest extent of whose learning consists in how to perform the daily
prayers.”250 Al­Ahsaʾi himself often remarked that the people of his village were
worldly and given to what he regarded as idle pleasures, that they knew nothing
of the laws of Islam, and that he could find no-one there to teach him beyond the
elementary stages.251

Outside the main towns of al­Hufūf and al-Mubarraz education in al­
Aḥsāʾ was, it appears, largely confined to instruction by individual sheikhs or
muʿallims, few of whom can have been well-educated themselves. Young
Aḥmad, having completed the traditional “reading” of the Qurʾan by the age of
five,252 was not, it seems, intended for tuition beyond this stage. Fortunately, a
young cousin was receiving training in grammar and other elementary subjects
at a nearby village, and Aḥmad was able to persuade his father to let him join
him there.253 Between this time and the period of his early studies at the ʿatabāt
when he was twenty, we possess no further information as to his education.

Somewhat problematic is the statement made in a number of sources, that
al­Ahsaʾi was for a time a murīd of Sayyid Quṭb al­Dīn Muḥammad Nayrīzī (d.
1173/1760), the thirty-second quṭb of the Dhahabī Sufi order, one of the very
few Shiʿi ṭarīqas in existence.254 Mīrzā Shafīʿ Thiqat al­Islām Tabrizī, a
Shaykhi who had studied under al­Ahsaʾi, refers to this in his Mirʾāt al­kutub.
He quotes the Qawā’im al-anwār, a work by Mīrzā Abu ‘l­Qāsim Shīrāzī (d.
1286/A.D 1869) the fourth successor to Sayyid Quṭb al­Dīn as head of the
Dhahabīs.255 Here, Mīrzā Abu ‘l­Qāsim states that Quṭb al­Dīn lived for a time
in Najaf, where he taught Ibn al­ʿArabī’s al­Futūḥāt al­Makkiyya. Among those
who studied under him, it is claimed, were Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī Murtaḍā
Ṭabāṭabā’ī Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī, and Mullā Miḥrāb Jīlānī.256
He goes on to say that, when Quṭb al­Dīn was in al­Aḥsāʾ, Shaykh Aḥmad
studied under him.

Thiqat al­Islām then quotes from the Risāla tāmm al­ḥikma of Abu ‘l­
Qāsim’s son, Sayyid Muḥammad Majd al­Ashrāf.257 According to this source,
Quṭb al­Dīn sent Mullā Mihrāb Gīlānī to Isfahan and Persian Iraq, instructed
Baḥr al­ʿUlūm and Shaykh Jaʿfar to remain at the ʿatabāt, and sent al­Ahsaʾi to
Iran.258 Majd al­Ashrāf is quoted to the same effect by Muḥammad Mas‘ūm
Shīrāzī Maʿṣūm ʿAlī Shāh (b. 1853) in his Ṭarāʾiq al­ḥaqāʾiq; here it is added
that Quṭb al­Dīn also sent Āqā Muḥammad Hāshim Shīrāzī (d. 1199/1785) to
Fārs.259 Maʿṣūm ʿAlī Shāh also refers to Quṭb al­Dīn as having taught Shaykh
Aḥmad while in al­Aḥsāʾ.260

Convincing as all this may appear, it does not sustain critical attention.

Sayyid Quṭb al­Dīn was a contemporary of the last Safavid monarch, Ḥusayn I
(1668­1726), and had studied under Shaykh ʿAlī Naqī Istihbanātī.261 He died in
1173/1759, when al­Ahsaʾi was only about seven years old.262 With the

exception of Āqā Muḥammad Hāshim Shīrāzī, there seems to be no independent
evidence linking any of the persons mentioned above with Sayyid Quṭb al­Dīn
or, indeed, with Sufism at all. The only conclusion to be drawn is that the
account of Quṭb al­Dīn’s dealings with men such as Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, al-Najafī,
and al­Ahsaʾi—three of the most influential ulama of their day—was for no
other reason than to gain a certain respectability for Sufism at a time when
orthodox Shiʿi attacks on some Ṣūfī orders had become extremely fierce,
following a Niʿmatullāhī revival in the latter half of the eighteenth century.263

Shaykhi sources, including two autobiographical risālas by al­Ahsaʾi
himself, lay stress on a number of visionary experiences as central to his
development during this early period. Showing a marked predilection for
seclusion and introspection—a feature also characteristic of the childhoods of
Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti and Sayyid ʿAlī Muḥammad Shīrāzī264—al­Ahsaʾi was
given to morbid reflection on the transience of the world.265 He was really one of
Lawrence’s Arabs, ascetic and craving the solitary wastes. An impressionable
mind joined with favourable circumstances and a lack of facilities for formal
intellectual training urged him towards a life of reflection and self-abnegation,266
culminating, at an unspecified point, in a series of dreams or visions.

These visions were to have a lasting effect on the mind of the young
Shaykh, and came to play a central role in his intellectual and spiritual
development. Their significance, both in terms of the formation of his thought
and the light in which he was regarded by his contemporaries and by later
Shaykhis, is very great. They are particularly important in terms of the
charismatic relationship between the Shaykh and the Imāms on the one hand,
and between him and his own followers on the other. In general, these visions
seem to have been experienced by him in sleep and to have taken the form,
typical to Shiʿite piety, of meetings with various Imāms and, on a number of
occasions, the Prophet.

The first of these experiences was a dream of a young man, seemingly
aged about twenty-five and carrying a book, who came to sit near the Shaykh.
He turned to him, read a verse of the Qurʾan, and proceeded to comment on it.267
Shaykh Aḥmad was so impressed by the words he heard from this young man
that he resolved to abandon the study of grammar and other exoteric subjects. In
his account of this incident, he states that he had met many shaykhs yet never
heard any speak words such as those in the dream: in itself an indication that he
had, by the time of this initial visionary experience, been studying for a while.

A succession of such visions followed, in the course of which the Shaykh
believed that he met various Imāms and the Prophet and was taught verses by
the Imām Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī, the purpose of which was to enable him to call on the
Imāms whenever he required an answer to any problem—a significant factor in
his development as a source of charismatic authority.268 Such visions, he writes,
were experienced by him most days and nights, which may indicate some level
of mental imbalance.269 On two occasions, once with the Imām Ḥasan and once

with Muḥammad, he claimed to have undergone what appears to have been a
form of initiatory experience, involving the drinking of saliva from the mouth of
the Imām or Prophet.270 Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti speaks of the initiatory meeting
with lmam Ḥasan as the first of the Shaykh’s visions,271 followed by a two-year
period during which he did not associate with people and scarcely ate or drank,
until he was near death. At this point, the meeting with Muḥammad took place,
and the effect of imbibing the saliva of the Prophet was to quiet his excessive
religious ardour.272

Leaving aside the question of their authenticity, there is no doubt that the
subjective impact of these visions on the Shaykh was tremendous. The intensity
of his reaction can well be gauged by the behaviour just referred to. He now
believed himself to be in direct contact with the Prophet and the Imāms and to
have them as his source of guidance on all subjects. In a significant vision,
presumably towards the end of this period, he believed himself to have
encountered the tenth Imām, ʿAlī al­Hādī. Having complained to the Imām
about the condition of the people among whom he lived, he was instructed to
leave them and busy himself with his own affairs. The Imām is then recorded as
giving him several sheets of paper, saying ‘this is the ijāza from us twelve [i.e.,
the twelve Imāms]’. When al­Ahsaʾi looked at these papers, he saw that each
page contained an ijāza from one of the twelve Imāms.273

It is this belief that his knowledge was directly granted him by the Prophet
and the Imāms (the latter in particular) that distinguishes Shaykh Aḥmad from
contemporary religious leaders. Speaking of al­Ahsaʾi’s knowledge of various
sciences, Rashti states that ‘these sciences came to that distinguished one in true
and veracious dreams from the Imāms of guidance.”274 The role of the Imāms as
spiritual guides has always been emphasized in Shiʿism, but al­Ahsaʾi seems to
have taken this concept to an extreme degree. In his Sharḥ al­fawāʾid, written in
1233/1818, some eight years before his death, he writes:

> The ulama derive their knowledge (taḥqīqāt ʿulūmihim) one from
> the other, but I have never followed in their way. I have derived
> what I know from the Imāms of guidance, and error cannot find its
> way into my words, since all that I confirm in my books is from
> them and they are preserved (maʿṣūm) from sin and ignorance and
> error. Whosoever derives [his knowledge] from them shall not err,
> inasmuch as he is following them.275

Elsewhere, he writes:

> When anything was hidden from me, I would see its explanation,
> even if only in summary. And whenever any explanation was given
> to me in sleep (al­ṭayf), after I awoke the question would appear
> clear to me along with the proofs related to it, in such a way that

nothing concerning it would be hidden from me. Even if all men
> were to gather together, they would be unable to achieve anything
> resembling that; but I would be cognizant of all the proofs of the
> matter [in question]. And, if a thousand criticisms were levelled
> against me, the defence against them and the answers would be
> shown to me without any effort on my part. Moreover, I found that
> all traditions were in agreement with what I had seen in sleep, for
> what I saw in my dreams I saw directly, and no error could enter
> into it… I say nothing unless by virtue of a proof which is derived
> from them [the Imāms].276

In one place, he describes these dreams as ilhām, a species of reveleation
generally generally eserved for the Imāms themselves, although inferior to the
waḥy given to prophets.277 More usually, he speaks of kashf or mukāshifa, the
‘unveilling’ of inner meanings by means of these visions.278 This last concept
was given sufficient prominence to give rise to the use of the term kashfīyya as a
name for the school which grew up around him. Rashti, referring to the use of
this term, gives the concept of kashf a somewhat general application, but there
seems little doubt that the name was appllied to the school by reason of a more
technical application of the word.279 It is worth recalling, in this context, the
experience of Faḍl Allāh Astarābādī (740­804/1339­1401) the founder of the
Ḥurūfī sect, who, at the age of forty, heard a disembodied voice announcing that
“others attain faith by imitation and learning, whereas he attains it by an inner
and clear revelation (kashf wa ʿiyān).”280

It would, however, be misleading to suggest that the Shaykh’s reliance on
these visions caused him to dispense with formal learning altogether. When
Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh al­Ahsaʾi writes that his father abandoned ‘exoteric
studies’,281 the implication seems to be simply that he gave up the study of
grammar, philology, rhetoric, and similar pursuits and devoted himself to the
study of the Qurʾan and aḥādīth, as well as the ‘Divine Philosophy’ (ḥikma
ilāhiyya) of the Isfahan school. This would seem to be confirmed by Rashti, who
writes that

> he did not receive these sciences and inner teachings so much in
> sleep, but rather, when he awoke, he discovered manifest proofs
> and evidences from the book of God and from the path of the
> explanations and instructions of the Imāms of guidance.282

This statement bears great similarity to that of al­Ahsaʾi, quoted above, in which
he says “I found that all traditions were in agreement with what I had seen in
sleep.”

By 1186/1772,283 therefore, when he was twenty, al­Ahsaʾi had reached a
point in his intellectual and spiritual development where he stood in serious need

of instruction and inspiration which local teachers could not give him. Whether
aware of the theological developments taking place there or not, it was in the
ʿatabāt that the young Shaykh decided to look for such guidance.

The Intermediary Years

Shaykh Aḥmad’s first sojourn in Iraq was of insufficient duration to allow him
to benefit greatly from the opportunities for study available among the ulama of
the shrine cities. Not long after his arrival, plague broke but in Iraq. Beginning
in March 1773 at Baghdad, where it had been carried by a caravan from
Erzerum, the epidemic spread rapidly as far as Basra. It continued at Baghdad
until mid-May and at Basra until September, with heavy fatalities throughout the
country.284 As a result, large numbers of the population dispersed, and Shaykh
Aḥmad joined the exodus, returning to al­Aḥsāʾ.285 Judging from his later
attitude to urban life and his obvious reluctance to return to the ʿatabāt after the
passing of the plague, we may suppose that the Shaykh had found conditions
there uncongenial. As a young and comparatively untrained student from the
provinces, he may have found it difficult to benefit fully from classes designed
for those with a better general grounding in theological studies. He may, in
modern idiom, have experienced a form of culture shock. Whatever the cause,
the fact is that he chose to remain for a long time in relative seclusion in al­
Aḥsāʾ, rather than return to what was then the centre of theological activity in
Shiʿism. Had it not been for the Wahhabi advance on Bahrain, it is probable that
he would never have sought to leave the region again.

After his return to al­Aḥsāʾ, the Shaykh married his first wife, Maryam
bint Khamīs Āl ʿAṣīr, a girl related to him from the village of Qarayn, where he
had studied as a child.286 He was to marry a total of eight wives over the years,
from whom he had altogether twenty children.287 It is never made clear exactly
how he provided for his growing family during this period, but there are clear
indications that he became well known in the region as a religious authority.
Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh al­Ahsaʾi states that, even before his journey to Iraq, people
had begun to ask him to pray on their behalf, and we may suppose that a
measure of financial return was given for this. During the period after his return,
he became famous and was regarded as a marjaʿ for the people of the region,
but how far his fame actually reached, it is impossible to tell.288

One result of his increased association with the people around him was
the cessation of his visions.289 Possibly as a result, he seems to have devoted
himself to a wide programme of studies, although here again we have little
information as to the books he read or the teachers under whom he worked.
Rashti, however, makes it clear that he acquired some competence in a wide
variety of subjects, listing some thirty sciences, including astronomy, arithmetic,
astrology, alchemy, medicine, kalām, and fiqh, and several crafts, including
weaving and metal-working, in all of which he claims the Shaykh was well­

versed.290 Although a knowledge of many of these subjects may have been
acquired later in life, we must assume that his studies were, for the most part,
carried out during the twenty years or so he now spent in Aḥsāʾ and Bahrain.291
Tanakābunī has noted that, when he came to Iran, the shaykh claimed to be
a‘lam and learned in every science.292

That al­Ahsaʾi was well read and felt himself competent to write on a
wide variety of topics (and was asked by others to write on them) is apparent
from many of his writings. Apart from the generally learned content of these,
and their wealth of quotation from books of tradition, the Qurʾan, and other
works, several are specific commentaries on books by other scholars. These
include his commentaries on the Mashāʾir and the ʿArshiyya of Mullā Ṣadrā,293
on the Risāla-yi ʿilmiyya and other writings of Muḥammad ibn Murtaḍā Fayḍ al­
Kāshānī (1598­1680),294 on the last portion of the Kashf al­ghiṭāʾ of Shaykh
Jaʿfar al­Najafī,295 on the Tabṣirat al­mutaʿallimīn fī aḥkām al­dīn of ʿAllāma
al­Ḥillī,296 and on the philosophical poetry of Shaykh ʿAli ibn Abd Allāh ibn
Fāris.297 That a large proportion, if not the bulk, of his reading was done before
he finally left al­Aḥsāʾ is indicated by his earliest ijāza, given him by Shaykh
Aḥmad ibn Ḥasan al-Baḥrānī al-Damastānī298 on 1 Muḥarram 1205/10
September 1790.299 This ijāza indicates that he had become proficient in the
basic religious sciences and had studied several major works of Shiʿi theology;
it permits him to

> Transmit from me all that our ulama have written on the Arabic
> sciences, on literature, grammar, uṣūl, fiqh, and akhbār, in
> particular the Four Books around which we circle in this age… as
> well as the Tafṣīl Wasāʾil al shīʿa [by al­Ḥurr al­ʿĀmilī], the
> Hidāyat al-umma [also by al­Ḥurr al­ʿĀmilī], and the Biḥār al­
> anwār [by Majlisī].300

Although the bulk of al­Ahsaʾi’s writings date from the later period in
Iraq and Iran, he undoubtedly composed several works during his years in al­
Aḥsāʾ. Rashti states that, before leaving there, he wrote risālāt and books which
became well known,301 although he does not supply the titles or indicate the
contents of these. Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh al­Ahsaʾi refers to his father’s first
meeting with Baḥr al­ʿUlūm, stating that the latter asked al­Ahsaʾi for an
example of something he had written, whereupon he was shown some pages of a
commentary on the Tabṣira of Jaʿfar ibn Ḥasan, Muḥaqqiq al­Ḥillī (1205­
1277).302 As we have noted, there is in existence an incomplete commentary by
al­Ahsaʾi entitled Ṣirāṭ al-yaqīn, which corresponds to this description, and we
may presume it to be the same work as that referred to.303 The same source also
speaks of an early risāla on qadr composed about the time al­Ahsaʾi met Baḥr
al­‘Ulūm.304 This may well be the Risāla al­qadriyya, composed at the request
of Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh ibn Dandan in explanation of statements by Sayyid Sharīf

(al-Jurjānī?).305 Several other works of the Shaykh’s are actually dated to this
period or that immediately after.306

After some time, according to Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh, al­Ahsaʾi brought his
family to Bahrain, where they lived for four years. The same source goes on to
say that they remained there until Rajab 1212/December 1798, when the
Shaykh’s mother-in­law died, whereupon he moved to Iraq, later bringing his
family from Bahrain.307 There is, however, a serious difficulty involved in
Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh’s dating: Shaykh Aḥmad’s ijāzas from Āqā Mīrzā
Muḥammad Mahdī Shahristānī (resident in Karbala) and Baḥr al­ʿUlūm
(resident in Najaf) are both dated 1209/1794.308 We should also remember that
the final Wahhabi invasion of al­Aḥsāʾ occurred in 1795, and that it is the
appearance of the Wahhabis which is adduced by Rashti as the reason for al­
Ahsaʾi’s departure for the ʿatabāt.309 The date given for the death of Shaykh
Aḥmad’s mother-in­law may well be correct, but it seems to be misleading in
the context of his departure from Bahrain. A possible explanation is that his
family did not leave Bahrain until her death.

It is, in fact, possible that al­Ahsaʾi left Bahrain well before 1795. In
1788, the Wahhabis under Sulaymān ibn ʿUfaysan had attacked al­Aḥsāʾ and
put the people to the sword. In 1789, the head of the Saʿūdī family, ʿAbd al­
ʿAzīz, himself led a second attack on the province, killing three hundred people
in Fudhūl, defeating the Banū Khālid Sheikh Duwayhis, and installing Zayd ibn
ʿArʿar as the new sheikh. ʿAbd al­ʿAzīz attacked al­Aḥsāʾ again in 1792 and
defeated Barrak ibn ʿAbd al-Muḥsin, who had deposed Zayd. Eventually ʿAbd
al­ʿAzīz was invited by the population of the province to receive their
submission; parties were sent out to destroy Shiʿi tombs and shrines, and steps
were taken to instruct the inhabitants in the tenets of Wahhabism. The populace
of al­Ḥufūf rebelled but, in 1793, Abd al­ʿAzīz returned, captured Shuqayq, laid
siege to Qarayn and al-Maṭayrafī, and carried out widespread plunder
throughout al­Aḥsāʾ.310 Shaykh Aḥmad may well have realized the danger by
the early 1780s and gone to Iraq by the early 1790s, but not before September
1790, the date of his ijāza from Shaykh Aḥmad ibn Ḥasan al­Baḥrānī.

The Years in Iraq

Babi and Bahaʾi writers have tended to regard al­Ahsaʾi’s departure for Iraq—
and, ultimately, Iran—in the early years of the thirteenth century Hegira, as a
decision motivated by a sense of divine mission to purify the decadence of Islam
and to prepare men for the appearance of the Hidden Imām in the person of the
Bab.311 The final reckoning on the validity or otherwise of such a view must, in
the end, rest on criteria which fall outside our present sphere of competence.
Nevertheless, it seems to me worth stating that such an approach involves a
large degree of retrospective interpretation and that it cannot be supported by
known external evidence. None of the Shaykh’s own writings, as far as I am

aware, refers to such a mission, nor do Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti or other Shaykhi
writers regard his journey to Iraq in this light. Rashti, as have observed, refers
specifically to the Wahhabi invasion as the direct cause of al­Ahsaʾi’s departure
from Arabia. It is not unlikely, however, that the Wahhabi threat acted merely as
the final stimulus to a growing urge to visit the ‘atabāt once more.

In the last chapter, we saw that what amounted to a revolution in Twelver
Shiʿi thought was taking place among the Iranian and Arab ulama living at the
shrines in Iraq. It is probable that al­Ahsaʾi, by now more confident of his own
ability to participate in such developments, was no longer satisfied with a
second-hand knowledge of the questions being debated. It is unlikely, however
that he seriously considered playing a leading role in the discussions: his love
for seclusion and his evident distaste for remaining in any one place for very
long strongly suggest that he was a man on whom greatness was thrust much
against his own wishes.

It would seem that Āqā Bihbahānī was either already dead or in virtual
retirement by the time al­Ahsaʾi arrived in Iraq. But, if he did not study under
the murawwij himself, Shaykh Aḥmad certainly did attend the classes of several
of his pupils. As we have mentioned, before his departure from Bahrain, he had
obtained an ijāza from Shaykh Aḥmad ibn al-Ḥasan al-Baḥrānī al­Damastānī, a
pupil of Shaykh Yūsuf Baḥrānī and his brother Shaykh ʿAbd ʿAlī.312 He now
began to seek ijāzāt from several of the contemporaries and pupils of Bihbahānī.
The most outstanding of these was Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī Ṭabāṭabāʾī Baḥr
al­ʿUlūm, whose influence on and contribution to Shiʿi studies in this period
have been discussed briefly in the last chapter. We have referred above to how
al­Ahsaʾi presented Baḥr al­ʿUlūm with part of his commentary on al­Ḥillī’s
Tabṣira and with his risāla on qadr. It is claimed by Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh that, on
seeing the former work, Baḥr al­ʿUlūm said to the Shaykh, “it would be more
appropriate for you to give an ijāza to me.”313 The same source speaks of the
veneration accorded al­Ahsaʾi by Baḥr al­‘Ulūm, and the content and phrasing
of the latter's ijāza to him seem to corroborate this.314 At about the same time,
the Shaykh obtained ijāzāt from two other pupils of Bihbahānī—Shaykh Jaʿfar
ibn Khiḍr al­Najafī Kāshif al­Ghiṭāʾ and Sayyid ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad
Ṭabāṭabā’ī, to both of whom we have referred in the last chapter as being among
the most important ulama of their period.315

In 1209/1794, the same year that he received his ijāza from Baḥr al­
ʿUlūm, al­Ahsaʾi obtained another from Āqā Mīrzā Muḥammad Mahdī ibn Abī
‘l­Qāsim al-Mūsawī al-Shahristānī (d.1215/1800). Born in Shahristān in
Khurāsān, Mīrzā Muḥammad Mahdī had moved to Karbala, where he had
studied under Shaykh Yūsuf al­Baḥrānī and others; he achieved a certain degree
of renown in Anatolia, India, and Iran. A work entitled Al­maṣābīḥ on fiqh is
listed by Iʿjāz Ḥusayn al­Nīsābūrī Kantūrī as belonging to him, but otherwise he
does not seem to have written anything of note.316

Some five years later, al­Ahsaʾi obtained his last ijāza. This was given
him by Shaykh Ḥusayn ibn Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad al-Darāzī al-Baḥrānī
(d.1216/1801). This man was a nephew of Shaykh Yūsuf al­Bahrānī, under
whom he studied in his youth. Shaykh Yūsuf’s Lu’luʾatay al­Baḥrayn being
originally written for him and his brother, Shaykh ʿAbd ʿAlī;317 he later studied
under Yūsuf ‘s brother ʿAbd ʿAlī and is the author of a work entitled al­Anwār
alʿlawāmiʿ.318 It is of interest to note that al­Ahsaʾi regarded Shaykh Ḥusayn as
the murawwij of the twelfth century, as he states in his Risalā wasāʾil al-
hammam al-ulyā, expressly written for him.319 Shaykh Aḥmad’s ijāza from him
is dated 2 Jumadi I 1214/2 October 1799, a date which raises the question as to
how it came into his possession. Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh does not mention a visit to
Bahrain at this point, and the ijāza itself states that Shaykh Ḥusayn was blind
and in ill health by this date and, therefore, unlikely, to have travelled to Iraq,
even to visit the shrines there. Leaving aside the possibility of a faulty
transcription of the date by Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh,320 it could well be that the ijāza
was brought from Bahrain to Iraq by a relative or friend of al­Ahsaʾi’s.

Abu ‘l­Qāsim ibn Zayn al­ʿĀbidīn ibn Karīm (Khān Kirmānī) mentions
an ijāza to Shaykh Aḥmad from Ḥājī Muḥammad Ibrāhīm Kalbāsī,321 but this
may be a mistake since Kalbāsī was a pupil of al­Ahsaʾi and had an ijāza from
him, and not, as far as I know, vice versa. As a further indication of confusion in
this area, Āghā Buzurg al­Ṭihrānī remarks that the statement in Kitāb­i nujūm
al­samāʾ (p. 344) to the effect that one of al­Ahsaʾi’s pupils was Sayyid Muḥsin
al-Aʿrajī (d.1231/1816) is incorrect, and suggests that the Shaykh, in fact,
received an ijāza from the latter.322 Such an ijaza, however, does not seem to be
extant.

An important question arises here: Why did someone who believed
himself to have received ijāzāt from the twelve Imāms, who regarded himself as
the recipient of direct inspiration from them and the Prophet, who showed scant
regard for rank or prestige, and who did not appear to seek any position within
the Shiʿi hierarchy in its accepted form, approach scholars such as Baḥr al­
‘Ulūm in order to receive ijāzāt from them? The answer may be simpler than it
appears. Two major factors have combined to give the false impression that al­
Ahsaʾi stood completely outside the mainstream of Twelver Shiʿism. On the one
hand, as we have observed, there are the unusual circumstances of his early life,
his possible contact with extreme Shiʿi views, his reliance on dreams and
visions, and the absence of teachers within the tradition of transmitted authority.
On the other hand, there is the takfīr pronounced against him towards the end of
his life by several—but by no means all—of the ulama in Iran and Iraq, virtually
excommunicating him from the body of the faithful and certainly creating a new
madhhab where there had not really been one.

As we shall see, however, in the intervening period al­Ahsaʾi did not seek
to dissociate himself from the Usuli tradition, even if his relationship with it was
not, perhaps, one of total identification. Apart from his close association with

leading representatives of that tradition in Karbala, Najaf, Yazd, Isfahan,
Mashhad, and elsewhere, there are other indications of the Shaykh’s general
affinity with the orthodox position. His contempt for Sufism and certain forms
of mystical philosophy, in particular the thought of Ibn al-ʿArabī and Murtaḍā
Fayḍ Kāshānī, his refusal to collaborate closely with the state, and his rejection
of the validity of the takfīr which sought to place him and his followers beyond
the pale—all these demonstrate al­Ahsaʾi’s close bond with traditional Shiʿism.
It is in this context that we should consider the question of his ijāzāt.

The possession of ‘spiritual’ ijāzāt from the Imāms did not, of itself,
invalidate physical ijāzāt from recognized mujtahids. We have already discussed
the role of the ulama as bearers of the charismatic authority of the Imām in his
absence. There is no reason to believe that al­Ahsaʾi had any wish to divorce the
inward inspiration he thought himself to have been given by the Imāms from the
more conventional guidance to be gained from a teacher who provided a living
link with a silsila of teachers going back to the Imāms themselves and, in a
sense, transmitting their baraka to men. More particularly, an ijāza implied
familiarity with the major works of Shiʿi tradition and law, which we have
already identified as one of the main sources of charismatic guidance in the
period of ghayba. That al­Ahsaʾi regarded these works as at least
complementary to his inner inspiration is amply attested by his ijāzāt, which
refer specifically to a large number of works which, it is presumed, he had
studied in depth.323

The relationship between Shaykh Aḥmad’s direct visionary experiences of
the Prophet and the Imāms on the one hand, and his formal links with the
ulama—through reading books, studying and teaching, receiving and granting
ijāzāt—on the other, is a particularly compelling example of the complex
functioning of charisma and authority in Shiʿism. As we have indicated, the
charismatic force of Shiʿism did not reside only in visions and direct inspiration,
but inhered also in the community, in the ulama, and in the system and books of
fiqh and akhbār. Both routinized and direct forms of charisma could co-exist
reasonably easily within a single system or, indeed, individual, and al­Ahsaʾi
clearly saw no inherent contradiction between his receiving ‘spiritual’ ijāzāt
from the Imāms and seeking their physical counterparts from various ulama. It
was only the pronouncement of takfīr towards the end of his life which brought
to the surface the hidden tensions which such a network of values contained.

During the period of his stay at the ʿatabāt and the next few years spent in
Basra and its vicinity, al­Ahsaʾi wrote a number of works, several of which are
dated.324 Like most of his writings, these generally take the form of risālāt
written in reply to various individuals, and deal with a variety of topics, from
statements of Murtaḍā Fayḍ Kāshānī on the nature of fanāʾ325 to questions
relating to ijmāʿ326 and aspects of īmān and kufr.327

Having obtained his ijāzāt, al­Ahsaʾi does not seem to have wanted to
remain in the ʿatabāt. From now until his death, he continued to move from

place to place in Iraq and Iran, sometimes staying for several years in one place
– such as Yazd and Kirmanshah – but never content to settle permanently in any
one town, even in old age. This peripatetic existence was to prove a major factor
in spreading his fame over a very wide area. During the next few years, spurred
on, perhaps, by the growing power of the Wahhabis in the al­Jazīra region, he
travelled restlessly from Basra to Dhū Raqq, back to Basra, to Ḥabārāt, once
more to Basra, then to Tanwiyya, Nashwa, Safāda, and Shaṭṭ al-Kār. In
1221/1806, he set off again for the ʿatabāt.328 The Wahhabi threat was by no
means ended, but resistance to their incursions in the al­Jazīra had hardened
somewhat and the situation appears to have been much safer by the time of the
Shaykh’s visit.329

It was al­Ahsaʾi intention to follow his pilgrimages in the ʿatabāt with a
further ziyāra, this time to Mashhad.330 Whether he was at this time already
considering emigration to Iran, it is hard to tell. Despite somewhat increased
security in Iraq, al­Ahsaʾi continued to be worried by the Wahhabi raids, as is
indicated by Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh.331 Iran, now reasonably secure under the
newly-enthroned Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh (1771­1834), had its attractions, not least of
which was the re-established Shiʿi state which the Qajar dynasty sought to
promote. We shall have to return later to the question of Shaykh Aḥmad’s
relations with the state in Iran; for the moment, we need only suggest that he
may have regarded the protection of the Qajars as an attractive alternative to the
unsettled conditions of Iraq or Bahrain. After visits to Najaf, Karbala, and
Kazimiyya, he set out with several companions for Mashhad.332

Iran 1221-38/1806­22

Shaykh Aḥmad’s first major stop in Iran was Yazd, a town with a continuing
reputation for sanctity, where a large number of ulama resided.333 The religious
zeal, at times turning to fanaticism, of the Yazdis—in part a result of the
existence of a sizeable Zoroastrian community in and around the town—is well
known and, in its more positive aspects, must have created an atmosphere which
al­Ahsaʾi would have found congenial. On his arrival there, he was warmly
welcomed by the inhabitants, in particular the ulama, some of whom he may
have known personally. Kashmīrī states that, when the shaykh arrived in Yazd,
all the ulama honoured him, with the sole exception of Āqā Sayyid Aḥmad
Ardakānī Yazdī.334 According to Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī
was then present in Yazd. Apart from this, two of the ulama mentioned by
Rashti as being in the town at this time had been students of Baḥr al­ʿUlūm not
many years previously. One of these men, Sayyid Ḥaydar ibn Sayyid Ḥusayn
Mūsawī Yazdī (d. ca. 1260/1844),335 had been given his ijāza by Baḥr al­ʿUlūm
in 1209/1794, the same year al­Ahsaʾi had received his. The other, Mullā
Ismāʿīl ibn ʿAbd al­Malik ʿĀqdāʾī Yazdī (d. between 1230/1815 and
1240/1824),336 was the leading mujtahid in Yazd at this time. His student Āqā

Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ʿAlī Kirmānshāhī states in his Mirʾāt al-aḥwāl that he
studied under ʿĀqdā’ī in Najaf in 1210/1795,337 providing evidence that he too
was studying with Baḥr al­ʿUlūm at about the same time as al­Ahsaʾi. It is not
improbable that the latter had at least met these men, a supposition reinforced by
their request that he stay in Yazd, which suggests that they were familiar with
his abilities. It may well be the case that the shaykh’s decision to travel to Yazd
in the first place may have been insoired by an invitation from one or both of
them.

Agreeing to return to Yazd once his pilgrimage was completed, al­Ahsaʾi
continued to Mashhad. His stay there on this occasion appears to have been
brief, and he was soon back in Yazd in accordance with his agreement. It was
not his intention to stay there, however, and, after a few days, he attempted to
leave, but was prevented from so doing by the populace. It is not difficult to
assess the motives of the people of Yazd in wishing the Shaykh to reside there.
The presence of powerful ulama in a town provided a form of insurance against
oppression from local governors and their agents. Ḥasan ibn Ḥasan Fasāʾī (b.
1821) gives an example of such protection in Fārs during the governor­
generalship of Prince Farīdūn Mīrzā Farmān Farmā (1810­1854). The governor­
general had entrusted the administration of the entire province to Mīrzā Aḥmad
Khān Tabrizī, who eventually gained a reputation for favouritism towards
Azerbaijani refugees in the area and injustice towards local inhabitants leading
in the end to the serious riots and political upheavals in Shīrāz which began in
1839\. Fasāʾī points out, however, that “as long as the mujtahid Ḥājī Mīrzā
Ibrāhīm was alive, Mīrzā Aḥmad Khān did not oppress the populace, out of
respect for him.”338

In the case of al­Ahsaʾi’s residence in Yazd, his own increasing fame and
the veneration in which he came to be held by Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh made his
continued sojourn there a matter of considerable importance for the local
population. From al­Ahsaʾi’s point of view, however, the possibility of
becoming embroiled in political affairs was extremely distasteful, and we shall
see later how it proved a significant factor in his decision not to accept the
shah’s offer to reside at the capital.

Since the Shaykh only arrived in Iran in 1221/1806, his fame must have
spread through the country at a remarkable rate, for the Shah began
corresponding with him no later than 1223/1808, and possibly somewhat earlier.
This rapid growth in his reputation suggests that manuscripts of some of his
rasāʾil must by now have been circulating in Iran. In addition, a number of his
works can be assigned to the period of his first stay in Yazd, several of which
indicate the beginnings of what was to develop into a wide correspondence with
various ulama and others throughout the country. 339

As we have indicated, the Shaykh’s fame soon reached the ears of Fatḥ
ʿAlī Shāh, then in about the tenth year of his reign. It is possible that the specific
source of the Shah’s information about al­Ahsaʾi may have been Prince Ibrāhīm

Khān Qājār Quyūnlū, Ẓahīr al­Dawla (d. 1825), a cousin of the monarch and the
governor of Kirman and Baluchistan. Ibrāhīm Khān became a fervent admirer of
the Shaykh; his own son, Ḥājī Muḥammad Karīm Khān Kirmānī, succeeded
Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti as head of the Shaykhi school, while the subsequent
leadership of the main school passed to his descendants. Niʿmat Allāh Raẓavī
Sharīf notes that Ibrāhīm Khān corresponded with al­Ahsaʾi and visited him in
Yazd.340 That it was through the mediation of Ibrāhīm Khān that the name of
Shaykh Aḥmad reached the ears of the king is explicitly stated by Sayyid
Muḥammad Hāshimī Kirmānī,341 and it seems likely that this was the case.

Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh soon addressed several letters to the Shaykh , expressing a
desire to see him in person.342 The motives underlying this wish on the Shah’s
part to pay such close attention to an Arab ʿālim newly arrived in a remote
corner of Iran are not, I think, hard to discern. First of all, there was Fatḥ ʿAlī’s
personal religiosity, which led him to evince a deep­seated veneration for the
ulama, even to the point of submitting to their judgement in certain matters.
There was also his desire to emphasize the Shiʿi character of the new regime, as
evidenced by the large number of religious endowments made by him in Qum,
Shīrāz, Mashhad, and the ʿatabāt, and in his patronage of several outstanding
ulama, such as Mīrzā-yi Qummī, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī, Sayyid Murtaḍā ibn
Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabā’ī, and Mullā Aḥmad Narāqī.343

The reverence, almost subservience, which Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh bore towards
the ulama is evident from the wording of one of his letters to al­Ahsaʾi, as
quoted by Āqā Sayyid Ḥusayn Yazdī in al­Kashkūl. In this letter, the Shah, after
addressing the Shaykh with the customary hyperboles, writes: “We desire to
meet you as the one fasting desires the new moon, as the thirsty longs for pure
waters, as the husband is eager for his wife, and the destitute for wealth…” He
then invites him to set out immediately for Tehran so that he may benefit from
his presence and obtain illumination from him.344 Despite the courteous tone of
this letter – the Arabic original of which would not, of course have been penned
by the shah himself – the “invitation” to come to the capital is, in reality,
nothing but a veiled command. At this stage, however, pressure to go to Tehran
was not sufficiently great to compel compliance, and al­Ahsaʾi made various
excuses for his inability to leave Yazd.345

At that same time, he did reply to certain questions put to him by the
Shah; his answers are contained in the Risāla al­khāqāniyya, dated early
Ramadan 1223/late October 1808.346 It is of interest to compare the somewhat
superficial questions put by the Shah at this time with the two he put to al­
Ahsaʾi some ten years later, after the latter’s return to Kirmanshah in 1234/1818,
and which the Shaykh answered in his Risāla al­sulṭāniyya.347 These two
questions, which deal with the distinction between the Imām and the stations of
nubuwwa and wilāya, indicate a growing knowledge of religious matters on the

shah’s part, and suggest that his interest in theology, if not profound, was at least
serious.

The receipt of the Risāla al­khāqāniyya seems to have whetted the Shah’s
appetite and made him even more eager to have al­Ahsaʾi come to Tehran; a
letter was soon sent expressing this wish in particularly strong terms. This letter
was brought to Yazd by one of the members of the court, Mīrzā Muḥammad
Nadīm,348 and, according to Rashti, the Shah’s instructions were communicated
to al­Ahsaʾi through the governor of Yazd.349 Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh gives a
synopsis of this letter, in which the shah declares that it is his own duty to visit
the Shaykh but that, for various reasons, it is not in his power to do so, and that
he asks pardon for this. He goes on to say that, if he should have to make a
personal visit to Yazd, he should have to bring with him at least ten thousand
soldiers; since Yazd is a valley without much cultivation, the arrival of so many
troops would result in famine for the inhabitants. The shah ends by expressing
his humility towards Shaykh Aḥmad, and politely asks him to visit him as soon
as he receives this letter – “otherwise I shall have no choice but to come to Yazd
(dār al-ʿibāda).”350 The thinly-veiled threat is obvious: the effects of ṣādirāt—
irregular and arbitrary levies imposed on towns or provinces on such occasions
as a royal visit—were too well known to require elaboration.351 The letter was,
in effect, an ultimatum.

Faced with the choice of either becoming involved with the court or
bringing famine to Yazd, al­Ahsaʾi determined to quit Iran altogether. He
decided to leave for Shīrāz, planning to take that route back to Basra, but, when
the people of Yazd heard of this, they prevented his departure. The threat of a
royal visit was serious enough, but, on the other hand, if the Shah thought they
had encouraged him to go in fear of that threat, there was the more serious risk
of their incurring royal displeasure and being punished. It was, in any case, the
winter season and travel would be difficult.352

The problem remained as to how to reply to the Shah. A meeting of the
leading citizens was held, but they could think of no solution. Al­Ahsaʾi
pointed, out that, if he were to excuse himself from going, the shah would come
and cause great distress in the region, but, if, on the other hand, he were to
promise to go, he would be prevented by the cold from actually travelling to the
capital. By this point, the Yazdis seem to have been seriously alarmed about the
possible consequences of a continual refusal on the part of the Shaykh to go to
Tehran, and sufficient pressure was at last applied to make him relent and agree
to go. It was arranged that Mīrzā ʿAlī Riḍā,353 a mujtahid, would accompany
him to the capital and ensure that he suffered no discomfort on the way.354 It is
probable that Mīrzā ʿAlī Riḍā’s real function was to make sure that the Shaykh
did not attempt to take another route back to Iraq.

Shaykh Aḥmad and his companion proceeded directly to Tehran, arriving
around November 1808.355 He had frequent meetings with the Shah while there
and wrote several rasāʾil in reply to various questions put by him.356 Rashti

notes that the Shaykh was visited by all the ulama and ṭullāb then living in the
capital;357 they were probably as much attracted by his standing in the eyes of
the king, however, as by his reputation as an ʿālim. As a result of their
association, the shah’s admiration for the Shaykh increased; the latter, however,
felt he had fulfilled his obligation to the king, quickly wearied of Tehran, and
decided to leave. Continuing Wahhabi attacks in the neighbourhood of Basra
were a constant cause of concern to him since most of his wives and children
were still resident there. The shah, however, tried to prevent his departure and
eventually succeeding in persuading him to stay in Iran, arguing that he could
not openly make his knowledge known in Iraq (presumably because it was a
Sunni-governed country).358 Having succeeded in this, Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh began to
apply pressure on the Shaykh to live in the capital, offering to put a house at his
disposal there.359 This offer was tactfully but forcefully refused.

Fatḥ ʿAlī had probably intended from the beginning to ask al­Ahsaʾi to
stay in Tehran. The invitation accorded with his general policy of encouraging
ulama to live in the new capital.360 Men such as Ḥājī Mullā Muḥammad Jaʿfar
Astarābādī,361—later the author of a polemic against al­Ahsaʾi—Sayyid
Muḥammad Ḥasan Qazvīnī Shīrāzī,362 Mullā Muḥammad ʿAlī Māzandarānī
Jangalī,363 and others were invited to come to Tehran in an attempt to raise the
prestige of the city and of the dynasty which had made it its capital, as well as to
encourage the development of a centre of religious authority close to and allied
with the seat of government—distinct from the ʿatabāt, which were outside the
borders of Iran. Fatḥ ʿAlī’s policy was destined to failure. The ʿatabāt retained
their influence, increasing in importance through the nineteenth century and, in
Iran itself, Isfahan, Mashhad, and, in particular, Qum remained the centres of
religious studies. Although the number of ulama resident in the capital greatly
increased in the reign of Nāṣir al­Dīn Shāh (1831­1896),364 not even men such
as Mullā ʿAlī Kanī, Shaykh Faḍl Allāh Nūrī (d. 1909), Sayyid ʿAbd Allah
Bihbahānī, and Āqā Sayyid Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabā’ī were able to make Tehran a
religious capital such as Isfahan had been under the Safavids.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s reason for not staying in Tehran, as explained to Fatḥ
ʿAlī, is of great interest in helping us understand how the ulama in this period
regarded the secular authority of the Qajars. We may assume that the version of
this reply given by Shaykh Abd Allah is tolerably accurate, in view of the fact
that it agrees in substance with that given in the Tārīkh­i ʿAẓudī. The Shaykh
argued that, were he to remain at the capital, it would mean the end of the
Shah’s power (salṭanat). When asked why this would be the case, al­Ahsaʾi
inquired of the Shah whether he (al­Ahsaʾi) should live in honour or disgrace.
When Fatḥ ʿAlī replied that he should live in the greatest honour, the Shaykh
said

> In my opinion, kings and governors execute their orders and their
> laws through tyranny. Since the masses regard me as someone

whose word is to be obeyed, they would turn to me in all matters
> and would seek refuge with me. Now, it is incumbent on me to
> defend the people of Islam and to fulfil their needs. Were I to seek
> intercession for them from the king, one of two things would occur:
> either he would accept [my intercession], thereby suspending the
> operation of his authority, or he would refuse it, thus causing me to
> be humiliated and disgraced.365
This argument did not fail to impress the shah, who could not have been
unaware of the counter-threat it contained. We have already noted how it lay in
the power of certain ulama to force the hand of the Shah in cases of injustice and
oppression. Perhaps more than any particular incident of the period, al­Ahsaʾi’s
warning to Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh prefigures the later expression of clerical opposition
to the throne during the Tobacco Regie, in the Constitutional movement, and
even in the 1979 revolution.366 Fatḥ ʿAlī immediately offered al­Ahsaʾi freedom
of choice in his place of residence, but the latter chose, curiously enough, to
return to Yazd.

It is, I think, worth noting the role played by this visit in the later
hagiographic Bahaʾi version of the incident, as originated by Zarandī.367 For this
writer and others after him, such as William Sears and H. M. Balyuzi, the visit is
fraught with overtones of messianic expectation. Al­Ahsaʾi, far from being
reluctant to travel there, sets out for the capital because he perceives “the first
glimmerings that heralded the dawn of the promised Dispensation from the
direction of Nūr, to the north of Tehran.”368 He leaves the city with the greatest
reluctance, wishing to spend the rest of his life there.369 In order to give full
force to this interpretation of the event, Zarandī makes the visit coincide with the
birth of Bahāʾ Allāh (Mīrzā Ḥusayn ʿAlī Nūrī, 1817­1892), which occurred in
Tehran on 2 Muharram 1223/12 November 1817, a date which is simply
impossible. Other contradictions occur, such as Zarandī’s statement that al­
Ahsaʾi was accompanied on the journey by Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti and that he left
Tehran directly for Kirmanshah. The whole effect is one of tendentiousness of
the most extreme kind, making this version of the incident—which has acquired
an important place in Bahaʾi historical myth—of considerable interest as an
example of how a controversial religious figure may be adopted and
transmogrified into a character of messianic import by a later movement with
which he may have only the most tenuous connection.

Although al–Aḥsāʾī did not go to Kirmanshah at this point, he did become
acquainted with Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā Dawlatshāh (1788­1822), who was later
to be his patron there for several years. Since the prince was at that time already
governor­general of Arabistan, Ḥawīza, and their dependencies,370 he offered to
send one of his agents from Arabistan to Basra in order to bring the Shaykh’s
family to Yazd. The prince wrote a farmān to the governor of Basra, Ibrāhīm
Āqā, asking him to give his agent the necessary authority to carry this out on his
arrival—an interesting example of the influence of this young prince within the

borders of Iraq.371 Al­Ahsaʾi himself returned to Yazd not later than 19 Ṣafar
1224/5 April 1809, as is clear from a letter written there and bearing this date.372

Al­Ahsaʾi spent the next five years in Yazd,373 with the exception of at
least two pilgrimages to Mashhad in 1226/1811374 and 1229/1814.375 It is stated
by a number of sources that he produced the bulk of his writings during this
period,376 most of these being, it seems, replies to the numerous letters which
now began to arrive from ulama in many places. However, on the evidence of
those letters which are dated, it would seem that fewer were written in this
period than during the Shaykh’s later stay in Kirmanshah—although it would be
unwise at this stage to regard this as a wholly reliable means of assessing the
distribution of his writings from different periods.

It is, in any case, clear that the dissemination of the Shaykh’s writings
during his stay in Yazd gained him an increasingly large following there and in
Fārs, Khurāsān, and Isfahan.377 His visits to Mashhad brought him into contact
with numerous ulama, and the high estimation in which he was held by the
scholars resident there must, in its turn, have spread by means of the pilgrims
with whom they spoke.378 Al­Ahsaʾi’s ideas seem to have made their way to a
very wide audience, as is suggested by Rashti, when he speaks, significantly, of
how some of the topics dealt with by the Shaykh—topics which were not at first
clear to anyone outside his circle, (ghayr-i ahlish)—became current among the
masses, ‘and day by day people became eager and enthusiastic about those
topics and remained awestruck when they heard them mentioned.”379

This situation appears to have led to some misunderstanding, for the
Shaykh himself at one point gave instructions for someone to preach from the
pulpit on the orthodoxy of his views on the relationship between outward and
inward beliefs (ẓāhir wa bāṭin).380 Although the details of this incident are
unclear, it is likely that we have here the beginnings of what was to develop into
serious opposition to the views of al­Ahsaʾi, leading in the end to the takfīr
pronounced against him in his final years.

A few days after his return from a pilgrimage to Mashhad in 1229/1814,
despite an earlier intention to stay in Yazd,381 Shaykh Aḥmad determined to visit
the ʿatabāt, travelling via Shūstar. Rashti states that the reason for his departure
from Yazd was a dream of the Imām ʿAlī inviting him to perform a pilgrimage
to al­Kufa.382 Karīm Khān Kirmānī, however, gives a more cogent reason in
stating that the Shaykh was distressed by the behaviour of some notables in
Yazd, who did not appreciate his importance and were lax in showing respect.383
A more important reason—and very possibly the cause of al­Ahsaʾi’s
displeasure with the above notables—may well have been an invitation from
Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā to go to Kirmanshah.

Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh describes his father’s arrival in Kirmanshah as
unpremeditated and unexpected, and states that the prince’s invitation to stay
was spontaneous—but this does not seem to be consistent with the reality of the
situation. Al­Ahsaʾi cannot have been unaware of the implications of his going

to Kirmanshah, the seat of the most powerful and ambitious prince in the
kingdom. Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā, for his part, is unlikely to have relied on
chance to bring such an important religious figure—and one, as we have seen,
already indebted to him—to his capital. The willingness of the Shaykh to stay in
Kirmanshah and the subsequent length of his sojourn there also suggest a
previous decision to accept a formal invitation from the prince. Further evidence
that this was the case is provided by Muḥammad ʿAlī Kashmīrī, who states that
the prince gave Shaykh Aḥmad the sum of one thousand tomans for his
travelling expenses to the city.384

Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh’s policy of inviting important religious personages to live
in Tehran was emulated by many of the royal princes in the hope of raising the
prestige of their provincial capitals.385 Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā made a particular
point of increasing the importance of Kirmanshah. Sir Robert Kerr Porter
remarks of the city that

> The population amounts to about 15,000 families, some few of
> which are Christians and Jews; the views of its governor inclining
> him to draw into his city, and to disperse through the whole range
> of his government, those sorts of persons most likely to increase his
> revenues, and to spread, his general influence.386

The invitation to Shaykh Aḥmad fitted in well with the prince’s general
aims, but it is less easy to understand the motives of the former in accepting. Al­
Ahsaʾi, whatever his stated reservations about close identification with secular
authority, was not actually averse to associating with representatives of the state,
as is attested by his cordial relations, not only with Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh and
Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā, but also with Prince Maḥmud Mīrzā, Muʿizz al­Mulk
(1799­1853), with whom he corresponded,387 Prince Mīrzā ʿAbd Allāh Khān,
Amīn al­Dawla, with whom he stayed in Isfahan,388 Prince Ibrāhīm Khān, Ẓahīr
al­Dawla (d. 1825), and possibly even ʿAbbās Mīrzā (1789­1833), who is
described as one of his admirers.389 At the same time, the close attachment of
Ibrāhīm Khān cannot have been without its attendant problems in the form of
sycophants on the one hand and political rivals on the other. The later
difficulties in Kirman which followed on the death of Ibrāhīm Khān, and the
more serious religio­political disturbances on the death of Karīm Khān Zand (d.
1750) indicate how problematic such relations could become.390

Despite an attempt to prevent his departure by the governor of Yazd,
Shaykh Aḥmad succeeded in leaving for Kirmanshah, travelling by way of
Isfahan, where he stayed for forty days.391 During this period, he associated with
the leading ulama of the city and their pupils, and was requested to stay there
permanently.392 Citing the dream which had spurred him to travel to the ʿatabāt,
al­Ahsaʾi made his excuses and prepared to leave; at this point, a deputation
from Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā arrived to bring him to Kirmanshah, and, in

compliance with the prince’s request, he set off from Isfahan.393 The very fact
that the prince knew he would be there is itself highly suggestive of a prior
arrangement.

News of his impending arrival reached Kirmanshah, and the prince and
townspeople went out about two stages to welcome him. Following the istiqbāl,
tents were pitched at Chāh Kalān outside the city.394 At this point, whether for
the first time—as is claimed, but seems unlikely—or as a reiteration,
Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā invited al­Ahsaʾi to stay in his capital, adducing as his
reasons “the good pleasure of God; the nearness of your excellency; and my
distinction among others and exaltation among them.”395 No doubt the true order
of motivation was exactly the reverse. The Shaykh argued that he had left Yazd
out of a longing to visit the ʿatabāt, but the prince immediately agreed to pay the
expenses for an annual pilgrimage to the shrines. Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh states that
he also offered to accompany the Shaykh there every year, but it is highly
unlikely, in view of the prince’s relations with the government in Baghdad, that
this was intended seriously.396

Exactly how many of the Shaykh’s expenses were, in the end, undertaken
by Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā is very hard to determine. Tanakābunī states that al­
Ahsaʾi had debts and that the prince asked him to sell him a gate of paradise for
one thousand tomans, and that the Shaykh did so, writing out a bond for the
gate.397 According to Kashmīrī, as mentioned above, the prince gave al­Ahsaʾi
one thousand tomans for the journey from Yazd. The same source states that the
prince also paid him a stipend of seven hundred tomans per month,398 although
Tanakābunī maintains that this was his annual allowance.399 It is also worth
noting that it has been stated—almost certainly without foundation—that Fatḥ
ʿAlī Shāh gave al­Ahsaʾi the enormous sum of one hundred thousand tomans
with which to pay off his debts.400 The figure in question is improbably high, but
it is not impossible that the king at one time gave a smaller sum to the Shaykh.
That the latter may have incurred heavy debts more than once is suggested by
Abu ‘l­Qāsim ibn Zayn al­ʿĀbidīn ibn Karīm, who states that he gave away his
entire wealth twice in his life; he was, it seems, about to do so again when he
saw Fatima in a dream and was dissuaded from such a course.401 It is not
impossible that al­Ahsaʾi, his commitments growing, may have found himself in
debt in Yazd and gone to Kirmanshah expressly to live under a patron with
sufficient resources to support him.

Shaykh Aḥmad entered Kirmanshah on 2 Rajab 1229/20 June 1814. His
initial stay there lasted over two years: in 1232/1817, he performed what appears
to have been his first pilgrimage to Mecca.402 Returning by way of Najaf and
Karbala, the Shaykh decided to stay for a while at the ʿatabāt; he remained there
for a total of eight months, associating with several important ulama, including
ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad Ṭabātabāʾī and Mīrzā­yi Qummī.403 It seems that some
doubts were expressed at about this time as to the orthodoxy of the Shaykh’s
beliefs, since some of his rasaʾil were shown to Ṭabāṭabāʾī with the request that

he comment on their acceptability. He kept the rasāʾil in question for two days
and, on the third day, expressed the opinion that their contents were perfectly
orthodox.404 In view of later developments, this expression of approval from a
champion of the orthodox Usuli position such as Ṭabāṭabāʾī is highly
significant. It seems, incidentally, that it was in this period that al­Ahsaʾi taught
the Risāla al­ʿilmiyya of Murtaḍā Fayḍ al­Kāshānī in the Shrine of Ḥusayn in
Karbala.405

Shaykh Aḥmad returned to Kirmanshah on 4 Muḥarram 1234/3

November 1818.406 There he stayed, with the possible exception of some visits
to the ʿatabāt, until one year after the death of Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā
in1237/1821. During the years he spent in Kirmanshah, he added considerably
to his output of treatises and commentaries. Several works are dated as having
been written during his first stay of over two years. The most important of these
is the monumental and central Sharḥ al­ziyāra al­jāmiʿa al­kabīra dated
1230/1815.407 Comprising 34,000 bayts in four volumes, this work is probably
the most important single source for the Shaykh’s doctrines, particularly with
regard to the station of the Imāms.

Soon after the completion of this massive work, al­Ahsaʾi wrote a
commentary of over 2,500 bayts on the Risāla al­ʿilmiyya of Murtaḍā Fayḍ al­
Kāshānī just referred to above.408 At least one work was written by the Shaykh
during his stay in Karbala in 1233/1818; this is a risāla written at the request of
one of his followers on his own Sharḥ al­fawāʾid.409 On his return to
Kirmanshah, he continued this prodigious output. Among the most interesting
works produced during this period are: al­Risāla al­sulṭānīyya, written in reply
to two questions from Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh, less than one month after his return to the
city;410 the lengthy and important Sharḥ al­Mashāʾir, written in 1234/1818 for a
certain Mullā Mashhad;411 the even lengthier and more influential Sharḥ al­
ʿArshiyya, written in 1236/1821.412 As well as major works such as these, the
Shaykh continued to pen numerous, often lengthy, replies to questions from
ulama and laymen in a variety of places.413

In 1237/1821, war broke out between the Ottoman Empire and Iran.414

Although most of the fighting was under the command of ʿAbbās Mīrzā, who
achieved several important successes on the Kurdish frontier, Muḥammad ʿAlī
Mīrzā also set out with a large force to attack Baghdad. Having come within a
short distance of his objective, he died on 26 Ṣafar 1237/22 November 1821.415
His son, Prince Muḥammad Ḥusayn Mīrzā, Hishmat al­Dawla (d. 1845), was
appointed governor of Kirmanshah in his father’s place.416 The removal of
Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā was, however, a severe blow to the region, and
conditions began to dec1ine seriously, being aggravated by a heavy flood which
destroyed a quarter of Kirmanshah about this time.417 Al­Ahsaʾi remained in the
city for a further year,418 but, in 1238/1822, plague entered Iran from China and
India, bringing widespread infection and a high mortality rate.419 The Shaykh
decided to leave Kirmanshah, but not, apparently, to escape the plague (unless

he thought to avoid it by heading where it had been), since he set off towards
Mashhad, travelling by way of Qum and Qazvīn.

The Period of Takfīr 1238­41/1822­6

Although there is no direct evidence, it would seem that it was at this time that
al­Ahsaʾi stayed for a short time in Qazvīn and had the serious disagreement
with Mullā Muḥammad Taqī Baraghānī (d. 1847) which led to the
pronouncement of takfīr against him. Muḥammad Taqī was the oldest of three
brothers originally from Baraghān near Tehran. Descended from a family of
ulama which dated back to the Buwayhid period, he was born about
1173/1760.420 He first studied in Qazvīn, then in Qum, where he attended some
classes given by Mīrzā­yi Qummī; disliking these, he went to Isfahan, where he
studied ḥikma and kalām, and then to the ʿatabāt, where he was taught by Āqā
Sayyid ʿAlī Ṭabāṭabāʾī, Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī, and Muḥammad ʿAlī
Ṭabāṭabāʾī. When the last­named came to Iran in 1242/1826 to lead the second
jihad against Russia, he visited Qazvīn, where he gave an ijāza to Muḥammad
Taqī Baraghānī; both Taqī and his brother Muḥammad Ṣālih Baraghānī (d. ca.
1853) were among the ulama who went on the jihad. He later spent some time in
Tehran, but, following a disagreement with Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh, returned to Qazvīn,
where he eventually became Imām Jumʿa, achieving particular recognition as
one of the best preachers of his day. He composed a number of works, of which
the best known are the Kitāb manhaj al­ijtihād (in twenty­four volumes) and the
Majālis al­muttaqīn, attaining some fame as a writer on the sufferings of the
Imāms. Iʿtimād al­Salṭana writes that he and his two brothers were “among the
great ulama of the Qajar state.”421

In later years, Muḥammad Taqī won considerable notoriety as the leading
opponent of the Shaykhi school in Iran; as a result of this opposition and his
subsequent stand against Babism, he was murdered on 15 Dhu ‘l­Qaʿda 1263/25
October 1847, apparently by three men, one a Shaykhi, one a Babi, and one a
Shaykhi with strong Babi leanings.422 The circumstances of his assassination
earned for him the title of Shahīd­i Thālith, the Third Martyr.423

A reasonably detailed account of al­Ahsaʾi’s visit to Qazvīn and his
dispute with Baraghānī is given by Tanakābunī, a pupil and supporter of the
latter. During his stay, Shaykh Aḥmad was a guest of the then Imām Jumʿa,
Mullā ʿAbd al­Wahhāb Qazvīnī (d. 1847), apparently because the latter sent
ahead an invitation to Hamadān 424 and not improbably because he already had a
special interest in the Shaykh’s views.425 Murtaẓā Mudarrisī Chahārdihī has
suggested, not, perhaps, without some justice, that Baraghānī, believing himself
to be the most learned of the Shiʿi ulama, felt slighted that al­Ahsaʾi had not
chosen to be his guest during his visit.426 That this may have been the case
seems confirmed by Baraghānī’s own son, Shaykh Jaʿfar Qazvīnī (d. 1888), the
only one of his children to become a Shaykhi.427

Baraghānī seems to have been an ambitious man,428 and this apparent
slight by someone as important as al­Ahsaʾi was not calculated to further his
interests. He was, moreover, a man ever ready to enter into disagreements with
other ulama, and had crossed swords on more than one occasion with several
important scholars, including Mīrzā­yi Qummī, Āqā Sayyid ʿAlī Ṭabāṭabāʾī,
Mullā ʿAbd al­Wahhāb Qazvīnī, Mullā Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Mahdī Narāqī
Kāshānī, and Mullā Muḥammad ʿAlī Jangalī.429 At one time, as we have noted,
he even had a serious disagreement wth the shah himself, as a result of which he
left Tehran.430

It is important to realize that it was with such a strongly­opinionated man
as this that al­Ahsaʾi’s takfīr originated. Until his disagreement with Baraghānī,
there had been little question of the Shaykh’s orthodoxy and, even if some
individuals had rejected his views and one or two openly disputed them, only the
most tentative suggestions had been made that they might be heretical.431 Had
Baraghānī not pronounced the sentence of takfīr and made assiduous efforts to
circulate it in Iran and at the ʿatabāt, it is probable that Shaykhism as a distinct
school might never have come into existence and that later interpretations of al­
Ahsaʾi’s thought would have taken a different direction more in harmony with
the mainstream of contemporary Shiʿi thinking. Had that happened, it is highly
improbable that the Shaykh’s theories would have been able to function as a
matrix for the speculations of the Bab and his followers.

Tanakābunī describes in detail the incidents which led to Baraghānī’s
condemnation of al­Ahsaʾi. At the beginning of his stay in Qazvīn, the Shaykh
went to the Masjid­i Jumʿa, where he performed ṣalāt along with Mullā ʿAbd al­
Wahhāb and the other ulama of the city, except for Baraghānī.432 One day, he
went to visit Muḥammad Taqī, probably in order to placate his feelings after his
imagined snub. A heated discussion soon began on the topic of resurrection
(maʿād), centered on al­Ahsaʾi’s view that man has four bodies (two jasad and
two jism) and that, of the two jasad, only that composed of the elements of the
interworld of Hurqalyā would survive physical death as a vehicle for the
resurrection of the two jism. Baraghānī, in common with the most orthodox
ulama, simply maintained that resurrection would take place in an earthly,
elemental body.

Confirmation that the topic round which this disagreement revolved was
that of resurrection is to be found in a letter from al­Ahsaʾi to Mullā ʿAbd al­
Wahhāb Qazvīnī, in which he states that “Shaykh Shaqī [i.e., Taqī]433 had
discovered references in one of his books to man’s two bodies (jasadayn), one
of which will return in the resurrection and the other of which will not.” “Satan,”
writes al­Ahsaʾi, “inspired Shaqī and he declared ‘this is unbelief (kufr) and he
[al­Ahsaʾi] is an unbeliever (kāfir), and Ākhūnd Mullā ʿAbd al­Wahhāb has
prayed behind an unbeliever’.”434 Later that day, when Shaykh Aḥmad went to
the Masjid­i Jumʿa, only Abd al­Wahhāb accompanied him. Baraghānī seems to
have issued his fatwā of takfīr almost immediately, and soon had it spread

throughout Qazvīn and even printed in the Dār al­Ṭabʿa there,435 making of it,
quite possibly, the first fatwā of its kind printed in Iran.

An attempt was made to save the situation by the governor of Qazvīn,
Prince ʿAlī Naqī Mīrzā, Nawwāb­i Amīn al­Mulk, Rukn al­Dawla (b. 1793), a
son of Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh.436 Tanakābunī says he acted to heal the breach because it
would give a bad reputation to the town and, significantly, because it would
displease the shah. Rukn al­Dawla invited the ulama to dine with him one night
and, while they were there, reprimanded Baraghānī for his behaviour, stating
that al­Ahsaʾi was the most important of the ulama of the Arabs and Persians,
and should be treated with honour. But Baraghānī refused to retract his
accusation.437 Such interference in a purely theological matter by a local
governor is possibly unique in the history of the period and throws an interesting
light on the relations of the state and the religious institution in the early Qajar
era.

Although Rukn al­Dawla’s intercession failed to mollify Baraghānī, it
does seem to have been instrumental in easing the situation somewhat with
regard to other ulama. According to Shaykh Jaʿfar Qazvīnī (b. 1806?), who was
present at the time, the governor persuaded al­Ahsaʾi to stay a further ten days in
Qazvīn. The Shaykh stayed at Darb Kūshk near the town and continued to lead
the prayers either there or in the Masjid­i Jumʿa. On one occasion, the prince
came with five thousand notables, ulama, merchants, tradesmen, and others to
attend prayers outside the city.438

According to Tanakābunī, the reasons for the declaration of takfīr were
three: the Shaykh’s views on resurrection (maʿād), on the ascension of the
Prophet (miʿrāj), and on the nature of the Imāms.439 As the takfīr was taken up
by several other ulama, the charges made came to include further points. Rashti
mentions some of these in his Dalīl al­mutaḥayyirīn: it was claimed that al­
Ahsaʾi had said that all the ulama from al­Shaykh al­Mufid (d. 413/1022) to his
own contemporaries were in error and that the Mujtahidī (Uṣūlī) school was
false; that he regarded ʿAlī as the Creator; that he held all Qurʾanic phrases
referring to God as really being references to ʿAlī; that he spoke of God as
uninformed of particulars and maintained that He had two forms of knowledge,
one old (qadīm) and one new (ḥadīth); and that he did not believe the Imām
Ḥusayn to have been killed.440 Rashti refers to these charges (some of which are
merely the stock­in­trade of the heresiologists) as ‘absurdities’ and cites a
sermon attributed to the Shaykh in which they are severally refuted. After the
death of al­Ahsaʾi, however, an even greater number of heretical and quasi­
heretical views were attributed to him.441 Muḥammad Ḥusayn Shahristānī’s
Taryāq­i fārūq contains no fewer than forty points of disagreement, many of
them extremely factitious.

The validity or otherwise of some or all of these charges is, however,
irrelevant. Without the takfīr it is likely that al­Ahsaʾi would have continued to
be regarded as no more heterodox than Mullā Ṣadrā or others among the

‘philosopher­theologians’ of the Safavid period.442 Tanakābunī maintains that
the underlying reason behind the takfīr was that al­Ahsaʾi tried to combine sharʿ
with ḥikma and to harmonize rational (maʿqūl) ideas with those derived from
tradition (manqūl);443 but, as Hāshimī Kirmānī has observed, it was really the
takfīr which prevented his being regarded as a Fayḍ Kāshānī or a Mullā
Ṣadrā,444 whose achievement was precisely that of combining ḥikma with
orthodox religious views.

Had Baraghānī alone pronounced takfir, it is unlikely that it would have
had much effect outside Qazvīn and, thanks to the intervention of Rukn Dawla,
probably very little even there. Baraghānī’s stature as an ʿālim was not
sufficiently great for him to expect his fatwā to be widely respected without his
winning the support of other, more eminent ulama. He, therefore, wrote letters to
scholars at the ʿatabāt, informing them that he had pronounced the takfīr;445 a
number of them joined him in the attack on al­Ahsaʾi. Several individuals went
to Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī Ṭabāṭabāʾī (d.1249/1833), a son of Āqā Sayyid
ʿAli, and presented him with certain passages from the works of Shaykh Aḥmad
which they claimed to be heretical.446 Although his brother, Āqā Sayyid
Muḥammad, the leader of the jihād against Russia in 1826, was more eminent,
Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī was highly respected, to the extent that he was able
to show open defiance towards Muḥammad Shah (1808­1848) during his last
visit to Tehran.447 Under Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī’s leadership, a meeting was
held, at which a large number of ulama attended to draw up a fatwā announcing
al­Ahsaʾi’s takfīr. According to Rashti, no sooner had they begun to write the
takfir than an earthquake occurred and the meeting dispersed.448

Tanakābunī gives a list of those ulama who pronounced takfir against the
Shaykh: Mullā Muḥammad Taqī Baraghānī, Āqā Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī
Ṭabāṭabāʾī, Mullā Muḥammad Jaʿfar Astarābādī (known as Sharīʿatmadār)
(d.1263/1847),449 Mullā Āqā Darbandī (d.1286/1869),450 Mullā Muḥammad
Sharīf (Sharīf al­ʿUlamāʾ Māzandarānī) ( d. 1246/1831),451 Āqā Sayyid Ibrāhīm
Qazvīnī Karbalāʾī (d. 1246/1830), 452 Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥusayn Qazvīnī (d.
1254/1838),453 and Muḥammad Ḥasan ibn Bāqir al­Najafī.454 Rashti, however,
states that the true originators of the takfīr were only three individuals, one in
Karbala and two in Najaf; Baraghānī he does not mention at all.455

According to al­Ahsaʾi, large sums of money were spent to ensure that the
takfir would obtain as wide a currency and acceptance as possible.456 His
opponents went so far as to send the fourth part of his Sharḥ al­ziyāra al­jāmiʿa
al­kabīra, containing passages offensive to Sunni sensibilities, to the governor
of Baghdad, who had recently put to death the uncle of Shaykh Mūsā ibn Jaʿfar
al­Najāfi for less serious remarks.457 That such a foolhardy act could even have
been contemplated is a telling measure of the lengths to which the Shaykh’s
opponents were prepared to go in order to discredit him. Chahārdihī maintains
that the ulama of Karbala and Najaf became “more audacious” after the takfīr of

al­Ahsaʾi and started to excommunicate anyone who began to gain leadership
and of whom they were afraid.458

The condemnation of al­Ahsaʾi and the forcible creation of Shaykhism as
a separate madhhab from the main body of Shiʿism seems to have been
necessary in the absence of a target to take the place of the Akhbari school. By
attacking the Shaykhis, it was possible for the Usulis to define further their own
position, and very soon the Shaykhi /Bālāsarī division came to replace that
between Usuli and Akhbari,459 to be replaced in its turn by the Shiʿi/Babi and
Shiʿi/ Bahaʾi divisions of later years – each stage representing a sharper and
fuller division than the one before.

At the same time, it must be remembered that, as Corbin has pointed out,
the pronouncement of takfīr did not represent a declaration of excommunication
from the body of an established church, but was, rather, the personal initiative of
Baraghānī in the first instance.460 It is as important to note the names of those
leading ulama who did not pronounce takfīr as it is to mention those who did.
Men such as Mullā Muḥammad Bāqir Shaftī, Mullā ʿAlī ibn Jamshīd Nūrī, Ḥājī
Muḥammad Ibrāhīm Kalbāsī, Āqā Sayyid Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabāʾī and others
were hesitant to condemn the Shaykh, and either continued to admire him
openly or adopted a neutral stance in the matter.461

It was some time, however, before the takfīr became widely known, and
al­Ahsaʾi left Qazvīn with considerable honour, accompanied by an entourage of
some seventy people.462 Travelling by way of Tehran, he visited Shāhrūd, Ṭūs,
and Mashhad, where he stayed for twenty­eight days before leaving for Yazd via
Turbat­i Haydariyyeh and Ṭabas.463 Throughout this journey, al­Ahsaʾi was
treated with great respect by local governors, and was even given an escort of
one hundred horsemen and two hundred infantry to accompany him from Ṭabas
to Yazd.464 After three months there, he set off for Isfahan, where he was
welcomed by the ulama and nobles of the city and made the guest of ʿAbd Allāh
Khān, Amīn al­Dawla, as mentioned earlier. Although he planned to leave after
only a short stay, he was prevailed upon to extend his visit over the coming
month of Ramadan, since his performing the fast there would bring baraka to
the city and its inhabitants. He agreed to stay and sent his “unnecessary baggage
and his wives” to Kirmanshah with Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh, who then returned to
Isfahan. Large crowds came to visit him there, and, on one occasion, the number
of people performing ṣalāt behind him reached sixteen thousand.465 It is likely
that on this occasion, as on that of his previous visit to Isfahan, al­Ahsaʾi led the
prayers in the Masjid­i Shāh.466

Shaykh Aḥmad had numerous admirers in Isfahan, among whom were
several of the leading ulama of the day. Most notable among them were Ḥājī
Muḥammad Ibrāhīm Kalbāsī and Ḥājī Sayyid Muḥammad Bāqir Shaftī, to both
of whom we have referred in the previous chapter. When al­Ahsaʾi was in
Isfahan, Kalbāsī suspended his classes, cancelled his Friday prayers, and prayed
behind the Shaykh.467 Although Shaftī was later perturbed by the takfīr, he

hesitated to condemn al­Ahsaʾi himself, and it has been claimed that, towards
the end of his life, he was convinced of the falsity of the charges levelled against
his teachings.468

Other admirers in Isfahan included Mullā ʿAlī ibn Jamshīd Nūrī
(d.1246/1830),469 who also suspended his classes when al­Ahsaʾi was in the city,
and Shaykh Muḥammad Taqī Isfahānī (d.1248/1832),470 a pupil of Baḥr al­
ʿUlūm and a son­in­law and pupil of Shaykh Jaʿfar ibn Khiḍr al­Najafī.471 Even
if none of these men were “Shaykhis” in what became the strict sense, and may
in some cases have held doubts about the Shaykh’s beliefs after the takfīr, none
of them lent his support to the attack launched against him. Kalbāsī, who had an
ijāza from al­Ahsaʾi, was so unimpressed by the takfīr that, on the Shaykh’s
death, he held a three­day memorial meeting attended by large numbers,
including men of rank in the city.472 That men such as Kalbāsī and Shaftī refused
to condemn the Shaykh was a major factor in restricting the effectiveness of the
takfīr.

On 12 Shawwāl 1238/22 June 1823, al­Ahsaʾi left Isfahan for
Kirmanshah, where he stayed for another year; he then went to Karbala having
left his wives (and, presumably, the rest of his unnecessary baggage) in
Kirmanshah.473 It was after he had been in Karbala for a short time that serious
opposition began, led by Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī Ṭabāṭabāʾī.474 According to
Rashti, someone compiled a book containing heretical ideas of mulḥids, zindīqs,
Ṣūfīs, Trinitarians, and so on, attributing them to Shaykh Aḥmad, and reading
them to a large gathering assembled for the purpose.475 We have mentioned
above the deliberate attempt to incite the governor of Baghdad, Dāʾūd Pāshā,
against the Shaykh. The latter seems to have recognized the serious danger he
was in and decided to travel to Mecca, leaving Sayyid Rashti behind in Karbala
as his leading pupil and, in some sense, his successor.476 Accompanied by
several companions, he went first to Baghdad, from where he set out for
Syria.477 On the way he grew ill and, two or three stages from Medina, at
Hadiyya, died on 21 Dhū ‘l­Qaʿda 1241/27 June 1826, aged seventy­five.478 His
grave is in Medina.479

CHAPTER THREE:
SAYYID KĀẒIM RASHTĪ

We do not, unfortunately, possess any very detailed accounts of the life of
Sayyid Kāẓim similar to Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh al­Aḥsaʾi’s life of his father. Two
manuscript biographies written by pupils of the Sayyid—the Nūr al­anwār,
written for Prince Āṣif Mīrzā by Mīrzā ʿAlī Naqī Qummī Hindī, and the Tanbīh
al­ghāfilīn, by Āqā Sayyid Hādī Hindī480—are known to be in existence.481
Unfortunately, despite efforts to trace these for the present author during a visit
to Kirman in 1977, the Shaykhi community there has been unable to discover
their current location. There is, however, a summary of their contents by Ḥāj
Sayyid Jawād Qarashī Hindī, a descendant of Mīrzā ʿAlī Naqī and a nephew of
Āqā Sayyid Hādī; this has been printed by Abu’l­Qāsim ibn Zayn al­ʿĀbidīn ibn
Karīm in his Fihrist.482 Brief accounts of Rashti may also be found in
Tanakābūnī’s Qiṣaṣ al­ʿulamāʾ, Khwānsārī’s Kitāb rawḍāt al­jannāt,
Ḥabībābādī’s Makārim al­āthār, Kirmānī’s Hidāyat al­ṭālibīn, and elsewhere.

The date of Sayyid Kāẓim’s birth is open to dispute. According to
different sources, he was born in Rasht in 1198/1784,483 1205/1791,484
1209/1794,485 1212/1797,486 or 1214/1799,487 the son of Āqā Sayyid Qāsim ibn
Aḥmad. Sayyid Aḥmad was a Ḥusaynī sayyid, belonging to an important family
in Medina, who had left his native city on the death of his father, Sayyid Ḥabīb,
on account of plague, and travelled to Rasht in north­west Iran. Āqā Sayyid
Qāsim was born in Rasht and, according to Qarashī, became “one of the great
scholars (fuḍalāʾ)” of the city.488 Whatever his literary or other intellectual
attainments, however, Sayyid Qāsim was not primarily an ʿālim, but a silk
merchant by trade,489 and there seems to be no evidence that the family had any
close connections with the ulama in Rasht or elsewhere. As with al­Ahsaʾi, we
may assume that Rashti’s impulse to study the religious sciences may have
derived from personal initiative rather than upbringing or parental
encouragement, in contrast to the majority of leading ulama in his period and
since. Like al­Ahsaʾi too, the Sayyid seems to have been drawn to a life of
retirement and reflection from early childhood, refusing to join in games with
other children.490

According to a short biography in the E. G. Browne Collection, at the age
of twelve Rashti was living at Ardabīl.491 While there, states Mullā Jaʿfar
Qazvīnī, he engaged in ascetic practices and, like al­Ahsaʾi, began to have
visions, although with none of the intensity or frequency experienced by the
latter.492 Browne’s biography states that, while at Ardabīl, he had a dream of one
of the ancestors of Shaykh Ṣafi al­Dīn ʿAbd al­Fatḥ Isḥāq (1252­1334),
progenitor of the Safavid dynasty, who instructed him to travel to Yazd in order
to become a disciple of al­Ahsaʾi.493 It seems improbable that the Sayyid should
have gone to Yazd at such an early age, and some other sources, in fact, suggest

that he first met al­Ahsaʾi there in his late teens or early twenties. It is more
likely that he returned to Rasht at this point—as is stated by Qazvīnī, who says
he did so after a dream of al­Ahsaʾi.494

Like the Shaykh, he had an early desire to study, and was sent by his
father to a local teacher ran a small maktab in the town.495 When he had
completed these “external” studies, he decided to continue to the “higher
studies”, and expressed a desire to travel for this purpose, probably to the
ʿatabāt or one of the centres of learning in Iran. His family were opposed to this,
however, and prevented him from leaving.496 This resembles the disapproval felt
by the family of the Bab when he left for the ʿatabāt. In both cases, it seems that
the transition from merchant to ʿālim was considered socially (and probably
financially) unacceptable.

According to the standard Shaykhi account, Rashti dreamt one night of
Fāṭima, who revealed to him the existence of Shaykh Aḥmad; on the fourth
night after this dream, he had another, in which she told him that the Shaykh
was then living in Yazd. He set out, accordingly, in that direction, met al­Ahsaʾi,
and became one of his pupils.497

Our sources, already in disagreement over the date of Rashti’s birth, are
equally contradictory in respect of his age on meeting al­Ahsaʾi, although they
do seem to be agreed that the meeting took place in Yazd—probably between
the Shaykh’s return from Tehran in 1224/1809 and his departure for Kirmanshah
in 1229/1814. Browne, as noted above, suggests that he travelled to Yazd,
shortly after the age of twelve – a date which I have rejected as improbable.
Corbin thinks he was aged fifteen, thus arriving in Yazd in 1227/1812.498
According to Qazvīnī, the Sayyid travelled to Yazd via Qazvīn in the company
of an old man of his family some time after the arrival of al­Ahsaʾi in Iran; the
same source quotes an unnamed mulla from Yazd, who recalls how al­Ahsaʾi
went out to meet the Sayyid on his arrival and that the latter was then seventeen
or eighteen years old.499 Zarandī, however, maintains that Rashti, was aged
twenty­two on his arrival in Yazd, although he incorrectly states that this was in
1231/1815, at the time al­Ahsaʾi was preparing to leave Yazd for
Kirmanshah.500

Such a confusing welter of dates and ages makes it extremely difficult for
us to estimate the nature and extent of Rashti’s development prior to meeting al­
Ahsaʾi. There seems little doubt that he showed very considerable precocious
talent and began writing at an early age. Zarandī notes that “at the age of eleven,
he had committed to memory the whole of the Qurʾan. At the age of fourteen, he
had learned by heart a prodigious number of prayers and recognized traditions of
Muḥammad.”501 Mullā Jaʿfar Qazvīnī states that on his return to Rasht from
Ardabīl, his name reached the ears of Muḥammad Riḍā Mīrzā Iftikhār al­Mulk
(1797­1860), who came to visit him, and that, at the age of fifteen, he wrote
rasāʾil in reply to questions from this prince.502 How much truth there is in this
account, it is hard to determine. Muḥammad Riḍā Mīrzā, the thirteenth son of

Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh, was, in fact, about the same age as Rashti or, if we accept an
earlier date of birth for the latter, much younger than him, being born in
1211/1797. He did not became governor of Gīlān until 1234/1819, and it is
possible that he lived in Tehran up until then. On the other hand, a risāla on akl
wa maʾkūl addressed to this prince is recorded as having been written at an
unspecified date by Rashti.503 It is also clear that the prince was deeply
interested in religious matters, as witnessed in his devotion to the Niʿmatullāhī
Sufi order, in which his personal murshid was Ḥājī Muḥammad Jaʿfar Kabūdār
Āhangī in Hamadān.504

At least three works are known to have been written by Rashti at a
relatively early age, these being the Risāla maṭāliʿ al­anwār, written at the age
of nineteen in reply to Mullā Muḥammad Rashīd in explanation of some phrases
in the Kalimāt­i maknūna of Fayḍ al­Kāshānī;505 the Masāʾil­i Rashīdiyya, also
written at the age of nineteen, in reply to the same individual, on the differences
of capacities (qābiliyyāt);506 and a tafsīr of part of the “throne verse” (āyat al­
kursī: Qurʾan 2:255), written during a ḥajj journey undertaken at the age of
twenty.507

Although the controversy surrounding the date of his birth makes it
impossible to determine his exact age at the time of writing, there are several
dated rasāʾil by Rashti which can be ascribed with reasonable certainty to his
twenties or early thirties. Among the more important of these, we may note al­
Risāla al­ṣuʿudiyya wa ‘l­nuzūliyya (1233/1818);508 al­Risāla al­ʿĀmiliyya
(1236/1821);509 the Sharḥ Duʿā al­samāt (1238/1823);510 an Arabic risāla on
sulūk and uṣūl (1238/1823);511 and the Risāla asrār al­shahāda (1238/1823).512

In general, we may note that, up to the death of al­Ahsaʾi in 1241/1826, Rashti
was actively engaged in writing commentaries and replies to questions from a
wide variety of individuals.513 Zarandī states that, within “a few weeks” of his
arrival in Yazd, the Sayyid was told to remain in his own house and cease
attending his lectures. Those of the Shaykh’s disciples who had difficulties in
understanding were from then on to be referred to him.514 While it is highly
unlikely that Rashti should so rapidly have been designated al­Ahsaʾi’s leading
disciple, especially if he was only in his teens on his arrival, there is no doubt
that after some time, he succeeded in winning the confidence and respect of the
Shaykh and was regarded, well before the latter’s death, as his deputy and the
semi­official expounder of his views. According to Kirmānī, al­Ahsaʾi’s attitude
of respect towards Rashti had already become apparent in Yazd: “Sayyid Kāẓim
understands, but no­one else does,” he is reported to have said there.515

Rashti’s precise position during the lifetime of the Shaykh is not entirely
clear, but he does seem to have been entrusted with the task of answering
questions on the latter’s behalf, a function which does not appear to have been
given to any other of his disciples. An excellent example of his role as the
Shaykh’s deputy is a lengthy risāla written in 1235/1820 in reply to twenty­four

questions originally asked of al­Ahsaʾi, but referred by him to Rashti.516 He also
acted as continuator for al­Ahsaʾi in the case of a risāla to a certain Mīrzā
Muḥammad ʿAlī.517

In this period also, Rashti began to carry out a task which was to
preoccupy him greatly in later years—defence of al­Ahsaʾi from attacks made
on him by hostile ulama. Thus, for example, in 1240/1825, he wrote a detailed
reply to an unnamed individual who had attacked the views of the Shaykh on
resurrection (maʿād) and the divine knowledge.518 It may also have been before
the death of Shaykh Aḥmad, or shortly after it, that Rashti undertook the
translation of some of his works into Persian, namely the Mukhtaṣar al­
Haydariyya,519 the Ḥayāt al­nafs, 520 and part of the first section of the Sharḥ al­
ziyāra.521

Contrary to the impression given in most of our sources, however, Sayyid
Kāẓim does not seem to have remained constantly in al­Aḥsāʾi’s company from
the time of their meeting in Yazd to the latter’s final departure for Arabia. At the
age of twenty, possibly some years after his arrival in Yazd, Rashti made the
pilgrimage to Mecca – the only occasion on which he was able to do so,
according to Niʿmat Allāh Raẓavī Sharīf. 522 In 1229/1814, he accompanied
Shaykh Aḥmad to Kirmanshah,523 but there is evidence that he did not stay
constantly with him there: two letters, one from Rashti and the other a reply
from al­Ahsaʾi, both apparently written during the latter’s stay in Kirmanshah,
and possibly during the lifetime of Prince Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā, indicate that
the Sayyid spent at least a year, perhaps much longer, in Karbala, with at least
one visit to his home town of Rasht.524

His absence would appear to have been on the instructions of the Shaykh ,
seemingly for the purpose of acting as his representative at the ʿatabāt: in his
reply to Rashti, who had complained of his separation from his teacher and
suggested that he had been rejected by him, Shaykh Aḥmad writes “know that I
have placed you in a position of rank on my behalf, which is not known to most
people, but which I had thought was known to you; I would otherwise have
given you what I give everyone else…. I have removed from you the decree of
dissimulation (al­taqiyya) and have bestowed on you a position on my
behalf.”525

As we have mentioned previously, al­Ahsaʾi left Kirmanshah in
1238/1822, travelling to Tehran, Mashhad, Yazd, and Isfahan, returning to
Kirmanshah for a year towards the end of 1238/1822, and finally leaving for
Karbala in 1239/1824. Rashti does not seem to have accompanied him on any of
these journeys. In Ṣafar 1238/October­November 1822, he was staying in the
vicinity of Rasht, as is apparent from a letter written in that month from the
village of Shīrvān.526 This journey to Iran may have been an extended one: his
commentary on ʿAlī ibn Mūsā Andalūsī’s (1214­1285) Al­qasīda al­bā’iyya
from the Shudhūr al­dhahab was written in the village of Mārān near Hamadān
in Shawwāl 1239/June 1824.527

It is also clear that, sometime before the death of Shaykh Aḥmad, Rashti
studied under and received ijāzāt from a number of ulama, all of whom, like the
Shaykh, were themselves pupils of Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī. This is a fact of
some importance in assessing the nature of Rashti’s relationship with orthodox
Shiʿism. Despite the unusual character of his bond with al­Ahsaʾi, which was, in
some ways, closer to that of a Ṣūfī disciple to his murshid than a Shiʿi ʿālim to
the mujtahid granting him ijāza, it is clear that Rashti did not feel himself
excluded from the more traditional mode of transmission of authority and
learning. In an ijāza written for Sayyid Muḥammad Ḥasan Mūsawī Iṣfahānī
(d.1263/1847),528 and in another written for Āqā Muḥammad Sharīf Kirmānī,529
Rashti refers to four individuals from whom he possessed ijāzāt. Apart from al­
Ahsaʾi, these were ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad Riḍā Shubbar (1188­1242/1774­
1826), Shaykh Mūsā ibn Jaʿfar al­Najafī (d. 1241/1826), and Mullā ʿAlī Rashti.

Sayyid ʿAbd Allāh Shubbar and his father, Sayyid Muḥammad Riḍā
Shubbar, are mentioned by Rashti as among the ulama with whom al­Ahsaʾi
associated while in Kāẓimiyyah.530 Sayyid ʿAbd Allāh had himself studied
under several important ulama, including Mīrzā Muḥammad Mahdī Shahristānī,
Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī, Āqā Sayyid ʿAlī Ṭabāṭabāʾī, Mīrzā­yi Qummī, Shaykh
Asad Allāh al­Kāẓimaynī, and Shaykh Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi .531 The author of a
number of works, he is perhaps best known for his massive compilation on fiqh,
the Jāmiʿ al­maʿārif wa ‘l­aḥkām, which Muḥammad ʿAlī Muʿallim Ḥabībābādī
regards as comparable to Fayḍ­i Kāshānī’s Kitāb al­Wāfī, al­Ḥurr al­ʿĀmilī’s
Tafṣīl waṣā’il al Shīʿa, or Majlisī’s Biḥār al­anwār.532 It is of interest to note
that Sayyid ʿAbd Allāh was also one of the teachers of Mullā Muḥammad Ṣāliḥ
Baraghānī, the brother of Mullā Muḥammad Taqī.533 According to Anṣārī, he
was known in his day as ‘the second Majlisī.534

Shaykh Mūsā ibn Jaʿfar was one of the sons of Shaykh Jaʿfar, under
whom he studied extensively. His father regarded him highly and is said to have
considered him as more capable of fiqh that any but al­Muḥaqqiq al­Ḥillī and
Muḥammad ibn Makkī al­Shahīd al­Awwal,535 or, according to another source,
as one of “the most learned of men in fiqh” along with himself and al­Shahīd al­
Awwal.536 It is related that, on the death of Shaykh Jaʿfar, Mīrzā­yi Qummī
declared Shaykh Mūsā to be “the general marjaʿ and the proof of God unto you
... for he is superior to all others in knowledge”.537 Shaykh Mūsā was one of
several eminent ulama who defended al­Ahsaʾi against the attacks of his
opponents at the ʿatabāt.538

The identity of Mullā ʿAlī Rashtī is not clear; he may have been the Mullā
ʿAlī ibn Mīrzā Jān Rashtī for whom Shaykh Aḥmad wrote his lengthy al­Risāla
al­Rashtiyya in 1226/1811.539 If this is so, it is conceivable that Sayyid Kāẓim
studied under him while still living in Rasht and that it was on his
recommendation that he set out for Yazd to study under al­Ahsaʾi. In the
absence of dated texts of the ijāza in question, however, our theories as to the
periods when Sayyid Kāẓim studied under them must remain conjectural,

although the dates of the deaths of Sayyid ʿAbd Allāh and Shaykh Mūsā do at
least provide us with termini ad quem for his study under them.

The death of al­Ahsaʾi in 1241/1826 was an event fraught with serious
consequences for Iranian Shiʿism. Despite the takfir which, for some four years,
had been gaining notoriety throughout the main centres of the Shiʿi world, the
Shaykh’s position was still essentially that of a respected and influential
mujtahid and marjaʿ al­taqlīd on whom a sizeable body of ṭullāb and ulama
pinned their allegiance. It is of the utmost importance that we bear in mind that
by no means all of al­Ahsaʾi pupils became “Shaykhis” in a distinct sense. Many
like Mullā ʿAlī Nūrī and Ḥājī Ibrāhīm Kalbāsī, went on in later years as
perfectly respectable ulama with no overt connections with the “Shaykhi
school”.

At the time of al­Ahsaʾi’s death, there was, indeed, no hint of an attempt
to set up a separate school within Shiʿism, to create a division based either on
doctrinal differences or on conflicting claims to authority. Nevertheless, it is
clear that the effective resolution of the Akhbari/Usuli struggle had left
something of a vacuum which demanded filling. The status and influence of the
increasingly powerful mujtahid class as representatives of orthodoxy, could best
be tested and demonstrated in a conflict with heterodoxy—as defined by the
establishment itself. The Niʿmatullāhī Sufi revival of the late eighteenth century
provided a useful focus for such a conflict, but the issues involved were
somewhat stale and, despite a number of deaths, matters never really reached
very serious dimensions. The division over the affairs of Ahsaʾi’s orthodoxy
was, however, potentially much more crucial. Although the conflict with Sufism
was essentially centred in irreconcilable claims to authority, on behalf of the
Ṣūfī shaykh or pīr on the one hand and the Shiʿi Imam or his representative on
the other, the issue did not on the whole, affect or call into question relations
within the Shiʿi hierarchy itself.

Al­Ahsaʾi’s death threatened to render the issue entirely academic.

Whatever the ensuing debate as to his personal orthodoxy, the more
fundamental—if generally unspoken—issue of authority would now have ceased
to be relevant. That it did not was entirely due to the unusual manner in which
Rashti was “appointed” the Shaykh’s “successor”, entailing as it did the creation
of an order (silsila) or school (madhhab) within the Shiʿi fold. Without such an
appointment or its ready acceptance by the vast majority of al­Ahsaʾi’s pupils, it
is highly unlikely that “Shaykhism” as a definable entity would have come into
being at all or that a matrix would have existed in which Babism might be
formed.

When al­Ahsaʾi left Karbala for Mecca in 1241/1826, Rashti stayed
behind, teaching in his place.540 His assumption of the role of leader of the
Shaykh’s disciples at the ‘atabāt, does not, however, seem to have been based
on a merely tacit recognition of his de facto position there on the latter’s death.

According to Kirmānī, al­Ahsaʾi had already appointed him as the future leader
of this group, both verbally and in writing.

“Some asked the Shaykh ‘If we have no means of access to you, from
whom are we to obtain this knowledge?’ He replied ‘From Sayyid Kāẓim, for he
has learnt what he knows orally from me and I have learnt [what I know] orally
from the Imāms and they have learnt from God without the mediation of
anyone.’ And it is known that the Shaykh wrote [this] in his own hand.”541

This appointment was unusual in a number of ways. Although a leading
pupil or eldest son might often inherit the sanctity and position of his teacher or
father, it was uncommon for a marjʿ al­taqlīd to designate anyone as marjaʿ in
his place, particularly at this period. At a later date, something of this kind did
occur, significantly in connection with the attempt to restrict marjaʿīyyat to a
single individual; thus, Shaykh Murtaḍā al­Anṣārī took over the role of marjaʿ
from Muḥammad Ḥasan al­Najafī during the latter's final illness, in the presence
of witnesses,542 while al­Anṣārī’s own successor, Mīrzā­yi Shīrāzī, was clearly
singled out for that role in his teacher's life­time.543 The experiment did not
succeed, however, as we have observed in the first chapter, possibly because of
a reluctance on the part of each marjaʿ to endorse his verbal approval with a
written appointment (naṣṣ). The unformalized method of acquiring authority by
means of growing recognition and popularity seems to fit in more easily with the
unstructured system of the Shiʿi hierarchy. Since the 1979 Revolution, more
overtly political factors have come to dominate.

Not only was Rashti’s appointment unusual, first in occurring well before
any comparable development in the main body of Shiʿism (unless we include
Mīrzā­yi Qummī’s declaration in favour of Shaykh Mūsā al­Najafī) and,
secondly, in being written; it was also highly unorthodox in its content. Sayyid
Kāẓim was not merely a mujtahid receiving authority from another to expound
and develop the religious law, but was being identified as the direct recipient of
a body of knowledge derived, through al­Ahsaʾi, from the Imāms and, through
them, from God. He was, as Karīm Khān describes him, “a bearer (ḥāmil) ... for
that innate knowledge (ʿilm­i ladunī).”544 The only useful comparisons are those
of the appointment of each Imām by his predecessor, beginning with ʿAli’s
designation as waṣī by Muḥammad; the nomination by the shaykh of a Ṣūfī
order of his successor; or the later development of a ‘covenant’ (mīthāq; ʿahd)
system in Bahaʾism, whereby ʿAbd al­Bahāʾ was appointed as interpreter
(shāriḥ; mubayyin) of the sacred writ by his father, and Shoghi Effendi Rabbani
as walī amr Allāh by his grandfather ʿAbbās Afandī.

Karīm Khān explicitly makes the comparison between al­Ahsaʾi’s
appointment of Rashti and the naṣṣ of Muḥammad designating ʿAli or that of
each Imām in respect of his successor.545 Khwānsārī describes Sayyid Kāẓim as
al­Ahsaʾi’s “representative” (al­nāʾib fi ’l­umūr manābuhu) and the “leader
[imam] of his disciples”,546 clearly echoing the notion of a formal appointment
of this nature. By virtue of this appointment, Rashti became “the interpreter

(shāriḥ) of the knowledge of the Shaykh, the clarifier of the difficulties of his
books, and the expounder of his stations.”547 In this respect, the Sayyid was
endowed with a function very similar to that of the imam as qayyim bi ’l­Qur’ān
or, more significantly perhaps, the head of the Ishrāqī order as qayyim bi ’l­
kitāb’.548

The self­effacing tone of his writings makes it difficult for us to determine
exactly how Rashti himself understood his position after the death of the
Shaykh. It is also clear that, even as late as 1258/1842, he persisted in denying
the charge that he had established a new madhhab within Islam,549 and that he
constantly represented himself as simply the expounder and defender of the
views and person of his shaykh. The meaning of the term “Shaykhiyya”, used to
refer to what he calls “this sect” (īn firqa), is simply “people who are adherents
of (mansūband bar) this Shaykh”.550 Rashti’s beliefs regarding Shaykh Aḥmad
rather than himself are, in fact, probably the best guide to his attitude towards
his own role as his successor. Since this is a point to which we shall return in
another chapter, I propose to indicate here only very briefly something of
Rashti’s understanding of the position of al­Ahsaʾi within the overall
perspective of sacred history.

In an important passage in his Sharḥ al­qaṣīda al­lāmiyya 551 Rashti refers
to two ages of the dispensation of Muḥammad: an age of outward observances
(ẓawāhir) and an age of inward realities (bawāṭin). The former age came to an
end after twelve centuries and the second then commenced. In every century of
the first age, there appeared a promulgator (murawwij) of the outward laws; at
the commencement of the first century of the second age, the first murawwij of
the inward truth appeared—Shaykh Aḥmad.552 Similarly, in a letter written to
al­Ahsaʾi during the latter’s stay in Kirmanshah, he describes him as “the one
testifying to the wilāya of the first walī in the first period of the second age.”553
This conception of the role of al­Ahsaʾi was, clearly, current among the
followers of Rashti, as is apparent from an anonymous risāla written sometime
after 1261/1845. The author of this document speaks of the beginning of the
revelation (of inner truth) in the person of Shaykh Aḥmad at the end of one
thousand two hundred years, and refers to the Shaykh as the murawwij of the
first century of the second age and, indeed, of the twelfth century of the first age
of inward truth.554

We may, then, tentatively suggest that Rashti regarded himself as
empowered by al­Ahsaʾi to develop and deepen men’s understanding of the
“inner realities” revealed by him. It may well be that he conceived of himself as,
in some sense, the trustee or teacher of a select group of initiates to this higher
gnosis promulgated for the first time by al­Ahsaʾi, somewhat after ‘the fashion
of a Sufi shaykh entrusted with the maintenance of baraka and ʿirfān within the
ṭarīqa of which he is the head. There seems to be no direct evidence that Rashti
thought of either Shaykh Aḥmad or himself as vice­regents or gates of the
Imām, although it is clear that the attribution of just such a station to them by a

section of the Sayyid’s followers was a significant factor in the inception of
Babism. At the most, Rashti seems to have looked on Shaykh Aḥmad as privy to
knowledge of esoteric truth imparted by the Imāms, and himself as, in turn, a
direct recipient of the Shaykh’s knowledge. He was, in a sense, the silent
interpreter (ṣāmit) following the speaking nāṭiq of inner truth, in the Ismaili
fashion.

Rashti’s position appears to have been recognized with little or no
hesitation by the vast majority of al­Ahsaʾi’s followers, in contrast to the major
schisms which occurred on his own death. There can, of course, be little doubt
but that al­Ahsaʾi’s preferential treatment of the Sayyid and his authorization of
him to expound his teachings to his other disciples excited a certain degree of
resentment among his more ambitious followers, as Zarandī suggests.555 There
also appears to have been a number of other ulama belonging to al­Ahsaʾi’s
circle who were regarded or regarded themselves as pre­eminent. Tanakābunī
claims that his maternal uncle, Āqā Sayyid Abu ’l­Ḥasan ibn Muḥammad
Tanakābunī (d. circa 1265/1849) was the leading (arshad) pupil of al­Ahsaʾi,
and notes that the latter wrote a commentary on a risāla on ʿilm written by
him.556 In fact, no such commentary by Shaykh Aḥmad is known to me,
although there are two rasā’il written by him in 1223/1808 and 1224/1809 for a
Sayyid Abu ’1­Ḥasan Jī1ānī, who may well have been Tanakābunī’s uncle.557
Qazvīnī refers to a former Ishrāqī ʿālim named Mullā Aḥmad Mullābāshī, who
was at one time regarded as next in rank to al­Ahsaʾi but who, on reading
Rashti’s Sharḥ al­khutba al­tutunjiyya, acknowledged the superiority of the
latter.558

During the period of his leadership of the Shaykhi school, Rashti appears
to have remained for the most part in Karbala, with occasional visits to the other
shrine towns of Iraq. Muḥammad Taqī al­Harawī, an important Shaykhi ʿālim
who later became a Babi for a short period, writes in al­Durar al­manthūra—a
commentary on the Sayyid’s al­Lawāmiʿ al­Ḥusayniyya559—that he received
explanations of the text from Rashti himself in Karbala, Kazimiyya, Samarra,
and Najaf.560 It is possible that the Sayyid performed an annual ziyāra to Najaf
on the occasion of the festival of Ghadīr Khumm, as he himself suggests in the
Dalīl al­mutaḥayyirīn,561 while he is recorded as having travelled to Kazimiyya
each year in the month of Dhu ’l­Qaʿda.562 According to Chahārdihī, however,
he never once visited Iran during the entire period of his leadership.563 In thus
adopting a sedentary mode of existence, in sharp contrast to the peripatetic
restlessness of al­Ahsaʾi, Rashti gave to the amorphous body of the Shaykh ’s
admirers and disciples “a local habitation and a name”. By thus providing the
formless “school” of Shaykh Aḥmad with a centre and a focus, Sayyid Kāẓim—
perhaps quite inadvertently—did much to hasten its crystallization into a body
increasingly far removed from the mainstream of orthodox Shiʿism.

Despite his constant efforts to do so, Rashti failed to reintegrate the
Shaykhī school with mainline Shiʿism, and he and his writings remained the

target of continued opposition on the part of the ulama up to the time of his
death. However, as we shall see, this stood in direct contrast to the political
influence he wielded in the ʿatabāt region.

The Sayyid’s earliest and most determined opponent was Sayyid
Muḥammad Mahdī Ṭabāṭabāʾī, a son of Sayyid ʿAlī Ṭabāṭabāʾī and brother of
Āqā Sayyid Muḥammad Ṭabāṭabāʾī, (see the last chapter). Although less
illustrious than his father or brother and disinclined either to write or to hold
classes,564 Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī possessed some degree of prestige in
Karbala by association with them, and, as, we have seen, was probably the first
individual there to declare takfīr against al­Ahsaʾi. On the Shaykh’s death, he
and his supporters at first abandoned their campaign for about two years.565
They revived it, however, as it gradually became apparent that Rashti, as the
Shaykh’s successor, had been able to maintain a sense of identity among his
pupils and was continuing to defend and disseminate his views. That the takfir
campaign thus ceased for a period indicates how much it was directed against al­
Ahsaʾi as an individual, rather than against a sect or school deemed to have been
established by him. Its resumption, in turn, shows that Ṭabāṭabāʾī and others
now recognized that, under Sayyid Kāẓim, just such a school was being created.
One of their specific attacks on Rashti was, in fact, that he was attempting to
form a madhhab separate from and independent of orthodox Shiʿism.566

On Friday 1 Rajab 1243/18 January 1828,567 Rashti was summoned to a
meeting organized by his opponents and held in the house of Mīrzā Muḥammad
ʿAlī Shahristānī, a son of Mīrzā Muḥammad Mahdī Shahristānī (one of al­
Ahsaʾi’s teachers).568 The purpose of the meeting—which was attended by
“several thousand” people, was to secure Rashti’s admission that, according to
the popular meanings attached to the terminology used in them, certain
statements of al­Ahsaʾi constituted heresy (kufr). The concept that “the body
which is composed of elements shall not be resurrected (al­jasad al­unṣurī lā
yaʿūdu)”569 was particularly criticized, and the Sayyid was urged to write a
declaration to the effect that it was heretical. This he did, but his “admission” of
heresy was heavily qualified with statements maintaining that only the outward
and popular meaning was objectionable and that, properly understood, none of
the words of al­Ahsaʾi could be deemed contradictory to the Qurʾan, the
Traditions, or, indeed, the writings of the great Shiʿi ulama.570

Although this meeting soon dispersed, its objective had scarcely been
attained. Rashti’s testimony was too much qualified to be of use and could even
backfire on his opponents if brought into play by them. Shortly after this first
gathering, therefore, a second meeting was held in the courtyard (ṣaḥn) of the
shrine of ʿAbbās, at which it was determined to expel Rashti from Karbala.571
According to Kirmānī, Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī ascended a minbar and urged
those present to take immediate action to put this decree into effect; a large
crowd made for the house of Sayyid Kāẓim but, once there, dispersed for no
apparent reason.572 It is quite possible that the civil authorities, fearing the

possible consequences of such an expulsion, prevented the mob from carrying
out their intention.

Some time after this, Ṭabāṭabāʾī returned to Najaf, where he normally
resided.573 There, he seems to have encountered some degree of opposition from
other ulama, who regarded his behaviour towards Rashti as indefensible and
advised him that his criticisms lacked any solid foundation.574 This defence of
Rashti by ulama not actually belonging to the circle of al­Ahsaʾi’s followers is
of considerable importance in showing to what extent the debate on the latter’s
takfīr was essentially a controversy within the context of Shiʿi orthodoxy, rather
than the orthodox (Bālāsarī) versus heterodox (Shaykhī) conflict it later became.
Whereas, at the later stage of the debate, opposition to Shaykhism implied
simple identification with Usuli orthodoxy, at this point its implications were
less cut and dried.

The efforts of Ṭabāṭabāʾī and others to make of al­Ahsaʾi’s takfīr a cause
célèbre may initially have owed much to existing rivalries in the religious
institution, themselves possibly fostered by feelings of uncertainty as to the
nature of authority—charismatic or otherwise—among the ulama in what was
very much a period of transition. Feelings of confusion with respect to authority
may have been exacerbated in individual cases by a lack of personal prestige
coupled with strong ambition—as in the cases of Baraghānī or Sayyid
Muḥammad Mahdī. The role of Sayyid Kāẓim as al­Ahsaʾi’s waṣī clearly raised
the question of authority in a particularly sharp form, even though opposition to
him did not centre openly on this issue. As we shall see, a similar problem faced
the Shaykhī ulama some twenty years later, when confronted with the rise of
Babism as a charismatic movement which threatened to jeopardize even further
the Shaykhī position vis­à­vis the religious establishment.

It seems to have been in Dhu ’l­Ḥijja 1243/July 1828,575 while Rashti was
performing his annual ziyāra to Najaf for the Ghadīr festival, that a messenger
arrived from Shaykh ʿAlī al­Najafi (d.1254/1838), requesting a meeting.576
Shaykh ʿAlī was a son of Shaykh Jaʿfar al­Najafī and a brother of Sayyid
Kāẓim’s supporter Shaykh Mūsā. He was also, like Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī, a
man overshadowed by his father and brother. He seems to have originally been a
firm supporter of Rashti,577 but had at some point clashed with him over a
question of property rights, and soon joined the opposition party.578 Shaykh ʿAlī
was in a particularly good position to help further the campaign against Rashti
since, although normally resident in Najaf, he spent three months of every year
in Karbala.579

Rashti refused to meet with Shaykh ʿAlī unless an independent arbitrator
could be found, whose decision as to the validity of any arguments advanced by
either party would be considered binding.580 When Shaykh ʿAlī refused accept
this condition and made it known among the pilgrims in Najaf for the festival
that Rashti had failed to respond to no fewer than nineteen invitations to meet
with him, the Sayyid reacted by having a minbar erected in the courtyard of the

shrine of Ali, from which he preached during the afternoon to a large crowd.

The summary of this sermon, which he himself gives in Dalīl al­
mutaḥayyirīn, is valuable evidence as to the four main points of doctrine then at
issue, as well as to the Sayyid’s use of taqiyya, which becomes a marked feature
of Shaykhi writing from this time on.581 In his sermon, Rashti stresses the
exalted station of the Imāms and Fāṭima, while refuting any claims that they are
divine or “partners of God” or that God has transferred (tafwīḍ kard) his
command to them.582 In referring to the miʿrāj of Muḥammad, he maintains that
the Prophet “ascended to heaven with his body (jism), his clothes, and his
sandals” and goes on to say that “on the day of resurrection, all created things
shall be raised up in their visible, tangible, earthly bodies and corporealities
(badanhā wa jasadhā)”.583 As far as the knowledge of God is concerned, Rashti
holds that “God knows all things collectively before their creation, after their
creation, and at the time of their creation.”584 Such a clear refutation of four of
the specific charges of heresy levelled against him and Shaykh Aḥmad cannot
have failed to make an impression on Rashti’s audience. As a result, in the
evening of the same day, a deputation comprising two merchants and one of
Shaykh ʿAlī’s ṭullāb came to repeat the invitation to meet with the Shaykh.585
Rashti himself deputed one of his leading followers, Mullā Muḥammad Ḥasan
Gawhar, to present Shaykh ʿAlī with what amounted to a challenge to mubāhala
or mutual cursing before God.586 Although Shaykh ʿAlī accepted an alternative
proposition to write down his objections against specific passages in the works
of Sayyid Kāẓim, to have the latter write down a reply to these and to send all of
this to an acceptable ʿālim for arbitration, he failed, in the end to comply.587

In Rabīʿ I 1244/January 1829, Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī began to
express objections to a phrase in a risāla of Rashti’s on morals, which, loosely
interpreted, suggested that the Sayyid was recommending the abandonment of
all traditional doctrines and authorities and attempting to establish a new
madhhab.588 Although Rashti replied to this accusation in a separate treatise,589
his opponent refused to retract his allegations and continued to pursue a policy
of denunciation for the next two years.590 Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī carried his
campaign beyond the ʿatabāt, writing letters in condemnation of Rashti to India
and, probably, elsewhere.591 It seems that, with the support of Shaykh ʿAlī al­
Najafī, Ṭabāṭabāʾī was gradually able to bring most of the ulama of Najaf to his
side, and that the opposition to Shaykhism gained much ground there.592

Rashti nevertheless continued to make his annual pilgrimage to the town.

In Dhu ’l­Hijja 1246/May­June 1831, a total of three gatherings were held in
Najaf by Ṭabāṭabāʾī and his followers for the purpose of again confronting
Sayyid Kāẓim. The first two meetings were held in the house of Sayyid
Muḥammad Mahdī’s brother, Sayyid Maḥmūd, and the third in the house of
Sayyid Muḥammad ʿAlī, the Keeper of the Keys to the shrine of Ḥusayn.
Among those present were Shaykh Khalaf (ibn ʿAskar), Mullā Sharīf, and Ḥājī
Mullā Jaʿfar Astarābādī.593 Mullā Muḥammad Ḥamza Sharīʿatmadār

Māzandarānī, a Shaykhi ʿālim who was present at these meetings and is the only
writer to refer to them, does not, unfortunately, make clear what result, if any,
they had; but, in view of Rashti’s isolation on each occasion, it is unlikely that
anything of value was achieved. Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī died at the Shrine of
Shāh ʿAbd al ʿAzīm near Tehran in 1249/1833, leaving the opposition to Rashti
in Najaf in the hands of Shaykh ʿAlī.

In Karbala, Sayyid Ibrahīm ibn Muḥammad Bāqir Qazvīnī (d. 1846)
emerged as the Sayyid’s chief rival in both religious and political affairs.
Possibly as a result of his involvement in the politics of Karbala, Rashti was
made the target for several attempts on his life,594 as well as petty threats and
insults.595 On one occasion, he was even fired on with a rifle in the courtyard of
the Shrine of Ḥusayn.596 Despite this, he continued to be active in his public
defence of the views of Shaykh Aḥmad, preaching to pilgrims and others on
festivals, Thursdays, Fridays, and during the month of Ramaḍān.597 He also
encouraged his followers to emulate him in adopting a defensive stance against
the orthodox condemnation of Shaykhism, a policy which inevitably widened
the range of arguments employed in the doctrinal debate.

On one occasion, for example, he made a general request to the Shaykhi
ulama to write polemics in defence of al­Ahsaʾi;598 among those who responded
was the niece of Mullā Muḥammad Taqī Baraghānī, Fāṭima Khānum, whom
Sayyid Kāẓim subsequently named Qurrat al­ʿAyn.599 More specifically, Rashti
requested one of his leading followers in Karbala, Mullā Muḥammad Ḥasan
Gawhar Qarāchadāghī, to take sections from his (Gawhar’s) commentary on the
Ḥayāt al­arwāḥ of Mullā Muḥammad Jaʿfar Astarābādī, dealing with specific
attacks on al­Ahsaʾi, and to compile these into a separate risāla.600 Another of
Rashti’s leading supporters in Karbala, Muḥammad Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī Akbar
Muḥīṭ Kirmānī, wrote a reply to points raised by Mullā ʿAbd al­ʿAlī Ṭabasī at
Rashti’s request.601

In thus encouraging the Shaykhi ulama to defend and expound the
“doctrine” of the school at a time when the precise nature of that doctrine was
still unclear to many, Sayyid Kāẓim undoubtedly prepared the way for the
serious disputes which ensued between his leading followers (including Qurrat
al­ʿAyn, Mullā Ḥasan Gawhar and Mīrzā Muḥīṭ in particular) on his death.
Although real and potential doctrinal divisions were generally subordinated to
the authority of Rashti during his lifetime, the rapidity with which the Shaykhi
school disintegrated into warring factions following his removal from the scene
indicates how precarious was the situation in the years immediately prior to his
death.

Apart from his influence over the immediate circle of his followers from
his base in Karbala, the Sayyid carried on a widely flung correspondence with
ulama in most of the centers of Shiʿi Islam, including Baghdad,602 Damascus,603
Bahrain,604 Jabal ʿĀmil,605 al­Aḥsāʾ,606 Isfahan,607 Khurasan,608 and India.609 His
reputation in these places, especially in more distant regions where the takfīr of

al­AhsaʾI had had little impact, seems to have been high, but it was, if anything,
even more so in Iraq itself. Despite the takfīr and the continuing campaign
against him, Rashti succeeded in establishing for himself a position as one of the
leading mujtahids of Karbala and, indeed, the entire ʿatabāt. Outside of the
immediate circle of the Shaykhi school, he and his writings were highly
respected by many of the leading ulama of the period, several of whom had
already supported al­Ahsaʾi. These included Shaykh Mūsā al­Najāfi,610 Sayyid
ʿAbd Allāh Shubbar,611 Sayyid ʿAlī Ṭabāṭabāʾī,612 Ḥājj Muḥammad Ibrāhīm
Kalbāsī,613 and Sayyid Muḥammad Bāqir Shaftī,614 as well as numbers of their
relatives and pupils.615 Rashti’s influence was not, however, confined to the
Shiʿi ulama, but extended to individuals such as Shihāb al­Dīn Maḥmūd Abu ’l­
Thanāʾ al­Ālūsī, the famous Sunni mufti of Baghdad,616 for whom he wrote at
least two risalas;617 and ʿAlī Riḍā Pasha, on whose directions he wrote the
Sharḥ al­qasīda.618

Of even greater significance was his relationship with Sulaymān Khān
Afshār Qāsimlū (d. 1309/1891), one of the leading officials of the Qajar state.
Not only was Sulayman Khān an ardent follower of the Sayyid, who wrote at
least one risāla in reply to intelligent questions from him,619 but his son, Riḍāʾ
Qulī Khān (who later became a Babi) was married to Rashti’s daughter.620 In
view of Sulaymān’s close connection with the court—he was married to Qayṣar
Khānum, the thirty­fourth daughter of Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh 621—the marriage of his
son (albeit by another wife) to the daughter of Sayyid Kāẓim was both a token
of his own feelings of respect towards the Sayyid and a means of enhancing the
latter’s prestige in government circles in Iran. Sulaymān Khān later became a
follower of Karīm Khān Kirmānī (himself a relative of Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh), with
whom he corresponded;622 he later built two mosques in Tabriz for the Karīm
Khānī Shaykhis of the town623 and left waqf monies to pay for the publication of
Shaykhi books there. He appears to have met Sayyid ʿAlī Muḥammad Shīrāzī in
Mecca towards the end of 1260/1844,624 but refused an appeal for assistance
written to him by the latter while near Qazvīn en route to prison in
Azerbaijan.625 He is, perhaps best known to historians of Babism as the man
appointed by Mīrzā Taqī Khān Amīr­i Kabīr to quell the disturbance at Shaykh
Tabarsī in Mazandaran in 1849.626

The Sayyid’s political influence, both at the ʿatabāt and, less directly, in
Iran, appears to have been considerable. According to Chahārdihī, he associated
closely with various Qajar princes exiled to the ʿatabāt by Muḥammad Shah; as
a result, a great many members of the Qajar family became Shaykhis.627 The
princes at the ‘atabāt are not identified, but they may well have included the
three sons of Prince Muḥammad Ḥusayn ʿAlī Mīrzā Farmān­Farmā (1789­
1835), who left Shīrāz on their father’s defeat following his abortive attempt to
take the throne on the death of Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh, namely: Riḍāʾ Qulī Mīrzā (1806­
1862), Timur Mīrzā (ca. 1812­1874), and Najaf Qulī Mīrzā (ca. 1808­before

1862).628 There is evidence that Rashti provided funds to Prince ʿAlī Shāh Ẓill
al­Sulṭān (1796­1854), a former claimant to the throne of Iran, during his exile
in Karbala,629 and that he associated closely with Hulāgu Mīrzā (d. 1854), the
exiled son of Ḥasan ʿAlī Mīrzā Shujāʿ al­Salṭana (1789­1853).630 He also seems
to have been on close terms with a certain Hāshim Khān Niẓām al­Dawla,
another Iranian official resident in Karbala,631 and with Prince Sulaymān Mīrzā,
Hishmat al­Mulk (1810­1859?).632

In Iran, a core of individuals favorable to him was created at the court,
with the notable exceptions of ʿAlī­Qulī Mīrzā Iʿtiḍād al­Salṭana (d. 1880) and
Farhād Mīrzā, Muʿtamad al­Dawla (1818­1889).633 Of the forty­eight children
of ʿAbbās Mīrzā (1789­1833), all but a few are said to have been Shaykhis.634 In
Karbala, Rashti came to be reckoned as one of the two most influential
mujtahids, the other being his rival Sayyid Ibrāhīm Qazvīnī.635 According to
Chahārdihī, Sayyid Kāẓim was, for a period of one or two years, in charge of
“the money from India” (pūl­i Hindī), which may be a reference to either the
Oudh bequest funds (divided at that time between the two mujtahids, one in
Najaf and one in Karbala) or the sahm­i imām sent from the Shiʿa of India—it is
not clear which.636

Active though he was in the political life of Karbala, Rashti seems to have
been a somewhat reluctant participant in such matters, as is evidenced by a letter
written by him to Karīm Khān Kirmānī:

> As regards the matter of the administration of justice (ḥukm) and
> the issue of legal judgements (qaḍāʾ), beware, beware! Flee from
> legal judgements as you would from a lion. Dear friend, as far as is
> in you, shut fast this door, for these are but wretched people and
> association with them and involvement with their affairs shall prove
> a cause of loss to you in this world and the next, unless it be at
> times in order [to prevent] the eating of unclean meat (mayta) or for
> the preservation of the faith. In such matters, you have no choice—
> as is the case with this powerless one. I ask the help and assistance
> and succour of God! Had I regarded it as permissible for me to tell
> another “Go to Zayd in order to pass judgement,” by God, I should
> not have sat a single day in the court of justice. Indeed, I that must
> endure the bitterness and trials of justice.” Indeed, I that must
> endure the bitterness and trials of it know what happens. Dear
> friend, dear companion, dear brother, as far as you are able,
> abandon this business, whether in religious or worldly matters, save
> out of necessity, at such times as you yourself think best.637

Rivalry between Rashti and Qazvīnī was for some time an important
element in the local politics of Karbala. Since about 1822, the city had been “a

self­governing semi­alien republic”, effectively independent of the Ottoman
authorities in Baghdad.638 Some three­quarters of the inhabitants were Iranian,
and actual control of Karbala was in the hands of a band of from two to three
thousand girāmī – criminals and fugitives from Iran and Arab Iraq who made a
living preying on the local population and pilgrims to the shrines.639 The girāmī
were themselves split into at least two factions,640 the most powerful of which
was led by a certain Sayyid Ibrāhīm Zaʿfarānī.641 Both Rashti and Qazvīnī had
the support of a body of girāmī, the former having the allegiance of Zaʿfarānī
(who may have been a Shaykhi), the latter relying on a force under a chief
named Mīrzā Ṣāliḥ, who was regarded as the most powerful leader next to
Zaʿfarānī.642 Zaʿfarānī’s (and, thus, Rashti’s) position was strengthened by the
support of Sayyid Wahhāb, the titular governor of the city,643 and, by 1842, he
was in absolute control.644

In Shaban 1258/September 1842, a new pasha, Muḥammad Najīb, arrived
in Baghdad to replace ʿAlī Riḍāʾ.645 Unlike his predecessors, Najīb Pāshā was
not willing to tolerate the continued independence of Karbala. By the end of
Ramadan/October, the failure of the population to send supplies to Baghdad in
recognition of the authority of the central government, and their refusal to allow
his entry to their city, even as a pilgrim, with more than four or five attendants,
determined Najīb to insist on the reception of a military garrison there.646 When
Zaʿfarānī declared that, should the pasha come to Karbala with troops, he would
refuse him entry, the latter decided to make his entrance to the city by force if
necessary.647 He proceeded towards Karbala with an army in Dhū ’l­
Qaʿda/December and pitched camp at nearby Musayyab.648 Negotiations now
began with representatives of the population of Karbala, in which Rashti played
a leading role.

While Najīb Pāshā was encamped at Musayyab, he was visited for four
days by a deputation from the city, composed of the nominal governor, Sayyid
Wahhāb, ʿAlī Shāh Ẓill al­Sulṭān, Sayyid Kāẓim, Sayyid Ḥusaynī, and Sayyid
Naṣr Allāh.649 Before this party returned to Karbala in the hope of persuading
the inhabitants to cede to some of the demands of the pasha, the latter requested
Rashti and Ẓill al­Sulṭān to try to persuade the Iranian section of the population
to dissociate themselves from the girāmī factions; ideally, they were to quit the
town or, if this were impossible, to retire to one quarter of it or take refuge in the
shrines of Ḥusayn and ʿAbbās.650 It is likely that, on this same occasion, Najīb
assured both Rashti and Ẓill al­Sulṭān that anyone seeking refuge in their houses
would be spared in the event of an attack.651 The Iranian consul in Baghdad also
seems to have written on two occassions to Rashti, requesting his assistance in
persuading the Persian population to evecuate the town, although the Sayyid
later maintained that he never received his letters to this effect.652

Najīb Pāshā now received reinforcements and, on 19 December, Saʿd
Allāh Pāshā, the military commander, arrived before Karbala.653 During the
month that now passed before the assault on the town, Rashti and Ẓill al­Sulṭān

visited Saʿd Allāh in an effort to effect some compromise, but they remained
unable to persuade the townspeople to accede to the pasha’s demands.654 In the
town, the Shiʿi ulama were urging the people to fight a jihad against the Sunni
forces of the pasha,655 while the girāmī took steps to prepare the town to repel
the coming attack.656 In contrast, Rashti—who, in the absence of Qazvīnī in
Baghdad, was the leading mujtahid in the city – made strenuous efforts to effect
a reconcilliation and to dissuade the Karbala’is from undertaking what he must
have recognized would be a hopeless defence. According to Colonel Francis
Farrant (1803­1868)

> The Chief Priest Hajee Seid Kausem did all in his power to prevent
> hostilities, he preached against their proceedings, he was abused
> and threatened, they would not listen to him—this I have heard
> from many people at Kerballa—at this time all were unaimous in
> defending the place… to the very last he entreated them to listen to
> the Pacha but without avail, he showed great courage on the
> occasion, as he had all the chief Geramees and the Mollahs against
> him.657
On 13 January 1843, the forces of Najīb Pāshā stormed Karbala658 and, as
is well known, put to the sword large numbers of the inhabitants and caused
widespread destruction.659 Estimates of the numbers killed vary tremendously,660
but at least four thousand people are thought to have perished. In the course of
the sack, the only places accorded immunity were the shrine of Ḥusayn,661 the
house of Ẓill al­Sulṭān, and the house of Sayyid Kazim Rashti.662 It is hard to
estimate how many took refuge in Rashti’s house and in the adjoining houses
which he appropriated for the occasion,663 but that the number of refugees was
large may be surmised from the fact that between sixty and and two hundred
people were crushed to death in the melée.664

On the day following his capture of Karbala, Najīb Pāshā entered the city
and was greeted in the Shrine of Ḥusayn by a party of its surviving notables,
including Ḥājj Mahdī Kamūna, the deputy kalīd­dār (keeper of the keys) of the
shrine, Sayyid Kazim, Mullā ʿAlī al­Khaṣṣī, Shaykh Wādī al­Shaflaḥ, and
others.665 Despite his unpopularity prior to the fighting, Rashti’s offices in
securing the safety of so many citizens, and the obvious accuracy of his earlier
evaluation of the state of affairs, as well as his reputation as one of the few
individuals in the city who had tried to persuade the townspeople not to resist
the Baghdad troops, meant that his prestige was now higher than ever. Although
he himself died almost exactly one year after the attack, his son Sayyid Aḥmad
continued to exercise influence in the city. According to Chahārdihī, he
possessed authority in the appointment and dismissal of the Keeper of the Keys
of the shrine of Ḥusayn,666 and was regarded as one of a small number of
individuals closely attached to the Ottoman court.667 The Rashti family has
remained prominent in Karbala since then.668

Apart from his personal position, Rashti’s preaching, wide
correspondence, and increasing popular classes were instrumental in heightening
the prestige and expanding the numbers of the Shaykhi school in both Iraq and
Iran. Aleksandr Kazem­Bek (1802­1870) states that “during the life of Sayyid
Kāẓim, the doctrine of the Shaykhis spread throughout Persia, so much so that,
in the province of Iraq alone, there were more than one hundred thousand
murīds.”669 Exaggerated as this figure probably is—even if, as seems likely, it is
intended to include Arab Iraq—there is no doubt that the number of those who
gave some form of allegiance to Shaykhism was considerable. Aside from
sizeable groups in larger towns such as Kirmanshah, Tabriz, and (possibly)
Kirman, many small towns and villages in Iran, such as Mīlān in Azerbaijan,
were, it seems, predominantly Shaykhi.670

Had Rashti not died at a relatively early age or had Sayyid Aḥmad been
able to preserve the unity of the school and maintain Karbala as its center, it is
more than likely that, with time, Shaykhism would have come to exercise
increasing influence on political circles in both Iraq and Iran. Its potential as a
religious movement attractive to statesmen such as Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā
Dawlatshāh, Ibrāhīm Khān Ẓāhir al­Dawla, and Sulaymān Khān Afshār has
already been demonstrated in the case of both al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti. In later
years, however, no Shaykhi leader commanded the respect or influence of the
two shaykhs. Nevertheless, it should be noted that, when the Kirmani Shaykhi
leader Ḥājī Abu ’l­Qāsim Khān Ibrāhīmī (1896­1969) died on a pilgrimage to
Mashhad in 1969, Mohammad Reza Shah himself defied ant­Shaykhi sentiment
in signifying that he be buried with ceremony in the precincts of the shrine and
that a large memorial meeting be held in the capital.

For the most part, the school remained an important private religious
alternative for many princes and government officials.671 The most significant
example of this is the “conversion” to Shaykhism of Muẓaffar al­Dīn Shāh
(1853­1907), who was encouraged to adopt it as his personal faith by his
mother, Shawkat al­Dawla (1838­1892), a niece of Karīm Khān Kirmānī.672
Although the later influence of Shaykhism was largely confined to individuals
on a personal basis, in certain areas, such as Tabriz and Kirman, it proved a
continuing factor in local politics. Bāstānī Pārīzī has drawn attention to the fact
that, since the governors of Kirman during the later Qajar period were generally
princes of the royal house, related to the family of Karīm Khān, they tended to
favor the Shaykhi sect in the city, a policy which provoked the resentment of
most of the population.673 In 1905, serious trouble broke out between the
Shaykhi and non­Shaykhi sections of the populace, in the course of which deep­
rooted political and economic divisions in the city came to the surface.674 In
general, however, Shaykhism never regained the prestige it had acquired under
Rashti’s leadership; as we shall see, the emergence of Babism as a radical
religio­political movement forced the remaining branches of what was now a

divided school to adopt a quietist and non­interventionist position in politics,
coupled with the use of taqiyya in religious matters.

Following the sack of Karbala, the Shiʿi population of the city was
obliged to observe taqiyya during the initial period of occupation by the Sunni
troops of Najīb Pāshā.675 According to Kirmānī, the strain of the siege and
attack, and the stresses imposed on him during the occupation of Karbala had a
crippling effect on Sayyid Kāẓim; his hair grew white and he became physically
debilitated.676 In early Dhū ’l­Qaʿda 1259/late November 1843, according to his
custom, Rashti left Karbala, accompanied by a number of followers, to perform
a pilgrimage to Kazimiyya.677 Returning to Karbala in the early days of Dhū ’l­
Ḥijja/ late December,678 in time for the festival of al­ʿArafa on the 9th/31st, he
died in the early hours of the evening of 11 Dhū ’l­Hijja/1 January 1844.679 This
date, which is given in Shaykhi sources, seems confirmed by a statement in a
letter written by the Bab from prison to his uncle, Hājī Mīrzā Sayyid ʿAlī
Shīrāzī (d. 1850), in which he says that Rashti died “nineteen days before the
revelation of the mystery,” and that the beginning of this “revelation” was the
start of the year 1260.680 We can, I think, dismiss as fictitious accounts which
claim that Rashti was poisoned in Baghdad by Najīb Pāshā.681

CHAPTER FOUR: FROM SHAYKHISM TO BABISM

The Succession to Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti

The death of Rashti precipitated the first major internal crisis in the Shaykhi
school, of which he had been the acknowledged head for some seventeen years.
To be more precise, it created a situation in which concealed tensions,
disagreements, rivalries and ambitions within the Shaykhi community were
brought to the surface. Rashti did not, for reasons that are unclear, emulate al­
Ahsaʾi in appointing a successor, nor did he leave clear instructions as to the
direction of the school after his death. Since he was relatively young when he
died, it may simply be that he had not thought it yet necessary to take steps to
provide for this eventuality. Without a clear appointment of a successor to the
Sayyid, the school rapidly fragmented into several factions, of which the two
largest were those grouped around Sayyid ʿAlī Muḥammad Shīrāzī, the Bab
(1235­66/1819­50) and Ḥājī Mullā Muḥammad Karīm Khān Kirmānī (1225­
88/1810­71).

These two factions in particular expressed diametrically opposed
tendencies inherent in Shaykhism, the first moving away from the outward

practice of Islam towards a concentration on the revelation of its inner (bāṭinī)
features and, ultimately, a new revelation (ẓuhūr) following the appearance of
the hidden Imam; the second emphasizing the continuing role of the Prophet and
the Imams and seeking accommodation with the Shiʿi majority which had
formerly excommunicated the founder of the school and his successor. It was
inevitable that, once these incompatible interpretations of Shaykhi thought came
to be openly expressed, an unrelenting hostility would grow up between the two
parties, fiercer if anything than that which previously existed Shaykhis and
Bālāsarīs.

Karīm Khān Kirmānī himself acknowledges that Rashti had not indicated
a successor in direct terms and that, on his death, a number of leaders gained a
following, while many of his disciples scattered to different places.682 That
considerable confusion existed in the mind’s of Rashti’s followers is apparent
from a number of statements in an Arabic risāla written in reply to Karīm
Khān’s Izhāq al­bāṭil by an early Babi of Karbala named al­Qatīl ibn al­
Karbalā’ī, who had himself been in the circle of the Sayyid’s companions.
“Those among the ṭullāb who were possessed of discernment,” he writes, “were
confused as to where they should go and to whom they should cling.”683 He
himself, he states at the beginning of the treatise, did not know where to turn
during the first four months following Rashti’s death.”684 This confusion appears
to have been compounded by the dissemination of various rumors and reports,
some of them vaguely messianic in character, others relating to the question of
the direction of the school in the period immediately after the death of the
Sayyid.

Among these reports were a number in which Rashti was said to have
alluded obliquely to an “affair” or “cause” (amr) which would occur or appear
after him. According to Kirmānī, his reply to those who asked him about his
successor (al­khalīfa baʿdahu) had been to say, “God has an affair which he
shall bring to maturity (li ’llāhi amrun huwa bālighuhu).”685 Rashti’s use of the
phrase was certainly not accidental, and must have been calculated to evoke
specific associations in the minds of his hearers; it was, in fact, the very phrase
traditionally ascribed to the fourth nā'ib of the hidden Imam, Abu ’l­Ḥusayn ʿAlī
al­Sammarī, when asked on his death­bed concerning the matter of
succession.686

That Rashti made use of this phrase in this connection more than once is
apparent from a reference in al­Qatīl ibn al­Karbalā’ī’s Risāla, where it is
recorded that the Sayyid was asked about his successor by Mullā Muḥammad
Taqī Harawī,687 to whom he made this reply, adding, however, the qualification
“our cause is not like that of the abwāb.”688 The significance of this last
statement is not entirely clear: as we shall observe, a section of the Shaykhi
community at this period certainly seems to have regarded both al­Ahsaʾi and
Rashti as “gates” of the Imām, a belief which was instrumental in facilitating the

transition to Babism. It is possible that Rashti was thought to have been
implying that, whereas the Imam had gone into major occultation on the death of
the fourth bāb, he might now be preparing to return. That the “affair” or “cause”
to which the Sayyid referred was in some way linked to the advent of the Imam
or to have been synonymous with that event or the preparations for it, seems
clear from his statement: “Are you not content that I should die and the cause of
your Imam (amr imāmikum) be made manifest?”689

Zarandī ascribes a similar remark to the Sayyid, though endowing it with
more obviously messianic overtones: “Would you not wish me to die, that the
promised One be revealed?”690 Mullā Jaʿfar Qazvīnī similarly states that he was
present when Rashti said “are you not content that I should go and the truth
(ḥaqq) be made manifest?”691 The messianic quality of Rashti’s utterances on
this topic is apparent in the following statement attributed to Qurrat al­ʿAyn: “O
people! My passing is near, yet you have not understood what I have been
saying to you, nor have you comprehended my purpose. After me, there shall
appear a great cause and a severe test and you shall fall into disagreements with
one another. We have been but as a herald (mubashshir) for the great cause.”692
As we shall see in more detail later, this chiliastic strain played an important role
in the development of Babism as an expression of the more extreme charismatic
and gnostic tendencies within the school. And it is, of course, more than likely
that the messianic themes developed in Babism may have coloured most of the
reports we have just quoted.

According to at least two accounts, Rashti had instructed certain of his
followers to stay after his death with Mullā Muḥammad Ḥasan Qarāchadāghī
(Mullā Ḥasan Gawhar) for “a little time” (bi­zamānin qalīl) until “our affair
would appear”.693 Mullā Jaʿfar Qazvīnī writes that someone asked Rashti to
whom his followers should turn after him; he replied that it was permissible to
turn to anyone but that “for some days, you should stay about Mullā Ḥasan
Gawhar.” He later explained that Mullā Ḥasan would be there for forty­five days
and then the truth would be manifested.694 Although Mullā Ḥasan’s position
remained at first ambiguous, there is no doubt that many of Rashti’s followers
thought it natural to be referred to him.

A former pupil of al­Ahsaʾi, Mullā Ḥasan was one of the oldest and most
highly regarded disciples of the Sayyid, from whom he held an ijāza.695 Several
works by him are still extant,696 and it seems that some of these had received the
direct approval of Rashti.697 It would not have been surprising if a section of the
Shaykhi community in Karbala should have looked on Mullā Ḥasan as a
potential successor to Rashti and, as we shall note, it was not long before he put
forward a claim to succession on his own behalf. Initially, however, the question
of succession remained in abeyance while news of Rashti’s death made its way
to Shaykhi communities outside the ʿatabāt.

Al­Qatīl ibn al­Karbalā’ī states that, following Rashti’s funeral, some of
the ṭullāb approached Mullā Ḥasan and his close associate, Mīrzā Muḥammad

Ḥusayn Muḥīṭ Kirmānī, and asked if they heard anything from the Sayyid
concerning the succession. Mullā Ḥasan replied that he had heard nothing, while
Mīrzā Muḥīṭ implied that he had, in fact, been told something but that he could
not at that time reveal what it was; they should not disperse, he said, but remain
in Karbala.698

As if in corroboration of Mīrzā Muhīt’s advice to await developments, a
rumor became current to the effect that Rashti has said “the affair shall be made
manifest one year after me.”699 Currency also seems to have been given to a
prophecy, allegedly related by Rashti himself, which had been made in a dream
to one of the members of his household, and in which it was stated that the
“affair” would be manifested in another thirty weeks.700 These thirty weeks,
according to al­Qatīl ibn al­Karbalā’ī, would be completed at the beginning of
Jumādī I 1260/late May 1844,701 and it was probably under the influence of this
second rumor that numbers of ṭullāb waited out the four months of Muḥarram,
Ṣafar, Rabīʿ I and Rabīʿ II, thinking that Mīrzā Muḥīṭ might be right in what he
said.702

It seems, however, that Mīrzā Muḥīṭ said or did something unspecified
which caused many to reject him, whereupon they dispersed from Karbala,703
some even before the four­month period had ended. That a substantial number
of Shaykhis left Karbala in different directions at about this time is indicated in
several sources. We have already referred to Kirmānī’s statement to the effect in
Izhāq al­Bāṭil. This version of events is substantially corroborated by Mīrzā
Ḥusayn Khān Dakhīlī, the son of Mullā Ḥusayn Dakhīl, a Shaykhi who had
lived in Karbala with Mullā Muḥammad Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī (the first of Shīrāzī’s
disciples) and who also later became a Babi. Mīrzā Ḥusayn Khān writes: “after
the death of the late Sayyid, his companions scattered, and from whomsoever
they heard a call, they would go in search of the lord of the affair (ṣāḥib­i
amr).”704 Zarandī indicates, however, that, when Mullā Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī
returned to Karbala on 1 Muḥarram 1260/ January 1844, he met with Mullā
Ḥasan Gawhar, Mīrzā Muḥīṭ, “and other well­known figures among the
disciples of Sayyid Kāẓim,” and that these individuals advanced pretexts for not
leaving Karbala.705

With the dispersal of many of the ṭullāb within about two months of
Mullā Ḥusayn’s arrival, the main area of events moved, for a time, from Arab
Iraq to Iran.

In Iran, the bid for leadership of the Shaykhi community came to be
centered in three places: Tabriz, Kirman, and Shīrāz. In Tabriz, two men made
simultaneous claims, each of them achieving considerable success in
establishing his position as a leader of the Shaykhis in Azerbaijan, but neither
succeeded in winning very much of a following outside this region. The first of
these was Ḥājj Mīrzā Shafīʿ Thiqat al­Islām (c. 1218­1301/1803­1884) a
mujtahid who, in 1242/1826, had gone to the ʿatabāt to complete his studies
under Shaykh Ḥasan al­Najafi, Shaykh ʿAlī al­Najafi, and Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti.

Having become a Shaykhi, he returned to Tabriz, where he encouraged students
to travel to Karbala in order to study under Rashti, whom he regarded as the
most learned (aʿlam) of the Shiʿi ulama. On Rashti’s death, he claimed that
succession was restricted to himself but, apart from styling himself “shaykh” of
the school, he does not appear to have advanced any major claims on his own
behalf, nor to have introduced any radical changes in doctrine.706 There seems to
be no justification for the statement of Iʿtimād al­Salṭana that he claimed
rukniyyat (the status of being the rukn or support, on which see later) for a short
time.707 Mīrzā Shafīʿ appears to have left Tabriz and gone to live in Mecca
shortly before the revolt in Tabriz of the Kurdish leader Shaykh ʿUbayd Allāh
Naqshbandī, which occurred in 1298/1881.708 On his death in Mecca in 1301, at
the age of eighty­three, he was succeeded in Tabriz by his son, Shaykh Mūsā
Thiqat al­Islām (d. 1319/1910).709

The second claimant to succession in Tabriz was Mullā Muḥammad
Māmaqānī (or Mamaqānī) Ḥujjat al­Islām. It would seem that, for Māmaqānī,
succession meant little more than taking Rashti’s place as a marjaʿ al­taqlīd for
all those who regarded themselves as muqallid to him. He played down the
charismatic and gnostic aspects of Shaykhism to such a degree that he became a
highly respectable figure within the orthodox community in the region, being
widely regarded as a marja‘ for government officials, nobles, ṭujjār, and bazaar
merchants; these followers built for him the Masjid­i Ḥujjat al­Islām beside the
Masjid­i­Jāmiʿ of Tabriz.710 On his death in 1268/1851 or 1269/1852, he was
succeeded by his son, Mīrzā Muḥammad Ḥusayn Ḥujjat al­Islām (d.
1303/1885), also a former student of Rashti.711

Apart from Thiqat al­Islām and Māmaqānī, there were several other
notable Shaykhis in Tabriz, the most outstanding of whom were Ḥājī Mullā
Mahmūd Niẓām al­ʿUlamāʾ (d. circa 1272/1856), the tutor of the Crown Prince,
Nāṣir al­Dīn Mīrzā; Mīrzā ʿAlī Aṣghar Shaykh al­Islām (d. 1264/1848), his son
Mīrzā Abu ’l­Qāsim Shaykh al­Islām, and Mullā ʿAlī Muʿīn al­Islām. Although
incidents between Shaykhis and Bālāsarīs took place intermittently in Tabriz,
notably riots in 1267/1850712 and 1285/1868,713 it is clear that the Shaykhi
notables and ulama of the city were particularly eager to identify themselves
with the main body of Shiʿism and to avoid, as far as possible, all imputations of
heterodoxy.

This trend towards orthodoxy was given added impetus by the emergence
of Babism as an identifiable and vulnerable target for the concerted attacks of
conventual Shiʿis and Shaykhis alike. The fact that, as we shall see, the Bab
himself and all but a few of his principal followers had been students of Rashti,
coupled with the continuing veneration shown by the Babis to him and to al­
Ahsaʾi as, in some sense “precursors”’ of their movement or as “the two
preceding bābs”, placed the remaining Shaykhis in serious danger of being
closely linked with Babism in the minds of the public and the ulama.

At first, this simply meant the continuation of some form of ostracism of
Shaykhism by many of the orthodox community but, before long, it began to
carry the risk of physical attacks from government and people. In order to offset
the unwelcome implications of their mutual origin, certain Shaykhi ulama,
particularly in Tabriz, proved eager to take a leading role in the theological,
judicial, and even physical assault on the Bab and his followers.

The trial of the Bab, held in Tabriz in August 1848, was attended by Nāsir
al­Din Mīrzā, leading government officials, religious dignitaries and eminent
members of the Shaykhi community, including Mullā Muḥammad Māmaqānī
and Mīrzā ʿAlī Aṣghar Shaykh al­Islam; it was directed by Hājī Mullā Mahmūd
Niẓam al­‘Ulama.714 Following the trial, in which the Shaykhi participants took
a prominent part, the Bab was bastinadoed at the home of Mīrzā ʿAlī Aṣghar by
the Shaykh al­Islam himself.715 In 1266/1850, when the Bab was brought to
Tabriz for execution, Māmaqānī was among the small number of ulama who
signed a fatwā for his death.716 Apart from a book by Mīrzā Muḥammad Taqī
Māmaqānī,717 however, the Shaykhi ulama of Tabriz—unlike their counterparts
in Kirman—do not appear to have engaged in much polemical conflict with the
Babis. There can be little doubt, nevertheless, that their direct involvement in the
condemnation of the Bab proved a significant factor in helping them ingratiate
themselves with the orthodox community, become integrated into it, and, in the
end, become wholly re­identified with it.

It was Kirman rather than Tabriz which finally came to be recognized as
the new center of Shaykhism, displacing Karbala for the majority of Iranian
Shaykhis and for smaller numbers in Iraq and elsewhere. In numerical and
historical terms, Babism had by far the greater impact, but it was in its Kirmānī
form that Shaykhism was to be preserved—albeit much modified—as a distinct
school within Twelver Shiʿism. If, on the one hand, the Shaykhis of Azerbaijan
were to stress and deepen the conservative elements in Shaykhi belief and
practice, rendering it practically indistinguishable from orthodox Shiʿism, and
the Babis, on the other hand, were to exploit the more extreme tendencies of the
school, breaking entirely from Islam before the lapse of many years, the
development initiated by Karīm Khān Kirmānī was to travel something of a
middle road, identifying and reinterpreting certain key themes in the works of
al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti in an unusual and unorthodox fashion while retaining a
strong sense of identity with and loyalty to Twelver Shiʿism as the true
expression of Islamic faith and practice.

Ḥājī Mullā Muḥammad Karīm Khān Kirmānī was born in Kirman on 18

Muḥarram 1225/23 February 1810.718 His father, Ibrāhīm Khān Ẓāhir al­Dawla,
was a cousin and son­in­law of Fatḥ­ʿAlī Shāh,719 and, at the beginning of the
latter’s reign, was appointed governor of Khurāsān, later being transferred to the
governorship of Kirman and Baluchistan,720 a position which he held from 1803
until his death in 1824.721 Ibrāhīm Khān’s relationship with the ruling dynasty
was strengthened by his marriage to Humāyūn Sulṭān Khānum­i Khānumān,722

the eldest daughter of Fatḥ­ʿAli and a sister of Ḥusayn ʿAlī Mīrzā Farmān­
Farmā and Ḥasan ʿAlī Mīrzā Shujāʿ al­Salṭana (1789­1853), and, by the
marriage of two of his sons to two other daughters of the monarch.723 In
addition, as we shall note, Karīm Khān was later married to a daughter of
Muḥammad Qulī Mīrzā Mulk Ārā (1789­1844), the third son of Fatḥ­ʿAli.

In the course of his term as governor of Kirman, Ibrāhīm Khān did much
to restore the physical property of the city.724 A deeply religious man, he showed
concern at the absence of fuqahāʾ in the region following the sack of Kirman by
Agha Muḥammad Shah in 1794, and invited ulama from Arabia, Khurāsān, and
Fārs to come and live there. He showed particular favor to Shaykh Aḥmad al­
Ahsaʾi , whom he met several times during the latter’s residence in Yazd and, as
we have noted, it has been suggested that it was through his influence that Fatḥ­
ʿAlī Shāh invited the Shaykh to Tehran in 1808.

It appears to have been his father’s wish that Karīm Khān be raised a
scholar (unlike his other sons, all of whom were given administrative posts
throughout Kirman province)725—possibly with the intention that he eventually
become the ʿālim in charge of the Madrasa­yi Ibrāhīmiyya which he had built in
1232/1817.726 Karīm was, therefore, provided with tutors as a child and, in
adolescence, continued his studies under the general supervision of Mullā
Muḥammad ʿAlī Nūrī Mullā­bāshī, whose daughter he married.727 On the death
of Ibrāhīm Khān in Tehran in 1240/1825, the inevitable wrangling broke out
among his sons, but Karīm is said to have avoided becoming involved in these
disagreements and to have continued with his studies and devotions.728 Shaykhi
sources relate that he concentrated on purely religious issues, endeavoring to
find the ‘Perfect Man’ (insān­i kāmil). In search of this individual, he associated
with a variety of sects and schools of thought but was, in the end directed by a
certain Hājī Muḥammad Ismāʿīl Kūhbanānī—a former pupil of al­Ahsaʾi729—to
visit Rashti in Karbala.730 Despite the efforts of the new governor, Ḥasan ʿAlī
Mīrzā, to prevent any of the sons of Ibrāhīm Khān leaving Kirman,731 Karīm
succeeded in making his way to the ʿatabāt, where he met and began to study
under Sayyid Kāẓim.

This first visit to Karbala took place in about 1828, when Karīm Khān
was eighteen, and was extended into a stay of one year. Returning to Kirman, he
continued his studies and gave classes to others for a time, before leaving once
more for Karbala, this time accompanied by his wife. He now became a close
disciple of Rashti, receiving considerable praise from his teacher and making
marked progress under his instruction. It was probably during this period that
Rashti wrote his ijāza for him, possibly the only one he ever received.732 After
some time, however, Rashti instructed him to return to Kirman in order to teach
the people there.733 It is possible that the Sayyid considered Karīm Khān, quite
apart from his undoubted intellectual capabilities, as a singularly valuable
supporter, in view of his close association with the Qajar family, his wealth, and
potential influence in the somewhat remote Kirman region. In sending him thus

to a part of Iran which seems to have had few Shaykhis, Rashti may have hoped
to establish a base of religious and political influence with which to offset the
damaging effects of the continuing campaign against the school.

Leaving his wife in Kazimiyya, Kirmānī headed for his home via
Hamadān. There he undertook what may, in the context of a possible drive
towards acquiring political influence, be considered a most significant action —
namely, the arrangement of a marriage with his half­cousin, one of the twenty­
three daughters of Muḥammad Qulī Mīrzā Mulk Ārā (1789­1844).734 Since the
girl in question was then in Tehran, he headed there for the marriage, afterwards
spending some time in the capital, where he improved his standing by
associating with Muḥammad Shah, whom he had previously met in Kirman.

It was not long, however, before he set off on the final stage of his
journey home, accompanied by his new wife.735 In Kirman, he continued to
correspond with Rashti, whose regard for him is apparent from numerous letters.
Among these is a brief letter in which he writes, speaking of Kirmānī, that “his
decree is to be obeyed and whatever he prefers is to be done; to reject him is to
reject God, the Prophet, and the blessed Imāms.”736 In another letter, Rashti
speaks of his “spiritual communion” and “mysterious relationships” with Karīm
Khān and assures him that he has a place “in the very core” of his heart and shall
not be forgotten by him.737 In yet another instance—and it is a particularly
significant one in view of subsequent events—he writes how, in speaking with a
certain Ḥājī Muḥammad ʿAlī in Samarra, he referred to Kirmānī (jināb­i Ḥājī)
as “a tongue uttering the truth, a speaking book,” and urged his companion to
“ask your questions of him and enquire of him concerning reality, for he shall
inform you of matters particular and general, brief and comprehensive, manifest
and hidden, save those things which are hidden in the hearts of men.”738 In view
of these and similar statements made in his respect by Rashti, it is scarcely
surprising that, on the latter’s death, Karīm Khān should have regarded himself
as the person most fit to assume the leadership of the school.

Kirmānī must have returned from Karbala in about 1255/1839.739 It seems
to have been shortly after his arrival that he became involved in a dispute
concerning the control of his father’s waqf properties, in particular the Madrasa­
yi Ibrāhīmiyya. The origins of this dispute are obscure, but its main outlines can
be reasonably well defined. In order to provide for the upkeep of the madrasa,
Ibrāhīm Khān had made over portions of his estates in Māzandarān and other
private lands as waqf properties.740 On his death, these properties, including the
madrasa itself, were probably placed in the hands of a mutawallī, but, when
Ḥasan Mullā ʿAlī became governor of Kirman in 1243/1828, he placed all the
financial affairs of Ẓāhir al­Dawla’s children under his personal supervision and,
although he did not directly interfere with the awqāf, probably exercised
considerable control over them.741

By the time of Karīm Khān’s return to Kirman following his first visit to
Karbala, around 1245/1828, Ḥasan ʿAlī Mīrzā’s position in the city seems to

have weakened somewhat, and Karīm was able to exercise some degree of
freedom in financial matters, giving the supervision of his personal properties to
a certain Āqā Sayyid Muḥammad ʿAlī and that of the madrasa and the waqf
properties belonging to it to Mullā ʿAlī, a local mujtahid.742 Already, during his
first stay in Karbala, he had offered to make over to Rashti all the property he
had inherited from his father; when this offer was refused, he promised Rashti
the payment of khums on his possessions, which proved acceptable.743

During his second absence in Iraq, however, matters seem to have fallen
very much out of his control or that of his appointees. Fīrūz Mīrzā Nuṣrat al­
Dawla (1819­1886) became governor of Kirman in 1253/1837, replacing Ḥasan
ʿAlī Maḥallātī (1800­1881), the first of the Āghā Khān Ismaili leaders.744 He
seems to have attempted to exercise control over the ulama of the city by means
of a policy of divide and rule: a year after his arrival, he expelled from Kirman
Ākhūnd Mullā ʿAlī Akbar, a rigorously puritanical divine who insisted upon
close observance of the religious law.745 At the same time, he showed
considerable favor towards two mujtahids, Mullā ʿAlī Tūnī (known as Aʿmā)
and Ḥājī Sayyid Jawād Shīrāzī.

Under the patronage of Fīrūz Mīrzā, Sayyid Jawād succeeded in replacing
Ākhūnd Mullā ʿAlī Akbar as Kirman’s Imām­Jumʿa, a position which he held
until his death in 1287/1870.746 Sayyid Jawād also improved his prestige in the
city by marrying one of the daughters of Ibrāhīm Khān.747 He and Mullā ʿAlī
Tūnī became increasingly involved in the affairs of the madrasa and the waqf of
Ẓāhir al­Dawla about the time of Karīm Khān’s return to Kirman, and managed
to exercise such influence over the ṭullāb that the latter was unable to regain
control of the waqf.748

Kirmānī, in retaliation, declared the waqf invalid, meaning to inherit it
personally as irth property, and applied for confirmation of his fatwā from Mullā
Muḥammad Bāqir Shaftī in Isfahan.749 Shaftī’s concurrence notwithstanding, the
ṭullāb refused to hand over the madrasa until one of Kirmānī’s followers
succeeded in taking control one night by means of a ruse; on the following day,
Shaykhi ṭullāb were installed in the madrasa, which has remained in their hands
since then.750 It seems that Kirmānī’s position was further strengthened by his
success in persuading the other children of Ibrāhīm Khān each to make his share
of the inheritance into waqf.751 Although he did not manage the waqf personally,
leaving it instead in the hands of trustees,752 there is no doubt that much of
Karīm Khān’s power in Kirman—as, indeed that of his descendants—derived
from his ultimate control over much of his father’s vast wealth. It is said that he
received an annual income from his relatives of from two to three thousand
tomans, in the form of khums and zakāt.753

On Rashti’s death, Karīm Khān, then aged thirty­four, began to claim for
himself the leadership of the Shaykhi community through out Iran and Iraq and,
within a short time, was able to draw to himself the majority of Iranian and a
number of Arab Shaykhis who had not become Babis. In general, those

Shaykhis who became followers of the Bab only to abandon him at a later stage
in the development of his doctrines, tended to turn to Kirmānī as an alternative.
By the end of his life, he had so consolidated his position as head of the sect that
the succession, after a brief dispute, passed to his second son, Ḥājj Muḥammad
Khān Kirmānī (1263­1324/1846­1906), passing from him to his brother Ḥājj
Zayn al­ʿĀbidīn Khān Kirmānī (1276­1360/1859­1941), from him to his son
Ḥājj Abu’l­Qasīm Khān Ibrāhīmī (1314­89/1896­1969), and from him to the last
Kirmani head of the school, Ḥājj ʿAbd al­Riḍāʾ Khān Ibrāhīmī (d. 1979).754

Our sources do not make entirely clear the details of how Kirmānī
established his position as head of the Shaykhi community at Kirman and,
before long, in Iran as a whole, but the general outlines of this development can
be reconstructed from a careful examination of the materials currently available.
It seems that Sayyid ʿAlī Kirmānī, who acted as amanuensis to Rashti in
Karbala,755 initiated a belief that he referred, albeit in somewhat cryptic fashion,
to Karīm Khān as being the aware of the identity of his successor. In a letter
which he is said to have forged in the Sayyid’s name, and which may have been
written in Rashti’s lifetime, Sayyid ʿAlī quoted the tradition frequently
attributed to the Imām Alī, which ends with the words “I am the point beneath
the bāʾ”; he then went on to write, apparently in reference to Karīm Khān, that
“you are aware of him, and have met with the point of knowledge and have
reached the goal.”756 This letter was read to some of the ṭullāb and caused a
certain amount of tumult; it was, according to al­Karbalā’ī, a factor in
encouraging certain ṭullāb to leave for Kirman after Rashti’s death. Although
Karīm Khān himself does not appear to have been a party to this forgery, al­
Karbalā’ī thinks that he may indeed have been informed as to the “bearer”
(ḥamīl) of knowledge after Sayyid Kāẓim.757 Sayyid ʿAlī also seems to have
been instrumental in fostering similar ideas concerning Karīm Khān in Kirman
as well. In a letter to Kirman, apparently written after Rashti’s death, he stated
that the Sayyid had said, “a certain person (fulān) is informed as to the point of
knowledge (nuqṭat al­ʿilm), and that person is spiritual… and more worthy [than
others] to be followed; it is permissible to gain knowledge from him.”758
According to al­Karbalā’ī, it was to this that Kirmānī referred in his Izhāq al­
bāṭil, in writing of Rashti that “he indicated what he indicated,”759 with
reference to the matter of succession.

Karīm Khān was not, however, entirely passive in this matter. After
Rashti’s death, he wrote letters to the Shaykhis of Kazimiyya and to Mīrzā
Muḥīṭ Kirmānī, Mullā Ḥasan Gawhar and Prince Sulaymān Mirza,760 claiming
to be “the one arising in the cause after him that is hidden from men (al­qāʾim bi
’l­amr baʿda ’l­ghāʾib ʿan al­nās).”761 It seems that, at a later stage, following
his defection from Babism, Kirmānī employed Mullā Jawād Vilyānī as his
“herald” (munād) both to carry letters from him and to write on his behalf to
others.762 The exact nature of the claims put forward by Kirmānī in these letters
is unclear. Raḍavī maintains that, immediately following the death of Rashti, the

Khān claimed that “one thousand gates of knowledge were opened to me, and
within each of those gates another thousand gates lay open.”763 The implication
appears to be that, just as Rashti became the bearer of the knowledge which al­
Ahsaʾi had derived from the Imāms, so Karīm Khān, in his turn, was the
recipient of the same supernaturally acquired knowledge. There is also, almost
certainly, a conscious reference to a ḥadīth in which it is stated that the Prophet
“taught” ʿAlī one thousand gates (of knowledge), from each of which another
thousand opened.764

In general, Kirmānī succeeded in attracting a following by emerging as
the chief representative of certain views and tendencies which appealed to a
large section of the Shaykhi school, notably the more cautious and conservative
section. His prodigious output of works on numerous topics and the comparative
simplicity of most of his Persian writings ensured a rapid spread of his fame and
a wide popularity. The emergence of Babism proved to be of particular help to
him in consolidating his influence with that section of the school to which he
made the strongest appeal, because it gave him the opportunity to make clear his
position on the important question of the relationship of Shaykhism to Shiʿism
as a whole, and to define his attitude towards more extreme Shaykhi views,
particularly those being exploited within the context of Babism. While
conserving the identity of the school, Kirmānī and his successors strove to drive
a wedge between its present and its past and to integrate it as far as possible with
the orthodox community, largely by playing down those elements in the original
Shaykhi teachings which clashed most forcibly with traditional or contemporary
views, and by emphasizing those aspects which asserted their identity with
accepted Shiʿi beliefs.

This emphasis can be seen throughout the works of Karīm Khān, such as
his well­known Irshād al­ʿawwām, but we may use as a convenient example
section seventeen of his Risāla­yi sī faṣl, written in 1269/1853.765 The section
was written in reply to the request to “provide an explanation of the beliefs of
Shaykhism”, and begins with the words: “If you should wish for a brief reply,
our beliefs are the beliefs of all Twelver Shiʿis; whatever the Shiʿis agree upon
in respect of the principles (uṣūl) of religion, we confess the same, and whatever
they reject, we also reject. We regard the consensus (ijmāʿ) of the Shiʿis on the
bases and subsidiaries (furūʿ) of faith as evident and proven.” The rest of the
section is a summary of standard Shiʿi beliefs concerning God, the Prophet, and
the Imāms, in a manner resembling the more detailed discussion provided by al­
Ahsaʾi in his Ḥayāt al­nafs and by Rashti in his Risāla­yi uṣūl al­ʿaqāʾid.

We have noted above how the trend towards orthodoxy among many
Shaykhis after the death of Rashti was given impetus by the emergence of
Babism as a definable target for Bālāsarīs and Shaykhis alike. For Kirmānī, the
emergence of such a target proved the key to the establishment of his own role
as the defender of Shaykhism against the heretical views of the Babi Shaykhis
and as the leader of the rapprochement with authority, such a role making him

an obvious focus for the less radical element in the school. His attacks on the
Bab, which he carried out from the pulpit and through the writing and
dissemination of four extended refutations, had the virtue of being, on the one
hand, negative in its uncompromising rejection of Babism as an innovation
(bidʿa) essentially unconnected with Shaykhism and, on the other, positive in its
consolidation of the orthodox Shiʿi position which he was seeking to adopt for
the school and its doctrines. It is worth noting that, in all four refutations, in
particular the earliest, Izhāq al­bāṭil, considerably more space is devoted to
argument in favor of orthodox doctrine than to condemnation of Babi belief.

Sayyid ʿAlī Muḥammad Shīrāzī

The main details of the life of the Bab have been dealt with adequately if, at
times, sketchily and hagiographically, in several separate works, to which
reference may be made.766 We need only note here a few basic facts of his early
life, both in an attempt to clarify and reinterpret the details, and in order to serve
as background to the more general events under discussion. Named ʿAlī
Muḥammad,767 he was born in Muḥarram 1235/20 October 1819768 to a
prominent family of Ḥusaynī sayyids in Shīrāz.769 His father, Sayyid
Muḥammad Riḍāʾ, was a prosperous wholesale merchant (tājir), dealing in cloth
from premises in Shīrāz and Būshehr, in conjunction with members of his wife’s
family.770 Apart from Ḥājī Mīrzā Muḥammad­Ḥasan Shīrāzī (Mīrzāy­i­Shīrāzī)
(1815­1895) and Ḥājī Sayyid Jawād Shīrāzī—both paternal cousins of the Bab’s
father—the family would seem to have had no members among the ulama,
although the Bab’s maternal uncles and some other relatives appear to have been
active adherents of the Shaykhi school.771 The Bab himself received some six or
seven years basic schooling at a local maktab,772 but it is clear that he was
destined to join his uncles in running the family business. Although he may have
been involved in business pursuits from as early as the age of ten,773 he did not
leave the maktab until he was about thirteen and did not take a full part in the
family concerns until he reached fifteen.774 Shortly after this, he moved to
Bushehr with his uncle and guardian, Hājī Mīrzā Sayyid ʿAlī, and, after four
years trading in partnership there, became independent at the age of nineteen.775

The Bab’s own attitude towards commerce, however, was certainly
negative, and he seems to have become increasingly preoccupied with religious
and intellectual pursuits. In his earliest extant work, a short risāla on sulūk, he
remarks that “a Jewish dog is better than the people of the bazaar, for the latter
are they that hesitate on the path”776—a telling illustration of his attitude towards
the merchant classes at this stage. Perhaps even more significant is a statement
in the Ṣaḥīfa bayna ’l­ḥaramayn, written in early 1261/1845, to the effect that
“the science of fiqh is obligatory for all those who wish to engage in commerce;
it is not permissible for anyone who believes in God to carry out trading (al­
tijāra) without a knowledge of fiqh.”777

The frequent citations of aḥādīth, allusions to and quotations from works
of Shiʿi scholarship, and detailed discussions of matters relating to points of fiqh
and kalām in works such as the Tafsīr Sūrat al­baqara, Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar,
Risāla furūʿ al­Adliyya and Dalaʾil­i sabʿa, suggest that the Bab himself
acquired considerable familiarity with theological literature about this period.778
It seems that, while he was in Bushehr, he began to compose works of a
devotional and theological character, including sermons (khuṭub) and eulogies of
the Imāms.779 In the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ, he himself refers to works written by
him for other merchants during his days in Būshehr.780 According to ʿAbd al­
Ḥusayn Āvāra, some of these works were read by Shaykhis and excited curiosity
as to the identity of their author.781

Nicolas—who does not, unfortunately, cite his authority for the
statement—maintains that the first work penned by the Bab was a treatise
entitled Risāla­yi fiqhiyya, composed in Bushehr at the age of nineteen.782 No
manuscript of this work is known to exist, but there are a number of copies
extant of a short treatise which appears to have been written in the lifetime of
Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti. This is the risāla on sulūk referred to above. It would
seem from a passage near the end of this treatise, in which the Bab refers to “my
lord, protector, and teacher, Ḥājī Sayyid Kāẓim al­Rashti, may God prolong his
life,” that it was written between 1255/1839, when the Bab visited Karbala for a
year, and the death of Rashti at the beginning of 1844.783 It seems that the
composition and distribution of these early works by the Bab excited some
degree of controversy: Ḥājī Sayyid Javād Karbalāʾī, a prominent Shaykhi who
had close ties with the Bab’s family, is recorded as stating that Hājī Mīrzā
Sayyid Muḥammad, one of the Bab’s uncles, once approached him with a
request to “give some good counsel to my nephew . . . tell him not to write
certain things which can only arouse the jealousy of some people: these people
cannot bear to see a young merchant of little schooling show such erudition,
they feel envious.”784 The Bab himself indicates in the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ that his
relatives treated his activities with considerable disapproval.785

In the end, ascetic practice and religious matters gradually came to occupy
the Bab’s mind to the exclusion of his business affairs, and, in 1255/1839, he
closed up his office in Bushehr and headed for Karbala.786 He remained at the
ʿatabāt for about one year,787 during which period he attended the classes of
Rashti, who received him with much attention on several occasions.788
According to al­Karbalāʾī, the Bab remained at the ʿatabāt for eleven months,
eight in Karbala and three at other shrines; when in Karbala, he would attend the
classes of Rashti every two or three days.789 Aḥmad Rūḥī Kirmānī states that he
attended the general classes given by Rashti every day.790 Balyuzi has argued, in
keeping with the Babi/Bahaʾi hagiographical tradition of innate knowledge
(ʿilm­i ladunī), that “these occasional visits did not and could not make Him a
pupil or disciple of Sayyid Kāẓim.”791 While this certainly correct in the sense
that the Bab never completed a full “course” of studies on the basis of which he

might have been granted an ijāza by Rashti or another mujtahid, it is misleading
in terms of his mental attitude towards Sayyid Kāẓim. We have already quoted
the Risāla fi ’l­sulūk, in which the Bab refers to Rashti as “my lord, support, and
teacher (sayyidī wa muʿtamadī wa muʿallimī)”; in an early prayer, he speaks of
himself as having been “one of the companions of Kāẓim, may my spirit be his
sacrifice.”792 Similar references may be found in numerous other early letters.793

It seems that, while in Karbala, the Bab also studied Arabic literature
under Mullā Ṣādiq Khurāsānī (d. 1889), who later became one of his most active
converts.794

Several sources indicate that, in the course of his stay in Karbala and,
particularly, his visits to the classes of Rashti, the Bab became acquainted with
and attracted a certain amount of attention from a number of Shaykhis, many of
whom later became his followers. These included Shaykh Ḥasan Zunūzī,795
Mullā Jaʿfar Qazvīnī,796 Mullā Ṣādiq Khurāsānī,797 Mullā Muḥammad Ḥusayn
Bushrūʾī,798 Mīrzā Muḥammad­ʿAlī Nahrī and his brother Mīrzā Hādī (d.
1848),799 Mullā Aḥmad Muʿallim Ḥisārī,800 Mīrzā Muḥammad Rawḍa­Khān
Yazdī801 and Hājī Sayyid Javād Karbalāʾī (d. 1882)802 Mīrzā Ḥusayn Khān
Dakhīlī, a son of Mullā Ḥusayn Dakhīl Marāghaʾī, states in an unidentified
manuscript that his father met the Bab with Sayyid Kāẓim and that a group of
mutual friends used to talk about him before Rashti’s death. This group included
Mīrzā Aḥmad Ibdāl Marāghaʾī (d. 1849), Āqā Muḥammad Ḥasan, Āqā
Muḥammad­Ḥusayn Marāghaʾī (d. 1850), and Mullā ʿAlī Ardabīlī.803 That the
Bab met and served Sayyid Kāẓim and was held in respect while in Karbala is
also noted by Kirmānī in his first polemic against him, the Izhāq al­bāṭil,
although he does point out that he himself never met him.804

After about one year, in 1256/1840 or, according to another version, in the
autumn of 1841,805 the Bab ceded to requests from his mother and uncles and
returned to Shīrāz. Before long, however, he seems to have grown restless again
and planned to go back to Iraq. The family, reluctant for him to leave,
intervened once more, arranging a marriage for him on 18 Rajab 1258/25
August 1842, to Khadīja Bagum (1820­1882), a daughter of his mother’s
paternal uncle, Ḥājī Mīrzā Sayyid ʿAlī.806 A child named Aḥmad was born in
1295/1843, but died in infancy or, according to one source, was stillborn.807

It was several months after this that the Bab had what appears to have
been the first of a number of dreams or visions which convinced him that he had
been chosen as the bearer of divine knowledge to succeed Rashti, and as the gate
to the Hidden Imām. In a passage at the beginning of his tafsīr on the Sūrat al­
baqara, he states that, on the night before he began the book (his first major
work), he dreamt that the city of Karbala (al­arḍ al­muqaddaṣa) rose piecemeal
(dharratan dharratan) into the air and came to his house (in Shīrāz) to stand
before him, whereupon he was informed of the imminent death of Rashti.808 The
implication is that the Bab had what he regarded as a significant dream not long
before the death of the Sayyid in Dhū ’l­Ḥijja 1259/January 1844, possibly in

the month of Dhū ’l­Qaʿda /November­December 1843, as suggested by
Māzandarānī.809 According to a majority of manuscripts consulted by me, this
tafsīr was completed up to the first juzʾ of the Qurʾan (verse 131 of the sura) in
Muḥarram 1260/January­February 1844.810 The second half of the tafsīr was
completed in the course of 1260/1844 and was among the works in the Bab’s
possession when he performed the ḥajj in the latter part of that year; it was,
however, stolen from him, together with a number of other volumes, between
Medina and Jidda.811

The extant text of the first half of the Tafsīr Sūrat al­baqara reveals very
little which might be taken as seriously heterodox, in contrast to the highly
unconventional Qayyūm al­asmā, begun only a few months afterwards. The
abrupt and significant change in style and content between these two works
seems to be attributable to a second, more compelling visionary experience
which the Bab underwent about one month before the announcement of his
claim to Mullā Muḥammad Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī in May 1844. In his Kitāb al­
fihrist, written in Bushehr on his return from pilgrimage on 15 Jumādī II
1261/21 June 1845,812 the Bab clearly states that “the first day on which the
spirit descended into his heart was the middle [i.e., the 15th] of the month of
Rabiʿ II.”813 Since it is added that fifteen months had passed since that
experience, we can give the date as 15 Rabiʿ II 1260/4 May 1844. It would seem
that this “descent of the spirit” was accompanied by a vision similar in many
respects to initiatory dreams described by al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti, as we have seen
earlier; his own dream is described by the Bab in his Ṣaḥīfa­yi ʿAdliyya as
follows:

> Know that the appearance of these verses, prayers, and divine
> sciences is the result of a dream in which I saw the blessed head of
> the prince of martyrs [Imām Ḥusayn] severed from his sacred body,
> alongside the heads of his kindred. I drank seven drops of the blood
> of that martyred one, out of pure and consummate love. From the
> grace vouchsafed by the blood of the Imām, my breast was filled
> with convincing verses and mighty prayers. Praise be unto God for
> having given me to drink of the blood of him who is His Proof, and
> made thereof the reality of my heart.814

Just as al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti had felt themselves confirmed in their roles
as, in some sense, mediators of the knowledge of the Prophet and Imāms
following dreams, so the Bab now clearly began to regard himself as the
recipient of the divine afflatus, verbally inspired by the grace of the Imām and
filled with the Holy Spirit. However, whereas his two predecessors had been
members of the ulama class and were able to adapt their visionary experiences
to their role within the accepted patterns of religious behavior inside the
“ecclesiastical” hierarchy (within whose confines the takfīr controversy

remained), the Bab was to take the step characteristic of uneducated or partially­
educated individuals who believe themselves to be granted supernatural
revelations but have no recognized position within the formal religious structure
of their society—the creation of a role for himself outside the established
ecclesia, corresponding to an approved charismatic or messianic figure revered
in popular belief or expectation.

The Bab continued to experience dreams or visions until at least Ramaḍān
1260/September­October 1844,815and possibly much later, but their significance
dwindled somewhat as he came to believe himself to be in a state of perpetual
grace and a recipient of direct verbal inspiration from the twelfth Imām or, in
due course, God himself.

It seems possible that, even before the death of Rashti, Shīrāzī (the Bab)
had begun to view himself as his future successor and as the “bearer of the
cause” he predicted. Kirmānī maintains that, during the lifetime of Rashti, the
Bab had been held in some respect, but was even then influenced by certain
ideas and events which ultimately led to his later claims.816 He holds that the
Bab had heard of the appearance of a certain Mullā Ṣādiq in Azerbaijan, who
had acquired a following of some one thousand two hundred during Rashti’s
lifetime, and that he was impressed by him.817 The Mullā Ṣādiq named here
would, in fact, appear to have been Mullā Ṣādiq Urdūbādī, who preached the
imminent advent of the Qā’im in the Caucasus in the period before 1844,818 but
there is no evidence in the Bab’s own writings that he had either heard of or
been influenced, however indirectly, by him.

In a letter written in late 1260 or 1261, Shīrāzī indicates that “following
the death of the late Sayyid, there must be such a leader (sayyid) among his
followers in every age,” and makes it clear that he was the individual to whom
the Shaykhis were meant to turn.819 It seems that he received at least two letters
from Rashti, the contents of which he interpreted as an indication of his future
position.820 Āvāra states that he saw a letter in the Bab’s hand, dated 1259, in
which he instructs his uncle to “tell the ṭullāb that the cause was not yet reached
maturity and the time has not yet come,”821 which strongly suggests that he was
attracting attention as a potential leader at this point. The proximity of the year
1260, exactly one thousand lunar years after the entry of the twelfth Imām into
the Lesser Occultation (al­ghayba al­ṣughrā), cannot have failed to further
encourage his belief in the nearness of a new revelation of inner truth, not,
perhaps, unrelated to this eventual return of the Imām.

In a letter written from prison in Azerbaijan to his uncle Ḥājī Mīrzā
Sayyid ʿAlī, Shīrāzī indicates his belief that the year 1260 witnessed the
beginning of a period of revealed bāṭin, following several centuries of ẓāhir:

> From the time of the revelation of the Qurʾan for a period of
> nineteen times sixty­six years [1254], which is the number of Allāh

[i.e., sixty­six in abjad reckoning], was the outward reality (ẓāhir)
> of the family of Muḥammad, during which every sixty­six years
> one letter of the words bism Allāh al­raḥmān al­raḥīm passed by,
> while four more years additional to the form of all the letters passed
> in the time of the perfect Shiʿi, that is Ḥājj Sayyid Kāẓim… It was
> for this reason that the letters of bism Allāh al­raḥmān al­raḥīm,
> which contain all the Qurʾan, were gathered together in his
> presence. Nineteen days before the beginning of the revelation of
> the mystery, he joined the supreme concourse; the beginning of the
> year 1260 was the beginning of the revelation of the mystery.822

The stage was clearly set for the arrival of Mullā Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī and other
Shaykhis from Karbala from about April to June 1844.

The ḥurūf al­ḥayy or sābiqūn

We have observed in the first part of this chapter that, for a period of some four
months after the death of Rashti, the Shaykhi community of Karbala found itself
unable to initiate any positive action to determine the mode of succession to its
late head. Then, as al­Karbalāʾī states, a break with Mīrzā Muḥīṭ Kirmānī and
Mullā Ḥasan Gawhar occurred, and some people began to disperse. This
dispersal may well have been initiated—and was certainly led—by a young
Iranian Shaykhi ʿālim of about thirty­one, Mullā Muḥammad Ḥusayn
Bushrūʾī.823 Born the son of a local merchant in Bushrūya, Khurāsān, in
1229/1814, Bushrūʾī was sent at an early age to Mashhad, where he studied in
the Mīrzā Jaʿfar madrasa.824 His principal teacher in Mashhad was Sayyid
Muḥammad Qaṣīr Raḍawī Mashhadī (d. 1255/1839),825 a pupil of Āqā
Bihbahānī and the teacher of another leading early Babi, Mullā Muḥammad
Ṣādiq Khurāsānī.826 Bushrūʾī appears to have become a Shaykhi in Mashhad827
and to have studied afterwards in Tehran828 and Isfahan829 before traveling to the
ʿatabāt to study under Rashti.830 In Karbala, where he stayed for nine or eleven
years,831 he gained a reputation as one of the leading pupils of the Sayyid, who
entrusted him with the task of answering questions on his behalf.832 He wrote at
least two books during this period, including a tafsīr on the Sūrat al­kawthar,
and seems to have acquired a private following of ṭullāb and admirers, among
them Mullā Muḥammad Taqī Haravī, Mullā ʿAbd al­Khāliq Yazdī, and Mīrzā
Aḥmad Azghandī.833 There appears to have grown up a conviction among some
that Bushrūʾī would be the successor of Rashti (al­qā’im bi ’l­amr baʿdahu), a
belief which was made public on the latter’s death but rejected by Bushrūʾī
himself.834

As noted previously, about four years before the death of Rashti, Bushrūʾī
was sent on his behalf to Isfahan and Mashhad to discuss the Shaykhi position
with Mullā Muḥammad Bāqir Shaftī and Hājī Mīrzā ʿAskar (then Imām­Jumʿa

of Mashhad).835 Following his visit to Mashhad, he seems to have returned to
Bushrūya for a time; on his way back to the ‘atabāt, he heard of Rashti’s death
while in Kirmanshah,836 arriving back in Karbala soon after, on 1 Muḥarram
1260/22 January 1844.837 On his return, Mullā Ḥusayn, as we have noted above,
discussed the situation with Mullā Ḥasan Gawhar, Mīrzā Muḥīṭ Kirmānī, and
other leading Shaykhis, but appears to have been dissatisfied with their wait­
and­see policy.

On or about 2 Ṣafar/22 February, he retired with his brother, Mīrzā
Muḥammad­Ḥasan Bushrūʾī (d. 1849), and nephew, Mīrzā Muḥammad­Bāqir
(d. 1849) to the Masjid al­Kūfa, in order to engage in a retreat (iʿtikāf) for the
conventional forty­day period (arbaʿīn).838 While there, he was joined by Mullā
ʿAlī Basṭāmī (d. 1846) and some six or twelve companions, who began an iʿtikāf
some days behind the first arrivals.839

Zarandī limits the number participating in the iʿtikāf to those who were
later to become the Bab’s first disciples, the ḥurūf al­ḥayy or precursors
(sābiqūn),840 thereby giving the misleading impression that a simple division
occurred between those who set out in search of a successor to Rashti—and, by
virtue of that act alone, “discovered” the Bab—and those who were prepared to
await developments in Karbala. It seems, however, that larger numbers were
involved: Mīrzā Ḥusayn Hamadānī (d. 1881), the author of the Tārikh­i jadīd,
relates that he was present at the iʿtikāf in the mosque in Kufa (presumably a
fiction of convenience on his part) and that he saw there, apart from several of
those who later became ḥurūf al­ḥayy, a Mīrzā ʿAbd al­Hādī, a Mullā Bashīr,
and “many other learned and devout men who had retired into seclusion.”841
Māzandarānī mentions Ḥājī Sayyid Khalīl al­Madāʾinī, a tribal leader who had
studied under Rashti, as also present at the iʿtikāf.842 The Hasht bihisht
maintains that no fewer than forty individuals were involved.843

After the celebration of the birth of the Prophet on 12 Rabiʿ I/1 April,
Bushrūʾī left Kufa with his brother and cousin and, possibly, several others,
heading for Kirman with the intention of meeting and consulting with Karīm
Khān. According to Shaykh Muḥammad Taqī Hashtrūdī’s Abwāb al­hudā, he
was accompanied on his journey by Mullā Yūsuf Ardabīlī (d. 1849), Mullā Jalīl
Khūʾī (Urūmī) (d. 1849), Mullā ʿAlī Bushrūʾī, Mīrzā Aḥmad Azghandī, Shaykh
Abū Turāb Ashtahārdī, and others.844 The same source states that Bushrūʾī
himself had told the author that, having despaired of Mullā Ḥasan Gawhar, had
decided to visit Kirmānī.845 Aḥmad ibn Abī ’l­Ḥasan Sharīf Shīrāzī records a
similar statement by a companion of Bushrūʾī.846 Aḥmad Rūhī holds that
Kirmānī was already “inviting people” to join him, and that Bushrūʾī and his
companions sought him out as the possible bāb of the Imām.847 The route taken
by Bushrūʾī and his fellow­travelers passed, however, through Bushehr and
Shīrāz, where it would seem that they sought out Sayyid ʿAlī Muḥammad.
According to one account, Bushrūʾī told Mīrzā ʿAbd al­Wahhāb Khurāsānī that
“since the Seyyid ʿAlī Muḥammad had honoured me with his friendship during

a journey which we made together to the Holy Shrines… I at once on reaching
Shīrāz sought out his abode.”848 Other sources are agreed that Bushrūʾī had at
least seen the Sayyid during the latter’s stay in Karbala in 1841, probably shortly
before his departure for Isfahan,849 while Āvāra maintains that he had formed a
particular affection for the Bab at that period.850

According to Zarandī, Bushrūʾī arrived in Shīrāz on 4 Jumādā I/22 May,
was met by the Bab on his arrival, and acquainted that evening with the latter’s
claims.851 Almost two months, however, seems unnecessarily long for the
journey from Karbala to Shīrāz, and we may presume that Bushrūʾī actually
arrived some weeks before this. That such was the case seems to be confirmed
by Hamadānī, who describes a process of gradual conversion over several
meetings culminating in his reading of the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ.852 Mīrzā Yaḥyā
Ṣubḥ­i Azal indicated to E. G. Brown that it was the perusal of the Qayyūm al­
asmāʾ which had initially convinced Bushrūʾī of the truth of the Bab’s claims.853
During this period, Bushrūʾī also read part at least of the Bab’s incomplete
Tafsīr Sūrat al­baqara854 and his short commentary on the Ḥadīth al­jāriyya.855
Mullā Jaʿfar Qazvīnī states, on the authority of Mullā Jalīl Urūmī, himself one
of the ḥurūf, that the Bab showed various writings to Bushrūʾī while the latter
was teaching in the Vakīl mosque; he says that Bushrūʾī would go with his
companions every day to visit the Bab and that, after forty days, the latter openly
revealed his claims to them.856 Whatever the details of this preliminary period,
the Bab did, in the end, announce to Bushrūʾī that he was the successor to Rashti
and, indeed the bāb al­Imām; Bushrūʾī accepted his claims, by reason of which
he came to be known as “the first to believe” (awwal man āmana), the “gate of
the gate” (bāb al­bāb), and even the “return of Muḥammad”.857 The date of this
“declaration” is given by the Bab himself with great precision in the Bayān­i
fārsī as the evening of 5 Jumādā I/22 May, at two hours and eleven minutes after
sunset.858

Some three weeks before that, on 15 Rabīʿ II/4 May, another group of
Shaykhis set off from Karbala for Shīrāz, apparently traveling some of the way
by sea, presumably following Bushrūʾī’s route via Bushehr.859 This group
consisted of seven individuals “to the number of the days of the week”, namely
Mullā ʿAlī Basṭāmī, Mullā Jalīl Urūmī, Mīrzā Muḥammad­ʿAlī Qazvīnī (a
brother­in­law of Qurrat al­ʿAyn), Mullā Ḥasan­i­Bajastānī, Mullā Aḥmad
“Ibdāl” Marāghaʾī, Mullā Mahmūd Khūʾī, and Mullā Muḥammad Miyāmī.860

Zarandī, however, in writing of what must be the same group, omits the
last name and adds another seven, bringing the total to thirteen.861 Arriving at
the latest some forty days after the Bab’s “declaration”,862 this group of thirteen
met the Bab individually and accepted his claims, most probably with the
encouragement of Bushrūʾī and his brother and nephew, who had also joined the
rank’s of the Bab’s disciples.863 Included in this group were Mullā ʿAlī Qazvīnī
and his brother Mīrzā Hādī; the former was, as we have noted, a brother­in­law

of Fāṭima Khānum Baraghānī, better known as by the titles Qurrat al­ʿAyn
(given her by Rashti) and Jināb­i Tāhira (given her by the Bab).864

This remarkable woman—a latter­day Juana Inés de la Cruz865—had
already won a reputation as an outstanding and radical Shaykhi ʿālima, and was
to become a center of much controversy following her acceptance of Babism.
Although then in Qazvīn,866 she was enrolled by the Bab in his group of ḥurūf
al­hayy, apparently on the recommendation of Mullā Muḥammad ʿAlī.867 It
would appear that the latter then corresponded with her concerning the Bab and
that, on receipt of his information, she, for her part, accepted his claims: “At the
beginning of the cause of this mighty one, I was in Qazvīn and, as soon as I
heard of his cause, before reading the blessed tafsīr [on the Sura Yūsuf, i.e., the
Qayyūm al­asmāʾ] or the Ṣaḥīfa makhzūna, I believed in him.”868 We shall
discuss the subsequent activities of Qurrat al­ʿAyn in a later chapter.

The last member of the group of eighteen individuals known as the ḥurūf
al­ḥayy was a young Shaykhi ṭālib from Mazandaran who had, it seems, also
been engaged in iʿtikāf at the mosque in Kufa, but had traveled independently to
Shīrāz.869 Mullā Muḥammad ʿAlī Bārfurūshī, latter known as Ḥaḍrat­i Quddūs,
became a close favorite of the Bab, whom he accompanied on the ḥajj in the
autumn of 1844, and eventually led the Babi uprising in his native province in
1848\.870

With the arrival of Bārfurūshī in Shīrāz and his acceptance of the Bab’s
claims, the latter considered the group of his first apostles to be complete.871 The
eighteen ḥurūf al­ḥayy (in abjad reckoning, ḥayy = 18)872 appear to have
constituted with the Bab himself the first “unity” (wāḥid = 19) of a series of
nineteen unities which would make up a body of three hundred and sixty one
individuals—a kullu shayʾ (= 361)—the first believers in the bāb of the Imām.873
The ḥurūf al­ḥayy are themselves regarded as identical with the sābiqūn referred
to in early works of the Bab and his followers,874 both in the literal sense of their
having preceded others in the recognition of the Bab and in the more esoteric
sense of their identity with the first group of mankind to respond to God’s pre­
eternal covenant.875 This latter group is itself identified in Shiʿi literature with
Muḥammad and the Imāms,876 and it is clear that the Bab regarded the ḥurūf al­
ḥayy as the return of the Prophet, the twelve Imāms, the four original abwāb,
and Fāṭima.877 As we shall see, both the exclusive position granted the ḥurūf al­
hayy and their identification with the most sacred figures of Shiʿism were to be
productive of serious controversy in the early Babi community of Karbala.

CHAPTER FIVE: SOME ASPECTS OF EARLY BĀBI DOCTRINE

The Early Writings of the Bab

The ḥurūf al­ḥayy were primarily responsible for spreading the claims of the
Bab to their fellow­Shaykhis and, to a lesser extent, other Shiʿis, and we shall
have cause to consider their activities in this connection at a later stage. In thus
furthering the Bab’s claims, they placed considerable emphasis on the writings
which he was now beginning to pen in large numbers.878

Of these early writings, by far the most important and influential was the
Qayyūm al­asmāʾ or Aḥsan al­qaṣaṣ, a lengthy “commentary” on the Sura Yūsuf
(and often referred to in early Babi literature simply as “the tafsīr”).879 There
are, unfortunately, serious problems connected with the dating of this work,
which appear at present to be insoluble.

According to Zarandī (1831­1892), the first chapter of the tafsīr, entitled
“Sūrat al­mulk,” was written in the presence of Bushrūʾī on the evening of the
Bab’s “declaration”, although his account gives a curious impression of an
extremely long chapter, which the “Sūrat al­mulk” is not.880 Mīrzā Ḥusayn
Hamadānī, however, implies that Bushrūʾī was shown a complete copy of the
tafsīr, possibly on the same occasion.881

The Bab himself states in a letter that he completed the writing of the
Qayyūm al­asmāʾ in forty days, although he does not make it clear when he
began or ended work on it.882 It is generally reckoned that, on leaving Shīrāz
before the autumn of 1844, both Mullā ʿAlī Basṭāmī and Mullā Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī
(d. 1849) carried with them separate copies of this book, which they brought to
Iraq and Tehran respectively.883 That this tafsīr was widely distributed in the
first year of the Bab’s career is further confirmed by him in the Bayān­i Fārsī,
where, in reference to his ḥajj journey in 1844­5, he states that “in that year the
blessed commentary on the Sūra Yūsuf reached everyone.”884 It is certainly clear
that the book must have been begun in 1260/1844, since the Bab states in an
early passage that he is now twenty­five years old.885

Internal evidence, however, suggests that the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ was, in
fact, completed much later than the forty­day period mentioned. There are, for
example, two references to “this month of Ramadan”886—most probably
Ramadan 1260/August­September 1844. Other references include those to a
storm at sea,887 quite possibly one of those suffered by the Bab on his journey
from Bushehr to Jidda between 19 Ramaḍān/2 October and late Dhū ’l­
Qaʿda/early December;888 to what appears to be his first public declaration of his
claims at the Kaaba in Mecca;889 to God’s having revealed matters to him in the
Kaaba;890 to his call “from this protected land, the station of Abraham,”
apparently Mecca;891 to his having been “raised up” in the Masjid al­Ḥarām (in

Mecca);892 and, finally, to what seems to have been yet another experience in
Mecca, in which he says

> when I went to the Kaaba (al­bayt), I found the house (al­sakīna)
> raised on square supports before the bāb; and, when I sought to
> perform the circumambulation around the Kaaba, I found that the
> duty imposed in truth in the Mother of the Book was seven times.893

These references, all of which occur in the later section of the book, make
it clear that it was completed during the Bab’s pilgrimage to Mecca, from which
he returned to Bushehr on 8 Jumādī I 1261/15 May 1845.894 Bushrūʾī, Basṭāmī
and others of the ḥurūf al­ḥayy must have carried only portions of the tafsīr with
them when they left Shīrāz. It is also not unlikely that, if this hypothesis as to a
later date of completion is correct, the Bab’s reference to “forty days” should be
taken to mean forty days in all, over a prolonged period, rather than forty
consecutive days.

Consisting of one hundred and eleven “suras”, corresponding to the
number of āyāt in the Sūra Yūsuf, the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ895 is really much more
than a tafsīr in the normal sense of the word. Much more space is taken up with
doctrinal reflections of the Bab than with actual Qurʾanic commentary, and,
when a verse is finally commented on, it is usually in an abstruse and allegorical
fashion. The style is consciously modeled on that of the Qurʾan—something true
of many of the Bab’s earlier writings—this being alluded to in a statement quite
early in the book: “We have sent this book down upon our servant by the
permission of God, [in a manner] like it [the Qurʾan],”896 and in later
passages.897

This apparent similarity to the style of the Qurʾan (which is not, in fact, as
consistent as it might at first appear), combined with the form of the book as
divided into suwar and āyāt, and the occurrences of numerous passages closely
paralleling the exact wording of the Qurʾan,898 led to accusations that the Bab
had produced a ‘”falsified” Qurʾan or “forged” his own Qurʾan. Thus, for
example, Tanakābunī states that, in the year of his appearance, the Bab sent his
false Qurʾan (Qurʾān­i jaʿlī) to Iraq, and that this æQurʾanæ was taken from his
messenger by the pasha of Baghdad (Najīb Pāshā).899 Similarly, Major Henry
Rawlinson (1810­1895), the British political agent in Baghdad at the time of
Mullā ʿAlī Basṭāmī’s arrest and trial, wrote to Stratford Canning that Mullā ʿAlī

> Appeared in Kerbela, bearing a copy of the Koran, which he stated
> to have been delivered to him, by the forerunner of the Imām
> Mahdī, to be exhibited in token of his approaching advent. The
> book proved on examination to have been altered and interpolated
> in many essential passages, the object being, to prepare the

and to identify the individual to whom the emendations of the text
> were declared to have been revealed, as his inspired and true
> precursor.900

Rawlinson elsewhere speaks of Basṭāmī’s “perverted copy of the Koran.”901

The text of the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ itself, however, indicates that this was a
most superficial response and that the theory behind the tafsīr was much more
complex than mere imitation of the Qurʾan. At the very beginning of the book, it
is made clear that the twelfth Imām had sent it (akhraja) to his servant (the Bab,
frequently referred to as “the remembrance” – ah­dhikr);902 he has been sent
these “explanations” from “the baqiyyat Allāh, the exalted one, your Imām.”903
To be more precise, “God has sent down (anzala) the verses upon His Proof, the
expected one,” who has, in his turn, revealed them to his remembrance.904 In
different terminology, the Imām inspires (awḥā) the Bab with what God has
inspired him.905

The role of the Imām here appears to be very similar to that of the angel
Gabriel in the Qurʾanic theory of revelation; thus, for example, he has inspired
the Bab just as God inspired the prophets of the past.906 The process is not,
however, quite that simple, for the bulk of the work seems to be intended as the
words of the Imām speaking in the first person, while there are a great many
passages in which either God or the Bab is intended as the speaker, and others in
which it is not at all clear who is intended. It is, nevertheless, manifest that the
book is represented as a new divine revelation of sorts, comparable to the
Qurʾan. Thus the Imām is “made known” through “the new verses from God,”907
while God speaks “in the tongue of this mighty remembrance [i.e., the Bab].”908
It is stated that “this is a book from God,”909 and that “God has sent down
(anzala) this book,”910 while the Bab is summoned to “transmit what has been
sent down to you from the bounty of the Merciful.”911 In this respect a
comparison is drawn with the Qurʾan which goes beyond mere form: God has
“made this book the essence (sirr) of the Qurʾan, word for word,”912 and one
“will not find a letter in it other than the letters of the Qurʾan”;913 this book “is
the Furqān of the past,”914 and is referred to repeatedly as “this Qurʾan,”915 “this
Furqān,”916 or one of “these two Furqāns,”917 while reference is made to “what
God has sent down in His book, the Furqān, and in this book.”918 As in the case
of the Qurʾan, a challenge is made to men to produce a book like it,919 for it is
held to be inimitable.920 As such, it is in itself the evidence of the Imām to
men.921 It contains the sum of all previous scriptures,922 abrogates all books of
the past, except those revealed by God,923 and is the only work which God
permits the ulama to teach.924

The Qayyūm al­asmāʾ may be said to combine something of the character
of the letters (ṭawqīʿāt) “written” by the Hidden Imām through his
intermediaries, the four abwāb, of the various books reputed to be in the

possession of the Imāms – the muṣḥaf of Fatima, al­Ṣaḥīfa, al­Jāmiʿa, al­Jabr,
the “complete Qurʾan”, and the previous scriptures925—and of the Qurʾan itself.

The tension between the Bab’s specific claims at this period (to be the
gate of the Hidden Imām, the remembrance of God and the Imām, and the “seal
of the gates” [khātim al­abwāb]—a topic with which we shall deal in the next
section) and what appears to be a clear impulse in the direction of a claim to
prophethood, if not actual divinity (which characterizes the Bab’s works from
1848 onwards), forms one of the more interesting features of this book. It is, in
any case, one of the lengthiest of works of the Bab and, leaving aside the
extremely diffuse Kitāb al­asmāʾ, the most extensive of his Arabic writings.
While hardly the easiest of books to understand, being terse, allusive, and at
times extremely vague in style, it does provide us with a reasonably detailed
picture of the Bab’s thought as it must have impressed itself on his earliest
disciples and opponents.

Since there is clearly no space here to adequately summarize the contents
of a work of some four hundred pages, much of which is given over to the
unsystematic treatment of metaphysical themes, reference to certain of the more
interesting topics it contained must suffice.

A theme which recurs throughout the book is that it is an expression of
the “true Islam” and that, indeed, salvation exists only in acceptance of the
claims of the Bab, as the representative of the Imām and of God. Thus, at the
very beginning of the book, it is stated that “the pure religion (al­dīn al­khāliṣ)
is this remembrance, secure; whoever desires submission (al­islām), let him
submit himself to his cause.”926 Similarly, it is said that “this religion is, before
God, the essence (sirr) of the religion of Muḥammad,”927 and that whoever
disbelieves in the Bab shall have disbelieved in Muḥammad and his book.928 The
Hidden Imām declares in one passage that “there is no path to me in this day
except through this exalted gate,”929 and it is maintained that “God has
completed His proof (atamma ḥujjatahu) unto [men] with this book.”930 The
gate and representative of the Imām, the Bab was also, in a sense, the Imām
himself “in the worlds of command and creation (ʿawālim al­amr wa ’l­
khalq),”931 and, as such, was entrusted with a mission on behalf of the Imām to
all mankind.932

He himself constantly addresses the “peoples of the earth,”933 or of “the
East and West,”934 and calls on his followers to “spread the cause to all
lands.”935 Towards the beginning of the tafsīr, he summons “the concourse of
kings” to take his verses to the Turks and Indians and to lands beyond the East
and West.936 God Himself had assured him of sovereignty over all lands and the
peoples in them,937 had written down for him “the dominion of the earth,”938 and
already ruled the world through him.939 The Bab, clearly, did not conceive of his
message as limited to Iran, or to the Shiʿi or even the Islamic world, but
envisioned a universal role for himself complementary to that of Muḥammad
and the Imāms. Since the laws of Muḥammad and the decrees of the Imāms

were to remain binding “until the day of resurrection,”940 there was no question
but that the primary means of bringing men to the true faith was to be jihād.941

Messianic expectation and exhortation to jihad were clearly linked for the
Bab in the role of the Imām as the victorious mujahid of the last days: “the
victory (naṣr) of God and His days are, in the Mother of the Book, near at
hand.”942 On the one hand, it is clear that aiding God (naṣr—a term widely used
in the Qurʾan to mean fighting in the path of God) was seen by the Bab as a
means of anticipating the Day of Judgment and of helping to hasten its advent.
He speaks of “the man who has submitted himself (aslama wajhahu) to God,
and who aids our cause and anticipates the dominion (dawla) of God, the
Almighty, as drawing near.”943 Elsewhere, he calls on “the peoples of the East
and West” to “issue forth from your lands in order to come to the assistance of
God (li­naṣr Allāh) through the truth for, truly, God’s victory (fatḥ Allāh) is, in
the Mother of the Book, near at hand.”944 More explicitly, the Bab links the
waging of holy war with the necessary preparations for the advent of the Qā’im:
“O armies of God!”, he writes, “when you wage war with the infidels (al­
mushrikīn), do not fear their numbers…. Slay those who have joined partners
with God, and leave not a single one of the unbelievers (al­kafirīn) alive upon
the earth, so that the earth and all that are on it may be purified for the Remnant
of God (baqiyyat Allāh), the expected one [i.e., the twelfth Imām in his persona
as the Mahdī].”945

On the other hand, the Bab anticipated jihad as one of the events
prophesied in the traditions relating to the appearance of the Qā’im.946In a
relatively early passage of the Qayyūm al­aṣmāʾ, the Imāms (ahl al­bayt)
prophesy that they will wage war on behalf of the Bab: “We shall, God willing,
descend on the day of remembrance, upon crimson thrones, and shall slay you,
by the permission of God, with our swords, in truth—just as you have
disbelieved and turned aside from our mighty word [i.e., the Bab].”947 The
Qayyūm al­asmāʾ itself was “revealed”, it states, “in order that men might
believe and assist him [the Bab] on the day of slaughter (yawm al­qitāl).”948 The
Bab himself was, it seems, awaiting permission from the Imām to “rise up in the
cause” when the time came949—a possible allusion to his projected visits to Kufa
and Karbala, to which we shall refer later.

Regulations concerning the conduct of jihad are set out in some detail in
the Qayyūm al­asmāJ, principally in sūras 96 to 101.950 For the most part, these
consist—like a great many passages of the book (notably those devoted to
legislation)—of verbatim or near­verbatim reproductions of existing Qurʾanic
passages, or echoes of such passages, with only occasional novel features
introduced by the Bab himself. Apart from these regulations for jihad, which are
of particular interest for the light they shed on early Babi history and on the
question of militancy in the movement, the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ contains passages
detailing the basic Islamic laws concerning ṣalāt,951 ḥajj,952 ṣawm,953 zakāt,954
marriage and divorce,955 manslaughter,956 foodstuffs,957 ablutions,958

inheritance,959 usury and trade,960 adultery,961 theft,962 nawāfil,963 the lex
talionis,964 idols, wine, and gambling,965 and smoking (which is prohibited).966
There is no room here to enter into a discussion of the relationship of the Bab’s
legal pronouncements here or elsewhere (as in his Risāla furūʿ al­ʿAdliyya) and
the Islamic law as it appears in standard works of Shiʿi fiqh; the most important
point to note is the contrast between this early insistence on the observance of
Islamic law with the later abrogation of the sharīʿa and its replacement by the
highly idiosyncratic system of legislation embodied in the Arabic and Persian
Bayāns.

Aside from the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ and the second part of the Tafsīr Sūrat
al­baqara, the Bab penned several shorter works during the year or so between
his first claims and his return to Būshehr from the ḥajj in May 1845. There has
been some confusion as to the identity of the earliest works of the Bab,967 but,
fortunately, he himself has listed most or all of them in two works, the first
entitled Kitāb al­fihrist, clearly dated 15 Jumādā II 1261/21 June 1845, and
certainly written in Būshehr, and the second probably entitled Risāla­yi
dhahabiyya, 968 which records fourteen works written “from the beginning of the
year 1260 to the middle of the first month of the year 1262”969 (i.e., from 1
Muharram 1260/22 January 1844 to 15 Muharram 1262/13 January 1846). The
first of these works, although earlier in date, in fact contains a larger number of
individual titles than the second. It also has the advantage of giving the actual
names of the works cited, whereas the Risāla­yi dhahabiyya gives oblique
references which require elucidation on the basis of information gleaned
elsewhere.970 We shall restrict ourselves here, therefore, to the list of works
given in the Kitāb al­fihrist.971

Apart from the works already mentioned, the Kitāb al­fihrist refers to the
Duʿā­yi ṣaḥīfa, al­Ṣaḥīfa aʿmāl al­sana, al­Ṣaḥīfa bayna ’l­ḥaramayn, Tafsīr al­
basmala, Kitāb al­rūḥ, thirty­eight letters to individuals, twelve khuṭub delivered
or written on the ḥajj journey, and replies to forty­one questions. In addition to
the above, the Bab lists here the titles of several works stolen from him by a
Bedouin while on pilgrimage. According to his own statement, in a khuṭba
written in Jidda, this occurred on 11 Ṣafar 1261/19February 1845, between
Medina and Jidda.972

It is not certain at what date the Duʿā­yi ṣaḥīfa was written, but its
inclusion in the Kitāb al­fihrist immediately after the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ suggests
that it might have been contemporary with it. This seems to be confirmed by a
statement in the latter work that “we have sent down unto you with this book
that written ṣaḥīfa, that the people may read his prayers (daʿwātahu) by day and
by night,”973 which is almost certainly a reference to this work. Māzandarānī
refers to it by the title Al­ṣaḥīfa al­makhzūna,974 and a comparison of texts under
these two titles confirms that they are indeed the same work. This important
early piece is a collection of fourteen prayers, largely designed for use on
specific days or festivals, such as the ʿĪd al­Fiṭr, ʿĪd al­Aḍḥā, the night of

ʿĀshūrā, and even the night of Bab’s “declaration” on 5 Jumādā I. Mullā ʿAlī
Basṭāmī carried a copy of this work with him to the ʿatabāt in the autumn of
1844, and it appears to have been copied and distributed there.975 Similarly when
Bushrūʾī left Shīrāz shortly after Basṭāmī, but in the direction of Tehran, he also
carried a copy of the Ṣaḥīfa makhzūna, together with the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ and
some other short works.976 At least seven manuscripts of this work are still in
existence.977

It seems that at least three major works of the Bab were written in the
course of his nine­month ḥajj journey. Of these, the most important is
undoubtedly the Ṣaḥīfa bayna ’l­ḥaramayn. This treatise was written, as the title
indicates, between Mecca and Medina, for Mīrzā Muḥīṭ Kirmānī and Sayyid
ʿAlī Kirmānī (who were also on the ḥajj that year), 978 on and possibly after 1
Muḥarram 1261/10 January 1845.979 This work of about one hundred short
pages is an unsystematic collection of replies to questions together with prayers.
Among the topics dealt with are: the Bab’s mubāhala challenge to Mīrzā
Muhīt;980 the use of talismans;981 the seven causes of creation;982 the courses of
the celestial bodies;983 and right conduct (sulūk).984 There are prayers to be said
at sunset,985 after the noon and dawn ṣalāts,986 on the evening of Friday,987 and at
the beginning of every month,988 as well as instructions for pilgrims to the
Shrine of Ḥusayn.989

Of particular interest is a lengthy passage in which the Bab sets out a
somewhat strenuous daily routine for the seeker (sālik), with directions as to
prayer, nawāfil, fasting (which includes an additional fast of ten days each
month to the age of thirty, of fifteen days from thirty to forty, of three days from
forty to fifty, and of Ramadan only from fifty), the taking of gum mastic, water,
and milk, study (including that of fiqh), sleep and prayers during the night.990
Several manuscripts of this work are known to exist, the earliest of which are
one in the Bahaʾi archives in Haifa, date 1261/1845, and another in their Tehran
archives, dated the same year.

The fate of the Kitāb al­rūḥ, composed at sea on the Bab’s return
journey,991 was less fortunate. According to Nicolas, this book, which the Bab
himself thought highly of, describing it as “the greatest of all books,”992 and
which he wished to have sent to all the ulama,993 was seized at the time of his
arrest and thrown into a well in Shīrāz.994 Nicolas claims that it was rescued by
“pious hands,” albeit in a seriously damaged condition.995 As a result, several
partial copies are in existence today, a total of five manuscripts of differing
degrees of completeness being known to the present author. This work would
also appear to be known as the Kitāb al­ʿadl,996 and is recorded as having
originally consisted of seven hundred suras.

A third work, of some interest for its doctrinal implications, also appears
to have been composed during this journey. According to Zarandī, when the Bab
returned to Būshehr in 1845, he sent Mullā Muḥammad­ʿAlī Bārfurūshī (who
had accompanied him to Mecca) ahead of him to Shīrāz.997 Bārfurūshī was

entrusted with a letter to the Bab’s uncle, Ḥājī Mīrzā Sayyid ʿAlī,998 and a copy
of a work entitled the Khaṣāʾil­i sabʿa: “a treatise in which He had set forth the
essential requirements from those who had attained to the knowledge of the new
Revelation and had recognized its claims.”999 This work was given to Mullā
Ṣādiq Khurāsānī by Bārfurūshī when the latter reached Shīrāz, and it was in
accordance with one of the precepts contained in it that Mullā Ṣādiq made use of
an altered form of the adhān in the Masjid­i Shamshīrgarān in Shīrāz.1000 A riot
ensued, as a result of which Bārfurūshī, Khurāsānī, and a third Babi named
Mullā ʿAlī­Akbar Ardastānī were physically punished and expelled from the
city, not long before the Bab’s arrival there—the first example of opposition to
the Babis in Iran (though hardly the conscious attack on Babism which later
partisan sources make it out to be).1001

Although I have never been able to trace a copy of this work, there seems
to be at least one manuscript in existence, since both Ishrāq Khāvarī, and
Muḥammad ʿAlī Fayḍī refer to its contents. Since they are of considerable
interest, I shall list the seven regulations given in this work as cited by these two
writers:1002

1. To read the Ziyāra al­jāmiʿa al­kubrā on Fridays, festivals, and holy

> nights, after the performance of ablutions and purification of body and
> clothes with great care, in a spirit of sanctity.
2. To perform the prostration of the ṣalāt on the grave of Imām Ḥusayn,

in such a way that the nose of the worshipper touches the grave.
3. To add the formula ashhadu anna ʿAlīyan qablu Muḥammad ʿabdu

> baqiyyati ’llāh (“I bear witness that ʿAlī Muḥammad [i.e. the Bab] is
> the servant of the Remnant of God”) to the adhān.1003
4. Each believer to hang round his neck, reaching to his chest, a talisman

> (haykal) in the Bab’s hand, containing various names of God and other
> mysterious devices based on the divine names.1004
5. Each believer to wear a ring of white agate bearing the words: “there is

> no god but God; Muḥammad is the Prophet of God; ʿAlī is the walī of
> God; 273.”1005

> 6. To drink tea with the greatest cleanliness and delicacy.

7. To refrain from smoking.

It is, I think, clear that none of these prescriptions constitutes, in strict terms, an
abrogation of any part of the Islamic sharīʿa; they appear to be rather in the
nature of supererogatory observances designed to mark out the followers of the
Bab as especially pious—a point to which we shall return.

An important work which seems to have been written in Bushehr after the
Bab’s return from the ḥajj is the Ṣaḥīfa (or Kitāb) aʿmāl al­sana. This work
contains fourteen chapters, interspersed with unnumbered sections, basically
dealing with the observances and prayers for various important dates in the

Muslim calendar, and, in this respect, bearing a close resemblance to the Ṣaḥīfa
makhzūna. Of even greater importance are two works written most probably
shortly after the Bab’s return to Shīrāz in the summer of 1845.1006 These are two
related treatises on fiqh, the Ṣaḥīfa­yi ‘Adliyya and the Risāla furūʿ al­ʿAdliyya,
dealing with uṣūl and furūʿ respectively.

The Ṣaḥīfa­yi ʿAdliyya consists of five abwāb as follows:

> 1. On the mention of God
> 2. In explanation of the Balance according to the command of God
> 3. On the knowledge of God and his saints (awliyāʾ)
> 4. On the return to God (maʿād li ’llāh [sic])
> 5. On the prayer of devotion to God (ikhlāṣ li’llāh [sic]).

This would appear to be the first Persian work of the Bab’s, as he himself
explains in the text.1007 It is of particular value in helping us form a clear picture
of the Bab’s ideas at this juncture, especially since it seems to represent the first
step taken to address himself to a wider audience than the Shaykhi ulama for
whom his earlier works had been written. In the course of this work, he states
that the sharīʿa legal system “shall not be abrogated”;1008 speaks of his verses as
“utter nothingness when compared with a single word of the book of God or the
words of the people of the house of purity [i.e., the Imāms]”;1009 praises Shaykh
Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi , but condemns his followers;1010 refers to a vision of the head
of the Imām Ḥusayn, which he appears to have regarded as instrumental in
giving him his earliest inspiration;1011 condemns the concept of the oneness of
existence (waḥdat al­wujūd) as shirk;1012 lists the seven bases (uṣūl) of mystical
knowledge (maʿrifa) as tawḥīd, maʿānī, abwāb, imāma, arkān, nuqabāʾ, and
nujabāʾ;1013 states that prayer through the Imām or others is unbelief (kufr), and
denies that either al­Ahsaʾi or Rashti prayed through ʿAlī or thought him the
Creator (a point on which, as we have seen, they had been attacked);1014 regards
the station of the Imāms as higher that that of the prophets (anbiyāʾ);1015 states
that “most of the men and women of the Ithnāʾ­ʿasharī sect, by virtue of their
ignorance of this station [i.e., of the nuqabāʾ]”, shall go to hell (dūzakh);1016
declares the enemies of al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti to be unbelievers like the
Sunnis;1017 speaks of the former as the shīʿa khāliṣ;1018 writes of the necessity of
belief in a physical resurrection and miʿrāj, condemns the idea of spiritual
resurrection and maintains that al­Ahsaʾi did not speak of it;1019 and, finally,
speaks of obedience to himself, as the “servantæ of the twelfth Imām, as
obligatory.1020 When compared with statements in earlier works, it is clear that
the Bab had opted for the use of taqiyya, perhaps because this text was in
Persian.

The Risāla furūʿ al­Adlīyya is often found in manuscripts accompanying
the foregoing, but is generally less common. It has the distinction of being, as

far as is known, the earliest work of the Bab’s to have been translated. While its
author was staying at the house of Mīr Sayyid Muḥammad, the Imām­Jumʿa of
Isfahan, in the course of his visit to that city from late 1846 to 1847, Mullā
Muḥammad­Taqī Haravī (a Shaykhi ʿālim to whom we have referred previously
as a close disciple of Rashti) translated the Risāla from Arabic into Persian. It
consists of seven abwāb as follows:

> 1. Ziyāra jāmiʿa (ṣaghīra)
> 2.On ṣalāt
> 3.On aḥkām al­ṣalāt
> 4. On zakāt
> 5. On khums
> 6. On jihād
> 7. On dayn

All of these topics are dealt with in the traditional Shiʿi manner, often entering
into minute details of observances, purification, and suchlike, and suggesting
some familiarity on the part of the Bab with works of fiqh.

The most important work which can be assigned to the period of the
Bab’s residence in Shīrāz from July 1845 to September 1846 is the well­known
Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar, a commentary of over one hundred folios written for
Sayyid Yaḥyā Dārābī (known by the laqab Waḥīd), during the visit he made to
Shīrāz to interview the Bab (according to Babi accounts, on behalf of
Muḥammad Shāh).1021 An account of the writing of this work is given by
Zarandī.1022 It appears to have been widely circulated by the Bab’s followers:
ʿAbd al­Ḥusayn Navāʾī speaks of it being sent to Tehran, Kerman, and
Isfahan,1023 but it undoubtedly went much further afield than that—it was used,
for example, by Qurrat al­ʿAyn when preaching Babism in Kirmanshah,1024 and
we may, I think, assume that Dārābī himself carried a copy on his travels, which
carried him to most parts of Iran.

Interesting as it undoubtedly is in places, and highly regarded as it was by
the early Babis, this work is, for the most part, almost unreadable, consisting of
highly abstract and insubstantial speculation on the verses, words and even
letters of the sura on which it is supposed to be a “commentary”. Of greater
interest are the numerous aḥādīth which the Bab quotes in a later section of the
work, indicating his familiarity with works of tradition and his concern with the
prophecies relating to the advent of the Qā’im. In view of the development of
Babi doctrine after 1848, it is of interest to note the Bab’s reference here to the
fact that, although the ḥalāl and ḥarām of Muḥammad will endure “until the day
of resurrection”, yet when the Qā’im appears, “he shall bring a new book, new
laws, and a new dominion”.1025

We have here again, as in the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ, an appeal to the
inimitable verses of the book,1026 but, in distinction to the Ṣaḥīfa­yi ʿAdliyya, it
is claimed that only the words of the Imāms can compare with those of the

Bab.1027 As in the latter work, he praises al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti but condemns
their followers,1028 while here he maintains that “all that Kāẓim and Aḥmad
before him have written… does not equal a single word of what I have revealed
to you.”1029

Nevertheless, as we shall note in the next section, the claims which he
advances in this work are in apparent contradiction to those which he had made
previously.1030 The Bab’s remarks here on the concept of rukn al­rābiʿ shall also
be dealt with separately. It is of interest to note that, in the course of this tafsīr,
the Bab specifically identifies the Imāms as the general cause of creation (ʿilla
kulliyya fī ibdāʿ al­mumkināt wa ikhtirāʿ al­mawjūdāt)1031—a doctrine for
which al­Ahsaʾi had been attacked.1032 During this period, the Bab also wrote a
large number of tafsīrs, including the Tafsīr āyat al­nūr, the Tafsīr Sūrat al­
qadr, the Tafsīr Sūrat al­tawḥīd, and those on various aḥādīth; he also continued
to pen replies to queries from a large number of individuals and to write treatises
on topics such as jabr and tawḥīd, qadr, and even grammar and syntax (naḥw
wa ṣarf).1033

It is, I think, clear that ample material exists, albeit scattered and, at times,
badly transcribed, which may serve as a basis for the study of the inception and
early development of the Bab’s thought. One of the most difficult things about
following this development through his entire career is its very rapidity, with
several large­scale modifications of doctrine taking place in the space of only six
years. Most that has been written about the Bab’s thought has concentrated on
his later ideas, as expressed in the Persian Bayān and other works of the late
period. This needs to be balanced in future studies by detailed reference to his
ideas at this critical early stage. In the works we have mentioned above may be
found answers to several important questions, such as what the Bab’s earliest
claims were, what his attitude was to Islam, the Qurʾan, the sharīʿa, the Imāms,
and the abwāb, what he thought about the advent of the Hidden Imām, what his
ideas were with regard to jihād, and what he thought of the Shaykhi school.

The Early Claims of the Bab

In our first chapter, we indicated several ways in which the charismatic authority
of the Imāms was transferred or routinized in the period following the presumed
disappearance of the twelfth Imām, and discussed the development of charisma
among the ulama, especially the mujtahidūn, marājiʿ al­taqlīd; and, in the
modern period, ayatollahs. Later, in our discussions of al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti, we
showed how their roles as “bearers” of the knowledge of the Imāms represented
a particularly dramatic expression of the “polar motif” in Shiʿism, and were
closely related to its “gnostic motif”. In our last section, we demonstrated how,
in his early writings, the Bab emphasized the “gnostic motif” by laying claim to
direct knowledge from the Hidden Imām, which was, in turn, waḥy from God,
and, in our final chapter, we shall return to this motif in relation to the concept

of “inner knowledge” (bāṭin) “revealed” by the Bab. At this point, however, it
will be useful to discuss—albeit more briefly than is desirable—the polar motif
as developed in the early claims of the Bab, both in terms of his own statements
and those of his followers concerning him.

It will, perhaps, be as well to take as our starting point the Shaykhi
doctrine of the “fourth support” (rukn al­rābiʿ). In Izhāq al­Bātil, Kirmānī
maintains that the “basic question” involved in the dispute with Babism is the
existence of the true bearer (ḥāmil) of the rukn al­rābiʿ. When Rashti died, there
had to be a bearer after him, and people went in search of his successor in this
capacity. At this point, the Bab made his claims and many came to regard him as
this ḥāmil rukn­i rābiʿ.1034 In the same work, Kirmānī states that, during the
lifetime of Rashti, the Bab had read what he (Kirmānī) had written on the need
for a fourth support and the impossibility of any age being deprived of it.1035
Inadvertently, as it were, Kirmānī here provides us with an important clue as to
the nature of the doctrine of the rukn al­rābiʿ as he originally taught it, and the
reason for his modification of the doctrine in subsequent writings.

Let us first give a short description of the doctrine as expounded by
Kirmānī in seven works between 1261/1845 and 1282/1865.1036 Briefly, it is
this: traditional Shiʿi theology speaks of five bases (uṣūl) of religion—the divine
unity (tawḥīd), prophethood (nubuwwa), resurrection (maʿād), justice (ʿadl),
and the imamate (imāma).

Shaykhi belief, according to Kirmānī, is that knowledge of God, like that
of the Prophet or Imāms, implies and involves a knowledge of all of His
attributes. Since none of these attributes can be denied by the believer, it makes
more sense to speak of “the knowledge of God” as the first base of religion.
Similarly, resurrection is a necessary consequence of the justice of God, since “it
is a corollary of justice that the obedient be rewarded and unbelievers
punished”;1037 from another point of view, belief in the resurrection is
necessitated by a belief in the Prophet and the veracity of his words.1038
“Therefore,” he writes, “all five of the bases of religion are clearly affirmed in
these three bases [i.e., knowledge of God, nubuwwa, and imāma].”1039

A fourth aṣl or rukn is added on the grounds that the bases of religion are
those matters in which each individual believer must exercise his own initiative
(ijtihād) and not rely on or imitate others (i.e., use taqlīd).1040 Kirmānī maintains
that the decision as to whether one is entitled to exercise ijtihād or must base
one’s actions on taqlīd to a scholar of the rank of mujtahid is, in itself, another
area in which every believer must exercise his own judgment.1041 The
recognition of such a mujtahid (or ʿālim, faqīh, etc.) ranks, therefore, as a fourth
support of religion.1042

The nature of this fourth rukn is elsewhere expressed by Kirmānī in
somewhat different terms. Religious questions, he says, are of two kinds:
knowledge of essences (dhawāt) and knowledge of the statements (aqwāl) of

these essences. The knowledge of the essences involves four groups: knowledge
of God, the Prophet, the Imāms, and the generic (nawʿī) knowledge of the
friends (awliyāʾ) and enemies (aʿdāʾ).1043 With respect to the statements of these
four groups, man is required to know the divine decrees (sharāʾiʿ), which
obliges him to know the words of the prophets in which they are expressed,
which in turn demands knowledge of the words of the Imāms in which these
latter are interpreted; the bearers of the knowledge of the Imāms are the
transmitters (rawāt) of their words and the scholars (ulama) familiar with their
traditions, whose words must also be known.1044 Knowledge of the words of
these four groups constitutes the uṣūl.1045 Thus, the four uṣūl or arkān are:

> 1. Knowledge of God
> 2. Knowledge of the Prophet
> 3. Knowledge of the Imāms
> 4. Knowledge of the awliyāʾ of the Imāms.1046

In the sense that the term awliyāʾ may be applied to a wide range of people—in
its fullest sense to all the Shiʿa—including nuqabāʾ and nujabāʾ, in practice the
mujtahidūn and fuqahāʾ are the lowest grade of the rukn al­rābiʿ.1047

In his Risāla­yi sī faṣl and the Risāla dar jawāb­i yik nafar­i Iṣfahānī,
Kirmānī devotes considerable space to refuting the charge that he regarded
himself in a specific sense as the rukn al­rābiʿ, or that the term could, indeed be
applied to a specific person in a given age. “The fourth support of the faith,” he
writes, “consists of the scholars (ulama) and worthies (akābir) of the Shiʿa, and
they are numerous in every period.”1048

> We regard the rukn al­rābiʿ as love (walāyat) for the friends of God
> (awliyāʾ Allāh) and dissociation (barāʾat) from the enemies of God;
> after the arkān, we regard the nuqabāʾ and nujabāʾ as the greatest
> of the friends of God…. But, by God, we have not considered it
> obligatory to know the friends of God in the form of their chiefs
> (aʿyānihim) or their individual members (ashkhāṣihim), and have
> not laid on men an insupportable duty (taklīf mā lā yuṭāq). Rather,
> we have said that the generic knowledge (maʿrifat­i nawʿ) of the
> awliyāʾ is essential, that is, “what sort of person is the walī and
> what are his attributes?”…. We have not said that one should
> recognize a specific or definite naqīb, or that one should recognize
> one of the nujabāʾ in a specific or definite form.1049

The relevance of the foregoing to our earlier discussion of the role of the arkān,
nuqabāʾ, nujabāʾ and ulama as general bearers of the charisma of the Imāms
does not, I think, need further elaboration.

Kirmānī also refutes the idea that al­Ahsaʾi or Rashti were the rukn al­
rābiʿ in their respective ages. In the general sense, he says, this is true, in that
they fulfilled the conditions necessary for a marājiʿ al­taqlīd. “But”, he goes on,
“God forbid that I should regard them as the specific rukn al­rābiʿ for their
ages.”1050 In this general sense also, Kirmānī regards himself as a marjaʿ after
al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti,1051 but refutes any charge of his having claimed personally
to be the nāʾib or representative of the Imām.1052 The Babis, however, have, he
maintains, held it as obligatory to obey a single individual.1053

Originally, the Bab himself would appear to have taught a version of the
rukn al­rābiʿ doctrine similar to that developed more fully by Kirmānī. In his
earliest extant work, the Risāla fi ’l­sulūk, he states that “religion stands on four
pillars: al­tawḥīd, al­nubuwwa, al­wilāya, and al­shiʿa.”1054 In the Tafsīr Sūrat
al­baqara, he repeats that “the shiʿa are the rukn al­rābiʿ” and quotes a popular
ḥadīth in this connection, in which the Imām Mūsā al­Kāẓim ibn Jaʿfar (745?­
799) states that the “greatest name” (al­ism al­aʿẓam) consists of four letters:
“the first is the statement “there is no god but God”; the second “Muḥammad is
the Prophet of God”; the third is ourselves [the Imāms]; and the fourth our
shiʿa.”1055

The Qayyūm al­asmāʾ and other works written soon after Shirazi’s
declaration contain no reference to the doctrine, but it is discussed again under
the title “the hidden support” (al­rukn al­makhzūn) in the Tafsīr Sūrat al­
kawthar, written for Sayyid Yaḥyā Dārābī, who had not been a Shaykhi.

“Had you been one of the companions of Kazīm,” he writes, “you would
understand the matter of the hidden support, in the same way that you
comprehend the [other] three supports.”1056 He then argues that, “just as you
stand in need of an individual sent from God who may transmit unto you what
your Lord has willed, so you stand in need of an ambassador (ṣafīr) from your
Imām.”1057 If it should be objected that the ulama as a whole fulfill this function
(a view Kirmānī held by this date, if not before), he would reply that the ulama
differ from one another in rank, some being superior to others. They are not
even in agreement on all issues, as is evident from the variation of their words,
actions, and beliefs. Now, if we accept the principle that certain ulama are
superior to others, it becomes necessary for us to abandon one of the inferior
rank in order to give our allegiance to his superior – a process which must, in the
end, lead us to the recognition of a single person superior to all others.1058 “It is
impossible,” he writes, “that the bearer of universal grace from the Imām should
be other than a single individual.”1059

The rukn al­rābiʿ doctrine is developed in relation to the Bab by Qurrat
al­ʿAyn in an undated risāla. Describing Muḥammad and the Imāms as the
collective “sign” of God’s knowledge to His creation,1060 she indicates that they
have appeared in every age in different forms and “clothing” and that men have
been and shall be tested by this until the day of resurrection.1061 In each age,
these “signs” appear in the form of “perfected humanity” (insāniyyat­i kāmil)

and “all­embracing” (nurāniyyat­i shāmil).1062 Faith (īmān) is based on four
pillars (arkān),1063 the fourth pillar being the “manifest towns” (qurā ẓāhira)
referred to in Qurʾan 34:18, that is, the ulama, from whom the mass of believers
(raʿāyā) must take sustenance (i.e., knowledge fed to them during the period of
the ghayba).1064 God has chosen to reveal the station of the rukn al­rābiʿ in this
age, although it was previously concealed, just as the rukn of wilāya was kept
hidden in the time of Muḥammad.1065 The meaning of the term rasūl in each age
is the “bearer of the hidden sign”, whom God reveals whenever he deems it
suitable.1066 In this age, he has revealed the rukn al­rābiʿ and sent a rasūl,
bayyina, and dhikr al­imām (i.e. the Bab),1067 This individual, she says is the
‘manifest town’ (in the singular) revealed by God.1068 That the rukn al­rābiʿ has,
therefore, been revealed in a single person is made fully clear some pages
further on, when she states that God has sent the pure shīʿa in a specific form
(shīʿa­yi khāliṣ­rā az maqām­i ikhtiṣāṣ nāzil farmūda).1069

Sayyid Yaḥyā Dārābī (originally a non­Shaykhi, as we have mentioned)
also applies the rukn al­rābiʿ concept to the Bab in what appears to be a letter
belonging to the slightly later period:

> He [God] sent him [Adam] to reveal the mystery of one of these
> [four] arkān, namely that of tawḥīd and the sign of the gracious one
> [i.e., God]; and assistance was given in the spread [of this principle]
> by the other prophets, both those endowed with constancy (ulū ’l­
> ʿaẓm) and the rest, until the rise of the sun of knowledge from the
> horizon of certitude, that is, the seal of the prophets and the prince
> of men and jinn [i.e., Muḥammad]. And he commanded him to
> reveal the mystery of the second rukn, namely, that of nubuwwa,
> the source of all truths, until the day of al­Ghadīr [i.e. Ghadīr
> Khumm], the best of days and the pivot of all ages. Whereupon he
> brought himself to perfection and entrusted his successors (waṣiya
> ilā awliyāʾihi) the revelation of the third rukn, that is, the rukn of
> wilāya and the interpretation (taʾwīl) of the Qurʾanic verse “when it
> is said to them ‘There is no god but God,’ they grow proud”
> [37:35]. [This continued] until the rising of the sun of eternity in
> sixty­one preceded by one thousand and two hundred [i.e., 1260],
> when the Imāms (āl­Allāh) and the letters of the word of
> explanation inspired the heart of their servant, whose breast was
> expanded for all revelations by the shining of the body of the
> princess of women [i.e., Faṭima], nay of all created things in the
> kingdom of command and creation, that he might reveal the
> mystery of the fourth rukn of the universal word, the last of the
> conditions of faith. At this point, the ages came to their close
> (tammat al­adwār) and the dispensations were completed (kamulat
> al­akwār).1070

The Bab himself emphasizes the need for a bearer of the divine
knowledge in every age. The earth, he says, is never empty of the proof (ḥujja)
of God,1071 and there must always be a “bearer of the cause of God” (ḥāmil amr
Allāh) between prophets (ʿalā fiṭratin min al­rusul).1072 Thus, he himself, as the
dhikr, has come during such an interval.1073 During the shorter ghayba, he states,
the Hidden Imām was represented on earth by wukalāʾ and nuwwāb, these being
the four abwāb.1074 Thus, the Imām sent the abwāb down during the ghayba and
recently sent Aḥmad al­Ahsaʾi and Kāẓim (Rashti).1075 A similar view is put
forward in a risāla written by an anonymous Babi in 1264/1848, where it is
stated that, in the shorter ghayba, there appeared the “four appointed gates” (al­
abwāb al­arbaʿa al­manṣūṣa), while in the greater ghayba, there were “gates not
appointed by name or connection,” who appeared in every age until two further
specific gates were sent—al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti.1076

It does seem that the acceptance of Sayyid ʿAlī Muḥammad as bāb was
facilitated by prior recognition of al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti as “the Shaykh and Bab”
(al­shaykh al­bāb) and ‘the Sayyid and Bab’ (al­sayyid al­bāb),1077 or as “the
first Bab” and “the second Bab”,1078 or as “the previous two gates”,1079 or simply
as “the two gates”.1080 Even the later Kitāb­i nuqṭat al­kāf speaks of them as
“those two mighty gates.”1081 The Bab himself refers to them on several
occasions as “the two previous gates of God”1082 and speaks of his “revelation”
as being in confirmation of “the two gates.”1083

The close relationship between the Bab and his two predecessors is
clearly outlined by Qurrat al­ʿAyn in what seems to be an early risāla.
Beginning with the assertion that man has been created to know God, but that
the gate of direct maʿrifa is closed to him,1084 she refers to a tradition from the
Imām Ṣādiq, who indicated that man might know God “through his name and
his attribute,”1085 This “name and attribute” has a place of revelation (maẓhar)
and appearance (ẓuhūr) in every age and epoch.1086 God chooses an individual,
teaches him what he wishes, and makes him his ḥujja, bāb, nabī, dhikr, and
rasūl to the creation.1087 There is no difference between the nabī, waṣī, rasūl,
and bāb in reality.1088 God sent down the prophets, then Muḥammad, then the
Imāms; after this, the Twelfth Imām became hidden.1089 Since, however, it was
still necessary for men to be guided, the abwāb were appointed.1090 Following
them, there appeared in every age “an arbiter” (ʿadūl) to keep the faith pure.1091
The Shiʿa were thus guided until there appeared sinful ulama who advanced
various claims and rendered it necessary for the Imām to distinguish the good
from the wicked.1092 The Imām singled out a perfect man, taught him his inner
knowledge, and made him maʿṣūm—this was al­Ahsaʾi.1093 After him, God
appointed Rashti as another sign.1094 On the Sayyid’s death, it was necessary for
God to establish a sign according to the exigencies of the time and place, so he
revealed the Bab as his gate and proof,1095 as “the third gate after the two” (al­

bāb al­thālith baʿda ’l­ithnayn),1096 as the fourth letter of the greatest name of
God,1097 and as the bāb, dhikr, and rasūl.1098

In this earliest period, then, the Bab made himself known as a gate to the
Imām succeeding al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti. Mīrzā Muḥammad ʿAlī Zunūzī thus
describes these early claims:

> At the beginning of the cause, he made himself known by the title bāb and
> “servant of the baqiyyat Allāh,” so that, as people say, he was regarded as
> having been sent by the Hidden Imām, Muḥammad ibn al­Ḥasan…. He
> established his verses below the words of the Imāms, but above those of
> the Shaykh and the Sayyid… and gave himself out as an interpreter
> (mubayyin) and promulgator (murawwij) of the Qurʾan and Islam… while
> all his followers… regarded him as the gate of divine knowledge and as
> superior to the Shaykh and the Sayyid.1099

“Most of the Babis in the first years,” writes Māzandarānī, “regarded the Bab as
the pillar of the knowledge of the Imām.”1100 The Bab thus identifies himself in
the Qayyūm al­ asmāʾ as “the servant [of God] and the gate of his proof [i.e., the
Hidden Imām] unto all the worlds,”1101 as “the servant of God and the gate of the
baqiyyat Allāh,”1102 and as “the gate of the walī.”1103 In this respect, he is no
different from the abwāb of the past1104 (who are, indeed, regarded as still
alive),1105 except that he is the “seal of the gates” (khātim al­abwāb),1106 the
“gate of your expected Imām.”1107 His appearance, then is for the express
purpose of making the way ready for the Imām’s parousia; his earliest books,
states Qurrat al­ʿAyn, were sent out to prepare men for the advent of the
Qāʾim,1108 which will take place after him.1109

Writing in retrospect in the Dalāʾil­i sabʿa’, the Bab speaks thus of his
earliest claims:

> Consider the grace of the promised one (ḥaḍrat­i muntaẓar) in so
> extending his mercy to the people of Islam (al­muslimīn); so that he
> might give them salvation, he that is the first of all created things
> and the manifestation of the words “Verily, I am God” revealed
> himself as the bāb of the Qā’im of the family of Muḥammad.”1110

On the principle that belief in the abwāb leads to belief in the Imāms, the
Prophet and God, and disbelief in them to kufr,1111 the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ states,
in the words of the Imām, that

> There is none who has followed this remembrance [hādhā ’l­dhikr –
> — the Bab] but that he has followed me; whoever loves the
> remembrance for the sake of God, loves me; whoever seeks to
> behold me, let him behold his face, and whoever seeks to hearken to

my words (al­ḥadīth minnī), let him give ear to the novelties of
wisdom and the keys of the mercy from the tongue of God.1112

Similarly, whoever visits the Bab, it is as if he has visited the Imāms,1113

while whoever obeys the dhikr and his book has obeyed God and his saints.1114
He is, indeed, the gate of God1115 and his remembrance;1116 those who pledge
allegiance to him have done so to God,1117 and those who visit him have visited
God on his throne.1118

Identification with the Imām (but not, at this stage, with God) is taken at
times beyond simple representation. Thus, “the Imām” declares that “we are he
and he is we, save that he is himself and is our servant, who was a witness in all
the worlds in the Mother of the Book; and we are ourselves, whom God has
made his proofs collectively to all the worlds, through the mighty truth.”1119
“God,” he states, “has made him [the Bab] my own self in the worlds of
command and creation. I am, by God’s permission, never absent from him for
the least period that your Lord, the merciful, can calculate, nor is he ever absent
from me.”1120 Again, he says that “those that have disbelieved in God ask you
about meeting me (ʿan liqāʾī); say “behold me, if your souls be firm, and you
shall see him,’”1121 while, in a later passage, he declares that “my proof unto you
is this person [who is] my own person.”1122

We have here perhaps the clearest and most highly developed expression
of the continuance of the charismatic authority of the Imām during the period of
the ghaybat al­kubrā. Once we move into the later stage of the Bab’s claims,
from about 1848 onwards, we enter a different charismatic framework; he is no
longer claiming to be the channel of the Imām’s authority nor even his alter ego,
as it were, on earth, but to be the Imām himself and, before long, a theophanic
representation of the divinity (maẓhar ilāhī). The Bab is the focus of charismatic
attention throughout (although not the only focus), but, in the early period, his
authority is delivered (latently) from the overriding charismatic image of the
Imām, whereas, at a later stage, he assumes an independent authority canceling
all previous notions of charismatic relationship, transforming latent into original,
“prophetic” charisma.

Although even the earliest claims of the Bab constantly threaten to
overturn the system of relationships on which they are postulated (by claiming,
for example, to be the person of the Imām), this threat is kept in check by the
presence of a dialectic tension between more developed claims on the one hand
and less startling ones—and even recantations of claims—on the other. The use
of taqiyya leads to some remarkable voltes faces. Thus, he states in an early
prayer that “I am the bearer of a knowledge like Kāẓim, and if God should
choose to reveal another cause, he will be the solace of my eyes; otherwise, I
have not claimed anything and do not say that I am the bearer of a cause other
than that.”1123 In the Ṣaḥīfa­yi ʿadliyya, he describes himself as a “servant”
chosen by the Hidden Imām “in order to protect the faith of God,”1124 and

indicates that his words are as “utter nothingness” compared to the Qurʾan and
the words of the Imāms.1125

This tendency is most marked in the Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar, where he
declares that anyone who says he claims waḥy and a Qurʾan is a blasphemer, as
is anyone who says he claims to be “the gate of the baqiyyat Allāh,”1126 and
maintains that he has not claimed “special bābiyya”.1127 He is merely, he states,
a Persian chosen to protect the faith of the Prophet and the Imāms,1128 and a
servant of God confirming the laws of the Qurʾan.1129 In general, however, a
gradual development may be observed, whereby the Bab explores most of the
permutations of radical charismatic authority available to him within the terms
of Shaykhi and Shiʿi theory. Taken beyond these limits, the claims inherent in
extreme Shiʿi theophanology led inevitably to a complete break with Shaykhism
and, in the end, to the abandonment of Islam itself.

CHAPTER SIX:

THE BĀBĪ DA’WA AMONG THE SHAYKHIS AND THE BREAK WITH
SHAYKHISM

The Daʿwa in Karbala

According to al­Qatīl ibn al­Karbalā∆ī, the Bab’s initial “revelation” (ẓuhūr)
to the ḥurūf al­ḥayy lasted from the tenth (al­ʿashr al­awwal) of Jumādā I to
20 Jumādā II 1260/7 July 1844.1130 He then instructed them to return to their
homes,1131 telling them not to reveal his name or identity,1132 but urging them
to announce that the bāb or nāʾib­i khāṣṣ of the Hidden Imām had
appeared.1133 Through these “forerunners” (sābiqūn) and the men they met
and converted, the claims of the new teacher were rapidly made known,
principally to the Shaykhi communities in the areas they visited. Mullā
Yūsuf Arbabīlī succeeded in converting most or all of the large Shaykhi
population of Mīlān in Azerbaijan.1134 Mullā Aḥmad Ibdāl Marāghaʾī
acquainted Mullā Ḥusayn Dakhīl Marāghaʾī with the Bab’s claims; the latter
in turn traveled to Shīrāz, only to find that the Bab had left on the ḥajj.
Returning to Marāgha, he made a point of telling the Shaykhis in every town
and village en route of the Bab’s appearance, while he succeeded in
converting most of the Shaykhis in Marāgha itself.1135 Mullā Jalīl Urūmī was
instructed to go to Qazvīn, where he married and stayed for some three years
teaching Babism, his converts consisting in the main of Shaykhis from the
town.1136

Mullā Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī, along with his inseparable brother and
cousin, was sent to Khurāsān via Tehran, where he attempted to present a
letter from the Bab to Muḥammad Shah and his prime minister, Ḥājī Mīrzā
Āqāsī. In this missive, the king was called on to embrace the Bab’s cause in
return for a promise of victory over foreign states.1137 Bushrūʾī finally
proceeded to Mashhad, where he established a flourishing center for Babi
propaganda, again drawing much support from Shaykhi ulama.1138 In this
way, a growing section of the Shaykhi school followed the Bab in the period
of the earliest claims, even if—as happened in Marāgha, for example—many
of these abandoned him some three years later on his assumption of the
station of Qāʾim and his abrogation of the Islamic sharīʿa. The unity of

Shaykhism was irretrievably shattered, and a core of convinced Babis
created, who were eager to put into practice the radical changes implicit in
the Bab’s later claims.

The most shattering impact made by the dissemination of Babi
propaganda on the Shaykhi world occurred, inevitably, at its heart, in
Karbala. Most or all of the group which had arrived in Shīrāz with Mullā
ʿAlī Basṭāmī returned to Karbala, although it would seem that Basṭāmī
himself did not accompany them on this occasion. Al­Karbalāʾī states that
they arrived there on 26 Rajab/11August.1139 The following day, 27 Rajab/12
August, was the ziyārat al­mabʿath, and Shaykhis from Baghdad, Ḥilla, and
elsewhere had gathered in Karbala with those from the town itself; on
hearing that Basṭāmī’s group had returned, they met with them and were told
something of what had occurred.1140 According to al­Karbalāʾī, “the cause of
the Imām was manifested in the month of Rajab and was so much spread
about that there remained no­one in this region who had not heard of it.”1141
It seems likely that the Bab’s identity was, in fact, revealed by some of the
ḥurūf al­ḥayy, for al­Karbalā’ī notes that

> those who had seen the Bab before that said “if such a person is
> making a claim, then I shall accept him (fa­anā min al­
> muslimīn)”; this included Bālāsarīs and persons weak in their
> faith in Shiʿism, among the people of Kāẓimiyya, and likewise
> servants of the blessed shrines.1142

The Bab himself states in an early letter that he never mentioned his name in
any of his works, but that some of his first followers revealed it.1143

Although he may have left Shīrāz before the other members of his
group, possibly shortly after Bushrūʾī’s departure,1144 Basṭāmī did not arrive
in Karbala until about October 1844.1145 He traveled by way of Būshehr
(where he visited the Bab’s uncle, Sayyid ʿAlī), Najaf and Kufa,1146 carrying
with him a copy of the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ,1147 a ziyārartnāma to be read at
the shrine of ʿAlī in Najaf,1148 and a copy of the Ṣaḥīfa al­makhzūna.1149
With Basṭāmī’s arrival at the ʿatabāt, events began to move at an
increasingly rapid pace, precipitating a final break in the already
disintegrating Shaykhi community, lending fresh impetus to the new
movement of the Bab, and giving to the Shiʿi ulama in Iraq their first
premonition of the alarming developments which were to take place there
and in Iran in coming years.

While in Najaf, on instructions from the Bab, Basṭāmī made known
the latter’s claims to Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥasan al­Najafī; to whom we have
referred to in our first chapter as the leading Shiʿi ʿālim and marjaʿ al­taqlīd
of this period. According to Kāẓim Samandar, Mullā ʿAlī carried with him a
letter from the Bab addressed to al­Najafi.1150 The Shaykh ’s reaction and
that of his ṭullāb—among whom were numbered several Shaykhis—was
necessarily negative, and they expelled Basṭāmī from Najaf as a heretic1151
—the first of many cases in which the Bab’s claim served as a means of
identifying the interests of Shaykhis and Bālā­Sarīs, by providing a target
which both could condemn.

According to Samandar, the Bab instructed his followers to call a
meeting of the ulama in Karbala and to challenge them to a mubāhala.1152
Whether or not Mullā ʿAlī actually issued such a challenge, his activities in
Karbala certainly aroused fierce opposition from the mujtahids there.
Concentrating his preaching among the Shaykhis, he soon succeeded in
winning over, what, in Sir Henry Creswick Rawlinson’s (1810­1895)
words, constituted

> a considerable section. . . of the Sheeahs of Nejef, who. . . have
> lately risen into notice as the disciples of the High Priest Sheikh
> Kazem [i.e., Rashti], and who are in avowed expectation of the
> speedy advent of the Imām.1153 If anything, Basṭāmī’s influence
> was much greater among the Shaykhis of Karbala than among
> those of Najaf. Although he was himself arrested soon after his
> arrival in Karbala,1154 imprisoned and tried in Baghdad,1155 and
> finally exiled to Istanbul,1156 where he was sentenced to labor in
> the docks,1157 he succeeded in converting large numbers even
> while in prison, through the mediation of Shaykh Muḥammad
> Shibl Baghdādī, the late Sayyid Kāẓim’s wakīl in Baghdad.1158

During his stay at the ʿatabāt, Basṭāmī had, in fact, awoken something
of a chiliastic fervor among the Shaykhis of the region. There already
existed a sense of messianic expectation in Karbala and Baghdad. According
to al­Karbalāʾī (who had by then accepted the Bab’s cause without, at that
time, knowing anything of his identity), people expected that “the cause
would be revealed to them and the veil lifted from them so that the secret
might conquer them in the year 1261”.1159 The same writer, who was present
in Karbala at this period, indicates that a considerable sense of expectancy

centered on the year 1261. He cites Mullā Jaʿfar Kirmānshāhī as saying that
he was once with al­Ahsaʾi during the latter’s preparations for his last
journey to Mecca in 1826; some people asked him concerning the signs of
the appearance of the Imām; and he merely replied “Sixty­one.”1160 Mulla
Ja’far is said to have spread this “prophecy” before and after the death of
Rashti. According to al­Karbalāʾī some Jews in Karbala referred to the
Bab’s cause as being “what we awaited in the month of Rabīʿ I of the year
Sixty­one,”1161 while many Ṣūfīs, particularly those of the Niʿmatullāhī
order, were expecting the Imām to appear—al­Karbalāʾī claims that he had
heard twenty­five years previously certain prophecies from them referring to
the year Sixty­one.1162 Everyone, he writes, expected the promised one to
appear from his own group, and he specifically mentions here the Ṣūfīs,
Bālāsarīs, Ismailis, other Shʿ‘is, and even Sunnis.1163

How widespread this sense of expectancy really was outside the
circles of the Shaykhi school (and even within these circles) is extremely
difficult to say without independent evidence, but it is clear that it was by no
means restricted to the Shaykhi community.

The purpose of the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ, one of the works of the Bab
brought to the ʿatabāt by Basṭāmī was, in the words of Rawlinson,

> to prepare the Mohammedan world for the immediate
> manifestation of the Imām, and to identify the individual to
> whom the emendations of the text [of what was regarded, as we
> have noted, as a corrupted copy of the Qurʾan] were revealed,
> as his inspired and true precursor.1164

Basṭāmī’s arrest and trial did little to calm the growing unrest and messianic
expectancy; in his account of the trial, Rawlinson writes:

> I understand that considerable uneasiness is beginning to
> display itself at Kerbela and Nejef, in regard to the expected
> manifestation of the Imām, and I am apprehensive that the
> measures now in progress will rather increase than allay the
> excitement.1165

The nervous anticipation which this activity aroused was further
intensified by the arrival of news that, on leaving for pilgrimage in
September,1166 the Bab had said that he would reveal his cause in Mecca,
enter Kufa and Karbala, and fulfill the prophecies.1167 In various letters, he

called on his followers to gather together in Karbala, in order to aid the
Qā’im when he would appear.1168 In one of these letters, he writes:

> In this month, there has occurred that which your Lord had
> promised unto everyone, old or young. He shall, indeed triumph
> over the holy land (al­arḍ al­muqaddaṣa—i.e. Karbala) by
> virtue of a word through which all that is in the heavens and on
> the earth shall be cleft asunder; wait, therefore…. He who shall
> arise in truth (al­qāʾim bi ’l­ḥaqq) is the one who shall dispense
> justice; he shall be made manifest from Mecca…. Lend your
> support, then, unto the Qāʾim (whose advent) you have awaited,
> in the company of those who expect him, from every direction,
> and do not create mischief in the land. Truly, behind Kufa a
> new cause shall be manifested.1169

In an early letter to Mīrzā Ḥasan­i­Khurāsānī (d. 1852),1170 the Bab instructs
him to “send greetings from him who is the remembrance of the name of
your Lord unto those who were the first to believe (al­sābiqūn) and tell them
to travel to Karbala (al­arḍ al­muqaddaṣa).”1171

Large numbers of Babis appear to have responded to the Bab’s appeal
and headed for Karbala to await his arrival, many of them, apparently,
preparing to fight a holy war in the company of the Imām, in conformity
with the explicit exhortations of the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ.1172 Numbers of these
seem to have brought with them or obtained arms with which to wage this
jihād, in accordance with the Bab’s instructions in that book to “purchase
arms for the day of the gathering together (yawm al­jamʿ).”1173

According to Kirmānī, the followers of the Bab spread out, telling
men of his promise to come to Karbala with the intention of leaving the
shrine of Ḥusayn on the day of ʿĀshūrā, bearing a sword, in order to lead his
followers in jihād.1174 On 27 January, 1845, Rawlinson reported to Sir
Stratford Canning that “the concourse of Persian pilgrimage at Kerbela at the
present season is immense—it is estimated that between twenty and thirty
thousand of these devotees are now assembled at the shrine of Ḥusayn.”1175

It is unclear how many of those assembled at Karbala at this period
anticipated an actual war and how many believed that they would go forth in
the company of the Imām to re­enact the suffering and martyrdom of the day
of ʿĀshūrā. Al­Karbalāʾī maintains that some said the Bab commanded his
followers not to rise up in Karbala, and quoted the tradition “the heads of my
followers shall be given as presents even as those of the Turks and the

Daylāmites.”1176 This passion motif certainly loomed large in the minds of
the Babis besieged in the fort of Shaykh Tabarsī in 1848.

The ʿĀshūrā rites, which had developed in Iran in the sixteenth
century, had for a long time been proscribed by governors of Iraq, but during
the governorship of Alī Riḍāʾ Pasha, a Bektāshī Ṣūfī with Shiʿi sympathies,
permission was given, and both taʿziyas and processions began to be held in
1832\.1177 Religious tension between Sunnis and Shiʿis in Karbala, already
unusually tense following the sack of the city in 1842, was all too easily
heightened during the Muḥarram mourning period. Turkish­Persian relations
were particularly bad at this period and, since Basṭāmī’s trial had already
stirred up considerable animosity on this basis, even between the two
governments, the influx of Iranian Shiʿis anticipating some form of
messianic upheaval was clearly a matter of concern. The situation in Karbala
threatened to be explosive and, if the Bab had actually arrived, it is hard to
say what might have happened.

Kirmānī maintains, however, that the Bab had miscalculated the
distance from Mecca to Karbala and that, realizing he could not succeed in
reaching his destination by the 10th of Muḥarram, he was compelled to put
back the date of his arrival to Naw­Rūz (21 March).1178 In the event, the
land­route from Mecca to Karbala was closed by Arab tribes and the Bab
was forced to return to Iran by way of Būshehr.1179 When Muharram and
then Naw­Rūz passed and the Bab did not put in an appearance, no one
knew whether “he had been drowned at sea or burnt on land” and, in the end,
his followers felt ashamed of the claims they had put forward on his
behalf.1180 Rawlinson noted that

> the religious excitement which has been for some time
> prevalent among the Sheeahs of this quarter, is beginning
> gradually to subside, the imposter who personated the character
> of the forerunner of the Imām Mehdi, and who was expected to
> declare himself at Kerbela during the present month on his
> return from Mecca, having been deterred by a sense of personal
> danger from attempting any further agitation, and having
> accordingly joined as a private individual the caravan of
> pilgrims which is travelling to Persia by the route of Damascus
> and Aleppo.1181

Kirmānī himself regarded both the Bab’s call to wage jihād and his eventual
failure to fulfill the promises he had made as evidence of the falsehood of
his mission.1182

What happened, in fact, was that the Bab sailed from Jidda on 24

Ṣafar 1261/4 March 1845,1183 and reached Būshehr on 8 Jumādī I/15 May, as
noted previously. Shortly after his arrival there, he sent a letter to Karbala,
probably with Ḥājī Sayyid Javād Iṣfahānī, telling his disciples still
assembled there that it had proved necessary to alter his plans in order to
return directly to Iran, and that they ought to proceed to Isfahan and remain
there until the arrival of further instructions.1184 Whatever the reasons for the
Bab’s change of plans, it precipitated a serious breach in the ranks of his
followers in Karbala, leading large numbers to abandon him. According to
al­Karbalāʾī, “only a tiny band” remained after this incident, the trial of
Mullā ʿAlī, and the arrest, some six months later of, Mullā Ṣādiq Khurāsānī,
Mullā Muḥammad­ʿAlī Bārfurūshī, and Mullā ʿAlī Akbar Ardastānī in
Shīrāz.1185 This small group of diehards regarded the change in intentions as
the interposition of bidʿa and were, if anything, reinforced in their new
allegiance.1186

The Bab himself indicated that, because of opposition to his cause and
attacks on his messengers, God had become angry with men and decreed a
postponement of five years in which they might increase in sins and the
divine proclamation to them be completed.1187 In his Kitāb al­fihrist,
completed in Bushehr about one month after his return to Iran, he writes
“Woe to you, O people of the earth! Some of you have contended against
our signs; as a result we have forbidden our signs to all men for a period of
five years, as a punishment for their lies.”1188 In effect, the proclamation of
qāʿimiyya and qiyāma was “postponed” to the fifth year of the Bab’s career.
Up to that point—and possibly after it—he seems to have retained a desire to
return to Karbala, the most appropriate place for such a proclamation. This is
evidenced by a short letter written by him from prison in Mākū to Sayyid
Aḥmad Yazdī, one of the group of Babis who formed a close circle in
Karbala under the leadership of Qurrat al­ʿAyn, in which he writes: “I
beseech God that he may gladden the hearts of the believers through his
grace and make it possible for us to rise up and enter the holy land (al­arḍ
al­muqaddaṣa).”1189

With the Bab’s arrival in Shīrāz in early July 1845, it became possible
for those who remained loyal to him in Karbala either to travel to meet him
in person or to receive news of him at first hand from those who returned

from Shīrāz. A considerable movement between Karbala and Shīrāz now
began, as a result of which the Bab’s now precarious position was again
strengthened and his authority extended over what was by now developing
into a more consciously radical group of Shaykhis under the leadership of
Qurrat al­ʿAyn in Karbala. Mīrzā Hādī Nahrī and his brother Mīrzā
MuḥammadʿAlī Nahrī, who had frequently met the Bab in Karbala, had
already gone to Shīrāz while he was in Arabia, the former then returning to
the ʿatabāt, where he doubtless brought further information about the absent
Sayyid to his companions.1190 Other Shaykhis traveled between the two
towns, among them Shaykh Ṣāliḥ Karīmī, a convert of Basṭāmī’s,1191 Shaykh
Sulṭān al­Karbalāʾī,1192 Shaykh Ḥasan Zunūzī,1193 Sayyid Javād
Karbalāʾī,1194 and Āqā Sayyid ʿAbd al­Hādī Qazvīnī, who later married a
niece of Qurrat al­ʿAyn.1195

Māzandarānī states that, in 1261/1845, pilgrims returned from Mecca
to Karbala, where they mentioned the claims of the Bab, having heard of
them while taking part in the ḥajj; these individuals probably returned to
Karbala in the early months of 1845.1196 In an early prayer, the Bab gives the
names of a number of individuals whom he informed of his claims while in
Mecca; these included Sayyid ʿAlī Kirmānī, to whom we have previously
referred as the leading supporter of Karīm Khān in Karbala.1197 It appears
that Sayyid ʿAlī had, in fact, accepted the Bab’s claims for a time, following
the return of the ḥurūf al­ḥayy from Shīrāz, but that he had become nervous
when arrests began among the Babis (presumably after Basṭāmī’s arrival)
and headed for Mecca.1198 He appears to have been accompanied on the ḥajj
by Mīrzā Muḥīṭ Kirmānī and Mullā Ḥasan Gawhar, both of whom also met
the Bab in Mecca and were challenged by him there to mubāhala, or mutual
imprecation.1199 As we have noted, the Bab’s Ṣaḥīfa bayna ’l­ḥaramayn was
addressed to Sayyid ʿAlī and Mīrzā Muḥīṭ; the latter received a copy on his
return to Karbala.1200 In view of the position held by these three men in the
Shaykhi community generally and in Karbala in particular, there is no doubt
that their meeting with the Bab and their negative reaction to his claims were
important factors in shaping the views of their followers in this respect, and
may also have had an influence on the response of Karīm Khān, with whom
Sayyid ʿAlī and Mīrzā Muhīt were generally on good terms.

Writings of the Bab were also reaching Karbala in this period. As
mentioned previously, Basṭāmī carried several of these to Iraq (and the other
ḥurūf al­ḥayy may have brought some as well), and they were soon
circulating in the Karbala region. An important early manuscript collection
of works of the Bab, containing the Qayyūm­al asmāʾ, Ṣaḥīfa aʿmāl al­sana,

Ṣaḥīfa makhzūna, numerous khuṭub, ziyārāt, and prayers, was transcribed in
Karbala in mid 1262/1846 by a certain Muḥammad ʿAlī, in the Mīrzā Jaʿfar
madrasa.1201

In a letter from Karbala, dated 1263/1847, from Shaykh Sulṭan al­
Karbalāʾī to Babis in Iran, the Bab’s commentary, the Tafsīr ḥadīth al­
jāriyya, his Qayyūm al­asmāʾ, a khuṭba, and several letters are quoted in a
context which suggests that they were familiar to the Babis in Karbala.1202
Among the early writings of the Bab are five prayers addressed in direct
reply to individuals resident in Karbala1203—evidence that communication
existed between the Bab and his followers there from almost the earliest
period. We may also note that, according to al­Baghdādī, Qurrat al­ʿAyn
read portions of the Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar to the ulama in Karbala.1204

Qurrat al­ʿAyn

Leadership of the nascent Babi community at the heart of the Shiʿi world
fell, curiously enough, to the one woman nnumbered among the ḥurūf al­
ḥayy, Qurrat al­ʿAyn. Born in Qazvīn in 1814,1205 she was raised under the
tutelage of her father, Ḥājī Mullā Muḥammad Ṣāliḥ Baraghānī (1753­1854),
and her uncles Ḥājī Mullā Muḥammad Taqī Baraghānī (1752­1847—who
pronounced the takfīr against al­Ahsaʾi) and Ḥājī Mullā Muḥammad ʿAlī
Baraghānī (b. 1761) (who was a Shaykhi). Married at the age of fourteen to
Muḥammad Taqī’s son, Mullā Muḥammad Baraghānī (d. 1878), she traveled
soon afterwards with him to Karbala, where he studied for some thirteen
years.1206 Already well educated by her father and uncles, she continued to
acquire a knowledge of fiqh, kalām, and other religious sciences.

At some period, whether during this or a subsequent stay in Karbala,
she associated with the leading ulama there and eventually determined to ask
for ijāzāt from various mujtahids. It seems that, on the basis of her writings,
they admitted she was sufficiently learned to merit an ijāza, but said that it
was not customary for one to be given to a woman.1207

This was not strictly true. It was not uncommon for the daughters of
ulama to be as well educated as their sons and, indeed, to become ulama (or,
more correctly, ʿālimāt) themselves, even, in some cases, being granted
ijāzāt. The daughters of Shaykh Jaʿfar ibn Khiḍr al­Najafi Kāshif al­Ghiṭāʾ,
for example, were regarded as faqīha,1208 while Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān

Tanakābūnī states that “among the generality of women, there have been
many with ijāzāt”1209 and gives the names of several of them.1210 In the
modern period, a woman mujtahid named ʿAlawiyya attained considerable
fame in Isfahan, receiving ijāzāt from three of the leading marājiʿ al­taqlīd
of her time.1211 Significantly, many of the early female converts to Babism
were also well educated, including Qurrat al­ʿAyn’s sister Marḍiyya
Khānum (1817­1895), and the mother and sister of Mulla Ḥusayn
Bushrūʾī.1212

Whether independently or, as has been suggested, under the influence
of her maternal cousin, Mullā Javād Vilyānī,1213 or her uncle, Ḥājī Mullā
Muḥammad ʿAlī,1214 she became attracted to Shaykhism and appears to have
studied under Rashti in Karbala.1215 She seems to have returned to Qazvīn
with her husband and children in 1841,1216 but our sources are contradictory
as to her movements in the next few years. Most authorities have assumed
that she was again in Karbala when she received news of the Bab’s
appearance, possibly through Mulla ʿAlī Basṭāmī, but, in fact—as we have
noted above –—she herself clearly states in a letter to Mullā Javād Vilyānī
that she was still in Qazvīn when she first heard of young claimant. It would
seem, however, that she headed for Karbala shortly after this, and may even
have been there when Basṭāmī arrived.1217 According to the Kitāb­i nuqṭat
al­kāf, she professed “outward belief” after the perusal of some of the
writings of the Bab, possibly those brought to Karbala by Basṭāmī.1218

Qurrat al­ʿAyn’s position in Karbala was greatly enhanced by the fact
that, from the time of her arrival, she took up residence in the house of the
late Sayyid, her classes there taking the place of those given by him.1219 The
importance of thus securing for the followers of the Bab the seat of the
leadership of the Shaykhi school is stressed by Shirazi in a letter to Ḥājī
Mīrzā Ḥasan Khurāsānī, apparently written after his return from the ḥajj. In
this letter, he states that “it is incumbent on one of you to teach our verses in
the house of the previous gate of God (bāb Allāh al­muqaddam [i.e.,
Rashti]).”1220 Qurrat al­ʿAyn appears to have given three separate classes in
Rashti’s house—the first a general class open to anyone, the second for Babi
men, and the third for Babi women. Apart from this, it seems that, in
keeping with the practice of al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti, she gathered about her a
small band of elite disciples (khawwāṣ), to whom she imparted the more
recondite, gnostic elements of the Shaykhi and, as time passed, Babi
taʿlīm.1221 It was not long, indeed, before the Babis in Karbala became
divided into two groups: those who followed Qurrat al­ʿAyn and those who
refused to do so. At the beginning of a letter discussing this division, Mullā

Aḥmad ibn Ismāʿīl Khurāsānī states that there are many religious sects in
existence: there are, to begin with, Sunnis and Shiʿis; these latter are, in turn,
divided between Bālāsarīs and Shaykhis; the latter are themselves divided
into two groups—the Babis and the rest; and the Babis have also been split
into two parties—those who follow the daughter of Ṣāliḥ Qazvīnī (i.e.,
Qurrat al­ʿAyn) and the rest.1222

The composition of the group centered around Qurrat al­ʿAyn is of
some interest. Whereas those who went with Bushrūʾī or Basṭāmī to Shīrāz
were, with the exception of an Indian, Saʿīd Hindī, all Iranians, Qurrat al­
ʿAyn’s circle contained a number of Arabs from Baghdad and Karbala. This
fact is particularly important in indicating that, whatever the causes of later
dissension in the Babi community of Iraq, Arab­Iranian rivalry seems to
have played little or no part in it. Similarly, in apparent contrast to the group
which initiated the Babi movement, several of Qurrat al­ʿAyn’s supporters
were elderly members of the ulama class. Considering that the views
associated with her and her followers came to be regarded as the most
revolutionary of those held by any Babi group in the early period, there is a
strong indication here that youthful kicking against the traces of precedent
was not the only nor even the dominant element to be found in the dynamic
of the new sect in its attempt to generate a paradigm shift. In general, the
role of elderly figures in revolutionary or messianic movements has been to
mitigate to some extent the earliest extremes as the movement has begun to
move into a phase tending towards rapprochement with the established
order, whereas here we can observe a number of elderly divines consciously
going in the vanguard of the most radical departure from religious and social
norms.1223

This Karbala­based group was largely composed of ulama, most if not
all of whom had studied under Rashti and one or two under al­Ahsaʾi. Their
activities centered mostly around the classes given by Qurrat al­ʿAyn,
although there is some evidence that she herself initiated lecture groups held
by other scholars.1224 It would appear that, during her earlier stay in Karbala,
and probably in the early period of her later residence, she lectured on works
by al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti,1225 but, as time passed and more of the Bab’s works
became available, her classes eventually concentrated on them to the
exclusion of others.

Although it is clear from her letters that she persisted in intellectual
debate to the end of her life, various accounts indicate that her lecturing
became more and more akin to preaching and that her preaching became
increasingly impassioned. At her more popular classes, as distinct from

those limited to the elite circle of scholars and close initiates to whom we
have referred, her fervor and eloquence won her large audiences and created
a stir wherever she went.1226 These preaching activities, with their ever­
heightening air of tension and messianic expectancy, were ultimately
responsible for much of the public outcry against her that led, in the end, to
her expulsion from Iraq in 1847; but it was in the course of her more
specialized classes and her discussions with other Babi intellectuals that the
ideas voiced to a wider audience were initially formulated and the startling
conclusions she drew from the Bab’s writings reached.

The Shaykhi Reaction to the Babi Daʿwa

Relations between the Babis, especially the “Qurratiyya” branch, and the
rest of the Shaykhi community in Karbala became progressively worse. It
appears that, at some point, Mullā Ḥasan Gawhar claimed wiṣāya and Mīrzā
Muḥīṭ Kirmānī niẓāra,1227 implying some form of succession to Rashti and a
degree of authority over the school. Mīrzā Muḥīṭ seems to have vacillated
between making a claim to personal leadership and giving support to Karīm
Khān, for whom he probably acted as an agent in Karbala; but his attitude
towards Babism appears to have remained negative.1228 Mullā Ḥasan
retained the greatest influence among the non­Babi Shaykhis and followed
Rashti’s policy of fostering ties with the governor of Karbala.1229 His
relations with Qurrat al­ʿAyn and her followers were particularly bad;
having fallen into a serious disagreement with her during a visit to
Kāẓimiyya,1230 he preached against her and her circle in his own class and
those of Mīrzā Muḥīṭ,1231 and was active in making complaints against her to
the authorities in Baghdad and Istanbul, as a result of which she was held
under house arrest in the former city and finally expelled from Iraq in the
spring of 1847.1232 Relations between the Shaykhi groups in Karbala were
complicated by Karīm Khān Kirmānī’s unfavorable reaction to the Bab.

As far as can be determined, Mullā Íādiq Khurāsānī, an elderly
Shaykhi who had studied under Rashti, was the first Babi to communicate
the claims of Sayyid ʿAlī Muḥammad to Karīm Khān. Converted by
Bushrūʾī in the course of the latter’s visit to Isfahan in mid­1844, Khurāsānī
headed for Kirman,1233 carrying with him, in the words of Karīm Khān, “a
number of suras in the style of the Qurʾan, a number of books in the style of
the Ṣaḥīfa al­Sājjādiya, and several khuṭub in the style of the Nahj al­
balāgha.”1234 The “suras” in question were a number of chapters from the

Qayyūm al­asmāʾ, as is clear from those parts of them quoted by Karīm
Khān in several of his works. Mullā Ṣādiq was, according to Kirmānī,
brought to a meeting presided over by him, defeated in argument, and sent
on his way.1235

Khurāsānī was followed to Kirman after some time by Mullā
Muḥammad ʿAlī Bārfurūshī, probably the best acquainted of all the Bab’s
followers with his teachings at this stage. Bārfurūshī brought with him a
letter for Kirmānī in the Bab’s own hand, and succeeded in delivering it to
him before being expelled like his predecessor;1236 the letter in question is
quoted in full by Kirmānī in al­Shihāb al­thāqib.1237 Mullā Ṣādiq and Mullā
Muḥammad ʿAlī were, according to Kirmānī, the only Babis he ever met.1238
However, in his final attack on the Bab (written in 1283/1867), he refers to
and quotes from the Bayān­i Fārsī, and gives detailed references to what
would seem to be the Arabic Bayān,1239 evidence that, even if he did not
have further direct contact with Babis, he was at least able to obtain their
literature.

In 1845, Karīm Khān was aged thirty­five and was at the height of his
powers. As we have indicated previously, he was already a firm claimant to
the position of supreme leader of the Shaykhi school. Between 1247/1832,
the date of his first extant risāla, and 1260/1844, he had written a total of
twenty works, principally untitled treatises. From about 1844, his output
began to increase markedly, a minimum of ninety­five titles being produced
between that date and 1270/1854. These included important works such as
the Irshād al­ʿawāmm (written in four parts between 1263/1847 and
1267/1851), the Risāla­yi hidāyat al­ṭālibīn (1261/1845), the Jawāmiʿ al­
ʿallāj (1269/1853), and the Rujūm al­shayāṭīn (1268/1852).

It is hardly surprising, then, that Karīm Khān’s response to the Bab’s
claims took the form of a series of refutations in Arabic and Persian, which
were spread widely—to Shaykhis in particular. Māzandarānī maintains that
Kirmānī attacked the Bab in no less than twelve of his works, although he
fails to give all but a few of their titles.1240 Kirmānī himself writes in his
Risāla­yi ṣī faṣl (1269/1853):

> I have written five or six books in refutation of him [i.e., the
> Bab], and have sent them to different parts of Azerbaijan,
> Persian Iraq, Arab Iraq, Hejaz, Khurāsān, and India. I have also
> written letters to the ulama and sent petitions to officials of the
> various governments. At times in Yazd and Kirman, and on a

journey to Khurāsān, I have made clear their unbelief from
pulpits, with proof and evidences.1241

Of these “five or six books,” only three are actually known: Izhāq al­bāṭil
(1261/1845); Risāla­yi tīr­i shihāb (1262/1846); and al­Shihāb al­thāqib
(1265­1849). A fourth complete work in refutation of the Bab, the Risāla
dar radd­i Bab­i murtād, was written by Kirmānī at the request of Nāṣir al­
Dīn Shāh in 1283/1867.

Karīm Khān’s numerous and often complex objections to the claims
of the Bab are, perhaps, best summarized in his own list of ten items in the
Bab’s teachings (as found in his early writings) which he identifies as
opposed to Islam, some of them being regarded as bidʿa. These are listed in
the Risāla­yi tīr­i shihāb as follows:1242

> 1. The claim of wahy after that of Muḥammad.
> 2. The claim to bring a new book after the Qurʾan.

3. Legitimization of jihād, which is illegitimate in the time of the
ghayba.

> 4. The prohibition on writing his books in black ink, and the
> requirement to write them in colored ink.

5. The promulgation of claims regarded as the prerogatives of the
Prophet      and Imāms.

> 6. The decree that his name be mentioned in the adhān.
> 7. The claim to niyāba khāṣṣa.

8. The decree that all must obey him, and that whoever refuses to do
so is a kāfir.

9. The claim that all must worship him and regard him as the qibla
and masjid.

> 10. Deceits relating to the twelfth Imām [apparently in respect of
> prophecies relating to his advent, or the claim to have revelation from
> him].

On the basis of such points, Kirmānī declares the Bab a kāfir, maintaining
that “our God is not his God, our Prophet is not his Prophet, and our Imām is
not his Imām.”1243

The fierceness of Kirmānī’s attacks and his outright condemnation of
the Bab as a kāfir, whose claims and teachings were bidʿa, immediately
polarized the Shaykhi community. For the Babis, Karīm Khān became the
embodiment of opposition to their cause: in the writings of the Bab, he

appears to be identified with “the first to disbelieve” (corresponding
negatively to Bushrūʾī, “the first to believe”), the “Tree of Negation,” and
the “Embodiment of Hellfire,” whose abode is “the Land of Fire” and whose
food is “the Tree of Zaqqūm”.1244 Al­Karbalā’ī draws a comparison between
Kirmānī and the Umayyads, the Sufyanids (those of the Umayyad rulers
descended from Abū Sufyān), the followers of Muʿāwiyya, and the first
Umayyad caliph Muʿāwiyya ibn Abī Sufyān (r. 661­680),1245 while Zarandī
speaks of him as the “Antichrist” (Dajjāl?) of the Babi revelation.1246
Elsewhere, Mīrzā Muḥammad ʿAlī Zunūzī, identifying Ḥājī Mīrzā Āqāsī as
Dajjāl, refers to Kirmani as “the manifestation of Sufiyān” (ẓuhūr­i
Sufyānī).1247 When copies of Izhāq al­bāṭil reached Karbala, both Qurrat al­
ʿAyn and al­Qatīl ibn al Karbalāʾī wrote counter­polemics against it.1248
Sayyid ʿAlī Kirmānī and Mīrzā Muḥīṭ were informed of Qurrat al­ʿAyn’s
refutation of Karīm Khān1249 and, as a result, relations between them and her
appear to have further deteriorated.

Equally serious in the effect on Babi/orthodox Shaykhi relations in
Karbala was the defection to Karīm Khān of Mullā Javād Vilyānī, Qurrat al­
ʿAyn’s maternal cousin, who had, for a time, been a convert to Babism but
apostatized after meeting the Bab in Shīrāz. One of the first in Qazvīn to
acknowledge the Bab as the new Shaykhi leader, he had been one of those
awaiting his arrival in Karbala in 1845.1250 Disappointed by the Bab’s failure
to appear, he traveled to Shīrāz with a group of fellow­Shaykhis, including
Mullā ʿAbd al­ʿAlī Harātī and Mīrzā Ibrāhīm Shīrāzī. Within a short time of
their arrival in Shīrāz, Mullā Javād and these two companions came into
conflict with the Bab and his other followers there, including Mullā Ḥusayn
Bushrūʾī.1251 Serious disagreements seem to have occurred, in the course of
which these three men were expelled from the community of believers and
allied themselves in some way with the Bab’s enemies in the city. This
schism appears to have led to the outbreak of disturbances of some kind
between Babis and non­Babis, resulting in the expulsion from Shīrāz of
Mullā Javād and his companions by the civil authorities.1252 It is not clear
why these men rather than the Bab’s other newly­arrived disciples, defying a
ban on meeting with their magister spiritualis, should have been expelled.

Having by now rejected the Bab as a legitimate successor to Rashti,
Vilyānī and his fellow­recusants made for Kirman, where they joined forces
with Karīm Khān. In Kirman, Vilyānī appears to have adopted the role of
spokesman on behalf of Kirmānī and to have written letters in support of his
claims to various individuals, as is indicated by al­Karbalāʾī, who refers to
Vilyānī as Kirmānī’s “herald” (munād).1253 The secession of three followers

of the Bab and the transfer of their allegiance to himself was without a doubt
a valuable factor in enhancing Kirmānī’s reputation at this critical juncture.
Undoubtedly, too, these men were able to supply him with very much of the
fresh information which he incorporated into his second and third attacks on
the Bab. Two untitled treatises in refutation of the latter were, in fact written
by Karīm Khān in reply to questions from Vilyānī.1254 The latter returned
after some time to Qazvīn, where he himself is reported as having written a
polemic against the Bab, the text of which does not, unfortunately, seem to
have survived.1255

The Bab, for his part, regarded this act of apostasy on the part of
Mullā Javād, Mullā ʿAbd al­ʿAlī, and Mīrzā Ibrāhīm, as a serious setback,
and wrote at length and in very strong terms deprecating their actions. In a
letter written in Shīrāz, probably not long after these events, he states that

> the worst thing which has befallen me is the action of Khuwār
> al­Vilyānī [i.e., Mullā Javād] in his injustice to me; at the time
> when I was writing the decree of his expulsion, it was as if I
> heard one calling within my heart ‘Sacrifice the most beloved of
> all things unto you, even as Ḥusayn made sacrifices in my
> path’.1256

In another letter, quoted by Zarandī, he refers to Mullā Javād and Mullā
ʿAbd al­ʿAlī as “the Jibt and Tāghūt, the twin idols of this perverse people
[the Shaykhis?],”1257 while elsewhere he speaks of them and Mīrzā Ibrāhīm
as “the Golden Calf, and its body and its lowing.”1258 Vilyānī, in particular,
is often referred to in Babi and Bahaʾi literature as “khuwār”, the “lowing”
of the Golden Calf.1259 The opening passage of the Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar,
written not long after these events in Shīrāz, makes lengthy and pained
reference to the infidelity of these three men.1260

Mullā Javād’s rejection of the Bab and his expulsion from the ranks of
his followers had repercussions in Karbala. He himself wrote a letter to
Qurrat al­ʿAyn, evoking an impassioned and, at times, severe reply from her,
addressed to him, Mullā ʿAbd al­ʿAlī and “others”.1261 Written in
1261/1845, this would seem to be the earliest dated work of Qurrat al­
ʿAyn’s which we possess. It contains fairly detailed references to the content
of Vilyānī’s original letter, outlining the nature of his objections before
proceeding to refute them. Among the points raised by Mullā Javād were:
the Bab’s failure to appear in Karbala,1262 the difficulty for most people in
reading the Arabic writings of the Bab,1263 his acceptance of parts of the

Bab’s writings but not others,1264 the possibility that God may establish the
truth in a person or place not fit to receive it,1265 his own claim to have
written a “Qurʾan” more eloquent and complete than the Bab’s tafsīr [i.e.,
the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ],1266 the confusion of the language of the latter
work,1267 and the station accorded Mullā Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī by the Bab.1268

Taken together, the arguments raised by Vilyānī—most of which are
of little consequence in isolation—indicate a general attitude which seems to
lie at the root of his eventual abandonment of the Bab. Already shaken in his
convictions by the latter’s failure to appear in Karbala as he had promised,
Mullā Javād had clearly headed for Shīrāz with the express intention of
engaging in mubāhala with him; a major factor in his eventual
disenchantment with and rejection of the Bab was certainly the latter’s
reaction to his attempt to put his claims to the proof.

Mubāhala was common at this period, and the Bab not only engaged
in it himself, but instructed several of his followers to do so on his behalf, or
else approved of their doing so.1269 In this case, however, the Bab regarded
such a challenge as unacceptable and even improper. In a prayer written
after Vilyānī’s departure from Shīrāz, he writes:

> Know that Javād Qazvīnī has written in his letter in Persian,
> which he wrote with the images of hell, vain words, among
> which were those in which he sought to put our proof to the
> test… In his letter, he has challenged me to mubāhala, thus
> making a liar of himself—for it is as if he had not read in the
> book of God that mubāhala is my decree and my sign, and that
> he has no authority to issue a challenge to it.1270

The point at issue is that of the station to be accorded the Bab. In
declaring himself to be the sole source of divine guidance then on earth—
whatever the precise nature of his claim—the Bab demanded a degree of
non­rational obedience which Mullā Javād and other Shaykhis seem to have
been unwilling to give. The history of Babism up to 1848 is marked by a
high measure of tension between the cautious intellectualizing of the large
numbers of Shaykhi Babis who became more and more disillusioned and
abandoned the Bab in greater and greater numbers as his doctrines and
injunctions jarred increasingly with established theory, and the unthinking
dedication of bands of saints and fanatics who argued, fought, and were, in
the end all but wiped out for a cause they often understood little of. There is,
in many respects, a useful analogy here with the epistemological stance of

the Nizārī Ismailis of Ḥasan Ṣabbāḥ and his successors, in which reason is
abandoned in favor of existential recognition of the Imām as the only source
of truth and guidance.1271

The emphasis which the Bab placed on observance of the Islamic laws
and his references to his station as being below that of the Imām, attracted
much of that section of the Shaykhi community which sought for a formal
continuation of the leadership provided by al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti in the
context of a rigid adherence to Islamic practice and veneration for the
Imāms, thereby tending towards the routinization of charisma within the
school.

On the other hand, it soon became apparent to some individuals that,
even at this stage, there existed in the claims and ideas of the Bab elements
which were clearly in a state of tension with his apparently normative and
traditionalist injunctions. There thus emerged a group which, although
initially amenable to the claims explicit or implicit in the Bab’s writings,
persisted in judging those claims in terms of existing theology. When the
Bab seemed to jettison much of the theory on which their judgments were
based, the ideological edifice of their faith appeared to collapse for such
individuals.

Mullā Javād seems to have been one of the first (probably a little after
Sayyid ʿAlī Kirmānī) to detect an incongruity between the Bab’s claims and
the modes in which he actually proposed to establish them. Thus, the Bab’s
writings did not conform to the established criteria of Quranic style or
grammar, his answers to questions appeared to function outside the
framework of normal question­answer relationships, even of accepted
epistemological approaches, and his most favored disciples seemed to be
ascribed roles alien to the established religious roles available to the ulama.
Joining Karīm Khān, who sought to approximate Shaykhi doctrine more and
more closely to the established norms of Twelver Shiʿism, he was able to
find in the books of his new shaykh a consistency between claims and
criteria which he had not found in the writings of the Bab.

By contrast, Qurrat al­ʿAyn, as is clear from her letter to Vilyānī, had
both seen the implications of the Bab’s claims and ideas and found them
consonant with her own attitudes. Where Vilyānī saw only purposeless
contradictions, she seems to have apprehended a dialectical process. Where
he appears to have wanted to see in Sayyid ʿAlī Muḥammad a third bāb
succeeding to and, to some extent, continuing the charisma of al­Ahsaʾi and
Rashti, she, while speaking of these latter as “ the two previous gates,”1272
nevertheless saw in the role of the Bab a distinct break with the charismatic

modes of Shaykhism and a thrust in a wholly new direction, into a new
“universe of discourse”. In her letter to Vilyānī, she quotes Rashti as having
said near his death that he was “but as a herald (mubashshir) for that great
cause.”1273

Elsewhere in the course of her reply to Mullā Javād, Qurrat al­ʿAyn
cites a tradition of Imam Jaʿfar al­Ṣādiq, to the effect that waḥy could be
given to someone other than the Prophet, and this is a context referring to the
Qā’im himself.1274 That she regarded the writings of the Bab as inspired in
such a manner seems clear from her numerous comparisons between them
and the Qurʾan, and her quotation of a passage from the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ,
which declares that “my proof is this book from God.”1275

It is likewise clear from several of her references to the Bab that she
looked on him, if not as a prophet or imām, certainly as the possessor of a
most exalted spiritual station. In various places in her letter, she refers to him
as “the central Point of the Circle of Existence,”1276 and “the Lord of Lords,
Manifestation of the grace and loving­kindness of the King of
Beneficence.”1277 These titles do not seem to refer to any particular station
for the Bab, such as qāʾimiyya, and they certainly do not provide grounds for
believing that Qurrat al­ʿAyn thought of him at this point as the promised
Imām himself. But such titles, coupled with the general tone of profound
respect with which she refers to the Bab in this letter, indicate a
preparedness on her part to accept as valid any role which he might assign to
himself in the future.

Division Within the Babi Community

Vilyānī’s defection must have caused profound anxiety to the Babi enclave
in Karbala, where the issue of relations between Shaykhism and Babism was
most sharply felt. More serious, however, were the problems raised in the
course of a violent split among the Babis, involving Qurrat al­ʿAyn and her
supporters on the one hand and Mullā Aḥmad Khurāsānī and his followers
on the other. Although communications between the Bab and his devotees
were never entirely severed, contact did, at times, become difficult, and it
was, in any case, impossible to refer to him any and every question for
elucidation or arbitration. For this reason, Mullā Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī was
empowered by the Babi prophet to reply to questions and issue challenges to
mubāhala on his behalf.1278

However, the task of exposition of Babi doctrines in a number of
provincial centers fell increasingly on the leading followers of the Bab in
those areas: in Mashhad, Mullā Muḥammad ʿAlī Bārfurūshī assisted
Bushrūʾī in this task;1279 in Burūjird, Kurdistan, Tehran, Qazvīn, Isfahan,
Qum, and elsewhere, the peripatetic Sayyid Yaḥyā Dārābī taught and
expounded the new daʿwa;1280 in Tehran, Mullā Muḥammad ʿAlī Zanjānī,
despite restrictions placed on him there by the civil authorities, was able to
give advice to his fellow­Babis;1281 and, in Qazvīn, Mullā Jalīl Urūmī gave
classes in Babi doctrine on the Bab’s personal instructions.1282

Qurrat al­ʿAyn’s role as a center of authority for the Babis of Karbala
was confirmed by the Bab himself in more than one letter,1283 but it was
inevitable that her performance of this function should excite suspicion and
hostility in some quarters. Whereas Vilyānī and his companions rejected the
Bab and his doctrines as such, and thereby separated themselves from the
Babi community, Mullā Aḥmad and his supporters maintained adamantly
that their opposition to Qurrat al­ʿAyn was based on a desire to purify the
faith of the Bab from the false interpretations and harmful innovations which
she was introducing into it. Unlike the defection of Vilyānī, therefore, this
disagreement resulted in an actual division within Babism, rather than a
retraction from it.

Mullā Aḥmad Khurāsānī (also known as Muʿallim­i Ḥisārī)1284 was a
mujtahid from Nāmiq near Turshīz, who had undertaken the task of teaching
the children of Rashti. Informed of the Bab’s claims in a letter from
Bushrūʾī, he had become one of his earliest followers in Karbala. He spent
some time after his conversion in Khurāsān, where he became better
acquainted with Bushrūʾī, but decided, in the end, that his place was in Iraq
and so returned to Karbala, possibly early in 1262/1846.

During his absence, however, Qurrat al­ʿAyn and others had risen to
prominence in the community there, and friction began to develop between
them and Mullā Aḥmad around Ramadan 1262/September 1846. Shaykh
Sulṭān al­Karbalāʾī describes an altercation on 23 Ramadan/13 September
between Mullā Aḥmad and Mullā Bāqir Tabrizī over the question of
smoking, which the former did not regard as prohibited. Qurrat al­ʿAyn and
Rashti’s widow (whom she had converted) were drawn into the dispute and
from petty beginnings the matter grew into a serious argument.1285

Khurāsānī himself, in his version of the disagreement, makes no
reference whatever to the smoking incident, and instead locates the origins
of the dispute between him and Qurrat al­ʿAyn in a much less trivial debate

concerning her position and that of Mullā Bāqir. According to Khurāsānī,
Mullā Bāqir interpreted a letter from the Bab in praise of Qurrat al­ʿAyn as
evidence that the Babis should gather about her and, despite his protests,
proceeded to assemble a group of men in support of her, including Shaykh
Sulṭān al­Karbalāʾī, Shaykh Ṣāliḥ Karīmī, and Mīrzā Hādī Nahrī. Khurāsānī
continued to protest and, in the end was condemned for his pains as an
unbeliever and forbidden either to lecture to the believers or to teach the
children (presumably those of Rashti). Qurrat al­ʿAyn, for her part, decreed
that whatever might be said by Mullā Bāqir should be regarded as true and
accepted by all.1286

Khurāsānī sought support for his views, writing letters to a number of
individuals, including the Bab (by then probably in Isfahan), Mullā Shaykh
ʿAlī Turshīzī in Shīrāz, Sayyid Ḥusayn Yazdī in Isfahan, and Sayyid ʿAlī
[Shubbar?] in Kāẓimiyya.1287 According to Mullā Aḥmad, replies were
received from both the Bab and Sayyid Ḥusayn Yazdī in condemnation of
the words and behavior of his opponents—but these were not specific
refutations of Qurrat al­ʿAyn or Mullā Bāqir, since he had not referred to
them by name in his original letters.1288

The disagreement soon developed doctrinal justifications and
elaborations. Wardī mentions several points of doctrinal difference,
including two which are not referred to elsewhere. The first of these is that
Mullā Aḥmad regarded the works of al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti as immortal and
continued reading from them (and presumably, lecturing from them). Qurrat
al­ʿAyn and her followers, on the other hand, looked on these works as
abrogated by the Bab.1289 Although, as we shall see, the Bab did at a later
date specifically forbid his followers to read the works of al­Ahsaʾi or Rashti
or to sit with their followers, the only passage known to me in his early
writings which might be interpreted this way is his general statement in the
Qayyūm al­asmāʾ that all the books of the past, except those from God, had
been abrogated.1290 That Qurrat al­ʿAyn and her supporters may have drawn
a more specific conclusion with regard to the works of the founders of
Shaykhism is a fact of no little moment.

The other point mentioned by Wardī is that Qurrat al­ʿAyn was said to
have forbidden mourning for the Imām Ḥusayn or the performance of ziyāra
to the shrines of the Imāms, on the grounds that there is no real meaning in
references to the “thirst” or “death” of Ḥusayn.1291 If this be true, she was
clearly opposed here to the Bab’s own teaching.1292

Her position was, however, much enhanced at this juncture by the
arrival of several letters from the Bab, in which he spoke of her in terms of
the highest praise and approbation.1293 Strengthened in her position by
statements in her favor from such a source, Qurrat al­ʿAyn continued to
emphasize the significance of the role of the ḥurūf al­ḥayy as the sābiqūn
who had recognized the Bab before all others. Mullā Aḥmad and his
companions—for he seems to have acquired a following of his own by this
stage—objected vigorously to what they regarded as unwarranted
interpretations by her of certain passages in the Bab’s writings referring to
the sābiqūn, while their opponents countered with various quotations of a
more explicit nature.1294 Khurāsānī went on to allege that his rivals believed
“that the remembrance (al­dhikr) [i.e., the Bab], is a lord apart from God,
and his gate and the first to believe in him, Mullā Ḥusayn is Muḥammad ibn
ʿAbd Allāh [i.e., the Prophet], and the second to believe in him, Mullā ʿAlī,
is ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, and Qurrat al­ʿAyn is the reality of Fāṭima, and the
remaining eleven [sic] sābiqūn are the other Imāms, and the Shaykh and the
Sayyid [i.e. al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti] were created from the surplus matter of
the bodies of the sābiqūn.”1295 A meeting was called in Rashti’s house
(where Khurāsānī also seems to have lived) in order to resolve this particular
issue, attended by Mullā Aḥmad and several of his companions.

The matter appears to have remained unresolved, however; both sides
stayed intransigent and tension continued as before. Shaykh Sulṭān refers to
the accusations of Khurāsānī regarding the claims made for the sābiqūn as
mere “falsehoods”.1296 As we have already noted, however, the Bab himself
did teach that the ḥurūf al­ḥayy where identical with the Prophet, Imāms,
abwābs, and Fāṭima, and there seems little doubt that this doctrine was being
promulgated in some form by the group around Qurrat al­ʿAyn and Mullā
Bāqir.

The former in particular appears to have been the object of great
veneration in this respect, becoming the center of a cult in which she was
regarded as “the fair and spotless emblem of chastity and the incarnation of
the holy Fatima.”1297 The Kitāb­i nuqṭat al­kāf describes the origins of this
veneration as follows: originally, the followers of Qurrat al­ʿAyn practiced
extremely severe forms of asceticism; they would not eat bread bought from
the bazaar because they regarded it as unclean, inasmuch as anyone who
rejected the Bab thereby rejected the Prophet and, in so doing, rejected
God1298 (that is, they became kuffār, whose persons and property were
considered najis).

This situation continued until the Bab’s Risāla furūʿ al­ʿAdliyya
reached Karbala. Here it was stated that the glances of Fāṭima and the
Imāms (āl Allāh) were among the agents whereby impure and forbidden
(ḥarām) materials could be rendered lawful (ḥalāl).1299 When she read this,
Qurrat al­ʿAyn claimed to be “the manifestation of Fāṭima (maẓhar­i jināb­i
Fāṭima)” and said that “the glance of my eye has the same effect as that of
hers, and whatever I cast my gaze upon shall be made pure.” She then
instructed her companions to bring whatever they bought in the bazaar for
her to render ḥalāl.1300 According to Māzandarānī, she was also regarded by
some as “the point of divine knowledge” after Rashti.1301 It is not, perhaps,
surprising that, according to ʿAbbās Effendi she claimed to be divine in the
course of the Babi conclave held at Badasht in Mazandaran in 1848.1302

Despite attempts by Qurrat al­ʿAyn to defuse the tension within the
Babi community by calling on her partisans to tone down their remarks
about her,1303 and to placate Mullā Aḥmad in person,1304 no lasting
rapprochement was possible. The Bab himself remained eager to effect a
reconciliation even at the cost of some doctrinal blurring. In general, it
seems that, although he disapproved of the behavior of Khurāsānī and was
strongly in favor of Qurrat al­ʿAyn, he deprecated antagonism on either side,
instructed the followers of Qurrat al­ʿAyn to avoid attacking Mullā Aḥmad,
and instructed all involved to remain united in spite of their disagreements.
In a letter from prison in Mākū, he writes:

> I have read your letter and informed myself of what you
> mentioned in it. I had heard from your companion about the
> dissension in the holy land [Karbala]…. Know that the sābiqūn,
> so long as they do not have doubts or misgivings in their own
> affair, have been chosen for that honor above all others. But
> neither their words nor their actions are proof for anyone—
> rather, in this day the proof is but one individual [i.e., the Bab
> himself]. Even if there servants enter the faith of God who leave
> them behind in knowledge or deeds, yet that honor is theirs
> from God and nobody may rival them in that. No one has the
> right to reject them, as long as he does not see them commit
> what would be contrary to the faith. This is the measure of
> justice in what concerns them.
> Nor do any of those who arrive from the house of justice [i.e.,
> the house of Rashti] have the right to condemn the pure one (al­
> ṭāhira) [i.e., Qurrat al­ʿAyn] in respect of her learning, for she

has understood the [various] aspects of the cause through the
> grace of God. In this day, she is an honor to this sect, and
> whoever wrongs her in the faith will commit a manifest sin.
> The same goes for those who have followed her—none of them
> has the right to reject Aḥmad in the house of justice, for he has
> understood our message in the verses of justice; though I am
> aware that he has committed a clear iniquity in this
> disagreement, I won’t reveal it in this letter or speak of it, so
> they can return to what they were commanded and no­one may
> condemn anyone else.1305

In a letter to Mullā Aḥmad himself, the Bab speaks favorably of Qurrat al­
ʿAyn, defends her from the charge of having denied the identity between
outward and inward realities, and goes on:

> As for what you have asked about the pure leaf, concerning the
> fact that she has claimed for herself the station of being a proof
> for others—there’s nothing dreadful or serious about this, since
> laudable meanings can be attributed to “being a proof”…. She
> has recognized the aspects of my decree and has pondered on
> the lights shining from my verses. Let none of my followers
> repudiate her, for she only speaks with evidences that have
> shone forth from the people of sinlessness [i.e., the Imāms] and
> tokens that have radiated from the people of truth. This is
> enough for her as an honor among this sect. 1306

We can see, then, that in spite of serious accusations on the one hand
and excessive adulation on the other, Qurrat al­ʿAyn appears to have
succeeded in steering a middle course which evoked a favorable reaction
from the Bab and preserved her position in the Babi hierarchy as a leading
exponent of the new doctrines. As far as it is accurate at this stage to speak
of such a thing, we may consider her a representative of the orthodox
mainstream of Babi thought, even if her expression of that thought was to
prove at times controversial even to other exponents of it.

Her insistence on turning to the Bab for guidance or on referring to his
writings for information on doctrine and practice was to prove a valuable
unifying factor in a religious movement which had expanded numerically
more rapidly than its tenets had been expounded or published abroad. The
Bab not yet attempted to systematize his theories. Changes in doctrinal

emphasis which occurred from time to time as his claims developed in
complexity or as circumstances demanded caution in their exposition,
combined with a serious lack of manuscript copies of even his major
writings and the existence of incorrectly copied versions of some of them, all
led to a degree of doctrinal confusion in the widely­scattered Babi
communities. This confusion became particularly marked in the period
following the Bab’s execution in 1850. In this context, it was inevitable that
there should be clashes both of personality and opinion, particularly where
someone as outspoken and impatient of contradiction as Qurrat al­ʿAyn was
concerned. There is little doubt but that, in the end, she would have carried
the day with the Babis in Karbala in her struggle with Mullā Aḥmad; but
other events intervened before a final and decisive clash could take place.1307

First Steps Towards the Abrogation of the Islamic Sharīʿa

Qurrat al­ʿAyn was by now making unequivocal claims for the Bab as
the bearer of a divine mission expanding and fulfilling that of al­Ahsaʾi and
Rashti, and as the immediate precursor of the Imām, while asserting the no­
one could be saved unless he believed in him.1308

Such a position could not but be extremely embarrassing to the non­
Babi Shaykhi leadership in Karbala, especially Mullā Ḥasan Gawhar and
Muḥīṭ Kirmānī. Many of the points advanced by Qurrat al­ʿAyn in evidence
of the claims of the Bab—such as the identity of station between prophet and
Imām or the divine inspiration of the Bab’s writings1309—were among those
adduced by Karīm Khān in his refutation of him. Although the orthodox
Shaykhi community of Iraq does not seem to have been unduly hostile to the
Babis in the early period, the growing prestige and influence of Karīm Khān
and his demand to be recognized as overall head of the sect made it
necessary for them to clarify their position vis­à­vis the followers of a man
whom he had categorically condemned as a heretic. This final break with
Shaykhism was to be given a sharp impetus by a serious worsening of
relations between Qurrat al­ʿAyn and the Shiʿi community at large.

Mullā Aḥmad Khurāsānī states that, during the period of his
disagreement with Qurrat al­ʿAyn, she became increasingly well­known to
the population of Karbala and that, after some time, certain people became
so disturbed by her behavior that they went to the governor, to whom they
complained that she was an unbeliever (kāfira).1310 The Nuqṭat al­kāf

suggests that it was her behavior in rendering food from the bazaar lawful
which excited the suspicions of the populace.1311

It is also likely that the strife between her party and that of Mullā
Aḥmad, as well as the increasing hostility between her and the Shaykhi
leadership, may have given cause for concern in a city already seriously
divided by factional disputes of various kinds. In a letter written shortly after
her arrival in Baghdad, following her departure from Karbala around the
beginning of 1847, she complains that her enemies had condemned her
followers and issued a fatwā of takfīr, and that the outcry produced had
reached the ears of the “unbelievers” (presumably the Shiʿi populace as a
whole).1312

But at the root of her trouble with the Shiʿi population lay Qurrat al­
ʿAyn’s crucial decision to abrogate part or all of Islamic law, possibly as a
preparation for the introduction of innovations to be recommended by the
Bab.

At the beginning of the daʿwa, he had insisted on full observance of
the sharī’a. Thus, for example, he writes in the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ that “God
has made the laws of Muḥammad and his awliyāʾ [i.e., the Imāms] binding
in every book until the resurrection.”1313 He himself confirms in his later
Dalāʾil­i sabʿa that it was his intention in the Qayyūm al­asmāʾ to
“command observance of the law of the Qurʾan, so that men might not be
disturbed by a new book and a new cause.”1314 In the Saḥīfa­yi ʿAdliyya, he
states that

> since no change may be decreed for [the faith of God], this
> blessed sharīʿa shall never be abrogated. Nay, what
> Muḥammad has declared lawful (ḥalāl Muḥammadin) shall
> remain lawful to the day of the resurrection, and what he has
> declared unlawful (ḥarām Muḥammadin) shall remain unlawful
> until the day of resurrection.”1315

This same point regarding the inviolability of the ḥalāl and ḥarām of
Muḥammad was made publicly by the Bab in the course of a khuṭba
[sermon] delivered by him in the Vakīl mosque of Shīrāz in 1845,1316 and in
the contemporary Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar.1317 In this latter work, the Bab
describes himself as “the servant of God confirming what you possess of the
injunctions of the Qurʾan”1318 and declares that “it is incumbent on all to act
in accordance with it [the Qurʾan]; whoever rejects a word of it has
disbelieved in the prophets and messengers and shall have his punishment in

the fire of hell.”1319 Similarly, in an early letter to Qurrat al­ʿAyn, he writes,
“rest assured that all the externals of the sharīʿa are observed. Whoever
neglects the least of its laws, it shall be as if he has neglected all of
them.”1320 In a letter written as late as his stay in Isfahan he maintains that “I
have not instructed anyone save [to observe] the laws of the Qurʾan.”1321

In general, the Bab sought to clarify obscure or tangled issues related
to the details of the sharīʿa. In the Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar, he refers to the
inability of the ulama to give correct judgments on furūʿ,1322 and, in the
Qayyūm al­asmāʾ, states that he has clarified certain laws over which there
had been disagreement.1323 The Risāla furūʿ al­ʿAdlīyya is, as we have
noted, a systematic attempt to set out in detail the finer points of observance
relating to certain major aspects of the sharīʿa, such as ṣalāt, zakāt, and
jihād. Beyond this, however, he introduced a number of ordinances which
extended and intensified the standard Qurʾanic regulations. Thus, for
example, he prohibited smoking in the Khaṣāʾil­i sabʿa and recommended
supererogatory prayer and fasting in the Ṣaḥīfa bayna ’l­ḥaramayn. Mīrzā
Muḥammad ʿAlī Zunūzī1324 writes that, in his early letters, the Bab

> put desirable matters (mustaḥabbāt) in the place of obligatory
> (wājibāt), and undesirable matters (makrūhāt) in the place of
> forbidden (muḥarramāt). Thus, for example, he regarded it as
> obligatory to have four tablets (muḥr) of the soil [from the
> shrine] of the prince of martyrs [i.e., Imām Ḥusayn] on which to
> place the hands forehead and nose during the prostration of
> namāz; he considered the pilgrimage on ʿĀshūrā a duty; he laid
> down prayers (adīʿa) and supererogatory observances
> (taʿqībāt); he proclaimed the obligation of Friday prayer…; and
> he fashioned amulets (hayākil), charms (aḥrāz), and talismans
> (tilismāt) such as are prepared among the people1325…. All his
> companions acted with the most circumspection according to
> the usūl and furū of Islam.1326

The early followers of the Babi movement appear to have been as
noted for the strictness of their observance of Islamic law as they were later
to be characterized for their abandonment of it; in this respect they
significantly resemble the pre­qiyāma Niẓārī Ismailis.1327 Ḥājī Muḥammad
Muʿīn al­Salṭana Tabrizī quotes several individuals, including Ḥājī Aḥmad
Mīlānī and Mullā Bāqir Tabrizī, on the attitude of the Babis at this period to
the Islamic sharīʿa. Mīlānī, for example, performed a fast of three

consecutive months during Rajab, Shaʿbān and Ramaḍān. Similarly, they
would not wear black clothes because the Imāms had forbidden this color as
belonging to the ʿAbbāsid dynasty, which had persecuted them. For this
same reason, even the writing of books in black ink was prohibited (red or
gold ink normally being used instead); the Bab himself wrote in red ink
before the composition of the Bayān­i Fārsī.1328

In many of her early letters, Qurrat al­ʿAyn herself emphasized that
“this is the traditional way (sunna) of God, which was in the past and shall
be in the future. You shall find no change in the sunna of God.”1329
Innovative in her interpretation of Islamic doctrine as she may have been, it
was as a staunch defender of Shiʿi orthodoxy (as she understood it) that she
represented herself to her fellow­believers in the Bab and to the population
at large. So long as the Bab appeared to command strict obedience to the
law, she strove to enforce such obedience within the Babi community. But,
by the summer of 1846, she began to infer from the Bab’s writings that it
was time to suspend the laws of the Islamic revelation.

Samandar clearly states that “she understood the [need for] the
abrogation of the laws of the Qurʾan before all or most of the people of the
Bayān [i.e. the Babis], deriving this from the stage of development reached
by the words of the Bab.”1330 Muʿīn al­Salṭana also refers to her originality
in abrogating the Qurʾanic laws, laying stress on what he regards as her
spiritual perception in so doing before it was made known that the Bab had
done so; he does, however, incorrectly attribute this behavior to the period
when she was in Qazvīn and Tehran, from 1847.1331

Mīrzā Muḥammad ʿAlī Zunūzī also refers to the fact that “with the
permission of the Sayyid [i.e., the Bab], Qurrat al­ʿAyn in practice rendered
null and void all the previous laws and observances.”1332 Shaykh Maḥmūd
ibn ʿAbd Allāh Ālūsī (1802­1853), the well­known Sunni muftī of Baghdad
(with whom Qurrat al­ʿAyn stayed for two months in 1847), remarks that

> She was one of those who followed the Bab after the death of
> Rashti, and then disobeyed him in some matters, among them
> religious obligations (takālīf). It is said that she used to speak of
> permitting women to be seen by men (ḥall al­furūj) and the
> suspension of all religious obligations whatsoever.1333

Qurrat al­ʿAyn herself dates the beginning of her move to abrogate
the sharīʿa from the month of Rajab 1262/June­July 1846. In a letter written
about this time, she states that “the gate of tribulations was opened through

the revelation of the blessed leaf from the blessed, crimson tree [i.e., a letter
from the Bab] in the month of God (shahr Allāh) [i.e., Rajab]… in which he
addressed this insignificant one, calling on her to carry out his
commands.”1334 This letter from the Bab seems to have instructed her to tell
her husband (qul [sic]1335 li­baʿliki) that this new cause was not like that of
Muḥammad who came before. Strengthened, as she puts it, by God’s grace
and might, she read these verses to the believers, telling them of the
greatness of God’s cause and calling on them to strive to understand “the
verses of innovation” (āyāt al­badʿ). She then summoned them to “enter the
gate of innovation, prostrating yourselves.” Some, she says, accepted this
summons and “discarded restraints and shut their eyes to rules and
regulations,” while others objected and censured her.1336

Not enough detail is given by Qurrat al­ʿAyn in her letter for us to tell
exactly what was involved in the abandonment of the more severe Islamic
laws (ḥudūd).1337 It was certainly not a full­scale abrogation such as took
place later, under her direction, at the conclave of Badasht, nor is there any
evidence that it involved a wholesale plunge into antinomianism such as
seems to have occurred at Alamut in 1164, when the Ismaili leader Ḥasan
ibn Muḥammad proclaimed the advent of the Qiyāma and abolished all
observances of the sharīʿa.1338 There are, nevertheless, numerous and
significant parallels with the latter event, especially in terms of doctrine.
When Ḥasan addressed his followers assembled at Alamut, he announced to
them that a letter had come to him from the hidden Ismaili Imām, containing
new guidance:

> The Imām of the age sends his blessings unto you and mercy,
> and designates you his servants, whom he has singled out. He
> has removed from you the burden of obedience to the sharīʿa,
> and has brought you to the time of resurrection (al­qiyāma).1339

“The ties and chains of sharī’at restrictions,” writes Abu Ishaq Ibrahim
Quhistani, “were taken from the necks of the faithful.”1340 Juwa’ynī writes
concerning the Ismaili beliefs at this period that

> They explained paradise and hell… in such a way as to give a
> spiritual meaning to these concepts. And then on the basis of
> this they said that the Resurrection is when men shall come to
> God and the mysteries and truths of all Creation be revealed,
> and acts of obedience abolished, for in the world to come all is

reckoning and there is no action. And this is the spiritual
> [Resurrection] and the Resurrection promised and awaited in all
> religions and creeds is this, which was revealed by Ḥasan. And
> as a consequence thereof men have been relieved of the duties
> imposed by the Shariʿa because in this period of the
> Resurrection they must turn in every sense towards God and
> abandon the rites of religious law and established habits of
> worship.”1341

It is of particular interest to note how closely the development of Ḥasan’s
claims parallels that of the Bab’s—from dāʿī and ḥujja of the Imām, to the
Imām himself in spiritual reality (al­ḥaqīqa), to the Qāʾim proclaiming the
age of qiyāma.1342

Although it is necessarily difficult to know what motivated Qurrat al­
ʿAyn to begin to abandon the sharīʿa at this point, it seems very likely that it
was for reasons similar in many respects to those adduced by the Niẓārīs for
their own abrogation of those same laws. As we have briefly noted before,
many Shaykhis, like the Ismailis, placed considerable emphasis on the
distinction between the outward observances of the faith (al­ẓāhir) and its
inward realities (al­bāṭin), and believed that the age of bāṭin had
commenced with al­Ahsaʾi and would culminate in the appearance of the
Hidden Imām. Thus, side by side with the central “polar motif” emphasizing
the role of the bearer of charisma, we find a “gnostic motif” in which
revelation of bāṭin takes precedence over other elements of faith and
doctrine.1343 In our chapter on Rashti, we referred briefly to an important
passage in his Sharḥ al­qaṣīda, in which he refers to the inception of an age
of bāṭin with al­Ahsaʾi; it will be worthwhile at this point to look again at
this passage in somewhat greater detail.

The Sayyid begins by stating that the prophet Muḥammad possesses
two names, one on earth (Muḥammad) and one in heaven (Aḥmad). Since
the name is a revelation (al­ism huwa ’l­ẓuhūr), this means that Muḥammad
is revealed twice (lahu ẓuhūrān). One revelation is in the outward worlds
(al­ʿawālim al­ẓāhiriyya), with respect to the external aspect of bodies, their
regulations, acts, and so on, and has its location (maẓhar) in the name
Muḥammad. The other is in the inward worlds (al­ʿawālim al­bāṭiniyya) and
its location is known as Aḥmad. Since creation is on the arc of ascent (al­
qaws al­suʿūdī) and, as it rises back to its origin, becomes progressively
more refined;1344 and since, from the time of the Prophet, there has appeared
at the beginning of each century someone to propagate (man yurawwiju) the

laws appropriate to that stage (of development); and since the beginning of
the arc was education for the appearance of outward laws, and its propagator
(al­murawwij) in each century has propagated the sharīʿa according to the
outward exigencies of the people; and since the outward body has two
stations, one relating to differences, accidents and changes, the other free of
these; and since each stage reaches perfection only through six phases
(aṭwār)—therefore, the outward laws related to the manifestation of the
name of Muḥammad reached a state of perfection only after twelve hundred
years.

On the completion of these twelve hundred years, the first age (al­
dawra al­ūlā) connected with the outward aspects of the sun of nubuwwa
and the twelve periods of the moon of wilāya were ended.1345 The second
age is for the purpose of making explicit the laws relating to the appearance
of inner truths and mysteries. By way of another analogy, the first age was
for the education of bodies and the spirits belonging to them, like the fetus in
the womb, while the second age is for the education of pure souls and spirits,
unconnected to bodies. In this second age, outward realities are subordinate
to inward, in distinction to the first age, in which the reverse was true. The
name of the Prophet in this age is his heavenly name, that is Aḥmad; the
murawwij and leader (raʾīs) of this age was also named Aḥmad (al­
Ahsaʾi).1346

In a treatise written by an anonymous Babi who had, clearly been a
Shaykhi, reference is similarly made to two ages; that of ẓāhir, ending in the
twelfth century, and that of bāṭin, beginning with the appearance of al­
Ahsaʾi.1347 The Shaykh himself “revealed of hidden knowledge what men
could bear,”1348 but throughout his lifetime and in the early days of Rashti,
concealment of their real teachings (taqiyya) was completely observed.1349
This author uses a similar analogy to that adopted by Rashti in the last
section of the above passage: he compares the world to a body without a
spirit, in the same way that a child develops by degrees. At the beginning of
the thirteenth century, it resembled a child of bout ten, endowed with powers
of discretion and, in the time of the seal of the gates (i.e., the Bab),1350
developed to the stage of a child on the verge of maturity. The beginning of
maturity will, he says, occur on the appearance of the Hidden Imām.1351

Much the same analogy is used by al­Karbalā’ī, who states that the
period of Shaykh Aḥmad (al­shaykh al­bāb) and Sayyid Kāẓim dated from
the beginning of the first century of the second age (dawra) up to the
appearance of the Bab; their period was “a body (jasad) for this substance
(li­hādhā ’l­jism) and a substance (jism) for that spirit (li­tilka ’l­rūḥ), and an

outward form (ẓāhir) for that inward reality (li­dhālika ’l­bāṭin) and an
inward reality for the inward reality of all inward realities (li­bāṭin al­
bāṭin).”1352

In a risāla written at a slightly later date, Qurrat al­ʿAyn states that, in
this day, the decree of the bāṭin al­bāṭin of the Qurʾan is manifest,1353 and
indicates that the outward meaning of the holy book is related to the Prophet
while its inner meaning belongs to the Imāms.1354 The Bab himself made it
clear that he spoke concerning the bāṭin al­bāṭin, in the same way that the
Imām Ḥusayn spoke of the bāṭin al­zāhir.1355 By contrast, Karīm Khān
Kirmānī objected that, since the work of al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti was as yet
incomplete and the bāṭin had not been perfected, it cannot be time for the
revelation of the bāṭin al­bāṭin.1356 He, however, agreed that “the outward
stages of the holy law reached perfection in the twelfth century, that is, in
one thousand two hundred.”1357

As we shall see presently, Qurrat al­ʿAyn had concluded that the time
for concealing the true meaning of Islam and observing its outward form had
ended. Her decision to dispense with the Islamic sharīʿa at this period must
be carefully distinguished from her later announcement, at the Badasht
gathering, that the dispensation of Islam was abrogated. In the latter case, the
rationale for the abrogation of the entire Islamic system was the conviction
that the qiyāma had occurred and that the Qā’im had appeared and revealed
a new sharīʿa (even if it was not yet made known to his followers).

In Karbala, it was not the end of the Islamic religious dispensation as
such which was at issue, but, rather, the open revelation of the bawāṭin of
the faith and, hence, the abandonment of all outer practices. As may be
expected, this move was to provoke considerable consternation in the Babi
community and, as the decision became public, among the Shaykhi and
orthodox Shiʿi and Sunni populations. Serious opposition came first from
the Shaykhis and the Shi‘is but, in Baghdad, Qurrat al­ʿAyn’s behavior was
to provoke heavy and determined criticism from a large section of the Babi
community.

Following an incident on 1 Muharram 1263/ 20 December 1846,1358 in
which Qurrat al­ʿAyn and her sister celebrated the Bab’s birthday in the
house of Sayyid Kāẓim, interrupting a meeting for rawḍa­khwānī while
dressed in bright clothing and henna,1359 she was arrested and imprisoned for
a few days.1360 It appears that she was then kept confined in her home,
although free to receive visitors, for some three months, while the governor
wrote to Baghdad for advice on how to deal with the situation.1361 In an
account of a visit made to Qurrat al­ʿAyn, apparently at this period, Mullā

Aḥmad Khurāsānī gives, in her own words as he remembered them, an
unequivocal statement of her intentions at this point, although even he does
not seem to have realized how critical for the future development of Babism
these intentions were to be:

> She asked me “Do you know why I summoned you”. I replied
> “No.” She said, “I was previously given the responsibility for
> the authority (wilāya) of Mullā Bāqir, and I made it incumbent
> on all of you to accept it. Yet no­one accepted it from me, with
> the exception of fourteen individuals, seven men and seven
> women. Now I shall present you with something else.” I said,
> “What is that?” She replied “It has come to me, through the
> tongue of my inner mystic state (bi­lisān al­ḥāl), not through
> physical speech, that I wish to remove all concealment (taqiyya)
> and to establish the proof of the remembrance and go to
> Baghdad.1362

An argument ensued, at the end of which Mullā Aḥmad left,
maintaining that he had himself received no fewer than seven letters from
the Bab, all commanding observance of taqiyya.1363 There appears to be
ample evidence that Qurrat al­ʿAyn was acting quite independently of the
Bab on the basis of her own promptings and her esoteric interpretation of his
writings.

In a letter addressed to various groups and written in Baghdad shortly
after her arrival there from Karbala, Qurrat al­ʿAyn refers clearly in several
places to her decision to discard taqiyya. She remarks “how strange it is that
this tiny sect, which can hardly be said to exist, so small is it, has fallen into
quarrels and become scattered.”1364 She then criticized those “who do not
make efforts in the path of their Lord,” and who curse anyone who does,
“while the Muslims reproach [the one who makes such efforts], saying his
blood may be shed with impunity, since he has opposed the Lord of Might
and torn aside the veil of taqiyya.”1365 She complains that her opponents do
not understand the real meaning of taqiyya and only hold to it out of fear.1366
After this general criticism, she turns her attention to one individual, saying
“you did not write out copies [of the Bab’s works] after it was made
incumbent on you to pen his books in gold ink, making the excuse of
taqiyya.”1367 She then calls on this same individual to “discard the meaning
which you have given to taqiyya and return unto the decree of your
Lord.”1368 After this, addressing “the noble ones” (i.e., the followers of the

Bab), she calls on them to “carry the verses of God unto every soul… and
follow the decree of innovation in the latter book.”1369 Referring to the
distinction between ẓāhir and bāṭin, she speaks of “the community of
believers who have reached the station of outwardly demonstrating Islam but
who turn aside from its reality.”1370 There then follows the passage quoted
above, in which she describes how, following the arrival of a letter from the
Bab, she began to call on the Babis to discard the laws of Islam. Finally,
towards the end, she claims that God has freed her from sins and error and
that whatever may be said by her or, indeed by her followers, is the truth.1371

Qurrat al­ʿAyn left Karbala early in 1263/1847; in just over a year,
having in the meantime been at the center of several controversies in
Baghdad (where she was condemned by a section of the Babi community for
appearing unveiled in the presence of men), Hamadān, Kirmanshah, and
Qazvīn (where she was accused of plotting the murder of her uncle, Ḥājī
Mullā Muḥammad Taqī), she spearheaded the movement for the abrogation
of Islam at a gathering of some eighty­one Babis at Badasht in
Mazandaran,1372 following the Bab’s own declaration of qāʾimīyya in prison
at Mākū.1373 As the extreme views adopted by her, the Bab, and other leaders
forced large numbers to abandon the movement, either to return to
Shaykhism or mainline Shiʿism,1374 Babism acquired the radical, non­
Islamic form in which it is best known. The roots of later Babi doctrine lie in
Shaykhi theories of charismatic leadership and revealed inner truth. The Bab
and his followers carried these and other, related, concepts to what was a
logical conclusion but, in so doing, broke entirely from the Shaykhi school,
from Shiʿism and, in the end, from Islam.

The Babi Rejection of Shaykhism

Karīm Khān’s rejection and refutation of the Bab, his identification of
him as a heretic, and his continued efforts to emphasize the validity of the
Shaykhi school as a legitimate silsila—a sort of eccesiola or personal
prelature—within the framework of strictly orthodox Twelver Shiʿism, made
it difficult for the followers of the Bab to continue to describe themselves as
Shaykhis without a large measure of confusion. The distinctions between
“Shaykhis”, “Babis”, or even “Karīm Khānis” were blurred for quite some
time in the public mind,1375 and it rapidly became almost as desirable for the
followers of the Bab to dissociate themselves from the Shaykhi school as it
was for the latter to dissociate any real link with Babism.

As early as 1846, in his commentary on the Sūrat al­kawthar, the Bab,
referring to the Shaykhis, spoke of “the falsehood of this sect (fiʾa)”, the
followers of which had “committed what Pharaoh did not commit before
this” and who were “in this day of the people of perdition.”1376 He takes
pains, however, to point out that both al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti would agree that
the Shaykhis had gone astray. At the same time, he makes clear his
relationship to his predecessors when he writes that “all that Kāẓim and
Aḥmad before him have written concerning the truths of theology and sacred
topics does not match a single word of what I have been revealing to
you.”1377 Similarly, he takes care to refute the charge that his Quranic
commentaries were merely references to the words of al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti,
maintaining that no one, not even they, could rival him in writing,1378
although their words were confirmed by his verses.1379

Continued opposition to his cause by the Shaykhi leadership seems to
have hardened the Bab’s attitude with regard to the school. In his Risāla dar
radd­i Bāb­i murtād, Karīm Khān, in order to make it clear that the Bab was
actually opposed to Shaykhism, quotes a passage from the latter’s writings
on this subject. The passage in question, although not identified as such
would appear from its description as “concerning the knowledge of the
[divine] name al­Quddūs, in the first stage (martaba)”, to be one of several
sections missing from standard texts of the Bab’s Kitāb al­asmāʾ, all the
abwāb of which are similarly headed.

Kirmānī begins by quoting the Bab’s statement that

we have forbidden you… [to read] the Tafsīr al­ziyāra [i.e., the

> Sharḥ al­ziyāra al­jāmiʿa al­kabīra] or the Sharḥ al­
> Khuṭba [i.e., the Sharh al­Khuba al­ṭuṭunjiyya], or
> anything written by either Aḥmad or Kāẓim…. Should
> you look on even a letter of what we have forbidden you,
> even should it be for but the twinkling of an eye or even
> less, God shall, in truth, cause you to be veiled from
> beholding him whom he shall manifest [man yuẓhiruhu—
> the messianic figure of later Babi literature].1380

He then proceeds to quote a statement from the same passage, in which the
Bab says that “Aḥmad and the fuqahāʾ are incapable of either
comprehending or bearing the mystery of the divine unity, whether in their
acts or in the core of their beings, for they are indeed people of limitation

and their knowledge is as nothing before God.”1381 Finally he quotes the
following:

> O people of the remembrance and the Bayān; we have
> prohibited you today, just as we have prohibited you from
> reading the fairy­tales of Aḥmad and Kāẓim and the fuqahāʾ,
> from sitting down in the company of those who have followed
> them in the decree, in case they lead you astray and cause you
> to become unbelievers. Know, O people of the Furqān [Qur’an]
> and the Bayān, that you are now enemies to those who have
> followed Aḥmad and Kāẓim, and they are enemies to you; you
> have no greater enemy on the face of the earth than them, nor
> have they any enemy greater than you…. Whoever allows into
> his heart seven sevenths of ten tenths of the head of a grain of

The Shiʿi insistence on knowing and shunning the enemies of the true faith
is present here in all its force; it recurs again and again in the course of
divisions within the Babi and Bahaʾi communities.

The Bab’s attitude to al­Ahsaʾi and Rashti had not changed
fundamentally—at quite a late date, for example, he wrote a ziyāratnāma for
the former1383—but it is quite clear that, towards the end of his life, he came
to regard the Shaykhi school as represented by Kirmānī as not merely
misguided but as positively inimical to true religion. This hardening of
attitude may well have been immediately occasioned by the actively hostile
role of several Shaykhi ulama in the Bab’s examination at Tabriz in 1848, to
which we have referred previously; but this would not, in itself, seem
sufficient to explain it. Of greater significance was the proclamation of
qāʾimiyya at this time.

If it had been necessary for Kirmānī and other Shaykhi leaders to
disclaim any relationship with the Bab or his ideas, it was now equally vital
for the latter to dissociate himself from Shaykhism, in order to avoid
continued ambiguity concerning his role and station. By stressing, at this
point, the alienation of the Bab from Shaykhism, his followers (more and
more of whom were coming from a non­Shaykhi background)1384 were able
to focus more clearly the nature of their radical departure from Islam itself.

In the total separation which we have, thus, seen develop between
Babism and Shaykhism, we can observe not only the beginning of a

processes whereby the latter school effectively acquired the status of an
ecclesiola within the wider community of Twelver Shiʿism, but also—and,
perhaps, more vividly still—the mechanics of the development which
transformed Babism from a movement within the Shaykhi school to a
distinct sect of Shiʿism and, in the end, to an idiosyncratic religious
movement claiming independence from the revelatory jurisdiction of Islam.

With the transformation of Babism into an independent religious
affiliation eschewing (in theory at least) all sectarian connection with Islam,
it passes out of the area of our immediate concern. At this juncture, the study
of Babism proper may be said to begin—an important and useful study, but
one not immediately relevant to the questions we have sought to answer,
however tentatively, in these pages. What I have to say about that later phase
may be found in the books and articles I have devoted to it.

With the development of independent Babism, its suppression, and its
eventual failure in that form, the latest and perhaps the last of the great
sectarian responses to the problems of charisma and authority in Shiʿism had
run its course. The impact of the West and the subsequent secularization of
much of Iranian society were to raise fresh problems and to demand new
responses from the religious institutions, responses that have worked
themselves on the political and social stages since the 1979 revolution, and
in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Husayn.

Babism and, indeed the later Bahaʾi sect to which it gave birth,1385

were lessons for the ulama: charisma, unless controlled within routinized
forms, could run riot and lead, in the end, beyond Shiʿism and Islam itself.
The modern development of Iranian Shiʿism has, in many ways, been a
search for these routinized forms, be it in the office of Ayatollah or the re­
organization of theological studies in Qum by Ayatollah Burujirdī (1875­
1961), or the attempt to define the role of the marjaʿ al­taqlīd (as in the
exposition Baḥthī dar bāra­yi rūḥāniyyat wa marjaʿiyyat).1386 As the Iranian
revolution and the regime it founded have succeeded in establishing for the
ulama a leading position in society and a formal role within the sphere of
government, we have witnessed a further, more thorough, routinization and
organization of charismatic authority in Shiʿism. There are, as I write, early
signs that President Mahmoud Ahmadinezhad anticipates an early
appearance of the Hidden Imam. Whether this, in turn, will lead to further
outbursts of prophetic charisma in heterodox movements remains a matter
for speculation; the study of Shaykhism and Babism may, at least, help us to
speculate more clearly.

BIBLIOGRAPHY

Introduction
The following bibliography contains all the books, articles, and manuscripts
listed in my original thesis. However, since much time has passed, new
books and articles have been published, and I have wanted to draw the
attention of my readers to these. To round things out, I have also added
earlier academic and quasi­academic materials that were not in the original
bibliography, but which have a direct relationship to Shaykhism, Babism, or
both. Given the surge in interest in Shiʿite Islam since 1979, it has not been
remotely possible to include here moe than a tiny portion of materials
published on that subject in the intervening years. Many items are now
available on a number of websites, including some assiduously compiled by
various Baha’i organizations and individuals: my thanks to everyone
involved for the hard work they and their helpers have put into this.
Accessing facsimiles of manuscripts and rare books in this way was simply
unimaginable when I was doing my research for this book: I wish the next
generation of researchers well of it.

I have made a point of including here practically everything I have
written and published on the Shaykhis and Babis since 1979, for no other
reason than to make these titles available to the younger generation, who are
often in ignorance of my contribution to the field. That, and a sense of
rounding things up as I approach the advanced age of sixty.

marque une revivification puissante de la gnose shî’ite primitive et des
enseignements contenus dans les traditions remontant aux saints Imâms.”

\[13\] “He [Shaykh Aḥmad] opposed the Platonists, the Stoics, and the
Aristotelians (ḥukamā­yi ishrāqīyīn wa rawāqīyīn wa mashāʾīn) on most

their arguments”, (Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti, Dalīl al­mutaḥayyirīn ([s.l.: s.n.],

\[29\] It is relevant to note here that one of the best examples of such further
routinization following the death of the bearer of hereditary, latent charisma
is to be found in the Bahaʾi movement after the demise of Shoghi Effendi,
the walī amr Allāh, in 1957; the subsequent increase in organizational
elements, the introduction of a vastly expanded complex of appointed
officials, and the combination of charismatic and legal authority in an
elected body have all resulted in a very high degree of routinization and a
much more ‘church­like’ image. See Vernon Elvin Johnson, “An Historical
Analysis of Critical Transformations in the Evolution of the Baha’i World
Faith,” Ph.D. diss., Baylor University (Waco, Texas), 1974. For earlier
routinization in the movement, see Peter L. Berger, “From Sect to Church: A

The most popular Shiʿi source for traditions on the rajʿa of the twelfth
Imām is Majlisī, Biḥār al­anwār, vol. 53, pp. 1­144. An excellent systematic
compilation of traditions relating to resurrection in general (maʿād), qiyāma,
and rajʿa is to be found in Muḥammad Khān Kirmānī, al­Kitāb al­mubīn,
2nd ed. ([Kirman]: Chāpkhānih­i Sa‘ādat, 1354 Sh [1975­6]), vol. 2, pp.
115­57. Succinct accounts of this topic (which is particularly relevant to our
later discussion of Shaykhi expectation) may be found in Shaykh Aḥmad al­
Ahsaʾi, Ḥayāt al­nafs. Trans. Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti, 2nd ed. Kirman:
Matbaʿat al Saʿādat, 1353 Sh [1974], pp. 91­134 and Muḥammad Karīm

traditions, largely derived from the ʿAwālim may be found in an anonymous

\[109\] It is not entrely true to say, as does Algar, that “the few ulama whose
names attained any prominence resided there [the ʿatabāt]”, Algar, Religion
and State, p. 30. Of the four ulama referred to by Algar himself as eminent,
only one—Yūsuf Bahrānī—lived at the ʿatabāt (and only for a limited time),
the other three residing in Isfahan and Mashhad.

\[110\] Namely, Āqā Mīrzā Muḥammad Mahdī Shahristānī, Shaykh Ḥusayn ibn
Muḥammad al­Darāzī al­Baḥrānī, Shaykh Aḥmad ibn Ḥasan al­Bahrānī al­
Damastānī, and Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdī Ṭabāṭabāʾī Baḥr al­ʿUlūm.
Details of these men may be found in this and the next chapter.

\[111\] See note 76 above.

\[112\] The idea that the bāb al­ijtihād was permanently closed by he start of the

th
10 century is a myth developed by Western scholars and modern Muslims
alike. On this, see Wael B. Hallaq, “On the Origins of the Controversy about
the Existence of Mujtahids and the Gate of Ijtihad”, Studia Islamica 63
(1986): 129­141; idem “Was the Gate of Ijtihad Closed?”, International
Journal of Middle East Studies 16 (1984): 3­41; idem “Ijtihād”, in Esposito
(ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam in the Modern World 4 vols., New
York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, vol. 2, pp. 178­81. “There
exists no evidence of such a closure either in the tenth century or thereafter,
and there certainly was no consensus on it. To the contrary, evidence shows
that the practice of ijtihād continued throughout the centuries, although on a
smaller scale than before because of the stability the legal system had
attained” (ibid, p. 180).

\[113\] On the absence of genuine renewal or reformism among the Shiʿi ulama
by reason of their attachment to precedent, see William G. Millward,
“Aspects of Modernism in Shī‘a Islam,” Studia Islamica (Paris), vol. 37
(1977), pp. 112­3.

\[263\] Reaction to this revival, which began with the propaganda of Maʿṣūm
ʿAlī Shāh in Shīrāz during the reign of Karīm Khān Zand (d. 1779), was
energetic. Maʿṣūm ʿAlī and his disciple Fayd ʿAlī Shāh were severely
persecuted. Another Niʿmat Allāhī darwīsh, Mushtāq ʿAlī Shāh, was put to
death in 1790 in Kirman, and Nūr ʿAlī Shāh, a son of Fayḍ ʿAlī Shāh,
appears to have been poisoned by agents of Muḥammad ʿAlī Bihbahānī in
1215/ 1800. For details of these and related events, see Algar, Religion and
State, pp. 38­40; Sir John Malcolm, The History of Persia from the Early
Period to the Present Time (London: J. Murray, 1815), vol. 2, pp. 417­22;

[1895?]), pp. 77­84; Maʿṣūm ʿAlī Shāh, Ṭarāʾiq, vol. 3, pp. 170­94. Al­
Aḥsāʾī was far from favorably inclined towards Sufism, as we have noted.

\[264\] On Rashtī’s childhood, see an account by Ḥājī Mīrzā ʿAlī Aṣghar (a
classmate of his) in Mullā Jaʿfar Qazvīnī, “Tārīkh­i Mullā Jaʿfar Qazvīnī,”
in Samandar, Tārīkh, p. 455. Like al­Ahsaʾi, Rashtī disliked games, and
would look after the books of the other children while they played. On the
Bab’s childhood, see ʿAbd al­Ḥusayn Avāra, Al­kawākib al­durriyya fī
maʾāthir al­Bahāʾiyya (Cairo: Maṭbaʿa al­Saʿāda, 1342 [1924]), pp. 31­2. A
contemporary of the Bab, Sayyid Muḥammad Ṣaḥḥāf Shīrāzī, is quoted to
the effect that the Bab did not join in the games of his classmates, but would
be found in prayer in a secluded place. We may also note the ascetic
childhood and youth of Faḍl Allāh Astarābādī, the founder of the Ḥurūfī
sect, who also experienced dreams of the Imāms before embarking on his
religious mission (see Alessandro Bausani, “Ḥurūfiyya,” in Encyclopedia of
Islam, 2nd ed. (London: Luzac; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1960­), vol. 3, p. 600).

\[265\] See, for example, Al­Aḥsāʾī, Sharḥ­i ḥālāt, pp. 5­7; Maḥfūẓ, Sīra, pp. 9­
10; Kirmānī, Fihrist, p. 134.

\[266\] Tanakābunī states that al­Aḥsāʾī practised ascetisim greatly during the
early part of his life (Qiṣaṣ, p. 37), and mentions that Sayyid Kāẓim Rashtī
(under whom he studied for a short time) told him that Shaykh Aḥmad had
performed forty chillas of riyāḍāt (ibid.). Rashti himself states that al­Aḥsāʾī

only practised severe asceticism for a two­year period following his initial
vision of the Imām Ḥasan (Rashti, Dalīl, p. 12).

Fihrist, pp. 139­40. These initiatory dreams of al­Aḥsāʾī are closely
paralleled by a visionary experience in which the Bab dreamt he drank the
blood from the severed head of the Imām Ḥusayn (see ʿAlī Muḥammad
Shīrāzī, the Bāb, Ṣaḥīfa­yi ʿadliyya [{Tehran?: s.n., n.d.}], p. 14; Zarandī,
Dawn­Breakers, p. 253), and by a dream similarly involving the ingestion of
the saliva of the Prophet by Mullā Muḥammad Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī (see
Muḥammad ʿAlī Malik Khusravī, Tārīkh­i Shuhadā­yi Amr (Tehran:
Muʾassasa­yi Millī­yi Maṭbūʿāt­i Amrī, 130 B. [1974]), vol. 1, p. 21).

\[271\] Al­Aḥsāʾī himself indicates that it was extremely early, saying it took
place fī awwal infitāḥ bāb al­ruʾyā (Maḥfūẓ, Sīra, p. 17; Kirmānī, Fihrist, p.

relationship to the concepts of risāla, nubuwwa, and wilāya, see Corbin, En
Islam iranien, vol. 1, pp. 235­51, vol. 3, pp. 171­5; idem, Histoire de la
philosophie islamique (Paris : Gallimard, 1964), pp. 79­92. Some inimical
sources have tried to argue that al­Aḥsāʾī laid claim to waḥy, but this
appears to be based more on biased misreadings of passages in his works
than on any straightforward remarks to that effect by him (see Hamadānī,
Kitāb al­Ijtināb, pp. 396­7).

\[283\] Both Shaykh ʿAbd Allāh al­Aḥsāʾī and Sayyid Hādī Hindī give the year
1176/ 1762, but this clashes with the most reliable date for al­Ahsa’i’s birth
(see al­ Aḥsāʾī, Sharḥ­i ḥālāt, p. 22; Tanbīh al­Ghāfilīn, cited in Kirmānī,
Fihrist, p. 161). The correction to 1186/ 1772 seems the simplest solution.

whom he met in Mashhad, and who claimed to be descended from one of his
daughters. (Fihrist, p. 172). Khwānsārī mentions two sons, Shaykh
Muḥammad and Shaykh ʿAlī, and maintains that the former rejected his
father’s teachings (Rawḍāt, p. 26). According to Kashmīrī (1844­1891),

Shaykh ʿAlī was his father’s successor in Kirmanshah, Nujūm, p. 367; cf.

which they wrote, listed in Kirmānī, Fihrist, pp. 9­10, 360). On the

are the direct intervention by the Shaykh al­Islām of Shīrāz during the early
years of the reign of Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh, in which he forced the governor,
Muḥammad Nabī Khān, to lower the price of bread and succeeded in having
him dismissed (see Sir William Ouseley, Travells in Various Countries of
the East; More Particularly Persia, etc. (London: Rodwell and Martin,

Mullā Aḥmad Narāqī, and his forcing Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh to appoint a new

\[355\] The exact dating of al­Ahsaʾi’s visit is difficult, since none of our sources
gives precise details. However, the Risāla al­khāqāniyya, presumably
written from Yazd, is dated early Ramaḍān 1223/late October 1808; a letter
dated 19 Ṣafar 1224/5 April 1809 is recorded as having been written in Yazd
(Kirmānī, Fihrist, p. 287). Further evidence is provided by the date of the
arrival of Muḥammad ʿAlī Mīrzā’s envoy in Basra, at the begining of Dhū
’l­Qaʿda 1223/mid­December 1808. The reference to the journey as
occurring in winter also helps us pinpoint the approximate date of his arrival.

It is unclear whether the fāʾida of al­Ahsaʾi’s dated 20 Ramadān 1223/9

November 1808 was written in Yazd or Tehran (ibid, p. 229).

Rashti gives the names of several ulama with whom the Shaykh associated
at the ʿatabāt during his pilgrimages in the period of his stay in Kirmanshah
from 1814 (Rashti, Dalīl, pp. 22­3). Elsewhere, Rashti states that, on several
journeys to the ʿatabāt, al­Ahsaʾi associated with Mīrzā­yi Qummī and
Shaykh Ḥasan ibn Ḥusayn ʿAlī ʿAsfūr, both of whom showed great
admiration for him (ibid., p. 24). He omits to mention here another man with
whom al­Ahsaʾi probably associated during his earlier journeys to the
ʿatabat – Sayyid Muḥsin al­Aʿrajī (d. 1231/1816), from whom he may have
received an ijāza.

\[425\] Although ʿAbd al­Wahhāb never seems to have been regarded as a
Shaykhi, his attitude towards the school, as well as to Babism, was basically
favourable. On the death of Rashti, he was the only ʿālim in Qazvīn to
organize a memorial gathering (Qazvīnī, “Tārīkh­i Mullā Jaʿfar Qazvīnī,” p.
469). His two sons Mīrzā Muḥammad­ʿAlī and Mīrzā Hādī, were both
Shaykhis and later became Babis, being included in the small group of
earliest disciples, the ḥurūf al­ḥayy. (Zarandī, Dawn­Breakers, pp. 80­1;
\[426\] Chahārdihī, Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsāʾī, p. 37.

\[427\] Kirmānī, Fihrist, p. 156. Shaykh Jaʿfar (d. 1306/1888) lived in Karbala,
but later went to Kirman, where he associated with Muḥammad Khān,
Karīm Khān’s son and successor. Muḥammad Khān relates traditions from
Shaykh Jaʿfar in his Kitāb al­mubīn, and Karīm Khān’s Taqwīm al­lisān
(printed 1272/1855) was written at his request (Kirmānī, Fihrist, p. 396).

\[434\] Quoted in Kirmānī, Fihrist, pp. 157­8. Abū ’l­Qāsim Khān maintains that
al­Ahsaʾi and Baraghānī agreed on the fact of physical resuurection, but
disagreed as to its manner (ibid., p. 152). This is largely true, in that al­
Ahsaʾi did not—as some sources have suggested—speak in terms of a
spiritual resurrection. Babi and Bahaʾi allegorizing is a later development.

that the four main points of disagreement with al­Ahsaʾi concerned: miʿrāj,
maʿād, ʿilm (the divine kowledge), and the belief in the Imāms as the cause
of creation (ibid., pp. 57­8).

and attended by Mullā Muḥammad Sharīf al­ʿUlamāʾ Māzandarānī), Ḥājī
Mullā Muḥammad Jaʿfar Astarābādī, and Sayyid Kāẓim Rashtī, appears to
have been a second meeting, probably identical with that described in

Chapter Three

\[480\] The “Tanbīh al­ghāfilīn” is based on statements from the author’s father,
Āqā Sayyid Muḥammad Taqī. (Kirmānī, Fihrist, p. 114).

\[481\] Ibid., pp. 113, 114.

\[482\] Ibid., pp. 114­23.

\[483\] Thus Zarandī, Dawn­Breakers, p. 45, who states that he died in
1259/1843 “at the ripe age of sixty.” This, however, contradicts an earlier
statement by the same author (p. 10) to the effect that Rashti was aged
twenty­two in 1231/1815.

\[484\] Thus Ḥabībābādī, Makārim, vol. 1 , p. 209, based on a statement in a
manuscript copy of the Tārikh­i Sartip of Mīrzā ʿAbd al­Razzāq Khān
Muhandis Sartīp Baghāyarī. Also Avāra, Kawākib, p. 27

\[485\] Thus Zarandī, Dawn­Breakers, page 10, who states that Rashti was
twenty­two years old in 1231/1815. In contradiction to his statement cited in
note 4 above. Nicolas cites a Shaykhi ʿālim called Thiqat al­Islām
(presumably Mīrzā ʿAlī Thiqat al­Islām Tabrizī, the grandson of Mīrzā
Shafīʿ Thiqat al­Islām, who was hanged in Tabriz by the Russians in
1330/1912), who states that Rashti died at the age of fifty, which would give
a birth­date of 1209/1794 (A.­L.­M. Nicolas, Essai sur le Chéi’khisme, vol.
2, Séyyèd Kazem Rechti (Paris : P. Geuther, 1914), p. 5). Browne cites a
statement to the effect that he died in 1259 “ere he had attained his fiftieth
year.” (Edward Granville Browne, “The Sheykhīs and Their Doctrine

Concerning the ‘Fourth Support’,” in A Traveller’s Narrative, vol. 2, p.

\[486\] Thus Ḥājj Sayyid Jawād Qarashī, quoted in Kirmānī, Fihrist, p. 115.

commentary on the qaṣīda by the Mawsilī poet ʿAbd al­Bāqī ibn Sulaymān
[ʿUmarī] Fārūqī (1204­1278/1789­1862), written on the occasion of the

the tomb of the Prophet for the Shrine of Imām Mūsā in al­Kāẓimiyya; the
commentary was written on the instructions of ʿAlī Riḍāʾ Pasha. The qaṣīda

in 1850, and the latter became a renegade from Babism about 1849, it is
likely that religious animosity may have played some part in his choice of
individuals (cf. his references to Muḥīṭ Kirmānī, Muḥammad Karīm Khān

a neutral position; about two years before his death, Rashti sent the future
Babi apostle Mullā Muḥammad Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī, to visit Shaftī with the
aim of enlisting his support against his opponents at the ʿatabāt, in which
mission he is said to have been successful (ibid., pp. 19­24). Muḥammad­
ʿAlī Fayḍī prints a letter which he claims to have been written by Rashti to
Bushrūʾī, praising him for this (Ḥaḍrat­i Nuqṭa­yi ūlā (Tehran: [s.n.], 1352

al­Baḥrānī as Imām­Jumʿa in about 1246/1830 (notes to ibid., p. 486), but he
does not appear to have arrived in Kirman until about 1254/1838 (Aḥmadī

\[754\] For details of these individuals, see the relevant chapters in Kirmānī,
Fihrist. A temporary split occurred in Kirmānī Shaykhism when Muḥammad
Raḥīm Khān Kirmānī, Karīm’s eldest son, was passed over in favor of Ḥājī
Muḥammad Khān; his followers, known as Raḥīm Khanīs, seem, for the
most part, to have rejoined the main group on the death of Muḥammad Khān
(Chahārdihī, Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsāʾī, p. 247). A more serious split took place
on Karīm Khān’s death, when Hājī Mīrzā Muḥammad Bāqir Hamadānī
(1239­1319/1824­1901), the leader of the school (under Karīm Khan) in
Hamadān, opposed the succession of Muḥammad Khān on the grounds that
he was himself the most learned of the ulama and that the leadership of the
school ought not to become hereditary. His followers, known as Bāqīrīs (in
distinction to those of Muḥammad Khān), known as Naṭīqīs or Nawāṭiq),
predominate in Hamadān, Jandaq, Bīyābānak, Nāʾīn, and Isfahan (Bāmdād,

passage in Shīrāzī, Bayān­i fārsī (Tehran: [s. n., n. d.]), 7:6, p. 246, in which
he states that the ulama, ḥukkām, tujjār, and others should marry within the

Rashti, Lawāmiʿ (Shīrāzī, Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar, f. 24a).

He also quotes numerous khuṭub of the Imām ʿAlī, including his
Khuṭbat al­yatīma (Shīrāzī, Tafsīr Sūrat al­baqara, ms. in CUL, Browne Or.
MS. F. 8, f. 4a), the Khuṭba al­ṭuṭunjiyya (Shīrāzī, Dalāʾil­i sabʿa, p. 46),
the Khuṭba yawm al­ghadīr (ibid., p. 47), the Khuṭbat al­ijmāʿ (Shīrāzī,
Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar, f. 77b), and the Khuṭbat al­maḥzūn (ibid., f. 85b).

It would also appear that the Bab was familiar with the Bible, as
attested by ʿAbbās Mīrzā’s physician Dr. William Cormick (1820­1877)
who records that he was seen reading a copy while in custody (quoted in
Browne, Materials, p. 262). His only quotation (as far I am aware) from the
Gospels is, however, quite apocryphal (Shīrāzī, Tafsīr Sūrat al­baqara, f.
20b).

was still­born, since he appears to have been born prematurely in Ṣafar
1259/March 1843 (ibid f. 195a).

This passage generally occurs before the tafsīr of the Sūrat al­fātiḥa,
which precedes that of al­Baqara proper, but it can be found in other
positions or not at all (as in the Cambridge manuscript, Browne F. 8). The
manuscripts used by me for this passage are in INBA 6004.C and 6014.C.

\[809\] Māzandarānī, Asrār al­āthār, vol. 2, p. 62.

\[810\] Thus mss 6004.C and 6012.C in INBA, and a copy in the Haifa Bahaʾi
archives, originally in possession of A.­L.­M. Nicolas. MS 6014.C in INBA
bears the date Dhū ’l­Ḥijja 1260/December 1844­January 1845; this is
almost certainly corrupt since there is evidence that the second part of the
tafsīr must have been completed by that date.

\[811\] Shirazi, Khuṭba fī Jidda, ms. in INBA 5006C, p. 332. The date as given
in this manuscript is 1 Ṣafar, but on the basis of other days relating to his
pilgrimage, it is clearly incorrect. Ishrāq Khāvarī cites another ms. which
clearly gives 11 Ṣafar 1261/19 February 1845 (ʿAbd al­Ḥamīd Ishrāq
Khāvarī, Taqvīm­i tārīkh­i amr (Tehran: Muʾassasa­yi Millī­yi Maṭbūʿāt­i

\[815\] Thus Shirazi, Qayyūm al­asmāʾ, ff. 25a, 71a, 120b­121a. The vision
described on f. 71a is said to have occurred in Ramaḍān: the section of the
Qayyūm al­asmāʾ in which it occurs appears to have been written in the
same month (see ff. 65b, 80a), and we may conclude that Ramaḍān 1260 is
intended. What may have been a vision of the Hidden Imām is described in
Shirazi, Tafsīr Sūrat al­kawthar, ff. 68b­69a.

Muḥammad­Alī Bārfurūshī and Qurrat al­ʿAyn are not included among the
muʿtakkifūn by Zarandī. There are close parallels between Zarandī’s account
of the occult manner in which the ḥurūf al­ḥayy were “drawn” to the Bab
(see pp. 52, 63, 68, 69­70) and the “search after hidden truth” element
recurrent in Ismaili biographical writing (see Marshall G. S. Hodgson, The
Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Nizari Isma’ilis against the
Islamic World (The Hague: Mouton, 1955), p. 17 and n. 15). This points up
the significance of the gnostic motif in Babism (and its connection with the
polar and chiliastic motifs), to which we shall return. This same theme is
extremely common in later Bahaʾi biographical and autobiographical
materials in both Iranian and Western contexts.

instructs him to chant the adhān and to teach in the mosque “where the

(see letter quoted in Māzandarānī, Ẓuhūr al­ḥaqq, p. 149; Hamadānī,

In a letter to his uncle, Sayyid ʿAlī, the Bab, speaking of the return to
earth of Muḥammad and the Imāms in the persons of the ḥurūf al­ḥayy,
states that the first to return was Muḥammad and that he was the first
messenger of the Qāʾim (i.e., Bushrūʾī – see Shirazi, Bayān­i fārsī 1:2, p. 6;
1:3, p. 8); the second to return was ʿAlī, and he took the message of the Bab
to Ḥājī Mīrzā Sayyid ʿAlī (his uncle) in Bushehr (i.e., Basṭāmī – see Mīrzā
Ḥusayn ʿAlī Nūrī, Bahāʾ Allāh, Lawḥ­i Naṣīr, in Majmūʿa­yi alvāḥ­i

mubāraka, ed. Muḥyī ’l­Dīn Ṣabrī (Cairo: Saʿdat Press, 1920), pp. 190­1:
idem, letter quoted in Māzandarānī, Ẓuhūr al­ḥaqq, pp. 223­4. Zarandī states
that Basṭāmī was the first to leave Shīrāz (The Dawn­Breakers, pp. 87­90).

Evidence for this date may be found in Rawlinson to Sir Stratford
Canning (8 January 1845): “About three months ago, an inferior priest of
Shiraz appeared in Kerbela, bearing a copy of the Koran, which he stated to
have been delivered to him, by the forerunner of the Imām Mehdi, to be
exhibited in token of approaching advent” (in Rawlinson to Sir Justin Sheil,
16 January 1845, FO 248/114). Later reports from Rawlinson confirm that
the reference is to Mullā ʿAlī.

Baghdādī, Risāla amriyya, p. 106. This source indicates that Basṭāmī
spent about three months in prison in Baghdad before his trial there; since

the trial took place on 13 January 1845, he must have been transferred to
Baghdad about the middle of October.

Ibid., pp. 106­7; Tanakābūnī, Qiṣaṣ, pp. 196­7; Wardī, Lamaḥāt, pp.

138­40. A full account of Basṭāmī’s arrest and trial is given by Moojan
Momen, “The Trial of Mullā ʿAlī Basṭāmī: A Combined Sunnī­Shīʿī Fatwā

Western Accounts (Oxford: George Ronald, 1981), pp. 83­90. The court of
inquiry was attended by both Shiʿi and Sunni ulama, under the presidency of
Najīb Pāshā; ʿAlī Wardī states that “this was the first gathering of its kind in
the Ottoman period, since it was not then customary for the ulama of both
parties to meet together in a single gathering for a trial,” Lamahāt, p. 138.

There is contradictory evidence which suggests that Khurāsānī traveled to
Kirman in the summer of 1845, after his expulsion from Shīrāz in June
(Zarandī, Dawn­Breakers, pp. 183­7). The present reconstruction would
seem, however, to avoid most inconsistencies.

asmāʾ, f. 103a.

The original passage may be found in chapter one of the Furūʿ al­
ʿAdliyya (INBA 5010.C, there numbered “chapter seven”, p. 94; also the
Persian translation there numbered “chapter thirteen”, p. 130); it reads:
“And among the purified substances in certain verses are those things which
have fallen beneath the gaze of the Family of God; even though none of the
ulama have mentioned this, nevertheless, the decision rests with him whom
God hath caused to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth.”

extension of this “charismatic field” (as defined by Berger) in Babism, with
the later role of Mullā Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī and Mullā Muḥammad ʿAlī
Bārfurūshī as the “Qāʾim­i Khurāsānī” and “Qāʾim­i Jīlānī” respectively,

use of a similar analogy in an Ismaili context, see al­Ṭūsī, Rawḍāt al­taslīm,

The widening of the Bab’s appeal and the decrease in the numerical
importance of Shaykhis within the Babi movement is noted by Moojan

Preliminary Analysis,” International Journal of Middle East Studies
(Cambridge) vol. 15 (1983), pp. 157­83.

I use “sect” advisedly: early Baha’ism is simply an offshoot of Babism
for some time; later, in various phases, it seeks to take on the quality of an
independent religion, though its current status is closer to that of a New
Religious Movement, as defined by modern sociologists of religion.

This latter point is discussed in Ann K. S. Lambton, “A Reconsideration
of the Position of the Marjaʿ al­Taqlīd and the Religious Institution,” Studia
Islamica (Paris) vol. 20 (1964), pp. 115­35.
