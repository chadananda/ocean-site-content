• ABSTRACT

> 'Some Aspects of Isra'Iliyyat and the Emergence of the Babi-Baha'T
> Interpretation of the Bible'
Stephen N. Lambden

This thesis deals with Islamic Isralliyyat ("Israelitica") literary traditions, the Bible and
the relationship to them of two closely related post-Islamic movements, the Babr and Bahal
religions. It concerns the Islamic assimilation and treatment of pre-Idamic, biblical and related
materials and their level of post-Islamic Babi-Bahal assimilation and exposition. More
specifically, this thesis focuses upon select aspects of the biblical and Islamo-biblical
("Islamified", "Islamicate") traditions reflected within the Arabic and Persian writings of two
Iranian born 19th century messianic claimants Sayyid 'All Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab (1819-
1859) and Mirza Husayn 'All NOrT (1817-1892), entitled Bah'-Allah, the founders of the BabT
and Baha'T religions respectively.

The presence of Islamo-biblical citations and the absence of canonical biblical citations
within the writings of the Bab will be argued as will the emergence of the Baha'T interpretation
of the canonical Bible though its founder figure Bah'-Allah who first cited an Arabic Christian
Bible version whilst resident in Ottoman Iraq (Baghdad) towards the end of what has been
called the middle-BabT period (1861-2 CE). This laid the foundations for the Bahl interpretation
of the Bible which was greatly enriched and extended by oriental Bahl apologists , Bah'-
Allah's eldest son 'Abd al-Baha' Abbas (d. 1921) and his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (d.
1957) who shaped the modern global Baha'T phenomenon. Over a century or so the neo-Shn
millennialist faction that was Babism (the religion of the Bab) evolved into the global Baha'T
religion of the Book

Throughout this thesis aspects of Isralliyyat will be analysed historically and the
Islamic, especially Shi sT-ShaykhT background to and the BabT-Baha'T messianic renewal of the
Isra'Tliyyat rooted tradition of the ism Allah al-a'gam (Mightiest Name of God) will be noted and
commented upon.

• PREFACE

This thesis was begun about nineteen years ago. For medical reasons it was largely
abandoned for more than a decade. Several actual or nominal doctoral supervisors
encouraged me, though I was initially unable to accomplish much. I did, however, manage to
collect relevant material, struggle to keep up to date in the research area, maintain contacts
in the fast evolving field of Babi-Bahal studies, and attempt to become computer literate.

My initial supervisor within the Dept of Religious Studies (Univ. of Newcastle upon
Tyne) Dr. Denis MacEoin (1982-86, then lecturer in [Arabic and] Islamic Studies) had been and
(unofficially remained) wonderfully supportive and generous with advice and loans from his
excellent library. After him the now retired head of the Newcastle Dept., Prof. John Sawyer,
offered encouragement and support for an extended period, witnessing little evidence of
completion. More recently and despite multitudinous academic and other commitments, Dr.
William Telford generously and patiently guided me on the right path through writing up and
submission.

In the early 1980s I benefited considerably by extending my meagre knowledge of
Arabic and Persian though the study of Persian grammar and the translation of Babi-Baha'T
texts at the University of Durham with Dr. Paul Luft (until recently, at Manchester Univ.) and
his assistant, the now late Dr. Reza Navabpour. A good many professional and lay and experts
in the field of Shlism and BabT-Baha'T studies have also, over the years, assisted in various
ways; including, for example, Dr. Juan Cole (Univ. Michigan), Dr. B. Todd Lawson (Univ.
Toronto), Dr. Moojan Momen (Cambridge), Dr. Sholeh Quinn (Athens, Ohio) and Dr. Peter
Smith (Univ. Mahidol, Thailand). The institutions at the Bahal World Centre (Haifa Israel), the
family of the late Hasan Balyuzi including the trustees of the (now Tonbridge, UK based) Afnan
Library, as well as numerous other families and friends, generously provided me with an
almost unending supply of the primary Persian and Arabic and other Babi-Baha'T source
materials as well as notice of important books and mss. of diverse kinds. I remain in great debt
to all of the above persons and to others too numerous to mention here, for their longstanding

V
patience, friendship, support and understanding.
• INTRODUCTORY NOTE

BabT-Baha'T studies had its apologetic genesis in the first half of the 19th century when
learned, predominantly ShaykhT, disciples of the Bab expounded and defended their religion
in the face of increasingly hostile, largely ShrT clerical attacks. Later, numerous apologetic
writings of the founders of the BabT and Bahal religions and their followers were written.
BabT-Baha'T primary, and to some extent secondary literatures, are extremely vast and in a
very wide range of languages. Many BabT and Baha'T manuscripts and documents remain
uncatalogued and unstudied awaiting academic examination and publication. Secondary
literatures are often uneven. They exhibit a very wide range of perspectives from the banal and
uninformed to works of considerable insight and integrity. Most academic writing remains
highly speculative and often misleading in a field that remains in its infancy.

The prominent western orientalists who published studies in the nascent BabT (-
Baha'T) religions, include several persons then active in Tsarist Russia, including Alexander
(MTrza) Kazem-Beg (1802-c.1870), Alexander G. Tumanski (1805-1881) and their German
born associate, Jean-Albert-Bernard Dorn (1805-1881). It is a curious twist of history,
however, that the notorious French journalist, diplomat, and 'Father of Racism', Joseph Arthur,
Comte de Gobineau (1816-1882) in his Religiones et Philosophies dans lAsie Centrale (Paris,
1865+ many subsequent editions), made spirited and more than passing mention of the religion
of the Bab. He thus stimulated interest in the BabT rooted Baha'T religious movement which
ultimately promoted an anti-racist universal perspective highlighting the oneness of humankind.
It was this volume of Gobineau which first inspired the Cambridge scholar E. G. Browne (1862-
1926) to devote many years to the study of the Babi-AzalT and to a far lesser extent Bahl
religion.

The genius of the idiosyncratic 'Father of Islamic Studies', I gnaz Goldziher (1850-1921),
penned an occasional paper on matters BabT-Bahal. He had cordial association with 'Abbas
Effendi, 'Abd Al-Baha, the son and successor of Bah'-Allah. So too did his early mentor, the

vi
turkologist Armin Vambery (1832-1913), a Jewish-Hungarian linguist and one-time dervish
who ultimately considered himself a Bahal. This also became the professed religious
orientation of the Oxford Hebraist, Thomas K. Cheyne (1841-1915). The one time 'Oriel
Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture' at Oxford, Cheyne adopted the epithet Rahanf
("Spiritual") and authored a now largely forgotten Baha'T book, The Reconciliation of Races and
Religions (London: Adam & Charles Black, 1914).

Scholars, orientalists and academics of the subsequent couple of generations following
Browne's death, largely paid little or no attention to the BabT-Baha'T religions. This despite the
fairly impressive global diffusion and growth of Baha'T (now approx., 5-6 million, Smith,
1996:132). They tended to dismiss it as an insignificant outgrowth of Islam, an alien movement
or crankish faction neither exactly Islamic nor Christian and frequently attacked by narrow-
minded followers of both these world Faiths. It has largely been in the last few decades that
things have begun to change. There are now several professorships in Baha'T studies and a
growing number of lectureships in the subject in academically respectable universities including
the Hebrew University at Jerusalem.

BabT-Baha'T studies was a fairly respectable orientalist-academic pursuit from the 1860s
up till roughly the 1920s. The succeeding decades up to the 1960s were very largely a period
in which Baha'is were persecuted in the Middle East and, on the whole, no longer taken
particularly seriously in the West. The majority of Baha'Ts were heavily engaged in matters
evangelical. Intellectual adherents were generally marginalised or too ensconced in their own
academic or other careers (sometimes in the field of Iranian-Middle Eastern Studies) to give
sustained or serious attention to the academic analysis of their own Faith. Until recently few
built upon or scrutinized the findings of the above-mentioned pioneer orientalists. Very little
non-evangelical writing or research had, for practically 60 years, been published within or
without the Baha'T community.

It was largely amongst western Bahr intellectuals in Europe and America in the late
60s and early 70s that early glimmerings of an academic BabT-Bahal studies appeared. This

VII
was partly inspired by the example and writings of the academically oriented Baha'T historian
and apologist, Hasan M. Balyuzi (1908-1980). Through him British Baha'Ts became fascinated
with seemingly approachable aspects of BabT-Baha'T history. The largely historically oriented
legacy of Browne and others began to be pondered and critically assessed. Very little or no
attention was initially given, however, to the academic analysis of BabT-Baha'T religious doctrine,
to the intricacies of its theologized historiography, theology or theophanology. Few analysed
the Babi-Baha'T phenomenon and its sacred writ. Among the exceptions was the somewhat
unique 1923 Edinburgh University doctoral thesis of S. Alter entitled Studies in Bahaism.
This thesis attempts to research some aspects of the genesis of BabT-Baha'T religious doctrine,
the origins of its biblical citation and interpretation in the light of Isralliyyat (Israelitica); loosely,
Abrahamic biblical and related materials within Islamic sources.
• TERMINOLOGY AND ABBREVIATIONS.

In view of the existence of a myriad ShTrazTs of note, the name of Sayyid 'All Muhammad
ShTrazi (1819-1859 CE) will not be abbreviated in this manner. Rather, his well-known title the Bab
('The Gate') will be used (in bibliographical contexts Bab will occasionally be further abbreviated
as B*). MTrza usayn 'All NOrT (1817-1892) who came to be entitled Bah'-Allah (The Splendour
of God) and founded the Baha'T religion, will be abbreviated BA*. His eldest son and successor
'Abbas known as 'Abd al-Bah' (1844-1921) will be indicated by AB* and his great-grandson, the
Baha'T leader Shoghi Effendi (ShawqT Rabbani; c. 1896-1957) by SE*.
CALENDRAL AND GENERAL ABBREVIATIONS

Years will be given (when appropriate) according to the Islamic Hijri calendar followed by
a forward slash and then the corresponding date[s] of the Common Era. CE indicates the date
of the Common Era and AH (Anno Hegrie) that of the Muslim (lunar) calendar. The calendral
abbreviation BE will indicate the solar BabT-Baha'T or Badr (new) era which began in May
1260/1844 and is in use by contemporary Baha'Ts.

Viii
• GENERAL AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ABBREVIATIONS

A variety of general abbreviations will be used at various points throughout this thesis. Apart
from Heb. for Hebrew, Ar. for 'Arabic' and Per. for 'Persian' a few further examples are:
HB      =    - Hebrew Bible (Old Testament),              K.     =       Kitab (book..),
Kh.     =      Khutba (= Homily, Sermon),                 L.     =       Lawh (tablet),
NT      =      New Testament,                             Q.     =       Qur'an,
Sh.     =      Sharh (Commentary),                        T.     =       TafsTr (Commentary).

Abbreviations for periodicals and other sources, generally follow those set out in key
western academic literatures in the fields of Biblical, Iranian and Islamic studies e.g. the Anchor
Bible Dictionary (1: Iii-lxxxviii), Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation (xxi- xlviii); the Encyclopaedia
of Islam (2nd ed. 1:ix-xii) and Encyclopaedia Iran/ca (1:8-19). Most of these major abbreviations
are indicated alphabetically in the bibliographies (1-->3 p. 216ff ).

• Transliteration of Arabic and Persian.

The system of Arabic-Persian transliteration used throughout this thesis is essentially that
adopted in the Encyclopaedia of Islam 2 (-> El 2 ) except that all underlining is dropped, the letter
c is transliterated j (notj ) and "q" is used for j ( not "k"). The Persian termination 6 'ih' will

usually be used for distinctly Persian sources and names (as opposed to the Arabic a).
• Terminology: Islamo-biblical, Islamified, Islamicate.

Academic terminology expressive of the creative Islamic utilization and reinterpretation of
the' Bible and Abrahamic and other religious materials is undeveloped and inadequate. As
succinctly defined the following terms will be utilized here:
a) Islamo-biblical = Islamic citations or recreations of biblical data. Something Islamo-biblical may
express a conscious or unconscious Islamic assimilation of biblically rooted materials.
b) Islamicate or Islamified will be used to express aspects of the Islamic utilization of pre-Islamic
(Jewish, Christian, etc) religious and cultural materials.

Chapter One
ISRA'ILIYYAT: SOME ASPECTS OF THE ISLAMIC AND BABT-BAHM BACKGROUND

Sayyid 'AR Muhammad ShTrazT, the Bab ('the Gate'; 1819-1850 CE) and MTrza llusayn 'All
Nor!, entitled Bah'-Allah (= BA*, 'The Splendour of God', 1817-1892 CE) were contemporary
Iranian born messianic claimants who founded religious movements which have evolved into the
now globally diffused, neo-ShrT, Baha'T 'religion of the book'. The voluminous Arabic and Persian
Babi-Baha'T scripture which they set forth includes exegetical, prophetological and eschatological
themes and motifs. A proportion of this literature is directly or indirectly expository of the Bible and
the Qur'an (= Q.) as well as Isra'Tliyyat traditions expressive of motifs and themes originally Jewish
Christian or Abrahamic. While, as will be argued, the Bab made no direct use of the canonical
Bible, BA* and his successors evinced an increasingly detailed knowledge of the Bible. Post-BabT
Baha'T writers were progressively and more markedly influenced by the Bible though this text had
a relatively minor influence compared to the foundational Shi'T and associated Islamic universe
of discourse.

Of primary background importance to BabT-Baha'T scriptural studies is the Arabic Q. which
often reflects biblical material. This influential book was frequently cited as divine revelation by
the Bab and BA*. Both were born into Qajar ShrT families where at least the consciousness of its
importance and the rote learning of something of its contents was standard. The architects of the
BabT and Baha'T religions both show a wide knowledge of the Q. They produced sometimes neo-
qur'anic Arabic writings modelled upon it. Directly and allusively, often typologically and
allegorically, they commented upon the Q.; upon certain of its sOrahs, verses, words and/ or
letters, at times in a novel, rewritten or waly - 'revelation mode'. Their Arabic-Persian style was
much influenced by the content, vocabulary and rhyming prose of the Q. A good deal of BabT-
Baha'T prophetology and theophanology (Ar. maghariyya) is rooted in an exegesis of the often
biblically rooted prophetology of the Q. Many writings of the Bab and BA* draw upon and expound,
from a basically neo- or post-Shn standpoint, Islamic traditions which have a biblical-qur'anic
substrate.

Baha'i scripture seeks to re-interpret both the Bible and the Q. This in the light of its claim
to fulfill previous major Abrahamic eschatological expectations and extend the eternal religion of
God (= renewed "Islam"). While the writings of the Bab contain huge quantities of taisTr and Q.
influenced texts, those of BA* additionally contain numerous directly, biblically influenced
pericopae. Select extra-biblical, Islamo-biblical and other Abrahamic religious materials from
primitive Islamic times dubbed Isralliyyat (= "Israelitica") are likewise interpreted in novel ways.
The Bab, BA* and their successors creatively utilized and interpreted qur'anic and extra-qur'anic
motifs, pericopae and narratives collectively found in the Islamic qi;sa,s al-anbiya' (Stories of the
prophets) literatures. These prophetological materials are intimately related to and here
considered a part of the Isra'iliyyat stream of religious tradition.

The Bab and BA* were both influenced by aspects of the vast corpus of orthodox and
heterodox Islamic literatures which in one way or another contain, assimilate or expound pre-
Islamic scripture, legends of the prophets and associated materials. Dimensions of such Isra'iliyyat
materials pertinent to the background of this thesis will be selectively surveyed below (-->2.1ff).
The result %All be a source-critical trajectory wt-iNch             N.41\\ SCITM\VMS \0\\0n14   vatways c.\t.\de. cK
mainstream Sunni and even Shri Islamic norms. The complex, multi-faceted often Shri-Shaykhi
and associated background material demands this (—> 5.1f). Just as the non-mainstream,
'heterodox' Qumran and associated Jewish texts throw light on emergent Christianity, so does the
Babi-Baha'i religious 'universe of discourse' have key doctrinal roots in the byways of the Islamic
mystico-intellectual world. From time to time in this opening and the following chapters key Balza-

Baha'i hermeneutical and doctrinal teachings will also be summarily noted. First a few notes upon
the significance of the term Isralliyyat.
• 1. 1 Isralliyyat and its Islamic assimilation

". ), Isra'iliyyat (loosely, 'Israelitica'; sing. Isra'iliyya) is an Arabic
The Arabic plural ,..:14..,...
plural derived from the Hebrew proper name 7t.:2 -A' (yisra'èl, lit. 'contender with God'), namely (Ar.)
'I

Israll, the designation of the renamed Jacob, who was the father of the twelve tribes (Gen.
,        ...

32:28, 35:10). In its narrow sense it may indicate oral or written Islamic traditions thought to have
been transmitted by or derived from the "children of Israel" (banT isra71). More inclusively it can
indicate a range of biblical or Abrahamic scripture, folklore, hagiography and legend. The term
Isralliyyat indicates diverse traditions to a greater or lesser extent Islamicate ( = s Islamified') or
Islamo-biblical in the sense of having been doctrinally assimilated within Islam or exegetically
reinterpreted by Muslims.

The word Isra'Tliyyat has been in use since the early Islamic centuries when it initially had
purely descriptive and neutral connotations (Adang, 1996:9 fn. 49). In later centuries this word
came in some circles to be used pejoratively though this negative use of Isralliyyat was not and
never has been adopted universally in the Muslim world. In numerous Islamic sources Isra'iliyyat
has a long, disparate and not yet fully articulated semantic history. There is no standard, clear cut
or agreed upon Islamic or modern academic definition of Isra iTliyyat. In this thesis, as in much
modern academic writing, Isra'rliyyat will be used neutrally to indicate all manner of source
materials expressive of the Islamic adoption of biblical, extra-biblical, Abrahamic and related
religious materials of the kind registered in Muslim literary sources to be listed and partly discussed
below (--> 3.1ff).

Islamic Isra liliyyat traditions often originated with early converts to Islam from the
Abrahamic and related religions. Some derive from non-Muslim Arabs who had intimate contact
with Jews, Christians and other Abrahamic religionists (Vajda, El 2 IV:211). Jewish, Christian,
Manichean and other converts to Islam did not simply abandon their cherished sacred writings and
religious traditions. They often came to be assimilated into an Islamicate intellectual universe
where Jewish, Christian and other streams of scripture and tradition were assimilated and deemed
fulfilled; where proof-texts and eschatological traditions were given new dimensions of meaning.
Elements, for example, of biblical, pseudo-biblical, pseudepigraphical, and RabbiniC, (targumic,
midrashic and Talmudic, etc) thought were registered or reflected in the IsraiTliyyat traditions. So
too on occasion were apocryphal Gospel and other Christian materials assimilated within nascent

Islam (Hoyland 1997; Wasserstrom 1994). A dynamic and creative symbiosis between emergent
Islam and Abrahamic and associated religious ideas was a feature of early Islam that is reflected
in the Islamicate and Islamo-biblical Isra'iliyyat traditions (Wasserstrom, 1995).

• Early Muslim transmitters of Isralliyyat

From the early Islamic centuries charismatic and sometimes literate converts to Islam
became qussas (sing. qass), story-tellers or pious wu'azz(= "preachers", sing. wa'rz ). These
persons were basically popularises of Islamo-biblical or ultimately Islamicate stories which can
often be traced back to legends of the ahl al-kitab, the 'People of the Book' (= Jews and Christians,
etc) or the banT Isra71 (children of Israel = Jews). Though Muslim converts from the ahl al-kitab
sometimes perpetuated fantastic, entertaining myths, others were respected and influential
fountainheads of oral and literary Isra'Tliyyat. The qussas were important in the dissemination of
biblical and extra-biblical materials as well as Abrahamic and Persian-Zoroastrian, Manichean and
other materials into Islam. Through their storytelling they expounded and interpreted the
implications of the qur'anic and post-qur'anic Islamic message. This in the light of Abrahamic
scripture and tradition which they Islamified or made expressive of Islamic perspectives.'

It must suffice here to introduce three key figures among those who transmitted Isra'Iliyyat
from the earliest times. Still cited as authorities today in many parts of the Muslim world the
following persons lived during the period of emergent Islam. The Isra'iliyyat they creatively
transmitted was often attributed to Muhammad, certain of the Shn Imams, or to other worthies of
the first Islamic centuries. It helped shape centuries of Islamic attitudes towards pre-Islamic
scripture and the s peop- le of the Book'. The following three persons were among those especially

important as transmitters of Isra'Iliyyat.1

[1] AbO Ishaq Ka'b al-Ab bar b. Mati s (d. c. 32 / 652)

Possibly a Yemenite Rabbi and Jewish convert to Islam, Ka . b al-Ah bar is said to have
"read and explained the Torah in the mosque of Medina" (Adang, 1996:8). He is believed to have
written such now lost works as a 'Book on Adam and Eve'; 'The Tradition of Dho'l-Kifl'; a STrat al-
lskandar (The Story of Alexander) and the Wafat Masa (Passing of Moses). Ibn 'Abbas and Abo
Hurayra (d. c. 58/678) were allegedly among his pupils. They transmitted a very large body of
tradition (esp. from 'Abd-Allah b. Salam) which falls within the category of Isralliyyat.2

[2] 'Abd Allah b. Salam al-klarith ( d. 43/ 663-4)

A Medinan Jew of Meccan origin, 'Abd-Allah b. Salami converted to Islam after the Hijra. He
is said to have aided Muhammad "in obtaining correct biblical information from the Rabbis" (Abbott
1977). The Prophet is said to have promised him a place in paradise. To him are attributed books
on magic and amulets as well, for example, as 'Traditions from the Book of Daniel'. Numerous
Islamicate, Isralliyyat traditions originated with him. They were often relayed by the prolific
traditionalist Anas b. Malik (d. Basra., c. 91-3/709-11?). Clusters of traditions including an important
K al-Masa91 ('Questions and Answers') text are attributed to this key transmitter of Isra'iliyyat.
He figured as an archetypal, Jewish convert to Islam (Sezgin, GAL 1:304; Horovitz, El 2 1:52;
Wasserstrom 1995:175-8).

i

In addition to these three transmitters of Isralliyyat numerous other figures could be listed.

Space prevents details being given, for example, about the illiterate though knowledgeable (in the Torah
and other areas) companion of Muhammad ('Abd Shams =) Abn Hurayra (d. c. 58/678), Ubayy b. Ka'b
c. 21/641 ?) a convert from Judaism and 'Abd-Allah b. 'Amr b. Al-'As (d. c. 66/685?) who allegedly "read
Syriac, engaged in theological discussions with converts and had extensive knowledge of the Talmud"
(Newby, 1980:687).

See H. Schmitz, El II:582-3+bib.; Sezgin, GAL 1:304-5; Nagel, 1967:60f; Juynboll, 1969; Khoury,
1972; Halperin, 1982; Brinner, EAL 2:421; Donner, 1998:299.

[3] AbO sAbd-Allah Wahb b. Munabbih (b. Sana c. 34 / 654-5 -d. c.110 / 728 or 114 / 732?)

Probably another Yemenite Jew of Persian descent, Wahb was an important authority on
Abrahamic scripture and legend, especially South Arabian lore. Though perhaps another name for
part of his K al-mubtada'(Book of Creation'), K al-Isra'Iliyyat is the title of one of his several
lost books (Dud, 1983:128f). It appears to have been a work whose contents were acquired from
Yemenite Jewish hakhamim and Christians (Hirschberg, EJ16:241-2). These works of Wahb b.
Munabbih are attested as early as 229/843-4 (Rosenthal, 1968:335 fn.2) and in even earlier
streams of the Tafsir tradition . Other works evidence his wide interest in Isralliyyat as Abrahamic
fables, folklore and history. Among works ascribed to him is a Ilikmat ("Wisdom book")
associated with the sage Luqman, a version of the Zabür (Psalter) entitled Mazamir Dawad
(Psalms of David) and a aSas. al-anbiya' (Stories of the Prophets) work.

Also attributed to Wahb b. Munabbih is a Tafsir (Q. commentary) and a Sirat al-nabf
(Treatise on the Life of the Prophet), a Maghav Rasrll Allah (Account of military expeditions of
the Messenger of God) and a compilation entitled K al-qadr (Book of Destiny). A recension of his
K al-MulOk .. min Ijimyar... (The Book of the Himyarite Kings...) by Ibn Hisharn, known as the K
al-Tijan f i mulak al-Hirnyar (The Book of the Crowned Kings of the Himyarites) has been described
as "a rich mine of Arabian fable, legend and garbled chronicles" in which may be seen "the
powerful influence of Rabbinical, Syriac and Persian lore in both poetry and prose." (Norris, CHAL
1:385). Muhammad is said to have stated that God bestowed iiikma (wisdom) upon Wahb b.
Munabbih (I bn Sa'cl, Tabaqat, V:395). Numerous respected Muslim authorities, including Ibn
Isbaq, al-Tabari and al-Kisa'T cite him approvingly though some modern Muslim anti-Isralliyyat
authorities regard him as unreliable. Adang has recently referred to Wahb b. Munabbih as the
"foremost transmitter of biblical narratives" (1996:10).1

• 1.2 Positive and negative early Islamic / Shn attitudes towards Isralliyyat

> So, if thou art in doubt regarding what We have sent down to thee ask those who
> recite the Book before thee (tr., Arberry) (Q.10:94).

In certain early, allegedly prophetic traditions, the Muslim appropriation of material from the
banT Isra'TI ("children of Israel" = the Isra'iliyyat traditions) is viewed as perfectly acceptable.
(Goldziher,1902; Kister, 1972). Existing in different forms in a wide range of early Islamic works
including the JamT of Ma s mar b. Rashid (d.154/ 770), the Risala of al-Shafri (d. 204/820), the
Musnad of Al? mad b. 11 anbal (d. 241/ 855) and the Sahlb? of al-Bukhari (d.256 /870), it is
reported that Muhammad stated, according to one positive version of the tiaddithe an banfisra7la
("Narrate from the children of Israel!"),

> Transmit of my [prophetic] authority be it even one verse [from the Q.], narrate
> [traditions] concerning the children of Israel [1.7addith0 'an banT 'Saga ] and there
> is nothing objectionable [in that]; he who [intentionally] tells a lie on my authority --
> let him take his place in hell... (tr. Kister 1972:215-6)

Versions of this tiadith were widely circulated and variously understood by Muslim writers. At
times it was a directive which formed part of a complex O&M bidding the faithful to (a) transmit
qur'anic verses and (b) narrate traditions concerning the "children of Israel" but not to c) lie when
transmitting traditions from Muhammad (Kister, ibid, 217). On the authority of AbO Hurayra a
variant of this tradition was recorded to the effect that when asked whether Muslims should narrate
stories about the children of Israel, Muhammad replied,

> Narrate concerning them, there are always [Islamic?] things which are more
> wonderful (Kister, ibid.,218-9).

Another positive version of this haddithil 'an ban' isra-Tla reads, "Transmit on my authority be it
even one verse and narrate concerning the Children of Israel and there is nothing objectionable (in
that)" (cited Kister 1972:217).1

'Particularly ecumenical is the following prophetic tradition, 'Believe in the Torah, the ZabOr
[Psalter] and the Evangel, but the Qur'an should suffice you (lbn KathTr, TafsTr [1:329-330] in Kister,
For some early Muslims these and similar traditions legitimized the whole scale
incorporation of Isra'iliyyat traditions into Islam. Converts to Islam from the "people of the Book"
were free to disseminate and incorporate the Isralliyyat heritage. Key figures of later generations
often followed their example and Isra'iliyyat appear in a very wide range of Islamic literatures (--
>2.1ff). The term Isralliyyat is used positively, for example, by the historian Ibn KhaldOn (d.
808/1406) in his famous Muqaddima... (Prolegomena [to History] Muqaddimah, 15, tr. Rosenthal,
1:19f) 1 and by the Persian Sunni scholar Fadl-Allah b. Rozbihan Khunji-Isfahani (d.927/1521) in his
systematization of history, the Ta'rilfh-i 'a/am ara-yi AminT (Khunji-Isfahani, ed. Woods, 1992:9,
[Per.] 88).

• Shrism and narration from the barn' Isra71 ( "children of Israel").

Widely read in the Islamic east, the third volume of the detailed history K. al-Bad' wal
ta'rfkh (The Book of Creation and History, written c. 355/966) of the Shi s l historian Mutahhar b.
Tahir al-Maqdisi (fl. 3rd/l0th cent.) cites a positive version of the haddithu 'an banf isrS7 I , "Narrate
from the children of Israel without hesitation (la haraja)': This in the context of his discoursing
upon the miracles of Moses and the wonders of the children of Israel (K. Bad' III:93f). Maqdisi
records a great deal of Isra'iliyyat and other details of Abrahamic religion and history (Adang,
1996:48-50;84-7;126-31;233-4). So too the biblically learned Shi s i historians al-Ya'q obi (d.c.
292/905) and al-Mas'Odi (d. 345/956) (-->3.1).

The weighty Bihar al anwar of the Shi'i polymath and one time Shaykh al-Islam,
Muhammad Baqir Majlisi (d.1111 /1699) does not contain especially negative forms of the
hadditha 'an banT isra-Tla or register trenchantly anti-Isralliyyat traditions (Bihar 2 14:494f). A
fairly positive version of the tradition about narrating from the Israelites going back to the Prophet
through Ja`far al-Sadiq is cited by Majlisi in his Bihar al-anwar from the 04sas al-anbiya' work of

According to some mss of this work the author did not accept the literal sense of the talyif
("corruption") of the Torah (see ibid).

Qutb al-Din al-Rawandi (d. Qumm, 573/1177). It is included in a section of the K Nubuwwa
headed nawadir akhbar barn' Isra71 ("The curiosities of the narrations regarding the children of
Israel") (Bibar2 14:486ff). With a few minor variants, the recent printing of the al;Sat3 of al-Rawandi
(1409/1989—> bib.) contains this tradition in division five of its 9th section headed fi banT Isar'
(On the children of Israel) (al-Rawandi, Qisas,187). It is cited from an unspecified work of Ibn
Babnya (4.2-->) as transmitted through his father back through a certain 'Abd al-A s la b. As yun who
is said to have informed AbT 'Abd-Allah (= Ja'far al-Sadiq) that a tradition (hadith) had been
transmitted by the people (al-nas = Sunnis?) to the effect that the messenger of God [Muhammad]
said, "Narrate from the children of Israel (haddathird 'an bani isra7la ) and without hesitation (la
haraja)". Imam al-Sadiq affirmed that this was the case without further comment. The tradition,
however, continues thus:

> I said [to Ja s far al-Sadiq], 'So is it the case that we should transmit from the children
> of Israel and should not discount this testimony?'. He [Ja'far al-Sadiq] said, 'Have
> you not heard what he [Muhammad] said?', Man is the best liar if he transmits
> everything he hears'. Then I said, how is that? He [Ja sfar al-Sadiq] replied, 'It may
> not be [contained] in the Book (= Q ?) but be something [sanctioned] among the
> children of Israel, so transmit what belongs to this community and don't hesitate
about it" (Bibar2 14:494-5).

MajlisT himself found it necessary to attempt clarification of this somewhat ambiguous
tradition apparently legitimizing Isra'Tliyyat transmission from the banT Isra7I(Jews). He appended
several interpretations to it (Bibar2 14:495). He first cites a certain Jazri who explained that such
transmission from Jews is perfectly acceptable as long as it is an accurate transmission and is not
relayed through aberrant persons. The tradition obviously gives legitimacy to Shi'T Muslims
transmitting from Jews, in relaying, it appears, Isra'iliyyat traditions. This Shri version may be
contrasted with the often more negative Sunni versions of the hadith.

The question of the specifically Shi s i position(s) regarding Isra'iliyyat, biblical tahrff
("corruption") and related matters needs detailed investigation and is beyond the scope of this

thesis though some further notes will be sketched in subsequent chapters (esp. 5.2). 1 It can be
noted though, that a proportion of ShI s T thinkers from both early and later times held back from
viewing pre-Islamic scripture and tradition as absolutely corrupted. Numerous ShT'T writers had
a tremendous openness towards the assimilation of biblical texts and Isra'Tliyyat traditions (—>4.2f).
Records of the INlhajat (Religious Disputations), the debates of the (twelver) Imams, the ahl al-
kitab and others show the considerable and positive by the Imams of Abrahamic scripture and
tradition. From the earliest times (proto-) Shn writers seem to have delighted in finding a nexus
of typological intimations and prophetic testimonies to their Shn beliefs and practices in the Bible
and Isra'Tliyyat. They held that Shn perspectives were upheld and intimated in pre-Islamic
scripture. It was assumed in the interests of apologetics that the pre-Islamic age was really a proto-
Shn era. ShT'T Islam existed from primordial times as evidenced in ancient history and biblical
scripture. Isra'Tliyyat materials and biblical texts were drawn upon within Shi s ism in order to
highlight an allegedly ancient Shrite wisdom. Developed BabT-Baha'T globalism and ecumenism
owes a good deal to the openness of Sufi and ShT'T thinkers.2

• Muslim opposition to Isra'Tliyyat traditions.

Bypassing the implications of Q.10:94 (cited above) other pious Muslims were not at all
well-disposed towards Isra'iliyyat traditions. They gave weight to negative versions of the
haddllho 'an barn" isra71 (Narrate from the children of Israel) and other more explicitly restrictive
traditions. It came to be believed in pietist, orthodox circles that the acceptance of traditions from

Until recently academics have paid scant attention to the specifically Shn assimilation of the
Bible and Isra'Tliyyat. Aside from various 1909 -10 articles by I. Friedlander, a 1915 article by Aichle (--->
bib.) and occasional articles touching upon this subject by Vajda (1941-5,1981), Ayoub (1976); Rubin
(1979), Kohlberg (1980 [rep.1991:XVI), Thomas (1988), Lassner (1993; 993a), Wasserstrom (1995) and
Moreen (1999) little seems to have been written.

At this point it should be noted that while the largely unchanged massive 1993 2nd edition of the
Lughat-AMmah of 'AIT Akbar Dekhoda (d.Tehran 1956) includes a very basic, only slightly dismissive
definition of 'Isra'Tliyyat (Ed. 2 2:1924), the even more recent, ShT'T centred and very bulky Persian DaYrat

buzurg-I ('Great Islamic Encyclopaedia', Tehran, 1998>) contains a substantial entry
'Isral1[iyyatr which includes a thorough overview of Isra'Tliyyat seen as a technical term in the realm of
tafsir and 1.7adith studies (vol. 8:290-4).

the unbelieving "people of the Book" was something unwise or interdicted (Kister, 1972, esp. 234f;
Montgomery-Watt, 1956[7]; 60-62). The sources confirm an early Muslim reaction against an
increasing tendency to accept guidance from Jews and Christians seen as unbelieving purveyors
of possibly "corrupt" non-qur'anic scripture. In allegedly prophetic traditions and writings influenced
thereby, grave misgivings were voiced regarding Isra'fiiyyat materials. One such tradition reported
through Zayd b. Aslam has the prophet state,

> Do not ask the people of the Book (ahl al-kitab ) about anything, because they will
> not show you the right path having already led themselves astray.'
The companion Ibn Mas s Od similarly reported from the prophet:

> Do not ask the people of the Book [ ahl al-latab, Jews and Christians] about anything
> [in (a fair] for they will not guide you aright, seeing they have misled themselves,
> and you will (find yourselves) disbelieving something true and believing something
> false (trans. Montgomery Watt, 1957:61 citing Jamr bayan al-71m of Ibn 'Abd al-
Barr [d.463/1070]).

These negative, restricting traditions were generally ineffective (so Kister, 1972). They did,
however, lead to the expression of caution; especially with reference to TafsTr (Q. commentary).
Summing this matter up Brinner has written,

> The Muslim collectors of the stories (Qisas al-anbiya') often state the line of
> transmission of a given tale or version as going back to early Jewish converts to
> Islam. This gave rise to a labelling of such tales as israrliyyai, a term that took on
> a rather negative aspect with the flourishing of a brilliant Islamic civilization
> connected with the vast, wealthy and powerful early 'Abbasid caliphate. Becoming
> culturally self- assured and independent, the •u/ama' tended to discourage and
> even to forbid recourse to non-Muslim sources (Brinner, EAL2:466).

Though they failed to inhibit the transmission of Isralliyyat, these negative opinions had a
continuing effect. Even the ecumenically and mystically inclined Ibn al-'Arabi (d. 638/1240) —
whose writings are rich in gnostically interpreted Isralliyyat themes and motifs -- in his
encyclopaedic Fut01.7.11 al-makklyya (Meccan Illuminations) has a section (in the 0.Yahya edition)
headed, 'The [use of the] narratives of the Jews in commentary upon the Qur'an: the Isralliyyat'.
In the light of authoritative texts he warns the mufassiran (Q. exegetes) against giving precedence
to Jewish traditions or Israelite prophets (al-anbiya' al-isra71/yyTn) thereby confounding the

Questioned further, Muhammad allegedly added, "Narrate [about the children of Israel], there
is nothing objectionable [in that]." Seeking guidance from the "people of the Book" is wrong but narrating
things about them is not (see Kister, ibid, 219).

authoritative guidance of Muhammad :

whoso has expounded the Qur'an by means of the traditions of the Jews (bi-
> rawayat al-yahad) has assuredly gainsaid the directive of the Messenger of God
> (amrrasOlAllah) and whoso goes against the Messenger of God [Muhammad] has
> gainsaid the very command of God... (Futuhat-Y 14:217-8/ Futuhat 11:00000).

It was within 14th century Sunni tafsTr (exegetical) and related circles that the term
Isralliyyat came be used highly dismissively. This negative attitude is evident in writings of the
polymathic controversialist TaqT al-Din Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 728 /1328) and in those of his pupil and
associate Ibn KathIr (d. 774/1373). These pious Muslims generally considered Isralliyyat traditions
unsound, extraneous materials related by unseemly heretics among the misguided 'people of the
Book' (lbn Kathir, al-Bidaya.. 1:5-6; Tafsir 1:12f; Rippin, 1993; s TafsTr' El 2 X:85).1

An apparently early, not wholly dismissive attitude towards Isralliyyat traditions, is seen in
Ibn Taymiyya's succinct, hermeneutical treatise Muqaddimaton usül al-tafsir (Treatise on the
Principles of Tafsir). Here he noted that the companions of the Prophet legitimately recounted
traditions from the ahl al-kllab (people of the Book). Permission was granted to "narrate [traditions]
from the Banu Isra'TI (Children of Israel) without constraint" (citing Bukhari, trans. McAuliffe, [in
Renard ed.]1982: 35-43). Ibn Taymiyya comments on this by stating that Isra'iliyyat may be used
for the "purposes of attestation" but not "as a basis of belief". He viewed Isra'Tliyyat as of three
kinds, those [1] satiTh (sound) or [2] kadliTh (unsound) and those [3] maskuranhu (ambiguous,
or of uncertain veracity) (ibid, 38; cf. Bosworth 1982,1995:175).

Towards the beginning of his massive history al-Bidaya wa g mhayah , Ibn Kathir again
quotes a version of the haddith0 'an banT isra71 from the SOO of al-Bukhari (K al-shahadat,
no. 29) which he immediately follows with this negative remark:

> So he [Muhammad] was burdened (mahmal) with respect to the IsraThyyat. In our
> opinion they are a cause of uncertainty. Wherefore it is neither within our power to
> affirm nor to deny them and it is thus that we operate in this our book... (al-Bidaya..

al-SakhawT (d.902/1497) like certain other late medieval commentators and historians, was ill-
disposed towards fanciful Isralliyyat communicated by over imaginative storytellers or derived from the
'people of the Book' (Plan b/'/-tawbiti.. tr. Rosenthal, 1968:335; cf. Vajda,          EI2 IV:2110.

> 1:5-6).

In the prolegomenon to his huge TafsTr al-qur'an al-azTm, Ibn Kathir cites hadIth about
Isralliyyat deriving from the "people of the Book" and, like Ibn Taymiyya, enumerates three kinds
of Isralliyyat when considering 'The most favourable modes of exegesis (al-tafsTr).' Like his
master he reckoned three kinds of Israelite traditions (al-ahadfth al-isra'Tliyyah) for "such as
consider evidence" (al-ishtishahad). They are [1] expressive of "strong faith" (al-rtiqad)which are
sahrh (sound), [2] those demonstrably false and [3] those which pose unresolvable questions
even for the 'ulama' of the 'people of the Book'. A few examples of this third type of Isralliyyat
are given. They may, for example, detail the names and exact number of the ashab al-kahf
(Companions of the cave', Q.18:9ff) or of the colour of their dog (lbn KathTr, TafsTr, 1:12-14).
Elsewhere in his TafsTr Ibn KathTr actually forbids the consultation of allegedly corrupted pre-
Islamic scripture:

> Some of the Isra'Tliyyat were invented by some of their zanadiqa [heretics]; some
> of them may be sound, but we do not need them: what is written in the Book of God
> [Q.] is sufficient for us and we do not need to look for it in the remaining books
> [dating] before it; neither God nor his Messenger caused us to lack their knowledge
> (TafsTr IV.282 trans. Kister 1972:237).

Despite these predominantly negative attitudes towards Isralliyyat their whole scale
abandonment was never systematically achieved in the Islamic world. Like numerous other
Muslim writers, the works of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn KathTr themselves relayed numerous "sound"
and "ambiguous" Isra iTliyyat traditions.

In recent times some Sunni (e.g. Egyptian) Muslims, influenced by the above attitudes,
have come to view Isra'Tliyyat extremely negatively. Isra lTliyyat are viewed as spurious traditions
stemming from subversive Jews intending to undermine Islam (Juynboll, 1969). In such Muslim
circles today Isralliyyat indicates nothing but "superstitious nonsense" (Adang: 1996:9 fn. 47). In
recent decades a number of Egyptian and other Muslim thinkers have defined and used the term

Isra7liyyat with extreme contempt: especially as a result of anti-Jewish sentiments following
Middle-East conflicts. Many anti-Israeli [Semitic] examples, can be seen in the proceedings of

the al-Azhar sponsored, Cairo located 'Fourth Conference of the Academy of Islamic Research'
(Sept. 1968; not long after the Arab-Israeli war of 1967). 1 Several of these aforementioned
conference papers touch directly and very critically upon the Bible and Isralliyyat traditions.               2

• 1.3 Modern academic definitions and discussion of Isra'Tliyyat

Over the last century or more modern academic Islamicists have variously defined and
discussed Isra'lliyyat . Among western educated Islamicists there are the classic discussions of
Isralliyyat by Goldziher (esp.1902 ) and Goitein (1935) and a considerable number of important,
more recent contributions only a few of which can be summed up here.

Nagel in his 1967 thesis Die qsas al-Anbiya' equates q4sas al-anbiya' with 'biblical
legends' which include Isralliyyat stories. In his view, however, only those specifically and
restrictively dealing with the Israelites between the death of Moses and the Israelite entry into the
promised land are considered Isra'iliyyat (1967:66). This position is not wholly in line with many
Muslim statements about the nature and contents of the Isra'Tliyyat traditions. Sayings of Jesus,
for example, are cited in Islamic sources as being among the Isrä'Tliyyat. Such sayings are, for
example, cited in Islamic sources as coming from the Traditiones isradliticae, the Israelite traditions,
as Asin et Palacios translated al-Isra'lliyyat, into Latin in his learned Logia et Agrapha Domini
Jesu, 1946:415, 423).

Vajda, in his 1978 El 2 entry 'Isra'iliyyat' (IV:211-212) more adequately gives Isralliyyat a

Various records of the proceedings were produced (3 Arabic vols. 1970 + 1 English vol. of
935pp.) as well as an independent English summary with extracts from the 1970 English volume by D.
Green entitled, 'Arab Theologians on Jews and Israel' (Geneva, [19721, 74).

A certain Muhammad 17Iusayn al-DhahabT, for example, delivered a paper which seems to be
identical with the several times separately published volume, al-Isra'iliyyattn-tafsTrwe'l-hadith (Jamasat
al-Azhar/ Majma' al-bul) oth al-Islamiyya, 1391/1971+ 4th printing, 1991). A recently publishdd al-Azhar
sponsored though somewhat mangled 'translation' of Ibn Kathir's 'Ciiisas al-anbiya' ('Stories of the
Prophets') also, for example, contains some fairly trenchant anti-Bible statements (introduction, xii-xiii,
etc). In 1992 there appeared the useful volume ablsra'ilinfat wa7-mawo'Clat IT kutub al-tafsfr by
Muhammad Abo Shahaba which continues in much the same vein and registers some interesting
dimensions of Isra'rliyyat which occur in Sunni hadith compilations and Tafsir literatures.

broad and inclusive definition. For him it indicates "an Arabic term covering three kinds of
narratives, which are found in commentators on the Kur'an, the mystics, the compilers of edifying
stories and writers on various levels". 1 In the widely acclaimed and previously drawn upon study
of the hadith about transmitting from the banT israTI Kister gives a more comprehensive
viewpoint of the contents of Is/ea-MTN,

Another later article by the same writer further includes within the body of Isra i Tliyyat those
traditions and texts celebratory of Jerusalem, the Fadg 'il bayt al-maqdis (Praises of the Sanctified
House [Jerusalem] (Kister, 1981:185-6).

Hasson identifies Isra'iliyyat with biblical quotations and "Traditions dealing with Jews and
Christians" (Hasson, 1981:174). In her Women in the Qur'an, Stowasser similarly used the
phrase "Bible-related traditions" for Isra'iliyyat (1994:22). Firestone in his 1990 Journeys in Holy
Lands also noted that "Muslim writers occasionally refer to certain narrative traditions treating pre-
Islamic biblical and extra-biblical characters as Israelite Tales (Israiliyyat)". He adds that this term
is best defined as "of Israelite origin" though such traditions in their Islamicate versions come to
transcend their origins (1990:13ff cf.183 fn. 5). Lazarus-Yafeh in her Intertwined Worlds indicates
that Isra'iliyat may constitute "Biblical and Midrashic material" or "alleged quotations from the
Bible" (1991:112,114).

Vajda goes on to define "three kinds of narratives" as [1] "Narratives regarded as historical"

> serving to complement and clarify summary qur'anic information touching upon biblical personalities; [2]
> "Edifying narratives" loosely set within the framework of the "period of the (ancient) Israelities"; [3] "Fables
> belonging to folklore, allegedly (but sometimes actually) borrowed from Jewish sources" -- often not too
distinct from [2] above ('lsralliyyat' El 2 IV:211-2).

In Between Muslim andJew(1995) Wasserstrom at one point states, "Generally speaking
Isralliyyat are the manifold and miscellaneous traditions that the early Muslim community received,
through various channels, from the Banu Israll, the "Children of Israel".. from Judaism and, to a
lesser extent, from Christianity... Isralliyyat were more than merely superstitious, popular
legends.." (1995:172). He cites approvingly an article of Bosworth ( The Concept of Dhimma..1982)
which underlines the applicability of Isralliyyat to Jewish, Christian and other streams of influence
which were legitimately embraced in Islam. Wasserstrom has it that "..lsralliyyat provides us with
a clear case of open, acknowledged, and religiously condoned borrowing" (1995:173).

In her Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible. Adang touches upon the
relationship between Qi;sas al-anbiya' and Isralliyyat. She follows Khoury in finding a "very thin"
line between these terms and uses Isra'iliyyat "to indicate the whole genre of Islamicized biblical
legends" (1996:8-10). Brinner's succinct yet comprehensive entry s lsra'iliyyat in the second volume
of the Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature (ed Meisami, 1998) somewhat literally translates
Isralliyyat with 'Israelite matters'. That it had neutral and pejorative senses is noted as is the fact
that the term generally refers to "stories based on material of ancient Israelite (i.e. Biblical) origin".

Nettler in a 1998 consideration of 'Early Islam, Modern Islam and Judaism: The Isralliyyat
in Modern Islamic Thought' like most others focuses upon SunnT Islam. He explores the
intertwining of ideas, history and politics in his excellent reconsideration of the Isralliyyat. An early
religious "cosmopolitanism" among the various religious traditions came to be eclipsed by an actual
or imagined consciousness of "borrowing" and being "borrowed" from: "The Isralliyyat most
certainly derived from this milieu" (1998:3). The Isralliyyat within Islam betoken "Islamic-Jewish
cultural interaction and symbiosis which implicitly overrode the built-in monotheistic exclusivism
on both sides.." (ibid).1

Nettler's insightful article provides an excellent basis for understanding the roots of Isralliyyat
and articulates a balanced mode of critiquing modern Sunni ( especially Egyptian) anti-Isra'tlyyat and its
occasionally extreme, allegedly proto-Zionist roots.The positive Bahal attitude towards pre-Islamic faiths
and towards Palestine-Israel also contrasts markedly with modern ShT'Tte anti-Zionist polemic.

McAuliffe in her 'Assessing the Isra'Tliyyat: An exegetical conundrum' (Leder ed. 1998:345-
369) recognises the fluidity of definitions of Isra'iliyyat and the 20th century attention this matter has
received. Discussing various definitions she notes that Isralliyyat may signify actual written texts
(cf. Wahb b. Munabbih <--) indicative of a genre of Islamic literature or a particular non- isnad -
laden "generalized corpus of oral and written material that is distinguished less by its content than
by its ascription". This writer yet favours the translation "Jewish memorabilia"; a translation also
occasionally used by Lassner in his Demonizing the Queen of Sheba (1993:121; McAuliffe,
1998:346). Bernstein in an essay in honour of William Brinner translates Isra'Tliyyat as "Israelite
material" or "Israelitica". This he succinctly refers to as "material included in the Islamic traditions
about biblical characters and events" (Hary ed. 2000:157, cf. also index Isra'Iliyyat).

In the Studies in Islamic and Middle Eastern Texts and Traditions in Memory of Norman
Calder (ed. Hawting, et. al.), P. S. Alexander in his 'Jewish Tradition in Early Islam: the case of
Enoch/ldris' (2000) identifies the Isra'iliyyat as expressions of "Jewish tradition" in "early Islamic
sources, starting with the Qur'an itself" (2000:11). He clarifies this by writing, "I use Isralliyyat not
in any negative sense, but simply as a convenient designation for all those elements in the Qur'an,
Tafsir and hadith which have clear parallels in Jewish sources". This usage, he as serts,
"corresponds to the older use of the word [Isra'iliyyat] in Islamic sources". Alexander not only
acknowledges that Jewish traditions influenced nascent Islam but highlights the fact that Islamic
sdurces had an impact upon such Jewish works of the midrashic Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer and the
writings of Saadya Gaon (fl. 9th cent. CE) (2000:11+fn.1,13).

Finally, though not exhaustively, it might be noted that Moreen has referred to
Is[h]rnalliyyat (= loosely, Ishmaelitica), the reverse phenomenon indicated by Isralliyyat which
she defines as "Islamic lore penetrating Jewish midrashic and literary texts" (Moreen, 2000:185f),
the importance of which has been underlined by Alexander and others (2000:12-13).though the
Jewish intertextual penetration of Islamic sources is undoubtedly significant as expressed by the
neologism "Ismaelitica", no such term could be so easily coined for the Isralliyyat (Israelitica) and

Is[h]rnalliyyat (I smaelitica) intertextual penetration and reinterpretation within Babi-Baha'T
scriptural sources.

• 1.4 Isra'iliyyat and its Babi-Bahal assimilation and exegesis

The various modern, academic discussions of Isra"Tliyyat ( "Israelitica") are both helpful
and somewhat disorienting. In its wider senses it is now evident that Isra iTliyyat indicates more
than "Jewish memorabilia", as it is sometimes translated. In view of the wide, often extra-Judaic
senses Isra'iliyyat has appropriated in a wide range of Islamic sources, this rendering seems
restrictive for a term virtually synonymous with the modern expression "Abrahamic" 1 . This since
Isra'iliyyat can indicate Jewish, Christian, Islamo-biblical and/ or Islamicate streams of tradition
often but not always relayed by Jewish (banT Isra71) and other converts to Islam among the ahl al-
kitab (people of the Book) and others.

In Islamic sources the Isralliyyat traditions and motifs to a greater or lesser degree,
express an Islamo-biblical or Islamicate perspective. In their post-Jewish/Christian hermeneutical
and religious context they encapsulate a distinctly Islamic mode of discourse. While Jewish
materials ("memorabilia") sometimes predominate, the term "Abrahamic" perhaps more befittingly
sums up the range of Isra'Tliyyat materials contained in the various literatures representative of the
Isralliyyat traditions ( cf Adang, 1996:8-10).

In this thesis ( as already indicated) Isra'iliyyat will largely have its wide and inclusive
sense. It will denote the whole range of orthodox and heterodox Abrahamic scripture, Islamo-
biblical texts, legends and traditions found within Islamic literatures. Prior to its later, post-
Baghdad (post-1860s) Bahal development, Babi-Baha'T Arabic and Persian scriptural sources cite,
incorporate and interpret Islamo-biblical citations and other Isra'iliyyat rooted motifs and traditions.

> I
> Loosely speaking, the term "Abrahamic" can indicate religious traditions and practises in one
way or another believed (according to salvation history or heiro-history) to stem from Abraham (fl. 2,100
BCE??) and his progeny, especially Isaac the symbolic forbear of Judaism & Christianity and Ishmael
the symbolic father of the Arabs, Muhammad and Islam.

Abrahamic traditions or Isralliyyat materials were adopted, assimilated and 'Islamified'

by Muslims. The Isra'Tliyyat motifs and traditions might be deemed Islamicate (to utilize terminology
initially coined by M. Hodgson) in that they are Jewish and or Christian rooted materials that have
become distinctly Islamic. Abrahamic traditions contained within the Isralliyyat often, to a greater
or lesser degree, shift from being in some sense Jewish or Christian to being conceptually or
hermeneutically Islamic. Then, when subject to Babi-Baha'i (re-) interpretation, another
intertextual shift in their hermeneutical universe of discourse has taken place.

Some Islamic isra s ("night ascent") and related mrraj (lit, ladder" = "ascension") traditions,
for example, are Isralliyyat in the sense of being Jewish / Christian informed elaborations of
Q.17:1ff (and related texts, cf. 53:1f, 83:19f). When subjected to BabT-Bahal, essentially neo or
post-Islamic interpretations, they express a Babi-Bahal viewpoint. The masfid al-aqsa
(Furthermost Mosque) motif of the Islamic mrraj traditions, for example, in developed Baha'i
texts is no longer a Jerusalem locale (nigh the qubbat al-sakhra a-- "dome of the rock") but the
Acre-Haifa located celestial Haykal ("Temple") of the person of BA* (or the shrine of the Bab;
BA* AQA 4:176-7; AQA 5:29; cf. B* QA 68:274; 91:364; R. Jasad.).

One time Isra'iliyyat and associated materials become textually Babi-Bahal through the
exegetical revelations of the Bab and BA*. Identifying and analysing such traditions source-
critically and in terms of their new hermeneutical, doctrinal and apologetic or theological
characteristics, lies at the heart of this thesis. The intertextual shifts undertaken by religious motifs
and blocks of tradition are sometimes such that they span several religious traditions: from their
Jewish roots to possibly Christian and then Islamicate-Muslim to Baba and for Baha'T post-Islamic
expository levels. A tradition or motif from being Jewish might become in some sense Christian
then be distinctly Islamo-biblical or Islamicate. Such materials may thus also be seen to have

I
subsequently appropriated post-Islamic senses in Babi-Bahal sacred literatures.

In the following paragraphs and chapters it will be seen how widespread and deep rooted

was the SunnT and ShT'T Islamic reinterpretation of biblical and Isra'Tliyyat traditions. The post-
Islamic BabT-Bahal phenomena are recent examples of religious movements which have
reinterpreted and assimilated Isra'iliyyat. They have refashioned Abrahamic religious traditions
and assimilated Islamicate Bible citations. Isralliyyat traditions are often allegorically reinterpreted
in BabT-Baha'T sources. They are sometimes demythologized in a rationalist, neo-Shn, BabT-
Baha'T religious sense. Babi-Bahal scripture sometimes exhibits exegetical demythologization as
well as exegetical re-mythologization (to draw on Bultmannian rooted terminology).

The remythologization of Isra'Tliyyat traditions is, for example, evidenced with the basically
Isra'Tliyyat-rooted BabT-Baha'T theology of the ism Allah al-a:zam (Mightiest Name of God) as it
appears in developed Babi-Baha'T sources (-->7.10. That God has a greatest or Mightiest Name
is at root a Jewish concept. In Muslim Isra'iliyyat traditions such concepts have been thoroughly
Islamified and given further levels of meaning as may be seen in the writings of Muslim
esotericists-magicians, mystics and theologians. Originally closely related to the power and
transcendence of the tetragrammaton (Y-H-W-H = Yahweh, traditionally pronounced as Adonai,
"Lord"), the al-ism al-a'zam concept entered Islam in the early centuries. Today, in recent times,
a neo-Isra'iliyyat theology of the ism Allah al-a :zam informs numerous Babi-Baha'T scriptural texts
as well as a good many semi-ritualistic Baha'T practises (Lambden, 1997, cf. MacEoin, 1994).

, Two Babi-Baha'T related aspects of Isra'Tliyyat will most often be focussed upon in this
thesis, (1) the citation and absence of citation of Islamicate biblical and pseudo-biblical texts and
(2) the appropriation within Babi-Bahä'T primary sources of originally Jewish, later ShrT Islamicate
and ultimately BabT-Baha'T concepts of the ism Allah al-a:zam (God's mightiest Name). For the
rest of this chapter some basic aspects of Islamic chronology will be sketched forming something
of a background to the consideration of Islamic and BabT-Baha'T prophetology of the following

chapter.

Chapter Two
FROM ISLAMIC NUBUWWA ("PROPHETHOLOGY ")
TO BABT-BAHA'T MAZHARIYYA ("THEOPHANOLOGY")

In the four sections of this chapter some basics of the Islamic and BabT-Bahn positions
regarding Anno Mundi, millennialism, prophetology and theophanology relative to the
traditional 'twenty-eight' Islamic prophet-messengers will be sketched as will the status of
several of them as Babi-Bahn divine manifestations (sing. mazhar-I ilahT). The Babi-Bahal
exegetical transcendence of the Islamic khatamiyya ("sealedness") through an eternal
continuity of divine guidance mediated through human representations of the Divine Will
(mashiyyat) will be briefly explained as will the roots of the Babi-Bahn doctrine of the mazhar
ilahT (divine theophany, manifestation of God).
• 2.1 Anno Muncil, millennialism and chronological aspects of Islamic

and Babi-Bahal prophetology.

Unlike the Hebrew Bible with its chronologically oriented materials and genealogical
notices specifying the lifespan of Israel's ancestors (Genesis 5,11 etc), the Q. displays little or
no concern with chronological data pertaining to ancient history, nations, prophets or peoples.
The relative dating and chronological order of past messengers and prophets is not
systematically presented in this Arabic text. Even the dates and genealogy of Muhammad
himself are not present. Muslims, however, have variously and repeatedly calculated the period
between the anno mundi (creation / the era of Adam, allegedly the 'first man') and the days
of the prophet Muhammad. They made many attempts to narrate the lives and give a precise
dating and chronological order to ancient patriarchs, prophets, philosophers and other worthies
of past ages.

Despite the quranic dictum regarding an exclusive divine knowledge of the
eschatological "Hour" (Q. 7:187 + similar traditions in numerous Islamic sources), there exist
sacred traditions as well as Muslims writers who, with varying degrees of alleged chronological
precision, have attempted to fathom the time of the eschatological yawm al-qiyama ("Day of

resurrection") or of the messianic parousia. As in 19th century Protestant and other
millennarian factions, such speculations were widespread in the Muslim world in the same and
certain earlier centuries. The consummation of the ages was widely deemed imminent, the
"time of the end" at hand (Amanat, 1989:70f, Eraqi Klorman, 1993). Important authoritative
traditions register Muslim calculations about the span of world history which often presupposes
the 'time of the end', an eschaton that has been frequently pushed forward in view of its non-
literal realization. Numerous Islamic sources bear upon these matters which cannot be
discussed in detail here. The following notes must suffice to sum up some key points in relation
to Islamic and Babi-Bahn chronology and millennialism.
• Islamic and Babi-Bahal Millennialism

It was primarily a result of an often Zoroastrian rooted Judaeo-Christian influence that
a large number of Muslim traditions and sources reckon the span of world history as extending
into a fifth, sixth, seventh or even an eighth millennial era. The frequently cited Yemenite
Jewish convert to Islam, Wahb ibn Munabbih, for example, on one occasion is said to have
reckoned a period of 5, 600 years AM up to the Islamic era (Tabari, Tarrkh, 1:15). On
another he is cited as having maintained that around 6, 600 years had transpired in view of
the fact that "God created the heavens in six days and established the magnitude of each day
at 1,000 years" (Maqdisi, K al-Bad' III:150).

Lying behind a large number of Islamic computations of the period separating the
anno mundi and the time of Muhammad are Byzantine Christian chronological and associated
speculations expressed in millennial terms. Jews and Christians from at least the opening
centuries CE divided the scheme of the ages of the world into millennial periods on the basis
of such texts as Genesis 2:2 and Psalm 90:4 (cf. II Peter 3:8; Rev 20:1ff). 1 Early Jewish,
Hellenistic, pseudepigraphical, and later Rabbinic literatures implied, and various Christian

.
Since antiquity an originally Zoroastrian then Judaeo- Christian dualistic time-scheme of world
eras ("This [perishable] Age" and "The [eternal] Age to Come") had been an "an essential feature of
apocalyptic" (Vielhaur & Strecher, NTA II: 549f).

texts explicitly utilized, diverse millennial schemata extending world history for several
thousands of years (AM). Four, five or six 1,000 year periods were often envisaged as being
consummated by a seventh millennial age of fulfilment and eschatological beatitude.'
Indicative of this is the following foundational passage from the early Christian Epistle of
Bamabas,15 ©. 125CE?) which cites Gen. 2:2a and Psalm 90:4 maintaining that:

> .. in six . days -- six thousand years, that is -- there is going to be an end to
> everything. After that, he rested on the seventh day [Gen 2:2b] indicates that
> when His Son [Christ] returns, He will put an end to the years of the Lawless
> One, pass sentence on the godless, transform the sun and moon and stars, and
then, on the seventh Day, enter into His true rest" (tr. Staniforth, Early Christian

Writings, 214).

Influenced by such early Christian traditions inherited from Papias bishop of Hierapolis
(d. c.130?) and Justin Martyr (d. 165 CE?), the Christian theologian and heresiologist lrenaeus
of Lyons (d. 200 CE) held that the world would end after 6,000 years (lrenaeus. Haer. 5. 28.
3; 5. 32f; cf. Justin, Dial, Ttyph. 80-81). So too Hippolytus of Rome (d. c. 236; Comm. Dan.,
4\.24), Julius Africanus (of Jerusalem; d. after c. 240) and other chronographers of the
apostolic, patristic and later eras. Lactantius ©. 260-.c.330) was expectant of a future
"hedonistic enjoyment by the just" in a sabbatical millennium to be realized after a 6,000 year
period (Instil. vii.14, 24; Loi, EEC 11:470; cf. 166-7). Like some of the speculations among the
former Christian writers whose chronology was frequently based upon that of the Greek
Septuagint (LXX; early 3rd Cent BCE), Eusebius of Caesarea (d. 340) thought that the world
would last for 6,000 years (six millennia) and that Jesus Christ was born in 5, 500 [later 5,199]
AM (cf. Augustine, C.D. xxii.30.5).2

The originally Syriac Me'grath Gazze ('Cave of Treasures' 4th cent. CE?), which exists

Each of the 7 days of creation were understood as 1,000 years of history; the final millennium
being a kind of 'messianic sabbath.' Thus there is the notion of the "timeless new world of the eighth day"

i
which follows a kind of 'messianic sabbath millennial day' (Caird, 1966[71]:250).

2See further Finegan, 1964 esp. 137ff; Caird, 1966[71]:250; Grabbe, 1982:107-8; Massyngbaerde
Ford,' Millennium', ABD., IV:832-834; Smith, 'Ages of the World', ERel. 1:128-133; Hughes, 'Chronology'
DBI:120-123. The expectation of a 6,000 year age of the world period was also known among the Jews
as is clear from the Seder 0/am Rabba and the saying of 'the Tanna of the House of Elijah'.

in various (post 6th cent. CE) Arabic recensions, reckons a 5, 500 year period between Adam
and Christ (Bezold, 1883-8; rep. nd.; Gibson,1901; Budge,1927:10, 221). For many early
Eastern Christians a period of at least 500 years before the end-time parousia (6,000+) was
thus presupposed. These figures were later abandoned or adjusted by Christians when
eschatological events seemed soon to be realized as in the late 7th century (Syriac)
Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius. 1 For the pious in the Islamic community, such millennially
based chronological speculations were set out in numerous authoritative prophetic bac/11h /
akhbgr from the (Twelver) Imams.

The early Kitab al-tabaqat al-kabTr (Great book of the Classes) of 1bn Sa'd (d.

Baghdad, 230/845) has a section dealing with the time span between Adam and Muhammad.
Millennial (1,000 year) periods were recorded between Adam and Noah (= ten 100 year
generations), Noah and Abraham and Abraham and Moses. A tradition of 1bn 'Abbas (d. c.
68 / 687) is cited reckoning a period of 1, 900 years between Moses and Jesus, and a fairly
precise figure of 569 years is said to separate the birth of Jesus and the time of the prophet
Muhammad. The reader might thus be led to think of a roughly 5, 500 year period, a 5,469
year period between Adam and Muhammad (= 1,000x 3+1, 900+569) (lbn Sa'd, ibid,I:53). This
is in line with the realization of millennial eschatological hopes. Certain earlier and many later
sources more explicitly presuppose Judaeo-Christian chronological speculations.

The rich in Isra'iliyyat Muhadaratal-abrar.. (Conference of the Pious) of 1bn al-'Arabi
(d.638/1240) contains a section headed 'The record of the diversity of the nations regarding
what has elapsed of the time span between Adam and the h(/rah'. Here there is reference to
a tradition of Ibn 'Abbas reckoning a period of 5,575 years between Adam and Muhammad.
Then it is recorded that al-Kalbi (d. 204/819) transmitted the duration of 6,019 years between
Adam and Muhammad. Ibn al-'Arabi further had it that al-Waqidi (d. 207/823) thought the

Apparently on the basis of the chronology of Julius Africanus and that of the Cave of Treasures
(-->) the (Syriac) Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius divides history into seven millennia placing the

44; Reinink, 1992:150+fn.2; 178f).

period from the fall of Adam to the birth of Muhammad was 4, 600 years and that Muhammad
ibn Ishaq (d.150/ 767) transmitted a period of 5451 [5416] years.'

The early Muslim historiographer AbO Isa ibn al-Munajjim (fl. late 8th cent.?) drew
upon Syriac and Greek Byzantine Christian historiographical traditions 2 in his lost but partially
cited survey of pre-Islamic chronography perhaps entitled al-Bayan 'an ta'rikh star zaman al-
'alam 'ala sabTI al-twila wa'l-buran. (Exposition of the Chronology of years of the Duration of
the World according to the way of Proof and the Evidence) (Rosenthal, 1968:72-3, 511 n.1;
Stern, 1972). Familiar with Jewish and Persian scripture and tradition, he to some extent wrote
'according to the accounts contained in the Torah and the stories of the prophets and the kings
[akhbar al-anbiya' wa'l-mulall" (al-Mas s 0 di, Muraj, 1:23; tr. Stern, 1972:438). Like Eusebius
and 'the historian AbO al-Fida', Ibn al-Munajjim (who was utilized by the former) reckoned 6,
216 years from the fall of Adam until the Hijra (Tarikh, 1.:(9) 21; Stern 1972:441). This also
places his pre-Islamic age of the world into the early seventh millennium.

Chronological traditions registered in Ibn Qutayba's (d. 276/889) early and wide-
ranging survey of world history, the K al-Ma'anf (Book of Knowledge) include the tradition that
"Adam lived 1,000 years", or "according to the Torah" (Gen. 5:5 cf Q. 29:14) "1, 000 less 70
years". In his K al-Bad' wal-ta'rfkh (The Book of Creation and History', written 355/966) al-

th
Maqdisi (d. f1.10 cent. CE) drew on Ibn Qutayba and included a lengthy section on the span
of world history mentioning a 6, 600 year period and reckoning the period between Adam and

E.g. Adam->Noah, 1,200; Noah->Abraham,1,142; Abraham->Moses, 575; Moses->David, 569;
David->Jesus, 1, 365; Jesus->Muhammad, 600. Additionally, the Great Shaykh notes that Wahb Ibn
Munabbih calculated 5600 years and gives details of the calculations of other religionists including the
a history of the Jews as 4640 years and the computations of the Greek Christians as 5772 + years
(Muhadarat, 120-1).

I

Most notably (indirectly) on various works of Eusebius of Caesarea (d. 370 CE) and his
successors: Eusebius wrote both a two part Greek Chronicom (pre. 330 CE., on sacred and profane
peoples and figures of antiquity and their parallel chronologies) and the well-known Ecclesiastical History.
Of Ibn al-Munajjim's sources Stern also refers to the 6th cent. Byzantine chronicler Andronicus (cited in
Syriac literature) and to a work of Cyril of Alexandria (d. 444 CE) (1972: 441-2 ).

Muhammad as 7, 852 years (lbn Qutayba, K al-Ma 'an't 33-4; MaqdisT, K. Al-Bad' 11:145ff).1
Roundly summing up this view, MaqdisT held that from the "covenant of Adam" ('and Adam)
until [the time of] Muhammad a period of 7, 800 years had elapsed (al-Bad', 11:150-151). The
idea of creation in seven millennial "Days" is also mentioned by al-Maqdisi as are various
complex Hindu rooted notions of aeons of cosmic and worldly time!

At the very beginning of the Ta irikh al-rusul wa'l-mulük of Abo Ja'far al-Tabari (d.

310/923) there is a section about the duration of zaman ("time") from "beginning to end"
(TarTkh,1:15-19; tr. Rosenthal, 1:1720. It is noted that certain traditions reckon the "total extent
of time" as 7, 000 years (a "week of the other world" cf. Mas'OdT, Akhbar al-zaman, 31) of
which 6, 0[2]00 (mss. vary) were thought to have passed. Tabari himself favoured the
passing of around 6, 500 years (AM) up till the time of Muhammad. He also registered the
period from the creation of Adam until the time of the h(/rah (622 CE) as calculated by Jews
( = 4, 642 years AM) and by Greek Christians (= 5,992) years AM ( Tankh,1:19; tr. Rosenthal,
183-5).3

Probably early traditions attributed to the (Twelver) Imams bear upon the time span
of the pre-Islamic era. Among them are those indicating that certain of the 29 sets of (so-
called) isolated letters of the Qur'an (al-fawatih al-sawar; al-hurufat al-muqatta'at) should be
understood in chronological or predictive terms relative to their abjad ("numerical") values (cf.

Ibn Qatayba also records a tradition to the effect that that INV (Gospel) has it that there are
three sets of 14 generations separating Abraham and Jesus (K al-Ma'arif, 34). This is basically in line
with the Matthean genealogy (Matt. 1:1ff; esp. 1:17) which is in all likelihood founded upon the numerical
value of the messianically suggestive Hebrew name David (D = 4+W=6+D =4 total = 14).

2 MaqdisT also gives detailed chronological information from the lost KW al-farrkh of Ibn
Khurdadh[bih] (fl. 3/9th cent.) (II:151f)

In the section 'On the chronology of the years of the Israelites' (= sect. III) in his (predominantly
pre-Islamic) Taiikh s/nra/-mu/uk al-arc/ waY-anbiya s ('Chronology of Kings and Prophets of the Earth',
finished 350/ 951) the Muslim chronographer Hamzah al-IsfahanT (fl. mid-late 10th cent. CE) basing
himself on biblical sources and Jewish informants writes, "So everything that has elapsed of the years
of the world up till the beginning of the era of the Arab, from the hijrah [of the prophet] amounts to 4,382
years [AM].." ( TarTkh, 68; cf. Rosenthal, 1968:79, 90f; idem, ' Hamza al-IsfahanT', El 2 III:156; 1989 [=
Tabari 1]:184 fn. 148). Rosenthal further notes that the 5992 figure is "close to that of 5990 in Hamzah
[al-IsfahanT] and that of the 5, 969 of the Antiochian era ( Tankh, 184 fn.147).

Krotkoff, 'Abjad,' Elr. 1:221-2) . An interesting example is ascribed to the fifth (or the sixth)
Imam (AbO Ja'far) Muhammad al-Baqir (d. c.126/743) as cited by al-AyyashT (fl-9th-10th. cent.
CE) in his TafsTr as transmitted by AbO LabTd al-MakhzOmT:

> 0 Aba LabTd! There is abundant knowledge (ilmaa jamm an ) in the isolated
> letters of the Qur'an (al-huraf al-qurian al-muqat ta'ah)for God, exalted be He,
> sent down [the qur i anic revelation] "Am,. Lam, MT177 (A+ L+M). This Book" [Q.
> 2:1-2a] and Muhammad rose up until his light was made manifest and his word
> was established. He was born on a day when there had elapsed 103 years from
> the seventh millennium (al-alfal-sabi)... (Fay() al-KashanT, Tafsir al-Safi, 1:77-
> 8; MajlisT, Bihar 2 52:106).

It is indicated here that the year 6,103 AM had been reached at the time of
Muhammad's birth (c. 570 CE). This figure is very close to the 6,122-3 given by the polymathic
scholar and scientist AbO Rayban al-BD-Gni (d. 442/1051) in his comparative chronology a/-
Atha/. al-baqiya.. (Vestiges of Bygone Days.)( Rosenthal, op. cit. 184 fn.147). However 6,103
is to be precisely, chronologically understood, its basic import is that the seventh millennial era
indicative of end-time fulfilment had commenced because 6,000+ years had passed. The
above ShrT tradition certainly seems to presuppose early speculations about the time of the
mission of Muhammad in millennial terms after the (Abrahamic-Islamic) anno mundi. In his
Risala ffl-nubbwa al-khassa the Bab cites this hadrth of 6,103 (INBMC 14:245) as does the
Baha'T apologist, Mirza AbO al-Facll Gulpayigani (d. 1914 CE) in his Shari) äyat al-muwamkha
(Commentary on the Chronological Testimonia, Hamadan, 1888: 8ff.). It was utilized in BabT-
Baha'T texts as evidence of eschatological fulfilment.

This 6,103 seventh millennial Shri tradition continues by having the Imam state that
the clarification of the 6,103 figure is "in the Book of God (= the Q.), in the isolated letters (al-
hurof al-muqatta'a) if they are counted them without repetition" (T.SafT, 1:78; Bihar2 52:106).
This confirmatory numerical value of the twenty nine qur'anic isolated letters is 5995 (+ 5 =
6,000 +10= 6005) which is again a figure of almost 6,000 which would definitely place the

mission of Muhammad well within the 7th millennium of fulfilment even if he were born just
before it (cf. B* P. Bay. VII 1:17, 302).

The Persian version of the TafsTr al- TabarT of Bal'amT (written c.963 CE), referring to
the Shah-Nameh tradition and to Hamza al-IsfahanT, mentions a period of 6013 years from
Adam until the era of the Prophet as well as to a period of 5, 900 years (Per. Tarikh, 1:5). The
numerical value of the qur'anic isolated letters is again associated with the time span of world
history and there is mention of a possibly Zoroastrian influenced figure of 14,000 years (7, 000
+ 7, 000). Like other Islamic sources, this source relates the creation in "six days" to a period
of six millennia in the light of Q. 32:4 and Q. 22:47b (Tabari, TafsTr ed. Yaghma'T 4:968f; 1:32;
ed. Sadeghi 1:3).

Evidently desirous of showing that Muhammad ushered in the new 7th millennial era,
early Muslim apologists and historians consciously or unconsciously based their calculations
upon such (Judaeo-) Christian figures as have been mentioned above. Their chronological age
of the world speculations suggested millennial fulfilment. Just as the essentially mythical
biblical chronology is infused with schemata suggestive of a pre-ordained, providential (heiro-)
history with eschatological implications, so too are certain of the chronologies of Islamic world
history which draw upon early hadIth or Isra'iliyyat traditions. They are often underpinned by
an apologetically rooted millennial scheme (Johnston 2 1988:36). A similar orientation is
presupposed and mirrored in aspects of the developed and extended, millennially oriented
BabT-Baha'T cyclic view of salvation history.
• The QA1m-MandT and the chronology of quranic isolated letters.

The qur'anip isolated letters are also seen in Sta s i imamological traditions as indications
of the dates of the appearance of the Imams or, the (for twelver Shris) the time of the advent
of the twelfth of them, the Qa'im-Mandi. Majlisi in one of the sections of his celebrated &hilt-
a/-an war entitled al-tamkis wa7-nahr 'an al-tawqTyah ('The proving and the modes of
understanding from the letters', Bihar 2 52:101-121) records and briefly discusses several
interpretations of these isolated letters, the fawatTh al-sawar (opening of the SOrahs) deriving
from the Prophet and the Imams. The 7 th (6103) tradition of the 5th Imam (cited above)
continues as follows:

> There is not among the disconnected letters a letter which will find its realization
> save there should rise up a Qa'im ("Arisen from the progeny of [Barn] Hashim...
> The "A" (al-alit) is one; the "L" (al-lam) is thirty, the "M" (al-mTm)forty and the
> "Sad" (Sad) ninety which [abjad numerical value] amounts to 161 years. Then
> came to pass the emergence of Husayn son of 'Ali [ 3rd Imam 171 usayn; d.
> 61/680]. "Alif, lam, mTm ("A"+ "L"+ "M") Allah (God)." So when its period came
to pass there rose up a Qa'im of the progeny of 'Abbas nigh

'Alif+Lam+MTm#Sad (Q sOra 7; total = 161] and there rose up our Qa'im nigh
> their termination in Alit+ Lam+Ra' (= Q. sora 13; total = 231). So understand
> [this]! Pay heed [memorize]! and keep it secret!" (cited from the Tafsir
> sAyyashi in Majlisi, Bihar 2 52:106).

On the basis of such traditions the Bab', BA* and subsequently Baha'T apologists
understood the value of the qur'anic isolated letters from A-L-M [-S] (Q. 2 [ 3]) up till A-L-M-R
(Q.13) to be indicative of the time of the advent of the Qa'im or MO di (= the Bab). These seven
sets of isolated letters from Q.2 (Baqara, Cow) until Q. 13 (Ra'ad, Thunder) compute to yield
: 71 (Q2) +71 (Q.3 )+161 (Q.7)+ 231 (Q.10) +231 (Q.11)+ 231(Q.12) +271 (Q.13), totalling
1,267. This is understood to indicate lunar years AH for the Bab initiated his mission in Shiraz
on May 22'1 1844 or in the year 1260, seven years away from the figure 1,267 (cf. B*
P.DalS:47) By backdating 1,267 seven years or commencing at the time of the public mission
of Prophet Muhammad (- 7 AH/ c. 615 CE?) the result is 1260 AH when the Bab initiated the
Babi religion in Shiraz, Iran. Aside from this 7 year adjustment the Bab also frequently dated
the origins of the Islamic era to the ba'tha ("Call to prophethood") of Muhammad which he
reckoned as being 10 year before the Hijra (P.Bay. 11:7; IV:14, 16,18; V1:7,8,13; K.PanjS:319,
etc).

This year 1260/1844 or thereabouts is of great significance in the BabT-Baha'T
millennial and cyclic scheme cryptically indicated in certain of the hurüfat al-muqatta'a
(Isolated letters) (B* INBMC 98:35ff; BA* L. 171 urufat). In this connection BA* writes in his L.
ljurafat al-muqatta'a, (c.1857)

> Then know that on another level God intended by these [qur'anic isolated] letters
> (al-hurafat) the mysteries indicative of fulfilment (asrar ila nihayat)by means of

• Baha'T cyclic speculation and the millennium

Like certain Abrahamic streams of religious thought, most notably Isma'TIT ShTsT
sources, Babi-Bahal doctrine maps out past and future human and heirohistory in terms of
various kinds of religious cycles dawr (pl. adwar) or eras of a greater or lesser magnitude and
time span. Successive aeons and religious eras are punctuated by the missions of founder
maghar-i ilahT who appear from age to age with a new sharT'a (religious law) and further
dimensions of spiritual truth. Cycles of religious guidance are essentially prophetological cycles
referred to by SE* (and in modern Baha'T sources) as "dispensations" (Ar./Per. guhar), an
English term borrowed from western Protestant "dispensationalism", biblically rooted
theological notions of dispensations or eras of religious history (e.g. H. Grattan Guinness, etc).

Certain controversial and novel issues associated with the dating of past Messengers,
prophets and philosophers are evidenced in various writings of both the Bab and BA*. They
adopted a badT ("novel", "new") calendar and gave new, sometimes eschatologically oriented
re-interpretations to earlier religious chronology. The writings of the Bab contain sometimes
complex prophetological chronology and predictive schemata. Both the Bab and BA* set out
past world history based upon concepts of eternally renewed mazharlyya( theophanology) and
upon the claimed realization of eschatologically oriented events.

In his Persian Bayan and other writings the Bab identified with great accuracy the time
of his 1260/1844 (= the year "sixty") religious declaration, of being the bb ("gate") to the
hidden Imam, etc. It was exactly 2 hours 11 minutes on the eve (after sunset) on the 5 th Jamad
al-Awwal 1260 (= May 22 nd 1844)( P.Bay.11:7; cf. VI:13). This date marked the beginning of the
yawm al-qiyama ("Day of Resurrection") of the Qur'an or the Islamic (and other) peoples
(ibid.) For Baha'Ts the date 1260/1844 marks the point of millennial transition from the pre-BabT
cycle of prophecy extending from the time of Adam until the end of Islamic era, 1,000 lunar

years after the death/passing into ghayba ("occultation") of the 12th Imam, Muhammad son of
ITIasan al-AskarT (d. c. 260 AH/874 CE). In his L. Mawlad ism al-a'zam (Tablet of the Genesis

th
of the Greatest Name) BA* similarly highlights the importance of 19 century dates such as
1260/1844, the night of his birth (November 12th 1817) and the Riclwan 12 day period of his
semi-secret declaration in Baghdad during April 21(22) —> May 3 1863:

> 0 Concourse of the hidden and the manifest! Rejoice then exalt within thine own
> beings for the Night hath appeared within which cycles (al-akwar)and eras (al-
> adwar)were intertwined and conflated. Nights and days have moved on such
> that the appointed times of the divine Cause (al-amr)were realized on the part
> of one Powerful, Almighty...The Riclwan ("Paradise") of the All-Merciful hath
> appeared at the midmost heart of the cyclic scheme (qutb al-akwan) for the
> Breeze of God hath wafted from the shore of forgiveness and the Hour hath, in
> very truth, come to pass... (L.Mawlod, 48).

For Baha'Ts an Adamic cycle extended from the time of Adam ( viewed as the founder
of an embryonic religion) until the end of the Islamic age in 1844/1260 or a few years later at
the end of the BabT period in 1269 / 1850/2-3, the year of BA's initial though symbolic

th
prophetic call in Tehran. For Baha'Ts the mid. 19 century is believed to have ended a 6, 000
year cycle echoed in the pattern of the six days of creation understood in millennial terms. The
theological and eschatological implications of the biblical chronology as interpreted in Christian
tradition lies behind the Baha'T affirmation of a 6000 year pre-BabT-Baha'T Adamic or
'prophetic cycle.' Just as many early Muslims placed the birth or time of Muhammad around
6,000 years AM into a 7 th millennium of fulfilment, so Baha'is have identified 1844/1260 or
1852-3/1269 as the end of a 6,000 year millennial period initiating a new Baha'T universal cycle
of fulfilment which as AB* explained to a Zoroastrian enquirer, would extend 500,000 years
into the distant future (Tablet cited SE* Dispensation: 10-11; SE* GPB: 100). After this 500,000
years Baha'is expect the advent of another great universal manifestation (mazhar- i kulliyya)
like BA* (who initiated the "Baha'T cycle") to appear and initiate a new cycle of possibly inter-

1 There have been many ancient and modern attempts to relate biblical chronology to an absolute
chronological scheme so as to divine the 'plan of history' and the 'time of the end'. Some like the famous
Archbishop James Ussher (1581-1656) whose computations were virtually incorporated into the English
1611 Authorized (King James) version of the Bible, reckoned the creation around 4,004 BCE (4004 BCE
+ 6,000 = 1996 CE).

galactic scope (SE* letter cited DG: 7-8 No. 21; Hornby, Lights 3 : 473f, 475-63ff).

Baha'finterpretations of the millennium (Lat. mille = 1,000+ annus = "year"; Rev 20:1-6)
are basically pre-millennial. The Bab and BA* are both considered the spiritual "return" of
Christ and are seen by Bahals to have initiated the onset of a millennial period or periods.
When asked about the time of the biblical millennium, AB*, apparently having 1269/1853-4 in
mind, wrote:

> Concerning the one thousand years as recorded in the Book [Bible]: It signifieth
> the beginning of this manifestation until the end of its predominance throughout
> the contingent world... It shall continue in elevation, exaltation, growth, ... until
> it shall reach the apex of its glory in one thousand years -- as the Day of this
> Manifestation is one thousand years... (AB* TAB III: 659-660).

Confirming and making more precise the developed Bahal position SE*, writing a
century after the event, stated that,

> ... the rise of the Orb of Bah g u'llâh's most sublime Revelation [in 1269/1852]
> making the consummation of the six thousand cycle ushered in by Adam,
> glorified by all past prophets and sealed with the blood of the Author of the Babi
> Dispensation [ = the Bb}" (Cablegram of 8 th Oct. 1952,MBW: 40).

This cablegram places the termination of the 6,000 year Adamic cycle at BA*'s
1269/1852-3 mystical experience in the "black pit" (siyah chal) dungeon in Tehran ( ESW: 13
/20f, 39f; cf. SE* GPB: 100, Hornby, Lights, 501f). This would place the time of Adam at 6000
years before 1269/1852-3 or around 4,148 BCE, a figure not far removed from the onset of

th
the 6, 000 year period held by many 19 century and some earlier Christians to reach its end-
time consummation in that century. At the conclusion of his 1934 The Dispensation of
Bandu'lldh SE* also indicated, that the "New World Order" of BA* would find its future
consummation with the advent of the "golden millennium". There is the millennium and the
"golden millennium", the former expressing millennial potential and the latter the millennial
actuality of global peace and justice, etc. This latter "golden millennium", SE* added alluding
to Rev. 11:15, would be "the [eschatological] Day when the kingdoms of this world shall have
become the Kingdom of God Himself" which is identified as the "Kingdom of Bahã'u'llah"

(Dispensation, 69). 1

It is thus the case that like certain Abrahamic streams of thought, most notably Gnostic,
Manichean and Ism a- ll -1 ShT'T sources, BabT-Baha'T scripture maps out past and to some extent
future human and sacred, heirohistory in terms of dawr (pl. adwar = religious cycles), eras
of a greater or lesser magnitude and time span. The period from Adam to Muhammad and
successive aeons is understood in millennial terms as being punctuated by the missions of the
founder maghar-i "lain" (manifestations of God) who, as will be demonstrated below, are
basically reflections of the ShT'T sent messengers (rasul) reckoned 'ulci al-agm ("possessors
of steadfastness").
• Islamic chronology and the pre-Islamic prophets.

Muslim sources not only contain speculations as to the anno mundi and associated
millennial schemata relating to past salvation history, but include a diversity of traditions about
the dating and lifespan of many pre-Islamic prophets, or the periods of time separating their
missions, (Bihar 2 11: 65f). The early Basran philologist AbO Haft al-SijistanT (d.2551869) was
among those who wrote volumes entitled al-Wammaran ('The Long-Lived`; al-NadTm,
Fihrist, 82f; Dharra, 21:268), in which he discussed various amazing life spans including
those of such figures as Khidr (immortal and undatable), Luqman the Elder (lived 3, 500
years), Noah (lived 1, 450 years) and Adam (lived 950 years). This fascinating work opens
by reckoning KhicIr (the Green One", Ever Verdent, Eternal) the most long-lived figure,
uncharacteristically identifying him as a grandson of Adam through Abel (al-Mu'ammaron, 3ff).
The second most long-lived is identified as Luqman (the 1st — not the later sage Luqman) an
alleged son of the qur s anic Arabian prophet 'Ad (cf. Ibn Isbaq, K al-Mubtada,
[reconstructed] trans. Newby, 1989:55; 1bn Babuwayh, Kemal, 507).
Ibn Babuwayh, al-SadOq (d. 381 / 991), drew upon the above mentioned work of al -

i
iThe above paragraphs should not be read so as imply that Babi-Baha'T leaders took Genesis
texts literally. Both AB* and SE* explicitly rejected that the idea that "this world of existence was created
six of seven thousand years ago" (PUP:462, Hornby LG 3 : 494-5 ). The Genesis narratives and biblico-
qur'anic story of the first couple are likewise non-literally interpreted (SAQ., index, etc).

Sijistani and a wide range of imamate traditions in the course of explicating the mysteries of
extended periods of prophetic (proto-)ghayba ("occultation") in his lengthy Arabic Kamal al-din
('Perfection of Religion') as well as his YIN al-sharT'a... ('Causes of the Directives...'). A
tradition is, for example, recorded from 'All b. Muhammad al-AskarT that Noah had a very
extended longevity, "the age of Noah was 2,500 years.." (hlai, 45f, Kamal 134-7; 496, 503; cf.
Kohlberg, XVI:52). In the K Nubuwwat (Book of Prophethood) and elsewhere in his Arabic
Bihar al-anwar,, Persian Hayat al-qulab and other writings, Majlisi records various
authoritative traditions and opinions about the miraculous lifespan of Noah and of numerous
other pre-Islamic prophets (Bihar 2 , 11:13; Hayat 1:246ff). The following prophetic tradition,
cited from Ibn Babuwayh's Kamal al-din, is especially noteworthy:

> ... The Messenger of God said, 'The lifespan of Adam the father of humanity
> was 930 years; that of Noah 1,450 years; of Abraham 157 years; of Ishmael son
> of Abraham 120 years; of Isaac son of Abraham 180 years; of Jacob 120 years;
> of Joseph 120 years; of Moses 126 years; of Aaron. 130 years; of David 100
> years (including 40 years of his rule) and of Solomon son of David 712 years
> (Bihar 2 11: 65).

The same Shi s T encyclopaedist elsewhere records a tradition related from al-WahidT
and recorded in the Tafsfr of Abu 'All al-Tabarsi (d. c. 548/1154), to the effect that Solomon
son of David was given rule over East and West for 700 years and 7 months. On this figure
Majlisi himself felt obliged to comment, referring to it as a khabar gharfb ("hidden report").
He seems to relate the basically 700 year length of Solomon's global rule to his encompassing
both eastern and western regions. Traditions such as this may conflict with others though they
retain their authenticity and ultimate coherence (ibid,14:80). Taken at face value Solomon's 700
year rule contradicts traditions related from the 6th Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. c.148/765) which
reckon a 400 (or 480) year period between David and Jesus. It would also indicate that
Solomon outlived Jesus by around 300 years (Bihar 214:80, 234, 351)! In line with other Islamic
traditions, MajlisT somewhat more acceptably records a round 500 year period 'separating
Jesus and Muhammad on the authority of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (Bihar 2 14: 349).
Such Islamic prophetological-chronological notices as the above are legion. They are

reminiscent of the ages of the early biblical patriarchs and of chronological data found in
ancient near eastern, antediluvian genealogies. The biblical tradition is similarly replete with
strange chronological discrepancies. The longest-lived biblical figure Methusaleh, son of
Enoch, for example, died aged 969 at the time of the flood when Noah was 600 years old
(Gen. 5f). Some Arabic and Persian Islamic historical sources contain detailed chronological
data which, by modern historical standards, is confused and inaccurate. Chronologically
oriented statements in Babi-Bahal primary sources occasionally reflect the chronological
idiosyncrasies of various, sometimes heterodox Islamic sources. This is at times evident in
aspects of the novel prophetological schemata of the Bab and in the dating given by BA* to
certain pre-Islamic philosophers and prophets in his L. Hikma (as will be noted below).
• 2.2 The traditional 'twenty-eight', the myriad prophets and the ala al-'azm

> ("possessors of steadfastness") in Islamic and BabT-Bahal literatures.

The narrative portions of the Q. are mostly concerned with the pious example of twenty
four or so all male prophet figures directly named therein (Q. 6:84-9; 21:48-91.). This number
has traditionally been slightly extended to twenty-seven or eight (still all male figures) by the
addition of a few persons not directly named in the Q. (e.g. Seth; Uzair [Ezra]-->). Around this
number of messengers consolidated itself fairly early on (pre-12th cent. CE) through the
mystical treatment of a listing of twenty-seven figures in the influential Fu,susal-1.7ikam (Bezels
of Wisdom) of Ibn al-'Arabi (d. 638/1240). This number 28 for pre-Islamic prophets became
especially well-known (cf. AB* FWU:99,24). The disciple of the Great Shaykh,         171   urr al-Amili
(d.787/1385 ) also associated the stream of Islamic prophets with the number of letters in the
Arabic alphabet (28).

Communicatirrg messages from God, the twenty-eight called humankind to piety,
guiding from primordial times until the era of Muhammad whose own circumstances often
coloured the largely non-systematic qur'anic presentation of past prophets. Roughly eighteen

of these figures are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible though most of the major (and minor)
biblical prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Joel, Habbakuk, etc) are not (directly) mentioned in the

Q. Very few NT figures, aside from John the Baptist, his father Zechariah and Jesus along with
his mother Mary, find direct mention in the Q.

Two major, sometimes synonymous terms exist in the Q. for persons who communicate
the divine message. Firstly, agents of God may be nabT (nabiyy = prophet; pl. nabiyyan /
anbiya) meaning 'one who speaks forth' (cf. Heb. [Aram.] navr, tr. Gk. [LXX] prophethés).
The term nabT occurs around seventy-five times in the Q. mostly referring to the prophet
Muhammad. Those so designated are largely biblical figures mostly not considered prophets
in the Bible. Apart from Abraham and Moses, Elijah, Elisha and Jonah, none of the quranic
prophets are so named in either biblical or mainstream post-biblical, Judaeo- Christian tradition.
The following biblical figures become qur'anic prophets, Adam, Noah, Joseph and David.

Secondly, agents of God may be rasül (pl. rusul), variously translated, 'messenger',
'envoy', 'apostle,' etc. This term is most probably rooted in Jewish Christian (Elchasaite) and/
or Manichean terminology (Ar. reset = Syr. .§61Ttia, Fossum, 1993149f). Rasül occurs over
300 times in the Q., and is also implied by mursal (lit. 'sent one'; Q. x 36 in 14 surahs;
Kassis, 807f; 1032-3). According to the Q. "Every ummah (community) has its fast-111Q. 0:47).
Aside from Muhammad himself, eight figures are specifically designated rasOl in the Q. [1]
Noah, [2] Shu'ayb, [3] Hod, [4]   sat), [5] Lot, [6] Ishmael, [7] Moses and [8] Jesus.

Like Muhammad, Jesus is explicitly designated rasül Allah (Q. 61:6). Several of these
figures including Moses ( Q.19:51), Ishmael (Q.19:54) and Muhammad (Q. 33:40; 7:157f) are
also referred to as nabl. Not all the nabT (prophets), however, are also rasa/ and not all resat
also reckoned among the nabT. Taking into account a chronological arrangement of the sOras,
many modern scholars see little or no distinction between the nabT and the rasül f= mursalj
Descendants of Abraham, however, are particularly designated nabT / anbiya' (Q. 29:26;
45:15; 57:26-7). Several Arabian, non-Abrahamic figures sent to miscellaneous communities
(see 05-07 -->) are counted among the rasül (Q. 10:47; 16:38, etc ). The words, "And We did
not send before you any rastil or nabf" (Q. 22:52) have been taken by some to indicate
differentiation (Rahman, 1980:82).

• Nubuwwa and walaya : modes of prophecy and divine providence.

Islamic literatures contain numerous and divergent attempts to define, clarify and
expound the non-systematic, quranic prophetological terminology. The term nubuwwa
(prophecy, prophethood) occurs only five times in the Q. (3:79; 6:89; 29:27; 45:16; 57:26). It
has no detailed explanation beyond the fact that nubuwwa was bestowed upon the progeny
of Abraham and the "children of Israel" (Q. 29:27; 45:16). References in the 1.7adrth literatures
highlight the importance of nubuwwa. Muhammad, for example, is reckoned to have stated
that, "The genesis of your religion is nubuwwa and rahma (Divine mercy)" (Al-Darimi, Sunan
IX). In the Q., the 'early 'creeds' and later doctrinal treatises, belief in the prophets and the
power of prophethood are regarded as central to Muslim faith (Wensinck, 1938). Both Sunni
and Shi s i Muslims consider nubuwwa (prophethood) a fundamental element of religion. In
Shi s i Islam its importance is such that it often follows tawhid (the Divine Unity) among the five
"pillars". The closely related waläya concept (-->) has been regarded as a "sixth" pillar of
twelver Shiism.

A great many Islamic books and treatises have been written dealing with nubuwwa
and related mode(s) of wahy (divine guidance), concepts of ilham (inspiration) and the
miraculous powers of various prophet figures attendant upon their prophetic commission.
Anawati succinctly defined Islamic prophethood as "essentially an investiture granted by God
to certain people" (ERel. 8:465). The relationship between the prophet and the angels, the
jinn and humankind was likewise much discussed. In Shi s isnn discussions often centred upon
concepts of walaya relative to the nabi, the rasül and the role of the exalted imams.1

By the 3rd/ 9th century, Islamic discussions of prophecy were part of comprehensive
katam (theological discourse) (Strousma, 1985:102f). A theory of prophecy, furthermore, was
an essential element in Islamic philosophical systems (Brinner,1988:66). Philosophical,

1 See, for example, Horovitz, 'Natal', El VI:802-3; Bihar, 11:13ff; McDermot, 1978 Ch. IV; al-RazT,
al-Nubuwwat.;Ceylan, 1996, Ch.6; Wensinck, 1932:203ff; Corbin, En /s/am..1:219-284; Rahman, 1958
:30ff; Fand, 'Nubuwwa' El 2 VIII:93-97, Takehita, 1987:107-169; Robinson Waldman, 'NubOwah', ERel.
11:1-8; Brinner, 1989; Chodkiewicz,       .

mystical, theosophical and other dimensions of prophetological theory contributed to the huge
and very rich Islamic prophetological legacy. All manner of theories were entertained about the
nature and significance of modes of communication between God and humankind. Worth citing
at this point is the following passage from the K Al-Arba7n if usal al-din of Abu HamTd
Muhammad al-GhazalT (d. 505/1111) which constitutes excellent summation of the orthodox
position regarding angels, prophets and wahy (divine inspiration):

> Know that God created the angels ( al-malaYkat) and raised up the anbiya'
> (prophets) and enabled them to perform miracles (al-mu'afizat). The angels are
> one and all [no more than] His servants who did not wax proud on account of
> service to Him, neither did they weary of it. Day and Night they utter unceasing
> praise. The anbiya' (prophets) are those sent unto his creatures. He transmits
> His wahy (divine revelation) unto them through the instrumentality of the
> angels. Wherefore do they [the prophets] cry out through wahy (divine
> inspiration) and this is not wahy from their own self..." (al-Arba'a, 19-20).

Shi s i discussions of these matters often make much of the differences between nabT and rasül
relative to the position of the waif ( locus of divine guidance) and the sanctified Imam. This
can be seen, for example, in the 7Im al-yaqin (The Knowledge of Certainty) of Mulla Mubsin
Faycl al-Kashani (d.1090/1679) ClIm 1:3660.

Along with nubuwwa (prophethood) the term walaya (= wilaya)is generally expressive
of God's providential overseership mediated by such agents of his power, salvific intimacy and
purpose as the nabl, rasal, imams and saints. The walaya concept lies at the very heart of
Shn religiosity, often indicating "adherence to the imams and the recognition of their mission"
as infallible exponents of the Q. and possessors of silm al-ghayb (knowledge of the unseen).
Within Shrism walaya is especially related to the role and sanctity of 'All- and the Imams of the
ahl al-bayt (House of the Prophet) who are the trustees and bearers of the divine command
(waif al-amr )as is the messianic Qa'im, entitled ,salyb al-amr (bearer of the command). The
identification of the believer with the imamate as the fountainhead and locus of wilaya is
essential to ante soteriology (Landolt, Enc.R 15:316f; Anawati, Enc.Rel. 7:464f).1

1   .   .

Within Islamic thought the Arabic verbal noun walylaya (Per. vilayaltD has a wide and complex
range of senses going well beyond the quranic roots of this term (Q. 8:44, 72). Fundamental aspects
of the "Islamic social and spiritual life" are encompassed by walaya (Landolt, Enc.Rel.,15:316-323). In
Shrism and Sufism walaya / wilaya (these spellings are synonymous) have multi-faceted theological,

Ibn al-'ArabT (d. 638/1240) and various of his numerous commentators have made
much of concepts of nubuwwa (prophethood) and wilaya ( "sainthood"). For the Great Shaykh
walaya is essentially the twin (inner depth) of nubuwwa, itself of various kinds as the
following passages from the Futohat al-Makkiyya must suffice to illustrate:

> Walaya (divine guidance) is expressive of nubuwwa 'amma (general
> prophethood) and that prophethood which is legalistic (al-tashrT) also known
> as nubuwwa khassa (specific prophethood)... Muhammad is the khatam al-
> nubuwwa (seal of prophethood) for there is no prophethood (nubuwwa) after
> him. Yet after him was the like of Jesus among the ala al-'azm (those
> characterized by steadfastness) of the Messengers (al-rusul) and certain
> specified Prophets (al-anbiya)... [in due course] there will be disclosed a wal1
> ("saint") possessed of absolute prophethood (nubuwwa al-mutlaqa)... (Futuhat,
> 2:24, 49; cf. 1:200, 429; Fusus,134-6;160,191).1

Ibn al-'ArabT saw himself, Jesus and the future Mandi as loci or "seals" of various modes of
wllaya. Jesus, for example, is the seal of the general, absolute wllaya (khatm al-walaya al-
mutlaqa) (QaysarT, Sh.Fusus, 255, 456, 460, 843; Landolt, Enc. Re1.15:320f).

In the course of commenting upon nubuwwlyya ("prophetology") in the utterance of
Jesus (kalimat 7sawiyya) in his Shari) fusos al-1*am, QaysarT (d.751/1350) makes key
statements about nubuwwa khassa and nubuwwa amma, general and specific prophethood
respectively. Much commented upon by Ibn al-'ArabT and his devotees this terminology was
utilized and commented upon by the Bab in his Risala trl-nubuwwa al-khassa (Trestise on the
specific prophethood). Therein he explained the al-nubuwwa al-khassa (specific prophethood)
of Muhammad as an expression of the mashiyya (Divine Will):

> The bearer of the al-nubuwwa al-kulliyya (universal prophethood) is the
> mashiyya (Divine Will) which., descended from the world of His Essence... the
> mashiyya was the genesis (mabda) of nubuwwa al-khassa (specific

imamological and related meanings. Walaya can be indicative of divine 'Authority', 'Trusteeship', and'
Overseership'. It figures significantly in numerous Sunni and Stas i* sources and in a multitude of Sufi
writings especially those of Ibn al-'ArabT and his followers where wilaya (sainthood, etc) and wail (saint,
friend [of God], etc) are centrally important concepts (Corbin, En Islam I:242ff; Mutahhari, 1402/1982;
171 a'irT ShirazT, nd.; Elmore, 1999:109ff, 110 fn.7).

1 1n his edition of the Fusus, Afifi explains that Ibn al-'ArabT uses various prophetological terms
including, al-nubuwwa al-'âmma (general prophethood), al-nubuwwa al-mut laqa (absolute prophethood)
and al-nubuwwa al-khassa (specific prophethood) which is identical with al-nubuwwa al-tashri
(legislative prophethood) (Fusus, Ar.176).

> prophethood) and the absolute walaya, the divine Light and the Lordly
> mysteries.. (B*., R-Nub.K 14:331-2).

Shn irfanT ("gnostic") writers of the Safavid and other periods indulged in complex
discussions about the relationship between nubuwwa and walaya. A few notes from the
Kallmat-I maknanih (Hidden Words) of Faycl al-Kashani (d.100711680-81) will illustrate this
in that this work contains an interesting discussion of the senses in which al-Insan al-kamil
(The Perfect "Man" ["Human"]) could be considered a nabi (Prophet) or a waif (bearer of
wilaya,'benefactor' , 'saintly guide'). Kashani states that al-nubuwwa al-mutlaqa is "ultimately
real prophethood" (al-nubawwa al-haqTqa), an eternally existing reality like al-nubawa al-
amma (general prophethood). It is the force through which Muhammad infuses all existence
and is the locus of all 1:-/aqq (Ultimate Reality). Its bearers are variously entitled al-khalifa al-
a •zam (Most Great Khalifa), qutb al-aqtab (Pivot of Pivots) al-insan al-kabir (The Great
Human) and Adam al-haqTqa (The Adam of Reality). Therefrom the "Supreme Pen" (al-qalam
al-a/a) inscribes reality as the al-'aql a/-awwa/(First Intellect) and the al-rah al-aZam (Most
Great Spirit). This al-nubuwwat al-mutlaqa (absolute prophethood) is alluded to as the first
creation of God, the "Light" (nor) of Muhammad, the locus of his being a nabi (Prophet) when
"Adam was betwixt water and clay" (Kashani, Kalimat, 186).

This same writer further maintains that the batin (interiority) of absolute nubuwwa is
the "absolute walaya" (batin al-walayah hiya al-walayah al-mutlaqa). It is related to the
supernal "Light" of Imam 'All's utterance "I was a wall (bearer of walaya), when Adam was
betwixt water and clay". The prophethood of all prophets results from their being channels of
al-nubuwwat al-mutlaqa (absolute prophethood) (Faycl, Kalimat, 186-7). ShT'T frfanT
speculation focuses upon 'Ali (as opposed to Jesus) as the locus of the eternal walaya by
virtue of which he, Muhammad and all the prophets, express the absolute walaya in their
absolute prophethood.                                                                         1

Walaya and associated doctrines are expounded in the works of the first two Shaykhi
leaders, Shaykh Ahmad al-A1-.1sa'T and Sayyid Kazim Rashti (-->). Commenting on mat/a'

(Dawning Point), for example, in his Qasida al-lamiyya Sayyid Kazim states that this indicates
walaya. This he defines as an eternally elevated phenomenon without beginning, as "the
Eternal Light (al-nor al-azal), the Primordial Designation (al-ta'yin al-awwal), the secondary
Eternality (al-azaliyya al-thatykya), the Bearer of Eternality upon Eternlity without Beginning
(9,112Tb al-azaliyya al-azaliyya) and the sanctified, most holy Emanation (al-fayd al-aqdas asl-
muqaddas)'. It is something closely associated with the divine Essence (hiya haqTqa al-dhat
ahad). Walaya, furthermore, has the station of the Primal Dhikr (Remembrance) (al-dhikr al-
awwal)and is the genesis of the divine Names and Attributes (maba' al-asma' wal-sifat)and
a great deal more besides (Rashti, al-QasTda, 6).

Wilaya concepts are sometimes central to the Bob's imamological and gematric
interpretations of the letter waw (= walaya) and central to his exegesis of various qisas al-
anbiya' episodes (T. s Asr 69:33ff on the 1st waw = wilayat al-kulliyya...etc, 36f, 55f on letter 35
(= waw), etc). His treatment of Adam and the angels in his early, highly imamologically oriented
T Baqara is also of interest in this connection. BA* likewise made use of concepts of wllaya
though these have yet to be investigated (e.g. L. }71 urofat, 74). Commenting upon the word
"moon" in Q. 91:2 in his T Shams, BA* has it indicate walaya. Ultimately Baha'T wilaya was
focussed in SE* as the (Per.) ValT-yi amr Allah (Guardian of the [Bahl] Cause of God').

• 2.2 The traditional 'twenty-eight', the myriad prophets and the WO al-'azm
("possessors of steadfastness") in Islamic and Babr-Baha'T literatures

The annotated paragraphs set down below on the traditionally twenty-eight prophets
and envoy-messengers sum up the qur'anic references. They introduce a few basic aspects
of the Islamic and Babi-Bahn positions respecting these figures. Islamic and Babi-Baha'T
sources for the most part assume the largely doubtful historicity of these twenty-eight by
arranging them in a partly traditional yet still highly speculative chronological order.' The

$

i Certain qur'anic sOrahs and texts and later Sunni and Shri sources provide numerous loosely
chronological lists. The Meccan SOra Hod (Q. 11), for example, gives the succession Noah, Hod, Satin,
Abraham, Shu'ayb, Moses and Jesus. Muhammad Baqir Majlisi also, for example, cites from earlier
sources an interesting extended chronological list contained in a lengthy 1.7adith qudsr (-->3.2), the
Du 'a' Umm Dawed.

concrete human existence and / or precise dating of most of these figures accords with Islamic
historical perspectives, although concrete historical information is for the most part unknown,
if not historically meaningless. The dates sometimes given here for these twenty-eight reflect
either the theories of modern biblical scholarship or traditional (though often variant) Islamic
chronological assumptions.

Where figures listed have originally Hebrew names found in the Bible they are also given
in this language after the Arabic. A few unnamed pre-Islamic figures of the Q. are loosely
chronologically listed and identified by the double zero (= 00). Frequency of mention in the Q.
is at times indicated by (= Q.x_) along with the number of quranic surahs containing reference
to these figures. The (usually) qur'anic indicated status as nabi (prophet) is indicated by (N)
and / or that of the rasol (= mursal, 'sent messenger') by R and / or the speculative (M = R).
Figures counted in developed Babi-Bahal doctrine as (Per.) maghar- i ilahr (Manifestations
of God-->5.4) are indicated by an M with an asterisk (M*). Only a brief synopsis of the BabT-
Bahal position regarding these twenty-eight ( and a few others) will be registered below.
• Primordial, Antediluvian figures
01\. Adam, 'r;i- R+N+ M* (= Heb. Dit. , 'dam = "humankind'), Adam the first man in biblical

and Islamic tradition who was believed to have lived and flourished soon after the creation (Q
x 25 in 9 suras). Several of the genesis motifs and narratives about Adam/the first couple have
quranic parallels (Q. 7:20; 20:120ff, etc). 1 Created from clay he was fit to be the primoridial
father of humanity, a khalifa('viceregenr , 'substitute') and a prophet-Messenger on earth who
was taught the names of all things (Q. 2:28f). As in Genesis Adam married Haw a (Eve) who
was created from one of his ribs (Q. 4:1b cf. Gen. 2:22), the first couple being caused to slip
by Satan. They were ultimately expelled from paradise (Q. 2:36). On earth God forgave Adam
guided him and made a covenant with him (Q. 2:36f; 20:115..etc). Influenced by Jewish,
Gnostic, Christian and other traditions, post-qur'anic Islam greatly elevated the first man. While

Hawwa (Heb. am, Havvah = Eve the wife of Adam) is not named in the Q. but is twice referred
to as his "spouse" (7:18f; 20:120f). Also unnamed are their sons Cain (Qatal), Abel (HAIN!) and Seth
(ShTth, see 02). The sroty of the first couple is related in the probably late Medinan fifth Sara (al-Ma'idah,
Q. 5:27[30]f).

his pre-existence is implied in early Sunni hadith numerous Shi s T sources additionally reckon
Adam a major manifestation of the Logos-like nor al-Muhammadrya ("Muhammadan Light").
It was preeminently through his "loins" that this pre-existent "Light" which is the essence of the
Prophet and the Imams was transmitted (see BIM?, 15:1ff; Rubin, 1975).

For the Bab Adam appeared 12, 210 years before 1260 AH/1844 CE., an essentially
composite (millennial + centennial + decadal) symbolic dating (11x1,000 + 12 X 100+ 10
[adjustment] = 12, 210) which cannot be fully unravelled here (Lambden, 1985). Though there
were 'awalfrn qabl- i adam ("worlds prior to Adam") (P.Bay IV:14; BA* L. Qabl- i adam) he was
the first mazhar-Mahr (divine Manifestation), emanated from the mashlyyat (Divine Will), the
Dhikr-i awwal lazalj ("Primal Remembrance") in a "prophetic cycle" which to some degree
terminated with the advent of the prophet Muhammad (P.Dal., 2-3). Adam brought a "book" and
founded an "embryonic religion" such that all subsequent mazhar-i llahr(divine theophanies)
stood in need of him and were his "spiritual" return (P.Bay. 111:13, VI:1 1, P.Dal. 3).

As a primordial Babi-Baha'i messenger many narratives and details respecting Adam
in Abrahamic and Islamic scriptural sources are given symbolic interpretations in the writings
of the Bab and BA*. The details of Gen.1ff are non-literally interpreted, including the creation
in six days and the biblical-quranic story of the fall of the first couple from an Edenic paradise
(Gen. 3ff + quranic parallels). Under gnostic and esoteric ('irfanT) Islamic and Shaykhi
influences a multiplicity of exalted Adams are mentioned in Babi-Bahal scripture (T. Kawthar,
15b, 21b T. Qadr., 69:19; cf. K.Panj.S 100).
02\. Shith, ,!....:..1   (trad.N) (= Heb. nui, t 60, Seth was the unnamed (Q.x 0) third son of Adam

and Eve (Gen. 4:25ff.). He is often considered an important post-Adam prophet in extra-qur'anic
sources as one of the recipients of wahy ("divine revelation"). Aside from this reference Seth
is very seldom mentioned in Babi-Baha'i sources. In Shi s i and other sources his progeny in
particular, as opposed tathat of his brothers Cain and Abel (Ar. Habil and Qabil, unnamed cf.
Q. 5:27) are seen to constitute the truly "righteous" primogenitors (Quinn, 1962; Klijn, 1977;
Huart [Bosworth] El 2 IX:489-90). BA* briefly narrates his story as Adam's son Seth in his late
Iraq period S. Nush (SOra of the Counsel, 244). He is represented as a rejected messIenger
of God to his contemporaries who failed to orient themselves in the direction of the wajh al-
jamal, ("the beauteous Divine countenance").

3\. IdrTs,            N (= ? Heb. "pm, hanOk), Enoch (Gen 4:17f, Q.x 2 = 19:57; 21:85) the

biblical son of Jared who "walked with God" (Gen. 5:21-4) an "upright man and a prophet"
(Q.19:57-8; 21:85). Numerous legends are related of Enoch (Vajda, EI 2 111:1030-1; Fraade,
'Enoch' Enc. Re1.5:116-118). Numerous legends about Idris exist in Islamic sources. He is
"said to have introduced several sciences and arts, practised ascetic piety, received revelation,
and entered paradise while still alive" (Fraade, 'Enoch' Enc. Rel. 5:116-118). Enoch is
occasionally mentioned in Babi-Bahal sources as the father of 1.7ikmat (wisdom- philosophy,
etc) and, as in Islamic sources, is equated with the first of the thrice born Hermes' (Martin,
'Hermes' DDD:771-783; 'Hirmis', EI2111:463; BA* L.-ITlikmat, tr.148; Ma'idih 7:143)
4\. NOti,       R+N+M* (= Heb. TT13, nOah), Noah (fl. [tad.] fl. 3000 BCE??) the biblical son of

Lamech who in both the Bible and the Q. is reckoned to have lived at least 950 years (Gen.
9:29; Q. 29:13-14) and to have survived the flood along with his family (Q. x 43 in 28 suras).
As an prototype of Muhammad and one blessed with wahy (divine inspiration, Q. 11:36) the
legend of Noah and the associated story of the all-encompassing "flood" and salvific "ark", is
important in the Q., one sura of which is named after Noah (Q. 71 BRIO. He is mentioned 43
times in 28 sOras of the Q. his story being repeated around ten times. The Noah story is
frequently told in Cksas al-anbiya' and other post-qur'anic literatures.

Little concrete information about Noah, the mazhar-i ilahf is given by the Bab or BA*
though motifs deriving from his story are frequent in many primary texts. Much utilized is the
Islamicate motif of the "Ark" of salvation providing refuge from the "flood" or "storms" of
ungodliness.' Important rewritten exegetical accounts of the story of Noah are found in the QA
of the Bab and in BA's S. Nush (` SOra of the Counsel', 244-6). Early on the Bab understood
the "Ark" to be the salvific "Ark of the messianic Dhikr" (saftnat al-dhikr), the refuge of the
eschatological ahl al-bayt, the truly believing "people of the House" (of Shrism as proto-
Babism, QA 82:333). In the QA and elsewhere the Bab also used the motif of "the crimson-
coloured and ruby arks" (sufun' min yaqata al-ratba al-hamra', QA 57:226) assigned to the
"people of bah" whom BA* subsequently identified as his followers, the Baha7s (lit.
'characterized with radiance'). BA* also frequently and in a number of different ways glossed

1 BA*, KI:5f17-8; S. Absab AQA 4:XX; K. Badr, 214 (mss.); cf. Buck,1999:114f.

the term "Ark" as, for example, the "Ark of the Spirit" (safinat al-rOh) in his L. Baha' where
he also speaks of the "Ark" motif as being his eternal religion:

Say: 0 people! Embark on the Ark of Eternity (safTnat al-baqa) which
> traverseth the crimson sea.." (L. Bah', 72; cf. L.Ruh, L.Tuqa)
> In 1949 SE's secretary explained that for Bahals the story of Noah's "Ark" and the
"Flood" are "both symbolical" (LG: 509 No. 1716).

For Shris the issue of the length of Noah's lifetime went beyond scriptural norms (<--
over 950 years). This in part in connection with their desire to justify going to extreme lengths
for the ghayba (occultation) of the hidden, messianic Qa'im. Several symbolic Baha'T
interpretations of Noah's longevity also exist especially in view of BA's mentioning the figure
950 years in his K Tqgn (KI:617—> 4.2).

• Three pre-Islamic Arabian prophets
5\. HOd         R (= Heber ? Heb. -14u, heber), possibly (Ar.) 'Aber the Kenite descendant of

Hobab and father-in-law of Moses (?Judg. 4:11). Q title sOra 11 and x 7 in 3 sOras.
Alternatively, a purely allegorical ancestor of the Jews (? cf. El 2 Wensinck [Pellet] art.' HOc1').
Seven times mentioned in 3 sOras of the Q. Hod is also the title of sOra 11. In the Q. Hod is
a messenger sent to his people 'Ad whose story is related three times in three sOras (Q.7:63-
70;11:50-60; 26:123-40). His monotheistic message was ridiculed by the s Adites (of al-alyqäf,
"the sand dunes"; Q.46:21). In consequence they were largely destroyed by the violent sarsar
("clamorous [raging] wind"). Hod finds succinct qiSas al-anbiya' (-->2.4) rooted mention in
select BabT-Baha'i sources. In his S-Nush (c. 1861?) BA* refers to him as a nabf (prophet)
sent to both orient and occident (S-Nush, 246; cf. KI:7-8 /6-7).
6\. Saliti,        R+N is mentioned x 9 in 6 sOras of the Q. He was a (pre-Abrahamic?) prophet

sent to the tribe of Thamod (Q. 7:73-9, etc). He came with the "sign", "proof' or "test" of the
nöqa ('[she-] camel') but was rejected. His mocking audience were all destroyed by a storm
or earthquake. BA* explained (the tribe of) "Thamud" allegorically as opponents of truth l in any

'Islamic traditions reckon Had (-->05), ?Mb (-->06), Shu'ayb (-->07), Ibrahim (-->08) and
Muhammad (-->028), five Arabian prophets (-->).

age (BA* T-Shams, 15-16; cf. S-Nush, 246; KI 7-8/7). He quite frequently utilized the motif of
the "she-camel" (L-Dhi s b/ESW, index) On one occasion AB* explained that the nage indicates
SaIi1-.1's "sanctified self" (nafs-i muqaddas). Being "hamstrung" indicated an event within SaiTh
precipitated by his enemies which prevented him from proffering the "milk" of spiritual beatitude
to his people (AB* Ma'idih 2:99).

7\. Shu'ayb, ‘7.,..-t       R+N, perhaps [the uncle of?] Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses (Exod.

3:1; 4:18; 18:111]? Q x11 in 3 SOrahs). A messenger-prophet sent with riselat ("messages")
to the people of Madyan (Midian, NW Arabia? cf. Q. 20:40; 28:22f) or the ashab al-ayka
("people of the thicket"; Q. 7:83-91,etc). 1 A qur'anic rasa' though not a Babi-Bahal mazhar-i
Mg Shu s ayb is infrequently mentioned in Babi-Bahal sources (BA* KI:7-8 /7).
• Abrahamic patriarchs and associated figures

,.

8\.   IbrahTm, r:.Jalji l      N+M* (= Heb. Dirm, s abrähäm) Abraham (f1.19th cent. BCE?).

Frequently mentioned in the Q. (Q14 [title] x 69 in 245 verses within 25 sal-as) Abraham in the
Q. is a son of Azar (Q. 6:74 cf. the Eliezer of Gen. 15:2f and Gen. 11:26 where the father is
Teran). He is the khaill-Allah ('the friend of God', Q.4:125; 6:125) and scriptural father of
monotheism. For Muslims Abraham became a proto-Muslim proponent of primordial Islam,
the millet Ibrahim ("religion of Abraham", Q. 2:130 etc.). Neither genealogically a Jew nor a
Christian (Q. 3:67) Abraham is several times accorded the epithet heart - , loosely, 'pure
monotheist' (cf. Syr. hanpo pl. hanpe , Q. 2:135; etc). According to Q. 29:27 God established
nubuwwa ('prophethood') and al-kltab ('The Book', 'Scripture') "among his progeny" (--> 09
&10).

In Babi-Bahal sources Abraham is a centrally important mazhar-i ilahT. (BA* S-Nusn,
246-7; KI:8/7-8). Several legendary episodes within Abraham's life are given a spiritual
interpretation, including his being cast into the "fire" (a/-nar)which became "light" (al-nar) and
his unfulfilled sacrifice of [Isaac] Ishmael (BA* S.Nush, 247-8, etc. ). For AB* his exiles
prefigured those of BA* (AB*, SAQ:IV).

' In his El 2 article' Shu'ayb', (IX:491+see refs. and bib.) Rippin notes that it was on the basis of
Q. 9:91 that he was "understood to have come after triad, sant) and Lot (Lot)."

9\. Istiaq, J1L4 N ( = Heb. PUT), Yistiaq), Isaac (Q. x17 in 12 sOras) according to Gen.

22:1f the son of Abraham. In the biblical tradition he was the one bound for sacrifice (akedat
Yi;shaq, cf. Gen 22:9). Though this is not explicit in the Q. some early Persian and other
Muslim sources supported his status as dhabih ('the one [well-nigh] sacrificed'). 1 Isaac is
rarely mentioned in Babi-Bahal primary sources. BA* and AB* have commented upon the
meaning and discrepancy between the biblical (Isaac) and qur'anic exegetical (Ishmall)
references to different sons of Abraham involved in the near sacrifice (Mazandarani, AK 3:196-
201). They held that both narratives enshrine the same "spiritual" truth.
10\. Ismail,              R+N (= Heb.               Yishma"61,), Ishmael (Qx12 in 8 sOras) the

biblical eldest son of Abraham and Hagar (Gen. 16:11ff) said in the Q. to have received divine
revelations (Q. 2:136; 4:163). In the Q. he (or a second Isma'il —>) is explicitly named a
prophet-Messenger (resat an nablyy an , Q.19:54b) though little concrete information is given
about him. He most probably was the one who (it is implied) among other things assisted his
father in establishing the Meccan Ka' bah as the centre of pilgrimage (Q. 2:125f) (Paret,
El 2 IV:184-185+bib., Firestone, 1988;1990). Some Muslims hold that he was the ghulam al-
halim ("the wise youth") whom Abraham prepared as the dhabih ('one [well-nigh] sacrificed',
Q. 37:101-7). Abraham's intended sacrifice of Ishmael is occasionally mentioned in BabT-
Bahal sources where he is a paragon of detached, personal sacrifice (BA*Tablet to                Rio'
GWB:XXXII). Following the post qur'anic story BA* likened the actual death of his son Mirza
MihdT (d. 23nd June 1870) in Acre, to Abraham's intended sacrifice of Ishmael (ibid). As in
various Islamic (Shri) and ShaykhT texts, Babi-Bahal primary sources mention two Ishmaels,
one the son of Abraham and the other the resat and nabi mentioned in Q. 19:54-5 as
interpreted by Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq and others (Bibar 2 13:388-91; AB* & SE* unpublished).
This second Isma'il is sometimes identified as the Israelite prophet, Ismall son of Hizial (son
of Ezekiel; Shaykh Ahmad, JK 1/1:101).

Linked (among others) with Jacob and his half-brother Ishmael (Q. 9:71; 19:39; cf.10 below)
most of the qur'anic references to him occur in miscellaneous lists of prophets and associated figures.
(Alexander, DBI:44-7+ bib.; Montgomery Watt           El2 IV:109-110; Naudó, 1971).

11\. Lo t , .14 R+N (= Heb. 191'7, Lot) Lot , the biblical son of Haran and nephew of Abraham
(Gen 11:27f;13:5-13,7f) In the Q. Lot is an envoy-prophet mentioned 27 times in 14 sOras.
He is said to have survived the catastrophic, meteor-like stoning (with 4111) of "upturned"
(mu'takifa) ,'vice-ridden' cities such as (the unnamed) Sodom. Lot is seldom mentioned in
Babi-Baha'i primary sources though aspects of his biblical-quranic story are non-literally
interpreted. In a letter dating to 1938, for example, SE* defended the integrity of Lot relative to
the incestuous episode narrated in Gen.19:29-38 (SE* Dawn:201).
12\. Ayyob, ,-;3.1.1 N (= Heb. ar?3, 4 4613) Job is a non-Hebrew, universal legendary hero

known from the biblical book of named after him and various post-biblical sources including the
Qumran texts. In the biblical book Job is pictured as an inhabitant of Ur (= Edom?). He is four
times mentioned in 3 sOras of the Q., twice in lists (Q. 4:163; 6:84). Twice mentioned in
fragmentary allusions to his story (Q. 21:83-4; 38:41) this Islamic legendry hero is sometimes
considered a descendant of Abraham through Isaac (Tabari, Tarikh 1:194).

Job and his (unnamed) wife are greatly celebrated in the opening pages of the twenty-
five page Arabic epistle of BA* variously entitled the L. Ayylib (Tablet of Job) and Surat al-
,5abr (Surah of Patience, March 1863; Ar. text, AyyamT: 282-313). Therein are registered
Islamicate forms of originally Jewish-Hellenistic Job materials such as are found, for example,
in the Testament of Job (1st. cent. BCE/CE?; Kohler, 1897; OTP 1:829-868). Job, though not
the biblical book, also figures in a few other alwah of BA* (e.g. L.Sarraj, MA 7:65). AB*
occasionally interpreted verses of the biblical book of Job (SWAB: 171-2 on Job 19:25-27) and
gave Q. 38:41 an allegorical interpretation. The "spring" (mughtasal) in this latter verse is
interpreted as the "spring of divine prophethood" (chashmih-yi nubuwwat-i ilahT). On entering
it Job was cured of both spiritual infirmities (amrad-i rahani)and physical strictures (taqayyad-i
nafsanf)(Ganj, 58-9).

• Israelite patriarchs, prophets and other miscellaneous figures

13\. Ya'clob, ,..., N (= Heb. 31PW, ya'acr3b,), Jacob also know as (Heb) "Kap', yisrael,
,.
(Ar.)   3.,31j-,), Isra'il (= Israel, cf. Q. 3:87, etc), the son or brother of the biblical Isaac (Q. 37:113;
. . • ,..

6:84). Jacob may have flourished in the mid. 2nd millen. BCE. He is reckoned a a nabf and
is 16 times mentioned in 10 saras of the Q. The father of the (twelve) tribes (Q. 2:126f)
including that stemming from his beloved son Joseph. It was over separation from this "son
of his old age" (Gen. 37:3b) that he was blinded with grief until Joseph's "coat" (qami;s) was
cast upon his head thereby restoring his sight (Q.12:93-4). In ShrT tradition the sacred qamrs
("garment") was thawb min thiyab al-janna, ("one of the robes of Paradise") with which
God through Gabriel clothed Abraham. It was handed down to Jacob who bestowed
this scented (riha)garment ( Q. 12:94b) upon Joseph (Bihar 2 12:249).

Jacob-Israel is infrequently mentioned in Babi-Bahal sources save relative to his being
the father of Joseph. In his K Asma the Bab interpreted messianically the qur'anic episode
of Jacob's sight being restored through the healing scent of the garment of Joseph. The motif
of Joseph's sight bestowing, life-giving, resurrecting qamrs is important in both BabT and
Baha'T writings. In his K Asma' , for example, the Bab, commenting upon the Name of
God al-Bashir ("the Herald of Good Tidings", Q. 12:93) refers to a garment of the
"Joseph of Baha' ". In a passage inspired by Q. 12:93 he writes,'

> Hearken! Then take ye firm hold of the garment of the Joseph of Baha'
> Namf.s yOsuf a/-bah) from the hand of His Exalted, Transcendent
> herald of Glad-Tidings (mubashshirihi al-aliyy al-av). And place it upon
thy head in order that thou might be endowed with insight (Ii-tartadcla

an)
> bask a") and discover thyself truly aware (khabir         (text cited QI
> 4:1875).

The Baha'T apologist Ishraq Khavari understood this passage relative to BA*'s being the
BabT messiah figure man yuzhiru-hu Allah (Ishraq Khavari, QI 4:1870ff).

On theophanological lines is the exegesis of qamr,s ("garment") presupposed in
the SCirat al-qamfts (The Sarah of the Robe, c. 1865) of BA*. This 25 page Arabic work which
opens by identifying the supernatural "Garment" as a reality evident as the haykal

1 Note the use of the exclamation "Good news!" (yd bushra) in Qur'an 12:19b followed by the
words "Here is a youth (ghulatn)!" (0.12:18, 25ff) and the use of the word bashfr ("bearer/herald of good
tidings") in Q.12:93 which recounts the episode of Joseph's garment being placed on the head or face
of the patriarch Jacob/Israel (= "But when the bashir ["bearer of good tidings" came to him, and laid it on
his [Jacob's] face fwajhihil, forthwith he saw once again"). It is this qur'anic verse which lies behind the
Bab's words translated above and the following passage from BA's S-Qamis.

(Temple) of the Person of BA* "betwixt all the worlds!" (S-QamTs, AQA 4:41). In the
course of this S. QamTs BA* is addressed by a supernatural voice as the yasuf al-
kibriya' ("Jospeh of the Divine Grandeur") in Abhg '(All-Beauteous) garments (qumus
al-abha') bidding him,

> ... deprive not the ears from the melodies of Thy holiness (naghamat
> qudsika) nor the eyes (al-absar) from smearing with the kohl (eye
> makeup) of the gnosis of thy Beauty ('an kuhl al-Yrfan jamalika) nor the
> suns (al-shum0s) from the flashes of the Lights of Thy Grace (bawanq
an war

Commenting on Q.3:93a in his L. Kull a1-ta'am (Tablet of All Food, c. 1854), in a
completely different context, BA* gives "Israll" (Israel) and the "children of Israel" a mystical
interpretation relative to the religion of the Bab at the same time censoring the antinomian
proclivities of early MDT factions:

> Then know that the significance of "food" (ta'gm) is [the one who is] the Locus
> of Knowledge (nafs al-71m), that is, all branches of learning (kull
> "Israel" signifies the nuqtat al-ulyg (Primordal Point = the Bab) and the ban!
> Isra!1 ("children of Israel") he whom God, on His part, made a [messianic] Proof
> Mujjat) unto the people in these days [= BA*?]. "Except what Israel made
> unlawful for itself [or himself]" (Q. ) indicates that which the Primal Point [= the
> Bab] made unlawful for His elevated ones and His servants (BA*, Ma'idih
> 4:371).

As far as I am aware this understanding of "Israel" (= the Bab) is not taken up in Bata or Bahl
literatures though, as will be noted below, it has something of a Shri-ShaykhT hermeneutical
precedent (—> 5.1; Atisa'i, Sh-Ziyara, I11:278). .
14\. Yosuf           M [= R]+N+M* (= Heb. rror/riplm, ,Y6s6p), Joseph after whom SOrah 12
is named, is mentioned 27 times in the Q., twice outside Q. 12 (Q. 6:84 and 40:34). He is the
biblical eleventh son of Jacob (= Israel) and Rachel. Though according to the Q. He came with
"clear proofs" (Q.6:85b; 40:34b) he was doubted as a prophet. In Islam Joseph is an important
messenger-prophet of God. His story is the longest continuous prophetological narrative in the
Q. (111 verses) mirroring the extended biblical narrative (Gen 37-50). The SoratYasuf (Q.12)
is reckoned the ahsan al-qasas, the "most beauteous of narratives" (Q.12:3). It cpntains
dimensions of the extended biblical story (Gen. 37-50) with supplementary haggadic-rooted
and other unique features. In Islamic tradition Joseph is reckoned a paragon of handsome

beauty (husn / jams° and one eminently righteous (al-siddiq).1

Joseph is figure of great importance in BabT-Baha'i primary sources. He is mentioned
numerous times in a great many texts. The first major work of the Bab, his TafsTr Sara YI.7suf
(Commentary upon the Surah of Joseph) or Qayyüm al-asma' (lit.'The Self-Subsisting of the
Divine Names') is an Arabic neo-queanic, messianic, esoteric and quasi-qabbalistic expanded
rewrite of select quranic pericopae. For the Bab Joseph was a key proto-Shri type of the
occulted, messianic Qa'im as well as one who prefigured the martyred and expected to "return"
Imam 171 usayn (d. 61/680). As in Shri messianism 171 usayn's eschatological role is anticipated
in the QA, K Asma' and other writings of the Bab.

The Qa'inn / 171 usayn-Joseph typology is central to Babi-Baha'T sacred writings. The
eschatological Qa'im and Husayn are pictured as "hidden" and "secreted" in a messianic
ghayba (occultation) just as Joseph was "hidden" in the "pit" of his eschatological theophany
by his jealous "brothers" who at times represent the 12 letters of the kalimat al-tawnid, ("Word
of the Divine Unity"), the shahada as the cryptic expression of Shri orthodoxy.

A quranic nabi (prophet) Joseph in developed Baha'i doctrine was elevated to the
position of maghar-i &hi" (M*). SE* expressed this as follows, "Joseph was one the the 'Sent
Ones' [= mursall of the Qur'an, meaning a Manifestation of God [rasal = maghar-i
(LG:497). The allegorical-typological Baha'i identification of Joseph with BA* contributed
markedly to his being elevated from Islamic "prophet" to an exalted, pre-existent BabT-Baha'T
maghar- iilãhi (Divine manifestation, theophany). For Baha'is the all-eternal, paradigmatic
husn, jarnal ("beauty", cf. the messianic 3 rd Imam Husayn) of the biblical- quranic Joseph,
became the baha7abha , the radiant and glorious "Beauty" of the person of BA* in his role as
the incarnation of the powerful al-ism al-a'zam, the Mightiest Name of God.

BA* frequently claimed to be the new, true, supremely beauteous (abha) Joseph. Baha'r
exegesis has it that the story of Joseph as interpreted by the Bab parallels and anticipates the
person and fate of BA*. This especially in terms of his Ottoman imprisonment and 1866-7
rejection by his half-brother, Mirza Yabya Non. SE* wrote that the Jospeh story "forecast what
the true Joseph [BA*} would, in a succeeding [Bahal]. Dispensation, endure at the hands of one
who was at once His arch-enemy and blood brother" (GPB:23+index).

15\. Masa            R+N+M* (= Heb.          mc5§eh), Moses(13th cent. BCE?) in the Bible is the
son of the Levites Amram and Yochebed (Exod. 2:1 if). The central lawgiver and prophet figure
in biblical Judaism, Moses is also a key prophet-messenger of the Q. A major prototype and
annunciator of Muhammad (Q.7:156) Moses is mentioned in the Q more frequently than any
other prophet figure (Q. x 137 in 502 verses within 36 sOras).

Many of the biblical episodes associated with Moses have qur'anic counterparts;
examples are the Sinaitic call, theophany (Q.7:142-3) and revelation of the Torah (tawrat)
Pharoah and the exodus and various miracles associated therewith (Q.20:12; 7:143f; etc). As
in the Q. Moses the exalted divine manifestation is very frequently mentioned in ShaykhT and
in Babi-Baha'T literatures. The interpretation of the theophany on Sinai was foundational for the
self-understanding and claims of the Bab and BA*. This especially as it is mentioned in the
semi-ghuluww (extremist), shn khufba al-tutunfiyya (loosely, "Sermon of the Gulf") ascribed
to Imam 'AIT (Lambden, 1986:84-5).
16\. Haron, 31_)66 R+N (= Heb. 11i1, s atiarOn) Aaron fl. 3th cent. BCE?) is the biblical elder
brother of Moses (Exod. 2:1f) and an Israelite priest of the tribe of Levi. In the Q. he is 20 times
mentioned in 13 sOras. He is is the wazir of Moses ( Q. 20:30; 35:17) with whom he is almost
always mentioned. Aaron is again very seldom mentioned in BabT-Baha'T sources save in
association with Moses.
17\.   Daw0d, 3.13 13   N [+M*?] (= Heb. Trf,   dawid) David    (fl. 11th -10 cent. BCE/ c. 1037?-
c.961(7) BCE?) the biblical youngest son of Jesse (I Sam. 16:1, etc.). He is a nabT mentioned
six times in 9 soras of the Q. The Q. twice states that God revealed the zabar (Book, Psalter)
to David (Q 4:163;17: 55). God is is said to have taught him 7Im (knowledge) and lykma
('wisdom' Q. 21:78f) as well as how to make armour and soften iron (Q. 21:80; 34:10). David
in the Q. is considered God's just khairfa on earth (Q. 38:35-38 cf. 2Sam 11-12 cf. Q. 21:78).
His victory over Jalat (Goliath) is specifically mentioned (Q. 2:251) as are a few other episodes
in his unusual and ultimately pious life. Abrahamic religious traditions picture David as a type
of both the eschatological messiah and his enemy the anti-messiah or Dajjal (Syr. Deceiver).
He is a figure of great importance both for the Bab and BA* as, among other things, the
revealer of the Zabor (Psalter). In this respect he has a sweet singing voice. Just after the

divine his claim "I am al-baha' (the glory/Beauty), the Bab , addressing the "Concourse of
Lights" (ma/a' al-anwar) in QA 108 claims, "This is the Bird (al-t ayr) which singeth in the
firmament of heaven with the elevated accent of David rata lahn al-clawed)" (108:433). This
same prophetological motif is utilized by BA* in the eighth couplet of his early proclaimatory
Hal/h, Hal/h, halih, ya Bisharat (Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 0 Glad-Tidings! c. 1862 CE):

> This sweet Davidic voice (naghmih-yi dawCidT) came from the Divine Lote-Tree
> (sidnh-yi lahati), with the messianic Spirit (rah-I masittha) ... (BA* Ganj, 34).

Though the troubled, apparently far from ismat personal life of David spelled out in the
Bible would seem to ill-befit his occupying an elevated position, the Islamic David is often
represented as an extra pious penitent, a major prophet whose shortcomings were forgiven
by God. Though not now regarded by Baha'is as a maghar-i ilahl (Manifestation of God) David
is given high rank by BA*. In his K Tqan, for example, he refers to David son of Jesse as being
among the "greatest of prophets" (anbiya' yi a'zam ;BA*, KI:39/51). Most probably as a result
of Shn IrfanT or Ahl-i Haqq influence, the prophetology of the Bab recognizes a David prior
to David the son of Jesse (B* Ar. Dal. Per. Dal., TBA. Ms. 6007C: [189-197], 195; K.Panj.S
424ff; cf. Nuq. Kaf, 27; Muhadarat, 1:371f). This second pre-Mosaic David is most probably
the Dawod exalted by the Ahl-i   H aqq faction known as the Dawodis ("Davidites") whom the
Bab encountered in Adhirbayjan and elsewhere (Fr. Anastase the Carmelite, al-DawCida aw
al-Dawadiyyan in al-Mashriq VI [1903], 60-67).
18\. Sulayman,          N (= Heb. nOtti, 6616m6h) Solomon (fl. 10 cent. c. 961-922 BCE?)

was the son and successor of David (and Bath-Sheba, 2 Sam 12:24f; cf. Q.27:1b,16) as the
Israelite king. In the Q. he is a nabi mentioned 17 times in 7 sOras. He is a faithful servant of
God (Q.38:29) and another important antitype of Muhammad. Solomon is credited with
esoteric knowledge including the speech of animals and birds (Q. 27:16,19) as well as great
powers of magic and divination. In Islamic and other magical sources he is reckoned to have
been privy to the secret of the ism al-a'gam, (mightiest Name of God). Rooted in the biblical
text and Jewish traditions, the tale of Solomon and the variously named Bilqis, the Queen of
Sheba, is recounted in Q. 27: [16] 20-45).

Like David, Solomon son of David is greatly revered in Babi-Bahal sources. The Bab
knew of Solomon as a paragon of knowledge and one universally accepted (K.Panj.S:28). In

his chronologically Islamo-biblical L.-Ijikmat (Tablet of Wisdom) BA*, like Shaykh Ahmad and
others (JK 1/2:96) refers to Pythagoras (6th cent. BCE?) as a contemporary of Solomon (c.
986-930) and one who "acquired Wisdom (al-hlkma) from the treasury of prophethood (ma Van
al-nubuwwa),

> Empedocles [c.493-433], who distinguished himself in philosophy (al-hikmat),
> was a contemporary of David (Ar. ft zaman dawac1) (c.1037-967 BCE), while
> Pythagoras [6th cent. BCE?] lived in the days ( f zaman) of Solomon [c. 986-
> 930 BCE], son of David, and acquired al-hikma ("wisdom) from the treasury of
> prophethood [ = Solomon?](ma Van al-nubuwwa). (TB 45/ tr.145)

Baha I T attempts to resolve the chronological disparities in the above passage originate
with AB* and SE*. 1 In his analysis of this data Cole has argued that the chronology of the
L.hikmat is indebted to Sunni historical works, most notably the al-Mllal wa'l-nlhal of al-
ShahrastanT and the al-Mukhtasar f akhbaral-bashar of AbO al-Fida' (d.1331) which might
(directly or indirectly) have been available to BA* himself (Cole, WO 1979:30). This may indeed
have been the case though the Acre located library of the al-Jazzar Mosque. It may be though
that other IshraqT, ShT'T 'school of Isfahan' or ShaykhT sources lie behind this chronology.

The notice regarding the somewhat enigmatic MOristus [MOrit Os?] (= "Martos" [sic.]
in Holley, ed. Scriptures:198 [333]) in the same section of the L.-Hlkma of BA* (41/150) may,
as Cole also asserts, be (indirectly) derived from al-Qifti's (d. 1248) Tarikh al-hukama' (ed.
322, through s AbO al-Ficla'?). It was MOristus (spellings vary, pointing uncertain) who, as
detailed in his (?) San 'at al-urghin al-baqf ("On the construction of the flue-pipe organ"),
invented a hydraulic organ which could produce very loud, terrifying sounds and be effectively
utilized in warfare. Its inventor is mentioned in numerous sources including, for example, the
early (Muntakhab) ..Siwan al-hikma (ed. Dunlop, 82) of AbO Sulayman al-SijistanT (4th/10th
cent.) and the much later Persian Nasikh al-tawarikh (vol. 11:15) of Sepher (—>4.1).2

1 AB* in a letter to the British Baha'T Ethel Rosenberg held that histories prior to Alexander the
Great (d. 323 BCE) were "very confused", adding that statements in the L.Hikma were in accordance with
eastern historical records (AB* Ma'idih 2:65-7). SE*, on the other hand, indicated that Bahals need not
take too literally the reference to the contemporaraneousness of Pythagoras and Solomon since the
meaning of if zamän (lit. "in the time") may be "far more elastic" than the English word "contemporary"
implies (Letter written on behalf of SE* dated 15 February 1947).

Kings 17ff; 2 Kings 1-2) is three times mentioned in two surahs of the Q. He is referred to as
a sent messenger and a prophet. Ilyas is reckoned "among the righteous" (Q.6:85) having been
a staunch opponent of the cult of Baal (Q. 37:123ff). He is not mentioned very frequently in
Babi-Bahal sources though the biblical story of the confrontation between Elijah and the priests
of Baal was demythologized by AB*. The "altar of sacrifice" represents the human heart, the
"heavenly fire" divine love and the "bullocks" sacrificed carnal desires entirely consumed by the
fire of divine love (StarW VII:27). The biblical Elijah is regarded by Baha'Ts as one whose
spiritual "return" has taken place twice: first as "John the Baptist" as the NT indicates (--> 26)
and again as the person of the Bab (SE* GPB:58; Citadel, 95). BA* and AB* are both said to
have reverentially visited the traditional site of the Cave of Elijah on Mt. Carmel.
20\. Alyasa' t.—:31 (N; =? Heb.               'dna') Elisha, most likely the biblical prophet Elisha
son of Shaphat (? 9th cent. BCE), the (Heb.) 7sh '61517Im ("man of God") commissioned by
Elijah (no.19) whom he succeeded (1 Kings 19:16f; 2 Kings 2f). In the Q. Alyasa' is only
mentioned in two lists of prophet figures, "Ishmael, Alyasa' [Elisha], Jonah and Lot! Dhu'l-Kifl"
(Q. 6:86; 38:48). He is only very rarely mentioned in BabT-Baha'T sacred writings (cf. AB* in
PP:12).
21\. DhO'l-Kifl j:Kil         (trad. N?), 'The twice recompensed' (Q.x 2 = 21:85; 38:48) is an
unknown figure, thought by al-Tabari to be a pious nabr (prophet) named Bishr (or Bashir),
allegedly a son of Job ( Tarikh, 1:195,). 1 Other Islamic sources variously, for example, reckon
that he was Joshua, Ezekiel, Elijah, a cousin of Elisha or Zacharias (ThalabT, Ara7s, 144-5,
231-2; Kisal, qsa,s, trans. Thackston, 204, 351 n. 97; 399-400). He remains an obscure figure
and is very rarely named in BabT-Baha'T primary sources (Tarikh,1:195).2

22\. Yonus , 0.4,?. M [=R]+N (= Heb so, yOnah) Jonah who may be the (mythical?) son of

Amittai [Mattai] (8th cent. BCE?; II Kings 14:25). One biblical book and one quranic sora bear
the name of Jonah (Q.10). In the Q. Jonah appears as a sent messenger and a prophet and
is 4 [+2] times mentioned in 4 [+2] sOras. He seems once designated dhu'l-nan ("Lord of the
fish", Q. 21:87) and once sahib al-hat ("Man of the Fish", Q. 68:48). 1 Having been swallowed
but cast out of a large fish (al-hawt) he was called by God to prophesy against a people (100,
000 or so Assyrians of Ninevah) whom he induced to faith (Q. 37:139ff).

The story of Jonah is frequently interpreted allegorically in esoteric (iriao Shin-
Shaykhi sources and occasionally in Babi-Bahal primary texts. In his commentary upon the
basmala and letter "n" ( 1:1 nan) prefixed to Sara 68, BA* explained that among the
innumerable significances of "n" is "fish" (a1-1.70t)a sense it also has according to the Hebrew
of the jafr alphabet of Ibn Sina (Massignon 1997:70). Figurative understanding of the story
of Jonah and the fish is reckoned to indicate Muhammad as one "drowned in the ocean of
ecstatic revelation (bah,- al-mukashifat) and mystical insight" (INBMC 56:38-9). AB* gave
allegorical explanations to the story Jonah and Dhol-Nan. In one text he states the "fish" (hat)
represents the human propensity to materiality, the danger of being engulfed in the dark
"ocean" of contingent existence (Maldih 5:21).

23\. s Uzair , J.J.;.c. N (=? Heb. RJR, 'ezra'), Ezra, (N) the biblical sage and scribal priest of the

Archaemenian monarch Artaxerxes I (fl. late 5th cent. BCE? early 2nd Temple Period). He led
some exiled Jews from Babylon back to Jerusalem and is believed to have been the post-exilic
restorer of the Mosaic Law (Ezra; 4 Ezra). Ezra is only mentioned in Q. 9:30 (cf. Q. 2:259)
which probably records the opinion of Medinan Jews that he was the ibn Allah (Son of God;
so Ayoub, 1986). The issue of Ezra's "sonship" is several times mentioned and contested by
the Bab. BA* and AB* rarely refer to Ezra save in connection with his role as restorer of the text
of the Torah.
24\. Luqman, 6tr..1 (N) an unknown figure (Q. 31 [title]; 31:12-13 [x2]) though traditionally a son

of Ad, a wise and pious sage and one al-mu'ammar, ("one long-lived"), a venerable Aesop-like

Both a name of a book of the Hebrew Bible (one of the 'minor prophets') and a sal-a of the
Qur'an (Q.11) are after this legendary (?) figure (cf. ll Kings 14:26 + New Testament refs.).

teller of fables. Associated with the Islamic wisdom tradition, he occasionally figures in this role
in BabT-Baha'T primary sources. In the Valley of hayra ("Wonderment ") of his mystical Haft
VadT (Seven Valleys, 1858 CE), BA* cites a saying of Luqman whom he says had "drunk from
the wellspring of 17/kmat and tasted of the waters of mercy" (SV: 34-35). As far as I am aware
this is the only substantial reference to Luqman in Bal3T-Bahal primary sources.

25\. Dhal-Qarnayn, &I.; Jill 11 ([trad.] N?), 'Possessed of two horns' is three times mentioned

in the sot-a of the Cave (18:82-98 only). Though this is not at all certain, various Syriac and
many post-quranic Islamic sources apply this epithet to Alexander the Great (III of Macedon,
356 -323 BCE). Islamic sources make many identifications of Dhu'l-Qarnayn including for
example, al-Khidr (the 'Verdent') and (in certain Shi s T sources) 'AIT b. Abi Talib (d.40 /661)
(MajlisT,Bilyar 2 12:172ff; Mittwoch, SEI:76). AB* repeats this latter identification with 'All but
finds ramzT, a cipher or esoteric sense in every aspect of his scriptural story which he classifies
as existing in verses mutashablhat ( "needing interpretation"; Tablet to Jinab-I NushabadT in
Ma'idih 2:42-3).

According to Q.18:94 Dhu'l-Qarnayn built a barrier to protect the people from the
(ultimately eschatological) ravages of Ya'j0j and Ma'j0j ( s Gog and Magog',cf. Q. 21:96,
Ezek.38-39; Rev.20:8). Both the Bab and BA* interpreted the quranic story Dh0'I-Qarnayn and
mystically applied this epiphet to themselves. In QA 76 the Bab exegetically rewrites, in waly,
(revelation mode) parts of the story of Dhu'l-Qarnayn (Q. 18:83ff). As the eschatological Imam
'All, the Bab in various ways identified himself with Dh01-Qarnayn. It was in this imamological
persona that he made various abstruse dualistic pronouncements regarding his theological
station. In dialogue with God he at one point in QA 76 writes,

> 0 Solace of the Eye[s]! The people shall ask thee about Dhi'l [Dhu'l]-Qarnayn.
> Say [then in reply]: 'Yea! By my Lord!
> I am indeed the King of the two Originations (malik al-bad'ayn)in the two horns
> [eras, dominions?] (al-qamayn).
> I am the elevated possessor of a Horn [Dhu'l Qarn] in the two bodies (al-fismayn).
> I am the Sinaitic Fire in the two cosmic Waters (al-ma'ayn).
> I am the cosmic Water (al-ma) in the two [Sinaitic] Fires (al-narayn).
So hearken unto my call from these two [Sinaitic] Mounts (al-turayn). ..

> We verily, established him [= Dhu'l-Qarnaun = the Bab] in the land and
> We, in very truth, bestowed a letter [of the alphabet] from the name of the
Dhikr upon this Arabian Youth (al-ghulam al-arabi = the Bab) such that

> the ways and means to all ends became his
> In his early Edirne Lawti-i Sayy,N7 ("Tablet to the Traveller" c.1864 CE?), BA* similarly
seems to rewrite with reference to his theophany aspects of the story of Dh01-Qarnayn At one
time BA* also identified "Gog and Magog" with his dual latter-day Babi antagonists Mirza Yabya
Non   (his half-brother) and Sayyid Muhammad IsfahanT, subsequently considered antichrists
of the Babi era (Ma'idih 4:99, cf.146).
• Jesus and Christian origins.
00\. Zakariyya,1."4 , N, Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist (fl. 1st cent. BCE/CE., Lk
1, etc) is seven times mentioned in four sOras of the Q ( 3:37f; 6:85; 19:2f, 21:89). He had
charge of Mary, the mother of Jesus in the Jerusalem Temple (Q. 3:37f). Despite his advanced
age and the barrenness of his wife (Elizabeth) God granted him the (allegedly) uniquely
named son Yabya (Q.19:7b). In Islamic sources he is one of the ultra pious believed to have
suffered cruel martyrdom. Occasionally mentioned in Babi-Bahal primary sources both the Bab
and BA* refer to traditions of his martyrdom.
26\. Yahya, cnot.›.,,,. (N) = John the Baptist (> Syr. Yobannan?) executed by Herod Antipas c.
29-34 CE. He apparently renounced the priesthood, lived as an ascetic, announced the near
advent of the kingdom of God and preached a baptism of repentance. Very few details are
given in the Q. where he is five times mentioned in 4 sOras (Q. 3:39; 6:85; 19:7,12; 21:90). The
angels make mention of his birth as musaddaq bi-kalimati min Allah (one "confirming a
Word [= Jesus] from God" Q.3:39). Given hikma (wisdom, judgement) as a child he was
exhorted to "take firm hold of the Book (kitab= the Torah) (Q. 3:46). Yabya is called a sayyid
(leader, authority) and his piety is celebrated, "and [We gave him Yabya] /. 7annan (compassion,
tenderness) from Us and zakat (goodness, purity); making him taqf (pious, godfearing,
devout) and kind to his parents, neither arrogant nor rebellious" (Q.19:13-14).

Though the Bab rarely mentions Yabya, BA* quite frequently referred to him and cited
the NT record of his words (e.g. IQ:95ff). This especially during the Edirne period (1863-8)
when he was countering the emergent Azali Babism of his half-brother MTrza Yalya Noll (c.
1841-1914). To this end BA* cited both the bible and Q. in his establishing his own claims. In
his K Badr' (c. 1868), for example, BA* specifically established a typology between himself

and Jesus and between the Bab and John the Baptist:

> By God! The theopahny (zuhür) of the Primal Point [of Reality = the Bab] and
> this most wondrous, most splendid theophany [= BA*] is the exact
> correspondence of the theophany of Yalya ibn Zakariyya (= John the Baptist)
> and the Spirit of God [= Jesus] (K. Badr,114).1

Though the Q. refers to Yalya (John the Baptist) as a nabT (prophet), BA* in his K Badf
apparently elevates the status of Yahya to that of a rasa/ and the herald of a rasa/ (= Jesus).
This in the light of the fact that both he (BA*) and the Bab were maghar-i ilahr (= ras01):

> Yalya was a nabT (prophet) and a rasül (envoy-messenger) from God and,
> moreover, a herald of the forcoming theophany (zuhar) [of Jesus]. Wherefore
> did he say, "0 people! I announce unto you the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of
> God and it has assuredly drawn nigh.. (K.Badi',114).

Extending further this typological parallelism, BA* associates Yahya-John the Baptist with a
new religious law (shari'a) and with the baptizing Sabaeans (=, SabrOn, Q. 2:62; 5:69; 22 :17
= Mandaeans ?]), remnants of whom exist today in southern Iraq, Iran, the USA and other
western locations (Drower, [1937] rep.1962; Gunduz, 1994). As AzalT Babis adhered to Babi
legalism and continued to await a future messianic theophany so, BA* states, did the followers
of Yalya (John the Baptist= "Sabeans" = Mandaens) act similarly by continuing to await the
appearance of a saviour (K.Badr, 114ff; AA 4:233) .
00\. Maryam, io...).. (Heb. •07 -0, Miryam, Miriam), Mary the mother of Jesus (d. c.3? CE; Q.19

[title] and x 34 in 12 soras) is the only woman called by her proper name in the Q. though often
in the phrase Isa b. Maryam (Jesus son of Mary, Q. x 24). The qur'anic stories of the
annunciation-conception and birth of Jesus to some degree reflect Christian apocryphal writings
and select Gospel pericopae. The virgin birth is upheld (Q.19:21; 21:91; 56:22) as is the
chastity of Mary who is once curiously referred to as the "sister of Aaron" (Q.3:37-8;
66:12;19:29). The Bab BA* and AB* all salute the purity of the virgin Mary and affirm the
"miracle" of the virgin birth. BA* referred to her in his K.Tqan as an tarat- i kubra ("that
Supreme Countenance", SE* tr., "most beauteous countenance") and mukhaddara-yi baqa'
(SE* tr., "that veiled and immortal Countenance") (KI: 43-4/ 36-7).

typological parallelism is also spelled out in other alwah of BA*. See especially his Sarat
i This
al-asma'(IQ:95ff)

AB* explained her bearing qur'anic epithet "sister of Aaron" as intimating her being pure
like Aaron not a sister of the brother of Moses. SE* seems to have affirmed the reality of her
"Immaculate conception" (being born with the stain of 'original sin'), though he may have
confused this with the Virgin birth itself (PDC:53; LDG:123). With Fatima and other "exalted
heroines" Mary is seen by Baha'Ts as the outstanding woman of the Christian era (SE*
GPB:347). It is Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene who are especially exalted in
Baha'T literature.
27\. 'Tsa,&........c R+N+M* (= Heb. Aram. Yesho[a], a late form of the name Joshua, 'YHWH

saves'; cf. Gk. /e,usous) Jesus (c.- 6?- c.30 CE?) the founder of that Jewish faction which
became Christianity. He has a prominent, elevated place in the Q. (x 93 times in 15 sOras). As
the "son of Mary" (Q. x 33) he allegedly spoke from the cradle (Q. 3:41; 5:109;19:30). Jesus
both affirmed the Torah and received the Injil (evangelion= Gospel[s]) from God (Q. 3:43f; see
1\.4 below). Not literally "a son of God" or a deity consubstantial with God (Q. 9:30f; 5:19f;
43:59), Jesus is said to be al-masT17 (the messiah, Qx11), a prophet (nabT)and a messenger
(rasa° as well as His "Word" (kaliMat; Q. 3:45;4:171) and a "Spirit (rah) from Him" (Q.
4:171); one aided with the "Holy Spirit" ( bi-ra1. 7 al-quds; Q. 2:81; 5:109:19:30; 58:22). While
Jesus' ability to perform miracles (= ayst, "signs") is affirmed and several times evidenced (Q.
3:43f; 5:110f) his crucfixion appears to be denied (Q. 4:155f). Though his ascension is
mentioned (Q. 4:157) Jesus' second coming or role at the eschaton is only alluded to (Q.
43:61) (Anawati. s 'isa' El 2 IV:81-6; Wensinck [Bosworth], 'al-Masil-y EI 2 V1:776; Parrinder, 1965
esp. 55ff). 1 Islamic sources greatly expand and celebrate the figure of the Islamic Jesus and
see him as a very great prophet and servant of God, the "Spirit of God" (rüh Allah).
Babi-Bahal primary sources exalt and frequently refer to Jesus.

Babi-Baha'T primary sources greatly exalt and frequently refer to Jesus. In his
commentary on the Islamic tradition man sarafa nafsahu (He who has known himself..) the Bab
in Sufi fashion has referred to Jesus as the ashraf al-anbiya' ("most honourable of the
prophets) (INBA Ms. 6007C:64). Going beyond the qur'anic and later Islamic exaltation of

The more than 500 or so year period between Jesus and Muhammad is often regarded in
Muslim sources as a period when the people remained without a concrete or outward ',neat ('Proof',
Guide') for 250 or 400 or more years after Jesus (E07.7ar 2 14: 234; 347).

Jesus, BA* affirmed his (subordinate) divinity and position as an exalted maghar-i "lain- with
all that this entails. In his L. Hirt& (1872 CE) he states that a true appreciation of the exalted
station of Jesus is "beyond the comprehension of humanity".

In line with the Q. BA* rejected the trinity and the incarnation of the absolute Godhead
(dhat al-dhat). Unlike most Muslims he affirmed the historicity of Jesus' salvific death upon the
cross. Reminiscent of Shri martyrology he viewed Jesus' death on the cross as an historical
event of cosmic, soteriological magnitude and regenerative power (L. Ibn., IQ:98, tr. GWB:85).
AB* demythologized the NT resurrection narratives also giving spiritual interpretations to Jesus'
miracles and to the NT resurrection narratives (SAQ, index). Both the Bab and BA* claimed
to be the spiritual "return" of Jesus and are so regarded by modern Baha'Ts (SE* Disp. 50 citing
AB*). From the mid-late Edirne period BA* claimed to be the second coming of Jesus. He
claimed that at the eschaton he had come in the station of the "Father". In his L-Sarraj (c.
1867) BA* refers to Jesus as "my Son in the Supreme Concourse (mala' al-a7a)"(MA 7:05, cf.
112). He drew numerous parallelisms between himself and Jesus and addressed both the
Italian Pope Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti, Pius IX (1846-78) and the whole ecclesiastical
panoply of oriental and occidental Christendom.

e,,
28\. Muhammad, ..L....NA R+N+M*, Muhammad b. 'Abd-Allah (c. 570-632 CE) is mentioned

four times in four sores of the Q. SOra 47 is named after this Arabian prophet-messenger who
from time to time communicated an Arabic Q (= "recitation") in 114 sOras of varying length.
Muhammad believed that he was restoring and updating the perspicuous, "clear" (mubin)
religion of Abraham. Considered by Muslims to be the greatest of the past messenger-prophets,
Muhammad was designated the khatam al-nabbiyyTn, the acme (trad. "seal"= "last") of the
prophets" (Q. 33:40b)

The BabT-Baha'T religion grew out of ShrT Islam in a manner similar to the emergence
of Christianity from sectarian Judaisms. The Bab and BA* greatly praise and elevate
Muhammad. They regard him as eternally much more than an inspired human being seeing him
as a very exalted and pre-existent maghar-i ilahl. They always speak positively of the Islamic
religion and its founder prophet. The Bab wrote a fifty or so page Arabic treatise in propf of the
mission of Muhammad, his sometimes esoteric Risala frl-nubuwwat al-Khassa (1847) which
was addressed to the then crypto-Christian, governor of Isfahan, Manuchihr Khan (d.1847).

BA* often and in various ways identified himself with the exalted, divine Muhammad, as well as
with Jesus and other elevated pre-Islamic agents of God:

> Say: By God! I, verily, am 'All [Muhammad, the Bab] in the kingdom of Eternity,
> and Muhammad in the JabarOt of Names, then the Spirit (al-r0 = Jesus) in the
> plains of Eternity (mada'in al-baqa) and also [Imam] 171 usayn in this greatest
> theophany ( zuhür)( BA* K. Badis,151)

Muslims, Babis and Baha'Ts all affirm the God-given status and reality of the
abovementioned twenty-eight agents of God. They are all either mazhar-I ilahT and/ or nabT
"lesser prophets". Additionally, as will be seen below, the Bab and BA* upheld the divine status
of a number of further pre-Islamic biblical and non-biblical figures. Among them Zoroaster (fl.
C. 1200 BCE??), another Isma'TI (Ishmael), a second David, and Gautama Buddha (d.c.486
or c.368?). Echoing ideas rooted in Jewish, Christian and Islamic gnosticizing factions as well
as various Isma'TIT thinkers, developed Baha'T doctrine also sanctions the historicity and
exalted status of several biblical figures not counted among the CIO al-'azm, including
Melchizedek, King of Salem and contemporary of Abraham (fl.c. 2100 BCE?) and Joseph the
one time ruler in Egypt and a prototype of BA*.

For Muslims, BabTs and Baha'Ts all the above more than 28 figures in varying ways
contributed to human progress by representing God. Some are of relatively minor importance
in Islamic salvation history and are seldom mentioned in BabT-Baha'T primary sources. Others,
for some Shi'T, Isma'TIT and Irfani Sufi authorities, as well as for the Bab and BA*, were
important divine (Per.) mazhar-i &MT (manifestations of God). In this exalted category are
usually included (1) Adam, (2) Noah, (3) Abraham, (4) Moses, (5) Jesus and (6) Muhammad.
With additions and variations (-->) this list is basically an expansion of the Islamic 010 al-azm
("possessors of steadfastness").
• The myriad prophets and the Chi al-azm (possessors of steadfastness)

The traditional number of around twenty-eight prophet figures was vastly expanded in
Islamic sources. The Q. itself holds that God sent a nab?, rasül and / or a nadhir ("warner")
to every people (Q.10:48) to deliver a clear message (al-bahlgh al-mubin, Q. 29:18b; 35:24;
10:47; 40:28). In this light al-MaqdisT in his K al-bad' wa g-tarTkh (The Book of Creation and
History' , 355/966) recorded from Wahb b. Munabbih a tradition of their having been
twenty-three prophets in Sheba alone; one named Hanzala ibn Afyon (Safwan) al-Sadiq and

another called Khalid b. Sinan al-Absi who was active in Arabia during the fatra (the silent
'interval') separating Jesus and Muhammad (Maqdisi, I11:1).

The names then of only a small proportion of the numerous past prophets and other
figures such as sages, kings and philosophers etc find mention in the Qur'an itself (Q. 4:164).
Some post-qur'anic Islamic traditions indicate a very large number of Israelite prophets. Ibn
'Abbas, for example, reckoned there had been 1,000 besides other divinely sent figures,

> Between Moses son of Imran and Jesus son of Mary was [a period of] 1,900
> years. There was no fatra ['cessation' in divine guidance] between these two
> for between them He [God] sent 1,000 prophets (nabr) of the children of Israel;
> in addition to others whom He sent besides them... (cited Ibn Sa s d, Tabaqat
> 1:53).

A similar prophetic tradition relayed through the 8th Shrite Imam, 'All al-Rida' (d. 201/818)
reads,

> God... created 124,000 nabi(prophets) and 1 [Muhammad] am the most noble
> of them... and God created 124,000 wag (successors) and 'Ali is the most
> noble of them... (Bihar 2 11:30-31).

Other Sunni and Sh'i traditions speak of 124,000 bearers of the divine message, a
number of whom, often 313 or so, were reckoned rasül . The Sunni Mishkatal-ma,sabin (Niche
of Lights) of TabrtzT records that Muhammad told AbO Dharr of the number of al-mursalIn
('sent messengers'), "There have been three hundred and between ten and twenty all told".
Alternatively, it is reported that the prophet told Abo Dharr of "A hundred and twenty-four
thousand among whom were three hundred and fifteen rusul (messengers) all told" 1 (al-
TibrizT, Mishkat, III:1599, Nos. 5737-8; trans. Robson, 11:1229). In Shri texts the same or
similar figures are given. MajlisT records the following tradition from 'Ali cited in Tabarsi's
Majma' al-bayan;

> God raised up a black prophet (nal:T an aswad) whose story he did not relate
> unto us. The traditions (al-akhbar) differ as to the number of the prophets (al-
> anb)"a). Some have related that their number is 124,000 while others have it
> that the number of the prophets is 8,000; 4,000 coming from the children of
> Israel and 4,000 from elsewhere with a "sign" (b/-ayah)... with a miracle and
> a proof (Bihar 211:21).

'This reckoning the number of rusul (al-mursalon) at 313 corresponds to the number of persons
who participated in the first major battle of Badr (2/624) (Friedman, 1989:50.fn.4). BabT-Baha'T sources
extend the symbolic applicability of this number to the alleged Bag battling companions who fought the
(for Balms) eschatological battle(s) in the service of the Qa'im (= the Bab) at the fortress of Shaykh
TabarsT in Mazandaran (Lambden, 1986:28-9 fn.36.).

In his K a/-Bad' wa il-fa/71(h the Shri historian al-MaqdisT gives many details regarding
the various prophets (anb)'a). He notes the Islamic traditions (akhbar al-muslimIn) reckoning
124,000 nabf and 313 (or in his opinion 315) nabf-mursal (ras171 = sent messengers) also
having prophetic status (MaqdisT, 111:10. Other Islamic traditions reckon the pre-Islamic prophets
(anb)'a' + mursalün) at either 8,000; 124,000 or 224,000 (Friedman1989:50-51; Schimmel
1985:55f). ShT'T sources count many myriads of divine messengers and a similarly large
number of attendant wag (successor, agent) and walf (allies) are listed.' Numerous actual
or mythical ancient Persian (possibly Zoroastrian), Indian (Hindu) and other figures swell yet
further the names of those mentioned in a range of Islamic sources.

In Islamic sources groups of those among the twenty-eight prophets (<--) and others
have, for various reasons, been classified together. Wahb b. Munabbih, for example,
transmitted a tradition of fivefold groupings: there were five Hebraic apostles (Adam, Seth, Idris
[Enoch], Noah, and Abraham) and five Arab apostles (Salih, Hud, [Ibrahim] Ishmael, Shuayb
and Muhammad) (cf. Bihar 2 11:32ff). Another important grouping is that of the aia al-'azm,
those "characterized by steadfastness" which will now be considered
• The ala al- 'azm, those "characterized by steadfastness" (Q. 46:35).

In Shi'T texts certain rasül are representatives of nubuwwat al-tashrr (legislative
prophethood) being empowered to found and maintain new religions and institute religious
laws. They bring a new sharra (law) while related nabf are placed on subordinate leve1.2
Though the Q. and certain 1.7acilth have it that the faithful should make no distinction between
the various messengers of God, some rusul (messengers) were exalted above others (Q.
2:253;17:55; 46:35). The quranic mentions of unity yet distinction among the prophets inspired
statements of oneness and brotherhood as well as hierarchical theories. 3 The favouring of

KulTni, al-Kali 1:223ff; Bibar 2 11:30ff. Numerous ShT'T sources record traditions that plot
throughout history the appearance of major prophet figures and their immediate successor(s) after the
typology of Muhammad and 'AIT.
2Refer,KulTnT, al-Kaff,

I:174f, 223ff ; Corbin, En Islam 1:235f; cf. Wensinck, 1932:204. 1
3An interesting prophetic liacilth is relayed from Aba H urayra is recorded in the Qisas al-anbiya-
of ThalabT (-->4.1), "The prophets (al-anblys) are brethren (alfhwat ) though of various mothers and
their religion is one (dinuhun wahid, Qisas: 403).

"some above others" (Q. 2:253a) in terms of the favoured rank of those considered WO al-'azm
will be noted as it is primarily these figures who became Babi-Bahal mazhar-1 llahi
(manifestations of God).

The qur'anic phrase Cde al-'azm came to have important prophetological implications
in post-qur'anic Islam. It was much discussed and by many thought to be indicative of exalted
rusul (sent messengers) as (sometimes) pre-existent beings endowed with constancy of
mission, moral and intellectual infallibility (ma'sam) and the power of waiy(divine revelation).
In Shi s T sources the   co al-'azm are the major founders of religions with a binding sharia'
("revealed law") relevant to a given community (umma) or to all humanity (Bihar 2 11:34ff) . Al-
MaqdisT expressed a subsequently widely held opinion when he wrote, "of the               co al-'azm
among the rusul there are five: [1] Noah [2] Abraham [3] Moses [4] Jesus and [5] Muhammad
(Bad' wal-tarikh, I11:7). This is in line with traditions ascribed to the twelver Imams
enumerating the ola al-'azm recorded in MajlisT's Bihar (11:34ff). In the following example
Imam Ja'far al-Badiq is cited as saying:

> I heard AbO 'Abd Allah say, 'The elite (sada)of the prophets (al-nabiyyin)and
> messengers (al-mursalin) are five. They [five] are the CIO al-'azm (ones
> "endowed with steadfastness") among the messengers (al-rusul). Around them
> the mill-stone (al-raha / ruhTy) [of reality] turns: [they are] [1] Noah, [2]
> Abraham, [3] Moses, [4] Jesus and [5] Muhammad (Kati, 1:175).

The Bab and BA* go beyond these qur'anic and Islamic norms by allotting theophanic
status (= mazhar-I ilahT) to those mentioned in various Shi s i lists of the ala al-'azm adding
others to them. They include the frequently listed five mentioned above with the addition of
Adam and others.' Those divine manifestations are [1] Adam [2] Noah, [3] Abraham, [4]
Moses, [5] Jesus and [6] Muhammad (-->). 2 To this basically Abrahamic list, developed, more

Adam, Dawod (David) and others are not normally included in Islamic lists of the 010 al-"azm.

0n those marked with [0] see below .That Zoroaster, Melchizedek, David (1&2?), Jospeh son
of Jacob [Israel], John the Baptist and others are counted in developed Bahn texts as maghar-1 i/ahf
will be taken up below.

globally minded, Baha'i theophanology adds the biblical figures, Melchizedek, King of Salem
(Ar. Malik al-Salam, fl.c. 2100?), Joseph son of Jacob [Israel] (<--), possibly David the biblical
king of Israel (d.c. 967 BCE <-1) and another pre-Mosaic David? (>), John the Baptist (-->)
and certainly also the ancient Persian prophet Zarathara (= Zoroaster, fl. 1200 BCE?) As well
as Siddhartha Gautama, the akyamuni, and Buddha (Enlightened One d.c. 486 or 368
BCE)(AB* TAB 2:469 cf. 3:565). To these also, it seems, that Bahals add the earlier mythical
figure(s) (?) [Brahma-] Sri Krishna (4000 BCE??) (AB* PUP:446; PT:35; SE* GPB: 94 ). With
various additions and omissions the Bab and BA* become figures [8] and [9] in a largely
Abrahamic (+ Asian) list — the number nine, being the Bahal sacred number as the abjad
numerical value of the word baha'= 1+5+1+1= 9).

Like various Ismallis and other heterodox Islamic factions, Babis and Bahals see
Adam as an exalted figure far greater than the largely symbolic figure who features in the Bible
and Q. along with his wife Eve (hawa) in the Eden legend. His story is regarded as basically
symbolic, as is his "fall" which, for Bahals, is indicative of human frailty not a loss of the
ancient or pre-existent, heavenly status of an exalted primogenitor named Adam (-->). In
expressing these doctrines Babi-Baha'i writ echoes the high theophanology of gnostic Shrism
and, in the case of Melchizedek those ancient and modern gnosticizing factions which uphold
the exalted status of Melchizedek, King of Salem (Gen. 11 etc). As a prototype of both Imam
Husayn (d. 61/680) and BA*, Joseph becomes a mazhar-i ilahi going way beyond his biblical-
quranic status as a one-time notable in Egypt whose concrete historicity remains doubtful to
some biblical scholars and other academics.

The perspectives regarding the 010 al-azm among some Shri Sufis of the school of
Ibn al-'Arabi (—>) such as Sayyid 11 aydar Amuli (8th/14th cent.) is worth noting. In his Jami*
al-asrar (Summation of Secrets) he at one point goes beyond a listing of the usual CrIO al-azm
(+ Adam, cf. Anil', 281 [= § 553f]) by associating the "seven stars" with the sarat (form) of

the seven rusul (sent messengers) who are ala al-'azm. On this cosmic, esoteric level it is not
the usual five or six but seven who have a special relationship with ultimate realities ( *ind al-

muhaqqaqTn), (1) Adam, (2) Noah, (3) Abraham, (4) David, (5) Moses (6) Jesus and (7)
Muhammad (Jami', 237 §465). Not normally considered among the WO al-'azm both Adam
and a pre-Mosaic David are included here. Both these figures have an elevated position in
BabT-Baha'T prophetology and theophanology.

The Bab and BA* held that divine guidance to humanity through successive founder
messengers referred to as mazhar-I 'lain, was without beginning and will have no end. For
them divine guidance will last as long as human history endures. The Muslim claim that
Muhammad was the last of God's messengers was transcended by both the Bab and BA* as
will now be seen.

• 2.3 The BabT-Bahal transcendence of khatamiyya (Q.33:40b), the finality of
prophethood

> Muhammad is not the father of any man among but he is the rasal-Allah
> (Messenger of God) and the khatam al-nabbiyyln, (the 'seal' 'last'. 'acme') of
the prophets (Q. 33:40).

Understanding the reading khatam to mean "last" in Q. 33:40, Muslims have
considered this verse foundational for the post-queanic doctrine of the 'finality of
prophethood', that no nabT (or rasa° would appear after Muhammad, the final rasal Allah
(messenger of God). Probably echoing earlier claims of Mani (d. c. 277), the son of a Parthian
prince and messianic claimant (al-BTrUni, Sachau, 1879:190) the (Aramaic loanword?) khatam
came throughout the Muslim world to indicate that the succession of prophets was "sealed up"
or "ended" in Muhammad just as it had been in Mani. It was thought that after Muhammad
even after the eschatological consummation no future prophet would appear to found a new or
renewed religion. Many commentators on Q. 33:40 have it that the Islamic belief in the second
coming of Jesus indicates the reappearance of this nabi (a prophet) in a role subservient to
Muhammad and Islamic law on the Day of resurrection (ZamaksharT, al-Kashshaf, 3:544-5).
The finality of prophethood through Muhammad became a firmly accepted Islamic
dogma. Even though it is not at all clear that the absolute finality of prophethood was the
original intention of Q. 33:40, this is today a firmly entrenched in both Sunni and Shri

orthodoxy (Friedmann, 1986; 1989: 49ff). Any hint of another post-Islamic prophetic claim or
a challenge to the 'Jaz al-Qur'an (inimitability of the Q.) has generally met with the dire
consequences of theological castigation, accusations of heresy and imprisonment or death.
Early on in his lzhaq al-batil (The Crushing of Falsehood, 1845) on the basis of his analysis
the QA (-->) the third Shaykhi leader Karim Kh5n Kirmani (d. 1871) correctly accused the Bab
of such heresy as went well beyond the constraints of Shi s i piety.

From the outset of his six year messianic career (1844-50) the Bab in his QA. (mid.

1260/1844) and other writings (INBMC 91) challenged both the finality of prophethood and the
inimitability of the Q. In the light of his eschatologically charged, high Shisi-Shaykhi
imamology, he modified the standard understanding of the 'finality of prophethood' by
incorporating rewritten forms of the khatim al-nabiyyTn (Q.33:40b) into his first major work
(QA):

> 0 people of the earth! God did not create Muhammad the father of any of your
men but he made him in the midmost heart of the celestial Throne (Ii kabd al-

'arsh) for His greatest [eschatological] Day. God, hath in very truth concluded
this matter as something hidden and treasured up (QA 44:164)..

The Bab's rewrites of Q. 33:40 such as the above modify or pass over the note of finality which
most Muslims read into Q. 33:40b. He regularly all but negates any tone of the finality of
prophethood in Q. 33:40b. Through his supernatural link with the Dhikr, and/or occulted
twelfth Imam, the 11 ujjat-Allah (messianic 'Proof of God'), the Bab several times radically
modified any straightforward notion of the finality of prophethood.

In QA 4 the Bab addresses the ahl al-madina ("people of the city" of Shiraz?)
accusing them of polytheism if they acknowledge Muhammad as the "seal of the Prophets" and
affirm his book (the Q.) yet fail to bear witness to the fact that God also revealed the QA to
the Bab ("Our servant"; cf. Q. 2:23) which is certainly "the like of it" (the Q.). In QA 64 the Bab
similarly set down a messianic rewrite of Q.12:63 in the light of Q. 33:40. He exhorts believing

Muslims gathered before Muhammad, the khatam al-nabiyym, to utter the following words:
0 our father [Muhammad] the [messianic] dhikr ("Remembrance"), is a further

> measure (al-ka0 which has been denied to us. So dispatch with us, the sign of
> the Dhikr for the greater magnification (//'/-takbir al-akbar)... (QA 64:260).

A few sOras later in QA 66 the Bab speaks of a "Book" (= QA) sent down to inform the
people that the messianic Hupat -Allah (Proof of God = 12th Imam) is closely associated with
the Dhikr even the likeness of the tiujiat (Proof) nigh Muhammad, the khatam al-nabiyyin.
It seems to be implied that the messianic "Hour" is about to be realized through the close
relationship between the Dhikr (Remembrance) and the twelfth Imam or Huijat-Allah, the
messianic Proof of God. In subsequent years (1848-50) the sometimes thinly veiled 'messianic
secret' of the Bab's being the Qa'im / MandT was publicly broadcast and his more exalted claims
openly promulgated.

In their writings the Bab and BA* never ceased referring to Muhammad as the khatam
al-nabbiyin (INBMC 91; BA* KI:05ff/ 87ff). Q 33:40b was not understood as underlining the
finality of prophethood in the sense of outruling an eschatological theophany. Great messianic,
theophanological importance was given by the Bab and BA* to the qur'anic references to liqa'-
Allah, the latter day meeting or encounter with God (Q. 6:31;130,154; 7:51,147; 10:7ff; 13:2
etc). The word khatam in khatam al-nabiyrn need not signify "seal" implying "last" of the
prophets but more appropriately indicate Muhammad as the "acme of the prophets" during
the era before the yawm al-qiyama (Day of Resurrection) when the liqa'-Allah through a
messianic mazhar-1 ilahT would be realized. Then the liqa'-Allah is realized through the
parousia of the theophanic mazahar-1 ilahi. In it on these lines that BA* in his K iqan argues
that kha tam al-nablyyin as an epithet of Muhammad underlines the elevated nature of the
Arabian prophet and not the absolute finality of prophethood. Understood with the sense of
utter finality, khatam al-nabiyyin degenerates into one of the subtrnat al-fatal ("veils of glory")
which hinder the realization of unfolding reality (KI:129f/ 107f,136-7).

Among the earliest passages of BA* dealing with the issue of the khatam al-nablyyin
(Q. 33:40b) is his testimony to the theophanic mission of the Bab in his L. I- jurafat al-
muqatta'at (Tablet on the Isolated Letters, c. 1858). The Bab, it is said, came with all manner

of "dazzling proofs" though the people "waxed proud" in their denial despite the queanic
promise of the llqa"-Allah. When God sealed prophethood (khatama al-nubuwwat) through
Muhammad (Q. 33:40) "he gave the servants the glad-tidings of the encounter with Him [God]"
and the matter was "definitively resolved" (khatama al-makhtem). In the person of the Bab

> "God came [unto them] in the shadows of the clouds (if gulal al-ghamam,
> Q.2:210), breathed into the Trumpet of the Cause (nafakha fi sar al-amr; cf.
> Q.18:99; etc), split the Heaven asunder (Inshaqqat al-sama'
> cf.Q.55:37;69:16;84:1) and crushed the mountains to dust (Q.56:5;69:14, etc)
> whereupon all retreated back upon their heels (cf. Q.3:144;6:71) (Ma'idih, 4:65).

BA* continued to argue that in spite of the theophany of the Bab the people acted like
Jews and Christians. They continued to await the realization of the promises and the
eschatological 11'0-Allah. In his decade or so later lengthy Persian Tablet to 'Alf Muhammad
Sarraj (c.1867 CE), BA* himself touches upon the subject of the obscurity of eschatological
prophecies in Abrahamic religious scripture. He highlights the supremely clear implications
(asrah al-kalimat) of finality in khatam al-nabbiyyrn (Q. 33:40b) but thinks it as an
unacceptable veil inhibiting post-Islamic faith in another supreme agent of God. Despite its
implications of finality, pure-hearted persons still came to true faith in Point of the Bayan (bi-
ll-fan nuqta-y/ bayan = the Bob). Indeed, BA* adds, such pure-hearted persons so
comprehended the matter of khatimiyyat ("sealedness") that they would happily acknowledge
the appearance of a "prophet" (nabT) "from the beginning which has no beginning unto the end
which has no end" (L. Sarraj, Ma'idih, 7:28ff).

For the Bab and BA* the quranic khatam al-nabiyyTn in no way rules out the theophany
of divinity on the eschatological "Day of God" (yawm Allah). Even if it is taken to outrule the
finality of the appearance of a post-Muhammad nabT (prophet) or even rasal (sent one) it
does not outrule an eschatological theophany. Both the Bab and BA* claimed to be fully human
yet fully divine maghar-I llahT in a way that transcends issues revolving around the meanings
of khatam al-nablyyTn. In fact BA* so transcended these matters that in numerous
theophanological passages he presents himself as having sent out the nabT and rasal of the
pre-Islamic era. In an important Arabic Tablet of the Acre period BA* defends himself against

accusations that he has contradicted the Muslim understanding of Q. 33:40b by stating:

> You have assuredly confirmed [the truth] by what you have announced [in citing
> Q. 33:40b]. We do indeed testify that through him [Muhammad] messengership
> and prophethood (al-risala wal-nubuwwa)were sealed up. Whomsoever after
> him [Muhammad] makes claim to such an elevated station is indeed in manifest
> error.... The carpet of prophethood (b/sat al-nubuwwa) has been rolled up and
> there has appeared the one who sent them out (arsal) [=BA*] in manifest
> sovereignty.. (Untitled Tablet to 171 asan [L. Khatam al-nabbiyin]).

Baha'T arguments against the finality of prophethood usually operate on a somewhat
lower level than these elevated theophanological challenges. In modern Bahl apologetics a
distinction is often made between a future rasal as a founding mazhar-1 ilahi (Manifestation
of God) and the role of the (lesser) nabf or secondary prophet. Diverse lexical and Islamic
understandings of khatam (kh-t-m) are commented upon in the light of the non-finality of
prophethood. The Islamic understandings of Q. 33:40b might, it is sometimes held, outrule the
further appearance of Israelite type nabiyyTh (prophets) but this phrase does not negate future
appearances of rasal or mursalin (sent messengers) the like of which is hinted at in the
following qur'anic verse:

0 children of Adam! There shall come among you mursalin (sent messengers)
> from among yourselves rehearsing my signs unto you... (Q. 7:43)
> Many thousands of eschatological traditions were assiduously compiled into sometimes
bulky Istidlallyya (testimonia) tracts by 19th-20th century disciples of the Bab and BA*.
Considerable attention was given to overcoming any finality implied by Q. 33:40b. 1 Some at
BA's command followed the lead of the Bab's DalaV-1 sab717 and his own K-igan. This with
a view to arguing that all manner of messianic predictions and apocalyptic "signs" had come to
pass (cf. INBMC 80). Babis and Baha'Ts claimed that for many thousands of years divine
messengers (rusul) or mazhar-1 ilahi (divine Manifestations) will found and progressively
renew the eternal religion of God (= Islam).

It is today a central Babi-Bahal teaching that future divine messengers (rusul) or

See Gulpaygani, K. Fara'id, index; Ishraq KhavarT, QI:383ff; al-Tibyan waY-Burhan, I:59ff
RawshanT, Khatamiyyat; Momen 1999:34f, 87ff.

mazhar-I ilahT (divine manifestations) will, for many thousands of years, found and
progressively renew the eternal religion of God (= 'Islam). The Bb's claim to be the Shn
messiah did not prevent or inhibit his also predicting numerous future messianic advents of
the originally Sufi figure man yuzhiruhu-Allah (Goldziher, 1921 tr. Lambden & Walker 1992).
This is indicated in a passage from the Bb's K pan] sha'n (Book of the Five Grades; 1850
CE) where the following words could be taken to indicate an infinite number of future
theophanies of the BabT theophanic messiah, man yuzhiru-hu-Allah (He whom God shall
make manifest').

> .. And after the Bayan it is [ the theophany of] man yughiru-hu Allah (He whom
> God will make manifest) [1]. And after man yughiru-hu Allah [1] man yughiruhu
> Allah [2]. And after man yughiru-hu Allah [2] man yughiru-hu Allah [3]. And after
> man yuzhiru-hu Allah, [3] man yughiru-hu Allah [4]. And after man yughiru-hu
> Allah [4] man yughiru-hu Allah [5]. And after man yuzhiru-hu Allah[ 5] man
> yuzhiru-hu Allah [6]. And after man yughiru-hu Allah [6] man yughiru-hu Allah[
> 7]. And after man yughiru-hu Allah [7] man yuzhiru-hu Allah [8]. And after man
> yuzhiru-hu Allah [8] man yughiru-hu Allah [9]. (K. Panj: 314-5, cf. 397).

The position of the Bab is thus the exact opposite of the Islamic proponents of the
doctrine of the finality of prophethood. The mention of nine successive theophanies most likely
indicates their endless future realization. Towards the end of his life in his Haykal al-din
(Temple of Religion, 1266/ 1850) the Bab made increasing mention of "He whom God will
make manifest". He variously indicated the time of his advent at after nine (=1269/1852),
nineteen (= 1279 =1862-3) or between 1511 (abjad of Ar. gh)"ath = 'the Assistance') and
2001 years (abjad of Ar. mustaghath = 'The One Invoked for help') from 1260/1844
(MacEoin,1986:95-155). These latter figures were understood by BA* as either numerically
and messianically suggestive Names of God of non-chronological import, or allusions to the
time of another theophany after himself (BA* L. KhalTI ShTrazT; '0 Thou Creator 'mss).

• 2.4 Mazhariyya: The roots and significance of the BabT-Bahal concept of the mazhar-
i dahr ("Divine theophany", "Manifestation of God").

It was out of the abovementioned nexus of Islamic prophetological, imamological and

theophanological Sufi and Shrf-ShaykhT concepts, that the terminology and many aspects of
the BabT-Baha'T doctrine of the mazhar-i "la& evolved. The Bab personified the mashiyya
(Primal Will) and made it, as the mazhar-aanT (Manifestation of God), the centerpiece of his
theology. It was is by virtue of the mashiyya (Will) that God made himself indirectly known to
his creation through the mazhar of His own nafs , the Logos-Self which is the mazhar
(The Manifestation of God). In BabT-Baha'T usage zuhür indicates the divine tajalIT
(theophany, divine self-revelation) of God through his mazhar (theophanic manifestation) unto
the worlds of creation. The study of the background of the centrally important mazhariyya
(theophanological) doctrines within the BabT-Bahal religious universe of discourse, to some
degree illustrates how aspects of BabT-Bahal doctrine evolved out of heterodox Shrism in
a similar way to the emergence of Christianity from sectarian Judaisms. Only a few notes
pertinent to this can be set down here (cf. MacEoin, mazhar, El 2 VI:952-3).

Deriving from the triliteral Arabic root z-h-r which may verbally indicate 'to appear', 'be
manifest', the straightforward sense the Arabic noun of place mazhar (pl. mazahir cf. ?Shit;
'apparent', 'visible' 'outer', 'exterior') is a 'place of appearance'. It may also be indicative of
an 'outward expression' or 'mode of apparition', and thus additionally indicate a 'manifestation'
or 'theophany' (Corbin, 1972, IV:518, index). In his The Sufi Path of Knowledge Chittick
prefers to translate mazhar, "locus of manifestation" (Chittick, 1989:89).

The term mazhar has a long history and rich semantic field in a multitude of texts
expressive, for example, of the mediatory position of the prophets and imams as loci of divine
realities. Murata has stated that many "cosmologists employ terms like zuhür (manifestation)
and tajalIT (self-disclosure) to explain the relationship of the world to God" (Murata,1992:11).
Mazhar is a term that lies at the heart of certain prophetological and imamological speculations
within Islamic philosophy and theology. It is found within the writings of numerous exponents
of Shi'T mysticism, theosophy and gnosis.

In early ShT'T KhattabT [NusayrT) gnosis the pentadic "Five Companions of the Mantle"

(Muhammad, Fat im[a],       Hasan and 171usayn) represented by the initial letters of their names, become
"Names" or "Principles" as well as tajalliyat ('theophanies') and magahir (manifestations) of the "Light"

The terms zahir, zuhür, mazhar are frequently used and important within the
theologically loaded writings of Ibn al : ArabT and of persons falling within his 'school' (Chittick,
1988:201-221, 470 [index zuher, etc]; 1989:16, 478 index zuhar etc). Within the writings of I bn
al:ArabT mazhar is a theological term rooted in the exegesis of Q. 57:3, "He [God] is the zahir
(Manifest) and the batin (Nonmanifest) (Chittick, 1989:89; cf. Futuhat111:484-5). For the Great
Shaykh zuhar is used of the tajallT, the divine 'self-disclosure' or the 'manifestation' of God.
For him mazhar can indicate the locus of a particular divine Name (s) and/or Attribute (asma'
wa'llifat).

For Ibn al-'Arabi the terms zahir/zuhcirl mazhar have an important place in Islamic
thought ( Chittick, 1988:201-221, 470 [index zuhar, etc]; 1989:16, 478 index zuhür etc).
Mazhar is a frequently used theological term rooted in the exegesis of Q. 57:3, "He [God] is
the gahir (Manifest) and the balin (Nonmanifest) (Chittick, 1989:89). At one point in the
Futatot it is written, "God is the zahir (Manifest) who is witnessed by the eyes and the bafin
(Nonmanifest) who is witnessed by the intellects (al-'uq01)"(Fut.111:484-5). In his The Sufi Path
of Knowledge Chittick prefers to translate mazhar "locus of manifestation" (Chittick, 1989:89).
For Ibn al-'Arabi zuhÜr is especially used of the self-manifestation of God which is his tajalIT
(self-disclosure).

Among the many disciples of the "Great Shaykh" who have made fairly frequent use of
mazhar as a theophanological technical term was, for example, Ibn al : Arabrs son-in-law
Sadr al-Din Qonawi (d.673/1274). His K al-fula7k, (The Book of Unravellings) represents itself
as a 'key to the mysteries' of Ibn 'ArabT's Fusus al-hikam (Bezels of Wisdom). In his
exposition of the section revolving around the prophet Ismall (here no. 7) and the implications
of prophets being mazahir of the divine Names, Qunawi (commenting on Q.29:27a)
categorically states "Every prophet is a mazhar of one of the divine Names (ism min al-asma)
(K al-fukak, 209). The same is also stated in the section devoted to Muhammad: "every nabi

(Corbin, [1974] 1998:186-7).

is a mazhar of one of the Names of the Divine Reality (ism min asma' al-haqq; ibid, 310). In
the section on Shu'ayb it is stated that Moses' education (tarb)'at) was initially taught by
means of this Arab prophet. It was such that Moses' ayat (verses, signs) were according to the
dictates of the "outer Name" (ahka m al-ism al-zahir). When God desired the perfection of
Moses he sent him to KhicIr who is said to be a mazhar (manifestation) of the hidden [Inner,
Non-Manifest] Name (al-ism al-bat/n). (Ounawi, al-Fukak, 251).

Rajab al-BursT (d.c.814/1411) in his influential Mashariq compiled much of relevance
to this topic including a section dealing with the anbiya' (prophets) as mazahir asma' Allah
("manifestations of the Names of God"). They are all mazhar ism /a& ('manifestations of a
universal [divine] Name = Allah) whose sharra (law) is likewise universal. All the prophets and
messengers (nabr + rasa° are reckoned as archetypally revolving around the following seven
figures, (1) Adam, (2) Enoch, (3) Abraham, (4)Jospeh, (5) Moses (6) Aaron and (7) Jesus.
Among other things each prophet is associated with a particular divine Name. While Enoch, for
example, is described as a mazhar of the divine name al-hayy('the Living), Joseph is the
mazhar of the divine name al-murid (Disciple) associated with jamil (Beauty). Beyond them
Muhammad is the mazhar of the comprehensive divine Name (al-ism al-jam/)Allah as well as
the mazhar of the (supernal) Lights (al-anwar)(Mashariq, 32-3).

Within the Kalimat-i Maknanih (Hidden Words) of Mulla Mubsin Faycl al-Kashani
(d.1090/1679), another Shis i thinker much influenced by Ibn al-'ArabT, is a theologically
oriented section (kalimat) about the significance of al-zuhar (the Manifest) and al-mazhar (the
Manifestation). Within this section it is stated that "the manifestations of the True One (mazahir
al-haqq) is something independent (mutlaqa) since the mazhar-i ilahi is in that locale as
something [independently] evident (zahir) and manifest (mazhar)(manifest)" (Kalimat, 114-5).
Another section concerns the ultimacy of the of the theophany of the Ultimate Reality (zuhür
al-haqq). Relative to the mazahir (Manifestations) this is said to be by means of the Divine

Names (al-asma' al-ilahiyya). The Manifestation of the Name of Allah (mazhar ism Allah) is
identified as the person of the al-insan al-kamil (The Perfect Man [Human]). The perfection of

the name Allah is evident in the manifestation of the Universal Perfect Human (mazhar-ijamr-y/
insan-i kami'/).

Similar examples could be gleaned from numerous other philosopher-theologians of the
school of Ibn al-'ArabT and the 'School of Isfahan' and elsewhere. 1 The famed al-insan al-
kamg . (The Perfect Human) of the Shi s ite Sufi 'Abd al-Karim al-Jill (d. c.83211428 ) contains
a section dealing with the divine Names al-jalal(The Majestic) where iti s stated that for every
divine Name and Attribute there is a athar, a trace-impression which is a mazhar of divine jamal
(Beauty) or ja/a/ (Majesty). (New ed, 97).

. BA's uses of mazhar are numerous and generally fall into the theological-
theophanological pattern set in the writings of the Bab. BA's apophatic theology of the
mazhar-i darn' (Manifestation of God) , like that of the Bab (Lambden, 1997), categorically
bypassed the potentially pantheistic wandat al-wujad ("oneness of being") speculations of
Ibn al-'Arabi (not his terminology) and his devotees (BA*. Haft vadi, AQA 3:XX/ tr. Seven
Valleys, 39-40. The Unmanifest Godhead ever remains unknowably beyond number, gender.
And all limitations. He/She/It, the absolute Godhead is only indirectly manifested through the
mazhar dab! who, as the (subordinate) "God", makes the 'Wholly Other' knowable to human
beings. Scriptural (Q. + Bible) statements about God actually have apophatic significance or
only disclose something about his Will or His knowable mediatory theophanic manifestations.

As a theological term central to Babi-Baha'T usage marnar precludes any hint of hutal,
the 'incarnation' of the absolute Divine Essence (dhat al-dhst). The divine intermediary
mazhar-i ilahr (Divine Theophany, Manifestation) does not manifest the hidden,
incomprehensible Deity the dhat or dhat al-dhat. Rather, it is the totality of the (created) divine
Names and Attributes (al-asma' wa'l-sifat) that are exhibited in his Person. They are

The first Safavid ruler Shah Ismafil (d.93011524), a Sufi Shaykh and one time head of the
Qizilbash made use of mazhar in certain of his Turkish, distinctly (neo-) ghuluww (extremist) high
imamological and theophanologically oriented poems. Apparently referring to himself he states in one
poem (no. 259), 'A man (adam) has become a mazhar of the tyaqq( Ultimately Real).. My Beauty is a
mazhar of Our God (jamali marnar fighhum„.; Minorsaky, 1942: 1039a-1040a,194).

utterances of past prophets, sages and agents of God are interpreted in Babi-Bahn texts line
with the doctrines of s isma / ma 'sum, Majpr Messengers are pictured as all wise paragons of
pious virtue and miraculous power. Texts which contract this are allegorically or non-literally
interpreted (AB* SAQ III ch. 44). The hermeneutical maintenance of 7sma / ma:sam is a
Beal religious touchstone of exegetical integrity and historiographical soundness. In Babi-
Bahal exegesis , for example, Adam the mazhar-li Bahl- never sinned by eating the forbidden
fruit in the garden of Eden (Gen 2-3; Q.2:25; 20:115; cf. Q. 7:19).1

Following and expounding BA's teachings both AB* and SE* made the upholding of
'i;sma' an essential hermeneutical principle. AB*, for example, probably following Islamic
exegetical precedent, made lawful the Islamo-biblical notice that Abraham married his half-
sister (cousin) or aunt Sarah (cf. Gen.12:10f; Rippin El 2 IX:26-7) by writing,

> During the time of the Abrahamic Prophethood it was considered allowable,
> because of a certain exigency, that a man should marry his aunt, even as Sarah
> was the sister of Abraham's mother" (AB* PUP: 365)

BA* himself claimed (Per.) ismat-i kubra (the greatest infallibility ) which he also made
applicable to the Bab and the other maghar-i 'Lahr and to other lesser past worthies such as
the twelver Imams and various anbiya' (prophets) of Israelite history. While supreme
theophanies , the mazahir-i ikulliyya (universal manifestations) like the "Sun" have ismat-i
dhatiyya ("essential infallibility") other sanctified individuals and groups like "moons" luminous
with divine light, can only evince 'iSmat-i sifatiyya ("conferred infallibility") (SAQ. XLV:
129ff/171ff).

I The Baha'i exegesis of the story of Adam and Eve as explained by AB* is wholly removed from
the sphere of history. The story is symbolic of the plight of humankind in the material world. Adam
represents of the riiii-i Adam, the higher "spirit of Adam" (= humanity). Humanity (the first couple) fell
from paradise when Eve who represents the nafs-i Adam, the lower self of humanity, precipitated a "fall"
from spirituality as a result of being enticed bythe "serpent" (= materiality). To eat of the "fruit" of the "tree
of the knowledge of good and evil" is to be engrossed in the material world by the satanic lower self (AB*,
SAQ:92f /tr.122f cf. AB* explanation, "The Tree (shajarat)[ of the knowledge of good and evil] of his
eminence Adam is the reaching out to the [material] world (buirigh-i abm) Ma'idih 9:128-9).

(4) The ability to perform of miracles (mu:Pat).

Within Abrahamic scripture and tradition innumerable messengers of God, saints,
Imams and others are credited with the working of miracles. Such supernatural acts are dealt
with generally and specifically in Babi-Bahal primary literatures. Though the Bab is credited
with miracles in most 19th century Babi-Bahal hagiographical histories he most frequently
highlighted as his miracle his ability to reveal divine verses through watiy. For him this was the
true hallmark of his claim to divine maghar status (Ar.+P. Dala'il) . The Bab gave spiritual
interpretations to the various "miraculous" deeds of past prophets (e.g. Muhammad's alleged
the "cleaving of the moon" Q. 54:1f; P.Da1.13) and non-literally interpreted many cosmic
eschatological signs including, for example, the rising of the "Sun of Reality" (shams-i 1.7aqTqat)
in the "West" which he related to his theophanic appearance in ShTraz , (Fars, Iran) (P.Dal, 51-
BA* is also credited with numerous miracles in the Baha'T histories (cf. AB* SAQ IX tr.

34-5), miracles of revelation, prophecy, resurrection and human transformation, etc. Though
in his Satiffa-yi shaft iyya (Scroll of Gushing Torrent c. 1857) BA* plays down the miracles
attributed to him this phenomenon is discussed here (INBMC 57:10-18) as it is in other of his
alwati and in many writings and discourses of AB* (SAQ index). Miracles of past pre-Islamic
divine messengers such as those ascribed to Jesus in the Gospels are very largely given
"spiritual" interpretations in Baha'T sources. Examples of biblical miracles which are
'demythologized' or given "spiritual" interpretations include God's theophany before Moses
(Exod. 33:18-23; Q. 7:143) the Exodus and the crossing of the Red Sea (Exod. 13:17ff) and
the wars of the conquest of Canaan (Joshua 5ff),

> The miracles which took place during the war of the chidren of Israel with the
> ungodly which are mentioned in the Holy Bible (kitab-i muqaddas) have a
> spiritual interpretation (ta'w17) and meaning (maani). Despite this Baha'is do
> not seek to outrule or alter the miracles of the prophets (anbiya). (Ma'idih,

Most NT miracles are allegorically interpreted in Baha'T primary sources, including the feeding

to of (4) 5,000 ( Mk. 6:35ff + us; Jn 6:1-14), Jesus' walking on the water (Mk. 6:43ff+ //s Jn
6:15-21) various healing miracles and exorcisms, the raising of Lazarus, the resurrection of
Jesus and the various resurrection appearances (Lk. 24:13ff, etc). Miracles attributed to
Muhammad in various Islamic sources are likewise occasionally non-literally interpreted as are
various quranic apocalyptic "signs" mentioned in the Q. and traditions (Lambden, 1987).

The developed Babi-Bahal position regarding miracles is that they are accepted as
within the power of the mazhar-i ilahT though most mentioned in biblical and quranic scripture
and tradition are of largely symbolic import. They are thus "spiritually", non-literally interpreted.
The directly or indirectly witnessed power of wahy (divine revelation) is seen in Babi-Bahal
scripture as the supreme miracle, the hallmark of the divine providence.

In conclusion it can be stated here that Baha'Ts greatly revere the numerous
aforementioned mazhar-I Miff and affirm their ability to perform supernatural miracles. This
to such a degree that, transcending even Islamic norms, they consider their true station
incomprehensible to human intellects (BA* L. Hirtik). Modern Baha'is do not exhibit pictures of
the Bab, BA* or any of the other the mazhar ilahT (divine manifestations) out of respect for their
sublimity and as a safeguard against worshipping the form or person of the mazhar instead
of the transcendent God who called (indirectly) manifested them. The Bahl interpretation of
Abrahamic scripture and Isralliyyat traditions attempts to preserve the high theophanological
status of the divine messengers who are deemed infallible agents of the transcendent Deity.
In the Bahl view they have a human body but all other aspects of their Logos-like Being are
said to transcend worldly limitations.

Chapter Three
THE BIBLE AND ISRA'ILIYYÁT PT.1 :
TAFSTR, (QUR'AN COMMENTARY) AND AHADITH / AKHBAR
(TRADITIONS) IN ISLAMIC AND BABI-BAHAI PRIMARY SOURCES

• 3. 0 The Bible and Isralliyyat in Islamic and Babi-Bahn sources.

Islamicate (pseudo-) biblical citations and Israiliyyat traditions appear in numerous Islamic
sources. In the pages to follow (—> 2.1ff) some details will be given about select sources rich in
such materials along with a summary of their assimilation within Babi-Bahal primary sources.
Numerous Islamic literatures have a relationship to Abrahamic scripture and religious tradition.
Though the Judaeo-Christian origins of such assimilated materials has sometimes been played
down in reaction to the 19th-20th century missionary and orientalist attempts at demeaning Islam
by identifying its alleged pre-Islamic substrate, Islamicate Bible citations and Israiliyyat streams
of tradition are widely attested. Biblical motifs, citations and paraphrases in Islamic sources as well
as Isralliyyat rooted traditions are often fully Islamicate. They often express a symbiosis, an Islamic
intertextual re-creation having become an integral part of an Islamic universe of discourse.

The Bab and BA* rarely identified their precise Islamic and other literary sources. They
sometimes drew upon Abrahamic scriptural materials and pseudo-biblical texts which were
subsequently reinterpreted thus adding a further Babi-Baha'T level of meaning. As will be seen,
the Judaic-rooted, Islamic al-sm al-a'zam (mightiest Name of God) concept is interpreted in this
way. So also aspects of the biblical-quranic Joseph story. Drawing on Islamic prose and poetical
sources, Babi-Baha'T writings give post-Islamic messianic, theophanological and other senses to
biblical and Islamic traditions.

A selection of closely interrelated Islamic literary sources showing the presence or
influence of the Bible and Isralliyyat will now be surveyed. This in the first four of the following
fourteen literary divisions all of which include significant bodies of biblical and /or Isralliyyat rooted

materials. The following list is not in any strictly historical orderl

> Tafsfr (Q. commentary) and associated works;
> Ahadith / Khabar (Compendia of traditions);
> STra (biographical works) and other forms of Tarikh (history writing);
> Folklore traditions and asas al-'anbiya' ('Stories of the prophets') works;
> Fada'il (Excellences) and associated works;
> Islamic messianisms, eschatological traditions and apocalyptic works;
> Early Shrism, the ghulat, (extremist factions), (proto-) Ismallism, etc.
> Arabic gnomological traditions, wisdom literatures and philosophical compendia
> Adab (belles lettres), encyclopaedias and associated doctrinal-theological works;
> The 'ulem al-ghayb, (Islamic esoterica);
> Islam and the encounter with religions:
> (a) Islamicate pseudo-biblical and pseudepigraphical texts;
> (b) K al-masail ('Questions and Answers') and Ititijaj (Religious disputation) works;
> (c) The Mcitazda ("Seceders") and the Mutakalli'man (Rationalist theologians):
> Muslim exponents of 'ilm al-kalam (Dogmatic Theology) works and expressions
> of dialogue;
> (d) DalaW (Testimonia), Muslim Proof texts.
> (e) Polemical refutations of pre-Islamic religions;
> (f) Islamic heresiographical and associated works.

[12]    Sufi hagiographical, mystical, Ishraqi and theosophical (irfanT) literatures;
[13]    Persianate Sufi and poetical writings;
[14]    Devotional texts and literatures: Salat, Namaz, Dua, Munajat, Ziyarat-namin.

Though most of these Islamic literary channels in which Isra'iliyyat including (pseudo-)
biblical materials are found were drawn upon within BabT-Baha'T primary texts, only the first four
sections (3.1-2; 4:1-2) of this list can be discussed here. A very limited portion of materials falling
within 5-14 (above) will be utilized within the chapters to follow. Chapter 5 below will cover
aspects of the Bible and Isra'iliyyat in connection with select literatures of the Safavid and Qajar
periods as well as dimensions of the dialogue with missionaries. Paragraphs in chapter 6 on the
Bible and Israrniyyat in early Shaykhi writings will bring aspects of these issues up to the early
Qajar period when the Babi-Bahal religions emerged.

Prophetological and qisas al-anbiya' motifs, stories and associated materials exist within a very
large variety of Islamic literary sources including the 14 categories listed above. They are encapsulated
within a variety of literary forms and subjected to diverse hermeneutical transformations. In his All the
King's Falcons Renard usefully listed the following categories into which such Islamicate prophetological
materials might be divided. With an indication of where they correlate with my own (above-mentioned) list
they are [1] Quranic prophetology (--> 3.1,4- 5), [2] Historical prophetology (-->3.3), [3] Philosophical
prophetology (—>3 .8), [4] Theological prophetology (-->3. 2. 9,11), [5] Theosophical prophetology (-->
3\.12-13) and [6] Mystical prophetology (--> 3.10+12-13). The difference between Renard's categories (5)
and (6) is not particularly distinct.

• 3.1 The Bible and Isra7liyyat in TafsTr (Qur'an commentary)

Undue reliance on Judaeo-Christian traditions relayed by ahl al-kitab (People of the Book)
for exegetical and other purposes came to be frowned upon in certain early Muslim circles (<-1.1).
Such caution, however, failed to prevent the widespread exegetical use of Isralliyyat in numerous
early and later tafsTr works.' As one might legitimately speak of Isra'Tliyyat traditions in the Q.,
'Tafsir Isralliyyat' is a phrase used to indicate Muslim commentary by means of Abrahamic
religious scripture and tradition. In this connection Newby has stated that "during the first century,
material from the haggadic and midrashic sources of Judaism and the hagiologic writings of Eastern
Christianity were assiduously collected for commenting on the Qur'an and for constructing histories
of the pre-Islamic world" (1980:685 [Abstract]).

Early tafsTr works rich in Israllyyat, including Islamicate bible citations and paraphrases,
were composed by many Muslim Q. commentators. No comprehensive or detailed history of the
presence (or absence) of Islamicate (pseudo-) biblical citations in tafsfr literatures has yet been
written though Goldziher (1878), Goldfield (1988, etc —>bib.) and others have touched upon it as
will be noted below.
• Early tafsTr works

'Abd Allah b.'Abbas (d. c.68 /687), a paternal first cousin of Muhammad, was known as
al-MaJbr al-'arab (Rabbi of the Arabs). Many Muslims have regarded him as the father of tafsTr
because he is thought to have written the first Islamic tafsTr work (Goldziher,1970:65f; Sezgin
GAS 1:25; Goldfield,1981). Exegetical traditions stemming from Ibn 'Abbas are especially rich in
lexicographical insights and the Islamification of Isra'iliyyat. A knowledgeable companion of the
Prophet, he was an important collector and transmitter of biblical legends stemming from the
Yemeni Jewish convert Kelp al-Abbar (<-1.1, Rippin 1991:166). Many of his associates and
students were important second century mufassiren (Q. commentators) who also transmitted

i The following tradition recorded by DawOdi in his .Tabavt al-mufassifin illustrates this, "A man
asked al-A'mash [2nd century], 'Why do men avoid the tafsTr of al-Mujahid?' He answered, 'Because
they think that he used to ask the people of the Book" (Dawudr, 11:307 cited Ayoub 1:30)

exegetically influential Israniyyat. A number of versions of his (reconstituted) Tafsir entitled
Tanwir al-miqbas min tafsTr Ibn Abbas are in print.' At the very beginning of his Tafsir the
following Judaeo-Christian rooted 1.7adith is cited relative to the first word bism of the first
quranic basmala,

> The "B" (al-ba) is the splendour [beauty] of God (baha' Allah), his delight (bOjat),
> his adversity(bi/a), his grace (baraka) and the commencement of his Name al-barr
> (The Creator) ..." ( Tanwir, 3; Lambden,1986:1ff; Wasserstom, 1995:165-171).

Like other early mufassiran (Q. commentators) Ibn 'Abbas made frequent use of non-
literal, interpretation. Goldfeld has noted that his view that without being allegorized the Q. "might
have no meaning to later generations" (1988:17, 25-27). There seems to have been a close
relationship between the (first Imam) 'Ali" ibn AIN Taub (d. 40/661) and Ibn 'Abbas. The latter is
reported to have said, "What I took from the interpretation of the Quran is from 'AR ibn Abi Tab".
The possibly proto-Shri companion, Ibn Mass 0d, allegedly stated that 'Alf was heir to both "the
outward and the inward" dimensions of the Q. (Dhahabi, al-Tafsir 1:189-90 cited Nasr, ed.
1987:29). Traditions expressive of the Shi'T affirmation of deep, inner senses in the Q. are
especially found in statements of the fourth and sixth Imams, Muhammad al-Baqir (d. c.126/743)
and Ja'far al-Sadiq (d.c.1481765). They allegedly held that

> If the revelation of the Q. only had meaning with regard to the person or group of
> people to whom one or another verse was revealed, then the entire Q. would be
> dead today. Nay, rather! the sacred Book, the Q., is alive. It will never die for its
> verses will be fulfilled among the people of the future just as they have been fulfilled
> among those of the past (lbn 'Amili al-Isfahan', Tafsir mifat al-anwar, 1:5-6;
> Corbin [paraphrase in]1995:90; cf. Lawson, 1993:195f).

In the Tafsir ascribed to him Imam Sadiq has stated that deep senses and mysteries are
enshrined in the Q. His Tafsfr contains a statement to the effect that the Q. consists of 7bara
(expression) and ishara (allusion). The former is essentially the gahir (exterior) and batin
(interiority) aspects of the Q. which are the preserve of the common believer. Its deeper allusive
(ishara) dimension is the inward delight of the khawas,s, the privileged elect (Ja'far al-Sadiq,

1 Dharra,1V:244 No 1186; Smith, 1970:58-91; Ayoub 1984 = 1:27-32 Though there are continuing
doubts as to its authenticity a recent printing is Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-'11miyya,1412/1992.

TafsTr, 123, cf. Nwyia. 'Ishara El 2 IV:114, Exegêse,156ff).

From the earliest times, a non-literal, hermeneutical orientation has been maintained in
ImarnT, Sufi, Isma'TIT, Twelver Shi s T and other tafsfr works. Exegetical authority is vested in the
prophet and the Imams who are believed to have sanctioned non-literal modes of queanic exegesis
(Bar-Asher, 1999:87ff). By means of allegory, typology and other forms of exegesis-eisegesis,
the Q. was held to enshrine levels of meaning appropriate to successive generations. It has batinf
(inner, esoteric) dimensions as well as OW (outer, exoteric) senses. This is the case in those
Shi s i sources in which the mutashablhat (needing interpretation, Q. 3:7) verses of the Q. are given
imamological or esoteric significances (Lawson, 1993; Habil, IS1:24-47; Bar-Asher, Elr. X:116-
Sunni and Shi s i sources regard Mujahid b. Jabr al-Makki (d. c.104/722) as a diligent,
apparently proto-Shi s T Q. commentator and an avid collector of expository pre-Islamic lore. A
rationalist pupil of both Ibn 'Abbas and Imam 'All, he collected Abrahamic and related materials
expository of the Q. (lbn Sa'd, Tabaqat, 5:344, 467). Mujahid is even said to have travelled to
Babel (Babylon) in order to more adequately expound the queanic legend of the fallen angels
Hartit and MarOt. Isralliyyat traditions linked to him are found throughout the tafsTr tradition. They
are registered in the influential Tafsit of Tabari (—>). Probable [Judaeo] -Christian influence
through Mujahid is seen in exegetical traditions pointing to Muhammad being, like the divine Jesus,
"seated" upon the celestial Divine Throne (cf. Ps.110:1; Rev. 3:21).1

The possibly Zaydi (ShrT) commentator Muqatil b. Sulayman al-Khurasani (d. Basra,
150/767) was a very important early transmitter of Isra'Tliyyat. In his historically oriented Tafsir
he gave much attention to the "biblical pre-history" of verses, as Versteegh refers to the Isralliyyat.2
Muqatil cited many exegetical traditions that can be traced back to the ahl al-kitab (people of the
Book). His haggadic type exegesis leaves little unexplained. The name, for example, of the namla

Hanbal, Musnad I:375f; etc.; Rosenthal, tr. Tabart Thigh, 1:75ff; Dhahabi, Siyär A*Iam,

noted SallbT, 199X:10; Rippin, Mudjahid, El'.

(female ant) with which Solomon held converse is given as jarml (Muqatil, TafsTr 111:299 on Q.

That God taught Adam all the "names" is taken by Muqatil to mean those of the (post-)
Edenic animals (ibid, 1:98 on Q. 2:32).The name of                 (MOsa = Moses) is divided into two and
given a Coptic etymological meaning: .1.: ma (= water) +             sa (='tree) (Tafsir 111:337). Rooted in
Judaeo-Christian tradition (Josephus, Antiq. 11.9.6; Philo Vita Mays, 1.4, etc) this exegesis was

repeated and developed by later Muslim commentators including al-Tabari and 1bn 'Arabi.' It is
an etymological exegesis repeated in the Shaykhi writings of Sayyid Kazim and in at least one
Baha'i source (Rashti, Qasida, 9; AB* cited in Ishraq Khavari, QI.IV:1543).

A good example of Muqatil's tafsTr Isralliyyat is the following comment upon a phrase of
the celebrated 'Throne Verse' (Vat al-kursT= Q. 2:255). Without Isnad Muqatil quotes the following
from Wahb b. Munabbih as deriving from the ahl al-kitab:

> "Four angels (arba'at amlak) bear the [divine] Throne [Seat] (kursaevery angel has
> four faces. Their legs are situated beneath the [foundational] Rock (al-sakhra)which
> lies beneath the lowest earth (al-ard al-sufla) extending [for the distance of] a 500
year journey; and between all [of the seven] earth[s] is a 500 year journey!

(1) [There is] an angel (malak) whose face has the appearance of a man
[human form] (ala sarat al-insan)which is the archetype of forms (sayyid al-suwar).
Of God he requests sustenance for the progeny of Adam (al-rizq li'l-adamiyyTn).

(2) [There is] an angel whose face has the appearance of the exemplar of
> cattle ('malak wajhihi ala st7rat sayyld al-an -am)which is the Ox (al-thawr). Of God
he requests sustenance for the cattle [animals] (al-baha'im).

(3) [There is] an angel whose face has the appearance of the exemplar of the
> birds (sayyld al-tayr) which is the Eagle [Vulture] (al-na,sr). Of God he requests
sustenance for the birds (al-fayr)...

(4) [There is] an angel whose face has the appearance of the exemplar of
> beasts of prey (sal-at sayyid al-siba) which is the Lion (al-asad). Of God he
> requests sustenance for the beasts of prey (al-siba). (Muqatil, Tafsir 1:213 on Q.

2:255b cf. V:222)

This exegetical tradition is rooted in a version of the quasi-cosmological Merkabah ('throne-
chariot') vision of the first chapter of Ezekiel which is foundational for later Jewish merkabah
mysticism (cf. Ezek.10). While Ezekiel 1:10 mentions "the four faces of the four creatures which

i TabarT, Tafsfr, 1:280 on Q. 2:51/tr. Cooper, 309; Matiadarat, 130; Fusu,s, 197f / tr. Austin, 254.

he visioned" the Ezekiel Targum understands this to signify four multi-faceted faces (4X16)
equalling 64 faces (tr. Levey, AB13:20; cf. Rev 4:6b-9). That the qur'anic image of the celestial
Throne of God was of central cosmological and mystical importance is evidenced by the 'Throne
verse' (Q. 2:255). This text was given a variety of symbolic and esoteric significances by the twelver
Imams and by numerous Sufi and other exponents of the 'ulom al-ghayb (Islamic esoterica).1

Reputed master of the 'ulain al-ghayb (the esoteric sciences) the sixth Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq
(d.1481765) is believed to have authored an allegorically oriented TafsTr work (al-Sadiq, al-TafsTr,
Habil, 1987 ch.3; Sells, 1996:751). One of his several acrostic interpretations of r°_q(btsm, "In the

name..") of the first basmala in the opening Sarah (al-fat/ha ,Q.1) of the Q., states:

> The bism ("In the name [of ]") is composed of thee letters: the        y ( "b") signifies his
> Eternity (baqa), the "s" ( a/-sin) his Names (asma) and the "m" (al-mTm) his
> Dominion (al-mulk). Thus the faith of the believer is mentioned by him throughout his
> Eternity (b/-baqaM0 while the servitude of the aspirant (al-murTd) is indicated
> through his Names (al-asma) and of the gnostic (al-arit) in his transcendent
> abstraction (fana) from the kingdom by virtue of His Sovereignty over it (TafsTr al-
> Sadiq, 1978:125 cf. TabarT, Tafsir 1:53-55;T. Sadiq, 125; cf. Bihar 2 9:238).

Certain of Ja'far al-Sadiq's interpretations of the Q. interpret prophetological themes
> including Moses' request to see God (Q.7:143, cf. Exodus 33:18-23). The Imam makes Moses a
> prototype of the 'anf (gnostic, 'mystic knower') while the request to see God becomes an interior
> event within the reality of Moses. The negative response to Moses' request, the Ian taranT ("Thou
shalt not see me [God]"), is interpreted as indicating the impossibility of direct beatific vision

> because mystical fana'(annihilation of the "self") precludes "seeing": "How can that which passes
> away (fanin) find a way to that which abides (baqin)?" (trans. Sells, 1996:80). Through non-literal
exegesis the transcendence of God is maintained.

Sufi allegorical-mystical tafsTr is very closely related and at times identical to Shi s i tafsTr.

The relationship between Merkabah mysticism and Islamic thought awaits detailed (Halperin,
> 1988, App. 2). Both the 'arsh (Throne) and the kursi(Seat) are mentioned in the Q. In his mirat a/-an war
> (Mirror of Lights) the ShT'Tte theologian and qur'an exegete Abal-Hasan al 2 AmilT al-IsfahanT (d.Najaf

> who are the bearers [custodians] of the knowledge of God, the locus of which is the 'arsh ("Throne")

view of the Bible (--> ).

The Arabic tafsTr of al-TabarT was early, freely "translated" ( actually recreated) into Persian
prose by a group of 'ulama including An 'All Muhammad Bal'ami (d. c. 387/997). This for
Mansnr b. Nob (d. 365/976), the Samanid ruler of Transoxiana and Khurasan who found the Arabic
difficult. The translation was apparently authorised by a fatwa rooted in Q.14:4 which had it that all
pre-lshmaelite prophets and kings had spoken Persian (Tarjumah-yi tafsit-I TabarT 1:5;
Storey,1 :2). 1 Aside from the quranic text, relatively little of the Arabic tafsTr is directly translated
into Persian. Instead, the translation is interrupted by Persian versions of stories of the prophets and
even legendary tales culled from the Shah-nama epic of FirdawsT (d. 411/1019-1020). Numerous
Isralliyyat in the form of q4sas al-anbiya' stories absent in TabarT's Arabic original are scattered
throughout and central to the reworked Persian Tasfit work of Bal'ami.

In the Persian TabarT Moses' request to see God in Q. 7:143 is literally translated then
commented upon in some detail. The shattering divine theophany is seen as an indirect vision of
God's amr ("Logos") which caused Mount Sinai to be split into six pieces. Three pieces were
translocated to Mecca and three to Medina (Tafsfr [Per.] 2:534-7). Within this Persian Tasir
select Judaeo-Christian and Zoroastrian traditions are registered. This perhaps with the aim of
consolidating recent converts in their Islamic faith and /or inviting 'people of the Book' into the
Islamic fold (Meisami, 1999:35-37).2
• Select Sunni TafsTr works

Bypassing many Arabic and Persian tafsTr works, mention should be made of the still
largely unpublished TafsTr of al-Tha s labT (al-NisaborT, d. 427/ 1035) entitled al-Kashf wa7-bayan

Alp o Hamid al-Ghazali (d.555 /1111) wrote a massive, now lost Q. commentary, Yaqütal-
ta swIl (The Ruby of Spiritual Hermeneutics; so Habil, 1987:320-3) and other works important in the
evolution of Q. Commentary. His famous Mishkat al-anwar (The Niche of Lights) is largely an
interpretation of the 'Light verse' (Q. 24:35) and the 'verse of darkness' (Q. 24:40) along with the
associated hadTth of the seventy thousand veils. It may be gathered from BA*s Haft -VadT (Seven
Valleys c.1858) and other works that from the late 1850s he had some familiarity with Sunni and
Sufi exegetes including al-Ghazali.2

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 606/1209) wrote an important rationalist TafsTr work, variously
entitled Mafatfh al-ghayb.. (Keys of the Unseen) and al-Tafsir al-KabTr (The Extensive
Commentary). It incorporates multi-layered theological and rationalist philosophical speculations on
quranic verses and has been examined by a number of scholars interested in Judaeo-Christian and
biblical matters (e.g IsChr. 4 :249 no. 31.1). Al-Razi's first-hand use of the Bible, especially the
Gospel of John, has been noted. More than a century ago Goldziher gave examples of his citation
of Islamicate biblical texts. These citations include a woe of God / Jesus (allegedly contained in
scirah 17 of the InjTI , Gospel) against such as seek knowledge (71m) but who are unable to
differentiate it from ignorance (al-jahhal). The following statement of Jesus is cited in al-Razi's
TafsTr from Muqatil b. Sulayman (<—):

> 0 Jesus! Magnify the learned (ulama) and be conscious of their distinction for it is
> I [God] who has magnified them above all my creatures, apart, that is, from the
> prophets (al-nabiyyTn) and the sent messengers (al-mursalln). This even as the
> distinction of the sun above the stars, the hereafter (al-akhira) compared to this
> world (al-dunya) and my distinction above everything that exists (Mafatih 1:403ff
> cited Goldziher, 1878:384-5; cf. Margoliouth, ERE 9:482).

Only indirectly in

i  the Egyptian (Bulaq) edition of 1294/1877 (and later editions) has it apparently
been made partially, indirectly available through the condensed version of the &law' traditionist and
commentator Muny1 al-Sunna al-Baghawi (d. 526/1117) entitled Mu'alim al-tanzil ( 'Instruction in the
Revelation'; 4 vol. ed. Beirut:Dar al-Kutub al-'11miyya, 1414/1993).

See further Abdurrahman Habil's chapter 'Tradition Esoteric Commentaries on the Quran' where
important figures of the 'Central Asian School of Najm al-Din Kubra' are mentioned (1987:33).

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi was among those who denied the whole scale textual corruption gahrTO of
the biblical books. For him tahrTf was a hermeneutical misunderstanding, a distortion of ma-anT,
("meaning") not a textual alteration.

Born to the north of Shiraz at Bayda', the polymathic Sunni traditionalist 'Abd-Allah b.'Umar
al-Din al-Badawf (d.c.70011300) produced a well-known condensed though critical reworking of the
influential Q. commentary of the Mu'tazilite exegete and philologist AbO al-Qasim al-ZamaksharT
(d. 538/1144). 1 In this commentary al-Badawi shows an occasional knowledge of biblical data. In
his commentary on the third sora of the Q, for example, he makes use of the Matthean genealogy
of Jesus (Matt. 1:1-17).
• Select ShT'T and Sufi mystical TafsTr works

Among the foundational Shi'T tafsTr works mention should be made of the partially extant
though influential Shri tafsfr works of AbOl-Nazr Muhammad al-Ayyashi (fl-9th-10th. cent. CE)
and the TafsIr al-Qur'an of 'AIT b. Ibrahim al-Qummi (d. 10th cent.). It must suffice here to note that
the latter work, includes comments upon the first set of isolated letters A-L-M 2:1)5
holding that they indicate "a portion of the letters of the ism Allah al-aZarn (The mightiest Name of
God)" (Qummi, TafsTr 1:43). QummT's TafsTr includes many non-literal, imamologically oriented
interpretations. Rippin has noted that Qummi did not simply define "Islam" as "submission" to God
but reckoned it submission to the authority of the Twelver Imams (Enc.Re1.14:241).2

These two abovementioned early (9th-10th cent. CE)                      TafsTr works had some
influence upon the Bab. 3 So too the TafsTr al-AskarT (Bar-Asher, 1999:34), a little studied TafsIr

1 Ab0 al-QasTm al-ZamaksharT's influential and linguistically profound rationalist commentary
was entited al-Kashshaf 'an tfaqa7q (The Disclosure of Realities).

2 QummT's interpretation of A-L-M (Q. 2:1 etc) was repeated in later ShT'T Tafsir works including
the lengthy Persian Tafsfr Sham' of the philosopher-theologian student of Mulla Sadra, 'Abd al-Razzaq
al-LahTjT (d. c.107211662). LähTjT explained these three isolated letters as an acrostic expressing the
phrase ana Allah al-mulk (l am indeed God, the Sovereign)' ( Tafsir Sharif 1:7).

T. Kawthar, 40a; P.Dalall, 48-9 drawing on 'AyyashT / QummT   Tafsir, on Q. 2:1; cf. T.Hamd
69:145.

work attributed to the 11th Imam, 171 asan al-'Askari (d. c.260/873-4). 1 About half way through his
R. Dhahabiyya the Bab utilizes al- s Askari's comments upon a verse of the Sarat al-Baqara (Q. 2)
in connection with the Umnif an ("unletteredness") of Muhammad and his own relinquishing the fitra,
(innate, God-given identity, R. Dhah. 86:84).

Muhammad b. 171 asan al-TOsT (d.460/1067) in his bulky (20 vol.) ShrT al-ribyan ft tafsir al-
Qur'an (The Clarification of Qur'an Commentary) explains the verse "When the Lote-Tree was
covered with that which covered it" (Q. 53:16) as allusion to that which emanates from or covers
the Sidrat al-muntaha (Lote-Tree of the Extremity). He states that "the Sidra (Lote-Tree) was
covered with al-flat* (Light), al-baha (Splendour), al-husn (Beauty) and al-sata' (Purity) so
delightful that there is no end to its depiction" (Tibyan, 9:432).
• The TafsTr works of the Bab

Letter by letter exegesis-eisegesis according to various zahir and batin levels of meaning
was much utilized by the Bab in various of his neo-Tafsir works, e.g. T-Basmala, T- Asr, T-
Kawthar. He had a special interest in the 71m al-hurt-if (the science of letters). Precedent for this
exists in numerous works of Islamic atomistic, qabbalistic exegesis including works of al-Hallaj
(d.304/922), Ibn Sina (Avicenna d.428/1037 ) and various Sufi and 'irfani Shi s T gnostics associated
with the tradition of Ibn 'Arabi, as well as that of the H unifis, Nuqt awTs and Bekhtashis. Something
of an example of this is provided by the following exegesis of the word shajarat "Tree" found in the
Persian al-MISbal) fi al-tasawwuf (The Light of Sufism) of the proto-H urafT (ShafT'T, Sufi) and Shisi
inclined associate of Najm al-Din al-Kubra (d. 617/1220) and (indirectly?) Ibn al-'Arabi
(d.638/1240), the much travelled Sa'd al-Din Hammaya (d. 650/1252):

> Know that [the letter] shin ( J.') of the tree (shajara) alludes to the testimony of
> martyrdom (shahadat). And [the letter] Jim ( E) indicates the paradise of the beauty
> of the Divine Countenance (jannat-I jamal-1 vajh). The letter ra (i) points to the
> greatest Riclvan (Paradise, ridva--1 akbar)wh lie the three dots of the [fetter] shin (0t)

'Towards its beginning the al-'AskarT TafsTr contains an interesting dialogue between Moses
and God partially rooted in this prophet's request to see "his Lord" (Q. 7:143). Without going into details
God instructs Moses to the effect that Muhammad and his (SIM-) family and community, are the most
honoured among the prophets (al-anbiya) and all other creatures (al-AskarT, Tafsir, 15ff).

Returning to a ShET tafsTr work, the Majma al-bayan If-'ularn al-Qur'an (The Compilation
of the Explanation of the Sciences of the Qur'an) of the ShT s T theologian AbO s AIT al-TabarsT (d. c.
548/1153) has been called a Shri "encyclopedia of Quranic sciences" (0.A. Abdul, 1977:78).
Here al-TabarsT presents in Arabic characters a Hebrew transliteration of the biblical etymology of
the tetragrammation (rnrr = Y-H-W-H, Yahweh), rrn$ nttit5 , rrrik; (= 'ehye 'asher 'ehye, Exod.
3:14a, loosely), "I am that I am" (RSV). He considered it one of the forms of the al-ism al-a'gam
(Mightiest Name [of Goa, said in Arabic to be ya iayy ya qayyüm (0 Living One! 0 Self-
Subsisting!) (Tabarsi, Majma' XIX:226). In one of his many alwat) to oriental Jews, BA* reflected
such sources when he used the Arabic transliteration 4...J 2,1              4...J31   for 7171$ liPt5 7171ti

and transliterated the (unvowelled) tetragrammaton o          (= Y-H-W-H) (BA* Ma'idih 4:40; Lambden,

1983:22ff; 1988:66f,155f).

The important ShT s T, esoterically inclined tafsTr works and I.7ikmat al-muta'aliyya
(Transcendent wisdom) formulations of (Mulla) Sadra al-Din ShirazT (d.1050/1640) deserve
mention (Peerwani , 1991-->4.2). His massive irfanT (gnostic) TafsTr al-kabfr (Weighty
Commentary) expresses something of an integration of Avicennan thought, the theosophy of Ibn al-
'ArabT and the inkmat al-Ishraq perspectives of Yahya Suhrawardi. Islamicate biblical citations can
be found in various of his works including his commentary on the Usal al-Katt (-->4.2). This
integration was also furthered by Mull Sadra's student and son-in-law Mulla Muhsin Faycl al-
KashanT (d.1091/1680) whose TafsTr a/-Sail ft tafsir kalam Allah al-waft (The Pristine Tafsir...) was
particularly influential'. So also the Persian and Arabic irfanT commentaries on select sarahs of
the Q. of the philosopher and polymathic pioneer of Judaeo-Christian dialogue Sayyid Ahmed al-
AlawT (d.c.1050/1650). His works have been "considered to be one of the outstanding gnostic,
theosophical commentaries in the Shilte world". 2 Those relating to the bible and dialogue will be

commented upon below (--> 4.2).

Various AkhbarT ('tradition centred') Shi s i commentators utilized and highlighted the
importance of a non-literal hermeneutic (Elr.1:716-18; Lawson, 1993). On occasion they set down
interesting interpretations to Q. rooted Isra'iliyyat materials as found in the traditions ( akhbar).
Only passing mention can be made here to such exegetes. They include 'Abd 'All al-1- .1 uwayzi
(d.1112/1700), author of the Kitab tafsit Mr al-thaqalayn (The Book of the Commentary on the
Light of the Twin Weights) and Sayyid Hashim al-Bahrani (d. c.1110 /1697) who wrote the Kitab
al-burhan ti tafsir al-Qur'an (The Book of the Evidence in the Commentary on the Qur'an).

The Mir'at a/-an war wa mishkat al- asrar fi tafsir al-Qur'an (Mirrors of Lights and Niches of
Mysteries in Commentary upon the Qur'an) of al 2Amili al-Isfahani (d.1138/1726) contains an
extensive prolegomenon highlighting and expounding the deeper hermeneutics of quranic
exegesis. Included in its extensive alphabetical glossary of key Shi s ite terms are expositions of many
biblical-quranic figures including Gabriel, Adam, Abraham, Lot, Gog and Magog (YajOj and Majoj),
Joseph, Israel (Isra'il), Solomon (Sulayman) and Jesus. Corbin described this volume as "one of the
monuments of Iranian theological literature, furnishing inexhaustible material for comparative
research on the hermeneutics of the Book among the "People of the Book" (Corbin. Elr. 1:931-2;
Dharla 20:264f., no. 2893; Lawson, 1993:195f).1

Before concluding this section mention should be made of the huge and widely-respected
early 19th century commentary of the 'Alid Sunni Abu al-Thana', Shihab al-Din al-AlOsi (d.1270
/1854) entitled Rah al-ma'ani fi tafsTr al-qur'an aVagim.. (The Spirit of the Meaning in Commentary
upon the Mighty Quean). 2 A one-time mufti of Baghdad, Alasi was aware of both early Shaykhism
and Babism. Sayyid Kazim Rashti the second Shaykhi leader (—>4.4) appears to have corresponded
with him (Fihrist:323 No. 256; Nicolas, Essai 11:35 no. 100). Though AlOsi condemned Babi heresy

Various Isma'TIT tafsTr works also contain interesting allegorical and other non-literal, sometimes
esoteric modes of exegesis. Such is the case with the fragmentary Mizaj al-tasnim (The Condition of
TasnIm) of Ibn Hibat Allah (d.1760).
2    .    .

Written in the 1200s/ 1800s this work has been published in Egypt in six volumes, Cairo: al-
Matba'at al-AmTrah, 1870; Bulaq 1301-10/1883-92 and also recently reprinted (—>bib.).

at the time of the trial of MuIla 'All BastamT (d. Istanbul, 1846), the Bab invited him to embrace his
religion in an Arabic letter written from Mak° (1848) in which he claimed divinity and to be the
awaited MandT: "I, verily, am God, no God is there except I myself, I manifested myself on the Day
of Resurrection... I am the MandT" (Za1m al-Dawla, Mfflah, 212-15). For a few months in the early
1850s, AlOsT accommodated under house arrest the learned and revolutionary female BabT, Fatima
BaraghanT, better known as Tahira (d.127011852) who may also have had a role in the evolution
of BabT-Baha'T missions to the Jews its emergent bible exegesis (Ayati, Kawakib 1:118;
Mazandarani, ZH 6:703-4). AlOsrs commentary and other writings apparently contain passing
reference to the first two Shaykhi leaders as well as to the Bab and Tahira whom he is said to have
greatly admired (cf. Noghaba'T,1983:137).1

The Rah al-ma'anT is a wide-ranging compendium of pre-19th century Islamic tafsfr
works. While isnad details are registered sparingly select Shi sT and some mystical perspectives
are sometimes recorded. Al-AlOsrs occasionally modernistic commentary shows some knowledge
of the Bible. It exhibits a traditional yet ecumenical viewpoint registering a wide range of opinions
(Smith, 1970:2251-9).

Considerable attention is paid by al-Alas -I to theological aspects of Isralliyyat traditions
related by such persons as have been mentioned above (<-1.1). The story of Moses' request to see
God (Q. 7:143), for example, is discussed at length soh 5:43-52). Attention to detail is evident in
the comments upon the alwah (Tablets) which God gave to Moses on Sinai (al-tar). Expounding
the words, "And We wrote from him [Moses] upon the alwah (Tablets) something of everything (min
kulla shay' ; Q. 7:145a) AiUsT records various opinions as to the number of alwah, their jawhar
(substance), their miqdar( measure, scope) and their katb (inscriber):

> "[Regarding] their number, it is said that there were ten and [also that there were]
> seven or two.., the alwah were [made of] green emerald (zumurrud akhdar). The
> Lord, exalted be He, commanded Gabriel and he brought them from [the Garden of]

11 have not been able to locate these references in either the edition printed in or the CD version
though the Arabic text is cited by Noghabal. This Baha'r writer has AlosT refer to Tahirih as "one in whom
I witnessed grace and perfection the like of which I had not perceived in most men.." (1983:137).
GulpayiganT, Kashf al-Ghita, 95-6; MazandaranT, ZH III:356-9; AB* Tadhkirat, 194/ Memorials, 194-5).

> Eden... Others say that they were [made] of ruby.. And I say that they were of

> Moses were from the Lote-Tree of Paradise (sidr al-jannat) and the length of the
> Tablet(s) was twelve cubits" (Rah al-ma 'anTV:55).

Finally, brief mention should be made of the Egyptian moderniser, reformist and
commentator Muhammad AbdOh (d.1322/1905). He wrote an influential, incomplete Tafsir work
revised and completed by his pupil Rashid Riga (d.1935) and also put out a short-lived periodical
entitled al-Vrwa al-wuthqa' (The Firm Handle) with the Iranian reformer Jamal Asadabadi [al-
Afghani] (d.1897) who had probably spent some time with BA* and the Babis in Baghdad (Cole,
1998, index). AbdOh also wrote a Risala al-tawhrd (Treatise on the Divine Oneness, 1897) and a
work on Christianity and Islam al-Islam wal-Nasraniyya (Cairo, 1902). He aligned himself with those
who rejected the Islamic concept of tahrlf as the total corruption of biblical scripture and had some
acquaintance with the Bible . Abduh gave great weight to rationalism. Like AB* whom he had met
he argued that the existing bible must be authentic because it cannot have been universally
corrupted.
• The Bible, IsraThiyyat and Babi-Bahal TafsTr..

> God revealed the Qur'an according to the likeness of the creation of all things (bi-
> mithl khalq kuN shay).. For every single letter of the Qur'an, as accords with its
> being totally encompassed by the knowledge of God, to the level of its existent
> particles (min dhawat al-ashya), there is a tafsir (interpretation). For every tafsir
> (interpretation) there is a ta'wil (deeper sense). For every ta*RITI there is a batin
> level ('deep inner sense'). For every batin there are also further deep inner senses
> (batin), dimensions to the extent that God wills.. (B* T.Kawthar, fol. 8b).

Babi-Bahal spiritual hermeneutics mostly follow the aforementioned Shri-Sufi-lrfani-
Shaykhi non-literal hermeneutical methods. They accept zahir (outer) and numerous balin(inner)
senses of the Q. as did Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kazim (Sh-Qasida,169-70). As indicated in the
above passage from the Bab, BA* and the Babi-Bahal leaders generally upheld the position that
the sacred word has an infinite number of deep senses, even down to the qabbalistic level of its
letters and beyond. Babi-Bahal primary sources have it that past sacred texts derive their ultimate
meaning in and through the theophanic person and religion of the latest maghar-i &hi (divine
Manifestation'). The existence of gahir (literal) and batin (inner) senses of sacred writ are affirmed

In line with numerous hadTth of the prophet and the Imams and like the Bab, both BA* and
Abd al-Bah' (= AB*) again accord multiple meanings to the sacred books of the past. BA* often
expressed this as the following extract from one of his earlier writings illustrates:

> Know that the words of God (kalimat Allah) and his scriptures (sufara) have inner
> sense upon inner sense (ma'anf ba'du ma'sna allegorical meaning (ta'wil) after
> allegorical meaning (ta'wTI ), cryptic senses (rumOzat) and allusive significances
> (Isharat)as well as evident proofs (data/at). There are, furthermore, clear regulative
> meaning(s) (hukm/hukum)that are without end. No single person is aware of even
> a letter of the inner meanings [of scripture] save such as your Lord, the All-Merciful
> has willed (BA*, Tablet for Jawad TabrizT, INBMC 73:1179-1861173).

BA* as well as 'AB* also wrote many often non-literal commentaries on select sarahs and
/ or verses of the Q. (-->). Like the Bab they frequently utilized an allegorical hermeneutic. The
orientation of these tafsTr works is often eschatological fulfillment and doctrinal renewal through a
new BabT-Baha'T universe of discourse. Though less well-known as a Q. commentator, BA*
expounded a very large number of qur'anic verses, though few complete queanic sOras. Like the
Bab he occasionally gave a detailed atomistic exegesis-eisegesis to particular phrases, words and
letters of the Q. A characteristically Bab-like qabbalistic, letter by letter, 'llm al-hurof exegesis seen
in the Bob's 7: Basmalah and 7: Asr is evident in certain early works of BA* (INBMC 56:24ff).
Among the not yet fully collected and catalogued distinctly tafsTr works of BA* are,
(1)    L. Kull al-ta'am (the Tablet of All Food) on Q. 3:87 @. 1853/4?).
(2)    7: 1:-/urOtat al-muqatta'a (The Isolated Letters [of the Q.] c.1858) also known as T.

ayat al-nor (Commentary on the Light Verse).

(3)    7: Basmala, on the basmalah and its component letters, etc.
(4)    7: YOsuf, on passages, verses and motifs of Q.12 or on the QA of the Bab.
(5)    T. Q. 68:1a including the letters of the basmala, the isolated letter c) (nan) and

verse 1a , "By the Pen!"
(6)    T. Q. 13:17-18a & 18:60-90 contains a detailed exposition of the story of Moses and

Khidr and of Dh01-Qarnayn and Yajaj and majo (Gog and Magog).
(7)    T. SOrat wa7-shams (Q. 91)

Certain of BA's tafsTr statements refine, supplement or develop those of the Bab. There
thus exists in Babi-Baha'i scripture what might be called multiple, progressively expounded texts
of the (Bible-) Q. This cumulative, multi-faceted tafsTr of the Bab and BA* is sometimes also further

interpreted by AB* 1 and less frequently by SE* or members of the Baha'T community. A tafsir
notice of the Bab touching upon quranic qisas al-anbiya: for example, is not infrequently given
further levels of interpretation by BA*, AB* and others. Developed Babi-Baha'T Q. commentary
expresses several dimensions of meaning evolving over a period of more than a century (1844-
1957>). A few examples of this evolving tafsTr are found in connection with the Babi-Bahal
exegesis of the Joseph story and that of DhO'l-Qarnayn. It is often in tafsir contexts that Isra'Tliyyat
traditions are interpreted or reinterpreted beyond their Judaeo-Christian, Abrahamic roots.
• 3. 2 The Bible and Isra'iliyyat in ahadith / akhbar (Compendia of traditions ).

In the first few Islamic centuries tafsTr works and hadith compilations were hardly
differentiated. Ayoub has stated that it was from a very early period that the ahl al-kitab

> .. played an important and controversial role in the development of hadith and tafsir
> tradition. A need was felt from the beginning to know more about the prophets of old
> and their generations than the meagre information which the Qur'an provided"
(1984:30).

Both Sunni and Shil Muslims give tremendous weight to hadith (pl. ahadith), khabar (pl.

akhbar) literatures though relative to the Bible and Isra'iliyyat only select Shri compilations can be
considered here. 2 For the Ithna Ashariyyah (twelver) Shi'is authoritativee prophetic traditions are
supplemented by those deriving from the s Alid Imams, from 'AIT up till 171 asan al 2 Askari and his
allegedly occulted son Muhammad (d. c. 260/874). These Twelver Shi s a give especial weight to
"the four books" three of which are predominantly legalistic. 3 They are supplemented by three other

BA* sometimes asked his son AB* to respond to questions regarding tafsTr. issues. Among AB*'s
tafsfr works is a commentary on the Basmala, on the Sarat al-Ram Q.30:1-5 (The Byzantines
[Romans], probably dating to the late 1880s) and various commentaries on passages within the Bob's QA
relating to the Surat YOsuf (Q.12). AB* wrote various TafsTr letters in Persian, Arabic and Turkish.

2Traditions are valued for doctrinal guidance and for patterns of life-style they set down for
emulation. Though SunnT and ShrT collections of tradition have much in common, as the Bab does not
seem to have specifically cited SunnT hacilth collections and BA* only did this sparingly in his latter years,
the Bible and Isra'Tliyyat in specifically Sunni sources will be bypassed (Goldziher, GS [1971];
Schwartzbaum, 1982:29-38+fns.).

The legalistic books among these four are ( 2) the legal textbook [KIWI Man la yalrnruhu al-
faqTh (The Book for whomsoever is without a lawyer) of Muhammad b. Bobaya al-QummT (= al-Sang,
d. 381/991) (9,000+ traditions) and the two works (3) Tandhib al-aliklm (The Correction of the
Judgements) (3,000+ traditions) and (4) al-IstitIsar.. al-akhbar (The Examination., of the Reports) (5,000+

massive compendia one of which is again distinctively legalistic (Librande, '171adith' Enc. Rel. 6:150-
1). Out of these seven (4+3 supp.) compendia it is the following three large works which include
some material relating to the Bible and Isra'iliyyat:
(1)    [K.] al-Kaft if 7Im al-din ( [The Book of] What is Sufficient for the Knowledge of

> Religion' ) of Aba Ja'far Muhammad b. Ya s ciab al- KulaynT [KulTnr] (d.c. 329/941)
> (15,000+ hadTths);
(2)    The commentary on the Kan" of KulTnT (= KulaynT) by Sadra al-DTn ShTrazT (= Mulla

Sadra d.1050/1640) and
(3)    The al-Waif (The Comprehensive) of Muhsin al-Fayci al-Kashani (d.1090/1679),

a compilation with commentary on the "four books" (<--).

The early and lengthy al-KafT ff 7Im al-din of KulTnT (d.c. 329/941) was written during the
ghaybatal-sughra (lesser occultation) and was specifically cited by both the Bab and BA* 1 as was
certain of its six supplementary volumes, the compendium of miscellanea, entitled the Rawdatal-kaff
(The Garden of the KafT). The eighth volume is of particular interest in that it contains a large
collection of traditions touching upon prophetological, eschatological, imamological and other
matters associated with pre-Islamic prophets. Sections within it record traditions of the Imams
dealing with Adam and the Tree, the story of Cain and Abel as well as Shri sayings of Jesus and
other pre-Islamic prophets. There are also traditions dealing, for example, with the cosmological
secrets of the celestial Domes (hadrth al-qibab), Yajaj and Majaj (Gog and Magog) and much more
besides (Furfi 8:97ff).

Ayoub has translated some traditions reflecting the Shi'T image of Jesus and his sayings in
the Rawdat al-katr (Ayoub,1976). An example of a ShT'T Jesus logion reads, "Verily, I say to you,
Moses commanded you not to swear by God, truthfully or falsely, rather to say, "Yea" or "Nay" (cf.
Exod. 20:7; Matt 5:34; Ayoub, 1976:184). Also recorded in the Rawdat al-kaft is a series of
beatitudes of Jesus (VI11 . 141f, Ayoub 1976:177).

uphold the authority of the twelver Imams or set out various other Shri perspectives. Nine
Isra'iliyyat passages are identified by Vajda, including, [1] Usol al-Kati- 1:383, on the nature of the
flowering rod of Solomon (see Num.17:1ff [16-24]; 1 Sam 16:1ff ), [2] UsOl al-Kaff 11:265, recording
words of Imam 'Ali related by Ja'far al-Sadiq, "Poverty (al-faqr) is a supreme ornament (azyan)
for the believer (mum/n,)' which has midrashic precedent ( B.171agiga 9b, cf. Lev. Rabba, 13, 4), [3]
UsOl al-Kaff 11:270 which records the following prophetic saying relayed by Ja'far al-Sadiq
parallelled at Deut. 27:18-21, "Cursed! Cursed be whomsover is the servant of money (aI-dinar wa7-
dirham). Cursed! Cursed! Be whomsover leads the blind astray! Cursed! Cursed! Be he who
copulates with a beast (behima)" (Vajda, 1981:46f).

Aside from the abovementioned repositories of Shi s i tradition, the encyclopaedic Bihar al-
anwar (Oceans of Lights; 2nd ed.110 vols) of Muhammad Baqir Majlisi (d. 1111/1699-1700) is a
further very influential thematized collection of Shi s T traditions. It is quite frequently cited in BabT-
Bat-GI primary scripture.' In the new 110 volume edition it includes four volumes totalling over 1,
500 (394+ 388+ 407+522) pages making up the K al-nubuwwa (Book of Prophethood; 2nd ed.
vols.11-14). Within it numerous qur'anic verses are expounded, Isralliyyat influenced traditions
cited, and other Islamicate materials related from a wide variety of sources. Much is said about
prophets believed to have lived between Adam until Muhammad. Rich in IsraIliyy5t the K al-
nubuwwa cites, for example, Tabari's Tafsir and a lengthy extract from the K al-kharaV of
Qutb al-Din RawandT (d. Qumm 573/1177-8) which includes several citations of Islamicate
(pseudo-) Johannine paraclete sayings such as the following,

> And he (Jesus) says in another narrative, 'the faraqlq (> Gk Trapciarito the
> Paraclete), the Spirit of Truth soh al-haqq)whom he [God] will send in my [Jesus']
> name shall teach you all things (kulli shay) (Bihar, 15:211; cf. Jn 14:26; 16:13).

1 The Bab and BA* as well as AB* and SE* sometimes challenged the authenticity of Islamic
traditions recorded by MajlisT and others. Citing eschatological proof texts in his (Persian) DalaYI-1 SabA
for example, the Bab directs his (Shaykhr?) questioner to the Bihar though he boldly has it that the
authenticity of such traditions is suspect (tan qiq-I in an gdith ithbat nfst, DSP:51). Going further in a
complex commentary upon the prophetic import of certain isolated letters of the Q., the Bab cites then
disagrees with MajlisT holding that he had failed to grasp the true zahir (outer) import of the qur'anic
isolated letters which he had applied to his own time (Bihar2 52:107; INBMC 98:35ff).

Aside from the Bihar of MajlisT, the Bab and BA* also quote a wide range of traditions from
sometimes obscure ShrT compilations. In his T Kawthar,, for example, the Bab cites lengthy
eschatological traditions including some ascribed to al-Mufaciclal ibn 'Umar Ju s ti ( d. c. 762- 3),
a companion of Ja'far al-Sadiq from whom he is said to have relayed traditions and treatises (T.
Kawthar, fols. 38b-39a; 55a; 57a, etc). These include a work of al-MufacicIal, the K al-tawhid al-
Mufaddal (Dharla IVA82 No. 2156; GAL 1:530 No. 9; T Kawthar, fol.108aff).1

Many examples could be given of the considerable influence of specific hadith upon the
doctrines of the Bab and BA* some of which are Isralliyyat rooted traditions. The adith of the
Cloud (aVama) record's Muhammad's response to a question posed by Abo RazIn al- s AciTIT about
God's location "before he created the creation";

> He [God] was in p Lac' (' ams' , a "cloud") with no air above it [Him] and no air
> below it [Him]. Then he created His Throne upon the [cosmic] Water (cited al-Tabari,
> Tarrkh, 1:36).

Regarded as "especially sound" by al-Tabari this prophetic hadith reflects passages in the
Hebrew Bible where God is said to dwell in "thick darkness" (Heb. 4132 araphel Exod. 20:21b) and
whose theophany was at times in a "pillar of cloud" (Exod. 33:9ff; cf. 1 Kings 8:12; Ps. 97:2; Jud.
13:22). It is also strongly reminiscent of the apophatic theological speculations of the Cappadocian
Father Gregory of Nyssa (d. c. 395 CE) some of whose works were early translated into Arabic. His
On the Life of Moses states that the "divine cloud" which led the lsraelities (Exod. 13:31-2) was
"something beyond human comprehension" (Life of Moses, tr. 38; cf. Philo, Vit. Mos. 1.29.166).

Through the influence of the above Islamic tradition upon his cosmology, Ibn al-'Arabi made
considerable use of the term 'ams' (lit. "blindness", "cloud") and of genitive phrases containing it
(al-Futahat, 1:148; 2:310; 3:430 etc; al-Hakim, al-Mujam, 820f). So likewise the Bab whose QA
makes frequent use of 'ama' and related genitive expressions (100+ times). In this work the Bab
included addresses to a mysterious ahl al-'ama' (denizens of the Divine cloud) associated with the

i There were a number of 19th cent. editions of works ascribed to al-Mufaddal /Imam Ja'far al-
Sadiq. Among them a Persian translation by MajlisT of an Arabic work entitled Taw1.7id-I Mufack/al
(Tehran, 1860 + Najaf 137511955).This Arabic text was also recently printed as Taw1.7rd al-Mufack/a/,

celestial Sinaitic realm (Lambden1984;1988). A commentary on the 'Tradition of 'arna" was
specifically written by the Bab for Sayyid Yakiya DarabT, VahTd (d.1850 CE) (--> bib.). BA* likewise
utilized this terminology extensively. His first major poetical writing was entitled Rashh-I ama'('The
Sprinkling of the Divine Cloud', late 1852) after its opening hemstitch.

While the Bab wrote commentaries upon the gnostically inclined ljadith Kumayl ibn Ziyad
al-Nakha7 (-->bib.) and the tradition sometimes ascribed to Imam 'Ali, nahnu wajh Allah ("We are
the Face of God"; -->bib.), BA* commented upon the widely attested, man 'arafa nafsahu faqad
'arafa rabbubu (Whoso knoweth himself shall surely know his Lord ;--> bib.) and that which has it
that 'The [true] believer is alive in both the [two] worlds (al-darayn)' (MAM:346-361).

At one point in his K Tqan BA* cites a prophetic tradition from Ja'far Sadiq contained in
the Yanba (Wellspring) of Ibn Junayd al-IskafT (? d. 381/991; Ql. IV:1866-7; Kl:189/tr. [SE*] 155).
In the same source he also cites from the massive (100+vols; larger than MajlisT's Bihar) Awalim

of Shaykh 'Abd-Allah b. Nor Allah al-Bah rani [al-IsfahanT] (d. early 18th cent. CE?) an
important pupil of Majlisi (Dharia 15:356-7, No. 2282). 1 This work appears to have been a key
source of messianic proof texts for the early Babis, including Mulla tiusayn Bushrn (d. 1849; see
INBMC 80:1ff). Twice cited as a source of eschatological traditions by BA* in his Kitab-I Nan,
BahranT's Awalim was referred to as among "the well-known and respected books." (BA*, KI:187).2
• The Mashariq anwar al-yaqin of Rajab al-Bursi (d. c. 814/1411).

[Traditions], a common title of compendia of treasured traditions.

> I am the Speaker who conversed (mutakallim) through the tongue of Jesus in the
> cradle...
> I am the one with whom are one thousand volumes of the books of the prophets (alf
> kutub min kitab al-anb)'a).. (BursT, Mashariq, 166ff).

From the very beginning of his messianic career the Bab quite frequently cited and
creatively refashioned lines of the Khutba al-tutunflyya, sometimes as interpreted by Sayyid Kazim
Rashti (-->3.3f). In expressing his own claims he often used "I am " proclamatory sentences and
dual formations echoing the sayings ascribed to 'All - in the tutunflyya and elsewhere (see QA). This
especially in his claim, "I am one presiding over the tutunjayn al-khalijayn ("the two gulfs")
(QA:93:374-5; 109:434-5).

The opening lines of the Bb's early Khutba al-Jidda (Homily from Jeddah) are basically a
rewrite of the opening words of the al-Khutba al-tutunjiyya (INBMC 91:60-61; cf. lbid 50 [untitled]).
Both the Bab and BA* saw themselves as the eschatological theophany of the Sinaitic speaker
(mukallim al-tar) whose future advent is predicted by 'AR in the Sermon of the Gulf (Bursi,
Mashariq, 168; Lambden 1986). The distinctly esoteric influence of this sermon is obvious in the
following lines from the Bab's commentary upon the qur'anic phrase al-lawh al-hafiz. (Q. 85:22),
(The preserved Tablet):

.. God assuredly made this [person the Bab] to be that Book, a supremely
> great Tablet (lawh al-akbar). And he foreordained therein whatsoever was called into
> being at the beginning and at the [eschatological] end (trl-bad' wal-khatm). God

> Beings (ma' al-firat haqak al-aliyyin)[streaming] from the inmates of the two easts
> (min ahl al-mashriqayn) from the two [regions] most proximate [unto God] (min al-
aqrabayn [sic.]). The second of the two [streams] is the water of the fiery [hellish]

> expanse of the saline bitterness (ma' al-mulh al-aPaj [wail ?) [streaming] from the
> inmates of the two wests (min ahl al-maghnbayn), from the two [regions] most

> form is the Threefold Personage [= Jesus?] (haykal al-tathlIth)[which leads] unto the
> depth of the gates of Gehenna (Ii-tarnam abwab al-jahTm).. (B*Q. Hafiz, 80)

Numerous Shri traditions deriving from the Twelver Imams are reckoned to be inspired
(ilham) or divinely inspired (wahy) in the writings of the Bab and BA*. Summing up the developed
Bahl perspective AB* wrote in response to an enquiry about wahy (divine revelation):

> the sanctified pure [twelver] Imams were the dawning-places of ilham (divine
> inspiration). The manifestations of the bounty of the presence of the All-Merciful are
> the rasa' (sent messengers), who are singled out as recipient of wahy.
> Consequently, we do not say that the word (kalam) of the sanctified [twelver] Imams
> is other than inspiration from the All-Merciful (llha-1 rahmanT) (Ma'idih 9:122).

Prophetic and ImamT traditions are thus often cited as authoritative texts in Babi-Bahal primary
sources. This perhaps indicates Akhbari influence which also seems reflected though transcended
in the mystical imam-centred unveiling (kashf) of the first two Shaykhi leaders (3.4). The Bab and
BA* cited as authoritative many Shi s i traditions though their non-literal hermeneutic meant that they
bypassed any notion of Akhbari literalism. Many akhbar are commented upon in considerable detail
and many others are merely allusively drawn upon. Items of Shri hadith set out or inform many
aspects of the hermeneutical orientation as well as the legal-doctrinal Babi-Baha'T universe of
discourse.
II The hadlth qudsT (lit. 'Sacred Hadith', 'Divine Saying')

The hadlth qudsT are an important category of extra-quranic revelations found in canonical
tiadIth collections, in early suhuf collections and in many Sufi writings. They are very highly
regarded in both Sunni and Sta s i Islam. Numerous compilations and commentaries upon these
hadTth were made from early times right up into the Safavid period (1501-1722 CE) and beyond
(Graham, 1977 App. A). Among the influential Shi s i collections is that written in 1056/1645 by al-0 urr
al-sAmili (1104 /1693) entitled al-Jawahiral-saniyyah ftl-ahadith al-qudsiyya (The Essences of the
Splendours in the Sacred Traditions) which sets down from a wide range of Shri sources over one

hundred pages of sacred traditions communicated by God between the time of Adam and that of
Jesus (al-Jawahir, 9-117). Most compilations of hadTth qudsT include directives and statements
which God allegedly communicated to pre-Islamic figures and sometimes also to Muhammad and
the Imams. The hadith qudsT are closely related to and are often distillations of the Isralliyyat or
biblical tradition. Two examples from a SunnT and a ShrT sources are:

> I heard the Apostle of God say, relating from his Lord: "Those who love one another
> in God (mutahabbun fi Allah) shall be upon platforms of light (manabir min nor) in
> the shadow of the [Divine] Throne on a day in which there shall be no shade except
> His [its] shade' (lbn 171 anbal, Musnad V:239; Ibn s ArabT, Mishkat, 22. Graham,
> ... 0 Jesus! Commemorate me within thy Self and I shall commemorate thee in
> Myself. And bring Me to remembrance in the gathering of thy devotees, in the
> meeting of the good among the concourse of the children of Adam (al-adamiyyin)
(al-Hurr al-AmilT, al-Jawahir, 108).

The hadTth qudsT were very influential upon the Bab and BA*. In his early K al-rüh (Book
of the Spirit, 1261/1845?) and K. al-Fihrist (1261/ 1845) the Bab explicitly cites as a sacred
utterance of God (al-hadTth al-qudsT) the famous Sufi tradition known as the hadTth al-nawafil
(hadIth of supererogatory works) (K al-rüh 64-5). In this hadfth the servant is represented as
so assiduously engaging in devotions (al-nawafil) and drawing nigh unto God that God himself
loves that servant to the degree that he becomes the "ear wherewith he hears", etc. (Fihrist, 343,
cf. Nasr, IS1:108-9).

With respect to BA* and hadTth qudsT it is clear that his Kalimat-I maknünfh (Hidden Words)
is essentially a collection of Sufi-type, pre-BabT divine wisdom. Over 150 brief Arabic and Persian
divine sayings consist of utterances largely cast in the literary form evident in many key hadith qudsT
commencing ya ibn al-Insan CO son of Man" ) at root a Semitic-Aramaic phrase (cf. Jesus' 'Son
of Man' sayings) which introduces numerous Islamic hadTth qudsT. Initially from around 1858 CE
entitled the sahifa-yi Fätimiyya (The Scroll of Fatima) then a decade or so later coming to be
entitled the 'Hidden Words' by BA* himself, this compilation is basically modelled upon collections
of the hadIth qudsT so cherished and much cited by Sufis. Occasionally echoing Gospel sayings
the Hidden Words are introduced by BA* as a distillation of pre-BabT divine inspiration:
This is that which was sent down [from God, nuzzila) from the omnipotent realm

Chapter Four
THE BIBLE AND ISRA'ILIYYAT PT. 2:
SIRA/TARiKH (HISTORICAL) AND QIBAS AL-ANBIYA' (STORIES
OF THE PROPHETS) IN ISLAMIC AND BABLBAHA'l PRIMARY SOURCES

II 4.1 The Bible and Isra7liyyat in STra -TarIkh, historical works.

> Historical, or pseudo-historical, material centering around biblical events and
> personalities gained the right of entry into Islam through the Qur'an and its
> interpretation.., the biblical tradition occupies a special place in the history of
> Muslim historiography. It provides Muslim historical writing with some of its most
> significant elements (Rosenthal, 1962:40,43).

From the earliest Islamic centuries folkloristic and (quasi-) historical writing informed
by Isralliyyat were important factors in the emergence of Islamic piety and historiography. A
need was felt to place the piecemeal quranic salvation history in a wider, more structured
historical context. The meagre qlsas al-anbiya' elements in the Q. were expounded,
contextualized and supplemented. For apologetic purposes the advent of the prophet
Muhammad had to be shaped on biblical lines and be seen to fulfill Abrahamic religious
expectations. The conviction that Muhammad delivered the Q. at the apex of a predestined
chain of prophets had to be inspiringly set forth (Rubin,1995).

Early Islamic historical writing was fuelled by Arab genealogical, poetic and other
interests. It was also a result of the Muslim interaction and dialogue with Jewish, Zoroastrian
Christian and other converts (the ahl al-dhimma, Dud, 1984; Humphreys, 1989; Khalidi, 1994).
Hagiographically oriented biography writing and associated literary activities were indulged in
by converts from the Abrahamic religions traditions. They contributed significantly to emergent
Muslim historiography. (Sezgen, GALS, 247ff; Donner, 1998, App. 297ff).

Among the earliest, now lost examples of Islamic history writing are a number of works
detailing the lives of pre-Islamic prophet figures. In various ways they were seen as
typologically anticipating and predicting the advent of Muhammad and Islam. Attributed to Ka'b
al-Abbar (<-1.1), for example, are an early Book of Adam and Eve, a Wafat Masa (Passing
of Moses) and a STrat al-lskandar (Life of Alexander). Wahb b. Munabbih and others produced
similar works (<-1.1; Donner, 1998:299-306 [ App.]) Early sagas about the 0 imyari kings

mixed with tales of pre-Islamic biblical and other figures including Abraham, Noah, Luqman son
of 'Ad, Khidr, and BilqTs (the Queen of Sheba) are apparent in Wahb's K Al-mulük wag-akhbar
al-marlin (Wahb, K Dian, 1347/1928) as extant in the recension of Ibn HTsham (d. 213/828)
entitled K al-TTjan fT mulük tiimyar (The Book of the Crowned Kings of 171 imyar). Norris has
referred to this work as a "rich mine of Arabian fable, legend and garbled chronicles" in which
can be seen "the influence of Rabbinical, Syriac and Persian lore in both poetry and prose"
(CHAL 1:385).

Inspired by the person and times of Muhammad, STra (Biographical) literature quickly
became popular from the 2nd century AH (Sezgin 1:275-302; Donner 1998:297-306). It was
influenced by Judaeo-Christian motifs and pre-Islamic prophetological materials. The impact
of Isra'Tliyyat traditions is evident as are Islamicate apologetic and hagiographical concerns
(Rubin,1995). Wahb b. Munabbih wrote one of the earliest, largely lost Sira compilations.
Kister has stated that his work "contains an unusual amount of miraculous stories as attested
by the fragments of the papyri" (CHAL 1:357). These early biographies drew heavily and
creatively on biblical legends and motifs and registered Islamized qiSas al-anbiya' traditions
which eventually formed bodies of Islamic literature in their own right (-->3.2).

The well-known sTrat al-nabT (Biography of the Prophet [Muhammad]) of Ibn Ishaq
(d. 150/767) as redacted in the epitome of Ibn Hisham (d.828/233?) 1 contains many points of
interest (Montgomery Watt 1962:23-34) including an attempt to show how Muhammad was
predicted in the Bible by means of a very early (pre-151/767) citation rooted in Jn. 15:23-16:11.
Muhammad is the expected prophet as "the Munal. 71.7emana ("Comforter")' which in Syriac is
Muhammad.. in Greek BaraqITtis (Paraclete)" ( Ibn Ishaq tr. 03-4; Griffith, 1992 [I] 138-141)
Probably originally known as al-Mubtacla' (The Beginning) the first part of this STra of Ibn
Istiaq has recently been reconstructed by Newby (1989) from citations found in al-Tabari and

i The Egyptian philologist Ibn Hisharn was, as noted, not only responsible for one of the surviving
recensions of the Sira of Ibn Ishaq but also the K A/-Than [[mu/uk tiimyar which derives from Wahb

others. It contained 'Stories of the Prophets' ranging from the first couple (Adam and Eve) till
the supposed martyr [St.] Geoge Megalomayrtos (d. early 5th Cent. CE) pictured as a prophet
of destruction sent to a disbelieving people (1989:231-241).1

The earliest extant tarrkh (Annalistic History), is the work of the chronicler, genealogist
and hadTth specialist KhalTfah Ibn Khayyat al-' Usfuri (d. 241/855). He saw tarikh (history)
as something ever before humankind from the time of "the fall of Adam from paradise" up to
his own day around the middle of the 9th cent. CE. For him the pivot of pre-Islamic (biblical)
and later history was the hijra (flight) of the Prophet (622 CE) which served as the fulcrum for
his annalistic TarTkh (al 2 UsufT, Tatikh, 23-25; Zakkar, 'Ibn Khayyat al-'1.1sfurr El 2 I11:838; cf.
Rosenthal, 1968:71-2). Other Muslim historians set out pre-Islamic history dealing with the
creation, biblical history, prophetology, Persian history and more besides.

The early biographical compilation of Ibn Sa'd (d. Baghdad, 230/845) entitled K a/-
tabaqat al-kabTr (Great book of the Classes) includes a biography of the Prophet with an
almost fifty page account of the pre-Islamic era (Tabaqat 1:5-54). Like other early Sira works
that of Ibn Sa'd opens with genealogical data relating to Adam then traced through Abraham,
Ishmael and others from whom Muhammad was believed to have descended. The biblically
rooted genealogical notices were supplemented by those configured according to Iranian,
Zoroastrian and ShT'T expectations aspects of which lie behind later Safavid and BabT-Bahal
genealogical notices and charts. The Bab as the MandT was linked to the family of the
Muhammad (via Fatima and the Twelver Imams) and BA* with Zoroaster and Yezdigird III as
well as Abraham's third wife Keturah.

An important historical manual and survey of world history by Alp o Muhammad Ibn
Qutayba (276/889) entitled Kitab al-ma'anf (The Book of Knowledge) "enjoyed tremendous
popularity" (Rosenthal, Elr. VIII:47). Like Ibn Qurayba's TalvIl mukhtalif al-O&M and Vyün

Cited by later Muslim writers including Ibn IshAq the earlier possibly historical sage and antiquary
'Abrci [s Ubayd] b. Sharya al-JurhumT, (fl. 2nd cent. AH) is said to have had his quasi-historical narrations
about ancient Arab, Persian and biblical history recorded at the order of the 'Umayyad Caliph al-Mu'awiya
(Rosenthal, El 2 III:937; Sezgin, Geschichte1:260; Abbott, Studies I:9ff).

al-akhbar it contains accurate bible quotations from the Torah as well as the Gospels.
Passages cited include verses from several chapters of Genesis (1:2-8;9-13, 14-19, 20-23, 26-
31, etc) and many from the Gospel of Matthew (Matt.1:17-21; 2:22-3, etc) (Lecomte,1958;
Vajda, 1935; Lazarus-Yafeh 1992:79f; Adang 1996:30-36).

The K al-akhbaral-zywal (Book of the Long Narratives) of Ab0 HanTfa al-DTnawarT (d.

c. 281/894) is the oldest extant (Arabic) history written from a Persian point of view. Rosenthal,
at the outset of his coverage of 'World Histories', aptly describes this work as 'a synchronized
presentation of Biblical, Persian and pre-Islamic Arab history, followed by an early Islamic
history.." (1968:133). Its opening section, 'From Adam until the Islamic conquests (al-futiihat
al-islamiyya)' has nine subdivisions the first three of which are entitled 'The rulers of the earth
(mulük a/-arc/) from Adam until the reign of Darius' (7-27); 'Narratives of the Reign of Darius
and Alexander' (28-39) and 'Narratives of the Kings of Yemen and the commissioning of Jesus'
(40-46). Brief notices are included about many pre-Islamic prophets and Persian figures
including Adam, Noah, Abraham, David, Solomon, 'Aristotle and Alexander', ‘Gog and
Magog', Zoroaster and Jesus (DinawarT, al-akhbar 7ff; Bosworth, Elr. 1:715-6; Pellet, Elr.
VII:417).

II Two Imami      shn   historians, al-Yas q0bT (d.c. 292/905) and al-Mas s OcIT (d. 345/956)

The Shi s ite historian al-Ya s q0bi has recently been called the "first historian of world
culture in Islam" (Khalidi,1994:2). In presenting a "culturally and intellectually oriented tableau
of pre-Islamic nations" (Humphreys, s Ta i rTkh' El 2 X:272) he drew on the Bible and other non-
Islamic sources not holding to any theory of the wholescale tahrif (corruption) of the biblical
text. The first volume of Ya s q0bT's two volume Ta'rikh (Chronicle) deals with the pre-Islamic
era devoting over seventy pages to the period from the first couple till the time of Jesus
(Tarikh 1:5-80). In addition to the Bible, Ya s q0bT was influenced by various extra-lpiblical
sources such as the originally Syriac (+ Arabic) apocryphal and sometimes genealogical
Me'drath Gazzé (Book of the Cave of Treasures, 4th cent CE?). This to some degree

bolstered Ya . q013T's Shn interest in issues of wa,siyya (successorship).1

Ya'q a 13T evidently had a considerable regard for the integrity of biblical scripture. He
taught that king Zerubbabel rescued the Hebrew bible from a well into which Nebuchadnezzar
had cast it and considered the NT a trustworthy source (Adang, 1996:226-7). For him the
Gospels have it that after travelling to Jerusalem, Jesus communicated to his disciples a
distinctly messianic, Paraclete promise:

> The hour has come at which the Son of Man (1bn al-bashar = Jesus) must
> withdraw unto his Father ... [then] there will come unto you the Paraclete (al-
> faradITt)who will be with you as a prophet (nabT)... " (Ta'rTkh 1: 72)
> A one time student of al-Tabari (-->) in Baghdad, the amazingly prolific al-Mas s °di did
not wholly share his teachers' negative views regarding pre-Islamic scripture. He was much
travelled and had frequent dialogue with Jews, Zoroastrians, Christians and the Sabeans of
Harran. Most probably a Shil Muslim like Ya'qObT he authored several highly influential
historical works replete with detailed accounts of pre-Islamic history and rich by Isra'fliyyat
traditions (Shbou11979 Ch.IV). Notable in this respect are his two digests of larger works, the
Murej al-dhahab wa ma'adin al-jawhar (Meadows of Gold and Mines of Jewels) and the K
al-TanbTh wa7-ishraf (The Book of Indication and the General View) which are "both part of a
series of seven works in which al-Mas'OdT combined history, geography, astronomy,
ethnography and religion" (Adang, 1993:46; Shboul, 1979:68ff).

The abovementioned works of al-Mas'odi both draw heavily on biblical history and
several times give an account of the fate of the Torah, a book which al-Mas'OdT claimed to have
directly consulted (Muraj 1:45, Praries1:32 Adang 1996:124). Shboul thought that al-Mas s CAT
was familiar with several Arabic translations of the Torah and aware of the Greek, Septuagint
(LXX) version as well as the existence of the targumic tradition (Shboul, 1979:288). He certainly
had an impressive knowledge of Christianity though he held back from giving NT citations. As
he saw the matter, neither the Q. nor the Prophet had explicitly confirmed the 9ospel

narratives (Shboul, 1979:290f; Adang, 1996: 44-48, 122-126; Pulcini, 1998:32-35).
II The TarIkh of al-TabarT and its Persian recreation by Bal'amT (d. c. 387/997) .

The massive Ta irIkh al-rusül wa7-mulak (The history of prophets and kings) of the
famous Q. commentator al-Tabari (d. 310/ 923)(<- 2.1) is universally recognised as an
extremely important Arabic historical source. Drawing on numerous earlier sources it covers
Israelite and Persian pre-Islamic history in considerable detail (800+ Arabic pages).' Though
a certain amount of biblical data informs this seminal work, Tabari "ostensibly relied on the
traditional Muslim material" (Rosenthal, 1962:42). In both his Tarikh and his TafsTr Tabari
was of the opinion that Jewish leaders willfully distorted the Hebrew Bible (trans. Cooper,
1987, 403ff, Adang, 1993:2983,107; Pilcini, 1998:29-32). His and similar negative
perspectives regarding the Bible were specifically challenged in two early works of BA*.

al-Tabari's Arabic history was early freely translated into new Persian (c. 963 CE) by
AbO All Muhammad, Bal'ami for the Samanid ruler MansOr b. NO (d. 365/976). More a
transformation of the Arabic than a translation, it amplifies, reworks and sometimes 'corrects'
TabarT's original text at times in line with Samanid legitimacy and the incorporation of Judaeo-
Christian material (Meisami, 1999:23ff). The Persian Tabari is best viewed as an independent
literary entity (Daniel, 1990). Following the Persian preface in the introductory section, Jewish,
Christian and Muslim traditions about the age of the world are registered ( Tarikh [Per.]).

The Persian TabarT expands, alters and to some extent Persianizes aspects of the
Arabic legend of the Ashab al-kahf (Companions of the Cave). In line with Islamic tradition al-
TabarT held that the sleepers entered and left the "cave" at the time of Jesus (al-Tabari,
Tarikh, trans. Perlman, IV: 156-7). The Bal'amT version holds that this happened after the time
of DhOl-Qarnayn (= Alexander the Great) though prior to that of Ardishir [I] b. Babak, the
founder of the Sassanian dynasty (?-242 CE; see Tabari, Tarrkh (Per.) 1:179-80; cf. trans.
Zotenburg, 11:39-40).

It is exactly 811 pages in the Ar. Leiden edition (Brill, 14 vol. + index, 1879-1901). The English
translation of this portion fills vols.1-4 of the Yarshater (ed) translation (—> bib.).

The aforementioned Shi'l historian al-Maqdisi (f1.10th cent. CE ) authored his wide-
ranging K al-bad' wa'l-tarikh (<-1.2) for a Samanid prince around 355/966. Basically a
universal history it incorporates much pre-Islamic data in its twenty-six sections (in the
published edition). Subjects covered include God and the creation, prophecy, Adam, the
prophets (II:74-132+111:1ff), the Persian kings and the end of the world (Morony, Elr. 111:352).
The Tarrkh-1 Maqdisi is a richly detailed book widely read in eastern Islamic countries. It
includes important information about Iranian religion and history and cites copiously from
Jewish, Christian and other sources (Maqdisi, K. al-Bad'; Goitein, 1968:142-3; Morony, 'al-
Bad' wal-Tarikh' Elr. IV:352).

Bypassing the Persian general history entitled Mujmal al-tavarrkh wa'l-q4sas
(Compendium of Histories and the Prophets; written around 520/1126) which sums up historical
data from many previous Persian and Arabic sources and the historical works of the
jurisconsult, historian and Hanbali preacher of Baghdad Abu'l-Faraj Ibn al-Jawzi (d.597/1200)
it will be important to mention the Jewish convert to Islam and physician to certain Mongol
Sultans, Rashid al-Din FacII-Allah (d. 718/1318). He composed an extensive Arabic and
Persian Jamr al-tawarikh (Assembling of Histories) which is a wide ranging general history
of the world from "the earliest beginnings" (Storey, 1/II:72ff). Schwartzbaum refers to it as a
"turning point in Islamic presentation of Biblical history and Biblical heroes". Its author was
"reared in Jewish Orthodox tradition, and nurtured upon the vast Talmudic-Midrashic-Aggadah".
His history has a detailed section dealing with the history of the "Children of Israel" (BanCi Isra'TI)
and covering both the Biblical and post-Biblical periods. He was "the first Islamic historian who
draws on the Hebrew text of the Bible, being well-versed in the Hebrew language"
(Schwartzbaum 1982: 42-3, fn. 98,141).
Several important histories written during the Ilkhanid (Mongol) period (1256-1335 CE)

commence with Adam and the pre-Islamic prophets' cannot be summarized here though the
contribution of 'Izz al-Din Ibn al-AthTr (630/1233) should be noted. This writer viewed history
as the "unfolding of God's purposes" for humankind (Richards, Elr. VII:671-2) and authored an
important universal history entitled al-Kamil IT'/-tarrkh (The Complete History) ending at
628/1231. Much indebted to Tabari, Rosenthal has pointed out that the pre-Islamic portion of
this "well balanced" history "deals with the creation of the world, Biblical history (which is
synchronized with that of the Persians), and the stories of Christians, saints, and pre-Islamic
Arabs." (Rosenthal1968: 146).

The Syrian, s Ayyobid prince, historian and geographer 'small b. sAIT AlotTI-Ficia' (d.732/
1331) has been well-known in the west as a result of the 17th century publication and Latin
translation of his Universal history, the Mukhtasar tarrkh al-bashar (An Abridgement of the
History of Humankind [until 729/1329]). 2 Mainly based on Ibn al-Athir's history (<--), the
sections on pre-Islamic history cover the period from Adam until Muhammad. Cole has argued
on the basis of paraphrastic citations in the L-1:iikma , that BA* was familiar with this work (Cole
1979)..

The rather negative attitude towards Isralliyyat evident in the writings of the
conservative historian and exegete Ibn KathIr (d. 774/1373) has already been noted (<-1.1).
Nonetheless, his TafsTral-qur'an al-azim and weighty al-Bidaya wal mhaya (The Beginning
and the Culmination [of History]) contain numerous examples of Isra'Tliyyat traditions.'

The farsighted Muslim historian Ibn Khalclan (d. 808 /1406) pioneered the philosophy
and sociology of history and is well-known for his rejection of trenchant views of biblical tahrif

I Note the Zubdat al-tavarrkh (Quintessence of Histories) by Ab0 al -Qasim al-KashanT (early
14 th century CE?) and the Tarikh-1 Guzidah (composed 1330) of Hamd-Allah MustawfT QazvInT
(d.c.744/1334).

The several eighteenth century editions include that of J. Gagnier, Die vita.... Mohamrnedis,
(Oxford, 1723). The complete Arabic text was apparently first published in 2 vols. In Istanbul in
1286/1869-70 (Gibb, 'Abu'l-Fida' El 2 1:118-9).

In its recent 7 (14) volume printing over 450 pages are allotted to biblical and other figures of
the pre-Islamic era (lbn Kathir, al-Bidayavol.1 [1-2])

the ;like of which was advocated by Ibn ITIazm (d. 456/1064). In his Kitab at- ibar (Book of
Admonitions) Ibn KhaldOn upholds the genuineness of the Bible in the light of the implications
of Q. 5:43[7] ("..they have the Tawrat which contains the decree of God (hukm Allah).." and
in view of a tradition handed down from Ibn 'Abbas to the effect that a religious community is
unable to wholly, materially corrupt their sacred book (Fische1,1958; Rosenthal, 'Ibn KhaldOn).
For Ibn KhaldOn scriptural tahrff indicates the inability of religionists to understand the
meaning of their sacred book. In his Muqaddima (Prolegomenon to his abovementioned multi-
volume work) Ibn KhaldOn wrote much that indicates his polymathic learning including the
following defence of the alleged tahrIf of the Torah

> .. the statement concerning the alteration (of the Torah by the Jews) is
> unacceptable to thorough scholars and cannot be understood in its plain
> meaning, since custom prevents people who have a (revealed) religion from
> dealing with their divine scriptures in such a manner. This was mentioned by
> al-Bukhari in the Salph.. Custom, in the proper meaning of the word, would
> prevent anything of the sort from happening to other peoples.. (Muqaddima,
> trans. Rosenthal 1:20-21).

According to Rosenthal the 13th century saw a "steady flow of Arabic and Persian
universal histories" (Rosenthal 1968:148). Despite their sometimes considerable use of

Isralliyyat they cannot be mentioned here. Notable, however, among the pre-Safavid
chronicles is the Rawdat ahsafa if sTrat al-anbiya' wa7-mulük wa7-khulafa' (Garden of Purity
respecting the Lives of the Prophets, the Kings and the Caliphs; 7+1 vols.) of the late TTmOrid
writer Muhammad b. Khwandshah b. Mahmod, Mirkhwand l (d. 903/1498). This lengthy work
has a long opening section 'On the beginning of creation, the stories of the Prophets (q4sas-1
payambaran), the circumstances of the Iranian kings and of the sages of old (hukama-y/
pishin)'(ed. 'Abbas Zaryab,1:15-198). 2 It cites around forty Arabic and Persian histories and
exists in numerous often confused manuscripts. Apparently lacking an autograph mss. (?)

i The Radwat was supplemented and extended in Qajar times by Rida' Quli Khan Hidayat (d.
1288/1871) as the Rawdat al-safa-yi Nasirr.

variant texts are represented by several 19th century lithograph editions (Bombay, 1845, 1848;
Tehran, 1853-56; Lucknow, 1874;1883) some having been translated into Turkish, Latin and
other European languages.'

Mirkhwand's grandson the Persian historian Ghiyath al-DTn, Khwandamir (d.c. 941/
1534-5) summed up and supplemented his grandfather's Rawdat al-safa' in his Khulasat al-
akhbar (905/1499). 2 He also authored another more extensive, multi-volume general history
covering the period from the creation until just after the death of the Safavid Shah Ismail (d.
930/1524 CE). This latter work is entitled TarTkh habit, al-siyar f T akhbar afrad bashar (The
Beloved of Histories regarding the traditions of the most singular of mortals; 930/1524). In an
independent manner it draws on sources additional to the Rawdat for the pre-Islamic era and
other periods. 3 (Storey, I:101ff; Beveridge & deBrujin,EI 2 V:1020-1022; Quinn, 1996 :3-5).

Numerous Safavid historical chronicles, including the partially published Takmilat al-
akhbar of Zayn al- s Abidrn 'All AbdT Beg ShirazT (d. 988/1580) and the late Safavid Tatikh-1
sultanT composed in 1115/1703 during the reign of Sultan Husayn by Husayn b. Murtada
Husayn AstarabadT (d. ??), contain large amounts of pre-Islamic history and qijsas al-anbiya'
materials (cf.Storey 1/1:134). More recent among histories is the Persian general history
entitled Nasikh al-tawarikh (Supplanter of Histories, around 14 vols.) of Muhammad Taqi
KashanT, Sipihr (= 'Celetial Sphere'; d. 1297/1880). Completed in the early 1850s 4 this
extensive work contains much about pre-Islamic prophets, sages and nations, spanning (in
the Tehran [Arnir KabTr 1958-?] edition) almost 1,000 large and dense pages (vol.1 has 600+

The Rehatsek 1891-2 partial translation of the first volume of the Rawdat al-safa is an English
rendering of the Bombay Lithograph printing of 1271/1854. It includes passages not found in the recent
(1375 Sh./ 1996) Zaryab edition printed in Tehran.

KhwandamTr also completed his grandfather's Rawdat al-safg 'writing a seventh volume and a
conclusion.

In the 1333/1954 edition of KhwandarnTr edited by Huma'r (4 vols.) in excess of 25'0 pages
are devoted to pre-Islamic history.

4 There have been many 19th century printings of the Nasikh including Tehran 1860; 1888-9;
early 1890s; Bombay, 1892, etc. (Storey. 1:152f, 1247; Minorsky, .Sipihr El 2 IX:658).

pages and vol. 2 has 338 pp.).

The Nasikh al-tawarTkh is a very wide ranging work. There are, for example, sections
on America (cf. 1:27) and ancient Chinese figures (I:475f). It claims to have drawn on a huge
array of over two hundred (listed) Arabic, Persian, European and other historical sources
including a good many works dealing with pre-Islamic religion, scripture and Isralliyyat-q/jsas
al-anbiya' such as the TarTkh-I tawrat va infil (The history [historical potions] of the Torah
and the Gospels'), Tabarrs TarTkh, a aSas al-anbiya' work[s] (of Tha s labT?), a 'History of
(TarTkh-I) Wahb b. Munabbih (!), the (abovementioned) Rawdat al-sata' , MajlisT's Hayat al-
qulab , a work entitled Kama/-I ahadith-I qudsiyyah-yi al-I isra'TI (The Perfection of the
sacred traditions of the family of Israel) and the book of Dinn-Qamayn ascribed to MTrza Fadl
Allah, a Tarikh-1 banT Isra71 (History of the children of Israel) as well, among numerous other
miscellaneous titles such as the MTzan al-haqq (presumably of that of Pfander) (Nasikh al-
tawarTkh[195? ed.] 1:29-32).

Throughout the Nasikh there are very precise though idiosyncratic chronological
datings "after the Fall [of Adam]" (hubat-I Adam; loosely anno mundi) for hundreds of pre-
Islamic figures and events. Siphir has it, for example, that Jesus was born 5, 595 years after
the fall (see 11:1) while ManT son of (the Parthian prince) Qatan (sic. Patrik; founder of the
Manichean movement) is described as "among the non-Arab sages" ( az

Nasikh al-tawankh was very probably known to Sabi-Bah a

- l leaders and writers; in part
because their updated supplements contain inaccurate and critical accounts of Babi
beginnings.'

In conclusion to this section it might be pointed out that neither the Bab nor BA* were
historians in any modern sense nor did they themselves write histories. As far as I am aware,

> I Mants dates were actually 216-274[77'1 CE.

In an unpublished letter of AB* to Lotfullah HakTm the Nasikh al-tawarikh is strongly criticized.

the Bb and BA* did not explicitly quote from any of the previously mentioned histories. It
appears though that they were influenced by several of them. BA* may have known MasOdT's
KTanbil. 7(<-- or a related source?) and the history of Ab0 al-Fic15' (<--) as well perhaps as the
Nasikh al-tawänkh. While the Bab to some extent refashioned Islamic chronology BA* at times
followed Islamicate chronologies in such works as his Law/i-1 lykmat. The founders of the
135bT and Bahn religions occasionally set down episodes of past sacred history. In this they
mostly drew upon qi;sas al-anbiyâ' materials in ways that communicated lessons for
prospective converts and / or devotees. Their often neo-lslamic religious communications
make quite frequent references to past prophets and messengers and aspects of their troubled
history.

In his L. Qabl-I adam (Tablet on the pre-Adamic era--> bib.), BA* responded to a
question about the apparent non-existence of historical records of pre-Adamic prophets and
kings. In reply he pointed out that such an era existed as do records relating to it though they
appear undecipherable, lost or destroyed on account of changes to humankind and the earthly
terrain. Diverse estimates of human history he continues, have been made. Some reckon an
8,000 year pre-history, others a12,000 year era (= Zoroastrians), not to mention such details
as are given in the (Hindu) Mab-I 4,..> yaka, ("Book of the Ages" = Skt. yaga ). 1 After

mentioning such details BA* directs his questioner, 'Abd al-Razz5q, to disregard such
conflicting details and focus instead upon the sublime panorama of his revelation (mangar al-
akbar) (BA* IQ:77).

In this Persian L. Qabl-I Adam BA* also appears to show direct (or indirect - via al-
Ya'qUIDT?) familiarity with an Isralliyy5t tradition relating to Abraham and the origins of the

'There is little doubt that the Arabic, 4,..- jük transliterates the Sanskrit yuga (="ages[s]) and

is indicative of a period of time relative to the four ages (Skt. yugas) of the world expressed in divine years
though representing many thousands of human years (see the great Hindu epic Mahabharafa and the
Mana-Samhita, "Lawbook of Manu" where these yugas are set out). The transliteration of BA* is that
which al-BiranT used in his Tal.icifq 11l-hind ("The Reality that is India", 3rd ed. Beirut:'Alam al-kutub,
1403/1983), 279 (trans. Sachau, 1910:367).

Hebrew language (-->), perhaps as it is registered in the aforementioned K Tanbi1.7 of al-
Mas s OcIT (<-):

> Henceforth he [Abraham] spoke that [language] which is called Hebrew librani)
> because it originated at the time of the crossing ('ubar): it is derived from the
> word 'Mr.. (KTanbIh, 1965:79, tr. Adang 1996:126 cf. Gen 14:13).

In his the Tablet about the Pre-Islamic Era' 1 BA* reflects this tradition when he states that
Abraham spoke Hebrew (Ar. 7branT) at the (Per.) hin—I 'ubar az nahr-I urdon, "the very
moment of the crossing of ( 'ubür az) the river Jordan" ( IQ:75; cf. GWB*115/173). He thus
derives lbranT (Hebrew) from 'ubar ("crossing"). Though there are minor differences in
Mas s OdT's and BA's statements, it seems clear that BA* is restating this popular Jewish-
Islamic etymology. It is also found, for example, in the Tarikh al-Tabari (<--) in detailing
aspects of the life of Abraham. The following version of this etymological tradition is related
from Ibn 'Abbas:

> When Abraham fled from Kotha and came out of the fire, his language was
> Syriac, but when he crossed the Euphrates from 171 arran, God changed his
> language and it was called Hebrew ('lbranT) because he had crossed ('abara)
> the Euphrates. Nimrod sent men to look for him, telling them, "If you find anyone
> who speaks Syriac, do not leave him, but bring him to me."They met Abraham,
> but left him because he spoke Hebrew and they did not understand his
> language. (Al-TabarT, Tarikh: 347, tr. Brinner, History 11:128).

This popular etymology registered by al-Mas'alT, al-TabarT, BA* and others, has no
explicit basis in either the Hebrew Bible or the Q. In Gen 14:13, however, Abraham is referred
to as "Abram the Hebrew". An ancient, popular etymological understanding of , -pv (siva,
"Hebrew") here relates the word "Hebrew" to the verbal root TY!) ('-b-r = 'to pass, cross' =

Ar. cognate              abara=' to cross, traverse') or to the preposition 111 (= "across",

"beyond"). This is evident in the Gk (LXX., 3rd cent. BCE?) rendering of the Hebrew (MT) where

This Tablet was in reply to a question of a certain 'Abd al-Razzaq and was partially translated
by SE* in Gleanings (No.LXXXVII). BA* was asked about the existence of extant records (dhikr-I anbiya'
qabl az Adam abO bashar va salati-1 ..) of pre-Adamic prophets and kings (text in IQ:68-78).

"Abram the v•pi.! (ibrT = "Hebrew)" is interpretively rendered Appap.   TCA?   trEpoitilc, "Abram, the
perates, one from across../ the region beyond / the wanderer". What exactly is meant by the
"across" or the region beyond is not clear. It could indicate beyond the Jordan or the
Euphrates (cf. Gen 50:10; Num 21:13, Josh. 24:2).

Almost a century ago the above etymology was registered in the (1st edition) of the
Jewish Encyclopaedia (1907; JE VI:304-5). Today, however, the etymology of ,1;D. ribri)
has become something very complex, a linguistic puzzle having little or nothing to do with
words indicating "to cross". Abraham's family "beyond the river" were not in fact Hebrew but
Aramean (Gen 25:10). "Hebrew", ,1;11 livrT) remains of unknown, uncertain derivation
though it is often thought to indicate ethnicity or be indicative of a period of marginalised
"slavery" (cf. Exod. 21:2) as may be hinted at by the (pre-biblical, 2nd mill. BCE) cuneiform word
Hab/piru/ Habiru (= 'Apiru).

To conclude this section with a brief note relating to concrete history. It was in the late
1880s that BA* commissioned his amanuensis MTrza Aga Jan, Khadim-Allah (d.1901) and
subsequently Nan ZarandT (d.1892) to write detailed Babi-Bahal histories. Though BA*
himself never set out to accomplish this historical task, his numerous writings do contain
interpretations of historically oriented qi:sa,sal-anbiya' episodes (-->4.2) and hagiographically
oriented historical materials. Additionally, there are numerous historically informed Arabic and
Persian Ziyarat-nama ("Visiting tablets"), commemorative texts largely written for significant
believers of the early years of the Babi-Bahal era. These very extensive writings remain
unassembled and largely unstudied.

It was 'Abd al-Baha' and his successor Shoghi Effendi who consciously wrote
theologically informed sacred history as well as numerous historically and hagiographically
oriented texts and epistles. The best known examples are the originally anonymous Magala-yi
shakhsi sayyah (Travellers Narrative, 1st ed. Bombay, 1875) of AB*, and the centennial
surveys of BabT-Bahal history, the Persian Law/i-1 qam (Centennial Tablet) and English God

Passes By of SE* (1st ed. 1944 CE).

NI 4.2 The Bible and Isrs'iliyySt in aisas al-'anbiya' and in Islamic and Babi-Bahan
primary sources.

Pre-Islamic accounts of the lives of prophet figures exist in the biblical books of Job
and Jonah as well as in Ben Sirah (44-49[50]) and the Pseudo-Pauline book of Hebrews (ch.
11:1ff) as well as in numerous extra-biblical sources. Examples are found within works
representative of the Jewish/Judaeo-Christian Elijah and Daniel cycles as well as in the
originally Jewish (1st.cent BCE/CE?) (Pseudo-Epiphanius =) Vitae Prophetarum which
contains core sketches of 23 Israelite prophets (OTP 2:385ff; Charlesworth,1981:175f). Many
pseudepigraphical works also present legendary accounts of the lives of primordial, patriarchal
and later figures including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaiah and Daniel (Charlesworth Bib.; OTP.,
2 vols.). Legends and motifs contained in these sources contributed to the ouranic and post-
qur'anic qi;sas al-anbiys' compilations (Wasserstrom, in Reeves ed. 1994, 87-114).

II Qurs anic prophetology and qi;sas al-anbiya' .

> It would be difficult to imagine the Qur'an with all references to the Bible and
> biblical characters and events removed... The biblical stories in the Qur'an are
> not as in the Bible simply, neither those of the Torah nor those from the
> Gospel. Both categories reflect later developments by Jews and Christians alike
> (Bowman, 1972:111).

Qisas al-anbiya' (Stories of the prophets) legends are centrally important
crystallizations of quranic salvation history. As Khalidi puts it, "the historical sections [of the
Q.] .. are largely devoted to the histories of the prophets, Biblical and non-biblical" (1994:68).
Aspects of the lives of the traditional 'twenty-eight' prophets and others besides are registered
in the Q. While one Meccan sOra is named al-anbiya' (the Prophets, Q. 21 cf. Q.78 al-nabs',
'The Announcement') nine other saras are named after specific prophets. Q. sOra titles often
derive from key terms associated with qi;sas a/-anbiya'episodes e.g. baqara, Cow (= Q. 2);
naml, Ant (= Q. 27); tar ( = Mount [Sinai] Q. 52). The lengthy scira of Joseph is pictured as the

atisan al-qasas (Q.12:3a) "the most marvellous of narratives". Such stories are partly
typologically indicative of the veracity of the lifestyle and mission of Muhammad. They
foreshadow aspects of Islamic piety. Islamic sources often picture see pre-Islamic prophets as
proto-Muslims proclaiming Islamicate truths. According to a few NT texts the mighty deeds and
words of Moses foreshadowed the mission of Jesus (Jn. 5:46, etc). In similar fashion the Q.
represents Moses and other prophets as major antitypes of Muhammad. Object lessons are
enshrined in qur'anic qiSas al-anbiya' stories. They tend to point to that piety which results in
faith and good works.
II Post-quranic qsas al-anbiyä ' works.'

C11Sas al-anbiya' gradually came to indicate a literary genre (<-1.1) inclusive of
materials and texts incorporating biblical citations and Isralliyyat traditions. Qlsas al-anbiya'
works were to some extent compilations of materials utilized in Islamic moralistic preaching
ultimately expressed in various of the Islamic languages, including Arabic, Persian and
Turkish. They became important repositories of prophetological legend and myth. They placed
prophets and others in a salvation, meta-historical context. Events surrounding biblical and
qur'anic prophet figures were interpreted and contextualized. Scriptural lacunae were
variously filled. Linguistic, geographical and other obscurities were piously clarified. Moral
object lessons were underlined and miraculous deeds glorified to the possibly greater faith of
the believers. Difficult contradictions were smoothed away in qisasal-anbiya works. So too the
faults and limitations of God's chosen ones. Figures of little or no importance in the Bible or the
Q. were sometimes given a key role in Islamic salvation history. Numerous prophets
unmentioned in the Q. are given detailed coverage in qisas al-anbiya' literatures; including,
for example, Balaam b. Beor, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Jeremiah, the Astlab al-Kaf
(Companions of the Cave) and St. George.

Some have thought qi;sas al-anbiya' and Isra'Tliyyat virtually synonymous terms (Nagel, 1967)
As a literary genre though ql;sas akanbiya' is probably best understood as a sub-category or development
from Isra'Tiyyat.

It was preeminently Yemenite Jewish converts to Islam of the Umayyad and 'Abbasid
periods who sifted and arranged epics, cycles and legendry chronicles (<--1.1). Their work
became foundational for later Muslim storytellers, geographers, historians and others. Pre-
Islamic Arabian lore, legend, and epic tales were merged with Jewish-Rabbinical, Christian-
Syrian, Zoroastrian-Persian and other legendary streams of tradition (Norris, CHAL. ch .19).
This often in illustration and clarification of quranic rooted materials such as mentions of Bilqis,
the traditional "Queen of Sheba" (1 Kings 10:1-13; ll Chron. 9:1-12; Q. 27:15-44), the post-
deluge king Nimrod (Gen. 10:8; Ar. NamrOd ), the non-biblical sage Luqman and the immortal
'Green One' al-Khadir (<--1f). Important in this respect is Wahb b. Munabbih's aforementioned
(<-1.2) record of the Himyari kings, BilqTs the Queen of Sheba and others in Ibn Hisham's
recension of his Kitab al-TOn If mulak Himyar (The Book of the Crowned Kings of Himyar
[Markez al-Darãsat: San s a', 1347/1928]).

As early as the 2nd century AH Egypt had several historians who utilized and
incorporated all manner of biblical and post-biblical materials into their works (Donner,
1998:224-5). Some idea of this can be gleaned from the text and citations incorporated into the
Futah Misr (Conquest of Egypt. ed. Torrey, 1922) of Ibn 'Abd al-H akam (d. 257/871). This
lengthy work incorporates legendary and biblically informed narratives about the association
of prophet figures with Egypt, including Abraham's entrance therein and Joseph's association
therewith (Futah Misr, 10-19).

Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889) in his K al-ma'arif considered Mubtada al-khalq wa-qi;sas al-
anbiya (The Beginning of Creation and the Stories of the Prophets) literature "the first branch

> (fann) of the branches of knowledge" (cited Pauliny,1999 [151:313). Perhaps the earliest

of Islamic literature (<-2.1ff).
III Ab0 Rifa s a 'Umara b. WathTma (d. 289/902). 1

An important early compilation of the tales of pre-Islamic prophets is the (largely extant)
Kitab al-baor al-khalq wa qi;sas al-anblya' of the early historian 'Umara b. WathTma b. MOsa
al-FarisT al-FasawT (GALSup.1:217; Khoury, 1978). Aside from creation legends and traditions
this work contains instructive and entertaining versions of stories of the prophets. Sometimes
unique details are given such as the supernatural power of Aaron's garment (Schwarzbaum
1981:62). God is said to have revealed the following address to Jesus son of Mary:

> 0 Son of the Virgin (aVadhra), the Virgin Mary (al-batal)! I brought you forth
> and I begot you [through] your mother. So take hold of the Book! with power and
> expound it for the people in Syriac (al-suiyaniyya).
Having related this Wahb b. Munabbih explained that,

> Syriac is the first of the languages spoken by humanity. The people [on] the
> Day of Resurrection (yawn al-q)'ama) shall be taken to account through it. But
> when they enter Paradise (al-jannat) they shall converse in Arabic...

(Khoury1978 [Arabic]130).
• The Qisas al-anbiya' of al-Kisa'T (d. 3rd-5th/9th-12th cent CE?).

The full identity and exact dating of the al-Kisa'T who authored an important qsas al-
anbiya' work is uncertain. 2 Thackston reckoned that it "must have been written not long before
1200" (1978:xix; xxxi n.29). More recently Brinner (1998) has left the matter open (EAL2:453).

Commencing with a notice about the primordial Tablet (lawffland the Pen (qalam), the
creation of the primordial "Water" upon which the divine Throne rests as well as an account of
the creation of the earth and heaven, the Q4sas of Kisa'T contains much prophetological
material that is of interest. The stories of Joseph and Job, for example, are narrated at length

1The aforementioned Muhammad b. 'Abd-Allah Sahl al-TustarT (d. 283/986 <-2.1), it is relevant
to note here, most probably authored a Sufi oriented (*as al-anbiya' text, entitled K Lataif al-q1Sas if
*as al-anbiya' (13Owering, 1980:16-17; Habil, in Nasr, ed. 1987:30-31; Rippin, ERe1.14:241).

2 In line with the 17th cent. CE bibliographer 171 ajjT Khalifah some have identified him with the
Qur'an reader 'Ali b. Hamza al-Kisn'T (d. c.189 /805) (Schussman, 1981 followed by Milstein et al.,1999).
Others, including Brockelmann (El III:1037) and Nagel (1961) consider this al-Kisal to have been
Muhammad b. 'Abdullah al-Kisa1 (10th cent. CE?; cf. Thackston, 1978:xxxiii, n.29). An early version of
al-KisaTs qsas was published by Eisenberg under the title (Lat.) Vita Prophetarum .. (2 vols.1922-3—
>bib.). This text has been translated into English by Thackston (Jr. 1978).

as is that of the Queen of Sheba and of Jesus son of Mary. Included is an account of the child
Jesus' first day at school when he explains the significance of the letters of the Hebrew
alphabet. This story of the wise child Jesus is widely replicated in variant Islamicate forms and
is partly rooted in a Christian apocryphal tale of Jesus and his teacher Zacchaeus (cf. Lk.
19:12;the 3rd--> 6th cent. CE? Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Ch.6). An Islamicized form of it was
applied to the all-knowing ShrT Imam al-Baqir and to an episode in the childhood of the Bab
(Lambden, [19841987).
• The C24sas al-anbiya' of al-ThalabT (d. 427 /1036).

The Qur'an commentator and historian AbO Is1-.1aq Abmad b. Muhammad al-NTsabOri,
al-Shafi s r, widely known as al-Tha s labi (d. 427 /1036), wrote a massive, still unpublished
TafsTr work very rich in Isralliyyat and related qi;sas al-anbiya traditions. He may have written
his more influential Arg 'is al-majalis qisas al-anbiya' (The Brides of the Sessions, Tales of the
Prophets) to serve the needs of the early quesas, the Muslim preachers. Partly chronologically
organized after the biblical scheme, it may have emerged from the mystically oriented circle
surrounding Junayd of Baghdad (d.297/910) (Thackston 1978:xvi; Nagel 1961:80-102). This
*as al-anbiya' work has been taken to indicate that by the 5th/11th century the literary genre
qisaa al-anbiya' had "reached maturity, both in content and in style" in the Arab speaking
Islamic world (Milstein, et. al. 1999:8). More so than the popularist work of al-Kisal, al-
Thalabts Qisas "utilizes the techniques of traditional Muslim scholarship" (Brinner. EAL2:766).

Many prophet figures, worthies and demoniac entities are commented upon by al-
Thas labT. In addition to the usual twenty-eight prophets, for example, he includes sections
dealing with the biblical figures Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel and has a ten page section
on Jirjis (St. George). In the Arais Tha s labi not only records the recently focussed upon story

> of BulOqiyya ascribed to 'Abd Allah ibn Salami, (<-1.2; Da11ey1994 239-269; Wasserstrom
1995:178-80) and the legend of KhicIr but records an interesting tradition about a receptacle
> containing portraits of a succession of pre-islamic prophets from Adam until Muhammad.
Referred to as the eandak al-shahada (Chest of Witnessing) it centres upon Adam as the first

calligrapher, Daniel as the originator of portraiture and portrays Alexander the Great as an
artist. This tradition was later registered and developed in diverse ways including, for example,
in the Rawdat al-safa of MTrkhwand (<-3.1; Roxburgh, 2001:183ff).

Tha s labi's Arais contains much that is supplementary to 'tales of the prophets'. The
beginning of creation as well as the eschatological era of the Mandi are both touched upon.
In the latter connection ThalabT includes a brief section entitled 'The descent of Jesus from
heaven a second time., at the end of the age'. Towards the end of this work Tha'labT mentions
Mary Magdalene, an "Israelite from one of the villages of Antioch", a pious but unceasing
menstruate cured by God through Jesus. A week after his ascension Jesus descended from
heaven and Mary Magdalene (maryam al-majdalaniyya) had a luminous experience of him
upon a mountain. After this she summoned the disciples (1.7awanyan) to evangelize the world
(Qisas, 401-2). It may have been the influence of this passage which directly or indirectly
induced BA* to beam with joy at the mention of Mary Magdalene and AB* to frequently delight
in picturing her as the first perso n to voice post-resurrection Christianity (Diary, Juliet
Thompson, cited WO (Fa11,1971), 65, TAB 2:467; 3:601 SWAB:105,123, etc).

The two QiSas al-anbiya' works of Kisal and Thalabi were widely copied and read
for entertainment purposes. Many others wrote similar works including, for example, the early
C:21;sals al-anbiya' work ascribed to Abu 'Abd-Allah b. Mutarrif al-KinanT and another by TarafT
of Cordoba (d. 453 /1062) (Nagel, 1961:103-119; Thackston, 1978; xvi+ xxxi fn.22).
II Shi'ite qsas al-anbiya' works

Only a few of the major Arabic Shisite qiSas al-anbiya' works can be mentioned here
before a few examples of those written in Persian. In volume 17 of the Dharra, fifteen or so
Arabic and Persian Q4sas al-anbiya' texts are listed (Dharra, XVII esp. Nos 560-576). There
are of course very many other ShT'T works which include stories of prophets and related
hagiographical legends. Shaykh 'AIT ( a son of Shaykh Atimad al-Atisal,—> 5.1), for example,
wrote a treatise entitled Risala ft qissat Masa wa7-Khicir (Dharra XVII, No. 531, 98). As will be
seen, his erudite father often responded to questions on qi;sas al-anbiya' and related subjects.

III Qutb al-Din al-RawandT (d. Qumm 573/1177).

The ShrTte legist Ab0 al-171 usayn Qutb al-Din Sa s id b. Hibat-Allah al-RawandT (d.

Qumm 573/1177) wrote a [K.] asas al-anbiya' al-Rawandiyya (GALS 1:624; Dharla 17 No.
574, 105; Pampas, 1970:176; Kohlberg1992:166). 1 Like other ShT'T qlsas al-anbiya' works it
contains details of Israelite prophets and associated matters in treating of the era between
Adam and Muhammad. Following a section about 'The prophethood of Jeremiah (Irmiya) and
Daniel (Danyal)' there are sections about various celestial signs, a twelve month solar eclipse
(khusaf al-shams) and a year long lunar eclipse (khusef al-qamar) (Rawandi, a;sas 222f).
There then follows a section about (St) George (Jitjfs), Ezra (*Wald, Ezekiel (1.-iizkil)and Elias
(//iya)(ibid, 238ff) supplemented by another about 'Isaiah (sha'aya), the 'Companions of the
Trench (ashab al-ukhOd) (Q. 89:4), Elijah (Ilyas), and Elisha (Ilyasa 7 as well, for example,
as legends relating to Jonah (yanus) and the Companions of the Cave and their dog' (ashab
al-kahf wal-raqim) (ibid, 238-244).

A section in the RawandT Qisas 'On the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad, both
miraculous and otherwise' includes Islamicate prophecies rooted in pre-Islamic holy books
(Qisas, 271-315). Here, for example, it is noted that in his Kamal al-Din Ibn BabOya records
that the injil contains the words "I, verily am God, no God is there except Me, the Eternal, the
Everlasting' (cf. Jn 1:1-2?) which is somehow unceasingly confirmatory of the al-nabr al-ummi,
the foreign or unlettered prophet Muhammad -- whose nature is spelled out in highly majestic
terms in this alleged NT prophecy. Jesus is also said to have asked God, 'Oh! my Lord. What
is Tuba?: He is told that it is a celestial Tree in paradise planted by God which provides shade
for the righteous (al-akhyar). Its foundation in [the Paradise of] al-Riclwan and its water derived
from the [celestial pool of nectar named] al-TasnTm (cf. Q. 83:27f). Jesus is also told that the
al-nab! al-ummT, Muhammad and his community, are to be the first of those to partake of these
paradisiarchal wonders (RawandT, QiSas, 282-3).                                                i

'This al-RawandT should not be confused with AbO al-Rida Fadl Allah al-RawandT (d. ?) who also
authored a (245as al-anblya' work (see Dhatia 17, No. 569,104)

closely related Persian disas al-anbiya' texts. In the later ms. tradition they show some
overlapping and conflation (Milstein et.al . 1999:11).
• Ibn Khalaf of NaysabarT [NishapOrT ] (5th cent./11th cent).

One of the oldest Persian works detailing the prophetic tales is that of IbrahTm Ibn
Khalaf of NaysabcirT [NTshapOrT ] (5th cent./11th cent. ed. Yaghma'T, 1961; Storey 1/1 no. 197,
159-60; Milstein et, al. 1999:10-11). Interesting, sometimes unique details about prophet figures
are found within this work. Moses and Khidr seem to be identified with Yasa s (Elisha) and
Ilyas (Elias). Both are pictured as immortals who had quaffed the water of eternal life ( ab-I
zindagi). It is stated that they will remain engaged in their supervisionary, angelic tasks over
land and sea until the Day of Resurrection (qsa,s, 338). The section of this work giving account
of Mary and Jesus' birth, life and ascension is quite lengthy (NaysabOrT, Qisas: 364-389).
Chronological details are occasionally given. It is related that some hold that when Jesus was
one month old Mary took him to the land of Egypt (cf. Matt. 2:131) where he stayed for three
years (ibid, 3669-70). When Jesus was considerably older Mary took him to an instructor
(muallimi)who came to ask the child Jesus to say abjad. This he largely explained as follows,
the (letter) "A" (alit) signifies His (God's) 71/a' (= the Divine Blessings), the "B" His Baqa
("Eternity") and the "J" His Jalal ("Grandeur") (ibid, 371; the letter "D" is not explained). The
teacher is astonished. This account stands among the important Islamicate versions of the story
of Jesus' first day at school existing in several languages (Arabic, Persian, etc). Such stories
have been influential in filling out hagiographical accounts of the early schooling of all-knowing,
divinely inspired children including certain twelver Imams and the Bab himself (Lambden,
[1983]1987).
• Muhammad Juwayri [--= Itluwayzi] (10th cent. CE??)

Possibly even earlier than the aforementioned work is the Persian Qisats al-anbiya' wa
siyar al-mulak of Muhammad Juwayri [= ITI uwayzi?] which may have been reworked (2) by
the Sufi, Abo Muhammad Jurayri. It contains some archaic elements such as the name ljnOb
rather than IdrTs for Enoch though it is most likely later than the alleged 352/963 ( Dharra 17,

No. 576, 105; Thackston, 1978:xxxi; Milstein et, al. 1999:12-13). It was lithographed at least
four times in 19th century Iran and India (Bombay) though after the lifetime of the Bab (d. 1850
CE).1

Erroneously considered a translation of the Arabic qsas al-anblya' of al-Kisa'T by
Storey, Thackston and others (1978:xix,xxxiii n. 30), a probably 7th/13th cent. aSasaVanblya'
work, was composed in Persian by the little known Muhammad b. al-Itlasan al-DaydozamT. In
at least one mss. this CliSas goes under the title, Nafa'is aVara'is wa qisas al-anbiya' (Gems
of the Brides and Stories of the Prophets; Milstein 1999:12-13). According to Milstein this author
stated that he "wrote a composition in the Persian language on the creation and the basic
tenets of Muslim theology that would serve as a tool against the [Shri?] heresy" (idem, 13).
Here again lengthy sometimes novel chapters are devoted to the various prophets.2
I 'Abd-Allah al-171usaynT (d. c.1243/1826)

Among the early Qajar Shn          C2/.58.5 works   is that of 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad Ricla'

[al-Shubbar] al-171usaynT (d.c.1243/1826) entitled QI:sas al-anbiya"ala ra'y al-Imamlyya
(Dharra 17 No. 566, 103; GALS 11:580). 3 This very large work on Shri biblical legends is for
the most part made up of traditions of the twelver Imams. The author derives much of his
material from MajlisT's Bitlaral-anwar (<-2.2) (Nagel, 1967:119-121). It was studied by Walther
Aichele in a pioneering 1915 article about biblical legends in this work of al-171usayni (--> bib).

Numerous tafsTr, tiadIth, history and other Islamic literatures contain q4sas al-anbiya'
legends and motifs in various languages including Persian, Arabic, Turkish. They add very

Thackston, 1978:xxxii.

to Haqq al-yaqin (<--11).

significantly to the wealth of Islamic qi;sas al-anbiya' sources. 1 This is partially illustrated in the
previous sections (2.1-3). Arabic and Persianate Sufi influenced poetry is especially rich in this
respect. Numerous qisas and prophetological elements are contained within the poetry of Farid
al-Din 'Attar (d.618/1221), Ibn al-Farid of Cairo (d. 632/1235), Jalal al-Din RürnT (d. 672/1273;
Renard, 1994), 'Abd al-Rah man J5rnT (d. 898/1492) and others some of whom have been cited
or alluded to by BA* (-->).

An example of a work rich in Shilte qi;sas al-anbiya' traditions is MajlisT's massive
Persian I jayat al-qulüb (The Life of Hearts). Accounts of the prophets from Adam to
Muhammad fill well in excess of one thousand pages (vols. 1&2 of 5 vols. --> bib). Here the
influence of Isra'iliyyat / qisas al-anbiya traditions is widespread. One can read on the authority
of the twelver Imam Rida% for example, that Noah, hopeful of protection and salvation when in
the Ark, was moved (on God's advice) to utter 1,000 repetitions of the shahada, (Ar. la /7äha
& Allah = there is no God but God ). This he did in Syriac, loosely transliterated in Majlisi as
,.,i51 l.,,..12 L11111 it3J.LA (= pi Hallelujah x 1000 [?], 0 Lord (marya), Save!?). Noah ultimately

wrote a version of the Arabic shahada on his finger for memorization purposes (MajlisT,
ljayat,1:246). Later in the Ilayat al-qulab there is a lengthy Persianized, Islamified translation
of the beatitudes and various other woes and sayings of Jesus (171 ayat„ 2:1160-1175). As
noted these sayings are sometimes reminiscent of the Persian Hidden Words of BA* (2.2f).

In concluding this overview of Islamic 'stories of the prophets' it should be noted that
they continued to be written in many parts of the Muslim world. According to Thackston Turkish
qi;sats al-anbiya' works did not exist "before the fourteenth century either in Central Asia or in
Anatolia" (1978:xxxii). Important in this respect though is the central Asian, East Turkish qsas
al-anbiya' of al-RabghOzT (710/1310), a rewritten compendium of earlier q/Sas works including
that of Tha s labT (<--). It covers the period from the creation to the martyrdom of H usayn b. 'AIT

It should not be forgotten that Persian Jewry also produced significant prose and poetical texts
in Judaeo-Persian about biblical prophet figures.

in Karbala (61 /680 CE), 1 from the creation of an Adam who was cognisant of all the names
(Q. 2:31f) in all languages including "Arabic, Persian and Turkish" until the time of Muhammad
and beyond (al-RabghOzT, 2:14f). The early section of this CVOS relating to Adam and other
early figures is, like al-Damn-1's Hayat al-Hayawan (The Life of the Animals), rich in animal
lore (Somogyi, 1937:263ff). It has also been observed that nearly one fifth of al-RabghOzT
Q ,s is devoted to Joseph and his relationship to Zulaykha, its latter part focussing upon the
relationship between Muhammad and Khadija (Dankoff, 1997:118).
• C2i;sats al-anblya' materials in BabT-Bahal sources

While, as far as I am aware, neither the Bab nor BA* name or explicitly cite Islamic
asas al-anbiya' works it is obvious that they were much influenced by prophetological stories
and motifs contained within these sources and within such closely related bodies of literature
as Persianate Sufi poetry. Only a few examples of qi;sas al-anbiya' influences upon them can
be detailed here.

In the Persian Dala'il-I sab717 of the Bab there is an apologetic defence of his being
one imprisoned yet still the awaited messianic Qa'im. The Bab finds it necessarily to cite
prophetological and associated precedents for this. He thus refers to Joseph among the
nabryyrn (prophets) as one imprisoned (masjan) (in Egypt) and to the circumstance of the
imprisoned seventh twelver Imam, MOs b. Ja'far (al-Sadiq) (d.183/799) among the wasiyyin
(legatees). According to the Shra the latter was arrested, imprisoned and poisoned by the
'Abbasids. In this connection a second pair of exemplars is also named by the Bab from among
the nablyyün and the wasiyyOn. They are the ultra pious prophet Zakariyya (father of Yanya,
John the Baptist) who in ShT'T and other qijsas works is pictured as a martyr prophet. He is said
to have met a very grizzly end by being sliced up inside a tree. 2 Then also the Sayyid al-

A Turkish mss. of RabghOzT's qsats was reproduced 1948 by the Danish Turkologist Kaare
Gronbech. In 1995 the edition and translation of Boeschoten and Vandamme was published cf.
Malov, "Legendes musulmanes"; Thackston, 1978: xxxii; Dankoff, 1997.

2Majlisi, Bihar2 14:161ff; TabarT, TarTkh (Per.) [Zotenberg] 1:569-79; Sidersky, 1933:139-40;
Milstein, 1999:154-5).

Shuhada' (Prince of Martyrs), Irrlarrl Husayn who suffered a tragic martyrdom near Karbala in
61/680 (P.Dala11:16-17).

In P.Bayan 7:15 (p. 262) obscure reference is made to a khayyät (tailor) in an early
religious theophany (zuhür). This could be a reference to the first man, Adam or more likely
to Idris (Enoch). The Bab states that with every "theophanic era" (zuhar) all previous
theophanies (zuharat) are evident. In his own era Adam/Enoch the khayyat was marvellously
apparent (jawhar migardad). The motif of Adam having been a tailor (khayyatf), could reflect
the Muslim appropriation of Rabbinic traditions surrounding Gen. (2:25), 3:7 and 3:21
(Lambden, 1992; Ricks, 2000). Informed by these verses and related Rabbinic exegetical
traditions al-Tabari states in his Tarikh, that it was with the wool of a slaughtered lamb that,
like a good Muslim, Adam "made a coat for himself, and a shift and veil for Eve" (TarTkh, 123/tr.
Rosenthal, 294).

A tradition originating with Ibn 'Abbas as cited in the Qi.sas al-anbiya' of Kisa'T details
the trades or worldly occupations of nineteen prophets who lived between the times of Adam
and Jesus. Here it is stated here that "Adam was a cultivator, Enoch [Idris] a tailor (khayyat)
and Noah a carpenter" (Kisa'T,II: 61/ tr. Thackston, 67). The identification of IdrTs (= IkhnOkh,
= Enoch) with the work of tailoring is common in Islamic qi;sas al-anbiya' works. Tha s labi refers
to Idas as "the first to write with the pen and the first among such as tailor garments (khatt al-
thiyab) and sew with the needle (labasal-mukhyat)(Qisas, 49). The wide-ranging didactic work
Lata'it" al-ma'arif (The Subtleties of Knowledge) of AbO MansOr al-Thalabi (d.429/1038)
contains some interesting passages about the pre-Islamic originators of things. Of IdrTs (Enoch)
it is stated, ".. He was the first to use writing and to sew garments, whereas previously people
had only skins and hides [cf. Gen 3:21] (Bosworth, 1968:39).

The section on Idris in the Nür al-mut*? of the ShrT pupil of Majlisi al-Jaza'irT (<--)
repeats with subtle changes parts of al-Tha'labT's account of IdrTs. He also records the tradition

r
that Idris-Enoch "was first among such as tailor garments (khat al-thiyab)" specifically adding
that he was a khayyat (tailor) (al-Jaza'irT, qsas 71). The Persian qsas work ascribed to

Juwayri (<--) also refers to Enoch as the first person to "sew the garment" (lamih-y/ dakht;
Qisas, 47).

In a number of illustrated Persian qi;sas al-anbiya' texts including a ms. of the Juwayri
Qisas dated 1572 CE., Enoch is pictured as one associated with the craft of tailoring (Milstein
et. al.,1999:204). Similarly, in an illustrated Istanbul located ms. of the aSas of Tha s labi, Idris-
Enoch is pictured as "surrounded by angels" and "sewing a robe" (ibid,213). That Adam more
likely Idris-Enoch were in some sense tailors may have been a tradition repeated by Jewish
and/ or Muslim tailors in the bazaars and Vakil Mosque of Shiraz and hence known to the Bab
from his early years.

Like many Persianate poets including Jalal al-Din ROrni (d.672/1273), BA* very
frequently, in several major works and hundreds of prose and poetical alwah drew religio-
ethical lessons from stories and motifs rooted in the cpSas al-anbiya traditions. This for the
edification of his predominantly Muslim and EMT contemporaries. This is illustrated in several
of BA's works of the later Iraq period; most notably his Surat al-nush (Sura of the Counsel;
c. 1859?), K Nan c.1862), and L. Ayyab (Tablet of Job-->). In such works BA* succinctly
details a succession of qlsas al-anbiya' stories illustrating how past prophets were rejected or

> badly treated by their contemporaries. His purpose is primarily to enable the rejection of the
Bab to be understood and to pave the way for belief in his own theophanic message.

Job and his (unnamed) wife are greatly celebrated in the opening pages of the twenty-
> five page Arabic epistle of BA* variously entitled the L. Ayyab (Tablet of Job) and Sarat al-
> sabr (Surah of Patience, March 1863; Ar. text, AyyamT: 282-313). Therein are registered
> Islamicate forms of originally Jewish-Hellenistic Job materials found, for example, in the
> Testament of Job (1st. cent. BCE/CE?; Kohler, 1897; OTP 1:829-868). Job, though not the
> biblical book, also figures in a few other alwah of BA* (e.g. L.Sarraj, MA 7:65). AB*
occasionally interpreted verses of the biblical book of Job (SWAB: 171-2 on Job 19:25-27) and
> gave Q. 38:41 an allegorical interpretation. The "spring" (mughtasal) in this latter verse is
interpreted as the "spring of divine prophethood" (chashmih-yi nubuwwat-I &hi). On entering

din (Perfection of Religion) of I bn BabOya (d. 381/991): Noah's lived 2,500 years = 850 pre-
prophetic years + 950 years summoning his people + 700 post-flood years (cf. also Ibn
BabOya, 7/al, 32; MajlisT, 171 ayat, 1:247-8). This Islamic tradition greatly extends the biblical-
quranic period of Noah's 950 year lifespan (950 years = 1,000 minus 50; Gen. 9:29; Q.XX) (----
>):    Among the prophets (anbiya) was Noah (             ). For 950 years he was stricken

> with grief (      nawha namOd) and summoned the servants to the right-hand
> side of the [Sinaitic] vale of the Spirit (vac/1"-y' ayman-I rah).

Following these words BA* underlines Noah's intense suffering and rejection and states
that he repeatedly "promised victory to his companions". Allusion is made here to a Shis T Q1.585
tradition not found in either the Bible or the Q. BA* has it that Noah had several times fixed an
"hour of victory" (na,sr) which was deliberately unfulfilled by God (cf. Nu'manT, K. Ghayba, 153-
4;MajlisT, Bihar 2 11:326-8; 17layat, 1:247ff; Kohlberg, 1991, XVI).

God, BA* continues, operated according to the (proto-) ShrT principle of non-realization
stemming from a change in salvific circumstances. A change in the divine plan resulted
through bada' (loosely), the divine 'change of mind' which is an important Shri theological
principle well-known to the Bab. ShrT legends of the story of Noah sometimes make Noah a
type of Imam 'AR (Kohlberg, 1991 XVI:50). It seems likely that Noah in the K-Tqan is a type of
the rejected 'All, the Sayyid of Shiraz, the Bab who also utilized a theology of al-bada' which
may well have been an issue for the uncle of the Bab for whom the Kiaan was written in
1862\. 1 BA* references, in other words, to Noah and baa'a' in his KI, probably result from
concerns of the Bab's uncle relating to the issue of a cancelled jihad episode in early Bbl
history and to the Bab's being the successful, militaristic Qa-im bi'l-sayf (with the sword)
(Faydi, Khandan, 40-41, insert, Q. 4).

(cited Ibn BabOya, Kamal 475).

After his return from pilgrimage in 1845, the Bab cancelled an earlier proposed BabT
congregation in Karbala, most probably for the initiation of an eschatological jihad (holy war). A prayer
of the Bab written in response to questions relating to the meaning of the jihad oriented tradition of
Mufaddal b. 'Umar, makes it clear that eschatological expectations spelled out therein could be cancelled
through al-bada (INBA Ms 6003C:173ff.   cf. Sachedina, 1981:165-6).

The story of Noah, as told by BA* in the K.Tqan, continues by explaining that he was
repeatedly abandoned until, as set down in well-known books and traditions (kutub va akhbar;
KI:616), only 40 or 72 of his followers remained and survived the flood. As BA* indicates these
or similar figures are indeed found in most of the qi;sa,sal-anblya' legends of the story of Noah.
MajlisT in the 1:layat al-quI0b, for example, mentions a remnant of around 80 persons which is
eight (= Noah, his 3 sons and their wives = 4x2 = 8; Gen. 6:18, 7:7,13 cf. 1 Peter 3:20) above
the standard 'perfect number' 72, representative of the saved remnant of followers (cf. MajlisT,
ITlayat 1:262). Forty as the number of the remnant differs from the biblical tradition (MajlisT,
Binar, 2 11:336ff; 13:285f; MTrkhwand, Rawqat, tr. Rehatsek, 89).

Aside from his use of qi;sas al-anbiya' motifs in poetical writings of the Iraq and later
periods, aspects of the Islamic and sometimes biblical stories of Jesus and John the Baptist
were drawn upon in the period of his debate with AzalT Babis. This is evident in BA's Persian
Kitab-I badr (Wondrous Book), his Tablet of the Pope (L.-i pap)and other works of the Edirne
and Acre or West Galilean periods. At times BA* communicates a theological point using motifs
which have both qur'anic and biblical roots. Chronological and other details in the lives of
prophets, sages and philosophers are usually registered according to the Islamicate tradition.

Clijsas al-anbiya' rooted themes and motifs are common in the writings of the Bab and
BA* though they seldom refer to specific sources. Certain of the .71;sas al-anbiya' legends and
motifs registered or alluded to in the alwah of BA* can be source critically analysed though
few are sufficiently lengthy to invite detailed source critical analysis. Narratives touched upon
and motifs utilized are often too wide-rangingly paralleled in qi;sas al-anbiya' and associated
literatures to facilitate successful source critical identification. Comprehension of the meaning
of prophetological motifs in the writings of the Bab and BA* can, however, be greatly increased
by an understanding of their Islamic literary trajectories and significances.

Chapter Five
THE BIBLE AND ISRÄ'ILIYYAT IN SHP! ISLAM

I 5.1 Pre - Islamic revelations, the Bible and biblical talfilf ("falsification")

Although the Bible in the form of biblical and post-biblical materials, permeates the Q.

leaving an unmistakable influence, very little of this Judaeo-Christian scripture is directly cited
or straightforwardly duplicated. The Q. remains aloof from biblical scripture in expressing its
neo-Abrahamic, "pure" Arabic religiosity. Many centrally important biblical teachings as
expounded by Jews and Christians are not touched upon. If the canonical Bible were known
to Muhammad and his contemporaries, it was largely bypassed. The archetypal reality of the
Q. was not concrete Judaeo-Christian scripture but the umm al-kitab (Q.13:39; 43:4, etc), a
heavenly archetypal reality. Its concrete text is represented as an Arabic revelation, new and
pre-eminently "clear" (mubm).

Little of the Bible was deemed suitable for quranic citation within the Arabic Q. There
are only two reasonably exact quotations from the HB (-->). Relative to Judaism the Q.
contains, "a large amount of repeated Biblical material together with Midrashic elaborations,
and additions and adaptions based upon the laws and stories of the Pentateuch and the former
Prophets of the Hebrew Bible" (Lazarus-Yafeh, El 2 s Tawrat'). Though there is "much material"
in the Q. "which stands in some relation to the Old Testament" it is "hardly ever exactly
reproduced" (Bell, 1945:1).

The Q. also registers very little of the NT kelygma though the influence of oriental
Christian terminology and apocryphal stories is in evidence. Paul is not mentioned neither are
(pseudo-) Pauline texts cited. The centrality of the Gospel accounts of Jesus' resurrection go
unmentioned as does the theology of the Pauline corpus and of the Church Fathers (cf.
Q.19:15, 34; 4:156, Parrinder,1982:105ff). Though variously transformed, only a few of the
miraculous works and parables of Jesus are reflected in the Q. (Parrinder, 1982, Chps. 9 &10;
Robinson,1991, ch.14). Many key Christian teachings have no place in the Q. Muhartrimad
largely bypassed the intricacies of the Rabbinic discussions and the potentially divisive

Christological and related speculations of the patristic era.1

In representing itself as a Book of God, the Q. claims to legitimate, abrogate, confirm
and clarify the three or four bodies of pre-Islamic revelation to which it refers (Q. 5:48); namely,
(1) the ancient (pre-Mosaic) suhuf (scriptures), (2) the tawrat (Torah [H13]); (3) the zabar
(Psalter) and (4) the frill! (Evangel/Gospel) which are seen to be representative of the pristine,
original Bible (-->). These scriptures are often contrasted by Muslims with extant, canonical
and for them often tahrd ("corrupted") Judaeo-Christian scripture.

Little or no trace remains of a number of allegedly complete, very early pre-9th cent.

CE Bible translations mentioned in Arabic sources (Polliack,1997:3ff). 22 TheFihrist of al-
Nadim, for example, records that a protdgee of HarOn al-Rashid named Al-imad b. 'Abd-Allah
b. Salam (fl.c. 800 CE?) asserted that he had

> ".. translated.. the Suhuf ('[primordial] Scriptures'), the tawrat (Torah), the injil

> languages of the people of each book, into the Arabic language, letter by
> letter..." (Fihrist, 37, cf. Dodge 1:42, 2:945)

There likewise seems no remaining trace of Bible translations made during the 'Abbasid
period, such as that allegedly made by the Nestorian Christian translator (from Syriac and
Greek), 171 unayn b. lshaq (d. c. 873) ( Mas s Oa Tanbih,112). With a few exceptions, it was not

It is difficult, for example, as Beeston remarks, to know what to make of the Alexandrian biblical

consultation of Arabic translations or mostly through oral means. The earliest extant, complete
translation of the HB is the Judaeo-Arabic Tafsfr of the Jew Saadya Gaon (d. 942). Arabic
biblical citations proliferated from the 9th cent. CE though they are often inaccurate or highly
Islamicate. Aside from a few converts who collected biblical testimonia (e.g. 'AR b. Rabbabn
al-TabarT—>), Muslims writers often relied upon the oral transmission of biblical texts through
mediatory "people of the Book" (Adang,1996).

Throughout Islamic history there was a widespread transmission of Islamicate (pseudo-)
biblical citations. Many were loosely set down in early Islamic sources (<-1.2). They were
cherished by Sufis, philosophers, mystics, theologians and other proponents of divine tiikmat
and itfanT, "gnostic" philosophies. A small proportion of these numerous Islamified (pseudo-)
biblical texts have been collected by Islamicists, most notably by I gnaz Goldziher (d.1921), the
Spanish Christian Arabist Miguel Asin Palacios (d. 1944 --> bib. 1919/26) and most recently by
the Cambridge Islamicist Tarif Khalidi (—> bib. 2001).

Early Islamic Bible citations exhibit varying degrees of "accuracy" or levels of Islamic
"rewriting" for apologetic, doctrinal or other reasons. Diverse levels of "Islamification" are
evident. Very basically put, biblical citations in Islamic sources may be, (a) largely or
completely literalistic ("accurate") biblical citations (e.g the Ibn Qutayba, Genesis texts -->); (b)
partly "inaccurate" or showing a small amount of Islamicate rewriting (al-Ghazali; al-Bironi
Deut 33:2 -->); c) alleged biblical citations having a very tenuous relationship to one or more
biblical texts (e.g. Ibn al-'ArabT) and (d) pseudo-biblical citations which have no obvious
relationship to any biblical text(s) as commonly transmitted (e.g. occasionally al-GhazalT) and
(e) pseudo-biblical citations which are so thoroughly lslamicate that they bear no relationship
at all to biblical texts (al-DamirT; Mulla Sadra-->). Select examples of such biblical citations have
been given below (chs. 2 & 3), others will be set down in pages to follow.
II The charge of talnif ("falsification") and Islamicate pseudo-biblical texts.
Belief in the tahrlf ("falsification") of the Bible became widespread in the post-quranic
Muslim world. It outlawed or inhibited Muslim Bible study and quotation. The following quranic

Jewish and Christian scripture and tradition. Ibn Hazm spelled out some of the many "errors"
and "distortians" he felt underlined the to him obviously non-revealed nature of the Hebrew
Bible and Christian Gospels! NT (Palacious, 1927; Arnaldez, EI 2 111:795; Chejne, 1982; Pulcini,
1998, Adang, 1996:237-248).'

In the 19th century Muslim world a recrudescence of polemical, anti-biblical writing was
precipitated in response to evangelical orientalism in the form of anti-Islamic Christian
missionary propaganda. Especially notable in this respect was the widely distributed Mrzan al-
haqq ("The Balance of Truth"; Armenian, 1831; 1st Persian ed. Shushy 1835; 2nd ed.,
Calcutta, 1839; Urdu, 1840; Turkish, 1862; Arabic, 1865) of the German Protestant missionary
Carl Gottleib Pfander (1803-65). A notable response to his polemic focussed upon the issue
of biblical tahrif was publicly argued in Agra (India) in 1854 CE and subsequently written
down by the learned, universally respected Indian SW -I Muslim writer Rah mat-Allah ibn Khalil
al-s Uthmani al-Kairanawi [al-Hindi] (d. Mecca, 1308/1891). He sought to underline the
magnitude of biblical tahrif through his widely circulated Ighar al-haqq ("The Appearance of
the Truth", Ar. 2 vols. Istanbul 1284/1867; Turkish 1876-7; Eng. tr. 4 vols.1410/1989)
(Schirrmacher, 1999:270ff). His detailed critique of biblical texts took some account of the
"folly" of the ancient and pre-modern ideas about the biblical text (Powell, 1976:53). It had a
very wide sphere of influence (Powell, 1993:295-6) being known and responded to in the Shri
world. It was very probably known to AB* as evident in certain of his statements about the
biblical text and "higher criticism" (-->).2

Like Sayyid Abmad s Alawi during the Safavid period (-->) Shi s i Muslims of nineteenth
century Iran came to respond to the missionary endeavours and the translation activity of
/ On similar though even more focussed lines is the Igilartabdil al-yahad wal-nasara (Exposition
on the Alternation [of the Torah and Gospel] by the Jews and the Christians). According to Pulcini, Ibn
I-Jazm's numerous Arabic biblical quotations which sometimes differ significantly from the Masoretic text
and the Greek DO< are derived from a complete Christian produced Arabic Bible fundamentally qased
upon a Latin Vorlage (source document) (Pulcini, 185).

See for example, the details contained in the Tablet of AB* to Rosenburg cited in Weinburg,
Ethel leaner Rosenburg, 78-81.

various western missionaries. Among them the English evangelical Henry Martyn (d.1812)
who spent eleven months in Shiraz and Bushire (1811-1812) a few years before the Bab who
was 25 + years in these two cities (1819-->1844+ esp. 1845-6). Henry Martyn did much to
prompt Persian mullas and mujtahids to adopt a Shis i, anti-Christian stance. Many came to
condemn Christian missionary activity and some pointed out the tahrif limitations and
"corruption" of the Bible. Among these Shis i apologists was Mulla Muhammad Rida' Hamadani
[Tabrizil (d. 1830s?? ). In his Miftrlh al-nubuwwah (The Keys of Prophethood) he raised tahrff

issues in great detail in the course of responding to the evangelical tracts of Henry Martyn
(Lee 1824: 161-450; QU:129-30; Wolff: MJ3:156 No.1). Even the Oxford Semitic scholar
Samuel Lee (d.1852) was moved to write a defense of this Shi`i charge of biblical tahrrf
("falsification") in his Controversial Tracts (Lee, CT:451-584).

Muslim accusations centering upon allegations of biblical tahrif to some extent made
it irrelevant, unnecessary, even foolish for Muslims to become learned about and cite the Bible.
Yet, when assembling prophecies anticipating the truth of Muhammad and Islam this was often
viewed as a necessary task. Apart, however, from those entering Islam from an Abrahamic
religious background, relatively few Muslims acquired a detailed knowledge of the Bible. Many,
if not most, remained ignorant of its contents. Muslim commentaries upon canonical biblical
books were, until very recent times, unknown. The Mohomedan Commentary on the Holy
Bible (2 pts., 1862, 65) by the lndo-Muslim "modernist" Sayyid Ahmad Khan (d.1898) remains
more or less unique (Rippin, 1990).

For Muslims the miraculous, inimitable superiority (/:0z) and abbrogatory nature of the
Q. along with the existence of "sound" supplementary hadith/akhbar, all but rendered biblical
learning alien and superfluous. Many Muslims understood tahrif in ways which negated the
veracity of existing Abrahamic scripture. It is ironic today that while a large number of Muslims
view the bible as "corrupt" a very considerable number give fantastic importance to the
obviously forged pseudo-Gospel of Barnabas, often regarding it as the only extant "true" Injil
/ Gospel (Ragg, 1907; Sox.1984).

For apologetic or polemical reasons biblical knowledge was distinctly advantageous. for
Muslims. From the early Islamic centuries a number cited the bible (<--2.1ft) including, for
example, AbO al-Rabr Muhammad b. al-Laith (fl. late 8th cent. CE), 'Al' b. Rabban al-Tabart
(d. 241/855), I bn Qutayba (d. 276/889), al-Birani (d.c [after]. 442/1050), al-Ghazal'
(d.505/1111) 11 and the very linguistically equipped Safavid sage Al) mad al-Alawi (d. c.
1060/1650). It was largely after the 15th century due to western printing and missionary activity,
that the Bible became better known and more accurately cited by Muslim scholars ( -->4.2ff).

In 19th century Persia and elsewhere relatively few Muslims adopted a positive attitude
towards pre-Islamic scripture. In the course of attempting to prove truth of the mission of the
Bab to Muslims in the early 1860s, BA* found it necessary to cite the NT and reassert the
occasional and largely forgotten earlier Islamic acceptance of the Bible. He radically modified
the largely negative Islamic concept of biblical tahrTf. ("falsification" -->).
• Islamicate pseudo-biblical and pseudepigraphical texts.

Despite the Muslim accusation of biblical tahrTf directed towards Jews and Christians
some among them composed or cited what now seen obviously pseudo-biblical or
pseudepigraphical Abrahamic texts. The Bible was not readily available in Arabic, (Persian or
Turkish) translation throughout much of Islamic history especially during the early centuries AH
(7th-->mid.10th cent. CE). The circulation of Muslim generated pseudo-biblical and pseudo-
pigraphical writings was thus quite common.

Early ascetics and Sufis such Ibn al-Mubarak (d. 181/797), Abu Taub al-Makia (d.

386/996) and AbO Numayn al-IsfahanT (d. 430/1039) cited texts representative of cherished
Judaeo-Christian wisdom which they, to a greater or lesser degree, Islamified. It is often
difficult to know which biblical text or texts (if any) inspired Islamicate, Muslim "Bible" citations.
As Khalidi has recently put it, "Many Islamic texts prior to the ninth century A.D., texts of piety
and asceticism in particular refer often to the "Torah" or Hikmah in such terms as "It is said in

The Ilya 'dam al-din (The Revival of Religious Sciences) of al-GhazalT cites numerous often
quasi or non-biblical sayings of Jesu (see Khalidi, 2000). ,

the Torah or Hikmah" (ja'a fil-tawrat; jaa f/'/-1. 71kmah) followed by a moral maxim. Early
Western scholarly attempts to locate the origins of these maxims concluded that very few of
them were in fact traceable to the Bible" (Khalidi, 2001:21). That such early expressions of a
Muslim "Bible" are seen in later writers will be evident pages below about citations in the Mikhlat
(Nose-Bag) and Kashkal (Begging Bowl) of Shaykh Baha'i (-->).

Like other literary sources containing Isra'Tliyyat, biblical wisdom was often incorporated
into hadith qudsT(<-2.2). A good many early Shis i traditionalists, philosophers, mystics and
theologians quoted quasi-biblical or pseudo-biblical texts in their writings which often had little
or no biblical precedent. This seems true for many Muslim writers of the Safavid and Qajar
periods (16th—>19th cent CE). The Muslim Tawrat is not exactly or always the Hebrew Bible;
neither is the Muslim InjT1 always the canonical NT. The Muslim "Bible" is often an Islamified
or Islamicate phenomenon. Biblical texts are often recorded as voiced with a sometimes strong
Islamic accent. From the time of the earliest Sufis (<--) right up until the time of the Bab
authoritative biblical citations were frequently pseudo-biblical citations often exhibiting a
tenuous relationship to the biblical text.

Some Muslims claimed access to lost portions of pre-Islamic scripture (the "genuine"

Tawrat , the Zabar etc). Others ascribed their favourite biblical texts and logion, sometimes
their own pseudo-biblical compositions, to Abrahamic figures or Islamic worthies. Dimensions
of pseudepigraphy remained very much alive throughout the Islamic centuries. For over a
millennium sayings have been cited in a variety Islamic sources as if from the Bible or genuine
pre-Islamic scripture. This was often done as if the texts came directly from various biblical
books. Many of these texts were pseudo-biblical or non-biblical. Some were only vaguely, if at
all, biblically rooted although they acquired a great status within various Islamic literary
sources.

In 1910 the Christian Arab writer Cheiko wrote an article about "apocryphal legendary
[biblical]" material and reproduced extracts from an Islamic zabar (Psalter) version as well as
a portion from an Islamic manuscript entitled "A copy of the sahrfas of Abraham and Moses".

In an important 1986 article Sadan gave interesting details of various mss. locations of such
Islamicate versions of pre-Islamic scripture including a Munajat Masa mss. incorporating
features that might be called pre or proto-quranic. He also referred to a several chapter tawrat
(Torah) version contained in a SI-WI-Ism 5'TR

-    anthology (Sadan, in Sharon ed. 1986:373ff).
Such Islamic pseudo-biblical pseudepigraphon had a role to play in the Islamic
encounter with the Abrahamic religions. While the subject of the Abrahamic pseudepigrapha
in Islam has been touched upon (Wasserstrom, 1994), little detailed research has been done
in this area. Like Jews and Christians, Muslims also composed pseudepigraphical texts
(Reeves, 1994). Attention has been payed in this connection to versions and recensions of a K
al-malahim li Daniyal ("The Book of the Apocalypse of Daniel" —> Fodor, 1974;Hoyland, 1997,
index Daniel):

Islamic pseudepigraphal writings include versions and recensions of a K al-mala him If
Daniyal. A number of ShT'T recensions are known one with an introduction by MajlisT's pupil
Ni s mat-Allah al-Jaza'irT (d. 1112/1701) and another by known to Ibn Tawas. Certain ShT'T
versions of this work imply that it was knowledge of cryptic predictions in the Malhamat Daniyal
which enabled AbO Bakr and 'Umar to bypass Imam 'All and gain the successorship to
Muhammad (Fodor 1974:85ff; Kohlberg, 1992:143).
II 5.2 Isra'Tliyyat and the Bible in early ShT'Tsm.

Several important lmamT ShrT factions, including early Zaydis, Isma'ilis and Sufi
sympathizers as well as later twelver thinkers and Safawid philosopher-theologians, had a
significant influence within Islamic history in that they nurtured a tradition of biblical awareness,
citation and dialogue. An openness was shown towards the ahl al-kitab and towards messianic
and allegedly proto-Shri dimensions of their sacred writings and traditions.
Little academic work has been done on Isra'iliyyat and the Bible in specifically ShTsT

i See Fodor 'Malhamat Daniyal,' in The Muslim East,.. (Budapest, 1974—> bib.), 85-133, which
reproduces 26 pages of the anonymous (Najaf n.d. ed.) of Malhamat DanTyal.

sources though some useful late 19th and 20th century articles exist including, for example,
key articles by Friedlander, Vajda, Corbin, Kohlberg, Wasserstrom, Moreen and others (-->
bib.). It seems that from the earliest period Shi s T converts and writers were open to the
appropriation of biblical data and Abrahamic Isra'Tliyyat. It has been observed that Isma'TIT and
lmami Shris were ""Biblicizing" in their attitude towards the past" (Wasserstrom, 1994 [104
299). Neither Kulayni's Llsol al-katr nor Majlisi's Bihar al-anwar appear to contain especially
negative forms of the hadditho an banT 'Saila or register trenchantly anti-Isralliyyat
traditions (<-1.2; 2.1; MajlisT, Bihar2 14:494f).

Neither Goldziher (d.1921) nor Goitein (d.1985), perhaps the two most learned
representatives of earlier Judaeo-Arabic study, were sufficiently conscious of the magnitude
of what has recently been called the "Judaeo-ShrT symbiosis" (Wasserstrom, 1994:297-324).
Few took up Wellhausen's (d.1918) observation that "the dogma of Shi' ism... seems to stem
more from the Jews than from the Persians" (ibid, 298). Recently, however, Wasserstrom has
written a penetrating analysis of the Sunni dictum, "The ShrTs [rafida] are the Jews of our
Community [umma]" (idem, 1994). He has underlined the fact that ShrT and Jewish doctrine
have a good deal in common.

There is no doubt that Islamified, biblical teachings played a significant role in the
evolution and crystallization of ShrT doctrine. Judaeo-Christian traditions had a significant
impact upon ShrT apologetics. This may be reflected in the following well-known saying of the
prophet, "The 'ulama' (learned) of our community are even as the anbiya' (prophets) of the
children of Israel" (al-Absal, s Awali, 4:77; cf. 1:357; 2:241+fns). Several other ShrT traditions
compare and contrast aspects of Islamic and Judaic religiosity. Imam Ja sfar al-Sadiq, for
example, is reckoned to haye stated,

> The likeness of the weaponry (al-salah) among us [Imami Shris] is as the
> likeness of the Ark of the Covenant among the children of Israel (al-tabetif banT
> isra71)who were the progeny of Israel (barn? Isra- 71). In other words the [Shri]
> people of the House (ahl al-bayt) who discovered the Ark of the Covenant (al-          1
> OM) in their possession (? 'upon their gate',bab) attained prophethood (al-
> nubuwwa). Whoso among us attains this weaponry (al-salah) has thereby
attained the Imamate ('al-/mama,) (Bihar 21:238)

• The proto-Shr ism of the ghulat ("extremist") factions.

Numerous early Shil Muslims belonged to groups which have been inadequately
labelled ghulat ("exaggerators"). These highly diverse early ShrT factions greatly influenced
evolving, and subsequent Imaml and twelver Shri thought (Kohlberg 1973:320). While some
controversial doctrines championed by the "exaggerators" came to be rejected (e.g.
anthropomorphism and metempsychosis) others were accepted, including messianic beliefs
and the concept of raja, "return". It was also among ghuluww thinkers that the Jewish rooted
notion of an al-Ism a/-a Om (mightiest Name [of God]) held central importance and came to
be conceptually transformed within an evolving Shi't theology. Babl-Bahal doctrines of the
al-ism al-a'gam would appear to have their Islamic roots in the theological speculations of early
ghulat groups (-->).

It has long been realized that mainstream, heterodox and heretical Abrahamic religious,
groups including Jewish factions, Christian groups, Gnostics, Manicheans and Mandaeans as
well perhaps as Qumran sectarians and Samaritan thinkers, influenced the development of
Shi'T doctrine and practise. Key Shri messianic and imamological concepts including the
Imam' ma'som (infallibility) applied to the Imams , can be well accounted for as a result of
influences from the above channels. The influence of gnostic and other cosmologies,
prophetologies, messianisms and apocalyptic perspectives are often closely reflected in the
thought of ghuluww ("extremist") factions (Wasserstrom, 1985; 96f; Cranfield, 1991:132-
160). 1 Multiple forms of Islamic "gnosis" "remained very much alive and active in the early
Islamicate period" (Wasserstrom, 1997 [10S]:130-131). Similar ghuluww doctrinal tendencies,
it should be remembered, .had a significant impact upon the initially 'heterodox Shi s ism i of the
early Safavid period (Babayan, 1994;1996).

1 To some degree in this connection mention has already been made of the alleged role of Imam
'All in tafsfr (cf. —> 2.10? on dialogue), of the probably Zaydi Muqatil b. Sulayman (<-1.1) and of the
Shrite historians Ya'qObT, Mas'odT, and MaqdisT.

From early times Sunni writers have held the view that a most probably fictitious
Yemenite Jewish convert to Islam named 'Abd-Allah ibn Saba' (or Ibn al-Sawda' , 'son of the
black') was the fountainhead of early Shi s ism. Nascent ShT'Tsm was early considered an
aberrant Isra'Tliyyat informed offshoot of Judaism (Murtacla al-'Askarl, Abd-Allah b. Saba'-->
bib.). This Ibn Saba' is said to have deified Imam 'All by teaching that God was incarnate in
him. He apparently predicted his Christ-like raj'a ("return") in the clouds both before and after
his death (by assassination in 40/661). Ibn Saba' is pictured as one who held to the basically
Christian concept of "return" which he linked to Q. 28:5 and the person of Muhammad
(TabarT, TarTkh [2942] tr. Humphreys, 15:146+ index).

Only the MansOriyya among numerous other ghuluww groups can be touched upon
here. These are the "extremist" followers of Ala° MansOr al-'1j1i (d.c.121 /738) who claimed to
succeed Imam Muhammad al-Baqir. Evidently again subject to Christian and other religious
influences, al-ljli regarded Jesus as the first created being (cf. Jn1:1), Imam 'Ali being the
second. Like the qur'anic Jesus al-'IjIT claimed to have been raised up to heaven where an
anthropomorphic God "wiped his head with his hand" (cf. Isa. 25:8b; Rev. 21:4). The Deity
addressed him in Persian or Syriac saying, "My son, go and teach on my behalf' (Madelung,
Mansuriyya, EI 2 V1:441). al- s ljli considered the early Imams to be messenger-prophets and, like
the Bob, claimed to have brought the ta'wll (interpretation) of the Q.

al-Qasim b. Ibrahim (d. Medina 246/860) was among the important early followers of
Zayd b. 'Ali ( d.122/740) (Madelung, 1965; Abrahamov,1988). He wrote a K al-Radd 'aka al-
nasara (Refutations of the Christians) which included a few NT citations (Di Matteo,1921-3).
It is also clear from his 'The Tabaristanis Question' that he convened gatherings in his Egyptian
home where he discussed theological and other matters with Christians from several different
backgrounds (Abrahamov,1988). Such dialogue with various religionists is also reported of the
ShisT Imams.

III The ShrTte Imams, Isralliyyat and the Bible

Many statements of the first, sixth, seventh and eighth Imams, indicate their impressive
knowledge of the Bible and of the Jewish and Christian religions (Damad, Thaqalayn, 2/iii-iv,
99-100).This is especially clear from an examination of works of Ibn BabOya al-Qummi (d.
280/901) such as his K Tawhid (Book of the Divine Unity, c. 3401 950), Kamal al-din (The
Perfection of Religion-->), the Ayen akhbar al-Rida' and various ihtijaj (Religious Disputation)
and related compilations. Important in this respect are the otijaj works of al-Tabarsi (d. c.
548/1153 <-2.1) and MajlisT (otijajat = Bibar2 vols. 9-10) 1 some of whose Persian works are
also significant in this respect, especially his ljayat al-qulOb ("The Enlivening of the Hearts",
see Hayat II:1071ff). Like the closely related and widely dispersed masail (Questions and
Answers) traditions an example of which is found in the Persian Tabari Tarikh(<--3.1), the rich
in Isralliyyat Shis T otijaj sources include details of religious confrontations between the
prophet, various (twelver) Imams and members of the ahl al-kitab (Jews, Christian, etc).2
Isralliyyat traditions and Islamicate biblical citations are often numerous in these sources.

Twice translated into Persian during the Safawid period al-Ihtijal 'ala ahl al-lajaj ("The
Disputation against the People of Obstinacy") of al-TabarsT records a tradition relayed through
Ja'far al-Sadiq and Imam 'All detailing a debate of Muhammad with a Jew, a Christian, an
Atheist, a Dualist (Zoroastrian) and an Idolator (I htijaj, 1:21ff). Muhammad confounds Jewish
and Christian assertions about the supposed Sonship (ibn Allah) of Ezra and Jesus. Using his
opponents logic he argues that if Ezra who revived the Torah is called Ibn Allah (Son of God)
why not Moses to whom this very book was revealed. Jesus could not be the I bn Allah because
his own words contradict belief in his unique Sonship. Muhammad, it was pointed out, recalled
that Jesus had said "I am going to my Father and to your Father" (cf Jn 14:16; lhtijaj, 1:23-4).

/Volumes 9 and 10 within the second edition of MajlisT's Bihar form the K al-il.Waj (Book of
the Confrontation' = 345pp + 454pp) and reproduce material from a wide range of //.7tijajsourc9s

2 Bulky ShT'T Ihtilaj volumes date from the 3rd / 9th. century. The DharT'a lists a dozen or more
al-Ihtijaj (Religious Disputation) volumes (DharT' 1:281-4 Nos.1471ff). Among them is one of Ibn
Shahrashab (d.58811191; Dharra no. 1472)

• The Christian Patriarch BarTha and the ShT'T theologian Hisham b. al-Hakam (d. 179 /
Among the 17.7qajat (religious disputations) recorded in the K Taw1.7id (section 37) is
the record of an early Shrf- Christian debate located in Baghdad (Karkh) which Thomas has
dated to the 140s / c. 765 and described as a "carefully dramatized narrative" (Thomas,
1988:60; 1992:190 fn.4). It took place between an otherwise unknown Christian Patriarch
named BarTha and the ShrT merchant and theologian Hisham b. al-Hakam (d. 179/796). The
debate is partly oriented around the Christian doctrine of the trinity and the error of "those
who say that God is the "third of three" (Q.5:73; K. Tawhid, [ sect. 37]: 270-275).

This early dialogue includes a brief account of the conversion to Shrfsm of BarTha
through Hisham b. al-H akan through the seventh Imam Masa al-Kazim (d.183/799) then
resident in Medina. Imam MOsa allegedly questioned BarTha about his knowledge of al-kitab
(the Book, Bible, NT) and was told that Masa had an unsurpassed knowledge of its ía 'WI!
(exegesis, interpretation). The account highlights the miraculous biblical knowledge of Imam
Musa. In Christ-like fashion he began to recite the Gospel (qira'at al-inj11). An astounded
BarTha asked Imam Masa where he had obtained such knowledge of biblical recitation. Imam
Ja sfar al-Sadiq explained,

> 'We [the Imams] have the [Abrahamic] books as a legacy from them. We recite
> them as they did, and pronounce them as they did... (K.Tawhid, 275; tr. Thomas
> 1988:54ff, 60). 1

BarTha and his female attendant are said to have become devotees of Ja'far al-Sadiq
( and Imam MOsa) around 148/765. This apologetically oriented ihtijaj is instructive and may
say more about the concerns of Ibn BabOya than be an accurate reflection if a mid. 8th century
9M-1-Christian debate (Thomas 1988:62ff). Whatever the case, the importance and example

'Thomas notes that "It is known that Hisham b. al-Hakam was a merchant as well as an
intellectual and that he moved from his native lacuna to Baghdad sometime in the mid-second/eighth
century" (1988:60). Apart from the K al-taw1.7id this religious encounter is cited the Ilitilaj of TabrTzT
(<--) and, among other ShT'T sources, in MajlisT's Bihar al-anwar 2 (10:234ff).

of the Imam being supernaturally biblically aware is evident.
IN A debate of 'All b. Musa                   (d. 203/818)

It is the eighth Imam, al-Riqa' to whom biblical knowledge and skill in dialogue are
especially attributed in the Ihtijaj sources. The account of his debate of c. 202/817-8 set up
and before the 'Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'rnon (189/813-210/817?) is noteworthy.' This
ecumenical debate was initiated when the Caliph ordered leading religious figures (ahl al-
adyan) and upholders of diverse religious opinions (alshab al-maqalat) to take part in a debate.
The (Armenian) Patriarch (al-jathillq), the Jewish Exilarch sais al-jalat), leaders of the
Sabaeans strasa al-sabfün), Zoroastrians and others were ordered to take part (lbn BabOya,
Tawhid, 417). Imam al-Riqa' is said to have debated with these leaders as an expert in all past
sacred scriptures in their original languages (Hebrew, Persian Greek, etc). He exhibited a
perfect knowledge of biblical prophecies fulfilled in Islam. He stunned the Jewish Exilarch by
reciting verses of the Torah and citing a conflation of Isa 21:7 and parts of Ps.149 (Tawhid, tr.
Thomas, 1988:73+ fn.53,77).

During the debate al-Ricla' raised the question of the early loss of the true Gospel(s).

He asked the Patriarch to explain how "the first Gospel" was lost, rediscovered and reached
its present form. The Patriarch stated that the Gospel was lost for a day, then rediscovered
when John and Matthew communicated it. Claiming greater knowledge of Gospel origins than
the Patriarch, the Imam explained as follows,

> I know that when the first Gospel was lost the Christians met together with their
> experts and said to them: 'Jesus son of Mary has been killed and we have lost
> the Gospel. You are the experts, so what can you do?' Luke and Mark said to
> them: 'The Gospel is in our hearts and we will produce it for you book by book,
> every one. .. we will recite it to you, each and every book, until we have brought
> it together for you completely'. So Luke, Mark, John and Matthew 2 sat down
> and wrote for you this Gospel after you had lost the first Gospel. But these four

'Refer al-Tabarsi, Ihtijaj,11:415-432; Bihar 2 10:299-307 cf.49:173ff and also Ibn Babuya, Vyon
al-akhbar (2:139f) and K al-Tawhid (sect. 65417-441).

It is of i nterest to note that this order of the four Gospels is also given al-ShahrastanT in the third
prolegomenon to his a/-Milal wa'l-mhal (Cairo 1968:15). In his commentary on the Usul al-K"aft Mulla
Sadra also at one point lists the four Gospels (pl. al-anajil al-arba'a) in this order in a citation from al-
Shahrastani (= Lk., Mk, Jn., Matt.) (Sh-Kafi, 3:597; cf. Imam Rida' in K.Tawhid, 426 cf. Bihar 210:3061)

> were disciples of the first disciples...(K.Tawhid, 425-6 tr. Thomas, 74 cf. Bibar2

10:306f).

That an original (single) InjTI was replaced by those of the four evangelists is echoed
in other Islamic sources including al-Jabiz, (Radd, 2411:8-20) and 'Abd al-Jabbar (al-Mughnf
V:143; TathbIt dalg 'il 152, 1:6-155; Thomas, 1988:74. fn.61) as well as al-Shahrastani (<--fn.)
Some of these sources reckon that the original Gospel was written in Hebrew or Syriac
[Aramaic] and replaced by an inadequate version in Greek or some other language. Writing on
the WTI in his Insan al-kamg for example, the SW -Re Sufi of the school of Ibn                       'Abd
al-KarTm         (d. 832/1428) held that God sent down the Zabür to David and the Infil to
Jesus in the Syriac language (brl-lughat al-swygniyya),

In the course of debating Jesus' power of resurrection Imam Ricia' made the following
Isra'Iliyyat informed statement:

Elisha (Alyasa') performed similar acts to Jesus, walking on the water,
> reviving the dead, healing the blind and lepers, though his community never
> took him as Lord, and no one ever worshipped him in place of God, great and
> mighty [cf. 2 Kings 2:12f;4:32f; 5:1ff]. The prophet Ezekiel (1:fizqr1) performed
> similar acts to Jesus son of Mary, for he revived thirty-five thousand men sixty
years after their deaths [cf. Ezek. 37:1ff] (K.TawhTd, 422; tr. Thomas 1988:70).

The Christian Patriarch also affirmed Imam Ricla's knowledge of Jesus' (conflated
Johannine) Paraclete promises,

> I am going to my Lord and your Lord, [Jn 20:17b, cf. Jn 16:5a etc,] and the
> Paraclete will come [15:26a]. He it is who will witness to me [Jn 15:26c] about
> the truth as I have witnessed to him, and he it is who will explain to you
> everything [Jn 14:26b]; he it is who will expose the evil deeds of the peoples,
> and he it is who will shatter the designs of the unbelievers [cf. Jn 16:8] ( ibid, tr.

Thomas ibid, 73+fns., 78).'

This ititijaj episode detailed in his KTawhld and elsewhere has been reckoned by Thomas
"the earliest surviving compendium of theological discussions from a ShT' ite author" and seen
as an "artificial", creation designed to "secure the [SW -0 groups position within the Muslim

With such ShT'T biblical citations from one allegedly learned in the Hebrew writings [sic.] of the
Sabaeans, the Persian texts of the Zoroastrians and the Greek writings of the philosophers problems of
tatirff ("falsification") are obviously compounded.

intellectual community" (Thomas, 1988:53,80; cf. 65ff K. Tawhid: 417ff). Whatever their
historical veracity such ShrT ihtliajat accounts contain often conflated Islamicate Bible
citations which certainly influenced post-10th century ShrT Bible awareness and attitudes
towards the people of the Book.

Shil data from various VIM episodes seems to be reflected in the writings of both
BA* and AB*. In an epistle addressed to a Jewish covert named Hakim HayyTm in response
to a question about the absence of a Gospel reference to the promised Ahmad of Q. 61:6, BA*
stated that many of Jesus' revelations were not included in the extant, post-apostolic Gospels
assembled by the four evangelists. In saying this he may be influenced by the assertions of
Imam Riga' or by other similar Islamic statements (e.g. <-- ShahrastanT). AB* not only drew
upon OW accounts involving Muhammad's debating with Christians but, in certain of his
a/wah, held that the original Injll Gospel(s) was in Hebrew being later rewritten in Greek (bi-
lisa—I YbranT va yunanT)(Ma'idih 9:22, 27).
• Some proto-Isma'TIT and later IsmalIT sources

The originally Arabic perhaps proto-IsmalIT Persian treatise Umm al-kitab (The
Archetype of the Book) may be representative of an early phase of "Central Asiatic Ismallism"
(Filippani-Roncalli, 1977:105; Halm 1996:82). It takes the form of a discussion between Imam
Muhammad al-Baqir (d.c.126/743) and three luminous initiates (roshanian) (ed. Ivanow, Der
Islam XXIII). Apparently transmitted by the IsmallTs of Badaskshan, it reflects late 2-3rd17-8th
century Shi'T gnosis associated with Abol-Khattab (d.c.138 or 147/755/764), a disciple of
Jasfar al-Sadiq. Materials within the Umm al-kitab express the Shri appropriation and
Islamization of Iranian, Abrahamic, Hellenistic and other streams of tradition. It reflects aspects
of the gnosis of antiquity as crystalized within an early Iraqi Shri faction (Filippani-Ronconi,
1964; Halm, 1996).
In the Umm al-kitab creation is associated with the hubris of an exalted angel named

'Azazill who is familiar in Jewish, Shi s i and ShaykhT angelology (-->5.1f). In this work a non-
literal understanding of the 'Fall of Adam' (Per. adam-I mu'tamd) and of his (humanity's)

subsequent qiyama ("resurrection") as the adam-I qaim is registered (umm al-kitab, 112,
350ff; 393ff; Filippani-Ronconi, 1977:108ff). Other biblical motifs such as the four rivers of
Paradise (Gen. 2:101) and the biblical-quranic Sinaitic theophany are also utilized (Umm al-
kitab, 112; Filippani-Ronconi, 1977:108ff). Christian influence is evident in the prologue of the
Umm al-kitab where a pericope highlights the superior knowledge of Imam Baqir in matters of
jafr, gematric mysticism and prognosis (Corbin, 1983:154; Lambden, 1986:161). Letter
mysticism is also evident and is strongly reminiscent of data within the Jewish Sepher Yetsira
and the anthropomorphic symbolism of the Shi'ur Qomah traditions. The 19 letter basmala
is referred to as a sacred Arabic ejaculation representative of the 12 ummuhat ("mothers")
and 7 "intelligences" which form the (Per.) shakhs ("Person") of the Godhead (ibid, 22ff, 60ff:
Filippani-Ronconi, 1977:115).

After the time of the sons of Ja'far al-Sadiq, IsmanIT Muslims were such as gave
centrality to the lmamite of this sixth Imam's (younger) son 'small (d.145/762) from whom
their name derives. By the 4th-5th/11th cent. the Ismallis adopted aspects of a Neoplatonic,
apophatic theology and cosmology. An allegorical hermeneutic was much favoured amongst
them. IsmanIT hermeneutical adwar (cyclic), prophetological and other doctrines have a good
deal in common with BabT-Bahan perspectives. Their allegorical approach to pre-Islamic
scripture is often similar to that of the Bab and BA* as well as subsequent Babi-Bahal writers.'

As will be demonstrated, several early Isman thinkers show a good knowledge of the
Bible. IsmalIT non-literal biblical exegesis played a part in medieval and later apologetic writing.
In his list of 'Non-Isma s TIT works used by Ismallis' under the heading 'Admonitions and
Exhortations', Poonawalla includes the Kitab al-tawrat, the Kitab al-zabar and ahadith ban!
Isra'fl (= Isra'Tliyyat; Poonawalla, 1977:359f). Isra'iliyyat traditions about the al-ism al-a'zam
(Mightiest Name of God) were registered and interpreted within Isma'TIT literatures. Interesting

s

1 No detailed discussion of the relationship between Isma'TIT Islam and the BabT-Baha'T religions
can be attempted here. There are several doctrinal and hermeneutical similarities which may be
accounted for by virtue of the ShrT-IrfanT and ShaykhT appropriation of Isma'TIT doctrines.

commentary upon graphical forms of the mightiest Name of God are found in Isma'TIT literatures
which are parallelled and developed in ShaykhT literatures and Babi-Bahn scriptural writings.
In his 1943 Gnosis- Texte der/small/ten, for example, Strothmann published a Risala al-ism al-
a*gam (Treatise upon the Mightiest Name). This work expounds in detail a sevenfold graphic
form of this incomparable Name incorporating forms of the Arabic letters -A (ha) and a

distorted, inverted letter j (waw) (Strothmann, 1943:171-180). Esoteric commentary upon

such elements of the Mightiest Name is important in Shi s i and Shaykhi texts and is
fundamental to Babi and Baha'T religious identity (-->6.1).

II The Rasa71 lkhwan al-safa' (The Epistles of the Brethren of Purity)

'The identity of the probably 4th/10th cent. Ikhwan al-Safa' (Brethren of Purity) is not
known with any certainty. The fifty-two Rasail ascribed to them evidence a close relationship
to Ismaili doctrines, they "rewrote Neoplatonic and Pythagorean natural philosophy and
metaphysics in Islamic terms" (Murata, 1992:329). Their exposition of semi-esoteric "realities"
sometimes goes beyond Islamic doctrinal norms. The authors of the Rasa71 were influenced
by numerous streams of thought including Hermetic "wisdom" and the syncretistic "gnosis" of
the Sabaeans of Harr a- n. Yet these rasa'il "occupy a place in the first rank of Arabic literature",
having had an influence within both Sufism and SM.-ism (Marquest E1 2). The missionary Wolff,
it is relevant to note here, reported that the RasaY1 were studied by the learned in early 19th
century Shiraz (MJ 111:53-4). This was doubtless also the case in other Iranian locations. The
vocabulary of the Bab at times appears to reflect that of certain of the RasaW. 1 Some of the
Rasa'll are indebted to the Bible, Greek philosophy and aspects of Jewish and Christian
doctrine (Netton,1982:53ff; Marquet, E1 2). The I khwan cited the HB and Rabbinic lore and had

'e.g. R 2:277 a7g al-all:win, "The most elevated of the exalted ones" (—>), although this matter
is beyond the scope of this thesis.

a some knowledge of the NT in several textual traditions. Moses and aspects of pentateuchal
history and Islamo-biblical prophetology are occasionally present in the Rasail (R1:156-7; 186;
2:279ff; 4:16, 32). The reading of Abrahamic scripture and the Infil (Gospel[s]) is recommended
for these scriptures are said to result from angelic [divine] inspiration (bil-waly min al-malaika
s. 4:42, 245; 1:363; 3:246; Netton 1983:54). The following citation allegedly mentioned in
"certain of the books of the prophets of the children of Israel", is given in the form of a double
post-quranic revelation (hadIth qudsa

> "God, exalted be He said,
> '0 son of Adam, I created thee for all eternity (11-1-abd), for I am the Living One
> (a1-1.7ayy) who dieth not. So be obedient unto whatsoever I command thee and
> turn aside from whatsoever I prohibit thee. Then shall I make thee to be one
> who liveth eternally and dieth not (hayy' la tamot abad an ).
> 0 son of Adam! I am Powerful (qadir a") such that I need only say to a thing,
> 'Be!' and it is (lain fa-yalrün). [= Q.3:59, 6:72, etc] Then obey Me regarding
> whatever I have commanded thee and turn aside from whatever I have
> forbidden thee. Then shall I make thee one powerful (qadir ') such that thou
need only say to a thing, 'Be! and it shall be' (kOn fa-yakan) (R1:298).

Rewritten Genesis texts are clearly in evidence here (e.g Gen 3:22a). This is a
scriptural citation which is obviously Islamicate possibly also reflecting a gnostic exaltation of
the primordial man.

The authors of the Rasail were aware of Jesus and of Christian doctrines and
denominations (Monophysites, Jacobites [Ar. Ya s qubi] and Nestorians R2:283-4). Jesus is
quite often mentioned in the Rasail (R4:19;2:232, 280; 3:287; 4:19, 42, etc). He is once
designated by the Johannine, non-quranic epithet "Son of the Father" (Ibn al-ab, 2 Jn1:3). His
"humanity" and "divinity" are referred to by means of the Syriac Christological loan words
naset (Syr. nak.itha) and lahOt (Syr. 'a/ghtitha) respectively.'

The reality of the bodily crucifixion of Jesus is accepted in the Rasa7/. Jesus was taken
before the "king of the children of Israel [Jews]" who ordered his crucifixion (bi-salbilll). When

'These terms were early utilized by al-Hallaj ( Massignon 1997:31) and subsequently used by
many Sufi writers and in Babi-Baha'r mystical cosmologies (R2:283-4;R2:367; R3:161; Netton
1982:55,122:fn.23).

carried out Jesus' nasat (humanity) was crucified (fa-sullba nasatih1). It is explicitly stated that
his two hands were driven with nails (summarat) upon two wooden pieces of the cross ('ala
al-khashabatayi al-sallb). Jesus remained hanging crucified (maslab an ) from forenoon until the
afternoon (cf. Jn 19:31; R4: 31). These teachings obviously differ from the mainstream Muslim
denial of Jesus' bodily crucifixion though they are echoed in a tradition highly regarded and
much cited by the Bab (T. Baqara, 195;Q. Zavarih, 69:425, etc—>).

Important references to the Paraclete styled the baraqIrtal-akbar (Greatest Paraclete)
are found towards the beginning of the fifty-two RasaY1 (1:40) and twice in the related Risalat
al-Jamra ("Comprehensive Epistle", 11:354, 365). This Islamic Paraclete is twice associated
with the expected Mandi in the Rasa'il (al-mandf al-muntazar; R. 1:40; J. 2:365, Netton,
II Hand al-Din al-KirmanT (d. after 411/1021)

The prolific, polymathic philosopher-theologian Harrad al-Din al-KirmanT (d. after
411/1021) was an important Isma'TIT thinker well acquainted with pre-Islamic scripture. He cited
the Hebrew Bible and the Syriac Gospels in Arabic transliteration (Kraus,1931; Baumstark,
1932). This in at least four of his works perhaps implying that he had some knowledge of pre-
Islamic scripture in their original languages (Kraus, 1931:244; Walker 1999:55). Written around
404/1013 for the Buyid ShrT vizier of Iraq, Fakhr al-Mulk, KirmanT's K al-Masablh IT ithbat al-
imama ('The Book of Lamps in the Establishment of the Imamate') cites Deut. 33:2-3 and lsa
21:7 (well-known Islamic testimonia) in proof of the mission of Muhammad (ibid; Cortesse,
2000: 37-8).

In an article about Fat imid propaganda among Jews, Stern has pointed out the
significance of certain of these biblical citations of al-KirmanT (Stern, 1983) 1 In one of his works
KirmanT relates Zech [not Isaiah] 9:9 to the Fat imid Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr-Allah (d.

1    .   .

Cited in the K 'Llyon al-akhbar of the Ismaili cla- 7 Idris of Yemen. This passage appears to
be identical with a part of al-KirmanT's Risala mabasim al-bisharat bil-imam al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah
(written, 405-6/1-14-5). See Hamid HajT, 1998:45-54; cf. Cortesse, 2000:42-3.

996/1021). He is "Zion" in the phrase ii s rnm ("daughter[s] of Zion") and "Jerusalem" in
10\. 17ttill': 11; ("daughter of Jerusalem", Zech 9:9a). In proof of this it is argued that the mighty
al-Hakim and not Jesus of Nazareth is the one who appears as 1; im ("thy king"), "riding upon
an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass [sic.]" (Zech 9:9b).

The Baha'T leader AB* gave very similar interpretations to Isaiah 11:1ff when applying
prophecies of the HB normally applied to Christ reckoning them more adequately fulfilled in
BA* and his age (SAQ. XI Iff; cf SWAB :166-7). The 1335 "days" of Daniel 12:12 as "years" of
the Selucid era (commencing 311-12 BCE) were applied by al-KirmanT to the time of the
messianic Caliph al-Hakim (Stern, 1983: 93ff). 1 This Isma'TIT use of ta'wil applied to the Bible
has a close hermeneutical parallel in Baha'T, ("spiritual") Bible exegesis. AB* interpreted the
1335 "days" of Dan. 12:12 as solar "years" commencing at the Hijrah (622 CE) and thus
yielding 1957 CE. This date is further understood by Bahals as marking the centennial
commencement of BA*'s mission in Tehran in 1853 CE, which gives 1963 CE considered
indicative of the Baha'T establishment of the kingdom of God on earth (AB* cited PAB:31).2
II Some early ImamT ShT'T writers: Ibn BabOya ( d.381 / 991) and others

The abovementioned ShT'T apologist Ibn BabOya Babwayhi] al-Qummi was an
important pillar of Twelver Shi s ism and an expert in Shiite legalism and the Imarni traditions.
Several of his thirty or more extant works contain Islamo- biblical citations often relayed by the
Imams as well as Isralliyyat traditions reworked in the service of ImamT Shilsm (<-2.2). His
important   lkmal [Karnali al-din 17 ithbat al-ghayba         ("Perfection of Religion through the
Establishment of the Occultation") makes very considerable use of biblical and q4sa.sal-anbiya'

context Imam Sadiq cites the tawrat (Torah) as follows,

> blessed be that servant who diligently purifies himself in his own house then
> visits me [God] in my House [in Jerusalem]' (Thawab, 51).

The tawrat is also by the same Imam a little later in the same work in connection with ritual
purity on visiting the mosque: 'Blessed be whomsoever purifies himself in his own house then
visits me. The True One (al-haqq) shall indeed be associated with such a shrine (al-mazmor)
and shall honour the visitor (Ibid, 52).

Centrally important is the wide-ranging Film:5f (Bibliographical Compendium) of the
probably Persian ShrT, Baghdadi book dealer, AbOl-Faraj Isnaq b. Warraq al-Nadim (d.380/
990). His Fihrist has been described as dealing "with almost every phase of medieval culture"
(Dodge, 1970 1:xi). Peters reckoned it "the single most important document on philosophy
among the Arabs" (1968:277). This encyclopaedic, "unique specimen of literature", (E.Ir.
IX:465f) records a great deal relating to the Bible and Isra'iliyyat. It is related from Theodore
(Tiyadorus, a commentator on Genesis), for example, that God addressed Adam in the
Nabatean dialect because it was "purer (afsah) than Syriac (al-stnyani)" being spoken by
pre-Babel humanity (Fihrist, 23/ Dodge1:22). In the very detailed and interesting section on
biblical scripture (= Fihrist 1.2) Ibn NadTm has it from a certain Ahmad that the alwah (tablets)
revealed to Moses on Sinai were "green" in colour, with the writing on them "red like the rays
of the sun" (ibid 38/Dodge, 43). Reeves has stated that "One of the most intriguing passages
contained within Ibn al-NadTm's entry is a Manichean exposition of Genesis 2-4 which exhibits
numerous affinities with Jewish aggadic and gnostic exegetical traditions" (Reeves, 1999).

The polymathic Shnte scholar and scientist AbO Rayhan al-BirOnT (d.c. 442/1051)
cited and was well aware of the text of the Bible. He evidently had "Arabic translations of the

Old and New Testaments, as well as of other Jewish and Christian writings, at his disposal" (De
Blois, E.Ir. IV: 284). Affirmative of the considerable knowledge of the Bible possessed by al-
BirOnT is al-Athar al-baqiyya tabulation of the divergent chronologies of the Hebrew, Greek
(LX)() and Samaritan versions of the Pentateuch (Chron:XX). As pointed out below (<-4.1) it
was probably his reference to Hindu chronological statements found in the "Record of Yoga[s]"
(SE* "Book of JOk" [sic.]) that led BA* to refer to this matter in his L. Qabl- i adarn (<-3.2).

II Shrism , Ishraqi philosophy and mystical gnosis: Suhrawardi (d. 587/1191) and Ibn
al:ArabT (d. 638/1240).

The mystically oriented Ishraqi philosophy of illuminationism to some extent developed
as a reaction to the philosophical thought of 'All ibn Sin, Avicenna (d. 428/1037), who is also
credited with a number of mystical texts including a Persian Mrraj-nama. The rich and influential
thought of the Shaykh al-lshraq, Shihab al-Din Yatiya SuhrawardT, founder of the Ishraqiyyrin
(the 'Illuminationist school'), at times combines elements of Shi s T theology, Sufi gnosis, Islamic
peripatetic philosophy, Zoroastrian thought and the Hellenistic-Hermetic tradition.

SuhrawardT's philosophy of illumination is expounded in his tiikmat al-lshraq (The
Wisdom of Illumination). Therein the probably Jewish rooted term L_13 j j_4) (often pointed
hurqalya but more likely hawaqalya) is associated with the "eighth clime" and with the cosmic,
supernatural cites of Jabulqa[a] and Jabarsa[sa] (cf. Shaykh Ahmad JK 1/ii, 103). Hurcialya /
hawaqalya is referred to as something dhatal-aja7b ("redolent of wonders", Hikmat,159-60).
In his commentary upon SuhrawardT's 1:likmat al-ishraq, Shams al-Din Muhammad
ShahrazOrT (d. after 687/1288) again associates this term with Jabulqa and Jabarsa.
Commenting upon the "eighth clime" he writes that "..labulqa", "Jabarsa" [spellings vary] and
"Humalya" are "names of cities in the world of the 'Nam al-mithal ("world of similitudes")
adding that Hurcialya is differentiated by being the 'a/am al-aflak al-muthul (The world of the
spheres of the [World of the] similitudes)" (Sh-Hikmat,xxxii; 574, 594-5).

SuhrawardT was apparently the first to use the mystical-cosmological term,' hurqalya
[= havaqalya] as Indicative of a luminous supernatural interworld. It may be a garbled (no letter

lam or 'ayn registered), Arabized transliteration of the biblical Hebrew          Irr_in   (ha-raqra, Gen

1:6f; with the Heb. definite article) meaning "the firmament". In the Hebrew Bible rplri
denotes what lies between the cosmic "waters" and is the locality where God "set" the "sun"
moon and stars (Gen. 1:6-8). Conceptually it is something of a cosmological "interworld"
dividing the cosmic "waters" from the "waters" as well as a source of stunningly bright light. In
Rabbinic texts and Jewish mystical traditions lipn has a close association with the bright light

and with the sun.' The "firmament" is understood to signify a dazzlingly radiant light beaming
cosmic phenomenon, a kind of luminous "interworld" betwixt earth and heaven. The Sepher
ha-Zohar of Moses de Leon (c.1240-1305 CE), several times identifies s.rpn_ saqia) as a
reality of stunning brightness (Zohar 1:15aff). This important Jewish mystical text appropriately
cites Dan 12:3 in asserting that the sntNt (mashkilim, the "wise") "shall shine (yazhiru) like

the brightness of the   srpn (zohar ha-raq1a)" (Berachoth, 1.16aff). In view its cosmological
and other senses   Fpn would not have been inappropriately adopted in an IshraqT cosmology
of light! Hargalya became important in Shaykhi hermeneutics as the future sphere of the
eschatological resurrection "body" though it does not appear to have been directly adopted in
the BabT-Baha'T demythologization of latter day "resurrection" motifs (—> 5.1ff).3

Biblical and Isralliyyat motifs and elements are found within SuhrawardT's fifty or more

Bab.Tal. tiagiga 12b; Bershith 17a, Midrash Rabbah, Gen. VI:6ff              (cf. Samuelson,
1994[7]:118f.). The Bab. Talmud records that the following words were uttered by the Rabbis on parting
from one of their learned associates, "may your eyes be enlightened by the light of the Torah and your
face shine like the brightness of the firmament (Fp-1) (B.Tal. Berachoth 17a).

It may be that the traditional voweling HOrcialya', especially if rooted in biblical Hebrew, could
be regarded as an interesting example of an Isra'illyyah motif. Contrary to the erroneous critiques of
some Islamic anti-Shaykhi writers harcialya is an Ishraqi cosmological term and not invented by Shaykh
Abmad.

Suhrawarrs philosophy of illumination was also influential upon the Jewish convert to Islam Ibn
KammOna (d.c.1285) who cites the Bible frequently in his Tancilli al-thalath. (Perlman,

Arabic and Persian works. Qi;sas al-anbiya' imagery and motifs associated with love and
beauty are creatively expounded with reference to Adam, Joseph the acme ofjamal (Beauty),
Zulaykha and others in Suhrawardi's Persian Treatise on the Reality of Enraptured Love (if
Iyaqiqat al-ishq)(Suhrawardi, lshq, [19991: 58-76).

A Johannine Paraclete reference is present in the 7th section (haykal) of Suhrawardrs
(Arabic) Hayakil al-nor (Temples of Light). Having cited Q. 29:43 and alluded to Matt 13:13,
Suhrawardi refers to the ta'wil (inner sense) and baygn (exposition) of these texts extending
beyond the prophets (al-anbiya)unto that mazhar al-a*zam (mightiest theophany) who is the
al-faraglita, the eschatological Paraclete and supreme expounder (Ar. Hayakil, 88), This
paraclete reference was commented upon by Jalal al-DTn DawwanT (d. 907/1501)(DawwanT,
Shawakil, 215f). He saw the mazhar al-a'zam as the "supreme Light theophany" closely
related to the Spirit-Paraclete which was also identified with the twelfth Imam or MandT (Qa'im)
(Corbin, 1970:39-50; 1971-2b:257; Corbin /SuhrawardT,1970:41f/ 84-108 [Per.]).

Prior to DawwanT, Sayyid Haydar AmulT (d.787/1385) in his influential Are al-asrar
manba . al-anwar (Book of the Compendium of Mysteries and the Source of Lights), had cited
and commented upon a Paraclete saying ascribed to Jesus,

We bring unto you outer revelation (al-tanzil); but, as for the inner revelation
> (al-ta'wil), this the Paraclete (al-fdraqlit) will bring in the latter days (If dkhir al-
> zaman).' The term Paraclete (al-fdraqq) in their [the Christians'] language
> signifies the Mandi [eschatological Messiah].. who will bring the inner exegesis
> (al-ta iwT1) of the Qur'an (AmulT, Jami s §205, I11:5, 103-4).

1-.1aydar Amuli and others after him held that "the coming of thelmam-Paraclete will inaugurate
the reign of the purely spiritual meaning of the divine Revelations -- that is to say, the true
religion which is the eternal walaya" (Corbin, 1993:73). The purely spiritual sense of religion
will be brought by the messiah in the age of the eternal walaya (<-1.3 ( Lambden, 1997:85f).

A century or so after al-Am oil a similar view was expressed by Muhammad b. Zayn
al-Din better known as I bn AbT JumhOr al-IshraciT al-Absa'T (d. late 15th cent.). He was

important for achieving a synthesis of Shi s T scholastic theology, Avicennan philosophy, IshraqT
theosophy and the mysticism of Ibn al- sArabf (d. 638/1240). In his K al-Mullf the Christian al-

faragllt (Paraclete) is identified with the hidden twelfth Imam, the sa1.71b al-zaman (Lord of the
Age), who will bring the ta'wil of sacred scripture (Mujli, 308 cited Corbin. 1970:55). This same
writer's annotated compendium of ShrT traditions, entitled A-wall" al-la'ala quotes several
Islamicate biblically rooted traditions. Among these texts are passages from the Islamicate
(pseudo-HB) tawrat (Torah) which begins "0 son of Adam!" and calls humankind to the fear
of the Lord and the honouring of parents ('Awali,1:270, cf. 3:536; 4:78). Another quotation
from the Muslim, Islamicate Bible is a version of the Johannine paraclete promise as relayed
from Muhammad alleging that , "Jesus said, 'We bring you the outer revelation (al-tanzTI) but
as for al-ta'w11 (the inner revelation) it will come with al-Faraglit (the Paraclete) at the end of
the age Whir al-zamanpAwali, 4:124). Expectation of an eschatological Paraclete identified
with the twelfth Imam, MandT-Qa'im became an integral part of      shn messianism. It was also
taken up and developed in Baha'T biblical exegesis (Corbin 1970; Lambden 1997).
• MutlyT al-Din Ibn al-'Arabi (d. 638/1240) and his ShT'T followers.

Perhaps the greatest mystical philosopher of Islam, Ibn al-'Arabi wrote several hundred
works many of which were deeply studied by influential ShrT mystics and philosophers. His role
was especially great in the realm of Iranian Shi sT spirituality, gnosis and mysticism. Despite
concerns over the monistic underpinning of the wandat al-wujad ("existential oneness")
inclined mysticism of some of his devotees, this did not repel those enchanted by the
labyrinthine magnitude of his mystically and intellectually challenging thought (Knysh, 1999,
Sells, 1994).

A number of the works of I bn al-'ArabT compile, draw upon or interpret Isra'iliyat rooted
quranic verses, traditions and extra-quranic revelations (hadrth qudsT). His Muhadarat al-
abrar (Conference of the Pious and the Conversations of the Perfect) is largely made up of
Isra'TITyAt and related traditions, especially q/Sas al-anbiya' episodes and "chronicles of times
gone by, the lives of the Ancients and of the Prophets, the history of kings both Arab and non-
Arab" (Mutiadarat, 1:2, trans. Addas,1993:100). Within this text are found a number of Sufi type
sayings of Jesus which have little gospel precedent (Muhadarat, 2:2, 30, 253).

Ibn al :ArabT doubtless knew the Jewish / Christian Bible but avoided citing it as part
of his Islamic mystical universe of discourse. Biblical quotations are absent in many (if not most/
all?) of his key writings. It is likely that he saw the Q. as the locus of all past sacred books
including the tawrat and Injll. His mystic quest early on led him to encounter and claim direct
advice from the celestial Jesus, with whom, as the "seal of the saints" (khatm al-awliya), he had
a deep though Islamocentric relationship (Gryphon,1999:593f). In his Futatiatal-makiyya Ibn
al-'Arabi writes: "He [Jesus] is my first master on the Way; it is in his hands that I was
converted. He [Jesus] watches over me [1bn al-'Arabi] at all hours, not leaving me for even a
second.. 1 often met him in my visions" (Futuhat 111:341; 11:49 tr. Addas 2000:25-6).

1bn al: Arabi's mystical intercourse with the celestial Jesus perhaps made citation of
the concrete pre-quranic Christian NT/ Bible relatively meaningless. His mysticism of the
sacred and archetypal Kitab (Book) embraced many levels including that of the Perfect Man al-
insan al-kamll This all but made the citation of pre-Islamic scripture irrelevant (a1-171 akim,
Musjam, 939ff). For the Great Shaykh words indicative of scripture can have meanings other
than the obvious. Al-kitab al-jaml ("the Comprehensive Book) can mean Adam "who gathers
into his essence all the differentiated realities of the world (Futuhat,I1:67). For Ibn al : ArabT the
terms tawrah and 'WI may indicate modes of al-kllab (the Book) or other realities and
conditions of being.

A mystic totally unlike the literalistic, anti-biblical Ibn Hazm, I bn 'ArabT's need to cite or
consult existing biblical texts was probably negated before the scintillating "Logos-Light" of the
Prophet, the al-nür al-mutommadiyya and the Q. not to mention his constant mystical
nearness to Jesus, the fountainhead of the Injfi. Ibn al: ArabT quite frequently cited divinely
revealed verses from the heritage of Sufi generated Jesus sayings or from quasi-biblical
tawrat and inill versions though he appears to have completely (?) bypassed citation from
existing Islamic Arabic, Jewish or Christian versions of the Bible.

An example of 1bn al-'ArabT's quotation of the non-canonical, conflated, rewritten,
Islamized "biblical" text is the following tawrat citation found in his K al-falai waY-jamal (Book

of the Divine Majesty and Beauty). Commenting upon Q. 51:56, Ibn al'Arabi quotes this extra-
quranic revelation (hadIth qudsf) allegedly contained in "His [God's] Torah" (tawrat),"
Allusion (al-Ishara): If you desire to comprehend the parameters of gnosis

(hadd al-ma'rifa)...in this verse then gaze upon what He [God] has created for
> your sake., within yourself.. And if you are unable to accomplish this., then
> realize it by means of what God.., revealed in His Torah" (tawrat), "0 Son of
> Adam. I created everything (al-ashya) for thy sake and I created thee for my
> sake. So do not subjugate what I created for my sake to that which I created for
> thine own sake (Affifi, Rasa'//, 15). 1

Begun in Mecca in 598/1201 Ibn al- s Arabi's massive (560 chapter) theosophical
compendium al-Futahat al-makkiyya ('The Meccan Inspirations', 2,500+ pp.) contains many
mystical interpretations of both quCanic and post-quranic prophetology and Isra'rliyyat
influenced traditions. Despite its vastness the Futohat does not include canonical biblical
citations. The dozen occurrence of tawrat and the around half that number of ITV do not
introduce biblical or even pseudo-biblical quotations. As in the Muhadarat(<--) there are quite
a few Sufi type Jesus sayings, utterances of al-masfh (the messiah) in the FutOhat (1:368-9;
1:652; Ill: IV:633).

Among the most influential and important oflbn 'Arabi's later works is his relatively brief
(around 200 pp.) yet very influential Fusüs al-hikam ("Ringstones of Wisdom", 627/1230). Its
author claimed that each of its twenty- seven chapters were given to him in a vision of
Muhammad. Each "bezel" revolved around one of the aforementioned 27 prophets (cf.<-1.2)
who enshrine a particular divine attribute, mode (maqam) or wisdom central to engagement
with the divine (Chittick, Elr. VII:665; lzutsu, Enc.Rel. V:554). Relative to possible biblical
influence section six, the Isaac bezel, 1:11kmat haqTqat fr kalirnat 'Ishaqiyya (The Wisdom of
Reality in the Word of Isaac) may show biblical influence in that Isaac and not the (usual)

•
Islamic Ishmael is the one made ready for sacrifice (Fusus, 84f/tr.981).
In excess of one hundred Arabic and Persian commentaries have been written upon

Such non-canonical citations from pre-Islamic prophets can also, for example, be found in the
K al-lsra' (Book of the Night Ascent) and the K al-tajilliyat (Book of the Epiphanies) of Ibn al-'ArabT.

the Fusus. Especially influential were the commentaries of Mu'ayyad al-Din Jandi (d.c. 700
/1300) and Muhammad Dawod Qaysari (d.672 /1274). QaysarT cites John 14:28 as an
utterance of Jesus, the "revealer of divine secrets, the seal of the universal sainthood" in his
Shady fuses al-hlkam (so Margoliouth ERE 9: 482). Commenting upon nubuww/yya
(prophethood) in the kallmat 7sawlyya, in the same work Qaysari expounds the various
significances of nubuwwa khassa and nubuwwa 'amma as used by Ibn al-'Arabi (<-1.3
QaysarT, Sh.Fusus, 843).

Ibn al-'Arabi himself wrote a summary exposition of the essential ideas of the Fusu,s
entitled Naqsh al-fuses.. (The Imprint of the Ringstones; HIP 1:516) which also came to be
much commented upon in both Arabic and Persian. The Persian commentary of the poet and
mystic 'Abd al-Rahman JamT (d. 898 /1492) was very influential. It was the Great Shaykh's
disciple and stepson Sadr al-Din al-Q p nawi (d.673 /1274-5) through whom Ibn 'Arabi's
teachings "reached the Persian speaking world" (Chittick, ibid 666). He also commented upon
the prophetogical-theosophical chapter headings of the Fuses in his K Fakk al-fukek ("The
Unsealing of the Constituents").

Biblical-queanic prophet figures are given multi-faceted interpretations by I bn al-'Arabi
and by many of the representatives of his "school". They had a wide-ranging influence on ways
of non-literally interpreting prophetological motifs. Joseph, son of Jacob, for example, is often
associated with that bright luminosity which is the Logos of Light and Beauty (lbn 'Arabi,
Fuses, 99-106; Naqsh [trans. Chittick] 58). For al-Q p nawi the Fusas brought the
quintessence of the dhawq (mystical "tasting") of the prophetological gnosis of God (al-Fukek,
184 tr. Chittick in HIP 1:515). The influence of this mystical prophetology is evident in some of
the ifranT (esoteric) propbetological statements found in Babi-Baha'T scripture (BA*, INBA 56).

The Bab and the first two architects of Shaykhism (-->6.1f) occasionally cited Ibn al-

'ArabT. 1 The Bab held back though from the affirming anything associated with pantheistic
monism (wandat al-wujad) or hula! ("incarnation"), preferring and frequently underlining a
strictly apophatic theology (Lambden, 1997:54ff). Critically commenting, for example, on the
concepts of basil al-haqTqa ("undifferentiated reality") and wandat al-wujod in his R.
Dhahabiyya the Bab wrote that, "All of this is unadulterated heresy ('idolatry'; shirk mahad)
in the estimation of family of God " (INBMC 86:96-7). 2 Despite this critique there is little doubt
that the vocabulary and certain doctrinal dimensions of the Bab's teachings echo the gnosis of
Ibn al-'Arabi. The 7Im al-hurof aspect of Ibn al : ArabT's esoteric jafr (gematric prognosis and
numerology) as set forth towards the beginning of his al-Futahat and in other writings, directly
or indirectly influenced the Bab when he set down dimensions of his talismanic cosmology,
prophetology and gnosis.3

Though they differ in a good many doctrinal respects it is clearly the case that various
writings of both the Bab and BA* show the influence of the theosophical Sufism of Ibn al-Arabi
and members of his "school" including, for example, Daw0d QaysarT (<--), Sayyid 171 aydar
AmulT (d. 787/1385 ) and • Abd al-Karim al-Jill (d. 832/1428). The style and vocabulary of the
Bab's R. Dhahabiyya and the L-ljurafat al-muqatt 'a of BA* are at times affirmative of a very
close direct and/ or indirect relationship to the mystical gnosis of I bn al-'Arabi.

5.3 The Bible and Isra'Tliyyat: the 'School of Isfahan' and the Safavid period.

A vast array of texts and literatures relating in one way or another to the Bible and

While Shaykh Ahmed, for eample, commented upon Ibn al-'Arabi and the science of jafr in one
of his epistles (JK1/2:86f), Sayyid Kazim cited the FutOhat in writing about the elevated status of
Muhammad in his Sh.Qasida (unpaginated ).

Though the Fusus of the Great Shaykh was one of the few works which the Bab specifically
cited ("Mutlyi al-Din in his Fu,sus mentions" ,T.'Asr. 99-100) he is very dismissive of the wandatal-wujod
(existential oneness) associated with Ibn al:ArabT.

3Positive aspects of the shakl al-tathlith (" the form of threefolnesss") are quite frequently
mentioned by the Bab. In this one is reminded of Ibn al : ArabT's doctrine of the "third entity" in such
writings as his Insh,l'al-daw.l'ir (The Genesis of the Circles). There the Great Shaykh elaborates al-shay'
al-thalith (the third entity) which, as a cosmological principle, is centered upon the relationship between
God and man (lbn 'Arabi, lnsha, cf. Takeshita, 1982:2431-260).

Isralliyat traditions date to the Safavid and Qajar periods. This is particularly true of the irfanT
literatures of the so-called 'School of Isfahan' which flourished during the earlier Safavid period.
The later Shis T encounter with the Abrahamic and related religions in Iran, Iraq and elsewhere
caused some Arab and Persian writers to examine the scriptures and traditions of Judaism and
Christianity. In this section a few of the Shil writers of these periods who cited the Bible and
dwelt upon Isra'Tliyyat traditions will be mentioned.
II Muhammad Baciir AstarabAdi (d.1041/1641), Mir Darnad.

Mir Damad styled himself "Ishraq" after Suhrawardi and was known as the "Third
Master" succeeding Aristotle and al-Farabi. A central, foundational figure of the philosophical-
theological 'School of Isfahan' his often complex, frequently gnostically oriented Persian and
Arabic works include materials of central interest. His Persian treatise al-Jadhawat
("Particles of Fire"), for example, responds to an Indian scholars' enquiry as to why Moses was
not consumed by the Sinaitic fire attendant upon the divine theophany (tajalli). In addition to
the cosmological-theophanological implications of Moses' experience of the divine, this multi-
faceted work also contains interpretations of the qur'anic al-hurufat al- muqatta'a (isolated
letters). Interesting reference is made in the sixth firebrand of al-Jadhawat to the sphere of

Hawaqalya / Hargalya (<--loosely, "interworld"), a term which (5.2 <--as noted)
probably has (Judaic-) lshraqi roots and became important in Shaykhi cosmological gnosis

This interworld named FlOmalya (= Havaqalya) is important in connection with the
Shaykhi view of the sphere of the hidden Imam and the "earth" of the realm of supra-bodily,

spiritual, resurrection. In all likelihood this is an item of Isra'Tliyyat in the sense of its being
rooted in cosmologically suggestive biblical Hebrew terminology interpreted in Rabbinic and
mystical Judaism as a scintillant realm of celestial light (-->6.1f).

II Bah' al-Din al 2 Amili (d.Isfahan c.1031 /1622)

A contemporary and friend of MTr Damad, the erudite, polymathic and prolific (in both
Arabic and Persian) Baha' al-Din al: Amin- (= Shaykh Baha1 1 ) was by some considered the
mujaddid ( "Renewer") of the 11th century (Qummi, Kunya, 2:100). Widely travelled through
Syria, Anatolia, Egypt and elsewhere, al-Amili must have interacted with middle-eastern Jewish
and Christian communities in these places as well as within Lebanon where he was born and
in Iran his adopted homeland.

Shaykh Bahl was revered and at home in both the Ottoman SunnT and Safavid Shisi
worlds of his day. He had Sufi ascetical and mystical proclivities. There is little doubt that he
had positive interactions with Jews and Christians and a considerable knowledge of their
scriptures and traditions (Moreen, 1987:129f; Bosworth, 1989:52f). His short Risala ft dhaba71.7
ahl al-kitab, a treatise prohibiting the consumption of meat slaughtered by the ahl al-kitab.
does not refer to the Bible but illustrates AmilT's wide knowledge of ShI s T traditions and of
Jewish and Christian practises ( cf. BabranT, Lu'lu'at, 21; Kohlberg, Elie. 3:429).

Shaykh Bahl is best known for his literary anthology Kashkal (Begging Bowl). That
this compilation includes Islamicate Bible citations had been noted long ago by Goldziher
(1878:385-6). More than a century later in his Baba' al-Din a/41mill and his literary anthologies
(1989), Bosworth observed that al-AmilT shows a "good acquaintance with the Judaic
background of Islamic civilization" as evidenced in his reasonably accurate listing of the books
of the Hebrew Bible and occasional citations therefrom ( Torah/Hebrew Bible, e.g. Prov. 14:11;

The designation of Mulla Muhammad Husayn, Baha' al-Din as Shaykh Baha'T seems to be
based upon the (common) epithet, Baha' al-Din (Splendour of Religion) and has nothing to do with his
being a kind of proto-Baha'T or 'timeless' follower of BA*.

Bosworth 1989:32f). Like many other Safavid scholars Shaykh Baha'T cited a number of Islamo-
biblical passages. In his Kashla71 there exist passages allegedly rooted in the tawrat including
around seven ihadith qudsT mostly addressed to humanity as the "Son of Adam [Man]" ( ya
ibn adam). A few examples,

> From the Tawrat ("Torah"):
> Whoso is not content with My decree, is impatient over My [sending] calamity
> and lacking in thankfulness for My providence shall assuredly be taken away
> by a lord aside from Me (rabb an sawar);from being one most radiant (asbah)
> [that one shall be] one that weepeth over the world...
> 0 Son of Man! There is never a new day save He [God] betoweth upon thee a
> measure of thy providence and there is never a new night save there is brought
> by the angels before me some [news of] thy repugnant action. My good unto
> thee descends while thy evil ascends unto Me.
> 0 Moses! Whoso loveth me shall never forget me and whoso is hopeful of my
> knowledge shall urgently beseech in questioning me ...
(Kashkul, 2:318; cf. Goldziher 1878:385-6).

Possibly reflecting Shaykh BahaTs own smattering of Hebrew (?) there exists a
passage in the Kashla71 cited as being min al-tawrah ("From the Torah"). It consists of an
Arabic transliteration of the Hebrew letters of Gen.17:20, a verse which mentions Ishmael's
begetting Cktin. 123)-V# = (Per.[AmTIT]) duvazdih-1 surcir ("twelve princes") evidently
understood by Shaykh Baha'T (as by other twelver Shris) to be a prophecy of the twelver
Imams in connection with (Heb.) 17114        (= Per. [Amili]) ummat-I 'azimi, the "great nation"
of Islam (Ishmael being a prototype of Muhammad) (Kashkul, 3:473; cf. Bosworth 1989:15, 52f).
Statements of Jesus and Mary are also found in the Kashkül with a discussion on the three
aqanim (divine hypostases) and a list of the Christian sects, the Melkites ('Orthodox')
Jacobites/ Monophysites and Nestorians (Bosworth, 1989:53).

Another literary anthology of Shaykh Baha'T earlier than the Kashkal is entitled Mildilat
(Nose-Bag ). Urwah b. al-Zubayr (d. c. 91/ 709) is therein cited as having said, "It is written in
the Wisdom: 'My son let thy word be good and thy face cheerful; thou shalt be beloved by men
more than one who gives them a gift". This reflects Ecclesiasticus 18:16-17 and 35:9. In the
Mikblat Malik b. Dinar (d. c. 125/742) is also cited as having stated "It is written in the

Wisdom: it is forbidden to every heart that loves money to speak the truth". This again echoes
Eccles. 26:29-27:1. (Margoliouth 1915:404-7).

Among Shaykh Baha'T's further works of interest is his MathnavT poem, Dar rumOz- /
ism-1 a'4am ("On the mysteries of the Mightiest Name") which contains some interesting
prophetological motifs. It is the ism-1 a'4am which is the Mightiest Name through a partn7
("sunburst") of which Moses experienced the luminous Sinaitic theophany. This
theophanological concept is also found in the writings of the Bab and developed in the light of
an esoteric interpretation of Exod. 3:13 and 6:3f by BA* (B* INBA 6003C:173-188; BA* Ma'idih
4:38-41, tr. Lambden 1986: 37-40; idem., 1988:104ff +169, fn.115). It was by reciting this
miraculous all-powerful Name that Jesus resurrected the dead and himself rose from the dead.
For Shaykh Bahl the ism-/ a'4am enshrines the kunCa-1 asma ("treasures of the Divine
Names") ( RurnOz, 94)..

Isra'iliyyat rooted motifs understood numerologically are registered in al-Amili's
Khulasatal-hIsab ("Summary of Arithmetics"). Rooted in neo-Pythagorean "gnosis" is the fact
that the sum of the integers until 9 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) is 45 which is also the abjad
numerical value of the name Adam (' = 1 +D=4 +M=40 = 45). It is also the case that the sum of
the integers until 5 (1+2+3+4+5) yields 15, the abjad numerical value of the name Eve (Ar.
Flawa = Eve = 8+6+1= 15). The quranic detached letters T (= TA'= 9) and H (= Ha' = 5)
prefixed to Q. 20 yield (abjad) 9 and 5 respectively which also multiply to give 45, the number
of Adam. The two numbers 9 and 5 are also the sides of the rectangle 45, Eve, being 5 as its
left side, the "rib" of "Adam" (Khulasat, 171-4; Bausani, 1981:25).

To some degree indebted to Shaykh Bahal, Shaykh Ahmed and the Bab, in a letter
to a French (?) enquirer about the ism-1 a'4am (Mightiest Name of God) on the Baha'T
ringstone symbol, AB* pointed out that the summation of the integers till 5 indicates the Bab
who corresponds to Eve (= Bab = 2+1+2 = 5= 15 = Eve) and until 9 indicates BA*, the lops
and personification of the al-ism al-a'4am as bah,l' (lit. "Splendour"; abjad= 2+5 +1+1= 9
= 45 = Adam) which corresponds to Adam. For AB* the Bab and BA* were thus primogenitors

of a new humanity in the Bab-Baha'T era (AB* Ma'idih, 2:101-3 B*., R. NubuwwaK.14:335f;-->
III Sadra al-Din ShTrazT, MuIla Sadra ( d.1050/1640)

Within certain of his works the important ShT'Tte philosopher Mull a Sadra commented
upon Isra'Tliyyat materials and cited an Islamicate Bible. In his important Sharp al-usul al-kafT,1
for example, he quotes the whole range of pre-Islamic scripture in commenting upon the
following saying of the fourth Imam, 'All Zayn al-Abidin (d. c. 96/713) in the form of a hactith
qudsT relayed from the prophet Daniel:

> 'If the people knew what was involved in the search after knowledge (al-71m)
> they would assuredly seek it even though it involved the shedding of one's life-
> blood or plunging down into the abyss.'Thus did God inspire Daniel with the
> words; 'Abhor my servant the ignorance of such as look despairingly upon the
> truth of the custodians of knowledge (bi-haqq ahl al-71m); denounce mere
> imitation of others. The most beloved of my servants are such as incline towards
> the fear of God (al-taqwa), those who seek after an abundance of merit before
> the learned rulama), subordinate to the wise (al-hukama) who speak out
> wisdom' (al-hukama)(Sh-Kafi, 3:86).

After quoting a saying taught to Alexander the Great and some advice which Luqman
bequeathed to his son, Mulla Sadra makes the following highly ecumenical statement, "Know
that the rest of the books of God (kutub Allah)are [also] articulate the grace of wisdom ( natiq
b/-facll al-71m). He next cites a saying from the Islamicate (pseudo-) tawrat:

> With respect to the Torah he [God] said to Moses, "Magnify wisdom (al-hikmat)
> for I shall not place wisdom in the heart of any servant unless he desire that I
> forgive him. So teach it and act in accordance therewith... (Sh-Kafi, 3:99).

Mulla 8adra then cites the Zabür (Psalter), introduced in the following way,

> And as for the Zabar, God (exalted be He), said [therein], s 0 David! Say unto
> the learned [Rabbis] (ahbar)of the children of Israel and their monks (ruhban):
> 'Speak of such people as are God-fearing (al-atqiya). And if you do not find
> among them the fear of God (taqTy a n) then converse with the learned ones
> rulama). And if you do not find it with them, converse with the wise(al-Vgala).
> The fear of God (al-taqa), knowledge (a1-71m) and wisdom (aVaql) are three
> realities which exhibit a degree of oneness such that if but one of them is not          i

l At times this work is reminiscent of Ibn Qutayba's Kra'wil mukhtalif al-hadith (Disputed
Traditions <-3.1) which cites the Bible in attempting legitimate Islamic traditions (Adang 1996:4-5).

> found in any one of My creatures I have desired his destruction (Sh-Kafi, 3:99-
After commenting upon this Zabür citation Mull Sadra writes, "As for the Injll
(Gospel[s]), He -- exalted be He [God] -- says in the seventh sera [of ?]:

> Woe unto whomsoever heard knowledge (al- 7/m)yet failed to seek after it! Such
> are fit to be gathered up with the ignorant for [casting into] hellfire (al-nar). So
> seek ye knowledge and instruct therein! Knowledge, if it does not delight you it
> will not oppress you. And if it does not elevate you it will not put you down. If it
> does not make you independent it will not impoverish you. If it does not benefit
> you it will not injure you. God will say on the Day of Resurrection, '0 concourse
> of the learned (' ulama')! What is your opinion regarding your Lord? And they will
> reply, 'We suppose that Thou art merciful towards us and forgiving towards us'.
> Then he [God] will say, 'I have assuredly taken such action. I have indeed
> entrusted you with My wisdom (hikmati) . This I did not do to accomplish some
> evil. Nay rather, I desired it for good to be established among you. So enter
> then into peace, into My Paradise through My Mercy (Sh-Kafi, 3:100).

After this Islamicate InjTI citation Mulla Sadra quotes another pasage from the TafsTr of
Muqatil b. Sulayman (<--2.1);

> Muqatil said, 'I found in the Injr1 that God -- exalted be He-- said to Jesus,
> 'Magnify the learned ('ulama) and be aware of their bounty (fad!). I have
> bestowed grace upon them above all my creatures except the prophets (al-
> nablyyTn)and the messengers (mursalin). This even as the bounty of the sun
> above the stars, the bounty of the hereafter above this mortal world and even
> as My Bounty above everything else (Sh-Kafi, 3:100).
> Finally, mum Sadra cites a highly Shri statement from Jesus:
> Out of the community of Muhammad -- upon him and his family be peace -- are
> the 'ularna'(the learned), hukatna- (the wise, philosophers). In view of (their)
> [legal] comprehension (al-fiqh) they are even as prophets (anbiya). They will
> be made content by God with but little providence (al-rizq) and God will be
> satisfied with them through a mere token of [their] action. They will assuredly
> enter Paradise Canna° through 'There is no God but God' (b/-la ilaha ilia Allah)
> (Sh-Kafi, 3:100).

This citation from mum Badra from Muqatil is a good example of how a much older
> pseudo-biblical citation cati appear in a highly respected source of the mid 17th cent. CE. It is
> followed by Islamicate pseudo-biblical texts which obviously says more about mum Sadra than
anything Jesus might have uttered.

• Sayyid A/mad b. Zayn al-Àbidin al- Mawr (d.c. 1050/1650).

An Isfatani first cousin, son-in-law and student of Mir              Damad,    Sayyid Ahmad (d. c.

1050/1650) was a major philosopher, theologian and polemicist. Equally an Avicennan
peripatetic (mashshaVn) and an Ishraqi Platonist (Ishraqiyan), Sayyid Ahmed was also
especially expert in the Abrahamic religions having made a detailed study of the scriptures of
the pre-Islamic ahl al-kitab. According to Corbin, Sayyid Ahmed had a "perfect knowledge of
Hebrew", frequently cited the HB in Arabic characters and was able to translate the text word
for word into Persian (Corbin, 1985/ Eir.1:645). Giving precedence to quranic scripture in the
light of Shi'i hermeneutical and doctrinal norms, Sayyid Ahmed wrote four Persian volumes
in dialogue with Jews, Christians and their sacred scriptures:

> • Lataif-1 ghaybi (Subtleties of the Unseen realm), some hermeneutical
> preliminaries.
> • Saw.g 7q-1 ratiman (The Thunderbolts of the All-Merciful). A disputation with
> Judaism and the Torah (HB).
> • K Lavamr-I rabbanT t 7 radd al-shubba al-na,sraniyya (The Lordly Brilliancies
> in refutation of Christian misconceptions,1031/1622). A confrontation with
> Christianity, an affirmation of biblical tatirif and an attempt to prove the
> superiority of Islam.

> • gsqa1-1.safa dar tajliya va tagiya-y/ a'ina-yi haqq-nama dar radd-I madhab-
> I nagra (The Polisher of purity to burnish and make clear the mirror showing
> the truth in refutation of the Christian faction'; 1032/1622).

This fourth work was a response to the Ayina-yi Ogg nama ("The Mirror showing the
Truth", 1609) by the Portugese Jesuit missionary Girolamo (Jerome) Xavier (d. 1617). 1 Not the
only Safavid s kim to respond to Xavier (Lee, 1824:cxiiiff; Hairi, 1993:155), Sayyid Ahmed
apparently wrote this work after a "dream-vision" of the twelfth Imam as a supplement to the
Lavaml (<--). Therein he referred to Xavier's volume as kalam br-farjam ("useless discourse")
(Hairi, 1993:156). Responses to Sayyid Ahmad's polemic were written by Phillipus

'Xavier was also the author of a Persian life of Christ based on the Gospels entitled Mir'atal-qads
(The Mirror of Sanctity) and also referred to as   Dastg—I Masfly   as wellas a life of the Apostles,   Dasta—I
Atiwal4 Hawariyyän.

Guadagnolus and the Italian Pietro Della Valle ( d.1652) who had met Mir Damad (<--) in
Isfahan and presented him with his own Persian Risala (Ellis, BMCat. 1:col. 592; Rossi,
1948:32ff; Gurney, 1986)

Within the works listed above s Alawi makes considerable us of the messianic, Islam°.

biblical Paraclete (faraqlit) motif as found in various Johannine texts. Like others before him
he related this figure to the messianic twelfth Imam and knew a "twofold manifestation of the
Paraclete" in the persons of Muhammad and the eschatological Twelfth Imam (Corbin,
1976:232f; 1985 [Elr.] 1:644f). 1 On the basis of his direct reading of John 14:26 towards the
beginning of the Lawarnr-yi rabbani he identified the Faraqlif (Paraclete) with the roh al-
quds ("Holy Spirit") who will come bi -nam —Thad' ("in My name") and teach jamr chiz-ha ("all
things" Jn. 14:26a) (Lawami s , 3-4; 15a-b,102; cf. Lee, 1824:xliff).

The Lavamr includes some details regarding biblical predictions of name Muhammad.

Sayyid Ahmad cites an Arabic phrase from one of the Psalms (mazmOr az mazamir) which
is actually a loose, rewritten Arabic version of Psalm 50:1b (Heb.)          ripin ar.f L, 1.4   V-L,L,pp

1n    which ( in the literalistic RSV translation reads) "Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
God shines forth". The Arabic version cited by 'Alawi (identical with that cited in the K Din wa 7-
dawla, of al-Tabari) reads (translated in the light of the intended meaning),

God manifested from Zion (min sihyOn) a praiseworthy (mahmüdan ) crown ("kill
an •c-.

( t the   root of the Heb 177;7).2

The interpretation of Sayyid Ahmad reads, "It is evident that Zion indicates the name Mecca
and mahmOd ("praiseworthy") the patronymic (kunya) of Muhammad as one crowned (iklil).

Qutb al-Din AshkivarT (d. c. 1075/1664-5) not only identified the Paraclete with the twelfth Im6m
but also with Astvat Ereta (Av. "He who embodies righteousness", see Yasna 43:3) who is the Saoshyant
("Future Benefactor"), the ultimate eschatological saviour of Zoroastrianism {Corbin, 1971:56f; 1976:232).

The quotation is translated in the light of the sense given the phrase by Sayyid Ah mad who is
very likely directly or indirectly drawing on the K Al-din wa'l-dawla (Book of Religion and Empire) of 'Ali
b. Rabban al-TabarT (d.c.2511865). The latter quotes this phrase from the beginning of Psalm 50 as a
prophecy of Muhammad. His Arabic translation is identical (DDawla140; tr. Mingana 89).

Here is struck a similitude of rulership and imamate" (Lawami',14b). Other titles of Muhammad
in biblical prophecy are elsewhere set down by Sayyid Ah mad including his Tawrat (Toraic)
"name" /Woo' M e od (actually the adverbial phrase "exceedingly" in Gen. 17:20b AV & RSV)
interpreted in Persian as meaning "Great, Great" (Per. buzurg buzurg). Despite, or in view
of his linguistic awareness, Sayyid Ahmad upheld a form of biblical tang! ("corruption")
(Lavami' / Lee 1824:IXvff).
• Muhammad Sa'Td Sarmad (executed Moghul India, 1072/1661) and the Dabistan.

The person and poetry of Muhammad Sa s id Sarmad, a Persian (KashanT) Jewish
convert to Sufism who went around naked after the example of the prophet Isaiah (Dabistan,
1:215-6; cf. Gen. 2:25 [3:7, 21]) are highly regarded examples of Persian poetry. Sarmad is an
interesting link between Safavid-Moghul mystico-religions culture, Shi s i Islam, Hinduism and
Rabbinic Judaism. In the Dabistan—I madhahtb (The School of Religious Doctrines) it is said
that on converting from Judaism to Islam he acquainted himself with the thought of Mull a Sadra
and MTr 'AbO'l Qasim FindiriskT (d. 1050/1641). He subsequently became "one of the
outstanding masters of the Persian quatrain" (Schimmel, 1978:362) and "for the sake of
commerce" (ayyT-1 tullära) took a sea voyage to India. Whilst at Thatta he became enraptured
with a Hindu boy named Abhai Chand rash/q-1 abhai [= Abi] chand hindrt-I pisari) who
became his ardent disciple. With Sarmad's assistance Abhai Chand fairly literally translated
Genesis 1-6 from Hebrew into Persian. Headed by the basmalah and referred to as the 'Book
of Adam' in the Dabistan, it concludes the section about the 'Doctrines of the Jews' (Per.
vol.1:218-233 tr. Shea and Troyer 1901:303).       2

Cf. Bihar2 15:208f1. The Hebrew me od basically means "power", "strength", "force". Many Islamic
writers register this as a "name" of Muhammad in the Torah. It probably became a "prophecy" in
connection with an Is hmael-Muhammad ty pology. The numerical (abjad) value of "exceedingly"
(2+40+1+4+40+1+4 = 92), it was observed, is the equivalent of Muhammad (40+8+40+4 = 92). Such use
of numerological (abjad) equivalents is common in both Shis i and Babi religious literatures.

Omitting the basma/ah, the Hebrew of Genesis 1:1 Beres& bara 'elohrm et-ha-shamayim va
et-ha'areL' ("[When] In the Beginning God created the heavens and the earth"), can be compared with
the Persian of Abi Chand which reads, Dar awwal afrfnish afrfd khuda mar asma—rã va mar zamr—rã.
Rahim Ridazada Malik the editor and annotator the the recent 2 vol edition of the Dabistan, highlights the
importance of this Abi Chand's translation (Dabistan 2:207f).

An important text of the Adhar Kayvani pseudo-Zoroastrian faction, the Dabistan—/
madhalyb ("The School of Religious Doctrines") may have been authored during the decade
prior to 1068/1658 by Mir Dhu'l-Figar Ardistani (E.Ir.V1:532-4). Published in Calcutta
(1224/1809) Tehran (1260/1844) and Bombay 1264/1848 (also 1267/1851) in the 19th century,
this work became an important source of information about world religions in Persia, the Middle
East and elsewhere (Rieu, Cat. 1:141-2). Whilst In Shiraz in 1825 Wolff listed the Dabistan
among twenty-two Persian and seven Arabic" authors "most read by the learned Muslims of
Shiraz" (MJ I11:53-4). The Dabistan contains, twelve main sections (talfm, lit. 'teachings')
dealing with ParsTs (Zoroastrians), Hindus, Tibetans, Jews, Christians, Muslims, Sadiqiyya,
Wahidiyya, Roshaniyyan, Ilahiyya, Philosophers and Sufis. Numerous other religious and
philosophical subgroups are also mentioned. By modern standards the Dab/Stan contains,
numerous "errors". There are a few hints of its influence upon Babi-Bahal primary sources
though this possible source of influence is minimal and outside the scope of this thesis. The
Bab, BA* and AB* probably knew and occasionally drew upon this unusual Persian work.'
• Sayyid Muhammad Mandi Tabatatal, Bahr al- s ulam (d.1212/1797)

Brief mention of a cordial munagara (debate) between the influential Shri mujtahid
Bahr al-'ulüm ("The Ocean of the Sciences") and representatives of a small Jewish group of
Dhu'l-Kifl ( 20 miles south of Hilla, Iraq) must conclude this highly selective overview of aspects
of the Bible and Isra'iliyyat on the eve of the Qajar period. In was in 1796 that the
aforementioned Shri mujtahid, famous for his great polemical skills and ability in converting
Jews (Algar, E.1r.111:504), held debate with a few Jews or Jewish leaders named Da'od (David)
and 'Azra (Ezra). This possibly historical debate (?) is recorded on the basis of original
documents (?) in introductory sections of various editions of the Rija I al-Sayyk i Bahr aVulüm
(Rija1149] 50-66; Moreen 1999).
It appears that Bahr al-'UlOm had a very considerable knowledge of Muslim polemical

and Ihtij'a-j literatures touching upon the Bible and Judaism although he appears to have lacked
any direct knowledge of either the HB or the (to him) "reprehensible" Rabbinic literatures
(Moreen 1999:575-6). His quoting paraphrases of biblical texts such as 1 Kings 11-12 and
Exodus 32:1f most likely derived from his mastery of such Islamic sources as I bn BabOya (4.2
<-- Karnal al-din, cf. Vajda, 1941-5: 131f) and earlier Sunni and Shis i polemicists. Like Sayyid
Ahrnad he upheld biblical tahrif ("corruption") at one point in this debate refers to al-tahrif
wal-ziyada ("corruption and addition") (Bible) (Rijal: tr. Moreen 1999:583). His influence can
be seen by the fact that several of his pupils engaged in the debate with Henry Martyn (-->).
II 5.4 Bible translation and dialogue up to the early Qajar period

The following notes must suffice to illustrate the availability of Persian and Arabic Bible
translations up until the early Qajar period along with a few details of those who were involved
in the early 19th century Shi s i dialogue with western missionaries. It was during the Safavid era
(1501-1722) that biblical translation and knowledge of the Abrahamic religions became better
established, at least among certain of the learned and literate ruling class. The 19th century
missionary engagement with Islam and the distribution of many Persian and Arabic Bible
translations increased biblical awareness among Shi s i Muslims.'

According to Patristic testimony partial or complete (Middle) Persian Bible translation
was accomplished in pre-Islamic times (Chrysostom Homily on John PG LIX col. 32). Very
much later, from the 11th cent. CE., partial, then complete biblical translations into New
Persian from the original Hebrew and Greek or indirectly from Syriac or other languages,
began to appear (Elr IV:199-214; esp. 203-4). During the 14th-16th centuries CE important
New Persian and Judaeo-Persian translations of biblical books were made.

A Persian translation of the Pentateuch was made by Joseph b. Moses in 719/1319,
then another Judaeo-Persian Pentateuch translation dating to 952-3/1546 by Jacob ben

Joseph Tawos, a Persian professor at the Jewish Academy at Constantinople. This version
was published in Constantinople in 1546 within a Jewish (Soncino) Polyglot Bible (Elr. IV:203-
4). Just over a century later in 1657 this version (of the Pentateuch) was transliterated into
Persian characters by Thomas Hyde and published within the London Polyglot Bible (D&M
2:1202; Fischel 1952:5-7; Elr. IV:204). In 742/1341 the Gospels were translated into Persian
from Syriac by Yobanna b. al-Khass YOsuf al-Ya'qobT. 1 And came to be the NT text within the
London Polyglot Bible (1657) of Brian Walton (El r. IV:203). Persian or Judaeo-Persian biblical
books thus circulated through being published in European and other Polyglot Bibles (Darlow
and Moule 2:1201-1211).

Both Shah 'Abbas Is. 995-1038/1587-1629) and Shah Sultan Husayn I (r.1105-1135

/1694-1722) had a role in the appearance of Persian translations of the Gospels (El r. IV:204).
For the latter Shah it was the outstanding translator MTr Muhammad Baqir ibn-I IsmasTI
FlusaynT KhatonabadT (d.1127/1715) who made a Persian translation, expository sketch and
paraphrase of every chapter of all four Gospels entitled Tarjuma-yi anaji1-1 arbaa (Translation
of the Four Gospels). In collaboration with Christian priests of Isfahan he apparently checked
his rendering against several Arabic versions as well as Latin and Hebrew texts
(KhatOnabadr,1996; Arjomand, 1984:154-5).2

Nadir Shah Afshar (r.1148-1160 /1736-1747) was generally well disposed towards
Christians (Jesuits, Carmelites or others) and Christian missionaries resident at Isfahan, Gilan
and elsewhere. Apparently roused by the reference to the Bible (as tawrat and Injil)in Q. 48:29
and informed that these scriptures were extant during his Indian expedition, NadTr Shah
ordered his then secretary and court historian MTrza Muhammad Mandi Khan AstarabadT to
arrange for a Persian translation. This task took just over a year being completed in 1154/ June

This version was reworked with reference to the Vulgate by Xavier though it is apparently lost
(<--Elr. IV:204).

Khatonabadi's Tarjuma-yi anajil-I arba'a was first edited and published in Tehran in 1996 by
Rasal Jasfariyan.

1741\. It involved the translation of both the Gospels and the Q. which was accomplished by
eight Muslim clerics, three Europeans and five Armenian priests (Netzer, Elr. I11:298). Rabbi
Mon ben Norrel of Isfahan and three other Rabbis translated the Pentateuch and Psalms
and Mir Muhammad Ma'sOm Husayni KhatOnabadi and his son 'Abd-al-Ghani had a role in the
translation of the NT (Netzer, Elr. IV:298). Lockhart has noted that on becoming aware of the
translations Nadir Shah came to ridicule Judaism, Christianity and Islam (Lockhart 1938:278,
Elr. IV:204).1

While portions of the Gospels were translated into Persian in the 18th century (1744 and
1793 <--) and earlier centuries, it was the 19th century which witnessed a much greater volume
of Persian Bible translation largely accomplished by western Protestant Christian missionaries.
The stream of such translations was headed in 1804-5 by the translation into Persian
(+English) of John 1-3 (D&M 2:1202) and the Gospel of Matthew by Mirza Muhammad Fit rat
(under the supervision of R. H. Colebrook). 2 Five years later in 1809 under the direction of
Henry Martyn (then chaplain of the East India Company), an Arab from Baghdad named
Nathaniel Sabat translated Matthew's Gospel into Persian (pub. Serampore: BFBS, 1809) (Elr.
IV: 205; D&M 2:1202). Also translated by Sabat was an inadequate complete Persian
translation of the NT which also appeared under the direction of Henry Martyn in 1810 (Eir.
IV:204-5).

The years 1227-8/1812-13 saw the completion and subsequent publication of several
partial or complete Persian translations of the NT/ Gospels (BFBS: Calcutta,1813) including
the Pauline Epistles by the Catholic missionary Leopoldo Sebastiani (D&M 2:1203). More
importantly 1812 saw the completion of what is perhaps the most famous of all 19th century
Persian NT translations, that of Henry Martyn (with the assistance of MTrza Sayyid 'Ali Khan

> Lockhart notes that a copy of the Persian translation of the Gospels, made under the supevision
of Pere Lagarde in Gilan in 1746 , exists in the Bibliotheque Nationale, in Paris (see Blochert's Catalogue

Shirazi) who died in 1812 soon after its completion (D&M 2:1203). Made directly from the
Greek it was initially published in 1814 (and 1815) by the Russian Bible Society of St.
Petersburg. Thereafter it was frequently republished: in Calcutta by the BFBS (+ the Psalms)
1816 and in London from 1837. A Judaeo-Persian NT version transliterated by Lugin at Herat
was also published by the BFBS in London in 1847 (D&M 2:1203; Elr. IV:205).

Subsequent to the publication of Henry Martyn's NT translation, parts of the Hebrew
Bible began to be published in Persian and Judaeo-Persian. / A number of revisions of his NT
translation and further Persian NT versions came to be made. 2 The Persian translation work
of Thomas Robinson (d. 1869, chaplain at Poona then Archdeacon at Madras ) and William
Glen (d. Tehran, 1849) of the Scottish mission at Astrakhan is important in that it led in 1846
to the first complete 19th century Persian Bible publication (D&M 2:1203ff; Thomas Elr.
IV:203ff).

Robinson completed his translation (from the Hebrew) of the Pentateuch, the Kutub-I
khams-I MOsa-yi nabf, in Madras in 1836 (pub. Calcutta: BFBS.,1828). Following other partial
translations (1835-->38) a complete Persian translation of the HB appeared in 2 vols. in 1838
(D&M 2:1204-5; Cat. Ind. Off. Vol. II-Pt. VI, Persian Books; Elr. IV:205). William Glen (& 1-jaji
MTrza Tab) translated the book of Psalms (rev. by W. Greenfield, London: BFBS,1830;
London, 1834; D&M 2:1205). In 1845 he translated the Hebrew Bible with MTrza Muhammad
Jalar (historical books) a revised version of which was published in Edinburgh in 1846 by the
BFBS (United Associate Synod) along with the Henry Martyn Persian translation of the NT.
D&M 2:1206). ) Resident in Iran for six years (1868-1875) the British missionary Robert Bruce
(d.1912) with various assistants also revised Henry Martyn's 1812 NT translation (D&M
2:1207). The complete Bible translation of Glen and Martyn was also revised by Bruce (and

Henry Martyn's translation of the Psalms was also published in London in 1824. In 1831 and
1834 the books of Jonah and Isaiah were also translated into Persian. (Elr. IV:205 ; D&M 2:1205) n

Worth noting is the 1827 Persian translation (from the Arabic) of Genesis by Mtrza Ja'far, a
lecturer in Persian and Arabic at the University of St. Petersburg which was revised by Samuel Lee and
Ivilrza Ibrahim (D&M 2:1204; Elr. IV:205).

others) between 1893 and 1895 (D&M 2:1209-11).
• The Arabic Bible in Qajar Iran.

A number of Arabic Bibles were available to the Shi s i 'ulama' and others in Qajar Iran
and 19th century Ottoman Iraq, Turkey and Palestine. Arabic printed editions of the NT (16th
century CE onwards) were for the most part varieties of a 13th century Arabic recension known
as the "Alexandrian Vulgate". This lies behind the Arabic version in the ten volume Paris
Polyglott (1625-45). Many pre-19th century partial or complete Arabic printed Bibles are
adaptions or revised reprints of this Paris Polyglott including the Arabic texts printed in the
Bib//ca Sacra Polyglotta (1653-7) of Bishop Brian Walton (d.1661) known as the 'London
Polyglot' (<—). Widely distributed in numerous reprints, the 1671 Rome published Arabic Bible
was also printed and distributed by Protestants in Europe. In part hoping to supercede the
weaknesses of earlier versions a printed Protestant Arabic NT appeared in 1727 through
Sulayman ibn Ya s q0b al-Salbani (of Damascus = Solomon Negri). These, and a few other
Arabic Bibles/NT's, such as that of Nathanial Sabat (<— early 19th cent.) were circulating and
distributed by missionaries in Iran in the first half of the 19th century. Later many printings
came to be superceded, for example, by the complete Arabic Bible translation of Eli Smith (d.
1857) and Cornelius Van Dyck ( d. 1895) which became partially then wholly available in print
from the early 1860s (-->7.2).
11 Missionary activity in early Qajar Iran

Henry Martyn (<--) arrived in Shiraz in June, 1811 where he hoped to produce a lucid
Persian NT translation, revise Sabat's unsatisfactory Arabic version, and engage in evangelical
activities amongst the Shil s ulama', resident Sufis and other inhabitants of Shiraz and
elsewhere. His missionizing and polemical writing of several Persian tracts, attracted the
critical interest of a number of leading mullas, mujtahids and Sufis. They led Mirza Ibrahim
(Fasal?), "the preceptor of all the moolas" in 1226/late July 1811 to compose a treatise calling
him to Islam (Wolff MJ III:67; tr. Lee, 1824:1-39; Algar 100-1). The exchange led a
considerable number (25+?) of further written responses to Martyn from sometimes prominent

Shi s i s ulama' some apparently written at the prompting of Fall? 'Ali Shah (r.1797-1835 CE).1
In his letter of 1229/1814 this Shah expressed delight on receipt of the Martyn translation (via
Gore Ousley, the then British Ambassador at Tehran) though he evidently hoped for learned
responses to western anti-Islamic missionary polemic (Smith 1892:486-7). Aside from MuIla
[MTrza] Ibrahim (<--) the following are a few notes about the Shi s i learned who wrote
responses to the Christian "Padre", Henry Martyn.

Important among these written responses to Martyn was that of Mirza AbOl-Qasim,
Qa'im Maqam (d. 1237/1822), the prime minister to 'Abbas Mirza and a friend of BA*'s father
Mirza 'Abbas NM (d.1839). His 11/1Agh al-nubuwwa (Key to the Prophethood) in refutation of
Martyn's missionary work was probably among those commissioned by Fall? 'Ali Shah (Algar,
1967:101 fn.123). 2 The response of Hajji MuIla Muhammad Riga' b. Muhammad Amin
Hamadani (d. 1247/1831) was also entitled Miftsh al-nubuwwah (The Keys of Prophethood)
of which a full English translation is found in Lee's 1824 Controversial Tracts (1824:164-450).
Therein much space is devoted to biblical prophecies allegedly fulfilled by Muhammad, including
some Hebrew passages identified as the "Revelation of the Hebrew Child" (Lee 1824:cxviiiff,
302-26; QU:129-30; Wolff: MJ III:127; 156 cf. 111; Algar 1967:101).

A fourth person to engage in this debate was MuIla 'Ali N0ri lsfahani (d. 1242/1826-7)
whose response to Martyn was entitled K I: I ujjat al-is/am (Book of the Proof of Islam)
incorrectly listed in the Dharla as a work in "refutation of the 11/11Zan al-haqq by Henry
Martyn" (VI:207 No.1408).Tunukabuni reckoned that this work established the reality of the
khatam al-anbiya' (= Muhammad as 'seal of the prophets') (QU:130; Wolff, MJ. III:67,121,
156; Algar 1978:101). Fifthly, there was the response of Mulla Ahmad b. Muhammad Mandi

In the third volume of his Missionary Journal Wolff gives two lists of ShT'T clerics who responded
to the missionary challenge of Henry Martyn. In December 1826 a certain Mulla Muhammad 'All told him
that various "Doctors of Persia" wote in reply to "Henry Martyn's book" (MJ 111:67). Five months later (May
1825) Wolff reports that a Persian Shaykh resident in Urumiya told him that Henry Martyn had "written a
book against the prophet" (Muhammad) and that various Mullas had "completely answered" this book.
Seven 'Mullas' are listed (<--) (Wolff, MJ. 111:156; Lee,1824:cxv; QU:129-30; Algar 1978:100-101).

2 This text is apparently contained in Muhammad Sadiq HusaynT, Makhzan al-lnsha, TabrTz,
1274/1857 (Algar, 1969:100 fn. 115).

NaraqT KashanT (d. c.124511829), a pupil of Baly- al-1110m (<--) entitled Sayf al-umma wa
burhan al-umma (Sword of the Community and Vindication of the [Muslim] Community) which
was twice printed in Iran (in 1267/1851 and 1331/1913). Dedicated to Fath 'Ali Shah this author
in preparing it "called together ten of the rabbis of Kashan, and with their help translated into
Persian a number of passages from the Old Testament and Jewish theological works which he
included in his tract refuting Henry Martyn".1

A sixth person to engage in this debate was Mull 'AIT Akbar b. Muhammad Baqir
IsfahanT (RawdatJ: 416; Algar,1967:101) and a seventh HajjT Mull a Muhammad Taqi BurghanT
QazvinT, the ShahTd Thalith ('Third Martyr') (d.1263 /1847). The Bab' heroine Fatima
BaraghanT, Tahirih, was his niece, the daughter of (his brother) 171 ajji Mull a Muhammad Salih
BaraghanT (TunukabunT,QU:19-66;MacEoin,E.Ir.111:740+bib.). It is particularly interesting that
this man was among those who responded to Henry Martyn in that it might hint at a possible
source of Tahira's alleged biblical learning mentioned in a few Baha'T sources (Avarih, Kawakib
1:118; Mazandarani, KZH IV:703-4).

An eighth person mentioned by Wolff to have taken part in this debate was Sayyid
Muhammad Karbala'T, "son of the late Sayyid 'All", apparently the "grand Mujtahid of Karbala"
who thought it worth "writing an answer to a book composed by a kafir [unbeliever] like Martyn"
(Wolff MJ 111:156). A ninth figure was HajjT Mull a IbrahTm KalbasT (d.1262/1845),(MJ 111:156),
another pupil of Bahr al-' UlOm who apparently followed the example of his teacher in engaging
in religious debate. A few more figures are also known to have taken part in this debate,
including a certain Hajj Mulla Masa Najafi (MJ 111:156 Shaykh Musa b. Shaykh Ja s far Naraqi
(= No. 6?) and Mirza Muhammad AkhbarT another pupil of Bahr al-'UlOm (d. 1233/ 1818?;
Wolff, MJ 111:1561; Algar 1967:101).
In addition to Arabic and Persian Bibles, the 19th century also witnessed an increasing

flood of Arabic and Persian evangelical tracts. Aside from the several works of Pfander 1 (<-5.1)
there appeared, for example, a Persian version of the Evidences of Prophecy of Alexander
Keith (d.1880) entitled Risala kashf al-athar IT ql;sas-I anbiya-yi bani isra71, translated at
Urumiyya by J. L. Merrick (1803-66) and published in Edinburgh in 1846 (Graf, GCAL. 4:237ff).
A range of Arabic Christian polemical works and translations were also available in 19th century
Iran, including E. Pocock's translation of book six of Hugo Grotius' De Veritate religionis
Christianae with the acerbic title al-Muqalat fi brat al-Islam (Discourses on the Futility of
Islam, 1731) (in the 1820s Wolff distributed a version of part of this book in Iran). In 1824
Shaykh Hasan, a leading mujtahid of Shiraz, distributed copies of Grotius' polemic among his
students inviting them to write refutations. Aware of biblical tahrif he also commissioned these
students to search the Bible for Muhammad's "name" "Mad-mad" (<--) (MJ III:59-60; cf. 53).

In his Religion and State in Iran Alger observes that during the reign of Fatn 'All Shah
"the dual role of the 'ulama.. of opposing the state, and that of countering the impact of foreign
powers" was already evident and was "to become more explicit and active as the century
progressed". (Alger, 1969:102). Having briefly surveyed the role of the ulama' in response to
the missionary polemic of Henry Martyn, Algar also writes, "It was an age of intense theological
activity, and powerful tracts against Sufism and Akhbarism, as well as Christianity were
commonplace" (Alger: 1969:102)

That many among the early-mid.19th cent. Shri s ulama' responded to Christian
missionary activity and polemic is confirmed by the fact that both leading Shaykhis Sayyid
Kazim Rashti (d. 1843) and Karim Khan Kirmani (d. 1871) wrote works on these lines (-->5.2).
Though the Bab did not write istidlaliyya tracts like the aforementioned and above listed writers,
he quite frequently took-Sufis and Christians to task for their heretical theological beliefs,
making a direct rabf ("link", "connection") between God and humanity and believing in forms

Among Pfander's works are the Mrzan al- ljaqq (Balance of Truth), Persian trans. published in
Shusha (Trans Caucasian Georgia)in 1835; .Tarfq abliayat (The Path of Life) and Mifial7 abasrar (Key
to the Mysteries) all of which appear to have been printed in either Persian or Arabic.

of the Trinity and (literal) Sonship of Jesus. It should be clear from the above that the Bab had
relatively easy access to the Bible in either Persian or Arabic translation. During his early years
Bible translation and distribution by Christian missionaries in and around Shiraz was quite
common. Wolff and others constantly distributed Bibles in Shiraz and other Iranian localities.
In 1824 Wolff was told that the Gospel was "much read" in Shiraz especially among the Sufis
(MJ 111:35). It will be argued below that the lack of biblical citation by the Bab was not due to
ignorance or inaccessibility but to a deliberate choice, most probably dictated by his very
elevated view of the Q. and his own revelations.

Chapter Six
THE BIBLE AND ISRA'iLlYYÁT IN EARLY SHAYKHISM

II 6.1 The Bible and Isralliyyat in works of Shaykh Ahmed al-Ahsa'T (d.124111826)

The Shi'ite faction known as Shaykhism derives from the polymathic, theosophically
oriented philosopher-theologian Shaykh Ahmed b. Zayn al-Din al-Ahsa'T. Born in the eastern
Arabian province of al-Ahsa (= Hasa), he lived most of his life in the Shi'ite shrine cities of Iraq
(17905-early 1800s) and in Iran (from 1806) where for several decades he was favoured as
a leading authority. Through correspondence the then Qajar ruler Fat1-.CAIT Shah (r.1797-
1834) induced Shaykh Ahmed to write a number of treatises. A prolific and influential author,
he wrote in excess of 150 mostly Arabic works. At times the Shaykh claimed direct knowledge
through supernatural communication with various occulted (twelver) Imams seen as eternal
loci of reality. He championed high imamological perspectives. Though he seems not to have
sought to bypass acceptable (AkhbarT-) UsOIT positions he was accused of going beyond
Shi s ite hermeneutical and doctrinal norms.'

Shaykh Ahmed reduced to three the normative five pillars (pl. arkan) or bases (usril)
of Shrism; namely, [1] tawhid (The Divine unity), [2] nubuwwa (prophethood), [3] ma'ad (lit.
'return' = resurrection, eschatology), [4] 'Mama (the Imamate) and [5] 'ad! (Divine justice). He
thought that pillar [1] presupposed pillar [5] while pillar [2] incorporated pillar [3]. The
importance of living centre[s] of Shi s ite guidance indicated by the phrase al-rukn al-rabr (the
Fourth Support), was furthermore, related to learned mujtahids and / or the 'Perfect ShrT
[Shi'a] (MacEoin, 1982:35f+ sources).

In ShrT-Shaykhi theosophy the locus of the Fourth Support was to some extent the
microcosmic exemplar of al-Insan al-kamil ('The Perfect Human', Lawson, 1998:148-9). This
Fourth Support was regarded as an individual figure by Sayyid Kazim and could thus be
understood messianically by the Bab. Conceived as a single individual superior to any exalted
marja al-taglid (source of emulation), the Fourth Support became evocative for the Bab's self-

i lbrahTmT, Fihrist, MacEoin, s Ansa'r...' Elr. 1:674-9;1992:165; Ansn, DMI 6:662-8.

understanding. He represented himself as the "Hidden [Fourth] Support" in his 7: Kawthar
(1846) from whom all should seek guidance (T.Kawthar, fol. 36aff; McEoin, ibid, 36-7).

Like others before him, Shaykh Atimad held to a complex non-gross bodily mrraj of
Muhammad and had a spiritualistic understanding of the eschatological resurrection body (Sh-
Ziyara, tr. Corbin, 1990:180f). At times influenced by Sufi, IshraqT and various philosopher-
theologians of the 'School of Isfahan', the multi-faceted range of Shaykh Ahmad's learning was
very wide ranging. He was especially learned in the doctrinal traditions of the twelver Imams
as well as all imamological and philosophical learning including hikmat-i ilahi ("theosophical
Shis ism") and the esoteric or occult sciences. Testifying to the immensity and universality of
Shaykh Ahmad's learning, Sayyid Kazim in his Dail/ al-mutahayykin (The Stunning Evidence)
listed around thirty branches of knowledge in which he believed him adept including "the main
occult sciences of astrology, alchemy [kimiya], numerology, gematria, jafr, and the four
disciplines known as limiya, himiya, simiya and fimiya" (MacEoin 1985:78-79+fn.13).

Evidence of this polymathic, often arcane learning is evidenced throughout the Jawamr
al-kilam. It is also evident, for example, in Shaykh Atimad's Risa7a al-Rashtlyya (1226/1811),
a reply to Mull a 'AIT ibn MTrza Jan RashtT dating to 1226/1811. Therein Shaykh Ahmad
responds in detail to several complex issues and statements made by al-BOnT (<--) and Ibn al-
'Arabi about Wm al-huref (letter mysticism). He dealt with a saying asserting that al-Jafr (<--
letter divination) will appear in eschatological times with the Imam Mandi who alone is cognisant
of its truth. Several complex angeological questions in relationship to letter mysticism are also
dealt with, including the association of the letter "A" (alit) with lsrafil and "B" (al-Ba) with
Gabriel, etc., as well as the derivation of the names of various angels.

About four years-before his passing Shaykh Abmad was accused of heresy by a
number of contemporary Shi s T authorities including the Qazvini cleric and uncle of the Balm
poetess Tahira, Mull a Muhammad TaqT BaraghanT (d.1263/1847). (TunikabOnT, qsa.si,19ff).
Following this taktir (excommunication) the Shaykh migrated to Iraq apparently intending to
settle in Mecca though he passed away in Medina before this was possible. The charge of

> heresy levelled against him included the accusation that he went beyond the bounds of Shi'T
> orthodoxy in teaching such doctrines as the non-physical nature of the isra'-mrraj ("night
ascent- journey") of the Prophet Muhammad and of the resurrection body of the faithful.

The lengthy (often 4 volume, 34,000 verse) Sharh al-ziyara al:0mPa al-kabira
(Commentary upon the Greater General Prayer of Visitation) is a phrase by phrase Arabic
commentary on a prayer of visitation for the tenth Imam 'All al-Hadi (d. c. 254/868). It is widely
acknowledged as Shaykh Ah mad's most significant work l and was completed in 1230 /1815
for Sayyid Husayn ibn Muhammad Qasim 171 usaynT UshkurT Jilani.

The Sharh al-ziyara of Shaykh Ahmad contains a few Islam icate biblical citations and
other points of exegetical interest. Moses-Sinai motifs receive interesting non-literal
interpretations as do the major pre-Islamic prophet figures Israel and Moses. At one point
Shaykh Ah mad sanctions allegorical interpretations of certain quri anic verses mentioning
Moses and the ummat Masa (community of Moses). They can signify Muhammad and the
Islamic "community of Muhammad". Moses is seen as a prototype of Muhammad and the bana
Isra'11 ("children of Israel") of the Shis i "family of Muhammad" (al Muhammad). A confirmatory
tradition from Ja'fa r Sadiq is cited as recorded in the Tafsir of 'Ayyashi (<--2.1) about the
qur'anic address, "0 children of Israel" (ya bani Isra71). This address is specifically said to refer
to   the "Us" of the shn community,

> Nfow as for the fact that "Israel" has the sense of the servant of God ('abd-Allah)
> [then know] that Muhammad is the servant of God ('abd-Allah)... And as for
> the fact that "Israel" (Isra71) is a similitude (mathal) of him [Muhammad]...
> [know that] it has been related from the prophet [Muhammad] that he was heard
> saying, "I indeed am Thy servant, my name is Ah mad, I am the servant of God
> (abd-Allah), my name is Israel (isra 79 for He [God] did not command him
> [Israel] [in the Q.] but had [actually] commanded me [Muhammad]... (Sh-Ziyara,
> I11:278).

Other important works of Shaykh Ahmad include the al-Fawak/ ("Lessons" ) dating
prior   to 1216/1801 in which twelve lessons are presented, including one on the creation of all

This general Ziyara can be found in Ibn BabOya's Man lö yahcluruh al-faqfh and al-TOsts
Tandhib (Momen, BSBM1:42).

things in six days as recorded in the Q. (cf. Genesis 1 etc). Shaykh Ahmad himself and certain
of his disciples wrote commentaries or hashiyya (marginal glosses) upon this work. The
Shaykh also wrote a lengthy Sharh al-fawaid (Commentary upon the Fawaid) which was
completed in 1233/1818 (Fih.:20). Shaykh Ahmad's commentaries upon the Mashair and
Arshiyya of MuIla Sadra are also among his best known writings. His multi-volume Sharh al-
hikma al-arshiyya (Commentary upon the Wisdom of the Throne) is a commentary on the
al-Hikma al-Arshiyya of MuIla Sadra , was completed in Kirmanshah in 1236/ 1820-1 (Pub:
Tabriz, 1271 [+ 78-9] /1854/61-2; Fihrist 53; cf. Morris, 1981). Passages from certain of these
works will be cited below.

Interesting often non-literal interpretations of Islamic scriptural materials occasionally
centering upon qi;sas al-anbiya' and associated matters are found within the large, 19th
century, two volume lithographed compendium of Shaykh Ahmad's writings entitled Jawami'
al-kllam (Comprehensive Utterance). This compendium contains over ninety sometimes
kec\gtkw rasa 11 (treattises) detati‘ting Shaykh Ahmad's responses to a very wide range of
doctrinal and other enquiries largely posed by Shn individuals (Momen, BSBM1:12-13). The
richness of this source will be evident in the following pages.

A Risala of Shaykh Ahmad contained in the Jawamr al-k//Gm responds to questions
about the significance of a tradition stating that prophets are made from the supernal clay of
'aliyyTn   (exaltedness) as opposed to the base clay of sgn (cf. Q.83:7f). Other traditions
commented upon by Shaykh Ahmad have it that in creating Adam God sent Gabriel out on
the first hour of Friday (cf. Al-TabarT, 111f, Rosenthal, tr. 282f) and that the clay from which the
first man was made was kneaded with both Divine "hands for forty days (cf Q. 38:76) (JK,
2:104-110; MajmiTa, 30:194-215; cf also JK 2:69-75).

In another Risa/a probably written in reply to a group of religious students Shaykh
Ahmed was asked to reconcile two traditions; one stating that Moses transported the body of
Joseph to Jerusalem and another indicating that Noah transferred the bones of Adam to Najaf.
He was also asked to explain how they relate to traditions recorded in the Tandhib of al-TOsT

(<--2.2) about the bodies of the prophets and the Imams remaining either 3, 30 or 40 days in
the grave. This in the light also of Shaykh Ahmad's own assertion that people cannot see the
Imams in their graves (JK 2:131-134).

A Risala written in reply to Mahmod Mirza takes up the significance of the well-known
hadrth stating that "God created Adam according to His form" as well as another mentioning
the ra's al-jalet ("head of Goliath") and dating before 1227/1812 (JK,1276: 276-279). A further
RI:9Na of 1223/1188 addressed to various brethren discusses whether the punishment of the
inmates of Hell is everlasting or not. The issue of whether or not Pharaoh had become a
believer was a question most likely dictated by statements made on this subject by Ibn al-
'Arabi (JK1:110-115; MajmO'a, 30:218-235). An interesting Risala dating to 1231/ 1815-16
replies to the significance of the tiadith, "Three winds came to Solomon, he chose two of them
and left the third for the Qalm" (JK:1276:32-7). The Risala al-Tahiriyya (236/1821) responds
to sixteen questions of MuIla Muhammad Tahir Qazvini including two about what within Islam
can be seen to parallel the miracle of the fatherless, virgin birth of Jesus and the story of
Jonah (BSBM1:110)

A Risala in response to Mull a 171 usayn Wa s iz Kirmani includes Shaykh Ahmad's
response to questions relating to the manner of Eve's being created from the left rib of Adam
(Fihrist No.103; BSBM1: No. 116; JK 2:116-125). That addressed to Mull a Husayn Bafq! (of
Yazd?) responds to the significance posed by a /. 7adrth about God instructing Moses to bring
the bones of Joseph out from Egypt (BSBM: No.117). A brief Risala responding to questions
of Sayyid 171 usayn ibn 'Abd al-Qahir al-Bahrani (written in 1214/1799-1800) expounds aspects
of the story of Moses and Khidr as well, among other things, as the eschatological return
(Fihrist, No.102; text, JK 2:46-8).
III Shaykh Ahmed and the Bible
None of the sources I have examined indicate that Shaykh Ahmad had a detailed or
direct knowledge of the canonical Bible. As with other learned Shri Muslims of his day he knew
various Islamicate Bible citations from various sources including hadith qudsT such as are

found in the Rawdat al-kafi of KulaynT (<-3.2, Ayoub, 1976). Islamicate biblical citations of
Shaykh Ahmad exist in his published and unpublished writings. In his Kashkal (Begging
Bowl): for example, the Shaykh cites a lengthy passage from Muhammad Baqir MajlisT's
ljadq al-yacifn ('The Reality of Certainty' c. 1110/1629). This citation in the Kashkal includes
several passages from the HB in Arabic transliteration and translation along with brief
exegetical comments. Several well-known Islamicate testimonia are evidenced in this way.
Deut 18:15,18, for example, is said to relate to Muhammad, the Seal of the prophets (khatam
al-anbiya) and not, as some Jews maintain, the biblical Joshua. Gen 17:20b is also cited and
the (Heb.) "TiC IR= (bi-m elod m e iod) is fairly accurately transliterated La but understood

as                  (Ar. b/-mad mad). Masjlisi holds that some Jewish exegetes maintain that

the proper name Ahmad as the Arabic word azim, meaning "Mighty" (a loose rendering of
Ahmed = "most praised") is twice indicated. A little later in his Kashkal a few other books of the
HB are referred to including five or six Islamicate, quasi-Johannine paraclete passages
(Kashla, II:538ff; cf. Lambden 1997:115.fn.68). Finally it should be noted in this connection
that the Kashkal of Shaykh Ahmad also cites a saying of Jesus beginning "0 children of Israel!
Do not say that knowledge (a1-71m) is [lodged] in heaven for whoso ascends unto heaven shall
[indeed] produce it! It is not found in the garbage heap of the earth (kawm al-ard)". This saying
has no exact NT source though it perhaps calls John 3:13ff to mind (Kashkol, 11:103).

Islamicate, expanded forms of Q. 5:116b are cited from Jesus in many Islamic sources.

Since the time of al-Tustayri (d. 283/896), Rozbihan BaqIi Shiraz' (d.606/1209) and beyond,
variant forms of this qur'anic verse have been put into the mouth of Jesus. They have been
important in moulding Muslim thought about the mystery of the divine colloquy
(Bowering,1980:188-190). Such a passage is cited from Jesus by Shaykh Ahmad in his
1226/1811 epistle in reply to questions posed by Sayyid AbT              asan al-Jilan' (JK 1:141-5).

In this latter tome numerous often arcane texts are gathered including passages from MuhyT   Din
al-BonT, Ibn al - 'Arabi and the Kalimat-i maknonth of al-Faycl al-KashanT.

Discoursing upon the mysteries of the level of al-nafs a/-/ahritlyya al-malakcitiyya (the divine
angelic Self ) the following saying of "Jesus the Messiah" (7sa al-masih) is quoted,

> I know not what is in Thy Self for Thou indeed art the Knower of things unseen
> ('al/am al-ghayb). (Q. 6:116b) For it [the nafs, Self of God] is the transcendent
> essence of God (dhat Allah), the "Blessed Tree" (shajarat al-Nba), the "Lote-
> Tree of the Extremity" (sidrat al-muntaha)...' (Majm0'a 30:97).1

An example of a an alleged passage fil-in111 ("from the Gospel[s]") is found in Shaykh
Ahmad's Sharh al-Ziyara. Commenting upon the phrase "And thy selves (anfus) are in the
selves" (wa anfusikum ftl-nuf0s) the following Islamicate Gospel text is set down, "I created
you for My sake and I created things (al-ashya) for your own sake. " (Sharh al-giyara IV:26).
At another point in the same work Shaykh Ahmad cites the following hadith qudsi --
subsequently said to be contained in the injit

> "I [God] created existing things (a/-as/7yã2 for thy sake and I created thee for
> My sake for while your inner reality (barin) is I Myself (ana) thine outer self
> (gahir) is for destruction (Ill-fana2" (Sh-Ziyara I11:352-3).

After citing this saying the Shaykh goes immediately on to quote al-In./II (The Gospel) exactly
as it is found in Bursts Mashariq,

> Know thyself, 0 mankind! then thou shalt know thy Lord for thine outer self
> (gahir) is for destruction (111-fana2 while thine inner reality ('bat/n,) is I Myself
> (ana)(ibid., III: 353).
Elsewhere in the Sharh al-ziyara the words "I created thee for My sake and I created
existing things (al-ashya2 for thy sake" (IV:26) are specifically cited from the injil though the
word order is slightly different to that given above.
II Shaykh Ahmed on Isralliyyat motifs and prophetological mysteries.
The sometimes abstruse Arabic writings of Shaykh Ah mad contain interesting non-literal

_
interpretations of IsraIliyyat motifs, qiSas al-anbiya narratives and associated materials

Versions of Q. 5:116b are also found scattered among various writings of the Bab and BA*.

An example from BA* can be found in one of his Ridwan Tablets: "Thou [God] knowest what is in me, but
I know not what is in Thee. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed" (AyyamT:255).

> especially as they are found in the ShrT traditions of the Imams. His knowledge of such matters
> is illustrated in his major works and in his responses to the often detailed questions put to him
during the course of his residence in Iran and Iraq (lbrahamT, Fihrist; Momen, BSBM1).

Scattered throughout the writings of Shaykh Ahmad are statements about the first Adam
and the first couple or about there being a myriad Adams. Responding to a question of Mull
Muhammad H usayn al-AnarT al-Ahsa'T makes a variety of cosmological statements and
continues,

God, exalted be he, created a thousand, thousand worlds and a thousand,
> thousand Adams. You are in the last of the worlds and of these Adams. And in
> all of these worlds there exists the likeness (similitude, mathal) of what is in our
> world respecting the heavens and the earth, the mountains, the oceans and the
> fishes, the trees and the fruits, and the deserts. So too what is in it of wild beasts
> and birds and other assembled things. And these worlds are all within this world
> (al-dunya) and in the hereater ('world to come' al-akhira). On the Day of
> Resurrection the people shall multiply in both earth and heaven... (MajmCia
> 30:312-3; cf. Sh-Ziyara 3:301f; 361f).

At one point in his Sharh al-hikma al- sarshlyya Shaykh At) mad comments upon a
statement about the relationship between the Q., and a "Book" (kitab) in the light of an Adam
and Jesus analogy. He refers to Adam as "the Hidden Book of God" (adam kitab Allah al-
maknan)on one level inferior to Jesus who found existence through the command of God (min
amr Allah). Jesus is presented as the cosmic "Pen" with which God wrote the secrets of
destiny on the primordial "Tablet" (al-lawh) as well as God's "Intellect" lad° identified with the
Q. and a "Light" bestowing guidance unto the "straight Path" (Sh-'Arshiyya, 206ff).

Commenting a little later upon a statement about the origin of speech Shaykh Ahmad
disassociates the transcendent God and His Speech (al-kalam). When God conversed with
Moses it was indirectly, through the instrumentality of the Sinaitic "Tree" (shajara) or bush:

> God, praised be He, actualized speech (al-kalam) through the (Sinaitic) Tree
> (bll-shajarat) before Moses for the "Tree" was a book (k/tab an) and his speech
> (kalam) rose up from within it. Thus, the agent of speech (al-mukallim) is
> Moses through the "tree" (shajara)[indirectly] from Him [God]. The speaker was
> he through whom speech rose up [= Moses]. So the "Tree" is the speaker'
> although the speaker was [also] he who originated the speech [i.e God through
> Moses]. The speaker [in reality is thus] God, praised be he, for he created that
one through which the "Tree" became articulate... (Sh-'Arshiyya, 210-211).

Quite a number of other writings of Shaykh Ahmad comment upon Moses' Sinaitic
encounter with God and associated motifs. In an epistle to a certain Mull a 'AR TawbalT (written
in 1211 A.H., 1797) he responded to a number of questions which required that he explain
Moses/Sinai motifs. Asked about the significance of various trees mentioned in the Q. he wrote:

> And the Tree (shajara)which is in the "Holy Vale" (al-wa cf al-muqaddas)and the
> "Tree issuing from the Mount of Sinai (tar sina)"[Q. 25:20] is the Primordial
> Reality (al-awwali) through which the [divine] Word (al-kalam)had precedence.
> The "Holy Vale" is the "Tranquil Soul" (an-nafs al-muta'inna) and the "Mount"
> (a/-tor) is the obedient, patient body (al-jasad al-muff' al-sabir). And the "Holy
> Vale" is [also] the secure heart (al-qalb al-salim) and the "Mount" the upright
> intellect (al-aql al-mustaqTm)(JK 1:25).

After making detailed comments on the "trees" mentioned in Q. 14:24ff. Shaykh Ahmad
explains the significance of the Siniatic "Holy Vale" and the "Holy Land,":

> • . . the "Holy Vale" (al-wad al-muqaddas)is the "secure heart" (al-qalb al-salim)
> which is filled with contentment (al-ricla2 and submission (al-taslim). The "Holy
> Land" (al-arc/ al-muqaddas)is the "tranquil, satisfied, contented soul." The "Holy
> Vale" the "house of procreation and marriage" (baytat-tawIrd wa il-tanakuh) and
> the "Purple Lights" (al-anwar al-filfTnyya). The "Holy Land" is the "New Body"
> (al-jasad al-jacild). (JK1:26).

Having thus indicated the mystical import of the Sinaitic "Tree", "Holy Vale," and
"Mount," the Shaykh quotes a saying to the effect that the "Tree" planted on Mount Sinai is
possessed of the power of articulate, rational speech (al-toyawani al-natiq). It is, he states,
a "Tree" symbolic of the "substance of Noble Man" (hayala al-insan al-karTm). Drawing on
some rather arcane traditions, the Shaykh also comments on the "Tree" of Q. 25:20, in the light
of its having been set in the zodiac by Balsiyal [?] ibn H Or, the bearer of the "Dome of Time"
(qubbat al-zaman). An herbal substance (a1-1.7ashisha) associated with this cosmic "Tree"
(shajara) is represented by an obscure cryptogram. When treated alchemically it leads to the
production of pure gold (Lambden, 1988:87).

In his Shar1. 7 al-ziyara and other treatises, Shaykh Ahmad comments on Q. 7:143 in
the light of the tradition that it was a proto-Shrite cherub (al-karrub) that was manifested before
Moses   and shattered the mountain. According to tradition the sixth Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq said
of the cherubim:

> ...The Cherubim (al-karub)fan), are a people of our [Shill party among the
> primordial creation things (al-khalqal-awwal). God established them beyond the
> divine Throne (al-'arsh). If but a portion of the light (ner) of one of them should
> reach the people of the earth it would surely suffice them. When he [Moses]
> asked his Lord what he asked [to see him, Q,7:143] God commanded one of
> their men (ri/a/ a") and he divulged his transfigured glory (tajalli) before him
> [Moses] only to the extent of the eye of a needle. And thus was the mountain
> (al-jabal) crushed and Moses fell into a swoon" (cited the Bab, T. a/-ha'(I):245).

This motif of the cherub (Ar. karab; pl. karCib)'ün) in Shri tradition is rooted in (post-)
biblically informed Shri Isra'iliyyat. Perhaps one time sphinx-type guardians of the sacred, the
vz-.1D   (Heb. pl. kerObim, cherubim), (Ar)                  (al-karabiyyon) are Judaeo-Christian

angelic figures mentioned 91 times in the HB. They guard the sacred (e.g. "tree of Life", Gen.
3:24) and perform various functions as bearers of the Divine Throne (Ezek 1,10:20, etc;
Mellinger, DDD2:189-92). These beings became angelic figures of great significance in post-
biblical angelology, merkabah mysticism and other forms of Jewish esotericism not to
mention their occasional role in Shis i gnosis and Isma'ili cosmology (Gruenwald 1980;
Halperin 1988; Stern,1983:3ff). The cherubim seem only obliquely mentioned in the Q. as the
mugarrabOn ('those nigh unto God', Q. 4:70; 21:20; cf. 3:40). At one point in his FutOhat I bn
al-'Arabi mentions the elevated al-karobiyyün as the first angels to appear from that "Light"
which was named the primordial "Intellect" ( a q ) (F utütiat 1:148).

It was an infinitesimal portion of the "light of the [divine] Veil" (nür al-sitr) or the "light
of [God's] Grandeur" (nor al-azImat)obscured by God's seventy thousand " veils of Light" and
related to the primordial, divine "Light" of the Imams, that beamed forth before Moses from the
mysterious cherubic "Speaker" on the Sinaitic Mount. It was also in view of Imam sadiq's
having stated that "God manifested himself (tajalla) unto his servants through his Speech [or
Word] (al-kalam) but they did not see Him [God]" that Shaykh Ahmad also taught that God's
theophany before the "mountain" was the theophany of "the Speaker" (al-mutakallim) through
His "Speech" (al kalam) and not God's a personalistic theophany of God's Essence.
In was in the form of "Light," that the divine "Speech" was revealed upon the sacred

"mountain", which for Shaykh Ahmad can (among other things) be symbolic of the "heart" of
Moses. While, however, Moses' Sinaitic experience of God was a mystical experience of a
mere glimmer of the Divine Light, Imam Ja'far is said to have had an experience of its fullness
whilst wrapt in prayer. Both literalistic and mystical interpretations of Q. 7:143 are found in the
vastly erudite writings of Shaykh Ahmad. This Sinaitic aspect of the Shaykh's writings had a
tremendous impact upon the Bab and probably contributed to his own self-understanding and
experience of God. In line with Shaykhr perspectives in various of his writings, the Bab
understood the Sinaitic theophany to be a cherubic Shrite angelophany (T. Ha' (1) 14:245).

The Jawami' al-kallm (= JK) contains six important treatises resolving questions posed
by Shaykh Ahmad ibn salrb ibn TOci al-Qat ifT (d. after.1246/1830). Several of them are
centered upon matters associated with pre-Islamic prophets (BSBM1 Nos. 8, 87,102, 109,
128,129). Among the lengthiest is the al-Risala al-Qatifiyya in which the Shaykh responds to
71 questions. Among the qisas al-anbiya' matters touched upon are: the nature of Adam's
creation and the birth of Eve from his left rib; the houris, the jinn and of the birth of Adam from
dust; the reality of paradise, the tree, the serpent, Iblis, heaven, the angels and the story of
Adam and his eating from the tree; the story of Job and how Satan overcame a messenger of
God; Moses as intercessor for the umma of Muhammad and the obligatory prayers being five;
the all-encompassing nature of the storm of Noah relative to later lesser punishments
associated with other prophets; aspects of Abraham's aborted sacrifice of his son (Q. 56)
(Fihrist No.114; BSBM1: 129f; JK, 1/ ii: 114-147).

At one point within the R. al-Qatifiyya Shaykh Ahmad makes the following statement
pertinent to satanic activity and the effect of the Prophet Muhammad upon it,

> I say that the satans (al-shayatin) are the manifestations of primal ignorance
> (magahiral-jahla/-awwal)just as the angels (a/-malaRat)are the manifestations
> of the First Intellect (al-aq/ al-awwal). They were assuredly born of Iblis whose
> pre-fall ['archangelicl name was s Azazil (= "Empowered of God"). When he was
expelled his name became Iblis (JK 1/ii :126).

Here satanic beings become symbols of ignorance while angelic figures are indicative

of the (Neoplatonic) First Intellect (at- aq/ akawwal). Most likely derived from the Greek
diabolos (616[3oAoq = 'the slanderer') the demoniac adversary IblTs is one of the qur'anic
names of the mythic being who, after refusing to bow down before Adam, became the source
of evil (Q.2:34, 7:11; 15:31-2, etc).' Jewish traditions associate Azazel with the Levitical
scapegoat (Lev.16:8,10; Azazel = Heb. 5mtv, "Fierce of God", Wright, AB 1:536). Originally
among the archangelic watchers 'Azazil ultimately became a demoniac figure associated with
the primordial [Arch] angelic fall.' Black associates Azazel with Leviticus 16 and notes that he
"appears in fact as the forerunner or prototype in Hebrew demonology of Satan or Belial in
later traditions." (Black, 1985:121).

It is likely that Shaykh Ahmad derived his information about Azazel from Isralliyyat
informed tafsfr works. His comments are echoed, for example, by al-Tabari (<-3.1) in his
massive Jamr al-bayan(1: 100) and by al-Tabarsi in his Majma' al-bayan where the following
prophetic tradition is recorded:

> Before he comitted rebellion Iblis was one of the angels whose name was
> Azazel ('Azazil) He was reckoned among the watchers [inhabitants] of the earth
> (saldnakarc/),.such watchers of the earth (saldn al-ard)were among the angels
> designated as jinn. When he waxed proud before God and refused to prostrate
> before Adam, he renounced him, cursed him, made him [a] Satan and named
> him IblTs." (Majma' 1:83 on Q. 2:34)
> A Risala al-Jalanyya was written by Shaykh Ah mad for MTrza Ja'far ibn Ahmad
Nawwab Yazdi in Yazd in 1222/1807 (JK 1:130-5 = Majmüa 30:13-28). It contains replies to
a question about God's blessing Muhammad and his family as he had previously blessed
Abraham and his family as well as about the purpose of God in sending Messengers and Holy
Books to mankind. The significance of the eschatological prophet's possessing a "crimson [red],
she-camel" (al-naqa alhamra) is also expounded. Shaykh Ah mad reckons the "crimson she-
camel" as the most beautiful of she-camels (ahsan al-nag). Among other things this red,

I Algar,'EbIls' Elr. VII:656-661; Awn, 1983:25f
2 1 Enoch 8:1; 9:6; 4 Q180 1 7-8; Milik,1976:314; Apocalypse of Abraham (c. 100 CE? originally
Hebrew?) 13:6-14; etc; Janowski, 'Azazel' DDD:240f; cf. Enc.Jud. 3:999-1002.

crimson colour is related to one of the "lights of the Divine Throne" which causes the redness
of all things red.

Another Risa/a writen in reply to inhabitants of Isfahan in 1223/1808 dwells upon the
significance of the tradition of lm5m 'Air about the Divine Throne (aKarsh) and its tetradic
constituent lights. Allegedly dialoguing with a primate of an oriental (Armenian) Christian
Church (akdathillq) about the manner of God's being the bearer of the Throne (hamll aKarsh)
(Q. 35:41) and Q.69:17b where eight angels are said to perform this task, AIT stated,

> The [divine] Throne (at- arsh)was created by God. ..from four Lights (anwar): a
> Crimson Light (nor ahmar) by means of which redness (a/-humra) was
> reddened; the Green Light (nor al-akhclar) by means of which greenness (al-
> khucka) was made green; the Yellow Light (al-nor al-agar) by means of which
> yellowness (al-sufra) was yellowed and the white Light (al-nür al-abyao)
> through which whiteness (al-bayo)was [whitened] realized. This [Light of the
> Throne] is the knowledge (huwa al-71m) which God, the Bearer (al-ham/a)has
> borne aloft [between] that Light (al-nor) which is of the Light of His Grandeur
> and of His Power. It is thus through His Grandeur and His Light that the hearts
> of the believers are made perceptive...So all that has been born aloft (mahmOl)
> has been born aloft by God by virtue of His Light, His Grandeur and His Power...
> (al-Kulayni, al-Katr 1:129-130; Majlisi, B17.7ar258:9-10).

This tradition is commented upon several times in Shaykhi literatures. In one work
Shaykh Al? mad interpreted the four Lights as the four laudatory exclamations (1) subhan Allah
(Glorified be God) being the white [Light-Pillar] (al-abyaor) (2) al-hamdu Illah(Praised be God),
being the Yellow [Light-Pillar] (al-asfar);(3) I a ilaha ila Allah (There is none other God but God),
being the Green [Light-Pillar] (al-akhcfar) and (4) Allah al-akbar (God is Greatest) being the
crimson [Light-Pillar] (al-ahmar). These four Pillars (al-arkan) constitute the totality of
established existence (J'amr akwujeo' al-muqayyad) whose beginning is the First Intellect
(al-'aql al-awwal) and whose end is the dusty earth (al-thura)." God established an [Arch-]
Angel (malak) "for every Pillar so as to bear it"; namely [1] Gabriel [2] Michael [3] Seraphiel
[Isra'fil] and [4] Azazel ( 'Azra'11).

Additionally, Shaykh Ahmed reckoned that "The meaning of [Airs saying] "He [God]
bore it aloft" is that His gravitas was focused into the archangelic beings each having
subsidiary hosts of angels (junac / min malaikaphe number of which none can estimate except

God..." (al-Ahsa'i, Majmo 'a 30:193-215). These colour speculations were very influential upon
the Bab as is evident from the earliest period reflected in the opening paragraphs of his T
Bagara. Many of the subsequent writings of the Bab develop these colour correspondences and
aspects of the tetradic Babi-Baha'i mystico-cosmological colour schemata. It probably lies at
the root of the frequency and symbolism of ahmar / hamra (= "red" or "crimson" as SE*
frequently translated it) in Babi-Bahal texts. This latter word was certainly important for the
Bab and BA*. The former, for example, even used the four isolated letters (hurefat al-
muqatta'at)171-M-R-A (= "red" when conjoined and vowelled) before three saras of his first
major book the Qayyüm al-asma' (--> QA sOras 34, 56, 57, 76) and reckoned the ahl al-baha'
("people of beauty-glory") to be inmates of an eschatological "Crimson Ark" (safinat al-hamra).
The latter ark dwellers were regarded by BA* as alluding to his followers (Bahals) who
subscribed to a covenant known as the "Crimson Book".

Shaykh Ahmad made considerable use of the obscure lshraqi rooted term (<-- 5.2)
C... j      Horcialya / Hawaqalya (loosely, "interworld"), the origin and etymology of which
remains uncertain. Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, Mandaean, Syriac and Arabic-Persian etymologies
have all been proposed (Dehkhoda Lughat-namih, furgalya; Muhammad Mo'in,1955).
Recently Macuch has suggested that HOrcialya may be a garbled form of the Mandaic *anhür
qalya- (= "the burning light",1982:19f). Alternatively, as argued below and despite the absent
Arabic J ( "I", /am) and the Hebrew 3.),         ji.A, could be a slightly garbled transliteration

of the biblical Hebrew lip -o (ha"-raq)'a' , with the definite article), traditionally translated "the
firmament" (AV). Echolng Mir Damad Shaykh Ahmad has explained the significance and
linguistic derivation of hürqalya in the following manner:

> As for the expression Lail j (horcialya) and its meaning. It is another
> dominion since what is indicated thereby is the world of the isthmus ( -Nam al-
> barzakh) and this mundane world ((a/am al-dunya). It is indicative of the world
> of bodies ('a/am al-ajsam), that is to say, the mundane world ('a/am al-dunya)
> and the world of souls (Nam a/-attics); the world of the kingdom ('a/am al-
malaküt) and the world of the ithmus ('a/am al-barzakh) which is the

intermediary [sphere] between the mundane world ('a/am al-dunya) and the
> world of the kingdom ('a/am al-malaküt)which is another dominion... it is in the
eighth clime (al-kfirm al-thamin)..

As for what language this term is in. It [113 j j_A] is derived from the
> Syriac language (al-lughat al-suryaniyya) and is a Sabean term (lughat al-
> sabla) and they [the Sabeans = Mandaeans] are now living in Basra... Know
> also that the world of the isthmus (a/Gm al-barzakh) is intermediary between this
> mundane world and the world of the hereafter (al-dunya wal-akhira). It is the
> imaginal world [world of similitudes] (a/am al-mithal) [existing] between the
> world of the kingdom (a/am al-m.9191ot) and this mundane world (al-dunya)..
> (al-Ahsal, MajmCia, 30:308-9; cf. Corbin, 1990:103).

As far as I am aware Babr and Baha'T primary sources do not use the term LA ) j..41 .

They do, however, mention multi-worlds and take eschatological events like individual bodily
resurrection non-literally relative to a spiritualistic cosmology rooted in ShaykhT-Babi writings.
Baha'T texts express belief in subtle bodies and a spiritual understanding of individual and
collective resurrection as well as of the mi'raj (Night Journey) of Muhammad. BA* affirmed the
reality of the concept of 'a/am al-mithal explaining like Shaykh Ah mad that the (Per.) alam-i
mllhal exists between the exalted world of jabarat (the "empyrean") and this mortal realm of
nast7t (Ma'idih 1:18-19). The Bob, BA* and his son AB* all in various ways commented upon
the significance of the quranic cosmological term barzakh (isthmus, Q. 23:100; 25:53; 55:20;

II 6.2 The Bible and Isralliyyat in works of Sayyid Kazim RashtT (d.1260/1844).

With the passing of Shaykh Ahmad in 1241/1826, his charismatic disciple and appointed
successor Sayyid Kazim Rashti defended his master against charges of heresy and wrote
over 100 works in continuation and development of Shaykh Ahmad's perspectives. Preference
for the deep, sometimes arcane dimensions of gnostic Shrism are evident in his Arabic and
Persian writings the bulk of which remain unpublished (Fihrist, Pt.2: 288-359; Nicholas, 1914
[Pt.II] 32-36; MacEoin, RashtT, E1 2). Among his most important works is the bulky Sharh al-
qagda al-lamiyya (Commentary on an Ode rhyming in the letter L'). Written in 1258/1842 it is
a commentary upon a qa,srda of 'Abd al-BaqT AffandT al-MawsulT (d.1278/1861). The often
abstruse Shari) al-khutba al-tutunjiyya comments on about half of the Sermon of the Gulf

(2.2<--; lithographed, 1270/1853-4) ascribed to Imam 'All. Sayyid Kazim's commentaries on
quranic texts and Shi s T traditions include his tafsTrs on the basmala and upon the Shisi
graphic form of al-Ism al-a'zam (the Mightiest Name of God) as well as the Tafsir ayat al-
kursT (Commentary on the Throne Verse, Q. 2:255) and the Shady du'ä al-slmat
(Commentary on the Prayer of the Signs). As with the writings of Shaykh Ahmad those of
Sayyid Kazim contain novel interpretations of prophetological, angelological, eschatological
and other facets of Islamic learning.

Non-literal, spiritualistic interpretations of Isralliyyat motifs and qi;sas al-anbiya-
episodes are quite common in the writings of Sayyid Kazim. Allegorical, typological and
imamological interpretations of interest are found scattered throughout his writings. The nature
of his possible knowledge of the Bible is currently unknown, partly due to the scarcity of
available writings. It seems likely that it was subsumed by a Shiite quranocentric and
imamocentric stance that rendered knowledge of the canonical Judaeo-Christian Bible
irrelevant. I have not been able to find any definite evidence of his explicit knowledge of the
Bible.

Important in this respect would be an examination of Sayyid Kazim's Risala 1.7ujjat al-
baligha (Compelling Demonstrative Treatise) completed on the 25th MDT' 1, 1257 / 17 May
1841\. IbrahTmi in his Ahrist describes it as written 'In reply to Sayyid Ahmad, in refutation of
the Jews and Christians and the establishment of the prophethood and wllaya of the [twelver]
Imams... and on the baseless nature of their divisive factions and the inconsistency of their
party (Ahrist, 310 No.193). The Sayyid Ahmad addressed here cannot be Sayyid Ahmad Khan
(1817-1898) but might be the ShT'T mujtahid and Am p- Sayyid Ahmad of Lucknow (India

_
[Pakistan] d.??) who was involved in dialogue with Jews and Christians.'
At one point in his Sharh al-qasTda Sayyid Kazim dwells at some length upon several

'Apparently printed in the 19th century, I been unable to locate a copy of this text. The Sayyid
Ahmed of Lucknow referred to above had a good knowledge of the Bible. This is evident in his
correspondence with Joseph Wolff dated 1833 (Wolff, R&ML [1835]: 385-391.

quranic terms representative of pre-Islamic scripture mentioned in the qasfda of 'Abd al-Baqi
(d.1278/1861):

> This Zabor (Psalter) and that Torah (al-tawriyya) and the Evangel (IWO. Nay!
> indeed! such is the Qur'an revealed.

Making no reference at all to the Bible, Rashti comments that revealed scripture, is
given to all prophets and sent messengers who deliver it according the languages and the
capacity of their peoples. Viewed spiritually, with the "eye of God", there would be evident "the
mystery of the testimony of wisdom and the unveiling the divine secrets (arsar al-llahiyyar .
This such that all revelation could be seen as the expression of a single "point", a singularity
realizable by the seeker of the type referred to in the hadith al-nawafil who is especially
beloved of God (<-3.2). Bypassing many esoteric details about various worlds, their locations
and an account of the fall of Adam and the subsequent decadence of humanity after Cain's
murder of Abel, RashtT comes to underline the myriad, the "seventy and seven" exterior and
interior levels of meaning which aspects of reality may have. He then returns to the numerous
significances of the archetypal term "Book" (kitab) which can indicate a generative reality
(takenT) as well as something integrative and holistic (tadwInT) like the Q. (Sh-Qadida, 167-

The single, yet holistic, all encompassing Q. is viewed as the locus of reality. It retains
its uniqueness despite its having been outwardly written in various languages (Kufic, Syriac and
Greek, etc) and in diverse handwriting styles or scripts (Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Indian scripts,
Ethiopic, etc). Though there may be myriad expressions of the Q. as the "Speaking Q." (al-
altiq) it remains a single reality, as the "Silent Q." (al-samit). This holistic (tadwInf)unitative,
singular quranic reality may also be expressed by the terms Torah (tawrat), Evangel (Gospel/
IV) and Zabür (Scripture/Psalter) (Sh-Qasida, 1704).

On the Zabar(Psalter) Sayyid Kazim comments that it is a book sent down i unto David
though not one establishing a religious law (sharfa) thereby abrogating what proceeded it, a
qanan' (legal code') or a namas an (*divine law' cf. Gk. nomos) supplementing it. Books

establishing a sharT'a law are listed as tawriyya (Torah, HB), Injil (Gospel[s]), ..Suhuf (Scrolls)
of Abraham, Suhuf (Scrolls) of Noah and ..50,7uf (Scrolls) of Adam as well as the Q. of
Muhammad. 0 ther prophets communicated non-legalistic books of various kinds (Sh-
Qadida,171). The basis of all these books is said the be the Q. which is an all-encompassing
book according to its own testimony. A tradition from Imam 'Ali begins, "All that is in the world
(a/-'a/am) is in the Qur'an" (Sh-Qasida, 172-3).

This holistic view of the Q and pre-Islamic scripture asserted by Sayyid Kazim in his
Sharh al-Qa tsTda is very similar in focus to that articulated by the poet and mystical theosopher
'Abd al-Rahman Jami when commenting upon as aspect of one of the "ringstones" of the
FU,SOIS   al-hikam of Ibn al-'Arabi. It will be argued below that this integrative, holistic view of
divine revelation is also the Bab's view of pre-Islamic sacred scripture (-->7.1f)

Islamicate, often Sufi oriented citations from the Bible / Injil are also found in Sayyid
Kazim's writings. They often appear to have no straightforward relationship to NT texts. Like
those of Shaykh Ahmed they originate in earlier, often esoteric Islamic literatures. In the course
of commenting on the controversial words (toned down in a recent printing--> bib.) of 'Ali, "I
saw God and Paradise.." in his Sh-tutunAyya, for example, Sayyid Kazim quotes a saying of
the Injil exactly as it is found in Bursi's Mashariq but with the following addition,

> I am the theophany of the [divine] Essence (guhar al-dhat) through the unique
> Word (brl-kalam al-mutafarrid)." (Sh-tutunjiyya, 299, cf, Bursi, Mashariq,188).

This alleged quotation from the injil seems a distinctly Islamicate corrective to John 1:1. Jesus
is not God but a divine theophany through the "Word".
II Shaykhi allegorism and Moses-Sinai motifs

The founding fathers of the Shaykhi movement were criticized by their more rigidly
orthodox shn contemporaries for their allegedly unwarranted allegorism. In, for example, the
Tiryaq-/fanaq(Discriminating antidote [for poisons]) of 'Abd al-Samad b. s Abdallal4 al-171usayni
al-Mazandarani (written 1301./1883), the mystically-oriented Shaykhi interpretation of Q. 7:143
is singled out for critical comment. (Rafati, n. 6). The Bab and BA*, as indicated however, both

drew on and creatively expounded early Shaykhi non-literal interpretations of this and other
texts and trad-itions relating to Moses' Sinaitic experiences (-->). The importance the Bab and
BA* gave to Moses-Sinai episodes and motifs is closely related to the importance these matters
were given by the architects of Shaykhism.

At various points in his frequently abstruse Sh-tutunifya, Rashtf touches upon
Moses/Sinai motifs. Commenting on Imam 'AIT's words, "He [God] created the oceans (al-
bihar)and the mountains (al-pbal)," he has much to say about the "mountains", mentioning all
kinds of supernatural peaks including a "mountain of red ruby" Cabal al-yaqC/t al-ahmar) and
a "mountain of the mine of gold" Cabal ma idan al-dhahab)which is the "seat of the beams of
the sun" (matrah ashrat al-shams) related to the "Mount of Moses" (tür masa), the "Locale
of Jesus" (manzilisa), the "Ark of Aaron" (tabOt baron), the "Well of Daniel" (tifr danyal) and
the "Station of Assent" (maqam al-iqbal). Also mentioned is a "mountain of lead" Cabal
al-usrub) with an exterior of iron and an interior of gold, Mount Qaf; the "Mountain of Light"
Oabal al-m7r); the "Mountain of the One [God]" Cabal al-ahad) and the "Mountain of Najaf'
gabal al-najaf, in Iraq) which is associated with Mt. Sinai, Mt. Seir and Mt. Paran (Cf. Deut
33:2; DO 'a al-simat; Lambden, 1988:87f)

What Sayyid Kazim has to say about "Mount Sinai" Cabal t Or sina2 is expressive of the
importance of Najaf as the place of the shrine of Imam 'Alf and the locale of the translocation
of Sinai: "As regards Mount Sinai, outwardly and inwardly it is the 'hill of Najaf (rubwa
al-Najaf)". Though he acknowledged that this mountain was traditionally located in Syria or the
"Holy Land" he explained this in terms of a part of the "mountain of Najaf" Cabal al-Najaf)
having become detached and reconstituted piecemeal in the "land of Syria" (ard al-sham). The
"mountain of Najaf" is a part of the "mountain" on which God held converse with Moses,
sanctified Jesus, took Abraham for a "Friend" and reckoned Muhammad as one "Beloved." It
is the "greatest of the mountains of the world" closely related to Mt. Sinai, Mt. eir, and Mt.
Paran.
Following Shaykh Ahmad, the Sayyid considered "Mount Seir" Cabal sa7r) to be the

scene of Jesus's "sanctification" and intimate converse with God (he located it in the Hedjaz,
Western Arabia) and an "edifice" (or dome, qubba) which was "with Moses and like a throne".
The mountain on which God took Abraham for a Friend was either a hill on the slope of Mt.
Mina (near Mecca) where a mosque is built or another mountain in Jerusalem, (Ilya) the Holy
City, in Palestine (Israel). Allegedly a mountain near Mecca, Mount Paran (Jabal al-faran) was
the place where "sanctified myriads" (nbwat al-muqaddasin) of angels beyond the ken of the
Cherubim appeared to Muhammad. A scene of the divine theophany, "Mount Paran" is also
further mystically interpreted and translocated in Babi-Baha'T texts (Lambden, 1983b, Appen.).

In the course of expounding phrases within the Sermon of Gulf, Sayyid Kazim also
makes occasional reference to Q. 7:143 and to the ShrT tradition about the proto-ShIl-Cherub
being the agent of the Sinaitic theophany (<--). He largely follows what Shaykh Abrnad had
stated about this, namely that God created his prophets in the image of a specific Cherub and
gave them corresponding names:

> Thus Noah... bore the image and name of one of them [the Cherubim], that is
> to say, Noah was named with his name. And Abraham bore the image and
> name of one of them. Moses also bore the image and name of one of them and
> it was the one which "revealed its glory before the mountain" (tajalla 111-jabal,
> Q. 7:143b) at the time when Moses asked his Lord that which he asked [to see
> Him]. He reduced it to dust. Jesus likewise bore the image and name of one of
> them [the cherubim]. It was by virtue of that [specific] cherub that Jesus was
> able to cure the blind and the leprous and revive the dead" (al-Absal, Sh.

Ztkara, 3:361; cf. MajmO s a 30:64f).

Commenting on God's having singled out the Prophet Muhammad from the "Supreme
Centre" (al-buhbaha al-'ulya) in the light of Q. 3:33 and other traditions, Sayyid Kazim speaks
of the "heart" (al-qalb) and the "self" (al-nafs) as pivotal realities. The core of the being of the
Prophet Muhammad is his transcendent al-nafs(Self) which is the locus of the divine theophany
(al-mutajalli bll-ahad)'a) as the nafs-Allah (Self of God). When God created Imam 'Ali' this
elevated "Self" was further manifested in him. Both 'AIT and Muhammad are associated with

the same   created, though divine, "Self" (nafs)and "Essence" (dhat). On one level it was thus
Imam 'All who conversed with Moses from the Sinaitic Tree (al-shajarat)and uttered the words

"I, verily am God." He was the one who appeared "before and to Moses through his Light" as
one of the "men of the Cherubim." The theophany gajalli) of Imam 'Ali- before Moses from the
"Tree" was "the essence of the theophany of God" ('ayn tajalliN/ah)within the Israelite Prophet
(Sh-Tutunjiyya, 92)..

In further explaining the significance of the theophany unto Moses, Sayyid Kazim states
that the proto-Shn Cherub mentioned by Imam Ja'far (<--) is symbolic of the nafs masa ("Self
of Moses"). He has disclosed this "mystery" in view of the fact that a theophany (al-tajalli) unto
something is only possible through the "self' (nafs) of that thing (Sh-Tutunjiyya, 94). On
similar lines is the Sayyid's teaching that the number and names of the angelic host of the
Cherubim are the same as those of the prophets (al-anb)'a): "That man [Cherub] who
revealed himself unto Moses (tajalli li-mOsa) such that Moses fell down in a swoon [-->Q.7:143]
was named Moses". On another level however, the cherubic being who appeared to Moses
was the reality of such Prophets as the "First and Last Adam" (adam al-awwa/ wa7-äkhid (Sh-
Tutunflyya, 94) The Cherubim are the archetypal realities of the prophets possessed of an
essential oneness. Moses thus experienced the theophany (tajalli)of his celestial "Self' (nafs)
as a cherub who may be thought of as Imam 'All or one of the prophets who partake of the
same pleroma of reality. In reality the theophany (tajallOwas the disclosure of an infinitesimal
glimmer of the radiance that emanated from the angelic body of a cherub numbered among the
messengers "possessors of steadfastness" pi al-'azm) (ibid.,264). Alternatively, the
theophanic radiance which shone forth before Moses on Sinai may be thought of as the "Light"
(nOr) of Muhammad and his family (Sh-futunfiyya, 316; cf. 102-116; 143, 161,168, 186f, etc).

In the light of the above, it will be evident that both Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kazim gave
detailed symbolic and mystical interpretations to Moses/Sinai motifs, sometimes in line with
those set forth by I bn al-'ArabT and frequently informed by imamological speculations. On one
level Mount Sinai all but becomes the interior reality of Moses or the inmost ' heart of the
believer, and the theophany on the Mount the shining forth of the Divine Light upon it.

II Other writings of Sayyid Kazim

The Sh-Qasida of Rashti is well-know for its abstruse, highly theosophical depiction
of the levels (mahalla), regions and inhabitants of a spiritual universe, pictured as a celestial
city (al-madina). The primary locale (al-mahalla al-Ola) of this "City" is the level of the divine
Unity" (mahalla al-tawhid) with its category of uniqueness and singularity. The second level
is that of the locus of the Greatest Name (al-mahalla al-ism al-a'zam) also named that of the
most ancient Light (al-nor al-aqdam), the halting point of the world (waqf al-'Nam), the
Interiority of the Mystic Meaning (al-sirral-ma'ana and the secret cipher of the benevolent (al-
ramz al-munannam? text unclear) (Sh-QasTda, 119-120). This illustrates the elevated status
that the "mightiest Name of God" had for Sayyid Kazim (-->).

Different regions of this multi-faceted celestial, cosmic "City" according to the Sh. al-
qasida are overseen by various named human or superhuman creatures who often have
complicated Arabic names. The Sh. al-qasida appears to incorporate Islamicate motifs rooted
in Isralliyyat traditions. The angelological names allotted certain of the masters of the "City" are
often similar to those found in al-BOni's Shams al-ma'anf (<--). They sometimes terminate with
the Arabic transliteration of the suffix   5zi ('el = Ar. ji ) indicative of the Hebrew name of
God (cf. the biblical and quranic Jibrall = Gabriel, the 'Might of God'). Other "lords" of the
celestial city have names that are both abstruse and appear to be esoteric neologisms. Level
119 has as its nexus ('knot', 'aqd) the "lord of the verdant land (sahib/hi ard khudra) in the
ultimacy of beauty (nthayatal-baha)whose name consists of the two words H-A-T-L-H-D (and
H-M-All-H [-H] Celestial level 144 is described as a nexus the overseer of which is "a man
possessed of a mighty key (mifiah al-azim), his name being Shama'shall (? pointing
uncertain). Finally, celestial level 170 is governed by a humanoid being ("man", Insan) who

'chairs, seats') Lb sCi Thota (?) and c____,,_..1. (D-H-H-H).

Aside from these highly imaginative angelic and associated name ciphers in the Shari)
al-Qa,sida, RashtT several times refers to the al-ism al-a'gam, the mightiest Name of God.
There are occurrences of this Name modified by several of the superlatives a'gam as it is in
certain supplications of the (Twelver) Imams recorded in Majlisi's Persian zad al-ma 'ad
(Knapsack for the Eschaton) In one instance Sayyid Kazim makes reference to "the Point of
Origination" (al-nuqtat al-Intida ilyya) which God summoned through his Greatest, Mightiest,
Greatest Name (bi-Ismihi al-a'zam al-a'gam al-a'gam). Later in the Sh-Qasida Rashti again
refers to this thrice supremely Great Name of God (Rashti, Sh. Qagda, 34, 90). In both his Kh-
TutunAyya and in a specific treatise he comments upon one of the graphical forms of the
Mightiest Name of God.
II Sayyid '<Om on ShT'T graphical forms of the Mightiest Name of God

Like Shaykh Ati mad and other Shri writers, Sayyid Kazim commented upon one of the
poetical and graphical representations of the al-/Sm al-a'gam ("Mightiest Name of God") of
the kind illustrated below (Fig.1). It sometimes refers to the graphic form of the mightiest Name
the components of which are also given detailed explanations. Such is the case in Sayyid
Kazim's Sharh al-ism al-a .gam (Commentary on the [Graphical form of the] Mightiest Name
[of God]--> bib.)

Both Sunni and Shri sources and esoterica contain traditions which purport to set forth
graphic, sometimes talismanic forms of the ism Allah al-a'gam (Mightiest Name of God). A
dozen or more variant alphabetic, qabbalistic, cryptographic representations of this all-highest
Name are found in the aforementioned Islamic literatures (Winckler, 1930; Anawati,1967). ShT'T
representations of this mightiest Name are often based upon directives spelled out in a tradition
relayed by Ibn 'Abbas (<-3.1) from the first Imam 'Ali. It is cited among others by Mulyi al-Din
al-BOni the occult initiate of arcane computations surrounding the Names and Attriqutes of the

al-BOnT (<--) and in select BabT-Baha'T primary texts before turning briefly to the commentary
of Sayyid Kazim.

In his Shams al-ma'arif al-BOnT associates portions of the poetical-graphical
representation of the Mightiest Name of God with the Bible seen as Judaeo-Christian scripture,
the Tawrat (Torah, Hebrew Bible) and the Injil ("Gospel[s]"). He states that six portions
(letters, ahraf) of the Mightiest Name ( al-ism al-a'zarn) are found in the Torah: namely (1) the
deformed letter "h" .. 6 above], (2) the inverted "w" i [= 7 above] and (3) the four finger-like
lines 1111 [ = 5 above] (total = 6 elements). Two portions (ahraf) of the Mightiest Name

allegedly derive from in the Injil ("Gospel"), (1) the "blind mrm ig. without a tail [= 3
above] and the "ladder" sign [=4 above]. The five qur'anic parts of the mightiest Name
are (1) the initial pentacle * or "seal" and (2) the "three sticks" ('asa) III with a line
above like a "straightened lance" [ = 1 and 2 above = 5 elements).

Both the Bab and BA* were influenced by traditions to the effect that elements or
portions of the al-ism al-a'zam go back to the Hebrew Bible and the InjTI (Gospel) or derive
from pre-Islamic Isralliyyat traditions. In his Tafsir laylat al-qadr (Q. 97) the Bab refers to 3,
4, and 5 portions of the "Mightiest Name", existing in the Hebrew Bible [Torah] (tawrat),
Gospel[s] (injil) and Q. respectively (INBMC 69:17). Similarly, in a Tablet commenting on the
basmala i and first verse of the SOrah of the Pen (Q.68), BA* mentions that God divulged
something (a "letter" half an) of the "Mightiest Name" understood as baha' ("splendour") in
every religious dispensation. In the Islamic era it is alluded to through the letter y        ("B")

which is the first letter of both the basmala and of the word baha'. In the injil it is through the
word      L..Ji   = al) meaning "Father" in Arabic translations of the Gospels, that two of the

The Basmala is an Arabic word indicating the oft-repeated queanic phrase "In the Name of
God, the Merciful, the Compassionate" (Ar., Bismi'llah al-Ratimiin al-Ratirm).

letters of the word baba' are located. BA* also states that it the al-ism al-a'zam as the word
baha' is clearly intimated in the BabT scripture (= "the Bayan" lit. "Exposition"). The Arabic
verbal-noun Baha' as the Mightiest Name, it is added, is representative of the nafs ("Logos-
Self") of God in the Baha'T dispensation (INBMC 56:25).

Sayyid Kazim's imamologically oriented commentary on the poetical and graphic
Isralliyyat rooted traditions regarding the symbol of the Mightiest Name' cannot be discussed
in detail here save to note that he also draws upon allegedly pre-Islamic dimensions of
traditions about the Mightiest Name of God. RashtT commences his commentary by
acknowledging his indebtedness to the upright, pious and sagacious master named Shaykh
Muhammad Ahmad (= Shaykh Ahmad?/ Al-BOnT?). Through him he was informed that
"certain of the religious communities (al-milli) are aware of portions of the words (al-kalimat)
constituting the Mightiest Name (al-ism al-a'zam)'. It is stated that they are evident in
"fourteen temples" (hayakil), apparently indicating the Shrite pleroma of Muhammad, Fatima
and the 12 Imams. Differentiated or subdivided into thirteen "letters" after the thirteen individual
elements constituting the seven graphic sigla (<--) which make up the mightiest Name of God
(counting from the initial pentacle (*) to the inverted waw) eight portions out of the 13 were
known to the pre-Islamic communities. Four elements ("letters") derive from the Tawrat, (the
Torah, Hebrew Bible) and four from the WTI ("Gospel"), the other five derive from the Q.
(4+4+5 =13). Sayyid Kazim's explanations of these components of the al-ism al-a'zam are
distinctly imamological. (Rashti, Sh-lsm, 271 aff). .

The Sayyid further explains how it is that the Torah has four "letters" of the Mightiest
Name. He explains that this is so in the light of the following well-known prophetic tiadith , "0
'AR you   are to me after the manner of Aaron to Moses". A typological relationship is thus set
up between Moses and Muhammad. Moses [= Muhammad], it is explained, is foundational (asl

commentary (5h-ism, f.271b) has an extra pentalpha ( *) to the left of the inverted wsw.

an), the Reality (al-haqTqa), while the Torah (al-tawrat) before him is his essential persona
(asala dhat an). Moses the prophet (al-nabT) is essentially the Moses of the gate of reality upon
reality (haqTqa). In a metaphorical sense the reality of the Torah which was revealed before him
consists of four letters which are the four lettered personal name Muhammad (= M-171-M-D).
The manifestation of the name Muhammad before Moses took place at the Sinaitic theophany
(tajallf) of the Lord (= Q. 7:143). The agent of this theophany is again said to have been an
individual from among the cherubim (raja/ min a/karublyyTn)(<--) evidently one associated with
the name Muhammad (Rashti, Sh.lsm, 273b).

That four letters of the al-ism al-a'zam are found in "the Injil of Jesus son of Mary" is
also commented upon by Sayyid Kazim. He states, "And he [Jesus] is the likeness (mitha/)of
[Imam] 'AV This typological equation also has to do with the letters of the mightiest Name
being imamologically realized. That Imam 'Ali is equated with Jesus finds echoes in the writings
of the Bab (-->P.Bay. VIII:2). Five "letter" components of Mightiest Name are also allotted to
the Q. They are imamologically understood as representing four twelver Imams, Hasan,
Flusayn, Ja'far Sadiq, Mosa and the prophet's daughter Fatima. At one point in his
commentary on the Khutba al-tutunRyya Sayyid Kazim also interprets the seven graphic sigla
of the Mightiest Name imamologically, as [1] Muhamad, and six of the Imams, [2] 'Ali, [3]
Fatima [4] ITI asan, [5] 171 usayn, [6] Ja'far and [7] Masa. These seven are indicative of the
fullness, the pleroma of the fourteen immaculate ones (Sh.Ttnj : 53).

It is also interesting to note that Sayyid Kazim gives the seventh item, the inverted letter
waw j a messianic significance stating that it "alludes to the [messianic] Proof (al-hujjat), the
son of 171 asan [al-AtkarT, the 11th Imam, d. c. 260/874]". The central (hidden) letter "A" (alit)
of the three letters of waw when spelled out in full (= J I j ) represents the Qa'im (Ariser) as one
"stationed between the two gulfs (tutunjayn), the isthmus (barzakh) between the two worlds".
This mode of exegesis is also taken up in Babi-Bahal scripture, most notably in the Qayy0m
al-asma' of the Bab and (<-2.2) and, for example, the al-Kitab al-aqdas ( "Most Holy Book"

c. 1873) and Lawh-i Hirtik of BA* (-->bib.).
• 6.3 The Bab and the BabT-Bahal exaltation of the first two Shaykhs.

From the foregoing it should be evident that Babi doctrine has its immediate and most
central roots in Shaykhism. The Bab sparked off an initially neo-ShaykhT millenarian faction.
By the mid. 19th century this had evolved into a neo-Shri but post-Shaykhi socially and
doctrinally radical religious movement.

Siyyid 'Air Muhammad the founder of the Ban movement was born in Shiraz (S.E.Iran)
on October 20th 1819 / 1st Muharram, 1235 AH. He was the only son of Fatima Bagam and
Siyyid Muhammad Ricia (c.1778?- c.1820/182617??), a descendant of Imam H usayn and
merchant in the Shiraz bazaar (B*: K.Fihrist: 339-40). When his father passed away the
youthful Bab (then perhaps 5-6 years old?) was supervised by his maternal uncle Hajji MTrza
Siyyid 'All (d.1850). The elementary schooling of the Bab began around 1826 under the
tutelage of a Shaykhi teacher known as Shaykh 'Abid (d. c.1846-7) in ShIraz. The Bab would
doubtless have been instructed in rudimentary basics; special attention being paid to
calligraphic excellence and the rote recitation of the Arabic Q. Like Muhammad, the Bab in
various later writings claimed to be al-ummf ("unlettered" Q. 7:157f) though one possessed of
innate divine knowledge and subject to wahy ("divine inspiration").

The Bab's deep religiosity, visionary experiences and ShaykhT associations moved him,
on the evening of May 22nd 1844 (1260 AH) to confide in the leading Shaykhi Mulla Husayn
Bushal'T that he was the "gate" (bab, hence his title) through whom communication with the
hidden, messianic twelfth Imam, the Dhikr, ('Remembrance'), was possible. He claimed to be
his earthly representative (na ith) and the successor to Siyyid Kazim who had passed away in
January 1844 without clearly nominating a successor. Though hesitant Mulla H usayn accepted
the Bab's claims. So too several other of his ShaykhT associates and companions who
constituted the bulk of the earliest disciples of the Bab variously designated sabigan
("forerunners", Q. 56:10-11) and huraN hayy (hayy = abjad 18 hence the 18 "letters of the
living").

Though not merely neo-ShaykhT, Babi-Baha'T origins, hermeneutics and doctrine were
markedly influenced by the teachings of the first two Shaykhs, Shaykjh Ahmad and Sayyid
Kazim. Details of the extent of this doctrinal influence upon the Bab and BA* in their writings
has yet to be adequately and systematically studied. The alleged messianically and
eschatologically immanent stance of these first two Shaykhs along with their theosophical-
imamological, ShET hermeneutical perspectives underpin key aspects of Babi and Bahal
doctrine. In particular their non-literal interpretations of quranic texts and Shis i doctrines and
practises foreshadow and echo subsequent Babi-Baha'T demythologizations of Islamic and
other teachings. As will be seen, certain of the first Shaykhs' citations from Islamicized
Judaeo-Christian scripture, especially the InjTI (Gospels) are repeated in BabT-Bahal
scripture. Their interpretations of Moses-Sinai motifs and concepts surrounding the ism Allah
al-a'gam inform or are found in new forms in BabT-Baha'T primary sources.

The Bab attended Sayyid Kazim's classes in Karbala for between 6 and 9 months. He
came to refer to him just prior to his 1260/1844 declaration in his R. ffl-sulak (Treatise on the
Path) as "my lord, support and teacher" ( sayykil wa muYammacilwa muallimf)(R-Sul0k, 74).
Awhile later in an early prayer in response to eschatological and other questions he referred
to himself as a 1.7amil al-71m (bearer of knowledge) like Sayyid Kazim (TBA 6003C:188-9). Later
in the course, however, of establishing his own theophanic claims and independent religion
he distanced himself doctrinally from the Shaykhr leaders. He also invited his ShaykhT rival and
first major opponent KarTm Khan-I Kirmani (d. 1870) to embrace his path in a nuumber of
important letters (MacEoin,1982:16ff).

As a BabT (= follower of the Bab) BA* referred to the architects of what became the
ShaykhT school of SW' Islam in very elevated terms. In his Kitab-I Tqan (c.1861) they are the
nOran—i nayyTrayn ( "twin luminous lights" KI:51/65). Using Sufi terminology in the same
treatise BA* also applied to Shaykh Anmad and Sayyid Kazim (as well as other harbingers of
new religions) the epithet (Per.) insan-i kamil (= Ar. al-insan al-kamil, 'The Perfect Human'),
a term of central importance in the cosmology and theophanology of the school of Ibn al-'Arabi

indicative of the advanced gnostic (KI:51/tr. 42 [66]). The first two Shaykhs of Shaykhism are
the shams-i huviyya (The Sun of the lpseity) and qamr-i al.7acliyya (Moon of the Divine
Oneness)(KI I51/tr.65). In a much later Persian passage addressed to a certain Ahmad BA*
wrote:           Out of the bosom of Islam many were submerged in the ocean

of idle fancies of vain imaginings. Subsequent to [the era] of the
> seal of the prophets (khatam-i anbiya' = Muhammad) and to the
> purified [twelver] Imams two souls attained unto the real truth (bi-
haqq) and were embellished with the ornament of awareness

(1,1-taraz-1 agghT), [namely] the late Shaykh [Ahmad al-Ahsa'T]
> and the Sayyid [Kim RashtT]... We [BA*] were [mystically] with
> these two and heard from them both what cannot have resulted
> from aught save God... They attained unto the dawning-point of
> grace and the dawning-place of knowledge.. (Maldih 4:134-5)
Numerous BabT and Baha'T sources picture the twin founders of the Shaykhi school as
being especially conscious of an imminent eschaton, the near advent of the messianic Qa'im
or Mandi whose nature and activities they variously predicted. ZarandT, for example, has
Shaykh Ahmad quit Arabia and Iraq as a result of the mysterious call of Iran, the birthplace of
the Bab, Shiraz being especially redolent of the aura of the coming one (DB: 4f; cf. the
(Shaykhi?) RiSala of Qatii b. al-Karbala'T). The cryptic eschatology of early Shaykhism has
yet to be systematically studied (-->). It is hard to back up many aspects of these alleged
eschatologically charged dimensions to the teachings of the first two Shaykhs since no detailed
study of their eschatology has been attempted. A recently published two hundred or so page
K al-reat (Book of the Return) of Shaykh Ahmad does not differ markedly if at all from
mainstream twelver Shi' ite eschatological-apocalyptic norms.

The third KirmanT ShaykhT leader 1-.1ajji Mirza Muhammad Karim Khan KirmanT
(1232/1816-1288/1871) was a long-standing opponent of the Bab and BA* against whom he
wrote something like 15 books and treatises from 1845 until his death. A polymathic individual
he also wrote a good deal on numerous subjects as well as on prophetological matters and
on certain Isralliyyat traditions and the Bible. Aside from his fifteen or more anti-BabT-Baha'T
works he authored, for example, a tract on YajOj and majoj (Gog and Magog) as well as a
response to questions about biblical interpretation raised by the Bab' Mull Jamal in BA's K-I

Tgan. (MRF 2: 207-59). Here he shows a remarkable and direct knowledge of the Bible and of
certain 19th century Sta s i polemical exchanges with missionaries.

Karim Khan Kirmani was also able to directly quote numerous passages from the
canonical bible in his 1266/1849 Persian Kitab-i nusrat al-din (Book of the Victory of Religion)
which appears to have been written in response to the Tariq al-hayat (printed in Persian at
Agra in 1847) of the Christian missionary, Carl Gottlieb Pfander (<-5.1), a work which is
largely concerned with the evangelical exposition of sin and salvation.' At several points in his
reply Karim Khan applies biblical prophecies to Muhammad and the rise of Islam (K. Nusrat:
293-328 is wholly devoted to this subject). This, as will be seen, contrasts markedly with the
Bab who, as will be argued, appears to have chosen not to cite the Bible at all.

In his K Nusrat al-din KarTm Khan (see p. 2ff) does not clearly identify the "Padre" (a common
designation for Christian missionaries) against whom he writes or the title of his book. Other later Kirmani
Shaykhr leaders also had some dialogue with Christian missionaries and cited the Bible (Lambden, 1983b:
22ff).

CHAPTER SEVEN
THE BAB, PRE-ISLAMIC SCRIPTURE AND THE BIBLE
• 7.1 Pre-Islamic scripture in the writings of the Bab

That the Bab had contact with Jews and Christians of ShTraz and had been influenced
by the NT in Persian translation has been asserted by some early European writers upon
Babism. Many were under the influence of statements made by the French diplomat and
amateur orientalist J. A. Comte de Gobineau (d.1882). He underscored the derivative nature
of the teachings of the Bab in chapter six of his Les Religiones et les Philosophies (1st ed.
Paris 1865 [19281:133-4). Gobineau could not imagine, despite his very limited knowledge of
the Bab's writings, Babism originating outside of a western, Judaeo-Christian sphere of
influence. This is clear from one of his letters to Prokesch-Osten (d. 1876) (Momen, 1981:23-

Few, apart from the Turkologist Armin Vambery (d.1914), were aware of the meagre
knowledge of Gobineau in matters philological, religious and "orientalist": Persons influenced
by him include, for example, the Italian physician Michele Lessona (d.1894) who states in his
I Bahr (written 1870's? pub. Turin 1881) that the Bab had contact with the Jews and
Zoroastrians of ShTraz and had read the NT in Persian missionary translation (Lessona [1881]
1981:11, 36-37, 460. 2 Persian writers were also directly or indirectly influenced by Gobineau
whose Les Religiones... was translated into Persian. The sentences alleging the Bab's doctrinal
indebtedness to Jews and to the NT are also reproduced by the Jewish writer 171 abTb Lavi
(d.1984) in his multi-volume Tarlkh-i yahDd-i Iran ("History of the Jews of Iran, 3 vols) (Tarikh
I11:604-5).3

See Vambery's review of Browne's edition and translation of AB*'s Sayyah where he makes
some scathing remarks about Gobineau, reckoning him "no Orientalist at all". In his opinion Gobineau
merely "worked with the assistance of a Mirza and a learned Akhond of Teheran" (Vannbery, 1892:215).
2 The unpublished trading accounts of the Bab apparently confirm Zoroastrian connections as Browne
had speculated in his index to the Persian Bayan (Browne, Nuqtat al-Kaf, XCIII-IV).

The recent English abridged translation of this Lavi history (-->bib. Lavi / Ebrahami tr.

Maschke) omits all of the considerable space given in the 3rd , volume original to Jewish and Babi-Baha'T
matters.

The supposition of Jewish and NT influence has been repeated in various ways
throughout the late19th and 20th centuries. Even Edward G. Browne (d.1926) the renowned
Cambridge orientalist and one-time expert on the BabT religion, inaccurately furthered alleged
NT links to the doctrinal teachings of the Bab as will be seen in detail below (-->). The origins
and doctrinal bases of the Babi religion are rather more complicated than the often simplistic
theories of the19th century orientalists with their limited access to primary sources. The
doctrines of the Bab cannot be wholly or adequately accounted for on the basis of Jewish
associations, Western influences, Gospel study or even an alleged link with Zoroastrians or
with such Russians as the diplomat Dmitrii I. Dolgorukov (d. Moscow 1867). It will be argued
here that there is very little if anything in the Bab's own writings that confirms NT influence,
though high irfanT ("gnostic") theosophical streams of influence are much in evidence in his
numerous, very largely Arabic, and Persian writings.

Concrete evidence in the primary sources for the Bb's knowledge of the Bible/ NT is
wholly lacking. There is not a great deal that presupposes either Jewish or Zoroastrian influence
either.' He never directly cites the HB in Arabic, Persian or any Jewish writers or literatures of
any period. It was the Bab's mercantile associations with Jews or simply unfounded Muslim
attitudes that in large measure account for these early European statements about the sources
of the Bob's inspiration and Babi doctrine. Muslims generally, it should be borne in mind,
viewed Jews with suspicion or contempt and regarded them as unclean (naiis). Having Babism
derive therefrom was tantamount to dismissing it as unfounded nonsense of dubious origin.

Evidence is lacking in both the primary and secondary historical sources for sustained
and direct contact between the Bab and Jews. Jewish converts to Babism during the Bab's
lifetime appear to have been non-existent. Though Babism from the beginning presented itself
as a neo-ShT s i phenomenon with a message for all humankind (QA 1, etc) only a handful of six

KhurasanT Jewish converts of the early 1850s (?) are known (Bushr01, T-Khurasan: 86ff; cf.

1 It is not impossible that Gobineau's one-time Persian teacher and Jewish informant on Babism, Mulla
Lalizar (Eleazar) HamadanT was aware of the Bab's links with Jews and informed Gobineau accordingly.

Petal- , 1997:76f).

In this chapter the opinions of the Bab about pre-Islamic scripture will be surveyed. In
this light some idea of the nature of the Bab's alleged knowledge of the Bible / Gospels/NT will
be gleaned. After analysing the Bb's own statements, the positive perspectives about his
knowledge of the Bible/NT put forward by the Cambridge orientalist E.G. Browne (1864-1926)
and the contemporary Yale historian Abbas Amanat will be shown to be without sound
historical or textual foundation.

Islamic messianism has it that an expected MandT-Qa'im would be fully aware of the
location of the lost, genuine pre-Islamic scripture and come to rule non-Muslims in accordance
with its dictates. Both Sunni and Shn traditions state that he would be guided to this pristine,
uncorrupted Judaeo-Christian scripture. Matar b. Muhammad Tahman al-Warraq (d.
125/743?) transmitted traditions from Ka s b al-Ah bar to the effect that the Mandi was so named
because he would be guided (yuhda) to find copies of the original texts of the Torah and the
Gospel concealed in a cave in Antioch (Madelung El 2 V:1232b). A parallel shn tradition from
the 5 th Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir, as recorded by al-Nu'mani (d.360/970-1) in his Kliab al-
ghayba (Book of the Occultation), reads as follows:

> When al-Qa'im from the family of the Prophet will rise he will distribute equally
> among the people and will establish justice among his subjects... he will be
> called al-Mandi, the one who will guide, since he will guide to the secret matters
> (any al-khaft) and will bring out the Torah and other books of God from a cave
> in Antioch and will rule the people of the Torah according to the Torah, and the
> people of the Gospel according to the Gospel, and the people of the Qur'an
> according to the Qur'an (K. Ghayba, 164; cited Sachedina, 61). 1

Other Shi s i traditions associate the Qa'im with varieties of the jafr about which there

'.   2

are numerous traditions. It is sometimes portrayed as a divinatory, "unwritten" sacred scroll

Note also. "The Mandi will.., bring forth the Ark of the Divine Presence (tabot al-sakina) from
a cave in Antioch in which are the Torah which God sent down to Moses and the Gospel which he sent
down to Jesus, and, he will rule among the People of the Torah according to their Torah and among the
People of the Gospel according to their Gospel".

inscribed upon cow hide containing the knowledge of the pre-Islamic prophets, learned
Israelites [= Isra'Tliyyat materials] and the secrets of future events (Bihar 2 1:238f; cf. 47:270ff).
The messianic Qa'im was expected to appear in possession of varieties of this jafr described
in Shis T traditions from Imam Ja s far al-Sadiq and others as;
(1)      al-jafr al-abyacl (the white jafr), pure recensions of (Abrahamic scripture):

> the suhuf of Abraham, the tawrat (Torah) of Moses, the zabür ("Psalter") of
> David and the infil(Gospel) of Jesus as well as the mushaf (Scroll) of Fatima;

(2)    al-jafr al-ahmar( the red jafr) a bag containing the weaponry (al-sahah) of the

> prophet Muhammad or the messianic Qa'im as the sahlb al-sayf (bearer of
> the sword).

Responding to a question about jafr al-Ahsa'T (<--4.4) had it that this would be the
exclusive inheritance of the messianic Qa'im. Imam 'All had inherited the recognized jafr as
the ilm al-hural (science of letters) from Muhammad via Gabriel when upon Mt. Paran Cabal
faran)(JK. 1/ii:87-8). The Bab claimed knowledge of the secrets of this jafr in the sense of
numerical, talismanic or gematric insight (cf. K. Panj :310, 429ff). 1 He did not, as far as I am
aware, refer to any cave in Antioch or to the concrete discovery of lost pre-Islamic scripture.
In certain of his writings, however, he does claim that God taught him the knowledge of pre-
Islamic scripture. Probably presupposing this we read in his SOrat ab .ama'(SOrah of the Divine
Cloud"= QA 10): "We, verily, sent down [for the Bab] the verses which are in the suhuf
(ancient scrolls)" (10:32). In this same surah the QA is also represented as a "Book" confirming
and summing up "all that God sent down upon the prophets and the righteous ones in all the
[previous] alwah( 'revealed tablets' ) (10:32). In an exegetical rewrite of Q. 3:48 in QA 3 the
Bab states,

> God hath assuredly taught you [the Bab] the knowledge of the Book (Wm al-
> kitäb) from the Furqan [= Q.] the Injil, the Tawrat, the ZabOr and what
> preceded them of the suhuf (pre-Mosaic scripture) and with your Lord were

Dimensions of jafr referred to by the Imams as Jan- al-Ami ("Comprehensive Jafr") also
indicates modes of gematric prognostication (see [pseudo-Imam] 'Ali", 1987). This jafr is mentioned by
BA* in his L. lyurügt al-muqafta'a (-->bib).

the letter "B" (al-b.12 (QA 3:11).1

In Islamo-BabT and Baha'T belief all revealed scripture is an expression of the will and
Word of God. The knowledge of one sacred book, especially if it is the most recent, is
tantamount to a knowledge of all revealed scripture. A new sacred book is another expression
of the essences of all past revelations. Babi-Baha'T scripture presupposes that a true
understanding of the Bayan and Q. is tantamount to a full awareness of pre-Islamic scripture.
Worth noting in this connection is that during the Bal pT period BA* referred to his 1857-8 S'atilfa-
yi Fatimiyya (Scroll of Fatima) or K maknünth (Hidden Words) as the "inner essence"
Owahlr) of all pre-BabT scripture sent down unto past prophets (al-nablyyen)and clothed by
him in the "garment of brevity" (<-- 2.2.).

The Bab not only mentions that Adam had a revealed kitab ("Book") but, following
mainstream Islamic tradition, affirmed the existence and inspired nature of the whole range of
scripture originating in primordial and post-Abrahamic times. He refers to the suhuf of
Abraham, the Tawngt (Torah) of Moses, the Zabar (Psalms) of David and the Injf1 (Gospel)
of Jesus. In some of his later writings, including the P.Bayan, the Bab refers to these sacred
books after their initial Arabic letters: Tawrat ="book of T" (tig i )',- Zabar= "book of Z" ( za')"
and IV = "book of "A" (alift (P.Bay. 3:13, etc).
II Pre- Islamic scripture in the Qayyam al-asma' (mid. 1844).

References to pre-Islamic scripture in the QA of the Bab (<-2.1) are largely rooted in
the Q. as exegetically rewritten so as to express a neo-Islamic and post-quranic, Shi'T ta'wil
(non-literal dimension). In the QA Sarat al-rukn (Sara of the Pillar) the Bab states that Moses
received the Tawrat on Sinai and Jesus personally received the divinely revealed Injr1 direct
"from heaven" (min al-saing 2. These works are said to contain eschatologically suggestive
references to the Dhikr and to concealed Tablets:                                            I

Qur'an 3:48 on which this is based reads: "And He (God) will teach him (Jesus) the Book (al-kitäb),
the Wisdom (hikmat), the Tawratand the Injil".

> We, verily, gave Moses the Book and We preserved him in his youth until the
> time set in the book transpired... And We, indeed, gave Jesus, son of Mary the
> exposition (al-bayan) and aided him with a Spirit from Our Dhikr (b/-reh min
> dhikrina). We, indeed, sent down a Book (k/tab an) upon the prophets (al-
> nab/jinn) consisting of concealed tablets (al-alwah al-mastrir an) (QA 55:217;
> cf. Q. 2:87).

Probably addressing Sufis and speaking with the voice of God in the Surat al-kitab
(Sura of the Book = QA 41) the pre-existent Bab affirms the revealed status of Abrahamic
scripture. He associates his pre-existent Logos-Self with the quasi-messianic Dhikr
(Remembrance) and the divine being who conversed with Moses on Sinai. He revealed the Injil
to Jesus who was subsequently taken up to the heaven of baqa' (permanent abiding in God).
This until the hujjat-Allah (Messianic Qa'im) appears at the time of second advent of Jesus and
discloses the sealed mystery of the identity and purpose of the messianic Dhikr(= Bab):
0 People of effacement (mahw)! Hearken unto my call, from the Point of

Brightness (nuqtat al-sahw), from this Arabian Youth who, with the permission
> of God, cried out unto Moses on Mount Sinai (al-M. al-sina). The Torah, in very
> truth, was assuredly sent down unto him on the part of God... With our hands
> did We beckon unto Jesus. The Mill was indeed sent down from heaven unto
> his person in his allotted time. Then God lifted him [Jesus] up to heaven for
> eternal abiding [with Him] (li'l-baqa), until, that is, the promised Day when the
> mystery will be disclosed from the sealed scroll (al-sahrfa al-makhtama) in the
> platform of the courtyard (dakkat al-qasa2 of the great Mosque of Mecca (al-
> masfid al-haram), by the tongue of the 171 ujjat-Allah (Proof of God, the Qa'im),
> the truth that is, regarding the mystery of the Dhikr who represents
> Muhammad, the Arabian Prophet (QA 41:153).

In the SOrat al-ghulam (Surah of the Youth, QA 54) the Bab refers to himself as the al-
bab al-akbar (Greatest Gate) and al-ghulam al-'arabi the Arabian Youth to whom reference
is made in the Tawrat, the Injil, the Zabor and the Q. as well as in the umm al-kitab, the
Archetypal Book (QA 54:214). This is in line with the Shr s T notion that pre-Islamic prophets
(anb)'a) predicted the identity of the future advent of Muhammad before his being born in this
world. The same is said of the Bab as the eschatological Joseph-like "youth". Both the Bab and
BA* believed their advent was specifically predicted in all past sacred books (lbn BabOya,
Risala trl-ghayba, IV [CD]).
There are several passages in the QA and other writings in which the Bab refers to pre-

Islamic scripture as alluding to himself or to the awaited messiah. In the highly esoteric Sarat
al-tarbT' (Sara of the Quadratic Talisman) of the QA, the Bab, most likely referring to himself
states

> You on the Mount (al-tar) are in the Point of the Gate (nuqtat al-bab) in the
> vicinity of the [Sinaitic] Fire planted by the hand of God, the pre-existent in the
> earth of the divine Cloud (arc/ al-ama). You are the shape of the talismans
> (shakl al-talismiyytin) in the Sinaitic Mount above the Light (al-tar 'ala al-nar).
> You are as the Jesus-like Word (al-kallmat al-7-sa'wiyyün)in the InjTI (Gospel)
> and the Zabar(Psalter), most assuredly inscribed in the form of the tasbrh (=
> subhan Allah= 'Praised be God!'). Say: I, verily, am the triangular [talismanic]
> Form (shakl al-thulth = 'Ali?) written quadratic [fourfold = Muhammad?] (marbr
> s") in the sanctum of the divine Cloud (al-quds al-ama)(QA 91:364).

In this passage the Bab probably indicates his parentally bestowed name 'AR Muhammad (3
letters+4 letters). This was mystically registered in talismanic forms in Sinaitic pre-eternity. He
was the locus of a Name (ism) written afore time by the hands of the eschatological Dhikr in
the Tawrat (Torah), the InjTI (Gospel) and the Q. (QA 50:195).1
X Pre-Islamic scripture in some later writings of the Bab.

Commenting on the letter "k" (kaf) of li-rabbika (Q. 108:2) in his T.Kawthar the Bab
relates kalam Allah (the Word of God) to various past sacred books including the tawrat and
injIl;

> Now concerning the letter "k" (al-kaf ). It signifies the kalam Allah (Word of
> God) in the Q. ... it signifies the Word of God (kalam Allah) in the InjT1 (Gospel)
which God sent down through a letter of the exteriority of the Q. (b/-bar! min

'alaniyyat al-qur ian) unto whomsoever desired that he might believe in the All-
> Merciful in the realm of existence (ard al-imkan). It [ the letter "k"] also signifies
> the Word of God (kalam Allah) in the tawrat (Torah) as accords with what God
> sent down unto Moses, son of 'Imran, from every direction... (T.Kawthar :f. 21a-
> b.)

This passage makes it clear that the "Word of God" in the MAI is subordinated to the
Q. originating from a mere bar! ("letter") of the Islamic sacred book as is later echoed several
times in the P.Bayan. (-->). The Bab may here presuppose the INV being relayed to post-
Jesus' disciples and others (?). This subordinate position of the 471 (Gospel[s]) was dbubtless

'These statements may assume the pre-existent presence of letters of the ism Allah al- agam
(the "Mightiest Name of God") in pre-Islamic scripture (cf. T.LaylatQ. 69:18—> 8).

a factor in the Bab's non-citation of 19th century canonical Gospel texts. He never refers to the
anajTI (four Gospels) but, like the Q., invariably uses the singular WI which does not appear
to have plural implications or be indicative of the NT Gospels. Among other things this tends
to put the Bab outside of the category of those Shi sT 'ulama' who debated with Christian
missionaries (<--4.3).

None of the later writings of the Bab,' including the P. Bayan contain NT or biblical
quotations. There are though, several interesting references to the Injil in its ideal, pristine
essence. In this condition the Infil is identical with the Q. and the Bayan (P.Bay. 2:15). It
revolved around the word of Muhammad for whose sake it was written (P.Bay. 2:19; 3:3).
Muhammad fulfilled and perfected the 101 (P.Bay. 4:13). The Infil was superceded or
abrogated by the Q. and the Bayan which are more excellent and complete divine revelations
(P.Bay. 3:4). This makes the copying and study of the InjTI of no avail after the messianic
advent of Muhammad (P.Bay. 7:1). It is no wonder that the Bab chose not to cite the NT.

Despite this subordinate position the 411 is quite definitely assumed to be the "Book
of God" (kitab-I khfidavand) and the kalam Allah (Word of God <--). The Bab, however,
reckoned that the spiritual essence of the pristine Infil mystically coalesced with the Q. (when
it was revealed to Muhammad) and became something "mundane". The true spirit and sanctity
of the Gospel became dependent on the more elevated Q.;

> There is no doubt that the InjTI was the kitab-i khudavand (Book of God). But
> after the descent of the Furqan [Criterion = the Q.] its real spirits (arvah-i
> huqqih-yi an) were elevated through the instrumentality of the Qur'an. What
> remained was other than the aliyyrn, the sublimely elevated spirits [of the
> divinely revealed verses of the Q.] (P.Bay. 7:7, 289).

None of the passages cited above should be taken to be indicative of the Bob's direct
knowledge of Abrahamic sacred writ or biblical texts. Rather, they point to his being the
mouthpiece of God in receipt of divine revelation, inspired with the knowledge of all past sacred

Such scattered references to the Tawrat, , inill and ZabOr as exist in the Bab's Da/a7/-I sab'a
(Per. & Ar.) K PanjS, K Asm,g ' and other late writings are largely of passing or minor interest.

books. As the spiritual "return" of all past messengers of God, the Bab explicitly claimed to
be the author of all past religions and the revealer of al-Kitab, the archetypal repository of all
sacred scripture (A.Bay. 1:82, 2:15, etc).

The Bib's view of pre-quranic sacred scripture is very much in line with that of 'Abd al-
Rah man Jami (d.898/1492) and other Sufis of the school of Ibn 'Arabi including 'Abd al-Karim
al-Jill (d. c. 832/1428; al-Insan,1:111-4). The 28th section of al-Jarni's composite Arabic-
Persian Naqd al-nusas (The Deliverance of the Texts), which comments upon aspects of Ibn
al-sArabT's Naqsh al-fusa,s (The Imprint of the Bezels) focuses upon the mysteries of the bezel
relative to "the peerless wisdom in the Muhammadan word". Here the Q. is equated with the
Logos-like nafs ("Self") and paqi-qa (Reality) of Muhammad. It is seen as "a singular expression
(atiadlyya) of the combination of the entirety of the divine books 'jam al-jami al-kutub al-
ilahlyya)." The Q. Jami continues,

This conflation of the substance of the revealed books into the first sora of the Q. is
probably inspired by the tradition that the whole of the Q. is in the point (•) of the letter "b" (,..!)

of the basmala of the first surah, al-Fatil)a (Q.1), a tradition well-known to the Bab. Jami's
mystical conflation of all previous revealed books into the first surah of the Q. reflects exactly
the way that the Bab viewed pre-Islamic revelations. The reality of the Bible as the Tawrat,
Zabel-   and Infil were spiritually subsumed within the essence of the Q. Its mysteries were
implicit within the Islamic sacred book, more or less rendering the citation, direct knowledge (of
translations) of the HB ( Psalms) and Gospel/NT unnecessary. It has likewise been noted how

Sayyid Kazim Rashti expressed a similar opinion in his Shari al-agsida al-Lamiyya (<-4.3f).
II The Bab on tahr1f ("falsification") and tabd11 ("scriptural alternation").

At several points in his writings including the Per. and Ar. Seven Proofs, the Bab
presupposes that Jews possess the tawrat (Torah) and Christians the Inji/ and the followers
of David the Zabar ("Psalter"). He had an accepting, positive view of these past sacred
scriptures although their importance is abrogated, virtually negated relative to the subsequent
divine revelations of the Q. and the Bayan (= the Bab's own revelations). The Bab does not
appear to directly refer to the (canonical) Tawrat and Injil as having been subject to tahrif in
the usual Islamic (post-quranic) sense, though he does indicate their loss of "elevated spirits"
(<--in P.Bay 7:7). In the Sarat a/-If/tab (Sarah of the Book, QA 41) he warns readers not to
subject the QA to tabdfl (alternation) or tahrff ("corruption") even though revelation is
essentially something beyond the letter:

> 0 servants of the All-Merciful! Fear God regarding the tahrif (textual
> corruption) of the Book even to the extent of a single letter (half an) of what God
> has, in truth, sent down therein which goes beyond the [concrete] letter (
> ghayr al-had). (QA 41:151; cf. QA 53:209).

This passage may imply that the Bab considered divine revelation more than
something written in concrete letters which can be easily corrupted. Divine revelation for him
appears something more elevated than what might be subject to concrete tahrif (corruption).
This viewpoint also seems to be reflected in P.Bayan 7:7 (<--). For the Bab neither the Tawrat
or 101 have been subject to tahrTf ("corruption") in the standard Islamic sense. It is the loss
of their "spirit" and "life" relative to their power to inspire religious truth that fades away before
later expressions of divine revelation. The attempt to divine theological truth after another
divine revelation is assumed to be futile. When a new maghar-i ilahr (divine manifestation)
appears with a new book which encapsulates the allyyrn ("elevated spirits") which impart
haqTqa, hermeneutical reality to the pure in heart. For the Bab sacred books have a spiritual
dimension which derives from the latest maghar-i IIN7T and promotes insight and spirituality.
The InjT1 referred to in most if not all of the writings of the Bab cannot be straight-

forwardly equated with existing Christian Gospels, with the canonical Christian NT. Infil
primarily indicates the revelation of God to Jesus. It seems to be presupposed that this
revelation is extant though its usefulness is eclipsed and superseded by subsequent
revelations in the form of the Q. and the Bayan of the Bab. These latter revealed texts
encapsulate the new spiritual intention of the /n/71.

The Bab's position relating to the Tawrat and inji/ is sufficiently open or ambiguous
to suggest and prepare the way for Birs rejection of any thoroughgoing Islamic expression the
doctrine of biblical tatirTf. It was only a decade or so after the Bb's execution in 1850 that
BA* (then a leading Babi) began ( from the early 1860s) to make frequent citations of biblical
scripture in attempting to prove the truth of Islam from the NT as well as the veracity of the
religion of the Bab (-->7.1).
17\. 2 The Delphic maxim and an Islamicate citation from the Injil

In several of his major and certain of his minor works, including his T Baqara (52a-b),
T.LaylatQ. (69:17), T. Man. (14:472), T. 171aqTqa(14:465), R.NubuwwaK (4:385) and P.Dala'il
(P.Da1:39) the Bab quotes and sometimes comments on a maxim which he often identifies as
a saying from the Inj11 -- though it only vaguely reflects (?) Matt.10:28 (= Luke 12:4-5?):1

• 1:1 I &IL       j   G   Lill   0.1.)   ..ALI1 a,   _, ,..1_,..:, awi:, ,..i, ,..1 •

> Know thyself and thou shalt know thy Lord;
> Thine outer self (gahir) is for [mystical] annihilation (fana)
> while thine inner self (batin) is I myself (ana).

The first hem istich of this saying is rooted in the Delphic maxim, "Know thyself!" which
was known from antiquity, prior to the time of Philo of Alexandria (d.c. 50 CE?) who
commented upon it in a manner reminiscent of later Muslim philosophers and gnostics (Philo,
Spec. Leg. 1.43ff; Mut. 7.10; Westra, 1992:89-102). In his T Baqara the Bab understands the
nafs ("Logos-Self") to be the "Reality" which provides a sure Path unto God: "Whoso hath

Matt. 10:28 seems to be the only NT saying that reflects a few Islamicate versions of the Delphic
maxim: "And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy
both souls and body in hell".

known God through the Path of this Logos-Self (nafs)which is in him hath assuredly known
God. There is no Path for the servants other than this" (T. Baqara 52a). Like BA*, Philo held
that the Delphic maxim implied the unknowability of God (Louth, 1981:20f; BA* Lawb-i 171ajji
MuIla Han- QazvinT, MAM:346-62). Just as one cannot know the depths of one's own "self'
so is it reckoned impossible to know the reality of God.

Variously expanded Islamicate versions of the Delphic maxim are attributed in Islamic
literatures to a variety of philosophers and sages as well as to Imam 'All and Muhammad:

> man 'arafa nafsahu faqad arafa rabbahu,
> Whoso knoweth himself knoweth his Lord.'

Apparently first introduced as a hadIth by Yabya b. Mu s adh (d. 871), it was quoted and
commented upon by many medieval and later Muslim writers some of whom were aware of its
Greek origin (Altmann, 1963[9]). In the Rasa71 ikhwan al-safa' ( <--4.2) versions of the Delphic
maxim are attributed to both Muhammad and 'All as they are in the writings of the Bab (Rasail
1:76;111:351; Altmann 1963[9]:1). At one point in these encyclopaedic Rasail it is said to be
incumbent upon every intellectual pen ) to seek "the knowledge of the self ("soul") as well
as the gnosis of its essence and its refinement" (7Im al-nafs wa marifatihi jawhariha wa
tadhIbiha , R1:76). Ibn STna reckoned that the version "Whoso knoweth himself knoweth his
Lord" as a kalima (statement, saying) about which the hukama' (philosophers) and awliya'
('saintly ones') are in agreement (ibid 1969:1). In his opinion it calls for a "profound self-
scrutiny" (Goodman, 1992:164).

Rewritten or expanded forms of the Delphic maxim were highly regarded by Sufi writers
and mystics. Ibn al-'ArabT frequently commented upon it as is evident in his weighty Futahat
(11:308, 500; I11:101; 314, 404, 552 etc. [ed Yahya] 14:480, etc.; Houedard, 1992:1-10) and in
his influential Fusas (Fusas 69; tr.74). His Risala al-wujadiyya (Treatise on Existence) is
largely devoted to the mysteries of the Islamicate Delphic maxim cited as a prophetip hadith.

Variant forms include, a'rafukum b/-nafsihi arafukum b/-rabbihi (He among you who knows himself
best knows his Lord best"). Both, for example, are found in R. Ikhwàn al-Safa'(R.1:76).

It has, furthermore, been observed that the al-Hikma al-'arshiyya (Wisdom of the Throne) of
Mulla Sadra (<-2.1;4.1) is essentially an "extended commentary on the famous saying of Imam
'Ali: 'He who truly knows ('arafa) his soul/Self (nafsahu), knows his Lord" (Morris,1981:62
fn.69; 78 fn. 88). BursT also cited and commented upon versions of the Delphic maxim in his
Mashariq (Lawson, 1992: 271). Like numerous other ShT'T writers both Shaykh Ahmad 1 and
Sayyid Kazim as well as the Bab and BA* commented upon versions of this tradition (B*
T.Man.14:468f). BA* commented upon an Islamicate Delphic maxim (man 'arafa nafsahu
faqad 'arafa rabbahu ) in his L. H-Qazvini (MAM:346-62) and his K Tqan (BA* KI:76166) and
other writings.

The first clause of the Bab's above cited quotation from the Injil corresponds with one
of the Arabic forms of the Delphic maxim. Its second hemistitch is perhaps best regarded as
a Sufi gloss indicative of its meaning. It may indicate that human beings by interior realization
of their divine nature and the transitoriness of their zahir,, (outer physical form) come to a
knowledge of God. Though not contained in the canonical NT the Bab sometimes introduces
this expanded version of the Delphic maxim as that which God said in the ITV (qala Allah frl-
injil ). Elsewhere in his writings he follows Islamic sources in attributing it to Muhammad or
Imam 'All.

The presence of this pseudo-Gospel divine utterance in the Bb's writings is obviously
not indicative of his direct knowledge of the NT. 2 Its source in his writings is most probably the
writings of the first two Shaykhi leaders who also occasionally quote forms of it as deriving

/ See IbrahTmT, Fihrist.. 225 [item 13 = Shaykh Akimad's commentary on the aforementioned hadfth
in reply to a question of Shaykh Muhammad MandT AstarabadT]; Risala in reply to Sayyid Ab0 al-Hasan
al-JTIAnT in MajR. 30: 90-101,esp 94f.

The Bab distinguishes this alleged quotation from the injil from the two expanded Islamic forms of
the Delhpic maxim found in the lyadfth literatures. He usually attributes the words man 'arbfa nafsahu
faqad 'arafa rabbahu to Imam 'Air and a'rafukum b/-nafsihi a'rafukum bi- rabbihi to Muhammad.
Commenting on these traditions and the alleged quotation from the 101 he affirms that the world of
creation or the human nafs (cf. Qur'an 41:53 ) may be the locus of the theophany of the names and
attributes of God but underlines the impossibility of any relationship between the human nafs and the
unknowable Godhead (cf. BA's similar comments on man 'arafa nafsahu faqad 'arafa rabbahu in his
L. H-QazyTnT,.35f).

from the Injg The first two Shaykhs most probably quote it it from the Mashariq al-anwar of
al-Bursi (<--2. 2). There, in a slightly longer version, it is reckoned to be that which the
"Glorious Lord" (al-rabb al-jaITI) uttered in the Injil. The text, as cited by al-Bursi along with
another two versions ascribed to Muhammad, the "Master of the [Islamic] Law" (sahib al-
sharT'a), and the rightly guided Imam reads;

1,1 LL J .,t1 j411
LA                                                             ti    ,L40
Jui 4 *-41.

,    Li lt.   al   Li;   ‘.1        :1?,1441

> The Glorious Lord says in the Injil:
> Know thyself, 0 thou humankind (al-insan)! then thou shalt know thy Lord.
> Thine outer being (zahir) is for mystical annihilation (11-1-fana)while your interior
> reality (bat/n,) is I Myself (ana)
> The master of the Law [= Muhammad] said: 'Know thyself through thy Lord and
> thou shalt know thine own self.'
> And the rightly guided Imam ['AIT] said:' Whoso knoweth himself assuredly
> knoweth his Lord' (Bursi, Mashariq, 188).
As noted, Ibn al-'Arabi is another important source for Islamicate Bible citations. In his
K. al-jalal waY-jamal (Book of the Divine Majesty and Beauty) he quotes the following
Islamicate version of what God allegedly revealed (w-b-y) in His tawrat (Torah, Hebrew Bible):

> 0 son of Adam! I created all things for thy sake and created thee for My sake.
> Then do not disgrace what I created for Myself through what I created for thy
> sake (Ar. text Rasa71 ibn ArabT, 1:15).

In similar fashion al-Absal in his Sharh al-ziyara cites the following hacilth qudsr
said to be contained in the InjTI but which is again related to the Islamicate 'biblical' citations
already given:

> I [God] created existing things (al-ashya) for thy sake and I created thee for My
> sake for while thine inner reality (batinuka) is I Myself (ana), thine outer self
> (zahlruka) is for annihilation (117-fana2(Sh-Ziyara 3:352-3; cf. 'bid 4:26).

This line is immediately followed by a similar saying of the "bearer of the law (sahib al-shan"a=
Muhammad), "Whoso cometh to know his Lord best cometh to know his own self best" (BursT,
Mashariq,188). On BursT and his concept of self-knowledge see Lawson, 1992:270f.

After this quotation the Shaykh goes immediately on to quote al-Infil (The Gospel)
exactly as in Bursi's Mashariq (Sh- Ziyara, 3:363). Finally, it should also be noted that in the
course of commenting on the words "I saw God and Paradise" in his Sh.TutunAyya, Sayyid
Kazim also quotes the saying of the MITI exactly as registered in Bursi's Mashariq but with the
following addition, "I am the theophany of the divine Essence (zuhar al-dhat) through the
unique Word (bi'l-kalain al-mutafarrid)" (Rashtr, Sh-Tutunjiyya, 299 cf.185).

In the light of the above, it is evident that the Bb's quotation of the typically Sufi,
Islamicate "Gospel" citation, is his registering something derived from his Shaykhi teachers
who were dependent upon al-Bursi or other mystically inclined philosopher-theologians. None
of this has anything to do with the Bb's knowledge of the NT.
II 7. 3 The Bab and alleged biblical citations in primary and secondary sources.

Gobineau (<--) in Religiones et Philosophies.. (Paris, 1865), the Italian physician
Lessona in his I-Babi (Turin, 1881), several Christian missionary writers (Miller, Shedd,
St.Clair-Tisdall) and a number of western academics (Browne, Amanat) have, to a greater or
lesser extent, accepted the largely unfounded tradition that the Bab had been influenced by
Christianity through reading Bible translation(s). From 1910 this position was championed by
E. G. Browne as allegedly backed up by somewhat dubious external evidence in support of
the Bab's   biblical awareness in the form of a notice based upon a memorandum found among
the   papers of the (ABCFM) Presbyterian missionary John Haskell Shedd (d.1895) of the
"Nestorian Mission" at Urumiyya (from 1870-->).

Shedd reported an account of an alleged interview between the Bab and the British
physician resident at Tabriz, William Cormick (d.129411877). 1 Cormick allegedly told John
Shedd that the Bab "was seen by some Armenian Carpenters, who were sent to make some

See 'An Interesting Document on the 13613 [A letter of W.A. Shedd to the Editor of the Muslim World,
dated Urumia, Persia, August 28th, 1914]' in The Moslem World, Vol.5. (1915), pp.111-12 also cited in
Browne, Materials.. 260-2. William Cormick and two other Persian physicians had been sent to ascertain,
apparently on behalf of the Shah and the Muslim divines of Tabriz ( before July 9th 1850), whether or not
the Bab was of sound mind and thus fit for execution. Cormick must have communicated his favourable
impression of the Bab to John Shedd between 1870 and 1877 (on Cormick see Momen Elr. IV:275-6).

repairs in his prison [presumably at Chihrid reading the Bible". The Bab, it was apparently
said, "took no pains" to conceal his reading the Bible but allegedly informed the Armenian
carpenters accordingly (Shedd, 'Memorandum`,12).

Though it is not impossible that the Bab had read the Bible during his imprisonment in
Adhirbayjan (or indeed prior to this time) there is nothing in his writings that supports the theory
that he had studied and based his religious ideas upon a biblical / NT precedent. There is really
no internal evidence supportive of the theory that the Bab had read the NT in either the Persian
translation of Martyn or any other Persian or Arabic NT version. As will be argued here, the
Bab never cited any of the books or testaments of the canonical Bible. Browne was too ready
to accept the aforementioned missionary ascribed to Shedd which may have been motivated
by a desire to account for the Bb's "enlightened" teachings by way of Christian influence. The
passages from the WI, which the Bab does several times explicitly cite, are non-canonical,
entirely Islamicate or Islamo-biblical sayings deriving from earlier Muslim sources (<--). If
Armenian carpenters saw the Bab reading or chanting sacred verses they might simply, in view
of his widely recognised piety, have assumed that he was reading the NT. Even if he was doing
so there is no clear internal evidence of this reading in any of the Bb's writings I have seen.
Having thus argued it is necessary to examine other supposed indications of the Bb's
knowledge of the Bible / NT. It can be assumed that the above missionary evidence is at best
uncertain and very probably unreliable.
I E.G. Browne and Gospel influence within the Persian Bayan.

While no convincing traces of the Bab's direct knowledge of the Hebrew Bible have been
found (<--4.1f) certain alleged signs of his knowledge of the NT have been set down by the
aforementioned Cambridge orientalist Edward. G. Browne. This in his 'Index of Chief Contents
of the Persian Bayan', contained in his English introduction to his 1910 edition of the K Nuqatat

al-kg,   Here Browne listed seven alleged 'signs of the influence of the Gospel on the Persian
Sayan.' As Browne succinctly registered them they are;

> (1) "The first shall be last and the last first" (11.16,17; V111.4.);
> (2) The Hour shall come suddenly ("like a thief in the night") (11.18);
> (3) A cup of water given by a believer (IV.8.);
> (4) Believers are to love one another (V.16);
> (5) Believers are to do as they would be done by (VI.15);
> (6) Selling in the Temple (IV.17);
> (7) Dying to God (11.8; 111.13; V.3 )." (Refer Browne (ed.) K.N.Kaf : lxviii).

At first sight this list appears to be a fairly impressive indication of Gospel influence upon
the Bab / P.Bayan by a very highly respected Cambridge academic. Most, however, if not all
of the alleged influences listed by Browne find clear parallels in Islamic literatures. None of
these seven are direct or indirect signs of NT influence upon the Bab. Browne's seven
examples to some degree actually serve to illustrate the pre-19th century Judaeo-Christian/
biblical influence upon Islam. Exact Islamic sources for most of these alleged signs of Gospel
influence, can be found in either the Q., the Islamic tradition literatures, in Sufi texts or other
miscellaneous Islamic literatures. It will be argued here that such parallels make it very unlikely
that Browne's 'Signs of Gospel Influence' are proofs of the Bab's familiarity with the NT. Each
of these seven alleged signs of Gospel influence will now be briefly examined in the order given
by Browne. Possible textual parallels in the Henry Martyn Persian NT will be borne in mind as
will the Bb's doctrines set out in the Persian and Arabic Bayans and other writings.
I (1) Eschatological reversal: 'The first shall be last and the last shall be first'.

P.Bayan (= P.Bay.) 8:4 has to do with the hierarchical appropriation of all existence,
"things", kullu shay' ("everything"). The Bab opens P.Bay. 8:4 by stating that the most
elevated portion of "everything" belongs to himself as the "Point" (kul/u shay' a/oho 11-1-nuqja).
Its intermediate component exists for the 1,7urCif al-hayy, ("Letters of the Living"<--) while its
most lowly (and) aspect is assigned to humankind (al-khalq). Having used two Arabic
superlatives expressive of the most elevated ('ala) and the most lowly (anda) the Bab is
inspired to incorporate the religious principle of bi-polar reversal, even combining Arabic and
Persian superlative forms:

> .. In each religious theophany (har zuharT) it is evident that the most elevated
of creatures (aTa-yi khalq) become the most abased [of creatures] (anda). And

> [furthermore that] the most lowly of creatures (anda-y/ khalq) become [espe-
> cially] elevated (a'/a,). Additionally, the most elevated (a7ã-tar) become yet
> more elevated (a /a) [through faith] while the most lowly (anda) become even
> lowlier (anda-tar) [through denial]... ( P.Bay. 8:4, 283, cf. 2:16,17).

That there will be a (bi-polar) eschatological reversal of (faith) status (First/Last:
Last/First or Exalted/Humbled: Humbled/Exalted) is certainly indicated in Judaeo-Christian
biblical and extra-biblical tradition (Ezek.2:31 (LXX); Ps. 74:8 (L)(X) Ep. Arist. 363; Erub 13b,
etc). NT evidence indicates that this was central to the parables and teachings of Jesus
(Mk.10:31; Matt. 19:30; 20:16; Lk. 13:30; 14:11; 18:14, Barnabas 6:13 etc). 1 The coming of the
Kingdom of God involved a (pre-) eschatological reversal demanding judgement in the present
(Perrin,1974:52; O'York,1991:9ff).

In various forms this teaching is reflected in the Q. and in Islamic tradition. In the
P.Bayan and other writings, the Bab concretizes this perspective by teaching that with the
advent of each religious theophany or dispensation elevated souls become abased and
abased souls are elevated. This by virtue of their acceptance or rejection of expected maghar-i
Ohl (Divine Manifestations). Lofty inmates of the garden (jannat, of true faith), if they fail to
accept the claims of subsequent Divine Manifestations, become abased inhabitants of the Fire
(tor, of unbelief ). During his own era lofty souls (learned Muslims) became abased through
rejecting him while humble souls were elevated by a positive response to his call (P.Bay. 8:4).
Warning his followers the Bab predicts that the same may happen at the future Day of
Resurrection when man yughiru-hu Allah appears (P.Bay. 7:9).

Though ultimately rooted in NT texts it is upon Islamic sources that the Bab draws in
order to indicate an eschatological reversal of faith status. Passages in both Bayans (Per. 4-
Ar.) and related writings expressive of a bi-polar faith reversal do not reflect the terminology of
the Persian NT translation of Henry Martyn or any other Persian or Arabic NT versions known
to the present writer. In P.Bayan 8:4 the Bab refers to the fact that learned scholars ih the "land

1 The NT references are-: Mk 10:31; Matt 19:30, 20:16; Lk 13:30; Matt 23;11-12; Luke 14:11;
18:14; cf.Mk 9:35,10:43-4;Lk 9:48, 22:26.

of Sad" (= Isfahan) failed to recognise him while a humble wheat-sifter named (Mull) Ja'far
Gandum PakkOn was invested with the qam49-1 niqabat (the garb of primacy): This, the Bab
then notes, is the "mystery of the utterance (sirr-i kalam) of the ShrT holy family, the ahl-1 bayt
(people of the House)". In saying this it is obvious that the Bab himself regards the tradition of
the bi-polar reversal of faith status as a Shi s T tradition and not anything NT based. During the
Bab's own theophany the following Islamic tradition found fulfilment as is clearly stated in
P.Bayan 8:14, a passage which Browne appears to have overlooked;

> The lowest of the creatures (asfal -I khalq)[shall become] the most exalted of
> the creatures (a/a-yi khalq) and the most exalted of the creatures (a/a-yi
> khalq) [shall become] the lowest of the creatures (asfal-I khalq)" (cited P.Bay.
> 8:14, 296-7).

The Bab also quotes a similar version of an Islamic (not NT!) tradition indicative of a
reversal of faith status in his late Sha runat al-farsT (Persian Grades).

> It will come to pass that your lowly ones [shall become] your most exalted ones
> and your most exalted ones [shall become] your lowly ones" (Shu'anK. 82:94).

In his K. Tqan and other writings BA* also cites Arabic, Islamic and other versions of this
tradition (KI:1131 94). In the course of citing the Bab in his Edirne dated Lawn-i Sarraj (c.
1867) another version expressive of bi-polar reversal is given (Ma'idih 7:34). This tradition is
also commented upon in other alwal.7 of BA*; in connection, for example, with the exegesis of
the phrase of Shaykh Ah mad, sirr al-tankTs li-ramz al-ra'is ("The mystery of inversion through
the symbol of the Ruler") (K.Aqdas1   7 157/tr. 75-6; cf. L. HirtTk, LH 3:218) which is understood
to allude to an eschatological, bi-polar reversal of faith status graphically indicated by an
upturned inverted Arabic letter waw (= 3 <-6.2) in ShT'T representations of the ism Allah al-
a'gam (Mightiest Name of God) as well as in the NT and Islamic traditions (MazandaranT, AA
5:237-245; Ma'idih1:12f). AB* likewise quoted, cited and commented on the biblical as well as
the Islamic tradition relating to the eschatological reversal of faith status (Ishraq Khavari, Ratilq

#

1:685ff; Maidih 2:19,34).

Muila Ja'far Gandum PakkOn was converted to Babism by Mulla 17Iusayn during the early years of
the Baia movement and died during the Tabarsi upheaval.

Browne's reckoning the reversal of faith status in P.Bayan 8:4 a sign of Gospel
influence is wholly unconvincing in the light of the Bab's own drawing on Islamic traditions to
this effect as well as the numerous Islamic predictions of an eschatological reversal of faith
status.
• (2) The suddenness of the eschatological "hour", "like a thief in the night".

The fairly brief and succinct Persian Bayan 2:18 is in "exposition of the fact that there
is absolutely no doubt about the advent of the [eschatological] Hour (al-sa'ah)." The note of
suddenness occurs towards the very end of this section of the P.Bay. and reads,

> Anticipate then the theophany of God (zuharAllah) for undoubtedly the "Hour"

(al-saa) shall come upon you suddenly (baghtat"). (P. Bay. 2:18, 72).

Browne focuses upon the fact that the Bab states that 'The Hour shall assuredly come

an
upon you baghtat          ("suddenly")'. In the Arabic verse cited above which concludes P.Bay. 2:18
the Bab does not, however, state that the eschatological "hour" will come "like a thief in the
night" or repeat NT expressions of eschatological immanence.' In the complex partly realized,
partly futurist eschatology of the Bab, there are quite a number of varied and diverse
expressions of the imminence of the eschatological "Hour". None of them seem to have any
connection with NT verses expressive of the last "Hour" or the parousia coming like a "thief in
the night".

In the eschatologically charged first Sarat al-mulk of the QA the Bab exhorts the kings
of the world to purify the earth of such as refute the Book on the "Day" when the Dhikr,
(messianic Remembrance) will come baghtat an ( "suddenly", QA1:3). Such references are

an
not inspired by NT texts but by the Q. where the adverbial use of baghtat    occurs thirteen
times and mostly of the "suddenness" of the eschatological "Hour" (Kassis, 313). Notes of
eschatological suddenness in the Bab's writings are fully in line with Islamic eschatological
expectations themselves rooted in NT eschatology. Note, for example, the following texts:

I See Mk 13:33f; Matt 24:42f; Lk 21:36; Matt 25:13; I Thess. 5:2f; 2 Peter 3:10 cf. 1 Peter 4:1; Lk
12:39; Matt 24:431; Rev 3:3.

> Lost indeed are those who regard the meeting with God as falsehood -- until
> such time as the Hour (al-sa'a) is suddenly (baghtat an) upon them.. .(Q. 6:31).
> It [the "Hour"] shall not come upon you except suddenly (baghtat an)." (Q.7:187)
> ...Or the sudden (baghtat an) coming of the Hour (al-sa 'a) while they perceive
> not." (Q.12:107)
> ...Until the Hour (al-sa'a) come suddenly (baghtat an ) upon them.." (Q.22:55).1

It is not necessary to invoke direct NT influence in accounting for the Bb's own note
of the suddenness of the last "Hour". The Bob's use of the motif of eschatological "suddenness"
and unexpectedness clearly echos quranic verses and related Shri traditions. Islamic sources

an,
themselves quote Jesus using baghtat                  the note of suddenness in an Islamicate NT
expression of the suddenness of the advent of the "Hour". In the Shi s i Qi.SRIS al-anbiya' of Ibn
al-RawandT (<--3.2), for example, Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq clearly echoes Mk. 13:32 (+ parallels)
in reporting that,

> .. Jesus son of Mary asked Gabriel, 'When shall be the emergence of the
> (eschatological) Hour (al-sa'at)?' At this Gabriel trembled and shuddered all
> but losing consciousness. When he composed himself he replied, '0 Spirit of
> God! Over this most perplexing issue the one questioned (= Gabriel) is no
> more knowledgeable (a 'lam) than the questioner (= Jesus) or anyone else be
> they in the heavens or upon the earth. It [the "Hour] will not come upon you but
> baghtat an (suddenly)' (Rawancli, Qisas, 271-2; cf. BA* ESW:143) .

• [3] A cup of water given by a believer (P. Bay. IV:8).

> And whoever shall give one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink
> in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you that he shall in no wise have lost his
> reward (Matt. 10:47)

> The Bab sums up P.Bayan 4:8 in the following way;
> The essence of this gate is this, that through his verses he [God] creates the
> essential reality of all things (kaynoniyyat-i kull shay) and thereby gives
> sustenance, causes to die, and makes to come alive (P.Bay. 4:8,127).
Later in the same section of the P.Bayan the Bab states:

See also Q. 43:66; 21:41; 26:202; 29:43; 39:56. Various Islamic traditions, it should also be noted,
express the belief that the Mandr or Qa'im will come suddenly or unexpectedly. cf . Persian Bayan VII 9.
where, alluding to the coming of God or man ywhiru-hu Allah on the Day of Resurrection, the Bab states
that "He will suddenly shine forth" ( va tall mTshavad baghtat ").

> Thus, if today but one cup of water (finjan—i ab) be given by a believer in the
> Bayan it would seem sweeter (ahla) to the mystic knower rant) than all the
> benefits of this world (kull-i ala' al erg') proffered by one not believing in the
> Bayan (ibid 128).

This section of the Bayan basically revolves around the belief that a pure action such
as the giving of a rose-leaf (waraq-i gut) by a believer to another of the ahl-1 bayan (Babis),
is fundamentally a divine action. It is tantamount to being a divine action as the action of the
"Letters of the One" (wahid): the nineteen strong Bator pleroma of first disciples (P.Bay.
4:8,127).

In P.Bayan 4:8 Browne found a sign of Gospel influence in that the Bab refers to "a
cup given by a believer" (Matt 10:42; Mk 9:41; cf. Matt 25:35ff). The alleged parallel is not, for
a number of reasons, an exact parallel. In P.Bayan 4:8 it is simply a "cup of water" that is given
to another not a "cup of cold water" (Martyn = ka's-/ ab-I sard1)(Matt 20:42b). Quite different
is the P.Bay. where it is a mature or learned Babi, an arif (one of mystical perception) who
receives the cup of water not, as in Matt. 10:42b yek az atfal (so H. Martyn), "one of these
children" or "one of these little ones".

As translated above, the Bab in P.Bayan 4:8 writes that if in his day a believer in the
Bayan should give but a cup of water (finjan—i ab) to another it would prove sweeter than all
the benefits of the earth given by a non-Babi. Though there is something of a parallel with Matt
10:24 (= Mk 9:41) it is not explicit enough to indicate the Bib's direct knowledge of the NT. The
reference summed up above to the efficacy of a rose-leaf given by one of the people of the
Bayan (Batis) likewise has no explicit NT parallel. The "cup of water" (finjan-i ab)motif of itself
is not a strong enough parallel to categorically uphold Gospel influence upon the Bob.
II [4] The love ethic, that "believers should love one another" (V:16).
In his summary of P. Bayan 5:16 Browne expresses his aforementioned sign of Gospel

influence as follows ( I have added some points of Persian transliteration):

> What God loves most in the people of the Bayan ( ahl al-bayan) is their love
> one for another [hubb-i 'Shan ba'adi baadi-ra...narnayand]. They should not
then dispute with each other, or rebut one another's speeches in religious

> matters. And if anyone in the Bayan rejects another he must give 95 (19x5)
> mithqals of gold to [the BabT messiah] Him whom God shall manifest, and to
> none other, who will if He please remit it, or take it (SWEGB: 372-3; P.Bay.

5:16,177f).

Here, it is with the Persian phrase hubb-i Ishan ba'adf ba'adf-ra.... namayand like
several Arabic phrases incorporating one or more uses of ba'ad, that the Bab expresses
a reciprocity or mutuality of love among the ahl al-bayan (Babis) (cf. Wehr, Dictionary'', 82).
God's greatest (a 'gam) love (cast mTdarad) he states, is that the 135bis express this
reciprocity of love for one another. This Browne finds a sign of NT influence. A "love ethic" is
indeed mentioned a few times in the Johannine literature and is hinted at elsewhere in the NT
(e.g. Matt 5:43-4; Jn 15:12, 17; 1 Jn 2:10, 3:10, 4:7ff, Rom 13:8). This ethical teaching though
is something fundamental to many Persian Sufi mystics and a part of the spiritual discipline of
numerous Sufi orders. The Bb's statements in P.Bayan 5:16 could be equally and more
satisfactorily accounted for through the influence of the Sufi love ethic.

Various mystical doctrines associated with lyubb (love) are also clearly in evidence in
the Bayans of the Bab as well as in several of his other writings; most notably his Sufi
influenced QA and Sufi addressed R. Dhahabiyya. In the QA 88 the "love" motif is introduced
into the Q. based account of the primordial angelic prostration (Q.Kassis, 1067-8). Heavenly
angels arrayed about the Dhikr were commanded to fall prostrate before the Bab in the "path
of Love" (sabil al-hubb). This is stipulated in the celestial umm al-kitab (Archetyal Book) (QA
88:355). Then, speaking of primordial and celestial affairs in QA 109, the Bab states:

> We, in very truth, affixed to the mightiest Throne (al-'arsh al-a •gam)before Our
> servant [the Bb] the kalimat al-hubb (Word of Love) such that God, His angels
> and his chosen ones (awliya) in every respect witnessed his [the Bb's] truth...

(QA 109:436). •

QA 91 contains an address of the Bab to the ahl al-hubb (community of love), j!)ossibly

members of the Dhahabiyya Sufi order of Shiraz' or other Shirazi Sufis known to the Bab as
persons who fostered a condition of spiritual hubb (love);

> 0 community of love (ahl al-Iyubb)! Hearken unto my call from the Light of mine
> inmost heart (nonT al-f0 'ad) nigh the celestial masfid al-aqsa (furthermost
> Mosque cf. Q.17:1), in very truth, about the elevated Throne of God (arsh
Allah)._ (QA 91:364).

Here, as elsewhere, there are signs of the Bab's association with Sufis from whom he
was probably influenced in the direction of a mystically oriented love ethic (T.Basmala, 361;
cf. T.'Asr, f.96ff). At various points in his P.Bayan the Bab reflects and develops themes
ascribed to the female love mystic Rabiya al-'Adawiyya of Basra (d.c.185/801) who is especially
famous for her poetical celebrations of spiritual love (malyabba) and intimacy (uns). Her
somewhat detached love mysticism is echoed and made communal in the writings of the Bab.

In P.Bayan 7:19 (on Salat) the Bab defines true ibadat (worship) in a distinctly
Rabran fashion when he directs that God should be worshipped intensely, outside of a fear of
Hell-fire (nar) or the hope of Paradise (jannat):

> So worship God in such that if your worship of him lead you to Hell-Fire (WO,
> no alteration in your worship (parastish) would be produced; and similarly, if it
> should lead you to Paradise Oannat). This alone should characterize the
> worship which befitteth the One God. If you worship out of fear (khawf ), this
> was and has ever been unseemly relative to the expanse of the Divine sanctity
> (bLsat-I quds-I ilahr) and in view also of the stipulation of the Divine Oneness
> (hukm-i tawlyrd). Likewise, if your gaze is upon the attainment of Paradise
> Oannat) you would be adding gods to God (mushrik) [in your worship] even
> though created humanity desires Paradise (jannat) thereby. Both Hell-Fire (nar)
> and Paradise (jannat)serve and fall prostrate before God. That [worship] which
> is worthy of his Essence (dhat-i 0) is to worship him for his own sake. This
> without fear of Hell-Fire (nar) or hope of Paradise Oannat). When true worship
> (tahaqquq-I ibadat) is offered, the worshipper is preserved from the Hell-Fire
> (malyfoz az nar) and enters the paradise of God's good-pleasure (/annat-i rida-
> yi a), though this should not be the motive of one's action (P.Bay. 7:19, 271-2).

Such passages appear to be inspired by the well-known and much cited devotional saying of
Ralf a quoted towards the beginning of Farid al-Din 'Attar's Tadhkirat al-awliya' (Memorials

On the Dhahabiyya Sufi Order see Gramlich,1965 1:14-26. This Order is traced back to its
alleged founder, Sayyid 'Abd-Allah Barzishabadt (d. 872/1467-8) whose silsa/a branches off from the
Kubrawi master Sayyid Muhammad Narbaksh (d.c. 869/1464). On the 19th century Dhahbiyya of Shiraz
see Lewisohn, 1998-9 (BSOAS, 61).

of the Saints):

> 0 God, if I worship Thee for fear of Hell, then burn me in Hell, and if I worship
> Thee in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise; but if I worship Thee for
> Thy own sake, grudge me not Thy everlasting beauty (tr. Arberry, Tadhkirat: 51).

Apparently addressed to a certain Mirza Ab01-Qasim, a Dhahabi murshrd known as
MTrza Baba (also Jawad?) the love ethic is in evidence in the Bab's R. Dhahabiyya (1262/1845-
6). Its lengthy opening prayer includes the words of the Bab, "Thou assuredly know, 0 my
God, that I do not love that I should love Thee save by virtue of what Thou do love" (Dhah.
86:75). Later the Bab appears to refer to himself as being upon the slat a/-1.7ubb (Path of love)
which is the basis of faith (als1 al-ayman) and the Tree of certitude (shajarat al-Tqan). Probably
attempting to break down the looseness of Sufi non-exclusivism, he addresses his questioner
saying,

> 0 thou who gazes out with equity and love (bil-insaf wa7-1.7ubb)! Such is the
> decree of every religion (kull al-din), so don't make the issue difficult for yourself.
> Ponder then upon the station of the Balance (maqam al-mrzan) (R.Dhah.

In Shri Islam love for God, Muhammad, the Imams and fellow Shil Muslims is a
central ethical teaching. Important to the Bab and BA*, the Khutba al-tutunfiyya, (<-2.1), for
example, has it that 'Ali uttered the following almost Christian soteriological message
expressed therein, "then hold to the walsT (legatee) of your Prophet (= Imam 'Alf) through
whom is your salvation (najat), for, through love for him (bi-hubbihi) on the [eschatological]
Day of Gathering is your abode of salvation" (BursT, Mashariq, 66). At one point in his Sharh
al-ziyara al-Ahsa'T teaches that it is love for 'All which is the foundation of Paradise (S.Ziyara
IV:167).

A multi-faceted love ethic is foundational in many branches of Sufism and Islamic
mysticism. It has its foundation in numerous Islamic traditions and hadith qudsf 1 (Nasr
1S1:108-9, Graham, 1978<-- 3.1). It is expressed in a multitude of Sufi poetical and
theosophical writings (Giffin, 1971; Bell, 1979; Khairallah, 1980; Schimmel, 1978: 130ff). While

al-Jab iz (d. 255/868-9) wrote two treatises on ' ishq (passionate love) Avicenna penned
another. Scores of statements about divine and human hubb and ishq (love and spiritual
yearning) were made by later Muslim writers. Throughout the poetry of Jalal al-Din Rarra (d.
627/1273), for example, there are numerous musings upon the intricacies of divine and human
love (Chittick, 1983:194-231). 'Ayn al-Qudat HamadanT (d. 525/1131) as evidenced in his
TamhTdat and other works, considered theo-erotic love as "The very constitutional foundation
of creation, of being, of living, and of dying." (Dabashi, 'Any al-Qudat, 420). Many other Persian
Sufis thought similarly.

It is not at all necessary to seek NT influence to account for the place the Bab gave to
the love for God and for fellow believers. It is astonishing that Browne should have bothered
to list such a loose alleged sign of Gospel influence. Spiritual and mystical concepts of lyubb
are an important aspect of the thought of the Bab as they are in both Sufism and Shrism. The
Bb's use of hubb is more likely rooted in Sufism and Shi s ism than the result of any familiarity
with the Gospels. The Q. as expounded within Persianate Islam has much to say in this
respect.
• [5] The Golden Rule in the Gospels and the Persian Bayan.

> 0 People of the Bayan! Whatsoever you do not desire [approve] for anyone do
> not approve for your own self (P. Bay. 6:15, 231)
> This negative form of the 'golden rule' is rooted in Greek popular morality as
formulated by Sophists. This golden rule is the maxim enjoining one to treat others as one
would wish to be treated oneself (Hamerton-Kelly, IDB(S): 369-70). In either a positive or
negative form it is registered in a multitude of Jewish (Aristeas, 207;Tobit, 4:15 Sab. 31a.,
cf.Deut 15:13; Lev.1918), Christian (Matt 7:12, cf.5:33f; Lk 6:31., cf Jn 15:7; Didache 12.,
Barnabas XIX.5), Islamic and other (i.e. Hindu and Buddhist) literatures. It will be seen here
that the Bab was most directly influenced by Islamic forms of the golden rule not though NT
references as Browne supposed.
A ShTs i Islamicate conflation of a negative form of Matt 7:12/Lk 6:31 and Matt 5:39b/

Lk 6:29 is reported by Imam Ja sfar al-Sadiq as the words of Jesus son of Mary to some of his
disciples. It reads,

> Whatever you do not wish to be done to yourself, do not do the same to anyone
> else. And should anyone strike your right cheek then let him strike the left also
> (MajlisT, Bihar 2 14:287).

The line of the P.Bayan 6:15 cited above could be viewed as a fairly precise Persian
version of the first part of this Arabic conflation of Jesus' words. In this light direct appeal to NT
influence is again unnecessary. Forms of the golden rule attributed to Muhammad and others
are common in Islamic ethical literatures. In the Sunni Kitab al-'arba'in (Book of the Forty
[171adith]) compiled by al-NawawT (d.676/1277), for example, the following tradition, found in
both BukharT and Muslim, is recorded on the authority of Aba Hamza Anas ibn Malik,
(Muhammad said): "None of you [truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes
for himself" (K. Arba'Tn / Forty Hadith, 56-7, Hadith,13).
II [6] The sanction on buying and selling in the mosque (IV.17)

It is not lawful to transact business (bara)in the precincts of the House (hal al-
> bayt). Whomsover desires to elevate this sanctum (00 above [all such matters]
> should feel free to appropriate whatever is in the sanctum 04 even though its
> owner is not at all satisfied therewith. God is the more rightful owner of (Allah
> ahaqq)this property (milk)than that servant who has simply possessed it for a
> few years (PB 4:17,145-6 [Arabic synopsis] cf. SWEGB:359).
> You shall not transact business with what which belongs to God in the precincts
> of the House (al-bayt) or the Mosque (al-masjid). You all should submit as
> much of your possessions (property, al-milk)as you are in a position to, within
the [sacred] boundary (hadd) [of the Mosque?]...

The Sanctified Mosque (masjid al-haram) indicates the birthplace of
> man-yughiruhu Allah and that is also where I was born... Say: the Seat of
> Abmad [Muhammad] [ is there and is the object of] My Remembrance (maq'ad
> ahmad dhikri)(? Cf. Q. 54:55). He enters therein and it is there that you should
> perform your devotions. You should not turn towards my house (bayti) neither
> towards the [other] seats [shrines of the 'Letters of the Living?'] unless you have
> sufficient means on the path and will not be saddened [on account of travelling
> difficulties].... (Ar. Bay. 4:17a, HasanT, 88).

In his Bayans (Per. & Ar.) 4:17 the Bab forbids buying and selling, the condcicting of
business affairs, around the sacred bayt (House), apparently relative to his own house in
Shiraz which also appears to be that of man yughlru-hu Allah and hence described as the

masfid Allah (Mosque of God) and the masfid al-haram (Sanctified Mosque, a qur'anic term
normally descriptive of the Ka'ba at Mecca, Q.2:144 etc.,Kassis, 888-9).

Bayans 4:17 is an example of the Bb's appropriating, and to some degree upgrading,
Islamic piety by giving it something of a messianic application. Bearing in mind that certain laws
of the Bab reflect his attempts at establishing a perfect earthly paradise reflecting heavenly
archetypes and opulent alchemical substances, it is worth noting that an Islamic tradition cited
by Bayazid al-Bastarni (d.c. 261/874) and others has it that "In jannat (Paradise) there is a
market where there is no buying and selling" (cited Chittick 1S1:405 cf. Ibn 'Arabi, al-Futahat,
11:682)

The Q. and numerous Sunni and Shil sources have it that the masfid (mosque, lit.

'place for prostration') is primarily a sacred location for community worship (Q. 2:144; 9:17-18;
7:32 etc). It is secondarily a place of assembly thought fitting for various public affairs, having
"political, social and cultural functions" (Salam-Liebich, 'Mosque - History and Tradition'
Enc.Re1.10:121). Often used as a centre of legal, adminisrative and educational activity, the
mosque was thought fitting for the "transacting of matters of public finance and the existence
of a community treasury (bayt a/-ma!). (ibid, 123). In early Islamic times the transacting of
business in the mosques was not entirely forbidden (EI 2 V1:654-5) though there are some early
traditions that seem to regulate or overule this.

The Bb's directive against buying and selling in P.Bayan IV:1 7 corresponds with those
Islamic traditions that consider buying and selling in mosques as something undesirable or
forbidden. A tradition relayed through the forbears of Ibn Shuayb recorded in the (Sunni) Kitab
al-masafid (Book of Mosques) within the Sunan of Ab0 'Abd al-Rahman al-Nasa'i (d.303/915)
reads, "The prophet [Muhammad] forbade group meetings before salat (prayer) on the day of
gathering (Friday), as well as the buying (al-shira) and selling (al-bai) [of goods in the
mosque]" (Sunan, 2:47-8). Similar traditions are also recorded by Ab0 Daw0d and Tirmihdi
(Numayni,1978 II: LIV. No. 116,page123). There may well be Shi si traditions to this effect
though they   do not seem to be common.

That the Bab apparently reacts against commercial activity in mosques may reflect
those Shis T traditions which highlight their supreme sanctity, especially that of the masfid a/-
haram. Ja s far Sadiq transmitted the prophetic tradition "When you arrive at the gate of the
mosque know that you have approached the gate of the house of a mighty King" (Bihar            2

83:373-4 [339ff]; JTIanT, Misbah, 1:86-90; TibrTzT, Faraid ).

Despite the considerable differences in location, detail and purpose, Browne found
something of a parallel between P.Bayan .4:17 and the Gospel story of Jesus' cleansing the
Temple, the Jerusalem House of God. While Jesus threw out the moneychangers from the
Temple the Bab would have all goods in the sanctum of the Mosque belong to God by virtue
of their being placed in this sacred region. Again, rather than invoking Gospel influence Bayans
4:17 reflect the Bb's mercantile and Islamic background as opposed to the Gospel account of
the cleansing of the Temple. For the Bab the eschatological call for a higher degree of piety
relative to new sacred regions and centres of pilgrimage is what is focussed upon. There are
no obvious textual or other relationships between Bayans 4:17 and the Persian Gospel versions
of Jesus'' cleansing of the Temple' (Matt 21:12-13; Mk 11:15-18; Lk 19:45-8;Jn 2:13-17).
• [7] Dying to God (P.Bayan 11.8; 111.13; V.3 ).

The following are some of the passages which Browne most probably thought reflected
Gospel [NT] influence upon the Bb's understanding of 'dying to God',

On the exposition of the reality of death (haqTqat al-mawt); an ultimate reality
> (al-haqq)... Whoso inwardly knows "death" is eternally dying before God (lam
> yazal mayyit an 'Ind Allah) for such an one has no will other than God's will and
> such is his "death" (al-mawt) before the Point of the Bayan (nuqtat al-bayan =
the Bab) (P.Bay. 2:8, 33, 36).

All the [Divine] Names and similitudes (asma' va amthal) of the Ultimate Reality
> (haqq) are within the Ultimate Reality (dar-i haqq) and all such as are outside
> the Ultimate Reality (da—i haqq) are outside the Ultimate Reality (al-haqq)...
> Should any person truly be an sArif (mystic knower) he would assuredly die
> in Him (b/-C mayyit migardad) and before His Divine Will (nazd-I mashiyyat-i
> 0)(P.Bay. 3:13, 93).                                                           (
> The Bab's complex ideas about dying (death, al-mawt) are registered in the lengthy
eighth gate of his P. Bayan (23-31; cf. A.Bay. 2:8, 84) and elsewhere (P.Bay. 3:3, 84) though

hardly, it appears, in P. Bayan (5:3, 157-9). It must suffice here to note that P. Bayan 2:8 is a
lengthy consideration of what constitutes the reality of death (haqTqat al-mawt). Physical and
other modes of 'death" (al-mawt) have limitless meanings for the Bab. "Death" takes on further
senses when associated with a new theophany or manifestation of the shajarat al-tawhId
(Tree of the Divine Oneness). Several non-literal senses of "death" are expressive of a
collective, universal "death" implicit in five partial shahada like testimonies commencing with
the particle of negation, 1( la= "no"). For the Bab they are suggestive of mystical "death" and

an expression of inappropriate faith affirmations (P.Bay. 2:8, 33-34, cf. A.Bay. 2:8) .

Browne did not specify precisely which Gospel (NT) texts he thought influenced the
Bb's ideas about "death". He most probably gave weight to the mayyit b/-u, "dying in Him"
(loosely "dying to God") in P.Bayan 2:8. Browne evidently found these references evocative
of NT texts, most probably those commencing with the Greek spatial b./ (= "in          ") though
the notion of 'dying to God' is not a commonplace in the Gospels (or the rest of the NT). It was
perhaps the case that the Persian mayyit b/-a reminded Browne of such Johannine phrases
as tv Xpio-r6.) (in Christ), tv Xpio-r4) 'Iwo° (in Jesus Christ), Iv !cupid) (in the Lord) (Jn
14:20; 15:4-10; 1 Jn 3:24; 4:13-16). Other predominantly Pauline (and pseudo-Pauline),
occurrences of ev Xpicrub (in Christ) and tv Kupici) (in the Lord) occur twenty times each in
Romans and I Corinthians and a few times elsewhere (Phil. 1:1,14,4:7; II Car. 5:17 etc.; TDNT
X:537ff; EDNT1:448; 2:459).

The phrase 'dying to God' (so Browne) as "dead in Christ" occurs only a few times in
the NT. 1 Thess. 4:16 has it that those "dead" (Gk. nekros) "in Christ" (veKpoi tv Xpio-r6) =
Christians) shall "rise first" at the parousia, the second coming of Christ (cf. Jn 5:25, 280.
Christian martyrs would seen to be those referred to in the beatitude of Rev. 4:13 as "the
dead" (oi vexpol) who from henceforth die "in [the] Lord" ( tv Xpio-rth) (cf. also Rom 1 6:8; Col.
2:20 and 2Tim. 2:11). Henry's Martyn's Persian translation of the aforementioned NT passages
does not suggest any close textual parallelism with the relevant passages in the P. Bayan of

the Bab.

Browne's proposal of direct NT influence upon the Bab is unnecessary and
> unconvincing. This in view of the varied and common Islamic concept of doing things ft- Allah
> (lit. 'in God') evident in the Q. 22:78 and Q. 29:69 (NOldeke on -- ft Allah "in God" in NOldeke-

permanency, subsistence) (lit.) "in God" (cf. Q.55:26-7).

In tracing the roots of the concept of persons dying "in Him" or ft- Allah ("in God") in the
Bab's writings one must again bear in mind the widespread use of these phrases in Sufi
literatures where --- fi Allah (— in God') and related terminology is very common. The Bab is
again much more likely to have been influenced by the Sufi background than by the few NT
phrases mentioned above. NT influence upon fi'Allah(= Per. bi-O mayyi t...) is assured though
it predates by hundreds of years the time of the Bab and the 19th century Persian Gospel
translations (<--4.2).

From early Islamic times Muslims appropriated Christian terminology associated with
doing something if Allah (lit.'in God') including 'dying to God' ("in God"). Goldziher, as long
ago as 1888 had ably demonstrated that Muslim expressions of doing something ti- Allah were
the result of NT- Christian influence upon early hadith and other Muslim literatures.' He

See the appendix to his essay, 'The hadith as a means of Edification and Entertainment' (Eng.

trans. in Goldziher (ed) Stern vol. 11:145-163 detailing NT influence upon hadith literature written in 1888
(Eng. trans. In Stern 1971 vol.11:346-362). This appendix is further supplemented by Goldziher in his
article, 'Neutestamentliche Elemente in der Traditionslitterature' in Or/ens Christianus 11 (1902), 315-22.

Goldziher gives several examples of the above from Sunni hadith collections as well
as the following statement from the 4th ShrT Imam, 'Ali Zayn al-'AbidIn (d. 95/713) regarding
"the jiran Allah (protected of God) who "sit together in God, practise common devotional
exercises in God, and together go on pilgrimage in God (natal alas filiah wa-natadhakar fi'llah
wa-natazawar fIllah) (al-Yaq0bill:264-5 cited Goldziher, ed. Stern, 11:356 underlining added).1

Though the Bab strongly criticized anything suggestive of a pantheistic wandatal-wujüd
which compromised God's being 'wholly other', his writings do suggest a deep mysticism
surrounding the believers self-effacement in the mashiyyatAllah(The divine Will) centred in the
maghar-i ilahf (divine manifestation) through a "death" of self (mayyit) in its ultimate reality
(al-haqq). This has no close NT parallel but many Sufi parallels. In fact the Bab is not so far
removed from the Great Shaykh (lbn al-'Arabi) who championed a via negative as well as a
mediatory al-Insan al-Kamll and various kinds of unitative spiritual conditions expressive of
dying to God (<--P.Bay. 11:9).

It is also pertinent to note that within the writings of the mystically oriented philosophers
of the Safavid period such as Fayd al-Kashani (d. 1099/1679), there are discussions of these
matters. In Kashant's Kallmat-I maknDnih (Hidden Words) there is a section entitled "The
discourse [word] (kalimat) in which is an indication of the significance of al-fana' tr Allah
([mystical] dying in God) and al-baqa' till-Ilah (eternal abiding in God)". Without going into
details, it is explained that gnostic initiates (ahl-marifa) teach that the intention of "the death
(faaa) of the servant (abd) in the ultimately Real (God, haqq) is not fana'-i dhat, (the
extinction of his personal essence [in God]) but rather the (mystical) death of self (fana)before
the dictates of His law (fanajaht-i bi-sharfat-i a)in the direction of that "Lordship" which results
from complete servitude before the al-haqq , the Real-God sabublyyat-I haqq) (Kashani,
Ka//mat, 116).

1 For further examples of the Muslim use of if Allah in the Q. and in select 1.7adith qudsr(<-2.2)
see Graham 1978 which also registers some learned comments of NOldeke (d.1930) on the use of II-Allah
in the Q (Graham, 1977:143 referring to Noldeke-Schwally 1:257).

The foregoing seven 'signs' of Gospel influence suggested by Browne in the Bb's P.

Bayan provide little or no solid evidence of the ShirazT Sayyid's direct knowledge of the
Gospels (NT). As far of I am aware there is nothing in the Bob's other writings which clearly
indicate his direct knowledge of the Bible. Unless better evidence is forthcoming it can be
assumed that the Bab never cited the canonical NT nor any other biblical texts. It is likely that
he bypassed existing Persian and Arabic translations because of his extreme veneration of the
Q. The pristine Bible had its spiritual essence assimilated into the Arabic Qur'an (<-). For the
Bab the tawrat and /null were expressions of the sublime word of God but scriptures
appropriate to a previous religious theophany (<--).
II 7.4 The Bible in the address of the Bab to the Letters of the Living.

Attention will now be focussed upon a Gospel informed speech of the Bab which he
allegedly delivered to his first disciples, the 'Letters of the Living'. Some statements of Amanat
about the Bb's knowledge of the NT in his 1989 Resurrection and Renewal will also be
critically surveyed.

In1888 a leading Baha'T poet and teacher then resident in 'Akka named Mulla
Muhammad and known as Nabild ZarandT (1247/1831--1310/1892) was commissioned by BA*
to write a history of the BabT-Baha'T religions. This, it seems, in order to supercede an
inadequate history "from the year 60" (1260 =1844 CE) written by BA*'s long-time amanuenses
Mirza Aga-Jan Khadim-Allah (d. 1319 /1901). Subsequently, from Dh01-Qada 1305/ July-
August 1888 ZarandT began to compile a lengthy collection of historical sketches and
associated notes, an initial draft of which was completed on 19th Jumadr 1 1307 (= 12th
January 1890). After taking account of BA* and AB*s suggestions the revised 1014 page
(each page being 25x21 cm. and having 22-24 lines) manuscript was completed on 26th Rabi'
1 1308 (10th Nov.1890). Among other things this work included coverage of the pre-BabT
Shaykhism of the first two Shaykhs continuing up till the time of completion (1690) and
dominated by the person of BA*, his writings and his major disciples. This work came to be

known as the Tarikh-i NabI1-11 Zarandi .1

ZarandT's apologetically and hagiographically oriented salvation history begins with a
citation from a fasting Tablet of BA* and a poem revolving around his theophany. There follow
three pages of gematric and theological considerations of BA*'s name 171usayn and the
mysteries of al-ism al-a'gam ("The 'Mightiest Name of God") as bahJ', ("splendour" -->
7\.20 in the light of Islamic hadith, the al-hurafat al-muqatta'a (the isolated letters of the Q.)
and aspects of 'ilm-i -hurOf (the science of letters) ( Zarancil, mss. 1-4 in Rafati, 1996: 87 cf.
760\. A few pages later (page 6ff) Zarandi explains how he came to write his history which he
prefaced (page 8f) with a list of topics covered and details regarding key BabT-Baha'T
informants. Then begins the work proper. It is impossible to adequately assess its style and
contents without full access to the original text which has not been available for scholarly
examination for many years. Only a few isolated pages of the original Persian have found their
way into print.2

The TarTkh-I ZarancIT has never been wholly published in the original or in translation.

What is now known is (largely) the result of SE*'s 1932 publication of his selective English
translation and thorough reworking of parts of the first portion of ZarandT's history of the Bab
and Babism. This he entitled the Dawn-Breakers Nab/Is Narrative of the Early Days of the
Band'i Revelation (1st ed.1932. 685pp). It appears to be selective 'recreation' of narratives
contained in the (largely) initially ShaykhT prolegomenon and BabT portion of the Tarfkh-i

Some details about the unpublished Tarrkh-1 NabIl Zarandf can be found in Vahid Rafati's 1996
article 'TarTkh-1 NabTI ZarandT' in Khoshiha-y/ az khanna—I

-     adab va hunar. vol. 7 (Proceedings of a
seminar on Nabil-I a'zarml ZarandT), 76-87. In the following paragraph's I draw primarily on this article by
Rafati, the only easily available first hand account of the Haifa located mss. Cf. MacEoin, Sources, index,
As far as I am aware very few Baha'T or non-Baha'T scholars have been allowed to examine or
consult ZarandT's original papers constituting a recension of the Tarikh(= in part the "Dawn-Breakers").
For reasons that are not entirely clear, contemporary Baha'T authorities are loathe to allow scholarly
examination of the Persian-Arabic originals in their possession. I was informed in 2000 that the Haifa ms.
of Zarandi is not in fact the final recension incorporating all the revisions and suggestions of BA* who
apparently regarded ZarandT's theological Tarikh as lacking concrete historical details. The fully revised
edition of ZarandT was apparently appropriated by opponents of BA* and is not now in the archives of the
Bahl World Centre (Haifa, Israel).

Zarano7. The ShaykhT period presents Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kazim as harbingers of the
BabT (-Baha'i) religion. Then, after detailing aspects of the life and writings of the Bab, it
continues up until the time of the Mazandaran upheaval (1852).1

For the 20th century Baha'T international community, SE*'s English language Dawn-
Breakers occupied a central place in BabT-Baha'T salvation history. SE* lavishly praised
Zarandi's history and directed western Bahals to study it. Baha'T teachers and missionaries
should evangelize after the sacrificial example of the Babis of the Dawn-Breakers. From the
time of its translation it became a kind of touchstone for assaying the value of other BabT (-
Baha'T) historical works. In the late 1950s, for example, zealous Iranian Baha'Ts in the light of
a letter of SE* dated 15th Sept.1932, tried to suppress other histories thought to contradict the
Dawn-breakers which they viewed as a virtually infallible work.
• The NT in the Bb's alleged address to select 'Letters of the Living' (mid. 1844).

Reckoned the twelfth of the nineteen apostles of BA*, the abovementioned Muhammad
'All NabTl-i Zarandi was a zealous Baha'T propagandist and a poet of considerable talent
(Browne, LHP 1V:151,187 fn.). He was also an insightful apologetic historian of four decades
BabT-Baha'T experience (ZarandT, 1923[95]; KhOsh-1 ha, no.7). Involved in Babi activities since
the TabarsT episode, ZarandT had many key first-hand informants for his detailed and highly
significant though not infallible, hagiographically oriented, istidlaliyya informed history.

Of the various addresses included in the English Dawn-Breakers of ZarandT [SE*]
(completed c. 1308/1890-1 1st pub. USA. 1932) there exists an address of the Bab (without
any isnad /     chain of authorities) allegedly delivered to most of his first disciples, the 1.7uraffati-/
1\.7.9yy (Letters   of the Living) before sending them out to proclaim his mission in the summer of
1260 /1844 (DB [SE*]:63-5). As translated and doubtless to some extent "recreated" by SE*

The Tarikh-i Zarandr has never been wholly published in the original Persian (andl Arabic) or
in any other language into which it might have been translated. On its publication history see Rafati,
1996:83f. All partial publications of the Tarrkh-1 Zarandf are translations from SE*'s English version. An
Arabic translation entitled Matä'ff al-anwar (Cairo, Egypt, 1941) was made by the Egyptian Bahl 'Abd
al-JaITI Bey Sa'd (d.1942) but was banned and the original print run appears to have been destroyed by
the Egyptian authorities. A Persian translation from the English via the Arabic (!) was made by Ishraq
KhavarT (d. 1971) with a similar title and was first printed in 117 BE = 1961 (?).

(Rabbani, PP: 215) this address incorporates phrases and citations which echoing ascribed
to Jesus in the Authorized ('King James', 1611) NT version. The 'Sermon of the Mount' (Matt
5:1ff and Lk 6:17ff) and words attributed to Jesus as he addressed his own disciples as they
embarked on their missions (Mk.6:7f; Matt.9:35f; 10:1f; Lk. 9:1f,10:1f) account for many of
these allusions. SE*s translation of the bulk of this speech is as follows (with select NT
references and key NT phrases in capitals):

The miscellaneous quotations and allusions to the NT record of Jesus' words in his
'Sermon on the Mount', 'Mission of the Apostles' and elsewhere have been thought to underline
the Bab's familiarity With the NT. After selectively citing passages and references from this
address of the Bab Amanat comments, "These and other remarks appear to be free references

1 Two of Amanat's biblical cross references footnoted to these last two sentences, "Scatter
throughout the length and breadth of this land..." (fn. 240 = cf. Matt11:3) and ".. I am preparing you for the
advent of a mighty Day" (fn. 241 = cf. Matt. 10:7, 23) are meaningless. They have no bearing upon the
Bab's alleged NT allusions. Several of the biblical references in R&R are erroneous.

to the Gospel" (R&R:198). This is largely correct' but these citations and allusions are not the
Bb's own "free references". It is methodologically very suspect to make this assertion on the
basis of the English of the Zarandi / SE* recension of an address only indirectly attributed to
the Bab. Neither the Bab's early writings nor his later works contain anything comparable to this
speech. Even the English introduction to this speech has it that these words are only the like
of what the Bab might have said to his first disciples: "With such words the Bdb quickened the
faith of His disciples and launched them upon their mission" (DB :65).

ZarandT / SE* also have the Bab himself say, "In words such as these He [Jesus] bade
them arise and fulfil their mission" (DB:63). In the light of these points it is not surprising that
SE* who himself framed the address in AV/King James' English), in a 1934 letter advised
Baha'T readers not to take the speeches attributed to the Bab and BA* in the English Dawn-
Breakers as their "exact words" but, rather, as "the substance of their message" ( SE*,UD:
433). It is surprising that this address of the Bab has been taken by Amanat to highlight the
Bb's personal knowledge of the NT and of Christianity.

In taking the Zarandi/SE* DB address to be a testimony to the biblical knowledge of the
Bab it would also be necessary to assert that he knew the Hebrew Bible in the AV. This in that
the last sentence from this address (DB:65 cited above but not by Amanat) contains AV biblical
English terminology rooted in the Hebrew Bible by making reference to the "mercy-seat of
God". This phrase is biblical English deriving from the Tyndale (1526) Bible version
subsequently taken up in the 1611 AV. The AV 's "mercy-seat" has no obvious Arabic-Persian
or Islamic equivalent. It translates the Hebrew kapporet (Exod. 25:17ff etc) which designates
the place of expiation (Lat. Vulgate = propitiatia)which is the golden lid covering the Ark of the
Covenant containing the two stone tablets of the law. This golden lid is the "mercy-seat" , so-
called because it was sprinkled with sacrificial animal blood to atone for the sins of the

1 The Bb's references to the apostles of Jesus (hawariyun) are few and far between. See, for
example, QA 63:255 (EGB. Coll.f.109a), a passage inspired by Q. 3:52f and T Kawthar, (EGB Coll. Or.
F10 (7), f.91a) (cf. P.Bay. 2:9).

Israelites (Lev.16:14-15).

In the Greek Septuagint    (LXX )   the Heb. kapporet is often translated by the Gk.

tillasterion (TO 1Xcarnip Lo y ) which influenced the English rendering "mercy-seat" in the Greek
(Pseudo-Pauline) book of Hebrews at 9:5 (cf. Rom. 3:25) which is the only NT use of this
English phrase. This takes us far from language and concepts the            Bab   might have used in an
1844 address. Amanat makes no reference to this Zarandi/SE* AV biblical phrase in the Bab's
address. It doubtless originated with SE* who used "mercy-seat" ten or more times in
translating from the writings of the Bab and BA*. 1 The original behind "mercy-seat" in DB:65
may well also be (Ar.) al-arsh though this tells us nothing at all of the Bab's knowledge of the
intricacies of the HB. It testifies to SE*'s delight in the beauty of the biblical English of the AV.
He used it freely in beautifying and "westernizing" the words of the Bab and BA*.

In the light of the above it can hardly have been the case that the Bab "took his
references direct from the Gospels" (so Amanat R&R:198) and allegedly had, as Amanat puts
it, an "above average" knowledge of the NT (R&R:00). This "above average" knowledge of the
NT is that of Zarandi as put into AV English by SE*. It can be confidently asserted that the          Bab

himself never uttered the Zarandi/SE* Dawn-Breakers address as cited above (<-- DB:63-5).
The address to the Letters of the Living appears to have been primarily authored by Zarandi
and subsequently brought into line with biblical AV English by the Bahl Guardian. There is
nothing comparable to this Dawn-Breakers address in any of the authentic Persian and Arabic
writings of the Bab known to the present writer.

The widely travelled ZarandT most likely authored words used by SE* as a basis of the
Bab's address to his disciples. Prior to writing his history (in 1888) Zarandi doubtless had
considerable dialogue with Christians in the Ottoman empire and in the 'Akka-Haifa region

On occasion SE* used "mercy-seat" to (non-literally) render al-'arsh (lit. the Throne) in QA 91

though the 'arsh of Islamic -Babi cosmology has nothing to do with expiation (SWB: [QA 91] ] 451tr. 68).
In translating alwah of BA* in his Prayers and Meditations of Band'u'llah (1st ed. 1934) SE* also at one
point used the English "mercy seat of Thy Oneness" to render the Arabic 'arsh rahmat wandaniyyatika
(lit. Throne of the mercy of Thy Oneness" ) (P&M No. 184, 323/Ar. 216).

where there were several churches and numerous Christians. He could easily have gained a
knowledge of Arabic and / or Persian translations of the NT as did many other Bahals of his
generation, including MTrza AbOl-Facll Gulpaygani (d. 1914) and Hajji Mirza Haydar 'All
IsfahanT (d. 1921). It could well have been his knowledge of the Bible that enabled him, at
Alexandria in August 1868, to convert a Protestant physician named Faris EffendT (d.18??
unknown?) whom BA* subsequently addressed as (a probably honorary?) usqüi al-nagri
("one of the bishops of the Christians") and to whom he wrote at least two weighty Arabic
Tablets (ZarandT, Tarikh tr. in Balyuzi, BKG:265ff; Lambden, 1993).

Zarandi had ample opportunity to learn about the Bible/NT. He would very likely have
familiarized himself with, if not memorized such central Gospel passages as the 'Sermon on
the Mount'. Then, in writing his history, he might have gained inspiration from the NT record of
Jesus' address to his disciples before sending them out on their evangelical mission (<--). This
line of approach may best account for his drawing on NT passages to fill in lacunae in BabT
history. The Dawn-Breakers address of the Bab cited above is best viewed as a piece of
Christian-Baha'T inspired salvation history of the late 1880's and early 1890s updated in highly
biblicized form in the early 1930's by SE*. The Bab's words were created in order to provide
a befitting and wonderful address for the new messiah who was seen to take on a Christ like
prophetological persona. In similar fashion ZarandT / SE* had also used and adapted a version
of the Islamic account of Jesus' first day at school to provide hagiographical inspiration and
precedent for the account of the Bab's first day at the school of Shaykh sAbid (Lambden, BSB
1/4 [1983], 22-32 = 1986:1-31).

The Bab's 1260/1844 speech to the bulk of his Letters was greatly favoured by SE*. It
was highly inspirational for many of its Baha'T readers of western Christian background. This
is evidenced by the fact that the address was several times separately printed in addition to

numerous printings of the English Dawn-Breakers.' It served to inspire western Bahals in the
propagation of their religion (RabanT, PP:217f; SE* MIS:299; ). As a piece of salvation history
it was very effective though it can hardly be deemed historical or to be what the Bab might
himself have uttered. It has no bearing at all upon the Bab's alleged knowledge of the Bible or
his self-understanding.
II Unfounded assertions of Amanat in his Resurrection and Renewal

Amanat's understanding of the Bab's address to the 'Letters of the Living' and of wider
issues relating to the Bab's knowledge of the NT and of Christianity are set out in his 1982
Oxford University doctoral thesis, a revised version of which was published in 1989 by Cornell
University Press with the title Resurrection and Renewal, The Making of the Babi Movement
in Iran, 1844-1850, (= R&R). Both the thesis and the book contain a number of statements
about the Bab and the influence of the NT upon him. Almost everything said in this area is
either demonstrably false or based on very scant evidence indeed.

In R&R:142 Amanat asserts that "There is enough evidence that even in the early
stages, prior to his proclamation [May 1844 CE], the Bab had access to recent translations of
the New Testament, though probably not the Old Testament". The evidence for this is spelled
out in a footnote (no.174). Therein Amanat sketches the availability of Persian translations of
the NT/ Bible. First, the availability of these translations has nothing whatsoever to so with the
Bab's actual possession or use of them. For this there would seem to be no reliable primary
evidence at all. Amanat then asserts that, "Constant references in the Bayan, and in his earlier
works to Jesus and to "the letters of the Gospel" (i.e. Christians) and their faith, leave little doubt
as to his direct knowledge of the Gospel" (R&R:142) This is entirely misleading. While there are
a fair number of references to Christians in the P. Bayan and a few other late works, detail is

Collins records several American printings of the 5 or so page 'The Bab's Address to the Letters
of the Living' (New York: Baha'r Pub. Committee, 193?; 1949; 1953; 196?) (Collins, 1990:8). It was also
included, for example, at the end (pp. 20-22) of the commemoration of the centennial anniversary of the
'Martyrdom of the Bab 1850-1950' (np .nd. [1950]) by the NSA of the Baha'Ts of Australia and New
Zealand.

lacking as it is in the Bab's "earlier works". In fact references to the "letters of the Gospel" (=
Jesus' disciples, Christians) are not particularly numerous and show no indication at all of NT
influence. There is nothing which leads the reader of the Bab's early works to substantiate
Amanat's over confident and misleading assertion that there is "Little doubt as to his direct
knowledge of the Gospels" (R&R:142).

The Bb's references to Christians are more likely accounted for as born out of his
admiration for Christians and Europeans gained during his time at Bushire or merchant years
in Shiraz and Bushire. Amanat's footnote to the above cited assertion (fn. 75 p,142) refers the
reader to his Ch.4 and to the (Persian) Da1,171-1 Sab717 52-3 for "references to the Gospel".
While the information in Ch. 4 will be dealt with below, the passage in the Persian Da1071-i
Sab7h allegedly containing "references to the Gospel" reads as follow:

> And now that the bearer of the divine ordinance (satub-i hukm = the Bab) is
> manifest with evident proof and certain testimony, they (Christians, etc ) have
> remained wrapt up in veils. Like the Christian community (ummat-I 7.sa)whose
> priest-monks (rahban)indulged in austerities (r)'aclat maashrdand)in order to
> [befittingly comprehend] a single ordinance (hukm) in conformity with the divine
> good-pleasure [as stipulated] in the Gospels (Injil). And [then] the messenger of
> God (rasül Allah= Muhammad) was made manifest as the fountainhead of the
> divine ordinances (masdar-i ahlram-i ilahr)and they remained wrapt up in veils.
> Still they indulged in austerities (riyaclat mikashand) in order to comprehend the
> divine good-pleasure [regarding messianic expectation] in the Gospels WI).
> Now bear witness how the well-being (rizq) of the veiled ones [Christians]
> ended up such that they were in a state of error (mahall-i idni?). Not a single
> one [Christian] is looked upon favourably, for he only operates according to the
> parameters of his own destiny. And one and all [of the Christians) act bereft of
> understanding save, that is, such as God has accorded [true] salvation (najat).

This passage contains no Gospel references at all and shows no special knowledge of
Christians. In Islamicate fashion it simply states that the most pious Christians failed to
comprehend the advent of Muhammad as the one promised in the Gospels. They largely
remained veiled to both the messianic advent of Muhammad and that of the Bab.

It   is in Ch.4 of R&R that Amanat refers to the speech attributed in Zarandi/SE*, to the
Bab (<--).   After correctly reckoning ShI s ite traditions "the main impetus for the Bab and his
followers", he states that these were "not the only sources of inspiration" (R&R:196) and

continues,

> The speech the Bab delivered to his disciples in the summer of 1260/1844, just
> before departure to their assigned missions, also shows traces of Christian
> influence. He even drew a direct comparison with Christ and his disciples. After
> expressing his hopes for the progress of the movement and emphasising the
> moral strength and sacrifice needed for fulfilling their mission, the Bab cautions
> his followers to shun any hesitation or weakness that might lead them to retreat
> and silence. He then directly refers to the words of Jesus (R&R:197)

It is evident that Amanat takes the NT allusions in ZarandT/DB* speech of the Bab to his
Letters (which he cites) as evidence of the Bb's making direct reference to the "words of
Jesus" (Amanat, ibid). The following Gospel references are given in R&R;198 (fn.239),
"Compare to Matthew 5:14-16 (cf.10:27), 11:27; 5:13; 10:11-14, 20 (also Luke 9:5)
respectively." They are followed by a sentence asserting that "Nabil makes no specific
reference to any of the Gospels" which is evidently intended to affirm their going back to the
Bab himself. Amanat thus implies that though the Bab knew the Gospels, ZarandT did not! In
the light of what has already been argued it will be evident that the opposite is far more likely
to be the case. The Dawn-Breakers Gospel allusions only inform us about the knowledge of
Zarandi/SE*. Having largely correctly identified though wrongly attributed certain of these NT
allusions Amanat also makes the following bold yet mistaken assertions,

> This preoccupation with Christ was beyond the common Muslim knowledge of
> the time, which was mainly confined to the Qur'an and other Islamic sources. He
> must have taken his references directly from the Gospel , the study of which had
> given him an understanding of revelation and divinity somewhat different from
> that of the Qur'an. No doubt the Bab found the personality of Christ appealing
> and his message of affection and self-sacrifice in conformity with his own.
> Traces of Christian doctrines of Trinity and Atonement is apparent even in his
> earliest works (R&R:198)

The Bab did not exactly have a "preoccupation with Christ". His knowledge was not
exactly "beyond the common Muslim knowledge of the time" because his attitude towards the
Bible was something wholly different to that of most of the Shis T apologists of his day (<--4.4)
A careful examination of the Bib's references to Christians indicates that he was not at all
preoccupied with Christ but deeply concerned over heretical Christian Trinitarian concepts and

the related Christian rejection of Muhammad.

Most of the Bb's major works contain not "traces" of Christian Trinitarianism but Q. like
refutations of "trinitarianism" and other forms of heretical shirk (associationalism).1
Commenting on Q. 2:111 in his early T Baqara the Bab denies both Jews and Christians a
place in Paradise on account of their various forms of shirk (associating gods with God).
Christians will not enter paradise who associate (1) themselves, (2) Jesus and (3) God in haykal
al-tathilth, in a "tritheistic configuration". For the Bab God is not "a fourth among four" or the
"third of three" (cf. Q. 5:77, etc). His Oneness precludes any direct link between his Essence
and his creation. (T. Baqara, f.254f).

A cross is basically the intersection of two lines transverse to each other which became
a widespread symbol of life in pre-Christian antiquity. From the 2nd cent. CE the cruciform
became an important symbol of the Christian religion on account of Jesus' death by crucifixion
(Grossi, 'Cross' EEC 1:209). As far as I am aware, the Bab does not refer to the atonement or
to Jesus' crucifixion but repeats a tradition about the origin of the Christian symbol of the cross
as associated with a concept of the incarnation seen as something heretical not soteriological.
The Bab refers to the shakl al-salrb (form, shape, symbol of the cross), to the origin of the
form or symbol of the cross. The following tradition (1.7adrth) usually attributed to the
Muhammad, is quoted many times in the major and minor writings of the Bab. Though his
quotations sometimes vary slightly an example is shown below along with the translation:

,eo.,..p.tv.i.., .- ,J6,11:Ajjc„.4......rr,L1,--,L,„...A.,

13[10111), QA 61:245; QA 91:365; QA 72:250; T.Asr:f 84ff,98;T.Ha' (1):4, 238f, 257f; Q.Zavarih:423ff.
S.Ja'far 96:51).

> The hadith of the Prophet [Muhammad] .. in refutation of the Christians: 'And
> from this [shape] the Christians took the form of the cross (shakl al-salib) and
> the descent (hall) of the Divinity (a/-/hat) into the human sphere (a/-nasal).
> But exalted be God, Lofty and Mighty, above that which these transgressors
> assert.'

This tradition has no relationship to Christian atonement but is critical of the Christian
incarnation as symbolized in the "cross" seen as a talismanic sign of the heretical conjunction
of lahat (divinity) and nasal (humanity). The shakl al-tathlith ("threefold form") has multiple
senses in the Bab's writings though whenever it indicates the Christian trinity it is always
something categorically rejected. According to tradition, the MandT, if not the Qa'im, is to
destroy the "cross". He is not, as Amanat implies, to embrace or repeat a Christian doctrine of
atonement. The number of times the Bab cites the above prophetic tradition about the folly of
Christians at having adopted the shald al-salib (form / symbol of the cross), might lead one
to think the Bab was inspired by the tradition of the eschatological destruction of things
cruciform.

Amanat's second sentence cited above (R&R:198) again presumes the Bab's direct
reference to the NT for which there is no evidence. His fn. 243 has it that such is evidenced "in
his commentary on Sara t a/-Bagara, INBA no. 64, 298" though there is no such page
reference in this INBA volume neither does the T. Baqara contain any non-Islamicate or
canonical NT citations. This same fn. also refers to the Bab's "letter in reply to questions by
Mtrza Muhammad Sald Ardistani" though this reference is also incorrect containing nothing
supportive of the Bab's direct knowledge of the NT or his understanding of Christian doctrines.

INBMC 69:424 has no reference to anything appropriate to Amanat's argument. On the
following page of this source, however (= INBMC 69:425), there begins the "Reply to three

This boxed text is excerpted from the Bab's Q. Zawarih 69:425. See also T. Baqara f.195

(Q.2:62); T. basmala, f.339(b); T. Kawthar, f.19b; T al-Ha' (1): f. 268; T. 'Asr 69: f. 29; T AkhT 14: f.414;
Q. Hafiz : f.79-80; Untitled :INBMC14:163-80. It can also be noted that the use of the Syriac loan words
làhütand nasal for "divinity" and "humanity" has a long history in Islamic Trinitarian discussions as can
be seen in the use of these terms by the Zaycli al-Qasim b. Ibrahim, in his Radd 'ala al-Nagra, 317ff;
al-kiallaj, and al-ShahrastanT in the section of Christians in his al-Milal 2:220 where a Christian opinion
is expressed to the effect that Jesus' ascension involved awareness of al-lahat (Divinity) in/through at-
nasüt (the humanity).

questions of Mirza Muhammad Sa'id Zavarih ( = Mirza Muhammad Sa s id ArdistanT?) about
the Basil al-haqiqa and other matters". In the course of commenting on the BasTt al-haqTqa
the Bab does assert the transcendence of the divine Essence and make some anti-Trinitarian
statements. The single divine Reality cannot be either a "third between two" (la thalith bayn-
huma) or the a "third aside from two" (thalith ghayr-huma)(69:423). After citing the al-Kaff of
KulTni and further underlining the divine transcendence with reference to the qur'anic, anti-
Christian Trinitarian phrase thalith al-thalatha ("third of three", Q. 5:73), the erroneous nature
of proponents of basil al-haqTqa (the singleness of the Real) which presuppose a multiplicity
of the divine Reality is clear. In this connection the Bab also cites the prophetic hadIth about
the heretical Christians derivation of the shakl al-salTb ("form of the cross") through belief in
incarnation, that there was a "descent of divinity (lahl7t) into the human realm (nasat). (INBMC
69:425)

There is no evidence in the sources cited to substantiate Amanat's proposal of the
Bb's knowledge of the Gospels or of the intricacies of Christian theology. Neither is there any
trace of his affirming the Christian "doctrines of Trinity and Atonement". NT reading did not
give the Bab a concept of "revelation and divinity somewhat different from that of the Qur'an".
His statements in this respect are not NT or Christian rooted but perspectives based upon his
championing of an apophatic theology and a Shi s T, Q. rooted anti- wandata/-wujad(existential
oneness) and anti-Trinitarianism.

When, furthermore, Amanat asserts that there is "No doubt" that "the Bab found the
personality of Christ appealing and his message of affection and self-sacrifice in conformity with
his own" one might ask where he finds evidence of the Bb's knowledge of the "personality of
Christ" or the Christian message of "self-sacrifice" to assume such an influence. One would
be better advised to look towards the centrality of the Shi'T notion of the sacrifice of Ilusayn at
Karbala rather than to NT teachings.                                                     I

Finally in connection with Amanat's statements regard ing the Bab, the NT and
Christianity, it may be noted that the Bab's "ideas of the Second Coming" were not a blending

of the "apocalyptic role assigned to Jesus in Shi s ism" with the apocalyptic eschatology of the
NT but an expression of Shri ideas of the "return" of the Qa'im without any significant NT
input. It is not so much that the Bab as the Qa'im is a suffering, sacrificial messiah like Jesus
but that he is a Qa'im whose universal and successful jihad was thwarted and one who
expected martyrdom like many of the twelver Imams without reference to the sacrifice of Jesus.

Neither mainstream twelver Shr ism nor Babism have any real place for a parousia
("second coming") of Jesus to enact another sacrificial death or martyrdom. The Bab's rare
references to his own martyrdom have no connection with those of the NT Jesus. It was not,
as Amanat asserts, that "The Christlike Mandi of the Bab saw salvation in suffering rather than
in violent revanchism." (R&R:198) His "preoccupation with theophany" might have led some of
his opponents to accuse him "of believing in Christianity and preaching the Trinity" though this
is merely the repeating of some uninformed remarks of such as would make his teaching
dependent upon unorthodox Christian heresies. These, in fact, the Bab did much to dispel.
• Concluding Note

To sum up, while the Bab was subject to some general western and Christian influence
his direct familiarity with the Bible is very unlikely. E.G. Browne's arguments for his being
influenced by the NT are very flimsy. Amanat's statements are largely unfounded. The evidence
of the Tarrkh-i ZarandT in the form of the Dawn-Breakers saying anything historical about an
alleged speech of the Bab to most of the Letters, is very weak. It may be that a thorough
examination of more of the Bb's extensive Persian and Arabic writings (not all available) will
expose elements more suggestive of his having read the NT but any marked biblical influence
can safely be ruled out. The Bab's own writings contain no biblical citations and no definite
indications of biblical or Christian theological influence. The Bab yet had a very high Islamic
type estimation of Jesus (cf. Ibn al-'Arabi), referring to him in his Tafsir man 'arafa nafsahu
as the ashraf al-anbiya' ("noblest of the prophets") (T.Man, 74). Christian influence 'upon the
Bab   was minimal. As Amanat rightly states "Whatever the effect of Christianity on his ideas,
the Bab was still firmly tied to Shi'ism" (R&R:198).

Chapter Eight
BAHA'-ALLAH, THE MIGHTIEST NAME OF GOD AND THE
EMERGENCE OF THE BABI-BAHA'T INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE

• 8.1 Isralliyyat and Bah'-Allah (1817-1892) as the personification of

the ism Allah al-a:zam (Mightiest Name of God).

This final chapter will contain a brief introduction to BA* and his writings and examine
how and why he came to adopt the divine attribute baba' (Ar. radiant "Splendour") as the
Isralliyyat rooted locus of his identity regarded as the quintessence of the ism Allah a/-a'zam
(the Mightiest Name of God) personified in him. BA*'s early attitude towards the Bible and
biblical tahrff will then be surveyed (= 8.2). This will be followed by some conclusions to the
thesis along with a few remarks about how a neo-Shri MDT faction (= Babism) evolved into
the global Baha'T religion of the Book' (= 8.3).
I Beha' -Allah the follower of the Bab (1844/5 - 1863 [66])

On the orders of Nasir al-Din Shah's new grand vizier, MTrza Taqi Khan, Amir KabTr (d.

1852), the Bab was publicly executed as a dangerous religious heretic in the public square in
TabrTz on July 9th 1850. Some time prior to this he had communicated an undoubtedly
authentic five page Arabic waslyyat-namia (Will and Testament) to the Name of God al-Azal
(Eternity)) indicative of BA*'s half-brother MTrza Yahya Nonl (d.1914 CE) whom he accorded
a key position pending the future theophany of "Him Whom God shall make manifest" (INBMC
64:95-102; Haifa mss; cf. Nicholas, 1905 [B6yanA], 52f). Towards the beginning of this
Wasiyyat-nama the Bab made cryptic reference to himself or, for Bahals, to BA* (cf. GWB
CXIII:207) 1 as one hayy fi ufuq al-abha ( "living in the Abha Horizon", INBMC 64:96; BWC.
Ms. [unpaginatedj 2). The word abha here is the superlative form of the verbal noun baha'
(splendour, beauty). It is this word which, along with derivates from the same Arabic root and

According to at least one of his "seals" of the Edirne period (?) (BVVV: 4 +Taherzadeh, RB 1,
photograph opposite 78x) BA* states "God testifies by virtue of His own Self that I, verily, am one that
is alive in the Abha (most beautiful) Horizon and at every instant cries out from that Horizon, 'I, verily, am
God, no God is there except me'". Elsewhere, in numerous a/w.41.7 BA* associates himself with the Bob's
phrase ana hayy fi ufuq al-abha. An example would be the untitled Tablet of BA* in La'alf3: 15.

phrases containing the word baba' which BA* identified as the ism Allah al-a'zam, the greatest
or mightiest Name of God. 1

Babism only just survived the Bab's execution. In surviving it most significantly gave
birth to the conservative AzalT Babi faction led by Mirza Yalya, (per.) Subh-I Azal (The Morn
of Eternity) and the globally-minded, progressive Baha'T religion semi-publicly initiated by BA*
in May 1863. These two neo-BabT factions both stem from these two NorT half-brothers. From
the early 1860s BA* claimed to be the BabT messiah man yuzhiru-hu Allah and ultimately the
promised messiah expected in past major religions.
• MTrza H usayn 'Ali NOM Baha'- Allah and his writings

Allegedly a descendent of Keturah wife of Abraham and the last Sassanid king
Yazdigird III (d. 651 CE) , BA* was born in Tehran on 2nd Muharram 1233 AH (November 12th
1817 CE), being two lunar years older than the Bab. His father, Mirza 'Abbas b. Ricla-Kuli
Khan NOrT (d. 1255/1839), a notable calligrapher entitled MTrza Buzurg by Fath 'All Shah, was
a native of Takor in the district of Nor in the province of MazandarAn (Iran) A one time vizier
to the twelfth son of Fath 'All- Shah MTrza Buzurg was a close friend of MTrza AbOl-Qasim
Khan Qa'im Maqam (d.1835) the previously mentioned author of a response to the missionary
Henry Martyn (<--4.4). A man of some wealth and influence during the reign of Fath 'Al! Shah,
he married seven wives and fathered at least fifteen children.      MTrza 11   usayn 'Al! BA* was the
third child of his second wife Khadija Khanum.

BA*'s childhood and youth were spent in Tehran and Mazandaran. In the former city
he had personal tutors engaged by his parents from whom he acquired, among other things,
a knowledge of Persian literature, the rudiments of Arabic grammar and the Q. He did not

'

receive any systematic or extensive theological training and, like the Bab drew on Q. 7:156,
in referring to himself as al-ummT ("unlettered"),

Zarandi [SE*], AB* and other Bahälhistorians also record that some months prior to his death
the Bdb penned 360 derivatives of the word band' in a fine shikastih ("broken script"), in the form of a
calligraphic pentacle and arranged for it to be delivered to BA* (DB: 370+fn. AB* Magala tr. 26).

> The learning amongst men I studied not; I did not enter the theological colleges
> (a/-madaris). Enquire of the city wherein I dwelt, that you may be assured that
> I am not of those who speak falsely (Lawh-I Sultan 148).
> We did not enter the theological colleges (al-madaris) or study learned themes
> (al-mabahlth). Hearken unto that through which this al-ummi (unlettered one)
> summoneth you unto God, the Ever-Abiding (Aqdas :121).

BA* later frequently claimed receipt of divinely inspired knowledge. In his L. 1:11kma
(187?/8?) he intimates how he received such inspiration independent of actually acquiring it
through reading and study,

Thou knowest full well that We (= BA*) perused not the books which men
> possess and We acquired not the learning (al-'ularn) currently amongst them,
and yet whenever We desire to quote the sayings of the learned (bayanat al-

'ulama) and of the wise (al-IA/lama), presently there will appear before the
> face of thy Lord [= BA*] in the form of [revealed] tablets (a/w gh) all that which
> hath appeared in the world and in the Holy Books (al-kutub) and Scriptures (al-
> zubur). (L. al-hikma, 127-8/tr.TBAA.,148-9; see also, L. Bismillah MAM:281;
> L.Shaykh, 13/tr.11; FayciT, Band'u'llah 18ff )

While Bahn writers tend to minimize the nature of BA's early education such AzalT
writers as 'Izziyya Khanum (an AzalT half-sister of BA* ) reckon that he acquired knowledge
by intensive study and by associating with Sufis and sages (hukama2. 1 On his father's death
BA* refused to follow in his footsteps. Then twenty two years old his religious interests and
pietistic inclinations made him reluctant to embark on a worldly career. 2 Baha'T sources have
it that   Mulla H usayn BushrO'T (the first believer in the Bab) indirectly informed BA* of the rise
of the BabT cause (late 1844, early 1845?) through Mull Muhammad-I Mu'allim (-I NOrT). He
straightaway became a staunch believer (ZarandT/SE*, DB:71f). Soon after his conversion he
dedicated himself to the success . of the Ban religion and its evolution.3
According to ZarandT, BA* was a key participant in the BabT conference of Badasht (in

'Compare AB* Mufawaclat..1 tr. SAQ:33, (talk of April 18th 1912 in) PUP:25 and 'IzzTya Khanum,

1919 in Herrick, Unity Triumphant, 156...

3 0n BA ' s earliest activities as a Bahr see for example, Balyuzi, BKG:39-42; ZarandT, [SE] DB:75-85;

western Khurasan) held in the summer 1848 CE. There the fullness of the Bab's messianic
claims were openly discussed and made known. A representative of the progressive, 'radical
BabT faction', BA* is said to have conferred new names on each of the 81 (= 9x9) or so Babis
present. He came to be known as Jinab-I Baba: (lit. 'His eminence the Splendour') hence his
later title Baha i-Allah ('the splendour [glory] of God') (DB:211).

Following a 10 month stay in Karbala (Iraq; Sept. 1851 --> July1852?), BA* returned
to Tehran (August 15th 1852) shortly before an abortive attempt on the life of Nasir al-Din Shah
s. 1848-96) by a small group of militant BabT activists. Though unconnected with this activity,
BA* was imprisoned with other Babis in the Siyah-Chal ("Black Pit") dungeon in Tehran for four
months (Sept. --> Dec. 1852?). There he had mystical experiences which led him to claim to
be a maghar-i ilahT (Divine Manifestation) c hosen by God to regenerate the then fragmented,
persecuted and demoralized BabT community. In his Persian Rashh-I 'ama i (The Sprinkling of
the Cloud of Divinity, early 1269 AH/ late 1852 CE?) and later writings BA*, dwelt on this call.
In the late L. Shaykhh (lbn-I Dhi'b = ESW c. 1891), for example, he explains how he meditated
"day and night" on the conduct of the Babis and decided that on his release from the Siyah Chal
dungeon he would attempt to regenerate them. He has thus explained his dream;

> During the days I lay in the prison of Tehran.. I felt as if something flowed from
> the crown of my head over My breast, even as a mighty torrent that precipitateth
> itself upon the earth from the summit of a lofty mountain. Every limb of my body
> would, as a result, be set afire. At such moments my tongue recited what no
> man could bear to hear (BA*, L. Shaykh 25/tr. SE* ESW:22).1

On the basis of such passages Baha'is view the Siyah ChM imprisonment in the year
nine (= 1, 269 AH)2 as the year of BA's call to maghariyya, though he claimed pre-existent
subordinate divinity. His mystical experiences in that place and the appearance to him of a hurl
("celestial Maiden") have been likened to Moses' Sinaitic call, Jesus' baptismal commission and

See also, idem, Lawh-l-Sultan in A.Muluk:148,190 (cf. AB* SAQ:79,141,143 S.Haykal AQA:.
4:269 (tr SE* GPB:101-02).

In certain of his writings the Bab had alluded to the importance of the 'year nine' (see for example, Persian
Bayan). This year is understood by BMW's to be the year 1,269 AH (=15th October 1852--4th October 1853) and
seen as the period of BA*'s assumption of Prophethood.

> Muhammad's confrontation with Gabriel on Mt. Hira (SE*, GPB:101). His forty year prophetic
ministry (1852-1892) is believed to have begun at this time.

Despite BA's early identification of himself as the returned Imam Husayn and his
mystical experiences in the Siyah Chai in Tehran, the majority of Babis continued, right up until
the mid. 1860's, to regard MTrza Yahya as the head of the BabT community. BA*, the founder
of the Baha'T religion, was exiled from Iran to Iraq (1852) then to Istanbul and Edirne in Ottoman
Turkey (1863-68) where he broke with MTrza Yahya (mid.1866) after a failed mubahala
confrontation. In 1868 he was again exiled to Acre coming to live in its Palestinian vicinity
(Mazra'ih, Bahr° within Ottoman Turkey for the remainder of his life (1868-92).
• The writings of Baha'-Allah.

From being a leading Iranian and Iraqi Babi (126011844-->1863) until the time of his
passing in Acre Palestine in 1308/1892, BA* wrote in excess of 15,000 religious commun-
ications in Persian and Arabic largely in the form of allah ( "scriptural tablets"). They vary in
length from a few words to several hundred pages and date from the last 40 years of his life
(1852-1892 CE). For the most part they are letters written in honour of, or in reply to questions
posed by Babis and Baha'Ts. Though largely untitled, a proportion of the more weighty,
doctrinally significant writings have specific designations (perhaps 300-500 of them)? It is in
line with the conviction that they were expressions of wahy (divine revelation) or kali/flat Allah
(Word of God) like the (original) Tawrat, WI and Q., that they were often designated alwah
('tablets', sing. lawh) following the use of this term in the HB and the Q.

The titles BA* himself gave several hundred of his works often relate to major themes
within them or the identity of the recipient(s). Some major revelations are designated sarahs
(sing., sorah, pl. suwar) like 'sections' or "chapters" of the Q., others, for example, are
considered kitab (= 'writing, letter, books' pl. kutub), sahrfa ("scrolls"), risala (= 'epistle,
tract..,') and tafsTr (<-3.1 commentaries). By the time of his residence in Edirne BA*' claimed
to have revealed the equivalent of all pre-BabT divine revelations. Then, towards the end of his
life he estimated that his collected writings would fill 100 volumes (Lawh-/ Shaykh, 134-5, 195

/115,165). Apart from thousands of letters to communities, groups and individual BabTs and
Baha'Ts, Baha'T scripture includes epistles addressed to Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, Sunni,
Shil and ShaykhT Muslims, AzalTs, diverse oriental rulers, diplomats and freethinkers and a
number of Western monarchs.' Between 35 and 40 major titled writings date from the Iraq
years (1853-1863), perhaps 50 from the Istanbul-Edirne period (1863-1868) and perhaps 200
or more from the West Galilean ('Akka') period (1868-1892). 2 Many of these texts contain
interpretations of biblical and quranic rooted Isra'Tliyyat motifs and episodes and hundreds
expound a range of biblical texts.
II The Judaeo-Islamic Mightiest Name of God, the word baha' and Baha'-Allah.

As a leading BabT, BA* identified himself through the word baha' ("radiant splendour")
as the personification of the ism a/-a'gam, the Mightiest or Greatest Name of God. His earthly
theophany came to be theologically represented as an eschatological doxophany, a radiant
parousia of personified, supernatural divine radiance. BA* frequently articulated his claims in
the light of Jewish, Christian, Islamic and Balm texts. His pictured himself as the radiant
manifestation of the long secreted (Ar.) baha' (splendour-beauty) of God (= Bah'-Allah). In
the paragraphs to follow it will be seen how the basically Isra'iliyyat motif of the Mightiest Name
came to be chosen by BA* as the locus of his person and theological identity. A trajectory of
a few aspects of its Jewish, Islamic-ShaykhT and Babi-Bahal history will be outlined in
illustration of how this Judaic-rooted motif, ultimately became the touchstone of later Baha'T
identity, graphically portrayed on the Baha'i ringstone and elsewhere.

The supreme or Mightiest Name of God (Heb. ha-shem ha-gadol) concept has largely
Jewish origins though Hellenistic magic, esotericism and related theurgic ideas doubtless

' In his Sarat al-haykal (AQA 4:273) BA* wrote, "We verily, caused the verses to descend in nine
styles, each of them a testimony to the sovereignty of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting." It is not
clear what is meant by these "nine styles" (shift-In) of revelation though the use of nine is obviously
related to the abjad numerical value of the Baha i , the Baha'T "Greatest name" as contrasted with the five
grades into which the Bab divided his writings.

2A list of 154 major allah of BA was given by SE* in various volumes of The Band il World. (cf. Ishraq
Khavarrs Genf/ Shayigan.).

shaped some aspects of the background(s) of Islamic and Babi-Baha'i developments. In the
HB the personal though supernatural Deity has ten or more principal names, including the
common Semitic name 'El ( 17N "God") and related theophoric designations such as 'El-ElyOn
(God-Most High"), 'El-Shaddai ("God All-Powerful"?) and 'Eleiah ("God" cf. Allah), sElOhlm
("God" =                 Centrally important Names of the God of Israel are the tetragrammaton

(Heb. =           YHWH) and Adonai or "Lord" ('adOnaT        T) the vowelling of which enables
it to be (un) pronounced as nrr ("Jehovah"), although it should properly (?) be Yahweh (cf.

Yah; YHWH Seba'Ot = "Lord of Hosts").

From several centuries BCE the traditional pronunciation of YHWH was only uttered
annually by the high priest in the Jerusalem "Holy of Holies". This, among other factors,
encouraged numerous speculations as to the nature, identity, power and sanctity of this
transcendent divine Name within the Abrahamic religions. Its power was such that according
to many Jewish and Islamic texts it gave the prophets and others favoured souls the power to
perform miracles. In the Gk. LXX (2nd-3rd cent. BCE?) YHWH is translated theos ("God") or
apLoc (= Kyrios, [lit. "Strong'?] "Lord"). It often appeared in magical amulets of the first few
centuries CE as the all-powerful name (Gk.) iaa, Magically inscribed or conjured along with
the names Adonai and (the angelic Deity) Abraxas (both related to YHWH), it was such that
it could be said, "When this name is but spoken, the earth moves from its foundation" (cited
Ringgren TDOT V:509).

Post-biblical Judaisms, especially varieties of Jewish mysticism and esotericism, added
many sometimes novel, hypostatic, occasionally magical, theurgically meaningful, qabbalistic
and talismanic Names of God. Certain of the Qumran texts ("Dead Sea Scrolls"), include
passages referring to God by means of the "great Name" or reflecting a 'Mightiest Name'
theology. In, for example, col. IV of 4Q504 [4QDib.Ham a ], 'The 'Words of the Luminaries', a
petitioner refers to Jerusalem as the place which God chose, "for your Name to be there for

ever." Apparently in eschatological times God- the Name is to sit there for ever enthroned. This
such that all countries could vision His "glory" and bring offerings of gold, silver, precious
stones, "all the treasures of their country" to his "great Name" to the honour of Israel and Zion
"your holy city and your wonderful house" (cf. Haggai 2:7) (trans. Martinez, 415). Many Rabbinic
and later Jewish mystical texts celebrate God's Mightiest Name.

In the Hekhatot Zutarti (The Lesser Palaces) and other Merkabah texts (2nd- 6th
cent. CE?) the power of the Name is greatly lauded and celebrated (HekhalotZutarti, 337/347
tr. Schaefer 1992:56). This text also mentions the great "Name" of God as being of cosmic
potency. Through its instrumentality Moses "was able to part the sea and pile the waters up into
high "mountains". The divine essence is made up of powerful, sacred Names forms of which
were handed down throughout history by Balaam, Moses, the Angel of Death, David and
Solomon (ibid, 357ff). Some of these Names are preserved in a long unintelligible chain
incorporating angelic names and such names of God as Shaddai ("All-Powerful"), Qadosh
("Sanctified" ) and the biblical (folk etymology) rr.,rrkt   r7rmt ( s ehyeh   asher 'ehyeh' tr. [AV]
"I AM THAT I AM" Exod 3:14 <--2.1).

Some permutations of the "Name" of God given in Rabbinic, Jewish mystical and
qabbalistic texts, are complex many letter "Names" or secreted formulations. Some are said
to consist of 12 letters, others 42 letters while some "Names" are "unintelligible nomina
barbara incorporating Greek words. Islamic and Bati-Bahal sources likewise speak of God's
"Greatest Name" as something supremely powerful, incomprehensible or secret. This has
something of a precedent in Rabbinic concepts of God's shem ha-meforash, his "Ineffable" or
"Inexplicable" Name (Marmortstein, 1968).

In Islamic tradition God's Names are variously listed, most famously in prophetic hadith
listing his much commented upon 99 al-asma' al-husna (The most beautiful Names) (Bihar2
4:184ff). A prophetic tradition cited by al-Faycl al-Kashanr in his Nawadir al-akhbaij has it that
God has 4,000 Names some of which are known only to himself. 1,000, furthermore, are known
to God and the angels, another 1,000 to God, the angels and the prophets and the fourth 1,000

are known to the believers, 300 being in the Tawrat, 300 in the InjTI, 300 in the Zabar and 100
in the Q., 99 of these are evident (zãhir) and one of is "concealed" (makhtem). Whosoever
knows this latter hidden Name, the tradition continues, "will enter Paradise (al-jannat)" (cited
KashanT, Nawadir 110). The same source cites a tradition from Imam Ja'far Sadiq about his
Mightiest Name (ism/hi al-a'gam) which partly reflects Jewish traditions:

> His Mightiest Name consist of 73 letters, 25 letters of which he gave to Adam,
> and 25 of which he gave to Noah. Abraham was given 8 letters and Moses four
> letters while Jesus was given two letters through which he revived the dead and
> cured the blind and the lame. Muhammad was given 72 letters. And he
> concealed one letter perchance he might know what is within himself and know
> what is in the selves of his servants (cited idem, Nawadir, 110 from a 3rd cent.
> AH source).

This and similar ShrT traditions about the 72 or 73 letters of the al-ism al-a sgam and
their gradual disclosure to a succession of Abrahamic prophets in succeeding religious eras
sometimes reckoning one of the "letters" hidden (73-1 =72), have influenced the Babi-Baha'T
theology of the Greatest Name (Bihar 2 11:68f). Both the Bab and BA* at times identified
various of these letters contained in pre-Babi sacred books.

Drawing on Qur'an 21:78f and these traditions, the Bab, in QA 59 states that David and
Solomon were inspired with two letters of the "greatest Word" (kalimat al-akbar)-- possibly "B"
and "A" the two letters of bb (?) --- adding that Dhu'l-NOn (= Jonah?), Idris (= Enoch?), Ishmael
and Dhu'l-Kifl (Job or Ezekiel?) were in darkness until they testified to the truth of the "point
of the Gate" (nuqtatu'l-bab= the Bab). In his T Lay/at al-qadr (Q. 97), the Bab explicitly refers
to 3, 4, and 5 portions of one of the forms of the "Greatest Name" existing in the tawrat Mil
and Q. (INBMC 69:17).

Commenting on the basmala and first verse of the Qur'anic SOra of the Pen (Sara 68),
Bah'-Allah mentions that God divulged something (a "letter/ "word" half an)of the "Greatest
Name" as Baha' in every religious dispensation. In the Islamic dispensation, he states, it is
alluded to through the letter "B" (ba'; the first letter of the basmala) and in the GOspels (injil)
through the word Ab (= "Father" Gk. = Tratp), in the Arabic Bible, a two letter word
corresponding to two of the letters of baha' ("A" & "B"). The word baha', BA* indicates, is

clearly intimated in the Babi Bayan and is representative of the nafs (Logos-Self) of God in the
Bahn era (INBAMC 56:25). The Arabic word baha'

- obviously does not occur directly in the NT.

Here its theological equivalent is the Gk. aaa (doxa) which often translates Hebrew 11::
(kabOd ='radiant glory). In the HB and Gk. LXX both these words can be indicative of a radiant
theophanic splendour or "glory". (Exod. 33:18f; Isa. 60:1f; Mk. 8:38). Various suggestive biblical
texts in which these Hebrew and Greek terms occur were referred by BA* to his eschatological
theophany as the al-ism al-a'gam. ("Mightiest Name of God -->).

The Judaic, Isra'iliyyat mightiest Name motif was very early adopted within Sunni and
Shis T Islam. Jewish rooted notions of the powerful al-ism al-a'gam were voiced by various
early ghulat thinkers and later transformed within a more orthodox, evolving Imami, Shisi
theology. Neo-Shri Babi-Bahal doctrines of the ism al-a'gam to some extent have their
Islamic roots in these primitive theological speculations of the ghulat. factions. A fascinating
example propounded by one of these thinkers is that of al-Mughira b. Sa s id al-Bajali (d.
c.119/737), a mawla (non-Arab) of the then governor of Iraq Khalid al-Qasri (105-20/724-38).
Associated with Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (d. c.126/743) his "gnostic" doctrine is said to have
given central importance to the ism Allah al-a'gam To some degree reminiscent of Jewish
Shlur qomah mysticism, God existed in humanoid form for him and his followers. Their
anthropomorphic Deity had "members in the number and form of the letters of the Arabic
alphabet". When God initiated creation he uttered his "Mightiest, Greatest Name" which fell on
Him as His crown" (Madelung, El 2 VI:347-8).

A faction the Mughiriyya believed that at the time of the "return" of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya
(the Pure Soul), seventeen souls among them would be taught one of the letters of the
"Greatest Name" of God. Then, by means of its power, they would wage war and establish a
messianic kingdom on earth. Al-MughTra has been thought to be the first of SIM- thinkers to

s

speculate about the mystical nature of the alphabet (Tucker 1975:34f-).1

Among the influential SunnT Muslims who made considerable use of ism al-a.gam
concepts in his theology of the names of God in the context of esoteric gnosis and magic, was
Ahmad b. 'Ali al-BOnT (d. Cairo, c. 622/1225). He authored forty or more Arabic works and was
known to 19th cent. Shi s T writers including Shaykh Ahmad (5.1f<--).2 Existing in several
recensions his Shams al-ma'arif al-kubra wa al-ma'grif (The Greater Sun of Mystic
Meaning and the Subtleties of Gnosis, pp. 500+) mentions the al-ism al-a'gam and its various
graphic forms on several occasions (Shams, 52ff; 86ff; 93f; 101ff, etc).

The Shams al-ma'arif makes creative use of abjad and other number
correspondences, (magic) number-letter squares and deals with jafr and the construction of
amulets and circles of astronomical, talismanic and magical import. There are detailed
comments upon numerous theologically loaded divine Names and Attributes. Other theophoric
Names including those of the mother of MOsa (Moses), various arcane scripts and components
of the secreted Greatest Name are cryptically discussed.

Angelological and other matters rooted in or expressive of I sralliyyat are also present.

Goldziher, Vajda and others have touched on these Jewish-rooted magical, mystical,
theological and angelological subjects. A close study of the Shams and related works of al-
130nT will undoubtedly reveal important doctrinal links with the talismanic and related 'u/am al-
ghayb (occult sciences) aspects of the sometimes neo-lslamic, gematric, quasi-qabbalistic
gnosis (jafr) of the Bab. The Isra'Tliyyat themes reflected in the Bb's writings sometimes
appear to go back to al-BOnT. 3 The following passage in the Shams al-ma'arif is similar to

An Arab native of Kofa named Bayan b. Sam'an [al-TamTmI] (d.119/737) was a literalist,
extremist leader of the Bayaniyya who came to claim the lmamite. Associated with MughTra and
Muhammad al-Baqir he claimed to operate through the power of the ism al-a'gam (Greatest Name of
God) ( al-Ash'arT, al-Maqalat, 66-67; Hodgson, El 1:1116; Tucker, 1975)

> See his al-Risala al-Rashtiyya (1226/1811), JK 1/ii:63-114; IbrahimT, Fihn:st, No. 104 p,260f;
Momen, BSBM1:113.

That his qabbalistic gnosis may have been directly or indirectly influential upon the Bab is perhaps
indicated by the fact that like the Bab he equated Joseph son of Jacob (abjad= 185) with God, the Self-Subsisting
(al-Qayyam)which ha an identical abjad numerical values (Shams, 185f 481f).

statements of the Bab (<--2.1),

> Know., that the secret of every [religious] community is in its Book and that the
> secret of the Book of God is in the letters (al-hurat) [in which it is written]...
> Within it [the Q..] are the secrets of all the revealed [sacred] Books and Scrolls
> (al-kutub waY-suhuf)[ of the past] and others besides them. As for abjad, it is
> Syriac (al-sulyaniyya) which was the medium of revelation unto Adam, Enoch
> (Idris), Noah, Moses and Jesus (Al-BOnT, al-Shams, 31:3-4).

Such theologically profound aspects of the writings of al-BonT undoubtedly influenced the first
Shaykhi leaders and the Bab whose Arabic style and vocabulary, like that of Sayyid K-azim
Rashti, at times echos that of al-BOni. The Bb's sometimes abstruse writings encompass
similar subjects to those covered in the Shams, including considerations of the divine Names
and attributes, ramz, jafr; talismans, alchemy and the al-ism al-a'zam.

The Shams al-ma'arif identifies and discusses the divine Name through which Moses
was commissioned when God proclaimed , "I verily am God, no God is there except Me". It was
by means of the al-ism al-a:gam that Jesus resurrected the dead. al-Boni has it that Jesus
utilized the Mightiest Name and also uttered various life-giving prayers (Shams I:52f). He
records that Abo Hudhayl transmitted the tradition that Jesus would bow twice in prayer
(raka'tayn)then fall prostrate and address God with the following six Divine Names:

> Ya Qadim (0 Ancient!). Yã Da'im (0 Everlasting!). Ya Ahad (0 One!) Ya
> Wapid (0 Unicity!). Ya Samad (0 Eternal!) (Shams, 54).

Within the Shams al-ma'ard are various obscure, Hebraic angelological Names (with
genitive ix = J ='el "----of God" terminations). Apart from the usual four archangels (Jibril,

IsrafT1 and 'Azra'il, Shams, 76, etc) there is mention , for example, of Asyall, Dunyall,
Hizqiya'il, Dardiya'il, Masmall and Sura s il (Shams, 52-52, 57, 71 cf. Sayyid Kazim, Sh-
Qasida). Vajda has shown that some of these names derive from the Jewish
pseudepigraphical, angelologically intensive incantation textbook, Sepher Ha-Razim (Book of
Mysteries, 4th cent.CE?). This source presents itself as having been revealed to Nobh by the
angel Raziel (The Mystery of God) before he entered the ark. Thereafter it came to be in the
possession of Solomon whose famed wisdom encompassed all secrets (Shams, 1/7, 52- 55,

57,71; Vajda 1948:400; Morgan, 1983; Gruenwald, 1980:224f).

The Safavid theologian and Sufi-inclined philosopher mystic Bahâ' al-Din al-Amili ( <--)

• Shri devotional texts and the Arabic word bahö'

It is the Arabic verbal noun baba' which is regarded by Bahals as the quintessence
of the al- ism al-a'zam, more fully expressed in the title Baha' Allah. This word has a wide
variety of non-theological verbal and nominal meanings and a wide semantic field
encompassing aesthetical and theological terminology. As a Persian (Arabic) loan word it has
other mostly non-theological senses. Drawing on weighty Arabic lexica, Lane's widely
respected dictionary includes the senses 'perplexity', 'incomprehensibility' (cf. Heb. Nin boh 0,
Gen. 1:2) 'poverty', 'goodness', 'greatness', 'perfection', 'majesty', 'magnificence', 'grandeur',
'beauty', 'brilliancy', 'luminosity' and even 'the sheen of the spittle of a lion' or 'the calmness
of a she-camel used to her milker! The semantic field within which the BabT-Baha'T sources
understand the word baha' includes words expressive of 'beauty', 'excellence', godliness,
'divine majesty', 'splendour', 'light' , .brilliancy' and radiant 'glory'.

The Arabic word baha— is probably derived from three ("B"+"H"+"A"/ "W") and made
up of four root letters, ('-'B"+ "H" + "A" + the glottal stop hamza'). Though fundamental to the
Arabic spelling, the final glottal stop hamza (0) is usually omitted in Persian. Bah', in other
words, is made up of the four letters and has an abjad numerical value of nine: [1] "B" = 2 +

For details and examples see, Ibn Manzar, Lisän al-Arab 1:35-6; Dozy, Supplement 1:123-4;
E.W. Lane, Lexicon 1:263-4. Wehr, Dictionary 97;. On Persian usuages and senses see Steingass
1892; Dehkhoda, Lughat Nfirnih, entry Baba'.

[2] "H" = 5 + [3] "A" = 1 + [4] 0 hamza (the glottal stop) ' = 1, total = 9 which is considered by
Baha'is a "sacred number" symbolic of perfection as the highest numerical integer. This number
nine came to be expressed in many aspects of Bahal semi-ritual practises and even configured
aspects of Bahal architecture and the number of persons (nine) serving on certain Bahal
administrative institutions.'

The numerous Shri devotional texts and compilations form a foundational background
to Babi-Baha'i vocabulary, worship and theology. Among important Shi'i devotional
compilations is the metaphysically rich al-Sahrfa al-Sapdiyya (The Scroll of the Prostration)
ascribed to Imam 'Ali al-Sajjad (d.c.95/713), the Misbah mutahajfid al-al-kabir 2 of al-Tasi
(d. 460/1067; cf. B* P. Dal: 66), several works of Racli al-Din Ibn Tawas (d.664 /1226; said to
have been favoured with a knowledge of the ism Allah al-aZam, Kohlberg, 1992:14) including
his Muhaj al-da'wat(The Soul of the Supplications), the al-Misbah ("Luminary") of Taqi al-Din
al-Kaf ami (d.900/1494-5), the Persian Zad al-ma ad (Knapsack for the Eschaton) of Majlisi
and the more recent and very popular Mafatih al-finan (Keys of Paradise) of 'Abbas al-Qurni
(d.1359/1940) (see further Ja'fariyan,1999).

All of these works contain materials of importance in tracing the use of the word baha'

and the devotional theology of the al-ism al-aZam. Among the highly significant supplications
attributed to the twelver Imams contained in certain of these volumes 3 is a dawn supplication
transmitted by Imam 'Ali al-Ricia' (d. 203/818) Du'a al-sahar for the fasting month of
Ramadan (al-Qummi, Mafatfh, 238-9). It is very closely related to a similar Du'a i yawm al-

Just as YHWH has the abbreviated form M I Yah so baha' was sometimes abbreviated by BA*
through its first two letters "b" (u ) and "h" ( .At ) See the colophon ending the Kitab-i iqan, "Thus hath
it been revealed aforetime.. revealed by the "Ba" and the "Ha" [= Baha'-Allah] (KI:2001164).

This work also exists in a shorter though occasionally different recension entitled IlAsbah al-

Mutahaifid al-Saghir (Kohlberg, 1992:272)

The biblically influenced Dua' al-simal (Supplication of the Signs, cf. the testimonia Deut
33:2) has been a much commented upon devotional prayer. It had a significant influence on Babr-Bahair
scripture and lies behind a number of occurrences of the (Islamo-) biblical location Paran (Ar. farm) in
ShaykhT and Babi-Bahal primary literatures (Lambden, 1983b).

> mubahila (Supplication for the Day of Mutual Execration) 1 said to have been transmitted by
> Ja 'far al-Sadiq (al-QummT,ibid., 351-355). Its alliterative, rhythmically intense opening line with
five occurrences from the baba' root (splendour/ beauty/ glory) is as follows,

> 0 my God! I beseech thee by thy band y (Splendour) in its utmost Splendour
> (abha) for all thy Splendour (baba') is truly resplendent (bahiyy); I, verily, 0 my
> God! beseech thee by the fullness of thy Splendour (baha). (al-QummT, MafatTh,
> 238f).

The Arabic text of this Dila al-sahar was centrally important to both the Bab and BA*. The
frequency of the non-quranic word baha' in the writings of the Bab is in large measure a result
of his very frequent citing and reworking of both this opening line and large portions of the whole
supplication. The Du 'a al-sahar (Dawn Prayer) appears to have been deeply significant for the
Bab. He derived the names of the nineteen months of his new bacIT' ("novel", "new") calendar
from recensions of it: month [1] baha' (Splendour) [2] Jalal (Glory) [3] Jamal (Beauty)[4]

'Az/mat (Grandeur) [5] Nor (Light, etc). The Bab creatively re-wrote this Dawn Prayer
perhaps a hundred or more times in his numerous 'stream of consciousness' devotional
revelations. Early in his mission he creatively refashioned the almost identical opening lines of
the Du sa' yawm al-mubahlla (INBA 6006C: [90-95] 92f) as he did very frequently towards its
end; especially in his weighty K asma' (Book of Names) (INBMC 29:4f,26,31f, etc) and K
Panj S., (Book of the Five Grades) (I/1:3f; VII/1:316; VII/2: 224, etc).

BA* has given the DU 'a al-sahar a tremendous gravitas referring to it as the lawh al-
baga' ("Tablet of Eternity"). This in that it commences (clibachth)with the word baha' identified
as the Mightiest Name of God (ism Allah al-a'gam) This was a "reality" with which God

In the Mafatily of al-QummT the recitation by the ShT'T faithful of the Du'o' yawm al-mubahila
is part of the commemoration on the 24th Day of the most sacred month Dhul-171illa which is closely linked
with the celebration of the yawm al-ghadIr (Day of the Pool). For ShT'T Muslims this day was that upon
which 'Alt was appointed waif (legatee) which is set a few days earlier (on the 22nd [or 18th] day of this
month). 'The Day of Mutual Execration' (yawm al-mubalnia) denotes the day on which the Muhammad
engaged in mutual execration (mubJhala) with select Christians of Najran. It was on this Day that he is
believed to have gathered the proto-ShT'T (subsequently named) "people of the cloak" (ahl al-14,2', cf.
Qur'an 33:32) namely (apart from [1] Muhammad himself) [2] 'AIT, [3] Fatima, [4]17Iasan and [5] Husayn.

ornamented his own Logos-Self (= BA*) (AQAMunajat, 45-6). BA* saw the opening words of the
Du'a sahar(= Du'a yawm al-mubahala)as an indication of himself as the refulgent ism Allah
al-agam (Ma'idih 4:23). He cited segments of its opening line in thousands of benedictions upon
his devotees such as the following upon Shaykh Kazim Samandar (d. 1336/1918) from a
1307/1891 Tablet, 'alayhO min kulli baha' bi-ahba-hu ("upon him be a portion of the totality
of bahg '(Glory) at its most glorious") (BA* in AyatB:318-9 No.152).

Among other ShT'T supplications the Greatest Name is said to be contained in the Dawn
Prayer of Muhammad Baqir though it is not explicitly identified with the word baba'. MajlisT in
his Persian Zad al-ma 'ad (Knapsack for the Return) and Kaf amT in his al-11445bah (the
Luminary) and other ShT'T and ShaykhT authorities including the Bab's antagonist Karim Khan
KirmanT (d. 1288/1871) wrote an Arabic commentary on the Du'a al-sahar in 1274/1857 (Sh-
Du'a, 19f; Lambden,1998) all record a tradition that the Mightiest Name is found in this prayer.
The following paragraph introduces the Du'a al-sahar in MajlisT's K Zad al-ma'ad:

> As for the worthy, greatly respect supplication (du'a), it has been related that his
> highness Imam Riga stated that this is a supplication that his highness Imam
> Muhammad Baqir would recite in the mornings. He would say that if people knew
> the greatness razamat) of this supplication before God, the speed with which it
> would [enable the devotee to] be answered, they would certainly kill each other
> with swords in order to obtain it And if I took an oath that the ism Allah-I a'gam)
> (Mightiest Name of God) is in this prayer, I would be stating the truth. Thus,
> when you recite this supplication, recite it with all concentration and humility and
> keep it hidden from other than his people [i.e. non-Shi'is]... (MajlisT, K. Zad, folio
> 63b).

It is obviously not stated that the word baha' is the Mightiest Name within this prayer,
neither does the Bab explicitly state this. Baha'Ts, however, understand it thus, especially
since the word baba' is the first major divine attribute after Allah, itself one possible ism al-
agam (this would make Baha'-Allah a double Mightiest Name). Yet, the personal name Allah
is not exactly "hidden". Thus, in numerous writings BA* underlined the "sealed", "hidden" nature
of the   non-qur'anic (non- 99 Names) word baba'. He saw it as "hidden" in the sense of its being

known and manifest but for most not recognized as the all-powerful ism Allah al-aszam.'

The word baha s occurs thousands of times in Islamic literatures throughout Islamic
history. 2 An early usage is that of the philologist Abi Zakariya' Yatiya b. Ziyad al-Farra' (d.
207/ 822) who wrote a now lost grammatical textbook entitled K al-baha' (The Book of Glory)
(MaanT,11). The epithet Baha' al-Din ((it. 'The Glory of Religion'), for example, had a
widespread Islamic usage from around the 11th cent. CE (Kramers, 1926). Baha' occurs in
several prophetic hadith, several times in the Futahat of Ibn al-'Arab! and in a very large
number of other mystical writings (Lambden,1998). It is found more than 70 times in the
multifarious Shin texts making up the (110 volume) Bihar al-anwar of Maps!.

Islamic tradition lists many different (perhaps over 100) suggested possible Mightiest
Names which cannot all be spelled out here. In, for example, the Misbah of al-Kaf am! and the
Muhaj al-da'wat of Ibn Tawas, the following are among the possibilities that are listed: (1) the
Name Allah, (2) the basmala —followed by al-akbar or al-a'gam(? Imam Sadiq), 3 (3) a portion
from (maqra if) the Umm al-kitab (Archetypal Book) or within the mushaf ("Book" = Q.?), (4)
one among the 99 Names of God, (5) Ya ljayy Ya Qayyam (0 Living One! 0 Self-Subsisting),
(6) in certain verses of specific quranic sarahs, al-Badara(= The Cow, Q. 2), Al 7mran(= The
Family of s lmran, Q. 3) and Ta-Ha' (= Q. 20), etc., and (7) in a prayer recited by Joshua son of
Nan, (8) (Muhaj: 378ff; Misbah: 408ff where, 60+ possibilities are listed).

Note that in his K. Aqdas BA* at one point states, "Say: This is that hidden knowledge which
shall never change, since its beginning is with nine p abjad Bahal. the symbol that betokeneth the
concealed and the manifest, the inviolable and unapproachable Name.." (1 29, 28 cf. note p.188).

Probably pre-9th century CE Christian uses of the word band'occur in Arabic recensions of an
originally Syriac work, The Book of the Cave of Treasures (Medrath Gazzé, original Syriac c. 4th cent.
CE? ) in the Kitab al-majial( "Book of the Rolls". This work includes an account of the story of Adam and
Eve in which reference is made to the First Man's pre-fall (baha' al-azfm, his "mighty glory" or "great
beauty" (Bezold, Schatzohle,. 2:14) as well as his al-band' al-'ajib (wondrous glory), Gibson, Rolls,.6).
According to the "Book of the Rolls" the first couple were both clothed in glory and bahaT "splendour"
(Gibson, Rolls, 7).

The letter "1" (lam) within the Allah of the basmala is, among other things, said to be the ism al-
> a'zam (the Mightiest Name) and a ramz ("cipher") which is the first thing which God chose for himself
(Ii-nafsihi) (T. Basmala, 6014C:341).

It is worth noting that certain early ShaykhT writings were understood by BA* and AB* to
anticipate the word baha'being the Mightiest Name. These opening words of Sayyid Kazim's
commentary upon al-Qasicla al-lamlyya of 'Abd Afandi al-Musili (d.1278/1861), are
perhaps the best example,

> Praise be to God Who hath ornamented the brocade of existence with the
> mystery of differentiation (sirr al-baynCinat) by virtue of the ornament of the
> emergent Point (tiraz al-nuqtat al-bariz) from whence cometh the letter "H" (al-
> ha') through the letter "A" (bll-alif), without filling up (ishba) or segregation
> (inshiqaq)' (Sh. QasIda,1)
This passage is referred to by BA* in a Tablet to Mull& Bajistani (Ma'idih 7:139) and by
*Abdu'l-Baha" in his Commentary on the Basmala (Maka'tib 1:33ff). In somewhat cryptic fashion
Sayyid Kazim mentions the "Point" (- ) interpreted as alluding to the hidden letter "B" (cf. its dot
u)    and related to the letters "H" ( ah) and "A" ( 1) which combine to spell baha'. Also worth
noting here is Sayyid Kazim's comments on diya'(splendour) in his Commentary on the Sermon
of the Gulf (<--2.2). It is associated with baba' as "the light of lights" explained by Jesus as
the first letter of the basmala (u ) signifying bah'-Allah, the "Splendour of God" which Sayyid
Kazim also relates to the Dila al-sahar (<-- Sh.TTNJ: 20). In his Sh. Qasfda Sayyid Käzim, also
comments on the 'Light Verse' (24:35) explaining that this "Light" is synonymous with the al-
cliya i   (radiance) and akbaha'(splendour) adding that "the baha' ... is the "Primordial Light"
and the "Mightiest, Greatest Name" (al-ism al-a'zam al-a'zam) through which God created the
"heavens and the earth" and whatsoever is therein. ShaykhT theology at times anticipated
aspects of the centrality given in BabT-Baha'T theology to the word baha' as a luminous
phenomenon and a very creative, dynamically powerful Word..

Details cannot be registered here about the complexities of the Bob's uses of baha' or
the wide-ranging theological senses that BA* gave this word. Both before and after his religious
mission the Bab was especially given to the devotional life. This devotional preoccupation led
him to cherish and meditate much upon the two ShVT supplications Sahar and Mubahala

as a personal name.

Following the BabT conference of Badasht (June 1848), BA* defined himself through the
> word baha'(<--). He thereby opened the possibility of his being identified as the ism Allah al-
> a'gam alluded to in some Shri- ShaykhT texts such as the Du'a Sahar-Mubahila devotions so
central to the Bab's devotional and high theological writing. From the early 1850s BA* used
the word baba' as a proper name (BA*, Rashh, 184-6; K-Ta s am, 265). In due course the laqab

(honorific title) of MTrza ljusayn 'All NOrT became Baha'-Allah (ABayinat:. Following the ahl al-
baba' , "people of bah" terminology of the Bab for the saved elect within the mysterious
safinat al-hamra t ( "Crimson Ark", QA 57:226, etc), BA* referred to his followers in this way (L-
Shaykh, )(XX/ ESW:139). In later years he occasionally called his devotees al-baha tiyyrin (=
Baha'Ts, (lit.) 'those imbued with baba' as the divine splendour; L. Itlikma 2:267, No. 130). This
designation became central within the developed Baha'T religion.

There are thousands of occurrences of the word baha t in Bahâl sacred scripture, many
theologically weighty statements about the ism Allah al-a‘gam. BA* has stated that all the Divine
Names in both seen and the unseen spheres are dependent upon the baha' as the Mightiest
Name of God (Ma'idih 8:24). The use of the baha' as the Mightiest Name is, in a sense, the
alpha and the omega of Bata( existence. It is nine times repeated in the daily Bahal salat, the

"Long Obligatory Prayer" and can be recited at meal times (L..Tibb). It has a healing and
protective potency, and is recited six times during BA's communal Prayer for the Dead (P&M
No.167). Too sacred to be used on gravestones, this and other calligraphic representations of

the Baha'T Greatest Name are hung in Bahl homes or engraved on personal ring stones worn
on the little finger of the right hand. In his Most Holy Book (KAqdas) BA* made the repetition
of the "Greatest Name" ninety five times (95 = 5 X 19) each day a regenerating religious activity
(Aqdas 1126; cf. SE* in LG:905). It is hardly surprising that the last individual head of the Baha'T
religion, SE* (d.1957) wrote, "The Greatest Name [as Bah', etc] is a distinctive mark of the
[Baha'T] Cause and a symbol of our Faith" (LG:895).

Finally, a few notes about the Bahl theology of the ism Allah al-a'gam relative to the
HB and NT. The word baba' seems to have no precise equivalent or cognate in Biblical Hebrew
although it is represented theologically by the Hebrew tIZ: (kabeid = 'radiant glory) and its

occurrence as 711T1'
T  :

11:: ("Glory of the Lord") as well, theophanologically by BA's application
of the tetragrammaton to himself (<--). BA* claimed to be the eschatological theophany of the
tetragrammation. One such statement addressed to the Baha'T poet 'AndalTb ("Nightingale)
reads, "He [= BA*] it is who in the tawrat (Torah) hath been named Y-H-W-H (loosely Yahweh)
(BA* AQA2:28 ; see Lambden 1988:157-8). For BA* the Exodus account of the revelation of the
divine Name (Ex.3:13-14;6:2) incorporating the phrase r17,7R; 17.*         (<-2.1), has a mystical
significance as an allusion to his pre-existent reality, the ism Allah al-a'gam which
communicated with Moses on the mystic Sinai (Ma'idih 4:38-41; Lambden 1986:33ff; 1988
esp. 155-8).

At one point in certain Arabic NT translations, most notably the London 1858 (= 1671)
William Watts printed Arabic Bible for the Eastern Churches, the genitive phrase baha'-Allah
translates 156cc Toil -0E00 (AV "the glory of God") in Revelation 21:23 where John of Patmos
predicts,

> And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the
> glory of God ( Gk. EtC01 Tot) 0Eot) = bah' Allah) did lighten it, and the Lamb is
> the light thereof (AV tr).
In a very large number of allah BA* applies to himself NT references to Christ's parousia

in radiant "glory" (Gk. doxa <-- Mk. 8:38,13:26; Matt.16:27; Lk. 9:26b). As the eschatological
"Father" he claimed to be the return of Christ the "Son", initially, it seems, from Edirne (Ottoman
Turkey) in the early-mid. 1860s (L. Ibn; S.Mul0k, etc) almost exactly 200 years after Sabbetai
Tzevi (1626-1676) made his messianic claims known (1665-6) in this location. In Arabic NTs the
masculine adjective majTd (= "glorious") or majd ("glory", cf. Q. 11:73; 85:15) not baha' most
frequently translate doxa "glory". Many of BA*s post-1863 references to his theophany thus
use majd I majTd alluding to the synoptic predictions of a parousia in "glory". 1 In addressing
various 'kings and rulers' in major allah of the late Edirne, early Galilean (= s AkkalAcre) period
(1867-1862) this claim is frequently voiced as in the following brief extracts from epistles
addressed to the "Christian west", to Napoleon III (d.1873), Queen Victoria (d.1901) and Pope
Pius IX (d.1878):

> Wert thou to incline thine inner ear unto all created things, thou wouldst hear:
> 'The Ancient of Days (al-qadTm)is come in His great glory (dhu il-majd al-agfm)
> (BA* to Napoleon III AQAK 99)

> He, in truth, hath come unto the world in his most great glory (b/-majdihi al-
> a'gam)( BA* L. Vikturiya, AQAK:131 tr.PDC:35).
> Blessed be the Lord (al-rabb) who is the Father (al-ab)! He verily, hath come
> among the nations in His most great glory (bi-majdihi al-a'gam, L. Pap. AQAK:/
> tr.TB:79).

From the above paragraphs it should be clear that the Arabic word baha' was identified
by BA* from the 1860s as the locus or quintessence of the ism Allah al-a'gam. This latter
Isralliyyat motif has clear Judaic-Islamic roots. It has its secondary roots in the deep Shaykhi-
Babi theophanological gnosis. BA*, personalized the baba' motif during his early Babi years
later claiming to be a pre-existent incarnation of that baha' which is the ism Allah al-a‘gam.
intimated to Moses on the mystic, timeless Sinai. This, it would seem, was by virtue of the Bab's
use of baha' phrases and derivatives in Shn-ShaykhT inspired Du'a sahar / mubahila

1 1n his the Jawahfral-asrär (-->) BA* cites Matt. 24:29-31a (in Arabic, AQA 3:10) as he does in
his K.ician (KI:19f /tr.16f; -->) though the parousia in "glory" is here associated with Muhammad.

generated devotional meditations and prophecies (cf. Qismati, 38)..
• 8. 2 Bah'-Allah and the emergence of the Bahn interpretation of the Bible

Very little is known about BA's pre-Bab' years (1817-1844). Before becoming a Babi at
the age of twenty-seven he spent most of his time in Mazandaran (Nur, Takar, etc) or in around
Tehran the then capital city. Though Jews, Christians, missionaries, foreign diplomats and
Europeans all resided in Tehran, Arabic and Persian Bibles had only been sporadically
distributed there from early in the 19th century. Before 1844 there is no record of BA's having
had intimate links with any of these aforementioned groups. Though opportunity existed within
the Tehrani milieu for him (prior to 1852) to have communicated with Europeans or acquired
some knowledge of the Bible and matters Judaeo-Christian, there are no primary or secondary
sources which suggest that this was the case.'

Extant primary and secondary sources suggest that BA*'s knowledge of the Bible has
its   roots in the late Iraq period of his life. No canonical Bible quotations appear to exist prior to
1861 when the Jawahir al-asrar (Essence of Mysteries) was written (-->). None of his pre-Iraq
writings have anything to say about his Jewish or Christian associations or the Bible aside from
a few Islamicate citations (-->). It was in Baghdad in the 1850s and early 1860s that BA*, unlike
his reclusive half-brother Mirza Yahya, socialized quite openly (sometimes in coffee houses)
in order to promote Babism. In his Surat al-ziyara (Surah of the Visitation) written for the wife
of    Mulla ITI usayn, BA* mentions his expulsion from Iran and his being amongst Babis and "those
who disbelieved [in Babism] of the [religious] communities (min '771/Lai al-qabIT) (Ma'idih 8:84).
This is slightly expanded upon by AB* who, in the early 1900s, explicitly stated that Babi
gatherings in Baghdad attended by BA* often incorporated learned Jewish and Christian
religionists:

1 0f minor interest in this connection is the fact that BA's father's was friendly with MTrzA 'Abu'l
Qasim FarahanT, 0a'im Maqam (<-5.4 ) who was among those who responded to the Christian missionary
polemic of Henry Martyn. It is not known whether BA* or his father were familiar with these exchanges.

> It often happened in Baghdad that certain Islamic, Jewish and Christian divines
> ('ulamS) as well as well-informed Europeans (arbab-/ ma'arif-/ urOpg) were
> congregated for a blessed [BMA gathering (majlis-I mubaraka)... (SAQ VII: 22)

It was doubtless BA's attending such ecumenical BabT gatherings that led to his close
dialogue with Jews and Christians with whom he very likely discussed biblical issues. In this he
would have argued the truth of Muhammad and Islam as well as Babism and thus would have
made use of various Arabic (and possibly Persian) Bible translations. This perhaps to some
degree accounts for his citing a Christian Arabic translation of the Bible within his Jawahir al-
asrar(1861) and K .1-qan (1862).

An intimate association of BA* and Christians is also suggested by other things.

Probably relevant to this is the fact that important Christian portrait(s) of BA* shown to Baha'T
pilgrims at the Baha'T World Centre (Haifa, Israel) date from the Iraq period (pre-1863). Some
have distinctly Christian ("Roman Catholic"?) cherubic iconographic features strongly
suggesting an intimate association between BA* and Christians. Among the persons known or
who might have come into contact with BA* at this time were the Jew Abd-Allah ben Abraham
Somekh (d.1889), the (British consul) Arnold Burrowes Kemball (d.1908) and the "freethinker"
Mirza Malkum Khan (d.1908).

Prior to the early 1860s the only quasi-bible, Islamo-biblical citations known to the
present writer are found within certain of BA's alchemical alwah. They do not derive from
Christian Arabic Bible translations are Islamo-biblical citations most likely cited from Islamic
"alchemical" works. This pursuit of alchemy was widely indulged in the early Qajar years. Arabic,
often pseudo-biblical citations or discourses within such works, often have an only vague
relationship with the canonical Bible. Such biblical materials occasionally surface, for example,
in works attributed to the enigmatic JabTr b. 171 ayyan (fl. 2nd-3rd/mid. 8th cent CE?), an
alchemical initiate and alleged disciple of the sixth Shn Imam Ja'far Sadiq (d. 147/765 <-- 2.1)
Both JabTr and Ja sfar are reckoned alchemical initiates in Still and other sources (Ruska, 1924;

Haq,1994). 1 Sometimes cryptic lsrailiyyat traditions and motifs inform Islamic alchemical writings
including items within the Jabirean corpus and writings attributed to the founding mother of
Greek alchemy Mary the Jewess ( prophetess or Copt; f1.1st cent. CE?). 2 Well-known to BA*,
for example, Jabir's Kitab al-mawazin al-saghir (Lesser Book of the Balances) makes
reference to a (lost?) book of Jabir in which he expounds pre-Islamic scripture including the
Hebrew Torah. Therein Jabir writes, "[therein] do I expound, through the gnosis of the divine
Assister (ma'alat al-mu sTn), the Tawrat, the Infil, the ZabOr and the MazamTr" (= Psalter)
(Berthelot, [III] 1893:115-6 [Arabic] cf.148).3

It is in an alchemical Tablet to a certain MTrza 'Abbas, for example, that BA* cites
alchemical Isra'Tliyyat and biblical passages. They include a cryptic alchemical pronouncement
of Abraham about the nature of the cosmos (aValam) as an Egg (al-baycla) and its constituents
as well as an enigmatic statement of Jesus about ka'in ("Being") in association with the kalam
Allah (Word of God) (cf. Jn.1:1-2?). In this context Jesus utters the command "He that hath no
sword, let him buy a sword!" (cf. Luke 22:35-8). The Sitzim Leben presupposed here for Jesus'
alchemical gnosis, is obviously a far cry from anything that might emerge from the redaction
criticism of the Lukan pericope (INBA 36:277-80).
• Biblical citations and the question of tahrif ("falsification").

Just over ten years after the death of the Bab (1850) , BA* wrote his important Arabic
Jawahir al-asrar(1860) and Kitab-I Tqan (c.1862) both of which modify the Islamic doctrine of

/ According to MazandarAni BA's family had an interest in exoteric and esoteric alchemy. He
refers to BA's brother Mirza MOs a and father MirzA Buzurg as experienced alchemists (Athar 1:172-3
[Iksir] 5:53 [kimiya]). They were allegedly in possession of gold and silver alchemical tools and
instruments which BA*fiad concealed in Tehran. During the two year period of his Sufi guise in Iraqi
Kurdistan (1856-1856), BA* was deemed "an adept in alchemy and the science of divination" ( SE* GPB:
2      , .

lsra illyyat informed traditions about alchemical processes were commented upon by BA*
including a cryptic utterance of the Mary the Jewess (fl. 1st cent. CE?) Including the saying, 'Wake from
the "branch" of the [philosopher's] Stone not from the "root" of the Stone' (Ma'ida 1:26f) as well as a
saying relating to the samghat al-bayda ("White Gum"= Silver ) and the samghat al-hamra'("Red Gum"
= Gold). A massive bibliography surrounds this subject.

Alchemical subjects were also an important element in Shaykhi esotericism. Shaykh Abmad,
Sayyid Kazim and Karim Khan Kirmani were learned in this area.

biblical tahrhe ("falsification") and contain biblical citations. The Biblical citations are from the NT
with one exception in the form of a Persian paraphrastic version of Isaiah 65:25 introduced as
a hadlth- I mashor ("well-known tradition"; KI 73/75) existing in many Islamicate versions (-->).
It can thus be said at the outset that BA* did not cite the HB until the post-Iraq period of his life.
No fully fledged citations from the Torah/ HB are found in any of the currently available Persian
or Arabic writings of the Bab or BA* until the post-Iraq period of BA's life.
The Bible and biblical tahrit in the Jawähir al-asrär.

The Jawahir al-asrar (The Essence of the Mysteries) according to the evidence of one
of its manuscripts dates to the (Bat) year bahlyy = abjad 17 or 1277/1860-61 (INBMC 46:40).
It certainly pre-dates the Kl-qan which is partly based upon it and seems to refer to it (KI13/17,
cf. Ganj:28). The Jawahir is an important Arabic work of BA* written in response to questions
posed (or communicated to him?) by Sayyid YOsuf-I Sidihi (Isfahani), a one time resident of
Karbala, Shi s T mujtahid and pupil of the Marja al-Taqlid, Shaykh Murtada al-AnsarT (1759-1864).
His questions, apparently posed before he had met BA* (AQA 3:20), related to the advent of
the Mandi and when the BabIs might expect the theophany of BabT messiah. The Jawahir has
a good deal in common with both the (Persian) mystical Haft Vadi(Seven Valleys, c. 1858?) and
the K.kban of BA*

The first third or so of the Jawahir (AQA III:4-31) consists of an exposition of the reason
for the rejection of past messengers of God and the need to understand biblical and qur'anic
eschatological prophecies non-literally. After bemoaning the fact that Jews and Christians failed
to "comprehend the melody of the utterance" (la/in al-qawl)through a wrong (hermeneutical)
approach to biblical scripture, BA* says that this was the reason for their rejection of the amr
Allah ("Cause of God") meaning the message of Jesus and Muhammad (AQA3:6-9). BA* next
sets down something of what God has mentioned in the previous scriptures (kutub al-qabl) to

the end that his reader might incline towards Babism. He cites, in Arabic, a series (in canonical
order) of NT passages taken from the synoptic versions of Jesus' eschatological discourse (Matt
24:Iff;Mk.13:1ff; Lk. 21:5ff) and citations extracted from the Johannine 'Farewell Discourse'

(Jn.14:Iff). Introducing these texts with a citation from Matthew BA* first writes:

> This is the form (sOrat) of what was revealed afore time [contained] in the Gospel
> of Matthew (injTI al-matta), in the first Book (if sifr al-awwal, of the Gospels) in
> which he [Jesus] makes mention of the signs of the theophany (zuhar) which
> [who] shall come after him [after Jesus = Muhammad] (Jawahir: 9/ 46:3).

An accurate citation of Matt 24:19 (AQA 3:9) follows which is textually identical with that
printed in the Christian Arabic NT text of the 1657 London Polyglot of Brian Walton (= L.Poly.),
the Rome Vulgate compared 1671 (Eastern Churches) version of Sergius Risius (= SarkTs al-
Ruzzi; R. Watts reprint, 1850) as well as the 1811 Arabic Newcastle Bible (Carlyle) and the (later)
Van Dyck (1860s) independent (Protestant) translation:

> Woe unto them that are with child [pregnant] and to them that give suck in those
> days (Matt. 24:19, AV/KJV).

This text is immediately followed by a highly elevated reference to Jesus to whom the
synoptic words are directly attributed in introducing the citation of Matt. 24:24:29-31a. The
Arabic text here is identical to that cited in the later K.Ion l It has several variations from the
Arabic Christian versions referred to above and the textus receptus reflected in modern critical
editions. This text reads as follows using the AV translation with textual variants notes in capital
letters,

> [But Immediately] after the oppression of those days shall the sun shall be
> darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
> heaven, and the powers of the EARTH (quwwat al-ard) shall be shaken [=

> 24:30]. And he shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet [=
> 24:31a] (AV) (Ar. AQA 3:10/46:4).

> Exactly the same version (as that printed in AQA III:10) of Matt 24:29-31a is quoted,
paraphrased and commented on at some length in BA*s Kiqan(-->). SE's translation of this text is not
wholly literal but is assimilated to the AV., glossing over the minor variants and not translating BA"s
Persian paraphrases of the Arabic NT texts. The Arabic plural 'alamilt ("signs") for example, is in
conformity with the textus receptus and modern translations (+ INBAMC 46 & AQA III) translated as a
singular ("sign"). He also has "in the clouds" not "on the clouds" (Cf. KI tr. 16).

singular.
These three variations in the Jawahir are also, for the most part presupposed in the
identical text cited in the K.iqan as well as in the (untranslated) Persian paraphrase of BA* in
this later work (-->). The agreement of point [c] with the L.Pol. might suggest that the probably
reprinted Christian text cited by BA* was more in agreement with this 1657 London Polyglot. No
categorical statement could be made without a full consultation of reliable mss. When at [a] BA*
has ( Ar.) quwwat al-ard ( "powers of the earth") and not "powers of the heavens" it is likely
that this phrase here is a lapse though it is sufficiently minor that BA's main arguments are not
disrupted.

Many great Islamic scholars and thinkers occasionally cited sacred texts "wrongly" or
with minor errors and variants. BA* apparently did this and no less a figure than al-Ghazali
(d.505/1111). The latter, for example, is known to miss quoted some of his Q. citations and
hadithcitations (Lazarus-Yafeh, 1975:217 fn.). The relatively minor textual idiosyncrasies here
do not alter the fact that BA*'s main point is the veracity of the biblical text as opposed to the
negative implications of Islamic Writ: Later BA* actually states that he is paraphrasing or
making inadequate citations because of lack of space and the need to move forward.

The other texts cited in the Jawahiral-asrar include Mk. 13:19 which BA* notes parallels
the text in Matthew's Gospel (Matt. 24: 21; cf. Lk. 21:23). It is an Arabic version in full agreement
with the L. Poly. (AQA 3:10+46:4). BA*'s aim is to draw attention to the distinctly eschatological
materials in each of the four Gospels that he quotes Mark 13:19 even though it roughly
parallels to Matthew 24:21. From "the third book.. the Gospel of Luke" (sifr al-thalith.. WI laqa)
BA* quotes a partial and largely accurate Arabic version of Luke 21:25-7 which has several

minor variants from the Christian Arabic versions . The text BA* cites is again closest to the
London Polyglot.'

In illustration of Jesus' eschatologically oriented utterances recorded in the "fourth
book.. the Gospel of John", BA* cites three clusters of paraclete texts. First he quotes a slightly
variant (Arabic) version of Jn 15:26-27a,

> [But] When al-mu'azzi ("the Comforter") is come, whom I shall send unto you,
> the Spirit of Truth soh al-haqq)which cometh from the Truth (God, al-haqq) he
> shall testify of me. And ye [also] shall bear witness (AQA 3:11 = INBMC 46:4).

Here (Gk.) ircepciKA.Trog (paraklètos = "Paraclete") is translated by the Arabic al-mu'azzi
(lit. "Comforter") as in the L. Polyglot (1657) and a large number of subsequent Arabic
translations including that of Van Dyck (see Lambden, 1997). While the English translation
"comforter" apparently goes back to the English reformer John Wycliffe (d. 1384), the Greek was
from patristic times thought to have an active sense of consoling or comforting (Origen, Cyril of
Jerusalem, Jerome, etc). Most Arabic collections of testimonia to Muhammad cite Islamicate
versions of Johannine Paraclete promises considered as prophecies of Muhammad ( = Ah mad
Q. 61:6).

BA* next cites what appears to be a conflation of Jn 14:26 and 16:5-64 said to be what
Jesus uttered in "another place" (in John's Gospel):

> [But] when the Holy Spirit cometh, the Comforter whom my Lord will send in my
> name, he shall [assuredly] teach you all things and bring to your remembrance
> all that I have said unto you [Jn 14:26]. But now I am going unto him that sent
> me; and not one among you asketh me where I am going [Jn.16:5 ]. But because
> I have said these things unto you [Jn 16:6aa] (AQA. 3:11-12 = 46:4).2

It is curious in this unexpected juxtaposition of verses that Jn 16:16a breaks off and the
words "sorrow hath filled your hearts" (16:16b) is omitted. Finally, BA* quotes a juxtaposed

'This text is essentially the Lukan redaction of Mk.13:24-26 (// Matt 24:29-30 cited by BA* as
above) with verse + 31 (there sis no exact parallel in Mk. or Matt..

Here instead of "the Father" the text of Jn 14:26 quoted by Bahâ'u'll6h has "my Lord" (Ar.

aba being read as the "r" ra' of rabba (?).

(Arabic) version of Jn 16:7 and 16:13:

[Nevertheless] I tell you the truth; it is best for you that I go away; for if I do not

> will guide you unto all the truth: for he will not cry out of himself but shall speak
> out whatsoever he shall hear; and he will declare unto you the things that are to
> come [Jn 16:13] (AQA 3:12 = 46:4-5).

In selecting (and conflating) key texts from John's Gospel indicative of future events, BA*
makes the advent of the Comforter (al-mu'azzi) the centre of attention. This figure is mentioned
in each of the three Johannine passages quoted. Having quoted an Arabic version of Matt.
24:19, 29-31a; Mk 13:19; Lk 21:25-27+31 and Jn 15:26-27a, 14:26+16:5-6a, 16:7+13, BA*
characterises these texts as "the substance (sarat)of what was sent down [to Jesus] afore time"
(AQA 3:2). He swears by God that he had felt compelled to abbreviate, condense them, hence
it would seen, the unusual conflations or juxtapositions.

> BA* also underlines his ability to quote at length from past scriptures:
> If I desire to make mention of the words of the prophets (kalimat al-anb)'a)
> which were sent down from the jabarCit of the Divine Grandeur and the Kingdom
> of the Divine Sovereignty (malakat al-sultanat) the pages (al-awaraq) and the
> tablets (al-alwah) would assuredly be filled up before matters be concluded
> (AQA:12).

Sayyid Muhammad is assured that "all the scriptures (al-zuburat), psalms (al-mazamTr) and
scrolls (a/-sahah7 contain messianic texts similar to the NT passages quoted (AQA 3:13).
Where they to be quoted at length this might be counter productive for the Sayyid. The subject
of the manner of interpreting NT texts is next discussed. Muslims must not be literalist in their
exegesis

> If they [Muslims] say that these words [NT texts cited] are from God and have
> no ta'wil ("allegorical meaning") but should be [understood] according to the
> outer mode of expression (zahir al-qawl) in the most literalistic manner (ft zahir
> al-zahir) then how can they object to the [existence of] the unbelievers of the
"People of the Book" (ahl al-kitab)?

As literalists Muslims cannot complain about Jews and Christians rejecting Islam when they
need to be led to understand prophetic scriptures non-literally:
They neither believed in them nor obeyed them inasmuch as they did not

> witness the darkening of the sun and the falling of the stars from heaven upon
> the face of the earth or the descent of the angels in their outward form upon the
> earth. Therefore did they reject the Prophets and the messengers. Nay, rather,
> they considered them opponents of their religion and their laws. They levelled

Muslims accepting the veracity of the NT predictions are compelled to recognise their
allegorical level of interpretation. Otherwise non-believing Christian literalists have a valid
position regarding non-fulfilment. NT texts must be interpreted allegorically (AQA 111:15).

In quoting and discussing NT texts BA's primary aim is to enable Muslims to interpret
qur'anic eschatological prophecies non-literally. In so doing they should be able to recognise the
truth of Babism. They should not repeat the error of literalists among the "people of the Book".
This argument presupposes the existence and authenticity of the NT commonly believed by
Muslims to be have been largely if not wholly fabricated or textually corrupted (<--). It is thus
argued that Christian scripture really exists:

If they [Muslims] should assert that these [ NT] books (al-asfar= the Gospels) in
the possession of this community (= the Christians) and which they have named

al-WI and attribute to Jesus son of Mary were not revealed by God and
> [through] the manifestation of His Self [= Jesus] this would necessitate [Muslims
> asserting] the cutting off of [divine] grace on the part of the Source of Graces
> [God] and the non-realization of the Proof on the part of God with respect to His
> servants... If, when Jesus ascended unto heaven, his Book also went up with him
> then by what means would God be able to present them with scriptural proof on
> the Day of Resurrection or punish them [the Christians] for their unbelief in
> accordance with what is written down from the Imams of the [Islamic] religion and
> established by the rightly guided 'ulama' (AQA 3:16).

In the next few paragraphs BA* informs Sayyid Muhammad that the true meaning of the
texts quoted should be sought from exalted Beings and not from those who do not know their
"right hand side from their left" and who cannot penetrate such secrets. He mentions a celestial
"City of Knowledge" (mao'inat al-71m) where all knowledge and all secrets are treasured. Therein
are the "essences [gems] of the mysteries" (jawahir,
al-asrar , cf. the title of this work) and the
secrets of scriptural texts. Outside of entering this celestial source of inspiration which appears
to take on features of the New Jerusalm of the Apocalypse (Rev. 21), which is the source of NT
exegesis, the predictions cannot be fathomed (AQA 3:16-20).

> Nay, by He in Whose hand is my soul! It is impossible that anyone should quaff
> even a dewdrop [of the mysteries of these verses] save he who hath entered
> beneath the shade of this City, the pillars of which were established upon
> mountains of red ruby, its walls of the chrysolite of the Divine Unicity (zabarjad
> al-ahadiya), its gates of the diamond of the Divine Perpetuity la lmis al-
> ahmadfyya)and its earth the perfume of nobility (rah al-mukarram)(AQA3: 20).

After confessing that he has digressed somewhat, BA* calls Siyyid Muhammad's
> attention back to Gospel texts. He quotes an accurate though slightly idiosyncratic Arabic
> version of Matt. 24:35 (// Mk.13:31; Lk 21:33) as that which is written in "all the Books of the
> Gospel" which Jesus, "the Spirit" (al-rah) uttered "through the light" (b11-nar) when he
> communicated with his disciples (talamid). Taken literally this verse would inhibit Christian faith
> in Islam. Muslims must thus recognise the ta*wil non-literal senses of eschatological
> prophecies. The Bab came but was rejected because Muslims failed to interpret the scriptures
befittingly.

Having made these points the issue of tahrff ("biblical falsification") is now directly
raised

Be not veiled on account of all that which was sent down in the Qur'an and that
> which you [Siyyid Muhammad] have heard of the traces of the suns of infallibility
> and full moons of the divine Grandeur [= statements of the Imams] concerning
> the "corruption of those who exceed the proper bounds [extremists]" (tahrif al-
> ghalin) and the alterations of those who falsify scripture" (tabdil al-mutaharrift
> cf. Q. 4:58; 5:16, etc) for they did not intend such expressions to apply save in
> the case of certain specific, declared instances (al-mawarid al-makh,sasat
> al-ma/7,90,5N) (AQA 3:27).

BA* here argues that as indicated by the [twelver Imams] biblical tahrif was limited to
a few specific instances. This same subject is discussed in more detail by BA* in a parallel
section of his K. fign which will be discussed below.

The latter two thirds of the Jawahir is in large measure an exposition of the seven mystic
stages to spiritual realization. At various points BA* cites NT texts including Jn 3:5b-T (Arabic
text fully agreeing with the Londo n Polyglot) in his exposition of Islamic eschatological
predictions that should be spiritually interpreted. A conflated Arabic text of the first few verses
of the Apocalypse (of John of Patmos = Rev) is cited their author being referred to as "one of

the prophets (anbiyar Apparently presupposing that Rev 1:13ff is a prophetic description of
the exalted being of Muhammad, BA* quotes a conflated Arabic version of certain phrases
occurring in Rev 1:14-16:

> His eyes were as a flame of fire [1:14b] and his feet were like
> unto...brass...[1:15aa]... And out of his mouth went a [sharp] two-edged sword
> [164... (AQA 3:59).

Illustrative of the abstruse language of scripture these allegedly prophetic words, BA*
holds, cannot possibly be taken literally. If the parousia of the one depicted in Rev. 1:14-16
should appear he would not be human. Intimacy with him would be impossible. Christians who
expect a man to appear in such a form will never come to true faith. Great wisdom nonetheless,
BA* states, is enshrined in Rev I:14f. BA* gives a detailed non-literal interpretation to phrases
within these verses which cannot be fully registered here (AQA 3:62ff). Neither is it possible to
adequately discuss the implications of all the NT texts cited in the Kfign, many of which are
also included in BA's this Persian rewrite of his Jawahfr.

al-asrar.
III The Bible and biblical tahnf in the Kitab-T RIM

Like the Jawahir al-asrar,, the K.igan (Book of Certitude) was written as a response
to questions posed by an uncle of the Bob, Hajji Mirza Sayyid Muhammad mostly revolving
around problems of the seeming non-fulfillment of Shn eschatological predictions. Originally
known as the Risala-i Khal-i Akbar (Treatise for the Greatest Uncle), this elegant Persian
istidlaliyya (Demonstrative treatise) was later named the Kician or "Book of Certitude" (=
KI.,1278 AH=1861 CE). It is the chief cornerstone of middle Bäbi and emergent Bahal theology.
And dates to about a year after the Jawahir,

al-asrar , namely, 1278/1862 ( cf. Buck, 1995).

Within his Kitab-/ lqanBA* devotes considerable space to the spiritual interpretation of Matthew
24:29-31a (KI:19ff 116ff) cited in Arabic exactly as it is in the Jawählral-asrar (<---). These NT
verses are again interpreted in terms of Muhammad being the return of Christ. Expounded non-
literally, the eschatological signs of the synoptic gospels accompanied his parousia of the
Arabian prophet. Literalist Christian divines unable to convert to Islam were deprived of the

Imam' ShT'T hadith (= "the utterances of the Ahmadi mirrors");

> For us in every discrepancy there is abandonment for they [the Imams] interdict
> from our [ShrT] religion the tahrit al-ghalTn ("corruption of the exaggerators"),
> the selectivity of the false ones (intlhal al-mubtilTn) and the eisegesis of the
> ignorant (ta iwT1 al-jahign)" I
The Jawahir parallel to the K.Tqan passage translated above is an expansion which clearly
acknowledges its indebtedness to Shi s T traditions that speak of tahril ("corruption") or taba
("alteration") in connection with biblical (and qur lanic?) revelation. The implication of these latter
paragraphs is that the existing text of the Bible is essentially a largely uncorrupted divinely
revealed Book. This became the standard Baha'T viewpoint though it does not signify that the
whole Bible constitutes wahy (divine revelation).

In illustration of his understanding of the limited applicability or context of qur'anic verses
mentioning tahal (not being indicative of whole scale biblical tahrif ), BA* (like certain Muslim
exegetes) relates the context of the queanic references to tana by narrating the well-known
story of the dialogue between Muhammad and the Jewish Rabbi 'Abd Allah Ibn-I ?Gaya as the
occasion for the revelation of Q. 4:45 (or 5:45). 2 This cannot be fully discussed here though it
can be noted that the story of I bn SO riya and the question of stoning as punishment for adultery
is much discussed in tafsTr and related sources. 3 Such, BA explains, were the circumstances
that precipitated Gabriel's revealing, to Muhammad, the words "They [the Jews] pervert

/ This "saying of the Imam" is cited by the ShaykhT Muhammad Khan-i KirmanT in his ljusam al-
din, 12 though it is not precisely sourced. Taking this context into account the reading ghalin
("exaggerators") makes far better sense than 'aliyyin ("exalted beings") inasmuch as one would not
expect "exalted Beings" (assuming 'a/in does not have the sense "haughty ones") to engage in the tain-if
("corruption") of holy books. See also MajlisT, Bihar 2:92, 151, 4:353; 23:30,95; 25:274, 363; 27:222,
32:352; 35:326;36:256; 37:27; 70:102 and 102:78.

See Ibn [shag, &rat tr. Guillaume, 266ff; Burton, 1977: 68ff; Ishraq KhavarT, QI 1:22-3, 613-8. Q.

3:92 reads, "Say:Bring the Torah and read it if ye are truthful", a verse said to have been addressed to
Jews who submitted a man and a woman for examination who had committed adultery (BukharT, Sahli),
I11:92). The version set forth by BA* is a conflation and expansion of several early accounts. I

The Pentateuch does in fact contain the stoning penalty for adultery (Lev. 20:10 Deut. 22:22, etc).

It is not clear whether or to what extent the death by stoning for adultery was carried out by Jews during
the biblical period. In post-biblical times adulteresses were variously stoned, strangled, burned, imprisoned
etc most commonly, publicly flogged (Tigay and Cohn 'Adultery' EJ 2:314).

(yuharrifrina) the text of the Word of God" (= Q.4:45, or 5:45). 1 They indicate a specific
occasion of taly-Tf which does not support a notion of the whole scale textual tahrTfof the Bible.

BA* underlines his rejection of textual tahrTf by pointing out that neither Jewish nor
Christian divines have removed from the Bible (kitab) verses predicting the advent of
Muhammad. Muslims who hold this view are seriously in error because devout Jews and
Christians would not universally excise scripture from their sacred texts (KI 55/67). This
argument in favour of the fundamental authenticity of biblical revelation is found in many Muslim
liberal sources. For BA* tahrif really indicates the erroneous exegesis of scripture. Jews at the
time of the Prophet Muhammad indulged in tahrif in that they interpreted scripture after their
own fancies. Muhammad thus accused them of tahrTf. Q. 2:75ff. has to do with the tahrTf-I
ma'anT, the "falsification of the meaning" of the sacred word in corrupt Jewish anti-Islamic
polemic (KI: 55-56/67-69).

Summing up his view of biblical revelation in the light of his previously outlined exegesis
of Gospel texts (Matt 24:29ff), BA* acknowledges that various modes of textual taly-Tf had
occurred but places the emphasis upon the unfortunate tahrTf-I ma'anT ("the falsification of
meaning"). It is ego centred hermeneutical disorientation that constitutes tahrrf not textual
manipulation of corruption (KI:57f / 69f). For BA* the Bible is fundamentally authentic though
widely misinterpreted or misinterpreted. The Muslim assertion that the genuine text of the Injr1
is non-existent, having "ascended unto heaven", is also countered (KI:57/69). Such an assertion
is grievously in error and is a mockery of the divine providence. When "the sun of the beauty
of Jesus" ascended unto the "fourth heaven" (falak-I chaharum) 2 how, BA* asks, could the

In the Cairo ed. of fhe Kiqän (p.67) Q. 4:45 is partly cited as the words revealed to Muhammad in
connection with the lbn-i SOrTya episode. Q. 5:45 differs only slightly from Q. 4:45 in terms of the words
quoted by BA* Orlin ba'ad). It is Q. 5:45ff that, in Muslim commentaries, is usually explained in the light
of the case of the Jewish adulterers and the stoning penalty issue. The phrase "they pervert (yuharrifina)
the text of the Word of God" in Q. 5:45 is taken by some (al-TabarT, Tafsir VI:137) to indicate the Jewish
concealment or suppression of the stoning penalty for adultery.

Here (KI:86) as elsewhere such as the Law1.74 Aba al-tiasan (BA*Khadim-Allah, dated 27th
Rabi' 1297 AH [= 1879], INBMC 28:[ 447-63], 449) BA* speaks of Jesus as having ascended up into the
"fourth heaven", the "solar" locale from whence he is to return. Cf. Ibn al-'Arabi, Fututist; Ishraq Khavarr,

"holy Book" disappear also? It is inconceivable that divine, scriptural guidance would be cut off
by God during the pre-Islamic period (KI:57/69-70).

Despite prejudices born of exaggerated notions of biblical tahrif, there were a fair
number of Sunni and ShT s T apologists, thinkers and philosophers who cited the Bible with
confidence and apologetic acumen. BA* had a good deal in common in his rejection of biblical
tahrif with, among others, the following Muslim scholars several of whom to some degree
shared a positive attitude towards the Bible: Imam 'All al-Rid' who acknowledged an apostolic
rewriting; the Sh-CT historians al-Yaq0bi and al-Mas s odT, al-Shahrastani and Ibn KhaldOn. It
will be appropriate to also mention here the great Iranian ( possibly Isma'TIT thinker ?) AbO Fath
al-ShahrastanT (d.548/1153), best known for his K al-mi./al wa'-nihal (The Book of Religious and
Philosophical Creeds), today recognized as the first history of religion text in world literature
(Wasserstrom IOS XVII:128).

Aside from al-ShahrastanT's positive view and knowledge of the Bible evident in his K
Milal the little known prologue to his incomplete Persian TafsTr work Mafatih al-asrar wa
mi:sba 1.7 al-abrar (Keys of the mysteries and Lamps of the Pious) contains passages of great
interest. Therein it is stated that despite some Jewish twisting of scriptural word(s) (al-kalam)
out of their context (<--) (yuharrifOna7-kallma 'an mawadihi) (Q. 4:46) there existed a single
recension (naskh) of the tawrat representative of the alwah (Tablets, given to Moses) in the
safekeeping of the Aaronites (awlad harrin). The tawrat did not loose its status as an
honourable expression of "Word of God: (kalam Allah). This is clear from the qur'anic reference
to the tawrat as "a guidance and a light" (Q.5:44a). The Infil (Gospel[s]) are likewise the
"Book of God" (k/tab Allah) although existing in four differing recensions with innumerable

_
differences deriving from the four evangelists. The extant Gospels are thus not wholly the kalam
Allah (Word of God) but contain portions of the true Gospel, just as the Q. is not wholly present
in the commentaries of the Islamic commentators (tafsir al-mufassarin). That there is waly

opened up or bypassed the Muslim doctrine of tahrrf though he did view the Injil as the kalam
Allah (<--4.1ff). BA* addressed the matter straightforwardly. He endorsed the most liberal of
Muslim attitudes towards Judaeo-Christian scripture. BA* confidently quoted the Bible
throughout his life after the writing of the Kkan. This was an example followed assiduously
by his eldest son AB* and many others among his successors and followers. His strong
arguments against biblical tahrif were key factors that led to the oriental and subsequent
occidental Bahal dialogue with Jews and Christians through biblical exegesis.

Certain arguments found in the writings of the Mb and the contacts BA had with Jews
and Christians in Baghdad, doubtless contributed to his positive view of the Bible. Having said
this, however, it should be pointed out that there are writings of BA* (as well of AB* and SE*)
that modify any overstate any doctrine of the authenticity of the Bible argued in the Kitab-I kan.
As BA* was exiled during an almost thirty year period (1863-1893) from Iran to Ottoman Turkey
and Palestine he not only openly rejected hardline Islamic concepts of tahrif but gradually
came to address weighty epistles informed by accurate biblical citations to Jews, Christians,
numerous believing devotees and various western rulers and ecclesiastics.
II Further biblical citations in the K.Nan

In setting forth evidences of the spiritual sovereignty of Muhammad, how he "with one
single verse., sundered light from darkness", BA* draws on his exegesis of Rev 1:164 ("And
out of his mouth went a. .sharp two-edged sword") as detailed in the Jawahir. The revelations
of Muhammad were a divisive revolutionary "sword" though also highly unitative. Hostile and

antagonistic peoples were bound together through the quranic word. This is indicated in a
1'iadith-1 mashür ("well-known tradition"), actually the paraphrased citations rooted in the book
of Isaiah 65:25a (cf Isa.11:6f.) not cited in Arabic like most of his NT., but in Persian.'

> The wolf (gurg) and the lamb (mIsh, '[sheep') shall eat and
> drink from the same place." (KI:73175).     2

BA* regarded the taking of this text literally both foolish and ignorant.' It's literal realization
would disrupt the natural order of things and serve no purpose. This text of Isaiah indicates the
power of the divine word to reconcile and unite opposing and diverse peoples.

BA's understanding of the lsaianic tradition is in line with that of a not inconsiderable
number of Jewish, Christian and Muslim exegetes of Isa 11:6f and 65:25 or traditions rooted
therein. Schimmel in her Mystical Dimensions notes that the theme of the "drinking together
of the wolf and the lamb" from HB prophecies, "occurs as a sign of the ruler's perfect justice in
Ismaili propaganda" and "also forms part of ROmT's imagery, in which it is applied to the mystical
beloved under whose spell the differences between men and animals disappear" (359 + fn. 2)
The "lying together of the lion and the lamb" was also an image of importance in Moghul
paintings of the early seventeenth century (ibid; Schimme1,1978:97-98). In several talks and
writings AB* interpreted lsa 65:25/11:6f figuratively in the light of his father's explanation (SAQ.
XII:58f. cf. 102; PUP:369-70; PT:55, 56 etc.)

In arguing for a non-literal understanding of "life", "death" and "resurrection", BA* has

The Persian version cited is close to Isa. 65:25 though not identical with the textus receptus,
BA* may be paraphrasing the text or quoting an Islamic tradition inspired by lsa 65:25a or, indeed some
other Islamic source in which this well-known prophecy is mentioned. lsa 65:25 and 11:6f were sources
of inspiration to Islamic thinkers and poets including for example, Jalal al-Din Rcirra.

SE* in his translation of the this passage (KI:.73) quotes the AV text ( =RSV also) of Isai 65:25a,
"The wolf and the lamb shall feed together" as if it accurately renders the Persian.

Many modern Christian fundamentalist publications attest the continuing vitality of the hope that Isa
65:25 / 11:6f will find concrete realization in the millennial age.

it that the following Arabic Johannine texts indicate a figurative sense to these matters,'

> It is appropriate for you that you be born again" (Jn 3:7b)
> Whosoever is not born of the water and the spirit, he cannot enter into the
> Kingdom of God since that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is
> born of the spirit is spirit (Jn 3:5b-6, KI:73-6186-90).

For BA* this text indicates that Jesus, in view of his ethereal power and heavenly
sovereignty, called for and had the power to effect a mystic "resurrection". BA* also understands
Matt 8:22b (= Luke 9:60a) to be illustrative of the inner significance of "death". Matt 8:21 (= Luke
9:59) is paraphrased in Persian and verse 22b quoted in Arabic, "Let the dead bury the dead".
(KI 77/91). It is presupposed that these words of Jesus allude to the spiritually "dead" (those
without faith renewed) being left to bury the physically dead. The condition of "death" as the
absence of the true "life" of spirituality is thus indicated. For AB* and subsequent Bahl writers
Matt 8:22b (= Luke 9:60a) was an important proof text indicating the spiritual sense of the
general "resurrection" of the "dead".

Following further detailed arguments designed to underline the inner significance and
cyclic occurrence of mystic "resurrection" and the attendant actualization of the inner states of
"life" and "death" BA* says more about the spiritual "wealth" and "sovereignty" of God's chosen
Messengers (KI 77-84). In illustration of their heavenly "riches" some apocryphal words
attributed to Jesus by Imam Ja'far Sadiq are cited and commented upon:

Thus Jesus, Son of Mary, whilst seated one day and speaking in the strain of the
> Holy Spirit, uttered words such as these:
> '0 People! My food is the grass of the field, wherewith I satisfy my hunger. My
> bed is the dust, my lamp in the night the light of the moon, and my steed my own
> feet. Behold, who on earth is richer than l' (KI 85/101). 2

In the course 'of discussing the essentially spiritual sovereignty of Jesus and the divine

The Arabic text of Jn 3: 5b-6 here is identical with that quoted in the Jawahir though Jn 3:7a is
omitted in the K.ician. The text is again very close to the L. Polyglot. BA*'s Persian paraphrase is also
untranslated by SE*.
2       *

BA gives a partial Persian paraphrase of these words attributed to Jesus- occurring in MajlisT, Bihar
5:358 old edition (see QI 2:1145).

manifestations, BA* draws on a number of NT texts referring to two episodes in the life of Jesus,
(1) the synoptic accounts of his trial before Caiphas, the Jewish High Priest and Pilate the
Roman procurator of Judea (esp. Matt 26:57ff+ parallels, cf. John 18:1ff) and (2) the Lukan
account of Jesus' ability of perform healing miracles illustrated by summing up and commenting
upon story of Jesus' 'Healing of the Man Sick of the Palsy' (Paralytic) at Capemaum (Luke
5:17-26, refashioned cf. Mk.2:1-12, Matt 9:1-8).1

> ... Whether is it easier that I say unto him, 'Take up thy couch', or that I say,'Thy
> sins are forgiven'? that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power (sultanan
> "sovereignty") on earth to forgive sins" 2 (KI 86/103-4)

Explicitly referred to in the Arabic version of Jesus' words to his critics just quoted, is the
"power" or "sovereignty" of the "Son of Man". He has "power (su/tan an) on earth to forgive sins"
Such celestial authority, BA* comments is the sultanat-11.7aqrqqf ("real sovereignty") and the
power (iqtadar) of God's chosen ones" (KI 86/104)

These episodes are quoted as they were thought to underline the ethereal power and
authority of God's messengers. Among other texts, the following Son of Man saying from Jesus
is cited,

> Beholdest thou not the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and might?

(KI 85/102-3). 3

The implication of this interrogative and truncated Arabic version of Jesus' words, is that
he invited his hearers to see and acknowledge him (the Son of Man) now seated at the right
hand of God (cf. the Persian paraphrase, immediately following the Arabic). This is not exactly

Worth noting is the fat that in his Miftah al-Asrär Pfander (<-- ) has this Synoptic narrative indicate
Jesus' divinity and power to heal (tr. Tisdall, 23-5).

See Luke 5:23-24a; Mk 2:9-10a; Matt 9:5-6a with minor divergences. SE* translation of this variant
Arabic paraphrase of Lk. 5:23-24a, is highly paraphrastic and assimilated to the AV of the Markan account
(Mk. 2:9-I0a). Note the reference in the Arabic to Jesus' sultan ' (sovereignty), the subje6t BA* is
discussing (cf. also the Persian paraphrase, not translated by SE* KI:104).

These words seem to be a rewritten and truncated Arabic version of Matt 26:64b1 Mk 14:62b where
BA* finds reference to Jesus' (= the Son of Man's) "sovereignty".

the sense of the synoptic verses on which BA's quotation is based. They have a futuristic or
eschatological import (Matt 26:64 // = Mk 14:62; Lk 22:69. cf. Dan 7:13; Jn 1:51). The past /
present tense of BA's version apparently precludes the inclusion of the rest of the Matthaean/
Markan version(s) of these words, namely, "and coming on /with the clouds of heaven" (Matt
26:64b = Mk 14:62b). Jesus was outwardly devoid of power but possessed of an all-
encompassing inner power (KI:86/103). Though derided and about to be sentenced to death
he invited his hearers to vision and acknowledge his exalted heavenly status. BA* does not
mention the mode of Jesus' death.

BA* concludes his exposition of the heavenly sovereignty of the prophets by likening the
Jewish and Christian rejection of Muhammad to the Muslim rejection of the Bab, the "Point of
the Bayan" (nuqta-yi bayän). The last eighty or more pages (KI:87-164/105-199) of the K Tqan
contain no further biblical quotations though there is much that has been highly influential in
determining the mode and manner of the Baha'i interpretation of the Bible. The following notes
must suffice to sum up and indicate themes of particular importance and influence.
• The Arabic bible text used by Baha'-Allah

In conclusion of this section it will be appropriate to make some preliminary remarks
about BA*s biblical citations in the light of Arabic Bibles available in mid.19th century Iran and
Iraq. A number of Arabic Bibles were available to the Shri 'ulama' and others in Qajar Iran and
19th century Ottoman Iraq. Arabic printed editions of the NT (16th century CE onwards) were
for the most part varieties of a 13th century eclectic Arabic recension known as the "Alexandrian
Vulgate". This lies behind the Arabic version in the ten volume Paris Polyglott (1625-45). Most
pre-19th century partial or complete Arabic printed Bibles were adaptions or revised reprints of
this Paris Polyglott including the Arabic texts within in the Bib//ca Sacra Polyglotta (1653-7) of
bishop Brian Walton (d.1661) known as the 'London Polyglot' (<—).

Also widely distributed in numerous reprints was the 1671, Vatican Vulgate'compared
but little revised Rome published Arabic Bible of Sergius Risius (Sarkis al-Ruzzi, d. 1638) who
worked under the patronage of the Catholic Authorities. This version hardly supersedes the

weaknesses of this Paris or London Polyglots. An early Protestant attempt at updating is the
1727 slightly revised and corrected Arabic NT version by Sulayman ibn Ya s q0b al-SalbanT (of
Damascus = Solomon Negri).

Largely reviewed above, the biblical citations of BA* within the (Ar) Jawahiral-asrar and
Kician dating to the last Iraq years (1860/1-2), are, apart from a few minor paraphrastic
Persian exceptions (Isaiah, John), all Arabic NT quotations. The texts cited are invariably a
Christian Arabic translation, most likely one deriving from the London Polyglot or a slightly
variant NT reprint of this text. These Arabic quotations were probably copied, consulted or
otherwise obtained via Christians, Europeans or missionaries active in Baghdad around 1860.
The occasional idiosyncrasies within the quotations merit further study. They cannot easily all
be accounted for on the basis of variant texts.

While BA*'s pre-Edirne Bible citations are largely if not wholly, directly or indirectly
London Polyglot derived, in later years he seems to have drawn on the Persian translation of
Henry Martyn (K. Bath', c. 1867) and the Protestant Arabic translation of Eli Smith ( d.1857)
and Cornelius van Dyck (d. 1895) which first appeared (as the NT) in 1860(65) the whole Bible
appearing just a few years later. This much favoured version was translated direct from the
biblical languages with some assistance from Butrus al-Bustani (d.1883), YusOf al-AsTr
(d.1889) and NOsif al-Yazijf (d.1871). Frequently printed from the 1860s CE this version
became the standard Arabic text adopted by Protestant missionaries. It was much cited by BA*
and intimately studied by AB*.
• 8. 3 Conclusions: from neo-ShT'T Babi faction to the global Bahal religion of the Book.

The opening chapters of this thesis commenced with an examination of basic aspects
of the Islamic Isralliyyat (Israelitica) tradition, not initially a separate literary tradition but an
orally transmitted phenomenon. It was decided that in this thesis Isra'Tliyyat would be used with
the wider inclusive definition suggested by some academic scholars such as Kister.iAcademic
definitions seem still to be in a state of flux. Israiliyyat at times appears roughly synonymous
with "Abrahamic" and is probably best left transliterated. Just as Muslims assimilated Abrahamic

Isra'Tliyyat traditions and Islamified them, so BabT-Baha'T scriptural sources sometimes give them
new levels of meaning in the light of its emphasis upon a spiritual hermeneutic and new religious
theophany.

The Q. has sometimes been considered an expression of (proto-) Isra tTliyyat. The
Arabic term Isralliyyat may have originated in the 2nd cent. AH being closely associated with
the early practise of tafsTr (Q. commentary) and the tradition of qi;sas al-anbiya' (stories of the
prophets) entertainment and circulation. It may have been through the Yemenite Jewish
convert to Islam, Wahb b. Munabih, a major fountainhead of early Islamic Isralliyyat, that the
term entered the Islamic vocabulary.

The Isralliyyat traditions were initially wholeheartedly embraced within tafsTr, tiadTth and
other emergent Islamic disciplines. A reaction against this great wave of seemingly 'non-Muslim
data' came about within an increasingly self-conscious 'Abbasid (or earlier?) distinctly Muslim
community. Some among the pious came to look negatively upon Isralliyyat despite its obvious
foundational presence in the Q. Early Shrism, however, especially the so-called ghulaww
(extremist) factions, were especially open to the creative apologetic utilization of biblical data,
insights and allegedly proto-ShrT IsralTliyyat traditions. The roots of the centrally important Babi-
Bahal concept of the ism Allah al-a .gam (Mightiest Name of God) traditions are found in certain
of these groups as well as in sources more centrally within mainstream Shi si religious tradition.

Fourteen categories of Islamic literature most centrally enshrining Isralliyyat materials
and traditions were suggested. Four of these areas are especially foundational. They are (1)
TafsTr (Q. commentary), (2) akhbar/ 1.7acilth (traditions), (3) TarIkh (historical sources) and (4)
qisas al-anbiya' (stories of the prophets). It was shown that Babi-Baha'T primary literatures
register Isra'iliyyat materials from each of these four areas as well as the other ten not
discussed in detail here. Original neo-tafsTr materials born out, for example, of the allegorical
story of Joseph are central to Babr and Baha'T salvation history. While BA* presented himself
as the new eschatological Joseph, his great-grandson SE* reckoned this biblical-qur'anic figure
a mazhar-1 ilahT (Manifestation of God). BabT-Baha'T scripture is full of such traditions and

motifs rooted in Islamicate Isra'Tliyyat. They sometimes receive distinctly BabT-Baha'T levels of
meaning.

Shil esoteric traditions including verses of the Khutba al-tutunjiyya ("Sermon of the
Gulf") are viewed as foundational within Babi-Baha'T scripture. Both the Bab and BA*'s self
understanding was shaped by the eschatological expectation of the mukallfin mrisa (He who
conversed with Moses) on Sinai mentioned in this quasi-ghu/uww sermon. It was suggested that
the frequent BobT-Baho'T use of terms like ama' ( loosely, "cloud of unknowing") might go back
through I bn al-'ArabT (or a member of his school) to an early Arabic appropriation of the kind of
traditions found in the writings of Gregory of Nyssa (d. 395), author of the seminal Life ofMoses.

Muslim historians were seen to utilize biblical history and on occasion cite biblical texts.

Certain of these historians viewed the Bible as a work that could be directly cited while others
reckoned it in one way or another subject to tahrif ('falsification') and refrained from citing the
text, though paraphrases were not uncommon, as was the case with al-Tabari. Among the
examples given of the Babi-Baho'T use of Isralliyyat within Islamic history was BA's possible
use of al-BTrOnT's reference to a 'Book of the Ages (skt. [Per.] Kitab-I yoga)' in his Tablet
regarding the pre-Adamic era (Lawh-I qabl-I adarn). It was also pointed out that BA* in this
same writing probably registered a passage found in the K Tanbih of al-Mas' °di about the
association of Abraham's crossing the Jordon with the origin of the term Hebrew ('ibranT)(<-3.2.)

Qijsasal-anbiya' materials in various literary forms were seen to be widespread in BobT-
Baha'T sources. BA* frequently reviewed the lives of major pre-Islamic figures showing how their
rejection was similar to that which he and the Bab experienced. Motifs associated with Joseph,
Job and Moses are greatly utilized in the writings of the Bab and BA*. The perfumed garment
of Joseph, for example, became a type of the spiritually regenerating robe of BA* pictured as
the yust7f al-baha' (All beauteous Joseph). Among the qsasal-anbiya' motifs utilized by BA*
in his K 1-qan is his association of Noah and bada' ("change of circumstances"), which very
likely results from the concerns of the Bob's uncle about a cancelled jihad episode in early BabT
history.

In the discussion of the Bible and Isra'Tliyyat in Shi'i Islam, it was pointed out that Islamic
sources exhibit a widespread transmission of Islamicate or Islamo-biblical sources, often as
pseudo-biblical citations. This was especially true of the early period. Early Islamo-biblical
citations range from reasonably accurate to having nothing whatsoever to do with the Bible as
a piece of canonical Judaeo-Christian scripture. Such variant Islamo-biblical citations not
infrequently found their way into considerably later, greatly respected Islamic sources including
Ibn al-'ArabT and Mulla Sadra. An example set down below is the saying of Jesus originating
with Muqatil b. Sulayman as cited by the great philosopher Mulla Sadra in his commentary on
the UsOI al-kafT.

The charge of biblical tanni ("falsification") levelled by Muslims against 'People of the
Book' was seen to have been exacerbated in the early 19th century Middle East when Pfander
and Henry Martyn indulged in evangelical orientalism in the form of anti-Islamic Christian
missionary propaganda. Shaykh Baha al-DTn al- sAmilT (Shaykh Baha'T), whose name has
nothing to do with his being a kind of 'proto-Baha'T', was one of those Shil figures whose
writings appear to have influenced both Shaykhi and Babi-Baha'T numerological speculations
regarding Adam and Eve and the number nine. It was seen that missionary activity in early Qajar
Iran both made the Bible more readily available than it had been and led around thirty ShisT
Muslims to write anti-missionary tracts.

The sixth chapter of this thesis reviews aspects of the Bible and Isralliyyat in early
Shaykhism, selected writings of Shaykh Ahmad al-Absa'T and Sayyid Kazim RashtT. These two
often arcane exegetes indulged in the s irfani-type interpretation of a number of biblically based
qisas al-anbiya' episodes and motifs, most notably Moses's Sinaiatic request to see God.
These two foundational figures for Babi-Bahal studies on occasion interpreted Islamicate biblical
citations and other points of exegetical interest. The Bab's doctrines and interests have a very
close relationship to these figures. The style of the Bab's Arabic in its deep, intense gnostic
orientation appears close to that of Sayyid Kazim, his one-time teacher. Graphic and other
forms of the ism Allah al-a'gam (Mightiest Name of God) were interpreted in detail by the

architects of Shaykhism, and in this, they prepared the way for the Baha'T theology of the
Greatest Name and the graphic representation of it, which became a central symbol of the
Baha'i religion. Certain of their Islamicate Bible citations were repeated by the Bab.

The main purpose of the last two chapters of this thesis was to examine the nature of the
Bib's alleged or actual Bible knowledge and to make some comments upon the nature of the
Babi-Baha'T interpretation of the Mightiest or Greatest Name motif ultimately believed by
Baha'is to be personified in the figure of BA*. Examination of the Bb's Persian and Arabic
writings failed to locate any citations of the HB and the canonical NT. Canonical NT quotations
from the Bab were likewise found to be non-existent. Islamicate, Islamo-biblical citations of a
distinctly Sufi orientation do appear in the Bb's writings though they have no bearing at all on
his direct knowledge of the canonical, Judaeo-Christian Bible.

E. G. Browne suggested seven signs of NT influence at specific points in the Persian
Bayan of the Bab were each found to be unconvincing. The Bb's alleged citation of NT texts
in his supposed speech to the 'Letters of the Living' found in the SE* redaction of a recension
of the TarTkh-I Zarandl- (= Dawn-Breakers) was also seen to be without foundation. It is thus
concluded that the Bab did not cite any of the books of the Bible, either NT or HB, preferring to
focus upon the all-encompassing spiritual reality of the Q. and his own revelations (the Sayan).
Through his knowledge of jafr (gematric gnosis) and various 'Worn al-ghayb (esoteric
sciences) such as talismanry the Bab claimed as the representative of the hidden Imam and in
doe course a theophanic Being with a "spiritual" knowledge of all Abrahamic scripture. Though
he did not exactly over-rule Islamic tahrif he did regard both the tawrat and the injil as the
kallam Allah (Word of God) even though the spiritual dimension of these sacred texts was all but
negated before the holistic exaltedness of later divine revelations.

The final chapter eight introduced BA* as a leading Babi, and one who early on adopted
the word baha' as his title. In so doing, he centered within himself numerous AbrahArnic motifs
associated with the ism Allah al-a'zam. In doing this, he seems to have been markedly
influenced by the Bb's frequency of the use of this term, especially in his many 'stream of

consciousness' revelations rooted in the two ShII- devotional texts, the Da'a al-sahar and the
Da'a yawm al-mubahala. In particular, BA* saw the former text as a Tablet of Eternity (Lawh
al-baqa) encapsulating the reality of his own spiritual being as the 'secreted' Mightiest Name
of God.

Unlike the Bab, BA* began to cite the Bible, or more specifically the Arabic NT, towards
the end of his Iraq years (1861-2), This most likely came about through his association with
Christian missionaries, one or more of whom may have been responsible for his portrait. The
biblical text cited in his Jawahir and K lqan seem most closely related to the 'Alexandrine text'
as expressed in the London Polyglot Bible of William Walton or one of its many sometimes
redacted Arabic versions. The aforementioned writings of this period contain the first biblical
quotations within Bah al sacred literature. They were greatly expanded by BA* in the
subsequent almost thirty year period of his frequent allegorical interpretation of the Bible.

BA's successors AB* and SE* wrote thousands of texts further expressive of the Baha'T
interpretation of the Bible. The neo-ShrT phenomenon that was the religion of the Bab evolved
through these latter figures into the global Baha'T 'religion of the Book'. The initial appeal of the
Bab to ShrT-ShaykhT Muslims and all humankind in his neo-qur'anic Qayy0m al-asma'( = QA
1) was realized through the modernistic, ecumenical religion of one who claimed to personify
the Mightiest Name of God. The call of the Bahl leaders to Jews, Christians and others began
through the exegesis of the Q. but evolved to incorporate the rehabilitation and modernistic
demythologization of biblical scripture.

manuscripts mostly of the writings of the Bab and BA* as well as some letters (alwah,
'Tablets') of AB* and select other Muslim [ShaykhT] and BabT-Bahal secondary sources.

Over the years a very large quantity of the writings of the Arabic and Persian writings of
the Bab have become available to me, some through the generosity of individuals others
through university collections and Bahl archives. Among the mss I have consulted are the
many works of the Bab found in seventeen volumes of the INBMC series which were privately
published in bound photocopies in Iran in the mid. 1970s. 2 Other Babi mss. within other
