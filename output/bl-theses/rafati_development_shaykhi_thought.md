A note on transliteration and Quranic references
The transliteration system employed in this work for
Arabic Romanization is that of the Library of Congress.
Persian personal names, words in book titles, and geographi-
cal names, however, are transliterated according to the
standard Persian pronunciation. Titles of certain well-
known figures are given in the form by which they are
usually reproduced in English (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh).

For the noun, “Shí‘a” is used; for the adjective,
“Shí‘í”.

All Quranic references are to the English translation
of the Qur’án by Maulvi Muhammad Ali (London, 1917).

Abstract of the dissertation
The Development of Shaykhí Thought in Shí‘í Islam

by

Vahid Rafati
Doctor of Philosophy in Islamic Studies
University of California, Los Angeles, 1979

Professor Amin Banani, Chair

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í (d. 1241/1825), a native of Aḥsá,
founded a new school of thought within the Imámí Shí‘a. The
heterodox doctrines of Shaykh Aḥmad laid the foundations for
a new approach to Shí‘í theology and caused the traditional
Shí‘í theologians to denounce him as an innovator in their
polemical works.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s doctrines were a synthesis of the views
of the Akhbárí and the Uṣúlí schools. He emphasized the
importance of the imáns and prepared his students for the
advent of the Twelfth Imám or Mahdí, whose appearance had
been expected for centuries.

Shaykh Aḥmad wrote extensively, traveled widely and,
with his erudition and personal magnetism, won over adher-
ents from different parts of the country and from different
social and intellectual backgrounds including many members

ix
of the royal family.

After Shaykh Aḥmad’s death, the leadership of his
school fell to Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí, his close student, who
continued Shaykh Aḥmad’s approach and, in numerous works,
elaborated his thoughts. The death of Sayyid Káẓim was
followed by a series of crises, aggravated by the fact that
he did not designate a successor.

The teachings, particularly the predictions, of both
Shaykh Aḥmad and Sayyid Káẓim prepared their followers for
the acceptance of the expected Mahdí. When the Báb, the
founder of the Bábí religious movement, claimed (in 1260/
1244) that he was the expected one, many Shaykhís accepted
his claim.

The Shaykhí school was the latter branch of the Imámí
Shí‘a, an intellectual link between Islam and the Bábí
movement, and a point of departure for a series of religious
and social developments in later periods which had a great
impact upon the intellectual life of the Persians.

Introduction
Throughout its history, Shí‘í Islam has witnessed
numerous sectarian developments and extremes of ideological
diversity. One of the most important and influential
developments occurred during the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries when Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í (d. 1241/1825)
founded a new school of thought which, although still within
the Shí‘í fold, became the focus of sectarian polemics.
Shaykh Aḥmad maintained that the religious leaders no longer
taught the truth, and that truth should be received directly
from divine sources. His school was the direct result of
the religious and social struggles of the period, and it, in
turn, later contributed to social and religious change.

To place the Shaykhí1 school in the context of Islamic
schism, it is useful to sketch the definition of and
approach toward religious sects in general as formulated by
Western scholars on the basis of study of Christian sects,
and then to provide an Islamic perspective on the subject.

The term ‘sect’ refers to a body of believers which has
become separated from the main body of the religious commun-
ity. While one sect of a religious body differs in nature,
ideology, and purpose from other sects of the same religion,
sociological studies show that sects share certain common
social features: they originate out of protest, whether
aggressive or nonaggressive, against the parent organiza-
tion’s beliefs, doctrines, or rituals; they usually consist

of people who belong to a lower class than the members of
the parent church and are sometimes geographically isolated;
they almost always begin functioning under a charismatic
leader; and they come into being as a result of the church’s
inability to meet the social and psychological needs of some
of its members.

B. R. Wilson, a leading authority on sectarianism, has
distinguished six types of sects on the basis of the sect’s
response to the world: (1) conversionist sects, whose
“reaction towards the outside world is to suggest that the
latter is corrupted because man is corrupted”;2 (2) revolu-
tionary sects, whose “attitude towards the outside world is
summed up in a desire to be rid of the present social order
when the time is ripe—if necessary, by force and violence”;3
(3) introversionist sects, “whose response to the world is
neither to convert the population nor to expect the world’s
overturn, but simply in retiring from it to enjoy the
security gained by personal holiness. This type is com-
pletely indifferent to social reforms, to individual
conversion and to social revolutions”;4 (4) manipulationist
sects, which, “previously called gnostic, are those which
insist especially on a particular and distinctive knowledge.
They define themselves vis-à-vis the outside world essen-
tially by accepting its goals”;5 (5) thaumaturgical sects,
or “movements which insist that it is possible for men to
experience the extraordinary effect of the supernatural on
their lives”;6 and (6) reformist sects, which “seem to

constitute a case apart. But the dynamic analytic approach
to religious movements demands a category corresponding to
those groups which, though sectarian in more than one
respect, have affected transformations in their early
response towards the outside world.”7

In the Western literature on Islamic schism, essential
terms such as “sect”, “theological school”, “group”, and
“school of law” are used inconsistently and often inter-
changeably. For example, the writers of articles in the
Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam have used the various terms
listed above to define or describe schisms with common
elements and similar natures. There one finds under
“al-Murdji’a”, “name of one of the early sects of Islam”,8
and under “al-Mu‘tazila” one reads, “the name of the great
theological school which created the speculative dogmatics
of Islam”.9 The “Kháridjites” are called “the earliest of
the religious sects”,10 and “al-Zaidíya” are described as
“the practical groups of the Shí‘a”.11 Furthermore,
“Málikís” are called “the school of law”,12 and for the
“Ḥanafites” the Arabic term “madhhab”—without even its
equivalent in English (which could be “school”)—is used.13

In contrast to the undifferentiated approach illustra-
ted above, the introduction to al-Farq Bayn al-Firaq, a
well-known book by one of the most eminent Muslim heresio-
graphers, Abú Manṣúr ‘Abd al-Qádir b. Ṭáhir al-Baghdádí
(d. 429/1037), is a good example of a Muslim scholar’s
approach toward and evaluation of sects in an Islamic

context.

According to al-Baghdádí, a Tradition on the authority
of the Prophet Muḥammad reads, “My people will be divided
into seventy-three firqa [sections, groups] of which only
one will be saved.”14 Al-Baghdádí categorizes the Islamic
sects into seventy-three, of which the only one to be “saved”
is the Sunní. He differentiates the groups into two main
categories. The first category deals with theological
questions such as the understanding of God, His unity,
justice, and other attributes; free will versus predestina-
tion: the possibility of seeing God on the Day of Judgement;
and the qualities of the Prophet Muḥammad. Each sect
maintains its own attitude toward these questions, and each
group, considering itself right and justified, accuses the
others of being infidels. The second category comprises
jurisprudential questions defined by an understanding of
Quranic teachings. The jurisprudential attitudes of a sect
are not considered grounds for accusing its members of being
infidels.

To decide who belonged to the saved sect and who did
not, al-Baghdádí had to provide a definition for the term
“Muslim”. He enumerates various definitions according to
different sects, and then he states the definition which,
apparently, is accepted by the saved sect, namely the
Sunnís.

According to the Karámíya sect, a Muslim is one who
believes in the oneness of God and in His Prophet Muḥammad.

According to another sect, a Muslin is one who believes that
(1) the universe is accidental (ḥádith), (2) God and His
attributes are eternal, (3) Muḥammad is the messenger of
God for the entire human world, (4) Muḥammad’s religion will
last forever, (5) the Qur’án is the main source for religi-
ous order, and (6) the Ka‘ba is the direction of obligatory
prayer. Al-Baghdádí then asserts, as the last condition of
belief, that a true Muslim does not set up or adhere to
heretical doctrine (bid‘a), of which he identifies two
categories. The first category of heretical doctrine causes
a believer (Muslim) to become a nonbeliever. For example,
the members of Bayáníya or Mughayríya sects would not be
considered Muslims because they maintain the divinity of the
imáms. Belief in incarnation, or belief in the acceptabili-
ty of marriage between a man and his daughter’s daughter,
which was practiced by the Maymúníya, made them cease to be
Muslims, according to al-Baghdádí. Similarly, the belief
that Islam would be abrogated on the Last Day was a hereti-
cal doctrine which caused the Abáḍíya to become non-Muslims
in his view.

The second category of heretical doctrine does not
cause the believer to become a nonbeliever, but it does
deprive him of some social rights. For example, he can
neither lead the group prayer nor marry a woman from among
the saved sect, the Sunnís.

Al-Baghdádí’s approach to Islamic sects appears to
imply that only heretical doctrines concerning religious

matters played a role in generating new sects in Islam. To
support his claim that social and economic factors did not
play any part, he contends that the controversial issues
raised immediately after the death of the Prophet were also
of theological or religious nature, and that Abú Bakr, who
became the first successor (caliph) of the Prophet, solved
them all by quoting the Prophet’s statements (ḥadíth); thus,
none of the issues caused schism in Islam at that tine.
Such controversial issues included the question of whether
the Prophet was dead or had ascended to heaven like Jesus;
whether the Prophet should be buried in Mecca, his birth-
place, or in Medina, the city of Emigration where he
established his religion; whether the Prophet’s successor
(imám) could be a man from outside the Prophet’s clan
(Quraysh) or had to be a member of the Quraysh. Although
every one of these issues had immediate socio-political
implications, it is significant that traditional Muslim
perspective assigns merely theological value to them. In
fact, two jurisprudential issues had been raised: (1) could
anyone inherit from the Prophet, or did his property belong
to the community? and (2) was a non-zakát (alms) payer still
a Muslim? Even the imamate, the question of who would
succeed the Prophet, which split Islam, was originally
perceived as a religious issue and only later developed into
a social and political dispute.

In actuality, the “religious” problems that caused
schism in Islam, like the issue of the imamate, could also

fall into the categories of jurisprudential, theological,
and philosophical differences in the interpretation of the
Qur’án and ḥadíth, the validity and authenticity of ḥadíth,
daily worship practices, and theological discussions about
God, the prophets, the angels, and man’s predestination or
free will.

The applicability of the terms “sect”, “movement”,
“school”, and so on, to these doctrines depends upon the
definition of these terms within the framework of Islamic
history, the social function of the group, its sense of
group solidarity, and the relationship of the schismatic
group to the parent group. It must be borne in mind,
however, that it is nearly impossible to draw a line between
“sects” and “schools” in Islam, or to affix a certain term
to a certain group and expect the tern to be applicable in
all the historical phases of that group.

The Shaykhí school has been referred to in Persian
works as “firqa” (division, section) or “madhhab” (school,
religious creed), but more often as “Shaykhíya”, a term
consisting of “Shaykh” and the sufix “íya” which denotes
either a group of people who follow a certain person, for
example, “Zaydíya”, or a group with a certain ideological
system, such as “Qadaríya”.

In this work the term “Shaykhí school” is used, being
the preferred term of the Shaykhís themselves and appropri-
ate to a theological study of the Shaykhí ideology, which is
intended as a primary attempt at clarification of the

intellectual parameters of the Shaykhí school, as well as
examining the issue in its wider historical context.

The Shaykhí school, although primarily a theological
school, had definite practical and sociological implications,
promoted group cohesion, strengthened the moral order, and
offered new approaches toward dogmatic, traditional prin-
ciples of Shí‘í thought. Although the school’s theoretical
approaches were a revolution in the Shí‘a, they were strong-
ly rooted in Shí‘í Traditions and the utterances of the
Shí‘í imáms. The school reevaluated Shí‘í dogmas, redefined
the religious norms, reconsidered the traditional under-
standing of Shí‘í beliefs, and introduced a series of new
doctrines, not in the name of a new independent value-
oriented movement or religious revolution, but as a system
which claimed to be the very essence of Shí‘í thought. Many
Shí‘í authorities did not accept this claim, however, and
considered the Shaykhí school to be heresy.

The doctrines of the Shaykhí school were a syncretism
of indigenous religious Shí‘í beliefs, and were not imported
from foreign cultural or religious ideologies. Of the
theological, sociological, and ritual aspects that character-
ize the school, this study is concerned mainly with the
theological aspects, for it is the theological doctrines of
the school that form its strongest connection to the
mainstream of Shí‘í thought, and also constitute the most
significant links between the school and the Bábí religious
movement. In studying the theology of the school, only the

basic ideas of Shaykhí ontology and eschatology will be
discussed. A detailed discussion of the sources which
influenced the Shaykhí school, and of nature of the similar-
ities between the ideology of the Shaykhí school and other
theological and philosophical trends of thought, is beyond
the scope of this work.

In spite of the fact that numerous significant social
and political events took place during this era, few
scholarly works about the period have been written. The
religious and intellectual climate has received even less
scholarly attention. The abundance of historical sources,15
travelers’ narratives, biographical works, political
documents, and religious treatises produced in this era
requires careful study and presents a challenge to the
scholar.

This study employs an analytical approach based on
primary sources written by Shaykh Aḥmad and Sayyid Káẓim
Rashtí, his successor. In discussing points of controversy
between the Shaykhí school and other trends of thought,
reference is made to scholarly works by specialists in the
field.

Shaykh Aẓmad’s contribution in reconciling conflicting
beliefs unified a group of people from different social
backgrounds and geographical regions and prepared them
intellectually to accept the Báb, who in the middle of the
nineteenth century claimed to be the fulfillment of the
Islamic expectation of the Mahdí and ultimately proclaimed

that his was a religious system independent of Islam, with a
new revealed Holy Book.

While the Shaykhí school was not a value-oriented,
religious revolutionary, messianic, and charismatic movement,
it contained the seeds of all these features, which were
later to germinate and develop to fruition in the Bábí
movement, a movement which proved to be broader in scope and
more comprehensive in ideology than the Shaykhí school which
had preceded it.

I
The religious, intellectual climate of Iran during

the first half of the nineteenth century
The Qájár period (1193/1779–1342/1924) was character-
ized by the transformation of long-established institutions
and the emergence of new approaches to social and religious
life in Iran. It was a period of despair, of decline in
intellectual creativity, and of spiritual and material
deprivation. It was a period of European imperialistic
designs, during which Eastern and Western cultures met and
clashed. The transformation of institutions gave rise to
several major political and religious reforms which, in
depth, scope, and creativity, differed from many other
reforms in Persian history.

Shí‘í Islam, as the fundamental element in the life,
manners, and attitudes of the Persians, has had a great
influence upon the mentality, character, and attitudes of
the Persians in their social and private life. Islam has
also played a peculiar and influential role in all aspects
of the intellectual and moral climate of the nation.
Therefore, no study of the socio-political history of the
Persians could be attempted without a close consideration of
religious attitudes.

A comprehensive study of the religious climate of the
period is still to be undertaken. In such a study, the
activities of the religious circles, the life and the

contributions of the individual ‘ulamá, and relations among
the ‘ulamá themselves and with the people, rulers, and
religious minorities are important elements which must be
considered in order to comprehend the roots of the religious
reforms.

The intent of the present chapter is to sketch the
basic facts in the religious life of the Persians in order
to provide a foundation for the discussion of the main
Shaykhí doctrines.

Shí‘í Islam has been a factor in the religious life of
Iran from the early period of the Islamic era. From the
Ṣafavíd period (907/1501–1145/1732), to the present, except
for a short time during the Afshár Dynasty (1148/1736–1210/
1795), Shí‘a has been the official religious system of Iran.
The strong intellectual connection of the Persian Shí‘a with
the Shí‘í centers of ‘Atabát1 must be emphasized. The holy
shrines of the Shí‘í imáns and the Shí‘í circles of ‘Atabát
have always attracted the Persian Shí‘a and have been the
most respected places for Shí‘í studies in the Islamic
world. Although Iran has several well-known centers for
these studies, such as Mashhad, Qom, Iṣfahán, and Tehrán, it
is generally believed that the best schools and the most
qualified teachers for advanced studies in Shí‘í doctrines
are located in ‘Atabát. Attendance at the lectures of the
Shí‘í ‘ulamá in ‘Atabát and study in their circles is the
utmost desire of the Shí‘í knowledge seeker.

The curriculum of the circles consists of the study of

the Qur’án, Shí‘í tafsír (interpretation), ḥadíth (Tradition),
fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and Arabic grammar. The
students begin their career by memorizing the Qur’án and by
studying the Arabic language through memorization of the
Niṣáb al-Ṣibyán of Badr al-Dín Maḥmúd b. Abí Bakr Faráhí
(d. 1208/1793). Alongside the Niṣáb, or a little later in
their studies, the Amthila and Ṣarf Mír of Mír Sayyid Sharíf
Jurjání (816/1413) are studied as basic texts for Arabic
grammar. In the literary sciences (e.g., Ma‘ání, Bayár, and
Badí‘), the Muṭawwal of Mas‘úd b. ‘Umar Sa‘d Taftázání
(d. 793/1390) is the basic text. In principles of juris-
prudence the Ma‘álim al-Uṣúl of Shaykh Ḥasan b. Zayn al-Dín
al-Shahíd al-Thání, or the Qawánín al-Muḥkama fi al-Uṣúl of
Mírzá Abú al-Qásim b. Muḥammad Ḥasan, known as Mírzá-i Qomí
(d. 1231/1815), is taught. Although the basic courses
offered in each circle are almost identical, the material
covered in each course and the duration of the course
depends on the interest of the teacher.2

Fields of specialization do not exist, and each learned
man can teach whatever he wishes. The teachers of higher
rank are expected to answer any questions and discuss any
religious issue. In spite of the lack of specialization in
religious studies, some of the ‘ulamá are better known for
their knowledge and authority in certain fields. The most
respected teachers are those who can teach different courses
to many students.

The term of study in ‘Atabát is not fixed. Students

may stay in ‘Atabát anywhere from a few months to five, or
even seven, years. They usually complete a course by
writing a treatise on a religious subject. If the treatise
is approved by the teacher, the writer is awarded an ijáza
(authorization, license).3 An ijáza is a great honor for a
student and the official recognition of his academic, moral,
and religious qualifications. The fame and the esteem of
the issuer of an ijáza is significant for the later relig-
ious and academic life of the receiver: biographical books
always provide the names of the ‘ulamá from whom the ‘álim
has received his ijázas.4

In spite of the fact that the religious circles of
‘Atabát and Iran provided religious education for hundreds
of Shí‘a, the general public, which was illiterate, lacked
any formal religious education, and the general knowledge of
the Shí‘í community rarely went beyond the details of daily
rituals. In such a society, the religious understanding of
the individuals is based on obedience to religious leaders.
The fact that in Persian society only a certain group of
people receive a religious education is partly due to the
fact that a person traditionally follows the occupation of
his father, and, as a result, several members of one family
often receive a good education, and even reach the highest
ranks of religious leadership.5

During this period, a great number of books and
treatises were written in various fields of Islamic
sciences.6 It is reported, for example, that Mullá Muḥammad

Ja‘far Astarábádí (d. 1263/1846) wrote 70 books,7 and Sayyid
Káẓim Rashtí (d. 1259/1843) wrote 150.8 Although, on the
basis of these reports, the number of religious works of the
period approaches several thousand volumes, the majority of
them are in the nature of marginal notes to the well-known
works of the earlier Shí‘í writers. Rather than encouraging
originality and creativity, Shí‘í scholarship has pursued
various forms of taqríẓ (eulogy), taḥshíya (insertion), and
talkhíṣ (abridgment) on the important works of the past.9
For example, among the works written by Astarábádí, fourteen
are in the form of taḥshíya and sharḥ (exegesis).10

Very rarely did an ‘álím concentrate his works in one
field. Fame and popularity among the ‘ulamá also depended
on their versatility. The result was a multitude of authors
who contributed very little to the critical study of Shí‘í
scholarship.

The language of the scholarly texts in Islam has always
been Arabic. Although during this period the tendency
toward writing religious texts in Persian was beginning to
increase among some of the ‘ulamá, the main works of all the
distinguished ‘ulamá were still being written in Arabic.

An examination of the religious works of the period
reveals that aside from a few influential and well-respected
works on fiqh, such as Shaykh Murtaḍá Anṣárí’s (d. 1281/1864)
works, greatest attention was given primarily to the minor
questions of fiqh, while much less attention was given other
religious fields. This is understandable, for each mujtahid

tried to consolidate his authority as the “marja‘-i taqlíd”
by providing an immediate and personal framework of legal
sanctions relating to a plethora of daily dilemmas in the
lives of his followers. Works on fiqh were so common that
it is hard to find an ‘álim who did not write a few works on
this subject. It is not surprising, then, that only a small
number of them have been accepted and widely used by the
entire Shí‘í community.

In the field of tafsír nothing was written that is
comparable, either in length or in quality, to the earlier
Shí‘í tafsírs, such as the Majma‘ al-Bayán by Ṭabrisí
(d. 548/1153).11 The well-known books of tafsír written in
this period are commentaries on a few verses or chapters of
the Qur’án. A full, comprehensive commentary was not
attempted.12

The ‘ulamá, collectively known in Persian society as
the Jámi‘a-i Rúḥáníyat (the spiritual concourse), were in
charge of religious rituals.13 The members of this group,
although differing from one another in rank, all functioned
as commentators on the Qur’án and Islamic law, religious
leaders, judges, teachers, arbitrators, managers of the holy
shrines, and recipients of the income of the religious
endowments (auqáf). They were also entitled to receive the
khums14 on behalf of the imáms.

The ‘ulamá were in charge of various socio-religious
affairs of the community. They were trusted by the people as
representatives of the holy imáms among the Shí‘a. They

were also considered the true leaders, decision makers,
reliable sources, and leading authorities in religious
doctrine, and were thought to be the arbiters of the common
good of the community. Such an attitude gave the ‘ulamá
power and influence and enabled them to assume leading roles
in social conflicts. The ‘ulamá were also a refuge for
people who were treated unjustly. In this respect they were
the main link between the ruling class and the masses.

The involvement of the ‘ulamá in various socio-
religious affairs produced a noticeable competition among
them for students, attendance at daily prayers, and income
from auqáf. In most cases, it was accompanied by ideologic-
al disputes. The most common device used against one’s
rivals was takfír (accusing someone of being an infidel),
which could cause the accused person to lose his following
and even be put to death by the followers of the issuer of
the takfír. Takfír was always pronounced in the name of
defending and protecting Islamic interests.

The relationship between the ‘ulamá and the ruling
class was not fixed and determined. It varied on an
individual as well as temporal basis. As the nature of the
relationship was affected by many factors, any generaliza-
tion on this subject must be made with care. Since religion
was the most influential factor in the private and social
life of the Islamic community, naturally the ‘ulamá were
the most respected and influential group. They ascribed to
themselves the roles of interpreters of the Word of God and

protectors of Islam on earth. As a result of such functions,
the rulers of Islamic societies needed the support of the
‘ulamá to consolidate their political positions. They would
obtain wider support and popularity if they could establish
friendly relations with the ‘ulamá. Politically or militar-
ily weak rulers particularly required their support. It is
generally true that, as the power and stability of a ruler
increased, his appeal for ‘ulamá’s support decreased, but it
must immediately be added that the personal tendencies of
the ruler played a fundamental role in defining his rela-
tions with the ‘ulamá. A ruler with a religious interest
was more attached to the ‘ulamá than a ruler lacking such an
interest. From the standpoint of the ‘ulamá, the personal
tendencies of the ‘álim were significant in defining his
relations with the rulers. While some of the ‘ulamá were so
detached from material involvement that they paid no heed to
the rulers, others were active in political affairs. This
group, which did not object to being paid by the court,
carried out its commands and tended to forget their roles as
spiritual leaders. It is true, however, that an ‘álim was
better able to fulfill his function if he had a satisfactory
relationship with the rulers. Mutual support was, therefore,
of benefit to both sides.

Fatḥ ‘Alí Sháh (d. 1250/1834), who was a man with a
strong religious sense,15 respected, financially supported,
and paid visits to the ‘ulamá. The Sháh invited Mullá
Ja‘far of Astarábád (d. 1263/1846) to Tehrán and housed him

near the royal palace, visiting him at least once a month.16

It is also reported that Fatḥ (‘Alí Sháh visited Mullá ‘Abd
Alláh Zonozí (d. 1257/1841) and presented gifts to him and
to his students.17 Mullá ‘Abd al-Razzaq Donbolí (d. 1242/
1820) states that Náyib al-Salṭana ‘Abbás Mírzá (d. 1249/
1833) and Qá’im Maqám (d. 1251/1835) expressed the utmost
respect for the ‘ulamá. Náyib al-Salṭana was said to attend
the congregational prayer every Friday, and Qá’im Maqám
would host a reception for the ‘ulamá every Thursday and
Friday.18 It is also reported that Muḥammad ‘Alí Mírzá
(d. 1237/1821), son of Fatḥ ‘Alí Sháh and the governor of
Kermánsháh, invited Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í (d. 1241/1825) to
Kermánsháh and paid him one thousand tománs19 for his travel
expenses. Shaykh Aḥmad was also paid a monthly salary of
seven hundred tománs.20

In spite of such generosity and kindness, rulers did
not tolerate any serious opposition from the ‘ulamá:
whenever the ‘ulamá threatened the security of a ruler, he
would act against them.21

Doctrinal conflict and crisis was at a high level during
this period and affected the entire life and attitude of the
Persian Shí‘a. In the year 260/873 when, according to the
Shí‘í belief, the Twelfth Imám disappeared in Sámarrá and
his occultation (ghaybat) began, the Shí‘a were cut off from
his direct religious and spiritual guidance. Prior to that
time, religious problems had been solved by asking his
advice or by emulating his conduct, deeds, and words.

Therefore, the Traditions were consulted as the main sources
for Islamic law. This situation continued until the end of
the Lesser Occultation (which began in 260/873 and ended in
324/940).22 By the beginning of the Greater Occultation
(329/940), the Shí‘a could only refer to the Qur’án and the
Traditions on the authority of the Prophet and the imáms,
since all material connection with the imáms had been
severed in 329/940. In the early decades of the occultation
period, the most important collections of Traditions, which
are considered to be second in validity only to the Qur’án,
were compiled by Kolayní (d. 329/940), Ṣadúq (Ibn Bábawayh)
(d. 381/991), and Ṭosí (460/1067).

The occultation of the imám raised a fundamental
question: who would be the center of authority and what
would be the sources of legislation? Some Shí‘í scholars
believed it was permissible to employ “reason” to solve
problems for which the Qur’án and the Traditions offered no
clear solutions. Other Shí‘í scholars considered the Qur’án
and the Traditions to be sufficient sources for legislation
and maintained that there was no need to use individual
reasoning for new religious cases. In the early period, the
dispute between the two groups, although important, did not
create a serious rift in the Shí‘í community, but in the
late fifteenth century, when confessional affiliation
assumed major importance in the tribal struggles for power
in northwestern Iran, the gap widened until two separate
groups, the Akhbárís and the Uṣúlís, emerged.

The Akhbárís identify as the earliest Akhbárí scholars
Kolayní and Ṣadúq, who collected and classified the
Traditions. The next great Shí‘í scholar was Muḥammad b.
‘Alí known as Ibn Abí Jumhúr of Aḥsá (d. about 901/1495),23
who appeared a full five centuries later. Akhbárí theology,
with a distinct ideological system, begins with Mullá
Muḥammad Amín Astarábádí (d. 1025 or 1031 or 1036/1617, 1621
or 1626).

Mullá Muḥammad Amín b. Muḥammad Sharíf Astarábádí was
born in Astarábád and resided in Mecca and Medina. He was
the first ‘álim to challenge the authenticity of the
mujtahids’ (Uṣúlís’) judgments,24 and in many books,
including the Fawá’id al-Madaníya, accused the mujtahids of
being the cause of corruption in Islam.25 Although the
founding of the Akhbárí school by Astarábádí marks the
division of the Shí‘í ‘ulamá into two antagonistic groups,
it was not until the eighteenth century that the Uṣúlí
ideology was identified with a particular founder.

After Muḥammad Amín Astarábádí, the Akhbárí school
included a number of scholars such as Mullá Muḥsin Fayḍ
Káshání (d. 1091/1680), who wrote the Safínat al-Naját and
criticized the Uṣúlís. Fayḍ states in the Safínat al-Naját
that religious legislation can be based only on the Qur’án
and the Traditions, not on the other sources used by the
Uṣúlís.26 After Fayḍ, the doctrines of the Akhbárí school
were developed by ‘ulamá such as Mullá Muḥammad Ṭáhir of Qom
(d. 1098/1686), Mullá Khalíl b. Ghází of Qazvín (d. 1098/

1686),27 and Shaykh Muḥammad b. Ḥasan Ḥurr ‘Ámilí (d. 1033/
1623). Among these, Shaykh ‘Ámilí is the most important
because of his work, Wasá’il al-Shí‘a. He also wrote the
Fawá’id al-Tosíya, a book on Akhbárí ideology which attacked
the approach of the Uṣúlís. In addition to the above works,
‘Ámilí wrote the Hadíyat al-Abrár, devoted to the disputes
between the Akhbárís and the Usúlís. He also wrote the
Hidáyat al-Umma ilá Aḥkám al-A’imma. As a major voice of
“learned orthodoxy”, he was opposed to the “ecstatic
heterodoxy” of the Ṣúfís.28

The views of Astarábádí, which were supported and
enriched by the later Akhbárí ‘ulamá, were accepted by the
majority of the Shí‘a in Iran, Iraq, and the Gulf provinces.
Shaykh ‘Alí b. Sulaymán Baḥrayní (d. 1062/1651) established
the Akhbárí school in Baḥrayn29 and was followed by Shaykh
Sulaymán b. ‘Abd Alláh Máhúzí (d. 1121/1709) and his
students. The intellectual activities of the Akhbárís in
Baḥrayn made the province a major Akhbárí center. The most
distinguished Akhbárí scholar of Baḥrayn was Shaykh ‘Abd
Alláh b. Ṣáliḥ Samáhíjí (d. 1135/1722), who severely
attacked Uṣúlí beliefs and went to extremes in his enmity
toward the Uṣúlís. Samáhíjí has described the views of the
Akhbárís and the Uṣúlís in two of his works. The first, the
Munyat al-Mumárisín fí Ajwabat Su’álát al-Shaykh Yásín
(Yásín b. Ṣáliḥ al-Dín), was cited by the famous biographer
Mírzá Muḥammad Báqir Khánsárí (d. 1313/1895) to describe the
ideological differences between the two groups. The second,

al-Núḥíya, clearly states that the Shí‘a are not obliged to
obey the mujtahids because such an obligation is not
established by God, the Prophet, or the imáms.30

The later Akhbárí scholar, Shaykh Yúsuf b. Aḥmad
Baḥrayní (d. 1186/1772), well-known for his books, the
Ḥadá’iq al-Náḍira and the Lu’lu’at al-Baḥrayn, was a
moderate. He criticized the extremist Akhbárís in his work,
al-Durr al-Najafíya fí Radd al-Akhbáríya.31 It was during
the lifetime of this man that the founder of the Uṣúlí
school, Muḥammad Báqir b. Muḥammad Akmal al-Dín of
Behbahán
(d. 1205/1790), known as Waḥíd Behbahání, rose against the
Akhbárís, and Shaykh Yúsuf Baḥrayní gave way to the new
Uṣúlí ideology.

Muḥammad b. ‘Abd al-Nabí Akhbárí (d. 1232/1816), better
known as Muḥaddith Nísháborí, was the last distinguished
Akhbárí scholar. He wrote the Qal‘ al-Asás fí Naqḍ Asás al-
Uṣúl32 and the Maṣádir al-Anwár fi al-Ijtihád wa al-Akhbár
to criticize the Uṣúlí mujtahids. Muḥaddith Nísháborí was
killed by the Uṣúlís in 1232/1816 in Kaẓimayn at the age of
54\.33

The persecution of Muḥaddith Nísháborí and the rise of
Muḥammad Báqir Behbahání put an end to the Akhbárí school;
Akhbárí ideology, which had for centuries dominated the
religious and intellectual life of the Shí‘a in the main
Shí‘í scholastic centers, was replaced by the Uṣúlí
ideology.

Although the historical roots of Uṣúlí thought go back

to the occultation period, and since then there have been
numerous Uṣúlí ‘ulamá among the Shí‘a, Muḥammad Báqir
Behbahání is considered to be the founder of the Uṣúlí
school.34 The new jurisprudential system he formulated was
subsequently adopted by the Shí‘a, and with some modifica-
tions was accepted by well-known scholars such as Shaykh
Murtaḍá Anṣárí and Mullá Muḥammad Káẓim (d. 1329/1911),
known as Ákhond Khorásání.

Because of his contribution to the formulation of
Uṣúlí thought, Behbaháni became known among the Shí‘a as
Mu’assis Behbahání (Founder), Murawwij Behbahání (Dissemina-
tor), Ostád-i Akbar (Great Teacher), and Ostád-i Kull (The
Teacher of Everyone). He wrote a number of books, mostly in
Persian, among which the Risála dar Ijtihád va Akhbár is
significant for its repudiation of Akhbárí views and for its
support of the position of the mujtahid and his functions,
namely, ijtihád (individual judgment).35 He also wrote two
other works on the same subject: Inḥiṣár-i Mardom bi
Mujtahid va Muqallid,36 on the theme that people are either
legists or imitators, and the Fawá’id al-Uṣúlíya, a
refutation of the Fawá’id al-Madaníya of Muḥammad Amín b.
Muḥammad Sharíf Astarábádí.

Behbahání’s views on the legislative authority of the
‘ulamá won universal acceptance in Shí‘í circles through the
work and efforts of some distinguished students of the
Behbahání circle who wrote, preached, and popularized the
viewpoints of the Uṣúlís. One of these was Shaykh Ja‘far

Najafí (d. 1227/1812), the author of the well-known work,
Kashf al-Ghiṭá. The beginning of this book is devoted to a
description of the Uṣúlí approach to legislative problems.
Najafí also wrote two other works on the same subject: the
first, al-Ḥaqq al-Mubín fi al-Radd ‘ala al-Akhbárítyín,37 to
discuss the views of two parties and to reject the extremist
Akhbárís, and the second, another Kashf al-Ghiṭá, to refute
the views of Muḥaddith Nísháborí. Najafí sent a copy of this
book to Fatḥ ‘Alí Sháh to prove to him the falsity of the
beliefs of the Akhbárís and of their leading authority,
Muḥaddith Nísháborí.38

Behbahání’s views were elaborated in the works of the
later Uṣúlís, and the repudiation of the Akhbárís continued
in the works of other Uṣúlí ‘ulamá such as Muḥammad
Ṭabáṭabá’í (d. 1242/1826).39 The dispute between the
Akhbárís and the Uṣúlís did not remain on an intellectual
level. It became so intense that the Uṣúlís killed
Muḥaddith Nísháborí for his Akhbárí views and fed his body
to the dogs.40

The polemical works41 of the Uṣúlís and their violent
measures against the Akhbárís caused the Akhbárís to lose their
leadership of the Shí‘í community. The transfer of
religious leadership from the Akhbárís to the Uṣúlís was a
turning point in the history of Shí‘í doctrine. It gave
the ‘ulamá an active role in the political and social
development of the nation. The leadership of the Uṣúlí
‘ulamá, such as that of Mír Sayyid Muḥammad Ṭabáṭabá’í,

known as Mujáhid,42 against the Russians (in 1241/1825)
during the reign of Fatḥ ‘Alí Sháh, is a clear example of
the part the Uṣúlís played in shaping the destiny of the
Persian nation.43

The crucial doctrine of the Akhbárís and the Uṣúlís
rests on the question of the authority of the religious
leader.44 The Uṣúlís believe that a Shí‘a can reach the
position of ijtihád through his personal study of Islamic
sciences. A man who is well educated and known for his
piety, nobility, and moral standing may become a mujtahid.
Whoever reaches these required qualifications45 is able to
interpret Islamic law and legislate regulations which do not
already exist in the Qur’án and the Traditions. In addition,
the Uṣúlís believe that a mujtahid is the representative of
the imám among the Shí‘a and that obedience to the mujtahid
is obligatory in the Shí‘í community. Therefore, the
personal understanding and judgment of a mujtahid, which is
based on the Qur’án and the Traditions, must be accepted and
followed by the Shí‘a who are the imitators (muqallid) of
the mujtahid. Thus, the Uṣúlís believe that the “gate”
(báb) of ijtihád is open for the Shí‘a.

For the Akhbárís, on the other hand, the personal
understanding of the mujtahid is not acceptable. While the
Akhbárís hold that only the text of the Qur’án and the
Traditions are legitimate sources for legislation, the
Uṣúlís maintain that the principles (uṣúl) from which
solutions to religious problems can be derived are four:

(1) the Kitáb (Qur’án), (2) the sunna (the deeds, conduct,
and sayings of the Prophet and the imáms, i.e., Traditions),
(3) ijmá‘ (consensus of the authorities in a legal question
the precedent for which does not exist in the first and
second sources), and (4) ‘aql (reason).

Since the Traditions are substantially significant for
the Akhbárís, they give full validity to all of the
Traditions collected in the Four Books of the Shí‘í
Traditions, namely, Káfí, Tahdhíb, Istibṣár, and Man lá
Yaḥḍuruhu al-Faqíh. For the Uṣúlís, on the contrary, the
contents of the Four Books do not have the same validity.
The Uṣúlís allow action on the basis of “opinion”
(ẓann) when they cannot reach “knowledge” (‘ilm), whereas
the Akhbárís do not trust opinion. They contend that
knowledge is always attainable from the Traditions and is
trustworthy.

Uṣúlí doctrine maintains that there are two groups in
Shí‘í society: (1) mujtahids (legalists formulating
independent decisions in legal or theological matters, based
on the interpretation and application of the four uṣúl), and
(2) muqallids (imitators, who imitate the mujtahids as their
religious guides). The Akhbárís believe that the Shí‘a must
only imitate the infallible figures, that is, the imáms, and
not the mujtahids, who are not infallible.

Concerning ijtihád, the Uṣúlis assert that it is
possible for anyone to reach the position of ijtihád through
his personal endeavors during the occultation period (which

lasts until the appearance of the Mahdí), and whenever he
has reached that position he is qualified to legislate
religious regulations. The Akhbárís, on the other hand,
believe that perfect religious knowledge cannot be obtained
during the period of occultation because knowledge must be
obtained from infallible sources, i.e., the imáms: thus
knowledge is obtainable only from the Traditions. Therefore,
they deny that the mujtahids possess perfect knowledge and
understanding on religious questions.

The ‘Ilm al-Uṣúl46 is a significant field of study for
the Uṣúlís and a mujtahid must be a master in this field.
The Akhbárís disregard the ‘Ilm aI-Uṣúl and believe that
sound knowledge of the terminologies employed in the
Traditions is sufficient to understand the law.

Another fundamental point of dispute between the two
schools deals with the imitation of a deceased mujtahid.
While the Uṣúlís do not regard it lawful to imitate a
deceased mujtahid, the Akhbárís do.

Regarding the use of the Qur’án and the Traditions, the
Uṣúlís prefer to use the esoteric meaning of these works,
whereas the Akhbárís are inclined to use the interpretations
of the Qur’án and the Traditions offered by the imáms, if
they are available. In regard to the “chain of Traditions”,
while the Uṣúlís do not allow reference to Traditions
related by an authority who is not infallible, the Akhbárís
recognize as authentic Traditions related by ordinary people.

A comparison of the two schools shows that the Uṣúlí

school believes in the individual authority of the mujtahids.

The school also admits the freedom of personal understanding
and, as a result, keeps the “gate” of ijtihád open. The
flexibility of the Uṣúlí approach toward law may have been
the major reason for its appeal to the majority of the Shí‘a.
This flexibility and the individualistic nature of the
Uṣúlís may also have aided the Shí‘í law to be more
adaptable to the new needs of the society.

While the social and geographical background of the
leading Akhbárí authorities show that they were mainly the
residents of Mecca, Medina, and the Arabic provinces of the
Gulf area, the Uṣúlís were mainly Iranian, either residents
of Iran or ‘Atabát. In addition, because Muḥammad Báqir
Behbahání, the founder of the Uṣúlí school, wrote mostly in
Persian, and also because the Uṣúlí ‘ulamá participated in
nationalistic movements during the Qájár period, the Uṣúlís
may be considered as forerunners of the nationalistic
movement which, in its early days, appeared in religious
form. As such, the Uṣúlís may perhaps be regarded as the
Persian element against the Arabs, or at least against the
Arabic element, which predominated in the intellectual and
social background of the Akhbárí leaders. The Persian
nature of the Uṣúlí school was probably a reason for its
popularity among the Iranians. From the intellectual point
of view, it is evident that the rise of the Uṣúlís repre-
sents the return of “rationalism” to the religious attitude
of the Persians after being dominated by the fundamentalist

approach of the Akhbárís.

II
Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í

his life and works
Sources on the life of Shaykh Aḥmad
Information on the life and achievements of Shaykh
Aḥmad Aḥsá’í, the founder of the Shaykhí school, is to be
found in the main biographical works written on the life of
the eminent figures of Iran in the Qájár period.1 In
addition to the biographical works, general histories of
Qájár Persia as well as encyclopedias on Iran and Islam2
contain information about the Shaykh and his movement.

The oldest and most authentic source on the life of
Shaykh Aḥmad is a short treatise written by Shaykh Aḥmad
himself at the request of his son, Shaykh Muḥammad Taqí.
This work provides brief information about the childhood and
education of Shaykh Aḥmad and some facts about the social
and religious climate of his society. The work was
published in the Fihrist3 and also separately by Ḥusayn ‘Alí
Maḥfúẓ.4 In addition to this autobiography, Shaykh ‘Abd
Alláh, another son of Shaykh Aḥmad, wrote a treatise in
Arabic on the life of his father. This work was translated
into Persian and published by Muḥammad Ṭáhir Khán.5 Another
primary source on the life and achievements of Shaykh Aḥmad
was Dalíl al-Mutaḥayyirín6 written in 1258/1842 by Sayyid
Káẓim Rashtí (d. 1259/1843), the successor of Shaykh Aḥmad.

This work contains biographical information about the life
of Shaykh Aḥmad and the author himself. The author has
included excerpts of the ijázas of Shaykh Aḥmad and a list
of his works. According to the Fihrist,7 the work was
translated into Persian by Muḥammad Raḍí b. Muḥammad Riḍá, a
follower of Sayyid Káẓim. Another primary source on the
life of Shaykh Aḥmad, the Hidáyat al-Ṭálibín,8 was written
in 1261/1845 by Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán Kermání (d. 1288/
1871), the second leader of the Shaykhís. This book,
basically a response to the ideological opponents of Shaykh
Aḥmad, includes a description of the Shaykh’s personality
and some of his doctrines.

In addition to the above-mentioned works, a few Persian
and European scholars have written about Shaykh Aḥmad and
the Shaykhí school. Among the Persian authors, Murtaḍá
Mudarrisí-i Chahárdehí is the leading author on the Shaykhí
topics. In addition to a book entitled Shaykhígarí,
Bábíqarí az Naẓar-i Falsafa, Táríkh va Ijtimá‘9 on the life,
personality, and principle doctrines of Shaykh Aḥmad and the
historical development of the movement, Mudarrisí has also
published a series of articles on the subject in various
Persian publications.10

Sayyid Muḥammad ‘Alí Jamál Zádeh published a series of
historical articles on the lives of the first five leaders
of the Shaykhí movement, i.e., Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í, Sayyid
Káẓim Rashtí, Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán Kermání, Ḥájj
Muḥammad Khán Kermání (d. 1324/1908), and Ḥájj Zayn al-

‘Ábidín Kermání (d. 1360/1941).11

Among the European scholars who became interested in
the Shaykhí school, Louis Alphonse Daniel Nicolas and
Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau (d. 1882) are important.
Nicolas’ work, Essai Sur Le Chékhisme,12 deals with the
life of Shaykh Aḥmad and his successor, Sayyid Kim Rashtí,
and the main doctrines of the Shaykh. Comte de Gobineau,
although he did not devote any specific work to the Shaykhís,
discussed some of their basic doctrines in the second
chapter of his Les Religions et les Philosophies dans L’Asie
Centrale.13

Edward Granville Browne (d. 1926) came across the
Shaykhís and their beliefs in the process of studying and
writing about the Báb.14 In the introduction to A Travel-
ler’s Narrative,15 he gives a short account of the life of
Shaykh Aḥmad, mentions his major works and doctrines, and
very briefly discusses the development of the school after
his death.

Henry Corbin, the contemporary scholar of Shí‘í
theology, has written L’École Shaykhie en Théologíe
Shi‘ite.16 This book provides a sketch of the life of
Shaykh Aḥmad and the succeeding Shaykhí leaders up to Abú
al-Qásim Ibráhímí (d. 1389/1969). It also contains a brief
discussion of Shaykhí doctrines.

In spite of the studies which have already been made by
scholars of the East and the West on the Shaykhí movement,
the subject has yet to be critically studied. Such a

comprehensive study must be done on the basis of the socio-
religious life and beliefs of the Persians during the Qájár
period. The magnitude of Shaykh Aḥmad’s achievements and
his intellectual contributions are so vast, and his
influence upon subsequent religious and social movements is
so profound, that any mature judgment about him and his
school must be made with utmost care and sound understanding
of the period.

The life of Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í
Shaykh Aḥmad b. Zayn al-Dín b. Ibráhím b. Ṣaqr b.

Ibráhím b. Dághir, known as Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í, was born in
Rajab 1166/175217 in the village of Muṭayrafí in the region
of Aḥsá,18 a hinterland of Baḥrayn. The clan of Shaykh
Aḥmad belonged to the bedouin tribe of al-Maḥáshír, which
had settled in Aḥsá during the lifetime of Dághir (five
generations before Shaykh Aḥmad, around the middle of the
seventeenth century). The tribe was Sunní, but Dághir and
his clan, under unknown circumstances, became Shí‘a.
Although Shaykh Aḥmad was raised in a Shí‘í family, it is
reported that the majority of his countrymen were Sunní and
that there were also Ṣúfí orders.19 Thus, from childhood
Shaykh Aḥmad was familiar with different trends of thought
in Islam, a familiarity that played an important role in his
later career. In his autobiography, Shaykh Aḥmad complains
that his people know nothing about their religious obliga-

tions and duties. They can hardly differentiate between
forbidden (ḥarám) and lawful (ḥalál).20 This irreligiosity
may have led Shaykh Aḥmad to call for a revitalization of
religious life in his society.

Information about the childhood and early education of
Shaykh Aḥmad is limited to his own statements and those of
Shaykh ‘Abd Alláh, his son. Both sources indicate that he
possessed a prodigious memory reaching back into his early
childhood. He is reported to have recalled a heavy rain in
his home town when he was only two years of age.21

The early formal education of Shaykh Aḥmad, like that
of most educated Muslims, began with reading the Qur’án,
which he could do at the age of five years.22 He then
studied the Ajurrúmíya23 and the ‘Awámil,24 two Arabic
grammar textbooks,25 with Shaykh Muḥammad b. Shaykh
Muḥsin,26
who was his formal teacher. Shaykh Aḥmad is reported to
have been acquainted in early life with Ibn Abí Jumhúr,27
the author of al-Mujlí,28 and to have received further
instruction29 from Quṭb al-Dín Muḥammad Shírází Dhahabi, who
subscribed to the doctrines of Ibn al-‘Arabí (d. 637/1239),
which he apparently was teaching in Baḥrayn. This seems to
be the first intellectual acquaintance of Shaykh Aḥmad with
the theosophy of Ibn al-‘Arabí, which later became one of
the main themes in his works.

Upon completing the elementary religious courses in his
native land, Shaykh Aḥmad went to ‘Atabát to attend the
academic circle of scholars such as Muḥammad Báqir Behbahání

(d. 1207/1792), Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdí Ṭabáṭabá’í known as
Baḥr al-‘Ulúm (d. 1212/1797), Shaykh Ja‘far Najafí known as
Káshif al-Ghiṭá (d. 1231/1815), and Mír Sayyid ‘Alí
Ṭabáṭabá’í (d. 1231/1815).30 He received ijázas from the
most distinguished scholars of his time, obtaining his first
one in 1209/1794.31 Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdí Baḥr al-‘Ulúm,
who issued this ijáza, asked Shaykh Aḥmad if he had written
a dissertation. Shaykh Aḥmad presented to him a portion of
his Sharḥ-i Tabṣira.32 Baḥr al-‘Ulúm studied it and
replied, “You are the one who ought to give me an ijáza.”33
In addition to the ijáza of Baḥr al-‘Ulúm,34 six eminent
scholars of his time issued ijázas to Shaykh Aḥmad: Ḥusayn
‘Alí ‘Uṣfúr (d. 1216/1801),35 Aḥmad Baḥrání Damistání,36
Mírzá Mahdí Shahrestání (d. 1216/1801),37 Sayyid ‘Alí
Ṭabáṭabá’í,38 Shaykh Ja‘far Najafí,39 and Ḥájj Muḥammad
Ibráhím Kalbásí (d. 1262/1846).40

Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí as well as Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán
Kermání have listed the branches of knowledge in which
Shaykh Aḥmad was considered a master,41 including, in
addition to various branches of Islamic sciences such as
rijál, fiqh, tafsír, and literature; astronomy, medicine,
geometry, mathematics, and even music. Although his literal
mastery of all these sciences is not the issue, it is
evident in his own writings that he was gifted with the
power of memory and was able to comprehend even the most
difficult theological and philosophical problems. His vast
knowledge and originality is also attested to by his

biographers42 and the religious authorities who issued him
ijázas.

Although Shaykh Aḥmad received his education from the
most learned men of his age, he was never fully satisfied
with his formal education. Dissatisfaction with the social
and religious atmosphere in which he grew up and his own
contemplative temperament led Shaykh Aḥmad to piety and
meditation.43 As a consequence of lengthy meditations and
recitation of the Qur’án, he had recurrent dreams of the
imáms. His own perception of his dream associations with
the imáms constituted the spiritual cornerstone of his life,
influencing his personality and creating in him an intense
love for the imáms. For Shaykh Aḥmad, his dreams were the
source of his knowledge and inspiration. Recalling his
childhood, he states that early in his life the gate of
dreams was opened to him by Imám Ḥasan b. ‘Alí.44 In his
first dream, an extraordinary experience for him, he
presented several questions to the imám and received answers.
It was in this first dream that the imám put his mouth on
Shaykh Aḥmad’s mouth and that Shaykh Aḥmad drank the imám’s
saliva. Shaykh Aḥmad also related that he dreamed of the
Prophet and drank of his saliva as well.45

Shaykh ‘Abd Alláh on the authority of his father
relates that the effect of such experiences on Shaykh Aḥmad
was so strong that he devoted more and more time to
meditation, prayer, and recitation of the Qur’án. It was
now possible for him to meet with any imám he wished and to

present to him any questions of difficulties that he
encountered in the understanding of the truth.46

In his autobiography, Shaykh Aḥmad does not mention the
name of any of the teachers who issued him an ijáza; rather,
he states that through his dream he met with Imám ‘Alí b.
Muḥammad Hádí and received twelve ijázas from each of the
twelve imáms.47

He made a number of pilgrimages to the shrines of the
imáms in Iran, ‘Atabát, Mecca, and Medina. In fact, he
spent the last fifty years of his life visiting these holy
cities, preaching, and teaching the multitudes of students
who attended his lectures. In the year 1186/1772, when
Shaykh Aḥmad was in his twenties, he journeyed to ‘Atabát.
The prestige of ‘Atabát as the center for higher Shí‘í
education and the absence of any scholars in his native land
led to this decision. This was the beginning of his direct
connection with the center of the Shí‘í intellectual,
cultural and academic world. His stay in ‘Atabát, although
it lasted only one year, was very fruitful for him. He was
able to obtain an ijáza from Sayyid Muḥammad Mahdí Baḥr
al-‘Ulúm which brought him fame and respect in ‘Atabát and
his native land. Apparently the typhus epidemic of the year
1186/1772 caused him to return to his native land.

Knowledge about the life of Shaykh Aḥmad between his return
in 1186/1772 and his second departure for ‘Atabát in 1212/
1797 is very limited. It is likely that during this period
Shaykh Aḥmad devoted most of his time to studying,

meditating, and writing rather than to the intellectual
challenges that would occupy him in the following decades of
his life.

When Shaykh Aḥmad was forty-six years old, the Wahhábí
attack on Aḥsá led him to emigrate to Baṣra in 1212/1797.48
This emigration was a turning point in his life: he never
returned to his homeland, but remained in Iran and ‘Atabát
to the end of his life in 1241/1825. The period 1212/1797
to 1241/1825 was the period of his fame, popularity, and
close association with the officials and religious leaders
in Iran and ‘Atabát.

The following is a brief chronology of Shaykh Aḥmad’s
travels: After he emigrated to Baṣra in 1212/1797, he went
to the small village of Dhuraq where he stayed for about
three years. He returned to Baṣra and went to Ḥabarát, a
village near Baṣra, returning to Baṣra and proceeding to the
village of Tanwíyh and then to Nashwah, where he stayed for
eighteen months. In 1219/1804 he moved to Ṣafawah and
stayed there for a year. He returned then to Baṣra, and in
1221/1806 he went to Najaf, Káẓimayn, and then to Iran. The
period between 1222/1807 and 1229/1813 was mostly spent in
Yazd. During this time he paid three visits to the shrine
of Imám Riḍá in Mashhad and made a trip to Tehrán to visit
Fatḥ ‘Alí Sháh. He left Yazd in 1229/1813 for Iṣfahán and
then continued his journey to Kermánsháh, arriving there in
Rajab 1229/1813. He departed from Kermánsháh for Mecca in
1232/1816 and after his pilgrimage returned to ‘Atabát,

where he stayed for about eight months; he then moved back
to Kermánsháh in Muḥarram 1234/1818. This time he stayed in
Kermánsháh for a few years until he left for another visit
to the shrine of Imám Riḍá and went to Mashhad via Qazvín,
Qom, Tehrán, Sháhrood, and Nishábor. After twenty-two days
in Mashhad he continued his journey to Yazd via Torbat and
Ṭabas. Shaykh Aḥmad was in Yazd for only three months when
he was ordered by Imám ‘Alí, in one of his dreams, to go to
‘Atabát.49 Consequently he left Yazd and went to Kermánsháh
via Iṣfahán, where he stayed about forty days.50 After
staying in Kermánsháh for one year, he departed for ‘Atabát
and Mecca. Shaykh Aḥmad died in Hadíya, about two stages
from Medina, on 21 Dhí al-Qa‘da 1241/182551 at the age of
seventy-five and was buried in the cemetery of Baqí‘ in
Medina.

According to Shaykh ‘Abd Alláh, Shaykh Aḥmad married
eight women and had twenty-nine children: eighteen boys and
eleven girls.52 Only seven of his children survived and
reached maturity. Among his sons, three are themselves
distinguished: Shaykh ‘Abd Alláh, who wrote the treatise on
the life of his father; Shaykh Muḥammad Taqí, for whom
Shaykh Aḥmad wrote his autobiography; and Shaykh ‘Ali or
‘Alí Naqí, who was ideologically in disagreement with his
father. From an intellectual point of view, Shaykh ‘Alí was
the most learned of Shaykh Aḥmad’s sons.53

After the death of Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í, his disciple,
follower, and very close companion Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí

became the leader of the school. (The life and works of
Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí will be discussed in a separate chapter.)
The spiritual and intellectual ties between Shaykh Aḥmad and
Sayyid Káẓim, and the Shaykh’s trust and confidence in
Sayyid Káẓim, were so obvious to Shaykh Aḥmad’s followers
that, without any appointment, all of them regarded Sayyid
Káẓim as Shaykh Aḥmad’s only possible successor and recog-
nized him as the most authentic interpreter of Shaykh
Aḥmad’s doctrines. Consequently, for Shaykhí doctrines, the
works of Sayyid Káẓim are as fundamental as the works of
Shaykh Aḥmad himself.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s learning and piety brought him fame,
respect, popularity, and influence. He was welcomed by
governors, officials, religious leaders, and the masses
wherever he traveled. In Yazd, he received letters of
invitation from Fatḥ ‘Alí Sháh, who had expressed his wish
to visit with him personaily.54 Shaykh Aḥmad responded
positively and went to Tehrán, where he was warmly received
by the Sháh and his court. He was invited to make his
residence in Tehrán, but Shaykh Aḥmad found the invitation
incompatible with the piety and simplicity of his life, and
soon left the capital.

It is reported that the governor of Kermánsháh,
Muḥammad ‘Alí Mírzá, known as Rukn al-Dawla, felt so honored
that he went four-farsakhs (about 13.5 miles) out of the city
to welcome Shaykh Aḥmad to Kermánsháh.55 The same kind of
respect and hospitality was also paid Shaykh Aḥmad by the

governors of Torbat and Ṭabas.56 In Iṣfahán, Ṣadr al-Dawla
is said to have presented the village of Kamál Ábád to
Shaykh Aḥmad.57

Toward the end of his life, his widespread popularity
and fame as well as his doctrinal stand, which some of the
‘ulamá regarded as heresy, brought him the bitter experience
of being denounced as a heretic—takfír. During his stay in
Qazvín, about the year 1239 or 40/1824, Shaykh Aḥmad met
with the ‘ulamá of the city, including Mullá Muḥammad Taqí
Baraghání (d. 1264/1847), the famous and influential
religious leader of the city. In one of their meetings,
Baraghání raised some theological questions and asked
Shaykh Aḥmad to explain his views. After hearing Shaykh
Aḥmad’s views, Baraghání stated that Shaykh Aḥmad’s answers
were not in accordance with the universally accepted beliefs
of the Shí‘a and declared Shaykh Aḥmad a heretic.58
Baraghání’s opposition was the first and most important
opposition Shaykh Aḥmad encountered.

Baraghání’s opposition was the beginning of serious
intellectual as well as physical conflicts which extended to
‘Atabát during the time of Sayyid Káẓim and resulted in a
distinction between the followers of the Shaykhí school and
the rest of the Shí‘í community. Although it is not clear
when the appelation of “Shaykhí” was first applied to the
followers of Shaykh Aḥmad, it seems that the takfír of
Qazvín contributed to the distinct identity of the; followers
of Shaykh Aḥmad, and the Shí‘a gave them the title in order

to differentiate them from the Shí‘a. The term Shaykhí was
used in contrast with the Mutasharri‘ín which, in this case,
stands for the Shí‘a.59

The Shaykhís were also given the title of “Posht-i
Sarís” (literally, “behind the head”). When he visited the
shrine of an imám, it was Shaykh Aḥmad’s custom, as a matter
of respect and politeness, to stand at the foot of the grave
and not circumambulate it. This practice was adopted by his
followers and came to distinguish them from other Shí‘a who,
because they circumambulated the graves of the imáms were
called “Bálá Sarís” (literally, “above the head”).60

The Shaykhís are also known as Kashfíya. Sayyid Káẓim
explains that they were given this name because God lifted
(kashf) from their intellect and from their vision the veil
of ignorance and lack of insight into the Religion, and
removed the darkness of doubt and uncertainty from their
minds and their hearts. They are the ones whose hearts God
illumined with the light of guidance.61

Although the terms “Shaykhí”, “Posht-i Sarí”, and
“Kashfíya” refer to a certain group of people, and were
intended to distinguish them from the rest of Shí‘a, the
group solidarity and identity of the Shaykhís was in fact
not so distinct as to sharply separate them from the rest of
the Shí‘í community of Iran as an independent sect or even
branch of Twelver Shí‘a. The Shaykhís considered themselves
true Shí‘a who thought and behaved in accordance with the
teaching of the Shí‘í imáms; they did not consider them-

selves innovators.

It is difficult to believe that during Shaykh Aḥmad’s
lifetime he was considered the founder of a new school of
thought within the Shí‘í framework. However, as time went
on and the nature of his ideology received greater intellec-
tual attention, a group of fundamentalist ‘ulamá perceived a
radical distinction between his views and the established
doctrines of the Shí‘a and increasingly differentiated
themselves from the Shaykhís. The Shaykhí school, then,
gained more group solidarity as it developed historically,
reacting as a group against the main body of the Shí‘a when
it encountered social and intellectual opposition.

Shaykh Aḥmad states that his views were based on
understanding and knowledge derived, in dreams, from
communications with the imáms; that he received the Truth
from them; and that whatever he learned was in accordance
with the Traditions of the imáms.62 He acknowledges himself
to be in opposition to the leading philosophers (ḥukamá) and
theologians (mutakallimín) on most theological questions,
however, he asserts that his doctrinal positions are rooted
in, and fundamentally in accordance with, the Traditions
which derive this authority from the imáms. Shaykh Aḥmad
believed that it was impossible to name a Tradition that was
against his own sayings. Therefore, since the majority of
the philosophers’ and theologians’ views were in disagree-
ment with the views of Shaykh Aḥmad, they were consequently
in disagreement with the Traditions of the imáms. He goes

on to say that the majority of the theologians and philoso-
phers do not know the true meaning of the sayings of the
imáms, which they interpret in a way contrary to the intent
of the imáms.63 Although he asserts that the main source of
his knowledge and understanding is his dreams, he endeavors
to base his understanding in the Qur’án and the Traditions.64
The combination of these two sources is supported by
personal reasoning.

To clarify Shaykh Aḥmad’s approach, Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí,
in the Dalíl al-Mutaḥayyirín, states that the source of
Shaykh Aḥmad’s knowledge was not only his dreams, but the
Qur’án, Sunna, and Traditions of the imáms as well. In
addition to these sources, Shaykh Aḥmad used his intellect
and personal reasoning. Sayyid Káẓim points out that Shaykh
Aḥmad has applied both the external reasoning and its
internal meaning.65 To distinguish between the Shaykhís and
the philosophers, Sayyid Káẓim states that philosophers use
the intellect (reasoning) in discussing theological problems,
whether or not the result is in accordance with the Sharí‘a.
In contrast, we (the Shaykhís), he states, are not among
those who rely only upon intellect. We consider the
intellect as one tool, then we consider the clear (muḥkamát)
verses of the Qur’án if they are in agreement with our
rational reasoning. Then we consider the Traditions, that
is, only the musallam (indisputable), mashhúr (well-known,
evident) and ghayr mutashábíh (unambiguous) Traditions, and
not all of the Traditions, if they are in agreement with

rational reasoning and the Book. Then we consider the
Madhhab,66 if it is in agreement with the three others.
Then we consider the law of the universe (al-áyát al-murattaba fi
al-
áfáq wa al-anfus)67 as the fifth tool to reach to the Truth.68

Sayyid Káẓim believes that while reason alone is
insufficient for establishing any regulation, if the content
of a weak Tradition, weak either because of its text or its
chain of narrators, is not in contradiction with the Book,
Sunna, and Ijmá‘, then reasoning can be the arbiter of the
validity of such a Tradition.69

Regarding the validity of Traditions, Sayyid Káẓim
believes that there are two kinds of mutawátir70 (successive)
Traditions: al-mutawátirát al-ma‘nawíya (spiritually
successive; that is, relating to the sense of import of a
Tradition as opposed to literal Traditions) and al-
mutawátirát al-lafẓíya (literally successive). The
spiritually successive Traditions are undoubtedly reliable,
but the literally successive Traditions, although on the
authority of the imáms, are not reliable because of the
possibility that the imám had practiced dissimulation
(taqíya)71 for himself or for his community.72

From the Shaykhí point of view, the Uṣúlís’ approach
towards jurisprudential problems is justified. According to
Sayyid Káẓim, the Book, Sunna, Ijmá‘, and Reasoning (or
Book, Ḥadíth, Sunna, and Reasoninq)73 are the legislative
sources.74 But the Shaykhís, unlike the Akhbárís, do not

believe that the whole body of Traditions are substantially
valid. Traditions, however, are undoubtedly valid as
secondary support.75

On the basis of these established methods for reaching the
Truth, it is evident that Shaykh Aḥmad was neither an
Akhbárí nor an Uṣúlí, although he made use of the methods of
the two groups. Shírvání rightly points out that Shaykh
Aḥmad was an ‘árif (gnostic, saint) among the ‘ulamá and an
‘álim among the ‘urafá.76

Sayyid Káẓim appreciates the approach of those Shí‘í
‘ulamá through the centuries who were not merely concerned
with the superficial aspects of law, but were illumined by
an inspiration which came to them through their piety.
Sayyid Káẓim gives the names of some of them: Muḥammad b.
Muḥammad b. Nu‘mán Shaykh al-Mufíd (d. 413/1022),
Muḥammad
b. Ḥasan al-Ṭosí (d. 460/1067), Ḥasan b. Sadíd al-Dín
‘Alláma al-Ḥillí (d. 726/1325), Muḥammad b. Makkí (known as
Shahíd al-Thání) (d. 966/1558), and Aḥmad b. Muḥammad
Muqaddas al-Ardabílí (d. 993/1585).77

Sayyid Káẓim regards his teacher, Shaykh Aḥmad, as the
man who exposed the innovations of the Ṣúfís and pointed out
the misunderstandings of the theologians. Sayyid Káẓim
believes that Shaykh Aḥmad followed in the path of the
Prophet and glorified the significance of the station of the
imáms.78

For Sayyid Kázim, the ‘ulamá are the deputies of the
imáms among the people and, in the absence of the Ḥujjat

(Proof, i.e., the Hidden Imám), the interpreters of the word
of God. People are divided into two groups: the muqallids
(imitators) and the mujtahids (leaders, strivers),79 but
ijtihád is not an absolute necessity for the community
because it is against the Traditions of the imáms, and the
text of the Qur’án does not indicate the necessity of such
an institution. He says that much knowledge is required to
reach the rank of ijtihád and that very few people have
achieved it.80

The works of Shaykh Aḥmad
In nearly fifty years of scholarly activity, Shaykh
Aḥmad produced an extensive body of works devoted to
questions in all areas of Islamic studies. Indeed, he was
one of the most prolific authors of his time. The study of
his works, his approach, his sources, the influence upon him
of his predecessors, and his intellectual contribution to
Islamic thought in general and to the religious attitude of
the Persians in particular, is an enormous task which is yet
to be undertaken.

Abú al-Qásim Ibráhímí, the sixth leader of the school,
devoted the second volume of the Fihrist to the works of
Shaykh Aḥmad and other leaders of the Shaykhí school. In
the first chapter of this volume he provides information on
the length, place, and date of publication, number of
chapters, and the name of the questioner for each work. He

describes 132 works81 but does not comment on their quality.

In the introduction to this volume, Ibráhímí gives the
sources of information. He mentions four lists,82 which are:
1\. A list arranged by Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí with a short

> description of each work. Some of the works mentioned in
> this list are not extant.
2\. A lengthy list of the works of Shaykh Aḥmad and

> other leaders of the Shaykhí school prepared by ‘Abd al-
> Majíd Fá’iqí and including the number of lines, the questions,
> and brief answers given to the questions posed in each work.
3\. A short list of the works of the first four leaders

> of the school, provided by an unknown author, which is used
> as the foundation for the information in the Fihrist.
4\. A list of the works of the Shaykh prepared by

> Muḥammad Ṭáhír Khán, the author of a treatise on the life of
> Shaykh Aḥmad. Bibliographical information in this treatise
> is basically derived from the list of Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí.

Ibráhímí has used these four lists as primary sources
for his list of Shaykh Aḥmad’s works in the Fihrist.
Therefore, the Fihrist contains the most comprehensive list
of the works of Shaykh Aḥmad, although it does not go beyond
providing bibliographical information on each work.

In addition to the four sources given above and the
Fihrist, the booklet Fihrist Taṣáníf al-‘Alláma al-Shaykh
Aḥmad al-Aḥsá’í, by Riyáḍ Ṭáhir,83 contains a brief
biography of Shaykh Aḥmad followed by a list of 104 of his
works, as well as references to the location of some of

Shaykh Aḥmad’s manuscripts in the libraries of Iraq and
Tehrán University.

The author of the Fihrist has categorized the 132 works of
Shaykh Aḥmad into nine chapters according to the main
subject of the work:
1\.   Works on divine theology and virtues
2\.   Works on doctrines and refutation of his opponents’ views
3\.   Preaching and mysticism
4\.   Works on principles of fiqh
5\.   Works on fiqh
6\.   Commentaries on the Qur’án and Traditions
7\.   Works on philosophy and practical wisdom
8\.   Works on literature
9\.   Other works84

A glance at Shaykh Aḥmad’s works shows that the
majority were written in response to the religious,
theological, and philosophical questions of his students,
followers, other scholars, rulers, and other individuals
whose identity is not known. These works of reply usually
have as titles the name of the questioner. Thus the work
entitled Rísála-i Baḥráníya was composed in response to the
questions of Sayyid Ḥusayn b. Sayyid ‘Abd al-Qádir Baḥrání.
In such work, Shaykh Aḥmad answered varied questions in
different fields of Islamic sciences. Some questioners
asked him up to seventy different questions. As a result,
very rarely is a work devoted to one specific subject.

Since often people asked him the same question, it is not
unusual to encounter the same response in several works.

Shaykh Aḥmad also wrote commentaries, and it was for
this that he became best known. Although he did not write a
commentary on the entire Qur’án, he did write them on a
number of Quranic verses. He also wrote commentaries on
several Traditions attributed to the Prophet and the imáms.
Of the latter, the Sharḥ al-Ziyára is the most important.

Shaykh Aḥmad was the leading nineteenth century
religious commentator on the works of Mullá Ṣadrá (d. 1050/
1640), his commentaries on the Mashá‘ir and the ‘Arshíya
being of special importance. Shaykh Aḥmad also wrote
commentaries on the Risála-i ‘Ilmíya of Mullá Muḥsin Fayḍ
(d. 1091/1680) and the Tabṣirat al-Muta‘allimín of Ḥasan b.
Sadíd al-Dín ‘Alláma al-Ḥillí (d. 726/1325). Shaykh Aḥmad
also wrote commentaries on some of his own earlier works:
for example, his Sharḥ-i Fawá’id was a commentary on his
earlier work, the Fawá’id.

The majority of Shaykh Aḥmad’s works are undated; of
those works which do bear a date, is not clear whether the
date refers to the work’s composition or its copying at a
later time. Furthermore, the place of composition is
usually not stated. Therefore, a chronological arrangement
of his works, which could have shed light on his life and
the development of his ideas, is impossible. The earliest
date on a work of Shaykh Aḥmad’s is 1197/1782. Written at
the request of Shaykh Músá b. Muḥammad Ṣá’igh, this work is

a short treatise of twenty-six lines on the birth and advent
of the expected Qá’im, in curious language.85 The last
dated work of Shaykh Aḥmad is a treatise dated 8 Sha‘bán
1239/1823, which responds to the questions of Shaykh Ya‘qúb
b. Ḥájj Qásim Shírvání and in which Shaykh Aḥmad elaborated
previous statements on matter and form.86

The language of Shaykh Aḥmad is complicated by
technical terms, allegorical expressions, and extensive
gnostic terminology. This was probably one reason why
Shaykh Aḥmad himself, his successors, and many others after
them found it necessary to write explanations on his works.

Shaykh Aḥmad wrote some works for the intellectual
elite (khawáṣṣ), and others for laymen. Those works which
he wrote for the elite have a rather allegorical and
ambiguous tone, whereas those he wrote for a general
audience are more straightforward and, in content, closer to
common beliefs. Therefore, since the tone of each of Shaykh
Aḥmad’s works depended upon the audience for which the work
was intended, a great deal of familiarity with the circum-
stances under which a work was written is required in order
to come to a solid and mature understanding of his doctrines.

The extensive number of Shaykh Aḥmad’s works does not
permit providing a sketch of each work here. The topics he
discusses are also too numerous to fully list. Hence, only
a cursive examination of his works which incorporate the
distinguishing features of his thought is attempted.

Sharḥ al-Ziyárat al-Jámi‘a

This work is a commentary on the Ziyárat al-Jami‘a
written at the request of Sayyid Ḥasan b. Sayyid Qásim al-
Ḥusayní al-Ishkavarí al-Jílání in 1230/1814. The Ziyárat
al-Jámi‘a is a prayer of visitation of the holy shrines of
the imáms, related on the authority of Imám ‘Alí b.
Muḥammad Naqí (the Tenth Imám, known as Imám al-Hádí)
(d. 254/868) and is recorded by Ibn Bábawayh (Shaykh Ṣadúq)87
and Shaykh Abú Ja‘far Muḥammad b. al-Ḥasan al-Ṭosí.88 The
prayer is well known among the Shí‘a, and several Shí‘í
scholars have written commentaries on it.89

In the Sharḥ al-Ziyára, Shaykh Aḥmad quotes the text of
the prayer phrase by phrase, gives the meaning of each
phrase, and then discusses its theological and religious
aspects.

Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí began a commentary on the Sharḥ al-
Ziyára, but as he himself states, he realized that he was
unqualified for the task and therefore left his commentary
unfinished.90 Sayyid Káẓim states that Shaykh Aḥmad was
inspired and directed by the imáms while he wrote the Sharḥ.
According to Sayyid Káẓim, Shaykh Aḥmad revealed some of the
secret and esoteric nature of the prayer and brought to-
gether in this work the ẓáhir (external), i.e., sharí‘a
(religion) and the báṭin (internal), i.e., ḥaqíqa (reality).91
An unpublished abridgment of this book was made by Mír
Muḥammad Ḥusayn Ḥá’irí Shahrestání (d. 1315/1897), entitled
Talwíḥ al-Ishára fí Talkhís Sharḥ al-Ziyára.92

The Sharḥ al-Ziyára of Shaykh Aḥmad is a collection of
the most important theological problems in Shí‘í thought.
The “Ziyára” itself is a master work in expressing the
status of the imáms and Shaykh Aḥmad explains its status as
such. The Sharḥ al-Ziyára was published in 1267/1850 and in
1276/1859 in lithography in Tabríz.
Sharḥ Tabṣira

One of the earliest of Shaykh Aḥmad’s works, this
commentary on the Tabṣirat al-Muta‘allimín fí Aḥkám al-Dín,
a well-known work of fiqh by ‘Alláma al-Ḥillí,93 is the
treatise Shaykh Aḥmad presented to Baḥr al-‘Ulúm and for
which he received his first ijáza.94
Sharḥ ‘ala al-Risálat al-‘Ilmíya

The Risálat al-‘Ilm is a theological treatise by Fayḍ
Káshání, on the knowledge of God. Shaykh Aḥmad wrote a
commentary on this work at the request of Mírzá Báqir
Nawwáb95 in Kermánsháh in 1230/1814.96 This Sharḥ was
published in the Jawámi‘ al-Kilam.97
Sharḥ al-Mashá‘ir

Al-Mashá‘ir is a work of Mullá Ṣadrá. Shaykh Aḥmad
wrote a commentary on this work at the request of Mullá
Mashhad b. Mullá Ḥusayn ‘Alí Shabestarí. This work deals
with the philosophical question of the essence of Being.
The Sharḥ al-Mashá‘ir was written in 1234/1818.98

Sharḥ al-‘Arshíya

Al-‘Arshíya is another work by Mullá Ṣadrá. Shaykh
Aḥmad wrote a commentary on it in Kermánsháh at the request
of Mullá Mashhad b. Mullá Ḥusayn ‘Alí Shabestarí.99 The
commentary consists of two volumes; the first, written in
1234/1818, regarding mabda’ (God) and the second, written in
1236/1820, regarding the ma‘ád (return). The Sharḥ al-
‘Arshíya was published in 1271/1854 and 1279/1862.
Fawá’id

This general theological work, which Shaykh Aḥmad wrote
in Yazd in 1211/1796,100 deals mainly with three Beings:
Being of God (wujúd al-ḥaqq), Being of Unlimited (wujúd al-
muṭlaq), and Being of Limited (wujúd al-muqayyad). The
Fawá’id consists of twelve Fá’ida. In 1233/1817, at the
request of Mullá Mashhad b. Ḥusayn ‘Alí, Shaykh Aḥmad wrote
a commentary on this work entitled the Sharḥ al-Fawá’id. In
the Sharh al-Fawá’id, Shaykh Aḥmad defines the terms he has
used in the Fawá’id. The book was published in 1272/1855
and 1287/1870. In the Sharḥ al-Fawá’id, seven Fá’ida are
added to the twelve Fá’ida of the original work.

In addition, two of Shaykh Aḥmad’s students have
written commentaries on the Fawá’id. Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥusayn
Semnání, who wrote his commentary in 1233/1817; and Shaykh
Mullá Káẓim Semnání. Both commentaries exist only in
manuscript form.101

Ḥayát al-Nafs

This book was written on the five principles of Islamic
belief, i.e., tawḥíd (oneness of God), ‘adl (justice),
nubuwwat (prophethood), imámat (imamate), and ma‘ád (return).
The book’s epilogue concerns the necessity of belief in the
advent of the promised Qá’im. The work was written in 1236/
1820102 and published in the Jawámi‘ al-Kilam in 1273/1856.
This work was translated into Persian by Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí.

III
The basic Shaykhí ontological doctrines
The ontological doctrines of Shaykh Aḥmad constitute
the most important link between the Shaykhí school and the
mainstream of Islamic thought. In these views he relates
his thought to Shí‘a and challenges Sunní and Ṣúfí positions.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s ontological doctrines do not constitute
any new system of ontological thought, nor did the Shaykh
himself ever claim to have produced such a system. The
importance of Shaykh Aḥmad, however, lies in the emphasis he
placed on certain theological doctrines and the new frame-
work into which he put them. It lies also in the doubt that
he cast upon some of the well-accepted doctrines of the
Muslim philosophers and the Ṣúfís.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s primary purpose was to purify Islamic
thought from the intellectual innovations of those Muslim
scholars who neglect the imáms’ teachings and rely upon
their own understanding. Although a Shí‘a himself, his
attitude toward the purification of Islam was not limited to
Shí‘í innovation.

His standard for understanding the Truth was the Qur’án
and the Shí‘í Traditions, and he considered himself the
interpreter of the Truth as revealed in these works. Thus
he severely criticized the religious scholars who had not
sought the truth from infallible sources, i.e., the imáms,
whom God made the guardian for His people. Shaykh Aḥmad,

who regarded himself as a revealer of the truth, asked his
audience to disregard those innovated thoughts that may
divert one from the right path and urged them to heed his
words, in which the truth is expressed, and to seek the
truth with their own understanding and judgment instead of
imitating others. The understanding and judgment to which
the Shaykh refers is based on intellectual reasoning as well
as intuition. A man can comprehend the truth from the
sayings of the imáms if he detaches himself from innovated
thoughts and refers to the genuine source of inspiration and
intellectual reasoning.1

The two primary sources for the Shaykh ontological
doctrines are (1) the commentaries Shaykh Aḥmad himself
wrote on certain Quranic verses and Shí‘í Traditions, and
those theological and philosophical treatises he wrote at
the request of individuals; and (2) the works Sayyid Káẓim
Rashtí wrote to elaborate Shaykh Aḥmad’s doctrines, works
equally important for Shaykhí ontology.2

This chapter will focus on ontological questions that
have been given prominence in Shaykh works, with attention
given only to aspects of these questions which are
particularly important for Shaykh Aḥmad and which differen-
tiate his school from others.

A fundamental question that has always occupied
scholars of Islamic theology is the nature of God, His
attributes, and His relationship with material being. The
same question is a central concern in all the Shaykh’s

doctrines. According to the Qur’án, basic Islamic doctrine
holds that God is eternal, single since eternity, and
incomprehensible. Among these attributes, the absolute
impossibility of comprehending the essence (dhát) of God, as
the most important ontological principle, has received great
emphasis in the works of the Shaykhís. On the impossibility
of knowing God’s essence, Sayyid Káẓim says that knowledge
can exist only when there is a similarity between the known
and the knower. Thus, the essence of God can not be known
because no similarity exists between God and the knower,
i.e., man: God is eternal (qadím) and man is “accident”
(ḥádith), and there is absolutely no similarity between
eternal and accident.3

There is no doubt that as long as there is no
correlation (munásabat) or similarity (mushábahat) between
two things, one can not cite an example from it. Thus, one
can not say that water is a thing like (mithál) fire or heat
is a thing like cold or wind is a thing like earth, and so
on. If correlation were not a condition of citing an
example, one could cite an example between any two things,
but this obviously can not be done, as above examples show.
In the case of God, there exists nothing in the material
world similar to God; therefore, one can not describe Him by
citing an example from the material world or know Him
through likeness. Possible Being is only able to understand
a subject within the realm of the Possible and is not able
to understand anything beyond it, i.e., the Necessary Being.4

Thus, if Possible Being wants to cite an example from the
Necessary Being, it needs two things; first, it needs to
comprehend the Essence of the Necessary Being, to know
whether the example is His example or not. Second, it needs
to cite the example by using phenomena from Possible Being,
because it was proved that the Necessary Being is one and
there must exist a correlation between one object (mithl)
and the object to which it is being compared (mumathal),
otherwise it is not its likeness (mithál). In order to cite
an example from God, resemblance (mithl) and likeness to Him
is necessary, and this is in contradiction with the belief
that there is no likeness (shabíh), comparison (naẓír), or
resemblance (mithl) for God, because the Qur’án says,
“Nothing is like a likeness of Him; and He is the Hearing,
the Seeing.” (42:11) And also it reads, “Therefore do not
give a likeness to Allah; surely Allah knows and you do not
know.” (16:74) Thus, such terms as “resemblance”, “related-
ness”, “equivalent”, “corresponding”, “parallel”, and so on,
only define Possible Being and cannot refer to the Necessary
Being.

Furthermore, in order to know something, the knower is
required to be superior (iḥáṭa) over the subject that is to
be known. The subject, in this case God, cannot be
comprehended as the Qur’án says, He [God] knows what is
before them and what is behind them, and they cannot
comprehend anything out of His knowledge.” (2:255) And
also, “Nay: they reject that of which they have no

comprehensive knowledge.” (10:39) And, “Vision comprehends
Him not, and He comprehends (all) vision; and He is the
Knower of subtilities, the Aware.” (6:104) These verses
indicate that nothing, neither inspired knowledge (ḥuḍúrí)
nor imagination (taṣawwur), is able to comprehend Him. One
only comprehends those subjects within the limitations of
one’s comprehension, and even those are not necessarily
what exists in reality. For example, if one sees the
reflection of a star in the water, one is not seeing the
true star, but rather the image (ṣúrat) and the example
(mithál) of the star, which is nothing but water. Therefore,
whatever Possible Being comprehends is only Possible Being
and nothing beyond that, i.e., Necessary Being. This
attitude is based on Traditions such as the one on the
authority of Imám Riḍá which reads, “One does not know God
if he points out a similarity between Him and His creation;
and one does not understand His oneness but puts up a
companion to God if he believes that he has comprehended His
very Essence; and one does not reach His recognition, who
holds up a likeness (mithál) for Him and puts up a
resemblance (mithl) for Him; and one does not believe in His
Diety, who maintains infinity for Him; and one does not
eliminate anthropomorphism for Him who has pointed at
Him. … Whatever one comprehends is the creation of his
own comprehension (and not what exists out of him in
reality).”5

Not only can man not comprehend God, but neither can

the prophets of God, who are more excellent than man. The
Prophet Muḥammad, who, according to Sayyid Káẓim was more
excellent than the other prophets, says, “We did not
comprehend You as You deserve to be comprehended” (má
‘arafnáka ḥaqqa ma‘rifatika).6

Just as man cannot comprehend the Essence of Necessary
Being, he cannot properly speak about Him, since, in order
to do so, he must comprehend Him. Speech is the external
expression of intellect or imagination, and, since neither
intellect nor imagination is able to comprehend God,
speaking about His Essence, as It is, is impossible. A
Tradition on the authority of Imám Báqir states, “Speak
about anything but do not speak about God. Speaking about
God does nothing but increase the speaker’s perplexity.”7

The attributes of God are of two kinds: essential
(dhátíya) attributes, which have no connection with
contingencies, and actional (fi‘líya or imkání or muḥdath)
attributes.8 Perfect belief in the oneness of God requires
one to regard the essential attributes as identical with the
essence of God. There is absolutely no separation between
His essence and, for example, His knowledge (‘ilm), which is
an essential attribute. Knowledge is His essence and
essence is His knowledge, without distinction. In this
respect, we neither know what His knowledge is (as we do not
know what His essence is), nor how He knows. Since the
essential attributes such as knowledge, power (qudrat),
hearing (sam‘) and vision (baṣar), cannot be separated from

Him, God cannot be attributed with their opposites, i.e.,
ignorance (jahl), weakness (‘ajz), and so on.

Essential attributes are pre-existent, i.e., they have
existed as long as the essence of God has existed; however,
this does not imply that essential attributes may be
considered as separate from essence.

There exists no distinction between essential attri-
butes: knowledge is identical with power and power is His
knowledge without distinction.9 Since the essence of God is
unknowable, His essential attributes, which are identical
with His essence, are also unknowable.

The second kind of attributes are actional attributes,
which are quite different from essential attributes.
Actional attributes come into being when God acts in the
realm of Possible Being, or as long as His actions are
regarded in Possible Being. To clarify the nature of the
actional attributes, Shaykh Aḥmad gives the following
example: when a man writes, as a result of the action of
writing we learn that he is a scribe and we can describe him
as such. If the same man sews a garment, through his action
of sewing we discover that he is a tailor and can describe
him as such. The attributes, i.e., scribe and tailor, are
not part of his essence, but rather his essence is single
and not composed of the elements of being a tailor and a
scribe. The man who performs these functions is perfect
enough (capable) to perform them. This does not indicate
that he is made up of these functions. There exists only

one single essence, i.e., the man, who acts as a tailor or
as a scribe. The multiple aspects of this essence appear as
soon as he acts. Before his actions took place, he was a
single essence, and after he acted, his essence was still
single and unchanged. Likewise the multiplicity of God’s
attributes is conceivable only when His actions are viewed
in Possible Being.10

In contrast to essential attributes, actional attri-
butes are new (ḥádith) and created (makhlúq). Will
(mashí’a), decree (iráda), and speech (kalám), in the
Shaykh’s view, are actional attributes and, therefore, are
new and created.11 God can be attributed with the actional
attributes, or, in contrast to essential attributes, with
their opposites. For example, God may will or may not will.

Since there is no similarity between the Necessary
Being and Possible Being, none of the qualities and
attributes applied to Possible Being are applicable to the
Necessary Being, and none of the qualities and attributes of
the Necessary Being are applicable to Possible Being. In
other words, the attributes of Possible Being do not exist
in the Necessary Being, and vice versa. Therefore, man’s
knowledge, power, and life is not like God’s knowledge,
power, and life. Man’s knowledge, power, and life, or man’s
concept of them, are conditioned by the limitations of
Possible Being and are not similar to the knowledge, power,
and life that God possesses. God has knowledge, power, and
life, but one whose intellect is limited by the conditions

of Possible Being is not able to comprehend them. God is
powerful and all-knowing; if He were not, it would have been
necessary for Him to be imperfect and this is not possible
for God.

We attribute to God the qualities we think a perfect
being should possess. These attributes, however, are signs
of perfection only to us. This does not mean that He
actually possesses them, because we know nothing about His
essence. In fact, by assigning God certain attributes we
imply the absence of their opposites and do not prove these
attributes to Him.

God is known to Possible Being only through His actions
and works, but because they are conditioned by the limita-
tions of Possible Being, they do not define His essence.
Even God’s description of Himself, since it is intended to
be understood by man, has been expressed within the
limitation of Possible Being and is not a description of
what He really is.12

The Qur’án and Traditions tell us that the purpose of
existence is to know and worship God.13 But Shaykh Aḥmad
believes that man cannot know God. He resolves this
apparent contradiction by suggesting that man is created to
know God only through His actions (af‘ál) and works (áthár),
not to know His essence, which is beyond man’s intellectual
comprehension. God created all things by means of His
action, not His essence. The action of God, which is
identical with His will (mashí’a) and decree (iráda},

creates the creation from absolute nothingness. Shaykh
Aḥmad refers to a Tradition on the authority of Imám Riḍá
which states that the terms mashí’a, iráda, and ibdá‘ are
synonymous.14

Since Shaykh Aḥmad denies any relationship between the
Necessary Being and Possible Being, he must explain how
Possible Being came into existence, and the nature of the
relationship between the eternal (qadím) and the new
(ḥádith). Shaykh Aḥmad accepts the view that only a single
being can issue from the essence of God, which is single.
Consequently, the Single Being (God) issues forth His single
will by itself, as an act and not as a part of His essence.
The will, which is the first creation of God, is called
God’s possible will (al-mashí’at al-imkáníya). From it,
Possible Being comes into existence. This view is found in
a Tradition an the authority of Imám Ṣádiq, which reads,
“God created the will by itself, and then the will created
things” (khalaqa Alláhu al-mashí’ata bi nafsihá thumma
khalaqa al-ashyá’a bi al-mashi’a).15 On the basis of this
Tradition, Shaykh Aḥmad explains that the will is a
“creative movement” (al-ḥarakat al-íjádíya)16 which,
although created (muḥdath), depends upon nothing except
itself. Thus, when we say that God created the will by
itself, we mean that the will is a single thing by itself
and in its essence, i.e., the will is not “a” thing and its
“self” something else; rather, the will is the simplest
thing in the realm of Possible Being. Shaykh Aḥmad has

called the simplicity of the will the “possible simplicity”
(al-bisáṭat al-imkáníya) to differentiate it from the
simplicity of God.17

The will is at the highest level of the hierarchy of
Possible Being and has produced everything below it; the
will was the first being, preceding all else in the realm of
Possible Being. The will is eternal (sarmad) and God has
created (aḥdatha) the possibilities (imkánát) of things from
it in a general, infinitive sense (‘alá wajhin kullin lá
yatanáhí) in the Possible Being.18

Shaykh Aḥmad states that the possible (imkán) is the
source (mansha’ or aṣl) of the existent (wujúd or akwán).19
As an adjective depends upon the noun it qualifies,
existence depends upon the possible. The relationship
between the possible and the existent, in a more tangible
example, is like the relationship between sperm and a man.20

When we say that things exist in the possible realm we
mean that they exist collectively, and not individually, in
the will. It is the will which produces the individuality
of things and issues them into Possible Being one after
another. We need to think in this way because God is not
affected by time; therefore past, present, and future are
identical to Him, even though from the Possible Being point
of view, the action is past or is yet to occur. If this
were not so, God would be in the position of “waiting”
(muntaẓira),21 which, as a deficiency, would be inconsistent
with His perfection.

From the fact that to God, every thing is in the
present we do not mean that things are eternal, for only the
essence of God is eternal. We mean, rather, that things
receive their existence as soon as they are created. For
example, Adam was created at one time and Zayd at another.
Both times are in the present to God, each one in its own
turn. We exist here and now: before this moment we had no
existence. Likewise, Adam existed at his time and Zayd at
his time, but, to God all of these times and places are in
the present.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s doctrines on God and His attributes,
particularly God’s knowledge, put him in serious disagree-
ment with the Ṣúfís, such as Ibn al-‘Arabí (d. 638/1240);
theologians, such as Mullá Muḥsin Fayḍ Káshání (d. 1091/
1680); and philosophers, such as Mullá Ṣadrá (d. 1050/1640).
While a detailed study of the points of disagreement between
Shaykh Aḥmad and these three eminent figures of Islamic
thought would be beyond the scope of this work, a discussion
of the major points as they are revealed in the Shaykh’s
better known works, should suffice to illustrate the dispute.

Among the Ṣúfís, Muḥy al-Dín Ibn al-‘Arabí has been
severely criticized in the works of Shaykh Aḥmad. Shaykh
Aḥmad sarcastically calls Muḥy al-Dín (Reviver of religion),
“Mumít al-Dín”, (slayer of religion)22 and regards him as an
infidel.

Among Ṣúfí thinkers, Ibn al-‘Arabí is a classical
example and the best known representative of Islamic

pantheism. His pantheism is clear in his theory of Love.

To him, “The ultimate goal of love is to know the reality of
love and that the reality of love is identical with God’s
Essence.”23

> He praises me and I praise Him,
> And He worships me and I worship Him.
> In one state I acknowledge Him
> And in the a‘yán I deny Him.
> He knows me and I know Him not,
> And I know Him and behold Him.
> How can He be independent,
> When I help Him and assist Him?

In my knowing Him, I create Him.24
A basic belief of the Ṣúfís, including Ibn al-‘Arabí,
concerns the love of God and the idea that, in the last
stage of the journey to God, the lover may become unified
with Him. According to Ibn al-‘Arabí,

> Man makes various progresses [sic], which are
> thought of as a series of journeys (asfár), in
> particular three: (1) from God, al-safar‘an Alláh,
> by which a man having traversed the various worlds
> (‘awálim) is born into this world, and is then
> thus furthest removed from God; (2) to God, al-
> safar ila’lláh, by which, with the help of a guide,
> he makes the spiritual journey with the goal of
> reaching the “station of junction [with Universal
> Intelligence] after separation” (makám al-djam‘ba‘d
> al-tafriḳa); (3) in God, al-safar fi’lláh. The
> first two journeys have an end, the third has
> no end: it is baḳá’bi’lláh. The traveller (sálik)
> who is making the third journey performs those
> precepts of the sharí‘a which are farḍ; externally,
> he is living with his fellows; but internally he
> is dwelling with God. Not every man is capable of
> more than the first journey; only those specially
> endowed (khawáṣṣ) may win to the vision of God,
> but even for them this depends on certain conditions
> (shurúṭ), some fulfilled by the traveller (sálik,
> muríd) himself, some provided by the shaykh. Even
> the Prophet had a shaykh—Gabriel … There will
> be awakened in his heart a love (maḥabba), which

grows to be a passion (‘ishḳ) quite distinct from
selfish desires (shahwa). It is this passion which

particularly brings men to God. On the journey
> the sálik experiences a series of “states” (aḥwál),
> some continuing and hence called “resting-places”
> (maḳám, manzil), at each of which he learns various
> ma‘árif. When the heart is thoroughly purified,
> the veil (ḥidjáb) of those “other” things which
> hide God (má siwá’ Alláh) is drawn aside; all things,
> past, present and future, are known; God grants
> the manifestation (tadjallí) of Himself; and finally
> union with Him (waṣl) is achieved.25
Shaykh Aḥmad maintains there exists connection in
creation, but the connection does not physically reach God.
No created being can attain to what is not created, i.e.,
the Necessary Being. To be able to do so it would have to
be the Necessary Being itself.26 The Necessary Being is
limitless, eternal, immortal, and invisible. The world of
creation, on the contrary, is bound by natural law, finite,
mortal, and visible. To him the Necessary Being does not
ascend or descend and is never an object for any kind of
unification with His creation.

Because there can be no connection between Possible
Being and the Necessary Being, Shaykh Aḥmad believes that it
is absolutely impossible for a man, no matter how exalted in
rank, to love God and to achieve union with Him. Loving
someone, in the views of Shaykh Aḥmad, is a function of soul
(nafs) and intellect (‘aql). This function is not possible
without the continuous remembrance of the beloved and
concentration on the ways of loving and joining him, which
requires picturing him. Without imagination, one cannot
achieve His remembrance or think about the ways of joining
Him, and this is not possible in the case of God.27 Shaykh

Aḥmad’s second major point of disagreement with the Ṣúfís,
particularly Muḥy al-Dín Ibn al-‘Arabí, concerns the Ṣúfí
theory of “unity of being” (waḥdat al-wujúd). According to
this theory, existence (wujúd) is described as one plain
(basíṭ), continuous thing (shay’ wáḥid), which is nothing
but God, and God is nothing but that existence. Shaykh
Aḥmad denounced this pantheistic doctrine and therefore
designated its upholder, Ibn al-‘Arabí, as an infidel.28
Such a doctrine necessitates that God be, on the one hand, a
creator, and, on the other, a creature—which is patently
against the basic principle of the Qur’án and the Islamic
Traditions.29 Schimmel writes,

> The concept of waḥdat al-wujúd does not involve
> a substantial continuity between God and creation.
> In Ibn ‘Arabí’s thought, a transcendence across

Although Schimmel’s description of an aspect of waḥdat
al-wujúd denies that the creatures are identical with God,
it still maintains that they are the reflections of His
attributes. Even if by “attributes” the actional attributes
are meant, Shaykh Aḥmad would still not agree with the
concept of waḥdat al-wujúd as long as God stands at one end
of it. It does not seem that even the non-pantheistic
interpretations of Ibn al-‘Arabí’s thought advanced by Henry

Corbin and Seyyed H. Nasr would be acceptable to Shaykh
Aḥmad, because in these interpretations, too, God is assumed
to have produced creation as a mirror for His tajallíyát,
His manifestations,31 whereas Shaykh Aḥmad maintains that
the mirror for His tajallíyát is His will, from which the
creation came into being.

A basic point of disagreement between Shaykh Aḥmad and
Shí‘í theologians is the question of God’s knowledge. Mullá
Muḥsin Fayḍ Káshání was one of the leading Shí‘í theologians
whose views on God’s knowledge the Shaykh criticized. Mullá
Muḥsin believed that God knew about His creation “before” He
actually created it. He maintained this because he believed
that God, who is the knower (‘álim), could never have been
without knowledge and that this knowledge must always have
had an object.32 This “object” is a created thing about
which God knew since He existed, i.e., since eternity.

Shaykh Aḥmad holds that God’s knowledge is an essential
attribute and is identical with His essence, i.e., that
there is no separation between His essence and His knowledge,
and there exists no object for His knowledge because
knowledge and the essence are identical, i.e., the knower
and the known are the same. God’s knowledge about what His
essence does is not to be confused with His knowledge of His
essence itself, because His knowledge of His essence has no
object except His essence. This means that there was
nothing to be known (although He knew His essence, and that
knowledge was identical with His essence), until He created

things and knew about them “after” their creation.33

The Shaykh quotes a Tradition on the authority of Imám
Ṣádiq which reads, “There was God, our respected and exalted
God, and knowledge was His essence and there was nothing
known [ma‘lúm] to Him. … When He created [aḥdatha]
things and the known came into being, His knowledge came to
rest [waqa‘a] upon the known”.34 The Shaykh explains this
Tradition by saying that God certainly is all-knowing, but
at first His knowledge comprehends only His essence, and
after He creates things His knowledge knows them.35

Mullá Muḥsin says that God’s knowledge about Himself
and His knowledge about His creation are one. Shaykh Aḥmad
believes that Mullá Muḥsin is wrong in regarding these two
kinds of knowledge as one and as identical with His essence.
Shaykh Aḥmad, in opposition to Mullá Muḥsin, maintains that
God’s knowledge about Himself and God’s knowledge about His
creation are different; the first is a condition of the
second.36

Mullá Muḥsin Fayḍ believes that everything in the
material world has two aspects: first, the uncreated
aspect which existed in the mind of God before it came into
being, an aspect which is eternal and identical with God;
second, the definite form it assumed as a material object in
the universe.

Shaykh Aḥmad asserts that Mullá Muḥsin’s view is
contrary to that of the imáms, and points out that created
things (ḥádith) are not under any circumstances eternal

(azalí), and that God does not contain both eternal and
new.37

Among the philosophers, Mullá Ṣadrá’s views have been
extensively discussed in the works of Shaykh Aḥmad, who
rejects his theory that the elementary reality is all
things” (basíṭ al-ḥaqíqa Kull al-ashyá’), which holds that
being, although single in its reality, manifests itself with
varying degrees of intensity in different grades of
existence. The concept of basíṭ al-ḥaqíqa maintains that
the being of God and the being of possible being are all one
being, although they differ from each other in degree of
intensity.

The Essence of God, which is simple (basíṭ), manifests
itself in various degrees and different stages in all
things. Cause and effect, according to the concept of
basíṭ al-ḥaqíqa, are fundamentally the same. What differ-
entiates things from God is their deficiencies and limita-
tions. If one disregards these limitations and deficiencies,
only perfection remains, which is identical with the essence
of God, Who is perfect.38

The concept of basíṭ al-ḥaqíqa holds that the Being,
which is absolutely simple and free from any kind of
limitation or composition, contains within it all the
attributes of all beings. Thus, the concept refers to a
hierarchy, each stage of which includes all those things
that are in the stages below it. For example, the first
intellect, which is the first manifestation of God, occupies

the second stage in the hierarchy and contains all the
attributes of any other being inferior to it. This,
however, does not mean that the first intellect contains the
quantities of all material bodies, but that all the
attributes of all creation are found in the first intellect,
God, Who is beyond the first intellect and is the most
simple Being, possesses all the attributes of the whole of
existence. If God did not possess the attributes of the
whole creation, He could not have given them to it.39

Shaykh Aḥmad rejects the concept of the basíṭ al-ḥaqíqa
by maintaining that, first, there is only one Simple Being;
all else is complex, i.e., composed of matter and form.
Composed beings differ from one another only in concentra-
tion. For example, intellect and stone differ only in the
matter of intellect, which is made of the liquid light
(al-núr al-dhá’ib), i.e., intellectual matter (al-mádda
al-‘unṣuríya). Intellect and stone, lake other created
things, are created by the action of God and not from His
Essence. They also receive their quiddity—their form—from
Him, because nothing can exist without both existence
(wujúd) and quiddity (máḥíya). Second, Shaykh Aḥmad argues
that the concept of basíṭ al-ḥaqíqa implies that things
exist with God in His Essence. This is not acceptable
because it, in turn, implies that things are co-eternal with
His Essence, and, in addition, that the Essence of God is
complex, which are both false, according to Shaykh Aḥmad.40

Shaykh Aḥmad believes that even the simplicity of

existence is not conceivable in the Possible Being: things
that exist in the realm of the Possible Being occupy a
different level in the hierarchy, and there is a substantial
difference between things on different levels. For example,
there exists no point of comparison between the first
intellect and those things situated below it although the
first intellect is the cause of their being.41 To elaborate
the point, Shaykh Aḥmad says that the light of Muḥammad was
the first creation. From this light, the light of the imáms
came to being, and from the light of the imáms the light of
the believers came into being, all the way down to the
lowest level of the hierarchy. It is true that in all these
levels we are talking about one substance—the light—but
the degree of its manifestation is so different that we
cannot say that abstract intellects, divine spirits, and
dense mineral bodies are alike.42

Shaykh Aḥmad emphasizes that God’s Essence is single,
that there is nothing with it or in it. Things came into
being as a result of His action in the Possible Being, which
is not in any way comparable with His Essence. If we assume
that things are identical with His Essence or that they are
in His knowledge, then His Essence and His creation would be
identical. This assumption is not correct because the
creation is within the realm of Possible Being, and Possible
Being cannot achieve union with the Necessary Being. Shaykh
Aḥmad insists that God is absolutely incomprehensible to and
unreachable by man. That which man imagines about Him is

not the Reality of God; He, the unknowable, the unthinkable,
the inconceivable, is far beyond the highest conception of
man.

In summary, the basic ontological doctrines Shaykh
Aḥmad sets forth are: (1) God’s Essence, which is simple,
is, and has ever been, incomprehensible to and unreachable
by man; (2) existence is the creation of God’s action and
not a part of His Essence; (3) His will is an actional
attribute, separated from His Essence, and the cause of
creation; (4) man is substantially unable to comprehend any
being which is beyond his possible-conditioned intellect.

Such doctrines led the Shaykh to the belief that
between God and man there are intermediaries who bear His
names and embody His attributes. They are the manifesta-
tions or representatives of God’s power, knowledge, and
other attributes in the realm of Possible Being. Therefore.
the highest point of comprehension and the ultimate level of
unification for man is comprehension and unification with
the intermediaries, as man has no access to any other being
beyond them, i.e., God.

The intermediaries are the prophets and the imáms, who
are in reality the hypostasis of the Necessary Being.
Although they share certain functions, responsibilities, and
qualifications, a prophet occupies a higher rank than an
imám. The function of prophethood (nubuwwat) is to convey
the will of God to people without a human intermediary. It
also means to inform people of God’s Essence, attributes,

actions, and teachings. There are two types of prophethood:
prophethood of definition (nubuwwat ta‘ríf) and prophethood
of legislation (nubuwwat tashrí‘). Prophethood of defini-
tion has to do with informing people about God, His
attributes, names, and actions, whereas the prophethood of
legislation, which is identical with messengership (risálat),
means establishing moral, social, and political institu-
tions—sharí‘a.43

Prophethood is described as the receiving of knowledge
by a purified soul (al-nafs al-qudsíya) from the essence of
the first intellect (al-‘aql al-awwal), and messengership is
described as proclaiming that knowledge to the prepared
(musta‘idd) people.44

Regarding the relationship between God and a prophet,
Shaykh Aḥmad denies that any point of comparison (nisbat)
exist between God and the prophet. If, hypothetically,
there were such a relation, the eternal (qadím), i.e., God,
would have to be in relationship with the new (ḥádith), the
prophet. To hold such an idea is infidelity (kufr) and
blasphemy (zandaqa).45 Just as there can be no point of
comparison between God and His prophet, there can be none
between a prophet and an ordinary man. A prophet is the man
who is essentially qualified (qábil) to be a prophet because
of a particular capability that an ordinary man does not
possess. Thus, God does not choose just any man as His
prophet, but only the one capable and worthy of proclaiming
God’s message to His people. The essential capability of

the prophet is unique among mankind, and no one else is
capable nor worthy of receiving God’s revelation.

This view of the relationship between God and His
prophet, on the one hand, and between the prophet and the
people, on the other hand, is one of the major points of
dispute between the Shaykhís and the Ṣúfís. The Ṣufís
traditionally maintain that prophets reach the position of
prophethood through their personal spiritual endeavor.
Ascetic practices, including purifying the heart from
temptations, abandoning all the natural inclinations,
subduing human desires, and adhering to meditation and
spiritual qualities increase the divine nature in man. The
ultimate result of this process is that the individual loses
his personal identity and receives God’s divine identity.
According to the Ṣúfís, such a journey culminates with the
ability to be a prophet. Although the Shaykhís do not deny
that a man makes spiritual progress through ascetic
practices, they insist that an ordinary man cannot become a
prophet no matter how highly he has development his spirit-
ual qualities on the journey. A prophet has a unique
capability not granted to any other man. Through the
spiritual journey this unique capability develops and
reaches its highest level. While the journey, by itself
does not create the capability, it enhances it. This unique
capability differentiates a prophet from an ordinary man and
gives him a substantial superiority above mankind.

The relationship between a prophet and a man is like

that of the sun and its radiance. The radiance cannot
achieve the station of the sun, yet its own existence
depends upon it. In the sane way, a man cannot achieve the
station of a prophet, yet his life is dependent upon the
prophet’s life.46

Regarding the relationship between a prophet and an
angel, the Shaykhís assert that an angel is not made of
matter and, therefore, has no relationship to the material
world.47 The station of the prophet, however, is higher
than that of an angel.48 Sayyid Káẓim relates a Tradition
on the authority of the Prophet, who told ‘Alí b. Abí Ṭálib,
“God has not created any one more exalted and more loved
than me (the Prophet).” When ‘Alí asked the Prophet if he
was more exalted than an angel, the Prophet replied, “O ‘Alí,
God has given His “Sent Prophets” [mursalín] a higher
station than His “Close Angels” [muqarrabín] and He has
given me a station higher than that of the other prophets
and apostles. After me the highest station is yours and
after you it belongs to the imáms. Verily, the angels are
our servants and the servants of our lovers.”49

Shaykh Aḥmad maintains that a prophet, as a receiver of
God’s revelation, is infallible and free from all sin.50
He occupies the highest position in regard to moral
standards, and his infallibility is thought to begin even
before his declaration of prophethood.

The Prophet Muḥammad was sent to all creatures with
proofs of his right to prophethood, the most important of

which is the Qur’án. He is the final Prophet until the Day
of Judgment, and the last one in the chain of five prophets
who preceeded him, i.e., Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and
Jesus.51 The religion of the prophet, Islam, which is
situated at the highest level of the religious hierarchy, is
the most comprehensive religion, and the earlier religions
were only introductions to it.52 Islam abrogates all the
previous religions.

Regarding the relationship between the Prophet Muḥammad
and the imáms, Shaykh Aḥmad writes that the Prophet is like
a house and that the imáms are the people of this house
(‘ítrat ahl bayt). Here, “house” stands for kinship,
referring to the fact that the imáms are the descendents of
the Prophet. The house also stands for knowledge (bayt
al-‘ilm), to which the imáms are like the doors. This
indication is based on many Traditions such as the one on
the authority of Abú Ja‘far al-Báqir which reads, “The
children of Muḥammad [ál Muḥammad] are the doors to God and
the ways to God.”53

People are created from the radiance of the light of
the imáms, and, therefore, the imáms are the actional cause
(al-‘illat al-fá‘ilíya), as well as the material cause
(al-‘illat al-máddíya). The imáms are also the formal cause
(al-‘illat al-ṣúríya) because the form of every single item
of creation is their form; the imáms are the manifestation
of the grace of God, and each creature has its form as a
result of God’s grace. They are also the ultimate cause

(al-‘illat al-ghá’í) because God has created things for
their sake.54

The imáms are the a‘ráf (the area between Paradise and
Hell), intermediaries through whom God can be understood,
i.e., the understanding of God is only possible through the
guidance of (ahl al-ḥaqq), the people of truth, i.e., the
imáms.55

The imáms are like the gates between God and creation.

or as the keys to His treasure. They are the scene (maḥáll)
of the manifestation of His divine will and power, and the
embodiment of His attributes among mankind.56 The imáms, who
are the trustees (umaná’) of God among the people, are
installed in their position by the will of God, and the
Prophet only announces the installation. They are free from
all sin, forgetfulness, and ignorance before and after they
take office.57 As the representative of God on earth, they
are the most learned people and the world cannot function
without them.58

The imáms are the refuge (malja’), protection (maládh),
and authority (marji‘) for every thing that has issued from
His will, namely, substance (‘ain) or notion (ma‘ná), matter
(jawhar) or accident (‘araḍ), essence (dhát) or attribute
(ṣifat), ecstasy (ḥál) or condition (ẓarf), and even mater-
ial (bu‘d jismí), place (bu‘d makání), and time dimension
(bu‘d zamání). In sum, everything takes refuge in them
because of its poverty and needs.59

The Shaykhí’s believe that certain verses in the Qur’án

and the Traditions refer to the imáms, and they interpret
these verses in a way unacceptable to other Muslims. For
example, one verse of the Qur’án reads, “And He it is Who
has created man from the water, then He had made for him
blood-relationship and marriage-relationship and your Lord
is powerful.” (25:54) The Shaykhís insist that in this
verse ‘Alí b. Abí Ṭálib is the man referred to because he
had a blood-relationship and marriage-relationship with the
Prophet:60 ‘Alí was the Prophet’s cousin and son-in-law.
Another verse in the Qur’án reads, “Thus have we made you a
central [intermediate] people, that ye may be witnesses in
regard to mankind.” (2:143) The Shaykhís believe that the
terms “ummatan wasaṭan” (intermediate people) in this verse
refers to the imáms. This interpretation is based on a
Tradition on the authority of Abú ‘Abd Alláh who, when asked
about the meaning of these terms, replied, “We [the imáms]
are the intermediate people and we are God’s witnesses among
His people.”61 Another verse in the Qur’án which the
Shaykhís believe is a reference to the imáms reads,
‘Certainly We created man in the best make [aḥsani taqwímin].”
(95:4) Shaykh Aḥmad interprets the “best make” as the
perfect men, i.e., Muḥammad, his twelve sons and his
daughter Fáṭima.62 A Quranic verse reads, “… A good
tree, whose root is firm and whose branches are high.”
(14:24) Shaykh Aḥmad says that when Imám Báqir was asked
about the meaning of the above verse, he replied on the
authority of the Prophet, “I [the Prophet] am its root

[aṣluhá] and ‘Alí is its branch [far‘uhá]; and the imáms are
its twigs [aghṣánuhá], our knowledge is its fruit, and our
people [shí‘atuná] are its leaves.”63 In addition to these
verses, some Quranic terms such as “The Farthest Lote-Tree”
(sidrat al-muntahá) (53:14); “The Garden, The Place to be
Resorted to” (jannat al-ma’wá) (53:15) are also considered
as references to the imáms.64

The attitude of Shaykh Aḥmad towards the imáms and his
free interpretation of certain verses of the Qur’án to
signify their station, significance, and holiness, made him
the target of accusations that he was an Extremist, Ghálí.65

IV
The basic Shaykhí eschatological doctrines
Shaykh Aḥmad’s views on eschatological doctrines
constitute his most significant attempt to reconcile reason
and revelation. Such an undertaking was not new in Islamic
thought: many scholars before him had tried to reconcile
man’s reasoning with the revealed text of the Qur’án and the
narrated Traditions. Shaykh Aḥmad, therefore, sought not to
wrench reason and revelation into agreement, for some kind
of harmony between the two was already thought to exist.
His effort was to identify and describe the nature of that
harmony, and he based his doctrine on the belief that the
entire universe functions in accordance with certain
regulations and in absolute harmony. Reason and revelation
are construed as two manifestations of one reality; as such,
no conflict could exist between them.

It is true, however, that the exoteric aspect of
certain Quranic verses and Traditions is not acceptable
to the intellect. Shaykh Aḥmad describes such texts as
unclear (mutashábihát)1 verses, which according to the
Qur’án are intended to be interpreted.2 Consequently, his
approach toward eschatological concepts, which are primarily
expressed in the unclear verses of the Qur’án, is a ration-
alistic one, and his interpretation of them allegorical.
His approach, however, conflicted with that of the
fundamentalist thinkers who accepted only the literal

meaning of the verses and disallowed any use of man’s
intellectual reasoning to explore other, symbolic, meanings.
Shaykh Aḥmad rejected these fundamentalist presentations of
eschatological issues in the popular theological books of
the Shí‘a. In fact, his views on Islamic eschatology are
closer to Abú ‘Alí Síná (d. 428/1038) and Mullá Ṣadrá
(d. 1050/1640), his forerunners in this field. His ration-
alistic approach made him an influential reconciler of
reason and revelation in his period. Consequently, the
intellectual opposition that he, and later his pupils,
encountered was aimed more at his eschatological views than
any other aspect of his thought.

The rationalistic nature of Shaykh Aḥmad’s views
attracted non-fundamentalists who were seeking a reconcilia-
tion between reason and revelation. In this respect, the
Shaykhí school was a religious foundation for the
intellectual enlightenment that developed in the latter
decades of the nineteenth century in Iran.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s basic ontological doctrine of the
absolute distinction between Possible Being and Necessary
Being forms the cornerstone for Shaykhí eschatological
speculations.

Shaykh Aḥmad maintains that the will is the creative
source and the producer of Possible Being, which consists of
a hierarchy; beginning, at the lowest level, with the realm
of matter and ending, at the highest level, with the realm
of will. There are seven realms between the realm of matter

and the realm of will:
1\. The realm of similitudes (‘álam-i mithál), known also as

the realm of intermediary (barzakh, or Havarqalyá)
2\. The realm of bodily matter (mawádd-i jismáníya)
3\. The realm of nature (‘álam-i ṭabí‘at). This realm is

> contained in the realms of intellects (‘álam-i ‘uqúl),
> spirits (arwáḥ) and souls (nufús), but no separation or
> distinction exists among these three
4\. The realm of souls (nufús)
5\. The realm of spirits (‘álam-í arwáb)
6\. The realm of intellect (‘álam-i ‘uqúl)
7\. The realm of heart (‘álam-i fu’ád)3

As the realm of Possible Being is produced by the will,
any eschatological question which ends up with God, in the
popular Shí‘í view, ends up with the will in the Shaykh
view.

The basic eschatological questions which Shaykh Aḥmad
discusses are the Day of Judgment and its related issues—
Resurrection, Return, Meeting with God, Paradise and Hell,
and reward and punishment. The advent of the Mahdí (Guided
One) is strongly related to eschatological issues, but,
since it occupies a special place in Shaykh Aḥmad’s works
and played a significant role in the subsequent development
of the movement, it will be dealt with in a separate chapter.

Before considering Shaykh Aḥmad’s views, it is neces-
sary to review the essence of Islamic eschatology as it is
revealed in the Qur’án and expanded in the Traditions.

Islamic eschatology holds that the Day of Judgment will
definitely come, but only God knows when it will occur. Its
advent will be announced by the appearance of certain signs:
“mountains will be like carded wool”; “heaven shall be rent
asunder”; “the stars shall be dispersed”; “the seas shall be
commingled”; and “the earth and the mountains will be borne
away, and both of them crushed (to dust at a single
crushing).”4 The Antichrist, al-Dajjál,5 who leads people
away from the right path, will appear. The sun will rise
from the west, the Beast will appear, and Gog and Magog6
will come. Dense smoke, which will cover the earth for days,
and several eclipses will proclaim the approach of the Day
of Judgment. On that Day, the trumpet will blast twice. At
the first blast, all living things will die; at the second,
the dead will be resurrected. Then they will assemble in
the gathering place, in the presence of God, for His
judgment. God will ask them questions, weigh their deeds
and then, in accordance with their conduct, send them to
Hell or to Paradise. One of the major events of that Day
will be the advent of the Mahdí (Guided One), who will be
followed by the return of Christ.

Muslims maintain that the return of all to God and the
physical resurrection promised on the Day of Judgment are
the manifestation of God’s grace to mankind. Belief in that
Day assists man to obey God and prevents him from committing
sin. Whoever denies the Return denies the grace of God to
His people.7

Shaykh Aḥmad’s attitude toward the Day of Judgment
differs from the approach of the other Shí‘a. While the
Shí‘a maintain that on the Day of Judgment being will return
to God, its source, Shaykh Aḥmad believes that the creation
will return to its Possible source (mabda’-i imkání), rather
than to God, because creation has never come from God,
Himself, but from the will. In addition, resurrection will
take place not in the physical body, as the Shí‘í doctrine
maintains, but in another body, which Shaykh Aḥmad calls
the “subtle body” (jasad-i mithálí). The subtle body
consists of the elements of the realm of similitudes
(‘álam-i mithál), or, in Shaykh Aḥmad’s terminology, the
Havarqalyá (the realm of the subtle). Since the concept of
the “subtle body” and the realm of the subtle (Havarqalyá)
is a key to Shaykhí eschatological views, it deserves closer
attention.

Muḥammad Mu‘ín’s research on the etymology and history
of the term Havarqalyá shows that it is derived from the
Hebrew term habal qarnaím (Doppelgánger). According to this
derivation, the pronunciation of the term should be
Havarqalyá (‫ )ھَ َورْ ﻗَﻠﯿﺎ‬as Mu‘ín has suggested.8 This
pronunciation, although the most authentic, is, however,
less common. While Shaykh Aḥmad does not mention the
pronunciation of the term in his works, Muḥammad Tonekáboní
(d. 1302/1884), who was very familiar with the Shaykhí
ideology, in his Qiṣaṣ al-‘Ulamá states that the term should
be pronounced Huvarqalyá (‫)ھُ َورْ ﻗَﻠﯿﺎ‬.9 Tonekáboní, however,

adds that the term is commonly mispronounced Hurqalyá
(‫)ھُوْ رﻗَﻠﯿﺎ‬. He notes that when he pronounced the term
Huvarqalyá (‫ )ھُ َورْ ﻗَﻠﯿﺎ‬during a conversation with Ḥájj Mullá
Hádí Sabzavárí (d. 1289/1972).10 Sabzavárí pointed out that
the correct pronunciation was Hurqalyá (‫)ھُوْ رﻗَﻠﯿﺎ‬, not
Huvarqalyá (‫)ھُ َورْ ﻗَﻠﯿﺎ‬. Tonekáboní then told Sabzavárí that
he had heard a student of Mullá ‘Alí Núrí11 quote Mullá
‘Alí’s statement that Hurqalyá (‫ )ھُوْ رﻗَﻠﯿﺎ‬was wrong and that
the correct pronunciation was Huvarqalyá (‫)ھُ َورْ ﻗَﻠﯿﺎ‬.12

Today the popular, common pronunciation of this term is
Hurqalyá (‫)ھُوْ رﻗَﻠﯿﺎ‬, although it is not correct as far as its
etymological derivation from the Hebrew term is concerned.

Shaykh Aḥmad was not the first to use the term
Havarqalyá. According to Mu‘ín,13 the term was first used
by Shiháb al-Dín Yaḥyá b. Ḥabash Sohravardí, known as Shaykh
al-Ishráq (d. 587/1191), although the term itself received
little explanation either in the works of Sohravardí or his
commentators, such as Shams al-Dín Muḥammad b. Maḥmúd
Shahzorí and Quṭb al-Dín Muḥammad b. Mas‘úd Shírází (d. 710/
1310). In the works of Sohravardí, the realm of similitudes
is described as consisting of an elementary (‘amáṣir) realm,
within which are Jabursá and Jabulqá, and a celestial
(aflák) realm: this celestial realm of similitudes (‘álam
aflák al-muthul),14 is called Havarqalyá.

In the works of Shaykh Aḥmad, Havarqalyá (the realm of
the subtle) has several connotations and often is used
synonymously with “the realm of similitudes” (‘álam-i

mithál) and “isthmus” (barzakh).

According to Shaykh Aḥmad, Havarqalyá is a Syriac term15

meaning the next world” (mulk ákhar), located in the eighth
climate (iqlím) and including two cities: Jabursá in the
west and Jabulqá in the east.

Shaykh Aḥmad maintains that the realm of matter
(‘álam-i mulk) consists of two levels: the lower level, or
the realm of this earthly world (‘álam al-dunyá), and the
upper level, which Shaykh Aḥmad calls Havarqalyá, or the
“second material realm” (‘álam al-mulk al-thání).16 Thus,
in this sense Havarqalyá is regarded as a kind of purgator-
ial realm or isthmus (barzakh), which is an intermediary
between this material world (‘álam-i mulk) and the next,
spiritual, world (‘álam-i malakút). Shaykh Aḥmad conceived
of such an intermediate realm because he believed that since
spirit is pure spirit and the physical body is pure matter,
there should be another realm between the two, which is
neither one nor the other.17 The elements of the Havarqalyá
are described as having less density than the temporal
elements that make up the material world, yet more density
than pure spirit. This intermediary realm is the source of
the second body of man, which will survive death and
experience resurrection.

Shaykh Aḥmad maintains that man has two bodies: first,
the material body consisting of physical elements—water,
earth, air, and fire—which dissolves in the grave and does
not became resurrected at all; and second, the subtle body,

which will endure after the physical body has crumbled to
dust.18 It is the subtle body that will be resurrected on
the Day of Judgment. The subtle body does not decompose
because it consists of elements of the realm of similitudes
(‘álam-i mithál), or the Havarqalyá (the realm of the
subtle).

Regarding the functions and characteristics of the
subtle body, Shaykh Aḥmad states that a “true man” consists
of intellect (‘aql), soul (nafs), nature (ṭabí‘at), matter
(mádda) and subtle (mithál). Intellect is in soul, and
soul is in nature, and all three—intellect, soul, and
nature—are in matter. But the existence of matter is
dependent upon the subtle body. Only when the subtle clings
to matter, does a body (al-jism al-aṣlí) come into being.19
Shaykh Aḥmad describes the first external body (al-jasad
al-awwal al-ẓáhirí) as a “shell” made of earth, air, fire,
and water, while the second body (al-jasad al-thání) is a
more delicate internal substance, like a pearl, made of
subtle elements which are hidden in matter, i.e., the shell.
After death, matter remains in the grave and its external
appearance perishes. But its internal substance, which is
subtle, survives. This internal substance is the second
body, made of the Havarqalyá’s elements.

In one of Sayyid Káẓim’s works, the concept of the
subtle body occurs, but clothed in another term: “essential
element”. When Sayyid Káẓim was asked how God would bring
back the dead when they had been consumed by worms in their

graves, Sayyid Káẓim answered that a thing consists of
“essence” and “accident”. The being of a thing depends
primarily upon its essence. Man, accordingly, consists of
accidental elements, which will be consumed by worms, and
essential elements, which cannot perish or be destroyed.
That element which will be resurrected on the Day of
Judgment is the essential element, which survives after
death, and is so subtle that it is not visible.20 The
Return, therefore, will be in the essential element and not
the accidental. Although in his explanation Sayyid Káẓim
uses “essential element” and not “spirit”, as opposed to
“elementary element” or “body”, throughout his description
it is well understood that by the term “essential element”
he refers to man’s spirit. This speculation is supported in
another treatise Sayyid Káẓim wrote for Mullá Muqím Qazvíní,
in which nafs-i náṭiqa21 is used for “essential element”.
In this work he says that the reality of man is in his
spirit (nafs-i náṭiqa) and not in his body. During his life,
Sayyid Káẓim says, a person goes through the stages of
childhood, adolescence, and old age. Through this process,
many physical changes happen in his body, but his reality,
which is his spirit, remains the same and does not change
physically. He points out that some scholars, such as Mullá
Ṣadrá, maintain that return of the body, as a religious
dogma, is a fact and should be accepted, although intellect
fails to prove it. Sayyid Káẓim then remarks that God has
given us two proofs through which the truth is revealed:

external proofs, such as the prophets, and internal proofs,
such as man’s intellect. These two kinds of proofs are in
harmony and go together. Whatever a religion establishes,
the intellect accepts as true. Therefore, it is not permis-
sible to attempt to prove what is established by the divine
decree, if the intellect does not testify to its righteous-
ness.22

In answering the question of Káẓim b. ‘Alí Naqí al-
Suhá’í on the nature of the relationship between letters,
attributes of God, and creation, Shaykh Aḥmad outlines
another aspect of the concept of the “realm of the subtle”.
He states that the “limited being” (wujúd al-muqayyad),
which begins with the First Intellect and ends up with
earth, consists of twenty-eight stages, each of which
corresponds to an attribute of God as well as a letter of
the Arabic alphabet as shown in Table 1.23

The realm of the subtle is the fifth rank which
corresponds to God’s attribute, “Manifest” (al-ẓáhir) and
the letter “h” (‫)ه‬. The location of the realm of the
subtle, in this explanation, is between the realm of matter
(mádda) and the realm of the universal substance (jism al-
kull). The location of the subtle realm in this schema,
however, differs from another schema that Shaykh Aḥmad has
presented on the realms of the universe. According to the
other schema, the universe consists of six realms, namely:
1\. Intellects (‘uqúl), substances free from any physical

element or form
2\. Souls (nufús), the words of the Preserved Tablet
3\. Natures (ṭabáyi‘), the realm of concrete individuals
4\. The Realm of Jewel, or technical substances, referring

to the atoms of atmosphere
5\. The Realm of the Subtle, the forms in the atmosphere of

> the barzakh, between the malakút and the mulk, located
> between the non-material realm and the realm of time (the
> material)

6. The Realm of Material Bodies, which consists of elemen-

> tary matter (al-mawádd al-‘unṣuríya) and the subtle
> forms (al-ṣuwar al-mithálíya) which Shaykh Aḥmad under-
> stands from the realm of subtle, in this context, as
> the realm of image of substance (ṣuwar al-dhát), and
> that is the image of existence and its origin.24
According to this theory, a man is made of matter
(al-mádda) and image (al-ṣura). The relationship between
the matter and the image can be likened to a man in front of
a mirror. The matter is like the mirror and the image is
like a picture in the mirror.25 The relationship between
the realm of mithál to this world is like the relationship
between the sun and the earth. The sun manifests itself in
the earth without descending to earth or entering into it.
The sun is always in a fixed position, but its radiance is
manifested on the different objects on the earth.

The subtle realm, therefore, is like the image that one
can see in the mirror. The subtle realm is beyond the
limitation of the material world. What man sees in his
dream, which is the image, is the subtle realm.26

If we, hypothetically, imagine that the realm of the sub-
tle, like this material realm, has an earth and a heaven, Jáb-
ulqá and Jábursá would be its earth and Havarqalvá its heaven.

The concept of the subtle body is not only used to
explain the resurrection of bodies on the Day of Judgment,
it has also been used to discuss the Night Journey and the
Ascension of the Prophet Muḥammad to heaven. On the basis

of the Quranic verses, it is commonly held that the Prophet
was carried from the “Sacred Mosque” of Mecca to the “Remote
Mosque” of Jerusalem at night (isrá, night journey). From
Jerusalem the Prophet ascended to the “Lote-Tree” (sidrat
al-muntahá) and then was carried to the “measure of two bows
or closer still” (qaba qawsayn aw adná).27

The exoteric meanings of this occurrence as given in
the Qur’án and Islamic Traditions, and as they are under-
stood by the Muslims, are: (1) the Prophet ascended beyond
the material realm and (2) the Ascension took place with the
material body of the Prophet. However, the Shaykhís explain
that the Ascension took place within the Possible Being and
that Muḥammad did not ascend beyond the Possible realm.
Since, according to Shaykhí thought, the Prophet had come
from the “First Manifestation” (tajallí-i awwal) or the
“Divine Soul” (nafs-i raḥmání), the destination of his
Ascension was this same source, which is located within the
realm of Possible.28 The Shaykhís believe that the “measure
of two bows” (qába qawsayn) and the station of “closer
still” (aw adná), the highest point of the Ascension, are
still within the Possible realm.29 Shaykh Aḥmad, in con-
trast with the popular Muslim theologians’ view, maintains
that the Ascension took place not with the physical body of
the Prophet, but with his subtle body.

Regarding Hell and Paradise, Shaykhís hold that there
are two paradises: a worldly paradise (behesht-i dunyá) and
a Paradise in the hereafter (behesht-i ákhirat). After

separation from the body, the spirits of the believers, it
is believed, will remain in the first, worldly paradise
until the blast of the trumpet. This paradise is described
in the Qur’án as, “the gardens (jannát) of perpetuity, which
the Beneficent God has promised to His servants while
unseen; surely His promise shall come to pass. They shall
not hear therein any vain discourse, but only ‘Peace’, and
they shall have their sustenance therein morning and
evening.” (19:61–62) This verse, Shaykh Aḥmad believes,
refers to the world’s paradise, because “morning” and
“evening”, which are mentioned in this verse, are found in
this world and not in the hereafter, which is timeless.
Following the above verse, the Qur’án reads, “This is the
garden [al-jannat] which We cause those of Our servants to
inherit who guard (against evil).” (19:63) This verse,
according to Shaykh Aḥamad, refers to the paradise of the
hereafter.30

According to Shaykhí eschatological views, hell is also
of two kinds: there is a hell both in this world and in the
hereafter. The Qur’án refers to the world’s hell in verses
such as: “So Allah protected him from the evil (conse-
quences) of what they planned, and the most evil chastise-
ment overtook Pharaoh’s people: The fire; they shall be
brought before it (every) morning and evening ….”
(40:45–46)

The sane argument is applied here that this verse
refers to this world’s hell because time is not applicable

in the hereafter. The rest of the verse, however, refers to
the hereafter’s hell; it reads, “And on the day when the
hour shall come to pass: Make Pharaoh’s people enter the
severest chastisement.” (40:46) This verse refers to the
severest chastisement of the fire in the hell of the
hereafter.31

A common Muslim belief is that on the Day of Judgment
man will see or meet with God. This concept is found in
many verses of the Qur’án. For example: “They are losers
indeed who reject the meeting of Allah: until when the hour
comes upon them all of a sudden they shall say; ‘Our grief
for our neglecting it.’” (6:31) Another verse says, “They
will perish indeed who called the meeting with Allah to be a
lie, and they are not followers of the right direction.”
(10:45) And also it says, “He regulates the affair, making
clear the communications that you may be certain of meeting
your Lord.” (13:2)

The concept of a meeting with God is one of the most
controversial issues in Islamic theology. On the basis of
the Quranic verse which reads, “Vision comprehends Him not,
and He comprehends (all) vision …” (6:104), some scholars
believe that a meeting with God is impossible for man. They,
therefore, take the verses which refer to meeting God
allegorically, not literally. Another group of scholars
believe that a meeting with God will surely occur. They
assert that if such a meeting were impossible, Moses would
not have asked for it. According to the Qur’án, Moses said

to God, “My Lords show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon
Thee.” (7:143) Although God replied, “You cannot (bear to)
see Me” (7:143), the fact that Moses made this request
indicates the possibility of such a meeting. In addition.
although it was not possible for Moses to see God at that
time, according to the Quranic verses, God will show Himself
on the Day of Judgment. Thus, the negative answer that
Moses received was for that time only, not forever.

Shaykh Aḥmad, however, rejects the traditional, literal
interpretation of such a meeting with God on the basis of
his ontological principle that the Essence of God is beyond
the reach of Possible Being. He interprets the meeting with
God described in the Qur’án as “seeing” God with the heart.
Seeing God would not be visually beholding God’s Essence.
but rather seeing God’s manifestation. This is possible
when man’s heart has faith in Him, His actions, works, and
teachings. If one obeys the commands of God and observes
His prohibitions, God will remove the veil from his eyes and
then he will be able to recognize God’s will at work.32

As for seeing God on the Day of Judgment, Shaykh Aḥmad
has another interpretation. As previously stated, on the
basis of Islamic Traditions, Shaykh Aḥmad interprets the Day
of Judgment as the Day of the advent of the expected Qá’im.
This interpretation, although based on Traditions, is
radically different from the common Muslim belief. In the
usual Muslim concept of the Day of Judgment, this Day is
expected to alter the entire universe, bringing drastic

revolutions, changes, and the transformation of the very
phenomenon of life on earth. In the Day of Judgment as
understood by Shaykh Aḥmad, revolutions, changes, and
transformations will take place, but not in the way that
people literally understand from the text.

In this interpretation of the Day of Judgment, Shaykh
Aḥmad attempts to reconcile intellect and revelation. The
universe will not come to an end on the Day of Judgment; it
has always existed and will continue to exist forever. What
the Day of Judgment truly means is the Day of advent of a
new manifestation of God which puts an end to the course of
its previous dispensation and opens a new cycle for human
beings. As the Day of the advent of the expected Qá’im, the
Day of Judgment will bring about changes in the social,
moral, and religious life of the people; the values that
have been applied for centuries will change, the principles
and teachings of the previous religion will change, and a
profound revolution will take place in all the various
aspects of man’s activities.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s interpretation of the Day of Judgment is
founded on the many Traditions on the authority of Shí‘í
imáms which interpret the Quranic verses on this subject as
referring to the day of the advent of the Qá’im.33 For
example, one Quranic verse says, “The hour [the Day of
Judgment] drew nigh”. (54:1) A Tradition interprets the
verse as the advent of the Qá’im.34 Another Quranic verse
refers to one of the signs of the Day of Judgment by saying

“For when the trumpret is sounded ….” (74:8) A
Tradition regards the verse as referring to the Hidden Imám,
i.e., the Qá’im.35 Another verse in the Qur’án reads, “And
certainly We sent Moses with Our communications, saying:
Bring forth your people from utter darkness into light and
remind them of the days of Allah.” (14:5) A Tradition tells
us that “the days of Allah” is not only the Day of Judgment,
but can also be thought of as the day of the Qá’ím (yaum al-
qá’im) and also the day of death (yaum al-maut).36 These
few Traditions, the essence of which is found in numerous
others, provide the basis for interpreting the Quranic
verses on the Day of Judgment as indicating the advent of
the Qá’im. This is exactly what Shaykh Aḥmad has done.

As reward or punishment is expected to be meted out on
the traditional Day of Judgment, according to Shaykhí
interpretation, reward and punishment will be given to
people on the Day of the advent of the Qá’im. For those who
succeed in recognizing him, that act of recognition itself
will be their reward; and for those who fail to recognize
him, that failure shall be their punishment. Therefore, to
recognize the expected Qá’im is to enter paradise, and to be
deprived of his recognition is hell. Moreover, the bridge
(Ṣiráṭ) referred to in the texts will not be the familiar
bridge between hell and paradise, but is a symbol of the
Qá’im‘s teachings, principles, and doctrines. Shaykh Aḥmad,
in a treatise known as Qaṭífíya, says that Ṣiráṭ is the way
from God to His creation and His creation’s way to Him. The

“way” is a symbol which stands for the imám, his friendship,
this teachings, and the recognition of himself.37

Sayyid Káẓim, in a treatise written for a certain Mullá
Ḥusayn ‘Alí, says that the Ṣiráṭ is of two kinds; one is in
this world and one is in the hereafter. The Ṣiráṭ is a way
which God has provided to assist His creation and is a way
through which God can answer His creation’s request for
assistance. The Ṣiráṭ is a channel which connects God with
His creation, and vice versa. This way is the way of
Religion, which is the way between His action and His
creation.38 The Ṣiráṭ is also those deeds which are the
result of man’s recognition of the Prophet and obedience to
His teachings, and by which he can enter Paradise.39

Shaykh Aḥmad’s approach towards the basic Islamic
eschatological doctrines focuses on reconciliation between
reason and revelation. To achieve this goal, he uses two
tactics. First, he appeals to his ontological base which
holds that no connection can be conceived between the realm
of Possible Being and the realm of the Necessary Being, and
consequently, any eschatological doctrine that, in the
orthodox Shí‘í view, ends up with God, should, in his view,
and up with the Will. Second, he maintains that if the
Resurrection and Return are going to occur, they will
happen with the subtle body and not with the physical body,
contrary to popular doctrine. Finally, he suggests that the
Day of Judgment can be thought of as the Day of the advent
of the Qá’im, on which all signs of the Day of Judgment

would be fulfilled allegorically.

V
Developments in the Shaykhí school after

the death of Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í
The death of Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í in 1241/1827 did not
result in a struggle for succession, for it was widely known
within his circle as well as outside that Sayyid Káẓim
Rashtí was to be his successor. Once when Shaykh Aḥmad had
been asked who should be the authority after him, he replied
that Sayyid Káẓim was the one.1 Shaykh Aḥmad called Sayyid
Ráẓim “My Son” (waladí).2 Indeed, one commentator has gone
so far as to describe Sayyid Kázim as the shining apple of
his [Shaykh Aḥmad’s] eye and the splendid bright strength of
his heart, his companion in his hardships and troubles, and
he who was like the shirt on his back.”3

Sayyid Káẓim’s intellectual and scholastic relationship
with Shaykh Aḥmad, his indisputable authority in Islamic
literature in general and Shaykh Aḥmad’s writings and
thoughts in particular, and his piety and faithfulness made
him the only one intellectually worthy and scholastically
capable to lead the Shaykhí school.

Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí b. Qásim b. Aḥmad b. Ḥabíb was born
in 1212/17984 in Rasht in the Province of Gílán. His family
was reputed to have been descended from the Prophet and
traced its origin to Medina. After Sayyid Ḥabíb’s death,
his son, Sayyid Aḥmad, emigrated to Rasht, where his son
Qásim, and then Sayyid Káẓim, were born.5

Little is known about Sayyid Kaẓim’s childhood except
that in his early years, in his home town, he received a
traditional religious education. He studied Islamic
sciences and memorized the Qur’án.

When he was a young man he had a dream in which Fáṭima,
the daughter of the Prophet, advised him to go to Yazd to
meet with Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í, who was residing there at the
time. Acting upon this vision, Sayyid Káẓim went to Yazd in
1231/1815 when he was about 20 years old and met with Shaykh
Aḥmad. This was the beginning of his scholastic career.
For about ten years, until Shaykh Aḥmad’s death in 1241/1825,
Sayyid Kim studied with him, accompanied him on his
journeys, and was his closest assistant. Although Shaykh
Aḥmad was his main teacher, Sayyid Káẓim had the opportunity
to study with several other learned men of his time such as
Sayyid ‘Abd Alláh Shubbar (d. 1242/1826), Mullá ‘Alí Rashtí,
and Shaykh Músá Najafí (d. 1241/1825).6 Of his teachers,
however, he most respected and admired Shaykh Aḥmad. To
Sayyid Káẓím, Shaykh Aḥmad was not merely a teacher but a
spiritual leader, a sympathetic companion, and a kind
guardian who looked after him with tender care. Through
this relationship, Sayyid Káẓim not only acquired the
doctrinal beliefs of Shaykh Aḥmad, but also the Shaykh’s
attitudes and world view.

The ministry of Sayyid Káẓim, which officially began in
1241/1825, was in fact an extension of Shaykh Aḥmad’s
authority and influence. By this it is not implied that

Sayyid Káẓim’s contribution was any the less, for it was
Sayyid Káẓim’s creativity that brought Shaykh Aḥmad’s thought
into its full measure of elaboration.

During Sayyid Káẓím’s ministry, the Shaykhís developed
an increasing sense of solidarity. Although the Shaykhí
school did not operate independently of the Shí‘a, its
unique features, which were only partly evident toward the
end of the time of Shaykh Aḥmad, were becoming crystallized.
It was at this time, too, that Shaykh Aḥmad’s doctrines
received full elaboration and further explanation in the
works of Sayyid Káẓim, which occurred partly as a result of
several scholastic-confrontations that Sayyid Káẓim had in
Karbalá with some of the leading religious authorities of
the time. These confrontations brought out the unique
characteristics of Shaykhí doctrines and the points of
disagreement with other trends of thought.

Sayyid Káẓim’s most important confrontation took place
in Karbalá at a meeting with three distinguished Uṣúlí
scholars: Sayyid Mahdí b. Sayyid ‘Alí Ṭabáṭabá’í (d. 1260/
1844), Muḥammad Ja‘far Astarábádí (d. 1263/1847), and
Muḥammad Sharíf b. Mullá Ḥasan ‘Alí Mázandarání, known as
Sharíf al-‘Ulamá (d. 1245/1829).7 The meeting, held at the
request of Sayyid Mahdí Ṭabáṭabá’í, was called to examine
the Shaykhí views on theological questions such as the
Return, the Ascension of the Prophet, and the status of the
imáms.8 In this meeting, Sayyid Káẓim admitted that some of
Shaykh Aḥmad’s writings appeared to contradict popular Shí‘í

beliefs. Upon this admission, Ṭabáṭabá’í, with the coopera-
tion of his colleagues, issued a takfír to the effect that
Shaykhís were heretics. Later, Mullá Muḥammad Ja‘far
Astarábádí, one of the participants in that meeting, wrote a
book rejecting the Shaykhí ideology.9 This takfír was
followed by others issued by authorities such as Mullá Áqá
Darbandí (d. 1286/1869); Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥusayn b.
Muḥammad
Raḥím (d. 1250/1834), the author of al-Fuṣúl al-
Gharawíya fi al-Uṣúl al-Fiqhíya; and Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥasan
b. Báqir Najafí (d. 1266 or 1268/1844), author of the
Jawáhir al-Kalám fí Sharḥ Sharáyi‘ al-Islám.10

On another occasion in Karablá, a confrontation took
place with Mírzá Muḥammad Ḥasan, the son of the well-known
philosopher and student of Mullá Ṣadrá’s philosophy, Mullá
‘Alí Núrí (d. 1246/1830). The subject was the concept of
basíṭ al-ḥaqíqa, to which the opposition of Shaykh Aḥmad was
well known. Although the concept was a major point of
disagreement between the Shaykh and Mullá Ṣadrá, it is
reported that when Muḥammad Ḥasan, who was a representative
of Mullá Ṣadrá’s school, explained Ṣadrá’s stand on the
subject, Sayyid Káẓim did not have any objection.11

The outcome of such frequent confrontations with
representatives of different trends of thought was not, of
course, always favorable for the Shaykhís, but the effect of
such confrontations was to increase solidarity and to
advance a sense of identity among the Shaykhís, who came to
see themselves as distinct from the rest of the Shí‘a in

thought, approach, and behavior. The confrontations
intensified the enmity and hatred between the two parties.
They also brought the Shaykhí school wider recognition and
attracted to it students who were seeking a new approach
toward religious questions. Confrontations also demon-
strated that the Shaykhí ideology was a threat to the
authority and power of the ‘ulamá and the popularly held
beliefs of the Shí‘a.

The very fact that these discussions took place,
regardless of the outcome, reveals that in Karbalá the Shí‘ì
‘ulamá regarded the Shaykhís as a group against which they
had to take measures in the name of protection of the
Sharí‘a. There is no doubt that they recognized in Shaykhí
ideas a potential threat to their own authority and position.

The Shaykhí school at the time of Sayyid Káẓim became
an active force for anti-traditionalists, who regarded it as
a revolutionary movement against the religious authorities
and their dogmas. The revolutionary force of the movement,
now only in its religious embryonic form, would develop in
later decades into a mature religious and socio-political
revolution.

The intellectual result of the confrontations appeared
in several apologetical and polemical works issuing from
both parties.

Sayyid Káẓim’s works
Sayyid Káẓim’s works were primarily written in the form
of a risála (treatise) in answer to the religious questions
of his students, followers, religious authorities, and
statesmen. The questions they asked were numerous and
touched on a vast range of subjects, from daily juridical
problems to theology and philosophy, and even Freemasonry in
the west. A single treatise night cover a few or as many as
eighty questions in different fields.12

Sayyid Káẓim also wrote commentaries on Quranic verses
or phrases, on Traditions on the authority of the Prophet
and the imáms, and on the works of his predecessors, such as
Mullá Muḥsin Fayḍ or Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í. Besides writing
commentaries on Shaykh Aḥmad’s works, Sayyid Káẓim trans-
lated Shaykh Aḥmad’s Ḥayát al-Nafs and Risála-i Ḥaydaríya
into Persian as well as a few sections of the Sharḥ
al-Ziyára.

Sayyid Káẓim states clearly that his ideology derives
from Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í’s and his knowledge comes from him
as well.13 Although this statement may have traces of
humility, it is nonetheless a fact that his writings are an
obvious extension of those of Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í. Even a
glance at Sayyid Káẓim’s works reveals that he was deeply
influenced by the methodology, terminology, and general
approach of Shaykh Aḥmad.

Sayyid Káẓim wrote extensively. He himself gives a

list of 138 works at the end of his Dalíl al-Mutaḥayyirín.14

Nicolas, in Essai Sur Le Chéikhisme, lists 135 works;15
Habíbábádí, in the Makárim al-Áthár, lists 60;16 and Mudarris,
in Rayḥánat al-Adab, mentions that Sayyid Káẓim wrote 150
works.17 The most complete and comprehensive list of Sayyid
Káẓim’s works, however, is provided by Ibráhímí, who devotes
the second chapter of the second volume of the Fihrist18
entirely to them. In this chapter, he lists about 170 works
under the following headings:
1\. Works on divine theology and virtues
2\. Works on doctrines and rejection of his opponents’

views
3\. Works on mysticism
4\. Works on principles of fiqh
5\. Works on fiqh
6\. Commentaries
7\. Works answering various questions19

The language of Sayyid Káẓim, like that of his teacher
Shaykh Aḥmad, is not easy to understand. Technical terms,
allegorical expressions, and extensive gnostic terminology
contribute to this difficulty. Indeed, the author of the
Aḥsan al-Wadí‘a, Muḥammad Mahdi Músawí, remarks that no one
can understand his works. He goes on to state sarcastically
that Sayyid Káẓim has written in Hindi.20

While Shaykh Aḥmad wrote exclusively in Arabic, Sayyid
Káẓim wrote some works in Persian, although his major books
are entirely in Arabic. Three of his most important books

are considered in greater detail.
1\. Sharḥ al-Khuṭbat al-Ṭutunjíya

This is a commentary on a sermon delivered by ‘Alí b. Abí
Ṭálib between Kufa and Medina. Nahj al-Balágha does not
contain this sermon, but it is recorded in al-Majmú‘ al-
Rá’iq21 and Shaykh Rajab al-Ḥáfiẓ al-Bursí’s Masháriq Anwár
al-Yaqín.22 Sayyid Káẓim wrote the commentary, which
exceeds 350 pages, in 1232/1816 at the request of certain
‘ulamá, whose names are not mentioned. Sayyid Káẓim in his
Dalíl al-Mutaḥayyirín states that his commentary on
Ṭutunjíya contains divine secrets that only a pure-hearted
and enlightened person could bear to understand.23 The
version of ‘Alí’s sermon he has used is that quoted by
Shaykh Rajab al-Ḥáfiẓ al-Bursí.24 In his commentary, Sayyid
Káẓim quotes the sermon phrase by phrase and follows each
quotation with an elaborate interpretation. The commentary
contains detailed a discussion of eschatological and
ontological issues as treated by Muslim scholars.
2\. Sharḥ al-Qaṣídat al-Lámíya

The Qaṣídat al-Lámíya was written by ‘Abd al-Báqí Afandí al-
Múṣilí25 in praise of Imám Músá al-Káẓim.26 Sayyid Káẓim
wrote his commentary on the Qaṣída in 1258/1842 at the
request of ‘Alí Riḍá Pashá, the governor of Baghdád. Sharḥ
al-Qaṣída is Sayyid Káẓim’s major work on broad Islamic
theological perspectives.27
3\. Dalíl al-Mutaḥayyirín

This work was written to explain Shaykhí views and to defend

Shaykhí ideology against the attacks of the ‘ulamá. The
book contains a biography of Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í, excerpts
from his ijázas, and comments on his character, his
achievements, and the hardships he suffered during his life.
Sayyid Káẓim explains points of dispute between the Shaykhís
and the Shí‘a and records in detail his confrontations with
the ‘ulamá. At the end of the book, he lists the works of
the Shaykh and then his own works, with a few words of
description about each.

Sayyid Káẓim, in addition to writing religious
treatises, educated hundreds of students, many of whom
became leading authorities on religion and participated
actively in social and religious struggles after he died.
The Makárim al-Áthár gives the names of several of Sayyid
Káẓim’s students,28 among whom are Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán
Kermání, the great Persian poetess Qurrat al-‘Ain, Mullá
Ḥusayn Boshro’í, and Shaykh ‘Alí Torshízí. All became
influential and distinguished leaders in the later develop-
ments of the Shaykhí school.

Unfortunately, Sayyid Káẓim did not live long enough to
witness the results of his achievements. He was forty-seven
years old when he became ill, or was poisoned,29 and died on
11 Dhí al-Ḥijja 1259/184330 in Karbalá.

He was survived by three children, a girl and two boys.

The most distinguished of them was Sayyid Aḥmad, who was
killed in 1295/1878 in ‘Atabát.31

Inspired and energetic, Sayyid Káẓim played such an

important role in the Shaykhí school that, when he died,
the movement that Shaykh Aḥmad had initiated, and which
Sayyid Káẓim had organized, disintegrated almost immediately.
His death, in fact, marked the beginning of a serious crisis
among his followers. The crisis centered on the issue of
successorship, for Sayyid Káẓim had not appointed anyone as
his successor, and this created disunity in his circle.

The disunity that appeared among the Shaykhís in this
period not only prevented the movement from any further
significant extension in size, but also weakened the solid-
arity of the school. This weakness, in turn, paved the way
for serious attacks of the Shí‘a on the Shaykhís.

The headquarters of the movement which had been
established in Karbala at the time of Shaykh Aḥmad and had
attracted hundreds of religious students at the time of
Sayyid Káẓim, now moved out of Karbalá and new centers were
established in Kermán and Ádharbáyján. They attracted fewer
students in general, and far fewer students from the Arab
lands. The new centers also lacked the scholarly reputation
that Karbalá had possessed at the time of Sayyid Káẓim. As
long as the Shaykhí school was based in Karbalá, the center
for Shí‘í scholarship, it had a direct connection with other
Islamic trends of thought, but the relocation of the
Shaykhís to Iran removed them from this direct contact with
the mainstream. The Shí‘a who considered the Shaykhís
heretics, may well have viewed this move out of Karbala as a
victory.

The transfer to Iran also brought about an important
change in the literature of the school: while Shaykh
Aḥmad had written his works entirely in Arabic and Sayyid
Káẓim wrote only a few books in Persian, the new Shaykhí
leaders now gradually began to write primarily in Persian
and for a largely non-Arab audience. The works of these
leaders did little more than review the Shaykhí ideology as
formulated in the works of Shaykh Aḥmad and elaborated in
the works of Sayyid Káẓim. There is nothing in their works
to compare with the originality and significance of the
writings of Shaykh Aḥmad and Sayyid Káẓim.

The most important of the drastic changes which
afflicted the school after the death of Sayyid Káẓim was
the lack of accepted leadership, which resulted in faction-
alism within the school. In his will,32 Sayyid Káẓim does
not mention a successor. However, he repeatedly emphasizes
two major points: the importance of unity among his
followers and the advent of the one whom Sayyid Káẓim terms
the “Sign of God” (Áyat Alláh) and the “Proof of God”
(Ḥujjat Alláh).33 In addition, he advises his followers in
these words:

> To awaken from the sleep of ignorance. Today is
> the day of examination and clarification. In such
> a day, one should hold on to the firmest handle,
> and beseech God that all gather together on the
> Day of Gathering34 [that is, the Day of Judgment]
> and disunity does not occur among you ….35
> Be careful not to take too much pride in your
> material possessions. On that day, he who is
> humble will be raised and he who is nighty will
> be lowered ….36 In each period [‘aṣr] here
> must be a Protector [walí] who carries out the

affairs of religion …. He [the walí] is the
> Sign of God and the Proof of God …. Earlier
> he came to you and taught you what you did not
> know ….37 There, undoubtedly, must be the
> appearance of Sign after Sign in every period
> ….38 Hold fast to the covenant of God and lay
> hold on the firmest handle,39 ask for success
> and guidance from God …. I beseech you to
> avoid disunity, because disunity cuts the tree
> of unity; it uproots the word of harmony and
> accord; it destroys the foundations of prophet-
> hood [nubuwwat]; and it shakes the pillars of
> successorship [wiláyat].40
The fact that Sayyid Káẓim did not appoint anyone as
his successor, and the fact that he urged his followers to
seek the walí, indicates that Sayyid Káẓim believed that the
advent of the walí was imminent, thus there was no need to
appoint a successor. Without an appointed successor, and
with no student who could win general acceptance within his
circle, as had been the case after the death of Shaykh Aḥmad,
disputes arose and various claimants to the succession
appeared. Among them two distinguished students of Sayyid
Káẓim were most prominent: Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán
Kermání
(d. 1288/1871) and Ḥájj Mirzá Shafí‘ Tabrízí.

It should be noted that the ideological viewpoint which
resulted in the division of the followers of Sayyid Káẓim
into two groups had to do primarily with the type of
leadership that each group sought. While Ḥájj Muḥammad
Karím Khán Kermání believed in individual leadership, Ḥájj
Mírzá Shafí‘ believed in ijtihád. This meant that Ḥájj
Muḥammad Karím Khán claimed, and was accepted by his
followers, to be the only individual leader of the Shaykhís
whose ideas were legitimized, whereas Mírzá Shafí‘ believed

that the Shaykhís should follow the principles of Shaykh
Aḥmad and Sayyid Káẓim but for daily religious questions,
should follow the examples of the Shí‘í recognized mujtahids
of their time.

It was about five months after the death of Sayyid
Káẓim, on 5 Jumádá al-Ulá 1260/1844, that Sayyid ‘Alí
Muḥammad Shirází declared himself to be the Báb (Gate) to
the advent of the Qá’im. Sayyid ‘Alí Muḥammad’s claim was
not connected with the crises of succession within the
Shaykhí school, but since he had attended Sayyid Káẓim’s
circle,41 and the advent of the Qá’im was predicted in the
Shaykhí writings,42 the claim of the Báb attracted many
students of the Shaykhí school, who became known as Bábís.43

The two groups of Shaykhís that emerged following the
death of Sayyid Káẓim, however, were to have a much differ-
ent relationship with the Bábí movement, opposing the claims
of the Báb and even actively participating in efforts to
crush the nascent movement.
Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán Kermání

and the Shaykhís of Kermán
The student of Sayyid Káẓim who won the largest number
of supporters was Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán Kermání.44 He
was the son of Muḥammad Ibráhím Khán Ẓahír al-Dawla, the
governor of Kermán and cousin of Fatḥ ‘Alí Sháh.

Muḥammad Karím Khán was born in 1225/1810 to a rich

family in Kermán.45 He received his elementary education in
the city of his birth and was a young man when he met a
certain Ḥájj Ismá‘íl,46 one of Sayyid Káẓim’s students.
During this meeting, he learned about the Shaykhí school and
became so attracted to it that he went to Karbalá and met
Sayyid Káẓim. He remained there for eight months47 and
attended Sayyid Kaẓim’s circle. Then he returned to Kermán.
After four years he made another trip to Karbalá, where he
stayed for two years.48 It was on his way back to Kermán
that he claimed to be the successor of Sayyid Káẓim and the
leader of the school. Except for a few trips to Tehrán and Mashhad,
he spent most of his time in Kermán teaching, preaching, and
writing books. In 1288/1871, as he was on his way to
Karbalá, he died in Tahrod, a village near Kermán. His
body, after remaining in Langar for one and half years, was
carried to Karbalá and buried there.

The majority of the Shaykhís in Kermán accepted Ḥájj
Muḥammad Karím Khán as the legitimate leader of the school
after Sayyid Káẓim. He considered himself as an inspired
leader who was acting in accordance with divine guidance,49
but his authority was based on the loyalty of his followers,
mainly the members of his family located in Kermán; he
never attracted the loyalty of all the followers of Sayyid
Kázim Rashtí.

The followers of Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán became known
as the Shaykhís of Kermán (Shaykhíya-i Kermán or Shaykhíya-i
Ḥájj Karím Khání) in contrast with the groups of Shaykhís in

Tabríz and Hamadán. He was a traditionalist Shaykhí who
remained loyal to the Shaykhí school. The school of Kermán
never entered into active revolt against the established
authorities. They were among the power elite of Kermán who
conservatively limited themselves to religious activities
mainly in that province. The Shaykhí leader of Kermán was,
in fact, the head of his clan, and the leadership of the
Shaykhís of Kermán has remained in the family of Ḥájj
Muḥammad Karím Khán to the present day. The successors of
Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán were his son Muḥammad Khán
(d. 1324/1906); Ḥájj Zayn al-‘Ábidín Khán (d. 1360/1941),
his other son; then Ḥájj Abú al-Qásim Khán (d. 1389/1969),50
the son of Ḥájj Zayn al-‘Ábidín Khán.51 Presently ‘Abd
al-Riḍá Ibráhímí, the son of Ḥájj Abú al-Qásim Khán, is the
leader of the school, and his headquarters are still in
Kermán.

When Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán appointed his son
Muḥammad Khán as his successor, a great Shaykhí scholar,
Mírzá Muḥammad Báqir Hamadání (d. 1319/1901), did not accept
the latter’s leadership. Mírzá Muḥammad Báqir b. Muḥammad
Ja‘far, originally from Iṣfahán but known as Hamadání
because he had resided in Hamadán for about thirty years,
was born in 1239/1823.52 He received his elementary
education in Iṣfahán and then joined Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím
Khán’s circle in Kermán. He studied with Ḥájj Muḥammad
Karím Khán, and became his devoted follower and then his
deputy in Hamadán.

Mírzá Muḥammad Báqir believed that successorship should
be given to the most learned member of the Shaykhí community—
i.e., himself!—not necessarily to a member of Ḥájj Muḥammad
Karím Khán’s family. This claim, which was supported by
many Shaykhís, particularly outside Kermán, brought into
being a new branch of Shaykhís under the leadership of Mírzá
Muḥammad Báqir, who considered himself to be the most
respected and learned Shaykhí after Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán.
His followers came to be known as the Báqirís, or the
Shaykhís of Hamadán. Mehdí Bámdád, in the Táríkh-i Rijál-i
Irán, states that after the separation of the Báqirís, the
followers of Ḥájj Muḥammad Khán became known as Naṭiqí
(adjective form derived from the noun náṭiq which literally
means speaker) or Nawáṭiq (plural of náṭiq).53 This
statement, however, is not supported by any other sources.

Mírzá Muḥammad Báqir wrote about 150 books and
treatises.54 His better known works are al-Ijtináb, written
in Persian in 1307/1899 to answer the polemical questions
‘Abd al-Ṣamad b. ‘Abá Alláh al-Ḥusayní al Mázandarání
(d. 1315/1897) had raised in his work, the Tiryáq-i Fárúq;55
and al-Uṣúl al-Díníya, a work written in Persian on Shí‘í
doctrines.56

In 1315/1897, there was an uprising against the
Shaykhís of Hamadán, during which Mírzá Muḥammad Báqir fled
to Náeín and subsequently made his residence in that area.
He died in 1319/1901 in Jandaq at the age of eighty.57

Mírzá Shafí‘ Tabrízí
and the Shaykhís of Tabríz
Mírzá Shafí‘ was a student of Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í and
Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí. As soon as he returned to Tabríz after
the death of Sayyid Káẓim, he established a Shaykhí circle
there, and members of his family and the nobility of Tabríz
supported him.58

Mírzá Shafí‘ b. Mírzá Rafí‘ was born in 1218/1803 and
lived for eighty-three years. He received the traditional
elementary education in his home town and then went to
‘Atabát to continue his education. In ‘Atabát he studied
with Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥasan Najafí, author of the Jawáhir
al-Kalám, the most important work on jurisprudence written
in this period, and then continued with Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí,
from whom he received his ijáza. Mírzá Shafí‘ was a
respected man of his time, known for his piety and know-
ledge.59 After his death, his son, Mírzá Músá, received his
father’s authority and led the school till 1319/1901, when
he died.

Of the twenty-one children that Mírzá Músá left behind,
Mírzá ‘Alí became the most famous. Born in 1277/1860 and
killed by the Russians in 1330/1912,60 he became known as
the Thiqat al-Islám-i Shahíd. He received his elementary
education from his grandfather Mírzá Shafí‘, and others,
and went to ‘Atabát for higher religious education.61 Upon
his return to Tabríz in 1308/1890 he became a respected,

learned man. With the death of his father, Mírzá Músá, in
1319/1901, he became the head of the Shaykhí school of
Tabríz. Mírzá ‘Alí was a distinguished scholar in religion
and literature. He was interested in new sciences, social
change and the socio-political issues of his time. His
interests led him to participate in the social affairs of
the country as a secular thinker.62 He wrote several books
such as the Risála-i Lálán, on social issues, and the
Mir’át al-Kutub, an immense biobibliography.63

Up to the time of Mírzá ‘Alí, sources report that in
Tabríz there was enmity between the Shaykhís and the Shí‘a.
Aḥmad Kasraví states that the bloody fighting which had
occurred earlier between the Shí‘a and the Shaykhís had
lessened, but in the years before the Constitutional
Movement, hatred still existed between them; they had
separate mosques, they would not intermarry,64 they
considered each other as najis (religiously impure), and
they would not use the same public baths.65 Through the
efforts of Mírzá ‘Alí, the deeply rooted enmity between the
Shaykhís and the Shí‘a was reduced,66 and later on, during
the uprising of the masses for the Constitutional Movement,
the two parties came together against despotism, and the
gap was bridged.67

The Shaykhís of Tabríz never succeeded in obtaining
hegemony over all the Shaykhís, but immediately following
the death of Sayyid Káẓim they attracted those students of
his who held more anti-traditionalist views. In contrast

with the Shaykhís of Kermán, the Shaykhís of Tabríz were
very much involved in the current socio-political issues of
the province of Ádharbáyján, where they had a close relation-
ship with the royal family residing there and engaged in the
public affairs of the society. This involvement manifested
itself most clearly at the time of Mírzá ‘Alí, who came out
publicly against the established authorities and institu-
tions and received the support of his adherents. This
developed into an active rebellion against the established
order and ultimately led to the Constitutional Movement.
In contrast with the leaders of the Shaykhís of Kermán,
who claimed to enjoy the inspired leadership of their
community, the leaders of the Shaykhís of Tabríz never, made
such a claim. While the leadership of the Shaykhís of
Kermán was centered in an acknowledged individual, the
Shaykhís of Tabríz lacked a universally accepted individual
leader.

In contrast with the Uṣúlí ‘ulamá of Tabríz and the
Shaykhís of Kermán, who were among the local notables with
considerable landed property and other investments and
lived in luxury, the Shaykhís of Tabríz lived a moderate
life.68
Sayyid ‘Alí Muḥammad Shirází, The Báb

and the Bábís
Within a short period after Sayyid Káẓim’s death,

Sayyid ‘Alí Muḥammad declared himself to be the Báb (Gate)
to the twelfth Imám for whom the Shí‘a in general and the
Shaykhís in particular had been waiting.

Sayyid ‘Alí Muḥammad Shírází was born into a respected
merchant family of Shíráz on the first of Muḥarram 1235/
1819\.69 Orphaned at an early age, he was raised by his
maternal uncle, Sayyid ‘Alí. He received his formal
elementary education in his home town and then, as a young
man, went into business with his uncle, who was also a
merchant. In 1257/1941, Sayyid ‘Alí Muḥammad made a
pilgrimage to ‘Atabát where he stayed for 11 months.70
There he met Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí and attended his circle.
Upon his return to Shíráz, he proclaimed himself the Báb on
(5 Jumádá al-Ulá 1260/23 of May 1844). He made his declar-
ation to Mullá Ḥusayn Boshro’í, an eminent student in the
Shaykhí circle, saying, “O thou who art the first to believe
in Me! Verily I say, I am the Báb, the Gate of God, and
thou art the Bábu’l-Báb, the gate of that Gate. Eighteen
souls must, in the beginning, spontaneously and of their own
accord, accept Me and recognize the truth of My Revelation.”71
Shortly after this event, seventeen other people became
believers and, along with Mullá Ḥusayn Boshro’í, formed the
Letters of the Living (Ḥurúf-i Ḥayy; the numerical value of
the word Ḥayy is 18). The Letters of the Living, most of
whom were Shaykhís, as the first disciples of the Báb were
given the task of proclaiming his advent throughout the
country. Through the Báb’s writings, which were addressed

to religious and secular leaders,72 and through the efforts
of his disciples, the Báb’s message spread and within only
six years reached every corner of Iran, attracted the atten-
tion of thousands, and became the main issue of the day.

The ‘ulamá, threatened by the new message, the implica-
tion of which was nothing short of undermining the tradi-
tional order and the authority of the mujtahids, used all
their resources to destroy the Báb and his followers. The
state joined the ‘ulamá in its efforts. As a result, thou-
sands of Bábí men, women, and children were murdered in the
most horrible circumstances. Lord Curzon, in his Persia and
the Persian Question, writes: “Tales of magnificent heroism
illumine the bloodstained pages of Bábí history … and
the fires of Smithfield did not kindle a nobler courage than
has met and defied the more refined torturemongers of
Tehran.”73

The Báb himself, subjected to imprisonment during his
six years of ministry, was sentenced to death and executed
in 1266/1849 by a firing squad in Tabríz.

The term “Báb” which Sayyid ‘Alí Muḥammad applied to
himself, was familiar to the people of his time. It had
been used by Muslims of various sects for several centuries.
As Huart points out,

> Báb, an Arabic word signifying “gate”, early re-
> ceived among the Ṣúfís the meaning of the “gate
> by which one enters, means of communication with
> that which is within” and was applied to prominent
> Shaikhs. Among the Ismá‘ílís, this word is used
> symbolically for the Shaikh or spiritual leader,
> who initiates into the mysteries of religion, the

asás; among the Nuṣairís. Salmán al-Fárisí, who
> was entrusted with the Propaganda, is the Báb.
> The Druses call by this name the first spiritual
> minister, who embodies universal reason.74
Among the Shí‘a the tern Báb was assigned to Four Gates
(al-Abwáb al-Arba‘a), four people who claimed to be inter-
mediaries between the Hidden Imám and the believers during
the Lesser Occultation.75 The term is used in almost the
same sense in Shaykhí writings. On the basis of Shí‘í
Traditions, Shaykh Aḥmad in his Sharḥ al-Ziyára states that
the Prophet Muḥammad—and the Prophet’s knowledge—is like a
house and that the imáms are like the doors (al-abwáb) to
it.76 Shaykh Aḥmad quotes a famous Tradition on the
authority of the Prophet which reads, “I am the city of
knowledge and ‘Alí is its Gate.”77

In his account of the concept of ma‘rifa (knowledge),
Shaykh Aḥmad states that it exists on six levels:
1\.   The knowledge of the oneness of God
2\.   The knowledge of al-ma‘ání (the meanings)
3\.   The knowledge of al-abwáb (the gates)
4\.   The knowledge of al-imám (the imáms)
5\.   The knowledge of al-arkán (the pillars)
6\.   The knowledge of al-nuqabá (the guardians)
7\.   The knowledge of al-nujabá (the helpers)78

Then, Shaykh Aḥmad provides details about each level, saying
that in the terminology of the Illuminists (Ahl al-Ishráq)
“gate” is equal to the First Intellect, and in the termin-
ology of the religious scholars (Ahl al-Shar‘) it is equal

to the Pen (al-Qalam) or the Muslim Intellect (al-‘Aql
al-Muḥammadí), which is the gate between God and His
creation.79

Shaykh Aḥmad and Sayyid Káẓim were known to their
students as the gates. Qurrat al-‘Ain, in her treatises,
refers to them by the term “the two gates” (al-bábayn).80
She also refers to Sayyid Káẓim as “The earlier gate of God”
(báb Alláh al-muqaddam)81 in comparison to Sayyid ‘Alí
Muḥammad, who appeared later. Sayyid ‘Alí Muḥammad also
refers to Shaykh Aḥmad and Sayyid Káẓim as “báb”. In his
Qayyúm al-Asmá, his first work, Sayyid ‘Alí Muḥammad writes,
“O ye peoples of the earth! During the time of My absence I
sent down the Gates unto you. However the believers, except
for a handful, obeyed them not. Formerly I sent forth unto
you Aḥmad and more recently Káẓim, but apart from the pure
in heart amongst you no one followed them.”82

The term “báb”, however, became best known as the title
for Sayyid ‘Alí Muḥammad, who at the very beginning of his
mission identified himself as the Gate through which men
might attain to the knowledge of the Twelfth Imám,83 the
expected Qá’im. In his first work, the Qayyúm al-Asmá,
however, he frequently referred to himself by the term “Gate
of God”. The Báb writes: “As to those who deny Him Who is
the Sublime Gate of God, for them We have prepared, as
justly decreed by God, a sore torment. And He, God, is the
Mighty, the Wise.”84 And also, “I am the ‘Gate of God’ and
I give you to drink, by the leave of God, the sovereign

Truth, of the crystal-pure waters of His Revelation ….”85

The title of “Gate to the Twelfth Imám” was only
employed in the very early period of his mission. Other
titles such as the “Gate of God”, “Remembrance of God”,86
and “The Point of the Bayán”,87 however, are used more
frequently throughout his works.

Although the Báb originally claimed to be the “Gate to
the Twelfth Imám”, later, in his most important work, the
Persian Bayán, he claimed to be the Twelfth Imám, the Qá’im.
himself.88 In his Dalá’il al-Sab‘89 he explains the reason
for this change:

> Consider the manifold favours vouchsafed by the
> Promised One, and the effusions of His bounty
> which have pervaded the concourse of the follow-
> ers of Islám to enable them to attain unto salva-
> tion. Indeed observe how He Who representeth the
> origin of creation, He Who is the Exponent of the
> verse, “I, in very truth, am God”, identified Him-
> self as the Gate (Báb) for the advent of the pro-
> mised Qá’im, a descendant of Muḥammad, and in His
> first Book enjoined the observance of the laws
> of the Qur’án, so that the people might not be
> seized with perturbation by reason of a new Book
> and a new Revelation and might regard His Faith
> as similar to their own, perchance they would not
> turn away from the Truth and ignore the thing for
> which they had been called into being.90
Although the titles are different, the essence of his
message was that he was a new messenger with a new Revealed
Book and a new order for a new day: his main concern was
not the perpetuation or revival of Islam, but the birth of
a new order.

The Bábí movement was a forward-looking religious
ideology which sprang out of Shaykhí soil. Since Shaykhí

writings had prepared the ground for such a declaration,
many of the early believers in the Báb were, like his first
disciples the Letters of the Living, Shaykhís.

The earliest Shaykhís who accepted the Báb were those
who had rejected Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán and Mírzá
Muḥammad
Shafí‘ as leaders of the school on the grounds that they
were not qualified to occupy such a position or because
there was no indication in the writings of Sayyid Káẓim
regarding the successorship. They argued that, since the
appearance of the Qá’im was at hand, Sayyid Káẓim had not
appointed anyone as his successor; rather, he had encouraged
his students to seek for the Qá’im. If the Shaykhís were
supposed to have a leader after Sayyid Káẓim, he would have
been wise enough to appoint one. This attitude was well
supported in the writings of Sayyid Káẓim himself.

The Shaykhís who believed in the Báb saw in him the
fulfillment of Shaykh Aḥmad’s and Siyyid Káẓim’s predictions
and, thus, there remained no reason for them to reject him.
This group of Shaykhís, who formed the nucleus of the Bábís,
were among the most learned students of Sayyid Káẓim.
Among the early adherents of the Báb were such distinguished
personalities as Qurrat al-‘Ain, Mullá Ḥusayn Boshro’í,
Shaykh Muḥammad Taqí Hashtrodí, and Mullá ‘Alí Baraghání.

The Bábís traveled tirelessly throughout the country,
meeting with religious authorities in various cities, in
mosques, in madrasas, and in private gatherings, where they
talked about the Báb and his new movement. They also wrote

books and treatises to demonstrate that the advent of the
Báb was in accordance with the Qur’án, the Islamic Tradi-
tions, and particularly with Shaykhí predictions. Their
energetic efforts to publicize the claims of the Báb
attracted thousands of Persians to his movement.

The early Bábís who actively participated in proclaim-
ing the Báb’s mission came from all levels of Iranian
society: merchants, peasants, landowners, goverment
employees, and the learned class. The number of Bábís from
each group and their role, in relation to the others, in
spreading the new faith requires further study. It is clear,
however, that the leadership of the Bábís in their social
organization and efforts to propagate their faith was in the
hands of the newly converted ‘ulamá, particularly the
Shaykhí ‘ulamá.

Just as the basic reason for accepting the Báb’s claim
was religious, Shí‘í attacks against the Bábís were also
motivated by religion, for the appearance of the Báb did not
fulfill the exoteric aspect of the prophecies recorded in
the Shí‘í texts. The Shí‘a were expecting the Qá’im to
return from the cold-chamber of Sámarrá, where he went for
occultation, but now they were confronted instead with a
young man from Shíráz who claimed to be the Qá’im. Indeed,
none of the exoteric signs predicted for the advent of the
Qá’im materialized in the appearance of Sayyid ‘Alí
Muḥammad, the Báb.

In addition, in his Persian Bayán, the Báb came out

against certain common Muslim practices either enjoined in
the Qur’án or the Traditions, or based upon them. For
example, he prohibited congregational prayer except in the
case of prayers for the dead.91 He also changed Islamic
regulations on marriage, divorce, fasting, and inheritance.92
Most important, he denied the validity of the Quranic law
against usury, maintaining that interest on money may be
taken.93 These teachings of the Báb, completely different
than those of the Qur’án, were too much for the ordinary
Shí‘í believers to accept. In addition, the Shí‘í religious
and secular authorities regarded them as an obvious threat
to their position and mobilized their resources to destroy
the Báb and his followers.

While a number of Shaykhís converted to the Báb and
actively proclaimed his mission, the Shaykhís of Kermán and
Tabríz rose against the Bábís. In fact, these two groups of
Shaykhís, who had been ideologically in conflict with one
another, joined in opposition to the Báb. The nature of
their opposition, however, differed: while the Shaykhís of
Kermán expressed their opposition mainly on an intellectual
level in books and treatises directed against the Báb and
his ideology, the Shaykhís of Tabríz actively cooperated
with state authorities in the persecution of the Báb himself
and his followers. Both groups of Shaykhís rejected the
Báb’s claim to be a new prophet with a new book of laws and
regulations94 and responded with hostility to his claim
that he had received a direct revelation from God and that

his word was the revealed word of God.95

The most important Shaykhí to raise objections against
the Báb was his great antagonist, Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán.
He devoted at least four books entirely to this task,
writing three of them within five years of the Báb’s
advent,96 He also attacked the Báb in several other works.
All these works are basic sources for understanding the
intellectual opposition to the Báb and his ideology.

A comprehensive and convenient synopsis of the charges
leveled against the Báb is Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán’s Risála
dar Radd-i Báb-i Murtáb, which he wrote at the request of
Náṣir al-Dín Sháh Qájár. In this book, written in 1283/1866,
about two decades later than his other works in refutation
of the Báb, Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán accuses the Báb of
several heresies. In summary, Ḥájj Karím Khán charges that,
1\. The Báb claimed to be the deputy of the Hidden Imám;

> later he claimed to be the Hidden Imám himself. Still
> later he claimed to be a prophet with his own religion.

Finally, he claimed to be God.
2\. The Báb frequently claimed to have received a revela-

tion as the Prophet Muḥammad did.
3\. The Báb claimed that he was superior to the Prophet and

that his book was superior to the Qur’án.
4\. The Báb claimed to have a new Qur’án. He introduced

> innovations; he forbade what the Qur’án considered
> lawful and permitted what it considered unlawful. He
> instituted laws which contradicted Quranic laws.

5. The Báb considered himself as the only legitimate

> person, in whom everyone should believe. He ordered
> people to Holy War (jihád); he permitted the blood of
> his enemies to be shed; he requested that the Muslims
> who did not believe in him be executed.
6\. The Báb stated that the Day of Resurrection had come

> and that the Return had passed. By this statement he
meant that they had occurred with his appearance.

> (This was the most blatant statement of abrogation of
> the creed of his society and was an immediate line of
> demarcation between his followers and the Shí‘í
> community.)
7\. The Báb claimed that meeting with him was like meeting

with God.
8\. The Báb said that the realm of isthmus (barzakh) is the

period before the appearance of a new prophet of God.
Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán also states in his book that
the Báb wrote a letter to him in his own handwriting and
sent it to him by courier.97 In the letter, Ḥájj Muḥammad
Karím Khán says, the Báb solicited his support and requested
him to ask the mu’adhdhins to include his name in the
adhán.98 When the courier came, Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán
continues, he argued with him, giving him reasons for being
unable to accept the Báb’s request. Then, Ḥájj Muḥammad
Karím Khán says, he sent him back disappointed and miser-
able.99

At the end of his book, Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán states

that according to the Báb’s writings the Shaykhís are
enemies of the Bábís, and that the Báb has warned his
followers not to make friends among the Shaykhís or to read
Shaykhí writings. Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán asserts that it
should be clear that there is no similarity between the
Bábís and the Shaykhís. The Shaykhís, he says, have always
hated the Bábís and have written books to refute them. The
Shaykhís have always been loyal to the government, to
Muslims, and to the household of the Prophet.100 The last
statement of Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán implies, of course,
disloyalty on the part of the Bábís.

The opposition of the Shaykhís of Kermán to the Báb and
his followers did not remain on an intellectual level. It
is reported that Mullá Káẓim b. Yúsuf, one of Muḥammad Karím
Khán’s learned followers, became a follower of the Báb and,
in a mosque where Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán and other
Shaykhís were present, expressed his belief in the validity
of the Báb’s claim to be the Qá’im. Upon this expression,
which was followed by words of praise for the Báb and his
movement, Ḥájj Ghulám ‘Alí Khán, the brother of Ḥájj
Muḥammad Karím Khán, seized Mullá Káẓim and beat him so
severely that he died a few days later.101

The opposition of the Shaykhís of Tabríz to the Báb
reflected their strong ties with the political authorities
of the province in that period. In contrast to the
opposition of the Shaykhís of Kermán, which was mostly
intellectual, their opposition took the form of torturing

the Báb and his followers and finally of issuing a religious
decree for the Báb’s death. When the Báb was brought from
his prison in Chehríq to Tabríz for trial, the ‘ulamá in
charge of the interrogation were Shaykhí leaders: Ḥájj
Mullá Maḥmúd Tabrízí, known as Niẓám al-‘Ulamá (d. 1273/
1856), Mullá Muḥammad Mamaqání (d. 1269/1852), and Mírzá
‘Alí Aṣghar Shaykh al-Islám (d. 1278/1861).102

Niẓám al-‘Ulamá was the head of the court and the
teacher of Náṣir al-Dín Sháh. He wrote about the trial, and
his account was used by Riḍá Qolí Khán Hidáyat in his Rawḍat
al-Ṣafá as well as by I‘timád al-Salṭana in his al-
Mutanabi’ín.103
Mullá Muḥammad Mamaqání was a leading Shaykhí authority
in Tabríz and one of those who claimed to be the successor
of Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí. His sons later became the leaders
of opposition to the Bábís. Under the pen name of Nayyir,104
one of his sons, Mírzá Muḥammad Taqí (d. 1312/1894), wrote
a book against the Bábís entitled Ṣaḥífat al-Abrár. Written
in 1290/1873 and published in 1319/1901,105 it contains the
proceedings of the interrogation of the Báb.106

Mírzá ‘Alí Aṣghar Shaykh al-Islám, another participant
in the interrogation, was a Shaykhí leader in Ádharbáyján.
It was he who took the Báb to his home after the trial and
administered a beating to him. Mírzá ‘Alí Aṣghar died in
1278/1861 at the age of ninety-six, but enmity against the
Báb remained in his family and found an expression in a
polemic against the Báb written by his son, Mírzá Abú

al-Qásim, entitled Qal‘ al-Báb.107

The Shaykhís were the first group in Persian society to
react to the claims of the Báb. Some of them became his
most important supporters, disseminated his teachings
around the country, wrote works to prove that he was indeed
the expected one, and tirelessly invited people to join the
Bábí movement. They believed that the spirit of the Qur’án
and the essence of Islam had been revealed again in the
writings of the Báb and that the predictions concerning the
appearance of the Qá’im had been fulfilled allegorically.
For these Shaykhís, Shaykh Aḥmad and Sayyid Káẓim were
divinely guided figures who had paved the way for the Báb
and enabled them to recognize the one for whom they had
been waiting.

In contrast, another group of Shaykhís rose against the
Báb, led the opposition to him, and did their best to pre-
vent the Bábí movement from spreading. They saw in the
Báb’s teachings new laws and regulations which were in many
cases different from, or even contrary to, the teachings of
the Qur’án. They maintained that none of the predictions
regarding the Qá’im had been fulfilled literally in the
coming of the Báb. Therefore, in their eyes the Báb was
false and an enemy of Islam who had risen to establish an
order different from the Quranic order. This, in their
opinion, was an obvious “infidelity” (kufr), for they
maintained that the Qur’án and Islam were to last for
eternity.

VI
Shaykhí teachings that paved the way

for the Báb
The Shaykhí school provided the background for the Bábí
movement and its doctrines prepared the way for those of the
Báb. The social and intellectual relationship between the
Shaykhí school and the Bábí movement is beyond dispute: the
earliest and most learned followers of the Báb were Shaykhí
students,1 and the Báb himself, while a resident in Karbalá,
attended the circle of Sayyid Káẓim. Moreover, his works
reveal a thorough understanding of Shaykhí literature, ideas,
and terminology.

The Báb and Bábí historians in their writings represent
Shaykh Aḥmad and Sayyid Káẓim as forerunners of the Báb,2
divinely inspired persons who prophesied the appearance of
the Báb and prepared their students for the recognition of
the expected Qá’im.3

While no one can doubt that the Shaykhí ideas created
an intellectual atmosphere conducive to the acceptance of
the Báb, it is necessary to examine the nature of the
Shaykhí predisposition which ultimately resulted in the
conversion of certain Shaykhís into Bábís. For the sake of
historical perspective it is important to remember that
Shaykhí patterns of belief were not the only cause of
conversion. The charismatic personality of the Báb, as well
as social, political, and cultural factors, played vital

roles in it. This chapter will focus on the theological and
intellectual considerations that led a great number of
Shaykhís to the Bábí movement. These factors are important
not only for understanding the Shaykhí-Bábí relationship,
but especially for revealing the strong links between Islam
and the Bábí faith, the strongest of which is the Shaykhí
school.

In his various works, Shaykh Aḥmad devoted much
attention to the concept of the imamate, a subject on which
he received numerous questions from his students. These
dialogues indicate that this subject was the focal point of
discussion and investigation in his circle. Such discus-
sions of the imamate naturally led to the consideration of
related issues: (1) the finality of the Prophet, (2) the
Day of Judgment, and (3) predictions regarding the
appearance of the Qá’im, which was expected to occur
imminently.4

According to traditional Muslim belief, the Prophet
Muḥammad is the last prophet: there will be none after him,
and prophecy is sealed by his mission. The basis for this
doctrine is found in the following verse of the Qur’án:
“Muḥammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is
the Apostle of Allah and the seal of the Prophets; and Allah
is Cognizant of all things.” (33:40) Although the Shaykhís
do not entirely reject the concept of the finality of the
Prophet Muḥammad, it appears that their understanding of
this question led to a new approach toward the concept of

finality.

According to the Shaykhí theory, a prophetic cycle
began with Adam and continued to the Prophet Muḥammad.
During this Adamic cycle, six major prophets appeared: Adam,
Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muḥammad. While most
Muslims believe that Muḥammad was the last Prophet, Shaykh
Aḥmad maintains that he was the last Prophet only within
this cycle. The Shaykh expresses his idea by making use of
the cabalistic system: he explains that the letter wáw (‫)و‬,
when pronounced, consists of a consonant “‫”و‬,an “‫”ا‬
(alif) and another “‫”و‬. The first “‫”و‬, which has a
numerical value of six according to the abjad system,5
stands for the six prophets in the Adamic cycle. The “‫”ا‬
(alif), which stands between the two wáws, represents the
Qá’im (literally, the word Qá’im means “standing”), and the
second “‫ ”و‬represents the prophet who will follow the Qá’im
and will be a new manifestation of God, identified as the
Second Christ or the Return of Ḥusayn. The Qá’im, thus,
stands between the six previous prophets and the one who
will succeed him, like the “‫( ”ا‬alif) which stands between
the two wáws.6

Shaykh Aḥmad’s view of Muḥammad as the final only
within the Adamic cycle implies a continuing divine
revelation through a succession of prophets in a series of
cycles; while each cycle has a beginning and an end, the
cyclic process itself is progressive and continuous. This
concept of continuity, as opposed to the traditional theory

of finality, is expressed most clearly in the sections of
the Shaykhí works devoted to the concept of absolute
correspondence between the realm of creation (takwín) and
the realm of religion (tashrí‘).7 According to this
concept, the pattern of creation as a whole corresponds to
the pattern of religion. The Shaykh offers an example of
such correspondence in the development of an embryo, which
must pass through various stages in the womb of its mother
before it is born into this world. The Qur’án (23:13–14)
tells us that the embryo develops through six stages,
namely: (1) life-germ (nuṭfa), (2) clot (‘alaqa), (3) a
morsel of flesh (muḍgha), (4) bones (‘iẓám), (5) flesh
(laḥm), and (6) another creation (khalqan ákhar), during
which stage the spirit enters the body. Just as the embryo
develops through various stages, human spiritual progress is
a developmental process, each stage of which corresponds to
the appearance of a prophet whose divine revelation advances
the spiritual condition of mankind. According to the
Shaykhí view, the six stages of embryonic development
corresponds to the six prophets who appeared in the Adamic
cycle: the stage of the life-germ corresponds to Adam; the
stage of the clot, to Noah; the stage of the morsel of
flesh, to Abraham; the stage of the bones, to Moses; the
stage of the flesh, to Jesus; and the stage of another
creation, to Muḥammad.8

Following the analogy further, as the first five
stages of embryonic development are prerequisite to the

entrance of the spirit into the body, the first five
religions are perceived as performing a preparatory function
for the religion of the Prophet Muḥammad.9

The last stage of the development of an embryo is final
only in respect to its life in the womb, for the now com-
pletely developed embryo will be born into another world.
Likewise, although the sixth stage of the Adamic cycle,
i.e., the Prophet Muḥammad, is the last stage of its cycle,
it is, at the same time, the beginning of a new phase in the
spiritual development of mankind and marks the inception of
a new cycle.

The Shaykhí concept of continuity as opposed to
finality is also supported by a more general correspondence
that Shaykh Aḥmad maintains exists between the realm of
creation (takwín) and the realm of religion (tashrí‘). The
Qur’án says that creation took place in six days: “And He
it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days ….”
(11:7) Each one of these days, according to Shaykh Aḥmad,
corresponds to a stage of embryonic development as well as
to a stage in the formation of the universe.10

Although this schema may appear to suggest finality,
continuity may easily be inferred from it, for the final
stage of a cycle can also be seen as the beginning of a new
cycle.

That the Prophet Muḥammad completed the Adamic cycle and
began a new cycle is clearly expressed by Sayyid Káẓim in
his explanation of the two Arcs which he believes exist in
the spiritual life of mankind: (1) the Arc of Ascent
(Ṣu‘úd) and (2) the Arc of Descent (nuzúl).11 The Arc of
Ascent begins with Adam and ends with the Prophet Muḥammad,
who is also the opener (fátiḥ) of the Arc of Descent.
According to this idea, Muḥammad occupies the highest level
of the Arc of Ascent and, thus, is the most exalted one:
Muḥammad was the Prophet with whom prophecy ended; he was
the best Prophet among the prophets; and his religion
abrogated all the previous religions. However, he was also

the opener of the Arc of Descent, in which other prophets
will come.

Any implication of finality in these explanations
appears to refer to the perfection of the Prophet Muḥammad
and his religion, in relation to other prophets and
religions: that is, the process of the revelation of God’s
religion, which commenced with Adam, reached its most
perfect form in the prophethood of Muḥammad and the
revelation of the Qur’án. But this does not necessarily
imply that Muḥammad would be the last prophet ever to
appear. Thus, the Shaykhís’ reinterpretation of the
traditional Muslim concept of the finality of the Prophet
may well have prepared many Shaykhís to accept the Báb as
the founder of a new religion.

A second factor in creating intellectual readiness for
accepting the Báb was the Shaykhí view that the day of the
appearance of the Qá’im would be the Day of Judgment.
Unlike the Shí‘a, who believe that the advent of the Qá’im
will simply be one among the numerous events which will take
place on the Day of Judgment, the Shaykhís hold that the
appearance of the Qá’im is the Day of Judgment.12 Thus, to
say that Islam will last until the Day of Judgment is true
in the sense that Islam will last until the Qá’im appears.

The Shaykhí identification of the Day of Judgment with
the coming of the Qá’im placed a great significance on this
event. Belief in the Day of Judgment is one of the
conditions for being a Muslim, and preparation for this day

is the goal of every believer. Since it is the day on which
all shall be punished or rewarded according to their deeds,
and shall be consigned to hell or to paradise, it is
difficult to conceive of any event more crucial in the
religious life of a Muslim. When the Day of Judgment was
interpreted to be the day of the advent of the Qá’im, as
the Shaykhís maintained, the attention of the adherents of
the Shaykhí school was focused on the expectation of his
coming, instead of on the traditional Day of Judgment.

Although the emphasis that Shaykh Aḥmad placed on the
station of the imáms, along with his approach toward the
concepts of the finality of the Prophet and the Day of
Judgment, provided the background for the expectation of the
Qá’im, his prophecies particularly directed the Shaykhís’
attention to the recognition of the Báb. In fact, Shaykh
Aḥmad’s most important achievement in preparing his students
for the advent of the Qá’im was his prophecies, which were
elaborated in the works of Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí. In this
regard, Sayyid Káẓim’s Will is particularly important.13
Although in his Will Sayyid Káẓim uses the term Walí
(Protector), not Qá’im, his description of the Walí is the
name as his description of the Qá’im in other works. In
his Will Sayyid Káẓim does not go into detail to prophesy
the name of the Walí or the exact date of his coming, but
he clearly states that for every period (‘aṣr) there is a
Walí and the appearance of the Walí will never cease. The
day of the advent of the Walí, in Sayyid Káẓim’s terminology,

will be the Day of Gathering together (yaum al-jam‘),14

another name for the Day of Judgment. The day of the advent
will witness great changes and upheavals. The one who will
appear is the Sign of God (Áyat Alláh), who will come with
proofs. He will arise among people as did the Prophet
Muḥammad. These statements indicate that Sayyid Káẓim did
not believe that the Twelfth Imám would return from
occultation as the Qá’im; rather, he believed that the Qá’im
was living among people and would appear as the Prophet
Muḥammad did.

In his Will, Sayyid Káẓim, after advising his students
to be steadfast, pious, unified, and detached from material
life, quotes a Quranic verse which reads, “It alters the
mortal. Over it are nineteen angels.” (74:29–30) Although
Sayyid Káẓim does not explicitly state his purpose in
quoting the verse, it has been interpreted as an allusion to
the Báb and his first eighteen followers, The Letters of the
Living (Ḥurúf-i Ḥayy), who formed the first unit (wáḥid-i
Awwal) of the Bábís.

Before examining the Shaykhí prophecies in more detail,
it is necessary to consider the conception of the advent of
the Mahdí and the Second Christ in Islam in general, and in
the Twelver Shí‘a literature in particular.15

There is no mention of a Mahdí in the Qur’án, nor is
there any mention in the earliest Traditions. Later
Traditions say that the Mahdí will appear before the world
comes to its end and will inaugurate a new era of prosperity

and salvation, functioning as a ruler, renewing all things,
and establishing peace and justice on earth. The advent of
the Mahdí is to be preceded or accompanied by various signs.

In Islam, the term Mahdí is a title for a Divinely
Guided One, equivalent to the messiah, the deliverer. While
for the Sunnís the Mahdí does not refer to any specific
person, the Twelver Shí‘a identify him with the Twelfth
Imám, who went into occultation in 260/872.16 For them,
therefore, the return of the Twelfth Imám is identical with
the advent of the Mahdí. Shí‘í literature contains
literally hundreds of Traditions on the authority of the
Shí‘í Imáms, concerning different aspects of the Mahdí’s
private and social life, character, and function. However,
these Traditions are inconsistent regarding his name, his
descent, the year of this appearance, and his physical and
spiritual qualifications. For example, we find him given
such varied titles as “The Qá’im”17 (The one who rises),
“Baqíyat Alláh”18 (The Remnant of God), “Ṣáḥib al-Zamán”19
(The Lord of the Age), and “al-Muntaẓar”20 (The Expected
One).

Muḥammad Báqir Majlisí (d. 1111/1700), compiler of the
Biḥár al-Anwár, the lengthiest and most comprehensive
collection of Shí‘í Traditions, has denoted the thirteenth
volume of this work to Traditions on the Mahdí. These
Traditions almost unanimously affirm that the world will not
end until a man from the family of the Prophet, in the line
of ‘Alí and Fáṭima, appears. He will rule according to the

example of the Prophet. The Qá’im will come at a time of
great troubles when the world is approaching its end. There
will be an increasing number of hard-hearted evildoers. The
Qá’im will make efforts to establish justice and equity and
repel tyranny and oppression. He will cause the strong and
the weak to be as equals; he will bring salvation to earth.
Through his efforts, Islam will spread throughout the world.

The Traditions declare that the Qá’im is the one
through whom God will manifest His faith. He is the one
whom God “will make victorious over the whole world until
from every place the call to prayer will be heard, and all
religion will be to Allah.”21 The Qá’im is described as the
champion of the faith, who will strengthen God’s religion.
He is the means by which God proves His existence to His
creation. Without the Qá’im the world cannot function.
Such a Leader is needed, whether manifest and well known or
hidden and obscure.

The Qá’im will fulfill God’s promises. He is to be
sent by God to prepare the way for the Return of Christ.
The Twelver Shí‘a believe in the Mahdí and his return as an
essential element of their faith. In the Shí‘í Traditions,
a great number of Quranic verses are interpreted as
references to the Qá’im.22

The Shaykhí prophecies are mostly based on the Shí‘í
Traditions. Shaykh Aḥmad and Sayyid Káẓim, however, added
to the prophecies of the Traditions by elaborating them.
Shaykhí prophecies are the most abstruse parts of the

Shaykhí works, employing figurative concepts, the abjad
system, and anagrams. Very rarely can a straightforward
prophecy be found. The complexity and the equivocal nature
of the prophecies suggest that only people familiar with
Shaykhí terminology and doctrines could understand them;
other people would be able to do so only through oral
explanations. The complexity is due to the social and
religious climate of the time, which did not allow the
Shaykhí leaders to openly provide information in plain
language about the Qá’im. It is reported that once Sayyid
Káẓim was asked by one of his students, “‘Why is it, that
you neither reveal His [i.e., the Qá’im’s] name nor identify
His Person?’ To this Siyyid replied by pointing with his
finger to his own throat, implying that were he to divulge
His name, they both would be put to death instantly.”23

Shaykhí prophecies are so numerous, so repetitious,
and so widespread throughout the Shaykhí works that it seems
hopeless to try to put all of them into a system or present
them in a form that encompasses all the details. The
prophecies speak about two distinct persons who would appear
one after another: the Qá’im and the Return of Ḥusayn. The
prophecies concerning the Qá’im’s name, characteristics,
date of his advent, and the circumstances under which he
will appear are by far more numerous than the prophecies
concerning the Return of Ḥusayn.

As in Shí‘í Traditions, the Qá’im is also referred to
by other titles, such as Ṣáḥib al-Zamán (The Lord of the

Age), Ḥujjat Alláh (Proof of God), Baqíyat Alláh (The
Remnant of God), Dhikr (The Remembrance), and, more
commonly, Mahdí (The Divinely Guided One).

Shaykhí prophecies on the Qá’im are of two kinds:
prophecies which closely repeat the popular expectations of
the Shí‘a concerning the coming of the Qá’im and prophecies
which are not literally in accordance with popular expecta-
tions. In the prophecies of the first kind, the Twelfth
Imám is alive and present in the world, but invisible. He
is the son of Ḥasan al-‘Askarí (d. 260/872), the Eleventh
Imám, from the family of the Prophet. The Qá’im, therefore,
is identified as the Twelfth Imám. The advent of the Qá’im
will be accompanied by the Return of the imáms as well as
their enemies. In the year of the arrival of the Qá’im,
the following events will occur: there will be a serious
famine, heavy rain will fall from the twentieth day of the
month of Jumádá to the beginning of Rajab. The Dajjál, or
Antichrist—the False Messiah, who performs miracles and
pretends that he is God—will appear in Iṣfahán in the month
of Rajab, and the Sufyání, ‘Uthmán b. ‘Utba, will appear in
Ramla in wádí Yábis. In the same month of Rajab, the body
of ‘Alí will be manifested in the disk of the sun and it
will be possible for everyone to recognize him. There will
be an eclipse of the moon at the end of the month of
Ramaḍán. There will also be an eclipse of the sun on the
fifth (or the middle) of Ramaḍán. It will be in the early
morning of the twenty-third (of Ramaḍán) that Gabriel will

announce that ‘Alí and his followers (Shí‘at ‘Alí) were on
the right path, and at the end of the day Iblis will
announce the rightfulness of the martyr ‘Uthmán and his
followers.24

On the twenty-fifth of Dhí al-Ḥijja, Nafs al-Zakíya
Muḥammad b. al-Hasan25 will be killed between the Rukn and
the Maqám.26 Friday, the tenth of Muḥarram, will be the
day of the advent of the Greater Light of God (Núr Alláh
al-Akbar), the Lord of the Age (Ṣaḥib al-Zamán), the Qá’im,
who will go to the Masjid al-Ḥarám27 and kill the preacher,
and then will enter the Ka‘ba. At night he will call upon
his followers and 313 of them, from the east and the west,
will be assembled around him, and the first believer in the
Qá’im will be Gabriel.28

The Qá’im will remain at Mecca until ten thousand
people have gathered around him. At this time the Sufyání29
will send his armies to Kufa, Medina, and also to Mecca.
This last army will be swallowed up by the earth, but two
of its members will survive to convey the news to the Qá’im
and to the Sufyání. The Qá’im will send troops around the
world, will kill the Dajjál and the Sufyání, and will fill
the earth with justice and righteousness, whereas before it
had been filled with oppression and cruelty. He will make
his residence at Kufa.30

The Qá’im will reign for seven years, but each of these
years is equal to ten years of our time. Therefore, he will
rule for seventy of our years.31

The second kind of Shaykhí predictions. which are
peculiar to the Shaykhí works, but again are based on
Traditions, prophesy the name, the date, and the character-
istics of the Qá’im and the Second Ḥusayn. Only the most
obvious prophecies in the Shaykhí works will be discussed
here.

Shaykh Aḥmad, in one of his letters, foretold the year
of the appearance of the Qá’im in mysterious language which
employs the cabalistic system. According to this prophecy,
the year 1260/1844 was the year in which the Qá’im would
appear.32 This prophecy is supported by Sayyid Káẓim’s
statement that the Qá’im will appear in the thirteenth
century.33 Sayyid Káẓim’s prophecy, however, is elaborated
in his Risála for Mullá Ḥusayn ‘Alí,34 where he says that
the voice of God will be heard after a thousand years.
Since according to the common Shí‘í belief, the Twelfth Imám
was God’s voice among men until the year 260/872 when he
went into occultation, the thousand-year period would end in
1260/1844, when the voice of God would be heard again.

Regarding the name of the Qá’im, Sayyid Káẓim, at the
beginning of his Sharḥ al-Qaṣída,35 indicates that the
numerical value of his name is equal to twice the numerical
value of the letter “K—‫ ”ك‬when it is pronounced. The
pronunciation of this letter is “Káf—‫”ﻛﺎف‬, which consists
of three letters: “K-á-f—‫”ك ا ف‬. The numerical value of
the pronounced “Káf—‫ ”ﻛﺎف‬is 101 (K=20, á=1, f=80), and its
double is 202, which is equal to the numerical value of the

name of the Báb, ‘Alí Muḥammad “‫”اﻟﻲ ﻣﺤﻤﻤﺪ‬: (‫ = ع‬70,
‫ = ل‬30, ‫ = ي‬10, ‫ = م‬40, ‫ = ح‬8, ‫ = م‬40, ‫ = د‬4).

The Báb, in a letter to one of his followers, Mullá
Muḥammad Ja‘far b. Muḥammad Kermání, indicates the fulfill-
ment of this prophecy by his appearance.36 Qurrat al-‘Ain
also states in one of her treatises that Sayyid Káẓim’s
prediction about the name of the Qá’im is fulfilled in the
Báb.37

Nabíl, the author of one of the earliest histories of
the Bábí movement, relates that in the same year the Báb was
born (that is, 1235/1819), Shaykh Aḥmad suffered the loss of
his son, Shaykh ‘Alí. Shaykh Aḥmad explained to his
students, who mourned his loss, that he had offered his son
as a sacrifice for ‘Alí, whose appearance they were await-
ing.38 This, Nabíl says, indicates that the name of the
Qá‘im was to be ‘Alí.

The Shaykhí works contain numerous indications regard-
ing the characteristics of the Qá’im. To disciples who
questioned him about this subject, Sayyid Káẓim replied that
he would be from a noble lineage, a descendant of Fáṭima of
the family of Háshim. He would be young and possess know-
ledge which is not derived from schools but is given to him
by God. He would be of medium height, and free from bodily
defects. He would not smoke. He would be illustrious and
an extreme devotee.39

In their works, on numerous occasions Shaykh Aḥmad and
Sayyid Káẓim predicted the signs, virtues, and character-

istics of the Second Christ or Imám Ḥusayn. Like the
Shaykhí predictions on the Qá’im, these are of two kinds:
predictions that almost repeat the popular expectations of
the Shí‘a and predictions that are peculiar to the Shaykhís
and are not found in Shí‘í works.

In the first kind, Shaykhí sources specify that in the
fifty-ninth year of the Qá’ím’s reign, Ḥusayn will appear.
He will be accompanied by the seventy-two martyrs of
Karbalá. After a seventy-year reign, the Qá’im will be
killed, and Ḥusayn will give him burial.40 Then Ḥusayn will
take over the Qá’im’s responsibilities and will kill Shimr,
Yazíd,41 and other enemies who will have returned. Finally,
Ḥusayn will defeat all the enemies and will reign for fifty
thousand years.42

Of the second kind of predictions, Shaykh Aḥmad, in a
letter to Sayyid Káẓim,43 states, “For every prophecy is a
term, and you will come to know, and most certainly you will
come to know about it. After a Time (Ba‘da Ḥín).”44 In this
statement, the Arabic word, “Ḥín—‫”ﺣﯿﻦ‬, according to the
Abjad system, is equal to 68: (‫ = ح‬8, ‫ = ي‬10, ‫ = ن‬50).
“After a time” (ba‘da ḥín) means 69, i.e., ḥin is 68 and
after the ḥín is 69. The Shaykhí view of the term “after a
time” (ba‘da ḥín) is based upon Imám Ṣádiq’s interpretation
of the Quranic verse: “And most certainly you will come to
know about it after a time (ba‘da ḥínin).” (38:88) Imám
Ṣádiq says that the Quranic term “ba‘da ḥín” refers to the
year in which the Qá’im will appear.45

It was in the year 69 (1269/1852) that Bahá’u’lláh,
while in the prison of Siyáh Chál in Tehrán, claimed to have
received his revelation. Although the term Qá’im was
understood by the Bábís to refer to the Báb and not to
Bahá’u’lláh, Imám Ṣádiq says that the Qá’im will appear in
the year 69. It seems, therefore, that the term Qá’im in
this Tradition has been used by the Shaykhís who became
Bábís as a general term referring to the “one who will
rise”, which could be a reference to Bahá’u’lláh as well as
to the Báb.

The Báb, in a letter to Muḥammad Sháh Qájár, mentions
the words “after Ḥín” (ba‘da ḥín) as a reference to the
person who will arise in the year 1269/1852, i.e., the
Second Christ (later understood by many Bábís to be
Bahá’u’lláh). In his letter the Báb says, “Praise be unto
Him Who at this very moment perceiveth in this remote prison
the goal of My desire. He is the One Who beareth witness
unto Me at all times and beholdeth Me ere the inception of
‘after Ḥín’.”46

Cryptic language in the introductory pages of Sayyid
Káẓim’s major book, Sharḥ al-Qaṣída,47 was understood later
by the Bábís as a reference to the name of Bahá’u’lláh.

It is important to remember that those Shaykhís who
believed that the Báb was the Qá’im were still expecting the
advent of the Second Christ or the Return of Ḥusayn in the
year 69 (1269) as Shaykhí works had predicted. A good
example of such an expectation is found in a short treatise

written by Mullá Muḥammad ‘Alí Baraghání,48 the brother of
the famous Mullá Muḥammad Taqí, known as Shahíd-i Thálith,
who issued the takfír against Shaykh Aḥmad. This expecta-
tion was based primarily on the Shaykhí prophecies which the
Báb reaffirmed in his letter to Muḥammad Sháh as well as on
numerous other occasions in his writings, particularly in
his major work the Persian Bayán.49 In these instances,
the Báb refers to the year 9 after the commencement of his
ministry, that is, 1269/1852, as the year in which the
Second Christ would appear.50 The year 9 in the Báb’s
writings corresponds with the “ba‘da ḥín” in Shaykh Aḥmad’s
works; both refer to 1269/1852, the year in which
Bahá’u’lláh received his first revelation in the prison of
the Siyáh Chál.

The Shaykhí doctrines, particularly those concerning
the concept of finality and the Day of Judgment, along with
Shaykh Aḥmad’s and Sayyid Káẓim’s predictions regarding the
Qá’im, created among adherents of the school a predisposi-
tion for the recognition of the Báb. But these were not
the only factors that led some of the Shaykhís to believe in
the Báb. Those Shaykhís who became Bábís were not only
intellectually ready to accept him, but they saw in the Báb
and in his writings the continuation of the revolutionary
spirit which had been initiated in the Shaykhí school. And
they could also put it into practice, for the Bábí movement
not only released them from obedience to the religious
authorities and their dogma, it urged them to express

fearlessly the principles of the new movement.

While the Shaykhí school strongly opposed the views
and practices of the Shí‘í ‘ulamá, it was still sympathetic
and loyal to the popular beliefs of the Shí‘a. The Bábí
movement, however, was more aggressive and far-reaching in
its social impact although less Shí‘í-oriented than the
Shaykhí school. As time went on, the Bábí movement devel-
oped into an independent religion with its own books and
principles.

Although the hopes of the Shaykhís for a restoration
and revitalization of Shí‘a were not completely fulfilled,
the doctrines of the Shaykhí school paved the way and
prepared some of its adherents to find the fulfillment of
their hopes in the Bábí movement—a movement which was to
be more comprehensive, more reformist, and more future-
oriented than that of the Shaykhís.

VII
The relationship of Shaykhí doctrines

to the religious thought of the Báb
Shaykh Aḥmad won a wide following among various groups
in Persian society, a popularity which can be attributed to
several factors. Shaykh Aḥmad traveled widely and enjoyed
the respect of the Sháh and some members of the royal
family. He spoke repeatedly of his spiritual communion, in
his dreams, with the Shí‘í imams; this spiritual communion,
traditionally a sign of holiness and inspired knowledge in
the Shí‘í society, added to his charismatic character and,
consequently, brought him respect and popularity, particu-
larly among the masses. Shaykh Aḥmad’s knowledge in all
branches of Islamic sciences, his indisputable piety, and
his love and extraordinary respect for the Shí‘í imáms
brought him great popularity among the religious Persians.
Unlike the fundamentalist religious writers, his discussions
of religious matters had a rationalistic flavor, which
attracted religious people as well as intellectuals seeking
such an approach toward religious problems, Shaykh Aḥmad’s
opposition to the dominant religious and philosophical
authorities provided an opportunity for those who did not
have learning and gave them the encouragement to express
their opposition. They found Shaykh Aḥmad an outspoken,
learned leader who was capable of combatting dogmas and
authority of those leading figures.

While many Persians were attracted to Shaykh Aḥmad,
several leading authorities rose against him,1 and,
naturally, most Persians remained indifferent. The causes
of religious leaders’ opposition to Shaykh Aḥmad were
diverse but not difficult to surmise. Many of his opponents
did not thoroughly understand his ideology; thus, their
opposition was based on misinterpretation of Shaykh Aḥmad’s
teachings. Those who opposed him did not do so merely
because of his doctrine, but because of the popularity and
power he had won among the masses and the ruling class,
which aroused the jealousy of the ‘ulamá. Opposition also
derived from the ‘ulamá’s general attitude toward anyone who
denied the traditional dogmas. It was obvious to them that
some of Shaykh Aḥmad’s teachings diverged from those of the
Shí‘a, and this was sufficient reason for the ‘ulamá to
charge him with introducing innovations into religion.

The opposition of the ‘ulamá found expression in a
number of polemical works written to refute Shaykh Aḥmad and
his ideology.2 These works are also important sources for
the intellectual history of nineteenth century Iran. A
mirror of the psychological and religious reaction of the
‘ulamá toward Shaykh Aḥmad, they also reveal how the ‘ulamá
attempted to protect the Sharí‘a from innovations.

The most famous opponents of Shaykh Aḥmad during his
lifetime were the eminent Uṣúli ‘ulamá of ‘Atabát and Iran,
including Mullá Muḥammad Ja‘far Astarábádí,3 Mullá Áqá
Darbandí, Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥusayn Najafí,4 and Sayyid Ibráhím

Qazvíní. A leading figure in the intellectual opposition
to Shaykh Aḥmad, and to the Shaykhís in general, was ‘Abd
al-Ṣamad b. ‘Abd Alláh al-Ḥusayní al-Mázandarání,5 who was
born in 1255/1839 in Kermánsháh. His mother was the
daughter of Sayyid Aḥmad b. Muḥammad ‘Alí Kermánsháhí, a
well-known Uṣúlí scholar.6 A typical opponent of the
Shaykhís, Ḥusayní is important because he not only
criticized the views of Shaykh Aḥmad, but also those of
Sayyid Káẓim Rashtí and Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím Khán Kermání.

To protect the Sharí‘a, he wrote three polemical works
refuting Shaykhí ideology. The first was al-Maráṣid ‘Alá
Sharḥ al-Fawá’id, which was written to refute the Sharḥ
al-Fawá’id of Shaykh Aḥmad. The second was the Tanbíh
al-Anám, written in 1293/1876 to refute Ḥájj Muḥammad Karím
Khán’s best known work, the Irshád al-‘Awám.7 In the Tanbíh,
Ḥusayní levels one hundred charges against Ḥájj Muḥammad
Karím Khán’s views as expressed in his Irshád.8 The third
work of Ḥusayní which deserves attention is the Tiryáq-i
Fárúq, written in 1301/1883. The Tiryáq is a convenient
synopsis of the most important charges that Shí‘í scholars
have leveled against the Shaykhís. Unlike the other two
polemical books by Ḥusayní, which were written to criticize
specific Shaykhí works, the Tiryáq attacks the entire
Shaykhí ideology, and, since it was written after them, it
is more comprehensive.

In his book, Ḥusayní criticizes the most important
works of Shaykh Aḥmad. Sayyid Káẓim, and Ḥájj Muḥammad
Karím

Khán. His main sources are the Sharḥ al-Ziyára and the
Sharḥ al-Fawá’id of Shaykh Aḥmad, Sharḥ al-Khuṭba al-
Ṭutunjíya of Sayyid Káẓim, and the Irshád al-‘Awám of Ḥájj
Muḥammad Karím Khán.

To demonstrate the innovations of the Shaykhís,
Ḥusayní frequently refers to the works of several leading
Shí‘í authorities such as Mufíd, Ṣadúq, ‘Alláma-i Ḥillí, and
Majlisí. Ḥusayní contends that the original Shí‘í ideology
is expressed in the works of these scholars, and that the
Shaykhí doctrines which contradict this ideology are
innovations.

In the Tiryáq, Ḥusayní enumerates forty-three
ideological differences between the Shaykhís and the Shí‘a.
The differences can be summarized under three main headings:
the imáms, ontology, and eschatology.

Regarding the imáms, Ḥusayní states that the Shaykhís
differ from the Shí‘a by maintaining that:
1\. The imáms are the Four Causes: the notional cause

> (‘illat-i fá‘ilí), the material cause (‘illat-i máddí),
> the formal cause (‘illat-i ṣúrí), and the final cause
> (‘illat-i ghá’í)9
2\. The imáms’ knowledge is inspired (ḥuḍúrí) knowledge,

derived from the presence of God10

3\. The imáms are lords, and the people are their slaves11
4\. The imáms’ physical bodies do not crumble to dust12

Ḥusayni’s conclusions with regard to the Shaykhís’ view
of the imáms is that the Shaykhís have exaggerated the

position of the imáms, and, therefore, they are infidels
just like the Mufawwiḍa and the Ghálíya.13

Regarding ontology, Ḥusayní states that the Shaykhís
differ from the Shí‘a by maintaining that:
1\. God’s knowledge is essential and it is identical with

His essence14

2\. Existence is created, limitless, and new15
3\. Existence is eternal in time. but created in its

substance16 and
4\. Angels are not temporal, but they are spiritual beings17

Regarding eschatology, Ḥusayní states that the Shaykhís
differ from the Shí‘a by maintaining that:
1\. Subtle bodies, not physical bodies, will be resur-

rected18

2\. Paradise is the love of the imáms19
3\. Paradise and hell do not have identity by themselves

but are the result of man’s own conduct20
4\. The Ascension of the Prophet was not with his physical

> body, but rather with his spirit. By his Ascension,
> the Prophet reached the highest level of his knowledge
> but never reached God21
5\. The rank of the Qá’im is the fifth, after Muḥammad, ‘Alí,

Ḥasan, and Ḥusayn, and not the twelfth22
6\. The Twelfth Imám will return in his subtle, not his

physical body23
7\. The six days of creation stand for (1) intellect, (2)

soul, (3) nature, (4) matter, (5) subtle, and (6)

body;24 the concept that the world was created in six
days is not literally correct

Ḥusayní accuses the Shaykhís of misinterpreting several
verses of the Qur’án. He mentions cases such as the Shaykhí
belief that Mount Sinai is a symbol for the heart of a
believer,25 and that the “manifestation of the light upon
the Mountain”26 stands for the manifestation of the light of
Moses’ essence upon his heart. The Shaykhís, Ḥusayní
states, believe that the “Barrier of Dhulqarnayn”27 stands
for “dissimulation” (taqíya),28 and that Gog and Magog in
the Qur’án29 have an allegorical meaning and refer to the
enemies of Shí‘a.30 In another case. Ḥusayní states that by
“Children of Israel” (baní Isrá’íl),31 the Shaykhís mean the
Prophet and his children, because, according to the Shaykhís
Isrá’íl literally means the Slave of God (‘Abd Alláh) and
‘Abd Alláh was the name of the Prophet’s father.32

At the end of his book Ḥusayní accuses Shaykh Aḥmad of
having claimed to receive Revelation (waḥy) from God and
also of knowing the occult sciences.33

The opposition of Shí‘í ‘ulamá to the Shaykhís did not,
however, remain on an intellectual level. In several cities
serious clashes occurred between the Shí‘a and the Shaykhís
during which members of both parties were killed and
property was destroyed. One such clash occurred when Ḥájj
Mírzá Aḥmad Khoeí of Tabríz,34 a leading mujtahid of
Ádharbáyján, issued a takfír against the Shaykhís of that
city. A massive uprising against the Shaykhís followed, in

which many were killed.35

In another clash, in 1314/1896, the Uṣúlís of Hamadán
attacked and burned Shaykhí houses and killed Mírzá Muḥammad
Báqir Hamadání, the leader of the Shaykhís of Hamadán, as
well as a certain Mírzá Muḥammad, a distinguished Shaykhí of
that city.36

The serious intellectual opposition of the Uṣúlí ‘ulamá
and their attacks against the Shaykhís prevented the
Shaykhís from gaining a following or even considerable
recognition in Persian society.

As time went on, most of the Shaykhís lost their group
identity and became reassimilated into Shí‘a. But those
Shaykhís who remained loyal to the leadership of the
Shaykhís of Kermán continued to function as a group.

While Shaykh Aḥmad’s ideology survived only to a
limited extent among his own followers, it had its greatest
impact upon the religious life of the Persians through the
Bábí movement. However, the Bábí ideology cannot, by any
means, be considered an extension of the Shaykhí school,
because of several radical differences between the two.
Shaykh Aḥmad never claimed to be a prophet, as the Báb
did;37 Shaykh Aḥmad never claimed to have received
Revelation or a revealed book from God, as the Báb did;38
Shaykh Aḥmad never claimed to have brought a Qur’án, as the
Báb did.39

Nevertheless, Shaykhí thought had a great impact upon
Bábí ideology: there is no doubt that Bábí doctrines have

closer ties to Shaykhí thought than to any other branch of
Islamic belief.40

It is impossible at this stage to fully discuss the
depth and scope of Shaykhí influence upon Bábí doctrines,
partly because most of the Báb’s main works are still in
manuscript form and partly because social and religious
circumstances have hindered the study of them.

On the basis of better-known, published Bábí sources,
however, it is possible to examine some of the basic areas
in which Shaykhí thought had an impact upon Bábí ideology.

Of all the Islamic sects, the Shí‘a are best known for
their allegorical interpretation of the Qur’án. This
feature of Shí‘í thought developed even further in the
Shaykhí approach toward the Qur’án, which Shaykh Aḥmad
interpreted allegorically rather than literally, in order to
reconcile revelation with reason. This allegorical approach
toward the Qur’án reached its full development in the
writings of the Báb.

Another major area was the Shaykhí attitude toward the
imáms. As discussed earlier, Shaykh Aḥmad, in all of his
works, emphasized the vital role of the imáms in the
religious life of the believers and, in fact, often
mentioned his personal contact with them. In contrast with
the general view of the Shí‘a, who believed that during the
occultation period,41 the ‘ulamá were to be the inter-
mediaries between the believers and the imán, which made
them the center of attention in Shí‘í society, Shaykh Aḥmad

shifted the attention of his followers to the imáms. Shaykh
Aḥmad’s view was accepted by the Báb and resulted in the
complete elimination of the clergy in the Bábí religious
system.

The third main area in which Shaykh Aḥmad’s ideas had
an impact in Bábí doctrines was his attitude toward the
Ṣúfís, theologians, and philosophers whose views contradict
the imáms’ views thereby misleading people. The Báb, in his
writings, carried these views even further by blaming the
learned for preventing people from recognizing the truth.
The Báb expresses his view in regard to the Christian
learned in the following passage:

> It is recorded in a tradition that of the entire
> concourse of the Christians no more than seventy
> people embraced the Faith of the Apostle of God.
> The blame falleth upon their doctors, for if these
> had believed, they would have been followed by
> the mass of their countrymen. Behold, then, that
> which hath come to pass! The learned men of
> Christendom are held to be learned by virtue of
> their safeguarding the teaching of Christ, and
> yet consider how they themselves have been the
> cause of men’s failure to accept the Faith and
> attain unto salvation! Is it still thy wish to
> follow in their footsteps? The followers of Jesus
> submitted to their clerics to be saved on the
> Day of Resurrection, and as a result of this obed-
> ience they eventually entered into the fire, and
> on the Day when the Apostle of God appeared they
> shut themselves out from the recognition of His
> exalted Person. Dost thou desire to follow such
> divines?
> Nay, by God, be thou neither a divine without
> discernment nor a follower without discernment,
> for both of these shall perish on the Day of
> Resurrection. Rather it behooveth thee to be
> a discerning divine, or to walk with insight in
> the way of God by obeying a true leader of reli-
> gion.

In every nation thou beholdest unnumbered

spiritual leaders who are bereft of true discern-

ment, and among every people thou dost encounter
> myriads of adherents who are devoid of the same
> characteristic. Ponder for a while in thy heart,
> have pity on thyself and turn not aside thine
> attention from proofs and evidences. However,
> seek not proofs and evidences after thine idle
> fancy; but rather base thy proofs upon what God
> hath appointed. Moreover, know thou that neither
> being a man of learning nor being a follower is
> in itself a source of glory. If thou art a man
> of learning, thy knowledge becometh an honour,
> and if thou art a follower, thine adherence unto
> leadership becometh an honour, only when these
> conform to the good-pleasure of God. And beware
> lest thou regard as an idle fancy the good-pleasure
> of God; it is the same as the good-pleasure of
> His Messenger. Consider the followers of Jesus.
> They were eagerly seeking the good-pleasure of
> God, yet none of them attained the good-pleasure
> of His Apostle which is identical with God’s good-
> pleasure, except such as embraced His Faith.42
The Báb states that man’s highest station is attained
through faith in God and by acceptance of what has been
revealed by Him, and not through the speculations of the
learned. Then he says, “True knowledge, therefore, is the
knowledge of God, and this is none other than the recogni-
tion of His Manifestation in each Dispensation.”43 This
true knowledge, the Báb asserts, is the most noble of
created things.44

Like Shaykh Aḥmad, the Báb maintains that truth is
contained within the writings of the prophet of God, and
that man should seek the truth in those writings. He
writes,

> Ponder a while and observe that everything
> in Islam hath its ultimate and eventual beginning
> in the Book of God. Consider likewise the Day
> of the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make man-
> ifest,45 He in Whose grasp lieth the source of
> proofs, and let not erroneous considerations shut
> thee out from Him, for He is immeasurably exalted

above them, inasmuch as every proof proceedeth
> from the Book of God which is itself the supreme
> testimony, as all men are powerless to produce
> its like. Should myriads of men of learning,
> versed in logic, in the science of grammar, in
> law, in jurisprudence and the like, turn away from
> the Book of God, they would still be pronounced
> unbelievers. Thus the fruit is within the supreme
> testimony itself, not in the things derived there-
> from.46
While Shaykh Aḥmad never went so far as to forbid the
study of logic, philosophy, and jurisprudence,47 the Báb did
so, maintaining that they were unprofitable pursuits and an
obstacle to the recognition of the truth.

The fourth area in which Shaykh Aḥmad’s ideas affected
Bábí thought concerned the understanding of the concept of
finality of the Prophet. Shaykh Aḥmad maintained that the
appearance of the prophets follows a cyclical pattern. The
Báb reaffirms this concept in the following words:

> It is clear and evident that the object of all
> preceding Dispensations bath been to pave the way
> for the advent of Muḥammad, the Apostle of God.
> These, including the Muḥammadan Dispensation, have
> had, in their turn, as their objective the Revela-
> tion proclaimed by the Qá’im. The purpose under-
> lying this Revelation, as well as those that pre-
> ceded it, has in like manner, been to announce
> the advent of the Faith of Him Whom God will make
> manifest. And this Faith—the Faith of Him Whom
> God will make manifest—in its turn, together with
> all the Revelations gone before it, have as their
> object the Manifestation destined to succeed it.
> And the latter, no less than all the Revelations
> preceding it, prepare the way for the Revelation
> which is yet to follow. The process of the rise
> and setting of the Sun of Truth will thus indefin-
> itely continue—a process that hath no beginning
> and will have no end.48
Like Shaykh Aḥmad, the Báb compares the successive
appearance of the prophets and their increasing perfection

> to a body in successive stages of growth.49 As an individ-
ual develops toward perfection during the various stages of
his growth in the womb, so mankind as a whole improves in
successive cycles in the world.50 The Báb writes:

> For had the embryo not existed, how could he have
> reached his present state? Likewise had the re-
> ligion taught by Adam not existed, this Faith would
> not have attained its present stage. Thus consider
> thou the development of God’s Faith until the and
> that hath no end.51
And also:

> Likewise continue thou to ascend through one rev-
> elation after another, knowing that thy progress
> in the knowledge of God shall never come to an
> end, even as it can have no beginning.52
He also states that

> The process of His creation hath had no beginning
> and can have no end, otherwise it would necessi-
> tate the cessation of His celestial grace. God
> hath raised up Prophets and revealed Books as
> numerous as the creatures of the world, and will
> continue to do so to everlasting.53
Shaykh Aḥmad’s doctrines on Islamic ontology and
eschatology had a strong impact on the Báb’s approach toward
these questions.54 The basic issues of these two fields,
discussed in the Shaykhí and Bábí works, appear to consti-
tute the closest intellectual tie between the two systems.

In his discussion of the basic ontological questions,
of the nature and attributes of God, the Báb asserts that
God will “dwell within the mystery of His Own divine
Essence”55 and is “exalted above the reach and ken of all
created beings.”56 As Shaykh Aḥmad substituted the
recognition of the imám for the recognition of God, the Báb

also states, “Know thou that in this world of being the
knowledge of God can never be attained save through the
knowledge of Him Who is the Dayspring of divine Reality
[i.e., the prophet].”57 Thus, although for Shaykh Aḥmad and
the Báb man cannot know God, take refuge in Him, or meet
with Him, he can achieve the equivalent with His prophet.

Similar to Shaykh Aḥmad’s doctrine, the Báb maintains
that God created all things by His will and the will by
itself.58 The relationship between the will and the
universe is compared to the relationship between fire and
heat.59

Although in Shaykh Aḥmad’s writings paradise and hell
are interpreted literally, in accordance with the tradi-
tional belief, as well as allegorically, in the writings of
the Báb they only receive an allegorical interpretation.
The Báb writes:

> There is no paradise, in the estimation of the
> believers in the Divine Unity, more exalted than
> to obey God’s commandments, and there is no fire
> in the eyes of those who have known God and His
> signs, fiercer than to transgress His laws and
> to oppress another soul, even to the extent of
> a mustard seed.60
Elsewhere he writes:

> There is no paradise more wondrous for any
> soul than to be exposed to God’s Manifestation
> in His Day, to hear His verses and believe in
> them, to attain His presence, which is naught but
> the presence of God, to sail upon the sea of the
> heavenly kingdom of His good-pleasure, and to par-
> take of the choice fruits of the paradise of His
> divine Oneness.61
In the Báb’s writings paradise and hell are given

different allegorical interpretations. In one place the Báb
maintains that paradise refers to those who believe in the
Bayán,62 i.e., the Báb’s Book; in another place, paradise is
the Bayán itself;63 whoever accepts it is in paradise, and
whoever denies it is in hell. In several cases the Báb
refers to paradise as being wherever the believers have
been or are.64 He states that no hell is worse than
unbelief or the denial of a prophet.65 Whoever denies the
Báb and refuses to take refuge in him shall not escape hell,
and whoever has rejected the Bayán is already in hell.66

Shaykh Aḥmad regarded Resurrection as the day of the
advent of the Qá’im. Although he also interpreted Resurrec-
tion in accordance with the traditional belief of the Shí‘a,
the Báb only interprets it as the day of the appearance of a
new prophet. This interpretation is radically different
from what the Shí‘a understand in a purely material sense.
The Báb’s most comprehensive explanation of his views on
the Resurrection occurs in his main book, the Persian Bayán.
It reads,

> The substance of this chapter is this, that what
> is intended by the Day of Resurrection is the Day
> of the appearance of the Tree of divine Reality,67
> but it is not seen that any one of the followers
> of Shí‘ih Islám hath understood the meaning of
> the Day of Resurrection; rather have they fanci-
> fully imagined a thing which with God hath no
> reality. In the estimation of God and according
> to the usage of such as are initiated into divine
> mysteries, what is meant by the Day of Resurrec-
> tion is this, that from the time of the appearance
> of Him Who is the Tree of divine Reality, at what-
> ever period and under whatever name, until the
> moment of His disappearance, is the Day of Resur-
> rection.

For example, from the inception of the mission
> of Jesus—may peace be upon Him—till the day of
> His ascension was the Resurrection of Moses. For
> during that period the Revelation of God shone
> forth through the appearance of that divine Reality,
> Who rewarded by His Word everyone who believed
> in Moses, and punished by His Word everyone who
> did not believe; inasmuch as God’s Testimony for
> that Day was that which He had solemnly affirmed
> in the Gospel. And from the inception of the Rev-
> elation of the Apostle of God—may the blessings
> of God be upon Him—till the day of His ascension
> was the Resurrection of Jesus—peace be upon Him—
> wherein the Tree of divine Reality appeared in
> the person of Muḥammad, rewarding by His Word every-
> one who was not a believer in Jesus, and punishing
> by His Word everyone who was not a believer in
> Him. And from the moment when the Tree of the
> Bayán appeared until it disappeareth is the Resur-
> rection of the Apostle of God, as is divinely fore-
> told in the Qur’án; the beginning of which was
> when two hours and eleven minutes had passed on
> the eve of the fifth of Jamádívu’l-Avval, AH 1260
> (22 May 1844), which is the year 1270 of the
> Declaration of the Mission of Muḥammad. This was
> the beginning of the Day of Resurrection of the
> Qur’án, and until the disappearance of the Tree
> of divine Reality is the Resurrection of the
> Qur’án.68
Later in the same chapter, he continues,

> This notwithstanding that in the Qur’án the advent
> of the Day of Resurrection hath been promised unto
> all by God. For on that Day all men will be brought
> before God and will attain His Presence; which
> meaneth appearance before Him Who is the Tree of
> divine Reality and attainment unto His presence;
> inasmuch as it is not possible to appear before
> the Most Holy Essence of God, nor is it conceiv-
> able to seek reunion with Him. That which is feas-
> ible in the matter of appearance before Him and of
> meeting Him is attainment unto the Primal Tree.69

And elsewhere in the same book he writes.

> The Day of Resurrection is a day on which the sun
> riseth and setteth like unto any other day. How
> oft hath the Day of Resurrection dawned, and the
> people of the land where it occurred did not learn
> of the event. Had they heard, they would not have
> believed, and thus they were not told!70

The impact of Shaykhí teachings manifested itself not
only in Bábí ideology but also in the conduct of those
Shaykhís who became followers of the Báb. In the Báb, these
Shaykhís found the person Shaykh Aḥmad had written about and
with whom he had had a close relationship in his dreams.
These Shaykhís were now able to express to a human being who
actually lived among them the love and gratitude that their
teacher had expressed to the Hidden Imám. No wonder, then,
that thousands of Bábís, of whom the most distinguished had
come from a Shaykhí background, willingly endured the most
horrible tortures and persecutions and sacrificed their
lives for the Báb.

\[1\] Mudarris, in his Rayḥánat al-Adab, vol. 1, p. 81), states
> that when Shaykh Aḥmad’s works and approach (maslak)
> became widely known, he became subject to the curses
> and censure of the people. They changed their attitude
> toward him and even his son, Shaykh Muḥammad,

> Shaykh Aḥmad, namely, Muḥammad Ḥasan (the
> author of Jawáhir al-Kalám, Áqá Sayyid Ibráhím
> (Qazvíní) (the author of Ḍawábiṭ), Sharíf al-‘Ulamá,
> and Muḥammad Ḥusayn (the author of Fuṣúl).

> in his Rawḍát al-Jannát, in which he wrote the bio-
> graphy of Shaykh Rajab Bursí.
> Ḥusayní, in his Tiryáq-i Fárúq, p. 26), says that because
> Shaykh Aḥmad regarded the imáms as the Four Causes

Conclusion
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
a time of general decline in the intellectual creativity of
the Shí‘í community in Iran, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf,
Shaykh Aḥmad Aḥsá’í was determined to reform and revitalize
the Shí‘í society by direct inspiration from the words of
the Prophet and the Shí‘í imáms. This re-emphasis on the
doctrine of the imamate formed the essence of his ideology.
The doctrine of imamate, which distinguished the Shí‘a from
the Sunnís, states that the virtue and guidance of the
Prophet continues through the imáms so that mankind will not
be deprived of his divine guidance.

Of the various theological, philosophical, sociological
and ritualistic aspects of the Shaykhí school, it was
intended in this work to focus on the theological aspects,
particularly those doctrines formulated by Shaykh Aḥmad on
basic questions of Islamic ontology and eschatology, such as
God, His attributes, and His will and its relationship with
creation; resurrection; and return. Of course, the theolog-
ical doctrines of Shaykh Aḥmad appeared within the intellec-
tual horizons of Persian society and were influenced by its
social, political and economic conditions. Further investi-
gation is required to illuminate how and why the theological
doctrines of Shaykh Aḥmad, an Arab scholar, achieved
popularity and respect among some Persian groups and elites
at first, only to arouse opposition and become the target of

attack by some of the eminent Shí‘í ‘ulamá. Although in his
ontological doctrines, Shaykh Aḥmad opposed some of his
predecessors, such as Ibn al-‘Arabí, Mullá Ṣadrá, and Mullá
Muḥsin Fayḍ Káshání, he nevertheless was influenced by them
and, particularly through Mullá Ṣadrá, by Ibn Síná. Shaykh
Aḥmad’s doctrines on the philosophical questions of creation,
God’s will, and His relationship with the universe manifest
obvious similarities to those of the Ismá‘ílís. Shaykh
Aḥmad’s understanding of the position of the imáms brings
him close to the Ghálís and the Mufawwiḍa, while terminology
and interpretation of the subtle body are reminiscent of
Shiháb al-Dín Sohravardí and other Illuminists. His piety
and detachment from the material affairs of daily life, his
inspiration from the imáms in his dreams, and the love and
annihilation of the will of the imáms, of which he speaks
throughout his works, characterize him as a Ṣúfí, but,
unlike other Ṣúfís, he rejects the possibility of union with
God.

In spite of these similarities, to determine the exact
areas of influence and the ways through which he was
influenced requires further study. To what extent the
socio-political conditions of the Persian Gulf, ‘Atabát,
and Iran contributed to the intellectual development of the
Shaykhí school, the social role of the Shaykhís in the
political and intellectual changes that occurred in the
second half of the nineteenth century, the social background
of those who were attracted to the Shaykhí school, of those

Shaykhís who converted to the Báb and of those who rose
against him, are all challenging questions for students of
the nineteenth century intellectual history of Iran.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s original contribution was his synthesis
of the two main schools of Shí‘í thought in the first half
of the nineteenth century—the Akhbárí and the Uṣúlí.
Neither the dogmatic speculations of the Akhbárís, nor the
scholastic discussions of the Uṣúlís satisfied him; there-
fore, he took a position between these two groups.

The major task Shaykh Aḥmad undertook was to reconcile
revelation and reason: the first represented by the
Akhbárís, the second, by the Uṣúlís. In his attempt he did
not give a preponderant weight to either side. He respected
man’s reason but never overlooked the importance of divine
inspiration which man may receive through his prayers and
ascetic practices. He strongly believed in the Qur’án and
the Traditions of the imáms, but his belief in them did not
prevent him from using his reason. In fact, he insisted
that there must be an absolute harmony between revelation
and reason. In his efforts to discover that harmony,
however, he did not rely upon his reason whenever it could
not comprehend the logic of the word of God.

Shaykh Aḥmad was not primarily concerned with estab-
lishing a new system of thought or a school different from
Shí‘a. But the way in which he approached the religious
questions and presented them was new and original. His
approach was an attempt to examine the Shí‘í beliefs from a

new perspective, but its source was firmly grounded within
the Shí‘í framework and was regarded by others as the
Shaykhí school of thought within Shí‘í Islam.

While the ideology of Shaykh Aḥmad in its entirety was
strongly rooted in the Qur’án and Islamic Traditions, it
differed from that of other Shí‘í scholars. The difference
derived primarily from the way in which Shaykh Aḥmad
interpreted the Qur’án and the Islamic Traditions. It was
also based on certain Traditions that were not widely
accepted by the majority of Shí‘í thinkers.

Shaykh Aḥmad challenged the views of the Ṣúfí Ibn
al-‘Arabí, the theologian Mullá Muḥsin Fayḍ, and the philo-
sopher Mullá Ṣadrá—three eminent scholars who dominated
the Persian intellectual horizon in the nineteenth century.
Shaykh Aḥmad’s challenge was unique: unlike other writers
on Shí‘í thought who had concentrated their attacks on only
one of these groups, Shaykh Aḥmad challenged all three.
Shaykh Aḥmad’s primary purpose for focusing attention on the
ideology of his predecessors was to draw the attention of
those of his own generation who were sympathetic to them and
also to prepare his followers for what he perceived to be a
crucial event in the future: the appearance of the Qá’im.
This, indeed, was the most important, constructive, and
influential contribution that he made, the essence of his
life’s work.

In his efforts to prepare his followers for the
appearance of the Qá’im, Shaykh Aḥmad laid the cornerstone

for a religious reform which was to appear after him in the
form of the Bábí movement. Shaykh Aḥmad did not intend to
produce a reform in Islamic law or the social order of Shí‘í
society, but to reshape the Shí‘í attitude toward the advent
of the Qá’im. For him the appearance of the Qá’im was the
answer to all questions and, therefore, the people must be
prepared for the day of his advent, which, when it occurred,
would be the source of happiness, prosperity, and salvation.

Shaykh Aḥmad’s intellectual contribution to the
generations that followed him was much greater than that of
his predecessors. In particular, he offered to the people
of his own time more than he had received from his father’s
generation. Without Shaykh Aḥmad’s intellectual contribu-
tion, the Báb could not have won the followers, popularity,
and influence that he did.
