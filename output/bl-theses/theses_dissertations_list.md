Abstract:    The Bahá'í Year of Service Program (BYSP) is a new concept  
in youth service. The program provides opportunities for young people  
between the ages of twelve and twenty-five to serve in a wide range  
of activities both domestically and abroad. This dissertation focuses  
on the BYSP in the United States because of the approximately dozen  
Bahá'í Year of Service programs around the world, it is the oldest  
and most experienced.  
This dissertation examines the history of the BYSP from its  
beginnings in the early 1980s to the present. Emphasis is given to  
identifying the underlying principles on which the program is based.  
These principles are, when possible, contrasted with the principles  
underlying other youth service programs, like the Peace Corps.  
This study was conducted by interviews with both staff and  
participants of the BYSP. Participants were interviewed before,  
after, and during their periods of service. Also, the BYSP archives  
were opened for this study.  
The BYSP is still a new and growing program. Future studies will  
be required to determine BYSP's long term effects.

Abstract:    This thesis examines the arrival and subsequent expansion  
of the Bahá'í faith in the province of Alberta, Canada. In the last  
fifty years their membership has grown from a few isolated  
individuals to approximately 3,000 Bahá'ís in more than 170 different  
locations. The conclusion of the thesis is that the presence and  
distribution of the Bahá'ís has been determined primarily by their  
strong commitment to propagation and diffusion.  
The initial presence and subsequent dispersion of Bahá'ís in the  
province was the result of concerted continental efforts to establish  
the first local elected councils, to carry the religion into  
unfamiliar cultures, and to deliberately move to cities, towns,  
villages and outlying districts all across the province. These  
efforts resulted in two sizable waves of new native and youth  
members. A similar achievement was obtained through an influx of  
Iranian Bahá'í refugees in the 1980s.  
Youth and Iranians were quickly integrated into the overriding  
ethic of dispersion, but native members were not. Although Indians  
make up approximately one third of the provincial membership, there  
is often little contact today between natives and non-natives. The  
reserve system acts as a block to the usual Bahá'í technique of  
"pioneering" to form new localities and establish stable  
administrative units. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

Title:       QURRATU'L-AYN TAHIRIH: A STUDY IN TRANSFORMATIONAL  
LEADERSHIP (TAHIRIH QURRATU'L AYN, IRAN)

Abstract:    The problem. The major intent of this study was to  
demonstrate how Tahirih's activities as an agent for change in  
mid-nineteenth century Iran qualify her for historical recognition as  
a transformational leader.  
Method. A working theoretical model of transformational  
leadership consisting of the following four constructs was  
synthesized out of a systematic review of the literature: (1) moral  
reasoning that is revolutionary in nature; (2) embodies conflict with  
courage and integrity; (3) inspirational and educational in nature;  
(4) followers carry on the work until desired vision is  
institutionalized. A review of the literature on the life of  
Qurratu'l-Ayn Tahirih was conducted, including an assessment of  
source credibility. Then an integrative qualitative content analysis  
of the published materials was conducted to show a "goodness of fit"  
between the life of Tahirih and the above mentioned characteristics  
of the transformational leader.  
Results. A major impact of Tahirih's efforts was the awakening of  
people to the needs for wider social justice for women. She promoted  
the right to intellectual moral reasoning—the right to independently  
investigate truth. Tahirih gained legendary fame in her own time for  
her revolutionary interpretation and eloquent exposition of the  
religious thought prevailing at the time in parts of Iran and Iraq.  
In course of time Tahirih's fame spread across national and  
religious boundaries. Tahirih initiated and embraced conflicts using  
techniques of intellectual moral reasoning, inspirational leadership,  
and spiritual purpose, which were intended to cause radical shifts in  
socio-cultural and religious practices. Women's rights movements in  
several countries have directly benefitted because of her efforts.  
She spoke of her vision of the coming of a new age of human  
development, and aligned herself with the Babi/Bahá'í Religious  
Movement.  
It was demonstrated that Tahirih was an agent for significant  
socio-cultural change and that she deserves recognition as a  
transformational leader. This study concludes that a fifth construct  
of spirituality be added to the above mentioned four constructs for  
analysis so that the transformational qualities exemplified by  
Tahirih and some other transformational leaders may be more  
adequately evaluated.

Abstract:    The present thesis offers a migration sociology-oriented  
contribution to refugee and exile research. It attempts to describe  
and analyse a specific example of persecution, flight and exile. The  
subject of this work is the religious persecution (of a group) of  
Iranian Bahá'í refugees in Iran, their flight from Iran and the  
consequences of their circumstances in exile in Switzerland. The  
present work is based on a theoretical confrontation with the subject  
and on an empirically qualitative investigation. This investigation  
is based on interviews with the Bahá'í refugees and with those active  
in two integration instances for Bahá'í refugees in their Swiss  
exile. This work attempts to provide a description and an analysis  
based on the example of the most elementary fundamentals on the  
Bahá'í religion and on examples of the circumstances suffered by the  
Bahá'í refugees since the Islamic revolution (persecution, flight,  
first country of exile, Swiss exile): Primarily, with the  
post-revolutionary, political, religious, structural and social  
outline conditions which led up to the illegal flight; secondly the  
flight; thirdly the living conditions in the first country of exile  
(Pakistan and Turkey) and fourthly on the structural and social  
outline conditions for the Bahá'í refugees in exile in Switzerland.

Title:       ACROSS THE BRIDGE: PENN SCHOOL AND PENN CENTER (SOUTH  
CAROLINA, CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT)

Abstract:    Early in the Civil War of the United States, federal  
forces took control of the sea islands at the southern tip of South  
Carolina, thus effectively liberating thousands of slaves. At the  
invitation of the federal government, northern abolitionists came to  
the Department of the South, as the area was called, and established  
schools to educate these freedmen. This occurred in 1862.  
One of the schools, Penn School on St. Helena Island, became the  
dominant Black educational institution of the area. In the early  
1900's, Penn School became a proving-ground for the Industrial  
Education Movement ideas and practices espoused by Booker T.  
Washington and Hollis B. Frissell of the Hampton Institute in  
Virginia. This dissertation contains transcripts of five interviews  
with graduates of Penn School, presenting their memories of Penn and  
its community.  
In 1948 Penn School became a community development institution  
called Penn Community Services, Inc. It acquired a reputation as a  
conference center for racially-mixed groups. During the 1960's it  
served as a meeting-place for numerous civil rights workers,  
including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Other racially mixed groups,  
such as the Bahá'ís, used the Center as a refuge for their meetings.  
During the 1970's Penn pioneered in the field of community  
development, helping local African-Americans retain their endangered  
land, helping minority businesses, providing child-care services, and  
providing educational programs for the Low Country community.  
By 1991, Penn Center, as it is called, is badly in need of  
renovation. A massive fund-raising campaign seeks to raise three  
million dollars. At the same time, it appears that Penn is in need of  
a new purpose to give it, once again, an important role to play on  
the national scene. Five interviews included in this dissertation are  
concerned with Penn's importance and future possibilities, and  
present an encouraging view of the Center's future.

Abstract:    This thesis will take particular interest in how  
Bahá'u'lláh overcomes theoretical obstacles to a realized eschaton,  
the most formidable of which is Islam's doctrine of revelatory  
finality founded on the Quranic designation of Muhammad as the "Seal  
of the Prophets" (Q. 33/40). Bahá'u'lláh sought to disenchant popular  
as well as clerical speculations on the eschaton, the impossibility  
of literal fulfillment of which effectively preempted its  
realization. This thesis will argue that Bahá'u'lláh advanced  
rhetorical-style arguments to establish that figuration underlies  
eschatological symbolism in the Gospels and the Qur'an.  
Classical Islamic approaches to symbolism will be critically  
assessed as to precedent, leaving aside questions of dependence.  
As to Bahá'u'lláh's own hermeneutic, this thesis will take  
Wansbrough's observations on the interdynamics of rhetorical and  
allegorical exegesis as a theoretical point of departure.  
Bahá'u'lláh's exegeses will be analyzed within what Wansbrough terms  
"procedural devices" employed across the spectrum of the classical  
exegetical tradition. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

Title:       THE QUEST FOR GLOBAL EDUCATION (WHOLISTIC EDUCATION,  
EDUCATION, MORAL EDUCATION, MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION)  
Author:      JOHNSON, BARBARA KAY VINCENT  
School:      THE UNION INSTITUTE (1033)  Degree: PHD  Date: 1990  
pp: 307  
Source:      DAI-A 51/11, p. 3665, May 1991

(0282); EDUCATION, RELIGIOUS (0527)  
  
Abstract:    Global education addresses the unprecedented challenges  
and opportunities of this global age. It views reality as a single  
system of interlocking systems. Hence, it finds that unilateral  
solutions to intertwined, interwoven, highly complex, and problematic  
circumstances simply fail to exist. Today's learners must learn to  
think in a whole way about whole situations. To do that they must be  
guided by principles that support life on the global scale:  
recognition of the oneness and wholeness of the human race, that this  
wholeness is supported by complexity and diversity, and that change  
is not only inevitable, it is the very warp and woof of life.  
These simple principles have profound implications for classroom  
learning and for "schools without walls;" for teaching methods and  
for classroom organization; for curriculum design and for response to  
the needs, aspirations, and resources of learners and of learning  
groups. Global education involves more that learning about peoples  
and places: it embraces aspects of basic education, multicultural  
education, cooperative education, wholistic education, transformative  
education, community-based education, and education for peace. It is  
one aspect of a comprehensive effort to serve the long-term learning  
needs of society in transition to global civilization.  
This inquiry into global education seeks to explain the unity  
that comprises life's natural diversity at all levels, from the  
person to the planet. It examines the implications of brain research  
for education; the need for a global perspective on all learning; and  
the value of multicultural and cooperative learning groups for  
integrating process and content learning goals. It discusses the  
concepts of care and justice as links between the person, the group,  
and the whole. It considers each aspect of global education in the  
light of illustrative experiences at the Maxwell International Bahá'í  
School, Shawnigan Lake, British Columbia, during its 1988-1989  
inaugural year.

Title:       RELIGION AND NATION-STATE FORMATION IN MELANESIA: 1945 TO  
INDEPENDENCE (PAPUA NEW GUINEA, SOLOMON ISLANDS, NEW  
HEBRIDES, MISSIONARIES)

EUROPEAN (0314)  
  
Abstract:    This thesis argues that Christian missions saw in the  
Melanesian colonies—Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and the New  
Hebrides—their last chance to establish "Christian nations". They  
contributed significantly to the emergence of independent states in  
the South Pacific during the period 1945-1980. Yet most missionaries  
sought to direct the nature of change without a clearly articulated  
concept of "the state". In the face of growing secularism most  
missions sought to maintain their "sectarian autonomy" by  
concentrating resources on their networks of schools, and clerical  
training institutions; and sought to influence both society and the  
state through educating personnel for public service and political  
offices. The effect of numerous missions placing themselves among  
newly contacted tribes for evangelistic purposes, paradoxically,  
contributed to the consolidation of colonial authority in those  
areas.  
The extent of continuing mission influence in Melanesian  
societies, from village to government level, is attributed partly to  
the effective development of a Melanesian "clerisy", and was also due  
in part to the involvement of missions as the (defacto) welfare  
branch of the secular state. Missions were consulted by colonial  
administrations in formulating new policies, and received funds to  
implement certain areas of governmental development and welfare  
programs, particularly education and health services. Such  
involvements led to an emphasis on the role of Christianity in  
attaining material development.  
The extension of missionary patronage to some areas of social and  
economic development, and missionary opposition to politico-religous  
movements, cargo-cults and separatist aspirations, amounted to both  
intentional and unintentional support for the emergent secular  
states. It is concluded that the "Christian nations" of Melanesia  
bear the marked influences of missionisation, but also face some  
unresolved dilemmas in sorting the religious content of Christianity  
from the European culture in which it was received.  
The major Roman Catholic orders and Protestant missions, as well  
as such smaller missions and religions as Bahá'í and Seventh Day  
Adventism are considered. As a regional study, the intention has not  
been to examine all facets of the missionary presence and  
relationship with colonialism, but to identify regional similarities  
in the course of church-state relations.

Title:       THE BAHA'I FAITH AND AMERICAN PROTESTANTISM

Subject:     RELIGION, HISTORY OF (0320); HISTORY, UNITED STATES (0337)  
  
Abstract:    The Bahá'í Faith is a religion that arose in the Islamic  
milieu of mid nineteenth century Iran and entered the United States  
in 1894, after its basic teachings had been defined and the writings  
of its prophet had been completed. The number of American Bahá'ís  
quickly rose to about fifteen hundred by 1899 and then remained  
roughly constant until the mid 1920s, when establishment of an  
organizational system allowed steady growth. During the years 1894 to  
1921, the members were predominantly (seventy-five percent or more)  
of Protestant background. Women constituted sixty-five to seventy  
percent of the converts, who were generally of Northern European,  
middle class backgrounds. Unlike many former Protestants, the  
American Bahá'ís sought to emphasize their continuities with  
Protestantism, and generally avoided strong criticism of it.  
American Bahá'ís understood their new religion very much through  
the lens of their Protestant heritage. They tended to interpret the  
Bible according to the traditional, common-sense hermeneutic of folk  
evangelicalism, and not through the hermeneutic of the Bahá'í  
scriptures. Bahá'í ideas of social reform were understood in a  
variety of ways resembling the spectrum of Protestant attitudes  
toward the social gospel, and were put into effect using the  
traditional form of the American voluntary association. Resistance to  
systematic organization of the Bahá'í religion can be traced to the  
antimodernist attitudes and intense individualism that characterized  
many converts. The American Bahá'ís utilized the historic events and  
basic principles of their new religion to define a new myth of  
America, one that contained much of the confidence and optimism of  
the traditional Protestant view of America as a "redeemer nation."  
American Bahá'ís expressed their new beliefs at Sunday Bahá'í worship  
services, where they sang Bahá'í hymns composed in traditional  
Christian form, or sang Protestant hymns whose theology was  
compatible with Bahá'í belief.  
The American Bahá'ís offer a good example of a people who have  
borrowed strongly from American Protestant culture to supplement or  
express their beliefs, but have done so within the theological  
guidelines of their religion. The Bahá'í Faith has remained small and  
comparatively obscure in America because of its emphasis on tolerance  
and non-confrontation, its persistent avoidance of socially deviant  
behavior, and because its teachings constitute a self-contained world  
view, separate from the western intellectual tradition.

Abstract:    Cette recherche avait pour objectif de cerner  
l'Integration culturelle des baha'is iraniens ayant emigre au Quebec,  
soit avant, soit apres le debut de la Revolution islamique en Iran  
(1978). Selon l'hypothese retenue, la participation a la communaute  
baha'ie quebecoise devait leur faciliter la vie et les aider a  
assumer, mieux et plus rapidement, un processus d'acculturation  
enrichissant. Aucune evidence ne soutient toutefois cette hypothese.  
Il ressort, a la suite de l'enquete effectuee (questionnaires et  
entrevues) que les baha'is iraniens ont a faire face aux memes  
difficultes que l'ensemble des immigrants venant de cultures tres  
differentes (orientales) de la culture quebecoise (occidentale). On  
constate que l'integration a la societe quebecoise est plus rapide en  
region et dans les petits centres que dans la grande region  
montrealaise. La question du rapport a l'enfant, de l'education a lui  
donner, des valeurs a lui transmettre, semble un point  
particulierement sensible. Les parents baha'is iraniens jugent  
necessaire d'accentuer l'education spirituelle qu'ils donnent a leurs  
enfants, afin de contrebalancer les effets de la societe materialiste  
dans laquelle ils evoluent maintenant.

Abstract:    The Canadian artist Emily Carr (1871-1945), has previously  
been examined in terms of her relationships to the Toronto based  
Group of Seven and to the land and forests of British Columbia. The  
present study examines her artistic development in terms of her  
documented and probable knowledge of modernism outside the confines  
of Canada.  
The study considers Carr's work in the context of her early  
education in Los Angeles, England and France. It takes into account  
her fascination, similar to that of other modern artists of her time,  
with primitive culture, in her case the Northwest Coast Indians. The  
important influences of Mark Tobey and Lawren Harris are discussed.  
The study proposes that perhaps the single greatest sustained  
influence on her work in terms of modernist style and thought, was  
her trip to New York City in 1930, when she was 58. It examines her  
exposure to, and in some cases meetings with, Charles Burchfield,  
Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, and Katherine Dreier. Her attraction  
to Theosophy and Bahá'í are also discussed. An appreciation of Carr's  
late paintings concludes the study, showing that the renaissance of  
her artistic vision came from sources in the United States as well as  
from the Canadian forest.

Abstract:    The study investigated the literary norms used by Shoghi  
Effendi in his translation into English of Bahá'u'lláh's Arabic  
Hidden Words. An analysis of his education and language acquistion  
was undertaken along with an in-depth examination of The Hidden  
Words, its structure, literary influences and place in the  
Arabo-Persian literary system.  
It was determined that Shoghi Effendi's objectives in translating  
the work into English affected his English rendition. The Hidden  
Words is considered a scriptural work and he, therefore, sought to  
have it accorded the reverent attitude reserved for such texts by  
employing the following four major norms: (1) Interpretation (in his  
capacity as Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith); (2) Elevation (couching  
the translation in language associated with scripture in the English  
literary polysystem; (3) Beautification (traditionally considered a  
necessary attribute of sacred literature, and (4) Euphonization of  
the text (to enhance its impact in recitation). The translator's  
overriding goals or purposes find expression in the textual goals,  
the actual objectives of the specific translation. The major norms  
are implemented by subordinate norms. Thus, two levels of goals and  
of norms have been isolated and analyzed.

Abstract:    This dissertation examines the Bahá'í approach to the  
fundamental dimensions of educational goals and curriculum aims,  
which are concerned with values, purposes, and broad questions about  
the meaning of life, the nature of man, and the ideal state of social  
being.  
Critical considerations are:  (1) A Cultural Analysis of  
Education. The underlying assumption embodies the idea that the  
problem of finding a unifying frame of reference for curriculum is  
intertwined with the fragmentation of cultural patterns of thinking,  
feeling, and acting. For this reason, the study alleges that  
education, as a social institution, if considered apart from the  
process of cultural change, does not offer a significant alternative  
to the growing complexity of human problems. The foregoing argument  
suggests that a philosophy about cultural change is logically prior  
to an inclusive theory of education. It is further argued that the  
necessary and desirable educational dispositions are the ones which  
have been derived from the aims, principles, and methods of such a  
unifying philosophy. (2) A Methodical Presentation of the  
Philosophical Assumptions, and Fundamental Principles of the Bahá'í  
Faith. This section includes a study of the Bahá'í paradigm as a  
reference for organizing elements of an emerging world culture which  
is based on organic oneness of mankind, peace, and justice. The  
latter characteristics are used to generate curriculum aims. (3)  
Identification of Curriculum Aims. Two desirable curriculum aims,  
drawn upon principles from the Bahá'í Faith, are formulated and  
identified as "the spiritual aim" and "the social aim". "The  
spiritual aim" is derived from the Bahá'í premise concerning the  
perennial purpose of religion which focuses upon the processes of  
human perfection and individual transformation. "The social aim" of  
curriculum, on the other hand, is concerned with a second premise of  
the Bahá'í Faith, the social purpose of religion, which focuses upon  
the processes of cultural change and social reconstruction.  
In conclusion, it is argued that since the full and harmonious  
development of man's spiritual nature requires an appropriate social  
environment, the curriculum, in order to be comprehensive, must  
address the processes of both individual transformation and social  
change. These two aims are then considered mutually interactive and  
together provide a matrix for the development of a comprehensive  
curriculum theory.

Title:       THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF BAHA'I EDUCATION IN THE

Subject:     EDUCATION, HISTORY OF (0520)  
  
Abstract:    This study investigates the history and development of  
Bahá'í education in the United States, beginning with Ibrahim  
Kheirallah's arrival in Chicago in 1892 and the inauguration of his  
classes on an informal basis. Many people were attracted to the new  
teachings, and within a few years, Bahá'í classes were held in many  
states.  
After communication was established between American believers  
and  Abdu'l-Bahá (the Interpreter and Examplar of the Faith), the  
first group of American Bahá'ís visited Him in the Holy Land in 1898  
and learned principles of Bahá'í education. Some remained in the Holy  
Land to study the teachings in depth and learn Persian and Arabic. On  
their return, they translated and printed books and guidelines and  
held more classes for children and adults.  
In April 1912,  Abdu'l-Bahá came to the United States. During his  
eight-month stay, he visited a number of educational institutions and  
individuals associated with education. He presented discourses at  
many universities, including Columbia, Howard, and Stanford. He  
revealed many tablets on the subject of education and constantly  
encouraged developments in that field.  
After  Abdu'l-Bahá's death, Shoghi Effendi (the Guardian of the  
Faith) took a keen interest in the advancement of Bahá'í schools and  
encouraged their development toward the ideal Bahá'í universities of  
the future.  
Fifty-two Bahá'í schools have been established in the United  
States, the first in 1929 in Green Acre, Maine. In 1984, Louhelen was  
the first Bahá'í school to be approved for development as a college.  
Louhelen is a two-year college with a special educational program and  
is affiliated with Mott Community College and the University of  
Michigan-Flint. The Louhelen Council has adopted a ten-year plan to  
establish the groundwork for an eventual Bahá'í university. Bahá'í  
education identifies three kinds of education—material, human, and  
spiritual. Spiritual education and character training are integral  
parts of the curriculum in Bahá'í education.

AMERICAN RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT

Abstract:    American Bahá'ís belong to an international religious  
movement whose 2 million members follow the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh,  
a 19th century Persian religious teacher. The aim of this study was  
to examine how American Bahá'ís interpret their religion and how  
those understandings shape their social interactions.  
Data were gathered in 15 months of ethnographic research among  
Bahá'ís in central Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. I conducted  
intensive, open-ended interviews with 55 American Bahá'ís including  
"new believers" (recent converts), "old believers," and people raised  
as Bahá'ís; informants were questioned about their religious  
backgrounds, about how they became Bahá'ís, and about their  
experiences as Bahá'ís. I also collected Bahá'í written accounts and  
took field notes at American Bahá'í meetings, lectures, classes, and  
other events.  
A cultural analysis of these materials showed that American  
Bahá'ís interpret the Bahá'í religion primarily as a narrative for  
culturally constituting the individual. This finding supports  
evidence, from other analyses of American culture, that Americans  
tend to privatize their concepts of social forms. The American Bahá'í  
concept of religion as an aid in search of the self contrasts with  
Bahá'í doctrine, which holds individuals to be important mainly as  
instruments of God's plan to transform society.  
Further analysis revealed that the conversations in which these  
self-shapings are developed generate the social networks of American  
Bahá'í life. Potential converts become Bahá'ís by being drawn into  
dialogues where their past lives are recast, in an American Bahá'í  
framework, as paths leading them to the Bahá'í faith. After "seekers"  
convert, these networks are reproduced in ongoing conversations about  
the self—for example, about "tests" that Bahá'u'lláh sends believers  
to advance their spiritual progress.  
In sum, a cultural analysis of the Bahá'í faith in an American  
context shows how religious discourse can be appropriated for other  
purposes in particular settings—in the American setting I studied,  
as a tool for defining the self. This finding offers an alternative  
to prevailing social science models that see conversion to "cults"  
and "sects" as something exotic to be explained by social function or  
psychological need, rather than as a reproduction of a fundamental  
American cultural concept: the individual.

Subject:     EDUCATION, ADULT AND CONTINUING (0516)  
  
Abstract:    The purpose of this dissertation is twofold. First, it  
seeks to substantiate the inclusion of spiritual ideals within the  
planning and development of non-formal education programs. As such,  
the review of the literature will also develop a rationale. This  
rationale is a philosophical and historical investigation of the  
central premises of formal education and the development of an  
alternative philosophical foundation more relevant to the problems of  
rural development. It proposes that the central dilemma of the modern  
epoch is a confusion of first principles; that human affairs and the  
systems designed to serve them have been impoverished by the  
wholesale application of a reductionist paradigm. This paradigm works  
extremely well for the physical sciences, but is wholly inadequate  
when applied to human affairs. The humanitarian ideal as enunciated  
by Socrates and Plato is suggested as a much more appropriate  
paradigm for human service systems.  
The second purpose of the dissertation is the development of some  
initial educational materials and strategies that could symbolize  
spiritual concepts in a way which would permit dialogue with a  
non-literate population. A developmental project operationalizing the  
theoretical premises outlined in the rationale is initiated. This  
project involves the selection of a rural, non-literate population  
and develops symbolical vehicles and educational strategies designed  
to disseminate these concepts to this population. This will primarily  
involve the development of a booklet of visual analogies. The target  
populations are selected communities in South Carolina and Georgia  
comprised of members of the Baha'(')i Faith, a worldwide, independent  
religion.  
The planned methodology is described in Chapter III. However,  
what emerges from the project's development is something quite  
different from what was anticipated at the outset. The "emergent  
outcomes" enable the author to critique the value of empirical models  
of evaluation within non-formal settings. This critique and the  
results of the evaluation are contained within Chapter V. The  
dissertation concludes by suggesting possible approaches to  
evaluation and program structure which are more consonant with the  
philosophical premises enshrined in the humanitarian ideal.

Subject:     MASS COMMUNICATIONS (0708)  
  
Abstract:    The dominant paradigm of communication, specifically  
traditional theories of communication and the institutional models  
derived from those theories, has proved inadequate to promote the  
social and economic development of "marginalized" people,  
particularly the rural poor in developing countries. This study  
suggests that James Carey's "ritual" theory of communication offers a  
more adequate theoretical description of the communication process  
and that the "ritual" theory finds its practical corollary in the  
notion of "community participation"—peoples' access to,  
participation in and, ultimately, self-management of the social  
institutions that affect their lives.  
Few attempts have been made to apply principles of participation  
to development-oriented media messages and institutions. The primary  
purpose of this historical-analytical study is to examine the  
principles and practices of Radio Bahá'í in Otavalo, Ecuador, perhaps  
the first media institution in the world dedicated to  
institutionalizing "participation" in all aspects of its operations.  
Through document research, interviews, and participant-observation  
techniques, the study examines the philosophy, administrative  
structure, management practices, operational procedures, program  
content, production and training methodologies of Radio Bahá'í. In  
addition, two surveys assessed audience response to the station and  
its programming.  
The study found that Radio Bahá'í was very popular and played a  
significant role in promoting the social and economic development of  
its primary audience—rural, indigenous peasants. This success is  
attributable in part to methods of operation based on principles of  
participation derived from a "ritual" paradigm—in this case, the  
Bahá'í teachings. As a result, virtually all of the elements deemed  
essential to a participatory institution are found in Radio Bahá'í.  
The findings suggest that a "ritual" theory of communication  
holds great promise for the advancement of the field of communication  
and that the model of a participatory media institution developed by  
the station is a significant innovation worthy of replication and  
adaptation in both agrarian and industrialized societies.

Abstract:    This study of adult conversion to the Bahá'í Faith was  
undertaken in order to empirically verify two theoretical models that  
seek to explain religious conversion. The models proposed by Lofland  
and Stark (1965) and Snow, Zucker and Ekland-Olson (1980) are  
examined using interview data from twenty-three informants. The  
findings indicate that neither model is adequate to account for  
conversion in this group. Certain characteristics of the Bahá'í  
belief system seem to best account for the failure of both models to  
adequately account for religious conversion to the Bahá'í Faith.  
In order to understand these beliefs and how they affect  
recruitment into the Bahá'í, the basic principles of the Faith, as  
they are usually first encountered by potential recruits, are  
presented in Chapter I. The origins of the Bahá'í Faith are then  
traced. Chapter II compares the ideas of evil and the concept of a  
good man in the Bahá'í and Zoroastrian belief systems. The concepts  
of the Mihdi and the Iman as they affected the emergence of the Bab  
and the Babi religion under Shiih Islam in Iran are examined in  
Chapter III. The development of the Bahai Faith under its prophet  
Bahá'u'lláh and its next two leaders, 'Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi  
are covered in Chapter IV. The passing of power from an individual  
leader to the Universal House of Justice and the Bahá'í  
administrative system are presented in Chapter V. Chapter VI deals  
with the Local Spiritual Assembly in Rio Vista. Material on religious  
mobility drawn from the literature is set forth in Chapter VII, while  
Chapter VIII is a detailed summary of the conversion experience of  
the twenty-three informants. The last chapter examines the two models  
using the material from the interviews. Conclusions are offered as to  
why the two models fail to account for conversion among the Bahá'í  
and a model is proposed that more adequately explains the process in  
this community.

Abstract:    The Problem. The purpose of the study was the formulation  
of a psychological theory on martyrdom, based upon a content analysis  
of last available personal documents of Bahá'í martyrs of Iran  
written between 1979 and 1982.  
Method. A content analysis research design and methodology was  
employed. Written communications were analyzed in order to test 2  
general hypotheses and 14 subhypotheses and make inferences about the  
psychological characteristics of the communicators to assess their  
beliefs and responses.  
Results. The first hypothesis, which proposed that the personal  
documents of the Bahá'í martyrs reveal that their internalized  
beliefs, in the face of severe social stressors, follow an  
unconventionally positive stress-belief pattern, was supported.  
Analysis of the data using frequency distribution and percentage  
distribution on seven belief components yielded a significant mean  
percentage of occurrence of 95.2 percent. The second hypothesis,  
which predicted that the personal documents of the Bahá'í martyrs  
reveal that their responses to severe social stressors follow an  
unconventionally positive stress-response pattern, was supported.  
Frequency distribution and percentage distribution on seven response  
components yielded a significant mean percentage of occurrence of  
91.9 percent.  
Results of the study supported the premises that in individuals  
undergoing persecution and imminent execution, faith and belief in a  
cause—spiritual in this case—gives them a new and unique meaning to  
suffering which transforms fear and anxiety into joy. It also creates  
a sense of acceptance, an enlightenment which arouses courage, and a  
perceived transcendental opportunity to affirm the truth of their  
belief and their love for mankind. Pain and suffering were converted  
into a responsibility and commitment to their faith. Without  
neglecting, and with full attention to, their biological world, the  
world of relationships, and their own unique personal realm, they  
acknowledged their tragic situation and transformed it into a source  
of tranquility and certitude in the meaning and purpose of their  
lives.

Abstract:    This dissertation is primarily an examination of the  
impact of Mark Tobey's adherence to the Baha'(')i religion upon the  
content of his paintings. Tobey was firmly committed to this religion  
from 1918 until his death in 1976. His philosophy and attitudes about  
the meaning of life, the course of history, the prospects for the  
future of civilization, and the importance of artistic expression,  
were in conformity with the tenets of the Baha'(')i Faith.  
After a brief introduction, chapter one discusses the artistic  
environment within which Tobey developed. Associated with the New  
York avant-garde before 1920, Tobey was subsequently in contact with  
other major modern artistic movements of this century during their  
early stages of development in America. The summary of his artistic  
biography is followed by a chapter describing Tobey's early contacts  
with the Baha'(')i Faith, and a brief discussion of the Faith's  
history and basic principles. This chapter also includes the  
highlights of Tobey's Baha'(')i activities and his statements about  
his beliefs.  
Chapter four examines Tobey's early attempts at religious  
expression using representational means. His development of modes of  
expressing concepts beyond external appearances is the topic of the  
fifth chapter. The integration of his non-objective pictorial  
solutions with the use of Arabic and Persian calligraphy as religious  
iconography is explored next. Chapter seven reevaluates the influence  
of Asian art upon Tobey's paintings, distinguishing between the  
"calligraphic impulse" he received from Chinese and Japanese art and  
the use of Middle Eastern calligraphy as content.  
Light, time and space, and Revelation are three recurrent themes  
in Tobey's work. In chapter eight these themes are examined in  
relation to Baha'(')i teachings, especially as expressed in books  
owned by Tobey and in statements he made about these subjects. The  
impact of the Baha'(')i Faith upon Tobey's formal development, as  
well as upon the content of his paintings, is summarized in the  
conclusion. A coda assesses the status of Mark Tobey in twentieth  
century art.

Abstract:    The Baha'(')i Faith is a worldwide religious faith with  
approximately 4 million adherents in 363 countries, including 100,000  
members in the United States. An international Baha'(')i traveling  
teacher is one who travels overseas on a temporary assignment to  
assist the host-country Baha'(')i institutions with their plans and  
programs. The purpose of this investigation was to determine  
selection criteria and training needs for international Baha'(')i  
traveling teachers.  
Following a literature review of the fields of cross-cultural  
communication and international training design, and a content  
analysis of traveling teacher reports, a questionnaire was developed,  
tested, and mailed to 200 returned teachers, and to Baha'(')i  
institutions in the 81 countries they had visited.  
Responses reflect the diversity of the travel-teaching  
experience. Field conditions encountered by teachers are described,  
activities performed and resources used are ranked by importance and  
need for instruction, desirable teacher characteristics are  
specified, critical incidents are discussed, and major influences on  
performance are determined. A correlational analysis indicates that  
travel-teaching success is largely related to careful planning and  
regular assistance from the host Baha'(')i community. A factor  
analysis shows Team Composition, Trip Purpose, Types of Co-workers,  
and Planning and Supervision, to be the four main components  
underlying success.  
Based on the findings, selection criteria are recommended, and a  
four-level orientation and training program is outlined. The program  
emphasizes job competence, language fluency, cross-cultural  
communication, area studies, and overseas living and travel skills.

Subject:     EDUCATION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0998)  
  
Abstract:    The purpose was to derive the educational implications of  
the Bahá'í philosophy with special consideration of the concept of  
unity as an underlying structure of both Bahá'í philosophy and Bahá'í  
education. The Bahá'í Faith is a new, independent, universal religion  
founded by Bahá'u'lláh in the middle of the nineteenth century in  
Iran. Although a religion, the Bahá'í Faith shows clear outlooks of  
metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical issues wherein the concept  
of unity plays an absolutely essential role. In the three key  
elements of Bahá'í metaphysics (God, the Manifestations, the created  
world) unity is embodied in various principles. When the world of God  
is concerned, the three most important principles are:  (a) absolute  
unity of the essence and the attributes of God; (b) unity of God and  
His Manifestations; and (c) the world of creation as an echo of the  
unity of God. In the world of the Manifestations the two essential  
tenets are:  (a) the unity underlying the reality of the  
Manifestations and (b) the unity of the Manifestations' Missions to  
advance mankind toward world unity. Unity is also shown in at least  
two principles when the human being is concerned:  (a) the essential  
unity of the spiritual, intellectual, and physical dimensions of man  
and (b) the necessity for unity of mankind. In the Bahá'í  
epistemological system the concept of unity is emphasized when the  
teachings show that there must be a harmonious utilization of all  
modes of knowing. The Bahá'í belief in essentiality of both relative  
and absolute values is based upon the significance of unity in the  
Bahá'í ethical system.  
Metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical foundations of the  
Bahá'í Faith are the major sources for deriving a Bahá'í approach to  
education. Bahá'í metaphysics implies that not only must there be a  
unity of the elements involved in the educative processes, education  
must function as a unifying force, helping to unite both the diverse  
factors in human existence as well as the members of the human race.  
The basic principle of unity of all epistemological modes directly  
implies that different instructional methodologies be considered  
complementary and be utilized harmoniously. In brief, the concept of  
unity is embodied in and dominates almost all the elements of  
education, including the nature of curriculum, the role of the  
teacher, and the function of administrative bodies. All of these  
elements must function as integrated and united wholes in order to  
serve effectively the two most fundamental goals of Bahá'í education:  
the harmonious development of the individual and the advancement of  
human societies towards world unity.

Abstract:    The purpose of this investigation was to point out two  
methodological deficiencies in the area of differential fertility  
research in the Middle East and to propose possible refinements in  
the method to correct the deficiencies. (1) To control for the  
possible contaminating effects of the non-Iranian national origins of  
the Christians previously studied, this research investigated and  
compared another religious minority in Iran, namely Bahá'ís, who are  
an indigenous population and who comprise the largest religious  
minority group. (2) To correct the second methodological shortcoming,  
it was proposed that religious affiliation per se should not weigh as  
heavily in determining individual behavior as should the degree of  
religiosity: the feelings, beliefs, practices, and knowledge of their  
respective religions.  
The following hypothesis was formulated and tested: Bahá'ís and  
Moslems differ in family planning because specific religious factors  
present in Islam tend to impede its practice. Among these are:  (1)  
the absence of equal rights and statuses between men and women, a  
fact which tends to discourage women from pursuing formal education,  
making decisions about their social and personal lives such as number  
of children, and (2) a high level of fatalism which discourages  
planning, rational decision making, and the utilization of modern  
medical and health measures.  
A scale of socio-economic status was devised to measure this  
independent variable. Another scale was developed to measure the  
intervening variable of degree of religiosity of Moslems and Bahá'ís.  
The result indicated that in the Moslem village, the birthrate  
was higher, the number of desired children was higher than the number  
of pregnancies, the number of children who were born was lower than  
the number of pregnancies, the number of children who lived was the  
lowest of all. Furthermore, the number of accidents and losses for  
baby girls among the Areteh villagers (Moslem) was more than that for  
baby boys. This reflects the desirability and preferences for male  
offspring among Moslems.  
The findings in the present investigation confirmed that Bahá'ís  
and Moslems in Iran indeed differ in their pattern of family planning  
desires, attitudes, and practicies in all categories of  
socio-economic status, residential and religious commitment.

Title:       THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF THE BAHA'I FAITH

Abstract:    Since its beginning in 1844, the Bahá'í Faith has spread  
to all parts of the non-Communist world. At first, the religion was  
confined to Persia and Iraq where Shi'ah Islam is dominant, but after  
Bahá'u'lláh (Prophet-founder of the religion) was banished to distant  
parts of the Ottoman Empire the movement was able to penetrate many  
areas of the Sunni world as well. In 1893 the religion was  
transmitted to North America from where, over a period of six  
decades, a vigorous campaign of global dissemination was undertaken.  
By 1953, the religion was well established on all continents;  
thereafter, global diffusion proceeded from a number of widely  
distributed centers of the religion rather than from just the two  
older core areas (Persia and North America).  
The Bahá'í Faith has always pursued an expansionist policy  
consisting of three main strategies: numerical increase, geographical  
dispersion, and compositional diversity of the membership. In the  
early years, growth was generally encouraged by the charismatic  
leaders of the religion, but from 1919 on expansion was directed by  
definitive and authoritative plans embodying the three main  
strategies for growth. These plans have become broader and more  
detailed in the past few decades so that today Bahá'í expansion is  
guided by very precise objectives for increasing the numbers and  
kinds of believers and for insuring that they are widely dispersed.  
The objective of this research has been to describe and account  
for the growth and spread of the Bahá'í Faith. The religion has been  
considered as an innovation, and its dissemination has been viewed as  
a consequence of its internal structure and decision-making patterns.  
It was found that a strong and centralized leadership has facilitated  
diffusion, that religious beliefs have favored dissemination efforts,  
and that policy and planning have successfully directed Bahá'í  
expansion.  
At the same time, the staging and direction of Bahá'í expansion  
frequently has been influenced by attitudes, conditions, and events  
lying outside the direct control of the Bahá'í movement. For example,  
in its early years the religion was geographically confined by its  
cultural context and religious roots while later on political  
conditions frequently influenced where the movement could and could  
not become established. In general, physical, social, and economic  
distance have inhibited diffusion, but aggressive dissemination  
policies and ambitious growth plans have greatly weakened the force  
of these traditional resistors to diffusion.  
Between 1893 and 1953 North America was the main geographic  
source of Bahá'í expansion. Within this area, growth was substantial  
but not constant. In the first few decades there were alternating  
periods of growth and decline and only after the 1920s did the  
religion begin to increase its membership at a steadily accelerating  
rate. The capacity of the movement to enlarge appears to have  
depended on unanimous acceptance of religious authority; growth  
proceeded regularly whenever the leadership and the administrative  
order were recognized by all Bahá'ís, but diffusion was curtailed  
whenever these repositories of religious authority were questioned by  
a part of the religion's membership.  
Throughout the twentieth century, Bahá'í growth in North America  
has been dependent on conversions; natural increase has always been a  
minor source of expansion. Continent-wide dissemination of the  
religion has relied heavily on migration of believers, usually from  
large urban centers containing Bahá'í concentrations to other  
locations where believers have been few or absent. This pattern has  
been strongly encouraged and has resulted in a highly dispersed  
Bahá'í community, a condition which also exists at the global level.

Title:       A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE POETRY OF ROBERT HAYDEN THROUGH  
HIS MIDDLE YEARS

Abstract:    The purpose of this dissertation is to present a critical  
study of Robert Hayden's poetry from nineteen forty to nineteen  
sixty-six: from his early to his middle period. A product of  
Afro-American and white American literary traditions, he was once a  
member of the Wright Protest School. At the core of Hayden's poetry  
is his conviction that poetry is a means by which he can correct  
racial stereotypes and distortion of Afro-American history. His  
interest in Afro-American and other oppressed groups aligns him with  
humanistic writers who have championed the cause of the dignity and  
human rights of man. Hayden is a symbolist poet writing in the modern  
romantic tradition, but his fidelity to facts relates him to the  
realists. "The deep immortal wish / the timeless will" to be free,  
and the positive force of Divine love are central themes in his  
poetry.  
Notwithstanding his recent national honors, Hayden is still a  
relatively unknown American poet. Therefore, this dissertation  
includes a brief biography which serves both to introduce the poet to  
the audience and provide insight into his shaping influences,  
motivating factors, and resources.  
The Great Depression provides the perspective through which  
Hayden handled the material of his first volume, and it motivated the  
humanistic concern in much of his subsequent poetry. Heart Shape in  
the Dust (1940) reveals Hayden's early leftist sympathies and, more  
importantly, it initiates his Afro-American history themes. Poems of  
didactic statement characterize this apprentice work, but it  
demonstrates some regard for style and non-topical American Marxist  
content that foreshadows Hayden's later achievement.  
Hayden's poems, free of leftist preaching and rhetorical style,  
form the first half of The Lion and the Archer (1948) (co-author  
Myron O'Higgins' poems comprise the second half). Hayden's pivotal  
style in this volume marks the beginning of his twenty-three-year  
pilgrimage to the South. Mastery of modern prosody distinguishes the  
dominant theme, the historically dehumanizing relationship between  
Black and white Southerners.  
Figure of Time (1955), Hayden's third work, introduces his  
religious and ghetto verse. The Bahá'í concept of the oneness of  
mankind in Divine love replaces the rejected political promise of  
Communism. His ghetto verses in this volume evoke the sense of  
displacement, alienation, desperation, and joy ghetto people know.  
A Ballad of Remembrance (1962) is dominated by Hayden's  
Afro-American history and Mexican poems. "Veracruz," one of his  
Mexican poems, extends his humanistic concern for the poor to include  
consideration of international groups, and "Middle Passage" is the  
signal Afro-American history poem. The volume is largely responsible  
for gaining Hayden the international recognition accorded him in his  
Grand Prix de Poesie award received at the First International  
Festival of Negro Arts held at Dakar, Senegal, 1966.  
Selected Poems (1966), is Hayden's second major American  
publication, and won for him limited but substantial national  
recognition and, in his view, really began his poetic career. It  
consists largely of the Ballad of Remembrance collection, carefully  
and characteristically revised and rearranged, as well as thirteen  
miscellaneous works of which "The Diver," a symbolic, private poem,  
is signal.  
Hayden's poetry at this point of his development transcends the  
limitations of mere social protest. A more mature craftsman, he was  
beginning to get the critical acclaim that he deserved, and had  
become a powerful poet who shaped his verse with probing insight into  
his characters and their place in the historical continuum. By  
depicting the way society has brutalized and dehumanized the  
Afro-American, Hayden tried to make a dent in his reader's  
conscience. He demands that Afro-Americans be recognized as human  
beings. If America does not know who its dispossessed are, Hayden  
insists, America does not really know itself, an indictment  
vindicated by events in the violent 'sixties.
