This thesis is a study of the development of the Bab1 movement and the political

implications embodied in its religious teachings. The thesis basically assumes that in its

early development (1844-1848), the movement may be seen merely as religiously

dissenting from the mainstream of Shi'i tradition. In the course of history, however, and
•   especially after the Bib, its founder, claimed in 1848 to   be the return of the Hidden Imam

> and proclaimed the abrogation of Qur'anic    shan'a, the Bab1 movement showed radical
> tendencies, thus threatening the established religious and political authorities. This later

development (1848-1853) was characterized by armed revolts by the Bahls against the

government troops. This thesis also examines the nature of Babi religious dissent and

demonstrate that the Babi revolts were to a large extent based on religious motives.

It is my pleasant duty, first of all, to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Todd

Lawson, my thesis supervisor, whose scholarly criticism and genuine interest have made

this thesis possible. Professor Lawson has developed my academic insight and helped me

understand a variety of Shi 'i concepts and historical developments. He was also helpful in

providing me a number of important sources. His constructive advice, encouragement and

patience are highly appreciated.

My thanks also go to Professor A. Oner Turgay, the Director of the Institute of

Islamic Studies, for his advice and encouragement. I would also like to thank my teachers

at the Institute, Professors Donald P. Little, my fonner academic advisor, Hermann
I   Landolt, Eric L. Ormsby, and Issa J. Boullata. They have in different ways widened my

academic horizon with regard to Arabic historiography, Islamic mysticism, thought and

Qur' anic   exegesis through their challenging courses from 1996 to 1998.

I wish to extend my thanks to the Canadian International Development Agency

(CIDA) for scholarship support, and to all the staff of the McGill- Indonesia Project Office

at McGill University for their assistance. My thanks are also due to Ms. Salwa Ferahian

and Wayne St. Thomas of the Islamic Studies Library for their assistance during my

studies at the Institute. I would also like to record my thanks to Jeffrey C. Burke for his

useful help in the early stages of my study; and to Yasmine Badr, Steve Miller, and

Richard McGregor for their editorial assistance.

•                                           Introduction

> The   Babi       movement constitutes   an interesting phenomenon      in   Islamic   history,
> particularly in that of Twelver (Ithna 'Ashar1) Shi 'ism. The movement was founded by

S ayyid 'Afi MuQ.ammad (1819-1850), a young merchant of Shiraz, who in 1844 claimed

> that he was the gate    (bab) to the Hidden Imam. The doctrines which were formulated by
> the Bab in his various works were largely inspire d by Shaykhl thought, developed by

> Shaykh Alpnad Al}.sa1 (d.l826) in the early nineteenth century, and then further
> elaborated by his disciple, Sayyid K�im Rashfi (d.l844). As will be seen in this study,

the Bab's claim in 1844 to being the gate, and in 1848 to being the Mahcfi (the Qa'im),

seems to have been based on Rashfi's prophecy and on the Shaykhi doctrine of the
•                                           r

> progressive nature of divine revelation. The Bib's higher claim thus abrogated the
Islamic shanPia and proclaimed the coming of a new shan'a or religion.

Iran of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was to a large degree a

society whose religious and political undercurrents favored the emergence of Sh1 '1

messianic    and    millenarian movements. 2 From a theoretical point of view, such

1Sayyid �m Rashti's    view on this subject is expressed in his Shar� al-Qa�[da al­
Ltimfya, which was written in 1258/1842 at the request of Ali RicJa P ash i, the governor of

•   movements tend to develop in societies where little distinction is made between religion

and politics. Such movements also acquire momentum particularly in societies where

social discontent, injustice, discrimination and economic turmoil exist. Iranian society of

this time therefore may be seen         as   a fertile soil for the rapid growth of millenarian

movements. Moreover, there as elsewhere, these movements, more often than not, had

political implications.

Scholars have paid considerable attention to Babism               as   a socio-religious

movement. They have studied the movement from many different perspectives, and have

laid particular emphasis on different aspects of the movement. Ivanov, fo r example, sees

the Babi movement as "a popular mass movement, born out of definite social conditions

Abdulhussein Sachedina, Islamic Messianism: The Idea of the Mahdi in Twelver Shrism
•   (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1981).

3A few centuries preceding the Bab's claim, as Arjomand points out, "the leader of the
> Safavid movement, Shah lsma'il ( 1 501-1524), claimed to be the Mahdi, and was worshipped by
> his Turkman followers as the reincarnation of 'Ali and the other Imam -indeed as the incarnation
> of God. However, the Safavid rulers modified their millenarian claims to being the lieutenants of
> the Hidden Imam." Arjomand, ''Millennia! Beliefs, Hierocratic Authority, and Revolution in
> Shi'ite Iran," 222. See also Said Amir Arjomand, The Shadow of God and the Hidden Imam:

> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984), 182. The movement of millenarian tendencies that
> developed in late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, such as the revived Ni 'matullah1 $uti
order, will be discussed in the last section of Chapter One.

and directed against the ruling class." He also describes the Bab1 revolts as uprisings of

upeasants, artisans, urban poor, and small trades-people" against feudalism and the

"enslavement of the country by foreign capital." Another scholar, Peter Avery, contends

that Babism "may be taken as a sign that the mercantile class and some of the religious

classes associated with merchants were aware of the necessity for taking the matter of

reform and modernization into their own hands."          However. it is difficult to observe

whether the Bab1s aimed primarily at reforming certain aspects of Iranian life. Avery

moreover maintains that among the elements which constituted the basis of the Babi

movement was the element of protest against social and economic injustice, the protest

against the subordination of the orthodox 'ulama to the government, and the protest

against spiritual decadence. 8 An observer, Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau, observes

•   that the Bib's ideal was to establish "a government at once monarchical, theocratic and

democratic," all of which implies the political nature of the Bib's mission.

Viewing it from a historical perspective, Bayat regards the Bib1 movement as

> having represented the continuation of the tradition of dissent in   S hi � Islam. The advent
> of Babism also marked the occurrence of messianic revolts as well as the beginning of      a

•   politicization of religious dissent.

Moreover, she argues that the Babi movement

"constituted a revolutionary social movement irreconcilably hostile to the established

political and religious order., However, this view can be questioned, particularly with

regard to the extent of this "hostility". In addition, Bayat maintains that the popularity of

the Babi movement lies particularly in the "strong laicization trends implicit in the Babi

system." The non-existence of the Babi clergy "proved to be extremely appealing to those

members of the religious institutions who traditionally rebelled against the authority and

social influence of the mujtahids."

Abbas Amanat has offered an excellent study based on historical analysis of the
Babi movement, which includes its birth, growth and the formation of the Babi

community. He maintains that the movement constituted a response. to the prevailing

•   socio-moral atmosphere by advancing the necessity of reforming religious doctrine.

Amanat also observes the importance of messianic and millenarian beliefs embodied in

the Babi doctrine, such as those which concern the notion of progressive revelation and

the advent of the Hidden Imam.

From one perspective, the Babi movement may be described as a ••value-oriented

movement," which may result in religiously inspired revolts. In such a movement

religious beliefs and doctrines provide the most important basis for challenging the

•   legitimacy of the existing political authority. 14 Moreover, this challenge may also lead to

> an attempt to establish an independent political entity. However, the development of such
> a movement depends mostly on the response of the political regime. The movement will
> flourish when supported by the political elite, but in most cases, it will face suppression
> and persecution, which may bring about its collapse or transformation into a                  new

movement.

One of the most vital elements in such a movement is charismatic leadership,
> which normally serves as a symbolic focus of identification and, to some extent, a source
> of authority.15 Although in such a movement there            are   attempts made by leaders to

> Bib, as will be seen, was not a leader of this type. However, it may have been that the
•   growing admiration for the Bab served as a source of motivation for the Bab1 revolts, and

> to a large degree led the Babis to become religiously and politically militant. The
> symbolic function of leadership was particularly evident when the Bib was arrested. His
> death in 1850 at the hands of government troops significantly increased the militant spirit
> of the Bibis, as they fervently believed in the Bib as a prophetic figure.

•          In light of these diverse scholarly viewpoints on the Babi movement, and from a

certain theoretical perspective, this thesis will concern itself primarily with two central

elements of the Bibi movement, i.e., "religious dissent" and "political revolt." In a literal

sense, "to dissent" means "to differ from an established church in the matter of doctrines,

rites or government.,          What is meant by religious dissent in this study is the Babi

opposition to the mainstream interpretation of certain aspects of Shi 'i doctrine held by the

Shl'i theologians ('ulama). As will be seen, the Bab, having been inspired by Shaykhi

teachings, interpreted many eschatological teachings such as uresurrection" differently

from the way in which Shi'i 'ulama had understood them. The Bab's belief in the

perpetuation of the prophetic revelation also constituted a point on which he differed

from the 'ulama. The Bib held that God sends a new prophet and a new revelation in

I   every age in accordance with human progress towards maturity. Moreover, the Bib's

claim to being the gate to the Hidden Imam, and to being the Mahdi and the bearer of

divine revelation, formed the basis of Bibi dissent which would have political

implications, in the sense that the Bib challenged the legitimacy of the political regime.

The Bib seems to have believed that in the presence of the Imam no temporal ruler can

claim any authority, be it religious or political. The Bab's claim to mahdihood therefore

threatened the political order and the religious authorities. This brought the Babis into

severe conflicts with the government in armed revolts. The term 'revolt' is generally used

to signify   an   "uprising against legitimate authority," and "a movement or expression of

16Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Springfield9 Massachusetts: G & S .
•   Merriam Company, 1968), 656. The tenn "dissent' is normally used in conjunction with such
other tenns as heresy, and heterodoxy, and in contrast to orthodoxy.

•   vigorous dissent or refusal to accept."

The Babi revolt can be said     as   representing the

Babi opposition to the existing political order, i.e., the Qajar government.

This thesis is about the Babi movement with particular emphasis on its change in

orientation from a movement merely dissenting from the prevalent religious thought of

the time into one that launched revolts against the existing political order. This thesis

therefore will proceed with the assumption that in the course of its development the Bibi

movement underwent a significant shift in its format. As argued by writers such as Denis

MacEo in and Peter Smith, in the early phase of its growth ( 1844-l848) the Babi

movement may be viewed as          an   expression of Islamic piety which remained within the

realm of Shi'ism, although the Bah's claim to bei ng the gate and his early doctrines have

been viewed by the 'ulama as       a   deviation from mainstream orthodox Shi'ism. However,

•   with the Bah's higher claim to being the returned Hidden Imam and the bearer of a new

revelation in 1848, the Bibi movement became not only dissenting in light of religious

doctrines, but also a challenge to the political authorities. In light of this, the Babi

revolts in different places were thus the products of Bib1 religious dissent. This thesis

seeks to demonstrate that the doctrines espoused by the Bab, considered as religiously

dissenting, entailed from the very beginning political implications, and that the Babi

revolts against the political regime were largely inspired by religious motives.

The other terms which have almost the same meaning as revolt, and have been used by
> scholars to describe the Bab1 conflict with the state, are '1Iprising," "insurrection," ..rebellion." In
> this study, these terms are often used interchangeably. See      Webster's Third New International
Dictionary, 1892 and 1944.

> and the growth of messianic tendencies also will be recounted .

I          Chapter two discusses the rise of the Babi movement and religious dissent. It

includes a discussion of the Bib's life and his role in the making of Bab1 doctrine, and the

dissemination of the Bah's claims and teachings. It goes on to explore some particular

doctrines formulated b y the Bib, especially those most contrary to the beliefs held by

orthodox Shi� theologians, and their relation to the theories of Shaykh A4mad Al}sa'1.

Further, this chapter will discuss the political implications of Bab1 religious dissent and

the reaction of the Shaykhls to the Bab' s teachings.

Chapter three focuses on the process of radicalization of the Babi movement. This

process led to conflict between the Babis and the state authorities, often in the form of

armed revolts. This chapter seeks to offer an analysis of the religious motives behind the

Bib1 revolts.

A. PoHtics and Religion in Shi'ism: An Overview

Islam recognizes no separation between religion and politics, and is believed by

Muslims to consist of teachings on all aspects of human life. Muslims believe that the

> Prophet Mll4ammad was sent to bring not only        a   body of moral and ethical precepts� as
> embodied in the    Qur'an,   but also to establish a community of believers. All believers

have to abide by the law of God, derived from His Book, in their individual and

•   communal affairs. As such� it can be said that Islam is both religion and polity, and that

the Prophet was simultaneously a religious and political Ieader.

According to Slii'i Islam, the leadership of the community after the death of the

Prophet passed to the Imams who continued the cycle of charismatic authority ( walaya or

> imama). This was so because the cycle of prophecy (nubuwwa) had come to an end with
> the death of the Prophet. Accordingly, Shi'is believe that     Imams are designated to guide

Much has  been written on this subject. See, for examp le, W. Montgomery Watt,
> Muhammad at Mecca (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1953); and Muhammad at Medina
> (O xford: Oxford University Press, 1956); and Muhammad: Prophet and States111iln (Oxford:
> Oxford University Press, 1961). In these works, Watt tried to demonstrate that Mul)ammad's
> religious mission carried social and political implications. Hodgson also interestingly descn"bes
> how Muf!ammad founded a religious community (umma) and a new polity at Medina. See
Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of islam (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1977), voLL, 167-
180. John L. Esp osito, in his article entitled ulslam and Muslim Politics, maintains that

"

'&political and religious leadership was vested in Muhammad, God's messenger on earth, who
•   served as both Prophet and political leader of the Islamic community/state." Voices of Resurgent
Islam (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), 4.

•   the community of believers, as illustrated by the original meaning of the word "imam."

According to Sbi'i belief, the Imams    are

the bearers of walaya. In brief, it can be said
> that the functions of the Imams consist of the following: "to rule over the Islamic
community; to explain the religious sciences and the law; and to be a spiritual guide to

> lead men to an understanding of the inner meaning of things.'          In addition, thanks to his
personal qualities bestowed upon him by God. the Imam is the leader and spiritual

> instructor of Islam, and the successor to the Prophet. These facts clearly demonstrate that
> the hnam, in Shi 'ism, assumes both religious and political leadership in the same way
that the Prophet does in "Medinan" Islam.

Consequently, given the Imam's unique personal qualities as well as his role, he
cannot possibly be elected by the mass of believers. As the spiritual guide, the Imam

•   receives his authority only from the Divine, and his appointment is not done through

election but through designation   (na��) by the Prophet and the preceding Imams on the

Moreover, it is believed that in order for the religious

On this point, Marshall Hodgson states:

Hodgson, however, asserts that the claim to the office of imamate was not initially
> a matter of knowledge ( 'ilm), but rather one of authority, which the Imam inherited from
> the Prophet or from the previous imams, i.e., "authority to decide cases. "9 As an

•   exclusively authorized source of knowledge, the Imams carry out important functions,

such as guiding the community to righteousness and establishing a just social order.

In line with Hodgson's opinion, Sachedina maintains that most of the early

•   Sachedina claims that "Islam as a religious phenomenon was subsequent to Islam as a

political reality." 11 He also argues that the rise of several individuals as leaders, Imams,

and zealous followers clearly shows that there was an endeavor to actualize the formation

of a just society, including its political organization.1

Therefore, it is not wrong to assert that, seen from the historical perspective,

Shi'ism was from the very outset an opposition party� to a certain extent. This view was

> expressed by lgnaz Goldziher who said that from the beginning Shi'ism had been                a
> protest against the fierce repression of divine right, i.e., "the usurpation of the right of the

'Alids, who alone had a legitimate claim to rule." 1 3 Indeed, it can also be argued that

Shi'ism has been frequently employed as a vehicle or instrument with which many

disappointed Muslim groups rebelled against existing regimes. This fact led some

•   scholars, such as Mangel Bayat, to assert that the emergence of Shi'ism had been mostly

a "result of a social discontent or political dissent, rather than a cause for it."1 It must

also be noted that the increasing social discontent and political unrest fueled a messianic

tendency among certain Muslim groups.

Therefore, one can argue that the aspiration for a world free from oppression, and
the search for a just social order, had contributed significantly to the transformation of

political opposition into a sectarian religious movement. This transformation also brought

doctrinal implications with regards to the nature and function of the rightful leader, i.e.,

From a historical perspective, Shi 'i opposition came to a head with the violent

conflict between the third Imam and the Umayyads. However, from then on the Imams

abandoned all activities that could be considered political. Instead. they retained only a

spiritual and intellectual opposition to the temporal rulers. 17 The quietist tendency of

Twelver Shi4Lism in the ninth century led to a state of affairs intensifying the separation of

the religious sphere from the political. This tendency also eventually encouraged a

significant break between the imamate and actual political rule. 18 This break was

facilitated by the widespread acknowledgment of the Imam's possession of divine

•   knowledge ('ilm). By that time, the Imam was believed to be the abode of God's

knowledge and the interpreter of His revelation. Consequently, the implication of this

tenet was that the duties of the Imam were totally separate from those of the rulers,

making the former the "final authority in matters of salvation, conscience and sacred

Nevertheless, the Sh1 �s were faced with numerous challenges and with much

resistance and hostility when they tried to define and defend their identity through their

concept of salvation. 20 As is well known, the Shi 'is not only strove for the recognition of

the legitimate Imam as a leader with a messianic role, but more importantly, they

questioned and often threatened the right of the extant regime to rule. This issue seems to

have become a pivotal point for all those who regarded themselves as being set apart from

2l
or abused by the ruling political elite.            Early Shl'is, by opposing the caliphate,

consolidated their support for 'Ali as the Imam (leader) after the Prophet, and their

aspiration for a just order under the authority of 'Ali and his progeny.

From another perspective, but still in relation to what has been described above,

one can note that Shi'ism came into being as a movement centered on the question of

•   authority over the community of believers. When the Imam was still alive, the influence

of the Sh1'i 'ulama had been notably confined by the appearance on earth of a p aramount

center of authority, i.e., the Imam. However, the void in leadership due to the Imam's

absence gave the 'ulama wider room to expand, theoretically and practically, the basis for

their own authority over the Shl'i community.              As a result, with the absence of the

»rile word 'salvation' (najat) can mean the "redemption from ultimate damnation
> through divine agency," or the "saving of a person's soul from eternal punishment and its
> admission into heavenly beatitude." See Webster's Third New International Dictionary,
> According to Shi'i belief, it is impossible for a person to gain salvation if he does not believe in
> the role of the Imam as the only agent to guide the believers to the right path and establish a just
> social order. The idea of salvation also has a messianic implication. See Sachedina, Islamic
> Messianism, 2-3. For further discussion, see Mahmoud Ayoub, Redemptive Suffering in Islam: A
Study of the Devotional Aspects of 'Ashurtiin Twelver Shi'ism (New York: Mounton Publishers,

B. The u,iifi-Akhbirl Dispute

The conflict between the U�ufi and Akhbiri tendencies can be traced back to the

very beginning of lminii Shi 'ism, although it became more intense in the course of

> time.        During the first juridical period (from the fourth to fifth century of the Hijra) the

•   These scholars are said to have been influenced by both al-S hifi � and Mu 'tazifi

doctrines.26 Al-Shifi 'i     is regarded as the first Muslim jurist to elaborate on the principles

of Islamic jurisprudence        (U-Fu1 al-fiqh) in   his work entitled   al-Risa1a.   The Mu 'tazila is

known as a school that had adopted a rationalist approach to Islamic thought, which had

Regardless of the tendencies of these early Shi'i 'ulama, the terms "Akhban" and
"U�iill" did not appear in the early works of the Imimi 'ulama. Rather. Shaykh Tiis1 had

an Ithna 'Ashari author who described the Akhbans as strict traditionalists. 29

From the Akhban point of view, the elevation of the mujtahid' s role to that of
someone having the authority to interpret the command of the Imam is a concept that

Mahmood Shehabi argues that the relation of the 'ulama to the Hidden Imam is

similar to that of the Imams to God. According to him, the 'ulama             are,   in a limited sense,

intermediaries between the community and the Imams, with some of the authority of the

> latter reflected upon them. They also serve as the proofs         (�ujaj, sing. f}ujja ) of the Imams.

Likewise, the Imams         are   intermediaries between the community and the source of divine

guidance.44 However, as Algar argues, "it would be wrong to conclude that the 'ulama

possessed any authority similar to that of the Imams, or that they could legitimately lay

Contrary to the U�iilis, the Akhbiiis held that only the Imam is infallible,

•   However, as Cole says, in practice the Akhbans also made use of interpretation in

explaining Sh1 'i doctrines.

Historically, the rise and decline of certain schools of thought largely coincided

with the social and political circumstances of the time. The victory of the U�Ufi position

> in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for example, cannot be separated from the fact
> that the contemporary rulers supported the U�Ufi 'ulama (mujtahids). and made them the

state officials. The need of the Shi'i community for guidance also caused the role of the

'ulama to flourish.

The decline of the Akhbans, by contrast, was caused by various factors. The most

important factor, in Kohlberg's analysis, was "their refusal to consider any role for

intermediaries between the believers and the Hidden Imam. "49 Moreover, the Akhbans

•   seem to have ignored the practical and emotional needs of the Shi 'i populace for the

'ulama to help them comprehend and apply Slii 'i teachings. In short, the growing power

of the mujtahids and their social significance certainly contributed to the decrease of

Akhbiri influence.

C. ReUgious Controversy: Sbaykhism

On the religious and intellectual planes of the early nineteenth century, there

emerged a theological school called the       Shaykh[ya,50 which was founded by Shaykh

also called ..Posht-i S aris" which literally means "behind the head". When visiting the shrine of

successor, Sayyid K�m Rashfi (d. l259/1844). 53

However, Shaykh A4road did not intend to establish a new sect different from the
teachings of the    Imams.    Moreover, the term "Shaykhi" itself came not from Shaykh

> ·a-rif (gnostic) amongst the 'ulama and an 'a1im (cleric) amongst the gnostics .62 As a
> result, one may argue that this combination of perspectives was the main factor that led to

his distinctive contribution to modern Sbi 'ism. In addition, early Shaykhism may also be

seen as an attempt to purify what Shaykh AQmad regarded as innovations, and to revive

the true teachings of the Imams. Shaykh AQmad also endeavored to reconcile revelation

with reason, and theology with philosophy.           In other words, one can argue that Shaykh

> endeavored to implement his theological approach to various issues that were subject to

controversy in the Sh1 'i milieu, such as prophecy, imamate and resurrection.64

One of the central teachings of Shaykh AQmad was the belief that it was essential

•   to purify Shi 'ism of intellectual innovation. Such purification could only be achieved by a

return to infallible sources of guidance, namely the Qur' in, the f:ladith (the Traditions)

and the Imams.          Shaykh AQ.mad also believed that human beings cannot reach and

comprehend God' s essence, because God is beyond human comprehension, and because

God is not comparable to human beings. According to Shaykh AQmad, as Momen asserts,

the knowledge of God possessed by humans is only a figment of the latter' s imagination,

Shaykh Aqmad� s

view of God essentially negated the           �uti   concept of wal}dat al-wujtid (the oneness of

being) and the mystical union with God. In order to arrive at knowledge of the divine

attributes, it was necessary for human beings to have intermediaries to guide them. These

intermediaries were the prophets and the Imams, who constitute "the causal and creative

agents of the Primal will    ."

Nevertheless, the most controversial element in Shaykh Aqmad's teachings was

his doctrine of eschatology, particularly the issue of resurrection. Indeed, it was this issue

that formed the ground for the initial proclamation of excommunication (takjir) against

> him. In sharp contrast to orthodox S ru 'i views, Shaykh Aqmad maintained that on the
> Day of Judgment, creation would return, not to God as its source but to the Primal Will.

I   He further asserted that the resurrection will take place, not in the material body but in a

"subtle body" which comes into being in the inter-world, a realm which is between the

material and heavenly realms, and is normally referred to as hu-rqalya� 8

of human beings . 79

In contrast to this belief, Shaykh A.4mad maintained that the bodies of the Prophet

aorrbis is implied from the belief in the purity of the Prophet's and the Imam' s body.

density than pure spirit." Rafati, "The Development of Sbaykhi Thought in Sbi'i Islam," l 07.

•   Needless to say, these ideas were diametrically opposed to the mainstream of Imanu Shl�

doctrine.

From this point, one can note that the      hurqalya� or the 'a1am al-mitha1 (the world
of images), occupied an important place in Shaykhi teachings, particularly in Shaykh

Aqmad's thought.         For the Shaykhls, it is this   hu rqalya that constitutes the abode of the

-       -

Hidden Imam, as well as the place of the resurrection of the body. 82 In Shaykhi belief, as

> Lawson asserts, "the hidden Imam, residing in the             'a?am al-mitha1, is accessible through
> the spiritual imagination of those members of the Shi �a who           are   capable of purifying their

consciences to a degree which allowed the Hidden Imam, or Qa' im, to appear to them

(i.e. the Perfect Sh1'a)."

Therefore, according to Shaykhi teachings, the                mujtahid cannot serve      as    an

•   adequate intermediary between the community and the Hidden Imam. A more

authoritative incarnation of divine guidance is necessary for such              a   task, one which,   as

> has been stated, can be found in the "Perfect Shi'a"           (Shf'a Kamil), described by the later
> Shaykhls as the fourth pillar     (al-rukn al-raoi '). The authority of the Perfect S h1 'a, who       are

> said to have direct contact with the Hidden hnam, would of course put to an end the
function and role of the     mujtahids.84

Besides these views, Shaykh Aqmad also taught that the Prophet's night journey

to heaven   (mi'ra]) was made only within the created realm and with the Prophet' s subtle

•   rather than material body.85 The theologians, on the other hand, basing their ideas on a

> literal interpretation of the         Qur'an,     have asserted their belief in the physical   mi 'ra].
Shaykh Alpnad rejected this view, and understood              mi•ra] to   "mean a spiritual experience

" 6
symbolizing an ascent to the highest level of cognizance of the divine. 8

In matters of jurisprudence, Shaykh Alpnad appears to have adopted an

intermediary position between the U�iilis and the Akhbans. He did not deny the validity

of   ijtihtid,   but recommended that it remain within the area determined by the Traditions

of the Imams.87 Moreover, he states that his method of arriving at conclusions in religious

> law was essentially that of the U�iifis who base their thinking on the                  Qur'an, ijma-·
> (consensus), and logical reasoning, except that Shaykh Alpnad emphasized the use of

evidence from intuition (�ikma).88 Momen, however, contends that although Shaykh

•   A4mad' s method of jurisprudence was U�UTI in nature, "his pious veneration of the

Imams and his use of argument based on the Traditions of the Imams rather than on

rational discourse is very reminiscent of Akh6ar1 thought. "89

However, what spurred the severe opposition of many 'ulama to Shaykh Alpnad's

doctrine was undoubtedly their fear of Shaykh A4mad's preference for intuitive

Imams. This claim led to the description of Shaykh Alpnad           as   a Perfect Sh1 'i, and hence

After the death of Shaykh Alpnad in 1 826, the Shaykhi school was led by his most

important pupil S ayyid K�m Rashfi (d. l 843/4).            In   some instances, Rashti further

developed the Shaykhl teachings and elaborated certain ideas which had been espoused

> by Shaykh Alpnad, such as that of the Perfect Shi'i and that of a new revelation.                    In
> Rashti' s time, the interpretation of the role of the Perfect Shi 'i seems to have gone in a

messianic direction, which eventually gave rise to the Bibi movement.

•           In spite of the fact that the messianic aspects of Shaykhism developed in his time,

Rashfi made an attempt to situate Shaykhism, as a theological school, within mainstream

S hi 'ism, even though there were still many bones of contention between Shaykhism and

the orthodox Sh1 'i theologians and jurists of the time. Rashfi also argued that he never

sought to establish a new madhhab different from Sh1� Islam.92 Amanat asserts that

Rashfi even tried to conform numerous Shaykhl teachings to U�iifi doctrine, particularly

in external matters .93 This attempt to move Shaykhism closer to orthodoxy was made in

order to avoid the criticism and persecution which had been inflicted upon Shaykhls at

the end of Shaykh A4Jnad' s life and throughout Rashfi's leadership (from 1 826 to 1844).

> In order to avoid being accused of deviation, Rashfi also attempted to justify his ideas,

•   of his life, Rahsfi alluded to the possibility of the coming of post-Muhammadan

revelation from God shortly after his death. Accordingly, his disciples began to expect the

arrival of a more significant figure than either Shaykh Atpnad or Rashfi. 95 Therefore, we

find that claims to leadership, after Rashfi, proliferated within Shaykhi communities

everywhere.96

(later called the Babis) were virtually affirming the coming of the expected Imam.

However, not all the Shaykhis accepted Sayyid 'Ali MulJammad' s claim. In

number of followers, who would not admit the claim of the Bah. Henceforth, the Shaykhl

school was divided into two important groups: the Kirmani Shaykhls and the Babis.

'ulama and the state 0 as well as the emergence of messianic trends and tendencies which

were reflected in what Amanat signifies as "the revived Sufi orders and the widespread

popular prophecies."103 The latter tendency appears to have caused the conflicts between

the orthodox 'ulama and the �iifis of millenarian persuasion, and provided a basis for the

later messianic claim of the B ab in 1 844.

In the period from 1 797 to 1 834 the     Qajar dynasty   was ruled by Fat�} 'Ali Shih

(d. l834) who favored the 'ulama and developed a religious policy which endorsed the

doctrines of the orthodox 'ulama against all heretical tendencies, and also against various

�iifi movements of the time, as will be seen later. In short, there was     a   kind of alliance

between the 'ulama and the state during his reign, against any doctrine or movement

which threatened the religious and political authorities. 104 During the reign of Fat!} 'Ali

•   Shih, the position of the U�iifi 'ulama was strong. Under the influence of Agha

Mul}ammad Baqir Bihbaharu ( 1 1 1 8- 1 205/ 1 706- 1 790) they dominated the religious circles

The reign of Mul}ammad Shah ( 1 834- 1 848) witnessed the growing dominance of
foreign powers, particularly Britain, in the economic and political affairs of Iran. This

defeated, and as a result fled along with many of his followers to India.

Nevertheless, one might argue that the relationship between the ' ulama and the

Qajar regime was complex. There were various precedents for collaboration between the

state and the 'ulama, as demonstrated by a tradition of quietism amongst the 'ulama and

their avoidance of involvement in political activities. They mostly concentrated on

intellectual, theological and religious activities, and respected the authority of the state,

which, in turn, appointed them as officials. Hence, most 'ulama were dependent on the

state for their salaries, grants of land, and endowments for shrines and schools. This fact

resulted in the subordination of the 'ulama to state authority.

The tension between the state and the 'ulama became stronger in the reign of

•   N�ir al-Oin Shah ( 1 848- 1 896) under the ministry of Mirza Taqi Khan, Amir Kabir

(d. l 852) when the government introduced a political reform intended to strengthen the

authority of the state. 1        This reform sought to limit the influence and jurisdiction of the

'ulama by establishing uew courts. Similarly, the government produced regulations that

limited the role of religious institutions such as mosques and shrines. It also became

involved in controlling endowments and competed with the 'ulama in the realm of

education by establishing secular schools. 1 The most important feature, for the purpose

I   of this study, of N�ir al-D1n Shah' s reign was the severe opposition of both the state and

the 'ulama against the Bab1 movement, a topic which will be dealt with in Chapter Three.

In short, it can be said that under the Qajars, the religious elite, to some degree,

the government, which might have compromised them, they still demonstrated a degree

movements that led to outbreaks of violence in the cities, between the masses and the

government.

•   Messianic Trends

Although the ruler and the 'ulama attempted to eradicate the �iifi orders, which

have millenarian tendencies, particularly during the reign of Fad} 'Ali Shih, the growing

popularity and wide acceptance of �iifi masters and their teachings among the population

> cannot     be ignored. The development of �iifi orders in fact entailed what Amanat calls

to the appearance (�uhur) of the Hidden Imam. The revival of the �uti orders containing

millenarian tendencies was represented by the activities and teachings of Ni 'matullilii

�Ufis.

Ma '�Urn. 'Ali Shah and his two prominent disciples, Nlir 'Ali Shih and Mushtaq 'Ali

S hih provided the order with a variety of mystical teachings and a manual of �iifi

practices. They attempted to revive the legacy of the Ni 'matullihl teachings as well as to

lay sufficient emphasis on the importance of the            sharf'a.   More importantly. the

Ni 'matullihi teachings contained messianic elements and convictions. The writings of the

Ni 'matullihi teachers also included some claims which in essence became the basis for

the rise of messianic tendencies. 1 15 In addition, what made this �iifi order popular and

attractive was the fact that the common people saw in them saintly characteristics coupled

with their "claims to a divinely endowed gift to prognosticate and influence the course of

I   events . 1 16 However, the 'ulama accused them of being infidels, since they felt threatened

by the growing influence of the �litis and individual dervishes. 1 17 The ·wama' s hostility

toward the �iifis also appeared in various works which contained anti-�iifi polemics. 1 1 8

•           It is apparent that the question of authority characterized the nature of the �iifi-

'ulama encounter, and particularly the 'ulama' s appeals to the rulers to exterminate their

then Fad] 'Afi S hah to support their cause against Mir Ma 'sum 'All Shah and his

followers.

Beside the Ni'matullaru revival, other orders which underwent renewal were the

Dhahabiya and Nurbakhshiya. As Amanat notes, the Dhahab1ya revival was partly

facilitated by the efforts of Qu!b al-Oin Muqammad Dhahabi Nayr1zi (d. l l73/ 1 760) . This

I   order was then developed by his leading followers and brought to different cities, such as

Shiraz where it attracted a following.            This is also the case with the Nurbakhshiya

•   whose leader in this period,             'Abd al-Wahhab al-Ni'in          (d. l 2 12/1797) , made efforts to

renew some messianic prophecies embodied in the Nurbakhsh1 teachings, which were

initially established and formulated by the            founder,    Sayy id Mul}.ammad Nurbakhsh. 121

The accession to power o f           Muqammad Shah in 1 834               and the appointment of

Mirza Aqas1          (prime minister between 1 835 and 1848) prov ided a new atmosphere for

Sufism, however.            The   ruler even patronized the � litis, particularly the             Ni 'matullahis.

Muqammad Shih's �iifi tendencies allowed many �ii fis                    to hold prominent        offices   during

his   rei   gn Moreover,

.                   during Mul}ammad        Shih's     reign   ,    other   �iifi orders   such as

> Dhahab1ya          and Nurbakhs hiya       developed and flourished              significantly. 122 By the early
> nineteenth century, the city of S hiraz, where the                Bib   was born, had become one of the

importan t        centers of �iifi   activities, such    as those of the Ni 'matullam, Dhahab1 and

I   Nurbakhshl           orders.    These    orders    attracted     many     follo\\ters     from a variety        of

backgrounds.              It is probable that   their le aning   to �ufism was partly       due   to the hope to

experience spiritu al visions, in addition to the fact that the �iifi teachings of these orders

basically contained Sh1 'i doctrine, such as belief in the              advent of the Hidden Imam.

The proto-messianic         claims and elements during this period can also be observed
in the revival of some aspects of lsma'iii messianic teachings with regard to the advent of

THE RISE OF BABISM AND RELIGIOUS DISSENT

The rise and development of Babism cannot be separated from the life of Sayyid 'Ali

Mul)ammad. Babi teachings and doctrines can be said to be identical to the thought of the

B ab. Up to his death in 1 850, the B ib had become the central figure of the movement,

provided its ideological basis, directed the movement, and inspired his followers even

during his time under arrest. Therefore, it is important frrst of all, to throw some light on

the life of Sayyid 'All MLI4ammad, and in particular the major role he played in the

establishment of the Babi movement and in the forming of its doctrine .

A.   The Bib and the Rise of the Bibl Movement

Sayyid 'Ali Mu4ammad was born in the city of Shiraz on Mul)arram 1 , 1235 or

> October 20, 1 8 1 9 into a distinguished family of that town. The title   sayyid which he used
> indicates that his origin can be traced back to the Prophet Mu�ammad. His father, Sayyid

> Mu4 ammad RicJi, was highly honored and respected by society for his piety and virtue.

He died when Sayyid 'Ali Mu4ammad was still a child. His maternal uncle, �ajji Mirza

Sayyid 'Afi, then took responsibility for Sayyid 'Ali Mul)ammad' s upbringing and

education. In this phase, Sayyid 'Ali MD4ammad was sent to a tutor by the name of

Shaykh   'Abid. The latter was known as a man of piety and learning, and he is said to have

•   been a disciple of Shaykh Alpnad        AQsa'i   and S ayyid   �          Rashfi, the leaders of the

Shaykhi movement. 1

Since his childhood, Sayyid 'Ali Mll4ammad had exhibited extraordinary abilities

and qualities. Shaykh ' Abid, the teacher, was surprised at S ayyid 'Ali Mul}ammad's

intelligence and wisdom, a fact that led Shaykh ' Abid to return the child to his uncle

because "he had nothing to teach this gifted pupil.n Sayyid Ali Mul}ammad was only

'

five years old when he was sent to receive education from Shaykh ' Abid.

On one occasion some of Shaykh ' Abid' s students raised a question that remained

unanswered after a long discussion. Shaykh ' Abid told them that he would consult some

authoritative works, and would give the solution at their next meeting. S ayyid 'Ali

Mu4ammad, who had been listening, gave reasonable answers which surprised both the

•   teacher and the students.

These occurrences demonstrated that S ayyid 'Afi Mul}.ammad

was not an ordinary child, rather, one of a high intelligence. These qualities and his

charismatic personality later become one of the important factors which led many Shi'is,

particularly Shaykhls, to give allegiance to his claims and support his cause.

Sayyid 'Ali Mu4ammad studied at a local maktab (school) for six or seven years.

Then he   began   to get involved in the family business. When he was fifteen, he went to

•   Bushihr with his guardian.4 In the year 1255/ 1 839-40, however, Sayyid 'Ali Muqammad

> followers, nevertheless, still regarded Shaykh AlJmad Al}sa1 and Sayyid K�m Rashfi as
I   the precursors of their movement, or even as "the two preceding Babs."6

In 1 256/1 840-4 1 , Sayyid 'Afi Muqammad's family insisted on his return to

> Rajah 1 258 or August 1 842. 7 It is after this event that Sayyid 'Ali Muqammad began the
> composition of some of his early works, and launched his early claims.

The Bib's       works and claims

The works of Sayyid 'Ali Mu� ammad are extensive in number and unusual in

> nature, particularly his works of       tafsfr. The frrst major work written by Sayyid 'Afi
> Mul}ammad in the early stage of his mission was          ta[sfr surat al-Baqara. 8 However, the
> most important of his writings in this period        was   his commentary on Su-rat   Ytisuf,   or

Qayyum al-Asma-,, known also as A�san al-Qa�a�, or simply the tafsfr par excellence, in

> which he claimed for himself the title of the      bao (gate) and dhikr (remembrance). From
> that time ( 1 844) onward, Sayyid 'Afi Mul}ammad was known as the Bib, among other

titles.

The   Qayyum al-Asma-, was widely distributed among his followers during his
•   early mission. The Bibis even regarded the        Qayyiim al-Asma ' as their Qur'an before the

> Bib wrote the Persian     Bayan, which later became the holy book of the Babis. The Bayan
> was composed during the Bib's imprisonment at Makii in 1 847-8 . Compared to the

Qayyiim al-Asma ', however, the Bayan seems to have not been so widely circulated. 10

•   The Bib also composed the Arabic Baytiil , 1 1 which is much shorter than its Persian

version, and which may be considered a "condensation of the Persian Bayan."12

In addition, the Bah' s works include a number of letters to the Shah and his chief
ministers. To the 'ulama residing in the cities of Iran and particularly in the shrine cities

of Iraq, the   Bib too wrote several    letters. He also composed treatises on Islamic law , and

made commentaries on various Qur' an i c verses in addition to the previous ly mentio ne d

tafsfrs. 13 Moreover, the   Bab   formulated a manual or guideline for spiritual exercises, and

wrote the Kitab al-Asma ' (B ooks of Names) along with a number of talismans. 14

As far    as   the Sayyid 'Ali Mu�ammad' s works on tafs[r are concerned, it is

interesting to note that he wrote and completed his works after having a dream or vision.

It is most likely that these dreams convinced him that he occupied a high spiritual station.

•   During his early mission, the        Bib    benefited from "spiritual" experiences. One such

•          The Bib claimed that initially sovereignty belongs to him. However, the Bib

would accept the sovereignty of temporal rulers as long as they work to implement the

command of God and the policies of the Bib. The Bab would also recognize their

legitimacy to the extent that they serve as the defenders of religion, and strive for the

purification of "the Sacred Land" from the infidels.            The Bib would neither struggle for

power nor regard the temporal rulers as illegitimate usurpers of power, insofar as they

fulfill the above conditions.            It can be said therefore that in this respect the B ab

differentiated, although not strictly, between the spiritual and political (temporal) powers.

It is also interesting to observe the relationship of Sayyid       'Ali   Mul].ammad' s claim

and his concept of "bao" to Shi 'ism in general. From the early period of S hi 'ism, the term

Bah had been used to refer to the senior disciples of the Imam.22 The Shi 'ites also

•   believed that the Prophet had used the term         bab in reference to 'Afi, quoting a statement

from the Prophet, "I am the city of knowledge and          ·Ali   is the gate thereof."2 However, it

is still not clear when Sayyid Ali Muqammad used the term

'                                  bao whether he meant that
he was the gate to the Hidden Imam or the Hidden Imam himself. But, as Lawson asserts,

•   the Bah eventually appears to have claimed to be not merely the gate but the Hidden

Imam himself in person.

As far as Sayyid 'Ali Muqaounad's claim to being the Bab is concerned, Shoghi

Effendi asserts that it was put forward on May 22, 1 844, and marked "the opening scene

of the initial act of this great drama"           in the religious history of humankind. The

participants in that event were the Bab, then twenty-five years old, and the young Mulla

l:{usayn Bushrii � , the first to believe in the Bah. Their meeting seemed to be purely

accidental,26 as Shoghi Effendi notes, although tvfulla f:lusayn had sought for a possible

successor to Sayyid K�im Rashfi, as alluded to by the latter.

The most important factor which led to Mulla I:Iusayn' s conversion and allegiance

to the Bab' s claim was the proof that Sayyid �Ali Muqammad used to endorse his claim.

•   Amanat says that the proof is basically centered on two elements. First is the prophecy of

Rashfi. Sayyid 'Ali Mu�amm ad did not claim himself to be merely Rashti' s successor or

the Perfect Sh1'i but claimed a position close to that of prophethood. The Bab also alleged

that the title of bab (gate), dhikr (remembrance), and nuqfa (point) which he used were

authorized for him not simply by the Twelfth Imam but by a divine authority, that is God.

The second proof was the Bah's writings, especially his skill and efficiency (speed) in

producing a tremendous amount of verses.               It is obvious that what forms the important

nAmanat,   Resu"ection and Renewal, 17 1 .

I   proof of his mission was the immense amount of �verses ' (ayat) which he revealed,

together with the speed with which he recorded them. This was the most direct proof,

which he presented invariably as miracle, sign and a revelation from God.28

Shoghi Effendi notes that the dominant features that signaled the rise of the Bab1

movement, which constitutes '1he inception of the most glorious era in the spiritual life of

mank.ind"        include:

> the claim to be no less than the mouthpiece of God himself, promised by the
> prophets of bygone ages; the assertion that he was, at the same time, the
> herald of One immeasurably greater than himself; the summons which he
> trumpeted forth to the kings and princes of the earth; the dire warning

The Dissemination of the Bib's claim

In the summer of 1 844, the B ib left Sh1raz after having instructed his followers

known as the Letters of the Living to scatter throughout Iran to disseminate the Bib ' s

claim. This new doctrine rapidly gained success and attracted many followers even

outside and beyond the Shaykhi community. Instructed by the Bib, the Letters of the

28Srnith notes that "the Qur'an itself, revealed over a 22-year period, consisted only a
> little more than 6,000 verses. By contrast, according to the Bib' s own account in the Persian
> Bayan ( 1 847), he had by then revealed some 500,000 verses, 100,000 of which had been
> circulated." Peter Smith even states that Sayyid 'Ali Mll4amm ad lived in "an atmosphere
> of revelation." Smith, The Babi and Baha ti Religions, 32. S ee also Amanat, Resu"ection and

proved necessary to change his plans (bada...,)31 and return directly to Iran. The Bab also

instructed them to go forth to Isfahan and remain there until the Bab gave further

commands. His reason for changing the plan is not clear. However, the Bib's change of

direction appears to have brought about a serious sp lit in the ranks of his followers in

Karbala. It also led a number of his followers to abandon him. 38

In March 1 847 the Bab left Isfahan (the former �afavid capital) shortly after the
death of his patron, Mu�tamad al-Dawla, Manuchir         Khan.   The Bah then was brought

under escort towards Tehran. The route took him through        Kashan,   past Qum, and on to

the village of Kulayn, about twenty miles from the capital. The Bib remained in this

village for about twenty days, until }Jajji Mirza Aqasi , then chief minister, instructed his

•   escort to remove the Bab to confinement in the town of Mikii near the Ottoman border.

The Bab and his guards left for Azerbayjan, passing near Qazvin en route to

Tabriz, where he was kept for forty days until his final removal to Mikii . He arrived at

> �akii late in the summer of 1 847 and remained there nine months. The Bah left Mam on
> April 9, 1 848, and arrived at his new prison at Chihriq in the first days of May, 1 848.

Three months later, at the end of August, he was transferred to Tabriz to be examined,

then brought back to Chihriq. It is at this point that he proclaimed himself to be the return

of the Hidden Imam in person, and even implied that he was the prophet, thus announcing

I   the abrogation o f Islamic law (shan'a). This assertion was publicized before the     'ulama

of Tabriz at the government tribunal of 1 847-8:�2 The period during which the Bab was

imprisoned shortly before his death at the hands of the government' s troops can be

regarded as his most productive period, in which he developed the elaborate expression of

Babi doctrine. Finally, the Bab was removed to Tabriz and executed there in July 1 850.43

B. Some Bib1 Doctrines and their Relation to Shaykhism

Most of the Babi doctrines are expressed in the Persian Bayan, which was

composed by the Bab during his imprisonment in Makii in 1 847-48. According to

Browne, there are at least three peculiarities in the Bayan, which were quite striking and

impressive. The first concerns the    arrangement   of the chapters into groups of nineteen.

I   The second concerns the emphasis which is given to the doctrine that the revelation he

brought is not final. His mission would be continued and perfected by UHim whom God

shall manifest" who would confli111 what he revealed in the Bayan. The third is the

certainty with which the Bib believed that his religious doctrines would obtain an

ultimate predominance and attract the majority of people.44

The Persian Bayan describes various aspects of Babi doctrine. Bausani notes that

its content however can be sorted and seen to contain four principal points. The first is the

abrogation of Qur'anic      laws (sharf'a) of prayer, fasting, marriage, divorce, and

inheritance; and that the Prophet Mul}amm ad was the last prophet within his prophetic

> 41MacEoin, The Sources for Early Ba"'bfDoctrine and Historyt 82.

4�acEoin, The Sources for Early Bao[Doctrine and Historyt 82

""Browne, 'The Babis of Persia II: Their Literature and Doctrines," 9 19.

•   cycle, which closed in 1 260/ 1 844 when the Bib proclaimed his mission. The second is

concerned with the symbolic or spiritual interpretation of the eschatological terms in the

Qur'an, such   as   Paradise, Hell, Death, Resurrection, Return, Judgment, and Bridge. The

third is the establishment of new institutions, such        as   a new qibla (towards the house of

the Bib, replacing the Ka'ba), and a new, but rather elaborate, regulation of inheritance.

The fourth is the Bib ' s prophecy regarding the "one whom God                will make   manifest"

(man ytq.hiruhu Allah), that is the future prophet. 45

Among these points, the doctrines that concern the future life (eschatology)

constitute perhaps the most difficult pans to understand of the Bayan, and generally of the

Bibi doctrine. This is so since the Bib interpreted all such doctrines as the questioning in

the Tomb, the resurrection, and the bridge (�ira{) in an allegorical manner.

•           To begin with, the issue of resurrection (qiyama) forms one of the most important

aspects in the Bib's thought. In the Bab ' s view, resurrection means the "appearance of

> the Primal Will in its latest manifestation; j ust   as   all things were originally created in one
> person, so all will be resurrected in one person, whereupon they will be individually

resurrected in their various places."47 The Bib therefore appears to assert that physical

resurre ction of bodies from their graves would not happen, a view which was similarly

held by Shaykh Ahmad. The Bib maintained that the Day of resurrection continues from

4sA. Bausani, B ib ," EP 1 , 834. Discussing Bib1 doctrine, Smith is of the opinion that

> Bibism as a religious movement umay be characterized by four inter-related religious motifs:
> legalism, esotericism, •polarity' and millenarianism." See Smith, The Babi and Baha 'i Religions,
3 1-44.

46See Browne, Selections, 330 .
'47MacEoin, "Bib," 283.

•   the period of the appearance of the tree of Truth (i.e., the prophet) in each age until his

disappearance. ''What is meant by the Day of Resurrection is the day of the Manifestation

of the Tree of Truth," the   Bah said.48

This concept implies that the disappearance of one prophet and the coming of the

other constitute the Day of Resurrection. Thus, the resurrection of Moses took place from

the coming of Jesus until the latter' s ascension, and the resurrection of Islam (the Prophet

MuQ.ammad) began with the Bab' s proclamation of his mission on the evening of Jumada

al-Ula 5, 1260   or May 22, 1 844, and would end at his death, or in the advent of ' him

whom God shall make manifest. '49 In this resurrection the return      (raj'a)   of Mul},ammad,

the Imams, Fipma and the four        abwao    (gates, agents) has taken place in the persons of

the eighteen   �urul al-�ayy   (the Letters of the Living), the Bah ' s early disciples.5° The

•   Letters of the Living therefore were the return of the eighteen mentioned above

It is clear therefore that the Bah's thinking contradicted the traditional Shl 'i view

of the Day of Resurrection. In orthodox Shi'i belief, the day of resurrection is the day, on

which the dead wil l be resurrected to meet their final judgment; the good to be rewarded

with paradise, the bad to be punished with Hell.5 1 The Bab instead interpreted the

resurrection as the era of a new revelation, in which those who accept and believe in it

•   will experience a heavenly life, while those who disbelieve will suffer the agony of Hell;

both in a spiritual sense.

The Bib's rejection of the orthodox doctrine of resurrection, for some scholars,

seems to have been reminiscent of the Nizan Isrna 'iii doctrine on the same issue. The

turning point of Is rna 'IIi deviation        from mainstream Islam was marked by the

proclamation of the Resurrection (qiyama) by f:lasan 'ala-dhikrih[ al-salam on Ramagin

1 7, 559/August 8, 1 164.         This proclamation entailed the abrogation of the shan'a as a

symbol of the sovereignty of Islam. According to Is rna 'IIi teachings, the resurrection was

"the manifestation of the unveiled Truth in the          spiritual   reality of the imam, which

actualized Paradise for the faithful capable of grasping it while condemning the

opponents who continued to adhere to the shell of the law to the Hell of                  spiritual
I   nonbeing."

Two centuries before, the Qarmatis of al-BaQ!ayn had also proclaimed the

qiyama the advent of the Mahdi (Qa' im), and therefore the end of the Islamic era.

•             Related to the issue of resurrection was the Bab' s notion of barzakh, or the

> intermediary realm where, after death, the soul goes to await the last judgment. The Bab,
> however, maintained that the barzakh is nothing but the time period separating one
> manifestation from another; and the realm of the divine is not, as some imagine, the

> quote Browne' s translation, "banakh is meant the period between two manifestations.
> For none knoweth except God, what shall befall men after Death. Blessed in he who sees
nothing without discerning therein the Manifestation of His Lord. "56

In addition, the Bib seems to have developed a doctrinal system based on the
concept of unity of the divine. On this point, the Bib was to a large extent inspired by

Shaykh1 doctrines.           The Bib believed that there is only one eternal God who is pure
•   Essence. Since God's essence cannot be known, it manifested itself throughout the
history of mankind in the persons of various prophets. The creation of the universe and

human beings was for the sake of these prophets as the manifestation of the divine.                     In

other words, "through this Divine Will all things were created, and towards this Will all

•   return; and to contemplate the Manifestation is to contemplate the divine will, because

the former reflects the latter like the mirror that reflects the sun. "59

As a result, it can be said that according to the Bah's doctrine, all prophets

constitute manifestations of the Primal Will. In this respect, all prophets are apostles of

God, however, all their revelations cannot be regarded as the same. Regarding his

> "prophetic mission" the Bib asserts that "what God had revealed to him of verses and
> words is greater and higher than what God revealed aforetime. "60 The Bib claimed that

he was more excellent than Jesus, and therefore his Bayan, which includes all of his

6l
> works, was superior to the GospeL             The Bib, following Rashfi, seemed to have argued
> that the human race continues to progress and develop to maturity. Making an analogy to

a child who is taught more fully and instructed in more difficult subjects by his teacher as

•   his understanding develops, the Bib maintained that the Primal Will, i.e., the Instructor

(murabbi} of mankind, also communicates in each successive manifestation with a more

elaborate articulation.

•          Some scholars, like Bayat, also observe the similarity between the Isma �lis and

the Bib's idea of continuous divine manifestation, that "divine manifestation has no

end."63 This idea was contrary to orthodox Muslim belief. The Bab maintains that God is

eternal. God creates manifestations in order to be known and to reveal divine knowledge.

As a result, creation has no beginning and no end. Moreover, based on the belief that God

and God' s Will have no beginning and no end, the Bah asserted that God 's manifestation

through the prophets has no end either. The Bib reaffrrms this concept of cyclical pattern

of the appearance of the Prophet in the Persian Bayan in the following words:

> It is clear and evident that the object of all preceding dispensations has been
> to pave the way for the advent of Muhammad, the Apostle of God. These,
> including the Mul].ammad dispensation, have had, in their tum, as their
> objective the revelation proclaimed by the Qa' im. The purpose underlying
> this revelation, as well   as   those that preceded it, has in like manner, been to
> announce the advent of the Faith of Him Whom God will make manifest.
•          And this faith -the faith of Him whom God will make manifest, in its tum,

> together with all the revelation gone before it, have as their object the
> Manifestation destined to succeed it. And the latter, no less than all the
> revelations preceding it, prepare the way for the revelation which is yet to
follow. The process of the rise and setting of the S un of Truth will thus

indefinitely continue - a process that had no beginning and will have no end.

In the Bib's view, the sun of prophecy rises and sets in eternity, as God reveals
the new law whenever the need arises. In this case, we can also observe the affinity of the

Bib's idea with Mulla �adri' s view of "essential motion. "65 The Bab even         asserts that,

See Rahman, The Philosophy ofMulla-$adra: l l - 1 2. See Chapter One of this thesis.

•   within the eternal divine unity, there is a continuous renewal, i.e., new conditions, new
creations, and new order, approaching perfection.66

Another doctrine taught by the Bab is that of the fourth support (al-rukn al-rabi ').

Originally, the Bib himself appears to have taught a version of this doctrine similar to

> that developed by Karim Khan Kirmaru. In his earliest works, Risa?a ft al-sulu7c, as
> MacEoin observes, the Bah states that     re   ligio n   stands on four   pillars: taw�[d,   nubuwwa,

> walciya, and Shi'a. 61 In the Tafs[r Surat al-Baqara, he also states that the Shi'a are the al-
rukn al-raoi ', and in this regard cites a �adfth in which Imam Miisa states that the

,

'greatest name' (al-ism al-a ·�am) consists of four letters: uthe frrst is the statement 'there

is no god but God' ; the second Muqammad is the Prophet of God" ; the third is us

(Imams); and the fourth our Sh1 'a."68

•           MacEoin also points out that the doctrine of al-rukn al-ra"bi' is also discussed in

tafsfr surat al-Kawthar, written for Sayyid Yaf}ya Darabi, under the title '•the hidden

support" (al-rukn al-makhzun).6 In $a�ifa 'Adl[ya, written in 1846 when he was under

house arres t in Shiraz, the Bah drew a hierarchical sketch on the example of the Shl ' ite

prophecies. The Bah spoke of the leaders (nuqaba-,) and the nobles (nujaba-,), and put

them successively below the position of the Imam. In the Bib's view, the nuqaba' are

•   those who have the closest relation to the Imam. One of their responsibilities is to appoint

> their successors, namely the nujaba-.. Unlike the nuqaba, who are unknowable to people,
> the nujaba-, can be rec ognized although the y are hidden from public, and their identities

are disclosed in order to avoi d the hostility of devils.70

The doctrine of al-rukn al-raoi ' is also deve loped in relation to the Bab by Qurrat

al-' Ayn, the only wo man amongst the Letters of the Living. She describes Mu�ammad

and the Imams as the signs (ayat) and proofs (�ujaJ) of God's knowledge to His creation.

She also indicates that they have appeared in every age in different forms and clothing

and that men have been and shall be tested until the day of resurrection. 71 She asserts that

after the disappearance of the Imams, the one to be the sign and proof on behalf of the

Imam to all men is Shaykh Al]mad. On his death, she says, God appoin te d Sayyid K�im
I   Ras ht1, and after Rashfi, Sayyid 'Ali Mu4amm ad was made the bao and �ujja. The Bab
himself will be fo llow ed in his tum by the ope n appearance of the Imam in person.72

From this viewpoint, it seems that the important factor that led to Sayyid � Aii

Mui}ammad being acc epted by his followers as the bao w as the recognition of �sa'i and

> Rashti as the shaykh and bao, and the sayyid and bao, or as the frrst bao, and the second
> bao. The Bib even regarde d them as two mighty gates. He also often referred to them as
> two gates of God, and stated that his mission was to confmn the mission of his

I   predecessors.

According to the Bah, the �timil amr          Allan   (the bearer of God's order)

must always exist in every age, because he constitutes the gate to divine knowledge, and

because the earth cannot be empty of the proof (�ujja) of God, 74 a view which is basically

Shl'i.

The Bib also gave much attention to laws.            In   his early mission, Babi laws were

not quite different from those of Islam. 75 But, wi t h the proclamation of the abrogation of

the Qur' anic shar['a, most of the Babi laws formulated in the Bayan were substantially

different. With regard to the requirements of      �   ibaaa,   the Bab gave a description of Babi

forms of ritual prayer (�a/at), fasting (�awm), pilgrimage (�ajj) and holy war (jiha(J) .

Pilgrimage   (�ajj) was not to be made to Mecc� but to the Bib's house              in Shiraz instead.

cleanliness and spiritual purity. 78

It is also important to look at the B ib ' s doctrine of jihaa, which might have been

the basis for the Babi uprisings against the state in the 1 850s. Although the Bab did not

write a specific work elaborating this doctrine, his thought on jihaa can be found in his

various works. MacEoin notes that in Risa1a Furri' al- 'AdlTya, written in l ate 1 26 1 1 1 845 ,

while he was living in Shiraz after his return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, the Bab

devoted the sixth chapter of this work to discussing the concept of jihaa. In this work he

states that jihaa is one of the branches      (juru-')   of religion and that it resembles formal

prayer   (�alai). The   Bib even explicitly considered jihaa as the sixth pillar of the religion.

In his teaching, it is only the Imam who has the right to permit the jihaa.79 The decree of

I   the Imam is binding upon all, and once the Imam has decreed the jihaa, all believers must

obey, and whoever repudiates the decree is regarded as an unbeliever. In the B ah' s

teaching, jihaa could be raised against the unbelievers, namely those who did not believe

in the   Bayan.   The Bab even viewed the non-Babi provinces as the world of unbelief.

Because the Shi'is of Iran did not believe in the         Bayan,   they were regarded as living in

the area of unbelief, and therefore liable to the decree of jihaa (holy war).           This notion is

•   the denial of bodily resurrection. "83 However, there are still many other Shaykbi ideas

which had an impact upon the Bib's thought in particular, and the                Bab1   doctrine in

general. Rafati states that "there is no doubt that the Bab1 doctrines have closer ties to

Shaykh1 thought than to any other branch of Islamic belief. "84

It is clear that the Shaykhi school provided the background for the                   Babi
movement, and that its doctrine paved the way for the formulation of Babi teachings. No

one can dispute the strong intellectual and social relationship between the Shaykhi school

and the       Bab1   movement. The Bib himself was a student of Sayyid           K�im     Rashfi in

Karbala' , despite     the dispute regarding the length of his stay in the 'Atabit. Most of the

earliest and important disciples of the       Bab   were also Shaykhls, as has been mentioned

earlier. 85   In addition, the recognition of the Bib by his followers was connected to Sayyid
I   K�m      Rasht1' s prophecy. The recognition of the Bah was also initiated by the doctrines

espoused by Shaykh Alpnad and Sayyid K�im concerning the concept of finality and the

Day of Judgment. Nevertheless, what led to the conversion of many Shaykhls to the

Bab's cause was not only these elements, but also the spiritual qualities, writings and

charismatic leadership of the       Bab all

,     of which seem to have convinced the Bibis to

believe in his "prophetic mission."

•           As mentioned above, one of the important areas in which the Bab bad strong ties

> Bah and Shaykh Alpnad A4sa'i highly venerated the Imams. Shaykh Alpnad believed in

Bayan since it bad already covered all   that exists in the macrocosms.90

In addition, we can also observe the similarity of the Bab' s thought to that of
Shaykh A4tnad in the concept of resurrection and finality of the prophet. Shaykh A4mad

believed that a cyclical pattern applies in the theory of the appearance of prophets. 1 With

regard to resurrection Shaykh A4tnad held that it is the day of the advent of the Qa' im.

S imilarly, the Bab believed in the progressive nature of revelation, asserting that future

prophets would perfect the teachings of the previous ones. In connection with this, the

coming of a new prophet marks the day of resurrection. This thought radically

contradicted the literal understanding of the Shi 'a. The Bab asserts that "from the time of

the appearance of Him Who is the Tree of divine Reality, at whatever period and under

•   whatever name, is the Day of Resurrection."

Although no one can deny the fact that the Sbaykhi school did influence the Bab,

we cannot simply regard Babi doctrines as an interpretation or extension of S haykhi

doctrines. There are a number of differences between the two, despite the deep roots of

Babism in Shaykhism. In Rafati' s words, "Shaykh A4tnad never claimed to be a prophet,

as the   Bib   did. Shaykh A4tnad never claimed to have received revelation or a revealed

In accord with Rafati, Nikki Keddie enumerates four points upon which Babism
> differed from Sbaykhism. The        frrst   is the Bab ' s claim to a prophetic status, and that the
> Qur' in was superseded. The second is the             introduction   of the Bab1 law which thus
> abrogated Islamic law (sharf'a). rather than being just the application of allegorical
> interpretation. The third is the millenarian expectation which the Bah aroused, and the

C. Bibi Religious Dissent

Religious dissent can be meant as an opposition to the established doctrines held
> by the religious authorities. It also entails political implications. In        m   ost cases, certain
> thoughts    are   considered as dissenting because they differ from, and even challenge, the
established doctrines held by the religious as well as political authorities of the time.

In this connection, the dispute concerning orthodoxy and heterodoxy or heresy
arises. It is important to raise questions such as who bas the right to determine that certain

•   thoughts and movements        are   orthodox or heretical. Generally speaking, the phenomena of

> orthodoxy and heterodoxy cannot be separated from the religious and political
> establishment. But when there is a change in politics, what is considered dissenting and
> heterodox might become orthodox. However, the question still remains whether a certain
> doctrine is orthodox or heterodox due to its intrinsic nature or due to the political
> situation surrounding it.

It is generally agreed that the conflict between �'orthodoxy" and "heresy", or

"church" and "sect", colors the history of religions and becomes one of its major

> themes.        To a certain extent, this is also the case with the rise of deviant movements in
> Islamic history, even though to describe the divisions in Islam using terms such as �sect'

and 'schism' , 'orthodoxy' and 'heterodoxy' or 'heresy' is to a certain degree misleading,

though conunon. 6 As Bernard Lewis suggests, such a designation is inappropriate since

it is typically Christian. Islam, unlike Christianity, does not have institutions like churches

> or councils to define orthodoxy or heterodoxy.            If Christian experiences can be used as
> an example, however, the rise of heretical tendencies could result from many inter-related

factors, such as social problems, political causes, cultural factors and the figure of         a

charismatic leader.

98 Kurt Rudolph, "Heresy: an Overview," 273.

•           In spite of the importance of social, political and cultural factors, charismatic

leaders in fact play a significant role in forming heretical movements and their later

development. In Islam, charismatic leadership can take the form of the imams, or those

who assume a status close to the imamate. This type of leader can even rise from merely

being the founder of a new sect, to become the founder of a new religion. In the case of

Babism, which is generally considered heretical by its orthodox opponents, its rise and

development cannot be separated from the life of Sayyid 'Ali Muqammad, the Bib, as its

charismatic founder and leader. Charismatic leadership continued to center on him, even

during his arrest and confinement. His charisma along with his doctrines undoubtedly

became a source of inspiration for the Babis in their revolts against the state.

Seen from its history and doctrines, Babism appears as a dissenting movement,

•   which deviates from mainstream Shi'i doctrines, as Bayat notes. She argues that the Babi

movement represented a continuation of the tradition of dissent in Islam, particularly

amongst the Sh1 'a.        MacEoin, however, maintains that Bab1 doctrines, from the early

period up to 1 264/ 1 848, can be regarded as essentially those of orthodox Shl 'ism.

Babism, in this period, was characterized by its pious ·�observance of Shi'i Islamic Law

and custom, to the extent that the movement may be defmed in this period as an extreme

example of Sh1'i pietism."           In his early works, such as the Qayywn   al-Asma' and $a�ifa

•   MacEoin, '6From Sbaykhism to Babism," 20 1 . In a similar manner, Smith also maintains that, in
the early period of his mission, the Bib regarded the Qur' anic sharf'a as valid, and was

•   'Adliyya, the Bib still acknowledged the prevalence of Islamic teachings as binding until

the day of resurrection,          although there were some differences in certain aspects of

doctrine. From 1 848 onward, however, following the Bah's claim to the Qa' imiyya or

even prophethood, his declaration of the new scripture, and the abrogation of Qur' anic

laws, the Bibi movement entered a very distinct phase of its development. The distinctive

nature of this movement was also advanced by various upheavals, while the Bab was in

prison, which were led by the most prominent Bibis .

From the beginning, the Bib ' s claim i n the        Qayyum al-Asma..., to be the gate (ba"b)
> to the Hidden Imam entailed a challenge to the function of the              mujtahid as na..,ib 'amm
(general representative). The use of this title was intended to demonstrate that the gate to

divine knowledge had always been open.              This idea was in contrast to the belief held by

•   the orthodox �ulama that throughout the period of occultation the living              mujtahids served

as intermediaries between the believers and the Imam. The Bib's claim to be the Qa' im

> (or the Hidden Imam in person) also threatened the influence of the               mujtahids, who along
with their claims to vicegerency      (niyaoa) practically "remained the government' s tactical

allies in maintaining a religio-political sway over the populace."                Moreover, with these

incremental claims (to being the      bao and then the Hidden Imam in person or the Qa' im),

> committed to Shi'i legal obse rvance, although the Babis, like the Shaykh1s, put strong emphasis
on the esoteric aspects of Islam, and pietism. Smith, The Babi and Baha 'i Religions, 33.

I   the Bab undoubtedly aroused and encouraged "messianic sentimentsn among his
disciples.

Bab1 dissenting thought can be discerned in several of its doctrines, among others,
the doctrine of "progressive revelation, conditional recognition of temporal authority, and

> this-worldliness of human salvation,"                  as Amanat concludes. The Bah believed in the
> progressive evolution of the human race.. thus confmning progressive revelation. In his
> view, the message and teachings brought by prophets are in accordance with the level of
> maturity of their communities. This implies that a new prophet along with his message is
superior to, thus replacing, the previous one.

Accordingly, the Bayan not only interpreted the Qur' an, but superseded it, while
maintaining the essence of its message. The teachings of previous prophets are prevalent
I   only during their prophetic cycles, and are no longer valid with the coming of new

> prophets. This doctrine was regarded by the mujtahids as serious heretical deviation from
> Islam. This deviation from mainstream Shi 'i Islam reached its climax, as with Nizan
> lsma'ilism, in the proclamation of the qiyama. The Bah' s idea of qiyama did not stand
> alone, but was in harmony with the entire body of Bibi thought and behavior, as has been
discussed elsewhere in this chapter.

It is apparent that the Bab' s claim to be the Mahdi fanned         an   explicit menace to
> the existing religious and political establishment. The attempt by the Bah's followers to
establish what Smith calls a "theocracy'' was therefore not only religious but political as

well.         It is not surprising that Babism bas come to be described by some scholars as the

The phenomenon of Bib1 dissent can also be viewed from this perspective. It
> might be that the initial aim of the Bib was to purify Shi 'ism of the innovations resulting
> from the theological and philosophical activitie s of Sh1'is. It is probable that the Bab was
> thinking in terms of "orthodoxy ,, as was Shaykh            �ad        in an attempt to return the

Shi ism of his time to the pures t teachings of the Imams. But, in reality this search for

''orthodoxy'' by the Bib proved incapable of convincing the majority of the Shi 'is of his

time. The Bib's attempt on the contrary, resulted in severe tensions between himself and

the 'ulama, and in the exclusion of Babism from orthodoxy.                    Indeed, it is likely that

•   social and political factors played a role in this case. And as MacEoin suggests, once the

Babi movement emerged as a separate and distinct sect, it would have generated distinct

nonns and thought which were considered heretical by the orthodoxy' that gave birth to

it   .   t07

Since the Bib ' s thoughts were controvers ial and considered by the 'ulama to be

deviant from the mainstream body of Shl'i and Sbaykhl doctrines, it is no surprise th at

strong reactions and opposition arose. The most important reaction to the Bab ' s claims

and doctrines came from the Shaykhis of Kirman and Tabriz. According to Rafati,

> however, their reactions towards the Bib were different, since these two groups of
> Shaykhis had different interpretations of Shaykhi teachings. On the one band, the Kirmam

•   Shaykhls, under the leadership of Karim Khan, opposed the Bib on an intellectual level.

They composed books and treatises, which show the deviation of the Bab' s doctrine from

the mainstream of Shaykhism and Islam. On the other hand, Tabriz1 Shaykhis opposed

and persecuted the B ab and his followers in cooperation with the political elite.

Karim Khan strongly rejected the Bab' s claims and teachings. He identified the
Bab as a heretic He based his accusation on ten points in the Bah ' s doctrines which he

> considered contradictory to Shi � Islam. In      Risa?a dar raddi·i bao Kar1m Khan mentioned

> ( I ] The claim to a new revelation     (wa�y) after that of MuQammad; [2] the

the twelfth Imam (apparently in respect of prophecies relating to the coming

of the lmam).

Along with his accusations against the Bab, Karim Khan endeavored to lay

emphasis on the validity of the Shaykhl school that he led. He even made efforts to make

the Shaykh1 teachings close to the framework of orthodox Twelver Shi 'ism. This attempt

his
> Risa1a dar raddi-i bao, Karim Khan also shows certain passages of the B ah ' s works
which indicate that latter had deviated from the true Shaykhl teachings established by

Shaykh AQmad and Sayyid K� Rashfi.

Based on these facts, it might be reasonable to assume that Bib1 dissent was
religious in nature. The Bib and his followers must have been aware that their claims had

political implications, especially in a society that considered religion and politics as

interrelated. However, as S mith holds, "the Babis may still be seen primarily as religious

zealots. Only in the context of interaction with the political environment did Babism

1 t2
assume a revolutionary stance."

•   Concluding Note

The discussion above chronicles the gradual development of the Bib's ideas in

particular and the Bab1 movement in general. In the early stages, the Bib laid emphasis on

the symbolic or allegorical interpretation of lslamic doctrines, which eventually

> constituted a distinctive body of thought, different from the common belief held by the
> 'ulama and the Shi'is at that time. During their development, the doctrines set forth by the

Bab showed radical tendencies. Babism was not only regarded by the 'ulama as deviating

from mainstream Shi ism but also by the Shaykhls as dissentin g from the teachings of

'    ,

Shaykh AQmad. Of course, the accusation of being deviant was leveled not merely in

and opposition from the Slii 'i 'ulama, and especi ally from the S haykhl leaders. Since the

movement not only challenged the •uJama, who represented the religious establishment,

but also the existing political authorities, it subsequently faced the suppression of the

THE BABI REVOLTS AND THEIR RELIGIOUS BASIS

A. Radicalization of the Bibl Movement

As was shown earlier. the Babi movement underwent a gradual yet radical shift
when the Bib finally completed the Persian          Bayan,   thereby abrogating the Qur' anic

sharf'a .   This development cannot be separated from an important episode         in   the history

of the Bab1 movement, namely the gathering at Badasht1 of some leading Bab1s during

the interval between Rajah and mid-Sha'ban 1264/June-July 1 848. This gathering

coincided with the Bah's removal from the castle of Chihriq to Tabriz for his public

•   examination. This episode may therefore be seen as marking the rise of a radical tendency

in the Babi movement.

The gathering was attended by about eighty Babis, including some leading figures

such as Mulla Mu�ammad 'Afi B arfuriis h1, known as Quddiis (d. l 265/ 1 849), Qurrat al­

'Ayn (d. l 268/1852) and Mirza ijusayn 'Ali Niiii , the future Baha'ullab (d. l 309/ 1892).

1Badasht is located near the Shahrud river, between Khurasan and Mazandaran.

•   Mulli }Jusayn, the ftrst to believe in the Bib, was not present at this gathering. He could

not reach Badasht because he had been arrested by l:lamza Mirzi,        one of the uncles of the

Shah, but later successfully escape d 4 It is difficult however to detennine the exact

purpose of the gathering. Some scholars argue that the gathering was aimed at disclosing

some of the main non-Islamic or even anti-Islamic aspects of the B abi doctrine, such as

> future action, including the possibility of helping the Bab escape from prison. 5 However�

Balyuzi rejects this explanation. According to him, the meeting' s purpose was to find an

answer to the most crucial issue of the day, i.e., whether the Bah' s mission constituted

merely a continuation of Islam or a b reak from it, or in Balyuzi's words, ''was this

persuasion of theirs just an offshoot of Islam, or was it an independent faith?"

•         In the three-week gathering there emerged different opinions amongst leading

Babis, with each giving different arguments and counter-arguments, notably between

Quddiis and Qurrat    al-' Ayn. The latter insisted   that a new era had come    and that it was

necessary to proclaim the Bab1 movement as       an   independent faith distinct from Islam and

Shi'ism. And, according to     Balyuzi,   with the intervention of the future   Baha'ullah, they

proclaimed the coming of a new dispensation. This episode clearly shows that radical

> tendencies had emerged particularly among the leading Babi figures. Not surprisingly,
many orthodox Muslims accused the Babis of being sinful and deviating from Islam.

Undoubtedly, the gathering had a great impact on the development of the Babi

movement. Further, it is indisputable that Qurrat al-'Ayn played a significant role          in   this

gathering and in the entire process of radicalization. It is reported that she urged her

fellow Babis to lift the veil of concealment. She also insisted on the break from any

connection with Islam and Shi ' ism, thus proclaiming the new religious era. This also

shows how influential Qurrat al-'Ayn was, for she had successfully persuaded the Babis

to accept her views. Although Qurrat al-'Ayn never met the Bab in person, the latter

often sent her letters and messages, charging her with specific tasks. From this, we might
•   speculate that there was continuous contact between the Bab in prison and the leading

Babis, such as Qurrat al-' Ayn and Mulla ijusayn. In view of this fact, it may not have

been accidental that almost at the same time on the announcement of the new religious

era, the Bib proclaimed himself before the orthodox 'ulama as the returned Hidden

> Imam, thus implying that no religious or political elite could claim authority over the
> believers.

B alyuzi, The Ba?J, 167-68. Balyuzi s view on this point seems to have re presented the

Baha1 po sition He maintains that the Bibis' attempt was primarily to establish a new religious

•           In addition to the Badasht gathering and the Bib's claim to being the Mahdi, the

> end of 1848 also witnessed another significant event, namely the march of over two

later to be known as the Bibi revolt at the shrine of Shaykh Tabars1 in Mazandaran.

However, it is important to bear in mind that this process of radicalization in the

authority. In MacEoin's view, the Bab's authority had been transformed into "original,

prophetic charisma."

•            The effect of the Bah's higher claim coupled with the gathering of the Babis at

Badasht was quite clear. Both events paved the way for the further radicalization of the

Bah's followers. Smith maintains that although the Bab ' s claim to being the Mahdi

caused some Bahls to keep their distance from the movement, perhaps out of fear of

suppression by state authorities, most of the Bahls responded positively and gave further

support to the Bah's cause. It is likely that those who left the movement, or at least took

> the way of dissimulation         (taqfya)   were the Babis who took a conservative position. In
> contrast, the Bab' s higher claim was welcomed by the more radical B abis as providing

the momentum to make more radical interpretations with respect to the nature of the

Bab's teachings and mission, thus furnishing the basis for the rise of             a   new religion.

Furthennore, one may argue that Qurrat al- 'Ayn, who was one of the most radical

•   disciples of the Bab, displayed her radicalism and militant spirit not only on questions of

doctrine, but also on issues in the social and political spheres. Therefore, it is not             an

exaggeration to assert that Qurrat al- 'Ayn played a decisive role in influencing the Babi

movement to adopt a radical millenarian belief.

The growth of political militancy and even armed violence at the grass roots level

began with the assassination of Mulla Mul}.amm ad Taqi Baragharu, Qurrat al-'Ayn's

uncle, who was an influential orthodox            'a1im.      This event was then followed by armed

confrontations in the following years. In this context, one can also observe the interaction

and inter-connection between the rise of Bab1 religious radicalism and the increase of

Smith, The Babi and Baha 'i Religions,   25 .

See   Arjomand,   nMillennial Beliefs, Hierocratic Authority, and Revolution in Sbi • ite
Iran,tt 225.

•   political militancy. These two notions have become interrelated themes throughout the

course of Bab1 history. In cities where clerical and state opposition against the Babis grew

significantly, many Bab1s increasingly became religiously radical and politically militant.

As Momen and Smith note, in several towns Bahls also began to carry weapons openly.

In Qazv1n, for example, they began to manufacture swords. As such, in a situation that

was deteriorating, fierce confrontations could be provoked even by minor incidents.

With the rise of radicalism and militancy violent conflicts occurred. Thus the
tension between the Bahls and the state authorities intensified considerably, and once

such tensions increased, the government leaders had a justification to get involved, thus

making their intervention practically inevitable. As a result of this tension, state

authorities considered the B ahls as active insurrectionaries, whereas the Bab1s perceived

•   the government leaders as ungodly enemies.

It is also noteworthy that, despite its radical tendencies, in the period between the

Bah's first confmement and his execution in 1 850, the Babl movement may be seen as

having been far from a homogeneous or uniform movement in terms of its doctrinal

views and political tendencies.        The Babis, of course, still regarded the Bib as their

supreme "religious and political" leader. Nevertheless, they also held in considerable

B. The Bibl Revolts: Causes and Aftermath

In the period between 1848 and 1 853, there were at least four important revolts
involving the   Babis: the revolts at the shrine of Shaykh Tabars1   in Mazandaran   (October

Zanjan (May 1 850-January 1 85 1 ). There was also another important episode, i.e., the

attempt by the Bahls on the life of N�ir al-Din Shih (August 1 5. 1 852) which was

followed by the arrest and execution of a large number of B ahls a few months later. 19

The emergence of the Babi movement can be explained in light of the existence of

a c o mmon Shl 'i millenarian belief and the charismatic qualities of the l ead in g Babis. In

some cases social discontent also provided a background for the B ab1 movement and its

revolt.        However, our discussion will be concerned primarily with three important

revolts: Mazandaran, Naytiz and Zanjan. It will observe a brief chronology of the events

that these revolts contain religious elements.

The Revolt at the Shrine of Shaykh Tabars1 (Mazandaran)

The Bab1 revolt which occurred at the shrine of Sbaykh Tabarsi2 1 in Mazandaran

was unequivocally the frrst and most important revolt in Bah! history. This episode

involved the two leading disciples of the Bab, Mulla ijusayn, Mulla Mul}ammad 'Afi

Birfuriis h1 (Quddiis), and a total of nine of the eighteen letters of the living. 22

Prior to the revolt at the shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi, the Bab instructed Mulla

> l:fusayn to raise the Black Standard in Khurasan and to journey westward. Moreovert he
> issued a general call to his disciples to gather around the Black Standard. When Mulla
•   l:fusayn intended to return to Mashhad, and go on to Karbala' , he received a message

from the Bab through his emissary. The Bab se nt a green turban, and asked Mulla ijusayn

to wear. The Bab also instructed him to help Quddus with the Black Standard raised. 23

I           In July 1 848, the Babis dispersed to various locations throughout Iran because the

Muslim population of the village of Niyila had become hostile to them. The future

> Baha'ull ih, made his way to his district, NUr in Mazandaran. Quddus, on the other hand,
> was arrested and brought to the village of San in Mazandaran, where he lived under arrest

at the house of one of the leading figures of the town, Mirza Mu� ammad Taq1.            In the

same month, several hundred Babis marched from Khurasan              und r

e the leadership of
Mulla J:lusayn. They intended to go westward, and when they approached the town of

San, the Babis camped near the village of Birfuriish. In this village the Babis faced

severe opposition from the Muslim population. The leading a1im of Birfuriish, Mulla

Sa'id Birfuriishi (d. l 270/1 853), known as Sa'id al-'Ulama' provoked the agitation

against the Babis. He provided a great number of weapons, guns and           ammu nition,   and

I   mobilized the people against the Biibis. Although the Biibis were armed only with swords,

they succeeded in defending themselves and in countering the attack of the population.

Having failed to expel the Babis from the town, the Muslim population asked for a cease­

> fire. They also asked Mulla f:lusayn and his fellow Babis to depart from the town in order
> to avoid further opposition and conflict. 24

The leader of the Muslim population also offered to guide the Babis through the

forest of Mazandaran. They promised that they would not mistreat the Babis. In reality,

however, their guide, Khusraw      QiQi Kala'i, under orders from S a 'id al-'Ulama' led the

I   Babis into an ambush as they approached the forest. There was a battle and counter-attack

from both sides, but in the end the local population were still unable to crush the Bahls.25

The Bibis were to experience other such incidents before finally arriving at

Shaykh Tabars1 located in the forest of Mazandaran. On the order of Mulla ijusayn, the

Babis began constructing fortifications and storing food. As the news of the Babi

gathering around the shrine spread Bahls from the neighboring villages came to join

them. They included a large number of artisans, tailors, sword-makers, masons and

peasants. Accordingly, the Bab1 forces became strong enough to gain control over the

shrine. The Babis from other villages also brought livestock, thus providing their fellow

Babis with material as well as moral support. This eventually resulted in the formation of

a Babi community whose members came from many different regions and diverse

I   occupations.

In the course of this gathering, Mulla ijusayn ordered the Babis to collect all the
property they brought. He also bade them to discard all their possessions. As N abil

relates, Mulla f:lusayn addressed the Babis with the following words:

> Leave behind all yow· belongings, and content yourself only with your
> steeds and swords, that all may witness your renunciation of all earthly
> things, and may realize that this little band of God's chosen companions has

26Accounts of the total number of Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi differ widely. Initially there
> were no more than   300 men who followed Mulla ijusayn on anival at Shaykh Tabarsi. However,
> after the news of this event spread, the Bibis of the neighboring villages joined. The probable
> total number of Bibis who participated here, as estimated by Momen, was          537 Bibls. The
I   government assumed that the tolal number of Bibis was     1 500 men, so they had justification to

> suppress the movement. See Momen, "The Social Basis of the Babi Upheavals in Iran         ( 1 848-
1853)," 163-64. See also Bayat. Mysticism and Dissent, 1 19.

•            no desire to safeguard its own property, much less to covet the property of

others.

Mulla f:lusayn' s statement and the practices prevailing at the shrine of Shaykh

Tabarsi have been interpreted by some scholars as propagating the foundation of a society

based on a "common ownership of property."                   The Bahls were even rumored to have

established    a   "socialist" or "communist" society.           This conclusion is to a large extent an

exaggeration in the sense that this analysis is founded only on economic basis. It seems to

disregard the spirit apparently embedded in Mulla f:lusayn' s statement. The statement was

perhaps intended by Mulli f:lusayn to encourage the commitment of the Babis in

defending their faith.

With      the gathering   of such a large number of Babis around          the   shrine, the local

•   Muslim population felt insecure and threatened. They attacked the Babis and tried to

drive them away. When the Bibis wanted to counter-attack, Mulla I:Jusayn forbade them.

From the beginning Mulla ijusayn had prohibited the Babis from initiating an offensive

strike against their attackers.           In short, the Babis seem to have adopted a defensive

strategy in their encounter with the local population.

In addition to Mulla ijusayn, Quddiis played an important role in this Babi revolt.
Quddiis appears to have become a key figure providing guidance to the Babis. Before he

joined   the   B ibis at   the shrine,   he was under arrest by Mirza Muttammad Taqi, but then

•   was released on the insistence of the Babis. The Babis at the fort became increasingly

strong. Both religious and political authorities viewed the gathering as a serious threat.

On hearing that government troops were approaching the fort, Quddus is reported

to have said:

> Never since our occupation of this fort have we under any circumstances
> attempted to direct offensive against our opponent. Not until they unchained
> the ir attack upon us did we arise to defend our lives. Had we cherished the
> ambition of waging holy war against them, had we harbored the least
> intention of achieving ascendancy through the power of our arms over the
unbelievers, we should not, until this day, have remained besieged within

these walls.

Quddus is also reported to have addressed his companions with such words as:

> You should show forth-exemplary renunciation, for such behavior on your
> part will exalt our Cause and redound to its glory. Anything short of
> complete detachment will but serve to tarnish the purity of its name and to

He may graciously assist you to contribute your share to the exaltation of

His Faith.

The revolt at Nayiiz took place during the months of May and June, 1 850. The

figure who played the key role in it was Sayyid Yal].ya Darabi, who upon his conversion

in 1 845 was given the title Valjid by the Bab. 3 While in Tehran in 1 265/ 1 849, he heard

news of the conflict between the B ahls and the government troops at the shrine of Shaykh

Tabarsl. He i n tended to go to Mazandaran, but   was   informed by the future Baha' ullah that

the road to the town was blocked by government troops. Instead, Valjid went to visit

Qum, Kashan, Isfahan and Y azd. In these towns, he successfully converted a number of

prominent notables and 'ulama. His activities and sennons however were opposed by

some ' u1ama as well as by the governor at that time, Aga Khan Iravaru .

In May 1 850, Valjid returned to Nayriz, arriving there by the end of the month. All

•   of his friends and relatives greeted and honored him.

From the pulpit of the mosque he

delivered a speech in which he said:

> My sole purpose in coming to Nayriz in to proclaim the Cause of God. I
> thank and glorify Him for having enabled me to touch your hearts with His
> Message. No need for me to tarry any longer in your midst, for if I prolong
> my stay, I fear that the governor will ill-treat you because of me. He may

allegiance to the Bib. See Moojan Momen, "Darabi, Seyyed Yal}.y3," Elr vii, 10.

> untold indignities.39

In this city, Valjid gained much popularity, and had a large following. U po n his
> arrival, there was tension between Valjid and the governor, Zayn       al-� Abidi n Khan. The
> governor asked him to leave the city, but the Babis d id not allow him to go and gave him

their support. The Babis assured Va}J.1d that they would face whatever hardships was

awaiting them.

The governor then planned to arre st Val;ti d. In order to ac h ie ve his goal, he

recruited a thousand well-trained soldiers, consisting of both c av alry and infantry. They

were equipped with a large number of munitions. When Val].1d learne d of the plans of the

governor, he ordered the Bab1s to occupy the fort of Khaja. This fort is situated in the

vicinity of the Chinar-Sukhti quarter, outside Nayri z . Valjid also asked Shaykh Hadi to

command their forces, and ordered the Babis to further fortify their strongholds. They

also strengthened their defenses and built a water-cistern.40

The Babls were soon besieged by government forces. When the army launched i ts

attacks, some Babis chose to abandon Valjid, and join the government forces, fearing for

their own lives. Under the command of 'Ali Asghar Khan, the brother of the governor,

the troops once more attacked the defenders of the fort. There were at least three Babi s

killed in this conflict. However, the superior government force was unable to defeat the

small number of Babis who were, as in Mazandaran, armed primarily with swords. Not

•   only did the attack prove unsuccessful i n eliminating th e Bah1 forces, 'Ali Asghar Khan

was himself killed in this incident.

Having failed to crush the Bahls at Nayiiz, the governor suspended his attacks and
sent a message to Val:jid. The leader of the government forces offered a cease-fire in order

to persuade Vatjid to leave the fort and to meet with him.          Valjid was well aware of the

deviousness of this offering. However, he walked out in person with five compan ions into

the camp of his enemies, where he was received for three days with great ceremony. But

it was with such tactics as these that the government planned to eliminate the Bahls who

were occupying the fort. The government pressed and tried to compel Valjid to write a

message to his followers, and to assure them that they should leave the fortress and return

to their homes. Valjid attempted to incite his companions against the government troops

•   in   a   second letter, but this letter was never delivered to his fellow Bab1s. Thus, within a

month, the B ib1s at Nayiiz who defended the fort of Khaja were to experience the same

fate as those at the shrine of Shaykb Taharsi

A few days later, Valjid and his companions were killed. Valjid was molested in

the streets of Nayriz, and subjected to indignities at the hands of government troops.

When the government soldiers went back to Shiraz, they brought with them women and

children as prisoners, raising the heads of the murdered B ahls on their bayonets.

The Revolt in Zanjan

The Bab1 revolt in Zanjan occurred between May 1850 and January 185 1 . Zanjan
> is not a very large city, but it is situated in a rich agricultural region and on the main road
> from Tabriz to Tehran, nearer the former.45 At Zanjan, a large proportion of the
> population had become followers of the Bab, primarily through the efforts of Mulla
I   Mul}ammad 'Ali Zanjan!, known as f:lujjat. He was an influential akhba-n ilim of that '

town.46

The Zanjan revolt was spurred by the oppressive policies of the governor of
> Zanjan, Amir Aslin Khan Majd al-Dawla. He was among those who had attended the
> trial of the Bib in Tabriz. From the beginning of the formation of the Bab1 community in
> Zanjan,   the governor had aimed at suppressing it in order to eliminate disturbances, such
> as what happened in Mazandaran. Conflict was also caused by the agitation of the 'ulama

The conflict was then exacerbated by the govemor,s policy of
dividing the town into two distinct quarters, Babis on the one hand and non-Babis on the

thousand men, women, and children.48 The aim behind this division was clear: to make it

easy for the governor to identify the Babis and to eventually destroy them.

In the meantime, ijujjat issued an order to the B ab1s to take control of the fort of

government began sending troops at the request of the Muslim population. The flrst

•   C. The ReUgious Basis of the Bib1 Revolts

The Bib1 revolts embodied many interrelated dimensions. It is important to
> discuss the revolts in light of the millenarianist perspective, religious motives, and the
> paradigm of Karbali' . These three dimension were inherent in the Bib1 movement,
particularly its revolts, and were strongly connected with each other.

From the point of vie w of its doctrine, Babism may be regarded as a millenarian
> movement, and the revolts launched by the Bab1s therefore may be seen as millenarian
> revolts. From a theoretical perspective, millenarian revolts can occur when one or more of
> the following situations prevail. The first is when there is a situation of distress or
> disorientation in a society, and when such a situation develops and increases from time to
> time. The second is when a society in which such as movement exists is deeply
•   committed to its religious world-view, and when the religious ideas held by that society

> provide millenarian themes. The third is when an individual or group of individuals,
> obsessed with "salvationist fantasies", succeeds in establishing charismatic leadership
> over a social movement. 56 To put it in another way, millenarian movements and revolts
> have arisen only in countries or among groups in which religion determines and
> dominates the total world outlook, and in periods when the political and religious aspects
of society remain undifferentiated.

The Shi 'i community of Iran in the nineteenth century can be regarded as a
> traditional society in the sense that it had not yet been affected by what came to be known
> as   umodemn or "Western" ideas, which proposed a complete separation of religion and

Guenter Lewy, "Revolution," ER 12: 376. For further discussion, see Guenter Lewy,
Religion and Revolution (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974), 246.

•   politics. In the same sense, the members of that society were deeply committed to

religious doctrines, namely Shi 'ism. In such a society, religion is relatively difficult to

differentiate from other dimensions of social life, such as politics. Therefore, any

movement, which is inspired by religious beliefs and contains a millenarian leaning often

has political significance. The Bab1 movement at the time undoubtedly contained

millenarian elements, thus threatening the established      religious    and poli ti c al authorities.

At this point, conflict between the Bab1s and the state became inevitable, since the former

to a cenain extent adopted political goals, although not openly, while the latter always

perceived the movement as a threat to their own authority.

In most cases, and as a general rule, the leader of a millenarian movement or

revolt is the bearer of a chiliastic prophecy, and is therefore a prophet, or at least the one

•   who claims prophecy. The prophet normally seeks and attracts         a   following because of his

ethical and religious teachings. With respect to the Babi movement, one cannot dispute

that the Bab himself was a charismatic individual who in 1 848 claimed for himself, and

was believed by his followers, to be the bearer of prophetic revelation, a claim which had

been preceded a few years earlier by his assertion that he was the gate to the Hidden

Imam. And in each case, it is important to emphasize, the Bib laid claim to absolute

religious authority.

In all his complexity, the Bib served as a usymbolic figurehead" to the Bibi
movement, a symbol which was wielded by his disciples in his absence. This was also the

case with other Bibi leaders, whose charismatic quality was derived from their piety and

sanctity. Smith has suggested that the charismatic authority of the leader lay generally in a
57See   Smith, "Millenarianism in the Babi and Baha'i Religions," 232-233.

I   "claim to messianic or prophetic status, and this claim may be made personally by the

leader or ascribed to him by others. "58

Therefore, inherent in the millenarian themes of the Bab1 movement was Babi

charismatic leadership. The Babi leaders played a considerable role particularly in

determining the "political posture and orientation" of the movement. We can discern this

in   the Bab1 revolt   at   the shrine   of   Shaykh Tabars1,   for   example, where Mulla J:lusayn   as

well as Quddiis played salient roles as the directing minds formulating Bab1 strategy in

defence against government troops. It can be said that their leadership in the movements

was in all practical tenns charismatic. The authority of these charismatic leaders was

accepted because their followers believed in their extraordinary quality. Therefore,

because their followers perceived and valued them in such a way, these leaders were '�set

I   apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at

least specifically exceptional powers or qualities."59

Another aspect embodied in the millenarian Babi revolt was religious symbols

employed by its leaders mostly as a means to simplify the nature and orientation of the

movement. In religiously inspired millenarian revolts, the role of religious symbols is

particularly important. They can provide a blueprint of identity, inspiration and mode of

conduct. In this respect, Arjomand has noted that ureligious symbolism can significantly

affect both the causes and the consequences of revolutions: they can provide motives for

revolutionary action, as well as the actors ' idiom for understanding their own action, and

•   can provide the repertory of the value-ideas that                are   selective ly institutionalized by

> such symbols was quite clear. The use of a green turban by Mulla l:lusayn and the raising

of the Black Standard in the Babl march from Khurasan to Mazandaran point to the

> significance of religious symbols. These symbols also served to provide motive, a
> fighting spirit, and to some extent, religious and politic al justification for the re vo l ts As    .

will be seen later, another symbolic motif emp loyed by the Bab1 leaders was the

martyrdom of Imam I:Iusayn.

In addition to millenarianism, the religious basis of Babism can clear!y be

observed in the way the movement was disseminated throughout Iran and in the course of

the Babl revolts.      First   of all, the role of the Bab1 ''religious class" was important in the

•   early p hase of development. As is generally known, the early disciple s of the Bah (the

eighteen Letters of the Living) were mostly 'ulama or seminarians who had been the

students of Sayyid �im Rashfi, the Shaykhl leader. The Letters of the Living and other

followers of the Bab zealously spread the doctrine from town to town and from village to

village.

Although they often faced severe opposition from the orthodox � ulama and the
government, they seem to have been successful in converting a number of persons to

Babism,     inc lu ding 'ulama and other notables. According to Momen, "those converted to

Babism      were   drawn from all     social classes with a preponde rance from the 'ulama, who

Arjomand9 "Millennia! Beliefs9     Hierocratic   Authority, and Revolution in Shi'ite   Iran,"

also provided the leadership of the movement." This was also evident in the case of

IJujjat' s conversion, which was followed by that of a large number of his own followers,

thus leading to the formation of the Bab1 community in Zanjan. He himself was a leading

> 'ilim of his town. Similarly, the religious preaching of Valjid, who also came from a
> religious family and background, also shows that this movement attracted many followers

and converts on the basis of its religious teachings.

In short, it can therefore be said that the most important factor that led to the

conversion of many to Babism seems to have been the belief in the Bah ' s claims and

teachings, which they believed to be revelation from God. If there is evidence that social,

economic and political motives played a role iu this conversion, these can be said to be

secondary to the religious motives.6

•           Browne observes that a significant religious motivation was embodied in the B ab1

revolts, and argues that the B ahls who actively battled against the government troops at

the shrine of Shaykh Tabars1 , Zanjan, Nayrlz and elsewhere were struggling to establish

what is called   a   "Bab1 theocracy and a reign of the saints on earth."6 Whatever the exact

political goals of the Bahls in their revolts might have been, one cannot deny the

significance of religious feeling in the hearts of the Bab1s. From the religio-psychological

As Momen points out, the majority of Babis, particularly the Bib himself and other
> leading figures of the Bibi movement, had a strong religious commitment. Momen, "The Social
> Basis of the Babi Upheavals in lran ( 1 848- 1 853)," 1 80. According to Amanat, the merchants and

•   viewpoint, the Babis seem to have felt that they were obliged by their faith to defend their

belief. Browne admits that the interest of the Babis was for the most part "the triumph of

their faith, not in any projects of social or political reform. "64

While Browne seems to have emphasized the importance of the religious impulse

underlying the Bab1 revolts, M. S . Ivanov perceives the revolts from another perspective.

> Ivanov maintains that there was            a social and economic basis which underpinned the
> religious format of the Bab1 movement and revolts. The basis of his analysis seems to

have been the fact that "the moving forces behind the Bab1 uprisings were the peasants,

artisan, urban poor, and small trades-people."

According to Ivanov, the Babl revolts seem to have been predominantly

characterized by an economic motif. Ivanov lays stress on the anti-feudal attitude of the

•   Babis, the struggle against exploitation, and demands for the abolition of private property,

the equality of all people, and a common ownership of property in the realm of the Bab1

state.        These features seem to have existed in the Bab1 movement, particularly in the

revolt at the shrine of Shaykh Tabars1. Indeed, Ivanov seems to derive his conclusion

from the stances of the Bib1s in the fort of Mazandaran, as explained earlier. However,

one may argue that these features were secondary to the fact that the Bab1s in

Mazandaran, under the leadership of Mull a ijusayn and Quddiis, were living in severe

isolation and were oppressed by government troops. The order of Mulla }Jusayn to B abis

to collect their property does not necessarily indicate that he intended to establish what

•   some scholars call a "socialist" or even "communist" society. In short, it may be said that
these terms are anachronistic and were far from the Babis' thinking.

MacEoin also sees the predominance of religious motives at the shrine of Shaykh
> Tabarsi   as   well as elsewhere. He even argues that there was an element of jihaa
> underlying the Babis' spirit in their revolts. However, it is important to note that the Babi
> leaders at Shaykh Tabars1 did not instruct the Bab1s to initiate an offensive war against
> the troops or the population. The Babi attacks were basically in the form of a udefensive
> jihtid."61 In view of this, the Bahls seem to have been well aware of their small numbers

> martyrs. Their desire to be martyrs, as defenders of the true faith, was also motivated by
> the role of martyrdom as an important element in Shl'i piety. Therefore they wished to die
•   in a holy defeat.

Parallel and inherent in this religious motive is the ethos of social justice. As
> previously mentioned, the Bab basically recognized the temporal rulers as legitimate as
> long as the latter obeyed the laws ordained by the Bab, and submitted to the cause of the
> Bib. The Babi acceptance of the legitimacy of temporal rulers was also on the condition

> responsible."68

•           It is also interesting to observe the religious element in the Nayrlz and Zanjan

revolts. Scholars such as Momen and Smith share the same opinion with respect to the

nature and situation of Nayr1z and Zanjan. They maintain that there was a certain

resemblance between the two in terms of the extent of religious conversion to Babism

prior to the revolts.69 Conversion was caused by the influence of Valjid on Nayriz and

ijujjat on Zanj an� who enjoyed popularity and great respect from the population. It is not

surprising that their conversion to Babism contributed to the rapid expansion of the

movement and to the formation of a Babi community in each town.

Another resemblance may be found in the nature of the revolts in these towns.

Momen points out that the Zanjan and Nayr1z incidents were "localized urban upheavals

centered on one charismatic personality who had been converted to Babism and

•   suc ceeded in attracting a large portion of the populace of the town to    a   new movement"7

with no support from the neighboring peasantry or from the Babis of other regions. The

urban nature of the revolt in Zanjan is also demonstrated by the large number of "the

poor� the traders of the bazaar, the sadat, and the students," who participated there. 7 1

However, i t is to b e noted that the leaders o f the revolts were still uBab1 'ulama."

Both Momen and Walbridge distinguish these two revolts from the one at the

shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi. The Babis in the latter case were not a "pre-existent group but

were an ad hoc band of religious enthusiasts gathered around the charismatic leadership

69See Momen, "The S ocial Basis of the Babi Upheavals in Iran ( 1848- 1 853)9" 1 79 ;
Smith, "Millenarianism in the Babi and Baha' i Religions�" 246. See also S mith and Momen     .

I   of Mullii J:lusayn and Quddiis."72 Momen states that the revolt at the shrine constituted a

"definite challenge to the existing order," involving active, large scale Babi participation

from all parts of Iran, its participants representing all different rural and urban groupings

in the country."73 With this comparison, Momen seems to imply that the revolt at Shaykh

> Tabarsi displayed pure religious motives /4 and was marked by the fact that the
> participants of the Babi uprising there included Babis of a variety of occupation. but

mostly 'ulama.75 Walbridge argues that the Bab1s at Shaykh Tabars1 "were united only by

religion, and their fighting had a much more symbolic character."76 Smith also elaborates

on how different the situations were at Nayriz and Zanjan from that at the shrine of

Shaykh Tabarsi. In the frrst two, as S mith notes, the Babis' concentration was high; they

also tended to show their distinctive identity as Babis openly; the leaders of the

I   movement in these towns were prominent personalities; and the local tensions had existed

before the Babi revolts, due to the antagonism of the local 'ulama and the corruption of

local governors.77

Despite some different features, the revolts at the shrine of Shaykh Tabars1,

Nayiiz and Zanjan can be perceived from the perspective of the advent of the Mahdi. The

•   Babis, whose beliefs originated in Sh1�ism, believed that the Mahdi would come to

liberate the earth from injustice and corruption. These revolts were also used by the B abis

"as measures of self-defense against the attacks of their enemies, but only to a very minor

extent as a means of bringing about political or social reform."

This defensive attitude was therefore another aspect of the B abi revolts. It seems

clear that there was no obvious intention on the part of the Bahls to take power from the

ruling authorities.        This can be seen from the fact that there was no overall strategy to

organize Babi revolts at the national level. Rather, the revolts were relatively local in

scale and defensive in nature. The defensive nature of the Babi revolts was also

determined by the absence of clear instructions from the Bab himself or the Babi leaders.

Although the wearing of a green turban and the raising of the Black Standard might have

I   symbolically represented the propagation of war, it is evident however that the Babis' aim

in their march westward was probably to help the Bab escape from prison. Had they not

been regarded as a threat to the political authority, and thus been suppressed, the Babis

would never have mounted their revolts in Mazandaran, Nayriz or Zanjan.

From this perspective, one may question Bayat' s argument that the Babis showed

hostility towards the established religious and political order. As far as the sources

indicate, it seems that "hostility" came rather from those of the 'ulama and state who

collaborated in reacting against the Babis, as previously shown. It is probable that some

Babis envisaged the possibility of establishing some kind of independent Babi kingdom

•   or state. However, it cannot be denied that the Bib himself never once seems to have

As Smith points out, in the absence of the Bib's order, the Bab1s who fought at the shrine

> of Shaykh Tabarsi, Nayiiz and Zanjan seem to have regarded themselves as ��re­
experiencing the heroic sacrifice of Karbala' ; dying as martyrs heralding the new age of
the Mahcfi.

As such, the episode of Karbala' , the battle at which Imam I:Iusayn together with a
> small band of his followers, died fighting the forces of the corrupt Umayyad regime,
> constitutes an important paradigmatic element of the spirit behind the Babi revolts. In
> addition, the Babi spirit was also stirred by the news of the Bib's execution. As is
•   generally held, the killing of a prominent leader can cause, and even intensify fighting.

> Therefore, the murder of the Bib by the government anny in fact added impetus to the
on-going revolts in Zanjan.

In addition, the martyrdom of Imam I:Iusayn served as a model for the behavior of
> believers. The Bibis portrayed Imam ijusayn as having rejected temporal authority in
> favor of political revolt. Thus, his movement was a religiously motivated rebellion, that
> was necessitated by the ethical and religious corruption of the Umayyads. His action,
> therefore, provided a model of political dissent that must be foUowed when similar
circumstances arise.

In this regard, it is important to discern how the Shi'is, and the Bib1s in particular,
perceived history. They seem to have regarded history not as events of the past, but as
80Smith,     "Millenarianism in the Babi and Baha, i Religions," 248.

•   something alive and ever present. Human history is pictured by the Shl'is generally as a

In view of this, the Bab1s who struggled at Mazandaran, Nayrlz, Zanjan and elsewhere

I   symbolic quality, and steeled them for death and inevitable but holy defeat." 82

•   Concluding Note

We have seen that the conflicts between the Bab1s and the government troops

inevitably occurred because each side acted on the basis of its own perspective. The

government attempted to eliminate the danger of the Bab1 doctrine and movement. They

saw the movement as threatening the stability of the state. On the part of the Bahls, they

had no choice other than to defend themselves and to fight in the name of their faith.

They had an excellent model in the martyrdom of Imam ijusayn. Despite the fact that the

Bib had proclaimed a new dispensation, and the ·ulama condemned the Bah and the

Babis as apostates from Islam, the Babis still regarded Imam l:fusayn as an archetype

worthy of emulation. That is the Babis saw themselves as the true Muslims. The nature of

the conflict was defensive on the part of the Bahls, and aggressive on that of the

•   government. Although social discontent prevailing at that time might have contributed to

the conflicts between the Babis and the state, the religious basis as well as the paradigm

of Karbala' can best explain the motives underlying the Babi revolts. In view of this,

religious symbolism played an important role in the Babi movement, just as at the same

time the Bibis viewed their struggle as a reenactment of the tragedy of Karbala' .

•                                        Conclusion

> The rise of the Bibi movement ( 1 260/ 1 844) coincided with the thousandth anniversary of
> the occultation of the Twelfth Im am in 260/873-4. The rapid growth of the movement
> was fueled primarily by the Shl 'i messianic belief in the advent of the Hidden Imam, the
> Bah's religious teachings, and the charismatic leadership heading up the movement. Its
> growing popularity was also encouraged by the social, economic and political discontent
> prevailing in early nineteenth-century Iran. These factors together provided the basis for
the acceptance and expansion of the Bab1 movement.

Although Amanat and Arjomand place emphasis on messianic belief as having
been the most important factor in the growth of the movement, one cannot ignore the role
•   of   charismatic leaders in disseminating its doctrines and in directing its political

> orientation. The role of early disciples of the Bib, such as Mulla f:lusayn, Quddiis and
> Qurrat al-' Ayn, as well as of other Bibi leaders such Valjid and l:fujjat was quite
> significant. It was their efforts which laid the foundation of the Babi community in
> different cities throughout Iran. It was also they who were responsible for providing
> leadership to the movement, while the Bib was in prison, particularly during the Babi
revolts against the state.

The Bab1 movement was greatly influenced by the doctrines of the Shaykhi
> school, and the Bib himself was convinced by the prophecies of Sayyid K� Rasbfi
> with regard to the appearance of a messianic figure after the latter's death. The Bib's
> interpretation of several religious doctrines, particularly those concerning eschatological

•   problems such as resurrection, and hi s idea of the progressive nature of revelation,

> likewise have their roots in Shaykhi teachings. As we have seen, the Bib interpreted the
> doctrine of resurrection differently from the orthodox theologians, saying in fact that
> resurrection is marked by the appearance of a new manifestation, a new prophet and a
> new religion. This doctrine implied that divine revelation is endless, and will continue to
> advance in accordance with human progress towards maturity. This view of resurrection
> constituted one of the Bib's principal dissenting thoughts from mainstream Shi 'ism. Bab1
> dissent from Shi 'ism cul min ated in the Bah's claim to being the Mahdi, which entailed
> the abrogation of the Islamic shan'a and the proclamation of a ne w scripture and a new
> reli gion   .

In     a sense, the Bab seemed to see himself as undertaking to return Shi 'ism to the
I   original teaching of the Imams,       as   Shaykh AQmad   Al}sa"i had attempted to do. The Bab

> may have seen the doctrines held by the 'ulama of that time as deviati ng from the true
> Sbi 'i faith .   It is in this sense that the Bib may have thought of himself as a defender of
> "orthodoxy." However, fearing the threat of the Babi movement, the 'ulama and
> government officials condemned and persecuted the Babis on religious grounds as well             as

> for political reasons. The Babi movement was seen as religiously deviant, and politically
hazardous to both religious and political authorities.

The accusation was not surprising since the Bib's claim       to   mabdihood in effect
> challenged the legitimacy of the 'ulama and the state to rule over          believers.   For in the
> presence of the Mahdi, no religious or temporal authorities could ever claim power or
> authority (walaya), because all Stii 'is must submit to the Imam in all matters of their

•   religious, political, spiritual and temporal lives. At this point, the B abi movement had

changed from being merely a "sectarian                development     within     Shi 'ism"   into     a

"revolutionary movement." This development led to severe conflict in the form of armed

revolt between the Bahls on the one hand and the state' s troops on the other.

However,   as   we have seen, the insurrections that took place at the shrine of

Shaykh Tabars1, at Nayiiz and at Zanjan were largely defensive in nature. Although in

some passages of his works the Bib addressed the doctrine of jihaa, in reality there is no

clear evidence to support the view that the Bab1 revolts were ever inspired by the Bab ' s

writings on this topic. Rather, the primary aims of the Bibis in rebelling against the

government seem to have been to defend their religious beliefs, and at the same time to

emulate the example shown by Imam l:fusayn at Karbala' . Although social and political

•   discontent may have been a factor in these revolts, it     was   religious motives that primarily

underpinned them, with the martyrdom of Imam f:lusayn serving             as a   paradigm in their

encounter with the religious and political authorities .

In addition, despite the fact that some scholars discern political goals behind these
revolts, the absence of the Bab' s specific instruction and the lack of general strategy on

the part of the Bibis, for example, serve as proofs that the Bibis seem to have simply

defended their faith and their lives on the basis of religious concerns. This is also

apparent in the use of religious symbols by the charismatic Bab1 leaders, particularly in

> the course of the Bibi revolts. The political aims, if there were any, were secondary.

Therefore, the phenomenon of Babism cannot be viewed simply,            as   B ayat refers to, as the

•           1Smith, The Babi and Baha 'i Religions, 25.

"politicization of dissent in Sh1 'a thought." As we have seen, the Babi movement in fact

represented a system of religious and political interconnections. B abi religious dissent

entailed political implications, and Bab1 political revolts contained religious elements,

thus demonstrating that religion and politics had become fused in the Babi movement.

However, apart from the religious dimensions in the Bab1 movement and in

particular its revolts, the significance of the Babi movement for the later development of

Iran, as Keddie notes, was much more political than religious. The Babi movement

perhaps did not contribute much to religious or moral reform of the country. However,

after the collapse of the movement in 18 53 and its split into two groups, Azafis and

Bahafjs, the existing Babis continued to attract converts and admiration. Conversions

were partly the result of the open hostility that the government and the orthodox clerical

•   authorities displayed towards the Babis. Although few in number, the Bibis remained

important much more as "symbols and unrecognized leaders in refonn than as          a mass

> religion." This was to   be proved later on in the early twentieth century, when the leading
> figures to pave the way for the constitutional revolution of 1 905 in Iran were figures with

religious affiliations to Babism. Many Azalis even held government positions in early

twentieth century Iran.4
