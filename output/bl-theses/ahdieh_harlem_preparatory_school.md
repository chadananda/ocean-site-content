Harlem Preparatory School was originally con-
> ceived to provide creative educational experiences
> for some of the 70,000 dropouts residing in the ghetto
> areas of' New York City.               Students who, for the most
> part, had dropped out of' the public schools, were
> to have entered Harlem Prep after having attended a
> Street Academy.           A concomitant goal was for Harlem
> Prep to develop into a model of creative educational
activities.          Through its innovative educational system,

> it would place the drop-out in colleges and universities.
> By doing so, a major impact would be made on the exist-
> ing New York Board of Education to emulate Harlem
Prep's successful program.

The HARYOU Document, Youth in the Ghetto:                          A
Study of' the Consequences of Powerlessness and a Blue-
print for Change indicated an average of one thousand

dropouts per month in Central and East Harlem.                                Recent
> studies indicate that over 30 per cent of high school
> students in the United States are dropping out of
> school yearly.            The tragedy of the ghetto is the
> appalling fact of wasted talent and the drain on the
> national economy.             It is estimated that nearly 70
> per cent of the dropouts on the streets of Harlem
> have the capacity for college work, and that they
> are not lazy, unmotivated, and apathetic.                           It is sig-
> nificant that only 1 per cent of the residents of
> Harlem went to college in 1967, the year that Harlem
Preparatory School was founded.

Harlem Preparatory School as one of the leading
> alternative schools in the country plays a major role
> in the development of these community schools, and
> this document is the study of its foundation and its
> possible financial and educational development in the
future.

The author has attempted to formulate two
> plans, an educational and financial one based on his
> experience as one of the two chief administrators of
the school.

Harlem Prep has been dedicated to providing
> for each student the opportunity to realize the highest
intellectual, social, cultural, physical, and personal

vii

development of which he is capable.                       The school seeks
> to foster the total growth of its students, preparing
> them for their educational and career objectives,
> and for their roles in society as enlightened, re-
sponsible human beings.

For the next ten years, the organization,
> administration, and curriculum of Harlem Prep should
attempt to be open and flexible.                       The students whom

it serves are, for the most part, those who have
> already rejected the usual approach to learning and
> the conventional curriculum.                    These students should
> be given opportunities to develop according to their
> individual capacities.                An open, cycle-breaking system
> approach should offer the best means for accomplishing
> this.      Using this approach has been successful in
> educating a large number of students and placing them
> in colleges, and this should continue.                         Additional
courses in vocational training should be offered.

The main difficulty of an alternative school
> in urban areas outside the public educational system
> is not the attitude of teachers, the learning ability
> of students, or community environment, but rather
> it is the financial difficulties that all these in-
> stitutions face.

viii

Any agreement with the Board of Education or
> any other governmental agencies that does not guarantee
> Harlem Prep freedom of appointing administrators, and
> teachers, developing and implementing new curriculum,
> and hiring staff or allocating a budget will, in the
> long run, change the ideals upon which the school was
> originally founded.              Therefore, a ten-year development
> plan has been proposed, which could serve as an al-
> ternative or a supplementary program to funds received
> from the Board of Education.

A great deal of interest has been generated
> over the last fifteen years in the problems of our
> educational system.              One of the outgrowths of this
> interest was the creation of a new                     solution~the

alternative school, the brain child of concerned

community leaders and alarmed professional educators.

> Most of the alternative schools in the inner cities
> took shape largely due to the support of private
> funding organizations, and the unhappiness of parents
and students with the prevailing educational system.

During this same period another problem has
> become increasingly             serious~the          number of students
> who each year drop out of the public school system.
> While many alternative schools have sought to deal
> with the inadequacies of the public school system in
> general, only a very few have also tried to deal with
> the problem of the drop-out as well.                        One of the most
> successful of this latter group is Harlem Preparatory
School.

Initially, in the following study, we shall
> try to define the problem of drop-outs and the serious
consequences of this problem to the individual and to

> society.        Then we shall trace the               h~s~ory      of Harlem
> Preparatory School as it has attempted to deal with
> both the problem of inadequate schools and that of
> drop-outs.         We will pay attention to the successes
> of the school and also to the problems that have
beset it and other alternative schools.

The major emphasis of the study will be on
> the future of Harlem Prep, both educationally and
> financially.          On the one hand, we will suggest possible
> curriculum developments over the next ten years that .
> will further enrich the course of study at the school
> and at the same time better serve both the students
> themselves and the Harlem community as well.                             On the
> other hand, we shall deal with the most troublesome
> problem of Harlem Prep and most other alternative
> schools~funding.              As a solution to this problem a
ten-year development plan will be discussed in detail.

The two educational and financial plans are
> based on the author's experience as one of the chief
> administrators of the school and will foreshadow the
> future of Harlem Preparatory School.

CHAPTER                 I

ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS AND DROP-OUTS

The American inner-city communities by and
> large are fixed, closed, and inert as they exist.
> They are no more than the embodiment of past human
> indifference and the manifestation of human injustices.
> The mummification of the total community has led to
> the mummification of the individual's thinking, his
> or her ability to live, to be free, and to be a whole
> person.       The apathy in these communities is a direct,
logical consequence of this decay of the inner cities.

The present public educational system is the
> by-product of this milieu.                  Charles Silbermann, after
> visiting public schools in the inner-city for three
> years, wrote:

> It is not possible to spend any prolonged
> period visiting public classrooms without
> being appalled by the mutilation visible
> everywhere~mutilation of spontaneity, of
> joy in learning, of pleasure in creating,
> of sense of self • • • . Because adults take
> the schools so much for granted, they fail
> to appreciate what grim, joyless places
> most American schools are, how oppressive
> and petty are the rules by which they are
> governed, how intellectually sterile and
esthetically barren the atmosphere, what

> an appalling lack of civility obtains on the
> part of teachers and principals, what con-
> tempt they unconsciously display for children
> as children.I

Such public schools lead to enforced relation-
> ships of exploitation, create competition to weed
> out the "mighty" from the "weak," demand rigidity
> and submissiveness, and compound inferiority.                             Ad-
> ministrative problems in these schools have been
> solved by routine control.                  This process is often
> deemed a regrettable necessity for efficiency and
> discipline.          Ronald Gross, commenting on these schools,
> has written:

> Our schools fail to achieve their stated
> purposes. Rather, many are not even decent
> places for our children to be. They damage,
> they thwart, they stifle children's natural
> capacity to learn and grow healthily. To
> use Jonathan Kozol's frightening but neces-
> sary metaphor: they destroy the minds and
> hearts of our children.2

The large number of schools that have developed
in rebellion against these prisons of the mind are

> testimony to the barrenness of the preoccupation with
> efficiency in these institutions.                      Alternative schools,
> like Harlem Prep, Shanti, SASSI, and Highland Park
> are evidences of dissatisfaction with public education
as it is presently conducted in the United States. 3

The creation of alternative community schools
> is part of a continuous struggle toward the creation
> of a new social system based on genuine human kindness,
> free social interchange and choice for students.                              An
> alternative school within a community attempts to
> help create less destructive relationships among
> people.       This means helping them to meet basic physical
> and psychological needs in a way that does not destroy
> them or others.            Instead, it may transform the con-
ditions which have molded all of us.

While the most well known alternatives to the
> public school are private and parochial schools, there
> are a growing number of community alternative schools.

Kenneth Clark writes:

> While there are no alternatives to the present
> system~short of present private and parochial

> but we will also demonstrate the validity

Within these alternative schools there is
> a continuous effort to develop some degree of collec-
> tive consciousness and collective responsibility
among the faculty, students, and administration,

unlike most other large American schools which are
atomized, not only by different grades but within

of the tremendous social pressure which operates on
> the school.          In most alternative schools, sharing
> work, emphasis on the multi-faceted human being's
> awareness of the oneness of man, warmth to visitors,
> and mutual aid are indications of the success or
> failure of the school to affect the consciousness of
·. the students and staff.              Any major drop in these
indicators would probably mean the end of the school.

Some might argue that the alternative schools
> cannot be much of an alternative when they still have
> grades, stress academic strength, and prepare students
> for entry into college.                Grades and college acceptance
> in and of themselves do not say whether they were
> accomplished in a public or alternative school's
> environment.          There are, however, real differences
> between the two kinds of schools.                      In most alternative
> schools, there is a high degree of pFagmatism con-
> cerning the survival needs of the students.                            The
> struggle to change the totality of individual lives
> will not succeed by teaching children or adults how
> to make a canoe, nor by offering courses in creative
> sewing, organic gardening, pottery, weaving, and
> gourmet cooking.            If the alternative school did not
> pragmatically strengthen the ability of students to
> live while the struggle to change their relationship

> with each other was being fought, the school's value
> to the students and the community would be severely
limited.

In most of these schools, the prevailing
> emotional tone is non-violent, gentle yet militant,
> in the pursuit of the school's defined goals.                               They
> may even look conservative rather than radical.                              They
are indeed "humanely conservative" in their stress

> on basic education.             Their aims are accomplished in
> non-traditional ways, while combining the humanistic
and intellectual values.

Does this seem to be a possible conflict?

> Yes!      Does the need for students to have food, clothing,
> and shelter often times result in the continued ex-
> ploitative individualism we are against?                           Yes!      But
> it is our consciousness of these facts which allows
> us to have some effect on how these needs will be
> met.      It is the height of na1vete to believe that an
> alternative school alone is going to change the unjust
> system we live in.             Therefore a pragmatic element is
necessary, if, for nothing else, to survive.

Another difference between alternative and
> public schools is the ability of these schools to
> create (given the limitations imposed by cost and
> objective physical structures) a free moving environment

> filled with variety and controversy.                        This is a major
> goal at these schools and one which has nearly been
> met.     Unlike public schools they are not locked in
> static     molds~sharp         teacher-student division, rigid
> union contracts, lock-step curriculum, and tracking.
> Students and teachers are encouraged to create an
> environment which will allow the greatest degree of
> inquiry and learning.               These relationships vary from
> teacher to teacher, from class to class, and from
> school to school, but all are aware of the general
goals that they are striving for.

Most of these schools stress the following
goals in their blueprint: 5

1. Enabling students to learn at their
own rate.

2. An array of course offerings designed
> to meet the needs and interests of students
of all ability levels.

3. Individualization of instruction and
> a serious attempt to avoid the impersonaliza-
tion of large, overcrowded schools.

4. The development of a sense of self-
> reliance and independence among students and
> an ability to learn on their own outside
of the formal classroom.

5. Teacher and student involvement in
the development of the educational program.

venture, 11 Phi Delta Kappan, October, 1971, p. 108.

There are standards that must be met.                        Ac-
> countability shows a seriousness of work, a belief
> in one's strength and in each other, an affirmation
> of our attempt to be more human.                      Non-accountability,
> non-responsibility, and non-involvement are signs
> of contempt for people; and if these attitudes become
> predominant, they will subvert the purposes of the
> alternative school and ultimately will destroy the
> school itself.           To set no standards of work is to do
> exactly what many schools have done to disadvantaged
> students 6-not taking them seriously. That the use
> of standards can become oppressive is true, but con-
> sciousness of its_ danger can make it less likely to
> happen.       In an alternative system this understanding
varies from person to person and school to school.

understand that often non-involvement is a negative

According to this chart, in the earlier part

Why, then, do these students, especially
those in urban areas, drop out?                     There are several

reasons:

1.     Lower class blacks, Puerto Ricans, and
> children from other minority groups are inadequately
> prepare( to complete high school.                      James S. Coleman's
> study and the work of a few other sociologists are
a good testimony to this fact.                     On behalf of the

United States Office of Education, Coleman and his
associates undertook a study which covered more than

645,000 children in grades 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 in
about 4,000 schools throughout the country.                             The

> findings of this study indicated that 85 per cent of
> the black children performed below the average of
white children.            The disparity was even greater between

groups in the same grade level in the Northeast; at
> the third grade level, a black child read one grade
level below that of the average white child in the

same grade.        As the grade level increased, the gap
> widened between the black and white children.                                 By
> the twelfth grade, the difference between groups in
reading was nearly three years. 14

2.    The children of the poor and the disad-
vantaged lack an adequate self-concept, motivation,

> alistic ones far beyond their capacity.                         What is
> lacking, essentially, is a will to sustain those
hopes and continuous efforts to attain them. 15

There are several reasons for developing
> such attitudes.            It is said that the parental edu-
> cation level sets the level for the educational goals
> of the offspring.             Similarly, the educational level
> of the parents affects the occupational status and
> family income, which simultaneously influence the
> child's motivation for a good education.                          If the
> child could have models either in his family or his
> community of higher educational, occupational, and
> economic achievement, he would more likely work harder
and would seek higher education.

As to his self-concept, there is much evidence
> to support the theory that it is closely linked to the
> student's performance.               Deutsch, in an empirical study

> covering 292 students from Harlem, reported a "sig-

> tive self-concept. 1116 He further remarked:

> Social disadvantage occasioned by the con-
> ditions associated with poverty may result
> in some cognitive and learning deficits
> relative to the demands of the early grades.
> With early failure or difficulty in academic
> tasks, the child's self-confidence may be

> cult and unrewarding. The lower achievement
> level may even feed back on the slower
> development of the original abilities. In
> any case, lowered abilities may produce
> lower achievements, lowered achievements
> may induce diminished self-confidence which
> in turn may feed back upon the achievements
> and so on.17

There are a few educators who challenge some
> of these assumptions about dropouts.                       A study con-
> ducted by Jerald G. Bachman, from the University of
Michigan, indicates that there are hardly any dif-

> ferences in self-esteem, behavior patterns, levels
> of income between those who drop out or those who
> stay in. 18

CHAPTER                 II

HISTORICAL AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND OF

HARLEM PREPARATORY SCHOOL

The history of the disadvantaged generally
> and their recent outspoken protests, specifically,
have led to today's long due overhaul of American

society and its so-called traditional values.                             It is
> within this mi.lieu that this analysis of the phenomenon
known as Harlem Prep will take place.

Harlem Prep's basic philosophy is designed
> to counteract negative influences on school per£ormance
> and to explode the myths surrounding the education
> of minority students.                The term "dropout" is rarely
> used when referring to our students, because it is
> an educational jargon that has £ailed to solve an
> educational problem.               The most important element of
> the program is based upon the sincere belief that any
> child, unless brain-damaged, can be taught to function
> intelligently.            Every child has the desire to learn.
> Every child has a God-given potential that can be
> developed.         And, with the exception noted above, every

> child can be taught basic skills if the teacher is
accountable, responsible, and responsive.

Much of the current emphasis in education
> has been on how to change or to improve the performance
> of lower-class children, and to fit them to the various
> requirements of the school system as well as to make
> their passage through these institutions smoother and
> easier.       There is very little awareness of the neces-
> sity of changing the institution to fit the require-
ments of lower-class
<I!>-
children.

Charles Silberman,
talking of the attempt to mold the students, wrote:

Among other reasons, Harlem Preparatory School

The school was chartered by the Board of
> Regents on behalf of the New York State Department
> of Education on July 28, 1967.                     The outline of the
> school's objective is included in the charter:

> To establish, conduct, operate, and maintain
> a non-sectarian, private college preparatory
> school for boys and girls between the ages
> of 17 and 21 who have dropped out of school,
> or who are about to drop out of school, and
> who, in the opinion of the administration
> of the school, can be motivated to complete
> a secondary education, to provide such edu-
> cation for such boys and girls, and to
> develop a liaison with a number of colleges
> willing and eager to accept such graduates;
> and to provide, when feasible, tutorial and
> remedial instruction on the premises for
> younger children who need not be enrolled
> in the formal program.

Harlem Prep was originally conceived to provide
creative educational experiences for some of the
70,000 dropouts residing in the ghetto areas of the
city.

A concomitant goal was for Harlem Prep to
> develop into a model of creative educational activi-
ties for other schools.                 Through its innovative edu-

cational system, it would place the dropout in col-
> leges and universities.                 By doing so, a major impact
> would be made on the New York City Board of Education

to emulate Harlem Prep's successful program. 2

Since there was no high school in Central
> Harlem, 3 the school was also to stand as an educa-
> tional beacon within the community demonstrating to
> the community and to the nation that minority youth
> did, in fact, possess the intellectual capacity and
> strong motivation to enter and complete a college
> education.         To a considerable degree, this purpose,
> directed into an action theory, has been achieved.
> Within the period of six academic years, 641 young
> men and women have completed the courses at Harlem
> Prep, received academic diplomas, and have been placed
> in over two hundred colleges and universities throughout
> the nation.         Those who after a few years of studies
> are not accepted by any colleges are encouraged and
helped to find other alternatives, including receiving

skill training.

3According to the 1964 HARYOU document, "the
> boundaries of Central Harlem may be described as llOth
> Street on the south, Third Avenue on the east, the
> Harlem River on the northeast, and the parks bordering
> St. Nicholas, Morningside, and Manhattan Avenues on
> the west • • • . The community crowds 232,792 people
> within its three and one-half square mile area. This
> represents over 100 people per acre. Given the fact
> that 94% of its population are Negro, it is not sur-
> prising that Harlem is frequently called a ghetto
> • • • " ( p • 2 and p • 8) •

The related goals which the school seeks to
> implement vigorously are:                 academic preparation of
> students, personal and social responsibility given
> to the students for their own learning and lives,
> and a commitment on the part of the institution to
> help the students get admitted to colleges and receive
> financial help.          This last purpose is very important be-
> cause nearly all the students come from families with low
> income, and in many cases have no means of financial sup-
port whatsoever to complete their education.

The other primary purposes of the school are:
> to bring about institutional changes within the college
> community so that the .former dropout will be admitted
> to these universities; to develop methods of education
> that can serve as models for other alternative schools;
> and to stimulate public schools to change so as to be
> more effective in educating inner city young people.
The means to achieve these primary goals are:                             a) to

individualize educational materials so that each
> student can progress in proportion to his own ability,
> achievement, interest, and needs; b) to employ teachers
> who possess the necessary academic qualifications,
> but, who also possess the attributes of empathy,
> kindness, and service to these young people; c) to
> involve students, parents, and the community in the

> major decision making of the school; d) to develop
> a philosophy of education that would enhance the
academic, psychological, and social development of

> the students and instructors at the Prep; and e) to
> seek external evaluation and make use of this informa-
tion as input for internal changes.

When, however, did this begin? In 1966, Dr.

> Eugene Callender, 4 pastor of Harlem's Church of the
> Master, conceived a new educational approach designed
> to bring alienated youngsters into an educational
> process radically different from the one that had
> not worked for them.               The program consisted of street
> academies and the Academy of Transition.                          The street
> academies were located in store fronts, primarily
> in Harlem, but also in the Bronx, the lower East
> Side, and Brooklyn.              They were to serve as induction
> centers (informal settings) in which young men and
> women were given basic remedial instruction where
> they were freed from the traditional stigmatization
> of established institutions.                   A major factor was the

> "street workers," who were similar to guidance coun-
> selors but utilized the psychology and language of
the street to meet the needs of the students.

In September 1966, Michael Guerriero stressed
> the positive potential of ghetto adolescents and set
·forth the premise that             11

. about seventy percent
> of the teenagers who live on the streets of our de-
> pressed areas, many of them high school dropouts,
> could go on to junior colleges or colleges, if given
> quality educational opportunities and motivational
> support                  "   He expressed the belief that the
> means of reaching such adolescents was the "street
worker" as       11

the very heart of the Urban League program,
who attempts to establish positive relations with the
> adolescents, lives right in the same neighborhood,
and is, literally, always available for support. 115

The street academy was intended to provide
> an atmosphere of genuine and open acceptance based
> on respect and understanding.                    It was meant to break
the cycle of hopelessness and failure of the adoles-

cents of Harlem.             It was meant to help the students
to build leadership qualities and to raise their

> aspiration levels, so they could become more effective
> in meeting life's problems in the community.                           It tried
> to provide improved teaching techniques, curriculum,
> and enriched educational services, in addition to a host
> of other services crucial to survival in the ghetto, i.e.,
> housing, legal aid, heal th care, drug rehabilitation ser-
> vices, and employment. As the program developed, various
> large corporations were to assume support for the academies
at an annual cost of $50,000 each.

The Academy of Transition, the next step,
> prepared the students for entry into a formal learning
> situation.         The third step, a prep school to be fol-
> lowed by college as the ultimate goal, was suggested
by Dr. Callender, when he said that the aim was to

"set up a competitive school system to expose the
> deficiencies in the public school system by equipping
dropouts for college. 116               Initially, students who

finished the Academy of Transition were sent to Newark
> Preparatory School.              Not only was it too long a dis-
> tance to travel, as things turned out, it was also not
> an enduring arrangement.                 The school closed in 1970

due to financial problems •.

In the meantime, the Urban League was moving
> toward the establishment of its own preparatory school
> in Harlem.         Nor was it alone.             Ml.nhattanville College
> in Purchase, New York, had long been interested in
> education in the inner city, and many of its nuns had
> been working actively in the street academies.                                When
> the Reverend Eugene Callender, then head of the New
> York Urban League, approached Mother Elizabeth J.

McCormack, the president of Manhattanville College,
> a very happy "academic marriage" resulted.                            Harlem
> Prep was born from a joint sponsorship of financial
assistance and educational "know-how."   A Memorandum

of Understanding was drawn up on June 7, 1967. 7 The
> Urban League supplied the funds and Manhattanville
College supplied professional leadership.

Application for a provisional charter was made
> to the Board of Regents of the University of the
> State of New York.              Application subscribers were the
> Reverend Callender, Mother McCormack, Mr. Tyson, Mr.
> Spear, and Mr. Ifil.               A three year provisional charter
was granted on July 28, 1967.

Finally, after much planning, scheduling, and
interviewing, Harlem Prep opened at the 369th Armory

> in October 1967.             On this occasion The New York Urban
> League News wrote:

> With much ado and a lot of hope for a new

> tion possible for the deprived children of

Dr. Stephen Wright, Chairman of the school's
> Board of Trustees, a former president of Fisk Uni-
> versity and president of the United Negro Fund, said:

> More than anything, the new school symbolizes

The school continued to meet in two rooms
of the Armory for the rest of that year.                          The facility
> was less than ideal.               Dim lighting, poor acoustics,
and cramped quarters all rrade the Armory inadequate.

Faculty, students, and Trustees shared this

Shortly thereafter, Harlem Prep began to

> apart from the New York Urban League.                        The Board of
> Trustees was increased to twenty-four.                        At its June

> Harlem Prep, in order to continue its educational
> program, started a major effort in the area of fund-
raising.        In their meeting on January 25, 1968, ac-

> cording to their minutes, the Board of Trustees re-
> solved to set up a development committee to raise

> group, called "Committee for Foundation Presentations,"
> chaired by Dr. John Henry Martin, was formed on April
> 13, 1968, for preparing and presenting different pro-
posals to the foundations.

The year 1968-1969, the second year of the
> school's existence, was a year of expansion and con-
> solidation for Harlem Prep.                  More students could be
> accommodated in the new quarters than at the armory,

> and therefore the enrollment increased to 183 stu-
> dents.       Five new faculty members were hired.                       With

> Thus, Harlem Prep was able to offer its students a
curriculum that was unique in New York City schools.

At the beginning of the year, teaching was

> "togetherness" could be maintained if the original
> "all-in-one" appearance of the supermarket was pre-
> served.       The lack of inner walls and the exposure

> of common action within the building was maintained,
> while the interest of the total community and of the
street was enlisted.

It was the hope of the administration and
> the faculty that, as students and teachers worked
together at the common task, exuberance, interest,

concentration, and spontaneity would be heightened.
The visibility of the whole operation would attract

--,,...,p
> support from the entire community.                       The relaxed, un-
> structured classroom situation gave the students more
freedom to explore and discuss their ideas openly.

On October 23, 1968, the Board of Trustees
made some important decisions concerning community

> and student representation on the board.                          The Parents
> Organization and members of the board were asked to
> submit plans to provide for a student-faculty-parents
> group, made up of all the students, faculty members,
> and parents.          This group would formulate the curriculum
> and establish rules and regulations for daily operation
> in the school, and it would recommend three leaders
> of the community-at-large to serve as members of the
> Board of Trustees.             The president of the Student
Organization at the Prep was elected to full member-
ship to the Board of Trustees.

That fall Harlem Prep confronted one of the
> most significant events of the year.                         Prior to Harlem
> Prep's occupation of its new residence, permission
was given to the People's Program (a "grass-root"

community organization) to use the building during
> the summer months.              The group planned to set up an
addicts' rehabilitation center.

As a result of poor communication, no written
> agreements were made.                Consequently, hostility arose
between the two groups.                 The People's Program, exer-

cising its "squatters rights," assumed the authority
but not responsibility for the building.                           In this

capacity they tried to prevent the renovation and
other essential activities from taking place, as well

> as causing much difficulty for many individuals con-
> nected with the Prep.                These actions caused additional
> friction in September when the students, faculty, and·
> staff sought to begin the Fall term.                         Conflicts arising
> between the two groups extended well into the Fall.
> All attempts on the part of the Board of Trustees to
> bring about some calm proved to be fruitless.                              Finally,
> on the 5th of November, the Urban League took over
> full responsibility for the People's Program, ful-
> filling some of their more basic needs.                          This allowed
> Harlem Prep to move into the school without further
difficulty.

The Parents Organization, in the course of
> the second year, became more active in the school's
> program, more united in its action and more aware
> of its role in the over-all work of Harlem Prep.                               A
> significant part of its activities was the organization
> of an adult education program, operating in the building
> four nights every week during the Spring semester.
> More than one hundred adults, including some of the
> parents, were enrolled.                 The volunteer teachers in
> this program, offered a curriculum that varied in its
> subject matter from Swahili and African history to
> stenography, basic English, and mathematics.                            The
adults registered in the evening school were primarily

> did not succeed.            Therefore, despite its educational
success, the program was discontinued.

slightly higher than his l\bth score. 13

14Letter from Senator Jacob Javits to Mr.
McGeorge Bundy, April 6, 1970.

At the level of the national government, the

> was to admit students who would not normally be ad-
mitted to Harlem Prep and provide them with a program

> of compensatory education which would enable them
> to internalize standards of excellence and/or develop
> a positive attitude toward self-achievement.                             Ordi-
> narily, applicants to Harlem Prep must demonstrate
> the ability to read at grade level nine, as measured
> by standardized reading tests.                     For Upward Bound
> students, this requirement was waived.                         Through the
> process of an interview, the school tried to discover
> whether an applicant manifested the explicit desire
> to continue their education and enter college, since
> the objective of the Upward Bound Program at Harlem
> Prep was to place them in two or four year colleges
of their choice.

On the state level, under a bill passed by
> the New York State Legislature for the support of
> non-public schools, the school was entitled to receive
> $35,000.        It had collected $8,286.97, when the New
York Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional.

During this period, ]he Evening Star carried
a front page story on Harlem Prep.                      After covering

The seriousness of the allegations and the

At the special meeting of the Board of Trustees

> the Executive Committee of the Board; and the authori-
> zation to the Chairman of the Investigating Committee
> to retain the services of an independent outside
> attorney, as a special counsel to the Investigating
Committee.

In accordance with the resolutions of the
> Board, an Investigating Committee was created.                                The
> first formal meeting of the Investigating Committee
> took place on November 10, 1970.                      Present at that
> meeting as guests were Parnell Drayton, C.P.A., and
> Oliver Simmons, C.P.A., partners of the accounting
firm of Lucas, Tucker & Co., the school's auditors.

Mr. Drayton reviewed the audit report prepared
> by his firm for the eight months ending April 30,
> 1970. 17 Mr. Drayton pointed out that the audited
> report superseded the unaudited report for the six

17 see APPENDIX         c.

> months ending February 28, 1970, 18 and that the six-
> month report should be disregarded because it had not
> been an audited report and also because it had been
superseded by the April 30th report.

In answer to the questions, Mr. Drayton pointed
> out that the audited report and opinion letter pre-
> pared by his firm for the period ending April 30,
> 1970, amounted to a statement that his firm found
> no evidence of any improprieties, wrong doings, or
> misappropriation of funds in the accounts of the
> school, or in construction contracts or invoices
thereof.

Mr. Drayton also made reference to footnote
> 3 of the audited report of April 30th, and emphasized
> that his firm had seen and compared the invoices for
> each and every check written to the General Contractor
> in connection with the work done on the school building
and found them all in order and properly paid.                                Al-

> though the audit report pointed out that the auditors
> did not find a written contract for each job order
> for work done, they had seen either an invoice or a
bid proposal or a contract for each check issued to

the general contractor during the period ending April

18 see APPENDIX D.

30, 1970.

In reviewing his firm's audit report, Mr.

> Drayton updated footnote 3 to the financial state-
> ments by indicating that, subsequent to the completion
> of that audit report, the auditors had received the
> confirmation which they had requested from the general
> contractor who had done the construction work on the
school building during that eight month period.

The auditing firm of Lucas, Tucker and Company
> strongly recommended to the Investigating Committee
> that, although they had found no evidence of wrong
> doing and no evidence of misappropriation of funds,
> a better system of bookkeeping be maintained for the
accounts of the school, a recommendation which the
Investigating         .Co~mittee     adopted.

At the conclusion of this meeting, the In-
> vestigating Committee unanimously voted to invite
> the headmaster's secretary, the General Contractor,
> and Mr. Edward Carpenter to attend the next committee
> meeting which was scheduled for Monday, November 16,
1970.

On Sunday, November 15, the Investigating
> Committee retained the services of William S. Ellis,
> of the firm of Ellis, Paterson, Springfellow, Patton
> and Leibowitz, as independent counsel to the

Investigating Committee.

In preparation for the meeting of November 16,
> the services of a court reporter were retained to
> take a verbatim transcript of all proceedings at the
> meeting.        At this meeting, besides the regular com-
> mittee members, William S. Ellis, Edward Carpenter,
> Frederick Hayes, Attorney to Mr. Carpenter, and Eric
> Witt, Accountant to Mr. Carpenter, were present.                             Prior
> to the meeting, Mr. Ellis bad received all the material
> he had requested to become familiarized with the work
> of the Investigating Committee and the nature of its
investigation.

Mr. Ellis told the committee that he had
> studied all the records and spoken to the headmaster's
> secretary who, at that time, indicated that she could
> not attend the meeting of the Investigating Committee
> on November 16.            Mr. Ellis further reported that he
> had invited her to attend a meeting at some later
> date but that she had indicated she did not think
she could attend.

After detailed discussion, the Investigating
> Committee concluded that, due to the refusal of the
> secretary to attend the meeting on November 16, or
> to make any other appointments to meet with the Com-
> mittee, and her refusal to answer the letter of inquiry,

> and that in view of the affirmative findings by the
> auditors, as stated at the November 10 meeting, no
> further investigation should be made into the specific
> allegations made by the secretary.                       The committee
> then invited the headmaster to make whatever state-
ment he might wish to make under the circumstances.

The headmaster began by introducing his ac-
> countant, Mr. Eric Witt, who reported that he had
> just completed a series of conferences with the In-
> ternal Revenue Service as to the tax returns of Mr.
> Carpenter for.the year 1969 which, audited by the
> Internal Revenue Service, had been the result of a
> spot check by the Internal Revenue Service, and which
was in no way related to the inquiry of the Investi-

> gating Committee.             Mr. Witt further indicated that the
> financial affairs of the Carpenters were such that
> it was necessary for them to take out a second mort-
> gage on their home in order to complete certain con-
> struction work and renovations on their home.                             Under
> these circumstances it was hardly likely that Mr.
carpenter had used school funds for himself.

During his own statement, the headmaster
> observed that it was true that the renovation work
> done on the basement of the school, during the period
> ending April 30, had exceeded the amount authorized

in the budget which he had understood to be $60,000.
The actual work on the basement renovation project

during that time period had amounted to $188,166,
> and he explained his reasons why he had exceeded the
> amount authorized in the budget, as follows:

It was my decision along with the Board
> of Trustees' permission to renovate the
basement to the tune of $60,000 • • • •

If there is one thing I can be accused

> And, also I would say I would make the same
decision to renovate the basement again.
...

Right or wrong, this was my decision and

For the school year of 1971-72, beginning
September 1971, Harlem Prep admitted 485 students.

There were 160 graduates in June and the

> gratulation statement appearing in the June 7 issue
of The New York Times on the behalf of EXXON read:

> This morning, on !25th Street and Seventh

> request in 1968.            With the support of Daniel Moynihan
> and Lee Du Bridge, more attempts were made, but were

but Harlem Prep has not received any contract from
them, except Upward Bound Program.

During the fall of 1971, the school submitted
thirty-three different proposals to various govern-

.
men t agencies. 26 There was extensive correspondence

> based on those proposals of which eventually two were
> approved.         The approved programs are in the area of

even though the proper contacts were made and the
> good will had been there.                  The difficulty is that
> there are complicated procedures that one must follow
carefully before any governmental grants are offered.

In July 1972, Judge Robert Mangum and the
> school administrators visited the offices of Health,
> Education, and Welfare.                The purpose was to obtain
> some action on the thirty-three proposals previously
> sent to Dr. Sidney Marland; to meet with the then
> Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and
> Welfare, Mr. Elliott Richardson and his assistant,
> Mr. Martial Moriarty; to enlist the higher level de-
> cision making for expediting Federal assistance to
> the school; and to obtain information about other
> possible funding sources in the Federal government.
> Unknown to the group, Mr. Moriarty had prepared an
> itinerary for them to visit officers in the Department
> of Health, Education, and Welfare.                      Under the Ele-
> mentary and Secondary Education Act:                        Title 1, they
> were referred to Mr. Lee Pierson, Assistant United
> States Commissioner of Education.                      He informed them
> that by the law, the school was entitled to receive
> some funds from this Act.                 However, the administrative
> procedure for disbursement of funds provides that
> Federal funds be sent to designated city or state

> receiving agencies.              In the case of New York City,
> the receiving agency is the Board of Education.                              The
> Board of Education disburses these funds to districts
> within the city.            Harlem Prep is a part of District
> 6.    However, if it were to receive funds from the
> District under the formula allotted to non-public
> schools, it would get much less money than if funds
> came directly from the Central Board of Education.
> Mr. Pierson assigned Washington's representative in
> New York, Mr. Gene Satin, to expedite a meeting with
> representatives from Chancellor Harvey Scribner's of-
> fice.     A meeting took place on August 3 with Dr. Jack
Woodbury, which led to the approval of a few services
to Harlem Prep students.

The representatives of the Prep were also
> instructed to send proposals to Mr. Howard A. Matthews,
> Director of the Division of Manpower Development and
> Training, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
> Ten separate proposals, totaling $845,247 were sent.
> The school has since received assurance that two of
> our vocational training proposals will be accepted

> any funds, it will have to provide these programs,
> even though Harlem Prep's primary purpose has been
> to prepare students for college entry.                         The support

of more than ten senators and congressmen and governors

proposals, but the bureaucrats do not react easily.

The financial crisis of this school year
reached its peak in December, 1972.                       In the Board
meeting that took place then, it was decided that

the school had to begin a phaseout.                       If, during the
> phaseout, some aid was received, the school could
> remain open until June, to send perhaps its last
> group of graduates to college.                     Media and corporations
> were informed of the decisions and almost twenty in-
terviews with the press were arranged. 28

The New York Post, under the heading "School
for Dropouts May Have to Dropout," reported:

> In an effort to keep classes operating
> until June for the 600 students attending
> the school, the Headmaster has asked his
> administrative staff and his twenty-five
> faculty members to take a ten percent salary
> cut. He says he will be forced to release
nine instructors next month.

On this very uncertain note the school year
ended in June 1973, and 171 students were graduated

Harlem Prep has existed since 1967 as an
> independent corporation, primarily supported by private

> panies, and individuals to support programs to aid
> the disadvantaged has diminished in terms of dollar

but have reduced the nwnber of projects.

In trying to secure permanent financial support,
the school has explored other possibilities.                            One
was voluntary donation by the students (charging

> tuition is forbidden in the school's charter).                                This
> is clearly not a viable alternative, because private
> schools that charge tuition cannot remain open solely
on this basis.            In addition, the economic circumstances

> of most of the students at the Prep prevent them from
contributing in any substantial amount.

Since Harlem Prep has been open only since
1967, an avenue of support used by private schools,

the contributions of alumni, is not available.

Another possibility was the Harlem community.
Dr. Carpenter, on one occasion, said:

> There are many headaches in maintaining an
> alternative school system. Strangely enough,
> none of these problems surrounds the attitudes,
> abilities, or "disciplines" of the students.
> The problem is money. Commerce, industry,
> and funding agencies who become caught up
> in the glamor of a new organism will provide
> initial sums of money. However, as the
> system thrives and disproves the aforemen-
> tioned myths, former contributors draw back
> and money, the life blood of the organism,
> dries up. It is my sincere belief that if
> alternative schools like Harlem Prep are to
> exist, primary support will have to come
> from the community. We have demonstrated
> that through concerted efforts, churches,
> serving our spiritual needs, can be developed
> and maintained. A new thrust toward develop-
> ing and maintaining community schools,
> reflecting community needs, must receive the
> same priority.33

> However, the Harlem community has in fact not aided
the school substantially.

Administrators and the Board of Trustees have
> investigated other alternatives:                      the possibility of
> obtaining state aid and local tax levy funds, though
> both, collectively, spell out "control."

33Harlem Preparatory School Record, Statement
by Edward F. Carpenter, June 6, 1971.

There have been two attempts, so far, to
> arrange for some support from the City University.
> The first occasion was a discussion with CUNY authori-

and the Board of Education of the City of New York.

determined by the Board's regulations. 34

CHAPTER                 III

AN ACADEMIC PI.AN FOR HARLEM PREP

Harlem Preparatory School, while remarkable
> and unique as an institution, is still largely experi-
> mental and faces perplexing problems.                         Perhaps the
> most important of these problems is what happens to
> the tremendous number of dropouts who do not receive
> the general education necessary to live an adequate
> life in today's world and contribute to the demands
> of society.         How can this problem be eliminated?
> Adequate solutions have not yet been devised which
> can be applied to large numbers of these students.
> For this reason experimentation must continue, and
> changes in the school's administrat·ive organization
and curriculum should be welcome.

The present curriculum of the school centers
> on English and mathematics.                   To prepare students for
> the late-twentieth-century society calls for a new
> concept in education.               In the case of Harlem Prep,
> this demand has been reenforced by the particular
> needs of the student body.                  Those who have left the
traditional high schools have already rejected both

the inflexible approach to education and the conven-

tional curriculum.             Therefore, the students are pro-
> vided with opportunities to develop and progress
> according to their individual capacities for learning.
> A social environment is created in which students,
> with the advice and help of teachers who are also
> co-learners, assume the responsibility for their own
> education.         In essence, the educational objective
> is also focused on providing the framework for enabling
> each student to become a confident, independent indi-
> vidual.       'l'his is done through a flexible arrangement
> of class structure in which individually prescribed
> instruction can be given on a one-to-one basis or in
> small groups, according to the needs of students and
the judgment of the teachers.

The development of curriculum has been used
> on occasion to provide in-service training for teachers
> and administrators.              When the method and teaching
> techniques for the implementation of curriculum were
> discussed, teachers often .discovered a new dimension
> of their role, as well as that of the teaching-learning
> processes.         Fa.ch year students and teachers have
> developed a fresh school plan as to course offering
> and content, which has resulted in the renewal of
> teacher interest in their work and created a pressure

> that would force the teachers to seek information
> outside and above the accepted school norms.                            The
> new curriculum, thus, has served as a vehicle for
> the teachers' instructional and personal growth.                              It
> has given the staff a better opportunity to observe
> and study the youngster in a highly motivating cli-
> mate.      This participation has stimulated the teachers
> to guide rather than indoctrinate.                      At the same time
> the problems of the students have posed a constant
> challenge to the teachers and have forced them to
> develop better perception of individual personality
> and social interaction.                 In the midst of this Harlem
Prep's curriculum has remained in accord with its

commitment to qualify all its students for college
> entrance.         Students and teachers were well acquainted
with this single goal while devising the curriculum.

The teachers at Harlem Prep have not been
> concerned with regulating the students' life styles
> or approaches to learning.                   The school's main objec-
> tive is to help the students channel their energies
> into constructive activities leading to attainment
> of their educational goals.                   Harlem Prep has been
> successfully capitalizing on its students' diverse
> learning styles by encouraging their free and pro-
> ductive development in an unstructured learning en-
> vironment.

Along with the two major subjects in the
> school, English and math, the students have been
> able to take whatever courses they wanted.                           They had
> a wide range from which to choose.                       Some of the school's
> courses at first glance seem largely technical and
> terminal, e.g., a computer course set up by IBM and
> several courses in media.                  But here also the ultimate
> goal has been professional -competence.                        In a number
> of cases students have been able to take courses that
> most likely they would not have taken until they got
> to college had they attended the average high school,
> e.g., sociology, anthropology, philosophy, African
> studies, calculus.             Although many of these courses
> are college type courses, Prep has been successful
in teaching them in a high school curriculum.

The college preparatory objectives of the
> Prep have dominated the school's programs to the
> point of virtually eliminating planning for those
> who aim for a non-college high school training.                              In
> some instances, students have been placed in difficult
> positions because the whole program has been geared
> to college preparation.                It is suggested now that in
addition to the college preparation program, a voca-

> tional program should be devised to meet the needs
> of some drop-outs.

Much controversy will arise over how the
> school can best meet the students' educational needs.

This will be difficult to resolve within the school
and outside since the supporters for a college prepa-

> ratory type of educational program are ardent in
their beliefs and arguments.

The lives of thousands of American youths are
> warped each year because the traditional offerings
> and requirements for high school graduation are un-
> realistic.          They do not serve the best interests of
> the entire school population.                    Many young men and
> women find that the school curriculum in which they
> are enrolled is dull and uninteresting.                          Some find
> that the general academic subject offerings are too
> difficult.          Still these students are expected to
> compete with others in this too-difficult level of
achievement and too lengthy educational program.

No human being can experience failure after
> failure for years and remain a well-adjusted individual.
> The students should have the opportunity to experience
> success.        This success will come by improvement in
> their concept of personal worth, for when a person's
opinion of himself improves, so does his behavior.

From its inception, the school has offered
high school education and college preparation.                                The

> preposal suggests that the school offer "career"
> programs in a variety of occupational areas, with
> particular emphasis on health and ecology, preparing
> students for entry into technical and semi-professional
positions after certain periods of training.

These two categories of               curriculum~college

> preparation and vocational                 training~should           not be
> discrete and isolated endeavors in the school.                                In
> the first place, it may be observed that students
> in both kinds of programs often share similar goals:
> both are engaged in "career" education.                         Students
> enrolled in college preparatory programs are usually
> preparing for professional fields such as teaching,
> law, business administration, and the like, where
> higher education is required.                    For these students,
> career education begins at Harlem Prep, and will
> continue in four-year colleges or universities.                               But
> students preparing for positions in technical and
> semi-professional fields may complete all their formal
"career" education at Harlem Prep.

In the second place, it should be noted that
all students enrolled in technical programs will be

> required to complete a minimum number of academic
> courses not directly related to their area of spe-
> cialization.          In this sense, faculty members in the

> academic areas will serve the entire student enroll-
ment and provide to all students the humanizing effects

traditionally identified with the academic courses.
There will be enough mobility in the plan so that

students can transfer from one area to another with
relative ease.

A third aspect of the relationship between
> the academic and the technical programs must be noted.
> As knowledge accumulates with breath-taking rapidity,
> and as the applications of this new knowledge yield
> vastly accelerated technological changes ranging
> through all phases of human life, education must
> prepare students to live and work in the world of
> the future.          Occupational education which merely
> prepares students for t-0day 1 s jobs will not enable
> them to adjust as their jobs change; today's skills
> will make tomorrow's technologically unemployed.
> Hence, our program of occupational education, while
> developing immediately usable job skills, must also
> teach students how to learn, must equip them with
> the basic knowledge of mathematics and science, with
> communication abilities, and with behavioral science
> concepts which will enable them to grow, to develop,
> and to change as the world about them changes.                                There
> must be close integration between the liberal arts

and sciences, and the technical programs.

This last point suggests an answer to a ques-
> tion which is sometimes raised as to whether Harlem
> Prep or other alternative schools are the appropriate
> place for technical or career programs.                          Should not
> the vocational high schools or industry provide this
> technical training?              If career programs are to be
> built upon a solid core of academic courses, as seems
> to be essential, then such programs should be operated
by an institution similar to Harlem Prep, which can

offer programs integrating general academic education
with technical training in job skills.

At the same time, a program like this can
> broaden the role of Harlem Prep.                      It will provide
> students greater opportunity for choice and open up
> options in a system that previously has been fairly
> prescriptive and tracked.                  It will also provide an
> opportunity for students of diverse backgrounds and
> abilities to come together for at least one year of
> common education with the opportunity to explore their
> own unique interests and abilities through an expanded
> curriculum and co-curriculum.                    The ultimate goals
> are that the new plan would open equal educational
> opportunity for all and that students would be better
> prepared to choose vocational goals.

This is a time when the dream of a college
> education for as many as possible still dominates
> the imagination of the poor American inner-cities.
> In point of fact, however, more than 80 per cent of
> the jobs available in this past decade have not re-
> quired a college education.                   Moreover, employment
> problems of the last few years have involved an im-
> balance~not          enough skilled workers in some fields,
> such as health services and ecology, and overtrained
> and consequently underemployed workers in others,
> such as teaching and engineering.                      One is also aware
> that due to new technology, some jobs are disappearing
> through automation, while others are being created.
> New kinds of jobs are emerging with the efforts to
> solve some of the major social problems associated
> with housing, health, ecology, and civil rights.                              Many
> of these jobs, while they will require sophisticated
> technical skills, will not require a college education.
> The expanded curriculum will deal with future job
availabilities as well.

It is known that in spite of the many programs
> of the late sixties to provide skills, jobs, and training
> for those unprepared to enter the job market, the high
> school drop-out problem is still very much with us.                           In
> many cases, it was not that students were actually unable

> to do the work, but that their needs were not being met
> by the present school curricula.                    The traditional high
> school programs have forced students to choose early
> between academic and vocational education, with the
> result tba t the vocational students have been the ones
> given a direct exploratory experience.                       Unfortunately,
> however, this has been looked upon as something to do if
one cannot handle the academic curriculum.

This walling-off of the employment-bound from
the college-bound has resulted in an unfortunate
·dichotomy in which work is something for the employment-

> bound while college-bound students defer thinking in
> vocational terms as long as possible.                        The walling-
> off has also perpetuated a curriculum in which academic
> subjects and vocational subjects have been in their
> own boxes.         It has caused a fragmented curriculum
> which bas not capitalized on possible ways of inte-
> grating academic and vocational subjects to make
> schools more relevant to the present goals, future
plans, and preferred life styles of students.

There is a special dilemma now in that, at
a time when many minority persons have gained access

> to a college education, the college diploma is no
> longer unquestionably the key to success.                          At the
> same time, there is concern among blacks and other

> minorities that career education will attempt to
> train their youngsters for vocational and technical
> careers.       Disadvantaged students have suffered most
> from the school's unwillingness to accept responsi-
> bility for career preparation, from the heavily verbal
> academic curriculum which often has not met their
needs, from the unfortunate perception of vocational

education as a dumping ground for the problem students
> rather than as a positive, viable option which can
> open up opportunities.                The schools have continued

~

in an integrated curriculum offers some promises.

Outline of the Modified Plan

The Harlem Prep's Board of Trustees should
> authorize the establishment of the vocational training
> program along with the college preparatory program.

These two programs would provide career-education

> curriculums designed to meet the needs of former
> dropouts and would lead, in the two suggested areas
of health and environment, to a degree.

In the health area, since September of 1971,
> the Harlem Hospital Physician's Associate Program
> has been run as an adjunct to Antioch College.                                They
> began their courses at Harlem Prep with eleven stu-
> dents; this was later increased to twenty-five indi-
> viduals.        These students, after two years of extensive
> training, receive a baccalaureate degree and are able
> to work as assistants to doctors in the hospital or
> in private offices.              Under the new plan the number
of students in this program will increase substantially.

In the environmental program, based on the
> grants already received, we could make arrangements
> with some college or university to issue an associate
> degree.       The students who are going to regular four-
> year colleges will continue to receive the regular
high school academic diploma.

The following chart will graphically demon-
strate the suggested educational plan.

Administration

Responsibility of the Administration of the
School:

1.     Policy making and planning.                  The school
> shall provide a staff adequate to administer, super-
> vise, and evaluate the academic and vocational pro-
> grams, services, and activities under the Board of
> Trustees' guidelines.               The administration will seek
> to assure quality in all programs and at the same
> time will plan the programs to be realistic in terms
> of actual or anticipated employment opportunities
and college requirements.

2.     Physical Facility.             The Headmaster of
> the school will be charged with the responsibility
of developing with local schools and industry, a

cooperative policy covering all aspects of the joint
> use of facilities, such as laboratories, hospital
equipment, and supplies.

3.    Advisory Committees.               The advice and
> consent of the community, students, and faculty will
> be used in the development of a relevant curriculum.

Instructional Program

The major purpose of the school curriculum
must be to make appropriate academic and occupational

> training opportunities of high quality readily accessi-
> ble to all students in the community.                        The following
levels of instruction should be provided:

> 1.     Preparatory instruction
> 2.     Supplementary academic courses
> 3.     Occupational offerings
> 4.     Extensive practical experience.

Veterans

In previous years Harlem Prep has enrolled
> a large number of veterans.                   Veterans' educational
> benefits became available to Harlem Prep in 1971.
> It is the school's responsibility to continue to
> provide a sound educational program to these indi-
> viduals.          Those veterans who worked as medics in the
> armed forces should be encouraged to enter the health
> training program.

Degree Requirements

Among the minimum requirement for any degree
> from Harlem Prep is the satisfactory completion of
the following course work:

1.    Minimum of one to two years of successful
study at the school.

2.    Completion of six courses of study each
term.

3.    Vocational students must complete voca-
> tional courses, with extensive practical experience
either in hospitals or in industry.

4.    College-oriented students must be accepted
> by a university prior to issuance of a diploma by
Harlem Prep.

5.    Faculty approval must be given for each
graduate.

Accreditation

The school academic program is already ap-
> proved by the .State Education Department.                          The occu-
> pational training division should also apply for
> accreditation.

Admission

A general admissions policy of Harlem Prep
> should be to select students who have a reasonable
> probability of succeeding in either of the two programs
> and for whom the programs seem to be suitable.                                In
> order to make final selection of students and to
> help them to decide if the program meets their needs,
> it will be necessary to identify specific predictors.

for prospective students and to give complete and
accurate information about the programs.

No admissions procedure can identify with
> complete accuracy which applicants will benefit from
> the program.         However, from past experience the school
> has found two types of data about students to be fairly
> accurate indicators of the student's probability of
> success in the school.                The first deals with concrete
> facts about the student's life situation, including
> his skill level and likely access to financial support.
> The second kind of data concerns his motivation to
> achieve the goals of the program.                      For example, a
> student with a low academic level but with high moti-
> vation to achieve will probably benefit from Harlem
> Prep as much as a student with a higher ability but
less motivation.

Admission test scores and application forms
> provide pertinent data about prospective students,
> but they are not adequate to present a complete per-
> spective.        Candidates for admission to the school are
> more likely to reveal supplementary detail about them-
> selves in a warm, personal interview than on a written
> test or form.          A personal interview also provides an
> opportunity for the interviewer to assess the candi-
date's degree of motivation.

In the past the number of applicants to Harlem
Prep has been much greater than the school's capacity.

> If this trend continues admission to the program could
> be limited to students who live in the designated
> poverty neighborhoods, pass the Metropolitan Achieve-
> ment Tests at grade level nine, and show an interest
> in and potential for a college education or vocational
training.

Admission to the school carries with it rights
and responsibilities.                Students who do not show progress

> or continued interest should not be allowed to con-
> tinue in the program.               In other words continued atten-
dance in the program should be conditional on a satis-

factory level of performance.

Orientation

All the incoming students would be required
to participate in at least three weeks of orientation.

The success or failure of an educational
> project largely depends upon what occurs during the
> orientation period.              The crucial first impression
> is worth all the energy, planning, and long prepara-
> tion.      As a positive element of the new program
> suggested here, orientation can result in a realistic
> sharing of expectations between staff and students,
> and in a sense of joint effort over the entire school
> period.

The diagnostic assessment of each student's
> abilities as they relate to the program objectives
> is a primary function of orientation.                        The assessment
> should be designed to give the staff the most com-
> plete picture pos.sible of those abilities upon which
> the program objectives depend.                    The purpose of this
assessment should be made clear to the students.                              Any

> rigorous program designed for completion in a year
> or two      demands commitment, as well as academic
ability, from the             students.         It is necessary for

the staff to define the level of required commitment
> and to use the orientation period to                          determine
whether the project can elicit this level from each

> student.       Standards in attendance and participation
> for the whole program should be set quite high and
emphasized.

No matter how thoroughly a project is described
> to prospective students, it cannot be assumed that
> students fully understand the project until they are
> actually attending classes.                   By demonstrating the
> scope and requirements of the program during orien-
> tation, each student is given time to evaluate the
> program and has the option to withdraw from the program
> if it does not seem to meet his needs.                         Such critical
> judgments by the students should be encouraged during
> orientation.

Another important aspect of the orientation
> is to establish an honest and direct relationship
> between teachers and students.                    Everybody involved
> benefits from a clarification of the individual re-
> sponsibilities which constitute an educational ex-
perience.

The most effective part of the orientation
> period will be that part which provides some actual
> instruction in the basic skills of mathematics and
> language usage.           To remain consistent with the high
> expectation for the students, it is important this
> instruction be approached as a review of skills and
> not as an introduction to those skills.                         Class par-
> ticipation and homework during this period produces
additional material for the initial assessment pro-

> cedure.       Textbooks are not practical during orientation
> for several reasons.              First, most courses only meet
> a few times during orientation, and thus there is not
> time for adequate reference and use of a text.                                Fur-
> thermore, the content of the orientation course is
very specific and the material in no single textbook

is compressed enough for this short period of only
three weeks.

The student who successfully completes the
orientation part has opened the door to several

> options.          The particular course he can follow should
> be selected with the assistance of teachers.                             The
bases for this selection should be the following:

1.    The student feels he is potentially quali-
fied for college work.

2.    The student has an employable skill, which
further training will strengthen.

> 3.    Teachers' recommendations.

4.    The students who decide to go to college
> must have demonstrated the ability to do college work.
> They must be proficient in verbal and writing skills,
> as well as in mathematical concepts.

Tutoring Center

One of the main features of the new program
> will be the establishment of a tutoring center.                              Mass
> educational systems, too frequently, do not meet the
> needs of people as individuals.                     Their design is
> geared toward the skill abilities and educational
> development of groups and is based upon national
> norms.      A tutoring center is a place where individual-
> ized instruction is the adopted approach and self-
learning is the major activity.

Individualized instruction provides a student
with the opportunities, methods, and material to help

> him teach himself to learn within a structured setting.
> An instructor or a fellow student is available to
> guide him on a one-to-one basis as needed, but the
> student will be required to make his own responses.
> He will actively participate in his owi1 learning and
> progressively take on increasing responsibility for
his own personal growth.

The natural extension of individualized in-
> struction will be independent study in which the
> student applies learned self-teaching skills to his
> everyday life and academic and vocational experiences.
> The ability to do independent study will be a high
> priority goal, because structured education that
> directs learning is only a temporary situation in
> the lives of the students.                  Therefore, students should
> be equipped to assume full responsibility for their
own personal growth.

The tutoring center will not simply be a
> place for remedial work.                  Since any group of students
> exhibits a          variety of skill weaknesses and educa-
> tional strengths, a               tutoring center that primarily
> concentrates on improving weak areas reduces its
> potential uses.             Instead,       it should address itself
> to all of the student's needs, including the slow
> and fast learner, the poor and good-to-excellent
> reader.

Although the center would be an independent
> entity, its use should be correlated with the rest
> of the curriculum.              Therefore, all staff members will
> have some degree of responsibility and participation
> in its operation.

Teaching and Counseling Staff

The Headmaster of Harlem Prep will have the
> final responsibility for acquiring a total staff that
> will work together and with students smoothly and
> efficiently.          Obtaining a          competent staff involves
> more than selecting people who have professional
> credentials.          It is important that teachers in the
> school understand and be committed to the program
> goals.       Therefore,        in order to avoid hiring teachers
> who are unlikely to adapt to the school environment,
> it is necessary to give applicants extensive informa-
> tion about the program's policy and operation.                               Ar-
> ranging interviews for teacher applicants with a
> teacher in the same subject area in which they are
> applying, as well as a                few students, is helpful to
> round out the selection process and assess the appli-
> cant's suitability for the school and vice versa.

From past experience, the Harlem Prep adminis-
> trators have found that the teachers who are most
> successful in the program are those who have a com-
> mitment to the student's acquisition of specific aca-
> demic development and a high but feasible expectation
> of student performance.                Furthermore, it is necessary
> for prospective teachers to have enough self-confidence
> to accept challenges from the students and enough
> flexibility to deal with the changing demands of
the program.

The inherent pressures and demands of any
> serious educational program generate a need for sup-
> portive services which are usually provided by pro-
> fessionally trained guidance counselors.                          Unfortu-
> nately it is within these traditional educational
> structures that most Harlem Prep students have ex-
> perienced a          sense of inadequacy and academic fail-
> ure.      The new program will require an innovative
> approach to counseling and strong supportive ser-
> vices.

University Based Projects

The responsibility of the participating uni-
versities in the two vocational programs should be

> to provide technical and personnel resources and
> leadership for strengthening the educational advance-
> ment of the students.               Technical assistance should
> be given in preparing a suitable curriculum and a
> viable academic program to meet the needs of the
participants.           Similarly, college faculty, adva'i1ced

graduate students, teacher corps, teacher trainees,
researchers, and university-based specialists should

> be provided to work with the school programs.                               The
> college facilities, such as library, language labora-
> tory, reading laboratory, and testing services, should
> be available for the use of the students.                           Moreover,
> those students who have the academic preparation
> should have an opportunity to take courses in the
> universities for credit.                 Furthermore, the universities
> should seek funds and should sponsor programs designed
> to improve various aspects of the school and they
> should cooperate in developing an appropriate training
> program for the staff.

Conclusion

For the past six years the school has been
> successful in fulfilling the educational needs of
> many young people in the community along the line

> of accreditation for college entrance.                         Now it re-
> alizes the need for training students in technical
> services as well as academic endeavors.                          Environmental
> awareness and health programs are pertinent subject
> areas that can be offered to prepare students to meet
community needs.

For the next decade, the organization, ad-
> ministration, and curriculum of Harlem Prep should
> attempt to be an open, cycle-breaking system.                               The
> most constructive way of breaking the vicious cycle
> of welfarism, the continuous failure of minorities,
> and the high rate of crime is to attempt to break
> the cycle that they are in.                  Through a program of
> college preparation and vocational training, with
> the constant opportunity for students to move from
> one of these to             the other, Harlem Prep-and other
> alternative schools-can break this cycle and meet
the broad needs of the community which it serves.

> The other anticipated program benefits are:
> 1.     The new program, as conceived in the
> modified plan, will not overshadow the main respon-
> sibility of preparing the students for a higher edu-
> cation.       Instead, this program will be supplementary
and complementary in nature.                    Presence of university

faculty and other qualified staff, increased counseling

> facilities, access to the university resources, addi-
> tional vocational courses, and increased budgetary
> allocations would have positive effects on the school's
entire academic program

2.    Using the program as an instrument of
change, new training for teachers could be instituted,
> and within the framework of such an innovative program
> a better organization of the entire staff could be
made.

3.    More teachers and more students can be
brought into the main thrust of the program.

4.    By involving the             students in various
> aspects of the program planning and development,
> the project will result in their maximum partici-
> pation.       Fewer studel!.ts are likely to drop out of
the school.

5.    The community and parents can participate
more effectively in the vocational program.

6.    Harlem Prep_ has been a symbol of success
> in Harlem and indeed in all black communities.                              The
> school should continue to prove that the myths of
> conflict between white teachers and black students,
> the inability of minority students to learn, the
> disinterest of children and their parents in educa-
> tion, the community's incapability to work with school

> administrators, and finally the idea that the drop-
> out will find himself on the welfare rolls are all
> untrue and should be set aside. 1

CHAPTER                IV

A DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR HARLEM PREP

Harlem Preparatory School has reached a point
> where it either has to plan or perish, and planning
> must not be confining to educational goals only.                              The
> dire financial crisis which confronts it has resulted
> from a lack of long-range financial planning with clear
> objectives and goals.               The planning at this time may
> not save Harlem Prep as it is presently organized,
> but even if the school joins the B9ard of Education,
> the funds could be used to pay for the program and
staff members which the Board would not support. 1

Harlem Prep must learn from the experiences
> of industrial firms, merchandising organizations, and
> government agencies, to have long-range projections
> of income and expenditures on which it can base its
future educational program.

Even though the school is not a business
organization, financially it should follow a wise,

As of February 1, 1974, Harlem Prep has been
taken over by the Board of Education.

> pragmatic course of action.                  Our educational respon-
> sibility as well as financial difficulty will grow
> tremendously in.its complexity in the next decade.

To meet these problems Harlem Prep must sharpen its
approach and the long-term planning will help us in

> this area.        Developing its case and planning for the
> future will serve the school as a tool for dealing
> with rapid changes, a way of coping with the unex-
pected.

The plan will provide a guideline, increasing
the chances for corrective action and keeping the

school on course.            This does not mean that the plan
> must solidify the future.                  It will not be a static
> plan, but a continuing, corrective effort which will
> take full possible cognizance of constantly changing
circumstances.

The first step in the direction of the long-
> term plan is the development of our                      ~·         The prepara-
> tion of our case will put the house in order.                             It will
> develop a head of steam for us to devise ways for
> bringing about desirable changes.                      It is not enough to
> say that we are an "alternative school."                          There are
> hundreds of these.             There is little distinction or
> novelty about being a "good" or "excellent" or an
> "outstanding" school.               What is required in developing

> our case is a delineation of the special purpose of
Harlem Prep.

Our job in development of our case is to go
> beyond high-sounding and meaningless phrases and to
> arrive at a clear set of objectives for Harlem Prep.
> The case will pinpoint the place of Harlem Prep in
> society, define its particular setting and orientations.
> It will identify our constituents and students.                                   It
> must treat the unique ways in which the school achieved
> its purpose in the past and what it is proposing for
> the future.         The case should lift the campaign from
> the level of institutional self-perpetuation to that
> of selfless service to the public.

The Case for Harlem Prep

What really is the case for Harlem Prep?                              It
> is, in short, ideas, programs, and policies of Harlem
> Prep, its administration, faculty, students, Board,
and friends, distilled into a manageable document that

> tells a story with a consistent point of view.                                A
> case is not meant to be a straight jacket; a good one
> must be able to adapt and be adapted.                        It may change
at any one time, but it must also give a sense of

> cohesion and direction.                From    it~just       as their thoughts
> went into it--the Board, administration, students,
> faculty, and friends, all Harlem Prep people, must

> take their cue so that the position represented in
> the case statement may become second nature to those
> who are in any way involved with the school.                            At the
> same time, new friends and major donors can become
involved.

> Our case appears as follows:
> 1.    A national need to educate drop-outs and
> other disadvantaged young people has been met in an
> experimental situation.                While it demonstrates that
> some of these young people can be given a college
> preparatory education, it also serves as a catalyst
> for institutional changes in our educational system.
> Public education throughout America has been benefitted
> by it.       The disadvantaged, especially blacks, Puerto
> Ricans, and poor whites are potentially the largest
recipients of Harlem Prep's knowledge and experience.

2.    A regional and local need to bring into
> Central Harlem a high school level teaching facility
> has been met.           The effect is widespread, not only
> dealing with education, but social problems, human
relations, and urban economics.

3.    The clients of Harlem Prep--the student,
> and to an extent his             family~are         receiving a quality
> product as shown by the increasing numbers of appli-
> cants to Harlem Prep, and the school's excellent

retention rate.

4.    The comparatively lower costs for edu-
> cation between Harlem Prep and the city system is a
positive achievement.

5.    The success of Harlem Prep as compared
> with public schools in placing students in college

alternative schools in the country, we should not

setting.

this fact.

Financial Goal for Harlem Prep 1973-1983

$6,000,000

It is not feasible to try to raise endowment

are not needed.             However the nain emphasis should be

> on raising $6,000,000 for operating costs.                           This sum
> can be broken down into an average budget of $500,000
over the following years.

The $6,000,000 goal needs a full documentation
> and break-down, not just by categories within Harlem
> Prep's own needs, but packaged for potential donors.
For example, a teacher's salary certainly may be an

educational need, but if the salary is for a case
> worker in drug rehabilitation, it could well encompass
> not only education, but social work, juvenile delin-
> quency, the veteran, and so on.                      Imaginative approaches
will more often receive positive responses.

Another area worth exploring is a "Harlem
> Prep Share Plan," where one share will be equal to
> the mathematical cost for one student per year.                                If
> 4,000 young men and women attend the school over a
> ten-year period from 1973-1983 at a total cost of
> $6,000,000, then $1,500 will support one student at
> Harlem Prep per year.               As a further example, one block
> of ten IBM stocks at Harlem Prep would come to $15,000
> and that equals a lot of lives for the money.                             As
> an alternative we could ask industries or our friends
> to pay the expenses of Harlem Prep for one day to one
> month at the rate of $1,500 per day.                        The possibilities

for effectively "marketing" Harlem Prep are many.

Categorical federal or state grants, and
> public moneys should be included in itemizing the
> $6,000,000 of expected receipts over the next ten
> years, and a government liaison committee should con-
> centrate on such possibilities.                     However, this is
a point that depends on many other decisions, and

specific allocations of such receipts cannot be under-
taken at this time.

Gift Table

A gift table as it now stands is a guide,

> term possibilities by the institution.                         The donation

The gift table shows that five gifts of $250,000

The last column on the table, prospects, is

Prospects

The prospective donors to Harlem Prep consists
of the following:

> 1.    Past donors
> 2.    Those who have inquired about Harlem Prep
> 3.    Board members
> 4.    New friends

5.     Foundations interested in education, urban
> affairs, disadvantaged youth, social causes, and those
concerned in the New York City area

6.     Businesses and industries, especially
> those having headquarters in New York City or with
major activities in the metropolitan area

7.     Organizations such as labor unions, church
> groups, business and fraternal organizations, and
others

> 8.     The Harlem Community
> 9.    Alumni, faculty, and the parents and
families of students and alumni
10.      State and federal government agencies.

Each of these groups should be researched
> and listed.          A number of logical prospects are the
Astor Foundation, Carnegie Corporation, Besser Foun-

> dation, Danforth Foundation, Ford Foundation, EXXON,
> IBM, Mosler Fund, Meyer Foundation, Mott Foundation,
> Union carbide, Andrew Mellon Foundation, General
> Electric, Consolidated Edison, General Foods, New
York Foundation, Field Foundation, Time Inc., Rocke-

feller Brothers Foundation.                  These suggestions are
> the type of prospects to be pursued because they are
> concerned foundations, New York City corporations,
> and friends of the school.

Time Table

A time table for the school's campaign is
> not outlined here.             At this point, it is not possible
> to be specific, but there are a £ew key elements to
> the time table that can be indicated.                        First of all,
although the program is intended to cover the needs

> for ten years, the active campaign period will be
> conducted .during the "exci i:ement phase" 0£ the first
> two years.        In other words, two years of organized
and intensive campaigning would be required to find
the $6,000,000 for the school.

In suggesting this idea, we recognize the
> possibility that funds at this level may not be avail-
> able until certain things are "proven" by Harlem Prep
> and that some of the goal may be reached only during
> a special follow-up program at a later date.                             There
> is, of course, the other possibility, a happier one,
> that success will be easier to come by than experience
> has shown in similar situations.                      For example, the
initial funding £or Harlem Prep was quite easy.

A development time table should cover not
> only the obvious fund raising activities, but all
> areas of organization.                The time table would also
> include public relations in its traditional sense,
> special publicity, events at the school that are not

> purely internal, the announcement of appointments and
> plans, and generally, anything that would have a posi-
> tive effect for Harlem Prep.

Public Relations

Despite considerable television and newspaper
> coverage, and speaking engagements by key administra-
> tors, an organized and systematic public relations
> program does not yet exist.                   Harlem Prep has .received
> much publicity, however, due to the bard work of the
> Headmaster and his assistants.                    Also, some of the
> credit for so much good coverage must go to the advice
and involvement of EXXON's Public Relations Department.

> This momentum will not carry itself.                       A fully con-
> ceived public relations plan is needed to dovetail
> with the over-all fund raising program.                         Modern,
> ingenious, and successful methods of collecting in-
> formation by means of questionnaires, in-depth inter-
views, and polling techniques are available and we
could use them profitably.

Public relations activities and considerations
should be organic to the program of Harlem Prep and
> not a set of exercises which we superficially add
to the stream of events.

The emphasis should be on improving and pro-
jecting our program, rather than upon creating events

> or materials for public consumption.                       We will not
> replace public relations with publicity, reality with
> exhibitionism, and our solid continuing record of
accomplishment with gimmicks.

As part of our public relations work, the
following steps should be taken as soon as possible:

1.    A written case to be developed as the
program proceeds.

2.    Special publications to be issued under
professional guidance.

3.    A budget projection spelling out total
needs and breakdowns for gift opportunities.

Publications

After completing the writing of our case,
> a pamphlet should be available which would be a pro-
> fusely illustrated, exceptionally interesting, and
> professionally written document.                      Since it will not
> always be possible to bring all prospective and major
> donors and key leaders to Harlem Prep at a moment's
> notice, this pamphlet should bring Harlem Prep to
> them, serving as a solid ambassador for the school
in the absence of a leader to tell the story in person.

Since the school will look to the corporate
world in New York for a major share of the early years

> of support for Harlem Prep, a publication aimed at
> the top business man and his share in Harlem and
> Harlem Prep will be extremely important in getting
> both leadership and funds.                  Hopefully, such a booklet
> might be sponsored by a business organization, and
> its quality should be of a type that a top business-
> man is familiar with in his own organization.                             Al-
> though its entire contents should be a revelation,
> it should bring the message that to be behind Harlem
> Prep is not just good citizenship and perhaps a moral
ftuty, it is also plain, old fashioned good business.

If one considers dollars spent on a school
> like Harlem Prep as a social investment, the rate
> of return earned by this investment as measured by
> the increased productivity of those educated is greater
> than the rate of return earned by other investments
> in the United States economy.                    It should be shown
> that company support for education in general and
> Harlem Prep in particular will foster direct or indi-
rect improvements in their manpower supply.

Goodwill is a significant commodity that most
> companies do a great deal to foster.                       Their image

benefits for the company.

Economists have demonstrated that schooling,

Staff and Budget

Personnel expenses and costs have always been

a fairly concentrated six million dollar program will

is low when compared to running expenses of similar

The expenses include the services of a professional

percentage of money raised, but always on a straight-
forward fee.

The school has been given a $25,000 grant
from the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation for the

> tion about foundations and making proposal presenta-
> tions to them.           He would also be responsible for
> preparing and evaluating the prospect lists, volunteer
> and leadership training, and tax information which

> encourages giving.             He should be paid a set fee, and
should be assisted by an excellent secretary.

2.     Volunteers/Leadership.           We should not
> treat     the_g~eat         number of our friends and volunteers
as the      11

leg men. 11   They should be used effectively
> in the entire program, including planning, organiza-
> tion, public relations, solicitation, evaluation,
> and reporting.              It is not suggested that all volun-
> teers be used in all phases of the program, but it
> is proposed that selected volunteers be used in all
> phases.  Few of them will serve on some of the major
committees which should be organized. 4

While prestige is a highly desirable charac-
> teristic of volunteers, willingness to learn about
> the cause and a desire to work for it brings as much
> success.              To keep a balance among the number of volun-
> teers which we will have, it is suggested that the
> following key persons be involved in our program from
the very beginning.

A.        The school's administrators:               Headmaster
carpenter and his assistant, M. Hussein Ahdieh.

CHAPTER                V

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

Somewhere in between the incredible Apollo
> moonshots and the blight of the American ghettos is
> the reality that is known as Harlem Preparatory School.
> We have faith, we strive for the unknown, we know
> we must not fail while knowing we could fail, and we
> know at the same time that not just faith, but much
> thought, planning, sweat, and tears have gone into the
> project.       We also know that to keep the school open,
much more effort must go into it.

The Apollo flights were successful because
the actual landings on the moon were, for all intents
> and purposes, the second landing, not the first.                               The
> American scientific knowledge has so far surpassed
> anything else we have done or are able to do at the
> moment in our human and cultural relationships.                              About
the only thing really new about each Apollo moon land-

ing was the fact that the public was watching.                              Simu-
> lation had enabled a "dry-run" so complete that the
> astronauts experienced very few surprises when they
actually took off into space.                    Essentially, they had

> to copy what had been done before in simulation on
> the ground, and to follow the instructions of highly
> sophisticated scientific machines.                      This is not meant
> to downgrade this fantastic achievement, both hwnan
and scientific.

The millions and millions of dollars of sci-
> entific know-how loaded the possibilities of success
> on behalf of the Apollo astronauts.                        It has been said
that the achievement of Lindbergh, the Lone Fagle,

crossing the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis in
> utter loneliness, surpassed anything that we can do
today with all our scientific knowledge and computers.

Harlem Prep's experience in Central Harlem
> is, after all these years, and after all our national
> experiences and laws and advances, closer to the
> experience of Lindbergh in human endeavor and challenge
> than to the Apollo flights.                   Except for a number of
> very recent studies, beginning as late as 1963 with
> Youth in the Ghetto, hardly any scientific backlog
> of knowledge exists that gives us the ability to
> simulate a Harlem Prep experience, or to conduct a
> sterile test tube experiment.                    What is being done at
> Harlem Prep is happening now without compromising the
> basic goals of the school and without precedent.

Trial and error, with little leeway for error, is the

daily operating procedure at the school.                          It represents,
> indeed, a new world aborning, and the voice of ex-
perience is just unheard of in that land. 1

In its first six years of experience, Harlem
> Prep has, in a way, reached that unreachable goal and
> made it obtainable, made it possible, made it happen.
> In much the same way, any analysis of the Harlem Prep
> experience and an examination of its financial and
> educational situation must be based to a large extent
> on faith in human experience.                    This does not mean,
> however, that this examination and dissection of the
> situation has been based simply on some kind of emo-
> tional reaction or commitment.                     Rather, it has been
> based on experience that has been gained over five
> years of hard work and extensive studies of other
> schools.        The specific objective of this study has
> been to assess how this project met its stated goals
> of motivating and preparing disadvantaged high school
> drop-outs for a college education.                       After delineating
> the project's goals, the researcher reviewed the develop-
> ment of the school and how it was structured and ad-
> ministered.         Then he suggested broadened goals and
> the means of achieving all these goals.                          The continuous

1see Appendix J.

> financial crisis of the school has affected the over-
> all growth of the school and therefore has been a
major concern of this study.

The educational program as it was suggested
should incorporate the basic objectives of the existing
program and broaden its scope.                     The drop-out problem

> cannot be solved by educating a few or creating an
> elite group.         The educational needs of these inner
> city dropouts require a broad-based program.                            In this
> effort all potentially able students, including those
> who are vocationally oriented, should have an oppor-
> tunity to participate in the program of Harlem Prepara-
tory School.

An extensive development plan has been sug-
> gested, which has met the preliminary approval of the
> school board of Trustees and hopefully will be put
> into action shortly.

Recommendations

The following recommendations, along with
> the earlier suggestions, will help the school's growth
> and its contribution to the American educational
> system:

1.     Our experimental program in accepting
former drop-outs, preparing them for college entry

> which has been proven successful, should continue.
> A new curriculum in terms of vocational training
> should be added to the present program.

2.    Educational methods which can serve as
> tangible and working models for other alternative
> schools or public schools should be further developed
> and tested.

3.    More extensive in-service educational
> programs for high school teachers and administrators
> should be arranged either with the New York City
> colleges and universities or with the Board of Edu-
> cation.

4.     Intensive research should be conducted
on following up Harlem Prep graduates who are either

in colleges or have left universities.

5.    An open dialogue between Harlem Prep and
> existing Street Academies in New York City is neces-
> sary.      A system of communication and cooperation
> should be re-established as soon as possible.

6.    Further external evaluation and studies
> on Harlem Prep program should be initiated; this
> information could be used as an input for internal

13~

changes or for public use.

7.    More extensive involvement on the part
> of Harlem community in terms of planning programs
> should be sought.

The successes, innovations, challenges, and
> excitements that one encounters in forming and ad-
> ministrating schools like Harlem Prep are never the
> result of a mechanical turn of events; they are always
> the result of the direct involvement, leadership,
> and sense of purpose felt by human beings.                           It is
> this knowledge that one is always dealing with the
> human element in educational reforms and radical
> changes that causes me to be so positive about its
> influence.         Because of the effect of Harlem Prep on
> the ills of today's society, I am proud to be iden-
> tified with this cause, and hope that this study will
> shed some light on its past and give guidance for its
> future.

Highland Park Free School is a community school
> in almost every sense of the word.                       Its present Director,
> Charles E. lawrence, states its purpose this way:                            "We
> are educating the total community, not just educating
kids."

The school's governance and operation is in
> the hands of the parents, from the governing board
> to the personnel committee (hiring and firing) to the
> community teachers in every classroom.                         The population
> of the school, as of the Highland Park area of Roxbury,
> is over 80 per cent Black.                 Over 80 per cent of the
> students also come from homes where the income is
under $1,000 per family member.                     Every major decision

> is made by these parents, and as a result there is a
> growing sophistication in the skills of educating
> children, administering a school, and working coopera-
> tively.       Power sharing is not an abstract principle at
> Highland Park •

> Schools: A Practical Manual (Cambridge, Mass.: Center
> of law and Education, 1972), pp. 10-13.

The genesis of the school lies in painful
> awareness of the inadequacies of public schools.                             A
> year and a half ago, before he became director of
> Highland Park, Charles lawrence wrote an article about
> free schools in which he gave a description of this
awareness:

The black community school, more than
> any of the other alternatives, is the product
> of a destructive and unresponsive public
> school system. Accounts of the criminal
> behavior of public schools "serving" poor
black communities multiply endlessly.

Increasingly, black parents are question-
> ing the legitimacy of an absentee school
> system which fails to educate their children
> then blames the failure on the community,
> adding insult to injury in the most literal
> fashion. They see the public system's lack
> of success not simply as a job badly done,
> but as a deliberate racist attempt to con-
tinue black exclusion from the society.

It is not surprising that parents who
> view the public system as promoting educa-
> tional genocide should look elsewhere for an
> edu~~tion for their children.  Nor is it
> surprising that the schools that result from
> these impulses should strongly assert what
> is most strongly denied in the public schools
> they are fleeing. It is not surprising that
> children in these schools are told that they
> are beautiful and capable and not that they
> are ugly and stupid. It is not surprising
> that parents and community people are en-
> couraged to help run the school rather than
> treated as an unprofessional and intrusive
> rabble.

The control of the school by parents is only
one of the steps which Highland Park has taken toward

educating the community.                 The curriculum at the school
and its staffing pattern also reflect this philosophy.

In the lower school (K-6) where m<Et of the children
have not been heavily damaged by experiences in public

school, classrooms are open-structure and ungraded
with heavy emphasis on relating to the individual

> learning styles and interests of students.                           Every
> classroom is dif ferent--in response to the students
and teachers who inhabit it.                    In the Director's words:

Highland Park is committed to experimen-
> tation, not to Summerhill or Montessori or
> basic education or Marshall McCluhan. All
> are welcome. The teachers decide on what
> is best for their particular abilities. In
> one classroom you see all the desks arranged
> in a hollow square with the teacher in the
> center leading an old-fashioned session of
> rote learning. Next door the children may
> be bouncing off every wall in the room,
> fingerpainting, writing poems, dancing,
> and dipping fall leaves in hot wax. Obvi-
> ously, what the school will look like next
> year, or even next month, is not clear.

Every classroom has two teachers--a community
> teacher who is in charge and a certified teacher who
> provides technical assistance and works cooperatively
> with the community teacher.                   There is emphasis on
> pride in being Black and on the study of Black history
> in America and Africa as well as all the basic skills.
> Malcolm X's birthday is a holiday, George Washington's
> is not.

The upper school is somewhat more structured
> since it poses at present a fundamentally different
> problem~students             whose experience in public schools
> has been so long and so destructive that they are
> turned off about learning.                  Here there is even greater
> emphasis on the unity of the school and on the pride
of blackness.

Highland Park has 200 students and has been
> in operation for three years.                    It has 22 full-time
> staff members.           It is one of three members of the
> Federation of Boston Community Schools.                          Its financial
> support is drawn from foundation grants, government
> contracts and programs, private contributions, bene-
> fits, and the hustle of its parents and staff.                                There
> is no tuition.           It is located in a large grey building
> which once housed a Catholic school.                        The statue of
> Jesus in the yard is painted black.                       On one wall of
> the school a child has painted "Happiness is the
> Highland Park Free School."

THE SHANTI SCHOOL2

As long ago as 1969 the Hartford Board of
> Education expressed interest in the development of
> an alternate high school program for the city.                                 A
> year earlier, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Board
> of Education had established the now famed "Parkway
> Program" which offered community-based secondary in-
> struction to students of that school district.                                 Pur-
> suant to that, the Boards of Education of Chicago,
> Illinois, Cleveland, Ohio, Rochester, New York, and
> Berkeley, California, engaged upon programs based
on the Philadelphia model.

In the summer of 1970, a group of parents and
> citizens in Hartford began forming the plans for the
> present Capitol Region alternate high school.                             John
> Bremer, Director of the Philadelphia program, came
> to Hartford at the invitation of Trinity College to
> address educators, business leaders, and interested
> citizens.        So great was the community response in the

Gene Mulchay, Director, "Shanti School In-
> formation Brochure," Hartford, Connecticut, 1972,
pp. 1-3, 5. (Mimeographed brochure.)

> city that the parent/citizen group requested that the
> Capitol Region Education Council adopt the proposed
> program in order to involve many school districts in
the Greater Hartford region.

In May of 1971, the Hartford Board of Edu-
> cation committed $30,000 to the project to support
> thirty Hartford students.                 Other Boards soon followed
> the commitment, securing twenty more positions in the
school.

The design for the present program emerged
after extensive consultation with parents, students,

educators, Boards of Education, administrators, and
the teachers and students of existing successful pro-

grams.      Area colleges and universities, as well as
> region businesses and industries, have been especially
> helpful.        The program has received local Chamber of
> Commerce endorsement.                Programs in New Haven and
Middletown were consulted.

The name Shanti was decided upon in a community
> meeting in July, 1971, while the school's students and
> staff were together at a ten-day summer planning ses-
> sion.      There were group discussions on several sugges-
> tions of a name.             Suggestions were then voiced in a
> community gathering and the group finally decided
> upon Shanti, which is Hindu for "the peace that sur-
> passeth all understanding."

Ob.jectiv~.§

To provide relevant community-centered edu-
cation to students of the region.

To provide a regional urban-based program
for students from Hartford environs.

To provide wide opportunity for flexibility
> and individualization of programs and learning en-
> counters within the framework of a planned and in-
clusive program.

To establish means by which the program can
be of service to the broader community.

To establish a climate of innovation and ex-
perimentation in education.

The Selection of Students

Because the Shanti School seeks a diverse
> student population, selection for the program is by
> lottery of those students who, with parental consent,
> apply.      The only students who would not be eligible
> are those who require some special educational program
> which the school would not be prepared to offer (for
> example, retarded, disturbed, severely physically
handicapped).

Fach Board of Education makes annual budgetary
commitments to the program.                  Thereafter a lottery

l~

> shall be held to fill the positions offered in the
> contributing district.               Students already enrolled
> have automatic preference for positions offered by
> their local board.

SASSI PREP 3

In the controversy currently swirling around
"alternative schools" it's forgotten why they started
and why they have proliferated:                      to reach out and

> pull back into the mainstream of American education
> those children shunted aside or left behind, as well
as being laboratories for educational experimentation
in an area of great change.

The most successful ones involve a hard disci-
> pline and a tough curriculum, not the let's-pretend-
> we're-a-school approach of many "free schools" public
> attention dwells on.               Nor are the best alternative
> schools reactions against the public school system or
> revolutionary indoctrination centers.                         Too, they are
> not on Vermont hillsides, in suburbia or as outgrowths
> of a new cultural or political movement but where they
are most needed, in the inner cities.

For whatever reasons the children of minority
groups and the poor failed in regular schools, the

311 SASSI Prep-Academic Recycling," The Common
(Durham, N.H.), February, 1973, p. 6.

> best alternative schools offer dropouts their only
> second chance.           And they do it against great                  odds~

> no mandatory attendance, limited financial resources,
> underpaid staffs and volunteers, and entirely depen-
> dent on persuasion and innovative teaching to get
> through to and motivate ex-drug addicts, welfare
recipients, gang members, and disillusioned.

One ranking among the best of several hundred
> alternative schools throughout the country is the
> Street Academy System of Springfield, Inc. (SASSI),
> so judged by educators who come in contact with it
and by the results of its two and a half years of

> operating out of a Springfield store front.                           Attract-
> ing high school dropouts primarily through word of
> mouth, offering difficult remedial and academic skills
as well as such specialties as art, dance, and photo-

graphy, SASSI has enrolled more than 250                        students~

> many of them adults--and placed fifty in colleges,
> with some going to spectacular success.                          With a credo
> of "Unity with Diversity in Learning," SASSI's student
> body has averaged 50 per cent Black, 38 per cent White,
> 10 per cent Puerto Rican, and 2 per cent American
> Indian at a time when some of Springfield's public
> high schools have been racked by racial disorders.

As importantly, SASSI has demonstrated that
> at its roots education is a sizeable economic resource.
> The school not only salvages what would have been
> wasted lives but has built around the educational
> center a community service corporation tlat helps
> sustain the operation financially, provides skill
> training and places its graduates in specialized
> fields that have a shortage of talent.                         From its
> courses in communications and journalism came a new
> community newspaper called SALT for Springfield Area
> Life and Times and which focused on inner-city problems
> and issues SASSI leaders felt weren't being covered
> by the standard press.                A little more than a year old
> SALT now has a special Spanish-speaking edition, a
> total circulation of 10,000 and approaching profita-
> bility.        There followed a closed-circuit television
> system created at the low-income Riverview apartments,
> with SASS! students and staff producing local interest
> programs (e.g., thirty-minute documentaries on available
> social services).             With that background and experience
> SASSI is planning a strong bid for one of the new
> cable television channels when the system is organized
> in Springfield.            In addition SASSI provides a labora-
> tory for professionals and educators who are given
> sabbaticals from their employers to study and aid

SASSI•s operation.

But the core of SASSI is the preparatory school
> and the effort to pull up dropouts by the bootstraps,
> theirs and SASSI's.               The lessons from the experience
> of the staff, many of them experienced teachers,
> provide guidelines for all of education.                           "We begin
> with two premises, that in this country it is necessary
> to the over-all process of education to have a diverse
> make-up and input, and secondly, to stress the positive
> side of education, that each student is a mind loaded
> with gems of inestimable value," says William H. Smith,
> SASSI's twenty-six-year-old Headmaster.                          "We simply
> try to give the self-confidence to extract and polish
> those gems himself."               Emblazoned on the yellow and
> red sign across the school front on Pearl Street is
> SASSI 1 s other motto, "Everybody is a Star" (from the
> Sly and the Family Stone song's line, "Everybody is
> a star, one big circle moving round and round") that
underlines the school's major emphasis on students.

With a core curriculum of math, science,
> English, and writing, SASSI offers sixteen other
> courses that include sculpture, morals, Black history,
> video production, drug education, women's studies,
> and a variety of arts.                A full-time staff of several
> is supplemented by volunteers and a group of

> "Iancastrians," students with some skill or expertise
> who teach under staff direction.                      There are no grades
> given, instead periodic evaluations by the teachers
> measuring attitudes and ability; nor are there any
> class levels or time limit.

> The payroll tax liability represents the current portion for the first
> quarter of 1970, due and payable April 30, 1970, and the liability for
> the month of April. The payroll reports for the first quarter were not
> filed on time, due to a lack of funds. We instructed the bookkeeper to
> file the returns without payment in order to minimize penalty costs.

> On May 12, 1970 a notice and demand for unpaid state withholding tax
> was received in the amount of $1,055.13 for the year 1968. This
> liability was not recorded in the beginning balances and we were
> unaware of its existence. A search of the prior period's transactions
> will be necessary to establish the validity of this claim.

NOTE 7 - Mortgage Payable

> On April 8, 1970, a new indebtedness in the principal sum of $126,543.09
> was entered into with the Franklin National Bank. This mortgage and the
> unpaid balance of $48,456.91 were consolidated and constitute a first
> lien as though they were a first mortgage for $175,000.00. Interest
> is payable at 8 1/2 % per annum, the first interest payment of $950.00
> was due on May 1, 1970. A coupon book containing monthly coupons of
> $2,500.00, represents payments of principal and interest to connnence on
> June 1, 1970. The mortgage note is payable on demand.

NOTE 8 - Cafeteria

> Cafeteria receipts and disbursements have not been entered as part of
> the formal books and records of the School. We examined all of the
> available bills and documentation pertaining to the cafeteria, total
> receipts were $5,815.86 and total expenditures were $5,825.43. The
> internal controls regarding cafeteria activity should be strengthened
> perhaps the opening of a separate bank account and a formal set of
> books would accomplish this end.

General

> The by-laws of the School indicate a fiscal year of July 1 to June 30.
> The law firm of Muldoon and Horgan obtained an extension of the School
> Charter for three years from June 26, 1970 from the State Education
> Department. Attorney Harvey M. Spear obtained a determination letter
> from the Internal Revenue Service, dated March 21, 1968. This letter
> exempts the School from the requirement to file federal income tax
> under section 50l(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, form
> 990A, annual information return must be filed. The determination
> letter also states that contributions made to the School are deductible

Dear Ed:

> Thank you for the kind remarks in your letter of December 3 and
> for the opportunity to be of some service to you in locating
> resources that might assist Harlem Preparatory School. I have
> asked the appropriate bureaus in the Office of Education to
> review your proposals and identify potential funding sources·.
> Enclosed is a guide to Office of Education programs outlining
> potential funding sources in OE for Fiscal Year 1972.

> Proposals such as 3, 7, 13, 26, 28, 29, and 30, include drafting,
> typing, computer technology, machine shop, automotive trades,
> tailoring, and clothing design, which are vocational-technical
> programs under the Bureau of Adult, Vocational, and Technical
> Education. Federal funds are allotted to the States for the
> support of these programs, which are administered by the State
> board for vocational education. Each Federal vocational education
> dollar must be matched by the State or local community, i.e.,
> dollar for dollar. For national projects, Federal monies are
> overmatched 5 to 1.

> To discuss specific funding considerations for the support of
> your vocational-technical education proposals that may be available
> to you under the Vocational Education Act of 1963, as amended,
> you should contact Mr. Robert S. Seckendorf, State Director of
> Vocational Education (State Department of Education, Albany,
> New York 12224).

> Under Part D of the Act "Exemplary Programs and Projects" (page
> 17) of the enclosed Vocational Education Amendments of 1968, half
> of the funds appropriated are administered by my staff. These
> funds are available 11 to create a bridge between school and
> earning a living for young people, who are still in school, who
> have left school either by graduation or by dropping out, or who
> are in postsecondary programs of vocational preparation." State
> boards or local educational agencies and non-profit private agencies,
> organizations, or institutions are eligible for grants or contracts

Page 2 - Mr. Edward F. Carpenter

> to carry out the purposes of this part of the Act, when the grant
> or contract provided will make an especially significant contribution
> to attaining the objectives of this part. The State board may use
> the remaining half of the appropriation to make grants or contracts
> to local educational agencies or other public or non-profit private
> agencies, organizations, or institutions including business and
> industrial concerns, consistent with the provisions of this part
> and with its State plan.

> Instruction for applying for these funds will be available sometime
> before the beginning of Fiscal Year 1973 (July 1, 1972) and will
> be forwarded to the Director o.f Vocational Education and the State
Board.    We

shall add your name to the list so that you will receive
the announcement at the same time.

> There are no authorities under the Bureau of Elementary and
> Secondary Education that can provide the direct subsidies which
> you seek. The limited discretionary funds available under the
> Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-10), Title III
> (Innovative and Exemplary Programs), Title VII (Bilingual Education)
> and Title VIII (Dropout Prevention) have already been allocated.

> Harlem Preparatory School may be eligible for a loan covering
> equipment to be used in mathematics and science (in proposals numbered
> 8 and 9) under Title III of the National Defense Education Act.
> Attached is a fact sheet on eligibility requirements and guidelines
> for applying, along with an application form.

> Certain educational opportunities may be available to educationally
> disadvantaged students of Harlem Preparatory School through the
> public school program in the neighborhood operating under Title I,
> ESEA. There is also the possibility of obtaining a loan of library
> materials under Title II, ESEA. Another possible source of
> assistance may be a tie-in with a local Title III, ESEA, project
> stressing innovative and exemplary educational procedures, under
> the State-administered phase of this title. All three of these
> sources of assistance should be explored with the Superintendent
> and staff of the District of the New York City Board of Education
> in which Harlem Preparatory School is located.

> The Nutrition and Health Services staff has determined that proposal
> 16 for dental care does not meet the basic criteria for the projects
> we are supporting under authority of Title VIIISection 808, ESEA
> as amended. Dr. Thomas Louden, Division of Dental Health Service,
> reports that of all the areas of health care, funds for dental

> Our educational technology staff have raised some questions about
> the technical aspects of three ~roposals.

> In proposal 7, given the hierarchy of needs and objectives in the
> Harlem Preparatory School Program, is the need documented for
> acquainting students with computers important enough to justify
> devoting the funds, resources and time which this proposal would
> require? Can students and faculty devise actual computer assisted
> instruction packets for use in various Harlem Preparatory School
> academic programs, since some highly specific and sophisticated
> skills are required for writing computer assisted instruction
> programs?

> It is not clear why proposal 12 is listed separately, since it
> would seem to be subsumed under No. 20. More detail is needed,
> especially on the degree of cinematographic capability envisioned.
> With that specified, one can then work backward to judge equipment
> (and also staffing) needs. In proposal 20, what would be gained
> by giving adolescents such hands-on training in media production,
> especially when those interested in the area can select one of the
> 150 to 200 colleges offering undergraduate majors in broadcasting,
> film, etc.?

> The technology staff thought the devices in proposal 10 would be
> justified to accomplish the program goals.

> The Right to Reid program staff have indicated that the reading

> conventional in its conception. However, the location of a lab
> at Harlem Preparatory School offers the potential for innovation
> and national impact which a more detailed proposal could emphasize.

Dear Bob,

Your letter to President Monserrat with respect
> to the continuance of Harlem Preparatory School presented me
with quite a problem during my term as President of the City Board.

I            I had the occasion to speak with Ed Carpenter a'f?out
> i~, concerning possible solution involving the City Board, which,
> in my opinion, is no real solution. The problem I faced was a
> simple one of jurisdiction.

I felt then, as well as now, that it is possible for the
> City Board to assume responsibility for Harlem Prep. by adding
> such enrollment to our current High School enrollment and seek budget
> modifications for State aid, Tax Levy and Federal funds. But, by
> doing so, the nature and character of Harlem Prep. would change
> in these ways:

First, we would have to replace most of the staff with
> licensed teachers and supervisors from the Board of Examiners•
> lists. in rank order, thereby negating the dedication presently
> exemplified by the current staff.

Second, the school would have to be placed under the
> jurisdiction of the High School Division, as an alternative school. The
> high school division would be charged with the responsibility of zoning
> for attendance, program, and curricttlum, etc.

Third, the Board of Trustees would become advisory only,
thereby losing its control as the policy making body for the school.

These and other legal impediments that must be

Perhaps you could research the legal ramifications
for us and make some recommendations.

GRADUATING CIASS)

Total N = 35 graduates

16 graduated from college in June 1972

> 1 needs 2 credits for college graduation
> 3 are still in college (2 took a leave of absence)
> 6 attended college for 2 years and then dropped out

> about half of them completed college within 4 years.
> The majority attended college in New York City or
> elsewhere in New York State. Five of the college
> graduates are now teaching at Harlem Prep. One gradu-
> ate is in medical school, and one is working in special
> educational programs at the university he attended.
> SAT Verbal and :Math scores were available for 32 of

> tests were in the 300's. Of the 16 who have graduated
> from college, 7 had both Verbal and Ma.th scores below
> 400; for one of these, both scores were below 300.
> Five other students had either a Verbal or Math score
> below 300; of these 5 students, 2 graduated from college
> and 1 is still in college after a leave of absence.
> Many students had SAT scores considerably below the

APPENDIX                   I

TABLE OF ORGANIZATION

Table of Organization

The table of organization acts as a guide.

> It may often be impossible to pull together enough
> workers to fulfill all of the committees and columns
> that are blocked out for them.                    However, the table
> does serve to spell out the functions and responsi-
> bilities that must be met and carried out successfully
> if the program is to succeed.                    We will discuss here in
> detail each of the columns on the chart, suggest the
number of members for each committee, the kind of

> leader~hip       each committee should have, and some of
the committee's responsibilities.

The primary and final responsibility for the
> program for Harlem Prep, as for anything that is done
> at the school, depends on the Board of Trustees, the
> Headmaster, and his administration.                        In the case of a
> financial program like this, rather than in other in-
> ternal operations, perhaps more of the responsibility
> depends on the Board itself as opposed to the adminis-
tration.

At this point it is appropriate to make the
following suggestions to improve the Board:

1.    The role of the Board of Trustees should
be more clearly defined.

2.    The committee structure of the Board should
be more effective.

3.    More active interest among the Board
> members should be generated.                   Presently, their in-
> terest appears to vary widely, and their attendance
> at Board meetings is not regular.                      The absentee land-
lord type of trustees is of little practical value.

4.    The Board of Trustees should be streng-
> thened by establishing qualifications and categories
> of membership.           Effort should be made to bring the
> membership to twenty-five, which is allowed by the
school's by-laws.

5.    The term of office for the trustees should
> be increased to two years.                  There should be no limi-
> tation on the number of terms the trustees can serve.
> Interest in Harlem Prep should be a prime consideration
> in the nomination of a trustee.                     We need trustees who
are young in spirit, vigorous, and dedicated to our
cause.

6.    At least three giants of business, a few
> of the early donors, a national governmental personality,
> and one or two television celebrities should be added
to the Board.

7.    A Trustee Committee on development should
be established.            The Board's desires and influences

> could be funneled to the rest of the organization
> through this committee.              This should be a standing
> committee of the Board, with about eight of the strongest
> members on it, and should be activated immediately
> with at least four members to start.                     Only then can
> the rest of the program proceed.
•             8.    A Finance Committee to concentrate in the
areas of budgeting and financing should be immediately

established by the Boa.rd.

Harlem Prep National Committee

This committee of forty members will be the
> cohesive center of the entire program.                         Included on
> it will be representatives of the various friends
> and volunteers who have been associated with Harlem
> Prep.      It will be an operating committee in a larger
> sense, since the Campaign Committee and the Executive
> Committee, as well as special committees such as Business
> and Industry, will be sitting on it.                        There will be
> representatives of the National Advisory Board, the
> community, public relations, and so on.                          It would
> meet perhaps three times a year as a group, but would

> essentially function through its various committees
> and divisions.           Because of the representative nature
> of the membership, it will run the gamut from the
> most important persons in the United States to perhaps
> a very young and unknown student.                      Its chairman must
> be a national figure of the highest order, one whose
> name or whose affiliation can open any door anywhere.
> This could be a former Senator, the head of a major
> corporation, a national hero, or someone of like
> stature.       The Committee should be well balanced between
> Black and White.             The National Committee will get its
> authority directly from the Board of Trustees and will
> recommend action in those cases where it finds it
> necessary.         Their recommendations will go directly
> to the Campaign Committee, which will have the central
> control in the entire program.

Campaign Committee

This Committee will consist of sixteen members,
> and will be the active, controlling, and operating
> group, where all the             dec~sions       will be made and where
> the action really will take place.                       All sixteen members
> of this committee should have the ability to lead,
> as well as to solicit, and in some cases, hopefully,
> to give.        One-third of the members should be members

of the Board of Trustees; its Executive Committee
and Chairman and two Vice Chairmen could be members

> of the Board.          The Committee should meet six times a
> year during the program.                 Chairmen of the individual
> operating committees should be members of the Campaign
Committee.

Executive Committee

This Committee will consist of five members,
> all on the Campaign Committee and include the Chairman,
> two Vice Chairmen, and two members at large.                             The
> Executive Committee should meet regularly, at least
> once a month, and be prepared to meet weekly if neces-
> sary.      It should be in constant and close touch with
> the Chairmen of the Board, the Headmaster, the campaign
> director, and other key staff and volunteer personnel.

> Chairmen and Two Vice
Chairmen

The Chairman of the Program who is also the
> Chairman of the National Committee, of the campaign
> Committee, and of the Executive Committee, should be
> of top national stature, as discussed above.                            He will
> be expected to be the official spokesman for the program,
> to approve all special actions and budgets, to be
> available to make speeches at top events, and to

> solicit personally the very top givers and leaders.
> He should be the sort of individual who could assign
> staff associates to work with the Harlem Prep Program
> so that he could be released from his own direct in-
> volvement at certain times.                  In all, he may be expected
> to devote up to five working days in each month to
the program during its most active phases.

The two Vice Chairmen should have a stature
equal to, or as close to the Chairman's as possible.
Not only will this add executive volunteer authority

to a larger area of activity, but will enable the
> Chairman to divide his responsibilities at such times
> when he is pressed for other duties.                        Ideally, with
> the Chairman to take over-all responsibility, it
> would be effective for one Vice Chairman to be largely
> responsible for internal operations, organization,
> leadership enlistment, and, generally, all that is
> needed to keep a program together.                       The other Vice
> Chairman might well be a salesman for the program.
As such, he should devote a large share of his time
> spec:~fically        to seeking volunteers and to soliciting
> funds.

National Advisory Board

Over one hundred members would serve in a
> number of special committees.                    The National Advisory
> Board is a catch-all for identifying leadership and
> involving a number of important people, both in dif-
> ferent fields of endeavor and in different areas of
> the country.          It should have a chairman of great
> stature to add additiornl endorsement to the program,
> and perhaps even an honorary chairman, who might well
> be someone like Governor Rockefeller, who has shown
> a great deal of interest in Harlem Prep.                          The Board
> would be composed of a number of specialized committees,
> each committee to conduct its business interests in
> its own way.         For example, a Committee of College
> Admission Directors might actively work with and
advise the Harlem Prep National Committee.                            Likewise,

> there might be a Committee on Urban Problems of Secondary
> Schools that might be primarily a study committee of
> educators and sociologists, and possibly even legis-
> lators.       Further, there might be a committee of con-
> cerned businessmen whose only "duty" should be to add
> their names to a list and possibly issue a report.
The key point to remember here is that each of these

groups and committees should begin with one man or
woman to head them, and out of                   that~within          the context

of their own activity as part of the larger National
> Advisory       Board~become          a group that adds sponsorship
and, hopefully, participation, and leadership training

for Harlem Prep's top personnel needs.                         The Advisory
Board is just that, advisory, and does not have a

line responsibility within the table of organization.

The Community Council

This Committee will consist of a hundred mem-
> bers.      At the present time, some Harlem Prep adminis-
> trators and faculty members are involved in a few of
> the community organizations, serving as their board
> members or officials.                They include the New York Urban
> League, Harlem Team for Self-Help, Harlem Advisory
Committee, and the Harlem Neighborhood Association.

The Community Council should eventually consist
> of members from the entire city and state.                            However,
> at this time, it is important that the council deal
> with the people in whose midst Harlem Prep has been
> placed.       Muslims, integrationists, nationalists,
> Puerto Ricans, shopkeepers, union leaders, Black Pan-
> thers, Garveyites, and policemenshould be invited
> to serve on this committee.                   Its chairman should be
> responsible, but not necessarily well-known outside
> of the community.             His or her strength must be inside

> the community, and he or she must be responsible
> from the point of view of trying to build Harlem Prep
> in direct cooperation, not competitic:nwith the Board,
> the Administration, and the program leadership.                               As
> with the National Advisory Board, the Community Council
> will not be a line committee and will serve in a
> purely advisory capacity.                  It could assist the Parents
Association to do the following activities:                             utilizing

> the school building as a community center for various
> cultural activities, establishing a summer program
> for children who cannot afford to go to camp, estab-
lishing adult education classes.                      Most of these programs

could receive grants from state and federal govern-
> ments.       The Act of 1964 (PL-88-210) and Basic Adult
> Education Act of 1970 (PL-91-230) are two examples.
> The Council should work closely with such organiza-
> tions as YMCA, YWCA, Red Cross, Chamber of Commerce,
> Council of Social Agencies, and Boy Scouts.                            If most
> of these organizations did not support the school fi-
> nancially, they could provide in-kind services.

Public Relations Committee

This Committee will consist of ten members
> and wi.11 become extremely important for Harlem Prep
> throughout the development program.                       It is advisable

> that EXXON, which has been so closely involved with
> the school, pull together at first opportunity a num-
> ber of communications practitioners in the city com-
> posed of publicity people, journalists, and radio/
> television personnel, some of both White- and Black-
> oriented media, to begin working with the Executive
> Committee and the Headmaster in developing a public
> relations point of view and then, from a service out-
> look, educate the public as to what Harlem Prep is
> about.       The Public Relations Committee will not be
> a line committee nor an advisory group, but will fall
> somewhere in between as a special sub-committee of
> the over-all Campaign Committee.

Resource Committee

This Committee will consist of six members
> and will perhaps be the most important one of all,
> both general staff and front line.                      Its responsibility
> will be to consider all the information that every
> one else gathers--of course, it will take staff work
> --and then to evaluate this information.                          Evaluation
will consist of taking the information, digesting it,

> deciding what it means for Harlem Prep, and then as-
> signing to different action committees, and in some
> cases to specific individuals, the job of cultivating

> and soliciting particular donors.                      Further, this
> committee's responsibility will be to see that either
> it or others evaluate the donor from the point of view
> of potential and interest.                  The Committee should con-
> sist of at least one or two bankers, at least one busi-
> ness man, at least one head of a major urban program,
> and also should include representatives from the in-
> vestment field,           insuranc~ governmen~             and public service,
> law, and possibly the society pages.                        Members of the
> Board, administration, staff, other committee chairmen
> and members, friends of members, the campaign Chairman
> and others, should, whenever possible, be invited to
> the Resources Committee meetings.

Foundations Committee

This Committee will consist of six members,
> including a chairman and other volunteers who logically
> will have a knowledge of and will be able to deal with
> heads of and boards of the key foundations.                            In addi-
> tion, there would then be a pipe line to foundation
> information, not just for solicitation and cultivation.
> This and the following committees will be in a large
> sense action committees, devoting a good part of their
> time to solicitation.               On more than one occasion, the
> Foundations Committee would sit as a whole with the

> Resources Committee, as would other committees on
> the front line.

Government Liaison Committee

This Committee will consist of three members
> -one of our "friends" in Washington or Albany, a
> lawyer, and possibly an urban service organization
> executive.         The ability to interpret and utilize
> government decisions and in some ways act as a two-
> way funnel between Harlem Prep and the various govern-
> ments-local, state, and federal-are of vital importance
> for the school.

Organization Committee

This Committee will consist of three members.

> Unions, fraternal groups, honorary societies, pro-
> fessional associations, and other organizations offer
> a wide field for potential support for Harlem Prep.
At this point, three representatives from the above

groups should sit on such a committee specifically to
help begin identifying the kind of involvement and

support any organization can give to Harlem Prep.

> Religious organizations are a vital and key part of
> this and might well have their own special representa-
tive on this committee; how the involvement.of a

.   -
religious organization is interpreted will depend on

policy decisions but involvement by religious groups

> is both an actuality and a long-term potential benefit
> for Harlem Prep.

> Business and Industry
Committee

This Committee will consist of fifteen members.

> Despite the fact that the school is counting on a large
> number of businessmen to be responsible for a large
> share of the needs for the over-all program, a special
> business and industry committee is necessary nonethe-
> less.      This Committee, plus additional volunteer and
> staff help, will have the responsibility of investi-
> gating, organizing, cultivating, and soliciting the
> rank and file of New York City business.                          The Committee
> should be well representative of the kinds of businesses
> and industries in New York City and should be headed
> by a top corporate officer of the highest leadership
> status.       The committee might divide up into different
> service groups, for example, manufacturing and re-
> tailing, but should treat the entire concept of New
> York business support for Harlem Prep as an entity.

Teacher Organization

This Committee will consist of five members.

> In our experience, it has been demonstrated that faculty
> members who have no share in policy-making are not

> much moved by the announced plans of trustees and
> administration for promotion and fund raising.                                Develop-
> ment plans are educationally more promising and pro-
> motionally more salable if they are drawn from the
> give and take of faculty and other volunteer discus-
> sions.       This Committee could study, propose, and
> arrange agreements with schools of education and
> research institutes which have shown interests in
> studying and evaluating Harlem Prep's programs and
> curriculum.          They could prepare a journal which would
> reflect students' work, faculty writing, community
> news, and other interesting items.                       The journal would
> not only be a good public relations vehicle, but it
> could be sold at public places.                     The journal would
> take advertising from community merchants.                           Harlem
> Prep has arranged with a few universities to have
> their interns spend one or two terms at school.                               This
> program could be expanded to the rest of the colleges
> in New York City.             Preparing progress bulletins, aca-
> demic bulletins, instituting long-range projections,
> inviting outstanding lecturers, organizing concerts
and exhibits are just a few areas in which this or-

ganization could be helpful.

Parents Associations

This Committee will consist of twenty members
> and will work closely with the Community Council.
> They could arrange for the following:                        hold bazaars,
> white elephant sales, raffles, bingo, carnivals,
> theater parties, movies, luncheons, open houses,
> cocktail parties, obtain a proclamation from the
> mayor or the governor, make honorary awards, monitor
> accountability, issue a community press release,
write     letter~     rallies, demonstrate.

Harlem Prep enjoys wide support from its
> parents associations and should continue to receive
> their services.

Students Council

This Committee will consist of seven members.

> Students of Harlem Prep have come from a variety of
> backgrounds, with a variety of stories, but there is
a central theme in all their past, the theme of the

failure of schools to meet their needs, to provide any
relevance to their situation.                     Therefore, their con-

> cern for Harlem Prep is real and it manifests itself
> in a short essay that one of them wrote recently,
> called "If We Should Die":

I cringe to think what would happen if we
should die. If for one moment the bart of

Harlem Prep should stop beating, for me the

> sun would never rise again. If we should
> die, a beautiful family would no longer
> exist, and our hopes to help our country
and world would cease.

We, at the Prep, have never thought of
> dying because a family that has loved to-
> gether and cried together could never think
> of death. We have experienced inside the
> walls of Harlem Prep all the emotions and
> moods which characterize the love relation-
> ship of a family. We have gathered here as
a family for weddings and for funerals.

It began one morning in 1967 when Harlem
> was invaded by the light and warmth of
> learning. It is here that Harlem Prep began
> the journey to teach young people who had
> terminated their public school education
> in frustration. We had virtually nothing
> to work with. Despite that, we succeeded
with our dream.

So impressed were we with our newly found
> success that a school motto was formed by
> a graduate who wrote, "We have done so much
> with so little for so long that now we can
do anything with nothing at all. "

These are fine words, but as Harlem Prep
> has grown, we find that we have not been
> able to make it alone. Throughout the years
> we have had to call on you, the public, to
> come to our assistance. Your response to
> our pleas had been gratifying. Some of
> you may feel we have treated your offers
> coldly or given you rude dismissals. We
> apologize deeply. But understand that as
> an institution, we are still undergoing
> growth pains. We have been handicapped
> by shortages of experience, time, and, of
course, money.

We are now in the midst of our most severe
> crisis in a short life filled with crises.
> If Harlem Prep should die, one more dream
> will be broken in a community that can't
> stand any more broken dreams. If we should
> die, it will mean a loss for my child, your
> child, and the children of the world. Most
> of all, if we should die, it would mean the
> loss of leaders and positive contributions
> to our nation, indeed, to our world. Help
> us live and grow.

This kind of talent could offer the best
> source of support that Harlem Prep needs.                           The student
> body has done so much so far, and should continue
> their services.
