# The Ten Commandments of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, New Persian Prophet {.title}

1.  The unity of the human race. God is the Creator of all, the Provider for all, and kind to all. If He is not kind we cannot have creation. Therefore we must all associate with a spirit of fellowship and love. All religions and nations must love each other from the hearts and souls.
    
2.  The declaration of a universal peace among all religions, races, nations and fatherlands. With regard to these lofty principles he wrote many epistles to the reigning kings and queens of the world, including one to Queen Victoria (to which her late Majesty did not reply.)
    
3.  Religions must be the cause of amity and love. If religion is to be the means of hatred and rancor it is better to be an irreligious man — an atheist.
    
4.  Religion must ever conform with science and reason. If religion does not do so it is a heap of superstitions, because when we study the bases of Christianity, the Mosaic law, Confucianism, Mahometanism, and Brahmanism, we find that they all conform, in their origins, to science and reason.
    
5.  Religious prejudice, racial bias, national prejudice, patriotic prejudice, political prejudice are the destroyers of the foundation of the human race. As long as these prejudices exist humanity will not attain to universal peace. The human kind are one family.
    
6.  Men and women are equal. We must give the highest education to women, and cause them to enter the university of learning, so that they may acquire science and art and craft equal to the level of men. Equality obtained by force is not to be commended. In Nature the fact that there is no difference between the sexes is manifest.
    
7.  Universal spread of education. All children everywhere are to be educated; none is to remain ignorant. If the parents are unable to supply education the government must give it and make it compulsory.
    
8.  The establishment of a readjustment in the economic conditions of society; justice and fairness for all, but the classes not to be disturbed.
    
9.  The organization of an international court of arbitration. The laws of this court to be binding on all humanity.
    
10.  The inauguration of an auxiliary universal language that must become part of the curriculum of all primary schools of the world. This will dispel long misunderstandings. No one will be obliged to study a large number of languages. Two will be enough.
