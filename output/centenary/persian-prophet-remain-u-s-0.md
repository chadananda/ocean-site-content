‘Abdu’l-Bahá, founder and head of the new sect, Bahá’ísm, likes America. In fact, he is so pleased with this country that he has determined to remain here the rest of his days. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to the United States from Persia last winter with the intention of returning at the end of a few months. His new sect, which embraces many of the best things in all the religions, has gained many American converts. This may account for his determination to remain in America.
