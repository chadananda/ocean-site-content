## ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Spectacular Rush from Montclair.

### Special to The New York Times.

MONTCLAIR, N.J., June 29. — The departure of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, leader of the Bahá’í cult, from Montclair to-day was attended by excitement. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and a retinue of ten fez-wearing Persians had been staying at 11 Bradford Place for several weeks. Arrangements were made for the departure of the aged prophet to-day for West Englewood, where he addressed a meeting of Bahá’ís. Several members of his retinue left for the Lackawanna station in advance of their leader.

When train time came, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was not in sight. He had been delayed. The baggage of the Persians was aboard the train, and as it moved away they appealed to the trainmen in several Oriental languages to defer the departure for a few minutes. Several of the excited followers of the prophet, when they realized that the train was leaving, jumped to the platforms. One of them, in swinging his arms about, accidentally or otherwise, pulled the bell rope. At the same instant, by a strange coincidence, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hove in sight in an automobile. To add to the excitement a Persian accidentally knocked off the conductor’s hat. The train came to a halt, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá leaped from the automobile and was hustled aboard the coach by his friends.
