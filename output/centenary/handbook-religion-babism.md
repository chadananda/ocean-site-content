# Handbook of Religion (Bábism) {.title}

The Boston Daily Globe  
June 1, 1912  

{.noid}  



## All the Leading Faiths Explained in a Book Just Issued.

All the leading religious faiths are sympathetically explained in popular language in the “Great Religions of the World.” These include Bábism, Brahmanism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Judaism, Mohammedanism, Positivism, Sikhism and Zoroastrianism.

Each religion is discussed and elucidated either by an adherent of the faith or by a competent authority, and for those whose intellectual interests are along religious or theological lines no more convenient or reliable handbook of information could be desired. New York: Harper & Bros.
