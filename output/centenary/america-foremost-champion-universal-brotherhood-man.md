# America Foremost Champion of Universal Brotherhood of Man

Peace Is Life
-------------

War Is Death
------------

By ‘ABDU’L-BAHA of Persia

Prophet and Advocate of Peace
-----------------------------

### There is no greater glory for man than the service of international peace.

> PEACE IS LIGHT; WAR IS DARKNESS. PEACE IS LIFE; WAR IS DEATH. PEACE IS GUIDENCE; WAR IS MISGUIDENCE. PEACE IS FOUNDED ON GOOD; WAR IS SATANIC INSTITUTE. PEACE IS CONDUCIVE TO ILLUMINATION; WAR IS DESTRUCTIVE OF LIGHT. PEACE AND AMITY ARE FACTORS OF EXISTENCE; WAR IS DECOMPOSITION, OR LACK OF EXISTENCE.

### Wherever the banner of peace is raised it is conducive to the welfare of the world.

> No doubt this revered democracy, the United States will be the FOREMOST AMONG NATIONS TO CHAMPION THE CAUSE OF PEACE. The banner of international peace will be unfureled here. Thus will the sun shine on the east and the west. The CLOUDS WILL PASS AWAY. Your thoughts shall take an upword flight.
