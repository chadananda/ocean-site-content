# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá In Paris {.title}

{.noid}  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas has spent the month of October in Paris, prior to his departure for Egypt. In his quiet apartments in the Avenue de Camoens a large number of Persians have gathered round him, attracted from different parts of the world to meet their beloved Master. The gatherings at his apartments have proved more international than were those in London, and have included Hindoos, Parsees, Persians, Arabs, English, French, Germans, and Americans. Pere Hyacinthe Loyson (Predicateur), the well-known preacher and teacher; M. Remy de Gourmont, the writer; M. and Mme. Mardrus, the poets; M. Bonet Maurez de l’Institut, and many others, have been among his visitors.

The French Press has commented favourably on his visit, and several papers have described with appreciation his recent activities in London. Interesting accounts of the Bahá’í movement have appeared in the “Figaro,” “L’Opinion,” “La France,” and “La Liberte,” and it is understood that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will be asked to speak at the Academie Francaise and the Sorbonne before he leaves Paris. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá looks for great things from London, and expects that the gradual spiritual awakening now becoming so apparent the world over will in many respects find its focus in the British metropolis. He looks back with pleasure to his sojourn in England and sends greetings to the many friends he made during his visit.
