# Unitarian (Persian Prophet) {.title}

The Brooklyn Daily Eagle  
July 13, 1912  
New York
{.noid}  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the “Persian prophet,” will speak at All Souls’ Unitarian Church, Manhattan, at 11 a. m. tomorrow. This leader of the great Bahá’í movement is reputed to have fourteen million followers. This will doubtless be his last public address in New York. This service will be in charge of the Rev. Leon A. Harvey of Brooklyn.
