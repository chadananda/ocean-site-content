# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian Philosopher

Charlotte Daily Observer  
July 14, 1912  
Charlotte, NC  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian philosopher and teacher, lately come to America, preaches the doctrine that all religions are at bottom one. He says: “If a religion be the cause of hatred and disharmony it would be better for it not to exist.” The truth underlying his philosophy always appealed immensely to me. I always held that it was not so particularly a matter of what the particular belief was, so long as it was good enough to believe, and live and die by. I mean by that, it doesn’t make much difference about the outward form of man’s religion. Religion outwardly, is a man-made institution, and creeds do not save souls any more than churches do.
