Exponent of Brotherly Love to Be Dr. Woolson’s Guest.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, head of the Bahá’ís of the world, will be the principal speaker tonight at a meeting at the home of Dr. C. M. Woolson, 870 Laurel avenue. Dr. Woolson expects a representative gathering in which will be members of the Theosophical society. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, whose propaganda is that which embraces a universal religion and brotherly love, will leave tomorrow for Omaha and the West.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the guest today of Mrs. R. D. Herrick, at a 4 o’clock tea at her home, 1413 Harmon Place, Minneapolis. Earlier ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the members of his party accepted the invitation of T. B. Walker to visit the Walker Art gallery.
