Persian Prophet Sees Coming of Greater Brotherhood

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian prophet and expounder of the Universal religion, which seeks to supplant all the religions of today, after twice disappointing his many followers in Boston last night delivered his farewell message to an appreciative and sympathetic audience gathered at the Huntington Chambers on Huntington street.

DRESSED IN NATIVE GARB

The prophet, dressed in native garb, appeared very tired as he began by telling his hearers that only his great and unbounded love for them enabled him to come and bid them farewell, as he was not feeling well.

The message of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá consisted in telling his hearers of the wonderful achievements of the century, which exceed the human efforts of all the past centuries. With all that has been acquired, if all the world but learned the great lesson of universal love and brotherhood, he said, prosperity would be the reward of all, peace and happiness would reign supreme.

“A new condition must come,” he said. “Everything must change and undergo reform.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said he was leaving the day for New York city, but that his heart and his spirit remains here among his faithful followers. Nowhere, he said, was he received so kindly and treated as hospitably as in this country, for which he prayed God would reward it.
