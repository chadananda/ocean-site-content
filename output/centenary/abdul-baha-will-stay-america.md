New York, June 26. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian religious leader and spiritual and temporal head of the fourteen millions of Bahá’ís scattered throughout the world, will not return to his native land. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the Bahá’í sect came to America to address the Lake Mohonk peace conference and the American congress of Bahá’ís in Chicago, expecting to leave this month on the return journey to Persia. The venerable prophet has been so pleased with his reception in America that he has decided to stay, and will today take up his home at 11 Bradford place, Montclair, N.J. There are about fifty Bahá’ís in the Jersey suburb. The venerable prophet has spent forty of his seventy years in prison because of his religious beliefs, which inculcate the spirit of universal brotherhood and the unity of all religions, without having any specific creed.
