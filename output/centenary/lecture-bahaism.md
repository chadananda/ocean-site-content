# Lecture on Bahá’ísm

Washington DC Herald  
October 28, 1912  
Washington, DC  



Moving pictures of the leader of the “universal love movement” were displayed at the Pastime Theater yesterday morning. These pictures were made the basis of a two-hour lecture to a large gathering of Washington followers of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá by Mr. Henny.

Bahá’ísm has for its aims and universal brotherhood, suffrage, peace, and a universal religion. The coming of the founder of the movement was announced by the Báb in Persia in 1844. The promised teacher, Bahá’u’lláh, taught forty years, the most of which time he suffered imprisonment at the hands of Oriental despots. His son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is the leader of the movement at the present time and has spread its teachings widely throughout the West.

The Bahá’í visited America this year, where he has many followers. The pictures displayed yesterday were those taken at his landing and reception in Brooklyn and New York, in June. Shortly after his arrival, the Bahá’í spent some time in this city and addressed the public through an interpreter at Continental Memorial Hall.
