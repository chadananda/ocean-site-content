# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Brings Gospel of Peace

Famous Persian Religionist Tells Church Throng That Unity of Nations Is Dawning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, head of the Bahá’í religious movement, spoke at the First Unitarian Church, Franklin and Gear streets yesterday. Dressed in a long brown robe and wearing a snow white turban, the venerable leader of the faith which now numbers more than three million followers looked like a patriarch of old as he stood in pulpit and addressed the multitude in the church, on peace and love for all mankind.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke in Persian and his remarks were translated into English. He was introduced by the Rev. Bradford Leavitt.

“There landed in New York a man, white turbaned and speaking a foreign tongue,” said Dr. Leavitt. “Hundreds welcomed him at the dock and attended his lectures. That man is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, one of the most distinguished figures of the age. Bahá’ísm has not less than three million followers throughout the world. It numbers its followers among all the great religions of the world. No religion is as significant as this one.”

### Strife Brings Death.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke slowly and with a soft voice. He said in part:

> “Love confers life. On the contrary warfare and dissension are ever productive of extinction and dissolution. Peace tends towards life wherefor warfare and dissension are the causes of death.
> 
> “We find that the domestic animals are in the utmost accord and fellowship. There is no dissension among them and all of them enjoy the utmost of accord among themselves. But among the ferocious animals you will find no fellowship. Here we learn that fellowship is a quality of peace. Warfare is a quality of the ferocious animals.
> 
> “How thoughtless and unjust a man is. In the Balkans now the general lays waste and destroys a hundred thousand men. All will honor him. Why? Because he has torn asunder a hundred thousand souls. Regard how thoughtless man is. If a man destroys property he is considered a criminal, but if a general lay waste a country, people praise him.

### Truth Is Appearing.

> “The ray of the sun of reality is shining upon all of us. The breeze of God’s providence is blowing on all of us. He is so kind to all that he will shelter all of us. Why should we not avail ourselves of this bestowal? Why should we transform this life into death and transform the fellowship into hatred and rancor?
> 
> “Verily he created us angelic. Is it becoming that we act as ferocious animals? Let us be loving. Let us proclaim international peace amongst all mankind.
> 
> “I have come from the distant Orient because I have loved you very much, having heard that you American people are peace loving. Therefore these noble thoughts of yours and these strivings of yours have afforded me great joy.”
