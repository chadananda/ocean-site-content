# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Address

Clark College Monthly Vol.1 No. 10. page 544  
May 23, 1912  
Worcester, MA  



On the afternoon of Thursday, May 23, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, otherwise known as Abbas Effendi, leader of an extensive religious movement which was started in Persia over fifty years ago by “the Báb,” gave an address in the gymnasium under the auspices of the history department. He spoke of science and its achievements in enabling man to solve mysteries and make intellectual progress, and expressed the  
hope that science will one day cement men together by uniting the various religions, which are all ultimately based on one reality.
