Leader of Bahá’í Movement Will Speak at Howard University.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Abbas Effendi, leader of the world-wide Bahá’í movement, who reached Washington Saturday and attended the closing session Saturday night of the second annual conference of the Orient-Occident Unity, will remain in the National Capital most of the present week. He will speak tomorrow afternoon before the student body of Howard University and tomorrow night he will address an audience in the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church.

Accompanied by his interpreter, Dr. Ameen Fareed, and by other members of his party, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá yesterday afternoon visited the Church of Our Father, Universalist, and he was introduced to the congregation by the pastor, Rev. John Van Schaick, jr.

Tenets of Movement.

In an address expounding the tenets of the Bahá’í movement ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said:

“It declares for the unity of all present religions, so that they may rest upon a common basis. The Bahá’í movement stands for the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. It is a very simple religion; it is merely a faith in God free from misrepresentations.”

Following the address the aged Persian held an informal reception, in which he shook by the hand the members, of the local Bahá’í colony and their friends.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá will leave Washington probably Saturday, proceeding directly to Chicago, where he is to participate in the fourth annual Bahá’í convention, which opens in that city the last of this week.
