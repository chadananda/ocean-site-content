## Unity Temple Convention Pledges $9,000 for Building at Winnetka.

### LEADER TELLS DOCTRINES

Theories of the universal brotherhood of man were advocated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas before the meeting of the Unity Temple convention last night.

“Some think that this association is a cause,” said the speaker. “It is merely an attempt to unify the beliefs of different churches, religions and cults. I merely claim to be he who has been promised by different prophets in ages gone by.

### ALL CREEDS SAME.

“All churches, creeds, beliefs and cults are the same. They are only different roads to the same end. We are merely trying to build a temple that will serve the  
same end. We have no prejudice of nations, of races or of religions.

### TO BUILD TEMPLE.

At the afternoon session it was asserted that the Temple of Universal Brotherhood would be immediately built at Winnetka. The following trustees were appointed to raise the $9,000 required: Albert H. Track, Minneapolis, Minn.; Mrs. Anna Palmerton, Cincinnati; Bernard M. Jacobs, Kenosha, Wis.; Mrs. Corine True, Chicago; Willared H. Ashton, Rockford, Ill.; Monfort Mills, New York; Roy C. Wilhelm, New York; L. A. Gregory, New York; Dr. H. A. Badzia, Chicago.

The trustees pledged themselves to raise the needed $9,000.

The site of the temple will be dedicated today by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
