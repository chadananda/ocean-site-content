# Plans for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Reception for Persian Missioner to Be Held at Commercial Club.  
The entertainment committee of the Commercial club has completed arrangements for the reception of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian disciple of the propaganda of “peace and unification of the world,” who is touring the United States. He is expected in St. Paul the latter part of this month.  
‘Abdu’l-Bahá spent forty-two years in prison because of his democratic ideas.
