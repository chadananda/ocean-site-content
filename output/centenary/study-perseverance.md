# A Study In Perseverance

New York Tribune  
May 11, 1912  
  



Dr. Reisner is still in Minneapolis, attending the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. To-morrow J. Campbell White, the organizer of the laymen’s missionary movement, will speak at Grace Church. At the Happy Sunday Evening service the International Peace Forum, of which President Taft is the head, will hold a meeting in its interests. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the great peace leader of Oriental countries, will speak. The Bahá is a wonderful man and this is a marvelous chance to hear him. Senator Charles A. Towne, of Minnesota, will speak also. The Rev. Dr. W. A. Hunsberger will preside.
