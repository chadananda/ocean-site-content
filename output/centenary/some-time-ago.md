# Some Time Ago

Portland Oregon Oregonian  
August 15, 1912  
Portland, OR  



Some time ago The Oregonian published an article on the Bahá’ís which endeavored to give a fair and appreciative account of that interesting denomination. By reading the article fifteen persons, whose names a friend has given us, were induced to write to the Bahá’í headquarters for more particulars. This fact is mentioned not only because we take a kindly interest in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his disciples, but also because it shows that The Oregonian is read with serious attention by thoughtful persons who wish to keep in touch with the ideas of the day.
