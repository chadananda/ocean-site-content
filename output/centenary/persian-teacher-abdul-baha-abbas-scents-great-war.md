So Called Prophet of Peace ppeals to Buffalonians to Help Avert Strife.

Local Bahá’ís were addressed last night at the Iroquois Hotel by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas. The “apostle of peace” from Persia declared that a great European war was imminent and endeavored to enlist his hearers and the people of the United States in the cause of peace that they might do all in their power to avert the conflict. He said that the continent of Europe was one great arsenal and that it would become a vast wilderness if one spark penetrated to its foundations.
