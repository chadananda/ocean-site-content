‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas Arrives Here to Make Several Addresses.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, head of the Bahá’í movement toward universal peace, arrived in Chicago yesterday. He will be given a reception Saturday night at Frederick Douglass center, 3032 South Wabash avenue. Sunday he will speak in the morning at Pilgrim Congregational church and in the afternoon at 4 o’clock in the Plymouth Congregational church, his subject on the latter occasion being “Universal Peace.”

Bahá O’llah, his father, was exiled with his family from Persia in 1853. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas was held as a political prisoner in Acca, Syria, from 1868 to 1908, when the Turkish constitution went into effect.
