## Famous Persian Religious Leader Takes a House There.

### Special to The New York Times.

MONTCLAIR, N. J., June 1. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the great Persian religious leader and head of the Bahá’ís, who number 14,000,000 throughout the world, will make his home in Montclair. The Persian prophet, who has spent forty of his seventy years in prison because of his religious beliefs, has taken the house at 11 Bradford Place, in this town, and will live there after June 15.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá recently spoke in Unity Church here, and was so impressed by the reception he received and by the physical aspects of the town that he expressed a desire to take up his abode in the town. There are about fifty Bahá’ís in Montclair.
