Public Invited to Hear Persian Scholar in Metaphysical Club Hall Tonight

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian scholar who spoke many times in the spring, during a visit to Boston, has returned for a brief stay. This noted Persian scholar is to speak in Metaphysical Club hall, 30 Huntington avenue, this evening, and all who are interested are invited to hear him. He has spent the summer with friends in Dublin, N.H., and in Greenacre. He is to go to Montreal Wednesday and from there take a Western trip.

Sunday evening, he spoke before the New Thought Forum and the president. J.K. Hicks, presided. Through his interpreter, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addressed an audience which thronged the hall, in the characteristically calm and serene manner about the spiritual forces of life and the many manifestations, on all sides, of the close relation between the unseen and the real worlds.
