# After 40 years

Wilmington DEL Star  
June 30, 1912  
  



After fourty years spent within the walls of a Turkish prison, Abbas Effendi, known to His thousands of followers as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Servant of God, has come to this country as standard bearer of a new faith. To war with selfishness, to do away with prejudice, to proclaim the doctrine of universal brotherhood — these are the lessons that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá teaches. Prejudices of nationality, of race, of religion — all these are a hindrance to the love of God and of man and should be forgotten. To be a Bahá’í is to be a little brother of all the world.
