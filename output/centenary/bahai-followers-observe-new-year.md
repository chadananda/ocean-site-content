# Bahá’í Followers Observe New Year

POST  
March 22, 1912  
Cambridge  



Boston Bahá’ís, followers of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian prophet of a universal religion, met last evening at the home of Mrs. Alice Ives Breed, 367 Harvard Street, Cambrige, to celebrate the Feast of Naurooz, Bahá’í New Year.

READING OF PROPHETS

Thirty of the sect were present and listened to readings from the teachings of the Bahá’í prophets, past and present. This year fewer attended the feast than last Naurooz, when 50 gathered to observe the occasion.

Plans were made at the observance for the reception which will be tendered ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Servant of God,” present leader of the sect who will come to Boston some time in May. Mrs. Breed expects to leave Cambridge for Washington and New York early next month with a number of other prominent Bahá’ís of America to greet him on his arrival in the country.
