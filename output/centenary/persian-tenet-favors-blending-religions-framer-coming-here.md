# Persian Tenet Favors Blending of Religions; Framer Coming Here {.title}

(No Paper Named)  
April 1, 1912  
Kansas City, KS

A new and modern Rubaiyat has come out of Persia and its chief author will visit Kansas City next month.

“The Universal Principles of the Behai Movement: Social, Economic, Governmental,” is the title of a booklet just issued for free distribution by the Persian-American Educational society, whose headquarters are in Washington, preparatory to the visit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his participation in the second annual conference of the society in the capital city, April 18-19.

The booklet does not deal in mysticism, but in unity and universalism. In it the idea of international arbitration, international police and a gradual disarmament is developed. The Persian teacher also advocates blending of the world’s religions, and a universality of language.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá is known as a progressive Persian. His date for Kansas City will be definitely arranged and announced later.
