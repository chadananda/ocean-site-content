# Speaks on Universal Peace.

Washington DC Herald  
November 9, 1912  
Washington DC, DC  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Head of Bahá’ís, Heard at Jewish Temple.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, founder of the Bahá’í movement, spoke at Eighth Street Temple last night on universal brotherhood, love, and peace.

Rabbi Abram Simon delivered an eloquent sermon on the Rothschild family and the loyalty of its members to the Jewish faith and their great love for their mother.

A large congregation followed the discourses of the two speakers with deep interest.
