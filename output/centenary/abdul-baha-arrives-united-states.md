HEAD OF THE BAHARST SECT, WHICH HAS 14,000,000 ADHERENTS HERE

IN JAIL FIFTY YEARS

Because of His Religion Views the Greater Portion of His Life Has Been Spent Behind Prison Walls

(Star Special)

Chicago, April 26. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, head of the Bahá’í sect, which, although originating in persia, now has over 14,000,000 adherents in all parts of the world, has come all the way from Russia to address the faithful at the American Congres of Bahá’ís, which will open here tomorrow for a session of the week. The aged Persian spent half a century of his life in prison, on account of his religious views and his attempts to convert the Mohammedans to the new faith, which, it is declared, embraces all that is best is all religions. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, whose father was the prophet and principal founder of the cult, says his purpose is to unite all religions into one. Before returning to Persia, he will address the Lake Mohonk, N.Y., Peace Conference the middle of next month. He is an advocate of universal peace, believers in woman’s rights, and is otherwise socially and politically progressive.

While in Chicago ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will dedicate the new Mashrak-El-Azkar, the first «temple of unity» to be built by the Bahá’ís in America. In addition to the nine-sided structure for religious worship, there will be four other buildings on the grounds, one a hospice for entertaining travelling Bahá’ís, another a hospital, a third a school for orphants, and the fourth a home for caretakers. On the Bahá’í movement there are no paid preachers, as all teach and all work. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá advocates that all Bahá’ís, whether Catholics, Protestant, or of whatever sect, retain their membership in their own churches, “living the life” there rather than forming a new congragation or sect. People of all denominations and of none are among those in attendance at the convention, and numbers of the delegates are wealthy and prominent in their own communities.
