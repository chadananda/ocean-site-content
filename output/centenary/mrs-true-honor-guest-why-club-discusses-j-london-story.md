# With Mrs. True as Honor Guest Why Club Discusses J. London Story

Denver Colorado Republican  
January 6, 1912  
Denver, CO  



### WHY CLUB ENTERTAINING MRS. CORINNE TRUE AT ITS MONTHLY LUNCHEON. MRS. TRUE AND MRS. MARY C.C. BRADFORD ARE SEATED AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE.

Jack London’s short story, “The Apostate,” in his latest book was discussed by members of the Why club at their regular monthly luncheon in the Albany yesterday.

The substance of the opinions on the story were not revealed, except that it was suggested that a communication be sent to the author requesting him to write a story along similar lines with a girl in the role of the apostate.

Mrs. Corinne True of Chicago was the guest of honor, but she did not enter into the discussion of the story.

The originality of the club lies in the fact that it has no officers, dues, by-laws or constitution.

Those who were present yesterday besides Mrs. True were Mrs. Mary C.C. Bradford, Dr. Mary A. Sperry, Dr. Margaret Long, Mrs. Katherine Williamson, Mrs. Scott Saxton, Mrs. Sidney Roberts, Mrs. Daisy Roberts, Mrs. E.H. Randell, Mrs. Nettie A. Donaldson, Mrs. Katherine Wright, Mrs. Frank Farrar, Mrs. Russell Bond and Mrs. Charles Hatton.
