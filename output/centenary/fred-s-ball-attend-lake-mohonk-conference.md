Distinguished Men to Discuss International Arbitration

DR. BUTLER WILL PRESIDE

Henry Watterson Will Be One of Speakers — Meeting Will Be Held on May 10 to 17 Inclusive

Considerable interest attaches to the approaching Lake Mohonk Conference, May 15, 16 and 17, when distinguished men from all parts of the nation will gather for the discussion of international arbitration, Alabama will be represented at the conference by Fred S. Ball, of Montgomery, secretary of the Alabama Child Labor Commission, Mr. Ball stated to a representative of The Advertiser, Sunday, that he would attend the conference.

“With all the present national and international unrest, it may seem to some futile to discuss international arbitration and conciliation. Yet this very unrest tends to increase public curiosity as to how great minds of today view such subjects as the approaching Third Hague Conference, the proposed international court of arbitral justice, and arbitration treaties, general and particular. And this curious interest of the musses in turn tends to keep alive and strengthen the sentiment, now ably championed by many eminent and farseeing men, favoring the peaceful adjustment of practically all International differences.”

These and like subjects will be considered at the eighteenth annual Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration, to meet by invitation of Albert K. Smiley, at Mohonk Lake, N.Y., May 15-17, the members of which will include distinguished men from many countries. Prominent among the speakers from abroad will be Dr. Christian L. Lunge, secretary of the Interparliamentary Union, and Dr. Albert Gobat, director of the International Peace Bureau at Berne, who will discuss the work of their respective organizations; Dr. Otfried Nippold, of Germany, professor of international law in Berne University, who will speak on “The Third Hague Conference”; ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, of Persia, leader of the Bahá’í movement; and J.P. Santamarina, of Buenos Aires, who will discuss Pan-American international arbitration.

The presiding officer of the conference will be President Nicholas Murray Butler, of Columbia University, who has several times filled that office and made notable opening addresses. Other speakers will include Hon. Henry Watterson, of Louisville; Judge Selden P. Spencer, of St. Louis; Charles P. Neill, United States Commissioner of Labor; and Hamilton Holt, managing editor of The Independent New York.
