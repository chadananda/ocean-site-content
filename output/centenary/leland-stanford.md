President Jordan Touring Middle West in Interests of World Peace.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Special to The New York Times.

Stanford University, California, Nov. 9. — With the purpose of spreading the crusade for international peace as a motif, Dr. David Starr Jordan, President of Stanford University, has departed for a tour of the Middle Western States. His itinerary included speeches before the teachers’ institutes of New Mexico and Kansas. He is to speak before the students of the Kansas State University at Lawrence, and has accepted an invitation to be the guest of the Knife and Fork Club of Kansas City.

President Jordan, through his connection with the world peace movement, has been successful in bringing a number of notable figures in the cause of international arbitration to Stanford. Among those who have already spoken to the students are ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, known as Abbas Effendi, the venerable Persian savant and apostle of the Golden Rule, who numbers among his following several millions of disciples, and Prince Lavarovich-Hrebelianovich of Servia. Throughout the semester other speakers interested in the same cause will be the guests of the university. Dr. Phillip Van Ness Myers, the noted historian and Dean of the University of Cincinnati, is among this number.

Dr. Guenther Jacoby of the University of Greifswald is giving a course of lectures to the students of the university on philosophical subjects. Among the topics which he is to deal with are “Current German Thought” and “Bergson, Pragmatism, and Schopenhauer.”
