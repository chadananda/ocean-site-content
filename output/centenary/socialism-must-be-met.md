‘Abdu’l-Bahá Continues Lectures on Modern Conditions.

As if to repair any possible misinterpretation of his appearance before a Socialist audience the previous evening, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá last night plainly intimated to a Pine avenue gathering that his principles did not call for any disorganization of the existing order of things, and did not propose to abolish the gradations of society. A president must remain a president, а minister a minister, and there would still remain an industrial class and an agricultural class, and so forth. “Because order,” he declared, “is impossible without the conservation of degrees in a community.” Nevertheless, the question of socialism was one which governments would have to face, and if it were left in its present status there would be disorder.

As a continuation of his exposition of the scheme of “Bahá’u’lláh” (his father), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá last night elaborated the principles of brotherhood. Brotherhood based on the fact of one parentage, he submitted, was not sufficient, as there was often strife between brothers of one family. Equally, brotherhood founded on racial and national lines was unsatisfactory. In France “fraternite” did not produce agreement, and civil war was common. Even the brotherhood of socialism was not absolute, because socialists sometimes fought each other. Hence the only lasting and possible brotherhood was that of the spiritual type. This was not for defensive purposes, but for the illumination of the human heart. Real and spiritual brotherhood was that which was ready to endure hardship, suffering and sacrifice, as exemplified in the lives of the prophets. If the problems of socialism were to be solved, it must be on the lines of establishing this spiritual brotherhood. In humanity today there could not be observed any sign of real brotherhood; the rich were not at ease, and the poor were not in comfort. The speaker concluded by expressing the wish that the ideas of Bahá’u’lláh might become universally adopted. The address was interpreted by Dr. Ameen Fareed.

Tonight ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will address a meeting in the lecture hall of St. Jumes Methodist Church on “The Bahá’í principles for the happiness of the human race.” This will be the last appearance of the Oriental apostle of peace.
