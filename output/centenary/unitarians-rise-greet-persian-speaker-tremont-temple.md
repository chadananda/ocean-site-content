# Unitarians Rise to Greet Persian Speaker at Tremont Temple {.title}

‘Abdu’l-Bahá Addresses Festival Gathering in His Native Tongue.

Clad in shining raiment and wearing a white turban, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, famous leader of a famous cult, made his first public appearance in Boston last night at the Unitarian festival in Tremont Temple. He came in late, accompanied by his interpreter, and sat for several minutes, without exciting much attention, at the rear of the platform.

But as soon as Lieut.-Gov. Luce prepared to introduce him and he moved forward to the head table, the whole audience of 1500 people rose to welcome and applaud the Persian guest.

Bowing in acknowledgment of the lieut.-governor’s introductory words, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá immediately began his address. He spoke in his native tongue, and paused only at intervals while the sentences were translated into English.
