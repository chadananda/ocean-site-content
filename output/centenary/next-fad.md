# Is This the Next Fad? {.title}

The approaching visit of the noted Persian teacher, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the purpose of lecturing throughout the United States on the “Religion of Brotherhood and Peace,” has started much discussion in cultured circles of this new international movement which will have a strong influence on civilization. Fortunately an inexpensive handbook on Bahá’ísm by Francis H. Shrine \[unreadable text\] will shortly be issued by the Longmans. This little book traces the evolution of organized creeds culminating in the idealism of Bahá’ísm, and has the portrait and imprimatur of the Abbas Effendi.
