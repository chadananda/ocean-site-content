“Prophet of Peace” to Be Heard in Berkeley

‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, prophet of peace, recently visiting the United States from Egypt, will deliver an address in the auditorium of the Berkeley high school, corner Allston way and Grove streets, tonight.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá lately visited France, Switzerland and England, where he was received with much interest. The fact that he had endured forty years in the worst prison of the world for the sake of the cause he was promulgating is the unforgetable evidence of his absolute sincerity.

Even his imprisonment did not deter him from his labors for humanity and from the recesses of the prison cells of Acca in Palestine, he continued without intermission his message of universal peace, a universal religion, a universal language and a more widely and equitably established physical prosperity.
