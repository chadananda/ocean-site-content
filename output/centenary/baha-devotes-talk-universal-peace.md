# Bahá Devotes Talk to Universal Peace {.title}

## Persian Prophet Says Time Has Come to Abolish Religious and Racial Prejudice.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian philosopher and Bahá’í leader, expounded the fundamental unity of religions yesterday from the pulpit of Temple Emmanu-El and declared that the time had come for religious and racial prejudices to cause and world peace to become an established fact.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke in Persian, and his remarks were translated to the audience by an interpreter. He was introduced to the congregation by Rabbi Martin A. Mayer. The philosopher wore a tan garment and a white turban.

> “Is it not better to enjoy living together and unite in the love of God?” the aged apostle queried. He pointed out that Christ and Mohammed had both recognized the validity of the laws of Moses, and that the civilized world had accepted both. Why, then, should there be factions in religion?

All religions, the venerable Persian said, could be divided into two classes — those dealing with moral and ethical teachings, and those concerned with rites and customs.
