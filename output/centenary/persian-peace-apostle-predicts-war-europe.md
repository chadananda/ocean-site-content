## Peace Apostle Who Predicts Bloodshed

### ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Urges Local Bahá’ís to Do All in Their Power to Avert Terrible Bloodshed Which He Says Is Pending in East.

Warning against a great European war and pleading that the people of this country do what they can to avert terrible bloodshsed, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Persian peace apostle, addressed the local body of Bahá’ís at the Iroquois hotel last evening. Of the seventy persons in attendance about sixty were women.

The Persian prophet and his three secretaries, Dr. Fareed, M. Ahmad and M. Mohinrood were escorted to the reeption parlor by J. Harrison Mills at whose home, No. 494 Elmwood avenue, the local followers hold regular meetings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wore a black robe with a white turban, one of the secretaries wore all black and the other two wore plum colored robes with black turbans. One acted as interpreter and each of the others took a seat to right and left of their leader and took down in Arabic shorthand his words. He said:

The continent of Europe is one vast arsenal, which only requires one spark at its foundations and the whole of Europe will become a wasted wilderness.

> “The very cause of life is due to the Supreme One’s love, for by His grace we move, we see, we hear, we feel, and all phenomena is based on His love. The prophets are sent to bear a mesage of holy love and the philosophers and all the wise men of by-gone ages have sung with sweet melody the theme of love. But, alas, the shadow obscuring the sun of affection Alas, that on earth should \[unreadable text\] read a contrary spirit in the hearts of men. Alas, that hatred and enmity should spring forth to make a hell of war and bloodshed.
> 
> “Even now in the orient are widows weeping, children lamenting and athers bereaved for the bloodshed of their dear ones. The continent of Europe is one vast arsenal, which only requires one spark at its foundations and the whole of Europe will become a wasted wilderness.
> 
> “And what flimsy, what impudent pretexts they use. Patriotism, say they; glory, say they; the upbuilding of the continent, say they. What a travesty on God’s truth.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá will speak again this evening at 8 o’clock at the Church of the Messiah, Mariner and North streets.
