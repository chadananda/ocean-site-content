# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Will Come to Buffalo Anyway in June {.title}

Charles Mason Remey of Washington So Notifies Grace Carew Sheldon — First to New York and Boston.

The Interest manifested recently, by Bahá’í believers here and in nearby towns, when it was expected that this learned Persian would stop in Buffalo en route from Chicago to the Peace Conference at Lake Mohonk, makes the following letter just received by Grace Carew Sheldon of interest.

It is from Charles Mason Remey of Washington and reads as follows:

“‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who is now at Lake Mohonk, is going to Now York and Boston. In about a month he expects to go West, therefore it will be quite possible for you to arrange with him to stop over in Buffalo between New York and Chicago.

“Nothing would help the work more than a visit from him. He has worked wonders wherever he has gone.”

The Bahá’í Assembly, which meets on Sunday and Thursday evenings at No. 494 Elmwood Avenue, is open to the public.
