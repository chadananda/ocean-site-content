## Persian Prophet Says All Americans Use That Phrase.

### \[SPECIAL TO THE RECORD-HERALD.\]

NEW YORK, May 13. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Persian prophet of world’s peace, said today he had found the keynote expression of American optimism.

“It is those two words, ‘all right.’” he said. “Everywhere I go,” the Persian went on, “I hear those two magical words — words which I have never heard used by any other nation in any other country. With you Americans it is always ‘all right.’”

> “If I ask a bellboy at the hotel to do something he responds, ‘all right’. If I inquire as to the health of a person I have met here, he answers, ‘all right.’
> 
> “When the conductor wants the train to start, he shouts ‘all right.’
> 
> “Everything is ‘all right’ in the United States. I believe the expression typically reflects the optimism of this great country.”
