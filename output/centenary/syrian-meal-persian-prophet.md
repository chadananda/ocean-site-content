# Syrian Meal For Persian Prophet

Boston Massachusetts Evening Herald  
July 26, 1912  
Boston, MA  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá Entertained in Eastern Style While in Boston.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Persian prophet and preacher of world unity, left Boston yesterday, after, a two-days’ visit, and took a train early in the afternoon for Dublin, N.H. He was accompanied by Mizra Ahmad Sohrab, treasurer of the Persian Educational Society in Washington, and Dr. A.U. Fareed, his interpreter.

During his stay in Boston, the preacher was entertained by Nasim Khouri, publisher of the New Syrian. Dr. George Jureij and Rasheed Ab Delnour, who gave him a dinner Wednesday afternoon in the rooms of the Syrian Golden Links Society, 23 Hudson street. Here he sat down to such a meal as might have been served to him in the distant East. He came to the table in full eastern costume, and was greatly pleased when “Kibby,” the national Syrian dish made up of wheat and meat, was set before him. Next came some bread baked in Arabic style; and when a bowl of laben-curdled milk was set before him he smiled happily and said that it all recalled to him Syria, “the land of milk and honey.”

Following the dinner, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, according to eastern custom, took a short nap, after which he addressed the company, predicting the coming unity of east and west. In addition to the Syrian guests, several Americans were present.

After dinner the party was taken in two automobiles for a ride through the Fenway.
