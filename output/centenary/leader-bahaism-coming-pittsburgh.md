## ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Exponent of New Religious Cult, Brings Message from Persia.

## \[SPECIAL TELEGRAM TO GAZETTE TIMES.\]

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 6. — A new and modern Rubaiyat has come out of Persia, and its chief author will visit the United States next month. “The Universal Principles of the Bahá’í Movement, Social, Economic, Governmental,” is the title of a booklet just issued by the Persian-American Educational Society preparatory to the visit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and his participation in the second annual conference of the society in this city April 18-20.

The booklet is a compilation of the writings and sayings of Bahá’u’lláh, founder of the Bahá’í Movement. His son and successor, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, left Persia this week sailing from Alexandria for New York for his first visit to the United States. Before returning he will visit all of the principal cities of the country, making addresses not only before the Bahá’í assemblies, but before audiences of all cults and all denominations.

In Pittsburgh he will address an audience in Rodeph Shalom Temple, Rabbi J. Leonard Levy, and before the Bahá’í Assembly.

The keynote of the utterances of the Persian who for half a century has been known to the east, but little known in western Europe or America, is unity and universalism.

The Persian teacher advocates world peace and the blending of the world’s religions, protesting against differences or creeds. “The true foundations of all faiths must be established, the outer differences abolished,” he writes. “There must be a Oneness of Faith.”

Even a universal language is advocated. “The differences of languages cause disunion between nations,” reads another paragraph. “There must be one universal auxiliary language.”
