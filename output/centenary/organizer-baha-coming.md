Head of Cult on Way to Chicago From Washington.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, organizer of the universal religion that bears his name, will arrive in Chicago tomorrow. He is touring the country preaching the cult which, according to his statements, is to pave the way for a “great universal civilization which will unite the world into one people.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which means servant of God, has spent a week in Washington, where he is said to have aroused much enthusiasm. During his stay there he was the guest of Mrs. A.J. Parson.

Members of the movement from California, Oregon, Honolulu and various parts of the country will meet their leader in Chicago. Just what action probably will be taken here to forward the movement is not shown.
