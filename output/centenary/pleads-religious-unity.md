## Sectarianism Should Not Be a Bar to Peace, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Says.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian advocate of a universal religion, addressed a large congregation at All Souls’ Unitarian Church, Fourth Avenue and Twentieth Street, yesterday morning. The Persian was introduced by the Rev. Leon A. Harvey, a Unitarian pastor of Brooklyn.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that all mankind sprang from one root, and declared that sectarian differences should not be a barrier to a universal religion of peace and brotherhood. Through an interpreter ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said in part:

> “It will be seen that all humanity come from one family — Adam and Eve, who were made by God. All have been made by God, and all are protected by God, and God loves us all. God is kind to all. That is the basis for universal peace and religion of mankind.
> 
> “For 6,000 years before we had universal peace can be seen the ghosts of war. Look back and you will find warfare in mankind. It is religious warfare or party warfare, or it is national warfare or political warfare. The world of unity has not found rest at all. There has ever been unrest of one kind or another. We see the arms of warfare of the past. Let us all strive for unity so that it may be given a trial. If there be unity to greet God, great things will be done.”
