# Persian Comes to Unify all Religions {.title}

NEW YORK, April 12. — Abbas Effendi, Persian philosopher and leader of the Bahá’í movement, which aims at the unification of all religions, arrived here today to give a series of lectures before educational societies, religious organizations and the peace conference at Lake Mohonk. With the exception of a short trip last summer, the present journey is the first time in forty years that ‘Abdul has gone beyond the fortifications of the “prison city” of Acre, Syria, where he and his father were banished by the Turkish government.

“I have no creed to teach and no doctrines to propound,” he said. “Do I favor woman suffrage?” the philosopher repeated the question. “Women are fighting only for what must be. Divine justice demands that men and women have equal rights.”
