PERSIAN LEADER ON VISIT TO CONVERTS

‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, Head of Bahá’í Religious Movement, Stops in Buffalo.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, head of Bahá’í movement, which had its inception in Persia in 1844, is at the Iroquois in the course of a tour of the United States, accompanied by Dr. Ameer U. Fareed, as interpreter and two secretaries. The purpose of the tour is to visit converts in this country and to preach the doctrines of peace on earth and unity of the human race.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a vigorous old man whose snow white beard sweeps his chest but whose eye flashes brightly and whose every movement gives incation of physical power in spite of years of imprisonment, is the son of Alli Mohammed, a young merchant who, back in 1844, proclaimed himself to be Iman Mahdi of whose coming the Moslem teachings had long foretold.
