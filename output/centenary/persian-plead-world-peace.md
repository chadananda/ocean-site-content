# Persian to Plead for World Peace {.title}

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian philosopher and teacher, will be in Boston the latter part of the week and will make several addresses in the interest of universal peace. He is touring the continent on that mission and is now in Green Acre, Me.

He will stop temporarily at 68 High street, Malden, and it is expected that he will stay in or near Boston for a week or two. It is anticipated that he will give one evening to the Franklin Square House. It has not been definitely decided where else he will speak.

The teachings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are attracting many because of their broadness. In a recent interview he said: “In this day every subject that is presented to a thoughtful audience must be done so with rational proofs corroborated with logical illustrations.”
