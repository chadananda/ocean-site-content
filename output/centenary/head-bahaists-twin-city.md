‘Abdu’l-Bahá Receives Dr. Woolson, A. H. Hall and Others Who Have Embraced the Cult.

Long before the other guests at the Hotel Plaza in Minneapolis were astir today, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, head of the Bahá’ís of the world, who arrived last night in Minneapolis for a two-days’ stay, was up and about.

At 7 A. M. the five members of his sect called to pay their respects. Dr. Clement Woolson of St. Paul came in behalf of the St. Paul Bahá’ís, Dr. H. S. Harper and Albert H. Hall of Minneapolis were next and R. M. Passmore and Mrs. H. G. Harrison, who have visited the country where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s influence is greatest, sent him messages of welcome to Minneapolis. Dr. S. N. Deinard of the Jewish Reform Temple called to see if it would be possible to arrange for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to address the Jewish people of Minneapolis.

Turbaned, dark visaged gentlemen of the party stood about ready to interpret. They were Dr. Ameen W. Fareed, Persian born, who gained his physician’s diploma at the University of Illinois and took a later post graduate course at Johns Hopkins University; Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, Mirza Mahmood, and Ali Akbar.

“All the religions of the world are the same fundamentally,” said Dr. Fareed. “We believe the day has arrived where we can agree on the surface differences. Religious prejudice, racial prejudice and limited or nationalistic patriotism must be eliminated. The world can be unified.”

It was arranged that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá should lunch at the Commercial club at noon and speak in the assembly room after lunch, take an automobile trip and speak tonight at the Jewish Reform Temple, Tenth street and Fifth avenue, South Minneapolis. Admission will be free.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá will spread his propaganda of brotherly love in St. Paul when he speaks Friday evening at the home of Dr. Woolson, 870 Laurel avenue. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his party expect to leave St. Paul Saturday for the Pacific coast.
