# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Talk at Stanford

San Jose California Herald  
October 3, 1912  
San Jose, CA  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá, or Abbas Effendi, the aged Persian apostle of the Bahá’í movement, who is heralded to arrive in San Francisco shortly, has been announced in Stanford university as the speaker at an assembly which will take place within two weeks. The head of the new world religion, it is said, will speak to the Stanford community through the aid of his interpreter, on universal peace and the brotherhood of man.

The venerable apostle of the East believes in breaking down the artificial bonds of creed, of race, of nationality and political antagonism. His converts to Bahá’ísm are said to number several millions, including Christians, Mohammedans and Hebrews. He is an apostle of universal peace.
