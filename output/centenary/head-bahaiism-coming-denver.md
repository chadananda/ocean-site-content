# Head of Bahá’íism Coming to Denver

Washington, D. C., April 8 - A new and modern Rubayiat has come out of Persia and its chief author will visit Washington next month. “The Universal Principles of the Bahá’í Movement, Social, Economic, Governmental,” is the title of a booklet just issued for free distribution by the Persian-American Educational society, whose headquarters are in Washington, preparatory to the visit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his participation in the second annual conference of the society in this city April 18-20.

The booklet is a compilation of the writings and sayings of Bahá’u’lláh, founder of the Bahá’í movement, and his son and successor, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, left Persia this week, sailing from Alexandria, Egypt, bound to Naples and thence to New York, for his first visit to the United States. Before returning he will visit all of the principal cities of the country, making addresses not only before the Bahá’í assemblies, but before audiences of all cults and all denominations, as well as many college and university settlements and educational societies. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will speak before the Lake Mohonk conference on International Arbitration.

In Denver he will speak before the Bahá assembly.
