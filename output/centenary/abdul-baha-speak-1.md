# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá To Speak {.title}

The Evening Post

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, known as the Persian prophet, will speak at All Souls’ Unitarian Church to-morrow morning. This leader of the great Bahá’í movement is reputed to have fourteen million followers. This will doubtless be his last public address in New York. This service will be in charge of Rev. Leon A. Harvey of Brooklyn.
