# Head of New Religious Cult Has Thousands of Followers

Troy NY Press  
December 16, 1912  
  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the venerable Persian who has been touring the United States expounding his new doctrine of world peace and unity of religion, has departed for London, where he will continue his work. During his stay in this country he won over to his belief thousands of converts, including many women prominent in social circles. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was imprisoned for twenty years in a Turkish dungeon because of the unpopularity of his doctrines in that country, but his faith in the universal religion is unshaken, and it is said that his following now numbers over 10,000,000.
