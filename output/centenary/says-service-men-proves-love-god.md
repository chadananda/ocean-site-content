# Says Service of Men Proves Love of God {.title}

New York, April 24. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, the Persian philosopher and teacher who preaches that men serve God best by serving their kind, was received reverently by more than 800 American disciples on his arrival here on the Cedric. Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Mohammedans joined in the reception, for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the “Servant of God,” as he is known to the Bahá’ís, makes no distinction among creeds or races. He is now nearly 68 years old, but forty years spent in a Turkish prison makes him appear older. His object in coming to this country is to advocate human solidarity. That is the basis of his teachings.
