## ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Gifted Persian, to Attend International Congress Here.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the extraordinarily gifted Persian who heads the Bahá’ían movement for the inauguration of the millennium, will arrive in Chicago on April 27, when the international Bahá’ían congress open. Delegates from all quarters of the globe will attend the congress, which will last for five days.

Founded in a remote part of the intolerant Moslem Empire, Bahá’ísm is the doctrine of equality of the sexes, the universal brotherhood of man, peace, charity and unity of religious creeds. That such advanced teachings should come from the Orient has astonished the savants of Europe, where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “the servant of God,” was invited by Bishop Wilberforce to address the exclusive Westminster Abbey congregation.

It was in Chicago that Bahá’ísm first became widely known to the outside world, when, at the religious congress at the World’s Fair, delegated told of the great strides made by the movement, which is not a religion or creed, but a system of philosophy and teaching for the betterment of mankind.

Founded seventy years ago by Bahá “D”olla, father of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the movement resulted in the exile of the family. Had Bahá ‘D’olla been a less wealthy or influential man it is probable that he would have been punished with death.

In the penal colony at Acca, Syria, the founder of the movement continued his teaching, and, after his death in 1892, the present head of the movement succeeded him.

For forty years ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remained a prisoner in the colony as his father had been. Then the revolution in Turkey placed that nation on a more civilized basis, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was allowed his liberty.

Neither the founder of the movement nor his son, the present leader, has ever laid claim to supernatural gifts or temporal authority. The disciples of the movement, however, declare that there are many remarkable and significant things in connection with it.

They say that the birth of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on May 23, 1844, occurred at the very hour prophesied by the “Báb,” and at the same time that the first telegraph message was sent from Washington to Philadelphia saying, “Behold what God hath wrought.”

The revolutions in China and Turkey are also said to have been foretold by Bahá’í prophesiers.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá has appeared before many religious and scientific gatherings, where he has always created a profound impression by the simplicity and power of his personality. At the temple in London he addressed a large audience presided over by the noted divine, R.J. Campbel.
