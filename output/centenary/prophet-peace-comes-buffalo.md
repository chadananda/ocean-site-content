# Prophet of Peace Comes to Buffalo

Buffalo New York Times  
September 10, 1912  
Buffalo, NY  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá Has Arrived and Believers of the Bahá’í Cult Are Rejoicing.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá is within our gates:

The long expected visit of this Prophet of peace is consummated, and Bahá’í believers may well be content.

“I am glad to be with you. The Buffalo Bahá’í are among the staunchest branchest branches.

“To this end I have traversed mountain passes, surmounted seas and rivers, covered many \[text missing\] in desire to meet you.

“I am glad that you hold fast. Some are like a tree, which takes no root. At the first storm it falls and without nourishment it dies.

“Others are like a strong tree. Its roots sink deep, it has nourishment ant grows and leaves. When storms come it does not heed, but bends to the winds which pass over, leaving it stronger for the test.

“I love children and hope to see and bless these little ones whose parents are believers.”

Tonight ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will hold an informal meeting at the Iroquois to which all are welcome and Wednesday evening at 8 o’clock ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will speak at the Church of the Messiah, corner of Mariner and North streets, to which the public is invited.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá occupies suite 118 and 120 at the Iroquois and is accompanied by his secretaries, Mirza Mahmood, Dr. Fareed and Mirza Ahmad. They expect to leave Buffalo on Friday.

Imprisoned by the Turks and finally killed by them in 1892, Alli Mohammed followed as the head of the order by his son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, who shared 40 years of imprisonment with his father, finally securing his release in 1908 when the Young Turks overthrew the old Turkish dynasty.

Since then he has been on a world tour. What has been done in the United States was told interestingly by Dr. Fareed.

“In reviewing the tangible work which has been done by the Bahá’í propaganda during the last few years,” he said, “It must be remembered that its origin dates back only to 1893 when the World’s fair in Chicago brought to America representatives of the nations of the earth, to the parliament of religions. This opened the way to the message of unity, which was given by an oriental believer to a little band in Chicago.

“From this small beginning the cause has spread until now from Maine to California and from Michigan to Florida the census of 1910 shows officially 24 assemblies, with 1280 members. Since these figures were compiled it may safely be said that the number has doubled.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá will be in the parlors of the Iroquois tonight and will speak in the church of the Messiah tomorrow night.
