# Abbas Effendi Plans to Convert Americans to His Cult

NEW YORK April 11. - ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, the leader of the Bahá’í movement for world-wide religious unity, arrived early today on the steamer Cedric from the Mediterranean. Abbas Effendi, as he is known by his official title, is the third of the leaders of Bahá’ísm. He has been repeatedly imprisoned by the Moselems, who regard his liberal tendencies with the greatest distrust. The Bahá’í belief is that universal peace is possible only through the harmony of all religions, and that all religions are basically one.
