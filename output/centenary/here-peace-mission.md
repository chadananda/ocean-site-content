‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian philosopher and leader of the “Bahá’í Movement for the Unification of Religions and the Establishment of Universal Peace,” arrived in New York a few days ago. He comes on a mission of international peace to attend and to address the Peace Conference at Lake Mohonk the latter part of the month.
