# Prophet Blesses Morgan

Hawaiian Gazette  
December 6, 1912  
New York  



NEW YORK, November 23. — J. Pierpont Morgan was written down yesterday as one who had done “considerable philanthropy” when his library in East Thirty-sixth Street was visited by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian prophet. After the patriarch had wandered through the treasure rooms, he paused before the album long enough to write a blessing on the financier and thereto append his autograph. Beneath the Persian script his companion, Dr. Ameen Fareed, wrote this translation:

“O, Thou Generous Lord, verily this famous personage has done considerable philanthropy, render him great and dear in Thy kingdom, make him happy and joyous in both world, and confirm him in serving the Oneness, \[of\] the world of humanity, and submerge him in the sea of Thy favors.

“‘ABDU’L-BAHA ABBAS.”

On his visit to the Morgan library the prophet was escorted and introduced by the Persian Consul General, H.H. Topakyan.
