San Francisco, CA  



The Persian philosopher, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, will speak at the Open Forum, 925 Golden Gate avenue, on Thursday, October 10, at 8 p.m. He will expound the tenets of his religion.

Har Dayal will reply as an exponent of radicalism. The Persian teacher will speak in Persian and his speech will be translated, sentence by sentence, by an interpreter.
