# Persian Teacher a Visitor

Minneapolis Tribune  
September 18, 1912  
Minneapolis  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá Comes to Minneapolis in Interest of Bahá’í Movement.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the eminent Persian philosopher and leader of the Bahá’í movement for the unification of religions and the establishment of universal peace, is to arrive in Minneapolis today. Albert H. Hall received a telegram from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá last night announcing his coming. The Persian was met in Chicago by H. S. Harper, who will conduct him to Minneapolis.

This is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s first visit to America, and except for a brief visit to Paris and London last year is the first time in nearly half a century that he has gone beyond the ramparts of the “prison city” of Acre, Syria, to which place he and his father, Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í movement, were banished by the Turkish government \[unreadable text\] century ago.

According to the word sent out by the noted Persian, to be a Bahá’í simply means to love all the world, to love humanity, and to try to serve it; to work for universal peace and the universal brotherhood.
