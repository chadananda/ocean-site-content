UNITY OF RELIGIONS.

Teaching of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on the Brotherhood of Man.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in the course of his religious teachings, says:

“Justice is to be loved above all. Praise be to God! In this country the standard of justice has been raised. A great effort is being made to give all souls an equal and a true place. This is the desire of all noble natures; this is today the teaching for the East and for the West will understand each other, and reverence each other, and embrace like long-parted lovers who have found each other.

“There is one God; mankind is one; the foundations of religion are one. Let us worship Him, and give praise for all His great prophets and messengers who have manifested His brightness and glory.

“The blessing of the Eternal One be with you in all its richness, that each soul, according to his measure, may freely partake of Him.”
