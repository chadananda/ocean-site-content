Leader of Oriental Cult Delighted With Beauty of City.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’í, leader of the Bahá’í cult, after completing a thorough tour of the city, expressed himself as being delighted with the beauty of Washington. He spent most of the forenoon in seeing Washington, and this afternoon will hold the first of his afternoon meetings at the home of Mrs. Arthur J. Parsons, Eighteenth street, where at 4:45 followers of the Bahá’í cult will gather to hear their leader talk of the aims of the movement.

Tomorrow at noon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will address the students at Howard University at chapel. Wednesday afternoon at 3 o’clock the children of Bahá’ís will give a reception for the leader at 1219 Connecticut avenue. The fondness for children by the philosopher is marked, and many times in Washington he has alluded to them.

The afternoon meetings will continue throughout the week. It is announced at the headquarters of the Orient-Occident Unity today, and Sunday or Monday ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will leave Washington for Chicago, where he is to deliver addresses at the national convention of Bahá’í followers next week. It is expected that hundreds of followers of the oriental philosophy will gather at Chicago, representing every State in the Union.

Since arriving in Washington the Persian philosopher has received nearly a hundred cablegrams from followers in all parts of the world, congratulating him on arriving safely, and wishing him success in the propagation of the beliefs of the Bahá’í.
