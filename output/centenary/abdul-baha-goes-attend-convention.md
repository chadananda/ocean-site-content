# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Goes to Attend Convention {.title}

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian savant who has made many public appearances in Washington during the last week, left this afternoon for Chicago, where he is to be present at the annual convention of the Bahá’í. A farewell reception was tendered him at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Jeffrey Parsons.

From Chicago he will go to New York, where he is to make an address before the New York Peace Society on May 12. The Persian exponent of universal peace then will attend the Lake Mohonk conference on International Arbitration, after which he will return to New York to address the Woman Suffrage Club at Cooper Union.
