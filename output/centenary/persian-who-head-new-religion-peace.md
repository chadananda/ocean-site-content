New York, June 21. — ‘Abdul Bah a Abbas of Persia, who was perhaps the most picturesque figure at the conference on international arbitration held at Lake Mohonk, has returned to Persia. There were delegates from nearly all nations and many of those from foreign countries wore their native garb. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas wears flowing robes and his long white beard gives him a patriarchal appearance. He is the head of a new religion of peace and was making a tour of the world in an effort to unite all churches in the \[interest of\] arbitration as a means of setting disputes.
