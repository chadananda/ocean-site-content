‘Abdu’l-Bahá Persian savant and philosopher, leader of the Bahá’í movement, will make his last public appearance in Washington incident to his present tour of America tonight at 8 o’clock in the D.A.R. Memorial Continental Hall. The meeting will be under the auspices of the Orient-Occident Unity. Through Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, treasurer of the organisation, and Joseph H. Hannen, secretary, invitations to the public to attend have been issued.

Immediately following the meeting ‘Abdul will leave for Chicago to be present at the fourth annual conference of the Bahá’í movement. ‘Abdul made two addresses yesterday, the first at the Howard University, and the second at the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church. At Howard University an audience of about 1,000 persons crowded Rankin Chapel and listened to the Persian speaker expound the doctrine of the oneness of the human races.
