‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, “The Servant of God,” leader of the great Persian faith known as Bahá’ísm, is coming to Seattle. Dr. C.F. Lathrop, one of the best known Bahá’ís in Seattle, has wired to the great teacher at San Francisco inviting him to visit this city, where more than 200 followers of that faith live, and an acceptance is expected either today or tomorrow.

Regardless of the merits of the creed which he expounds, his personality and well-known efforts toward world-wide peace have given Bahá’ísm a great impetus. It is believed that there are no less than 20,000,000 followers in the world, and the number in the United States is said to be growing constantly.

“Of course it is rather hard to tell just what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will do,” Dr. Lathrop said. “We have wired him our invitation, but it is impossible to lay any plans for him in advance. When spoiled. He moves only as directed by he arrived in New York City, every one of the plans made there was the spirit.

“We understand that there is trouble back in Persia which may require his presence there immediately. In that case, he will go directly from San Francisco. But, from things he has said to Portland and Spokane people, telling them to call on him when he arrives in their cities, we are confident he will visit Seattle”.
