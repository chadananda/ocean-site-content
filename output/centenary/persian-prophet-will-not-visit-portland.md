# Persian Prophet Will Not Visit Portland

Portland Oregon Telegram  
October 12, 1912  
Portland, OR  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian prophet, will not visit Portland. Word was received here today from San Francisco saying that the noted seer would leave there immediately for his native country owing to the present critical conditions there. Followers of his doctrines in this city have been making plans for giving their leader a hearty greeting, and today’s news comes as a severe disappointment.
