‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Great Persian Philosopher and Teacher, Aims to Unite the Peoples of All Races and Creeds in One Great Bond of Brotherhood.

Washington, D. C., May 3. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (the servant of God), the great Persian philosopher and teacher, head of the Bahá’ís, will reach Chicago next Monday. He comes to bring hope to the colored people.

His visit to Washington has been a triumphal march. He has met and conquered Southern prejudices. He made addresses at Metropolitan A. M. E. church, at Howard University and at many of the white churches and halls and was listened to by many thousands of people of both races, who applauded his propaganda of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.

He was the guest of one of Washington’s wealthiest women, one who moves in the most exclusive social circles at the capital, and yet her house has been thrown open to rich and poor and black and white. Southern people whose hearts were once filled with the most bitter prejudices against their brothers in black, have publicly acknowledged their change of heart and now they treat the colored people as brother indeed.
