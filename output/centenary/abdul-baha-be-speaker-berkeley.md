# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Be Speaker at Berkeley

Oakland Calif Tribune  
October 9, 1912  
Berkeley  



BERKELEY, Oct. 9. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, exponent of universal peace, will talk in the auditorium of the Berkeley high school, Grove and Allston way, tonight at 8 o’clock. This noted Persian has already spent 59 of his 68 years either in exile or in prison, because the Mohammedan clergy objected to his doctrines.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá is a descendant of the royal family of Persia, and while removed from school at an early age by reason of the persecution of the governments of Turkey and Persia, nevertheless has achieved an enviable position because of his complete grasp of the essentials of a world unification, and an individual prosperity.
