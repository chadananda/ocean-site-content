# Brings Cult From Persia

‘ABDU’L-BAHA ABBAS ARRIVES TO SPREAD UNIVERSAL RELIGION.

Moslems Repeatedly Imprisoned the Bahá’ían Priest Whose Teachings Are Considered Too Liberal — Topics of New York.

NEW YORK, April 11. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, the leader of the Bahá’í movement for the world-wide religious unity, arrived here early today on the steamer Cedric from the Mediterranean. Preparations for his welcome at the pier were made yesterday by the Persian-American Educational Society and several local followers.

Abbas Effendi, as he is known by his official title, is the third of the leaders of Bahá’ísm. He has been repeatedly imprisoned by the Moslems, who regard his liberal tendencies with the greatest distrust. The Bahá’ín belief is that universal peace is possible only through the harmony of all religions, and that all religions are basicly one. It is estimated that about a third of the people of Persia now are members of the cult.
