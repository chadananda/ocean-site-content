Son Of Founder Of Bahá’í Movement To Lecture Here
-------------------------------------------------

### SEEKS UNITY OF RELIGIONS

#### Persian Savant Also Maintains That There Should Be Equality Of The Sexes.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, son of Bahá O’llah, founder of the Bahá’í Movement, left Persia last week, sailing from Alexandria, Egypt, bound for New York for his first visit to the United States.

He will come to Baltimore April 21 for a few days stay, and will speak at the First Independent Christ’s Church (Unitarian), Mulberry and Charles streets. Rev. Alfred R. Hussey is pastor of the church. He will also address the Bahá’í assembly in this city.

The keynote of the movement is unity and universalism. Both ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his father are widely known in the East. ‘Abdul declares that more than 50 years ago one of the chief lessons that his father sought to impress upon him was the necessity for world peace through the instrumentality of arbitration treaties.

He also advocates the blending of the world’s religion. In a book written by him he says “The true foundations of all faiths must be established, the major differences abolished—there must be a oneness of faith.”

A universal language is advocated by him. Those who are followers of the movement say that the differences in languages cause disunion among nations.

Equality of the sexes is maintained to be proper. The reason woman has not advanced as rapidly as man is blamed on lack of education.

With religion, morals, education, work, government and other subjects the main thought in the book written by ‘Abdul is that of a common world family.

There are a number of followers of the movement in Baltimore. It is expected that while in this country ‘Abdul will make several public addresses in the cities he will visit.
