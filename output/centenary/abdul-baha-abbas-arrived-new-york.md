# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas Arrived in New York {.title}

‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, or Abbas Effendi, to give him his official title, arrived in New York the other day from Persia. He is the leader of the Bahia movement for world-wide religion unity. Frequently he has been imprisoned by the Moslems, who regard his liberal tendencies with distrust. Nevertheless, he has continued to preach his faith that religious beliefs are all one at bottom and that only through harmonizing their elements can universal peace be brought about.
