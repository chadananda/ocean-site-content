Son of Bahá’u’lláh, the Prophet, Pays Visit to City
---------------------------------------------------

‘Abdul-Bahá Abbas, son of Bahá’u’lláh, the prophet, who brought the Bahá’í movement out of Persia, is in Los Angeles enroute for a tour around the world to bring to the people the message of “oneness of God, the oneness of religion, the oneness of humanity, the eradication of prejudice, and universal peace.”

This Persian comes out of the east as an oriental missionary to the modern world. He is a patriarchal figure who wears his native costume with flowing robe, and oriental trousers, and head dress. He speaks little English and usually talks through an interpreter.
