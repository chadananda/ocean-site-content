National Association for Colored People’s Advancement Makes Report

The annual report of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People, which has just been published, after describing the efforts of the society to gain for the negro the protection of the courts in spite of his color, gives a full account of the annual conference at Chicago. The sessions were crowded, and on several occasions hundreds had to be turned away from the doors. Miss Jane Addams was one of the presiding officers, and among the speakers were ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of Persia and Judge E.O. Brown of Chicago. Miss S.P. Breckenridge, Mrs. Emmons Blaine, Juli is Rosenwald, and Mrs. Cyrus Hall McCormick attended the meetings.

The association has branches in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Kansas City, New York, Quincy, Tacoma, and Washington, D.C., and is particularly strong in Boston, Washington, and Indianapolis. Temporary committees have been formed in many other cities also in order to organize permanent branches.
