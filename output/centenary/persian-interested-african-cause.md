Noted Speakers Will Appear Before Conference and Discuss Mob Law and Lynchings — Initial Meeting in the West.

The fourth annual conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People will begin tonight at the new Sinai temple, Forty-Sixth street and Grand boulevard.

The program for the first session, at which Miss Jane Addams will preside, will consist of addresses by Oswald Garrison Villard, of New York, William Pickens of Talladega, Ala., and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, high priest of the Bahá’ís cult, who, by his presence, will testify to the sympathy of the Persians in the cause of the Africans.

Monday afternoon in Handel hall, the second session will be devoted to a discussion of “Race Discrimination.” W.E.B. Du Bois, editor of The Crisis, and Judge Edward O. Brown of this city, will be the principal speakers.

Reception to Delegates.

Monday evening, also in Handel hall, “The Rule of the Strong” will be the topic. Bishop B.F. Lee of the A.M.E. church will preside, while I.M. Rubinaw and Charles Edward Russell of New York, H.T. Kealing, president of Western university, Quindarrow, Kan., and Miss Julia C. Lathrop will speak. Mrs. George Cone’s Jubilee club will sing.

Tuesday afternoon there will be a reception to the visiting delegates in Hull house from 3 to 5. Mrs. Celia Parker Wooley of Frederick Douglas Center, will speak.

Tuesday evening in Handel hall there will be a discussion of the question “The Negro in the City.” The Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones will preside. John H. Walker, president of the United Mine Workers of Illinois, Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett of the Negro Fellowship league, and Dr. B.F. Riley of Birmingham, Ala., author of the “White Man’s Burden,” will speak. Mrs. George Cone’s Jubilee club will sing.

First Meeting in the West.

Aside from the fixed addresses there will be discussions of remedies for mob law end lynchings, and other forms of outrage to which the blacks of this country are subjected. The recent dynamiting of the homes of respectable and respected negroes in Kansas City to drive their property on the market and force all to assemble within a restricted area in the city is said to be another subject that will receive the careful consideration of the conference.

As this is the first time the conference has been held in the West it is the hope of the local managers that there will be a full attendance at all the meetings.
