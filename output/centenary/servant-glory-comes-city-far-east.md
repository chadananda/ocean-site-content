# "Servant of Glory" Comes to City From Far East

Minneapolis Tribune

Minneapolis  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá May Seek to Spread Bahá’í Movement Through Northwest.

With Retinue of Six He Is Quartered at the Plaza Hotel.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Servant of Glory,” head of the Bahá’í movement and one of the most distinguished religious figures of the Orient, arrived in Minneapolis from Chicago last night and will be the guest of Minneapolis for the next few days. Just how long ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will remain in the city isn’t known even by his most intimate associates, as he never makes engagements ahead and has no formal program in his itinerary across the continent.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá at first sight is an impressive figure. Long flowing white beard, strange garments and speaking in a strange tongue, he has about him, to the native American, a mysterious something.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá is in Minneapolis upon the invitation of Albert H. Hall, attorney, who met the Persian while both were visiting in Cairo a year ago. His religious views have been taken up by the press of America and discussed from every angle. As stated by his interpreter, Dr. Fareed, his religious views advocate Universal Peace, Universal Education and Universal Brotherhood, and in this advocacy he does not ask the individual to desert his sect or creed, but points the way to an unity of religions without the sacrifice of one’s belief.

According to a program hastily arranged last night, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will lunch at the Commercial club today at noon and will meet several of the representative business men of Minneapolis. Later, so it is stated, he will speak in one of the churches of the city. He is stopping with his retinue of six, besides his interpreter, at the Plaza hotel.
