# Head of New Religion of Peace Is Picturesque Figure at Lake Mohonk Arbitration Conference

The Superior (Wisc) News Tribune

New Paltz, NY  



LAKE MOHONK, N.Y., June 6. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas of Persia is perhaps the most picturesque figure at the conference on international arbitration being held here. There are delegates from nearly all nations, and many of those from foreign countries wear their native garb. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas wears flowing robes, and his long white beard gives him a patriarchal appearance. He is the head of a new religion of peace, and he is making a tour of the world in an effort to unite all churches in the interest of arbitration as a means of settling disputes.
