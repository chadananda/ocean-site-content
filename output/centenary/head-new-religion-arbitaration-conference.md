# Head of New Religion at Arbitaration Conference

Berkeley California Gazette  
May 24, 1912  
New York, NY  



Head of the new religion of peace, who is one of the most picturesque figures at the Lake Mohonk conference.

LAKE MOHONK, N.Y., May 24, — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas of Persia is perhaps the most picturesque figure at the conference on international arbitration being held here. There are delegates from nearly all nations, and many of those from foreign countries wear their native garb.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas wears flowing robes and his long white beard gives him a patriarchal appearance. He is the head of a new religion of peace, and he is making a tour of the world in an effort to unite all churches in the interest of arbitration as a means of setting disputes.
