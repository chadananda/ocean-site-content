# Remarkable Persian Sage

Concord NH Monitor  
July 26, 1912  
Concord, NH  



‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, the remarkable Persian sage, who has been touring this country to promote the unification of religions and the attainment of universal peace, is at Dublin, this state, “to rest for a few weeks.” Straightening out some of our New Hampshire political tangles would be right in his line of business, but probably he would esteem it too strenuous an undertaking for a vacation task.
