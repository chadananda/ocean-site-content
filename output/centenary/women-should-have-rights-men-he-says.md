# Women Should Have Rights Of Men, He Says {.title}

(The Bee’s Special Service.)

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, October 4. — That the diversity and discord which exists between the sexes is due to the \[unreadable text\] education and position of women in the past, is the teaching of Abbas Effendi, a disciple of Bahá’ísm, who has been engaged to lecture before the students.

Abbas Effendi declares that women should be educated as thoroughly as men and that they should have the same rights in all things.

The disciple is a martyr to religion and claims to have converted several million people, including Christian, Mohammedans and Jews to the Bahá’ísm faith.
