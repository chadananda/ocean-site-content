‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas Will Address the Persian Society Here.
---------------------------------------------------------

The Persian American Educational Society began its second annual conference in the District Public Library, with a large number of prominent men and women interested in the Far East in attendance. Addresses were delivered by William Hoar, president of the society and others. It was declared that trade between America and Persia is being greatly stimulated.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas, world leader of the Bahá’í movement, who came to the United States several days ago, is expected to come to Washington and address the society either tonight or tomorrow night. The conference will continue in session until tomorrow. Only evening sessions are being held.
