# Bahá’í Leader May Address Bethel Literary

Washington, DC  



It now seems highly probable that Abbas Effendi, the leader of the Bahá’í movement, will be present in time to address the meeting of Bethel Literary on April 23. We are advised that this distinguished Persian will sail from Alexandria, Egypt, on March 25, arriving in New York about April 10. He is expected to arrive in Washington in time for the sessions of the Persian-American Educational Society, May 18, 19 and 20. His coming to America is looked forward to with much interest, and his appearance at Bethel Literary will doubtless cause an unusual meeting. It is understood that arrangements have been made to have him address many notable gatherings in various cities, among them the Mohonk Peace Conference, the largest Baptist Church in Philadelphia, and a Jewish Synagogue in Baltimore.
