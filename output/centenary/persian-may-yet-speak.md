‘Abdu’l-Bahá Was To Have Have Visited Baltimore Tomorrow.

It is uncertain whether or not ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the Persian philosopher and leader of the movement for the unification of religions and the establishment of universal peace, will come to this city. He had been invited to come here tomorrow and speak, but the engagement had to be concealed.

There are a number of followers of the philosophy of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Baltimore, and they were extremely anxious to have the famous and picturesque Oriental lecturer visit here.
