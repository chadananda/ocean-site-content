# Open Pulpits to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá {.title}

## BAHAIST HIGH PRIEST HERE ON MISSION OF UNIVERSAL PEACE

In the sacerdotal robes of the “the master” of the Bahá’í movement, with the deep penetrating eyes of a prophet of old, looking very much the sort of Biblical patriarch that Dore might have painted, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued to-day to grant audiences in Chicago to his followers.

Christian ministers have opened their pulpits to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and on the invitation of Rev. Joseph A. Milburn he will preach next Sunday at 11 a. m. in the Plymouth Congregational Church, 2535 Michigan avenue. Sunday evening he will occupy Jenkin Lloyd Jones’ pulpit at All Souls’ Church, Oakwood boulevard and Langley avenue.

In his suite at the Plaza Hotel, the distinguished Persian teacher was the object of reverential obeisance on the part of Persian and American followers who gathered there. With women gowned in blue robes and turbans, the men garbed in flowing robes and fezzes, his rooms had the appearance of an Oriental court.

When the apostle of world-wide religion entered the reception room there was a bush and all rose respectfully. He motioned them to be seated, accompanying the gesture with a few words in Persian. A lofty, deeply furrowed brow was surmounted by a cream-colored turban. His beard is almost white. His eyes, deep sunken beneath his shaggy eyebrows, flashed the vigor of a man who, despite his seventy years, might be said to have no age. Though his followers call him the “master,” he named himself the “servant.”

Dr. Ameen Fareed, his nephew, acted as interpreter when the “master” received the newspaper men. Through him he explained that the teachings of Bahá’ísm were the broad general principles of religion which all creeds and nationalities could accept.

“It has for its object a universal religion, a world-wide brotherhood of man and international peace.” he said

To the reporter of the Chicago American ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said he recalled meeting in New York Mrs. Ella Wheeler Wilcox, whose writings on the subject of Oriental religions, following a tour of the world, attracted widespread attention and comment.
