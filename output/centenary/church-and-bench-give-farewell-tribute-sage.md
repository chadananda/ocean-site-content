## ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Wins Eulogy Previous to Departure for Chicago

The Church united with the Bench in eulogy of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s message at the visiting Eastern sage’s farewell address in the lecture hall of St. James Methodist Church, last night. Rev. Dr. Symonds, who presided, remarked that it was a great mistake to think the West could learn nothing from the East, while Recorder Weir referred to the lecturer as one who was in the lofty succession of the line of prophets. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence was proof, the Recorder said, that the race of prophets was not yet extinct.

International peace and amity was the main theme of last night’s discourse by the leader of the Bahá’ís. The folly of racial, national and patriotic strife, and the manifold blessings which would result from permanent peace between the nations of the world were dealt upon.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá laid stress on the necessity for wide and general education and advised his hearers always to seek after the reality of life and to cultivate the spiritual.

The spacious lecture room was filled last night and the prophet of Acra had an attentive audience. He left for Chicago to-day, to complete his tour of the United States and will leave in six or eight weeks for Europe where he will pay return visits to London, Paris and other leading European cities. Later he will return to Acra, Syria.
