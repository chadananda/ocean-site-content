# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Back on Capital Visit {.title}

Head of Religious Movement Will Deliver Lecture at Church of our Father.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, head of the Bahá’í movement and advocate of international peace, is paying Washington his second visit, having arrived here this morning from the West. Since he was in Washington last spring, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has traveled over much of the country. He will deliver an address to which the general public is invited this evening at 8 o’clock, at the Church of Our Father, Universalist, of which the Rev. John Van Schaick, Jr., is pastor.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who is the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Parsons, at their home, Eighteenth and I streets northwest, is an advocate of the doctrines of the universal fatherhood of God and the universal brotherhood of man. He is a Persian by birth and his followers in the far East are numerous. A Mohammedan by upbringing, the founder of the Bahá’í movement is interesting for his development of these doctrines from such sources and for the intense devotion which he evokes among his followers. His devotees are ready to fall at his feet and kiss the hem of his robe.

Washington members of this cult are fairly numerous. It is said, some of them being members of orthodox churches who have not felt called upon to abandon that faith because they have become Bahá’ís.
