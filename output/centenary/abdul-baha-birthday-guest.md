# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is Birthday Guest {.title}

In commemoration of the declaration of the Báb and the 68th birthday of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Abbas of Persia, now in Boston, a feast was given under the auspices of the Boston Bahá’í Assembly at the home of Mrs. Alice Ives Breed of Cambridge yesterday. About 100 friends from Boston and other leading cities of the country were present. Flowers were sent by Mrs. Joseph H. White of Brookline in memory of her sister, Mme. Jackson of Paris, and a personal friend of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

There was a big birthday cake adorned with 68 tiny candies and three flags, the American flag in honor of the Boston Bahá’í Assembly, the Persian flag and the English flag, in honor of Miss Alice M. Buckston of England, author of “Eager Heart,” and the daughter of the famous scientist. It was the wish of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to have the flag of every country on the cake, as he is universal, and considers every country his own, but there was not room for all. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá made a short address at the conclusion of the feast.
