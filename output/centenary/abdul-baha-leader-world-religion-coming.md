Persian Spent Forty Years in Prison Propagating His Faith.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, leader of the Bahá’í movement througnout the world and who is making a tour of the United States in the interest of his religion, will arrive in San Francisco tomorrow morning. He will deliver a number of addresses during his stay in San Francisco.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the son of Bahá’u’lláh, founder of the new cult. The greater part of his life has been spent in exile. Of his sixty-eight years of life, forty have been spent in prison, from which he directed his followers. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has been the leader at the Bahá’í movement since 1892, having been chosen to that position by his father just before the latter’s death.

The Bahá’í movement, or “Religion of Bahá,” proclaims a universal religion intended to unite the varying beliefs of Christian denominations, the Jewish religion. Buddhism and every known faith. Its leader takes the stand that the essence of all true religion is identical. It has spread considerably from Teheran, Persia, where it was founded, and numbers a great many followers in the United States.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá will be here only for a brief visit.
