Accessing literature on the Bahá'í Faith: emerging search
technologies and recent results
Graham Hasall
Suva, University of the South Pacific

Abstract
This article surveys some current search technologies that can be used to find
documentation on the Bahá'í religion, and provides a summary of results of such
searches for the period 2003-2006. It suggests that increase in the capacity to
search in the past three decades has increased at a phenomenal pace. Search
technologies have multiplied and become more effective and more accessible.
More data has become accessible. Emphasis has shifted from seeking information
toward making best use of the information found. Deeper access to information has
expanded the range of research questions that we may dare to ask.

Access to literature relating to the Bahá'í religion and its emerging global
community has expanded phenomenally with the advent of new
communications technologies. Scholarly literature is appearing in academic
presses, in Bahá‟í-sponsored or affiliated presses, in the media, and on the
Internet.1 Systematic posting of essays on the World Wide Web is now
widely regarded as "publication". Consider, for instance, Moojan Momen‟s
commentary “A Change of Culture”, published on H-Bahai on 15th February
2003\.2 Significant references to the Faith appear in the literature of religious
studies and the social sciences generally, as well as in current affairs
literature. However, there is also is an increasing volume of scholarship
published on the web only.3

The rapid emergence of electronic information services is revolutionising
access to information on the Bahá'í Faith. Electronic sources range from
websites that are freely accessible, to journal databases and full-text books
available only by subscription, to discussion groups that allow researchers to
communicate back and forth. By combining these sources the researcher
may learn not only of such traditional sources of scholarly information as
books and academic papers, but of such other sources as news services and
newspaper articles. Judicial and other official records such as those of the
United Nations Organisation are also becoming available, as are book lists
supplied by booksellers. A search at the on-line bookstore "Amazon.com" in
March 1999, for example, found 264 references to "Bahá'í", 304 references
the following October, and 1,681 in April 2007. A CD ROM from
Newsbank called REDEX has an "Index to UN Documents" which when

and 1999) are online at http://www.bahai.org.au/abs/reptof98.htm and on the Bahá‟í-library.org website.

searched in March 1999 yielded 209 references to "Bahá'í". A search in the
EBSCO database, in the "World Magazine Bank" file, yielded 107
references.

I find it extraordinary that I now have the opportunity to search a database
such as FirstSearch and learn that author D.C. Lewis referred to the Bahá‟ís
of Tartarstan in an article that appeared in the journal Central Asian Survey
in 1997,4 or to find in America: History and Life a reference to an article in
the Armenian Review quoting “newly discovered English-Language
materials” of Dr Reuben Darbinian of Boston, which:

> Presents the concluding extract from the daily journals of Dr. Reuben
> Darbinian, the editor-in-chief of the Harenik publications of Boston;
> the entries from November 1931 through April 1932 cover daily life
> and thoughts on Bahá‟í and foreign relations.5

This search capacity is quite extraordinary, even if now taken for granted. In
an earlier period, “publication” referred to the physical printing of “hard-
copy” books, newspapers, pamphlets, magazines, theses, official reports,
and academic journals. This printed literature was accessed by browsing
through collections in libraries and bookstores, card catalogues, printed
indexes, and archives. Information deemed useful by a researcher was then
either copied out by hand or “photocopied” page by page. In some cases,
access to such institutions was limited by membership, such as being a
student or faculty member of a university, or by being recognised as a
legitimate researcher by an institutional archive. The most open form of
search and retrieval in this phase was through purchase of materials into
one‟s personal collection, or through visiting a public library.6 Of course, in
the context of such limited access, researchers had minimal access to
“official” records of governments or other agencies. Search projects from
this period include E.G. Browne‟s Materials for the study of the Babi
Religion7 and Momen‟s survey of “Contemporary Western Accounts” of the

Lewis, D.C., “Ethnicity and religion in Tatarstan and the Volga-Ural region”, Central Asian Survey
16, no.2 (1997) p. 215-236. Abstract: This paper explores the link between religion and ethnic identity among the
Tatars people of Tatarstan and the Volga-Ural region. It traces the history of Islam, Russian Orthodoxy, paganism,
and the Bahá‟í faith in this area, highlighting periods of conflict including current tensions between Tatar Muslim
nationalists and some Protestant groups. The paper provides detailed statistics of the geographical distribution of
ethnic groups within Tatarstan focusing mainly on the indigenous peoples of the Volga-Ural region, and concludes
that one widespread legacy of Communism is that many people find it easier to call themselves atheists than
anything else..

Darbinian (part iii)”. Armenian Review 1981 34(4): 389-402. America: History and Life database accessed June

This is still one of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences in searching. When writing the
present article during a visit to Auckland, New Zealand, in April 2007, my browsing second-handbook bookshops
was rewarded by finding three unique books with Bahá'í references: Boulton, M. (1960). Zamenhof Creator of
Esperanto. London, Routledge and Kegan Paul., Bell, F. (1947). The Letters of Gertrude Bell. London, Ernest
Benn. Fraser, D. (1910). Persia and Turkey in Revolt. Edinburgh and London, William Blackwood and Sons.

589       Graham Hassall                                                            Accessing Literature

Bábí and Bahá'í Religions8; the premier bibliography of the period is
Collins‟ Bibliography of English Language works on the Babi and Bahá'í
Faiths9 .

In a second phase of access, catalogues were computerised and made
available at site-specific locations, particularly institutional and academic
libraries. Access to full-text documents shifted from such technologies as
micro-fiche to “digitized” images. The rapid emergence of general access to
the internet then made possible not only the “online” interrogation of
computerised catalogues, but the retrieval of full text articles whether in
“read-only” or “Optical Character Recognition” (OCR) format. The
significance of OCR technology is that a researcher can now by-pass
manually constructed catalogues and indexes, and seek any “string” (ie,
sequence of letters and symbols) imaginable, across a range of “platforms”
(ie, software programs that provide an interface between digital text and the
reader – such as html, Adobe‟s PDF, or Microsoft Word).

The practical effect of this technological advance is that the researcher may
now find obscure (or not so obscure) references of interest that have evaded
previous detection (At this stage we are setting aside the issue of “quality”
in search results; a discussion of quality versus quantity of search results
will follow). A large number of “Bahá‟í” references are in one sense “small”
and inconsequential.10 Yet even the smallest inclusion of a reference can
represent a significant shift on the part of an author. A second issue concerns
the „boundaries‟ of Bahá‟í literature, which potentially includes literature by
Bahá‟ís, or concerning Bahá‟í themes, which does not make explicit Bahá‟í
references. Note, for instance, Frank Lewis‟ study of Rumi;11 Andy Knight‟s
studies on the United Nations system and international order12; Danesh
Sarooshi‟s works on international law13; Bill Huitt‟s encyclopaedia entry on
“moral education”, etc14 The question can similarly be asked about scientists
whose work is “Bahá‟í-inspired”.

590      Graham Hassall                                     Accessing Literature

It is now possible to keep track of references in print media through e-
tracker, Lexis-Nexis, Westlaw, etc., and in discussion groups (eg through
Dejanews); Full text retrieval of articles is available through such
subscription services as “Expanded Academic” and such electronic libraries
as Ebrary and Questia. It is possible monitor closely the activities of the
Bahá'í International Community in the various agencies of the United
Nations Organization; and it is possible to track the work of Bahá'í
institutions, whether schools and institutes, individual scholars, scholarship
portals (eg: Bahá‟í Faith Index, Bahá'í Library), and associations for Bahá'í
Studies. In sum, the search capacities currently unfolding present exciting
opportunities for bringing together extremely diverse and seemingly esoteric
but potentially crucial and invaluable information in the service of
scholarship. Electronic sources are being supplemented both forwards and
backwards in time. This means that older publications are gradually
becoming indexed. Commonly used web browsers remain Internet Explorer
and Firefox – however, regardless of choice of browser, the researcher
should customise with add-ons, commencing with the “Google toolbar‟, and
if using Firefox, selected journal search add-ons are available

Library catalogues

Traditionally, library catalogues comprised cards that could be searched by
author, title, and subject. Some large libraries printed their catalogues in
book form so as to enable searches from beyond their physical location,
wherever such printed catalogues were placed. I first encountered the
“facsimile” of the British Museum‟s card catalogue in the Michael Somare
Library of the University of Papua New Guinea. The catalogues of most
libraries are now searchable on-line and while the most common way to do
this is to first visit the library‟s website, bibliographic software such as
Endnote facilitate this without the need to visit the website directly.
Libraries that deploy what is known as the “Z39” protocol have “opened
up” their catalogues to such searching. The Zetoc database, for instance
provides Z39.50-compliant access to the British Library's Electronic Table
of Contents (ETOC), allowing search through the contents of approximately
20,000 current journals and 16,000 conference proceedings published per
year:

> “With around 20 million journal and conference records, the database
> covers every imaginable subject in science, technology, medicine,
> engineering, business, law, finance and the humanities. Around
> 100,000 of the journals included are available for electronic data
> delivery (EDD) download. The database covers the years from 1993
> to date and is updated daily. A list of journal titles covered by the
> database is available. Copies of all the articles and conference papers
> listed on the database can be ordered online from the British
> Library's Document Supply Centre in Yorkshire.”

The accompanying graphic shows a search being conducted using Endnote.
While online, I have connected to the library catalogue at Temple University
and conducted a search for materials catalogued with the term “Baha‟i” in
any field. This search yielded 95 entries for materials dating between 1911
and 2006.

Publication catalogues

Serial and subject indexes
Serial indexes may index an individual serial or multiple serials. America:
History and Life, African Studies, and Canadian Periodical Index typify
titles devoted to the indexing of serials from geographic regions, while Arts
and Humanities Citation Index, Combined Retrospective Index to Journals
in Sociology 1895-1974, vol.3: Subjects, and Religious & Theological
Abstracts exemplify serial indexes devoted to specific fields and disciplines.
I have inspected at least 136 such serial indexes which, over a period of
time, have become subsumed in the larger electronic libraries and for the
most part discontinued as distinct hard-copy publications.

The advent of digital libraries, which enable full text searching within
serials, has rendered serial and subject indexes obsolete – apart, of course,
from indexes to materials not yet online. Services of interest include in
ATLA Religion Database + ATLAS, which holds records from 1949 to the
present.15 A search in this database on February 18, 2002 for the term
„Bahá‟í‟ yielded 439 records; a search through Hein Online - the modern
link to legal history on 4th August 2003 found Bahá‟í references in 27
volumes; while a search in the Periodicals Contents Index Web,16 15
February 2002, yielded 25 references in English, German and Italian.17

Dissertation Indexes

Various degree qualifications at tertiary institutions require their students to
submit a dissertation (also known as a thesis). Dissertation indexes seek to
compile lists of completed theses. Within academic environments, there are
also departmental publications which have a low volume of circulation and
minimal accessibility. Whereas theses are becoming more accessible
through indexes, it is still possible to find unique citations in specific
university catalogues. In March 2003, for instance, I found while searching
the library catalogue at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, the
hard-copy Master‟s thesis “Bahá‟í - a Study in Planned Syncretism” by
Benson18

A July 2001 search was conducted using “Silver Platter” ERL Webspirs. The “database guide” at
gives the following information About ATLA Religion Database + ATLAS: “ATLA Religion Database + ATLAS
is produced by the American Theological Library Association's Center for Electronic Resources in Theology and
Religion. The ATLAS (American Theological Library Association Serials) project was created for religion
scholars by religion scholars. It provides online versions of the entire runs of a core collection of more than fifty
significant scholarly periodicals in the field of religion, most of which go back to 1949. ATLAS journals represent
a wide selection of Christian traditions (including Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Evangelical, and Pentecostal),
Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, and other religious traditions.”

Described as “the most comprehensive index to journals in the Humanities and Social Sciences, a

While dissertation indexes were formerly in hard-copy only, a number
online dissertation indexing projects now exist. Hard copy dissertation
indexes include the Comprehensive Dissertation Index, Dissertation
Abstracts International: A The Humanities and Social Sciences; Doctoral
Dissertations; and American Doctoral Dissertations; Index to Theses
accepted for higher degrees by the Universities of Great Britain and Ireland
; and Union List of Higher Degree Theses in Australian Libraries. One
innovative project to expand digital access to theses is the “Networked
Digital Library of theses and dissertations”. A search at this site in April
2007 yields 45 theses having a Bahá‟í reference.

Bibliographies

Typically, Babi and Bahá'í references are found bibliographies of religion
and of countries. To date, I have inspected 92. This is in addition to the
bibliographies devoted to Bahá'í literature, the main ones being those by
Bjorling19, Collins20 (Collins 1990), and Stockman and Winters21 (Stockman
and Winters 1997), with an earlier contribution by Braun22. The Resource
Guide for the Scholarly Study of the Bahá'í Faith is online, while additional
bibliographies of Bahá‟í materials have been gathered by Jonah Winters at
http://bahai-library.com/resources/

Archives

Archives collect documents and other artefacts that may not exist in
published form. Traditionally, the contents of such collections were
accessible only those able to visit the archive‟s physical location. The advent
of online catalogues allows for off-site searching of contents, if not of the
documents and artefacts themselves. In January 2003 a “World Association
for Bahá‟í libraries and archives” was established at a conference at
Landegg, Switzerland. Although this initiative has not been followed up
sufficiently, it provides the groundwork for later development of policies
and procedures for the organization of materials held by Bahá‟í
communities and institutions. While the major portion of significant archival
materials are stored in the archives of National Assemblies and at the Bahá‟í
World Centre, other archives do hold materials of interest.23

Search engines

General

Simple searching is achieved through „open source‟ searching of the World
Wide Web. Most internet users are familiar with Google, Yahoo, and many
other such search engines. Each has its strengths and weaknesses as a search
tool. General search engines can be helpful if one is seeking broad
information about Bahá'í communities and their activities; more specialised
engines are required if one is looking for information from scholarly, or
more authoritative, sources. Current information about what search engines
and technologies are available is easily found, ironically, but writing a direct
query into one‟s current browser search facility.24

There     are     even      specialised         websites   at   www.searchengines.com       and
http://www.searchenginewatch.com

Specialized
There are specialised search engines and also meta-search engines. A
specialised search engine will focus, for example, on providing results for a
particular country, or for a specific subject area, or from within a specific
news-source such as newspapers, or official documents. “Google Scholar”,
for instance, provides for searches from within scholarly materials, rather
than from the WWW generally.

There are also “meta-search” engines such as Copernic
(www.copernic.com), which combine the results from multiple searches into
one consolidated results list. The professional edition of this software
(Copernic Agent Professional) allows the researcher to nominate the target
for searches as well as the frequency. It is possible to search, for instance, on
a daily, weekly or monthly basis, for Bahá'í references within news sources
for Australia, or Brazil, or the UK, to name a few. Searching databases on
the WWW are another branch of specialised search. Such resources are
sometimes called the “hidden web” since an ordinary search may find the
homepage of a database, but does not have the capacity to enter into the
database to find specific resources. See, for example, the information

Alerts and intelligent agents

Alert services allow the researcher to nominate topics about which he or she
seeks notification. When the nominated topic appears within a product of
the information provider, the researcher can receive special notification –
usually by email. Such alert services are provided by digital libraries such as

Proquest, periodical publishers such as Blackwell,, book sellers (new and
used) such as Amazon.com, and news aggregators such as “Google News”.
The accompanying graphic shows the latest alert from Proquest, showing
three articles containing a Baha‟i reference.

The British Library’s “zetoc Alert” is an example of a current awareness
service that can be requested to email alerts on specific keywords. It emails
tables of contents of targeted journals or details of articles which match
some pre-defined search criteria such as an author's name or keywords from
the title. These email Alerts are sent on the day the new data is loaded into
the database.25

“Intelligent Agents” undertake customised internet searches and
automatically return the results to the searcher. Some agents are available
for free subscription, while those having more sophisticated capacities are
available for purchase or subscription. The powerful software Copernic
Agent is a meta-search tool that can retrieve searches in specialised areas of
the internet according to a pre-set schedule.

Homepages

In the past decade a significant quantity of information on Bahá‟í
communities has been posted on the world wide web. Significant portals
include bahai-library.org,26 H-Bahai, Bahaindex,com and the official site
www.bahai.org. The religious press now has dedicated websites and search
engines, and such sources can track Bahá‟í references at such events as, for
instance, the Parliament of the World‟s Religions. For instance, Kung and
Kuschel‟s report of Bahá‟í participation in the signing of a “Global Ethic” at
the World Parliament of Religions which met in Chicago in 1993 27 was
reported in an article on “Women's multifaith perspectives on global child
advocacy” in 200028 . The third international meeting of the Parliament of
the World's Religions, held in Cape Town in December 1999, was subject to
articles exploring ecumenism: Ruether reported that that there were
probably more members of the Bahá‟í and the Mormons than Methodists”
present29 Calame notes the participation of the Bahá‟í community in an
initiative to draft a charter for a “responsible, plural and united world”30.

Associations for Bahá'í Studies

There are now at least twenty Associations for Bahá'í Studies worldwide31,
some of which maintain homepages.32 A few, but not all, of their homepages
provide bibliographic information about their respective publications.

Bahá’í communities

The websites of Baha‟i communities are listed at numerous sites on the web.
Two comprehensive sites are www.bcca.org and www.bahaidirectory.org,
while of course Casper Voogt‟s site, www.bahaindex.com, is an invaluable
source for all manner of information on Bahá‟í communities and activities.
Entire websites can be copied using such feely available software tools as
winHTTrack. Individual pages can be selectively copied with such
commercially available software as Web Research Professional.

Official Documents

Official documents include statutes, court judgements, and very many other
types of bureaucracy-generated documentation. A search on the Lexis
database on January 24, 2003 (Commonwealth and Irish Cases, Combined -
Grouped by Country – Bahá‟í) yielded 85 references; numerous judgements
from US courts have Bahá‟í references; the findings of all Australian
judicial environments are searchable over the internet (austlii.com.au),
including refugee and immigration tribunals, which are a particularly
fruitful source of information. A significant number of references in official
documents at all levels of the US government can be found by searching
firstgov.gov. United Nations Documents are a fertile source of Bahá‟í
references. The holdings of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld Library
are available through UNBISnet - Bibliographic Search. A significant
number of documents are available through careful searching at the UN site:
www.un.org

Digital libraries

Most internet-based databases are only available through subscription. They
may be better described as „portals‟ through which a far greater number of
individual databases are made available. Some of these individual titles are
accessible through a number of databases or portals, and quite a few
commenced long before the Internet age. The database FirstSearch, for
instance, includes a large subset of discipline-specific databases. A search on

The internet addresses for these associations are listed at such sites as http://www.bahai-studies.org/
and http://www.bahai-studies.ca/affiliates.php

An incomplete list of Associations for Bahá'í Studies includes Africa; Australia; Chile; United
Kingdom; French Speaking Europe; German Speaking Europe; India; Japan; Malaysia; New Zealand; North
America; Northern Mariana Islands; Persian Language; Philippines; Russia; Singapore; and Venezuela

21st March 2000 in the World Catalogue yielded 1939 records, including 37
for 1999. The database “Paper1st” yielded 13 papers; CWI - Contemporary
Women's Issues on health and human rights – yielded 9 references; and
Librarylit - Materials on libraries and librarianship – found 3 references.

The accompanying graphic shows a search for “Bahá‟í” in the commercially
available library, Questia (www.questia.com). This search on 5th April 2007
yielded 439 references within the full-text of books.

Off-line searching

Computer-based searching need not take place on-line, as there are an
increasing number of software applications that provide searchable
interfaces. These include Mars, Immerse, Bahá‟í Library, and Ocean. Books,
and even the historic periodical Star of the West, are now available on cd-

Implications for search

All of the sources for searching for Baha‟i materials and references noted
above suggest that the field of possibilities is expanding exponentially. The
serious researcher must keep track of search activities completed to ensure
minimal duplication of effort at a later date. To store references and
materials, bibliographic software is essential. I use Endnote, although other
packages are also available. In addition to capturing references with this
bibliographic software, I record searches in an Excel file.

Tabs are used in Excel for different categories of search (such as alert
services, bibliographies, bookshops, dissertation indexes, search engines,
etc) and on each tabbed page a list is kept of the site searched, the date of
search, and the number of references found.

Although source materials for Bahá‟í scholarship are becoming more
accessible a range of resources that are essential to Bahá‟í scholarship
including Bahá‟í journals, out of print books, and much primary data,
remain hard to access. Despite the recent expansion of access there remains
no central indexing system, no central clearing house, and there is need for a
systematic project to compile a Bahá‟í bibliography on global scale.

Accessing Literature on the Baha'i
Faith: Emerging Search
Technologies

GRAHAM HASSALL

Abstract
This article surveys some current search technologies that can be used to find
documentation on the Baha'f religion. The capacity to search and retrieve docu-
ments has increased at a phenomenal pace in the past three decades. Search tech-
nologies have multiplied and become more both_ effective and more accessible.
Emphasis has shifted from seeking information toward making the best use of the
information found. Deeper access to information has expanded the range of
research questions that we may dare to ask
