### Full abstract of paper (see above PDF for complete paper)

Both African Traditional Religion (ATR) and the Bahá'i Faith (BF) originate from the same source, God, but at different times in the evolution of humankind. The former precedes the latter in time. Since God is the source of mysteries and is, indeed, mystery itself, the two religions are essentially mystic in nature. Owing to this common origin, the two have much in common. But owing to the time variable, their concepts and practices are different from each other. The Bahá'i Faith teaches mysticism but does not expressly classify the types found in its teachings. In comparing the two religions on this theme, the approach adopted is to determine a Bahá'i classification system and then to fit the ATR concepts into this system. Attempting this exercise is the object of this paper. According to this research work, there are six classes of mysticism in the Bahá'i teachings. They are defined as follows:  
  
Class One or True Mysticism. The ecstatic joy that results from communion with the Souls of the Manifestations leading to physical martyrdom or the living of a life of self-sacrifice and saintliness . This is a more refined state of Incipient True Mysticism.  
  
Class Two or Incipient True Mysticism — The state of spiritual communion or feeling (which is the core of religious faith) uniting man with God, and which can be chiefly brought about and maintained by means of worship, prayer and meditation, for the sake of union with God and the acquisition of human virtues and powers for the development of the individual and society.  
  
Class Three or Cognitive or Coronary Mysticism. The realm of spiritual meanings and realities not apparent to the senses or obvious to the intelligence. This has to do with reflection upon scriptural and religious writings, i.e., the mystic meanings of the words and symbols in the Holy Writ, the profound emanations of sages and mystics, or the spiritual significance of certain religious acts.  
  
Class Four or Biological and Societal Mysticism. The adolescent, developmental stage of an individual or the stage \`in the evolution of the organisation of human society... \`...in the collective life of mankind,...endowing the whole human race with such potentialities of well-being as shall provide, ... the chief incentive required for the eventual fulfillment of its high destiny.  
  
Class Five or Natural or Mundane Mysticism. Concepts and practices not purely for union with God and the development of human virtues, but aimed basically at solving mundane and orthodox occult problems and, in some cases, keeping harmony between the living world on one hand, and the spirit world and ancestors on the other. These concepts are, largely, either upheld by the Bahá'i teachings or are neutral. They are basically true.  
  
Class Six or Orthodox Occultism. Concepts and practices not purely for union with God and the development of human virtues, but aimed basically at giving free rein to the ego, or at seeking to appear mysterious and powerful before other mortals. They are often used for nefarious or inimical activities, and are either prohibited by the Bahá'i teachings or discouraged. They are also mainly true, but some aspects of some of these concepts are false.  
  
The ATR concepts can be fitted into this Bahá'i classification as follows:  
  
Class One. Ecstatic joy resulting in physical martyrdom or the living of a life of saintliness and self-sacrifice.  
  
Class Two. WORSHIP, PRAYER, Meditation (B), and Self-sacrifice (B).  
  
Class Three. The comprehension of the hidden, inner meanings of scriptural and religious writings and acts.  
  
Class Four. Adolescence in the individual and in society.  
  
Class Five. MIRACLES, Medicine (A), TRADITIONAL MEDICINE, THE GIFT OF HEALING, HERBALISM, SOOTHSAYING, ANCESTRAL REVERENCE, DREAMS and VISIONS, TALISMANS and CHARMS, Protection against knife cuts and bullets(A), Libation (A), Animal sacrifice (A), OTHER OFFERINGS (A).  
  
Class Six. Black magic (A), Witchcraft (A), Sorcery(A), Necromancy(A), Mediumship (A), Spirit-possession(A), Dreams and Visions(A), Talismans, Charms and Spells (A).  
  
As conclusion, mysticism in the Bahá'i Faith can be classified into six classes in descending order of importance, using as criterion the essential objective of the concept or practice and its vitality in the fulfilment of the purpose for which man was created, which is, to know God and to worship Him directly and indirectly by serving his fellow creatures.  
  
Class One mysticism has no parallel in ATR. Class Two mysticism is common to both religions insofar as worship and prayer are concerned in basic principles. Class Three mysticism is also shared by both religions, but the basis of the essentials of this class is less authentic in ATR, limiting the sayings and acts in ATR to the emanations of sages, mystics, and religious leaders. Class Four mysticism is shared by both only insofar as in ATR, adolescence or the coming of age in the individual's life is concerned. Almost all the concepts in ATR fit into classes five and six of this classification system.  
  
NB: Concepts in capital letters apply to both religions; concepts in small letters and (A) are either solely or mainly of ATR; concepts in small letters and (B) are either solely or mainly of the Bahá'i Faith.

                            Mysticism i n African Traditiona l Religion

Mysticism in African Traditional Religion and in the Bahá’í Faith:
Classification of Concepts and Practices

by Enoch N. Tanyi

Introduction

t can be inferred from the Bahá’í Writings that African Traditional Religion (henceforth, “ATR”) is divine in

I   its origin. Two passages are cited below in support of this inference:

> [T]he peoples of the world, of whatever race or religion, derive their inspiration from one heavenly Source
> . . .1
> [T]he divers communions of the earth, and the manifold systems of religious belief . . . have proceeded
> from one Source . . . 2
The Bahá’í Faith further teaches that:
The Bahá’í Faith, like all other Divine Religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character. 3

> African Traditional Religion can, therefore, also be said to be mystical in character.

As the topic implies, the object of this paper is to classify the concepts and practices of mysticism in both
religions. But, to class ify in what manner?

To answer this question, the author is presenting four main steps:
> i.     to examine the dictionary or popular understanding of the term mysticism
> ii.    to determine the classification or major types of mysticism as derived from the Bahá’í Writings
> iii.   to locate or identify the concepts in ATR can be considered “mystical”
iv.    to place the ATR concepts within the classification derived from Bahá’í Writings.

Following these four steps, the concepts of mysticism in ATR are classified in the light of the Bahá’í teach-
ings.

The Meanings of the Term “Mysticism”

A look at the dictionary meaning of the word mysticism would lead us to also seek the meanings of the words
mystical, mystic, magic, and occult. The meanings are as follows:

> mysticism n. 1: the experience of mystical union or direct communion with ultimate reality reported by
> mystics 2a: religion based on mystical communion b: a theory of mystical knowledge 3a: obscure or irra-
> tional speculation b: a theory postulating the possibility of direct and intuitive acquisition of ineffable
> knowledge or power.
> mystical adj. 1: having a spiritual meaning or reality that is neither apparent to the senses nor obvious to
> the intelligence 2a: of, relating to, or resulting from an individual’s direct communion with God or ultimate
> reality b: based upon intuition, insight, or similar subjective experience 3. UNINTELLIGIBLE, CRYPTIC
> 4: MYSTIC 2.
> mystic adj. 1: MYSTICAL 1 2: of or relating to mysteries or esoteric rites: OCCULT 3: of or relating to
> mysticism or mystics 4a: MYSTERIOUS b: ENIGMATIC, OBSCURE c: Inducing a feeling of awe or
> wonder d: having magical properties.
> magic n. 1a: the use of means (as charms, spells) believed to have supernatural power over natural forces
> . . . 2a: an extraordinary power or influence seemingly from a supernatural source b: something that seems
> to cast a spell: ENCHANTMENT

Lights of ‘Irfán

> occultism n. a belief in or study of supernatural powers and the possibility of subjecting them to human
> control.
> occult adj. 1: not revealed. Secret 2: ABSTRUSE, MYSTERIOUS 3: not able to be seen or detected: con-
> cealed 4: of or relating to supernatural agencies, their effects, and knowledge of them.4

An examination of the words mysticism, mystical, and mystic reveals six key features associated with the
word or concept mysticism. They are:

> 1.    the experience of mystical union or direct communion with ultimate reality,
> 2.    inducing a feeling of awe or wonder,
3.    having a spiritual meaning or reality that is neither apparent to the senses nor obvious to the intel-

ligence,
> 4.    anything based upon intuition, insight, or similar subjective experience,
> 5.    of or relating to mysteries or esoteric rites: occult,
6.    having magical powers.

In this paper, the first two features would constitute what this author terms types one and two mysticism.

The third and the fourth features constitute the third type of mysticism. The fourth type mysticism is unique
and not des cribed in the dictionary as mysticism. Features five and six form the fifth and the sixth type mysti-
cism collectively, not respectively.

The Types of Mysticism—A Classification Inferred from Bahá’í Writings
There are six types or classes of mysticism:

Class One or “True Mysticism” : The ecs tatic joy that results from communion with the Souls of the
Manifestations leading to physical martyrdom5 or the living of a life of self-sacrifice and saintliness .6 This is a
more refined state of Incipient True Mysticism. (The meaning of self-sacrifice is explained under the discus-
sion on self-surrender and in note 1.)

Class Two or “Incipient True Mysticism” : The state of spiritual communion or feeling (which is the core of
religious faith) which can be chiefly brought about and maintained by means of worship, prayer and medita-
tion, for the sake of union with God and the acquis ition of human virtues and powers for the development of
the individual and society. 7

Class Three or “Cognitive or Coronary Mysticism” : The realm of spiritual meanings and realities not appar-
ent to the senses or obvious to the intelligence. This has to do with reflection upon s criptural and religious writ-
ings, and striving to unravel the abstruse or the mystic meanings of the words and symbols in the Holy Writ,
the profound emanations of sages and mystics, or the spiritual significance of certain religious acts. (The rea-
son for describing this type of mysticism as “coronary” is explained in note 4.)

Class Four or “Biological and Societal Mysticism” : This is the adolescent, developmental stage of an indi-
vidual or the stage

> in the evolution of the organisation of human society . . . in the collective life of mankind . . . endowing
> the whole human race with such potentialities of well-being as shall provide . . . the chief incentive
> required for the eventual fulfillment of its high destiny. 8

Class Five or “Natural” or “Mundane Mysticism” : Mystic concepts and practices not purely for communion
with God and the development of human virtues, but aimed basically at solving mundane and orthodox occult
problems and, in some cases, keeping harmony between the living world on one hand, and the world of spirit
and the spirit of ancestors on the other. These concepts are, largely, either upheld in a general way by the
Bahá’í teachings or they are neutral, meaning that the Bahá’í teachings are silent over them. They are basical-
ly true.

Class Six or “Orthodox Occultism” : Mystic concepts and practices not purely for union with God and the
development of human virtues, but aimed basically at giving free rein to the ego, or at seeking to appear mys-

\[156\] Mysticism i n African Traditiona l Religion

terious and powerful before other mortals. They are often used for nefarious or inimical activities, and are
either prohibited by the Bahá’í teachings or discouraged.

Having outlined a Bahá’í classification of mysticism, the next task is to identify African Traditional
Religion’s concepts of mysticism. After consulting a number of books,9 the concepts mentioned are: Ancestral
Reverence, Dreams and Visions, Healing, Herbalism, Libation, Magic, Medicine, Miracles, Prayer, Sacrifice,
Soothsaying, Sorcery, Spirit-possession, Traditional medicine, Talismans and Charms, Witchcraft and Worship.
Ancestral Reverence, in this author’s opinion, is implicit in ATR mysticism. This theme is, usually, not treated
under mystical or mysterious forces.
The Application of the Terms “Mystic,” “Occult,” and “Psychic” to Cultural Practices

This classification was made because there is no explicit, authoritative Bahá’í clas sification. The difficulty
of applying such terms as mystic, occult, and psychic to cultural practices is acknowledged by the Research
Department of the Universal Hous e of Justice in the extract below:

> We have not been able to locate any explicit definition of “occult” in the Bahá’í Writings. While we under-
> stand the difficulties which can arise when one tries to apply such terms as “psychic” and “occult” to spe-
> cific cultural practices, the most explicit guidance we have located appears in the statement from the
> Universal House of Justice letter quoted . . . 10(as):
> It is clear that what ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi had in mind when warning the believers against
> meddling with psychic forces were those that spiritualists believe come from a deliberate effort on the part
> of individuals to establish communication with the departed. 11
The guidance then continues that

> [T]he meaning of “mystic” is dependent upon the context in which it occurs. Occasionally “occult” and
> “mystic” do refer to the same type of phenomena. For example . . . we are discouraged from seeking
“occult experiences” and “the hearing of mystic voices. . . .”12

On the other hand, “mystic” is also used to refer to a very different sphere of human experience, the reality
and importance of which is frequently emphasized. For example, in another statement we are encouraged to seek
“that mystical feeling that unites man with God” and to “cultivate the sense of spirituality through meditation
and prayer,

> [f]or the core of religious faith is that mystic feeling that unites man with God. . . . Otherwise religion will
degenerate into a mere organization, and become a dead thing.13

The epitome of this guidance is that mystic has two major meanings. In one sense, it is synonymous with
“occult.” This meaning of the concept mystic or occult includes psychicism or ps ychic phenomena. The con-
cepts in this group are discouraged. In the second major sense, mystic is not synonymous with “occult,” is
highly encouraged, and seeking this kind of mystic experience is vital to the individual’s spiritual development.
How to identify “that mystic feeling that unites man with God” varies from one individual to the other, and
this is expressed in note 3. The full text of this guidance is reproduced in note 2 for the reader’s benefit.

First and Second Class Mysticism
Worship, Prayer, and Meditation

In this section, two things will be attempted. First of all, the author will try to show that the concepts in each
class really fit into their class by definition. Secondly, the author will try to show whether or not a given con-
cept applies to both religions, and the extent to which it applies.

> The supreme and most exalted goal of man is to get near to and to be united with God. Bahá’u’lláh wrote:
> Let the flame of search burn with such fierceness within your hearts as to enable you to attain your supreme
> and most exalted goal—the station at which ye can draw nigh unto, and be united with, your Best-Beloved.

. . .14
Attaining to this station requires intense search. But we must also learn to commune with the Souls of the
Manifestations of God as they are the intermediaries between us and God, and God cannot be known directly

Lights of ‘Irfán

by us puny mortals. This “True Mysticism” is expressed in the Bahá’í teachings thus:

> We liken God to the Sun, which gives us all our life. So the Spirit of God reaches us through the Souls of
> the Manifestations. We must learn to commune with Their Souls, and this is what the Martyrs seemed to
> have done, and what brought them such ecstasy of joy that life became nothing. This is the true mysticism,
> and the secret, inner meaning of life which humanity has at present, drifted so far from. 15

True mysticism is not mentioned in the African Traditional Religions. The class of Bahá’í mysticism to
which ATR gets very close is the less refined, lower degree, second class or “Incipient True M ysticism.” To
attain this state of communion and union with God, this Incipient True Mysticism, the best and the chief instru-
ment is worship (respect or reverence paid to a divine being or a form of religious practice with its creed and
ritual) which includes prayer and meditation. Meditation, as a spiritual exercise, is not stressed at all in ATR.
The converse is true in the Bahá’í teachings. The cardinal role of worship—which includes prayer and medi-
tation—in mysticism are made clear in reference number 17. In ATR, worship and prayer are basic in mysti-
cism, as can be seen in this passage of Mbiti in which he defines worship as

a means of renewing contact between people and God, or between people and the invisible world.16
Self-Surrender

Essentially united with God through wors hip, prayer, and meditation, is self-surrender, for this quality is
absolutely essential for the attainment of union with God. The Bahá’í teachings say that:

> By self-surrender and perpetual union with God is meant that men should merge their will wholly in the
> Will of God, and regard their desires as utter nothingness beside His Purpose. Whatsoever the Creator com-
> mandeth His creatures to observe, the same must they diligently, and with the utmost joy and eagerness,
arise and fulfil. 17

Essentially, ATR also stresses submission to the Will of God. But with its submission to the dominating
influence of adulteration due to changing times and minds divergent from the original teachings, whatever they
might have been, we have in the tenets of ATR, concepts and practices which are at variance with the Will of
God.

Third Class or Cognitive Mysticism

African Traditional Religion has no Holy Scripture as such, in the sense of a Bible for Christians or the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas for the Bahá’ís, but its proverbs, songs and emblems contain great wisdom that might be traced to a
divine Source.

> An example of a wise saying from Sierra Leone, in West Africa, is
> If God dishes you rice in a basket, do not wish to eat soup!18

One obvious meaning of this proverb is contentment with the Will of God. Pithy though this saying may be,
without the clear backing of authentic scripture, it does not rise above the heaven of poetry.

> On the contrary, this citation from the Bahá’í teachings gives a clear example of the third type of mysticism:
> [T]he heart is endowed with four stages, which would be recounted should a kindred soul be found. 19

How can the heart have four stages? The fact that the Author of this verse states that these four stages of the
heart can only be recounted if a kindred soul is found indicates that the meaning of that citation transcends
human understanding and intelligence.

Fourth Class or Biological and Societal Mysticism

> In the Bahá’í teachings, coming of age, adolescence, is described as:
> That mystic, all-pervasive, yet indefinable change, which we associate with the stage of maturity inevitable
> in the life of the individual and . . . must . . . have its counterpart in the evolution of the organisation of
> human society.20
This stage is, therefore, considered to form a special class of mysticism.

According to the Bahá’í teachings, for the individual, this is the age of spiritual maturity fixed at the age of

\[158\] Mysticism i n African Traditiona l Religion

fifteen: “it marks that point in life at which the believer takes firmly into his own hands the responsibility for
his spiritual destiny. At age fifteen, the individual has the privilege of affirming, in his own name, his faith in
Bahá’u’lláh.”21 Starting from this age, the recitation of the obligatory prayer is obligatory, 22 fasting during the
prescribed month of fasting is binding, 23 marriage may be contracted, 24 the obligatory, congregational Prayer
for the Dead must be recited for the departed before burial,25 and the burial ring worn on the finger of the
corpse before burial. 26 Administratively, this is the age for the assumption of some administrative responsibil-
ities, precisely, serving on committees. 27

The significance of the age of maturity, however, goes far beyond the fulfillment of responsibilities. The fol-
lowing extract from a tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá links the attainment of maturity with the deepening of one’s under-
standing and comprehension of the realities of life, and the enhancement of one’s very capacity for understand-
ing:

> Know thou that before maturity man liveth from day to day and comprehendeth only such matters as are
> superficial and outwardly obvious. However, when he cometh of age he understandeth the realities of
> things and the inner truths. Indeed, in his comprehension, his feelings, his deductions and his discoveries,
> every day of his life after maturity is equal to a year before it. 28
In the collective life of human society, this is the stage “endowing the whole human race with such poten -
tialities of well-being as shall provide . . . the chief incentive required for the eventual fulfillment of its high
destiny.2 9 This Bahá’í meaning of mysticism in the collective life of mankind has no parallel in ATR. But on
the individual plane, this period in ATR is referred to as the initiation period, and in

> . . . that period a person goes through physical, emotional and psychological changes, which take him from
> childhood to adolescence and adulthood. 31

Fifith Class, Natural or Mundane Mysticism
Medicine

> In African Traditional Religion, medicine is defined differently from medicine in the Wes tern culture, as
> the use of the neutral, vital, supernatural force in the universe to fight witchcraft, to diagnose and to cure
> diseases, to prepare good luck charms, and, in some cases, to cause harm.31

The definition above tells us that the main thrust of medicine in ATR is to solve mundane and orthodox
occult problems, and, not to seek union with God or to acquire human virtues.

Considering this definition from the Bahá’í point of view, three elements have to be addressed—the nature
of the supernatural force, the fight against witchcraft, the diagnosis and the cure of dis eases, the preparation of
good luck charms, and the causing of harm. If this supernatural force is from the invocation of the spirit of the
departed, which is strongly discouraged (see section under necromancy), whatever use that force is put to can-
not be approved. But if this supernatural force is from s ome other source, its effects are acceptable. The aspects
of fighting witchcraft, diagnosing and curing dis eases, and the preparation of good luck charms are discussed
in this paper. Even though no religion approves of causing harm to any soul, power in the hands of either a
Bahá’í or a non-Bahá’í can be misused. Medicine may, therefore, either be upheld or disapproved of by the
Bahá’í teachings depending upon the source of the supernatural force animating the work of the medicine man.
Traditional Medicine

In ATR, traditional medicine “is the art of using the available forces of nature to prevent diseases and to
restore and preserve health.” 32 Traditional medicine men, therefore, “carr y out the work of healing the sick . .
.”33 Persistent and serious complaints are “usually said to be magic, sorcery, witchcraft, broken taboos or the
work of spirits.”34 In this case, the medicine man “prescribes a cure which may include herbs, religious ritu -
als and the observance of certain prohibitions or directions.” 35

Traditional medicine, therefore, entails healing the sick and fighting witchcraft and sorcery.

> As for the aspect of healing the sick, the Bahá’í Faith teaches that:
> It is clear from . . . statements made by the Guardian, as well as from the practice of Bahá’u’lláh, the
> Master and the Guardian himself, that by “a scientific system of medicine” he was not limiting this choice

Lights of ‘Irfán

> to the medical theories currently dominant in western countries. The House of Justice, therefore, does not
> exclude the use of traditional native healers, . . . There is, nevertheless, an important borderline between
> unorthodox medical practice and sheer quackery or superstition, and this we should be careful not to
cross.36

As to the matter of fighting witchcraft and sorcery, the Bahá’í Faith acknowledges the existence of these
forces and recommends the method of quelling them.

The Bahá’í teachings state that there is no independent force of evil in the world. However, there are nega-
tive forces which are described as evil and which can affect an individual adversely. It is reassuring to note that
in a letter of 26 November 1939 written on behalf of the Guardian to an individual believer there appears the
statement:

> Evil forces do take control of our life, but it is within our power to free ourselves from falling under their
> s u b j e c t i o n . 37

How to free one’s self from falling under their subjection is elaborated on the same page in which reference
43 is found and in another memorandum dated 13 June 1999. To enter into the details would be a digression.

It can be seen from the above discuss ion that the concept of traditional medicine is common to both reli-
gions even though they differ from each other in some details of practices. It can als o be seen that the main
objective of traditional medicine is to solve mundane problems, and not to seek union with God or to acquire
human virtues. It, therefore, falls under the fifth class .
The Gift of Healing

In several African s ocieties, there are people reputed to be solely healers, and to possess the gift of healing
which they may harness by any method, one of which is the laying on of hands or massaging the affected part.

As to a definition of the “gift of healing,” the Research Department wrote that it “ . . . has not found a pre -
cise definition of the phrase ‘the gift of healing’ in the Bahá’í Writings.” 38 Even though there is no precise def-
inition, there is some guidance:

> The so-called “gift of healing” is a God-given talent. . . . There is nothing in the Teachings to prohibit the
> friends from discovering, either for themselves or with the help of experts if they wish, that they have such
> a gift . . . a Bahá’í is free to practice such powers as long as he does so without attributing his or her pow-
> ers to the Faith or to Bahá’u’lláh. . . . Bahá’ís are free to accept treatment from individuals whom they
> believe to be endowed with such a gift. 39
The guidance further explains that:

> It appears to us that this phrase is associated with different aspects of ‘spiritual’ healing, depending upon
> the context in which it is used.40

With this approval of the gift of healing which, obviously, seeks to heal illnesses and, thus, solve a mundane
problem, this concept fits into the fifth class.
Herbalism

Herbalism, the application of herbs and other plant parts for the treatment of diseases is a common practice
in African societies.

The Bahá’í Faith upholds pure herbalism in the words below:
> Treat disease through diet, by preference, refraining from the use of drugs; and if you find what is required
> in a single herb, do not resort to a compounded medicament.41

But, when herbalism is combined with religious elements,42 the Bahá’í Faith sounds a note of caution in these
words:

> [O]ne must consider the context in which a herbal treatment is used in order to know if it is a simple ther-
> apeutic remedy, or part of some ritualistic practice which may or may not conflict with Bahá’í Teachings.43

Herbalism is directed solely towards s olving physical or mundane problems. It, therefore, comes under the
fifth class mysticism.

\[160\] Mysticism i n African Traditiona l Religion

Soothsaying

Soothsaying, another common practice in traditional African communities , is not condemned in the Bahá’í
teachings. For the Bahá’í view on consulting soothsayers, the Research Department of the Universal House of
Justice says that it is “not aware of texts which specifically prohibit these practices”4 4 and “does not equate
consulting sooths ayers and diviners” with “occult experiences.”45
Ancestral Reverence

> Africans do not worship their departed relatives. It is true that departed relatives are believed to continue
> to live and to show interest in their surviving families. These families may show their belief by building
> shrines for the departed and placing bits of food or drink there or on the graves, and sometimes mention-
> ing them in their prayers.46
> The Bahá’í Faith upholds the importance of remembering one’s forebears, especially one’s parents, and in
making certain types of offerings in their names. 47

Some of these offerings are “charity and beneficence” and the imploration of “pardon and remission of
sins.”48

Even though “With regard to the question of ancestor rituals, the Research Department has not, to date,
been able to locate any statement in the Bahá’í Writings . . .” 49 the reader has been given general guidelines
with respect to determining the acceptability of cultural practices, including ancestor ritual:

> Bahá’ís should be encouraged to preserve their inherited cultural identities, as long as the activities
involved do not contravene the principles of the Faith.50

Looking at the texts above, one can say that as far as maintaining a healthy link with one’s ancestors, espe-
cially one’s parents, is concerned, the two religions are in accord. They may only differ insofar as placing bits
of food and sprinkling drops of drink on ancestral graves and shrines is concerned, for these, in the Bahá’í
view, are offerings far inferior to feeding the poor or performing other acts of charity in the name of the ances-
tors. Praying for their soul’s progress and for the remission of their sins are acts common to both religions.

Since ancestral reverence is solely aimed at maintaining harmony with the ancestors , it rightly falls under
class five mysticism.
Talismans and Charms (Religious Articles and Objects)

“Religious articles and objects are many, and we find them in all Afr ican societies.” 51 These objects, also
called talismans and/or charms which

> are empowered magically through the repetition of set words . . . may be used for a variety of purposes:
> attracting a lover, gaining employment, protecting from witchcraft, productivity of gardens, accumulation
> of wealth, protection from sickness and . . . to protect warriors from . . . bullets in modern warfare. 52
> Though discussion of talismans is rare in the Bahá’í writings, their use was upheld by the earlier teach-
> ings of the Báb:
> Dieu a fixé pour les gens du Béyán, deux grands bienfaits. . . . C’est le <héikel> pour les hommes. . . Pour
> les spectacles du Bá (les femmes), il a permis des cercles. . . . 53

This author translates this passage as: “God has ordained for the people of Bayán, two great blessings. . . . It
is the pentacle for men . . . For (women), He has permitted circles.”

> The influence to be exerted by these objects is also mentioned. For the pentacles of men:
> Tout ce qu’on écrira dans ces <héikèl>, l’influence s’en manifestera sur la personnalité de celui qui l’au-
> ra écrit, mot pour mot, point par point.54
This translates as:

> The influence of all that is written in these pentacles will be manifested word for word, point by point, on
> the personality of the writer.

For women, the influence of the circles is to protect them morally:

Lights of ‘Irfán

> “ces cercles les protégent moralement.”55
> In the Bahá’í Faith, there is also
> a charm-like prayer, in pentacle form, for protection. It is called Du’áy-i-Haykal (Prayer of Haykal).
> Bahá’u’lláh‘ . . . has given . . . instructions on how this prayer should be copied, in what color and with
what kind of ink, and how it should be carried. 56

The two religions are in agreement on this theme. But, in the Bahá’í Faith there is room for ascending to
class one mysticism if the writer of the talisman beseeches God for spiritual qualities and for martyrdom and
through prayer.
Protection against Knife Cuts and Bullets

Some African native doctors specialize, among others, in giving treatments that protect the user from knife
cuts and bullets.

From the Bahá’í view, the Research Department, referring to a letter from the Universal House of Justice
answered that:

> The Salient point . . . seems to be the distinction between something that is prescribed as a simple thera-
> peutic remedy and something that is taken as part of a religious ritual as a form of sacrament.’ We note,
> also, that the House of Justice points out that there is “an important borderline between unorthodox med-
> ical practice and sheer quackery or superstition, and this we should be careful not to cross.” 57

Protection against knife cuts and bullets is to attain a mundane goal. It has nothing to do with seeking com-
munion with God.
Libation

> This is the act of pouring some liquid to the spirits and the act is accompanied by a prayer. 58

The concept of libation is not mentioned in the Bahá’í teachings . The place of prayer in the Bahá’í teach-
ings has already been discussed. Libation is, therefore, a purely ATR concept. Its significance “lies in the belief
that since the liquid softens the ground, it symbolically opens the way to the presence of the divine Power or
powers.” 59 Libation, in essence, is, therefore, a symbol.
Animal Sacrifice

“Sacrifice is the act of offering the life of an animal or person, or some object to the divine Power or pow -
ers.” 60 This offering is also made to deities, divinities, ancestors and kings.

The object of offering sacrifice is to maintain
> contact or communion between the divine and man. It serves as the best way through which man maintains
> an established relationship between himself and his object of worship. 61
> On the matter of sacrifice, the Research Department wrote that:
> The sacrifice of animals is an ancient custom and a familiar theme in the history of religion. 62
The Bahá’í Faith further explains this symbol in this way:

> Just as the sheep sacrificed its life, likewise this natural state of man, which is the animalistic state, must
> be sacrificed. How should it be sacrificed? The vices of the animalistic state of man must be entirely anni-
> hilated, and he must be characterized with divine virtues. 63
> With the . . . greater spiritual maturity of the people, the symbolic act of self-sacrifice largely replaced the
sacrificial animals, and it is this symbolic act that is most acceptable in this Day.64

This means that the sacrifice of animals is a reminder that human beings must completely overcome their
evil qualities and replace them with virtues. Clearly, therefore, human sacrifice is at variance with the Bahá’í
teachings and animal sacrifice is abrogated. Its major objective is conciliation and propitiation with the divine
which could have made it class one mysticis m. But the fact that it is just a symbol makes it fitted for class five
mysticism.

\[162\] Mysticism i n African Traditiona l Religion

Other Offerings

The offerings considered here are bits of food, and alcohol. This has been treated under Ancestral
Reverence.

> The Bahá’í Faith upholds the importance of remembering one’s forebears, especially one’s parents, and in
> making certain types of offerings in their names. 65
These are:

> the intercession and the sincere prayers of other human souls, or through the charities and important good
> works which are performed in its name.66

Offerings are, therefore, made in both religions, but the nature differs from one to the other.
Dreams and Visions

> Like many other peoples, Africans consider dreams a method by which the ancestral spirits can communi-
> cate with the living. . . . Dreams are usually taken seriously. 67

This definition is limited because, in reality, dreams are also considered to be a method by which God com-
municates with the living. The same definition applies to visions. Therefore, both terms are used synony-
mously. Dreams and visions in ATR can be evoked after certain traditional practices. It could be the wearing
of a special talisman before going to bed. The powers of this talisman then enable the wearer to receive what-
ever message is communicated or revealed to him.

Dreams and visions are very important in the Bahá’í Faith. It is considered to be “the most mysterious of
the signs of God amongst men.” 68

> The Bahá’í Faith teaches that:
> There are three kinds of visions or dreams. First, those that arise from over-excited nerves, or disordered
> stomach, and of no use whatever. Second, when God sends a revelation to a soul that is not entirely pure
> from the world: to such an one He sends visions in symbols and signs, and these experiences need an inter-
> preter. The third kind is when a soul who is severed from the world receives a revelation from God. In this
> station everything is clear and pure and needs no explanation. 69

In the Bahá’í Faith, therefore, not all dreams should be taken seriously. Those that are due to over-excited
nerves, if they can be identified, must be discarded. Those that are symbolic must be handled with caution
because they need an infallible interpreter. The third type is clear and needs no explanation.
The Bahá’í Faith teaches further that

> there can be, under certain rare circumstances . . . communion with some soul gone before into the invis-
> ible world, but that most of this type of experience which people often claim to have with departed souls
> is nothing but the product of their own imaginations—however real it may seem to them to be. 70

It is possible, the Bahá’í Faith teaches, to receive communication with the soul of the departed even though
this experience is rare. There are instances in Africa were people have been instructed in dreams by some
ancestor and taught the cure for certain ailments .

In the Bahá’í Faith, dreams and visions are not to be sought by any means unless they occur by themselves .
This is what it says:

> When a person endeavors to develop faculties so that they might enjoy visions, dreams, etc., actually what
> they are doing is weakening certain of their spiritual capacities; and thus under such circumstances, dreams
> and visions have no reality, and ultimately lead to the destruction of the character of the person. 71

To summarize, both religions, in principle, share in the belief in dreams and visions. But the Bahá’í Faith,
unlike the ATR, identifies three types of dreams, teaches that the type due to over-excited nerves or disordered
stomach are useless. The second type, symbolic dreams, if properly interpreted may lead one into the third,
second and first class mysticism, inasmuch as they lead one to truth and to seeking closer union with God. The
third type of dreams is clear and needs no interpretation. It “comes to an individual through the grace of God.
. .” 72 It often leads to truth.

When either of the two true dream-types comes to an individual involuntarily, it is desirable; if evoked by
some rituals, it is harmful to the soul of the individual.

Because dreams and visions also have the attribute of the second and the third class mysticism, it makes it
difficult to restrict it to class five mysticism. On the other hand, because it can be evoked—and, this seems to
be the more common practice in society—often for mundane or orthodox occult reasons having little or noth-
ing to do with the sanctification of the soul, this concept is classed under class five mysticism.
Miracles or Supernatural Acts

> Miracles is a concept that runs through many other concepts in African Traditional Religion.

The Bahá’í Faith teaches about miracles attributed to the Manifestations of God as proof of Their role, and
about those attributed to conjurors. For the first case, it teaches that:

> Our purpose is not to deny such miracles; our only meaning is that they do not constitute decisive proofs,
> and that they have an inner significance. 73
For the second case, the Bahá’í Faith states that:

Extraordinary feats have also been related to some conjurors. 74
It goes on to state that:

> The outward miracles have no importance for the people of reality. If a blind man receives sight, for exam-
> ple, he will finally again become sightless, for he will die and be deprived of all his senses and powers.
> Therefore, causing the blind man to see is comparatively of little importance, for this faculty of sight will
at last disappear.75

This statement should not be taken too far out of the context. True, if a man has protection against knife cuts
or bullets, he would eventually die of some other cause. But in the situation of civil disorder and traditional
warfare, one can countenance this feat.

One effect of miracles, though, is that they fill some people with awe and bafflement at the omnipotence of
God. Even the virgin birth of Jesus Christ is no proof of His Manifestation. But it fills one with awe and
reminds one of the supremacy of God— “ God does what He will. 76

Miracles are not performed with the objective of attaining union with God, but for the purpose of solving
mundane problems. For thes e reasons they fall under class five mysticism.

Class Six Mysticism or Orthodox Occultism
Magic, Witchcraft (or Wizardry) and Sorcery

In African Traditional Religion, “Magic can be defined as an attempt by man to tap and control . . . super -
natural powers or resources of the universe for his own benefit.” White magic is “primarily used for protec -
tion against the evil forces that are found everywhere.”77 Black magic “is intended primarily to harm people
and property.”78 “Sorcery is defined as the use of black magic and medicines against others.” 79 Witchcraft “is
a manifestation of . . . mystical forces which may be inborn in a person, inherited or acquired in various
ways.” 80 It is distinct from sorcery. “Its distinctive feature is that there is no palpable apparatus connected with
it, no rites, ceremonies, incantations or invocations that the witch has to perform.”81

More informative than these rather vague definitions is the popular observation that these phenomena are
often practised with evil intent.

These concepts are not specifically defined in the Bahá’í teachings, and no clear synonymy exists between
witchcraft and psychic forces (see note 5), but the elements involved, except for white magic, are worth not-
ing. Some guidance is given below:

> [T]he term “voodoo” generally refers to a variety of practices often including sorcery, the supposed sum-
> moning of spirits, elaborate rituals, and animal sacrifices. While nothing has been found in the Bahá’í
> Writings specifically on the set of beliefs and practices which make up voodoo, Bahá’ís can readily use the
> authoritative texts of the Faith as a standard with which to assess the various elements of voodoo.82

\[164\] Mysticism i n African Traditiona l Religion

Since voodoo involves summoning spirits, practising elaborate rituals and doing evil, it would seem quite
justified to pros cribe these concepts and practices. The Universal House of Justice, referring to ju-ju and
magic, a reference that very well applies to witchcraft, sorcery and ps ychic forces, wrote: “. . . educate the
friends to avoid such practices . . .” 83

The purport of the above concepts is to do evil, seeking, therefore, to accentuate the ego of the practitioner.

It therefore fits this definition of orthodox mysticism.
Necromancy

Necromancy is s ynonymous to psychicism in the Bahá’í teachings. It is the practice of summoning spirits .

As stated in reference numbers 16 and 93 (below), the believers are strongly warned against summoning the
spirits of the departed.

The mere fact that necromancy is proscribed qualifies it for class six mysticism.

Mediumship
“Mediums are people who get in touch with the spirit world.” 84 If this connection is made involuntarily, the
Bahá’í teachings are not against it. But if this connection is cultivated, the Bahá’í Faith is against it. It says
that:

> What ‘Abdu’l-Bahá always pointed out in this matter is that these psychic powers were not to be used in
> this world, and that, indeed, it was dangerous to cultivate them here. They should be left dormant, and not
> exploited, even when we do so with the sincere belief we are helping others. . . .

> If children are inclined to be psychic they should not be blamed for it too harshly; they should not be
encouraged to strengthen their powers in this direction. 85

It is commonly observed that this faculty is often cultivated. For this reason, mediumship is against the
Bahá’í teachings and placed under class six mysticism. A hint to this understanding is found in the refusal of
the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith to accept a medium into his fold. He telegraphed:

CONCERNING MEDIUM DO NOT ADVISE ACCEPTANCE MEMBERSHIP.86
Spirit Possession

This is a rather vexed theme. There are, generally speaking, two types of spirit-posses sion. One type is
described below:

> Amid dancing, drumming, and the carrying of carved objects . . . the deity will descend upon a devotee. .
> . . ,she or he will gasp ecstatically and go limp, then suddenly leap into tremendous activity and take on
> the characteristics of the spirit. . . . People may ask questions of the possessed and receive answers in the
> name of the divine. 87
The Bahá’í Faith teaches that:

> Regarding the materialization of spirits through mediums: A person finding himself in a state of trance, or
> unconsciousness, is like one who sleeps; whatever he feels and sees he imagines to be matter and of mate-
> rial things, but in reality they are wholly immaterial. 88
> Outside the bounty of the Holy Spirit, whatsoever thou hearest as to the effect of trances, or the mediums’
trumpets, conveying the singing voices of the dead, is imagination pure and simple.89

This statement, perhaps, needs some commentary. Since the Bahá’í teachings mention that the situation out-
side the bounty of the Holy Spirit is pure imagination, this supposes that within the bounty of the Holy Spirit
mediums can have true revelations. But, whatever they perceive is not material: it is spiritual. Like a type two
dream, it needs to be interpreted. And this is where a wide zone is created for groping in the dark.

This type of mediums hip is accepted if it develops involuntarily and if its impressions can be correctly inter-
preted. However, even if its perceptions can be correctly interpreted, it is not permitted to cultivate medi-
umship intentionally. It is also difficult to classify this type as good or evil, as what counts is the kind of com-
munication received and the intention for evoking such influence. It has nothing to do with developing human
virtues.

The second type of spirit-possession is one in which it is believed that supernatural, evil power can possess
one or manipulate one’s behaviour. The Bahá’í Faith teaches that

> the condition of those people who are described in the Gospel as being possessed of devils . . . should be
> interpreted figuratively . . .90
> Here, again, the absence of correct, authoritative interpretation poses difficulties.

Contrary to the meaning of the above statement, the Bahá’í teachings affirm that sometimes people are influ-
enced by evil, supernatural forces. Two relevant citations are found below:

> Evil forces do take control of our life, but it is within our power to free ourselves from falling under their
> s u b j e c t i o n . 91
The second one states that:

> The House of Justice fully appreciates that . . . there are many instances of individuals being affected
> adversely by the psychic arts of the other people. 92

Even though this second type of spirit-possession is true, because it is evil and has nothing to do with acquir-
ing human virtues, it is condemned and, therefore, placed under class six mysticism.
Dreams and Visions

The category of dreams and visions that fall under this class of mysticism is that sought with the aid of some
special rites or practices. Dreams and visions of this type are those that prove harmful to the seeker’s soul. This
has been discussed earlier and is disapproved of.
Talismans and Charms

Talismans and charms appear under this group in the cases where they are used as paraphernalia in orthodox
occult practices aimed at causing evil. The objective for employing them in this case is not to seek communion
with God or to acquire human virtues, but to seek mystic experiences.

Conclusions

Mysticism in the Bahá’í teachings can be placed under six clas ses, which can be placed descending order of
importance. Class one or True mysticism has no parallel in African Traditional Religion. Class two mysticism
is common to both religions insofar as worship and prayer are concerned in basic principles. Class three mys-
ticism is also shared by both religions, but the absence of a proof of a divine, authentic source in ATR, the say-
ings and acts in ATR are limited to the emanations of sages , mystics, and religious leaders. Class four mysti-
cism is shared by both only insofar as in ATR, adoles cence or the coming of age of the individual is concerned.
But, in general, African Traditional Religion does not consider adolescence as mysticism.

It can be seen, therefore, that almost all the concepts in ATR fit into classes five and six. This underlines the
fact that, the older a religion, the further away from the essence of its teachings do the adherents move, thus
calling for its renewal.

In addition, this paper has broadened the understanding of mysticism in African Traditional Religion by
shedding some new light on adolescence, and it has shown the irrelevance of the popular concepts of mysti-
cism in ATR to the spiritual development of the individual and to modern society.

Notes
I. A text that su pports and ex press es reference no. 11 is:

> Sacrifice of life is of two kinds. To be killed fo r the Cause is not so difficult as to live for it in abso lute obedience to the
> commands of God.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Star of the West 5:VIII:6:6 5

The teaching about the symbo lism in animal sacrifice d ates as far as the Old Testament days. But as us ual, humanity quickly turns away

\[168\] Mysticism i n African Traditiona l Religion

fro m the essence of the teachings o f God, and holds o n to su perstition . The Book of Psalms, in chap ter 50 verses 8-13 and chapter 51 verse
16, tells us th at God does n ot need animal sacrifice. The sacrifice that is acceptable to Him is indicated in vers es 14 and 15 of the s ame
chapter in these words:

Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to th e M ost High . . .
Ps alm 51 v erse 17, gives us more guidance on the acceptable sacrifice:

The sacrifice acceptable to God is a brok en s pirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt n ot despis e . . .

‘Abd u’l-Bah á clarifies the meanin g of thanksgiving in these words:

> In this day, to thank God for His bounties consis teth in pos sessing a radian t heart, and a soul open to the promptings of
> the sp irit. This is the essence of thanksgiv ing.

Selections fro m the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 179, no. 153.
This u nderstanding ties in with the second meaning of sacrifice g iving b y ‘Abdu’l-Bahá above, for sacrifice in the p ath of God and obe-
dience to His commands mean the same thin g, and it is this obedience or s acrifice that brings ab out a pure, contrite and radiant heart.

Thus, even before the Bah á’í Dis pens ation, God had revealed the s ymbolism in animal sacrifice, and taugh t that true sacrifice is the spir-
itual conditions o f poss es sing a pure and radiant heart which come abo ut by keeping one’s vows to God, in other words, obeying God’s com-
mands, and by repenting from one’s sins.

II. The whole of reference number 17, wh ich is a letter dated 8 Decemb er 1935 written on behalf of the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith , is
cited below:

> It is this condition, s o sadly morbid, in to which society has fallen, that religio n seeks to improve and transform. For the
> core of religious faith is that mystic feeling that unites man with God. Th is s tate of sp iritual communio n can be brought
> about and maintained b y means o f meditation and prayer. And this is the reason why Bah á’u’lláh has so much s tres sed the
> importan ce of worship. It is not sufficient for a believer to merely accept and observe the teachings. He s hould, in addi-
> tion, cultivate the sense of spirituality, which he can acquire chiefly by the means of prayer. The Bahá’í Faith, like all other
> Divine religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character. Its chief goal is the development of the individual an d society,
> through the acquisition o f sp iritual virtues and po wers. It is the soul of man th at h as first to be fed. And this spiritual nour-
> ish ment prayer can bes t provid e. Laws and institutions, as viewed by Bahá’u’lláh, can become really effective only when
> our inner spiritual life has been perfected and trans formed. Otherwise religion will degenerate into a mere organization,
> and become a dead thing.

III. A questio n that o ne might naturally ask is how to identify this mystic feeling. The answer to this q uestion is given below:

> With regard to Mr. . . . ’s question about how one can identify “that mystic feeling that unites man with God,” it is the
> view of th e Res earch Department that the answer is to be derived from perso nal meditation and may well be different for
> each person.

A memorand um from the Research Department of the Universal House of J ustice dated 9 April 1996.

IV. The third clas s of mysticism is given the adjective “coron ary” because this class deals with understanding scripture, and several refer-
ences in scripture show that the heart is the seat o f un derstanding. So me of these are: Isaiah 6: 10, M att.13:14 , John 12:40; Súras 7:179 and
63:3 ; The Hidd en Words (Persian), numbers 16,33, and 36, Bahá’í Prayers (Wilmette, Ill.: B.P.T., 1991), p.165, and Gleanings, pp. 293, 303.
Another reason is that, understanding of scripture is the purpose for which scripture is revealed. Bahá’u’lláh wrote that:

> . . . in every age, the reading of the scriptures and holy books is for no other purpose ex cept to en able the read er to appre-
> hend their meaning an d unravel their inn ermos t mysteries. Otherwise, reading without understandin g, is of no abiding
> profit unto man.

Kitáb-i-ˆqán, London, England: B.P.T., 19 61 edition., pp. 110-111.

Thus, Bah á’u’lláh makes a direct link between the understanding of scripture and mysticism in stating that the sole purp ose fo r reading
scripture has always been , is, and will always be, to understand their meaning and to unravel their mysteries.

V Talking of psychic po wers and witch craft, one might want to know the relationship between thes e two. The an swer is giv en b elow:

> The Research Department has found nothing in the Writings clarifyin g the relationship between the use of “psych ic pow-
> ers ” and what some call “witchcraft.”

 A Commen ta r y on th e Concl usion on True
M ys ticism

Enoch Tanyi

In the conclusion of my paper ‘Mysticism in African Traditional
Religion and in the Bahá’í Faith’, presented at the Irfán colloquium
in London in July 2001*, I wrote that true mysticism or class one
mysticism in the Bahá’í Faith had no parallel in African Traditional
Religion. In the light of new information and some more reflection,
I modify this conclusion.

To refresh the memory, I defined true mysticism as ‘The ecstatic
joy that results from communion with the Souls of the
Manifestations leading to physical martyrdom or the living of a life
of self-sacrifice and saintliness’. This definition is derived from a
statement the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith made in Unfolding
Destiny of the British Bahá’í Community, pp. 406-7, and Abdu’l-
Bahá’s explanation of the meaning of sacrifice (see notes 1 and 2
below).

First of all, deducing from the Bahá’í teachings: African
Traditional Religion (ATR), like the Bahá’í Faith is divine in origin.
This means that a Manifestation or Manifestations of God appeared
in Africa, and brought divine teachings. True mysticism, as defined
in the Bahá’í teachings, is an eternal truth. Since the Bahá’í Faith
teaches that the Manifestations teach essentially the same truth, it
can be concluded that the Manifestations who taught the original
form of ATR also taught true mysticism. In this light, therefore,
true mysticism is found in both ATR and in the Bahá’í Faith.

> Deducing from ATR:
> According to one scholar, the book entitled ‘“The Sayings of the
Ancient One”, purported to have been found in Zimbabwe, shows
interesting correspondence to the Four Valleys of Bahá’u’lláh’.

The theme of the Four Valleys is true mysticism, therefore, this
book from ATR teaches true mysticism. My previous conclusion can
only hold in considering recorded examples in the lives of the
adherents, in which case the abundance of recorded exploits of
martyrs in Bahá’í literature would have no parallel in recorded ATR
literature. However, the absence of records does not prove that no
martyrs or true mystics arose in ATR. Besides, the main thrust of the
paper was to classify concepts and not to examine the extent to
which the adherents have applied these concepts to their lives.

1\. The Guardian’s statement on true mysticism:

> We liken God to the Sun which gives us all our life. So
> the spirit of God reaches us through the Souls of the
> Manifestations. We must learn to commune with Their
> Souls, and this is what the Martyrs seemed to have done,
> and what brought them such ecstasy of joy that life
> became nothing. This is the true mysticism, and the
> secret, inner meaning of life which humanity has at
> present, drifted so far from. (UD 406-407)
2\. “Sacrifice of life is of two kinds. To be killed for
the Cause is not so difficult as to live for it in
absolute obedience to the commands of God.” (Abdu’l-Bahá, in SW
5:VIII:6:65)
3\. In this brief commentary, I propose another definition of True
Mysticism. This definition neither supersedes nor is inferior to the
previous one: ‘The act of communing with the Souls of the
Manifestations of God to such a degree that the communer attains
the     state    of    ecstatic    joy   leading    to his   physical
martyrdom or to his living a life of self-sacrifice and
saintliness’.
