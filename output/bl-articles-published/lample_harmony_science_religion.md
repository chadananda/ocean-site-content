## In Pursuit of Harmony between Science and Religion

### by [Paul Lample](https://bahai-library.com/author/Paul+Lample)

> **Abstract:** The disintegration of the old world order is accelerating, driven by religious fanaticism, irreligion, and an inability to achieve sufficient consensus of thought and action to systematically address the ills afflicting humanity. The capacity to unite in the investigation of truth for the advancement of civilization requires the harmony of science and religion, in which, as 'Abdu'l-Bahá explains, science is freed from materialism and religion from superstition. This paper looks at how Bahá'ís might understand and increasingly contribute to the effectuation of this principle through action and involvement in contemporary discourse.

no less a revolution in the behavior of humanity and the evolution of culture
than the creation of science from the late 1500s to the dawn of the 1700s. It is
therefore necessary to prove true religion like true science—to act and demon-
strate that it works. As Shoghi Effendi explained at the start of the systematic
execution of the Divine Plan: “Let the doubter arise and himself verify the truth
of such assertions” (Messages to America 17).
