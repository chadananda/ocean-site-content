"So     His     Holiness      [the      alighted

B?b]          at the house of
the     Im?m-Jum'a   [of    Isfahan],      and   abode     there    forty
days, during    which   time   the  Imdm-Jum'a        behaved,    towards
him with       every  appearance       of good-will       and respect.
Many    persons, gentle    and    simple, enjoyed       the   honour     of
meeting    him,   and propounded        to   him   hard   questions,     to
which    they      received full       and satisfactory     answers easy to
understand,        so that many       accepted    his   doctrine.  His Ex

> cellency       [Min?chihr      Khan]     the  Mu'tamadu'd-Dawla        also
came to see him, and His Holiness                                    returned

[the B?b]
the visit.       The Imdm-Jum(a            had demanded        of him,     'By

'
what       sign do you establish            the truth of your          claim ?
'                                    '

By verses/        answered    he,     for without      pause of the pen
I can,     in  the  space  of three  hours,    write   a  thousand sentences
on any subject that I please.'                 '

But,' objected     the Im?rn
Jum'a,        'you may have considered              the matter    previously.'
'                                       '
I will write,'      replied he,         on any subject you please.'

*
Then,' said the Imdm-Jum'a,               write for me a Commentary
on the S?ra beginning              wa'l-'asr,1     even as you wrote         for
Ak?       Seyyid                of   D?r?b       a                     on    the

Yahy?                           Commentary
S?ratu'1'Kawthar.2         So His Holiness      [the B?b]    began to
write,     and    in every three hours wrote a thousand sentences.
Then       the   Im?m-Jum'a     was   convinced     that  such power
was   from God, being          beyond the capacity of man."
Allusion   is made           to this request of the Im?m-Jum'a

tone of this passage, as well as the absence of all claim to
infallibility, is very noteworthy,  and in itself stamps the work as one

The Bab's         Commentary            on the S?ratu'l-Kawthar.

This MS., brought    from Persia    to Cyprus, under the cir
cumstances already detailed on pp. 493-5 supra, was forwarded
to me by Subh-i-Ezel,     together with the MS.      to be next

I send unto you two books which I described on a previous
occasion;  one [a copy] of the Commentary on the

Names,
and the other [a copy] of the Commentary    on the S?ratu'l
Kaicthar,   that this may be a reminder to him who heareth
and seeth and watcheth                        and winneth            : strive,     then,   to write
the     words       correctly."

The Commentary     on the S?ratu'l-Kawthar,       as we learn
from     a  passage  in  the T?rikh-i-Jad?d    cited at pp. 637-8

supra, as well as from the Traveller's Narrative       (vol. i, p. 10,
vol.    ii, p. 8), was written     by the B?b      for Ak?     Seyyid
Yahy?       of D?r?b    at Sh?r?z.     Further    proof    of this is
afforded by the following         words which       occur on f. 9a,

2%6 -B?&'sCommentary                   on theNames           (vol. ii).

This MS. came into my hands under the same circum
stances and at the same time as the last. The passage          in
the accompanying     letter wherein   reference   is made  to   it
has been already quoted     (p. 643 supra).     The letter itself
is pasted into this MS. after the last leaf (f. 264), forming
ff. a-?     additional.

The     description     of the MS.       is as follows:      Ff.   264
(ff. la-2*, 5b-6\      192b, 219a, 225b-226b,        230a-232b,     240a
240b, 253b, 264a-264b,          a1 and ?* blank), 2075x13            centi
metres,     21   lines   to   the page.    Written      in  a  clear   and
compact      naskh.    Headings    of   chapters   and  marginal     anno

This, like all the Bab's other later works, is divided into
V?hids containing     nineteen chapters apiece.  Each    chapter
is devoted    to one of the "Names"      of God,   these names
being permuted     and varied in the usual way     (cf. T.N     ii,
pp. 317-319).     Each name is further considered under four
different      aspects,     so    that    in   each     chapter       we    find      four
subordinate sections,

work     (from V?hid viii, ch. 1 to V?hid xix,              ch. 18l)     is

Bulletin de VAcad?mie Imp?riale de Sciences de St. P?tersbourg
(1865). For Dorn gives only the first chapter of the twelfth
V?hid, which,  as I have already said, is not contained     in
this volume.  I think, however, that anyone who will com
pare the specimen which he gives with                       the fragment   I have
given will agree that the two MSS.                          almost certainly   re

650                       DESCRIPTION OF BABf MSS.

the first                                     The matter    can be

chapter of the twelfth V?hid.

easily settled in St. Petersburg     by comparing my description
of my defective MS. with          the complete MS    described   by
Dorn.    This identification    is really more important    than at
first sight appears, for the St. Petersburg       MS.    is of un
doubted    authenticity,   having passed directly from the hands

of   the B?b's    amanuensis      into European   hands in Tabriz
shortly   before  the   B?b's martyrdom.1      Now   should this MS.
of mine prove to be identical with Dora's, not only will the
latter be supplied with        its proper name, but valuable cor
roborative    evidence will be afforded of the genuineness         of
all the MSS. which have come to me through Subh-i-Ezel's
hands.

The        18th chapter of the 19th V?hid  (on the Name    >j*?\)
begins           on f. 258a, and ends on f. 261b with the

following
words        :

Bab selbst, welcher diesen Koran nach dem Vorsagen              seines Herrn und Meisters
niedergeschrieben    haben wollte, herstammt.          Er hatte sie aus seinem Gef?ngniss
zu Tebris     in europ?ische H?nde     gelangen      lassen.  Die Verantwortlichkeit    f?r
den Inhalt also ruht auf dem genannten          Secretar."

This is the last of what I have found of the chapters of
this precious book, whereof      the transcription      was concluded
on the day of Kem?l                      the   second    of the month

[Monday],
of Kalimdt    [the   7th  month],     and   the   first  of the cycle
of Mustafin     (?) of   the  37th   year    of   the   Bey?nic    cycle
and the sixth Kawr,        corresponding      to Monday        the 17th
of Sha'b?n,    a.h.                    1302, by          the hand          of       the    feeblest            of

[God's]   servants                     and   the        humblest           of   them,             he    who
needeth    the grace of his Bountiful                        Lord,         51092."l

"Let         it not        be     hidden         that      the   copy           from which                  this

Monday,    Sha'b?n    17th, a.h.                 June    1st, a.d.  1885.    The
B?b? date given in this colophon offers several difficulties, and is evidently    com

a fixed point  other than that used by the Beh?'?s    (See jT.?V. vol. ii,
puted from
p. 425).    The cyphers at the end of the colophon appear to represent         in some
cabbalistic fashion the scribe's name.

incorrect,       perchance                it may be correct.   Peace  be upon
him who          followeth              the right guidance,  and God's mercy
and blessings."

"The first volume                     has    been       collated     with   a trustworthy
copy."
At     the bottom

of the page      (f. 26 lb) is an index of the
chapters         contained

in   this volume,     arranged according     to
the V?hids  to which    they belong     and   their order in  those
V?hids.  The 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th V?hids are tolerably
complete         ; the      12th, 13th, 14th,                 17th,      and   18th        are     un

represented             (one or more pages               being     left blank  at the
point where              they should appear              in the text) ; V?hid       15
is represented     by only                    two chapters    (the   12th  and 13th) ;
V?hid     16 by one (ch. 7) ; and V?hid            19 by chapters 7,
8, 12,   13, 14, 15, 17,   and  18.
Although     the scribe appears to have been unable to supply

"           '*
the missing      chapters, he nevertheless     knows the        Names
which     form their titles and subjects,        and accordingly,       on
f, 262a, he gives a complete           table of contents      of V?hids
xii-xix.     This, together with the contents of V?hids viii-xi,
I subjoin, premising        that different derivatives      of the same

"        "
root are accounted        the same      Name       (e.g. j++<* and J^      ;

> <J^-?/? and t_L?U?), and that I place the missing               chapters

Part    of the Book      of theNames           of All    Things       (vol. i).

This MS.,      forwarded      to me

by Subh-i-Ezel      in July or
August,     1891, appears         to be

the  companion     volume of the
MS.     last described,    with which      it corresponds      in size,
writing,    and arrangement,      though    its name is given some
what differently.       It contains in an

incomplete form V?hids
ii-vii   inclusive,  just as BBF.       9 contains V?hids viii-xix.
V?hid    i is missing,        but a statement   of its contents   is pre
fixed to the index           on f. 2a. The                of  the MS.    is

description
as follows :

Ff.    338 (ff. la-l*, 8P, 88a-88*>, 120^120^,        336*>-338b blank),

> 20*75 x 13 centimetres,       21 lines to the page. Written
> in the same clear and compact naskh as the MS. last
> described.      Headings    of chapters      and marginal    an
> notations     in red.
In the table of contents above alluded to the "Names "
commentated         are written                     the number of the

continuously,
V?hid    to which       they belong being
"         "

indicated   by a super
scription in red over the first Name              of each V?hid.    This
table I subjoin,        placing   the numbers        of the V?hids      in
parentheses.

660                    DESCRIPTION OF BABT MSB,.

The Mirror          of the Bey?n,      by Subh-i-Ezel.

Ff.    678    (ff. la-2a and 675b-678^ blank), 2075 x 13-5 centi
metres, 14 lines to the page. Written  in Subh-i-Ezel's

large   clear     nasfch.
When          I wasin Cyprus in March-April       1890, Subh-i-Ezel
mentioned       this book and another,         the Divda-i    Ezeli,  as

> two of the    more    important of his productions,     and promised
to give me copies of them.

In a letter dated Muharram        12th, a.h. 1309 (= Aug. 18th,
a.D. 1891), he wrote as follows :

and whether      all at   once,   or  in   two   or   three instalments."
In     reply to this, I requested    that the book might     be sent

either   all at once,  or in successive
through Captain Young,
instalments,    as might   appear convenient.       The first instal
ment,     consisting     of 25 folios of 10 leaves (20 pages) each,
reached me         in November,         1891 ; the second      instalment,

consisting    of  23  similar   folios, in February,     1892 ; the third
and last instalment,        consisting    of 20 folios, in June, 1892.

A     Traveller's Narrative,  written                to illustrate the Episode                     of

the Bab.

Ff.     108     (ff. Ia, 107a-108b blank),       18*0 x 10'5 centimetres,

12  lines to the page.       Written      in a good naskh.

To what I have said concerning         this work, its peculiarities,
value,    and    importance,     in  the   Introduction     to vol. ii of
my     edition    (which   contains,    besides     the aforesaid   Intro
duction,      the translation     and notes) I have to make              one
or two important         additions.    From       the perusal of certain

letters written    by Beh?Vll?h's          son 'Abb?s Efendi,       I was
led to surmise that he might         perhaps be the author of this
history,  the  peculiar   style  of   which appeared very similar
to his.     This    conjecture,    however,    till recently     lacked

confirmatory     evidence.      But  some  few   weeks    ago
positive
I received    a letter from a Persian         B?b? of Jewish         ex
traction?a          descendent            of

those Jews of Mash-had            who,
about        half    a century          were
ago,                converted     to

BBA.    2.   IKAN.                           665

This    book was printed         in Bombay     ; it has been collated
with    a manuscript    copy    of  the  same,  written  in the hand

of His    Excellency     Zeynu*l-Mukarrabin,1     which     is
writing
in my possession.          The     other   is an evidential    treatise

written     by M?rz? Ab?'1-Fazl2      of Gulp?yag?n

of        the Divine          Manifestation       and Heavenly           Theophany    in
the Holy Lands of Carmel                       and Jerusalem."

It may   therefore,    I think, be safely assumed       that the
anonymous    author    of  the  Traveller's  Narrative, concerning
whom    I was previously       unable     to give any information,
is none other   than Beh?'s    eldest son, 'Abbas Efendi,       called

by  the B?b?s ?kd-yi-[or    JELazrat-i-~\ Sirru'll?h.

As regards the Bombay      edition, it is clearly lithographed
in a ta'M hand on grey paper, contains 240 pp. of 9 lines
each, measuring     21*0 x 13*5 centimetres,        and, beyond     the
actual text, contains only   the  following   brief   colophon  :?

That     the "narrative"      is not strictly    impartial  I have
shown at pp. xlv-xlvi       of vol. ii, and that, in one particular
at least, there is good ground          for suspecting    a deliberate
mis-statement      of facts and dates, I have pointed           out at
pp.   304-6   of the April  number    of  this Journal.

information given by   me  to Baron Rosen  at  a date anterior
to that whereon I received this MS. (see Coll. 8c. vi, p. 243,

Hidden         Words.         Three Epistles       to Zoroastrians.

In the Epistle      to the King     of Persia     {Coll. Se.   vi,
pp. 204-5)    certain quotations     are made    from the Hidden
Book of Fatima.       When     I was engaged on the translation
of the Traveller's     Narrative,    in which    the greater    part
of this Epistle     is cited, I was forced to consider what
the work thus referred to might             be. Not       being   able to
arrive   at a satisfactory    conclusion,    I wrote     to Acre    asking
for information      on this and several other subjects.                 In

I   received  on                        a           dated
reply                    Sept. 1st, 1890,        letter,          August
20th, 1890, from Bella's        son M?rz? Bad?'u'll?h,

containing
answers     to my question.     What      refers to the Hidden Book
of F?tima I translated in vol. ii of the Traveller's Narrative,
p. 123, n. 1.        I shall not repeat the translation               here,
but will give            the original     text of this portion        of the letter.

The Persian portion of the Hidden Wards, which extends

> above.    Of   these invocations,    all    of   which   are written

or law conducive         to the general well-being              of mankind
embodied by Beh?'u'll?h             in one or other of his "revela

1891, together     with    a   letter   from M?rz? Bad?'u'll?h           dated
Jem?d?-uth-th?n?        11th, a.h. 1308 (Jan. 22nd, 1891).                This

piled   for my  benefit   by  order    of   Beh?'u'll?h.      As   indicating
the ideals held up by Beh? for the guidance                 of his followers
it is interesting    and important, and I hope at some future
date to publish     it in its entirety.          For the present I must
content myself     with giving           the inscription      on f. Ia, the
first and last clauses,         and an abstract       of contents     in English.

In      substance     the reforms enacted    in the fifteen                   clauses
contained       in this tract are as follows :

(1) Abolition  of religious warfare  (jih?d).
(2) Permission    to all sects and peoples to unite                        in friendly

intercourse.

(3) Permission              to

study foreign      languages        (a thing dis
> couraged by   the B?b),    coupled   with   a  recommendation
> that one language        and writing         (either     of those
> already existing,   or  specially   devised    for   the  purpose)
> should be selected by general          consent as a medium
of international     communication.      (Cf. B. ii, p. 981 ;
Coll. Se. vi, p. 245, 1. 4 from the bottom.)
(4) All Beh?'s      followers are bound      loyally    to serve and

> support any King        who    extends    his  protection  to
> their faith.
(5) The followers     of Beh?,   in whatever  land they dwell,
must    cheerfully   and  ungrudgingly    submit   to the

laws and conform to the customs of that country.
(6) Promise   of the "Most      great Peace"     (Cf. Traveller's

Narrative,   vol. ii, p. xl.).
(7) All  are permitted,     subject  to the dictates   of decency

> and good taste, to follow their own inclinations          as
> to dress and the wearing      of the hair.
(8) The good works       and devotions      of Christian   priests
are recognised    and will be accepted, but they must
henceforth             abandon       their   seclusion     and "engage   in

that     which           shall     advantage       them     and whereby
> mankind            shall be        benefited."      They     are also per
mitted          to marry.

(9) Confession    of sins to one's fellow-men   and  seeking

> absolution   from them is not permitted.     To God
> only should confession be made, and from him only
should pardon be sought.   A form of prayer suitable

for such confession      is given.       (Cf. B.   ii, p. 975, first
paragraph.)
(10) The Bab's       command       to destroy     certain     classes of

> books     (e.g. books    of   logic, philosophy,       and   other
sciences conducing,     in his opinion, only to self-conceit
> and disputatiousness)      and to     renew      all books after
> a certain period,     is abrogated.       (Cf. B.     ii, p. 979,
> 1. 21 ; p. 928, 1. 10 et seq.)
(11) The    study   of    sciences     and   arts     is commended    and

> encouraged,      but  they     should    be    such as conduce to
> the welfare of mankind.
(12) All men must learn and practise some craft, trade, or

> profession.      The diligent     and conscientious    practice
> of such craft, trade, or profession        is in itself an act
> of worship.       Mendicity     and idleness are hateful       to
God.       (Cf. B. ii, p. 975, first paragraph.)
(13) The   settlement     of differences,  the apportionment of

alms, and the ordering of the affairs of the common
wealth     generally,  are entrusted    to the "House  of

Justice."      (Cf. B. ii, p. 974.)
(14) Visitations    of    the tombs of martyrs        and pilgrimages
to the shrines of saints are no

longer to be regarded
as obligatory.      Nevertheless     it is a pious work for
> rich men to leave money          to the "House     of Justice
> to enable      their poorer brethren        to perform     these
pilgrimages.
(15) Though a republic         conduces most     to the general welfare,

> it is not desired     that Kings,        who are the "signs       of
> God's Power,"       should cease      to exist.      "If      statesmen
can combine   these           two              in this              their

things                    cycle,
reward with God        shall be great."
680                      DESCRIPTION OF BABI MSS.

Class     IY.     MSS.      obtained      from     Constantinople.

Beforeproceeding    to describe these MSS. I must explain
in what manner     I became acquainted with Sheykh A-,
the learned Ezeli from whom I received them.         On October
13th, 1890, I received from Constantinople       a long letter in
Persian,  occupying    two sheets of writing-paper,    and dated
Safar   22nd, a.h. 1308 (Oct. 7th, 1890), which     letter proved

to be from the aforesaid Sheykh A--,        with whom I had
had no previous communication,    and of whose very existence
I had till that day been unaware.       After    apologizing   for

to me without previous introduction   or acquaintance,
writing
the writer explained how he had heard of me from Persia
and Cyprus, and how he had learned that I had interested
myself  especially in the B?b? religion.    In consequence    of
this, he said, he had written     to me to warn me against
certain pretenders   to spiritual  truth (by whom he meant
the Beh?'?s) who had brought discord and dissensions        into
the bosom of the new faith. After discoursing    in this strain
at great length, in fine but              rather    ambiguous        language,    he
continued as follows :

in my possession     a book in the sweet Persian          tongue,
in very  simple style,   consisting of   about   twenty     folios
or 160 leaves    (pp. 320),  which  sets  forth  in   very   easy

language  the mysteries    of this    law and    its ordinances,

in such wise    that   it will place     in your    hand a key
wherewith   to open this treasure-house      of the Knowledge

a few, he

have it he will either lend it to me for two or three months,
that I may make a copy for myself,       or will get it copied
for me       at five francs         the folio.

I   immediately  answered  this letter, saying that I should
prefer   to  have  a  copy  made   for me    in Constantinople,
and asking for the name of the book and further particulars
about it. In answer to this letter I received on November
10th, 1890, a second                  communication             from Sheykh        A-,
in which he wrote :

The writer    added that there was only one other copy of
the book besides his own, and that it was in Persia,         and
was accessible    to no one but the owner;      that he would
put        the work          in hand

Moreover      this book (the Hasht Bihisht)     is really two books.

In   the first volume     [the author]   has   treated    of the theo
retical aspects of the philosophy      of the Bey?n,       its scientific
proofs     and  rationale  ; while  in  the  second    [he discusses]
the ordinances of the Law of the                  the circumstances

of the Resurrection       and the promised      corporeal Paradise,

Resurrection.1      Now    the book copied for you is the second
volume."       If I like, continues     Sheykh A-,              he will

have    a copy of the first volume also made for me, which,

though it deals less directly and ostensibly   with the Bab's
doctrine,   and, indeed, would    not be recognized     by the
uninitiated    reader as inspired   thereby, will  nevertheless
help to render clear the true character of the new religion.

Not to pursue further a long correspondence,                    I may state
briefly   that  I   subsequently        received     the   whole      of vol. i
of the Hasht       Bihisht                                  and    the

(^Lj ,?J?3 ?JuAh)                       greater
portion   of  vol.   ii.    The   latter, however,       is defective     in the
middle,    and    consists     of   portions     of   two    different    copies,
the first twenty-two          folios    (consisting     of four sheets,         or
sixteen   pages, each) being written               on   yellow     paper,    and
the last eight on white paper.                 How      great may be the
central hiatus I have no means                 of judging,        but I hope
soon to receive the

missing     portion.
Concerning      the real authorship          of the work I addressed
a direct                 to                          to which       he replies

It is unnecessary        to point out the importance      of such
a work   from such         a source.     As, however,    one of the
volumes     is defective   ; as I have not yet been able to study
either volume as it deserves ; and as I do not wish                 to

this  article  unnecessarily,   I must  perforce   confine

because the proper numeration                           of the leaves following     the

Ends    withthe narrative     of           of the people of the

an  Ezel?   B?b?)1   of   a visit  which he paid to
Bey?n"      (i.e.
Acre    from Cyprus,      and   of what    he   saw   and heard there.
This narrative,      written   partly     in  Persian    and partly  in
Arabic,    occupies five pages and one third, and contains
the most    violent    and bitter denunciations   of Beh?    and
his  followers.        Praise  be to God,"    he begins,"    who
hath caused me to travel in all lands, and hath shewn
me the firmly-buttressed      palaces, and Iram of the columns,
and the couches of Pharoah          and Shadd?d, and the tombs
of Thamud and 'Ad, who rebelled in the land, and oppressed

[God's]    servants, and whose     home     shall be                         hell?an            ill
resting-place    !?And   blessing and peace be upon                           Muhammad
and   his  glorious   household.  But    after this.                          I was for a
while in the regions of Syria, and in the city                                of Damascus

Probably    Sheykh A-        himself,        who     in one of his     letters    mentioned
incidentally  that he had visited Acre?a          rare thing for an Ezel?   to do.

J.E.A.8.     1892.                                                              45

'the  spacious'    [al-Feyh?],      and Aleppo     'the grey*      [ash
Shahb?~],   and   the  parts    round   about  Mount     Lebanon,    and
Tyre,    and   Sidon.     And      the  misleadings     of  the   Black
Darkness     brought me into the City of Blood,               the town

*                      '

of Acre, which they call the City of Vision               [Madmatu'sh
shuhiid~\ ; and, by my life ! it is, indeed, the City of Vision,
and a minaret     for the consuming       fire, and on it are poured
forth   darknesses,    and lightnings,      and thunders.           There
I plainly    saw the manifestation       of plurality,      to wit,    the
combination       of  thunder,   lightning,    darkness,       and     the
thunder-bolt     ; and I called to mind         the Chapter         of the
Unbelievers    of the Eternal Word.1          For      these are they
who     havehidden   the light of their original       potentiality
with     thedarkness   of the attributes     of wicked    souls and
the effects of a corrupt nature, and have been veiled from
the Truth by Untruth."        The first of these "unbelieving
souls and manifestations     of infidelity,"    whom    he met on
the sea-shore, was      none   other    than Beh?'s     eldest     son

'Abb?s Efendi, whom      he calls   "al-Wasw?s,"     which     is  an
attribute      of   the
devil               "the                       or

meaning                whisperer"

"suggester"      [of wicked   thoughts],2     and is numerically
equivalent    to the name   'Abbas.3     "After     that," he con
tinues,     I saw the rest of the Wicked          One's   followers,
and heard the words of each.      Their sayings and arguments
consist of a farrago of names, baseless         stories, calumnies,
falsehoods, and lies, and not one of them has any knowledge
of even the first principles         of the religion       of the Bey?n
or of any other religion.        They   are  all  devoid   of  knowledge,
ignorant,    short-sighted,    of common         Capacity, hoodwinked,

of    darkness,      spurned      of    nature,      hypocrites,
people
corrupters     of texts,    blind     imitators ; God         hath    taken
away from them his light and hath left them in the darkness
of theWicked   One, and hath destroyed  them in the abysses
of vain imaginings,   and hath put chains      around    their
necks . . . ." After  one or two pages      of denunciation

preted    in a  sense    far from flattering      to   Beh?    and his
followers, the narrator describes how, after         some   days spent
in the society of        souls suggesting     thoughts    of evil," he
was admitted    to Beh?'s      audience-chamber.        When      I was
come    there," he                   "and

continues,     looked upon that Arch
idol, that Greatest   Talisman,     that  personified Revolt     [T?gh?t
i-mumaththal~],    that    rebellious    Lucifer      ['Az?z?l-i-m?rid'],
that envious Iblis, I saw a form on a throne, and heard
the 'lowing     of the calf.'1 Then did I see how the light
of       the Most        Great   Name     had shone on Ahriman     the
accursed,           and how   the finger of the demon wore the ring.2
For   they          had written     the Name Beh?'u'1-Abh?  in divers
writings,  and called it 'the Most Great Name.'3     Thereat
there came to my mind      this verse of [Hafiz] the Tongue
of the Unseen?

Efficient      is the Name Divine          ; be of good cheer, O heart !
The div becomes          not Solomon        by guile and cunning's art.'"4

The    narrator then describes               his heartfelt         joy on finding
himself       once more outside Acre,                                  in the following

worship
S?miri     seduced the Children       of Israel.    See Kur'?n     vii, 146 ; xx, 90 ; and
Traveller's Narrative,      vol. ii, p. 355 and n. 2.

2 Allusion     is made to the well-known       story of the theft of Solomon's magic
ring by one of the demons, who, by its aid, exercised for some time the supreme
power.
3 This is

regarded throughout      the Bey?n and by all the B?b?s as the "Most
Great Name"           of God, but according       to the Ezel?s      it belongs                to

I must now state the contents of this volume as briefly
as possible, leaving a fuller account of its most   interesting
and valuable contents for some future occasion.     Not being
able to number the pages in the customary     fashion, I avail
myself of the scribe's Arabic numeration,    according to which

the first page of writing    (f. 2b) is numbered     p. 1, after
which     the pages  (not the leaves) are numbered      regularly

> (the even numbers only being written      in) as far as p. 126

(and p. 127, not numbered).          At this point the numeration

changes    from    the  pages    to  the   leaves (as though f. 2 had
been numbered        1,  f. 3a 2, etc.), and what, according        to the

system   hitherto     followed,    should     be  (p.)  128   is actually
marked     (f.) 64. The numeration             by leaves then proceeds
regularly     up to (f.) 175, where           the portion    of the MS.
written   on yellow paper         (22  folios   of 8  leaves  each) ends.
Then, separated  by the hiatus already mentioned,          come the
8 folios written  on white paper.      Here      the numeration    is

not leaves,    the first page of the white
again by pages,
being numbered    330.    It proceeds    regularly    up to p. 438

(and p. 439, not numbered)      except that pp. 416 and 417

are both numbered      416, thus making        all the subsequent
numbers   up to 438 wrong      by   two.    In    the last folio the
numeration      again changes    in the most erratic manner,    the
leaves of this folio being numbered from 201 to 208.

The Introduction     extends    from p. 1 to 37, and, after
some                 remarks,    enumerates and discusses fifteen

preliminary
"virtues"    (i^ajLar^) which   the religion of the Bey?n      has
> over all other religions, and seven       claims   (ci>b:J) which
its adherents make for it.

The body of the work        consists of eight chapters      (for
which    reason, probably,   the book is entitled Hasht Bihisht
or "the Eight Paradises")        and a conclusion.      The index
of these occupies the last thirteen       lines of p. 37 and the
first two lines of p. 38. This index I here transcribe.

As  a systematized     treatise on the philosophy,      theology,
ethics, morality,     and, in lesser degree,     the history of the

religion    of the Bey?n,        this volume   and that previously
described     occupy   a  unique place     in B?b?   literature.     In
such an article as the present   it is impossible                                       to do more
than indicate their extreme interest and value.

"As for the Persian Bey?n, I         thought that, if I should have
a copy made    for you, your        expense would be [needlessly]
increased.  I therefore  send         for you a copy of the Bey?n
in one volume, written     in       Persia,     in good      and correct
naskh,   at the   price  for  which     a  certain   person in Isfahan
transcribes   it,  which    I  bought     from     one   of the Friends
who was intending        to return to Persia.          As to its price :
it contains thirty folios, and was transcribed             at two francs

As           will
be observed,   one chapter (the last) is missing

given
chapters.
Since     this     article    went

to press, I have received,    under
circumstances    briefly  detailed    at p. 663  supra^ another  B?b?

MS.   (the Istidl?liyy?,    or     Evidences     of M?rz?  Abu'1-Fazl
of Gulp?yag?n),        for which,     as it cannot be placed in any
one of the four classes into which the other MSS. are divided,
I am obliged             to create      a fifth        "supplementary"                     class      (bbs).

14 lines to the page.     Written         in a good      clear
Persian    ta(l?k. The    manner       in which this MS.       came

into my possession     is explained at p. 663 supra.
This work, intended to prove by quotations and arguments
drawn from the Old Testament                 that Beh?Vll?h          is the

promised    Messiah     and   deliverer     of    Israel,    is  addressed
chiefly   to the Jews.      It appears to have been written                in
the year a.h. 1305        (a.d.   1887-8),     for   on   f. 19b  we    find

the following            passage       :

preface extends from f. lb to f. 3a. As it is rather     interest

think it necessary    to add a translation.

passage, which gives the date of Beh?'s               Manifestation       as a.h.    1285
(a.d. 1868),     is very important,      as                              confirmation    of Nabu's

affording approximate
> chronology       (B. i, p.   526   ; B.    it, 984, 988,     stanza   10),   and  further    evidence
> against the impossibly early date (a.h. 1269) given by the Traveller's Narrative.

See pp. 304-6 supra.           It is curious that in two works           composed by the Beh?'is
within      so short a time of one another,              and both intended for more             or less
general circulation,       so glaring a discrepancy        should have been allowed to appear,
more especially as both dates are used evidentially.
2 This                                       as affording further evidence that Kit?b-i

passage is also important,
Akdas,      not Lawh~i-Akdas,          is the correct title of the work alluded to.

prophesies  of the Old Testament,       more  especially   of                                    the
book of Daniel,    in favour of Beh?Vll?h.

the exception of a number of letters of greater or less im

Bihisht,   complete    editions would       certainly   be desirable,
could anyone be induced to incur the necessarily               heavy

expenses of publication.       Failing     this, however,  abridged
English   translations might     sufficiently answer the purpose ;

and of the T?r?kh-i-Jad?d,     at all events, such a translation     is
now in the press, and will, I hope, appear in a few months.        Of
the more   important  sacred  books  of   the B?b,    Subh-i-Ezel,
and Beh?, nothing will serve but complete          texts prepared
from the best available MSS.         I have no doubt in my
own mind    that the Persian Bey?n      should come first ; and,
with  a view to publishing     it in extenso, I have been for
some time engaged on the collation of several MSS.                 Besides
the two MSS.      in my own possession           (bbp.  8,  and    bbc.   3),
and the British Museum        Codex        (Or. 2819),     the

liberality
of the Academy       and the Institut        des Langues       Orientales
of St. Petersburg      has placed at my                      for

disposal,          periods
of six months      each, the two manuscripts               of the work
contained   in their rich collections.          Much     work      remains
to be done ere we can venture             to generalize     with perfect

on the relations,    affinities,     and tendencies        of the
safety
B?bi  movement,    but that that work     is well worth                   the
doing I, for my part, do not for a moment   doubt.

Death    of Beh?Vll?h.

Within     the last few weeks news of the death of Beh?Vll?h
has   reached me.       I have not been able to ascertain      the
date of his decease, but of the fact itself there is no

doubt,
for it is confirmed by a letter written   from Acre by his son,
M?rz? Bad?Vll?h,         and dated Z?'1-Ka'da   29th, a.h. 1309

(June 25th, a.d. 1892).      A portion of the letter I will here
cite, with   translation.

"0    friend

of my heart, and delight of my soul ! In these
days  the showers of affliction do so descend from the clouds
of the firmament   of fate, and the thunderbolts       of griefs
and sorrows do so succeed one another,       that neither hath
the tongue strength   to describe, nor the pen power to utter
them.   For the horizon of the Phenomenal World      is bereft
of   the effulgences   of the Sun of Wisdom           and Revelation,
and the throne of the Universe          is deprived    of the radiance
of the Most Mighty        Luminary.       The    ears  of the friends
are,   to outward    appearance,    debarred    from    hearkening    to

the cry of the Supreme Pen, and the eyes of the longing
are veiled   from the contemplation    of the Most Glorious
Horizon.    Great God ! how dire   a catastrophe    is this which
has arisen in the World,   and how grievous       a   calamity    is

this which  hath appeared  in the Universe      ! The Sun of
Truth    hath bidden    farewell   to this earthly    sphere, and
now shines with      a brightness    which   waneth    not in the
regions  of Might   and Glory.    Albeit   this supreme   affliction
transcends   endurance,   and this most dire disaster      lays in
ruins the edifice of resignation      and patience,   yet, having
regard to the authoritative      command     and binding     behest
revealed from the Holy Angel-World     in the Kit?b-i Akdas,1
we and you alike must adorn ourselves with the ornament
of patience  and resignation, lay hold of the firm rope of
submission           and   acquiescence,  apply         ourselves       with    strong
hearts       and      tranquil    souls to what          will        conduce   to the
progress    of mankind,              the    peace     and

prosperity  of the
world,   the amelioration            of characters,  and the appearance
of charity and concord,             and attach ourselves with our whole
being to the counsels              of the Lord of the Visible     and the
Invisible,   so that the Phenomenal World          may, by the Grace
of that Beneficent     Being,   be  beheld    an  envy to the Garden
of Paradise.    Nor   is this thing difficult with God. The blessed
text      revealed     in the Kit?b-i-Akdas          shall here be cited.          He
says       (great     is His     Glory     and    universal     His       Bounty    !) :

DEATH OF BEHA'U'LLA'H.                                     709

O people of the earth ! When         the Sun of my Beauty     sets,
and    the firmament     of my Form    is hidden, be not troubled ;
arise for     the helping of my work and the advancement of my
Word     throughout the worlds.     Verily We are with you under

> all conditions, and will help you with the Truth;            verily We
> can do this.1 Whosoever         knoweth Me will rise up to serve
me with such uprising that the hosts of heaven and earth shall

> not put him down.'       And     in another place he says : 'Say,

O people,    let not trouble take possession     of you when the
Kingdom       of my Epiphany      becomes  concealed, and the Waves

> of   the Ocean     of my  Utterance   are  hushed.    Verily    there is
> in my Epiphany a reason, and in my Occultation another reason,
which none knoweth save God,        the Incomparable,  the All
Knowing.     And We     shall see you from    the Most Glorious
Horizon,    and will help whomsoever riseth up for  the helping of
our Work with hosts from the Supreme Concourse, and a cohort
of the Cherubim."

The same news reached me on the same day from my
> Ezeli   correspondent    in Constantinople, but in how different
> a form of words was his laconic announcement           of Bella's
death couched ! He added (I know not on what authority)

> that disputes had already arisen between two of Beh?'u'll?h's
> sons,   *Abb?s Efendi     and M?rz? Muhammad        'Ali,3 as to
the        succession         ; and
Ak? M?rz?   that

Ak?      Jan    called
Kh?dimu'll?h,                 Beh?'s

amanuensis   and   special    attendant,
> had given his support to the latter, because he hoped to
> find him more pliable     and more   amenable      to his own
views     and wishes. This statement   I only give for what

it is worth.

part of this passage will he found quoted at p. 975 of B. it.
It occurs on f. 7b of bbp. 3, and f. 31b of bbp. 4.

passage occurs on f. 10b of bbp. 3, and fL 38a-38b of bbp. 4.
3 The latter I did not see at

Acre, neither did I know where he was,         though
> I heard mention      of him.   He    it was, I believe, who     invented   the different
forms of the Khatt-i-Badi',        or ".New

Writing.'*    (See B.    i, p. 498.)    Of

What             effect    Beh?'s  may    have

death     on the further

development            of    B?b?ism

it is impossible     to conjecture.
Will     the movement     of which he has for        so        a time

long
been the guiding      spirit,             or lose ground ? Will

languish
> dissensions   arise amidst his followers       to produce     further
> disruptions   and   schisms   in   the  B?b?   church  ? Will      the
Ezelis   (who, as it appears, keep themselves       well   informed
of all that takes place at Acre)        seize the opportunity      to

> set on foot propaganda    in favour of Subh-i-Ezel      ? Or will
> the fabric, reared with such infinite pains by the departed
Seer, prove able to withstand    the disintegrating  forces which,
no longer kept in check by his master-hand,          must almost

come into play ?             Time   alone will   show.1
inevitably
1 I learn   from Baron    Bosen    thata short paragraph                the death

announcing
> of Beh?Vll?h      appeared      in the Russian newspaper   called Le Caucase, published
> at Tiflis  ; and that        the news     was also conveyed     to him by Lieutenant
Toumanski     in a private      letter, in which were enclosed copies of Beh?'u'll?h's

an elegy on his death by the B?b?

> testamentary    dispositions     (^??fs <->V?) and
> poet lAndalib     (M?rz? 'AH Ashraf        of L?h?j?n).    Baron Bosen   adds that Beh?

> not   reach   'Ishk?b?d   till July 5th.  The interesting documents forwarded        by
