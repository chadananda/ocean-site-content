MAFIA, MOB AND SHIISM IN IRAQ:
THE REBELLION OF OTTOMAN

KARBALA 1824-1843*
A virtual rebellion of the Iraqi city of Karbalaagainst central govern-
ment rule brought about a catastrophic invasion by Baghdad-based
Ottoman Turkish forces in January 1843. Because the urban social
history of the nineteenth-century Ottoman empire remains compara-
tively little known, the forms of social organization and local culture
that led to the revolt deserve detailed treatment.

The following analysis examines the role of urban gangs in leading
the rebellion, in coalition with other social groups. Neighbourhood
vigilante bands had long existed in Islamic cities. But in the first
decades of the nineteenth century, parallelinga decline in government
control, "mafia" - gangs that ran protection rackets and acted as a
parallel government - grew up in Karbala. Even in this "antisocial"
form, it will be shown, the urban gangs could make alliances within
the city to emerge as popular leaders against an alien threat, therefore
acting as more than mere exploiters.

The toughs had several allies in the fighting. They were employed
by the city's indigenous landed notables as bodyguards and hit men.
They forged links with Shiite Arab nomads outside the town walls.
Another group, the "mob" - small artisans and shopkeepers -
participated in the revolt under the rhetoric of (Shiite) religion and
(Iranian) ethnicity versus the Turkish Sunni outsiders who sought to
subdue them. Finally, the Muslim religious scholars ('ulama') occu-
pied a special position in the shrine city, and also allied themselves
to the urban gangs.1

This study will employ several techniques to evoke the meaning
of gang rule and popular revolt in Shiite Karbala. First, a synchronic
analysis of the city's various social groups and their relationships to
one another will be undertaken. Secondly, a diachronic historical
narrativeof the processes whereby the town became virtually auton-
omous, and how it resisted conquest, will be presented to demonstrate
how those sociological groups acted towards one another over time.
Attention will be paid to the mentaliteof the major social actors and,
as noted, to the crucial role of religion and the religious scholars.

The cleavages among the rebellious groups in Karbalawere bridged
in an important manner by Imami Shiite Islam, a branch of the
religion that believed the Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law 'Ali and
his eleven lineal descendants (termed "Imams") should have held
power in the nascent Islamic empire after his passing. Imamis hold
that until the supernatural reappearanceof the Twelfth Imam (who
went into occultation in the ninth century) all government is less than
perfect. Most did, however, accept the interim legitimacy of Shiite
monarchies such as the Safavidsand Qajarsin Iran. Shiism in Karbala
encompassed both the wealthy and the indigent, both Arab and
Iranian.

The ruling elite in Ottoman Iraq adhered to Sunnism (the majority
branch of Islam except in post-sixteenth-centuryIran and contempor-
ary Iraq), which held that after the Prophet's passing political lead-
ership fell to an oligarchically elected caliph. After four early "rightly
guided" caliphs, the last being 'Ali, political power passed to less
revered hereditary monarchies, such as the Umayyad and Abbasid
caliphates. Sunnis in the Ottoman empire owed allegiance to the
Turkish emperor, but Shiis execrated the Ottoman ruler as a heretic
and a usurper of an office that should by right belong only to the
Twelfth Imam.

SOCIAL STRUCTURE: RELIGION, STATE AND THE CROWD
As Hanna Batatu has pointed out, the ethnic and religious cleavages
in Iraq produced three demographic zones. South of Baghdad, Shiite
Arabs largely made up the population. Sunni Arabs populated most of
Baghdad and its northern hinterland. Finally, north-east of Baghdad
Kurds predominated, adhering to a form of Sunnism heavily influ-
enced by Sufi mysticism.2 Strong social and economic cleavages also

divided the people. Town dwellers often came into conflict with
pastoral nomads. Of an estimated population of 1,290,000 in 1850,
fully 35 per cent consisted of pastoral nomads. Another 41 per cent
was rural and only 24 per cent was urban.3 Circassian and Turkish
Sunnis filled the upper echelons of the government. Most of the local
controllers of large rural estates were Sunni Arabs. Sunni notables
often predominated even in the largely Shiite south, except in the
vicinity of the shrine cities.4

For nearly a century, from 1750 to 1831, the weak Ottoman
government in Istanbul allowed a corps of Mamluk (slave-soldier)
vassals to rule from Baghdad.s Even this local government often had
difficulty asserting its authority over the factious population. From
1831 the Ottomans again ruled directly, attemptingto impose progres-
sively greater control through their standing army and the bureauc-
racy in Baghdad. Mamluks and Ottomans engaged in perpetual
conflict with the Shiite Arab pastoralnomads of the south as refractory
taxpayers and frequent raiders of sedentary settlements for booty.
Nestled in the territory dominated by Shiite tribespeople were the
shrine cities of Karbala and Najaf, burial sites of Imams whose
remains were sacred to adherents of that branch of Islam.

The city of Karbala lies about 45 miles south-west of Baghdad. It
owes its inception and continued prosperity to its possession of the
shrine of the Imam Husayn, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad,
who died in a revolt against the Umayyad state in 680. Religious
visits to its shrines (often combined with trade) and the influx into
the city of wealth in the form of pious offerings and endowments
combined to lend it economic, religious and political importance. It
also served in a secular capacity as a desert port for long-distance

trade.6 The shrine of the Imam Husayn particularlyattractedpilgrims
of the Shiite branch of Islam. After 1501 Iran's population was largely
converted to Shiism from Sunnism by the Shiite rulers of the Safavid
dynasty, who bestowed lavish gifts on the city's shrines. Although
the Safavids and their Sunni Ottoman foes contested much of Iraq,
Karbala remained mostly in the hands of the Turks.

The city's population, partly drawn from the Shiite Arab tribes of
southern Iraq, often chafed under Ottoman rule. The political turmoil
of eighteenth-century Iran, with its Afghan invasions and the fall of
the Safavids, also encouraged large numbers of Iranian refugees to
settle in Najaf and Karbala. In the nineteenth century Iranian mer-
chants and noblemen resided there out of a pious wish to be near
the shrines or because Iran turned politically dangerous for them.
Although Iranian immigrants over time assimilated to Iraq, many
maintained their distinctive national costume, knowledge of Persian
and underground allegiance to Iran. Because of its prevailing Shiism
and the large Iranian ethnic element, Ottoman officials saw Karbala
as a potential fifth column.

In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the city govern-
ment, staffed at the top by Mamluk-appointed Sunnis from Baghdad,
controlled many of Karbala'ssources of wealth, including the shrines
and rights to tax. But this Sunni structure was superimposed over a
local Shiite Arab elite of property-holders. Prominent Arab families
owed their local power to control over great economic resources. For
instance, one local magnate, the chief of the city's powerful Sayyid
families (asserting their descent from the Prophet Muhammad),
owned one-third of the cultivated lands and gardens in the vicinity
of Karbala. In the 1820s and 1830s local notables, by processes to be
discussed below, moved into actual rulership of the town as a virtual
city-state. Sayyid 'Abdu'l-Wahhab, head of Karbala's elite families,
became governor of the city in the late 1830s by order of the Ottoman
viceroy Ali Riza Pasha.7

The majority of Karbala'sinhabitants consisted of labourers, semi-
skilled tradesmen, pedlars and small-time shopkeepers. Many of
them ethnic Iranians, they resembled in culture and social situation
their Iranian counterparts, called pishih-varanor tradespeople.8 The

equivalent of the European "little people" (menupeuple), the trades-
people of Karbala, like the great merchants and the city government,
exploited the pilgrim trade. They expected the city's governor to
assure them of a livelihood by encouraging the pilgrims and by
ensuring safety for Iranian visitors coming to Karbala. Largely Shi-
ites, they took pride in living in Imam Husayn's city and in having
easy access to his shrine. Lavish gifts to the shrines by the Iranian
monarchs and the nawabs of Awadh (Oudh) in India lent a certain
splendour to the shrine city, in which the little people basked.9

They frequently gathered in public assembly to celebrate holy days
associated with the Imams and particularly to commemorate the
martyrdom of Husayn. The social networks they developed for the
purpose of organizing religious processions could also be called into
play at times of political crisis. Karbala's little people were easily
stirred to defend the city from Baghdad's attempts to bring it under
firmer control - as they did in 1824, 1835 and 1842-3. Such disturb-
ances resembled European "church and king" riots, for the Shiite
tradespeople held an allegiance to the shah of Iran and would sacrifice
a great deal to exclude alien Sunni troops.10

THE KARBALA "MAFIA"

The 1820s and 1830s saw a growth in Karbala of the power of local
elites in relation to the centre. As will be shown below, urban gang
leaders running protection rackets displaced or co-opted the old
landholding and merchant families and formed links with nearby
Arab tribes. They also allied themselves with the city's leading
religious scholars. In this manner they created a coalition of groups
interested in autonomy, whether for financial or religious reasons,
from the Ottomans.

together to defend their quarter of the city, commonly appeared in
medieval Iraq. These youths, called 'ayyarun,probably derived from
families of tradespeople and labourers, ratherthan from elite families.
Sometimes they gained great power in their quarter and engaged in
fights with the youths of other quarters. At the margins of urban
society these groups sometimes elided into the genuine underworld
of vagabonds and thieves.1

While the gangs that came to dominate Karbala in the first half of
the nineteenth century had a similar historical background, they
became more than merely lower-class neighbourhood youth clubs.
The Karbala gangs were often headed by outsiders and included in
their numbers fugitives and deserters from the military. They grew
far more powerful than medieval chivalric organizations, coming to
rule the city in alliance with local nobles. In short, they underwent
a peculiarly early modern transformation, and, refracted in this
modern lens, begin to look familiar to the comparative historian.
They begin to look like "mafia".

All the elements of mafia, as defined by Hobsbawm, Hess and
others, appear in Karbala.12 These include avoidance of invoking
state law and a preference for settling grudges through toughness and
a code of manly honour; a patronagesystem with bosses and retainers;
and control of the community's life by an officially unrecognized
system of gangs. Such mafia must be clearly distinguished from
random urban criminals on the one hand, and from rural peasant
bantditson the other. The mafioso lacks complete legitimacy, but
erects a quasi-governmental structure with the help of notable-class
bosses. Unlike gangsters in a region with a strong state, mafiosi
existed in a vacuum of state power, and therefore performed a real
service in providing protection, albeit coercive and violent.

that ruled Palermo in medieval times.

Mafia-like groups, commonplace in Iraqi and Iranian cities, went
by the generic name of luti or awbash.13 In the Levant they were
called qabadayat. The Karbala mafiosi, though differing from their
Sicilian contemporariesin being urban ratherthan village-based, also
erected a parallel structure of authority based on extortion rackets
and the private use of force, and led by the wealthy. The main factors
in Hobsbawm's typology of the Sicilian mafia - the need to defend
an entire society from threats to its way of life, the aspirations of the
various classes it encompassed and the personal ambitions of vigorous
leaders - all played a part in Karbala's mafia as well.

Mafias remain comparativelylittle known, aside from that in Sicily,
but Hobsbawm and Hess have described the early modern historical
conditions under which they arise. First, they come into power in a
frontier situation of weak state authority - in rural, remote areas
like the island of Sicily. Karbalafits this suggestion as a Shiite, partly
Iranian, enclave. Both Sicily and southern Iraq had for centuries
been colonially ruled by distant and shifting centres, so that in
neither area did the people invest the formal government with much
legitimacy.

The emergence of a new elite where the previously powerful classes
have less access to traditional sources of authority also contributes to
mafiaformation. In Sicily mafiasappearedin the wake of the abolition
of feudalism and the rise of new rural middle classes. As Hess
suggested, the mafia arose as a parallel government after the old
feudal order broke down, but before a modern state emerged and
pressed its claims to Weberian monopoly over the use of force. When
the modern state asserts itself the status of the mafioso changes from
subcultural folk-hero to criminal.

Karbala's foreign, government-appointed Sunni elite was expelled
from the city as Mamluk rule grew weak in the 1820s. The indigenous

neighbourhood organizations of the popular classes, which he calls lutigar, and the
gangs or awbash; both are commonly referred to as lutis. The Turks in Iraq referred
to the lutis as yaramaz or good-for-nothings, and as girami.

Shiite Arab notables attempted to take their place in monopolizing
the city's resources, but lacked a disciplined armed force and had no
tradition of legitimate rule. Karbala'ssources of wealth - pilgrimage
and trade - required security. The Shiite notables therefore de-
pended on retainers recruited from among brigands. Unexpectedly
the neighbourhood ruffians and desperate fugitives that the notables
hired emerged as powers in their own right. Ibrahim Za'farani
provided protection and gathered tribute for the magnate Sayyid
'Abdu'l-Wahhab, growing wealthy enough through extortion, fraud
and intimidation to enter the propertied elite himself. The sons of
petty shopkeepers and minor clergy began to rival old landed Sayyid
families in wealth and influence by virtue of their command of armed
force. In the 1830s and 1840s the old Shiite elites made common
cause with the rising gang leaders to resist Ottoman reforms.

The city's gangs split into a minority Iranianfaction and a majority
Arab grouping. The Iranians were led by Mirza Salih, son of an
Iranianfather from Shiraz and an Arab mother from a family of Shiite
jurisprudentsbased in Karbala. Mirza Salih's major ally commanded
his own gang of 60-150 Baluchis from Fars province in Iran.14

Sayyid Ibrahim Za'farani headed the far larger Arab faction of
gang members. His father, an Iranian from Baku, married an Arab
woman in Karbala, settling there to sell his saffron. European indus-
trially-made stuffs in the 1830s devastated Iraqi textile manufactur-
ing.15 It remains unknown whether Za'farani's family suffered
business losses because of European competition. Sayyid Ibrahim
grew up to indigence, hung about with toughs and finally joined the
gangs. He came to prominence by killing one of their leaders. He
then formed a policy of liberally distributing booty from criminal
activities to his followers, which made him more popular with the
rank and file than other gang leaders. He also exhibited a daring that
elicited the admiration of his men, mastering the sort of intrigue that
could remove dangerous foes and putting together a loose coalition
of Arab gangs within the city. Both major gang bosses, Za'farani
and Salih, "men of the people", derived from lower-middle-class
backgrounds. Through a code of "honour" based on courage, cun-

ning and violence, they gained the respect and fear of the little people
from whom they sprang by rising to a position of wealth and power.

The fourteen major gangs, including those grouped around Mirza
Salih, ranged in size from 50 or 60 men to 400. Some specialized in
particularkinds of extortion; one gang, for instance, farmed the city
market or bazaar. Many gangsters came as fugitives from outside
Karbala. In addition to the gangs, Za'farani employed his Arab
relatives on his mother's side to build an alliance with the neighbour-
ing Arab pastoral nomads. He brought the leader of one tribe into
the city with 300 men to bolster his own position. Five other Arab
tribal leaders outside the city allied themselves with Za'farani. All
Shiites, they had frequently come into conflict with the Ottoman
government.

Although it lay well within Iraq's borders, Karbala had the air
of a frontier town. The population showed hostility to the Sunni
government in Baghdad, which could seldom station its Sunni troops
there without endless trouble. The city became an ideal hide-out for
all the murderers, thieves, embezzlers and army deserters in Iran and
Iraq. These underworld elements (mostly Arab) mingled with the
often Iranian labourers, small-time pedlars and shopkeepers of Kar-
bala's markets, and built up protection rackets aimed at milking the
retailers, merchants and pilgrims. The rough, desperate and well-
armed toughs organized themselves into large gangs, so that in the
absence of a strong central government pilgrims and inhabitants had
little choice but to pay a "godfather" for his protection.

Gang chiefs accumulated enough capital in this manner to begin
buying land, the most important asset in the nineteenth-century
Middle East, and to live in the best houses in the city. A group of
about 2,500 lutisruled and inspired dread in the city whose population
averaged 20,000, for even though the inhabitants greased gang mem-
bers' palms well, they often stole or raped anyway.16 Members of the
old elite, like 'Abdu'l-Wahhab, helped create the corrupt system by
acting as patrons of the thugs, gladly paying off one gang to protect
themselves from the others.

THE SHIITE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE MAFIA
The various groups within Karbala were united by a religious con-
sciousness of being Shiites and by a perception of the Ottomans as

P.R.O., F.O. 248/108, Farrant to Canning, 15 May 1843. There were 3,400

houses in Karbala and the population fluctuated between 20,000 normally and 80,000
at pilgrimage times. Estimates as high as 10,000 for the lutis are given, but this
probably results from confusing the gangs with the lower classes in general: see 'Abbas
al'-Azzawi, Ta'rikhal-'Iraq baynihtilalayn[History of Iraq between Two Occupations],
8 vols. (Baghdad, 1955), vii, p. 65.

the same Sunni enemy that had persecuted the Imams and all their
partisans down the ages. The gang leaders offered these diverse
elements an alternative to Sunni Ottoman control of the town.

The Shiite scholars viewed the Hidden Imam as the only ultimately
just ruler, although most of them in this period accepted, as the best
they could achieve, a temporal power that established order and
allowed them to enforce their version of the holy law.17 While the
religious scholars (and indeed many other sectors of the town's
population) no doubt deplored the uglier aspects of gang rule, they
probably considered it no more evil or illegitimate than they did the
prospect of Sunni control.

The Shiite religious scholars saw major advantages in keeping the
city out of Ottoman control. If the Turks re-established their hold on
the town, they would put the lucrative shrine endowments and
income under the charge of Ottoman officials. They would refer cases
to the Ottoman-appointed religious court judge (qadi) rather than to
the Shiite jurisprudents, and would prescribe the mention of the
Ottoman emperor's name in the Friday prayer sermons. Finally, they
would impose restrictions on the open performanceof the Shiite form
of Islamic rituals.18

Moreover the Shiite establishment itself suffered deep and bitter
divisions and therefore the leading scholars themselves became em-
broiled in the factious turbulence of Karbala'sgang-dominated poli-
tics. This conflict ranged the rationalist Usuli jurisprudents against
the more intuitional Shaykhis, followers of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i
(d. 1826).19

The struggle between the two parties, which led many Usuli
scholars to excommunicate the Shaykh and his followers, centred on
al-Ahsa'i's metaphorical explanations of key doctrines such as the

discussed below, that led to the messianic Babi movement that shook mid-nineteenth-
century Iraq and Iran.

Ahmad's preference for intuitive knowledge (which he said he ob-
tained by inspiration directly from the Imams) would seriously under-
mine the authority of their position, based on technical legal
knowledge derived from the principle of reasoned endeavour.

In Karbalathe Shaykhis were led by Sayyid Kazim Rashti, Shaykh
Ahmad's successor, and the Usulis by the jurisprudent Sayyid Ibra-
ham Qazvini. This division of the Shiite religious establishment
played directly into the hands of the gang leaders. Once one of the
leading clergy had offered patronage to a gang leader, his rival had
to seek the protection of one of the other gangs or risk violence and
intimidation. Major religious scholars traditionally established links
with gangs in most Iraniancities. This mutually beneficialrelationship
provided the cleric with a force that could enforce his decisions,
collect his religious taxes and agitate in his favour, often in opposition
to the local governor. The gangs, on the other hand, had a protector
with whom they could take refuge if the governor moved against
them.

In Karbala Za'farani robbed Qazvini of 4,000 qirans. Qazvini
sought the protection of Mirza Salih and his faction, and Za'farani
announced himself a disciple of Rashti. Mirza Salih even appears
listed among Qazvini's students, showing that more than one sort of
bond linked the two.20 It appears that Rashti did not relish being
protected by Za'farani, for as soon as the Shaykhi leader sensed the
Ottoman determination to reassert control, he broke his links with
the gang leader in order to assume a mediatory role.

THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF OTTOMAN RULE IN IRAQ
Now let us turn to the temporal dimension. In the course of the
eighteenth century the Ottoman empire lost control over many of its
outlying provinces, accepting vassal states of sometimes dubious
loyalty. The most successful such states were headed by adventurous
members of the Ottoman or Mamluk military classes - as in Egypt,
Palestine and Iraq. The weakened empire also faced tribal revolts in
Arabia and Kurdistan. The valley-lords of Anatolia, who had much
more organic roots in the local power structurethan did the Mamluks,
likewise made a bid for more autonomy. Karbala in the 1820s was
twice-removed from Istanbul's grasp, a city-state in a vassal realm of

tenuous allegiance. The gang leaders of Karbala, though urban rather
than rural, most resembled the valley-lords, who also often came as
close to banditry as to government.21

In the late eighteenth century and the first decade of the nineteenth
the Mamluks kept a quite strong hold over Karbala. Relations be-
tween the town and Baghdad were at least correct. Moreover the city
desperately needed the central government. In April 1801 12,000
tribesmen from Najd in Arabia, adherents of the puritanical Sunni
reformist sect founded by Ibn 'Abdu'l-Wahhab, pillaged Karbalafor
booty and as an act of iconoclasm.22 In 1801 the Mamluk governor
of the city fled before the Wahhabi advance, later being executed by
the Mamluk ruler for not having defended Karbala. This act of
retribution aimed at emphasizing the solidarity of the urban-based
government with the citizens. It may also have been a sop to Iran,
which threatened to annex the shrine cities if the Mamluks could not
protect them.23

While Karbala'smerchants left the city temporarilyafterthe attack,
and one Indian traveller found it falling into decay in 1803, no major
problems then existed between the Sunni Mamluk administration
and the Shiite population. The travellersaid the considerable revenue
yielded to the state by pilgrims led Sunni officials to tolerate Shiites
in the shrine cities, even though they spat on them elsewhere.24With
the Egyptians' assertion of control over much of Arabia, and their
quelling of Wahhabi revivalism, Karbala's security on its Arabian
flank improved.

Relations between Baghdad and Karbala deteriorated after 1820,
partly because of poorer political relations between Iran and Iraq. In

1821 war broke out between the two and the Qajar governor of
Kirmanshah led Iranian troops into Iraqi territory, reaching almost
to Baghdad before a plague outbreak forced him to make peace and
withdraw. The war set the stage for Mamluk ruler Da'ud Pasha's
1824 siege of Karbala. The government acted out of a desire to

reassert central control over the town in the wake of conflict with the
city's foreign patron, Iran. But the siege was made necessary partly
because Karbala had become dangerously autonomous from the
Mamluks, falling into the hands of local notables and their hired
protectors, unruly gangs. The siege, which forced many of the
inhabitants to flee to Kazimayn, ended in stalemate rather than in
occupation.25

From 1826 the reforming Sultan Mahmud II determined to reinte-
grate these provinces into the centralized empire. In 1830 he sent an
envoy to Baghdad with the aim of replacing the Mamluk ruler Da'ud
Pasha, who executed Istanbul's man. In retaliation the emperor
sent an Ottoman army against Baghdad in 1831 that subdued and
destroyed the Mamluks, replacing them with a Turkish governor (Ali
Riza Pasha) responsible directly to the central government.26While
reforms proceeded in Turkey, weakening tax-farmersas well as the
power of intermediary social groups like military lords and religious
scholars, the task of centralizing power in Iraq began.

Just as the independence of the Kurdish and Arab tribespeople
stood in the way of this process, so did the semi-autonomy of Karbala.
Ottoman viceroy Ali Riza Pasha, a member of the Shiite-influenced
Bektashi order who mourned for the Imam Husayn annually, sympa-
thized with the Shiites.27 But he came into conflict with them when
he attempted to appoint a governor for Karbala, for the powerful
gangs murdered or drove away the government's man when he proved
a threat to their interests. Such effrontery led the Pasha to demand
the right to perform a pilgrimage to the shrine of Husayn, thus
reasserting the prerogatives of the centre. In this period, too, some
members of the powerful propertied-class groups like Sayyids and
the clergy were demanding that the government intervene against the
gangs.28

In the summer of 1835 a show-down occurred between the Ottoman
governor and the people of Karbala. The British political agent in
Baghdad wrote that the Pasha was planning to attack the town with
3,000 regulars.29 As reports from 1843 demonstrate, the Ottoman
viceroy found himself too weak to occupy the town and struck a deal
with the gangs.30 He considered a long-term occupation of the city
to be unfeasible and after a show of strength indicated a willingness
to compromise.

The Ottoman viceroy broke with tradition by appointing as gover-
nor someone neither Sunni nor from Baghdad, tacitly recognizing
the power of the new coalition of local gangs and their patrons. He
put 'Abdu'l-Wahhab, scion of an Arab landed family with strong
links with the Arab gangs led by Za'farani, in charge of the city. In
return for this appointment 'Abdu'l-Wahhab pledged to increase
payments to Baghdad to 70,000 qirans. The new governor appropri-
ated a large portion of municipal revenues to himself and robbed the
city's two major shrines of some of their treasures. He used part of
the money to pay Za'faranifor protection against his foe, Mirza Salih,
and gained influence over personages like the Iranian consul by
lending him large sums of money. He cultivated the nearby Arab
chiefs, allowing them to store their booty in the city.31 The govern-
ment of Karbala came directly into the hands of the gangs, which
encouraged further immigration of toughs into the city.

Given the reports that reached British ears in the 1830s that many
of the city's elite members wanted the Ottomans to overthrow gang
rule, we must ask how the citizens were able to muster enough
solidarity to face down the Ottoman viceroy. The answer is surely
that, in addition to the armed gangs, Karbala's tradespeople also
played a crucial role in ensuring the relative independence of their
city. Indeed the issue of autonomy aroused them more than any
other. The famous incidents of Karbalamob action are not food riots
like the market strikes of northern Iran, but political ones.32 As with
crowds elsewhere, the Karbalalittle people rioted to achieve a specific

aim: they wished to prove by their violence that to take the city street
by street would cost government troops too dearly. They sought to
keep the troops of the "foreign" central government, whether Mam-
luk or Ottoman, outside the city walls as much as possible. They
often supported local families of wealth and power against generals
sent from Baghdad.33

The crowd sought to preserve their ways of life and city rights in
the face of modern Ottoman centralization. Ottoman reforms, in
turn, constituted a response to the economic and political power of
industrializing Europe. The Turkish reformers made an assault on
tax-farming and other pre-modern institutions and sought to centra-
lize power. Both at the Ottoman centre, Istanbul, and in the peripher-
ies of the empire such reforms provoked resistancefrom social groups
whose interests they threatened, including skilled artisans, tax-farm-
ing military men and the religious scholars. In the Karbala riots of
the 1830s and 1840s we witness a crowd defending itself from rapid
social change.34

Meanwhile the prospects of the Ottoman empire for the reassertion
of central control were improving. The 1840 Treaty of London,
backed by four European powers, put an end to the Egyptianviceroy's
bid to take over the empire. The Ottoman emperor, having regained
Syria, hoped also to take direct control of the Hijaz. Ali Riza Pasha
watched these events closely from Baghdad, aware of their regional
implications.35 But just as the proclamation of reforms helped spark
a revolt in Rumelia in 1841 by Christian peasants eager for improve-
ment in their situation, so the centralizing tendencies of the empire
provoked a backlash from the Shiites of southern Iraq.36

In September 1842 a new viceroy of Iraq arrived in Baghdad,
Muhammad Najib (Mehmet Necip) Pasha. This official - former
minister of justice, a staunch conservative and Ottoman chauvinist
with intimate ties to the new emperor, Abdiilmecid - had opposed
the reforms for giving too much away to minorities. The reformers
therefore sent him away from Istanbul to serve as viceroy of the
Damascus province in January 1841. In Syria Najib Pasha became
convinced of the need for greater centralized control. He attempted

to subdue the bedouins, treated the Christian minority severely, and
succeeded in excluding British military advisers from the province.
Indeed he so antagonized the western powers while in Syria that
Istanbul finally transferred him to Baghdad, though he retained the
emperor's confidence.37

Najib Pasha also wanted strong control of Iraq, which meant facing
down the Arab tribes and the urban gangs in the Shiite south. Only
about forty days after his arrival in Baghdad the Pasha set off on 23
October for Musayyib on the Euphrates, where Serasker Sadullah
Pasha had preceded him with some troops, and pitched camp. He
gave it out that he intended to oversee repairs to the Hindiyyah canal,
for which money had recently been donated by the government of
Awadh. The canal would help drain marsh land in which refractory
Arab tribes took refuge, and would help get water to restive peasants
in Hillah.38

Rumours began to circulate that Najib Pasha intended to march
on Karbala. The Shaykhi leader Rashti wrote to the Iranian consul
in Karbala "that many Persians were daily coming to him for advice,
and begged him to go to the Pacha's camp, or to write him to know
his intentions".39 The consul wrote to the Pasha during this period,
but his letters concerned injuries done to Iraniancitizens by the gangs
rather than any possible advance on the shrine city. Iranian families
panicked and began leaving for Baghdad.

THE DECISION TO INVADE
Meanwhile Najib Pasha sent to Karbalafor provisions and sent word
that he intended to visit the shrine of Imam Husayn. Municipal
authorities replied coldly, offering him only a token amount of
provisions and telling him that he could come into the city for the
visit only if he left his main force outside and retained only four or
five bodyguards. The Pasha, livid on receiving this reply, threatened
to take the city by force. Before he began his advance, on 18 Novem-
ber, he wrote to the embassies of Britain, France and Iran, detailing
his reasons for contemplating military action.

The previous year Ali Riza Pasha had made the same request and
also received a reply from city leaders that they would allow him in

with only ten or fifteen persons as a retinue. He finally returned to
Baghdad without performing the visit. Najib Pasha considered his
predecessor to have erred in appointing citizens of Karbala tax-
farmers and allowing the city to become a refuge for criminal ele-
ments. He believed that excluding the Pasha from his own territory
constituted "a final demonstration of the revolt of the town".40
The omission of the Ottoman emperor's name from the concluding
sermons at Friday congregational prayers - a mention made else-
where in Iraq - further symbolized Karbala'sindependence.41 Here
the city's religious scholars again demonstrated their opposition to
Sunni Ottoman rule.

Najib Pasha said that the violence of the gangs in Karbalaalarmed
him, accusing Za'farani and his men of murdering and robbing at
will. The Pasha reported that the gang chief had robbed even eminent
Shiite scholars and had raped and murdered a lady of reputation.42
But the strategic implications of Karbala's status disturbed him even
more. He saw it as an Iranian-dominated stronghold, complaining
that ten thousand Iranian subjects had congregated in the shrine city,
but no such concentration of Turks existed in Iran. He insisted that
all Muslims revered the shrines in Karbala, that the place belonged
to the Ottoman empire and that Iranians only had the right to visit
there once a year.43 Such an Iranian population centre, controlled by
gangs, lying in his rear with powerful Arab tribes in the vicinity,
represented a Trojan horse for his government were hostilities with
Iran to break out.44

The city responded to the Pasha's threats in mid-November by
holding meetings and closing ranks. The elite at first reached a
consensus that they should refuse entry to Najib Pasha's troops and
defend the town, proposing to buy him off with a sum of money.
Gang leaders showed particulardetermination to keep the Turks out,
because they would threaten their control over the city. The flight of
wealthy and influential Iranian families to Baghdad alarmed the
toughs, who put pressure on them to stay, with all their extensive
resources. 45

The gangs argued that the former governor's siege of 1824 had
proved unsuccessful. Moreover they emphasized the need of Shiites

to defend the holy city from Sunni Turkish incursions. Artisans and
shopkeepers had no choice but to stay because they feared they would
lose what (largely immovable) property they owned should they
depart. That eminent members of the Qajar royal family, like the
Zillu's-Sultan (then in political exile), elected to remain gave heart to
the poor and middle-class Iranians.46

The Iranian consul in Baghdad attempted to negotiate with Najib
Pasha, requesting six months of grace to allow Iranians to leave the
town. He later said he wrote the Shaykhi leader Rashti two letters
warning that the new Ottoman viceroy was deadly serious in his
threat to occupy the city, but Rashti said he never received the
missives.47 Najib Pasha rejected any suggestion that he delay six
months in entering the town.

Several city leaders, not including the gang leaders, attempted to
negotiate directly with the Ottoman viceroy. The exiled Iranianprince
Zillu's-Sultan, Rashti, 'Abdu'l-Wahhab and other members of the
dlite went together to the Pasha's camp at Musayyib. Najib demanded
the right to station 300-500 troops inside the city, insisting that the
gangs stop operating their rackets and that Za'faranicome to him for
an audience. 'Abdu'l-Wahhab replied that some troops might be
stationed in Karbala, but that the gangs would never agree to the
other terms. The city's governor offered to have Za'faranimurdered
if only he were given enough time, and Rashti also showed a willing-
ness to abandon Za'farani. In the alliance of nobles and bosses
that underpins any mafia, the nobles generally consider the mafiosi
expendable. This and several further attempts at negotiation foun-
dered on the intransigence of the gangs and of Najib Pasha, though
Rashti and Zillu's-Sultan fought hard for a compromise that would
allow Turkish troops into the city.48

On 11 December 1842 Najib Pasha wrote to Zillu's-Sultan and
Rashti, asking them to warn the Iranians to separatethemselves from
the gangs and to leave the town or take refuge in the shrines of
Husayn or 'Abbas. He cautioned the two leaders that he intended to
use force against the gangs should they oppose him, but offered
protection to neutral civilians. He said, "whoever of all the people of

the Town takes refuge with you, assure and satisfy him of safety".49
Najib Pasha thus recognized that they had negotiated in good faith,
but he also attempted by safety pledges to drive a wedge between the
members of the Karbala coalition. He failed to separate the Iranian
tradespeople from the gangs, however, because they could not afford
the suddenly astronomical price of carriage out of the city for their
families and so had to stay and make a stand.

THE ADVANCE ON KARBALA

Gang leaders made feverish preparationsto defend the city, arranging
for their allies from the Arab tribes to come there in force. The
Ottoman viceroy, alarmed, dispatched Serasker Sadullah Pasha with
three regiments of infantry, one of cavalry and twenty guns. About
19 December 1842 he arrived at Imam-Nuk, a mile and a half south-
east of Karbala. They received sporadic sniper fire but did not return
it. Their arrival provoked another attempt at negotiation, again led
by Rashti and Zillu's-Sultan, which involved the giving of gang
hostages in exchange for the Turkish withdrawal of all but 500 men.
This effort met failure when Najib Pasha rejected its terms even after
Sadullah Pasha had accepted it.50

The day after the viceroy's negative message arrived, around 22

December, Sadullah Pasha sent his soldiers out to occupy some
favourable positions. Observers on the city walls informed Arab
tribespeople and Karbala's labourers and artisans of these strategic
troop movements. Fearing an attack, a mob gathered and went out
to assault the soldiers, whom they drove back. The crowd captured
several artillery pieces and overturned others, retiring at sunset.
While the attack by the crowd appears to have had an element of
spontaneity in it, the people had hardly acted randomly. It served as
a further indication of the militance of the little people and their
distrust of the Ottomans.51

The unyielding mood of the crowd may have been reinforced by
religious rivalries. Had Rashti succeeded in his negotiations with the
Ottomans, his position within the city would have been much streng-

thened. Rivals like the gang leader Mirza Salih and the Usuli scholars
did not wish to see this happen. One of Rashti's disciples later wrote:
"However much the noble Sayyid endeavoured to dampen the fire
of this rebellion through conciliation and forbearance, his opponents
declaredthat they would rathersee theirwomen and children prisoners
in the hands of the Turks than to have this dispute settled by him".52

A pro-Shaykhi source written in 1888 indicates that Usuli scholars
helped incite tradespeople to attack the Ottoman forces, partly to
thwart Rashti. A rumour spread that one of the clergy had seen a
dream of 'Abbas, the brother of Imam Husayn, who asked him to
promulgate holy war against the Turks and promised him ultimate
success.53 In a shrine city such rumours of supernaturalaid contri-
buted to a feeling that the holy places were impregnable, and shaped
the militant popular mentality of the citizens. But on the practical
plane the labourers and tradespeople had no choice but to stay and
fight. Their action without doubt helped dishearten the Ottomans,
as it aimed to do. It also demonstrated that "the crowd" acted in the
revolt independently of the gangs.

THE SIEGE OF KARBALA
After the mob riot against the Turkish troops, the gangs made
extensive preparations to withstand a siege, drawing on the military
and technological knowledge of the army desertersamong their ranks.
They prevented anyone from leaving the city, though carriage was
anyway unavailable by then. For the rest of December the Turks
fired on or over the town to frighten the inhabitants. Towards the
end of December Zillu's-Sultan wrote from the Serasker's camp to
Qazvini, then in Baghdad, that the thousands of shots fired into the
city had damaged tens of buildings, including shrines. He estimated
forty inhabitants of Karbala dead in the shelling and put Turkish
casualties at a thousand. He said of the Ottomans, who were comman-
deering muleteers for their logistics, that: "Their camp too is in great
distress almost approaching to a famine, but in Karbala food is
abundant and cheap".54

ing the Iranian faction within the city, left Baghdad to begin another
round of negotiations with Najib Pasha. But, out of touch with the
determined mood of Karbala, they reachedterms rejectedby city lead-
ers. Rashti wrote to the Iranianconsul urging him to come to Karbala,
but he retiredinstead to the safetyof Baghdad. Tragically, those within
the besieged town took his action as a sign that no attack was immi-
nent.55

Karbala'scitizenry during the siege showed a die-hardcommitment
across a range of social classes to maintaining local autonomy. The
roots of this stance lay in the popular mentality that prevailed during
the revolt. Although quixotic given the fire-power ranged against
them, their underlying attitude had some basis in local experience.
First, the coalition of urban gangs, mob and tribesmen had already
averted two occupations in the previous twenty years, one as recently
as 1835. The inhabitants of Karbala had grown used to a weak and
corrupt government in Baghdad which they could bribe or face down.
They remained ignorant of the sea change the reforms had wrought
in Ottoman lands, and as yet unreconciled to the greatercentralization
these entailed. Secondly, poor communications among the Karbala
leaders in and outside the city led to an underestimationof the danger.
Thirdly, rumours were planted that the shah of Iran would dispatch
an army of 20,000 men to aid the beleaguered city, and Arab tribal
leaders promised another 12,000 reinforcements.56 The myth that
outside assistance was on the way shored up morale and made the
people less willing to compromise.

Finally, religious feelings affected the judgment of the crowd, with
gang and other city leaders stirring up hate for Sunnis. Tradesmen
and labourers lined the city walls to hurl down invective on the Turks
and on Sunni holy figures. The clergy contributed to the sectarian
rancour, and though they did not join in actual fighting they did help
repair damaged walls. The religious official in charge of the shrine
of 'Abbas (who therefore stood to lose a great deal should the Turks
come in) thwarted one set of talks by standing up in the assembly,
dashing his turban to the ground and excommunicating anyone who
spoke of giving up the town and their wives to the "infidel" Turks.
Some preachers boldly proclaimed that the city was engaged in a holy
war. While classical Shiite thought held that during the Twelfth
Imam's absence believers could wage no holy war against Sunni

Muslims, the clerics put such legal niceties aside during the siege.57
Classical doctrine was one thing, the impassioned rhetoric of desper-
ate clergymen another.

The major dissenting view from the popular mentality just des-
cribed originated with the Shaykhi leader Rashti. Lt.-Col. Farrant
reported that he "did all in his power to prevent hostilities, he
preached against their proceedings, he was abused and threatened,
they would not listen to him".58 Although Za'faranihad announced
himself Rashti's follower, the Shaykhi leader's actions demonstrate
that he much preferred a conventional government of the Sunnis to
the semi-anarchy of even pro-Shaykhi gang rule.

The gang-led coalition in Karbalabased itself primarilyon violence
and coercion, though yearning for regional autonomy played a part.
It therefore exhibited weaknesses and could fall apart in the face of
stronger forces. The old landed elite also demonstrated a certain
ambivalence in choosing between the gangs and the Ottomans, though
they had not the courage to speak out as had Rashti.

The Shaykhis' minority view of events also involved millennialist
ideas. Rashti traditionally devoted the fasting month of Ramadan to
discussing the characteristics of the promised Mahdi, who would
restore justice to the world. The fasting month fell in October 1842,
when it increasingly looked as if Najib Pasha might invade. An
eyewitness writing six or seven years later said that Rashti elucidated
the coming of this messianic figure with particulardetail that year.59
The siege took place in the closing months of A.H. 1258, and the
Shiite world in the nineteenth century was pervaded by apocalyptic
speculations that the promised one (Mahdi) would appear in 1260/
1844, a little over a year later.60 In Shaykhi circles, where these

defensive holy war against non-Muslims in the time of the Occultation of the Imam.
In the first quarter of the nineteenth century militant Usuli ulama repeatedly argued
that it was permissible, with reference to Russia. See A. K. S. Lambton, "A Nineteenth

speculations received particular emphasis, political quietism and
eschewing of holy war against the Sunnis may have been linked with
expectations of the imminent advent of a supernaturaldeliverer.

The five days after the breakdown of the fourth set of negotiations
witnessed frantic activity on both sides of the struggle. The gang
leaders in Karbala faced increasing difficulties in provisioning and
garrisoning the 5,000 Arab tribesmen that had assembled within its
walls to aid the defence effort. Ammunition grew so scarce that people
tore out the rails around the shrine of 'Abbas and melted them down
for shot.61 The Turkish troops also faced great hardship, because
the high Euphrates prevented provisions from reaching them from
Baghdad, and they suffered from the cold. Using Arab labour and
artillery blasts, they cut through the date grove protecting the city
walls and finally had to fight a fierce battle with gang forces in order
to take up a new position at a tomb just outside the city.62

THE OCCUPATION

Logistical problems and a high desertion rate forced Sadullah Pasha
to decide whether to act or withdraw altogether, and around 10
January a meeting of the officers decided to take the city by force.
On 12 JanuaryTurkish artillery blasted a breach in the wall between
the Najaf and Khan gates large enough to allow an assault. One more
round of peace talks opened at this point and city leaders were on
the verge of accepting the Serasker's terms when the chief of the
Iraniangangs, Mirza Salih, made an impassioned plea that they trust
in God and the Prophet and defy the Turks to the end. The Iranians
had emerged as the hard-liners, perhaps because they most fervently
believed the shah's forces were on the way to aid them.

The Ottoman envoy returned empty-handed to this camp, from
which artillery barrages began again and went on till sunset, when
both sides settled down for a freezing night. The Arab tribesmen,
now 8,000 strong, threatened to leave because of poor meals and cold
nights watching the city gates. The gangs therefore billeted them on
the civilian population, with whom they celebrated the Muslim
festival of sacrifice until late. As all Muslims observed this holy day,
they assumed the Turks would do the same, and remained in homes

rather than returning to their posts. The gangsters, distrusting the
Arabs' steadfastness, nailed the gates shut.63

The Ottoman officers planned out their assault. Three divisions
commanded by the leader of the Mosul brigade were to lead the
attack. The first would hold the breach, the second would enter the
town and open the Najaf gate and the third would commandeer the
bastions nearest them, turning the big guns on the city. As an
incentive to the disheartened troops, one officer promised to allow
them to do whatever they pleased once inside and pledged 150piasters
for every luti head.64

Before dawn on 13 January 1843 the advance divisions set out,
with heavy covering fire from the Ottoman artillery. They had almost
reached the breach unopposed when the alarm went out that the
Turks were approaching. Both Arabs and citizens rushed to the
defence, commanded by an Arab gang leader, but they could not
prevent the Ottomans from gaining the breach. The Turks lost 200
men in the assault. The gang forces ran low on powder and were
forced to retreat to the cover of neighbouring houses, where they
kept up fire. One Ottoman division sneaked along the inside of the
wall to the Najaf gate, killing the sentinels and swinging it open.
Sadullah Pasha immediately moved the main force into the town,
while another officer dispatched divisions along the walls to secure
other gates, and one through the centre of the town that attracted
sniper fire from roof-tops. Many men detached themselves from the
main body to raid houses for booty.

The force advancing along the wall drove a crowd of mixed civilians
and Arab tribesmen before it as they frantically sought egress from
the sealed or jammed city gates. At one partiallyopen gate the Turks

fired into the crowd with devastating effect. Za'faraniand 200 of his
gangsters fled from the al-Hurr gate, to which they had the key. The
Iranian gangs, led by Mirza Salih, remained for the fight, as did the
governor, 'Abdu'l-Wahhab. Most of the gang leaders had already
sent away their families. Several thousand Arabs followed Za'farani
in his flight through the al-Hurr gate. A Turkish officer sent 3,000
troops in pursuit of them and the fleeing Arabs were attacked on
another flank by the Turkish cavalry camped outside the city. Arab
casualties ran extremely high.

The crush at the narrowal-Hurr gate and the troops' indiscriminate
firing on the people massed there impelled hundreds of citizens to flee
back into the town to seek shelter in the shrines or in the houses of
Zillu's-Sultan and Rashti, the refuges designated by Najib Pasha. Ra-
shti's home was so full that people spilled into his courtyard, where
some sixty-six persons were crushed by the panicky crowd. By this
time the greater body of tribesmen and gangs had fled the city. Never-
theless, the Turkish division advancing through the centre of the town
suffered heavy sniper fire, the intensity of which indicates that many
tradespeople joined the fray on their own. Many of these were sighted
in their ethnic Iraniandress in the opposition forces. When the power
elite had fled, the little people remained to defend their bazaar, their
holy city. This opposition from the crowd infuriatedthe Turkish sold-
iers.65

Turkish troops chased retreating Arabs to the shrine of 'Abbas,
where snipers fired upon them from a minaret. The berserkOttomans
let loose a fearful volley into the crowd seeking sanctuarythere, which
panicked, causing more deaths by trampling. The Turks took the
offensive, robbing women of jewellery, sometimes chopping off a
limb to get it. Fighting even reached the precincts of the holy tomb,
where the Turks killed several persons they declared were lutis. The
streets adjoining 'Abbas's shrine were filled with cadavers that the
Ottomans set ablaze with naphtha and covered with blankets to help
them burn. Nearly 250 persons probably perished in the incident.
Nearly 200 more civilians were slaughtered at the shrine of Imam
Husayn before Sadullah Pasha entered the city at about 10.30 a.m.
and forbade further butchery.

The troops then fanned out to plunder the city's residences, raping
and killing. Often the troops pressed the owners into service as
bearersto transportthe stolen goods to camp. Mulla YusufAstarabadi

reported that although he suffered a head wound he was made to
carry loot to the camp. He wote:

> street except by walking over the corpses. It was as if I walked about invisibly, so

> 'Abbas . . . I descried all about the illumined sepulchre murdered souls clinging to
> it, beseeching, seeking shelter and refuge within it. I saw most of the dead in the
> lanes and bazaars.66

Only towards sunset did the Ottoman commander, who had
stopped paying for luti ears, begin reining in his plundering minions.
After careful enquiries Farrant estimated the loss of life inside the
city at some 3,000 dead that day, with another 2,000 Arabs killed
outside the walls.67 The number of dead within the city represented
15 per cent of its normal population. The Turks lost 400 men.

THE REPRESSION OF SHIISM
The religious element in the struggle again surfacedwhen the Turkish
troops turned the court of the shrine of 'Abbas into a barrackyard,
where animals were stabled and uncouth soldiers sang loose songs,
horrifying the dispirited Shiites. On 15 Januarythe Seraskerreceived
word that Najib Pasha would shortly visit the conquered city. Shiite
jurisprudents and other notables were put in charge of overseeing the
burialof the often burnt, dog-eaten cadaversin mass graves. On 16 and
17 Januaryfurther plundering occurred as troops searched homes for
arms.

On 18 January Najib Pasha arrived in the city and was greeted by
a party of notables that included Rashti. The viceroy said his prayers
at the shrine of Imam Husayn and paid respect to the holy tombs,
but he soon revealed a new administrative order that ended Shiite
autonomy in the town. Najib Pasha appointed a Sunni governor of
Karbala, and announced that with the concurrence of the Sunni qadi
in Baghdad, an assistant Sunni judge would be appointed in Karbala.
Sunni judges would hear all court cases, even where they involved
two Shiite parties from Karbala. Likewise, the government appointed
a Sunni preacher to deliver sermons after Friday prayers and to

pronounce blessings on the Ottoman emperor.68Thousands of Shiites
fled Iraq for Iran.

The Shiite clergy, alarmed by the disaster and the new, hardline
Ottoman government, began practising dissimulation (taqiyyah) of
their faith and cancelled further performanceof Friday congregational
prayers. Shiites ceased to pray with their arms held straight down,
pretending to be Sunnis from the ritual point of view. Observances
of the month of mourning, Muharram, which began on 1 February,
were extremely subdued and private, and news of the attack disheart-
ened other Shiites in Iraq.69

REACTIONS TO THE DISASTER
Reactions to the calamity within Karbalavaried greatly. By late April
a semblance of normality had returned to the town and Farrant
reported that respectable residents rejoiced that the gangs had been
expelled, complaining that "no place could have exceeded Karbellah
in debauchery of every sort". He noted that many religious officials
considered the calamity a judgement on the place.70 Wealthy survi-
vors of the occupation were happier with strong state control.

The leaders of the revolt from old landed families, such as 'Abdu'l-
Wahhab, fled to sanctuarywith friendly tribes and Najib Pasha subse-
quently pardonedthem. Mirza Salih sufferedimprisonment in Kirkuk
until pardoned. The Arab gangs sought refuge in the Hindiyyah, but
their leader Za'faraniwas apprehended and taken to Baghdad, where
he fell ill with hectic fever (tuberculosis) and died. The major Arab
tribal leaders escaped safely with their men. Najib Pasha's costly mili-
tary adventure made little long-term change in the social structure of
Karbala and the gang organizations, although weakened, continued.
Betteradministrationreturnedprosperityto the city within threeyears,
though Iranian merchants were thenceforth subject to heavy customs
duties in the city and within Turkish territory.71

the ruling classes.72 In a candid letter Astarabadigave full vent to his

grief and outrage, angrily exclaiming, "Would that there were no king
(sultan)ruling over us, and none over Iran!".73Astarabadiclearly bla-
med the Ottoman emperor Abdiilmecid for ordering the attack, and
Muhammad Shah of Iran for failing to come to the aid of the beleagured
Shiites. He went on to say that if there had to be a monarch, he should
at least uphold the Qur'an and defend the Imam 'Ali. Astarabadi's
antipathy towards monarchy and desire for the enthronement of Shiite
values represent a rudimentary republicanism, providing evidence of
strong, if vague, anti-monarchical feelings among some religious
scholars in the shrine cities in the mid-nineteenth century. Solid evi-
dence for such views is otherwise rare.74

The Shaykhi leader Rashti interpretedthe cataclysmas divine retri-
bution for the failure of the inhabitantsto accept his millenarianteach-
ings. The following year, September-October 1843, he refused to
expand on the subject of the coming promised one. He fearedthat were
he to repeat his discourse a similar disaster would befall the town,
as the people were still unprepared to embrace his views about the
Mahdi.75

Iran met the news of the bloody capture of Karbalawith grief and
rage, then with clamour for war. The leading jurisprudentof Isfahan,
Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shafti, attempted to pressure Muhammad
Shah into declaring war on the Ottomans by threatening to lead an
independent army of 20,000 men into Iraq.76 Muhammad Shah
mobilized-his troops, but in the end took no belligerent steps.77

(cont. on p. 140)

Given the widespread millennial speculations about the coming of
the promised Mahdi in 1260/1844, the Sunni enemy's unavenged
sacking of so holy a Shiite shrine surely heightened expectations that
the Hidden Imam would soon appear to succour the Shiites. In May
1844 Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad, a young merchant of Shiraz, who had
associated briefly with the Shaykhis in Karbala, put forwardhis claim
to be the Bab or gate of the Twelfth Imam and caused a considerable
stir in the shrine cities of Iraq.78

A large number of Shaykhis responded favourably to the Bab.

They had been strengthened in their millenarian fervour, as we
noted above, by the teachings of Sayyid Kazim Rashti. The initial
excitement caused by the Bab and the following he gained in both
Iran and Iraqderived, at least in part, from the millennial expectations
caused by the anger and frustration the Karbala episode provoked
among devout Shiites. The Babi movement spread with lightning
swiftness in Iran, especially attracting lower-ranking religious
scholars, urban merchants and the bazaarclasses. The Bab's message,
aside from his own messianic claims, included the abrogation of the
Islamic prohibition of interest on loans and the amelioration of the
condition of women. The opposition the new religion provoked from
the government and the Usuli religious scholars led to its persecution
and in turn sparked clashes and uprisings in several Iraniantowns in
1848-52.79

CONCLUSION
The data gleaned from archivaland manuscript sources and presented
above not only give us a detailed picture of gang organization and
activities in Karbala, they also help clarify the general role of the
urban gangs active in many cities in south Iraq and throughout Iran
during the nineteenth century. Although strongergovernments could
suppress the toughs, when state power waned in the first half of the
nineteenth century the gangs took control of entire towns. Wars with
modernizing European states like the Russian empire enervated the
Ottomans and the Qajars in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth

centuries, and at first they had fewer resources to devote to controlling
their own remoter provinces.

In response, the Ottomans from 1826 sought to increase resources
through the abolition of tax-farming and privileges and through a
rationalized and centralized bureaucracy. The manner in which the
government initially grew weaker, then attempted to impose greater
centralizationthrough new, European-influencedtechniques, helped
provoke regional clashes in Iraq, with urban violence and gang-led
revolts growing common. Outside Karbala the struggle between the
Shumurd and Zuqurt factions in Najaf, representing wealthier and
poorer quarters of the city, racked that town with violence throughout
the nineteenth century.80

In Iran, as well, the Haydari and Ni'mati quarters (originally
named for mystical Sufi brotherhoods) into which many towns were
divided often staged street battles. Gangs dominated Yazd for most
of the 1840s and for a time a gang leader effectively ruled the city.81
Shiraz was, for much of the 1830s and early 1840s, torn by factional
rivalries in which allied groups of notables and gang bosses clashed
with such ferocity that the local governor often lost control.82

From the Euphrates to the Oxus nineteenth-centurygangs emerged
briefly as popular leaders with great power in a town for several
reasons. First, both the Mamluk and Qajar states lacked the ability
to project force quickly and effectively throughout their territories,
owing in part to their small standing armies. These states therefore
had to depend heavily on appointed local governors, themselves often
weak or lacking full central government support. Large pastoral
nomadic populations, relatively large urban concentrations, rugged
terrain and lack of made roads and transportationtechnology, made
the provinces more difficult to control than was the case in contempor-
ary Europe.

Secondly, the local notables, artisans, shopkeepers and labourers
in Iraqi and Iranian towns had little or no allegiance to the central
government, and so they sometimes perceived gang rule as no more
illegitimate than rule by the state. This especially held true for the
Shiite towns in Iraq, and often applied in Iran as well. Where the
government taxed the tradespeople without providing services like

security, it often drove them to an alliance with their local extortion-
ists. In short, nineteenth-century urban gangs had a common interest
with local elites and the local tradespeople in keeping the central
government out. Finally, factional divisions among local elites such
as landed notables and religious scholars, and among city quarters,
often so detracted from urban corporate solidarity as to allow the
gangs to divide and rule.

Under these circumstances, gangs in mid-nineteenth-century Iraq
and Iran used their armed force in the service of revolts by local
notables or by tradespeople against the centrally appointed governor.
They often became popular local leaders, transcending (at least for a
time) their extortionist background.

In Karbala their provision of makeshift and arbitrarysecurity had
the virtue, at least, of allowing more wealth to remain in the city than
the Ottomans would have, while assuring the uninterrupted flow of
pilgrims and merchants. The city's inhabitants paid the price of a
state of rough semi-anarchy. Nevertheless, the evidence indicates that
the little people and many Shiite religious scholars preferred even
gang rule and protection racketsto imperial Ottoman control. (Indeed
the Ottoman attack served only to fuel anti-monarchical feelings
among some Shiite clerics.) Without the active support of the crowd,
Karbalacould not have warded off central government troops for two
decades. The tradespeople, caught between two unpleasant alterna-
tives, chose to be exploited by their local leadership. The prospect
of more centralized, bureaucratic Ottoman rule in the 1830s and
1840s, itself a response to the rise of European industrial and political
might, provoked the little people to defend their local autonomy.

The role of "mafias"in defending a provincial areaagainst a distant
government has long been recognized. But the specifically urban
character of the Karbala lutis does raise questions. The urban gang
leadership of these popular uprisings must strike anyone familiar
with the historiography of early modern Europe as anomalous. The
gangsters in Paris, it has often been observed, saw the French
Revolution as no more than an opportunity for plunder. Hobsbawm
argued that although peasant bandits are "social", in tune with the
needs and aspirations of the oppressed peasantry from which they
spring, urban bandits are asocial.83 The widespread involvement of

Hobsbawm, Bandits, pp. 84-5. Hobsbawm deserves full credit for drawing our
attention to these phenomena, and this criticism is meant to be constructive. For
another critical view of Hobsbawm's approach to rural bandits, see P. O'Malley,

gangs in urban movements of social protest in nineteenth-century
Iraq and Iran challenges this paradigm. Indeed it should provoke
thought as to whether there is really any such thing as an asocial
gang, urban or otherwise. As Anton Blok has pointed out, all banditry
is "social" in so far as it occurs in a social context.84

Bandits emerge from particularclasses and, when successful, their
wealth and means of procuring it give them broader interests and
alliances. Bandits, rural or urban, engage in anti-social behaviour,
exploiting the poor as well as the rich, and will join in social revolts
when they perceive it in their interests to do.

But luti rule, based on a tenuous coalition of anarchicalgangs and
upon a vacuum of more legitimate power, exhibited instability and
proved a transitional phenomenon. It burgeoned when the old tax-
farming Mamluk government declined in the first third of the nine-
teenth century, but before modern, centralized states arose to impose
strict security. Najib Pasha's attackwas a harbingerof things to come;
but they would come very gradually over the succeeding century.
