   Bahá’u’lláh and the Luminous Mind:

Bahá’í Gloss on a Buddhist Puzzle

Roland Faber

1: Non-Duality

The following considerations are an exercise in non-dual
thinking.1 Non-duality is of central importance to Buddhist
thought and experience.2 And if, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirms,
human essence reveals itself in thought (and mind) [PT 2], the
core of which is mystical contemplation [PT 54], then the
awareness of this profound mode of thinking (and
experiencing) is not irrelevant to the spiritual existence of
humanity. Non-duality is, however, often misinterpreted to
exhibit monistic intentions, being the opposite of metaphysical
dualism. If dualism, the simple differentiation between God (or
ultimate Reality) and the world, is (wrongly or rightly)
identified mostly with Abrahamic religions, from their
perspectives (if dualism is adopted) monism stands as an
accusation against Asian religious expressions, such as the
Advaita Vedanta view in Hinduism,3 and against Buddhism in
general.4 This opposition manifests itself as the impasse of an
uncompromising alternative between the affirmation of the
absolute difference between the world and God, on the one
hand, and the inseparable unity of the world with ultimate
Reality, on the other.5 Yet, it is precisely in this antagonistic

54                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

force field that Buddhist thought is already distorted and will
be misrepresented if it is “identified” in this way, which often
happens in the interest of an apologetic defense of seemingly
unavoidable implications of Abrahamic notions regarding a
“personal” God.6 Nevertheless, the current considerations want
to demonstrate that neither of these mutually exclusive views is
necessary or even necessarily true insofar as they are used to
“identify” (or estrange) the religious other. As a matter of fact,
non-dualism, which cannot only be found in Buddhism, but also
in many mystical streams of Eastern and Western religious
traditions (and their philosophical articulation) throughout all
of their phases of existence, does not attach itself to either side
— dualism or monism.7 Instead, by insisting on the non-
difference between phenomenal reality and ultimate Reality, it
begins at, and always reaches beyond, identity and difference,
dualism and monism, transcendence and immanence, alike.8

Yet, there is one problem we must face from the outset when
we try to understand the concept and reality of non-duality in
the way it is actually meant to be operating in diverse religious
systems, theoretically and practically. Since non-duality cannot
be expressed in terms of difference, although it does also not
comply to the terms of identity (of God and the world) either,
the expression of non-dualism necessitates the use of a language
that escapes both fallacies of identification and simple
differentiation, but only for the price of following closer the
semiotic conventions of a language that seems to be monistic,
that is, a language of (seeming) identification.9 Especially since
dualism, that is, the assumption of a simple difference between
God and the world, appears to be the stronger adversary in the
dual rejection of identity and difference (even linguistically),
the language of non-duality needs some greater degree of
sophistication for it to be discerned from monistic language, as
it is rather clear that dualistic language does not capture the
non-differential articulation of ultimate Reality from mundane
reality in any intelligible way conceivable.

Bahá’u’lláh and the Luminous Mind                               55

This can be demonstrated with one of the most important
formulations of non-dualism in Western philosophy, although
its potential Eastern background must not be ignored, and it
can be found in various forms in Eastern thought and religious
contexts, too.10 So is the statement “the All is one” seemingly
monistic, as is the converse phrase “the One is all.” On the
surface, they seem to be conveying not only the unity of the
cosmos of all existence, but, especially in the reverse form, the
divinity of this unity, be it named God or otherwise, and the
One as being identical with everything. This formula was often
(and sometimes falsely) accused of being pantheistic, where
dualists and dualist understanding of the relationship of God
and the world is concerned, or was even by some of its
proponents affirmed in a pantheistic manner. However, even if
such an accusation were true, although it is not, it already lacks
the ability to address an “identity” of mundane reality with God
where the concept of God is not utilized, as in Buddhism.11 In
any case, a closer look will reveal that both versions of this
formula, in fact, exhibit neither a dualistic nor a monistic
intention.

In one of its most iconic Western philosophical renderings,
arising from the Enneads of great Egyptian philosopher
Plotinus (ca. 204-270), the non-dual character of the meaning of
these formulas should be readily evident: “The One is all things
and no one of them; the source of all things is not all things; all
things are its possession....” [Enneads V.2.1].12 This is what the
theosophical Sufi tradition, giving the same pair of formulas a
“fitting” (although paradoxical) language, commonly refers to
the “unity of Being” (wa˙dát al-wujúd).13 As with other
formulations that were based on mystical paradoxical language,
such seeming “identity” of all beings with the One Being (God)
was, in the Christian and Islamic orthodox context, habitually
accused of heretical pantheism or monism. It happened to
Meister Eckhart and al-Hallaj alike when they articulated their
mystical unity with God in a language that seemed inevitably to
imply the monistic identity of their own “being” with that of

56                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

the Godhead (grunt) or of ultimate Reality (al-˙aqq),
respectively.14 In the Islamic context, the instigation of this
formula was ascribed to another seminal non-dual thinker: the
great Andalusian Sufi philosopher Ibn ‘Arabi (1165-2140 CE),
with all the suspicion of heresy that followed his and his
followers’ thought patterns. But, as William Chittick has
demonstrated, neither did Ibn ‘Arabi, in fact, use this
formulation nor has he meant his thought to be simplified in
this monistic, pantheistic way.15 But differentiations often, and
often systematically, do not play a role in antagonistic
exchanges, especially if the feeling of the entitlement to
religious superiority of their respective orthodoxy motivates
them. And so, while even followers of this philosophy might,
over time, not have withstood the transformation of the non-
dual language of their masters into monistic simplifications, the
monistic interpretation of the “unity of Being” became the
basis for the dualistic alternative of an only apparent unity of
the All and the One, proposed as phenomenal (not ultimate) and
epistemological (not ontological) “unity of witnessing” (wa˙dát
ash-shuhúd), devised by the Indian Sufi sheikh and philosopher
Shaykh Ahmad al-Faruqi al-Sirhindi (d. 1624), and which in
typical Abrahamic manner was again closely identified with the
view of the orthodoxy.16 One may sense this antagonism to be
furthered by the misidentification of monistic with non-dual
language, however. It tends to arise from the attempt of non-
dualists to mold the intellectual discourse on conceptually
unfathomable mystical experience, provoking an impasse for
the irreconcilable alternative thought pattern of dualism, which
again is only effective under the already presupposed exclusion
of the non-dual alternative (while it is itself not in need to
further any oppositional energies). What is more, one may in
these antagonisms also see the cultural restraints and prejudices
impacting the mutual view of the religious other. Al-Sirhindi,
being of Indian descent and cultural heritage, might have read
Ibn ‘Arabi in the context of, and in similarity with,
formulations of Advaita Vedanta or Buddhist non-dualisms,
which for a long time, at least effectively from Nagarjuna (ca.

Bahá’u’lláh and the Luminous Mind                               57

150-250 CE) and Sankara (ca. 800 CE) and their interpretation
of certain Buddhist Sutras and the Upanishads, were pregnant
with many formulations that insinuated monistic “identity” (of
ultimate Reality with the world), even while instead (often)
aiming at non-duality — note, for instance, the supposed
“identity” of atman with brahman or of samsara and nirvana.17

That even a clearly orthodox rendering of non-duality in the
context of a “theistic” differentiation of God from the world is
not only possible, but rather a necessity of sophisticated
thinking that wants to do justice to the implications of theism
can be perceived from the great Catholics theologian Karl
Rahner’s (1904-1984) formulation of God’s relation to the
world as neither dualistic nor pantheistic. In Rahner’s subtle
discernment of an orthodox Christian understanding, we
observe that it is not at all close to “a more popular form of
dualism which places God and the non-divine simply as two
things alongside each other.” And while “we say against
pantheism that God and the world are different, this statement
is radically misunderstood if it is interpreted in a dualistic
way.” Instead, he adds that the “difference between God and
the world is of such a nature that God establishes and is the
difference of the world from himself, and for this reason he
establishes the closest unity precisely in the differentiation.”18
Rahner, thereby, actually defines the non-dualism sought here
precisely by articulating it as the mystery of the divine non-
difference from the world. If God is the difference from the
world (that is, is identical with this difference), God is so close
to the world that, while the world is not God, there is no
difference “between” God and the world.

I have, over the course of the last decades, made this non-
difference — as it appears, for instance, in mystical thinkers
such as Meister Eckhart and Nicolas of Cusa in the West — the
center of my philosophical endeavor to understand the mystical
unity articulated in philosophical and religious discourses
across religions.19 In our current context, now, as this deep
non-dualism is beyond any opposition of categories, it does

58                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

also allow for the pursuit of an interesting transreligious
conversation between Abrahamic “theism” and Buddhist “non-
theism” from a Bahá’í perspective — that is, the one limited by
the perspective and training of the author and in no way
claiming any religious authority in its interpretation — namely,
one of which the author thinks that it would be deeply
appreciative of the principle that difference (in thought and
practice) should never become opposition.20 That is, if we
could, on closer investigation, also find a place for non-dualism
and non-difference in Bahá’í thought.21 In what follows, I will
be concerned with one of the most profound expressions of
this non-dualism in the Buddhist universe of thought and
experience: the Luminous Mind. Reading selected Bahá’í
scriptural texts and their conceptual formulations as a non-
dualistic commentary on this Buddhist concept, this resonant,
intertextual interference will also reflect back onto the Bahá’í
texts so as to let their mutual transreligious correspondence in
the articulation of the mystery of ultimate Reality in relation to
our universe become visible.22

2: Why Buddhism?

The conversation with Buddhism is a fascinating and pressing
question for the Bahá’í understanding of the unity of religions.
Given the overwhelming diversity of conceptualizations within
and between the existing manifold of religions, a responsible
Bahá’í understanding of this multiplicity by, at the same time,
positing a fundamental agreement of all religions, becomes
challenging. Bahá’í discourse has suggested diverse sites for
situating such a unity, for instance, in the common source (God
or ultimate Reality), the convertibility of ethical attributes and
activities engaged in the religious transformation of the human
character, or the corresponding mystical core of all religions.23
But Buddhism, it seems, must be viewed as the furthest frontier
in any such endeavor to create or adopt a conceptuality so
profoundly pervading that it could be considered sufficient in
establishing this proposed unity of religions, because the Bahá’í

Bahá’u’lláh and the Luminous Mind                             59

writings appear, on the surface, to be contradicting the
Buddhist worldview, while, at the same time, confessing the
Buddha to be of the same essential Reality inhering in all divine
Manifestations.24 The reasons for the challenge that Buddhism
provides for the Bahá’í understanding of transreligious unity in
this regard, can be found, first and foremost, in the fact that
Buddhism does neither use (or is compatible to) the “theistic”
language that Abrahamic (and partly also Hindu) traditions
employ, nor submit the metaphysical categories in which its
religious tenets are expressed to that of the philosophical
patterns with which all Western religious traditions have been
pervaded.25 Rather than signaling an underlying unity, Buddhist
language and spiritual intentions appear to be fundamentally
different from that of Western and Abrahamic categories and
inclinations: they do not entertain the concept of God, but
rather deny its very meaningfulness; they do not contemplate
revelation, but offer methods of enlightenment; they do not
aim at a divine world, but suggest the exhaustion of all worlds;
they do not express themselves through messages of a Prophet,
but encourage the imitation of the experience of the Awakened
One; they do not claim immortality for the soul, but the
selflessness of pure existence.26

Nor is Buddhism in any substantial way or detailed
differentiation considered in Bahá’í scriptures.27 We miss its
expositions compared, for instance, with Christianity,
especially in the many conversations ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had with
Christian audiences and in culturally Christian lands when he
travelled to Europe and America between 1911 and 1913.28 In
the mind of contemporary Bahá’ís of that time, this must
already have been a challenge, as we know of Western Buddhist
to converse with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá;29 of the presence of Buddhist
teachers in America and Europe at the same time the teachings
of which were, like the Bahá’í message, available to any open-
minded religionist;30 and also of the presence of Buddhists at
the originally interreligious conversations in the wake of the
first World Parliament of Religions (1893) at Sarah Farmer’s

60                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Green Acre gatherings.31 Despite several important attempts to
bridge the missing discussion, we still lack a developed body of
literature (from either side) for an informed transreligious
discourse. In any case, such a discourse would have to raise
fundamental questions of how to proceed conceptually and
methodically in order to gain a deeper understanding of, and to
be enabled to realize, the Bahá’í imperative to contribute to the
reconciliation of religions with their vastly different
worldviews.32

Myron Phelps, one of the Western Buddhist who became a
Bahá’í remembers, when he visited Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to have
said that, compared with Christ and his circumstances, the
Buddha “came to a part of the world where civilization was
much more advanced, ... ripe in philosophical and metaphysical
speculations”33 so that his teachings had to mirror this
sophistication. This is a very apt observation, and one that we
should take seriously in our engagement with Buddhism from a
Bahá’í perspective. In other words, it is not enough to conclude
from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement, at one point, that while the
Buddha has taught the “unity of God” (the doctrine of taw˙íd),
later Buddhism has lost contact to this original teaching
(something ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also says about Christianity) [SAQ 43],
wherefore any conversation between Bahá’í and Buddhist
conceptuality would basically be irrelevant since the original
teachings are now obscured. Instead, we must match the
sophistication of the Buddhist conceptuality in a fair Bahá’í
conversation with historical and contemporary Buddhism(s);
even more so since the sophistication of these Buddhist
literatures (for Buddhists) not only reflect historical documents,
but scriptures that, in concurrence with Bahá’u’lláh, exhort the
power of the Word or Spirit present through them if we do not
denigrate them — and we never should.34

In fact, such a differentiated and non-oppositional approach
will rather remind us of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s hint that, like the
original doctrine of the Buddha, the “unity of God” (taw˙íd) is
meant to overcome “vain imaginings” in addressing the mystical

Bahá’u’lláh and the Luminous Mind                              61

inaccessibility of the unspeakable ultimate Reality [SAQ 82].35 In
the same way, the conceptual sophistication of the Buddha and
Buddhist scriptures as well as the deep reflections of Buddhist
holy figures and teachers throughout the centuries was meant to
eradicate the trappings of the labyrinths of thinking and the
clinging to any oppositional categorizations of reality
(samsara), which the Buddha and the Dharma-tradition as a
whole view as hindrance for the salvific effectiveness arising
from the direct experience of ultimate Reality (dharmakaya).36
We note similar warnings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá not
to get lost in conceptual speculation, but instead, against all
imitation and prejudices, to directly investigate Reality (al-
˙aqq) [PT 3, 41; PUP 26; GWB 125]. In fact, this is a sign, common
to the diverse religious traditions, of the workings of mystical
non-dualism in our mind and heart: Non-dual thought is meant
to overcome thought altogether.37 However, the process that
the Buddha suggests cannot proceed without an appropriately
engaged and sophisticated deconstruction of these categories,
which otherwise, that is, by simple denial, only would lead to
reiterations of imaginative projections onto Reality instead of
helping us to free ourselves from such limitations.38 Such is the
challenge that the Bahá’í discourse faces in the light of
Buddhism, especially if it does want to remain true to its own
universal imperative to connect the threads of all religious
traditions.39 For this endeavor to succeed, it must, hence, also
deconstruct the limitations of Abrahamic religious habits of
thought and Western philosophical categories, as far as they
limit the deeper understanding of their own scriptures: first,
not to subsume Buddhist concepts and methods under
Abrahamic categories and intentions; second, not to simply
apply its own scriptural categories uncritically by assuming that
our limited interpretations, which have historically developed
predominantly in Western contexts, can be supposed to be
universally explicative of their meaning;40 and, third, not to
simply abandon the conceptual maze with which we are
confronted in the serious conversation with any religion, but in
rare degrees of sophistication with Buddhism, by just

62                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

“agreeing” that such a conceptual engagement was not of
ultimate relevance anyway.

Serious attempts of Bahá’í investigations into Buddhism are
not lacking. They are of different kinds and exhibit various
degrees of awareness of the methodological, philosophical, and
linguistic complexities of such a transreligious discourse.
Roughly, I find four approaches to comparison in Bahá’í
literature, generally situated in the methodological approaches
to religious studies, comparative religion, and comparative
theology, at work: contributions in the prophetic proof-text
tradition, demonstrating from Buddhist texts that Bahá’u’lláh is
the expected Buddha Maitreya (Jamshed Fozdar);41 comparisons
of Buddhist and Bahá’í concepts in the interest of finding
textual evidences for similarities and differences (Ian Kluge);42
comparisons with broadly Buddhist or common intellectual and
spiritual schemes as points of reference for Bahá’í resonances
(Moojan Momen);43 and rare commentaries that use Buddhist
conceptual frameworks to inform Bahá’í readings of their own
writings (Juan R. Cole).44

Another kind of access altogether begins with overarching
questions of religious pluralism,45 which is mainly conducted
from within Christianity and often in light of the perceived
otherness of Buddhism.46 In the Bahá’í context, although it has
not been developed beyond a few applications to Buddhism,
this discourse concerns itself mostly with the fundamental
axiom of the relativity of religious truth and its relevance for
questions of relating theism or dualism to monism or non-
theism (Moojan Momen).47 Much more work must be done in
this venue in order for Bahá’í contributions to be taken
seriously in related interreligious discourses that have, until
now, mostly excluded Bahá’í impulses — especially since
institutional dialogue between religions, of which the Bahá’í
Faith has been an active partner over the last twenty years,
cannot substitute spiritual and intellectual dialogue.48

While the relativity of religious truth — as it is a central
Bahá’í axiom49 — is helpful to address these issues of difference
from a Bahá’í perspective, we must not take a shortcut,
assuming that the discovered differences are confined to, or
merely expressive of, only cultural and linguistic questions, that
is, the social side of the teachings of diverse religions, which
Bahá’í scriptures understand to be changing over time.50 Rather,
we will only have taken the Buddhist conversation partner
seriously if we also develop a sensibility for the fact that the
perceived discrepancies of Buddhist language and spiritual
intention from Western (and even many Eastern) religious
traditions and philosophical conceptualizations reach deep into
the respective spiritual identity.51 Only then will we have
addressed the challenge that such a conversation implies for the
proposed claim of transreligious unity52 and will have mounted
a serious attempt to reconciliation in a meaningful and
respectful conversation between them. Otherwise, any such
attempt to address these challenges will always potentially face
resistance from within the Buddhist universe of discourse,
namely, whenever the feeling could arise that such an attempt
tries to establish superiority over Buddhism by controlling the
dialogue or to claim its inclusion in a new universe (such as the
Bahá’í universe) that would be perceived to be equal to the
erasure of Buddhist identity and existence — a move that would
also appear to be counter to Shoghi Effendi’s understanding of
the Bahá’í reconciliation of religions.53

If I am, at least in principle, to name my own approach,
here, it is meant to seek Bahá’í scriptural articulations of non-
duality and to view them as a commentary on Buddhist
concepts in their own context, thereby not only harvesting
insights for a deeper understanding of Bahá’í concepts, but also
yielding an access to the meaning of Bahá’í scriptures and
categories for Buddhist conversation partners. As this
oscillation also reflects back onto the Bahá’í texts, it has the
fortunate side effect to instigate the widening of their
interpretation beyond Western limitations and to seek the

64                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

mutual immanence of both religious traditions from the deeply
mystical articulation of ultimate Reality.54 This mutual
transformation may, then, also become available as an
appropriate procedure of establishing unity in a non-dualistic
way, that is, beyond and counter to the simplifications and
presupposed limitations of the dialectic of monism and
dualism.55

The main Buddhist concept that is brought into this
conversation of mutual resonance, is, as already mentioned,
that of the Luminous Mind. It will allow us to reflect back on
Bahá’u’lláh’s surprising rendering of the very same formulas,
which we find already in Plotinus, in which non-dualism
expressed itself in Western philosophical and religious
discussions on the correlation of ultimate Reality to our world
of becoming over the centuries. It will direct our attention to
the resonance of Bahá’u’lláh’s discussion of the concept of the
Uncompounded Reality, which again will enable us to view it as
a commentary on the Luminous Mind. The choice is not
arbitrary; rather it reflects two of the deep designations of the
Reality of Realities in both Buddhism and Bahá’í Faith.

3: The Luminous Mind

The concept of the Luminous Mind is a central Buddhist
signification of ultimate Reality, Westerners would say: God;
but also of the essence of human existence, Westerners might
say: the soul; and the essence of cosmic reality, Westerners
might say: the infinite worlds of God — all in one. Peter Harvey
in his book The Selfless Mind found that the concept of the
Luminous Mind already appears in early Buddhist sutras of the
Anguttara Nikaya (1.8-10 & 10-11). There, it is called
pabhassara chitta or “brightly shining mind,” exhibiting a (clear)
light metaphoric, and in some of the texts it importunately also
implies that loving-kindness is a central quality of this mind
(chitta).56 One of the central text formulates its meaning with a
(for Western minds) highly paradoxical puzzle:

> Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by
> incoming defilements.
> Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from
> incoming defilements.57

Several important aspects arise from this enigmatic account:
Mind is in and of itself of pure nature. This is indicated with its
luminosity, clarity, or unobstructedness. Yet, mind is also
defiled, that is, in the state of darkness, murkiness,
obstructedness, which means, mind is in some state of illusion
and suffering.58 The commentary on the same sutra understands
this “defilement” to mean that which one of the most basic
Buddhist ascriptions to the origins of sufferings designates as
the culprit: namely, attachment. Attachment, in its own turn,
signifies the most profound processes and activities by which
we are bound to the inescapable repetition of this suffering.59
These are the fundamental hindrances to ever reach
enlightenment and liberation in Buddhist analysis such as
ignorance, hate, delusion and greed.

However, this is (at least for ears trained in Western
categorizations) paradoxical: the Luminous Mind is not
“fatally” bound to the repetition of attachment and its reasons
that suggests the samsaric process; it can be freed from those
defilements, those attachments, those modes of infliction and
perpetuation of suffering, because it is already always free
from defilements. An interesting puzzle emerges: In its purity,
the Luminous Mind is (always and will always be) untouched by
defilements and, hence, resides always in a natural state of
luminosity and loving-kindness, even while it is defiled. This
again is, in fact, the reason that the Luminous Mind can be
freed from those defilements. The question is — how? The
answer lies in what the Buddhist path of liberation is about, the
eightfold path the ingredients of which are differently
emphasized in the diverse Buddhist traditions.60

66                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

In its development throughout the “three turnings of the
wheel” from the early schools to Mahayana and Vajrayana, the
Luminous Mind took on different, yet related functions,
connected by, we could say, the Hermetic understanding of
reality for which macrocosm and microcosm mirror each other.
Hence, the Luminous Mind designates the non-dual “identity”
of the Self, which is anatta, No-Self, the Self without
substantial identity, with its cosmic non-substantial continuity
beyond individual lives, also called bhavanga or mind-stream. It
names the storehouse-consciousness or alaya vijnana, the root
awareness of emptiness and all karmic seeds in the Yogacara. It
expresses the Buddha-nature of all existence, the Buddha-seed
or thatagatagarba. And it indicates the absoluteness of ultimate
Reality, which is inexpressible, and is called dharmakaya or the
Dharma-body of the Buddha.61 In its final appreciation, the
Luminous Mind began to hold the key to the essence of
Buddhist doctrine, experience, and Reality within Tibetan
Buddhism as treasured by Dzogchen or the “Great Perfection”
with which I will be concerned further here.

Dzogchen or Atiyoga is taught and practiced in all four
classical lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, but especially harbored
as the treasure of the Old School or Nyingma. Dzogchen
understands itself as the highest and unsurpassable teaching of
the Buddha. Being beyond all other Buddhist paths, it indicates
the ultimate secret of the Buddhist Dharma.62 In this context,
the Luminous Mind of Dzogchen indicates Reality itself, its
awareness, and the path for attaining both of them, at once.63
Most importantly, however, it is in its core, and can only be
fathomed if we understand it to be, the expression of radical
non-dualism.

Dzogchen, or the path of Great Perfection, concurs with
earlier renderings of radical non-dualism, for instance, of the
Heart Sutra. In this sutra, Avalokitesvara, the great Bodhisattva
(but really the Buddha) of compassion, gains insight into
ultimate Reality as that which in its “essence” is utterly empty
(of self-existence), that is, that which has no “essence” that

could in any form be expresses as this or that, such that even
form (structure, character, organization, energy) and emptiness
(the formlessness itself) are the same.64 Dzogchen builds also on
the radical view of Madhyamika, which became famous (even in
the West) for Nagarjuna’s, the great Buddhist sage’s and
philosopher’s, “equation” for which there is no difference
between samsara and nirvana.65 This radical non-duality is the
essence of what Buddhists call the perfection of wisdom,
prajnaparamita, elaborated in the notion of emptiness or
sunyata.66 And Dzogchen is, in its own understanding, the Great
Perfection of this Wisdom that arises in (but always is already)
the pristine, luminous, empty, all-relational, spontaneous
consciousness (or chitta) beyond any duality, be it of subject or
object, perceiver or perceived, phenomenal or ultimate, relative
or absolute, samsara or nirvana, the temporal or the eternal.
This chitta is not a regular “mind,” which is always bound to
the defiled state in which the dualism between these realities
seems to be real and that even creates them as oppositional
“realities.” The Luminous Mind is the enlightened mind, the
“chitta beyond chitta” — the essence and natural state of the
mind and the essence of existence.67 This Reality is the Buddha.
In Dzogchen, this Reality, which is also our true identity, is
experienced in the unperturbed presence of the “now,” called
rigpa; and in this experience, it releases the awareness of radical
non-duality: that the All is one, and that the One, the Buddha, is
all, as all (the All) exhibits the Buddha-nature.68

A few contemporary textual witnesses will support the
understanding of this non-dualism as non-dualism, that is,
sufficiently clear so as for us not to fall into the trap of
confounding it with a strict monism of simple “identity,”
which, to say it again, would already be a reaction to a mindset
that presupposes dualism as natural state of existence and the
operation of the mind — something that Buddhism strictly
wants to overcome — but as genuine alternative to both
dualism and monism in which the enlightenment experience
consists.69

68                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

In his book on Sufism and Buddhism, Yousef Daoud
describes the Dzogchen view, which he relates to Ibn ‘Arabi’s
understanding of ultimate Reality or God or al-˙aqq, in these
terms:

> Everything that is, is interconnected. What lies behind
> it, hidden by a veil of our cognition and deluded
> consciousness, is Buddha-nature (dharmata) or the
> absolute reality of pure, enlightened Mind: dharmakaya,
> the experience of which is called bodhichitta. It is
> eternally abiding, unchanging, uncreated, and beyond
> our world of becoming.70

Here, the Buddha-nature is the pure, enlightened Mind; and it is
ultimate Reality. Its “character” compares with that of ultimate
Reality or God (al-˙aqq) in Sufism,71 indicating the “essence” of
God as eternal, uncreated, but also as all-relational.

In the Supreme Source Tantra, one of the central scriptures
of Dzogchen, dharmakaya (ultimate Reality as the Dharma-body
of the Buddha) even speaks as “person” in the first person
account of the Buddha Samantabhadra: “I am self-arising
wisdom that has existed from the beginning.... I am the supreme
source of everything, pure and total consciousness.”72 It is here
that the two non-dual formulas appear in their most dense
form: “The ineffable is the ultimate nature of existence: the
ineffable essence is one. One is the supreme source, pure and
total consciousness. The phenomena of creation are duality.”73
The voice of Samantabhadra then explains further that

> As the essence of mind, the fundamental substance, I am
> the source of all phenomena. ‘Supreme,’ refers to self-
> arising wisdom, the supreme maker that gives rise to all
> phenomena of existence. ‘Source’ refers to the ‘creator.’
> … ‘Total’ means that self-arising wisdom, the true
> essence, permeates and pervades the whole animate and
> inanimate universe.74

Here, we find ultimate Reality to be understood as “creator” of
the phenomenal world, but in its “essence” being all-relational,
pervading the All, and without being any of the phenomena. It
is the One of the All, and All-in-One. And it appears in the
“personal” voice, while it is beyond any description.

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, one of the primary living masters
of Dzogchen, comments on the Supreme Source Tantra, saying:

> Self-arising wisdom, the essence of all the Buddhas,
> exists prior to the division of samsara and nirvana and is
> beyond the limits of transmigration and liberation. As it
> ... is intrinsically pure, this original condition is the
> uncreated nature of existence ..., the ultimate nature of
> all phenomena. It cannot be identified with a stable and
> eternal substance ... and is utterly free of all the defects
> of dualistic thought.... It is given the name ineffable
> [because it is] ... beyond the conceptual limits of being
> and non-being.... Self-arising wisdom, primordially
> empty, is in the condition similar to space, and it
> pervades all beings without condition, from glorious
> Samantabhadra down to the tiniest insect on a blade of
> grass. For this reason that total state of dharmakaya, the
> inseparability of the two truths, absolute and relative, is
> called the “primordial Buddha.75

The absolute and the relative are non-different. Ultimate reality
is all-encompassing and all-pervading, immanent and
transcendent. It is beyond any simple differentiation of the
relative world of samsara, as it is all-relational, and the absolute
transcendence of nirvana, as it is all-encompassing. Its “name”
is ineffable. As such, it is the uncreated essence of existence,
while not being “identical” with anything of which it indicates
the pure nature of its being. Reality is Consciousness, but this
consciousness is neither caught in the dualistic opposition of
subject and object nor caught in the illusion of the simple
identity of subject and object. It is beyond the difference of

70                                                Lights of Irfán vol. 18

identity and difference. It is the consciousness that is non-
different from anything.

One of the greatest masters of radical Dzogchen of all times,
the Tibetan Nyingma teacher and (considered as the)
manifestation of the Mahabodhisattva Manjushri, Longchenpa
(1308-1364), in his fourteenth century Treasury of the
Dharmadhatu, begins his first chapter with this poem on the
Luminous Mind:

> Everything arises in the vast matrix of spontaneity
> And Spontaneity is the ground of everything,
> But empty in essence, never crystallizing.
> The ground is nothing although it appears as everything.
> Samsara and Nirvana arise as spontaneity in the trikaya
> matrix ...
> It is the creativity of the luminous mind...
> Being nothing at all, yet appearing as everything
> whatsoever ...
> In its sameness it is the dharmakaya of luminous mind;
> ... empty of self, unchanging, unsublimating,
> ... self-sprung awareness in the now, reality itself ....76

Here, the Luminous Mind is clearly indicative of ultimate
Reality (dharmakaya); the non-difference between relative and
absolute, samsara and nirvana; and, most importantly, it does
not passively hide in its detached “rest,” but moves as pure
“activity” or spontaneity or creativity. To be creative, here, is
not an illusion, and to hold detachment and creativity together
in one non-dual consciousness is the original nature of the mind
— in all of us.

In his Instructions on the Nonduality of Dzogchen, Tulku
Pema Rigtsal elaborates accordingly:

> [W]hen we understand that... affirmation and negation
> of nirvana and samsara... are merely elaborate mental
> concepts, we realize that all discursive concepts are
> empty in themselves and are the sameness of reality
> itself. There is no view and meditation more profound
> than this.77
> Primal awareness, free of dualistic perception, is called
> “luminous mind.”... [T]he essence of the nature of mind
> is uncompounded and immutable. The primal awareness
> that is the true nature of mind is profound clarity...
> eternal life....78
> This gives us deep confidence on the difference between
> Buddha and sentient being. Repeating ... Longchenpa’s
> The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu .... Recognition of
> the nature of mind is Buddha; in the absence of that
> recognition, we remain deluded and sentient beings.79

In this exposition, it is clear that both the conceptualizations
of immanence and transcendence, the Absolute and the
Relative, affirmation and negation, are constructions of the
mind. Nor is nirvana “in itself” the unconstructed Reality, the
assumption of which would indicate another dualistic
“identification” of the “essence” of Reality. Only in the
overcoming of even that construction of the unconstructed do
we gain a glimpse of the non-duality that is intended: that
which is nothing and, hence, is not different from anything;
that which is everything, yet, by being nothing at all, cannot be
identified or named, or differentiated; that which is one, even
the One, as it is the inexpressible unity of the All (and
everything in it), and, yet, is closer to everything than the “self-
identity” of anything with itself.

The puzzle of the Luminous Mind, as presented throughout
these texts, confronts us with at least three complex or
paradoxical questions. First, how can the Luminous Mind be
pure, undefiled, while being defiled? In this paradox is based the
Dzogchen view that the way toward, and the aim of, liberation

72                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

are the same. In fact, given the ancient teachings of the Buddha,
this means that there is no way to bridge samsara in order to
reach nirvana, because we are already there and of its nature.80
Second, how can the Luminous Mind be both the relativity and
absoluteness, or samsara and nirvana, at once? In this paradox
is based the Dzogchen view that there are two modes of the
Luminous Mind: on the one hand, it is the realization of
emptiness (being nothing, or empty of Self) and, on the other
hand, it names the realization of unobstructed creativity (being
everything), which functions are called trekcho and togal,
respectively.81 Third, how can samsara and nirvana, relative and
absolute, emptiness and creative arising, be non-dually one, the
One who is named the Buddha, the Buddha realm
(Dharmadhatu), pure radiant spaciousness, pure emptiness,
Samantabhadra, the primal Buddha, yet, before dualism and
monism? In this paradox is grounded the Dzogchen view that
ultimate Reality is beyond our dualistic interpretation of the
One and the multiplicity of existence, but also their mutual
identification. Instead, the One Beyond is the All-One.82

4: Productive Interference

In relation to the Bahá’í writings, we find a plethora of
resonances with these witnesses of the Luminous Mind. We
could talk about the linguistic serendipity that the Sanskrit
word bha, luminosity, enshrined in its concept as pabhassara
chitta, is also implied in the Arabic root of bahá’. Although
unrelated, they have virtually the same meaning of light,
ultimacy, brightness, and purity, releasing the resonances of the
light-metaphoric of Buddhist and Bahá’í scriptures.83

Additionally, one is immediately reminded of the utilization
of this luminosity in Sufi and Illuminist traditions within Islam
and their counterparts in Indian, Chinese and East Asian
Buddhist schools.84 Note the closeness of the nur
muhammediyyah, the Muhammedan light of Ibn Arabi and
Persian metaphysics of Suhrawardi and Mullá Sadar al-Dín

Shirazi,85 in a sense the counterpart to the Greek and Christian
Logos, the manifest aspect of the invisible and inaccessible
Reality of God,86 to the light imagery expressed, for instance,
by Amitabha, the Buddha of infinite light,87 or, in Dzogchen, by
Samantabhadra, the primordial Buddha, who personifies the
Luminous Mind, and who/which is called by its nature the
“Immutable Light.”88

We could, of course, with equal interest, also immerse
ourselves more into the implications of the concept of chitta,
mind, and its relation to the Bahá’í understanding of the Primal
Mind, or Will, or Manifestation [SAQ 53],89 nurtured by a long
tradition through Jewish, Hellenistic, Christian and Islamic
(religious) philosophy in the interchange of Greek, Persian and
Indian thought patterns. We would find deep resonances with
similar concepts in the Jewish and Hellenistic Wisdom
Literature, Philo of Alexandria, Heraclitus’s and again St.
John’s Logos, but also the Stoic Pneuma, and, Aristotle’s and
Plotinus’s First Intellect. It would be worthwhile to investigate
the astonishing non-duality of some of these concepts of the
manifest Reality of the unknown essence of the Godhead, for
instance, the oneness of its all-encompassing and all-pervading
nature, with the Báb’s, Bahá’u’lláh’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
insistence that both this transcendence and immanence are
indicative the same ultimate Reality.90 We could also think
deeper of the consequences that the intellectual and material
nature of the Spirit in some of these traditions finds a
reflection in the Báb’s characterization of the Primal Will as
“matter” and activity and its non-dual indifference from the
Divine Purpose as the origin of all “forms” of existence.91
Arising from the Shaykhi process philosophy of the pure
activity of the Primal Will,92 we could find astonishing
connections with the Buddhist non-duality of form and
emptiness, eternal rest and infinite spontaneity, samsara and
nirvana. In fact, given the theme of my transreligious
considerations, I will take up this line of thought with the

74                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

maybe most profound aspect of the Luminous Mind, namely its
radical non-duality. Let me elaborate with six related points:

First, the indicator of non-dualism in Buddhist thought, and,
I would claim, also in the Bahá’í writings, is, as already stated,
non-difference. Since it is often simply named Oneness, it is
easy to miss that it is not the same as identity, or simply
difference from (the differentiations of) multiplicity. Instead,
it means that Reality is not composed and, hence, cannot be
explicated in any analysis or construction. Construction is the
sign of attachment from which the Buddhist path wants to
liberate all sentient beings.93 It is the illusion of “reality” and
indicates the incapability of samsara, the cyclical bind of
causality, of birth and death, of becoming and perishing.
Composition and decomposition are the signs of the defiled
mind. Hence, Buddhist analysis of this defilement, its reasons,
and the suffering they cause, whether philosophically in
reflection of the intellectual mind or practically in the
immediate insight gained (in general) by meditation, aims at
demonstrating that any substantial unity, such as the
possessiveness of self-identical Self, can, in fact, be analyzed
into components, which never lead to any self-subsisting base
or un-composed oneness and, hence, exhibits only
impermanence.94

Yet, as the Buddha affirms in a famous and often quoted
statement in Udana 80:18 of the Khuddaka Nikaya in the
Theravada Sutta Pitaka, there is a way out of the samsaric
reality of impermanence. There is salvation from its inherent
suffering, created by attachment. There is a way beyond this
ignorance. The reason is that there is — as in the Bahá’í
writings95 — an Uncompounded Reality, which is without (and
before) construction and change, and that is what nirvana
means.96 Since this Reality is beyond all composition, it is also
beyond any conceptual construction, that is, it is beyond the
inherent duality of thought.97 In this sense, it is non-duality
itself. Therefore, it is inconceivable, imperceptible, and
inaccessible. It is at once Reality itself, but also experienced in

the realization of the emptiness of all composed appearances,
and it communicates the immediate bliss of cessation in perfect
calmness.

Second, as this “uncompounded Reality” excludes dualism
and monism alike, its non-difference can neither be expressed
by substantial oneness nor by duality. Nevertheless, in order
not to fall back into monistic and dualistic patterns, it must,
paradoxically, be expressed as both at once: as inaccessible
oneness and an infinite manifold.98 As Yousef Daoud with
regard to Sufi-Buddhist dialogue confirms: If we seek God or
ultimate Reality, we must do both at one, cease to name
Reality, that is, accept that the Reality of God appears in no
name and, as we must articulate (and realize) this namelessness,
we must do so in the irreducible infinite multiplicity of
different names and attributes.99 Nagarjuna expresses this same
insight as the non-difference of samsara and nirvana.100 It is a
consequence of the uncompounded nature of ultimate Reality
that Reality cannot appear in mere difference from composed
reality, but neither as the identity of it. Since uncompounded
Reality is beyond all conceptuality, it cannot be named, but no
name can be different from it either. This is also the secret of
Plotinus’s scheme of emanation of which Michel Sells has made
this most interesting analysis: While the apophatic One
emanates the Intellect as its (first) manifestation, it is not
different from it, as long as the Intellect “looks into” the
undifferentiated One. Only when the Intellect “looks at” itself
it creates difference, the difference of Self, which — similar to
the Báb’s and Bahá’u’lláh’s renderings of this relationship
between unmanifest and manifest Reality — is still the Self of
ultimate Reality.101 And from this movement of the Intellect,
for Plotinus, creation springs. We find ample evidence for this
logic in the Bahá’í writings: from the adaptation of the Islamic
˙adíth “He who knows himself hath known his Lord”102 by all of
the central figures of the Bábí-Bahá’í religions — which,
following Henry Corbin, has its own history with Ibn ‘Arabi103

76                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

— to statements of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on the non-difference of the
Self from the Manifestations.104

Third, regarding the characterization of the universal
manifest Reality of the Godhead or the Primal Will or Mind,
which the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh identify with the Primal
Manifestation, the same logic prevails in Bahá’u’lláh’s assertion
of the non-dual unity of unmanifest Divinity with its Primal
Manifestation.105 In his Commentary on a Verse of Rumi, for
instance, Bahá’u’lláh designates this indistinction: “the essence
of belief in Divine unity” as it regards “Him Who is the
Manifestation of God and Him Who is the invisible, the
inaccessible, the unknowable Essence as one and the same”

[GWB 84].     This does, of course, not imply any monistic
identity of unmanifest and manifest Reality, of Manifestation
and the Godhead, which is not only clear from countless
apophatic passages in Bahá’u’lláh, even from the same tablet,
but also from the non-dualistic logic itself by which
Uncompounded Reality is indifferent (in itself) to and, hence,
non-different from its manifestations [SWB 58].107 This again
corroborates Plotinus’ and Nagarjuna’s, as well as Dzogchen’s,
understanding of the Luminous Mind.

Fourth, the same logic also underpins Ibn ‘Arabi’s
speculation on the nameless oneness of God as it expresses
itself in infinite attributes. An attribute of God has no
“identity” in itself, but only as it inheres in the essence of God,
the Reality from which all attributes are non-different.108
‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates the same thought, which, thereby,
reveals its non-dualistic intention, when he confirms that in
God’s essence there are no attributes distinct from it [SAQ 37].
Yet, as this divine essence is inaccessible to these attributes,
their unity is always beyond themselves.109 In Buddhist terms,
this affirms their essential emptiness.110 As these attributes, for
Ibn ‘Arabi and Bahá’u’lláh alike, are most perfectly mirrored in
the Primal Manifestation,111 it is their unity, although the Self
of the Primal Manifestation is itself empty of substantiality

[GWB 22],    except being the Self of the essence in which the
attributes are indistinct [PM 54, 176].

As for Longchenpa all phenomenal existence is only a
creative dream of the Luminous Mind (as long as it is not
reiterated in dualistic oppositions of subject and object), so is
for Ibn ‘Arabi all existence only “realized” as it manifests the
attributes of God in actualization.113 As for Longchenpa, so for
Ibn ‘Arabi and Bahá’u’lláh, all is empty of self-existence (as
only the unmanifest God emphatically exists); and it is this
emptiness (sunyata) which is the Self of the Buddha or the
Primal Manifestation.114 And as for Longchenpa as well as for
Mahayana traditions in general the root-expressions of this
Reality of the Luminous Mind, the Buddha, are wisdom of
emptiness and compassion of non-difference,115 in Ibn ‘Arabi
its root-attributes are divine knowledge and mercy.116 However,
while this is also true for the Bahá’í writings [PM 99, TB 118], it
may be interesting to note that in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Commentary
on the Islamic Tradition “I was a Hidden Treasure” the root
attributes of divine manifestation and creation are Love and
Beauty117 — and we may wonder as to the implications of this
shift for a Bahá’í commentary on the Luminous Mind.

Fifth, the logic of non-difference has another consequence:
We must not confound, as already mentioned earlier, language
utilizing the Greco-Islamic heritage by the Bahá’í conceptuality
with its meaning, as if Greek thought defines the meaning of
the Bahá’í writings for us. Not only does Bahá’u’lláh warn us
that revelation is not exhausted by any linguistic mold (or
language as such);118 and as it is always relative to its diverse
audiences,119 it functions much like the “skillful means” (upaya)
of Buddhist scripture by which the Buddha addresses each
sentient being according to its spiritual horizon.120 But the
influx of Shaykhi and Sufi terminology in Bábí-Bahá’í scripture,
as their “genetic language code” is not exclusively bound by
Western patterns of substantialism and often presents
alternatives to it,121 relieves us of the assumption that we are

78                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

bound by dualistic Greek categories, or even that we must
defend them against Buddhist non-duality.

Case in point is the conjecture, held by some Bahá’í scholars,
that Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá use the categories of
“essence” and “attribute” in an Aristotelian substantialist
manner.122 Yet, in light of Ibn ‘Arabi and Longchenpa, this
proves to be not an inescapable conclusion to make. If we care
to be open to a Buddhist reading of these categories, a very
interesting insight will surface: namely, that for both Bahá’í and
Buddhist thought “essence” is inaccessible in principle [SAQ 120-
121]. As Roger Corless has demonstrated: While in Aristotelian
lore, the underlying dualistic substantialism of Aristotle’s
philosophy seems to imply that we can know the unknowable
essence of God, and really the essence of anything, to some
extent through its inherent attributes, the Buddhist non-dualism
asserts that there is no essence that could be differentiated
from its attributes. And this means that no “essence” can be
identified (which presupposes dualism) or, more cautiously: It is
not that there is no essence, but that it is intrinsically
inaccessible.123 In this sense, we must say that the
uncompounded Reality is inaccessible — period.124 In Buddhist
terms, this allows for the mutual emptiness of all dharmas, and
of them with the inaccessible, but indistinct essence, which then
connotes emptiness itself, the Self of emptiness, the Buddha.125

Sixth, the anthropological implications of this don-dualism,
already hinted at earlier, should now become obvious if we take
into account the Bahá’í and Buddhist resonance of the Hermetic
mirroring of the universal Reality or Mind and our mind or self
or soul. I agree with Fozdar’s analysis on this point: that the
Bahá’í concept of the soul, including related concepts such as
the heart (qalb) or the secret (sirr),126 mirrors the Buddhist
concept of the mind or chitta [PM 114]. And it does so precisely
not in its Western, Aristotelian, dualistic sense, as Bahá’ís, at
least in the West, might be inclined to think of the soul’s
reality: namely in dualistic opposition to the body (simple, non-
relational immortality)127 and, more importantly, here, in terms

of a dualistic consciousness that is not able to overcome the
samsaric illusion of the opposition of subject and object,128
although this transformation is essential to mystical
consciousness in any religious tradition129 and is, in fact, an
empirical reality.130 Instead, non-dual consciousness would have
to be understood in the non-dual sense of being beyond
simplistic monism and dualism. Its reality is like the Luminous
Mind (which is its very nature) a chitta non-chitta, beyond all
grasping of images and concepts, formless, beyond imaginings
and self-projections, being the pure awareness of itself as it, as
uncompounded Reality [SWAB 47]. To this testifies not only
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s direct claim that the soul is not composed and,
hence, eternal [PT 29]. It is, moreover, deeply engrained in
Bahá’u’lláh’s understanding of the soul, for instance, in his
Commentary on “He who knows himself knows his Lord,” as
that which (as the rational soul) analyzes everything in its
constructedness, but can itself not be analyzed in such a way,
and, hence, is a secret to itself and as such a sign of God [GWB
#82]. In its purity-uncompoundedness-eternity, it is — as
Bahá’u’lláh [GWB #80] and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [PT 110] state alike —
untouched by any kind of limitations and debilitations, like the
Luminous Mind. As it cannot be known in its essence, it is also
empty of Self, or its Self is beyond itself; and to know oneself
as such is to know God, as both are apophatically indifferent
[GWB #1, 49]. As the soul or human mind is all the divine
attributes [GWB #27], that is, as they are its very reality, its
reality again mirrors, or better, is indifferent from the reality
of the Primal Manifestation. In fact, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in Makatíb-
i Abdu'l-Bahá’, declares that “the Primal Will which is the
Universal Reality ... becomes resolved into the innumerable
forms”131 such that we are like waves of one ocean. This is also
true for the Luminous Mind: the universal dharmakaya is the
“essence” of our very being such that we are already always the
Buddha in nuce, the thatagatagarba, of Buddha-nature. It is the
secret of the Luminous Mind, that we are already this purity,
although in ignorance defiled, as it is the secret of the Bahá’í
understanding of soul-mind-heart that it is already always the

80                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

brightly shining sun even if it seems to be hidden under the
clouds of limitation and infliction [GWB #80].

5: Uncompounded Reality

We can now relate this non-dualism to a tablet of
Bahá’u’lláh that, in my view, represents one of the most
interesting sites for a Bahá’í gloss reflecting the Luminous Mind
as well for the transreligious Bahá’í discourse with Buddhism in
general: the Law˙ Basít al-Óaqíqa or the Tablet on the
Uncompounded Reality.132 It can function as commentary on
the Luminous Mind, because it reflects its “characteristics”:
that all is one and that the One is all; that Reality must be
understood in a non-dualistic way; and that the language used
to indicate its mystery (al-˙aqq) is not fixated on either its
monistic expression, a field of spacious emptiness, or a theistic
one, the Thou of a personal God.133 As with the ultimate
Buddha Samantabhadra, who is the Luminous Mind itself and
its Self, in this tablet of Bahá’u’lláh, al-˙aqq, ultimate Reality,
can be expressed as both while being beyond any such
annotation.134

Bahá’u’lláh’s tablet is itself a commentary.135 It elaborates
ultimate Reality by way of relating it to the seemingly monistic
maxim, affirmed by the theosophical Sufi tradition in the wake
of Ibn ‘Arabi and Mullá Sadra, commonly referred to as wa˙dát
al-wujúd or unity of being and opposed by al-Sirhindi’s wa˙dát
ash-shuhúd or unity of appearance, by taking this opposition
back to its roots in the ancient non-dualistic formula, already
expressed in Plotinus and even much earlier in the Upanishads
as well as in Dzogchen, namely: that the One is all things.
Bahá’u’lláh answers the confusion that issued from this ancient
non-dualism and its erroneous confounding with monism or
pantheism, as it was discussed in the Islamic philosophical
disputes, especially, in the concrete context of Bahá’u’lláh’s
tablet, in and after the great Persian philosopher Mullá Sadra.136
In this way, Bahá’u’lláh’s discussion of the non-dualistic

formula indirectly comments on all the characterizations of the
Luminous Mind that we have discovered so far. First of all, we
must acknowledge, as the maybe most important observation
from which all else will follow, that Bahá’u’lláh’s answer in the
tablet begins with the affirmation of the formula of Plotinus
that “the One is all things,” indicating its relevance for a Bahá’í
understanding of non-dualistic argumentation as well as its
Buddhist connotations.137 Bahá’u’lláh, then, goes on to give
basically four arguments for the truth of this formula while, at
the same time, releasing its non-dualistic understanding and
safeguarding it against both its monistic and dualistic
misconstruction. Here are Bahá’u’lláh’s four arguments:

The first argument: Bahá’u’lláh takes the formula apart by
interpreting their parts for themselves in a non-dualist manner.
He renders “all things” not as meaning “all phenomena,” but as
indicating all the divine attributes: they must be viewed as the
“essence” or “nature” of all phenomenal beings. That is, the
phrase “all things,” here, indicates the pure reality of all
existents.138 Further, Bahá’u’lláh takes “the One” of the formula
to mean the Uncompounded Reality itself in which these
attributes indistinctly inhere while being its emanations.139 Like
the Luminous Mind, the reality of all things is not their
phenomenal existence, but the purity of their essential nature,
which is constituted by the divine attributes as that which is
realized when “all things” realize themselves. As with the puzzle
of the Luminous Mind, in Bahá’u’lláh’s view, while all things
are already pure in their nature (the divine attributes that makes
them real), all else is only illusion, vain imaginings, unreality,
defilement, and attachment [GWB #100 136; HW Arabic #11, #13,
#22]. Their reality again is empty since it has no self-existence
either. What is more — as the more unexpected implication of
non-duality rather than monism: As the reality of the divine
attributes (which are the reality of all things) is itself beyond
themselves, they are, like the Reality of the Luminous Mind,
empty of Self, inhering in the Self of God, which is the Primal
Manifestation. Yet, the manifest Self of God is itself again

82                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

empty of Self, as it finds its “nature” only in and through the
inaccessible, apophatic essence of God.140 And, finally, to close
the non-dual circle: Without any dualistic differentiation (or
even opposition) and without any monistic identification, we
must now also say that the essence of God is again empty of
Self as it has no “essence” that can be differentiated from its
attributes or identified with anything and, hence, cannot be
differentiated from (although it is the difference from) its Self,
the manifest God, which again means that it cannot be
differentiated from “all things” of which its attributes are their
non-dual nature.

The second argument: Bahá’u’lláh affirms the non-dualistic
meaning of this formula already simply by quoting Plotinus,
probably as inherited by the discussion of it in Mullá Sadra. It
means what it coveys: that although the One is all things, it is,
at the same time, none of them. Thereby, Bahá’u’lláh equally
affirms identity and difference; or stated differently:
Bahá’u’lláh affirms that the Reality of all things can neither be
grasped as identical with all things nor as different from them.
It is apophatically, inexplicably beyond both identity and
difference. Yet, as it manifests itself in them, Reality must
always be addressed with both the seeming “identity” of
apophatic oneness and the seeming difference of the
multiplicity of all names and attributes. This insight is virtually
indistinguishable from the meaning of the Luminous Mind,
who/which must also always be expressed as both: the
emptiness of all things, and, as such, as their essence; yet, not as
“being” any of the phenomena, but rather their spontaneous
arising and cessation of its creativity. With Ibn ‘Arabi,
Uncompounded Reality, al-˙aqq, is non-dual “Supreme ...
Consciousness,” disclosing “itself in the three realms of cosmos,
self, and scripture,” as Chittick remarks.141

The third argument: As with the Luminous Mind, Bahá’u’lláh
differentiates between two modes of the non-dual, indistinct
Uncompounded Reality: as taw˙íd-i-wujúd or oneness of being,
only the Uncompounded Reality really exists;142 and as taw˙íd i-

shuhúd or oneness of appearance, the same Uncompounded
Reality is indistinctly present in all beings.143 Overcoming the
traditional opposition between monism and dualism, theism
and non-theism, Bahá’u’lláh here indicates that both modes of
indistinct unity are equally valid in naming the non-conceptual
nature of Uncompounded Reality, as the Beyond that is all-
encompassing and as the Presence that is all-pervading all
existence.144

What is peculiar, however, in Bahá’u’lláh’s discussion of the
fallacies of dualism and monism is that it even heightens the
non-dual character of the classical opposition by reversing the
meaning of both sides against their respective antagonistic, that
is, dualistic, schematization in the tradition.145 This is a subtle,
but nevertheless important point to acknowledge so as to really
be able to recognize the non-dualist intention of Bahá’u’lláh’s
answer to both sides of the divide: While wa˙dát al-wujúd did,
in the classical discourse (but already in its simplification that
does not hold true, for instance, for Ibn ‘Arabi), allow to be
intended to express a monistic unity (the One is all things),
Bahá’u’lláh’s different formulation taw˙ídi-wujúdi, “wherein all
things are negated with a ‘no’ and only Absolute Reality is
affirmed,”146 indicates the absolute transcendence of ultimate
Reality. And while wa˙dát ash-shuhúd, was (in the context of a
monistic reading of the formula “the One is all things”) meant
to uphold the orthodox dualistic transcendence of God
infinitely beyond all creatures, Bahá’u’lláh’s formulation
taw˙ídi-shuhúdi, seemingly identical with the classical one,
conversely indicates the absolute immanence of the indistinct
uncompounded Reality in all creatures “where the signs of the
Primal Divine Unity the manifestation of Eternity, and the
effulgences of the Singleness can be observed in all things.”147

The fourth argument: Bahá’u’lláh now unites both modes of
indistinction, which are only relatively true in themselves, as
indistinctly true in the self-manifestation of Uncompounded
Reality.148 This move captures the essence of Bahá’u’lláh’s new
concept of the Manifestation in the Bahá’í understanding.149 As

84                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

with the Luminous Mind, who/which comprises the Absolute
and the Relative, unity and multiplicity, samsara and nirvana,
emptiness and spontaneity in the luminosity of the dharmakaya,
for Bahá’u’lláh the indistinction between apophatic Reality and
its Manifestation is expressed in the relative uncompounded-
ness of the Primal Manifestation. Although the “locus of the
Divine Unity, even though outwardly it is given a name and
appears to be bound by limitations,” Bahá’u’lláh states, the
Manifestation “is in His inner reality uncompounded (basit),
sanctified from limitations.” Yet, this “uncompounded state
is,” at the same time, “relative and attributive (idafi wa nisbi)
and not,” as Bahá’u’lláh adds, “uncompounded in an absolute
sense (min kull al-jihat).”150 The Manifestation is the non-
difference of its Self from the apophatic Uncompounded
Reality, much as we have found in Plotinus and Longchenpa.
The Manifestation is the ultimate non-dual indistinction.151 This
self-manifestation is Samantabhadra, the Self of immortal light,
and the Bahá’ Alláh, not Mírzá Óusayn ‘Alí Núrí, but the
apophatic luminosity of God’s Self [SAQ #31]. It is the chitta
that “is” beyond itself it: pabhassara chitta152 [SAQ #31].

What is more, this ultimate oscillation of indistinction is an
important instrument in Buddhism to hinder any new
reiteration of any fixed labels by which we would again fall into
the ignorance of defilement, clouding the luminosity of its
detachment.153 As the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh have made clear in
many passages of their writings: Although the Primal
Manifestation can declare itself “God,” it is never identical
with God;154 and although the Manifestation creates, it is not
the creator.155 Or with Plotinus: Only the intellect that
understands itself indistinct from, but not identical with, the
inaccessible essence of Uncompounded Reality, that is, does
neither claim identity with Reality nor difference from it, is the
Manifestation of it.156

And we can take even one more step, which is the ultimate
consequence arising from this movement of indistinction
beyond identity and difference, a step expressed by Nicolas of

Cusa and Nagarjuna alike,157 and ultimately presenting to us the
mystery of the Luminous Mind as Uncompounded Realty in
reciprocal resonance between the deepest intentions of
Buddhism and the Bahá’í writings: that the inexpressible Reality
is itself even beyond any distinction and indistinction,158 even
that of the unmanifest and manifest Reality of itself, which
Bahá’u’lláh indicates in his rendering of the ultimate meaning
of the Bahá’í understanding of the unity of God (taw˙íd) [GWB
#24].

6: Mutual Learning

In this final section, I want to at least touch on a few
implications that such a transreligious dialogue can offer.
Transformation, as has been demonstrated by decades of
experience with, and refection on, interreligious dialogue,159
and as was mentioned in the beginning, must be viewed as a
mutual endeavor.160 This necessity of mutual learning is also
confirmed by Bahá’u’lláh’s deeply relational insight in the
difference of the intentions, situations, and limitations of the
revelation related to any Manifestation161 [GWB #22]. This
mutual “otherness” of revelations is, in its meaning, by no
means exhausted through the “inclusion” of earlier revelations
in later ones in the process of progressive revelation.162 Rather,
while the novelty of a later revelation will overarch the
limitations of the situational aims of an earlier one, the latter
one remains relative to the former one (or “other” one) by the
fact that no revelation exhausts all revelations completely and,
hence, as it adds meaning and purpose, also can generously refer
to the unique meaning and purpose of any other revelation. In
other words, instead of supersession and superiority,163 organic
relatedness may be a better model to understand the unity of
revelatory development, not by depriving any revelation of its
unique impulses while viewing the emergence of new ones such
that all others through its novelty appear in a new light.164

86                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

So, what can Bahá’ís learn from Dzogchen’s non-dualism? Let
me recall one of the initial questions arising from the puzzle of
the Luminous Mind: If chitta is, in its nature, already luminous,
how does Dzogchen understand the process of liberation from
defilements? As our mind is (indistinct from) the Luminous
Mind, there is no way towards it, no path of salvation, no
process of liberation that could reach it. Dzogchen draws the
radical consequence that, as we are already it, we have (almost
in Daoist manner) nothing left to do to achieve it (wu wei),165
not even to meditate — arguably the most essential Buddhist act
“on the way toward” liberation imaginable.166 Hence,
Longchenpa’s radical Dzogchen was opposed to any gradualism,
expressed in so many ways in Buddhist orders of meditation or
states and levels of advancement. Dzogchen, to the contrary,
needs nothing of it. All that is necessary is to realize the
moment of rigpa, nothing more. As Bahá’ís are often advised to
exert all possible effort on the strait path [GWB #125] — holding
the laws, developing their character, their organization, the
order that will come to fruition in the spiritual realization of
the Most Great Peace, and climbing the ladder of mystical
stations — it seems almost paradoxical to find Dzogchen to
undermine all Buddhist “efforts.” This is the reason that
Dzogchen has been deeply hidden in gradualist teachings
throughout Tibetan schools — its adherents, at times, being
persecuted. But it is also the reason that Dzogchen today
increasingly sees itself as independent of its Buddhist context,
actually any religion, becoming universally accessible.167 This is,
I think, something to ponder for a religion like the Bahá’í Faith
that claims the same universality: Can the unity of religions be
reached from different paths?168 And how, given their mutual
claim of universality, would they relate to one another? It is
interesting that Bahá’u’lláh makes similar statements that avoid
gradualism, that is, avoids the implication of superiority and
supersession. In the Seven Valleys Bahá’u’lláh refers to the
wayfarer, who is potentially everyone in every religion, to be
able to, indeed, escape all gradualism and traverse all stations at

once, “in seven breaths, nay rather in a single breath”169 [SVFV

\[65\] 
Conversely, what could Buddhists learn from the Bahá’í
writings? Let me back up for a moment and mention a
surprising connection of Dzogchen with Abrahamic renderings
of God as creator. Buddhism in general, although not
universally, negates the meaningfulness of calling this Reality
God.170 It rests its argumentation precisely on the refutation of
the concept of the creator. Instead, ultimate Reality is not a
creator; rather is the All infinite and without cause, but it is
also ultimately illusionary (samsara).171 Dzogchen, however,
represents an interesting, maybe only apparent, turn to, first,
an affirmation of phenomenal reality as momentous expression
of the creative nature of ultimate Reality. This means that,
although the world might still be viewed in terms of illusion, its
phenomenal reality is, in its essence, indistinct from the
creativity of the Luminous Mind.172 While the Supreme Source
Tantra and Longchenpa name Samantabhadra as creator, they
mean the spontaneity of emptiness.173 But Diidjom Lingpa, a
contemporary of Bahá’u’lláh, confirms in his Vajra Heart
Tantra that the infinite creativity of the Luminous Mind, again
represented by Samantabhadra, actively creates all mental and
physical elements from its primordial modes of wisdom,
although mysteriously through ignorance and defilement.174 This
resonates with the Bahá’í view on creation, which can, in one
perspective, be understood as illusion and mirage [GWB #153;
SAQ #79], but is in its root nature nothing but the creative
emanation of Uncompounded Reality [SAQ #53-54]. Being
without beginning and end, as in Buddhism, in its origin,
however, phenomenal reality arises not by ignorance, but by
effortless love and beauty, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states in his
Commentary on the Islamic Tradition “I was a Hidden
Treasure.”175 And since the Primal Manifestation is the creative
origin of the material universe176 [SAQ #82], it is so by being
indistinct from Uncompounded Reality and by being indistinct

88                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

from this creative process and its motives: love and beauty.
Listen to Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of Manifestation:

> Know thou that, verily, the “Manifestation” is not
> composed of... elements, nay, rather. He is the Mystery
> of Oneness, of... the Eternal Essence and the
> Unknowable Reality... which has never been nor shall
> ever be separate from all else....177

Finally, we can look back and ask whether that which
Bahá’u’lláh claims to be the foundation of religion, namely,
their unity, can be expressed with the mutual immanence of
both Bahá’í and Buddhist non-dualism. Two final Bahá’í
quotations will corroborate this luminous oscillation.
Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys indicate the emptiness of the world
in the indifference of ultimate Reality from it, by saying: “This
is the plane whereon the vestiges of all things are destroyed in
the traveller, and on the horizon of eternity the Divine Face
riseth out of the darkness and the meaning of ‘All on the earth
shall pass away, but the face of thy Lord...’ is made manifest”
[SV 36-37, quoting Qur’an 55:26-27]. And the first of the Arabic
Hidden Words may indicate the Luminous Mind as our
immanent reality: as the pure and undefiled “being” of our own
nature, which we must nevertheless discover and fulfill: “O
SON OF SPIRIT! My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly
and radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient,
imperishable and everlasting.” [HW Ar. #1]
