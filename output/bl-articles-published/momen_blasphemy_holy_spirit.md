> In Chapter 31 of “Some Answered Questions”, 'Abdu'l-Bahá gives a commentary on a verse from the Gospel of St Mathew: "Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come."

People who recognize the station of the Messenger of God and yet still attack Him, cannot, however, be forgiven. It is difficult to be certain, but it is usually considered that this interpretation refers to covenant-breakers. There are however a number of problems with this assumption.

          Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit
Chapter 31 of Some Answered Questions

Moojan Momen

Some Answered Questions is a book of the answers that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave to questions put to Him by Laura Clifford
Barney in the house of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in ‘Akka in the early 1900s.
The Persian and English texts of these replies were published in
1908\. The Persian text was seen, corrected by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in
His own hand and approved by Him with the affixing of His
seal. The English text has a number of problems and is currently
being retranslated.

One of the questions put to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked Him for an
explanation of the verse in the Bible (in the ensuing quotations
from the Bible, the Authorised King James Version is given
first with the Revised Standard Version in parentheses
afterwards):

> Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and
> blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the
> blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven
> unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the
> Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever
> speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
> forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world
> to come. (Matt. 12:31-32: Therefore I tell you, every sin
> and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy
> against the Spirit will not be forgiven. And whoever
> says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven;
> but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be
> forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.)
Since this is a quotation from Christian scripture it is first
necessary to put it into its Christian context and to see what
Christian theologians and commentators on the Bible have said
about it. The verse comes in the context of a story about a man
‘possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb’ (22: a blind and dumb

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                       276

demoniac) who was brought to Jesus and healed. The people
were amazed, saying ‘Is this not the son of David’ (23: ‘Can this
be the Son of David ?’) — in other words: can this be the
Messiah who was to spring from the loins of David? But the
Pharisees, no doubt fearing for their station and their
following, said: ‘This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by
Beelzebub the prince of the devils’ (24: It is only by Be-el’zebul,
the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons) — and
therefore he is not the son of David. Beelzebub was the
ringleader of the apostasy from God and rebellion against him.
But Jesus refuted the Pharisees through logic, saying ‘Every
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
every city or house divided against itself shall not stand’ (25:
Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city
or house divided against itself will stand) so why would Satan
or Beelzebub cast out devils — why would he act against
himself? (26: ‘and if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against
himself; how then will his kingdom stand?’). And if he is to be
accused of casting out demons through Beelzebub, then what
about those from among the Jews who also cast out demons
(and about whom it was said that they did this though the
Spirit of God)? He thus condemns them for making their
judgments not out of justice but out of prejudice. He then
goes on to point out that this is in fact a proof of His mission:

> But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the
> kingdom of God is come unto you. Or else how can one
> enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods,
> except he first bind the strong man and then he will
> spoil his house? He that is not with me is against me;
> and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
> (28-30: But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out
> demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
> Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and
> plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man?
> Then indeed he may plunder his house. He who is not
> with me is against me, and he who does not gather with
> me scatters.)
Then there comes the verses that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was asked to
comment upon and, following these, there are verses that
expand upon this point:

> Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else
> make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the
> tree is known by his fruit. O generation of vipers, how

> can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of the
> abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good
> man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth
> forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil
> treasure bringeth forth evil things. But I say unto you,
> That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give
> account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy
> words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
> shalt be condemned. (33-37: ‘Either make the tree good,
> and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit
> bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. You brood of
> vipers! how can you speak good, when you are evil? For
> out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
> The good man out of his good treasure brings forth
> good, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings
> forth evil. I tell you, on the Day of Judgment men will
> render account for every careless word they utter; for
> by your words you will be justified, and by your words
> you will be condemned.’)
The following is an abbreviated version of the commentary
of Matthew Henry (1662-1714), an English non-conformist
clergyman in his Exposition of the Old and New Testaments
(1708-1710) on this verse. 1 He states that this verse gives the
‘gracious assurance of the pardon of all sin upon gospel terms’,
that ‘the greatness of sin shall be no bar to our acceptance with
God, if we truly repent and believe the gospel.’ The only
exception to this is ‘the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost,
which is here declared to be the only unpardonable sin.’ In
explaining this, he harks back to a few verses earlier: ‘But Jesus
knew their thoughts, (v. 25). It is not all speaking against the
person or essence of the Holy Ghost, or some of his more
private operations, or merely the resisting of his internal
working in the sinner himself, that is here meant; for who then
should be saved?’ Further on he says: ‘this blasphemy is
excepted, not for any defect of mercy in God or merit in
Christ, but because it inevitably leaves the sinner in infidelity
and impenitency.’ He goes on to say that ‘those who
blasphemed Christ when he was here upon earth, and called him
a Winebibber, a Deceiver, a Blasphemer, and the like, they had
some colour of excuse, because of the meanness of his
appearance, and the prejudices of the nation against him; and
the proof of his divine mission was not perfected till after his
ascension; and therefore, upon their repentance, they shall be
pardoned’.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                         278

Matthew Henry then goes on to tie in the ‘blasphemy against
the Holy Ghost’ with the Pentecostal appearance of the Holy
Spirit saying that although during the ministry of Jesus some
may have been confused about His station, all reasonable
doubt was removed with the coming of the Holy Spirit at
Pentecost:

> But if, when the Holy Ghost is given, in his inward
> gifts of revelation, speaking with tongues, and the like,
> such as were the distributions of the Spirit among the
> apostles, if they continue to blaspheme the Spirit
> likewise, as an evil spirit, there is no hope of them that
> they will ever be brought to believe in Christ.
John Wesley gives a much shorter and more direct explanation:

> The blasphemy against the Spirit: How much stir has
> been made about this? How many sermons, yea,
> volumes, have been written concerning it? And yet
> there is nothing plainer in all of the Bible. It is neither
> more nor less than the ascribing those miracles to the
> power of the devil, which Christ wrought by the power
> of the Holy Ghost.
> Whosoever speaketh against the Son of man: In any
> other respects: It shall be forgiven him — Upon his true
> repentance: But whosoever speaketh thus against the
> Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven, neither in this
> world nor in the world to come — This was a proverbial
> expression among the Jews, for a thing that would
> never be done. It here means farther, He shall not
> escape the punishment of it, either in this world, or in
> the world to come. The judgment of God shall overtake
> him, both here and hereafter. 2
The equivalent to Beelzebub (Beelzebul) and Lucifer in the
Apocrypha of the Bible, 3 the personification of rebellion
against God, is, in the Qur’an, Iblis, the angel who is ordered
to bow down before Adam and refuses and is therefore cast
out of heaven and becomes Satan. It is thus pride and
disobedience that cause his fall:

> It is We who created you and gave you shape; then We
> bade the angels bow down to Adam, and they bowed
> down; not so Iblis; he refused to be of those who bow
> down. (God) said: ‘what prevented thee from bowing
> down when I commanded thee?’ He said: ‘I am better

> than he: thou didst create me from fire and him from
> clay.’ (God) said: ‘Get thee down from this: it is not for
> thee to be arrogant here: get out, for thou art of the
> meanest (of creatures).’4
In Shi’i Islam, a parallel with ‘blasphemy against the Holy
Spirit’ can be seen in the concept of those such as Abu Bakr,
‘Umar and Mu’awiya who opposed the Imams as successors to
the Prophet Muhammad and prevented them from gaining their
rightful place. In one of his orations which have been compiled
in the Nahj al-Balaghah, ‘Ali refers to the fact that Abu Bakr
knowingly and deliberately went against the expressed wish of
Muhammad when he took over the leadership of Islam (the
caliphate) instead of giving this to `Ali whom Muhammad had
named: ‘By God the son of Abu Quhafah [Abu Bakr] dressed
himself with it [the caliphate] and he certainly knew that my
position in relation to it was the same as the position of the
axis in relation to the hand-mill. The flood water flows down
from me and the bird cannot fly up to me.’5

Also related to this theme are ‘Ali’s words in another
oration, when he reminds his followers of events at the Battle of
Siffin and of how his enemy Mu’awiyah, at the battle of Siffin,
had used the outward appearance of piety to advance his inner
designs of enmity and his desire to grasp the leadership:

> When they had raised the Qur’an by way of deceit,
> craft, artifice and cheat, did you not say: ‘They are our
> brothers and our comrades in accepting Islam. They
> want us to cease fighting, and ask for protection
> through the Book of Allah, the Glorified. Our opinion
> is to agree with them and to end their troubles.’ Then I
> said to you, ‘In this affair the outward appearance of
> it is faith but the inner reality is enmity. Its beginning
> is pity and the end is repentance. Consequently you
> should stick to your position, and remain steadfast on
> your path. You should press your teeth (to put all your
> might) in jihad and should not pay heed to the shouts
> of the shouter. If he is answered he would mislead, but
> if he is left (unanswered) he will be disgraced.’6
Let us now proceed to consider what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says
about this verse from St Matthew’s Gospel. He states that the
Manifestations of God have two aspects — one is the place of
manifestation (i.e. the physical body of the Manifestation)
which can be compared to the globe of the sun, and the other

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                      280

the ‘resplendency’ of the Manifestation (the divine qualities of
the Manifestations), which are like the heat and light coming
from the sun. It is the latter which is the defining characteristic
of the Manifestation; if it were not present then that
individual would not be the Manifestation. This appearance of
divine qualities in the person of the Manifestation is the
appearance of the Holy Spirit in them. 7

If a person, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, remains remote from the
Manifestation, this can be corrected. The person did not
recognize the appearance of divine attributes in the
Manifestation but may be awakened from this state. If
however, a person hates the divine attributes themselves, in
other words hates the Holy Spirit, then this is a state that has
no remedy and cannot be forgiven; this person cannot be
awakened from this state because they are already fully aware
that the Manifestation is the possessor of divine attributes but
they hate those attributes and thus must remain far from the
Manifestation. The Manifestations dispense the bounties of
God through the Holy Spirit that appear in them, not through
their personality, therefore if a person hates the Holy Spirit,
that person cannot receive the bounties of God, remains
deprived and thus remains beyond the reach of the grace and
forgiveness of God. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá points out that many who
were enemies of the Manifestations of God later recognized
their error and were forgiven; they had been enemies of the
light-holder and remained distant but once they realised that
their enemy was in fact the place of the manifestation of light,
they came close, their enmity was transformed into love and
they were forgiven. However, those whose enmity is towards
the light itself must ever remain remote and for this condition
there is no remedy, no reunion and no forgiveness. 8

This passage speaks of people who are utterly lost and have
put themselves beyond the reach of God’s grace and
forgiveness, and the Bahá’í scriptures also condemn in the
strongest possible terms those who are named covenant-
breakers. Indeed some of the expressions used in this passage
about blasphemy against the Holy Spirit are very similar to
language used regarding covenant-breakers; for example, in this
Bible passage about blasphemy and the commentary upon it, it
is made clear that some are ignorant of the fact that they are
attacking the Holy Spirit and these are not to be considered as
those who ‘blaspheme against the Holy Spirit’. It is only those
who are aware and knowingly do this that are considered

condemned. The same is stated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about
covenant-breakers:

> Thus it is seen that no means for dissension hath been
> left, but carnal desires are the cause of difference as it
> is the case with the violators. These do not doubt the
> validity of the Covenant but selfish motives have
> dragged them to this condition. It is not that they do
> not know what they do — they are perfectly aware and
> still they exhibit opposition.9
Thus it is tempting to equate this passage about ‘Blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit’ with these condemnations of the
covenant-breakers. There exist however a number of points that
show that there may some distinction to be made.

1. In this passage it is stated that those who blaspheme
against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven. The Kitáb-i Aqdas
states however that the greatest covenant-breaker of the time of
Bahá’u’lláh, Mírzá Yahyá, can be forgiven (v. 184). This
difference can be explained however by pointing out that this
verse of the Kitáb-i Aqdas makes forgiveness conditional upon
the repentance of Mírzá Yahyá: ‘Return unto God, humble,
submissive and lowly.’ Thus it could be said that if Mírzá
Yahyá repented and returned to God, he was no longer in a
state of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit and thus no longer
in that state where God’s grace and forgiveness could not reach
him.

2. The passages about covenant-breaking in the Bahá’í
scriptures assign a number of motives to those who have
broken the Covenant: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that they ‘have an evil
intention and are thinking of leadership and of forming a
party’10 or are ‘deprived of the Spirit of God and are lost in
passion and are seeking leadership.’11 The passage regarding
‘blasphemy against the Holy Spirit’ does not ascribe any
motives to those who are in this position but rather posits a
metaphysical state — an evil tree bringing forth evil fruit is the
description given in the following verse (v. 33). It could
however be argued that the verses preceding those mentioning
‘blasphemy against the Holy Spirit’ state that the crowd were
wondering whether Jesus could be the Messiah as a result of the
miracle they had observed and it was in order to counter this
and to preserve their own leadership that the Pharisees made the
accusation that Jesus had worked the miracle through
Beelzebub and not by Divine power. Thus the Gospel passage

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     282

can be stated to ascribe motives of ‘seeking leadership’ to this
phenomenon in the same way as the above statements of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá do.

3. In ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s last Tablet to America in which there is
a long discourse on covenant-breaking and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá quotes
a number of verses from the Gospels as referring to this
phenomenon, this passage is not mentioned.12

4. There are certain individuals who are described in
apocalyptic terms as the ‘Anti-Christ’. Since it is used in the
Bahá’í authoritative texts as a generic term applying even to
individuals in relation to the Bábí and Bahá’í religions, its
meaning must be opposition to Holy Spirit which is equally in
Christ, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. It would thus appear to be
synonymous with those who commit ‘blasphemy against the
Holy Spirit’. However, among those given this designation is
Hájí Mírzá Áqásí, the Prime Minister of Muhammad Shah who
is described as the Anti-Christ of the Bábí dispensation. 13 He is
not however regarded as a covenant-breaker. Similarly the
passage in St Matthew’s Gospel that refers to ‘blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit’ is written in relation certain Pharisees
and their opposition to Jesus and these would not be
considered covenant-breakers in the Bahá’í usage of that word.

Thus it would seem that the two categories of those who
‘blaspheme against the Holy Spirit’ and covenant-breakers may
not be wholly congruous. Certainly it would appear that there
are some who fit in the first category who do not fit into the
second category — but it does seem likely that all who fit into
the second category are included in the first category — that is
to say, all covenant-breakers fit into the category of those who
‘blaspheme against the Holy Spirit’. It is of some interest to
note that in discussions of covenant-breaking, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
refers to Judas Iscariot 14 and to ‘Umar. 15

Definition and Classification of Covenant-breakers

The Universal House of Justice has described covenant-
breaker thus:

> When a person declares his acceptance of Bahá’u’lláh as
> a Manifestation of God he becomes a party to the
> Covenant and accepts the totality of His Revelation. If
> he then turns round and attacks Bahá’u’lláh or the
> Central Institution of the Faith he violates the

> Covenant. If this happens every effort is made to help
> that person to see the illogicality and error of his
> actions, but if he persists he must, in accordance with
> the instructions of Bahá’u’lláh Himself, be shunned as
> a Covenant-breaker. 16
This is not however a comprehensive definition since some
who have been declared covenant-breakers do not fall within
this definition. This point may be further developed by
considering who are and are not in this category. Those who
are not Bahá’ís and oppose the Bahá’í Faith or its head (such as
many Muslim and Christian religious leaders) are not usually
considered Covenant-breakers; those who leave the Bahá’í Faith
because they have lost faith are similarly not considered
Covenant-breakers; and those who commit infractions of
Bahá’í law may loose their administrative rights, but are not
considered Covenant-breakers.

In considering those who are considered covenant-breakers,
it is useful to create a classification of these:

1. Leadership claimants: Those who raised a claim to
leadership of the Bahá’í community against the duly appointed
and authorised head of the Faith. These include Mírzá Yahyá
who is considered to have violated the clear instructions in the
writings of the Báb not to oppose anyone who claimed to be
the next Manifestation of God;17 Mírzá Muhammad ‘Alí who
opposed the authority of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and even plotted to have
‘Abdu’l-Bahá imprisoned or killed;18 and Charles Mason Remey
who claimed the Guardianship of the Bahá’í Faith after the
death of Shoghi Effendi. 19

2. Dissidence: This group consists of those who accept the
legitimacy of the head of the Bahá’í Faith religion, but oppose
his policies and actions. This group consists mostly of
opponents of the Bahá’í administration such as Ruth White,
who was opposed to the concept of the Bahá’í administration
and tried to prove that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament was
a forgery as a way of discrediting it; and Ahmad Sohrab, who
opposed the concept and setting up of the Bahá’í
administration in the United States. He and his associate Julie
Chanler set up the New History Society as a way of spreading
the Bahá’í teachings but refused to allow it to be under the
authority of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United
States or the Local Spiritual Assembly of New York, where it
was based.

3. Disobedience: Those who disobeyed the authorized head of
the Bahá’í Faith in a direct instruction from him have
sometimes been regarded as covenant-breakers and been
expelled. Of course it could be argued that most Bahá’ís have at
one time or another failed to obey one or other of the laws of
the Bahá’í Faith, which are the instructions of the head of the
religion. It has however been disobedience to the
administrative injunctions directed by the head of the Bahá’í
Faith towards particular individuals or groups of people that
have caused people to be expelled. Thus for example, Amínu’lláh
Faríd was expelled when he left Haifa for Europe and North
America against the instructions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who wanted
to protect the Western Bahá’ís from him. Similarly in the years
after World War II, Shoghi Effendi felt that the arrival of large
numbers of Iranian students in the United States was
swamping the American Bahá’í community and damaging its
organic growth.

4. Association: Individuals associating with covenant-
breakers can, if they do not cease doing so after being warned,
be declared covenant-breakers. This may be considered part of
the previous category, in that successive heads of the Bahá’í
Faith have always instructed Bahá’ís to avoid contact with
covenant-breakers and thus association with known covenant-
breakers could be considered an act of disobedience to the head
of the Faith The reasoning given by the head of the Faith in this
instance is however different. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá likens covenant-
breaking to a contagious spiritual disease and states that this
is why association with covenant-breakers is forbidden. In his
last tablet to the Bahá’ís of America he wrote:

> In short, the point is this: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is extremely
> kind, but when the disease is leprosy, what am I to do?
> Just as in bodily diseases we must prevent
> intermingling and infection and put into effect
> sanitary laws — because the infectious physical diseases
> uproot the foundation of humanity; likewise one must
> protect and safeguard the blessed souls from the
> breaths and fatal spiritual diseases; otherwise
> violation, like the plague, will become a contagion and
> all will perish. In the early days, after the Ascension of
> the Blessed Beauty, the centre of violation was alone;
> little by little the infection spread; and this was due to
> companionship and association.20

Similarly Shoghi Effendi, in a letter written on his behalf,
warns that the Bahá’ís of the West do not sufficiently
appreciate the dangers of contact with covenant-breakers:

> … It is a pity that some of the Western friends, with
> remarkable naivete, do not grasp the fact that there is
> absolutely nothing keeping those who have broken the
> Covenant, whether Bahá’u’lláh’s or the Master’s, out of
> the Cause of God except their own inner spiritually
> sick condition. If they were sound, instead of diseased,
> and wanted to enter the service of our Faith, they
> would apply direct to the Guardian, and he would be
> able to adjudge of their sincerity and, if sincere, would
> welcome them into the ranks of the faithful as he did
> with Sydney Sprague. Unfortunately a man who is ill is
> not made well just by asserting there is nothing wrong
> with him! Facts, actual states, are what count.
> Probably no group of people in the world have softer
> tongues, or proclaim more loudly their innocence, then
> those who in their heart of hearts, and by their every
> act, are enemies of the Centre of the Covenant. The
> Master well knew this, and that is why He said we must
> shun their company, but pray for them. If you put a
> leper in a room with healthy people, he cannot catch
> their health; on the contrary they are very likely to catch
> his horrible ailment. 21
Many of the members of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s family were declared
covenant-breakers because of their continued association with
other members of the family who had previously been declared
covenant-breakers, for example three of the daughters of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá: Rúhá, Túbá and Munavvar Khánum, as well as
several of their children.

5. Children of Covenant-Breakers. This category may be
considered a sub-section of the above category, but again,
some different considerations apply, in that, although the same
considerations of contagion apply, the association of children
with their parents is not a voluntary one. Despite this, the
children of covenant-breakers are regarded as covenant-
breakers. The reason is given in a letter written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi:

> The friends are sometimes surprisingly naive and
> superficial in their approach to the subject of
> Covenant-breakers. They do not seem to understand

> that the descendants of Azal, with their mother’s milk,
> drank hatred of Bahá’u’lláh, just as the descendants of
> Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí and his relatives have imbibed
> from babyhood a false concept of the Master. It takes
> practically a miracle to overcome this lifelong habit of
> wrong thought. 22
Thus for example, Parvine Afnan Shahid, the daughter of the
marriage between two grand-children of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
determined by the Universal House of Justice to be a covenant-
breaker in 1996, since by virtue of her continued association
with this lady, another Bahá’í was declared a covenant-
breaker. 23

Classification of Those who Blaspheme against the
Holy Spirit

It is then possible to create a classification of those who
may be regarded as having blasphemed against the Holy Spirit:

> 1. Covenant-Breakers according to the above classification.

2. Apostasy. Although most individuals who leave the Bahá’í
community because of loss of belief are not considered any
differently from those who have never been Bahá’ís, there have
been a small number of persons who left the community and
then began to attack it maliciously and vehemently and who are
referred to in terms identical to those he used of the
Covenant-breakers. Indeed, this goes back to the time of the
Báb, who characterised three of his followers (Mullá Javád
Baraghání, Mullá ‘Abdu’l-‘Alí Hirátí, and Mírzá Ibráhím
Shírází), who out of jealousy towards the station of Mulla
Husayn Bushru’i, left the Bábí community, joined with the
Báb’s enemy, the Shaykhí leader Mírzá Muhammad Karim Khan
Kirmani. According to Nabíl, these three persons were
compared in the Báb’s writing with Sámirí who, according to
Islamic tradition, produced the calf for the Israelites to
worship, and with Jibt and Tághút, two idol worshipped by
Quraysh24 B language very similar to that later used by
Bahá’u’lláh and      ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with regard         to the
Covenant-breakers.25

An apostate from the time of Shoghi Effendi was Mírzá
‘Abdu’l-Husayn Taftí, known as Ávárih (1290/1873-1953), who
wrote a book called Kashfu’l-Hiyal (The Uncovering of

Trickery) in three volumes attacking the Bahá’í Faith and its
central figures in vitriolic and intemperate language. Shoghi
Effendi urged the Bahá’ís of Iran to avoid all contact with
Ávárih26 and, in one of his letters to the Bahá’ís of Iran, Shoghi
Effendi referred to Ávárih as a dead body which the surging
ocean of the Cause of God had cast upon its shores27 , all very
reminiscent of the actions taken and words used against
covenant-breakers by both Shoghi Effendi and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Indeed, in one of his writings, Shoghi Effendi groups together
‘the rejected Ávárih’ with the ‘the jealous covenant-breaker
[Mírzá Muhammad ‘Ali], the thankless Yahyá [Azal], and Karím
the transgressor [Khan Kirmani]’. 28 Shoghi Effendi also
describes Ávárih as Satan (Iblis), which is the same term used by
Bahá’u’lláh (‘Satan, in the garb of man’) about covenant-
breakers. 29

3. Religious Leaders and others who knowingly oppose the
Bahá’í Faith. It is clear from the Kitáb-i-ˆqán that not all
religious leaders who oppose the Bahá’í Faith are in this
category since some are stated to have opposed out of
ignorance:

> Leaders of religion, in every age, have hindered their
> people from attaining the shores of eternal salvation,
> inasmuch as they held the reins of authority in their
> mighty grasp. Some for the lust of leadership, others
> through want of knowledge and understanding, have
> been the cause of the deprivation of the people. By their
> sanction and authority, every Prophet of God hath
> drunk from the chalice of sacrifice, and winged His
> flight unto the heights of glory. 30
Those who recognize the truth of the new religion and still
oppose because of ‘lust of leadership’, are however in this
category. The clearest example of this is Hájí Mírzá Áqásí who
is identified as the Anti-Christ of the Bábí religion. There are
however other clerics who are stigmatized by Bahá’u’lláh with
such labels as Dhi’b (the wolf, Shaykh Muhammad Báqir Najafí
of Isfahan) and Raqshá (the she-serpent, Mír Muhammad
Husayn Imám-Jum’ih of Isfahan), while others are condemned
in his writings, such as Muhammad Karím Khán Kirmání.
Interestingly, Ávárih, who was named in the previous category
is also named Raqshá by Shoghi Effendi. 31

Causes of Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit

We may also try to assess the causes of this phenomenon.

Why would anyone knowingly attack what they know to be
good? The following suggested causes are not intended to be
exclusive. Most individual cases contain elements of more than
one. The following are some preliminary ideas on this:

1. Desire for leadership of the Bahá’í community and a
jealousy of the position of power and leadership of the head of
the religion. Such motives are hinted at repeatedly in the
authoritative Bahá’í texts; thus ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes:

> Thus it is seen that the ocean of the Covenant hath
> surged and surged until it hath thrown out the dead
> bodies — souls that are deprived of the Spirit of God
> and are lost in passion and self and are seeking
> leadership. 32

The importance of this matter is pointed out by the Universal
House of Justice:

> The seriousness of Covenant-breaking is that it strikes
> at the very centre and foundation of the unity of
> mankind. If God were to allow the instrument to be
> divided and impaired, how then would His purpose be
> achieved?33
This applies mainly of course to those in category 1 of the
classification of Covenant-Breaking given above — those who
contended directly for leadership, such Mírzá Muhammad ‘Alí
and Charles Mason Remey.

2. Rebelliousness and pride. Where there is no attempt to
gain the leadership of the Bahá’í Faith, the actions of rebelling
and opposing the head of the Bahá’í Faith appear to derive
mainly from a refusal to submit to the leadership of the head of
the religion out of pride or stubbornness. Thus for example,
Ahmad Sohrab, although to some extent exhibiting a desire for
leadership, was eventually expelled because of his refusal to
submit to the Bahá’í administration that Shoghi Effendi was
putting in place. Shoghi Effendi writes:

> However, since the Master’s Will was read, and the
> administrative order, under the Guardianship, began
> to be developed, he [Ahmad Sohrab] became cognizant
> of the fact that his personal ambition for leadership

> would have to be subordinated to some degree of
> supervision; that he would have to obey the National
> and local assemblies — just like every other Bahá’í, and
> could not be free to teach wholly independent of any
> advice or supervision. This was the beginning of the
> defection which in the end took him outside the pale of
> the Faith: he refused not to be handled always as an
> exception, a privileged exception. In fact, if we keenly
> analyse it, it is almost invariably the soaring ambition
> and deep self-love of people that has led them to leave
> the Faith.34
3. Contempt born of closeness. In many of the members of
the family of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who were expelled, a
certain degree of contempt for the head of the religion can be
seen. Simply put, the family of Bahá’u’lláh (except Bahiyyih
Khánum), were unable to transfer the respect that they had for
Bahá’u’lláh to the new head of the religion, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Similarly, the family of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was unwilling or unable to
transfer the respect they had for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the new head
of the religion Shoghi Effendi. Thus in the case of Shoghi
Effendi, they had known the head of the religion as a boy and
considered that they knew his foibles and weaknesses; they did
not see why they, who were also members of the “Holy Family”
should be ordered around by this youngster. Indeed they
considered it their duty to give Shoghi Effendi the benefit of
their experience and advice. In the case of Mírzá Muhammad
‘Alí’s family, they thought of the leadership of the Bahá’í Faith
as a family affair in which they had a share and they were
annoyed with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for depriving them of what they
considered their rightful claim to both the leadership and of
income.

This can be most clearly seen in the case of the actions of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s family. While ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was alive, none of
them would have ever considered any major life decision
(marriage, a major journey, or the name of a child) without
seeking ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s advice, approval and blessing. They were
unable to transfer this respect to Shoghi Effendi. Even if we
leave aside the fact that Shoghi Effendi was the head of the
Bahá’í faith, as eldest grandson of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he was the
head of the family and the customs of a traditional Middle
Eastern family would demand that the head of the family be
consulted about major life decisions and his blessing obtained.
So when Shoghi Effendi’s sister Ruhangiz married Nayyir
Afnan while Shoghi Effendi was absent and without informing

him, and his other sister and cousin married two brothers of
Nayyir Afnan (again without seeking his approval), and his
brother Husayn Rabbani married a German girl without
consulting him and Ruhi Afnan went off on a trip to America
without his approval all of these omissions showed contempt
for his headship and authority both in the family and in the
Bahá’í Faith; they were deliberate and very open snubs to Shoghi
Effendi which would have been evident to all of the members of
the family and even to the people of Haifa and beyond. When
Munib Shahid married the grand-daughter of an avowed enemy
of the Bahá’í Faith, Al-Husayni, the Mufti of Jerusalem, in a
Muslim ceremony, at a time when Shoghi Effendi was striving
to establish the independence of the Bahá’í Faith from Islam,
this was not only a personal snub to Shoghi Effendi who was
not consulted but also to what he was striving to achieve for
the Bahá’í Faith.

4. Desire to maintain leadership. Those clerics who opposed
the Bahá’í Faith did so out of a fear for their position in
society and their wealth. This includes Hájí Mírzá Áqásí, who
as well as being Prime Minister, was the spiritual guide of
Muhammad Shah. It also applies to the other clerics mentioned.
It also brings us back to the quotation from the Gospel of St
Matthew with which we started this paper, because of course
the people to whom these words of Christ about ‘blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit were directed were the Pharisees, the
Jewish religious leaders who feared for their position and
wealth if the people thought that Jesus really was the Messiah,
son of David.

Conclusions

In summary, a number of conclusions can thus be drawn
about this phenomenon of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit:

1. This phenomenon seen in all religions. In this paper, we
have seen that it is present in both Christianity and the Bahá’í
faith. However, from a Bahá’í perspective, the phenomenon of
covenant-breaking has also occurred in Islam with the
usurpation of ‘Ali’s succession to the prophet Muhammad and
the opposition of the Umayyad dynasty to the Imams. And so
it would appear to be a general phenomenon across all religions

2. Consists of knowing opposition to the truth. The
phenomenon consists of knowingly opposing and attacking the
source of divine guidance.

3. Can be external to the religion. Some of the religious
leaders of the previous religious dispensations who, knowing
the new religion to be the truth nevertheless oppose it, are
considered to be in this category.

4. Can be internal to the religion. This is opposition to the
head of the Bahá’í Faith or founder of the religion or
disobedience of direct instructions of that leader.

5. The motives of those engaged in this activity, insofar as
they can be ascertained are those of jealousy and pride

6. Since making a judgement as to who is to be classed as
having blasphemed against the Holy Spirit involves an
assessment of the inner spiritual state of a person, only
divinely inspired leadership can make such a judgement.
