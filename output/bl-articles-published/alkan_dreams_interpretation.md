Dreams and their Interpretation in the Baha’i Religion
Some preliminary remarks

Dr. Necati Alkan
Jerusalem, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem

Abstract
This paper provides an outline of the importance of dreams and their interpretation
in the Bahá‟í Religion. After some general remarks on dreams, dreams and dream
interpretation in Islam will be discussed, since they provide an archetype for the
Bahá‟í context. Statements on dreams by Bahá‟u‟lláh and „Abdu‟l-Bahá will be
examined. Finally, a dream interpretation by „Abdu‟l-Bahá in Ottoman Turkish that
contains significant Islamic elements, will be commented on and a provisional
translation of it appended.

Introduction

Dreams are a universal phenomenon and dream interpretation is an ancient
and universal practice. There are books and scrolls extant on the subject,
dating back to Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Ancient Greeks and the
Romans. In available sources from Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, in
the Iliad of Homer, also in the Old Testament and in pre-Islamic Arab
peoples, dreams are sources of divination, that is, predictions of future
events. In some indigenous cultures dreams are identical with reality or are
believed to be fulfilled . In Ancient Greece, dreams were used to provide
cures for ailments through divine power. The Greeks called this practice
egkoimesis, and the Romans incubatio. Dream incubation is commonly
associated with the cult of Asklepios but is apparently still an institution in
the Mediterranean. Perhaps the most famous book on dream interpretation is
by the Greek Artemidoros of Ephesos, called Oneirocritica (from Greek
oneiros, “dream”).1

Overall, messengers and prophets of God have received their first
revelations, inspirations, commands or glad-tidings through dreams and
visions,- sometimes through angels or other intermediaries,- such as
Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Muhammad, the Mormon „prophet‟ Joseph Smith
or the Báb and Bahá‟u‟lláh. Also, scientists claimed to have solutions for
intricate problems or inventions, in their dreams.

Dreams and their interpretation in Islam

During the period of classical Islam (9.-14. centuries A.D.) dream
interpretation, among the ancient sciences, was passed on to Islam through

translations of Greek and Roman classics. Dreams (sing. ru’yá) and their
interpretation (ta‘bír) have had a central place among Muslims.2 Countless
books on dream interpretation in the Middle East are offered - and even on-
line interpreters and digital dream encyclopaedias on the internet. 3 Still
popular in the Islamic world is also the practice of istikhára4 („the search for
the good‟) for invoking dreams in order to arrive at a solution of a problem.
It is moreover noteworthy that ta‘bír5 was utilised for political claims and
legitimation of rulers,6 the legitimisation of the four Sunni schools of law
(madháhib al-arba‘a),7 or as a means to evaluate aḥádíth (Islamic
traditions, sg. ḥadíth).8

With respect to dreams and aḥádíth as a source of authority in Islam, it can
be said that so-called „legitimizing-edifying dreams‟ were utilised for
decision-making, the establishment of preferences, and the approval of
ideas. The same type of dreams offered guidelines for right conduct,
thoughts and reactions in definite situations in the daily lives of Muslims.
„Legitimizing-edifying dreams‟ also had an important function in disputes
among the Sunni madháhib through the way the four jurists were presented
in dreams, how these should be understood with regard to the jurists‟
influence and status in the Islamic umma (community), and their value and
trustworthiness as the founders of eponymous schools of law.9
The revelation of the Qur‟an (Q.) itself commenced with a vision or a dream
in which the angel Gabriel appeared to Muhammad (Sura 96), which is also
transmitted in a ḥadíth: „The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to
God‟s Apostle was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his
sleep.‟10

The Qur‟an itself contains some passages about dreams and their
interpretation. The most famous is in the story of Joseph, „the best of stories‟
(aḥsan al-qaṣaṣ, Q. 12:3) in the Súrat Yúsuf (12. Sura). As in Genesis, all
three dream episodes of Joseph are mentioned. The purpose of these is to
show that dreams and their proper interpretation are a sign of God‟s favour.

The most significant episode is when Joseph tells his father about his own
dream of „eleven stars and the sun and the moon were prostrating
themselves before me.‟ In the Old Testament this means that Joseph‟s eleven
brothers and his father and mother will one day bow down before him and
this will infuriate his brothers. In the Qur‟an it is said that his father warns
Joseph not to tell his dream to his jealous brothers because of their
intentions to kill him. His father‟s statement „Thus will thy Lord choose thee
and teach thee the interpretation of events‟ (ta’wíl al-aḥádíth) (Q. 12:6)
alludes to a later episode during Joseph‟s imprisonment in Egypt when he is
asked to interpret the dreams of two men (12:36-42). With these dreams
coming true the Pharaoh realises Joseph‟s ability to interpret dreams and
asks him to interpret two dreams of his own after being displeased with his
advisors, who admitted that they are not knowledgeable about dream
interpretation and labelled the Pharaoh‟s dreams as „confused/jumbled
dreams‟ (aḍgháth aḥlám, Q. 12:44). Joseph expounds the king‟s dreams as
predictions of his land‟s future welfare and thus pleases him. As a result, the
king awards Joseph by making him his personal servant. Both in Genesis
and the Qur‟an Joseph‟s piety and his ability to interpret dreams are a sign
of his nearness to God.11

Another crucial Qur‟anic as well as Biblical episode is that of Abraham‟s
sacrifice of his son, which is Isaac in Genesis and Isma„il in the Qur‟an.
Abraham receives God‟s command to sacrifice his son in a dream (manám).
After telling his son about this, both surrender themselves to God‟s will (fa-
lammá aslamá, Q. 37:102-105). This in itself is utter humility and absolute
trust and at the very heart of the Islamic faith: a „muslim‟ is someone who
entirely submits him/herself to God‟s will (islám). Apart from this, another
aspect is worth noting here. Although there is no indication that Abraham‟s
dream was divine in origin, he and his son readily accepted it as such.12
Nevertheless Qur‟an interpretations emphasise that Abraham saw this dream
three times before being certain that it is from God. After the first night he
wondered whether his dream is divine or satanic. The subsequent night he
had the same dream and knew that it was a divine command. After seeing
the dream for the third time, Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son.
According to Qur‟an commentators Abraham‟s hesitation is not in
agreement with the ḥadíth that dreams (ru’yá) of prophets are equal to
revelation (waḥy). Hence, if a prophetic ru’yá is waḥy, there is no room for
Abraham‟s hesitation. Also, that Abraham asks his son what he thinks about
the sacrifice is in the opinion of some commentators a contradiction.13

Four words stand for dreams, visions and sleep in the Qur‟an: 1. ru’yá
appears six times (12:5, 12:43, 12:100, 17:60, 37:105, 48:27); 2. manám,
occurs four times (8:43, 30:23, 37:102, 39:42); 3. Then there is bushrá,

meaning „good-tidings‟ or „good news,‟ which is used once as „dream‟
(10:64). While these three terms signify good dreams, the word ḥulm that
occurs twice in the Qur‟an, means bad dream and is used in the expression
aḍgháth aḥlám, that is, „confused/jumbled dreams‟ (12:44, 21:5). Six of all
these references deal with the biblical figures Abraham and Joseph; the
other references relate to central Islamic issues like the conquest of Mecca
that was revealed to Muhammad in a dream prior to the event itself (Q
48:27). For the interpretation of these qur‟anic verses the commentators
utilise Islamic sayings in canonical ḥadíth collections. They deal with the
authority of dreams and their use as a means of legitimation. Many
interpretive principles are found in the sayings, referring to the practice of
dream interpretation, and therefore guide dream practices in contemporary
Muslim countries.

Dreams in Islam are usually divided into three categories: 1. True dreams
which come from God and are part of revelation or prophetism; 2. Deceitful
dreams which are the whisperings of Satan or demons; 3. Dreams which are
the result of man‟s nature that are not dangerous but also do not bear a
significant message.14 There are other classifications of dreams. The
theologian al-Razi (d. 1210) suggested the following: 1. There are dreams
with a message and become reality, such as Muhammad‟s dream about his
conquest of Mecca; 2. Dreams whose message is realised in the opposite
way, like Abraham‟s dream: he was asked to sacrifice his son but in reality
he sacrificed a lamb; 3. Dreams that demand for interpretation, such as the
dreams in the Sura of Joseph.15 Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406), the great Muslim
learned, on the other hand, talks about 1. Clear dream visions which are
from God; 2. Allegorical dreams from the angels, which need to be
interpreted; 3. „Confused dreams‟ from Satan, which are futile.16 The
differentiation between „true dreams‟ and „confused dreams‟ is based on the
ḥadíth “ru’yá is from God and ḥulm is from Satan.” As noted above ḥulm
denotes bad dreams also in the Qur‟an. Dreams are also an integral part of
major and minor Islamic ḥadíth collections.

Dreams in the Babi and Baha’i Religions
There are Tablets of „Abdu‟l-Bahá classifying dreams into several
categories. He endorses some of those categories as a kind of inspiration or
foreseeing of what will happen in future. In other Tablets he has given
interpretation to believers' dreams at the request of Bahá‟ís that had such
experiences.

The Bab‟s Revelation commenced with a vision. The Bab dreamt that He
drank Imam Husayn‟s blood. In a passage in which Shoghi Effendi talks
about the first revelations of major prophets we read:

Baha‟u‟llah‟s as well received His first revelation in the Siyáh-Chál through
a vision. In a well-known passage He says: „One night, in a dream (dar
‘ālam-i ru’yā), these exalted words were heard on every side…‟18 He
regards sleep and the fact that we can dream as „phenomenon‟, which is „the
most mysterious of the signs of God amongst men (āyat al-a‘ẓam bayna ’n-
nās), were they to ponder it in their hearts.‟ He adds that events in a dream
during the sleep (tará fí nawmika) that become realised „after a considerable
lapse of time‟ (lit.: ba‘da sana aw sanatayn aw azyad, „after a year or two or
more‟)19 or „after the lapse of many years‟ (lit.: ba‘d az bīst sanih aw azyad,
„after twenty or more years‟).20

Elsewhere, Bahá‟u‟lláh talks about a dream of His own, in which He beheld
the Prophet Muḥammad. This dream serves as a confirmation of the removal
of the Islamic jihád, of „holy war‟ and His mission of peace:

One day I saw in a dream that I associated with His Holiness, the Apostle
(Muḥammad), may the souls of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake.
Words were revealed and utterances were made manifest from that
Dawning-Place of God‟s Book. Thereupon He said: „Previously I had said:
„Paradise is beneath the shades of swords (al-jannatu taḥta ẓiláli ’s-
suyúf).‟21 However, if I were manifest in these days, I would say: „Paradise
is beneath the shade of the tree of friendliness and compassion‟ (al-jannatu

declined and then he got up among the people and said, “O people! Do not wish to face the enemy (in a battle) and
ask God to save you (from calamities) but if you should face the enemy, then be patient and let it be known to you
that Paradise is under the shades of swords.”‟; online at MSA-USC Hadith Database

exalted Word, I declared: „May the souls of all men be a sacrifice unto Thy
loving-kindness, tender mercy and bounty!‟ Subsequently, the Ocean of
utterance spoke that which the Pen was unable to reveal and the ink not
capable to make manifest. When I woke up from my sleep I have found
Myself filled with gladness for a time, in such wise that it was beyond
description.22

„Abdu‟l-Bahá, speaking of the immortality of the spirit/soul, reiterates the
realisation of dreams. He also states that a problem or question, which one
cannot resolve in this „world of wakefulness is solved in the world of
dreams (‘álam-i ru’yá)‟ or „the world of sleep‟ (‘álam-i khwáb). When man
is asleep he does not any distance or dimension as in this material world but
he embraces the East and the West, and travels „in the twinkling of an
eye‟.23 „Abdu‟l-Bahá differentiates between two kinds of visions or dreams,
which He calls „spiritual discoveries‟ (iktisháfát-i ruḥániyyih). The first one
is „the revelations of the Prophets (ru’yá-yi anbiyá’), and the spiritual
discoveries of the elect (iktisháfát-i ruḥániyyih-i aṣfiyá’).‟ According to
„Abdu‟l-Bahá those of the Prophets are not dreams (ru’yá-yi anbiyá’ khwáb
níst) but „spiritual discoveries (iktisháfát-i rúḥáníst) and have reality
(ḥaqíqat)‟ since it occurs in the state of wakefulness and not during a
sleep.24

The second sort of „spiritual discoveries‟ in „Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s categorisation
are „made up of pure imaginations‟ (awhám-i ṣirf), which appear to „simple-
hearted people‟ as having a reality. In this situation the minds of men
discover truths, „and from this thought and discovery signs and results are
produced. This thought has a foundation‟. However, „Abdu‟l-Bahá
compares these to „the waves of the sea of imaginations; they have no fruit,
and no result comes from them. In the same way, man sees in the world of
sleep a vision which becomes exactly realized; at another time, he sees a
dream which has absolutely no result.‟25

What we mean is that this state, which we call the converse and
communications of spirits, is of two kinds: one is simply imaginary
(awhám-i maḥḍ), and the other is like the visions (ru’yáhá) which are
mentioned in the Holy Book, such as the revelations of St. John and Isaiah
and the meeting of Christ with Moses and Elias. These are real, and produce
wonderful effects in the minds and thoughts of men, and cause their hearts
to be attracted.26

At another instance, „Abdu‟l-Baha classifies dreams into three categories: 1.
ru’yá-yi ṣádiqih, “true dreams”: they are as bright as the morning sun and
do not need interpretation (ta‘bír). They come to pass in the same manner as
it was seen but most of the people do not achieve this; it needs a heart rid of
all attachment and there must not exist idle thoughts in the mind; 2. ru’yá-yi
ta‘bírí, “interpretive dreams”: these are idle thoughts from the heart or mind
and need interpretation. Idle thoughts must be separated from spiritual
discoveries. „Abdu‟l-Bahá explains thus: if you add any colour to a white
cloth, it will accept it; but if you add blue to a yellow cloth, it will become
green and the truth is distorted. In order to have the true colour, one needs to
remove the added colour. 3. aḍgháth aḥlám, „confused dreams.‟ If man is
involved in strife and contention during the day and these events appear to
him in his dreams, these cannot be interpreted and are no discovery. Finally,
He adds that in the sight of the Prophets ru’yá is part of waḥy, in which they
see a celestial figure who tells them to say or to do things.27

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Ta‘bír in Ottoman Turkish

As in the case of some other Tablets which „Abdu‟l-Baha wrote in Ottoman
Turkish,28 this Tablet was also in all probability written to an Ottoman
official.29 He addresses the recipient with „his excellency‟ (zât-ı ulyâları). In
the first part of this Tablet „Abdu‟l-Baha provides a short exegesis (tafsír) of
a hadith to the same person.30

The second part is „Abdu‟l-Bahá‟s interpretation of the following „true
dream‟ (rüyâ-yı sâdık): the person saw himself in the holy Ka„ba, the centre
of the Muslim pilgrimage in Mecca. He moreover dreamed of the prophet
Muhammad riding a camel (deve), and Muhammad was casting a sheltering
shadow with his hand (pençe) on a flock of sheep. However, only ten chosen
sheep were particularly protected.

„Abdu‟l-Baha explains what the „Ka„ba,‟ „Muḥammad,‟ „camel,‟ „hand,‟ the
„flock of sheep,‟ and the „ten sheep‟ stand for. He concludes by assuring his
recipient that Muḥammad has blessed him by revealing to him this dream.
What is interesting is that „Abdu‟l-Baha interprets this dream in favour of
the Ottomans by saying that Sultan Abdulhamid II. and the Islamic umma
were victorious over their enemies, the Greeks. In particular, the Muslim
martyrs of the (first) Greco-Ottoman War of 1897,31 who died for the
„religion and state‟ (din ve devlet) receive his special blessings. Here

War: A Diplomatic History‟, M.A. Thesis, Bilkent University, Ankara, 2006

„Abdu‟l-Baha also acknowledges the first three caliphs Abu Bakr, „Umar,
and „Uthman as rightly guided and among the ten companions of
Muhammad whom He had promised paradise.

Provisional Translation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ta‘bír:

As regards the interpretation of thy true dream (rüyâ-yı sâdık): thou hast
seen thyself in the holy Ka„ba. According to interpretation, the Ka„ba is an
impregnable stronghold and divinely safeguarded and protected. For it is a
threshold of protection and safety and a refuge and asylum for all beasts
and birds.

Thou hast also seen His Holiness, the Prophet (Muhammad) in thy dream.
According to the holy tradition „Who hath seen Me in a dream, he indeed
hath beheld the truth‟ (Man ra’ání fa-qad ra’á al-ḥaqq ),32 to see the blessed
perfection, our Lord the Prophet (pbuh)33 in a dream, there is no doubt that
it is a real vision and true dream that hath come to pass (müşâhede-i hakikî
ve rü’yet-i vâkıî). To behold our Lord indicateth attainment of gladness,
bounty and blessings.

Furthermore, our Lord (pbuh) hath been envisioned riding a camel (deve). In
the science of dream interpretation (ilm-i tâbir) the camel standeth for the
enemy. This vision is a sign for the victory over and subjugation of the
extremely rancorous and malicious (lit. „vindictive as a camel‟) enemies and
adversaries by the centre of the caliphate, the exalted Sultan Abdulhamid
Khan (II.) and the late lamented umma (Tr. ümmet) of Muhammad.
And it has been revealed (inkişâf) in the dream that our Lord (pbuh) hath
cast a sheltering shadow with His blessed hand (pençe) upon a flock of
sheep.34 The flock of sheep is the umma and the hand signifieth the „five
People of the Cloak (Hamse-i Âl-i Abâ),‟35 whose grace and blessings hath
been vouchsafed unto the whole umma.

Moreover, thou hast seen that His blessed and sanctified hand hath cast its
shadow only upon ten sheep of the flock. Those ten sheep are the „Ten who
have been brought good news‟ (Aşere-i Mübeşşere)36 who … 37 are the
manifestations of the sublime grace of the People of the Cloak. However
much the mass of the umma is blessed by the grace of the sanctified hand

“peace and salutation be upon Him”.

Or, „hath protected with His blessed hand…‟.

“… the five „People (or Companions) of the Cloak‟ (Ahl al-Kisa‟ or Ashab al-Kisa‟), a name which
derived from the famous occasion when Muhammad took „Ali, Fatima, al-Hasan and al-Husayn under his cloak
and described them as members of his family, an event of immense significance for Shi‟ism”; Ian Richard Netton,
A Popular Dictionary of Islam, Curzon Press: London 1992,, 81, s.v. “Fatima”; Momen, Shi’i, 14.

Netton, 18: “Tradition portrays the Prophet Muhammad promising Paradise to ten of his followers.

The names on the received lists vary but they usually include the Rashidun.”; Netton, s.v. “al-„Ashara al-
Mubashshara”. These are usually the first four Caliphs Abu Bakr, „Umar, „Uthman, „Ali, and „Abdu‟r-Rahman ibn
„Awf, Abu „Ubayda, Talha, Zubayr, Sa„d ibn Abi Waqqas, and Sa„d ibn Zayd; see, Hançerlioğlu, İnanç Sözlüğü,

The text says eğer ziyade („should more‟) but this does not make sense.

like unto that flock of sheep, only the ten who have been brought good news
have fully attained unto the special bountiful gifts and found shelter beneath
the extended shadow of the „five People of the Cloak.‟ In addition, the flock
of sheep, which hath been specially chosen by our Lord (pbuh) for sacrifice,
represents the martyrs of the umma. This is the recent battle. These are the
martyrs of the Greek War (Muhârebe-i Yunan) who readily laid down their
lives for the religion and the state (din ve devlet), may God bless them and
be pleased with them. That these visions were revealed unto thine
excellency, shows the liberal effusions and favours of our Lord (pbuh) unto
thee. Peace be upon thee.„Abbas

Latinised Text of the Tablet:

Gelelim gördüğünüz rüyâ-yı sâdıkın tâbirine: kendinizi Kâbe-i
Mükerreme‟de görmüşsünüz. Tâbirce, Kâbe, hısn-ı hasîn ve savn-ı himâyet-
i İlâhiye‟dir. Zîra, dergâh-ı emn ü emân ve kâffe-i vuhûş ve tuyûra melce ve
penâhtır.

Bir de Hazret-i Risâlet-penâh Efendimizi rüyâda görmüşsünüz. “Beni gören
Hakkı görmüş olur” hadîs-i şerîfînin fehvâsınca, Cemâl-i bâ-kemâl-i
Nübüvvet-penâh, aleyhi‟s-selâti ve‟s-selâm, Efendimiz Hazretlerini görmek,
müşâhede-i hakikî ve rüyet-i vâkıî olduğu şüphesizdir. Efendimizi müşâhede
etmek, husûl-i inşirâh ve husûl-i feyz ü berekete delâlet eder.
Bir de bir deveye Efendimiz, aleyhi‟s-selâti ve‟s-selâmın bindikleri
müşâhede buyrulmuştur. İlm-i tâbirde, deve düşman demektir. Bu rüyâ,
merkez-i hilâfet-i seniyyeleri olan es-Sultân Abdülhamîd Hân efendimiz
hazretlerinin ve ümmet-i merhûme-i Mustafavîlerinin şedîdü‟l-bağzâ deve
kineli olan âdâ ve husemâya gâlib ve kâhir olacaklarına delâlet eder.
Bir de, Efendimiz aleyhi‟s-selâti ve‟s-selâmın bir sürü koyuna mübârek
pençeleriyle sâye saldıkları rüyâda inkişâf olunmuştur. O koyun sürüsü
ümmettir ve ol mübârek pençe Hamse-i Âl-i Abâ‟dır ki bütün ümmete feyz
ü bereketleri şâmil olmuştur.

Bir de, mukaddes ve mübârek pençelerinin sâyesi koyun sürüsünden ancak
on koyuna saldığını görmüşsünüz. O on koyun Aşere-i Mübeşşere‟dir ki
eğer ziyâde feyz-i celîl-i Âl-i Abâ‟ya mazhardırlar. Sâir ümmet o koyun
sürüsü gibi her ne kadar pençe-i mukaddesin berekâtından feyz-mend iseler
de, fakat hasâis-i mevâhibe tamâm ile naîl olan zıll-ı memdûd-i Hamse-i Âl-
i Abâ‟ya sığınmış bulunan Aşere-i Mübeşşere‟dir. Bir de Efendimiz
aleyhisselâmın tarafından kurbanlığa tahsîs olunmuş olan koyun sürüsü
şühedâ-yı ümmettir. Bu yakında gazevât-ı ahîredir. Din ve devlet uğrunda
cân-fedâkârâne bezl-i hayât eden şehîdân-ı Muhârebe-i Yunân‟dır;
aleyhimi‟r-rahmet ve‟r-rıdvân. Ve o müşâhedât zât-ı ulyâlarına inkişâf
olduğu cihetle aleyhi‟s-selât ve‟s-selâm Efendimiz size bir teveccühât-ı
feyz-âyât-ı saâdetleri olduğuna delâlet eder. Ve‟s-selâm. Abbas
