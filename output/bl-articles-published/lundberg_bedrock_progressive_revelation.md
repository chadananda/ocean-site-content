> **Abstract:**  
>   
> This paper is to introduce the doctrinal dimension of religious studies, investigate the term "progressive revelation," analyze whether progressive revelation is a central Bahá'í doctrine, and survey the process of "doctrinalization" in Bahá'í history.  
>   
> According to Ninian Smart, the doctrinal dimension is (together with the experiential, mythic, ethical, ritual, and social) a major dimension of any religion. Thus, it is arguably true that doctrinal studies (usually known as "systematic theology," or "dogmatism") are crucial for understanding and developing a Bahá'í theology. Compared to the other world religions, the Bahá'í Faith has, on the one hand, very meager mythical and ritual dimensions, but on the other hand, it has quite elaborate doctrinal, ethical, and social dimensions.

The Bedrock of Bahá’í Belief: The Doctrine of Progressive Revelation

Zaid Lundberg

he British medieval Christian theologian and churc hm an St. Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) said

T      that “Theology” which utilizes doctrines is “faith seeking rational self-understand in g.”1 Nine cen-

turies later, Alister McGrath sim il arly states that “Doctrine may...be regarded as the intellectual
self-expression of a living tradition....”2 These passages could be interpreted on the one hand that through
colloquia and seminars like this one on Principles of the Bahá’í Belief System or Bahá’í Theology, we, as
Bahá’ís, have the rare and precious opportunity to, ultimately, develop a greater self-understanding and
self-expression of the Bahá’í Faith itself. Yet, on the other hand, it is significant that in 1992 Udo
Schaefer stated that:

> if we compare the development of the doctrines of our Faith, the scholarly systematization and
> presentation of its teac h in gs in terms of philosophy, theology, religious studies, with that of
> Islam, for instance, we must admit that we are still in our infancy...our research has mainly
> been focused on the history of our Faith.... The theological doctrines...which are at the very
> core of a religion, have not been stressed much in [Bahá’í] research...and] very little has been
> written on the metaphysical and theological aspects of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation.3
Jack McLean’s Revisioning the Sacred: New Perspectives on a Bahá’í Theology (1997) may be seen as
a recent and serious attempt, involving several Bahá’í “theologians,” to investigate the theological
dimension of the Bahá’í Faith. Nonetheless, McLean writes in the same work that:

> The systematic “Bahá’í theologian” has yet to emerge...and a number of fundamental Bahá’í
> teachings have suffered from neglect ...there is still no major scholarly work in Bahá’í perspec-
> tive on this most vital theme [the oneness of religion],4 which along with the oneness of
> humanity, is the most distinctive and characteristically Bahá’í teac h in g. Neither is there yet any
> major scholarly work on progressive revelation, one of the grand themes of Bahá’u’lláh’s pre-
> eminent doctrinal work the Kitáb-i-ˆqán.5

Doctrine, Belief, Theology, and Religion

In a Western and a Christian traditional sense, the study of doctrines has been recognized as being
intimately related to theology, or theological systems, and have therefore often labeled “systematic the-
ology” and “dogmatism.”6 However, in a broader perspective, Ninian Smart argues that the doctrinal
dimension is one of six central dimensions of religion.7 Sim il arly, Richard Comstock states that doctrine
is “a category in the comparative study of religion that belongs with ritual, sacrament, mystical experi-
ence,”8 and he further writes that terms like torah in Judaism, kalám in Islam, darshana and dharma in
Hinduism and Buddh is m, and chiao in Confucianism and Taoism, all convey sim il ar mean in gs of “doc-
trine” or “teac h in g.”9 Indeed, the very term doctrine can etymologically be derived from the Latin doc-
trína “teaching” (from docére, “to teach”)10 and it is commonly understood as “something that is taught,”
“a principle,” “the whole body of principles in a branch of knowledge,” and a “system of belief.”11 The
term is therefore often found associated with other religious terms and concepts like belief, catechesis,
creed, confession, dogma, and kerygma.12

In a general perspective on the nature of doctrine, Smart defines doctrines as “an attempt to give sys-
tem, clarity and intellectual power to what is revealed through the mythological and symbolical language
of religious faith and ritual.”13 Although Smart defines doctrines “as an attempt to give system,” in his
later writings he points out that doctrines “are not rigidly systematic,” but that they “are more like

schemes than systems.” Moreover, he maintains that a “scheme is organic,” and he seems to imply a
hermeneutic principle when he further argues that “to understand a scheme, it is important to see each
part in the context of the whole.”14

> Smart also enumerates five functions of doctrine, which are to:
> •   bring order to what is given by revelation
> •   safeguard the reference myths have to that which lies Beyond
> •   relate their claims to the current knowledge of the age
> •   reflect and stimulate a fresh vision of the world
> •   define the community15
> These five points can finally be compared with R. M. Speight’s eight functions of creeds as:
> •   the basis of membership
> •   a test of orthodoxy
> •   a type of prayer
> •   a basis for religious instruction
> •   a corporate or ind iv idual response in faith to divine revelation
> •   an expression of self-understanding by the religious community
> •   an assertion and confirmation of the unity of the community
> •   a witness to the world, expressing the core of belief16
It is here noteworthy that Smart’s fifth and Speight’s sixth points include self-definition and self-
understanding as functions of doctrines/creeds in that they “define the community” and that they are
“an expression of self-understanding by the religious community.” Sim il arly, McGrath states that
“Doctrine defines communities of discourse, possessing a representative character, attempting to
describe or prescribe the beliefs of a community.”17 Speight’s last point, “expressing the core of belief,”
is particularly illum in ating since this paper argues that the Bahá’í doctrine of progressive revelation is
“the bedrock of Bahá’í belief.”

In sum, the purpose of this paper is to show that the Bahá’í idea or concept of progressive revelation
is explicitly18 described as a “doctrine,” “something that is taught,” “a scheme,” “a principle” and that it
even is labeled as a “philosophy,” that it expresses “the core of belief,” and, ultimately, that it not only
defines the Bahá’í community but the Bahá’í Faith itself.

THE DOCTRINE OF PROGRESSIVE REVELATION:
The Term Progressive Revelation in the Writings of the Central Figures

In order to determine if the concept of progressive revelation explicitly19 is a Bahá’í doctrine, it is
first necessary to investigate the English tec hn i cal term progressive revelation as it occurs in the Bahá’í
writings.

Bahá’u’lláh
The technical term progressive revelation occurs in the English translations of the extant writings of
Bahá’u’lláh only once and in the followi ng passage of Glean in gs from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh:

> Contemplate with thine inward eye the chain of successive Revelations that hath linked the
> Manifestations of Adam with that of the Báb. I testify before God that each one of these
> Manifestations hath been sent down through the operation of the Divine Will and Purpose,
> that each hath been the bearer of a specific Message, that each hath been entrusted with a
> d iv inely revealed Book and been commissioned to unravel the mysteries of a mighty Tablet.
> The measure of the Revelation with which every one of them hath been def in i tely fore-
> ordained ...And when this process of progressive Revelation culm in ated...He chose to hide His
> own Self behind a thousand veils, lest profane and mortal eyes discover His glory.20
The original passage is in Arabic and was translated by Shoghi Effendi. However, it is important to
note that an equivalent to the technical term progressive revelation never occurs in the original Arabic

\[54\] Lights of ‘Irfán

text. However, it is significant that the term occurs in the internal context of the above passage and
especially in connection with such key terms as the “chain of successive Revelations,”21 and the
“Manifestations” (i.e., the Manifestations of God).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Similarly, the technical term progressive revelation never occurs in any of the extant English transla-
tions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s oral or literary works, but a couple of close equivalents can easily be found. The
following passages may serve to exemplify this:

> Religion is the outer expression of the divine reality. Therefore, it must be liv in g, vital iz ed, mov-
> ing and progressive. If it be without motion and non-progressive, it is without the divine life; it is
> dead. The divine institutes are continuously active and evolutionary; therefore, the revelation of
> them must be progressive and continuous.22
> Among the bounties of God is revelation. Hence revelation is progressive and continuous. It never
> ceases. It is necessary that the reality of Divinity with all its perfections and attributes should
> become resplendent in the human world. The reality of Divinity is like an endless ocean. Revelation
> may be likened to the rain.23

In the first passage religion itself is seen as progressive. Further, it is significant that in both passages
the term progressive is directly coupled with the term continuous.
Shoghi Effendi

Of the three central Bahá’í figures,24 Shoghi Effendi is the only one who ever applies the technical
term progressive revelation, although, as shall be seen below, he apparently did not coin this term. In a
letter, written in 1935, Shoghi Effendi states that he made a “tentative and incomplete list of the subjects
referred to in these translations.” 25 Among the fifty-four subjects enumerated, Shoghi Effendi mentions
the “Unity of Prophets” as the first subject. However, what is significant in this context is that, as sub-
ject forty-three, he briefly states that “Divine Revelation is progressive.” Generally, and similar to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement above, Shoghi Effendi repeatedly writes that “Divine Revelation is a continuous
and progressive process.”26 Further, writing on the topic of religions, Shoghi Effendi states that “One
cannot call one World Faith superior to another, as they all come from God; they are progressive, each
suited to certain needs of the time.”27 Elsewhere he also refers to “a series of progressive dispensations
associated with Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad and other Prophets.”28

More specifically, Shoghi Effendi explicitly, directly, and frequently employs the technical term pro-
gressive revelation. For example, writing about the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh in both his God Passes By
and The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, he refers to the Bábí and Bahá’í “Dispensation” as encompassing
fifty years of “continuous and progressive Revelation.”29 Once again it can be noted that the term pro-
gressive is coupled with the term continuous. Other expressions in the singular are:

> • the concept of progressive religion30
> • the principle of progressive revelation31
> • the Bahá’í philosophy of progressive revelation32
> Shoghi Effendi also uses plural terms of progressive revelations like:
> • series of progressive Revelations33
> • a series of successive, of pre l im in ary and progressive revelations34
> • one link in the chain of continually progressive Revelations35
• a further stage in a chain of progressive Revelations36

Consequently, with regard to the three central Bahá’í figures and the technical term progressive reve-
lation, it should now be clear that this term occurs only once (as translated by Shoghi Effendi) and
implicitly in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh; it is implicitly, indirectly, and rarely stated in the writings of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá;37 but it is explicitly, directly, and frequently employed by Shoghi Effendi.38

The Term Progressive Revelation in the Writings of Other Authors

However, Shoghi Effendi is apparently not the first Bahá’í author who uses this term, but it is highly
interesting and significant that its first usage in a Bahá’í context is made by Shoghi Effendi’s close
British friend, J. E. Esslemont (1874–1925), who also was his English language secretary.39 Thus, the per-
haps earliest dating of the English term progressive revelation in Bahá’í [usage] occurs as the subtitle of
the eighth chapter on “Religious Unity” in Esslemont’s Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, published in 1923.40
It is also important to note that in 1919, Esslemont sent chapters of his book for approval to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá who, before he died in 1921, revised the first nine chapters.41 Although Esslemont never elaborates
on the term, he does refer to passages by Bahá’u’lláh42 and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.43 Esslemont, however, may not
be the first Bahá’í author to use the term progressive revelation, since William Collins writes that “From
somewhere around 1900, American Bahá’ís had access to the biblical interpretations found in Bahá’í
scriptures, upon which a sound concept of progressive revelation could be based.”44 In addition, Samuel
Wilson states that early English speaking Bahá’í writers (e.g., Kheiralla, Remey, Dealy, and Brittingham)45
“refer[red] to Miller, Cumm in gs, Seiss, Guinness, and others.”46 This is a crucial statement, since the
Guinness Wilson is referring to is most likely Henry Grattan-Guinness, who employed the technical term
progressive revelation already in 1878.47

Another person who frequently used the term progressive revelation was the former Anglican priest
George Townshend48 (1876–1957), who also was a close friend to Shoghi Effendi. In this context it is espe-
cially noteworthy since Shoghi Effendi greatly admired his command of English and therefore sent him
his translations and manuscripts.49

In 1954 the term progressive revelation makes a clear and def in i te appearance since John Ferraby used
the term as the very title of a pamphlet. More recently, progressive revelation has, in English Bahá’í lit-
erature, variously been referred to as the:

> •   idea of progressive revelation50
> •   principle of progressive revelation51
> •   process of progressive revelation52
> •   theme of progressive revelation53
> •   Bahá’í thesis of Progressive Revelation54
> •   Bahá’í notion of progressive revelation55
> •   concept of progressive revelation56

•   basic Bahá’í teaching of progressive revelation57

Progressive Revelation as an Explicit Doctrine
The Doctrine of Progressive Revelation in the Writings of the Central Figures
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

It should be clearly stated that from the extant English sources of the writings of Báhá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá neither author explicitly declared progressive revelation as a doctrine. However, quite a few
Bahá’í scholars state that Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-ˆqán not only “enunciates the essential doctrinal princi-
ples of the Bahá’í revelation,”58 but that it also has been referred to as “Bahá’u’lláh’s foremost doctrinal
work.”59 Other Bahá’í authors have argued that Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-ˆqán is the pr im ary Bahá’í textbook
on progressive revelation. Thus, for example, Adib Taherzadeh states that the Kitáb-i-ˆqán has “unfolded
the pattern and disclosed the meaning of progressive revelation,” 60 and sim il arly, William Hatcher states
that it is “Bahá’u’lláh’s most important doctrinal work”61 and that it “discusses progressive revelation.”62
In addition, Seena Fazel & Khazeh Fananapazir state that Bahá’u’lláh’s Súriy-i-Sabr is “a tablet devoted to
the exposition of the theme of progressive revelation.”63

> In the case of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, it is significant that he states:
> In every Dispensation the light of Divine Guidance has been focused upon one central theme.... In
> this wondrous Revelation, this glorious century, the foundation of the Faith of God and the distin-
> guishing feature of His Law is the consciousness of the Oneness of Mankind.64

\[56\] Lights of ‘Irfán

From this passage it would be possible to conclude that “the Oneness of Mankind” could be consid-
ered the “central theme” of Bahá’í [doctrine]. However, during his travels to Europe and America,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá also formulated what has been referred to as “a core set of Bahá’í ‘principles’”65 and which
“could assume creedal formulation as a simple summary of the Bahá’í Faith.”66 Foremost among these
principles is the principle which states that “it is incumbent upon all mankind to investigate the truth.”
It is significant that included in this first principle ‘Abdu’l-Bahá alludes to a central theme, or aspect,
of progressive revelation - that of an essential religious unity—since he states that “The different reli-
gions have one truth underlying them, their reality is one.... All the divine Prophets and Messengers were
the instruments and channels of this same eternal, essential truth.”67

> Shoghi Effendi
> Earlier it was seen that only Shoghi Effendi utilize the technical term progressive revelation. Shoghi
Effendi also refers to Bahá’í doctrines in general statements like “The principles” and “fundamentals of
the Faith,”68 “basic and sacred principles,”69 “verities of the Faith,”70 “the essential verities of the Faith,”71
“truths which lie at the basis of our Faith,”72 “the major beliefs of our Faith,”73 and “the principles and
precepts constituting the bedrock of [the] Faith,”74 and “the incontrovertible principles that constitute
the bedrock of Bahá’í belief.”75 More specifically, he positively identifies “the oneness of the entire
human race” as “the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the [Bahá’í] Faith.”76 Once again, the
oneness of mankind may seem as the fundamental Bahá’í doctrine. The following paragraphs by Shoghi
Effendi, however, can be used to directly ascertain that progressive revelation also is explicitly stated as
a central Bahá’í doctrine, here referred as a principle:

> The fundamental principle enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh...is that religious truth is not absolute but
> relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process.77
> Its [the Bahá’í Faith’s] teac h in gs revolve around the fundamental principle that religious truth
> is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is progressive, not final.78
> the fundamental principle which constitutes the Bedrock of Bahá’í belief, the principle that
> religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is orderly, continuous and
> progressive and not spasmodic or final.79
> The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh should indeed be regarded...as the culm in ation of a cycle, the final
> stage in a series of successive, of pre l im in ary and progressive revelations.80
It is possible to interpret the first three paragraphs above that “religious truth is not absolute but rel-
ative” as a separate principle from “Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process,” or that
that “Divine Revelation is progressive.” Moreover, by the very fact that it is mentioned first, the prin-
ciple of “religious relativity” could be considered as the fundamental principle of Bahá’í. It is also pos-
sible, however, to see the two sentences as inseparably related and as a more elaborate version of a sin-
gle principle. Two other passages by Shoghi Effendi may clarify this relationship in determining whether
they are to be treated as two separate principles, or as one single principle:

> Let none, however, mistake my purpose, or misrepresent this card in al truth which is of the
> essence of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. The divine origin of all the Prophets of God—including
> Jesus Christ and the Apostle of God [Muhammed], the two greatest Manifestations preced in g
> the Revelation of the Bá b— is unreservedly and unshakably upheld by each and every follower
> of the Bahá’í-religion. The fundamental unity of these Messengers of God is clearly recog-
> n iz ed, the continuity of their Revelation is affirmed.81
Here Shoghi Effendi indirectly refers to the “continuity of their Revelation” as a “card in al truth which
is of the essence of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.” In the first sections above, one may also notice that the
term continuous is directly coupled with the term progressive, whereas the last quote contains the term
successive. In The Prom is ed Day is Come, and in a chapter significantly entitled “The Continuity of
Revelation,” Shoghi Effendi once again uses a similar expression:

> Repudiating the claim of any re l i gi on to be the final revelation of God to man, disclaim-
> ing fi nality for His own Revelation, Bahá’u’lláh inculcates the basic principle of the rela-

> tivity of re l i gi ous truth, the continuity of Divine Revelation, the progressiveness of reli-
> gious experience.82
What is especially noteworthy in this passage is that Shoghi Effendi uses the singular “basic princi-
ple,” but, more importantly, he links not only the terms “relativity” and “continuity,” but he is in turn
relating these to the expression “progressiveness.”

As a further support that the unity of the “Messengers of God” is seen as a central doctrine of Bahá’í,
can be seen in the next passage by Shoghi Effendi:

> That all the Messengers of God should be regarded as “abiding in the same Tabernacle, soar in g
> in the same Heaven, seated upon the same Throne, uttering the same Speech, and pro c l a im in g
> the same Faith”83 must...remain the unalterable foundation and central tenet of Bahá’í belief.84
In addition, Shoghi Effendi states in a sim il ar context of the “unity of the Manifestations of God”
that to regard Bahá’u’lláh “as essentially one of these Manifestations of God...is one of the major beliefs
of our Faith.”85

As a final support that Shoghi Effendi considers progressive revelation a central Bahá’í doctrine is that
he states that:

> the Bahá’í philosophy of progressive revelation...should be thoroughly accepted and taught by
> every loyal...Bahá’í.86
In accordance with the definitions of doctrine reviewed above, it is significant to note that the phi-
losophy of progressive revelation should not only be “thoroughly accepted,” but it should be taught as
well.

The Doctrine of Progressive Revelation in the Writings of Other Authors

Although it is clear that is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and especially Shoghi Effendi have been most instrumental in
systematizing various Bahá’í doctrines, other Bahá’í authors have used the term doctrine only recently.
For example, in 1931 Mabel Hyde Paine recorded, in her “Pilgrims’ Notes” the following lines, attributed
to Shoghi Effendi:

> Progressive revelation is the basis of Bahá’í Teac h in gs.87
> Although such a statement cannot be considered authoritative, it suggests a doctrinal status of
> progressive revelation. More recently, Schaefer states that the “theological pivot [of the Bahá’í
> Faith] is the teaching of the unity of the Manifestations [of God], and, hence, the unity of the
> religions.”88 Stockman also refers to progressive revelation as “the fundamental Bahá’í teach-
> ing.”89 Sim il arly, Michael Sours, who devotes a chapter to progressive revelation,90 states that
> “At the core of Bahá’u’lláh’s teaching is the belief in the complete oneness and progressiveness
> of religion.”91 In like manner, under the heading “Basic Teachings,” William Hatcher & Douglas
> Martin refer to “three fundamental principles,” as: 1) The Oneness of God, 2) The Oneness of
> Humanity, and 3) Oneness of Religion. A description of progressive revelation is included in
> the third principle.92
However, the first author to use the terms “the Baha’i doctrine of progressive revelation” was not a
Bahá’í but a non-Bahá’í, Peter L. Berger, the famous sociologist of religion.93 It would take more than
thirty years [before] Robert Stockman would use the exact same terms.94 In this context it is especially
significant that in 1954 Berger also wrote that “Progressive revelation is still held as a card in al doctrine
by the Baha’is to this day....”95

That the concept of an essential unity of religions is connected with progressive revelation and Bahá’í
doctrine can be seen in a statement by Moojan Momen:

> The concept of the unity of religions is one of the key doctrines of the Bahá’í Faith. At its
> most basic level, this doctrine can be expressed as the belief that the different religious sys-
> tems of the world merely reflect different stages in a single process, the progressive unfold-
> ment of religious “Truth.”96

\[58\] Lights of ‘Irfán

Here one may notice the expression “key doctrines” and the statement “At its most basic level,” and
that it is related to “the progressive unfoldment of religious ‘Truth.’” Sim il arly, when Dann May states
that “The Bahá’í concept of religious unity...is one of the most fundamental doctrines of the Bahá’í
Faith,” he continues to describe this doctrine as follows:

> This doctrine affirms the existence of a common transcendent source from which the world’s
> religious traditions originate and receive their inspiration. The Bahá’í writings view the religions
> of the world not as isolated and sporadic events, but as participants in a successively unfold in g
> process called progressive revelation.97
Indirectly addressing the concept of progressive revelation, Alessandro Bausani succinctly states that
“the whole Bahá’í Faith is centered on this theophanical idea [evolution in time, and unity in the present
hour]” and that “all of the doctrines of the Faith can be encompassed by the phrase ‘evolution in time.’”98
The three keywords here are: theophany (“the Manifestation of God”), evolution (“progress”), and unity,
terms and concepts which all play pr im ary roles in the Bahá’í doctrine of progressive revelation.

Progressive revelation has also been discussed in relation to Islam.99 Heshmat Moayyad, for example,
d is cusses progressive revelation in the context of the Islamic “Seal of the Prophet doctrine” and religious
f in al i t y, and refers to it as “the Bahá’í doctrine of continu in g, progressive revelation.”100 Stephen
Lambden writes that Bahá’í in some respects is “neo-Islamic” in that certain Bahá’í doctrines (e.g.,
tawhíd, al-ism al-a’zam, and progressive revelation) are “obviously Islamic.”101

Juan Cole is the first author who uses the term “The Babi-B ah a’i doctrine of progressive revelation”
and it is significant that he views this doctrine in terms of “a continuous sacred history.”102 Loni
Bramson-Lerche states that progressive revelation is an “important doctrine of the Bahá’í Faith.”103
Schaefer goes one step further and in a chapter entitled “The New Paradigm: Progressive Revelation,”
since he refers to progressive revelation as a “fundamental doctrine.”104 Most recently, in a review arti-
cle of the earlier mentioned Revisioning the Sacred, it is notable that Susan Stiles Maneck uses the terms
“the Bahá’í doctrine of Progressive Revelation.”105

The one Bahá’í author who most clearly and elaborately states that progressive revelation is not only
an important Bahá’í doctrine, but the central one, is Nader Saiedi. Although he also states that the doc-
trine of the Manifestation of God “is a fundamental, central, theological, philosophical, and sociologi-
cal concept of the Bahá’í Faith,” he simultaneously states that the “doctrine of progressive revelation can
be characterized as the central theological principle of the Bahai Faith.” 106 Moreover, even though Saiedi
states that progressive revelation is “One of the most important principles of Bahá’í theology,”107 he also
points to its complexity when he declares that “the doctrine of progressive revelation” simultaneously is
“a theory of knowledge, a metaphysics of being, a prophetology, a theology, an eschatology, a social the-
ory, an ethical doctrine, and an aesthetic approach to life.”108

Finally, it should also be mentioned that the term and concept of progressive revelation has been por-
trayed in the form of a video,109 it has also has found its way into various Bahá’í dictionaries, a Bahá’í
encyclopedia, and is central to many Bahá’í home-pages.110 Most significantly, the official Bahá’í home-
page, which includes various “Spiritual Truths” of Bahá’í, it is noteworthy that “The Oneness of
Religion” is included, and that “The principle of the unity of religion” is described as being “at the cen-
ter of Bahá’í teachings.” 111 That progressive revelation has acquired doctrinal status in Bahá’í is clear
since the International Bahá’í Library (Israel) classifies progressive revelation under the head in g
“Doctrines, Theology.”112 That the doctrines of manifestation and progressive revelation are intimately
related and important, can be seen in that a graduate-course, developed and taught by Landegg Academy
(Switzerland), entitled “Comparative Study of Religion and the Concepts of the Manifestation and
Progressive Revelation.”113

A final, and very recent example, that the Bahá’í Faith can be understood in terms of progressive rev-
elation may also be seen a non-Bahá’í source—the Encyclopedia Britannica:

> The cornerstone of Baha’i belief is the conviction that Baha’ Ullah and his forerunner, who was
> known as the Bab, were manifestations of God, who in his essence is unknowable. The principal

> B ah a’i tenets are the essential unity of all religions and the unity of humanity. Baha’is believe that
> all the founders of the world’s great religions have been manifestations of God and agents of a pro-
> gressive divine plan for the education of the human race.114
What is especially interesting with these introductory remarks of describing the Bahá’í Faith is that
they immediately, albeit implicitly, identify progressive revelation as the “cornerstone of Baha’i belief”
and that “the essential unity of all religions” is one of “principal Baha’i tenets.” The final sentence above
connects the various points raised earlier since “the world’s great religions have been manifestations of
God” (including the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh) are all part of “a progressive divine plan” i.e., progressive rev-
elation.

Progressive Revelation Def in ed

To cite a few examples of Bahá’í definitions of progressive revelation, the following examples will suf-
fice. In Daybook—Passages for Deepening and Meditation, the reader is asked the question “What is
meant by the term progressive revelation?” whereupon the answer is given as:

> Progressive revelation refers to the belief that God has a great plan which He unfolds to man in dif-
> ferent periods in history. Each Messenger of God (such as Moses, Christ, and Bahá’u’lláh) reveals a

A Basic Bahá’í Dictionary defines progressive revelation as:

> The concept that Divine Revelation is not final, but continu in g. The concept is founded on
> the belief that all the Greater Prophets of the past were Manifestations of God who appeared
> in different ages with teac h in gs appropriate to the needs of the time....116
Sim il arly, in A Resource Guide for the Scholarly Study of the Bahá’í Faith, progressive revelation is
def in ed as:

> The Bahá’í belief that the major religions have been founded by Manifestations of God and
> that the Manifestations succeed one another, each bringing a greater measure of divine truth
> to humanity.117
Finally, the most elaborate attempt to concisely articulate progressive revelation has been made by
Stockman, who, in a Bahá’í Encyclopedia article, states:

> Possibly the central principle behind the Bahá’í concept of the oneness of religion, progressive
> revelation asserts two important positions: 1) that all the major religions of the world are at
> least partially based on a divine revelation, conveyed to them by a Manifestation of God; and
> 2) that the revelations brought by the Manifestations are not contradictory, but constitute a
> single, ongoing divine educational process for humanity.118
In this context it is notable that Stockman states that progressive revelation possibly is “the central
principle behind the Bahá’í concept of the oneness of religion.”

From these four definitions a few recurrent themes emerge. First of all, it is evident that three of the
definitions refer to progressive revelation as a belief, while one designates it as a central principle.
Secondly, the notion of Manifestations of God occur in all four definitions, and thirdly, the inclusion of
various key terms such as succession (“succeed”) and continuity (“continu in g”) are significant.

Taken together, these examples strongly suggests that progressive revelation can indeed be understood
as a “belief” and “something that is taught.”

The Process of Doctrin al iz ation

In this context it is significant that E. G. Browne stated that the Bábí-Bahá’í teac h in gs were “vary in g
and unfixed,” and that he noted that it contained little doctrine “touching on questions of Metaphysics,
Ontology, or Eschatology.”119 Although Ibrahim Kheiralla introduced many idiosyncratic and highly per-
sonal ideas into the early American Bahá’í community, he still emphasized “the Bahá’í doctrine of pro-
gressive revelation.”120 Although his list of “Prophets” did include Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha,

\[60\] Lights of ‘Irfán

C hr ist, and Muhammad, he also included such religious figures as Confucius121 and Haiwatha.122 With
the advent of a few Persian Bahá’í teachers to America to clarify the Bahá’í Faith,123 it is noteworthy that,
for example, ‘Abdu’l-Karím-i-Tihrání may have discussed progressive revelation as early as 1890.124

Moreover, at the beginning of the twentieth century, a dozen American Bahá’ís attempted to summarize
lists of the Bahá’í teachings. An early example of such a list may be exemplified by Corinne True, who in
1902 entitled her list “Fundamental Points of Behaism.” What is especially interesting in this context is
that the list was “dominated by points on progressive revelation and the central figures of the Bahá’í
Faith.”125 It is also significant that two years later, and what was called “the House of Spirituality” in
Chicago, “added a note” to its Constitution “that demonstrated the fascination of the early American
Bahá’ís with the Bahá’í principle of progressive revelation and with their Faith’s fulfillment of prophecy.”126
Simultaneously, Peter Smith also states that in the American Bahá’í community, at the beginning of the
twentieth century, “There was no credo to affirm” and that there was “the lack of any creedal formulation
beyond the statement of universal principles” and further that there was even “opposition toward the idea
of dogma.”127 Thus, it is informative that in 1908 Thornton Chase writes the following lines about ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá: “Unless questions of metaphysics, dogmas and doctrines are introduced, he seldom mentions
them.”128 It is also of interest that even as late as 1915 Wilson wrote that “Bahaism has not a fi xed body
of doctrines.”129 However, Peter Smith maintains that in 1917 (which was the centennial celebration of
Bahá’u’lláh’s birth) some Chicago Bahá’ís had plans for teaching in the Central States in the U.S.A. and
where “pure doctrine were asserted in no uncertain terms,”130 and he further states that with Shoghi
Effendi’s publication of The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh in 1934 the “doctrinal confusion” was ended.131

Conclusion

It should by now be evident that the term and concept progressive revelation has undergone what may
be referred to as a “process of do c t r in al iz ation.” Starting with Bahá’u’lláh, neither the term nor the doc-
trine of progressive revelation were explicitly stated. Gradually, and most likely inspired by visiting
Persian Bahá’í teachers to America, various attempts to make lists to summ ar ize the Bahá’í teachings
were made. A few years later ‘Abdu’l-Bahá formulated a set of core-principles during his travels to the
West, among which the essential unity of religions was central. Subsequently, with Shoghi Effendi’s
extensive correspondence with the globally expanding Bahá’í Faith, principles of adm in is t rations were
set, and a variety of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings were translated. Although the technical term progressive rev-
elation antedates Shoghi Effendi’s “Guardianship,” it is only during his adm in is t ration that it became a
central doctrine.132 Following the terminology introduced by Shoghi Effendi, later Bahá’í authors alter-
natively have referred to progressive revelation as an idea, concept, principle, theme, thesis, and basic
Bahá’í teaching, and most importantly, as a belief and doctrine. The ultimate step in the process of doc-
t r in al iz ation can be seen when the very term progressive revelation not only entered Bahá’í pamphlets,
dictionaries, encyclopedias, the International Bahá’í Library, and the official Bahá’í home-page, as a key
term, concept, and doctrine, but, most significantly, that it also has been taught as a graduate course.

From this brief review it should by now be evident that it is possible to find direct and explicit sup-
port in various texts by the central Bahá’í figures and other authors, that the idea of progressive revela-
tion is not just an idea or a concept, but that it is a central Bahá’í doctrine. If not the central doctrine,
then at least, together with the doctrine of the oneness of humankind, one of the most central Bahá’í
doctrines. Thus, any attempts to build a future Bahá’í theology—in order to define, understand, and
express the Bahá’í Faith—must be solidly built on this, the “Bedrock of Bahá’í Belief.”
