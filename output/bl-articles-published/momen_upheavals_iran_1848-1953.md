THE SOCIAL BASIS OF THE BABI UPHEAVALS IN IRAN (1848-53):
A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
I. INTRODUCTION

In the middle of the nineteenth century, Iran was shaken by a series of serious upheavals caused by the Babi
movement.1 Although of short duration, these upheavals engulfed the entire country and had far-reaching
effects in that they formed the first of a chain of events that led on the one hand, to the constitutional
movement in Iran, and on the other, to the establishment of the now world-wide Baha'i Faith.

Sayyid `Ali Muhammad Shirazi (1819-1850) took the title, the Bab, in 1844 and advanced a religious
claim. Initially this claim appeared to be only that he was in communication with the Hidden Imam (the Imam
Mahdi),2 and the claim was directed principally at the adherents of the Shaykhi school who had just suffered
the loss of their leader, Sayyid Kazim Rashti, and were in search of another leader. After a few years,
however, it became clear that the Bab's claim involved more than this. Almost simultaneously, in the summer
of 1848, at his own trial in Tabriz before the Crown Prince, Nasiru'd-Din Mirza, and at a conference of his
followers at Badasht in Khurasan, the claim was put forward that the Bab was in fact the Imam Mahdi
returned and that he was the bearer of a new revelation from God which abrogated the Islamic dispensation,
the Qur'an and the Shari`a.

Such a claim was a direct challenge to the Islamic hierarchy and was immediately followed by the raising
of the Black Standard in Khurasan (see 11 below), an action that was seen as a challenge to the state. Shortly
afterwards, there occurred the first of the major Babi upheavals at Shaykh Tabarsi in Mazandaran (October
1848-May 1849). This was followed by the first Nayriz upheaval (May-June 1850) and the prolonged Zanjan
upheaval (May 1850-January 1851). The Bab himself was put to death in Tabriz on 9 July 1850. One and a
half years after the termination of the Zanjan upheaval, there occurred on 15 August, 1852, an attempted
assassination of Nasiru'd-Din Shah by a group of Babis. This led in the next few months to the arrest and
execution of a large number of Babis in Tihran and elsewhere. A year later there was a second Nayriz
upheaval (October-December 1853).

Following this bloody repression, the Babi movement went underground only to reappear two decades
later as the Baha'i movement. The social and economic teachings of the Bab undoubtedly had widespread
appeal and influenced the

158         Moojan Momen

nationalist and constitutionalist movements that were to emerge a few decades later to an extent that is at
present insufficiently appreciated, as Keddie has pointed out.3

The manner in which the Bab was able within a very short space of time to amass a considerable number of
followers has led some scholars to look for underlying social and economic factors as an explanation. And
certainly there was plenty of cause for social unrest in Iran during the period 1800-1850.

Probably the first to examine the Babi movement from an economic and social viewpoint was Ivanov.4

Writing from a Marxist viewpoint, he has examined the situation in Iran at this time. Ivanov's description of
the social and economic crisis in Iran at this time is well supported by evidence from other sources.

With regard to the balance of trade, Ivanov cites some interesting evidence. The principle trade route for
Iran from 1830 to 1880 was the Istanbul-Erzerum-Tabriz route which carried most of the import and export
trade. Ivanov's figures, taken from Russian sources on the overall trading balance for Tabriz for the period
1833-47, compare well with figures compiled by the British consul in Tabriz (see Table 1). These figures are
for total foreign trade centered in Tabriz, including Russian trade, and demonstrate a large deficit to Iran.

The situation was also bad for Iran at Bushihr where there was an annual trade deficit of approximately
,74,000 on average over the period 1817 to 1823.5 The small trading surplus which there may have been in
trade with Central Asia could not have made much difference to these figures. The size of this deficit in the
balance of payments can be better appreciated when one remembers that the total revenue of the state at this
time, in both cash and kind, was of the order of , 1,250,000.6

Social Basis of the Babi Upheavals in Iran        159

Such massive and continuing deficits meant, in practical terms, a considerable drain of gold and silver from
the country. The economic consequences of this may for a number of years have been cushioned by the
immense booty brought back from India by Nadir Shah. However, the continuing drain of gold and silver on
account of these factors was beginning to be felt by the 1840's. Progressive debasement of the coinage and
other factors led to an inflation rate of between 70 and 150 percent in the period from 1843 to 1861, with
some important commodities such as wheat and barley tripling in price.7

Apart from the purely economic consequences of the trade with Europe, there was also the social disruption
caused by the import of European manufactured goods leading to the decline and even death of many
traditional local industries. Especially hard hit were Iranian merchants, who, hampered by a corrupt and
extortionate administration, were no match for European mercantile firms that were favoured by trade
agreements and protected by strong consular powers.

In addition to these social and economic factors, the two military defeats by Russia in 1804-13 and 1826-
28, as well as Iran's humiliation at the hands of the English over Herat in 1838, were the first times that the
vast superiority of the West and Iran's degradation from the glories of Safavid rule and Nadir Shah's
conquests were clearly demonstrated to intelligent Iranians; a fact of which they were henceforth constantly
reminded by the haughty demeanour and manifest power of European diplomatic and consular personnel.
Moreover, the farcical proceedings of Haji Mirza Aqasi, Muhammad Shah's Prime Minister, the pervasive
corruptness of the administration, the sorry state of the Army and the obscurantism and greed of most of the
ulama could only serve to increase the general dissatisfaction and restlessness of the people.

Thus, Ivanov sees the Babi movement as "a popular mass movement, born out of definite social conditions
and directed against the ruling class."" Ivanov stresses the merchant-class background of the Bab and the
influence this had on his teaching; such things as the high standing given to trade as a profession, the
legalisation of interest, the inviolability of commercial correspondence. Ivanov then asserts that a new phase
of the movement began with the emergence of Mulla Muhammad `Ali Barfurushi, who was of a peasant
family and promoted such ideas as abolition of all taxes and of private property.9 He describes the Babi
upheavals as risings of "peasants, artisans, urban poor, and small tradespeople" against feudalism and
"enslavement of the country by foreign capital."10 He contends that it was the particular circumstances in Iran
that led to the leadership of the movement by the lower clergy and small-trade bourgeoisie.11

Keddie has pointed out the similarity between the Babi uprisings in Iran and the Taiping revolt in China.

She has noted the similarities in the leadership of the movement, the nature of the revolts, the influence of
Christianity and the West, the social content of the teachings of the two movements (including some elements
of community of property, strict regulation of personal morality, and an enhanced position for women), and
the nationalistic tendency (with the revival of the solar calendar and a Zoroastrian theory of elements).12
Keddie has also referred to the social and economic impact of the West and the probable hastening effect this
had on such movements as Babism.13

160       Moojan Momen

Avery has looked to "an element in the movement's origins of the protest of the south against the north, a
protest articulated by merchants who were prospering from trade through Shiraz and its port of Bushire, and
through the cities of Yazd and Kerman with their port Bandar Abbas, with both the Indian subcontinent and
Mesopotamia"14 in order to explain the impetus acquired by the movement.

Finally, Kazemi has reviewed the economic, social, and political dislocation in Iran in the first half of the
nineteenth century and has pointed out that many of the factors laid down by Max Weber as precipitating the
emergence of a charismatic leader were fulfilled in Iran at this time.15

Although they have referred to the economic and social factors leading to the emergence of Babism,
Ivanov, Keddie, and Kazemi have all been careful to stress the cultural, historical, and religious continuity of
Babi teaching. They have noted the importance of the Shi`i doctrine of the Mahdi as well as the linking role of
the Shaykhi movement in this continuity. Thus, as Kazemi has noted, unlike Weber's charismatic leader, the
Bab did not stress the break with the past.16 Indeed much of the Bab's writings revolve around emphasising
and explaining this continuity. However, we shall not explore that theme in this article.

In the present work, I shall attempt to make a more detailed analysis than any made hitherto of the social
background of those persons who followed the Bab, and in particular those who participated in the Babi
upheavals. I shall also consider the question of the contribution of social and economic factors to the spread of
the Babi movement.

The Babi Upheavals

Of the four major Babi upheavals in the period from 1848 to 1853, unquestionably the most important was
that at Shaykh Tabarsi, and this for the following reasons:

1\. The Bab himself instructed Mulla Husayn to initiate this episode by raising the Black Standard in Khurasan

> and journeying westward. The Bab moreover issued a general call to his disciples to rally to the Black
> Standard

2\. This episode involved the two leading disciples of the Bab, Mulla Muhammad `Ali Barfurushi, Quddus,

> and Mulla Husayn Bushru'i, and a total of nine of the eighteen "Letters of the Living," the first disciples of
> the Bab. The Zanjan and Nayriz upheavals involved none of the "Letters of the Living," and were each led
> by one of the Bab's prominent disciples. Two of the "Letters of the Living," the famous Tahira (Qurratu'l-
> '`Ayn) and Sayyid Husayn Yazdi, the Bab's secretary, died in the Tihran holocaust of 1852.

3\. This episode evoked a widespread response from the Babis with groups setting out from all over the

> country to join Mulla Husayn. Many succeeded in doing so while others failed on account of the efforts of
> the royal troops. Among the latter were Sayyid Yahya Darabi who was later to lead the Nayriz upheaval,
> Mirza Husayn `Ali Nuri, Baha'u'llah, and several persons who later perished in the 1852 holocaust in
> Tihran. There was no similar widespread support for the other two upheavals.

Thus, the participants at Shaykh Tabarsi may be considered as a representative cross-section of the most
active and enthusiastic followers of the Bab. For this reason, and also because of the fact that the details of
those participating have been more carefully recorded, more attention will be focused in this paper on this
episode.

II. THE SHAYKH TABARSI UPHEAVAL: 1848 - 1849

In July 1848, Mulla Husayn Bushru'i, on the Bab's instructions, raised a Black Standard in Mashhad and set
off westward. The implications of such an act for the religious hierarchy and for the government were, no
doubt, obvious to all. First, there was the well-known tradition ascribed to Muhammad: "Should you see
Black Standards coming from Khurasan, then go to them, for there you will find the Mahdi, Vicegerent of
God."17 Second, it was from just such an action, the raising of a Black Standard in Khurasan, that the
`Abbasids had succeeded in overthrowing the `Umayyad dynasty.

Mulla Husayn was not, however, challenged by the Government during his march from Khurasan--
probably because it coincided with the confusion arising from the death of Muhammad Shah. Just outside
Barfurush, however, there was a clash between the Babis and the populace which resulted in Mulla Husayn
taking up positions around the Shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi and building defensive fortifications. The ensuing
conflict lasted from mid-October 1848 to early May 1849.

Estimates of the total number of Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi differ widely. The higher estimates (such as 1,500

in the official court history, the Nasikhu't-Tawarikh,18) may be the result of exaggeration by the Shah's troops
in order to allay their discomfiture over their failure to defeat a poorly armed, untrained group of civilians for
such a lengthy period. The Babi and Baha'i histories seem to agree that Mulla Husayn had with him on arrival
at Shaykh Tabarsi a little more than 300 men.19 However, a considerable number of Babis joined after this,
including some from the surrounding villages.20 I will discuss the probable total number of participants
below.

In the second volume of his Tarikh-i-Shuhaday-i-Amr, Malik-Khusravi has gathered whatever names and
biographical details are available on the Babi participants at Shaykh Tabarsi. His most important sources
include three manuscript accounts by survivors of the episode,21 two histories based on accounts given by
other survivors,22 the Nuqtatu'l-Kaf, the Tarikh-i-Jadid, and a number of other sources.23

IIa. Occupations of Babi participants at Shaykh Tabarsi. Table 2 shows the occupations of the Babi
participants at Shaykh Tabarsi.

IIb. Total Number of Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi. The information provided by Malik-Khusravi may be
supplemented from another source. One of the most important sources, the Tarikh-i-Mimiyya by Mahjur,
gives an analysis by towns of origin of the 313 persons who accompanied Mulla Husayn as he entered
Mazandaran from Mashhad. Such a list is not, of course, complete since this

above. Finally there is one major Sufi murshid (of Tihran) who is not strictly speaking of the ulama but is put here as being a "religious leader".

b Includes all mullas (akhunds) and tullab (talamidh), also two pishnamazes. two mutavallis, and one mu'azzin. Of course many of the minor ulama
engaged in other occupations. The only ones noted by Malik-Khusravi were: one hakkak (engraver) of Mazandaran, one gandum-pak-kun (wheatsifter)
of Isfahan, and one attar (druggist) of Khurasan. These three have been included in this category.

c Includes one mustawfi, one Afsharid prince, and also seven Mazandaranis who were members of an important landowning family.

d Includes one described as dastmal-girih-zan (marriage broker), two sarrafs (money-changers/brokers), and one who is described as being an agent
for a wholesale merchant.

e lncludes one man described as payvand (? grafter).

f Includes all retainers and personal servants.

g Includes one man, Aqa Bayk-i-Lur, who was presumably a tribesman.

h No information as to occupation available. These have been subdivided thus: [a] urban; belonging to large and medium-sized towns -see section 11c
below. [b] rural; belonging to small towns and villages - see section 11c below. [c] unknown origin. Some twenty-six persons in the unclassified
category had either "Mirza" or "Shaykh" in front of their names, indicating that they had at least received an education.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

represents a very early stage in this episode, but it serves as a check on Malik-Khusravi's list. I have
compared the two lists in Table 3. 24

The principal discrepancies which appear between the two lists in Table 3 can be explained as follows:

1\. Mahjur's list was compiled at a very early stage of the proceedings and many, especially

Mazanadaranis, joined after this.

2\. Malik-Khusravi's sources seem to display an ethnocentric bias in that non-Persian participants are

> not named. Thus, of five persons from Karbila, fourteen from Hirat, and four Indians in Mahjur's
> list, only one Karbala'i and eight Hiratis are named in Malik-Khusravi's sources.

3\. Similarly, certain towns such as Kashan, Shahrud, Hamadan, and Kirmanshah are not represented

> in Malik-Khusravi's sources. This may be because of the absence of any survivors from that town

We may make a speculative attempt at completing Malik-Khusravi's list by adding each positive
difference between his and Mahjur's list (see Table 4).

a Since Mahjur's list applies only to Mulla Husayn's companions prior to their entry into Mazandaran, a different method has been used to obtain this
figure. It is clear that a large number of Mazandarani villagers joined the Babis. The only figure I have found for these villagers is the reference to 120
Mazandaranis under the Bihnamiri chief, Aqa Rasul (Browne, New History, p. 67). Therefore, I have subtracted the 18 Bihnamiris already listed in
Malik-Khusravi from 120 to arrive at this number.

Thus, the number of Babi participants at Shaykh Tabarsi was probably between 540 and 600
(allowing for some others who may have joined after

Mahjur's listing and who were not named in one of Malik-Khusravi's sources). Malik-Khusravi's list
probably represents approximately 65 percent of the Babi participants at Shaykh Tabarsi.

llc. Rural/Urban Origin of Babi Participants at Shaykh Tabarsi. Taking Malik-Khusravi and Mahjur as a
basis, we may now assess the number of people at Shaykh Tabarsi from rural and urban backgrounds; see

Source: This table was compiled on the basis of the list of towns given by Thomson in Parliamentary Papers, Vol. 69 for 1867-68, pp. 507-15;
reprinted by Issawi, Economic History, p. 28. Also in French in Bull. Soc. Geog., 5e ser., vol. 18 (1869), pp. 15-40. This does not imply, however, that
I agree with all the details of this list. (In Thomson's table there are 12 large towns with populations of greater than 22,000 and 23 medium-sized towns
with populations 7,000-22,000.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The grouping together of small towns and villages in Table 5a is not, however, totally satisfactory and so in
Table 5b, I have repeated totals for other categories, but separated the category of small towns and villages
into its component parts as explained in the notes below Table 5b.

It is worth noting the large contribution made to these totals by four small villages: Bushru'iyya in
Khurasan (24 persons); Bihnamir25 in Mazandaran (40 or more persons); and Shahmirzad (9 persons) and
Sangsar26 (26 persons), two adjoining villages near Simnan. Thus a total of 98 or more persons are from
these four villages. Miyamay in Khurasan contributed a further 31 persons. The totals for Bihnamir and
Bushru'iyya are probably underestimated.

Concerning the 365 participants listed by Malik-Khusravi, the following additional information is available:

1\. There were 54 survivors, a large number of whom (22) were, as may be expected, Mazandaranis. This total

> of 54 however includes a number of persons who betrayed their comrades and thus managed to escape with
> their lives.

2\. Malik-Khusravi only named some 13 persons as being Shaykhis, which may indicate that although in the

> Shaykhis), by this time the Bab's appeal had widened considerably and former Shaykhis were no longer
> numerically important although of course the importance of such figures as Mulla Husayn Bushru'i and

> to study under Sayyid Kazim.

3\. There were 34 Sayyids among the 365 listed by Malik-Khusravi.

III. THE NAYRiZ UPHEAVALS OF 1850 AND 1853

It is much more difficult to obtain information about the Babi participants in the Nayriz and Zanjan upheavals
since these have not been studied in such detail as Malik-Khusravi's study of Shaykh Tabarsi. Concerning
Nayriz, we know that it was a small town in Iran, which Lovett in 1872 estimated to have a population of
3,000.27 It consisted of three quarters (mahallas)28 and was famous principally for the growing of fruit.

The man who brought the Babi movement to Nayriz was Sayyid Yahya
Darabi who was given the title Vahid by the Bab. Vahid was the son of one of
the most famous of the contemporary ulama, Sayyid Ja'far Darabi, known as

Kashfi. Vahid received the usual theological training, but he was not apparently an adherent of the Shaykhi
school.

Vahid had gone to Tihran in 1849 hoping to join the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi, but was informed that the
way was blocked by the besieging army. He remained for a time in Tihran at the house of Mirza Husayn `Ali,
Baha'u'llah, and then in late 1849 set out for Yazd where he had a house. His presence in Yazd provoked an
upheaval which at one time had the deputy governor of that town besieged in his own citadel. Eventually,
Vahid's position in Yazd became untenable and he set out from Yazd toward the province of Fars. He
travelled slowly, stopping at several villages to preach to the populace of Babism. He eventually reached
Nayriz where he had previously married the daughter of Haji Shaykh 'Abdu'l-Ali, the Imam-Jum'a of the
Chinar-Sukhta quarter and a qazi.

Shortly after Vahid's arrival at Nayriz there was conflict between him and the governor, Zaynu'l-'Abidin
Khan. Vahid retired to a fort just outside Nayriz together with a number of companions; the Nayriz upheaval
had begun.

As at Shaykh Tabarsi, the government troops, finding themselves unable to deal with the Babis, resorted to
trickery in order to bring about the surrender of the Babis and then ordered a general massacre.

This first Nayriz upheaval was followed three years later by a second episode, every bit as bloody as the
first, although this time the main fighting occurred in the hills outside Nayriz where the Babis took up
positions and defended themselves against the troops. At the end of this conflict there was another general
massacre and some 200 heads of Babis, as well as several hundred Babi women and children and about 80
Babi male prisoners were sent to Shiraz.

As I have stated previously, the sources for the two Nayriz upheavals are not very detailed. I have obtained
most information from Nabil's Narrative, Nicolas' Seyyed Ali Mohammed, and Muhammad Shafi'-Ruhani's
Lam'atu'l-Anwar.29 To this I have added information drawn from a manuscript, Vaqayi'-i-Hayratangiz-i-
Nayriz-i-Mishkbiz, by Shaykh Muhammad Husayn. The first two works are both based principally on a
manuscript history by Mirza Shafi`30 and mostly list names of the martyrs whereas the third work
concentrates on the survivors of these two episodes. Unfortunately, however, none of these works give much
biographical detail and hence the listing is very incomplete.

Illa. Occupations of Babi Participants at the Two Nayriz Upheavals. Table 6 gives the occupations of the
participants in the two Nayriz upheavals. No attempt has been made to separate the two episodes because
most of those participating in the second had also taken part in the first.

Illb. Origins of Participants at the Two Nayriz Upheavals. Vahid himself, although described as Darabi, was
in fact born and brought up in Yazd. Of the 337 persons listed in Table 6, seven are from Yazd, seven from
Istahbanat, one from Bavanat, and the remaining 322 persons were Nayrizis. (See also comments in the next
section.)

Illc. Total Numbers of Babi participants at the Two Nayriz Upheavals. As usual, there are a good many
estimates of the total number of Babi participants

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

in these upheavals. For the first upheaval, the Nasikhu't-Tawarikh states that initially, 300 Babis occupied the
fort and that later their numbers grew to 2,000.31 Hasan-i-Fasa'i, in the Fars-Nama Nasiri, states that initially
there were 500 Babis and that their numbers swelled to more than 3,000.32 According to Nicolas' Babi
source, the number was 700-800.33 There are fewer figures for the second upheaval. Nicolas states that at the
end of this episode 603 women and 80 male prisoners were taken captive to Shiraz.34 Nabil's Narrative gives
the numbers as 600 women prisoners, 180 males prisoners and 180 male "martyrs"; a total of 960.35

We may arrive at an estimate of the numbers of Babis involved in the Nayriz upheavals by a different
means. We know that on Vahid's arrival at Nayriz almost the whole of one of the town's quarters, the Chinar-
Sukhta quarter,36 together with some people of the other quarters, flocked to hear him speak and became his
followers; Nabil gives the numbers as 1,000 persons of the Chinar-Sukhta quarter and 500 from other parts of
Nayriz.37 Now, it cannot be assumed that all of those who flocked to Vahid in the heat of the moment after
his address in the mosque continued to follow him once it became clear that an armed conflict was inevitable
and that their lives would be at stake. Nevertheless, this gives us an estimate for the population of the Chinar-
Sukhta quarter that compares well with Lovett's statement that the town's population was 3,500 spread over
three quarters.33 By the time of the second episode, the town had become sharply polarized, with all the
Babis living in the Chinar-Sukhta quarter.

From these different statements, I would be inclined to put the Babi population of Nayriz participating in
the two upheavals at about 1,000. The number of persons that Vahid brought with him to Nayriz was
insignificant beside this. They are stated to have been 72 persons,39 of whom 20 were from Istahbanat40 and
many of the rest from Yazd. At least five ulama from Istahbanat participated in the second episode.41

We may assume, moreover, that from a sociological point of view, the followers of Vahid consisted of a
representative cross-section of a quarter in a small town.

IV. THE ZANJAN UPHEAVAL 1850-1851

The Babi leader in the Zanjan episode was another man of extraordinary capacities. His name was Mulla
Muhammad `Ali Zanjani, and before the rise of Babism he had been called Hujjatu'l-lslam, and he was later
named by the Bab Hujjat. Hujjat's father was one of the leading ulama of Zanjan, and Hujjat had acquired the
usual theological education with the ulama of Karbala and Najaf before returning to Zanjan, on his father's
death, in order to take up his father's position. But there was already the element of friction between Hujjat
and the mujtahids of Zanjan because in `Iraq Hujjat had espoused the doctrines of the anti-mujtahid Akhbari
school. The ulama of Zanjan complained to Muhammad Shah, who brought Hujjat to Tihran to be examined.
Hujjat acquitted himself well before an assembly of ulama and returned to Zanjan with the King's favour.
Then came the advent of Babism and Hujjat's enthusiastic avowal of it. This added fuel to the complaints of
the ulama of Zanjan, and eventually, after a comparatively minor incident, violence broke out and the town
was divided into two halves, the eastern half being in the hands of the Babis.

This episode lasted longer than the others, some eight months in all. Zanjan was a much larger and more
important town than Nayriz, and the number of Babi participants was greater. This time the siege ended not so
much by treachery, as by the gradual attrition of the Babis.

Unfortunately, our sources for Zanjan are even poorer than for Nayriz and Shaykh Tabarsi. I have used
Nabil's Narrative and Nicolas' Seyyed Ali Mohammad (both of these use the manuscript history of Husayn
Zanjani, and the latter has in addition a history by Aqa Naqd-`Ali). I have also used Aqa `Abdu'l-Ahad
Zanjani's memoirs translated by Browne.. These sources yielded only sixty-eight names and very little
biographical information.

IVa. Occupations of Babi Participants at Zanjan. Table 7 gives the occupations of the Babi participants at
Zanjan.

IVb. Origins of Babi Participants at Zanjan. Of the 68 names, all were from Zanjan barring two. One of these
was a Shirazi and one was from Baku.

IVc. Total Numbers of Babi Participants at Zanjan. As usual, the Muslim sources have exaggerated the
number of Babis present, presumably once again to

make light of the inability of the Shah's troops to take the town. The Nasikhu't-Tawarikh gives the grossly
inflated figure of 15,000 Babis,42 which is several thousand greater than the probable total population of
Zanjan at this time. Nabil estimates a total of 1,800 "martyrs"43 with 500 women prisoners at the end of the
siege,44 and 100 women and children taken prisoner earlier in the siege;45 a total of 2,400 which does not
take into account a number of desertions from the Babi side that were reported to have occurred. Shaykh `Ali
Bakhsh gives the figure of 3,000 including deserters,46 and Aqa `Abdu'l-Ahad states that there were 3,000 of
whom about 1,000 deserted when Hujjat explained to them their probable fate.47 Aqa `Abdu'l-Ahad also
states that there were sixty barricades with 19 men at each barricade.43 This would require 1,140 men, and if
we assume an equal number of women were involved, a total of 2,280.

All in all it would appear that if we take a total of 2,250 Babi participants, excluding deserters, we would
not be far wrong. In the Babi accounts there is only slight support for the contention that there was
widespread involvement of Babis from villages surrounding Zanjan as Ivanov has stated.49

From the point of view of the social background of the Babi participants, in all probability this consisted of
a representative cross-section of the population of a medium-sized Iranian town. An interesting social
comment on the Babis of Zanjan is to be found in the history of Mirza Husayn Zanjani, a survivor of the
episode:

And as for the Babis, whichever of them were of the poorer classes of the town, or the traders or the sayyids
or the tullab or others resisted the enemy with complete constancy, and began to build fortifications. Some
who were of the rich, and wealth had become a veil for them, went over to the side of the Muslims, and these
were those whose place had always been at the head of the assembly or in the front of the mimbar.50

V. THE TIHRAN EPISODES OF 1850 AND 1852

There were two major episodes in Tihran. The first, in 1850, is known as the "Seven Martyrs of Tihran"

whereas the second in 1852, following an attempt on the life of the Shah, was a much more serious affair
involving the arrest and execution of a large number of Babis.

Va. "The Seven Martyrs of Thran," 1850. In Tihran in 1850, a number of
Bab‫ي‬s were arrested and seven put to death. These seven are named by Nabil as
follows:51
1\. Haj‫ ي‬M‫ي‬rza Siyyid `Al‫ ي‬Sh‫ي‬raz‫ي‬, a merchant (tajir).
2\. M ‫ي‬rza Qurban-'AI ‫ي‬Barfurush ,‫ي‬a Sufi murshid of the Ni'matullah ‫ي‬order .
3\. Haj‫ ي‬Mulla Isma'll Qum‫ي‬, an akhund.
4\. Siyyid Husayn Tursh‫ي‬z‫ي‬, a mujtahid.
5\. Haj‫ ي‬Muhammad Taq‫ ي‬Kirman‫ي‬, merchant (tajir).
6\. Siyyid Murtida Zanjan‫ي‬, merchant (tdjir).
7\. Muhammad Husayn Maraghi'‫ي‬, a government official.52

Of these seven men, Browne has written, echoing the words of the authors of the Tarikh-i-Jadid and the
Nuqtatu'l-Kaf:

They were men representing all the more important classes in PersiaCdivines, dervishes, merchants,
shopkeepers, and government officials; they were men who had enjoyed the respect and consideration of all;
they died fearlessly, willingly, almost eagerly, declining to purchase life by that mere lip-denial, which, under
the name of ketman or takiya, is recognised by the Shi`ites as a perfectly justified subterfuge in case of peril;
they were not driven to despair of mercy as were those who died at Sheykh Tabars and Zanjan; and they
sealed their faith with their blood in the public square of the Persian capital wherein is the abode of the
foreign ambassadors accredited to the Shah.53

Even in the geographical spread of their hometowns, these seven men represented all Iran, with one of them
each being from Fars, Mazandaran, Khurasan, Adharbayjan, Kirman, Khamsa and Qum. It would have been
difficult to have picked seven men who were more representative of all that was most respected in mid-
nineteenth century Iran.

W. The Tihran Executions of 1852. Following the disturbances of 1850, there was a period of one and a half
years in which the Bab‫ ي‬movement appears to have become quiescent. A group of the Babis of Tihran,
however, plotted to assassinate Nasiru'd-D‫ي‬n Shah, whom they held to be responsible for the death of their
leader and their comrades. This single episode hardly justifies Ivanov's sweeping statement that after the
defeat of the previous uprisings, the Babi leaders turned to terrorism.54

The assassination attempt failed and there ensued a large number of arrests and executions. We have been
given, however, two somewhat contradictory pictures of the executions. One account states that some thirty or
forty men were arrested and most of these executed individually by various groups of government officials
and other bodies. On the other hand, Gobineau speaks of large numbers of Bab‫ي‬s, including women and
children marching, en masse, to their death at the

hands of the official executioners.55 There is some support for Gobineau's version in a newspaper account of
400 Babis having been put to death.56

If, however, the second view is correct, it is surprising that no names or even descriptions of these other
martyrdoms have been given in any Babi, Baha'i or Muslim source. Nor is there any reference to them by the
ministers of foreign powers in Iran. I am therefore inclined to take the view that the first version is the more
accurate. My source of names for this episode is the thirty-five listed in the newspaper Ruznama-yi -
Vaqai'ivya-yi-lttifaqiyya57 to which I have only added the famous Babi heroine, Tahira, Qurratul-'Ayn.
Biographical details of these martyrs was obtained from various sources; in particular, the third volume of
Malik-Khusravi's Tarikh-i-Shuhada-yi-Amr.

Vc. Occupations of the Babis executed in Tihran in 1852. Table 8 gives the occupations and geographical
distribution of the Babis executed in Tihran in 1852.

Vl: CONCLUSIONS

From the information accumulated above, it is possible to discern features of each episode. The Zanjan and
Nayriz episodes were localised urban upheavals centered on one charismatic personality who had been
converted to Babism and succeeded in attracting a large proportion of the populace of the town to the new
movement and thereby exciting the opposition of the ulama. There is little evidence from the various accounts
of the upheavals or from the names analysed in this paper for supposing any major degree of support among
the peasantry or any large-scale movement of Babis from other parts of Iran to support their co-religionists.

The upheaval at Shaykh Tabarsi was altogether of a different character. Here with the raising of the Black
Standard in Khurasan, there was a definite challenge to the existing order. The most enthusiastic of the Babis
from all parts Iran came to enlist under Mulla Husayn's banner.

The attempted assassination of the Shah may be described in contemporary terms as an act of urban
terrorism planned by about twelve Babis in Tihran. Apart from an abortive attempt by Mirza Yahya to incite
an uprising in Takur, Mazandaran, to coincide with the attempted assassination, there is little other evidence
of any widespread participation by the Babis in this episode.

VIa. A Comparative Analysis. The listings presented here are not of course a representative cross-section of
the Babis. They are almost certainly favour of the influential classes, the ulama and merchants, and against the
poorer classes.

Because the Shaykh Tabarsi upheaval involved the participation of Babis from all over Iran-- persons
whom we may consider as the most enthusiastic of the new community even if not representative of the whole
communityC and because our figures for it are more complete than for the other upheavals, it would be
worthwhile to examine these figures more closely. In trying to compare these figures with those for Iran as a
whole at that time, we are of course greatly hindered by the lack of information about mid-nineteenth century
Iran.

Figures for the total population of Iran at this time vary widely from Thomson's estimate of 4,400,000 (in
1867)58 to Blau's 10,000,000 (in 1850).59 But various writers throughout the last half of the nineteenth
century were more agreed on the relative proportions of urban, rural and nomadic peoples (see Table 9a).

The most striking difference to be noted from Table 9a is the lack of nomads among the Babis. If, for the
time being, the nomads are excluded and the figures analysed further, Table 9b is obtained.

Although it may appear from Tables 9a and 9b that there is some preponderance in favour of towns as
against villages among the Babis as compared to the overall population of Iran, this is found not to be the case
if the figures are subjected to statistical analysis. Using Multinomial Distribution Theory, it is possible to
show that the null hypothesis (that there is no difference between the sample and the total population) is
correct when:

Applying this formula in order to determine whether there is any significant difference between the Babis at
Shaykh T. Tabarsi and the overall population of Iran as represented in Thomson's figures (see Table 9b; I
have ignored Schlinder's estimates on account of the problems outlined in note c of Table 9b), one obtains the
following result:

(22.5 - 20.7)2 + (15.4-10.7)2 + (5.8 - 5.5)2 + (56.0 - 62.9)2 = 3.00

Thus, even at a 20 percent level of significance (where one would expect to detect even small differences),
the distribution of the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi according to whether they came from a large town, medium-
sized town, small town, or village does not significantly differ from that of the general population of Iran as
estimated by Thomson (excluding the nomadic element). In other words, there was no bias toward either
urban or rural background among the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are, unfortunately, insufficiently informed of the social structure in Iran to be able to perform a similar
analysis with the data of Table 2 with respect to occupations. But in view of the fact that 37.3 percent of the
365 persons listed by Malik-Khusravi were ulama, one must suspect a strong bias towards this group It has
been said that the ulama who were converted to Babism were principally the minor ulama. However, in this
group of 136 ulama there were three mujtahids, and that cannot be far from the normal proportion of
mujtahids to akhunds and tullab. It would be true to say, however, that the leadership among the Babes was
vested in the minor ulama group to a large extent.

VIb. The Role of Women. Most accounts of Babism are agreed that one of its major social thrusts was toward
an amelioration of the social position of women. The Bab himself does not seem to have written a great deal
on this theme, apart from enacting certain laws placing restrictions on divorce.60 However, the proceedings
of the famous Babi heroine, Tahira (Qurratu'l-`Ayn) and in particular her symbolic act in discarding the veil at
the conference of Badasht, as well as the evident approval of her actions by the Bab, would indicate that this
was a basic feature of the Babi movement.

There were no women among the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi and this is not surprising in view of the
circumstances of the siege. At Zanjan and Nayriz however, the women played an important role. During the
Zanjan episode, the British consul, Abbott, visited the scene of the operations and reported to Shiel, the
British minister: "They [the Babis] fight in the most obstinate and spirited manner, the women even, of whom
several have been killed, engaging in the strife."61

It was during the Zanjan upheaval that a latter-day Joan of Arc arose in the person of Zaynab, a young Babi
girl who donned the apparel of the men and participated in the fighting with such courage and success that she
soon became the terror of the royal troops and was put in command of one section of the Babi defences.62

At Nayriz also, the women played an important part, Nabil records: "The uproar caused by their [the Babis']
womenfolk, their amazing audacity and self-confidence, utterly demoralized their opponents and paralysed
their efforts."63

It would seem that in the second Nayriz upheaval, the Babi women outnumbered the men, whose ranks had
been thinned by the first episode.

VIc. Other Social Groups. It is worth recording here the absence from the Babi lists of any persons from the
main religious minorities; Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians. Indeed the only reference that I have seen to any
of these groups being converted to Babism (as distinct from the numerous conversions to the Baha'i Faith later
on) would appear to be the result of a mistake.64

We have already noted the almost complete absence of any of the nomadic tribesmen who formed a large
part of the country's population. Indeed, there does not seem to have been any effort made by the Babis
themselves to reach this part of the population. There is also what some may regard as a surprising sparsity of
Sufi darvishes in the Babi lists-only two at Shaykh Tabarsi and one of the "Seven Martyrs of Tihran."65 In
this context, it is interesting to note that according to Mahjur, when Lutf-`Ali Mirza joined Mulla Husayn's
party dressed in the garb of a darvish, he was instructed by Mulla Husayn to change his clothing.66

VId. The Social Basis of Babism. If we may now turn our attention to the various statements made by Ivanov,
Kazemi, and others, we can examine these statements in the light of the facts presented above.

Taking into consideration the fact that the classes indicated by Ivanov as constituting the bulk of the Babi
movement (peasants, artisans, urban poor, and small tradesmen) must also have represented the vast majority
of the population of Iran at this time, one can find little evidence to support Ivanov's ideas. Although one
would agree with Ivanov that leadership of the movement was vested in the minor ulama, one is forced to
point out that quite apart from the leadership, a good part of the following was of the same category. Although
the Bab himself was a member of a mercantile family, there is little evidence that merchants whether
wholesale (tujjar) or retail played a prominent role. All in all, Bausani seems to be nearer the mark when he
writes: "The Bab's followers were drawn not only from the lower classes and the growing middle class of
traders, but even from the aristocracy."67

Much of Ivanov's thesis is based on an obscure and difficult passage in the Nuqtatu'l-Kaf 68 in which,
according to Ivanov's interpretation, Mulla Muhammad `Ali Barfurushi asserts before the Babis gathered at
the Conference of Badasht that the "old order had died away and the believers were freed of the old duties,"69
and that property was usurpation and whoever was willing to renounce it was relieved of the obligation to pay
taxes.70 On a closer examination of the text, however, it would seem that there are no grounds for even
asserting that

this passage represents a speech made by Mulla Muhammad `Ali (rather the one of the lengthy and obscure
digressions which the author of the Nuqtatu'l-Kaf frequently makes). Although it cannot be denied that Mulla
Muhammad `Ali was of peasant origin, his theological training at Mashhad and Karbala would have tended to
make him identify with the ulama class rather than the peasants and certainly whatever is extant of his
writings confirms this view of him as one of the ulama concerned with theological issues rather than a peasant
revolutionary concerned with social ones.71 Even in the case of Tahira who is usually thought of as a
champion of women's advancement, there is little evidence of such preoccupations in her writings.72 She
would first and foremost appear to have been a zealous advocate of the Bab's religious claims and only
secondly a social reformer.

Ivanov referred to the effect that the West may have had as a catalyst in promoting Babism. He refers to the
Babi upheavals as a popular rising against feudalism and enslavement to foreign capital.73 The main groups
feeling the effects of the West in Iran at this time were the craftsmen and artisans who were being deprived of
their livelihood by the influx of Western manufactured goods; the wholesale merchants who were
increasingly unable to compete with the Western merchants (who were backed by powerful consular
authorities); and, to a lesser extent at this stage, the peasant classes who were being forced into greater
poverty by the increasing demand by landlords for payment in cash rather than in goods.74

Although it is true that there was a group of craftsmen and artisans at Shaykh Tabarsi and, in particular, a
group of eighteen who came from Isfahan, the latter represented less than half of the total number coming
from Isfahan (forty-two) and even nine of them were builders (banna) whose livelihood could hardly have
been affected by Western competition. If the resentment of craftsmen and artisans were an important factor in
the Babi upheavals, one would have expected a much larger number of persons from the important
manufacturing towns of Isfahan, Kashan, Yazd, Hamadan, and Shiraz. Moreover, one may have expected
Babi disturbances within these towns.75 We have already note that there was no large-scale participation by
the merchant class who, in any cast as Kazemi has pointed out,76 had little to gain and much to lose by
joining the Babis. Although it is true that a number of peasants and villagers joined the Babis at Shaykh
Tabarsi, this seems to have been more at the instigation of local religious leader who had been converted to
Babism rather than out of desire for social reform. This was certainly the case at Bushru'iyya, Sangsar, and
Shahmirzad, whereas the case of Bihnamir is even more remarkable in that the forty or more persons from the
village who joined the Babis at Shaykh Tabarsi did so under the leadership of the local landlord, Aqa Rasul
Bihnamiri, and therefore could hardly be regarded as peasants "rising against feudalism"77 as Ivanov would
have them.

It should be noted, by way of a parenthesis at this point, that although the Babis were frequently accused by
government and religious sources (and the Europeans in Iran who usually reflected these sources)78 of being
communist and preaching anarchy, immorality, and the community of property and even of

wives, the accusations should not be taken too seriously as there is in Iran almost a tradition of accusing any
heterodox movement of holding these views. The Isma`ilis and the Mazdakites were similarly accused.79 As
Gobineau has pointed out:

It is a type of accusation made respectable by its antiquity, and one may perhaps regard it as the mark of the
oldest religious hatred in the world.... It was used against the Ophites (?.), the Carmatians, the disciples of
Mani, and others; the Muslims have used it against the Nusayris and, as we see, against the Babis. Thus
generalised this argument loses its value, and after one reads the laws of His Sublime Highness [the Bab], it
becomes evident that we must consider it simply as an insult.80

With regard to the accumulation of community of property among the Babis, there would seem to be some
justification for this. Thus in Aqa `Abdu'l-Ahad's account ofthe Zanjan upheaval there is the following:

After this His Holiness the Martyr [Mulla Muhammad `Ali Zanjani, Hujjat] commanded his followers that
they should all be as one family and one household, and that all things, from eatables to clothing, whatever
there was, should be divided for use; and his followers did even as he commanded so that they even opened
their houses to one another, and passed in and out in unity and concord.81

Similarly the Babis in Shaykh Tabarsi are reported to have pooled their money in order to pay for food
which was then prepared and served to all.82 But these actions were taken under extreme circumstances at a
time when hostilities had become inevitable and cannot therefore be taken as representing normal policy.
With respect to this moreover, Curzon has commented:

Nor does there seem to be any greater justice in the charges of socialism, communism, and immorality, that
have been so freely levelled at the youthful persuasion. Certainly no such idea as communism in the European
sense, i.e., a forcible redistribution of property, or as socialism in the nineteenth century sense, i.e., the defeat
of capital by labour, ever entered the brain of the Bab or his disciples. The only communism known to and
recommended by him was that of the New Testament and the early Christian Church, viz., the sharing of
goods in common by members of the faith, and the exercise of almsgiving, and an ample charity. The charge
of immorality seems to have arisen partly from the malignant inventions of opponents, partly from the much
greater freedom claimed for women by the Bab, which in the Oriental mind is scarcely dissociable from
profligacy of conduct.83

Gobineau has written of the Bab having come into contact with Jews and Christians in his youth84 while
Keddie states that "the Bab was probably influenced by Christian ideas."85 It would seem to me that there
was very little opportunity for the Bab to come into any significant contact with the West. Although the
redoubtable Christian missionary, Henry Martyn, had visited Shiraz in 1811, there were no resident
Europeans there from that time until the 1860's. It is true that the Bab was for a number of years in Bushihr,
where there was a British Resident of the East India Company. But at this time the staff at the Residency was
very small and there is no evidence that the Bab had direct dealings with them. Similarly, it is doubtful
whether any of the other disciples of

the Bab had any contact with Europeans in this period when there had not as yet developed the widespread
presence of European consuls, missionaries,86 and merchants that characterised Iran toward the end of the
nineteenth century. Nor with the lack of printing facilities in Iran, was there yet any opportunity for the
diffusion of European ideas by this means. Although it is tempting to look to the widespread revolutionary
ferment in Europe, which came to a climax in 1848, for parallels with the Babi movement, the vast mass of
Iranians at this time were totally unaware of what was happening in Europe and completely unaffected by the
revolutionary propaganda.

We can find little in our analysis to support Avery's contention of there being an element of the protest of
the south against the north in the Babi upheaval By far, the largest groups in the Shaykh Tabarsi episode were
from Khurasan and Mazandaran as may be expected from the fact that Mulla Husayn began his march from
Khurasan and ended it in Mazandaran. Moreover, of the other two upheavals, Nayriz was in the south, but the
larger and more prolonged Zanjan upheaval was in the north.

What then can be said about the social basis of Babism from our analysis? We know that the Babi doctrine
was spread through Iran principally by the eighteen "Letters of the Living" who were all minor ulama, having
been the tullab of Sayyid Kazim, the Shaykhi leader. The "Letters of the Living" and other emissaries of the
Bab moved from town to town and village to village, in each place converting a few persons. Those converted
to Babism were drawn from all social classes with a preponderance from the ulama, who also provided the
leadership of the movement. The manner of preaching varied from one emissary to another. Some would
teach the new religion cautiously and secretive! whereas others, particularly after about the year 1847, taught
the new religion openly and even from the mimbar.

In most places; only a handful of persons would be converted to the new religion, but occasionally there
would occur the conversion of a large number of people in one town and this was usually due to the
conversion of an important local figure, often one of the leading ulama, who would bring in those who
followed him in religious matters. This is what happened in Zanjan where Mu Muhammad 'Ali's conversion
led to about one-quarter of the town becoming Babis; and also in Nayriz where the conversion of Haji Shaykh
'Abdu'l-'Ali (a qazi) and Imam-Jum'a of the Chinar-Sukhta quarter, as well as the fame and influence of
Vahid, his son-in-law, led to the conversion of about one third of the town. These were the two largest towns
in which such a course of events occurred, and as we know, a violent upheaval ensued in each case. In some
other smaller places, a similar phenomenon occurred. In Sangsar and Shahmirzad, the conversion of the
prominent local religious leader, Aqa Siyyid Ahmad, caused the conversion of a large number of persons. In
Bihnamir, by contrast, it was a result of the conversion of a local landlord, Aqa Rasul,, that a large number
persons was converted.

Although it seems probable that there was at this time great social a economic dislocation in Iran, and this
undoubtedly induced a spirit of turmoil which would facilitate the spread of any new message, the message
brought

:he emissaries of the Bab seems to have been primarily a religious one rather than a social one. The
conversions that occurred would appear to have been more on the basis of a conviction in the Bab's divine
inspiration and an acceptance of his claim rather than out of enthusiasm for a programme for social reform or
by way of social protest. The majority of Babis tended to this religious element, and this includes the most
important leaders of the Babis and, of course, the Bab himself. Even the armed conflicts which occurred at
Shaykh Tabarsi, Nayriz, and Zanjan would seem to be considered by the Babis who participated in them
either as the necessary concomitant of the advent of the Mahdi who would conquer the earth, or as measures
of self-defence against the attacks of their enemies, but only to a very minor extent as a means of bringing
bout political or social reform.

There were a few persons, however, who joined the Babi movement as a means of overturning the existing
state of affairs and introducing a new social order. The author of the Nuqtatu'l-Kaf may have been one such
person with his reference to the renunciation of property and abolition of taxes as well as his abusive
references to the Qajars. Another such person was the Yazdi Lutigari leader, Muhammad `Abdu'llah, who had
been in revolt against the government for a number of years before adopting Babism. It would seem that this
minority revolutionary-reformist strain in Babism continued into the second half of the nineteenth century as
the Azali branch. Mirza Yahya, Subh-i-Azal, had himself been of a revolutionary turn of mind. He was
closely involved in the plot to assassinate Nasiru'd-Din Shah in 1852, and just before this plot was
implemented, he had left for his native Takur in Mazandaran to organise a simultaneous Babi uprising in that
region. The Azalis were later to produce such notable reformists and constitutionalist figures as Shaykh
Ahmad Ruhi, Mirza Aqa Khan Kirmani, and Mirza Yahya Dawlatabadi. There was a tendency in the Azali
branch to become further and further removed from religious matters and such figures as Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi
and Mirza Aqa Khan Kirmani were openly atheistic in their later writings.

The majority of Babis, who as we have noted were mainly concerned with religious matters, went on in
later years to become followers of Mirza Husayn `Ali, Baha'u'llah. Baha'u'llah himself was much opposed to
violence and armed conflict as a means of advancing the new religion. One of his first acts when assuming
leadership of the movement was to forbid the taking of life by his followers under any circumstances; he was
later to forbid jihad. The fact that the Babis under Baha'u'llah were quite content to lay aside their weapons
and no further uprising occurred despite the growth of the movement, is a further indication that the majority
of the Babis were not motivated by considerations of revolt or social reform. The Baha'i branch became
increasingly removed from political activity and more concerned with religious issues.

22\. Nabil's Narrative, based on the accounts of five survivors; and the Tarikh-i-Mimiyya by Siyyid Husayn Zavari'i, Mahjur, based on

the accounts of three survivors.
23\. M. A. Malik-Khusravi-Nuri, Tarikh-i-Shuhaday-i-Amr, 3 vols. (Tihran, 130 B.E./ 1973). For list of sources relating to Shaykh

24\. I have compared Mahjur's list in three sources: Fadil Mazandarani, Zuhuru'l-Haqq, vol. 3 (n.p., n.d.), p. 124n; manuscript (F28,

> Browne Collection, Cambridge University Library), p. 18; manuscript used by Malik-Khusravi, p. 18. There are no discrepancies in

> sources.

All three: sources occasionally misspell names, e.g., Siyami for Miyami, Rumi for Urumi, etc.
25\. Browne gives this name wrongly as Bahmiz, owing to a simple transposition of a dot. See Tarikh-i-Jadid, p. 67 and note, p. 364;

and Nuqtatul-Kaf, p. 191.
26\. Browne gives these two names wrongly as Shah-Mirza and- Dasak-sar. See Tarikh-i-Jadid, p. 104, and note I (which indicates

how the mistake was made).

29\. Tihran (130 B.E./ 1973).
30\. I am assuming that the history of Nayriz listed as an anonymous work by Nicolas (Seyyed Ali Mohammed. p. 51) is by Mirza

Shafi` on account of the great similarity between Nabil's and Nicolas' version of events in the first Nayriz upheaval.
