> In its restricted domain, minimalism stands for an epistemological system in which, on one side, it is in agreement with many of the principles of scientific objectivism. Minimalism accepts the objective reality outside human perception. It values the instrumentality of the human intellect as the principal tool of discovering such realities. Like science, minimalism is firmly based on modern logic, linear procession, clarity of statements, precision, probability, and other commonly utilized scientific methodology. However, it tends to go beyond the reductionism of scientific objectivity to favorably adopt some of the subjectivist views in epistemology. For example, it distinguishes between irrational and trans-rational. Minimalism accepts the objective existence of non-observables that are absolutely necessary to explain the observables.

> Traditionally, the application of rigorous logical methods had been considered appropriate only in the domain of theoretical and applied mathematics, experimental sciences, and artificial intelligence. Minimalism makes a heroic effort to argue the feasibility of applying the principles of such formal methods when studying religious, metaphysical, and ethical issues as well. At the same time, minimalism tries to avoid being entrapped in the limits of total objectification. It acknowledges the validity of other modes of investigation such as trans-rational intuition, meditation, and revelation not only in the ontological domains but as acceptable methods in mathematical and scientific endeavors.  
>   
> Since the Bahá’í Faith argues in favor of the validity of adopting a perspective in which reality is a unified whole rather than a fragmented entity, utilizing the basic tenets of minimalism is of particular interest in giving the Bahá’í epistemological system a more formal appearance. An effort will be made to explore such possibilities when discussing the parallel views between the two systems.

There is a general consensus that the foundations of what is
called “modern philosophy” were laid in the middle of the 17th
Century      by   Rene     Descartes,    the    famed    French
philosopher/mathematician. He emphasized the authority of
human rational power as the basic tool used to discover truth.
The much repeated motto of “I think therefore I am” sums up
his stance on the instrumentality of the human consciousness
in any ontological paradigm. Contrary to the Platonic
approach that starts from “reality as an abstract ideal trans-
human, inaccessible phenomenon whose shadows we just
resemble,” Descartes’ approach was from the bottom up. He
starts with the fundamental reality of human intellect as a
priori and logically deduces the possibility of an abstract ideal
reality beyond the human realm.

Following in Descartes’ footsteps, Newton and Leibniz
radically transformed the Platonic paradigm of a world full of
allegories and mystical meanings to a cold, logical, scientific
world, functioning solely on immutable cause-and-effect
relations. The natural laws underlying such a precise system
require the human intellect to discover the mysteries of this
world by painstaking examination of the evidences at hand.
The ensuing unrivaled successes of physical sciences and
technology proved the validity of rationalism as a dominant
school of philosophy for almost two centuries. This revolution
*

When dealing with “minimalism” and “maximalism,” this article has
liberally used the main ideas expounded by William Hatcher in
Minimalism: A Bridge between Classical Philosophy and the Bahá’í
Revelation .

310                            Minimalism from a Bahá’í Perspective

in the prevailing philosophical mind-set had enormous
consequences throughout the world within one generation.
Rationalism along with its offshoots such as Logical
Positivism,     scientific   positivism,   materialism,    and
reductionism gained a total ascendancy in many areas of
human intellectual, political, social, and academic endeavor.
There was a shift in the previously held romantic view of the
world. The entire cosmos was not circumambulating our
planet in reverential adoration anymore; the earth was reduced
to a speck of dust in the much larger, utterly predictable
scheme of things. The nightingale did not warble as a token of
its love for the beauty of the rose, but only to obey a preset
reproductive urge. The universe lost its poetry and a
mechanistic coldness settled in.

The new scientific picture of the world upheld the following,
seemingly indisputable axioms:
1\. This world is based on an elegant intelligible design that

behaves according to unchangeable laws.
2\. These laws can be discovered by human mind/rational

ability.
3\. The chain of cause and effect is at the heart of the reality

of all phenomena
4\. Scientific methodology and modern logic are the only

valid tools of discovery.
5\. Reducing complex phenomena to its simpler parts and

> analyzing the simpler parts will yield the knowledge of the
> more complex supersets (reductionism).
6\. Objectification is the only way to obtain any valid

knowledge of reality (positive objectivism).
7\. The ultimate cause of anything material is necessarily

material (materialism).
8\. Whatever is not rational (explained in the language of

> mathematics, logic, objectivism) is necessarily irrational
> (emotions, human creativity, mysticism, religion,
> spirituality) and tacitly of lesser value.
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                311

9\. The proper language to describe reality is linear very

> exact in nature, avoiding double or multi meanings, and
> totally communicable.
10\. Verification through a constant process of fine-tuning

> the theory against the evidences obtained from empirical
> analysis is the only way to gain a more exact knowledge
> of reality.
For the first time in the history of revealed religions, the
Bahá’í sacred writings explicitly discussed the singular role of
human rationality in discovering the mysteries of the world. In
the words of Abdu’l-Bahá, “God’s greatest gift to man is that
of intellect, or understanding. The understanding is the power
by which man acquires his knowledge of the several kingdoms of
creation, and of various stages of existence, as well as much
which is invisible.”1 Or, again in another statement: “God has
endowed man with intelligence and reason whereby he is
required to determine the verity of questions and
propositions. ”2 In addition to such explicit praise for
humanity’s rational faculties, both Bahá’u’lláh and Abdu’l-
Bahá also pointed out the inadequacy of human rational ability
as the only reliable means through which to discover all the
possible facets of the relationships within and amongst
phenomena. In the late 19th century they called for a
reconsideration of some of the basic axioms tacit in
rationalistic/mechanistic systems. As an alternative, they
offered other possible epistemological tools for revealing the
mysteries of this world.

For example, in Some Answered Questions Abdu’l-Bahá
expounds on at least four different modes of knowledge:
knowledge through sense perception3, reason and logic,
tradition or scriptural authority, and the medium of
inspiration. Each of these modes may be applied to a greater or
lesser degree. It is only when they act in a complementary
fashion and act in harmony that one has hopes to approach a
more reliable version of knowledge. However, as was expected,
many multitudes remained oblivious to such an invitation. It
took science itself to point out its own inadequacies.

In the beginning of the 20th century the first jolt to the
previously unchallenged authority of scientific method came

312                           Minimalism from a Bahá’í Perspective

from Heisenberg, the most prominent German physicist of the
time. His “indeterminacy” or “uncertainty” principle wreaked
havoc not only in scientific circles but also in wider
philosophical domains. Heisenberg’s principle states that, “no
complete and exact description of physical reality is logically
possible within the framework of the Hilbert Space of quantum
mechanics.”4 In particular, this principle showed that it is
impossible to simultaneously determine the position and the
momentum of an electron.

The next and even stronger blow to conventional scientific
processes was landed by the famed logician of the early 20th
century, Kurt Gödel. In his famous Incompleteness Theorem,
he proved, without a doubt, “that any system by necessity will
contain true propositions that cannot be proven within the
system.”5 In another words, there cannot exist any complete
(meaning dealing with the totality of a system) and at the same
time exact (being able to prove all its propositions) description
of reality.

This jolt to the rationalistic view of the world caused a
whole host of new philosophical systems to gain strength
forming a united front to oppose what they called the “tyranny
of science.” Armed with the weapon provided for them by
science itself, schools such as relativism, total relativism,
subjectivism, solipsism, existentialism, post modernism,
deconstructionism, and the like announced the end of the
supremacy of human rational faculties as the dominant force
for gaining knowledge. Although covering a vast arena of
human enterprises, proponents of such schools generally agree
with the following underlying premises:6
1\. There is a general sense of mistrust towards the use of

> rational/logical/scientific methods to gain knowledge.
> Science is just another (white man’s) cultural bias on par
> with magic, shamanism, or voodooism.
2\. The individual’s perception of reality is the only and the

ultimate source of authority (solipsism).
3\. All cultures and cultural products should enjoy the status

> of equal validity, with no inherent merit accorded to any
> of them.
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                 313

4\. All moral values and codes of conduct are basically

> products of human culture and, therefore, equally
> justifiable.
5\. All epistemological approaches, including intuition,

> revelation, mysticism, and the like are equally valid in
> forming a perception of reality.
6\. Objectivity is a myth and only trivial matters can be

> objectified. Whatever is significant remains forever
> subjective.
7\. There is no absolute authority save the authority of the

self.
8\. There is nothing meritorious about using logical and or

> mathematical languages. Using a poetic/non-linear
> language with multiple meanings is encouraged.
9\. Inter-subjective communication is not probable.

> Therefore, one’s perception of reality remains forever
> inaccessible to others and inherently resistant to reliable
> communication.

Throughout the past several decades, constant clashes
between the two camps were not only limited to the academic
and philosophical circles, but the impacts were reverberating in
all of human endeavor from art and music to theatre and
cinema; from child-rearing practices to interpersonal
relationships; from policy making at the local level to the
practices of international relations. Most of the absolute
values had lost their meaning and the individual’s
interpretations turned into the ultimate authority. Nothing
was a question of merit any longer, but was reduced to the
question of mere difference.

Wha t is M inima lis m?

In such chaotic circumstances, foreseen by Bahá’u’lláh and
Abdu’l-Bahá a century earlier, a newly emerging school of
philosophy is gaining ground. Minimalism is a new alternative
based on the supremacy of the human rational mind but at the
same time relying on pragmatic approaches. While it tries to

314                            Minimalism from a Bahá’í Perspective

avoid the dogmatism of positivism/objectivism, it is mindful
of the pitfalls of subjectivism and the authority of the self. Dr.
William Hatcher terms his method “minimalism” because it
“results from consistently making the most plausible and
rational choice in the light of current knowledge”7 but goes no
farther than is necessary.

Minimalism takes the stance that the fundamental goal of
any philosophical system must be truth-seeking and not
persuasion and/or continual debates amongst competing
schools of thought. It is unproductive and unnecessary to put
much emphasis on constant arguments between and amongst
extreme points of view. Instead, the main objective must be to
find the tools and tirelessly refine them to approach the truth.
In many respects, minimalism offers an epistemological system
congruent with the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith. The following
will be an attempt to draw a parallel view comparing the basic
epistemological principles of minimalism and the Bahá’í Faith.
M et a physi c s

In its metaphysical stance, facing the question of “existence”
versus “non-existence,” minimalism is based on the axiom that
“something does exist.” Therefore, existence itself is not an
illusion but a reality independent of the observer. Therefore,
the “out-there-ness” of reality is not under dispute. However,
the observer’s perception of reality may very well be illusory.
Also, it takes “being as basic and sees process as a succession
of states, a state being defined as a (time-bound) existent at a
given instant of time.”8

The stance of the Bahá’í Faith also testifies to the reality of
existence.
E pi st em ology

The main axiom explicitly clarified in minimalism is the law
of “cause-and-effect” as a universal umbrella encompassing the
emergence of all phenomena. Similarly, in the words of
Bahá’u’lláh: “All that is created, however, is preceded by a
cause. ”9 What distinguishes it from materialism, however, is
that minimalism does not adhere to the axiom that the root
cause of all material phenomena is necessarily material. It leaves

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                  315

the possibility for non-material causes open and subject to
investigation. In general agreement with this position Abdu’l-
Bahá confirms: “Thus such a chain of causation must of
necessity lead eventually to him who is the ever-living, the All-
powerful, who is self-dependent and the Ultimate Cause.”10

Methodologically, minimalism relies heavily both on the
traditional syllogistic system of Aristotle and, even more so,
on the modern relational logic developed over the past two
centuries. Without going much into the details of the
relational logic, it may suffice it to say that this new system is
closely connected to the mathematical set theory (dealing with
the concepts of supersets, sets, subsets, and their boundaries).
Relational logic is key to developing new techniques to expand
our ability to derive new logical conclusions (both inductive
and deductive) from a given statement. In this regard,
minimalism is closely associated with the bases underlying new
mathematics/logic and artificial intelligence experiments.

In fact Abdu’l-Bahá constructed numerous arguments using
relational logic as a tool to prove His point. A prominent
example of such an argument can be found in His Tablet to Dr.
Forel. In this Tablet Abdu’l-Bahá shows that a subset (human
being) cannot possibly possess a quality whose superset (the
nature) is bereft of.

> Should any one suppose that man is but a part of the
> world of nature, and he being endowed with these
> perfections, these being but manifestations of the
> world of nature, and thus nature is the originator of
> these perfections and is not deprived therefrom, to him
> we make reply and say: the part dependeth upon the
> whole; the part cannot possess perfections whereof the
> whole is deprived. 11

He uses a similar set of arguments to also prove the reality of
divinity, spiritual realms, and other unobservable phenomena.
Scope

Minimalism considers Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem as
its guiding light and accepts the fact that no system is possibly
able to cover the whole of reality and at the same time be exact

316                             Minimalism from a Bahá’í Perspective

enough to verify all of its true propositions. In fact, exactness
and completeness will occur at the expense of one another. A
desire to increase exactness will necessarily yield a decrease in
the scope of our knowledge of reality. Therefore, it
acknowledges the fact that, at any given time, the system is
only involved with a part, and not the entirety of reality.

The limit of the comprehensive ability of the human mind is
at the core of the Bahá’í epistemology as well. Bahá’u’lláh, time
and again, warns humanity against “vain imaginings, ” a
constant battle between reality and perception. This inherent
limitation in the scope of human knowledge is also confirmed
by Abdu’l-Bahá when He states “For whatsoever can be
conceived by man is reality that hath limitations and is not
unlimited; it is circumscribed, not all-embracing. It can be
comprehended by man, and is controlled. ”12
Objectification of Reality

To avoid the reductionist nature of absolute objectivism,
“minimalism accepts the objective existence of only those non-
observable phenomena that are strictly necessary” in order to
give a satisfactory explanation for observable phenomena. One
should notice that “strict necessity” is of utmost importance
in such an explanation. It is only as a last resort if and only if
the assumptions of such non-observables conform in
accordance with, and not contrary to, the other logical
components of the argument at hand, that their objective
existence will be assumed. Therefore, whatever can be
objectified must be objectified. This objectification of a large
segment of the human quest for knowledge is both desirable and
helpful. At the same time, minimalism is mindful of the
restrictions of total objectivism and acknowledges the fact
that the totality of human knowledge cannot be objectified.
Objectification in minimalism is a very strong tool for truth-
seeking but never the only one, or worse, an end in itself.

> understanding, of thought, of memory, of imagination
> and of discernment; all these inner faculties are unseen
> of the eye and cannot be sensed, yet all are evident by
> the effects they produce. 13

Object/Subject relationship

Minimalism pays special attention to the continual battle
between the object-based epistemology of positivism (holding
the stance that reliable knowledge can only be obtained if the
objectivity/neutrality of the observer/subject is guaranteed)
on one hand, and the subject-based paradigm of the
subjectivist school (which cries out that neutrality/objectivism
is only a myth and there is no reality but what the
subject/observer perceives) on the other hand. Abdu’l-Bahá is
also well aware of the philosophical dichotomy between the
object and subject. He clarifies His stance when He says: “… It
is certain that all human conceptions are contingent, not
absolute; that they have a mental existence, not a material
one. ”14 Minimalism explicitly acknowledges the fact that total
neutrality of the observer is not an achievable goal. It is the
“viewpoint explicitness” and not the “viewpoint neutrality”
that leads to a more reliable path to approaching reality.
Therefore, what it stresses is a system in which there is a
constant and a sincere effort to explicitly spell out all the
assumptions, axioms, and viewpoints in advance, for the sake
of both the reader and potential critics.

The knowledge obtained in this way will be examined and re-
examined against newly confronted evidences. When the
current evidences at hand imply a host of possible
theories/explanations, only the most plausible ones will be
selected. As we can see, the truth-seeking methodology of
minimalism is a dynamic, pragmatic and ever fine-tuning
dialogue between the observer and reality. It allows itself to
constantly revise and modify what it has achieved. It is through
conscious and careful effort that there will emerge an ever
increasing hope of closing the gap between perception and
reality. So, whoever is on the path of a truth-seeking endeavor
must try to remain open-minded in an open-ended process.
Although an absolute level of viewpoint explicitness is not

possible, minimalism hopes to achieve gradual and exceedingly
refined versions of human knowledge. Therefore, although the
end result is not known (the truth is not a priori) such
refinement is similar to the concept of finding the limit of
series or sequences in mathematics. The limit (if it exists) can
be obtained by rigorously applying refining techniques.

Going one step further however, minimalism considers a
rather larger domain of applicability for rigorous and formal
methods and language not only in their traditional roles in
mathematical/computers/scientific investigations but also in
seldom explored spheres of philosophy, religion, and
humanities. By appropriately using the tools of modern logic
and considering the most probable alternative, it introduces an
approach within which one can search for the validity of both
material and trans-material knowledge. In like manner, on
numerous occasions in the Bahá’í writings there is a constant
invitation to apply one’s rational ability to explore various
meanings of sacred text. In fact a good portion of treatise,
tablets, and talks (including Some Answered Questions) given
by Abdu’l-Bahá are excellent examples of implementing formal
logic to prove a point.
Rationalism vs. other modes of knowledge

Minimalism greatly values the rational faculty as the key to
unraveling encountered mysteries, both material and trans-
material. In fact, its reliance on the usage of formal logic,
relational logic, and the process of verification as a means to
refine human knowledge, and consequently modifying our
views based on examining the newly emerged evidences, all
testify to how crucial a role human’s rational mind plays in
achieving a better understanding of what reality is. However, it
tries to avoid the dichotomy of the hard-line rationalistic view
between rationality and irrationality.

It opens up a window to a third alternative, namely, “trans-
rationality.” According to minimalism, some levels of
knowledge that are gained through other modes of exploration
may not necessarily be irrational but trans-rational. Of course,
one condition remains intact, that is, the knowledge gathered
in such a way ought not to contradict reason, but may

complement it. In this fashion, minimalism leaves room for
modes such as intuition, mystical experience, divine
inspiration, prayers and meditations complementing the
rational faculty where rigorous, formal, investigative methods
may remain inadequate. Abdu’l-Bahá in Some Answered
Questions, offers a thorough discussion of the validity of all
these different modes of knowledge including sense perception,
reason and logic, tradition or scriptural authority, and the
medium of inspiration. He also emphasizes that all these modes
must be in harmony and act in a complementary fashion.
Minimalism vs. Maximalism

Maximalism refers to an ensemble of schools of thought on
the opposite side of the spectrum from minimalism. In
comparing the two systems, some of the major distinctive
tenets of both will emerge even more pronouncedly:15
1\. Contrary to minimalism, maximalism starts with a text

> in which the Truth itself is a priori and the meaning of
> the text a posteriori (i.e., the meaning of the statements
> may not be immediately accessible or even unique).
2\. The language of maximalism is non-linear, poetic, multi-

> layered, allegorical, and ultimately contains multi-
> meanings, welcoming a variety of interpretations.
3\. Maximalism gives free rein to refer to trans-material,

non-observable, and imaginary phenomena.
4\. The scope of maximalism is the totality of reality with

> little or no attention paid to the issue of exactness. It
> offers an all-encompassing paradigm (a mega-narrative)
> in which “completeness” is favored at the expense of
> exactness.
5\. To unravel the meanings veiled in the poetry of language,

> the tools of scientific verification will seldom be
> sufficient, or necessary. Here all modes of knowledge
> may have to band together in order to explore fresh
> meaning for each statement.

6\. Divine revelations are perfect examples of maximalism in

> which there is an abundant use of metaphor, non-linear
> language and unobservable phenomena.

In summary, what makes minimalism singularly useful is its
fresh look at new applications of the language of modern logic
and mathematics as a key to open so far unproven or
unexplored realities. For example, Dr. Hatcher utilizes the very
same tool to demonstrate how the existence of God/Divinity
may be proved in a totally logical way. 16 It is true that to be
able to follow his lines of argument there is a need for a prior
knowledge of basic levels of modern logic, but by exerting some
mental effort it is quite possible to trace the gist of his
argument. This fine example makes us understand how modern
logic combined with the “most plausible scenario” may lead one
to more solid ground for exploration of non-observable
realities that had previously kept their distance from such
verifications. In this regard, in addition to stressing the value
of logic/rationality, minimalism welcomes the contribution of
other modes of knowledge in exploring different aspects of
reality (provided they do not contradict logic).

When comparing the two, there is a natural affinity between
the epistemological stance of the Bahá’í Faith and minimalism.
Even so, one has to bear in mind that Bahá’u’lláh reveals a
“complete” paradigm, a mega-narrative, while minimalism, by
nature, tries to take the side of “exactness,” accepting the
limitations it imposes on the system. The Faith, however, not
only does not preclude, but actively encourages a rational
investigation of the tenets of one’s belief system. There are
abundant references to “deliberation,” “reflection,” “thought,”
“contemplation,” “reasoning,” and the like, when one wrestles
with layers of meanings in a sacred passage. The “pearls of
wisdom” preserved in the “depth of the Ocean of His
Revelation” summon the seekers to “delve deep” to reach the
“hidden treasures” therein. Therefore, on the one hand, the
truth of a divine revelation is a priori, given in a top-down
fashion in language rich in allegory, poetry, layers, metaphors
and maximalist in nature. The “Creative Word” is an ever-
generating source of hidden meanings that invite the soul and
the mind to a feast of discovery by utilizing different

(including trans-rational) modes of knowledge, that are not
contradictory to logical/rational conclusions.

Dr. Hatcher gives a parallel view of the essential elements
underlying the two systems:

> The study of science consists in confronting or
> experience of the phenomena of reality, formulating
> certain propositions whose meaning is a priori clear
> and applying appropriate verification procedures to
> determine the truth or falsity of these propositions.
> We call this whole process verification. Studying the
> revelation consists in confronting various portions of
> the text of revelation, focusing on certain statements
> whose truth is known a priori and then striving to
> determine various linear meanings of these statements.
> We will give the name explication to this process. Thus,
> for science, clarity of meaning is given a priori but
> truth is determined a posteriori. For revealed religion,
> truth is given a priori, but meaning is determined a
> posteriori. 17
What is at the heart of his argument is that the two
paradigms need not stay in adversarial positions, but can
cooperate in a wholly complementary fashion. The process of
“verification” can be applied in exploring, clarifying, refining,
and improving our understanding of the divine revelation.
Also, the creative word of the divine revelation may set the tone
for the formulation of original perspectives, hypotheses, and
theories. Such a continuous dialogue between the two
complementary systems will assure an ever-improving
experience when confronting the puzzling mysteries of both the
observable and the non-observable.
