The Authority of the Feminine and Fatima's Place in an
Early Work by the Bab1
Dr. Todd Lawson2
Toronto, Canada, University of Toronto, Institute of Islamic Studies

The power and authority of the millennial or apocalyptic imagination is
fully evident in the success of the Babi movement of nineteenth-century
Iran. Among the most striking and memorable features of Babism is surely
the prominence, prestige, and religious authority acquired by the woman
disciple of the Bab known as Tahirih. The famous Babi cleric, poet, martyr,
and symbol of Iran's encounter with both its own history and the version of
modernity proffered by the West is possibly more noted by posterity than
the founder of the Babi movement himself because she represents both an
apparent anomaly and a heroic symbol of modern female liberation. Tahirih
after all left an unhappy marriage and her children to follow her
revolutionary vision for a more just society. She was accomplished in a
virtually completely male dominated milieu, the clerical. She traveled
widely throughout Iran preaching to audiences of men and women the dawn
of a new day, and most dramatically, she threw off her veil in public in
direct defiance of social and religious norms. She was also a martyr. After
the attempt on the life of the shah in 1851, Tahirih was strangled by her own
silk scarf and buried in a well in the courtyard of a religious official in
Tehran.

However much the story of Tahirih is appreciated by modern and
contemporary feminists and suffragists, it is important to recognize that
while her heroism may have inspired many in far-flung salons of Europe
and eventually America, she is very much a daughter of her own culture,
history, mythology, and religion. This assertion will perhaps be received
with cynicism, for how could such a paternalistic and male-dominated
religion and culture as Iranian Islam of the first half of the nineteenth
century produce such a woman celebrity and champion of women's rights?
Indeed, it has never been established that Tahirih was a champion of
women's rights3. What we know is that she was a deeply religious mystic
who felt a new day arising in the world. She was a messianic player. But it
was not accidental that she was a woman, and it is not without consequence
for the history of the Babi movement, which though it passed from the stage
of history more or less a failure, it nonetheless gave rise to several other
trends and movements in Iran whose influence may still be felt. Tahirih the

Babi walked, it seems, right out of the poems, songs, and higher forms of
religiocultural literature as the return of Fatima. It was a sacred
performance.

Tahirih, whose full name was Fatima Zarrin Taj Baraghani, Qurrat al-'Ayn,
was seen by a large number of her fellow Babis as the "return," or
reincarnation, of Fatima, the daughter of the prophet Muhammad and wife
of the first Imam, 'Ali. Whether this exemplifies reincarnation or
transmigration remains to be addressed. It is indisputable, however, that
Baraghani was seen by the Babis (and perhaps herself) as the personification
of those virtues and attributes that Fatima had come to symbolize for the
Iranian Shi'i community. At the most superficial level, her name was Fatima
and her cognomen Tahirih was first applied to her holy ancestor, as was the
other name by which she is so widely known, Qurratu'l-'Ayn, "Solace of the
eyes." As an antitype of the Fatima known and venerated by nineteenth-
century Iranian Muslims, she may be expected to be rather distinctive. The
Fatima of the Bab's Qur'an commentary is particularly useful as a function
of many different factors: she is a bearer of religious authority (walaya: see
the discussion that follows for a further elaboration of the meaning of this
term); she is a focus of religious devotion and meditation, an icon, as it
were, without which the spiritual and religious life may be considered
incomplete; she is seen as the embodiment of the spiritual reality of the
earth itself, a cosmogonic principle, and at the same time a recurrent actor in
a historical drama that will lead ultimately to the long-awaited Day of
Resurrection. An examination of the Fatima in this commentary, written
before the actual formation or founding of the Babi movement, will help us
to understand how many of the Bab's contemporaries saw Tahirih (i.e., the
nineteenth-century religious scholar and poet) and, perhaps most important,
how Tahirih saw herself. On this latter question, Abbas Amanat has offered
the following interesting suggestion:

> Frustrations in her family life and persecutions in her Babi career
> both served as impetuses for inspirations that she transposed into a
> religious paradigm; what she terms "the state of primal truth." By
> assuming the symbolic role of Fatima, she envisaged a feminine
> model – a "primal truth," as she called it – that substantially differed
> from the role assigned to Fatima in the Islamic, more particularly
> Shi'ite, tradition as the daughter of the Prophet, the wife of 'Ali, and
> the mother of Hasan and Husayn; the role that guaranteed her
> sanctitude (sic) by lineage, marriage, and motherly love. Qurrat al-
> 'Ayn's Fatima was one of independent will and action. The leadership
> she assumed in the 'Atabat and later at Badasht was the realization of
> this paradigm.... The only solution she saw, for women and men
> alike, was a break with the past, and as the first step, a deliberate

> acknowledgment of her equal place with men in the first unit of the
> ideal Babi order of All-Beings.4

This study suggests that it was not so much a break with the past – that is,
the past as "primal truth" – as the revivifying of it that is really at work in
the rise of the Babi movement and perhaps its most famous proponent, the
woman Tahirih. Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad and wife of
'Ali was, according to tradition, something of an activist, such as it could be
expressed within the confines of seventh-century Arabia. And it seems clear
that tradition honors Fatima for her heroism, a brief outline of which is
offered below. In the introduction to his Persian Bayan, written after 1848,
the Bab specifies that his first followers, the eighteen Letters of the Living,
are the return of the Fourteen Immaculate Ones, the Family of God plus the
historical four emissaries of the disappeared twelfth Imam, Muhammad ibn
Hasan al-`Askari (disappeared in 873-74) who successively represented the
highest authority in the Shi'i world from that time until 949-50.5 Thus
Tahirih not only "assumed the role" of Fatima. She was Fatima.

In the course of this article I also demonstrate that the Bab did not invent
such doctrines out of whole cloth, but rather his ideas are, in the main,
consonant with the general position of Fatima in Shi`i religiosity, piety, and
mysticism. Most important is Fatima's recognized status as an equal bearer
of religious authority (walaya) along with the Imams and Muhammad the
prophet.6 In order to demonstrate more fully how someone like Tahirih
could acquire the prestige and power she undoubtedly had within her milieu,
I delineate the main features of the doctrine of walaya as it had developed
within Ithna 'Ashari Shi'ism by the first half of the nineteenth century.

Walaya

In the course of this examination of the religious authority of Fatima, I
clarify that however much the eventual course of the Babi movement was at
odds with the religious status quo of mid-nineteenth-century Iran, at its core
was a cluster of beliefs shared in common with orthodox Shi'i Islam. The
heart of all Shi'ism centers on the strong veneration of the first Imam, 'Ali

ibn Abi Talib (d. 661) (and his wife and the Prophet's daughter, Fatima) as
the guardian, protector, and true friend of those who have acknowledged his
station as the immediate successor of the Prophet Muhammad. For this
reason he is known as wall, and the quality of his authority is called walaya,
frequently (and inadequately) rendered "sainthood."7 There is in Shi'ism no
notion more fundamental than this. It will be seen, perhaps not surprisingly,
that the idea was just as central to the Bab's thought, as it is to Shi'ism in
general. Also, it will be seen that belief or faith (iman) is conditioned by the
degree to which one accepts and testifies to the walaya of the so-called
Family of God (al Allah).8 This family consists of the Prophet Muhammad,
'Ali, and Fatima, and the eleven other Imams. No deed, no matter how
meritorious, is acceptable unless it has been performed by one who has fully
confessed the truth of this walaya as borne by the Family of God. Moreover,
such walaya has existed from eternity, much like the so-called
"Muhammadan light" and numbers among those who have recognized it the
prophets Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. As an eternal principle, it remains an
imperative for all would-be believers at all times: through acceptance or
rejection of this spiritual authority, one determines the fate of one's soul.

Walaya is implicated in the fourth of five pillars of belief of traditional Ithna
'Ashari Shi'ism, which are (1) Divine Unity (tawhid), (2) Prophethood
(nubuwwa), (3) the Resurrection/Return (ma‟ad), (4) the Imamate (imama),
and (5) Divine Justice (`adl). In Shi'ism prophetic authority ended with the
death of Muhammad (632), but the Prophet is understood as having two
types of mutually complementing authority: the one, connected with the
office of prophethood (nubuwwa); the other, in some ways a more general,
yet at the same time purer (and therefore higher) type of authority connected
with the office of guardianship (walaya). This teaching is based on the
Qur'an, where the noun wall occurs in several important contexts. Most
important for this discussion are all those Qur'anic verses that describe God
as the wall of the believers9 or the single verse that says that walaya belongs
to God alone (18:44). The general meaning of wall in these instances is
"protector," "friend," and "guardian." By extension, and in the context of the
most urgent doctrinal need of the Shi'i community, namely to explain the
system of distinctive leadership which it developed, walaya came to mean
"religious authority": believers are bound to obey what God, their best
friend and guardian, ordains. The "Family of God," to use the Bab's
distinctive terminology, are the only conduits of this divine protective
friendship, particularly in the context of the earliest struggles for leadership

This word is sometimes voweled as wilaya and frequently nice distinctions are made between the two
spellings in which walaya refers to spiritual authority and wilaya refers to political authority. Linguistically and
etymologically there is no basis for this distinction. One important Shi'i lexicon states that the voweling is optional
and the word connotes both political/temporal and spiritual power. A. Isfahani, Tafsir Mir' at al-Anwar wa
Mishkat al-Asrar ,Tehran: Chapkhaneh Aftab, 1874/1954, 337-38).

I prefer "Family of God" as a translation for this term to "clan of God" found throughout Amanat,
because of the obvious differences in connotation and denotation it carries: nearness, intimacy, and familiarity.
These persons are seen as the Holy Family in Shi'ism, not the Holy Clan.

E.g., Qur'an 2:107; 2:160; 2:257; 3:68; 6:51; 6:70; 9:112; 13:37; 18:26; 29:22; 32:4; 42:8; 42:9;

within the Islamic community where one could make the error of choosing
the wrong "protecting friend" as a leader. Shi'ism says that this is precisely
what happened to those Muslims who chose Abu Bakr and the other two
early caliphs as leaders.10 While prophethood is in some sense superior to
guardianship because only a prophet receives revelation through direct
inspiration (wahy) and the task of a prophet is to establish a code of law
(shari'a), walaya is essential because only through this office or institution
can true religious authority be continued beyond the death of the prophet.
Furthermore, it is thought to be superior to nubuwwa because unlike that
institution, it is related directly to God. God is frequently called a wali in the
Qur'an, but never a nabi. In this way walaya is seen to be a divine attribute
certainly shared by all prophets, with nubuwwa representing in some ways a
subfunction of walaya. Postprophetic guardians (awliya') do not have
nubuwwa; it is only by virtue of their walaya that they have authority in the
community to interpret (never reveal) scripture. But their interpretation has
the authority of revelation.

Another complementary meaning of the term walaya is kinship, closeness,
allegiance and, in some ways, intimacy. A bearer of walaya is thus seen to
enjoy an especially close relationship to, in this case, God. This feature of
the word has lent it so well to all those contexts in the Islamic tradition
which have to do with sanctity and saintship.11 To take a recent example, it
was on the basis of these factors that Ayatollah Khomeini (d. 1989)
formulated the influential and politically astute doctrine known as "The
Guardianship of the Jurist" (Vilayat-i faqih), through which he demonstrated
to the satisfaction of his numerous followers that the decisions and opinions
of the godly jurist are guided by the unerring (ma `sum) hand of the Hidden
Imam and would therefore be identical with His teaching. Furthermore,
these rulings and opinions would somehow represent the very presence of
God and the Hidden Imam, a figure with almost ineffable sacral and
charismatic authority and power. Earlier examples of the usage have been
recently singled out as possibly the most important factor at play in the
spiritual authority of the Sufi shaykh or pir from very earliest times in
Islam.12 It is something of a truism that the Shi'i Imam is the analogue of
the Sufi shaykh (or vice versa). One reason is that the basic understanding
and function of the term walaya seems to be fairly constant across the
borders that otherwise separate the two. The point is that concern with
walaya means concern with power and authority. In the early work by the
Bab, there is a great deal of concern with walaya. In this study we are
interested mainly in the walaya and spiritual authority of Fatima. It is with
an enhanced appreciation of this topic that the remarkable life of Tahirih,

and the religious leadership of women, can be better understood within the
context of nineteenth-century Iran.

Usuli/Akhbari Debate

Before we turn directly to the writings of the Bab on this topic, it is
important to summarize, in very general terms, some of the pertinent
historical developments in Shi'i legal theory that serve as immediate
background to his career. By the time the Bab was writing, which was very
close to the time of the fulfillment of the Shi'i eschaton, a thousand years
having elapsed since the disappearance of the Twelfth/Hidden Imam,
Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-`Askari, a long-standing dispute among
religious scholars had been rumbling for a number of decades. This dispute
had to do precisely with the way religious authority (walaya) would be
expressed and recognized among the believers and is known as the
Akhbari/Usuli debate. Although the Usuli position eventually won the day,
it is important to know what was at stake. In one sense, this dispute can be
characterized as "reason vs. revelation." The Akhbari position was against
the institutionalization of "independent jurisprudence" (ijtihad), and the
Usuli position upheld it. At stake, then, was not only a more or less abstract
legal theory, but also the potentially powerful office of mujtahid,
independent legal scholar, whose findings in all aspects of religion would be
binding upon the believers. These findings were derived through resort to
so-called sources (usul: roots) by the legal thinker or jurisprudent (faqih):
(1) Qur'an, (2) Sunna, or (3) Qiyas/Analogy. The process whereby these
elements were employed to derive a solution for a legal problem is called
ijtihad- "independent intellectual exertion." The Akhbaris asserted that there
was only one legal authority, namely, the Hidden Imam, the bearer of
walaya for this time, and that in such a circumstance there was in effect only
one mujtahid whom the faithful were required to emulate and follow,
namely the Hidden Imam. Thus the Akhbari position threatened the social
standing of an elite group of highly qualified legal experts by asserting that
each believer was to work out their own "salvation" through contemplation
of the sources of religion: 1) the Qur'an and 2) the Sunna. The name Akhbari
comes from the word used to refer to the thousands of traditions – akhbar,
sing. khabar, sometimes called hadith – that preserve the Sunna of not only
the Prophet, but the other thirteen immaculate ones, the twelve Imams and
Fatima. The Akhbaris taught that each believer had direct access to the truth
through reading the Qur'an and this supplementary material. The Usuli
position was eventually to lead to the establishment of the important
institution known as marja `-i taqlid, "one who is to be [blindly] imitated in
matters of religion."13

On this topic see Kohlberg, Etan. "Abu Turab." Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies
1978, 347-52.;"From Imamiyya to Ithna-`Ashariyya." Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 39

Morgandlandischen Gesellschaft 1976, 126, 64-86.; Newman, Andrew Joseph III. The Development and Political

In the process of winning the battle, Usulis argued heavily against the kind
of mystical or intuitive communion with the Hidden Imam that made the
Akhbari position feasible. In so doing, they argued very persuasively for the
superiority of the rational faculty and the use of reason. One response to this
argument would come in the form of the teachings of Shaykh Ahmad al-
Ahsa'i (d. 1826) and his successor, Sayyid Kazim Rashti (d. 1843), who
throughout their works cautioned against the elimination of the mystical or
intuitional aspects of religion and argued, in compelling language, for an
epistemology composed of equal parts of reason and "revelation." The
Shaykhi position won many supporters precisely because it rescued, in a
reasonable manner, the mystical noetic so dear to the Persian soul.14 The
Bab's writings, especially the ones examined in this article, are perhaps an
equally strenuously (if differently) argued mysticism. As we will see, the
Bab's source of authority is the Qur'an and the Family of God and no one or
nothing else.15

The Bab's Writings

There has been a tendency to regard the Tafsir surat Yusuf as the first work
of any significance written by the Bab, but this is wrong. 16 The Tafsir surat
al-Baqara – a work that has been habitually ignored by persons writing on
the Babi religion – is really the Bab's first major religious work. It first
became known in the West through E. G. Browne, who discussed it and the
circumstances under which he received a copy, in an article written in
1892\.17 (It had been sent to him by Mirza Yahya Subh-i Azal, who had

Even as recently as 1989, we find the following statement on the date of the Tafsir surat Yusuf: “As
far as can be verified, up to this time [when he produced the Tafsir surat Yusuf] the Bab had not produced any

his talent for producing Qur'anic commentaries." Amanat, Resurrection, 172-73.Manuscript: Tafsir Surat Yusuf by

Edward , 637-710, "A Catalogue and Description of 27 Babi Manuscripts," Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society, 1892, 24, 493-99. Azal, like his half-brother Baha'u'llah, had been a follower of the Bab from the
early days. As a result of disagreements between himself and Baha'u'llah, he became the leader of the Azali faction
of the Babis. Browne received a great number of Babi manuscripts from him.In this article Browne quotes a
passage from the Tarikh-i Jadid which recounts the conversion of the young Shaykhi Mulla Husayn Bushru'i to
the cause of the Bab in May 1844. While Mulla Husayn was visiting the Bab in the latter's home, he discovered a
commentary on the Surat al-Baqara. Reading some of it, he was impressed by the merits of the work and asked
his host who its author was. The Bab said that he in fact had written the work. This story relates that Mulla Husayn
was puzzled by one of the passages in the work: "the explanation of the inmost of the inmost" (tafsir-i batin-i
batin). Mulla Husayn is reported to have said: This appeared to me to be an error, and I remarked, "Here it should

received it from a scribe in Tehran.) By virtue of the number of existing
manuscripts of this work that he enumerated, Denis MacEoin rekindled
interest in it as a valuable source for the history and doctrines of the Babi
movement.18 Through further research it has become clear that the Bab's
Tafsir surat al-Baqara enjoys a unique and heretofore unappreciated
significance for a study of the growth and development of the Babi religion.
MacEoin may have been correct when he suggested that it is much less
likely to have been corrupted by partisans of the later Baha'i/Azali dispute
because of its status as a preproclamation work.19 On the other hand, such
corruption may be a red herring, since a study of a number of manuscripts of
the later and much more famous and pivotal Tafsir surat Yusuf reveals very
little willful tampering with the text.20 But MacEoin is certainly correct in
his assertion that "since this tafsir is the only extended work of the Bab's
written before May 1844 [when he made his momentous claims public] and
still extant, it is indisputably of unique importance as a source of concrete
evidence for the development of his thought in the six months or so that led
up to the initial announcement of his prophetic claim."21 Insofar as this first
major work was also a tafsir, its interest goes beyond the confines of a study
of a specific heresy to engage with the greater Islamic tradition itself on the
common ground of the Qur'an.

Indeed, it is of some significance that this first major work by the Bab is a
commentary on the Surat al-Baqara, or Sura of the Cow (in actual fact, it is
a commentary on both the Surat al-Fatiha, the first sura and the Surat al-
Baqara, the second sura), a sura sometimes regarded by exegetes as "the
Qur'an in miniature" because in it are found many of the same concerns,

be 'the inmost,' and they have written 'the inmost of the inmost.'" "What can I say?" [the Bab] answered, "the
author of the Commentary lays claim to even more than this of greatness, glory, and knowledge. Consider the
passage attentively." I did so, and said, "It is quite correct. But I am wearied. Do you read and I will listen." He
read for a time, and then, as men are wont, I said, "It is enough. Do not trouble yourself further.". Browne,
Catalogue, 496-97. While this account is important for the history of the Tafsir Surat al-Baqara, it raises the
question of why Mulla Husayn should have been stopped by such an expression. The tafsir does in fact employ it,
although Browne was unable to locate it in his manuscript. It also seems logical to assume that Mulla Husayn
would have been quite conversant with such language. The writings of both Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kazim
contain many allusions not only to the batin al-batin, but also to the batin batin al-batin, Whir al-batin, and so
forth. The young Mulla may have wanted to say that this particular passage deals only with the batin and should
not therefore have been referred to as an explanation of the "inmost of the inmost." It may be that the passage was
left out of Browne's manuscript because it was thought to damage the credibility of the Bab. Or it could be an
apocryphal tale designed to present the Bab as more learned than Mulla Husayn. Tafsir surat al-baqara (ms.) by

ordinances, conceits, and images found throughout the book. A commentary
on this sura by any given author would therefore tend to reveal the way he
would approach the entire Qur'an. It may be, in fact, that the Bab had
intended to produce a commentary on the whole Qur'an at this time. He is
said to have later produced no less than nine complete commentaries on the
Qur'an during his incarceration in Azerbaijan.22 Why he would have
suspended such a project at this earlier date is open to speculation. We do
know, however, that it was shortly after the completion of the commentary
on the first part23 of the Qur'an that Mulla Husayn Bushru'i made his visit to
Shiraz, during which time the Babi movement may be said to have been
born. Such a dramatic occurrence might possibly have had the effect of
deflecting the Bab's attention from such a "merely literary" project to
concentrate on newer and more important developments. One of these
developments was the composition of another tafsir (the Qayyum al-Asma
or Tafsir surat Yusuf) of such a startlingly different nature from this earlier
work that the two might be thought to have been written by two different
authors, though in reality this is probably not the case.24

The radical interpretation of several passages in the Surat al-Baqara as
speaking directly to the subject of walaya is not an innovation of the Bab's
but has characterized a strong tendency in Shi'i exegesis from the earliest
times.25 This is clarified in notes in the following text that direct the reader
to similar interpretations in classical literature. Of interest here is that such a
commentary was written by one who was not a member of the ulama class,
but rather a young merchant. The nature of the commentary shows that there
was a perceived need to reassert, revalorize, relocate, or perhaps take
possession of this cardinal Shi'i doctrine. Why such a need was felt at this
particular time and within the Iranian merchant class, has been discussed at
length by scholars concerned with the social history of late-eighteenth- and
early-nineteenth-century Iran. The following discussion attests to the degree
to which this need was felt, and the consequences it had for the
interpretation of scripture. Here we begin to understand why the Tafsir surat
al-Baqara provides invaluable information about the development

Literally juz'. The Qur'an is divided in thirty more or less equal parts (ajza') for liturgical purposes,
enabling the believer to read equal parts of the text on successive days of the sacred month of Ramadan, for
example. The first part includes the first sura, al-Fatiha, the Opening, consisting of seven verses and the first 141
verses of the Surat al-Baqara. The Surat al-Baqara comprises roughly two and one-half parts. It is the longest sura
of the Qur'an.

This much more famous second work, the Qayyum al-Asma, appears to be the first work written after
the commentary on al-Baqara. By its special structure it actually may be considered a commentary on the entire
Qur'an. Thus, if it had been the Bab's desire to produce a complete tafsir at this early stage, he may be seen as
having accomplished this task though in a radically and unpredictably untraditional form. For a fuller description
of this second commentary, see Lawson "Interpretation as Revelation."

If the basic conclusion of this paper is correct, namely that the Babi movement represents an
efflorescence of themes, motifs, and religiosity associated with the earliest extremist Shi'is, then Halm's statement,
referring to the Ahl-i Haqq and the Nusayris, needs to be reassessed: "Descendarts of the Kufan ghulat have
survived to the present time in two mountainous areas of retreat, far from the centres of political power and from
Sunni as well as Shiite orthodoxy.... The Nusayris are the only Islamic sect to preserve the unbroken tradition of
the Kufan guluw." Heinz Halm, Shiism, trans. J. Watson, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991, 158-59.

of the Bab's religious ideas.

Walaya in the Bab's Earliest Work

The subject of walaya is introduced very early in the tafsir where reference
is made to the Absolute Walaya (walayatuhu al-mutlaqa) of `Ali. In the
following pages, Qur'an citations are presented in small capital letters in
order to make as clear as possible the connection between the words of the
commentator and the sacred text. In the course of the Bab's commentary on
the second verse of the Fatiha, "Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds,"
the verse is said to be the book (kitab) of `Ali, in which God has placed all
the principles (ahkam) of Absolute Walaya pertaining to it. It is designated
here, the Paradise of the Inclusive Unity (jannat al-wahidiya), whose
protection has been reserved for all those who affirm 'Ali's walaya.26

In this very brief statement, certain important terms are introduced, which
play a key role throughout the rest of the tafsir. Apart from the word walaya
(guardianship, friendship), the designation wahidiya occurs over and over
again throughout the work. It is descriptive of one of the degrees of divinity
which constitute the whole hierarchical metaphysical structure of the world.
It is the degree immediately inferior to the divine Exclusive Unity
(ahadiya). Such terminology betrays the influence of the so-called wahdat
al-wujud school associated with Ibn 'Arabi. Suffice it here to say that the
Absolute Walaya represents a theoretical position at least one remove from
the Ultimate. A third ontic level, "existence as an expression of divine
mercy," is associated with Fatima. We will return to this presently.27

The choice of the word principles (ahkam) has several connotations. In this
short introductory sentence to the tafsir on the Fatiha, the Bab characterizes
this opening chapter of the Qur'an as containing seven clear verses (ayat
muhkamat). The hermeneutic polarities of mutashabihat/muhkamat
represent one of the oldest concerns of tafsir in general and have occasioned
much speculation on the part of exegetes of all schools and attitudes. The

ja'ala Allahu.... Repeated reference throughout this commentary to ahadiya, wahidiya, rahmaniya, and so on
constitutes one of its more distinguishing characteristics. The terminology comes originally from Ibn 'Arabi
(638/1240) and its use here by the Bab offers yet another example of how the work, if not the thought, of one of
history's greatest mystics had thoroughly permeated Iranian Shi'i spiritual discourse (`irfan) by this time. For a
study of these terms as they were received by Ibn 'Arabi's student Qunawi and others, see William Chittick, "The
Five Divine Presences," Muslim World, 1982, 72, 107-28. (See also the critique of this article: Hermann Landolt
“Review of W. Chittick, „The Five Divine Presences- From al-Qunawi to al-Qaysari.‟ Studia Iranica, Suppl. 8,
1985, #488, p. 126.) Briefly, the term ahadiya represents the highest aspect of the Absolute about which we can
notion (if one may use a noun as a verb) but does not, of course, define the Absolute that must always be beyond
whatever occurs about It in our minds- The term wahidiya refers to the second highest aspect of the Absolute, the
aspect that involves the "appearance" of the divine names and attributes. See also 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Kashani, al-
Istilahat al-Sufiya, edited by Muhammad Kamal Ibrahim Ja„far, Cairo: al-Hai‟at al-Misriyat al-„Amma li‟l-Kitab,
1981, 25,47. The proper understanding of this technical terminology has been a subject of scholarly debate in Iran
for centuries.

Etymologically feminine, rahmaniya, from the Arabic word for "womb," is the abstract noun
mercifulness. Ibn Arabi seems to be the one responsible for characterizing the existentiation of creation as an act
of mercy, an expression of rahmaniya.

primary idea is that the Qur'an contains both ambiguous and unambiguous
verses. At the most basic level, these are thought to be divided between
straightforward legal prescriptions and the rest of the book. The terminology
here is taken from Qur'an 3:7:

> He it is who has sent down to thee the Book. In it are verses basic or
> fundamental (of established meaning) [muhkamat]. They are the
> foundation of the Book [umm al-kitab]. Others are allegorical
> [mutashabihat]. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the
> part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its
> hidden meanings [ta'wil]. But no one knows its hidden meanings
> [ta'wil] except God. And those who are firmly grounded in
> knowledge say: "We believe in the Book, the whole of it is from our
> Lord." And none will grasp the message except those who have
> understanding.

With this aya comes one of the more fundamental differences between the
Sunni and Shi'i exegetes who disagree about its grammar and syntax. The
above translation represents the "Sunni" reading. A Shi'i reading would be:
"And none knows its interpretation save God and those firmly rooted in
knowledge" (al-rasikhun fi'l -'ilm). These rasikhun are of course the Imams,
in the first place, and in the second place, at least amongst the Usulis, the
mujtahids. So understood, the designation of the verses of the Fatiha as
unambiguous strongly suggests that the Bab read them as having a positive
and binding relationship with a true understanding of the Book. Seen in this
light, his statement that verse 2 of the Fatima ordains belief in the Absolute
Walaya of `Ali must be taken as divine law, binding upon the believer in the
same way as legal prescriptions for the terms of inheritance, or even prayer
and fasting, are obligatory.

In this same commentary on the seven verses of the Fatiha, we first
encounter Fatima. In line with his method and the structure of this section,
the Bab designates the third verse, "the merciful the compassionate" (ar-
rahman ar-rahim), as "the book of Fatima" (kitab Fatima salat allah
'alayha).28 That Fatima is associated with rahma, "mercy," is in line with the
general idea of existence as mercy and the role of the feminine articulated in
the writings of Ibn `Arabi.29 It should also be noted that rahma is a feminine
noun constructed on the root rhm, which is also the basis for the word
rahim, "uterus, womb." Fatima is associated with this verse because it is
gender-specific so that grammar reflects reality – a basic axiom of the
worldview we are investigating. That it is also the third verse of the sura
means that the order: Muhammad, `Ali, Fatima (ahadiya, wahidiya,

In the commentary on the rest of the Fatiha, each verse of which is designated as "the book" or
writing of one of the fourteen Pure Ones, that is the twelve imams, Fatima, and Muhammad. For specifics on the
heptadic structure that reflects the realities of Family of God, see Lawson (1986).

rahmaniya) is corroborated both through the gender reference and
chronological order of birth.30 The remainder of the commentary runs:

> And God has put in [this verse] all that is hers and all that pertains to
> her. [This verse] is the Garden of Divine Grace (jannat al-na'im).
> God has ordained its shade for the one who believes in her and loves
> her after he has recognized her as she deserves (ba `da ma 'arafaha
> bima hiya ahluha), as she appeared to the seeker (or:
> knower/Gnostic, „arif) through his own self (kama tajallat li'l 'arif
> lahu bihi). Then this garden will open to him.31

While there is no explicit mention of walaya here, it is nonetheless assumed
throughout the tafsir that Fatima is, as a member of the Family of God, one
of the fourteen bearers of walaya. The Bab, it seems, wishes to highlight
various nuances of this religious authority according to the particular
bearer/wali he is discussing. In the case of Fatima, this religious authority is
clearly associated with love (mahabba) and knowledge/gnosis ('irfan), and
as we already saw, mercy. For example, in his commentary on 2:25, the Bab
states that Paradise or "the Garden" is indeed the love of the form of Fatima
(mahabbat shabah Fatima). Before we look further at this material, it may
be helpful to offer a brief summary of the general place of Fatima in Islam
and Shi'ism.

Fatima of History

Fatima (11/633), the daughter of Muhammad and wife of the first Imam `Ali
ibn Abi Talib (40/661) enjoys an exalted position in Shi'i piety and is
thought by some to function for the Shi'a much the same way that Mary
functions in the Catholic tradition.32 She is depicted in the histories as the
long-suffering darling of her father, to whom she was born through
Muhammad's first wife, the incomparable Khadija. She was married to `Ali,
which sources say was a difficult marriage.33 But while she lived, she was

It should be noted that we find no mention of Fatima at the corresponding place in the eleventh-
century classical work by the otherwise influential Shi'i theologian Tusi, Muhammad al-Hasan, al-., al-Tibyan fi
Tafsir al-Qur' an, Najaf ,1957-63, Vol. 1, 28-30.

Baq. p. 8, 11.4-8.The phrase "Garden of Grace" (jannat al-na'im) is determined by Qur'anic usage
(see, e.g., 26:85). "Gnostic" translates 'arif. There are other choices: "recognizer," "knower," "seeker."

Ali's nickname Abu Turab is said to have originated because whenever he and Fatima would quarrel,
he would leave the house and cover his head with dust, presumably out of the frustration at being married to the
Prophet's daughter. Indeed, the Prophet himself bestowed this name upon him (Laura Veccia Vaglieri, "Fatima",
Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd ed.). For other explanations of the distinctive nickname, see Kohlberg, Abu Turab,
347-52; and "The Dawning Places of the Lights of Certainty in the Divine Secrets Connected with the Commander
of the Faithful, by Rajab Bursi (d. 1411)." In The Legacy of Mediaeval Persian Sufism, ed. Leonard Lewisohn,

recent and quite penetrating study of this drama, see Negar Mottahedeh, "Ruptured Spaces and Effective Histories:

The bibliography on Fatima remains to be compiled. For this paper I have benefited from Laura
Veccia Vaglieri's excellent Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed., entry. See now (in collaboration with Jean Calmard),

his only wife. She is venerated as the mother of the second and third Ithna
`Ashari Imams, Hasan and Husayn (and by extension all of the Imams). She
is held up to the believers by the sources as a model of suffering, patience,
generosity, wisdom, and valiant heroism ending in martyrdom. During the
Prophet's Meccan and early Medinan period, when the Banu Hashim
imposed a ban upon dealings with Muhammad, Fatima is singled out as
having endured the privations with great dignity and patience. 34 Of all the
Prophet's children, Fatima lived the longest (although she died only a few
months after the Prophet's death) and gave Muhammad, who would have
otherwise been bereft of male progeny, many descendants. Indeed, one of
the many calumnies directed at Muhammad was that he was without male
progeny. Such a man was known derisively in this milieu as “cut off” (al-
abtar).35 Muhammad was cruelly taunted with this epithet by his fellow
Meccans because of the death of his and Khadija's two infant sons, Qasim
and Abdallah. Fatima is seen by the tradition as being the one responsible
for giving the lie to this cruel insult by providing the Prophet his two
grandsons, Hasan, Husayn, and their sisters Zainab and Umm Kulthum.36
Shi'i religious literature delights in demonstrating how this epithet, recorded
in the sura The Abundance (Qur'an 108, as it happens, the shortest sura in
the book), was turned against Muhammad's enemies because through
Fatima Muhammad's lineage not only continued but multiplied greatly in
the Imamate that is the institutional sanctuary of walaya in Shi'ism.37
Ironically, it was Muhammad's enemies who were “cut off” (al-abtar) by the
will of God.

Fatima is greatly venerated by all Muslims who, when speaking of her,
typically add the honorific al-Zahra' (the shining one, the luminous, the
gloriously radiant). Among the Shi'a this veneration reaches its greatest
intensity. Two Western scholars, Henri Lammens and Louis Massignon,
studied the historical basis for this reverence and reached diametrically
opposite opinions: Lammens argued that the historical Fatima was "a
woman devoid of attraction, of mediocre intelligence, completely
insignificant, little esteemed by her father, ill-treated by her husband....

Surprisingly, much early and later explicitly Shi‟i material is ignored in this otherwise interesting article. For
example, the very early Shi'i Tafsir Furat ibn Ibrahim mentions Fatima in over twenty places. The commentaries
of the two famous classical Shi'i exegetes, Tusi and Tabrisi, also mention her at various points in their
commentaries. The commentaries of Muhsin Fayd Kashani and others also frequently cite hadith, or more
appropriately akhbar, which mention Fatima's name.

The lack of descendants is a topos in Muhammad's biography and is reflected in the Qur'an as well.

This meant that his progeny was destined to issue only from his daughters, which in his society meant that he was
without descendants.

A third son, Muhsin, was stillborn.

Later on in his career, the Bab himself would compose a lengthy commentary on this very sura. See
Todd Lawson, "Qur'an Commentary as Sacred Performance: The Bab's tafsirs of Qur'an 103 and 108, the

anaemic, often ill, prone to tears, who died perhaps of consumption."38
Massignon has made Fatima "sublime, elevating her to a position often
reminiscent of that which the Virgin Mary holds among Christians. For
Massignon, she represents the beginnings of Universal Islam" because of
her care for the non-Arab converts.39 Massignon's study improves upon
Lammens by offering a "psychologico-religious explanation for the origin
and development of the legend of the daughter of the Prophet and bridges
the gap between legend and reality as Lammen's book fails to do;” however,
"[Massignon's work] cannot escape the objection of the historian, who will
consider that the author subordinates the facts to beliefs about Fatima which
appeared only later."40 This statement obviously represents a certain
historiographical approach. Beliefs, it is clear, have frequently been as
crucial to history as facts. Indeed, in this article beliefs are of primary
interest; whether or not they represent, in the case of Fatima, "true historical
reality" is immaterial. This is so precisely because we can see how much
such belief actually influenced the unfolding of radical religious activity in
nineteenth-century Iran. But it is also true – and this is a historiographical
element of consequence – that Fatima's life was so obscure that Ibn Hisham
and the other earlier historians had little occasion to concern themselves
with her.

Fatima died in the eleventh year of the hijra, six months after the death of
the Prophet. Today (because her grave is unknown), Shi'is visit three places
in Medina in order to pay homage to her: her house, the Baqi' cemetery, and
the space in the Great Mosque between the rawda and the tomb of the
Prophet.41 Her nickname, "Mother of her father" (Umm Abiha) has several
explanations: she learned through a revelation that the name of her very last
descendant would be Muhammad, perhaps as a logical inference from the
story of her heavenly, luminous origin and birth. Her name Creator (Fatir),
which is one of the names listed in an eleventh-century source, represents a
glorification of Fatima that seems to be characteristic of the extreme
Isma'ilis and of "aberrant" sects such as the Nusayris rather than of the
Imamis. Have we here a borrowing of the latter from the former? Veccia
Vaglieri asks.42 The belief that Fatima is Fatir, Creator, would also help
explain her kunya Umm Abiha. Another explanation for the name is that it
became Fatima's as a result of her providing comfort to Muhammad during
the darkest times.43 It has been suggested that because of the connections

between the cult of Mary among Christians and that of Fatima among
Muslims, it is possible that the title arose as a counterpart to that of "Mother
of God," especially since the name seems to be found only in later (that is,
twelfth-century) sources.44

Islam has honored 'Asiyah bint Muzahim, (Pharoah's wife), Maryam bint
'Imran (Mary, mother of Jesus), Khadija, and Fatima as the four perfect
women of the world, the best women of Paradise.45 By the twelfth century,
Shi'i scholars had compiled a list of nearly a hundred names and attributes
by which Fatima should be honored46 This veneration may be best seen in
three of the titles by which she is most frequently designated: al-Zahra', "the
luminous"; Fatir, "Creator"; and Umm Abiha, "Mother of her Father."
Others include the masculine form Fatim, al-Tahira, al-Zakiya, al-
Muhaddatha, al-Siddiqa, al-Batul, and Maryam al-Kubra, and especially
significant in connection with Tahirih, Qurrat al-'Ayn – one of the most
common names by which Tahirih the Babi was known. Official occasions
for honoring her are her birth (20 Ramadan), marriage to 'Ali, and the public
feast of Mubahala (21, 24, 25 Dhu'l-Hijja). This last deserves a special word
because it is in connection with the Mubahala that Fatima becomes known
as one of the Ahl al-Kisa', "People of the cloak." These are Muhammad,
'Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn, a group that represents an "elite within an
elite" in Shi'ism.47 The anniversary of her death (3 Jumada II and 2
Ramadan) is also befittingly observed. These are all public holy days in Iran
and observed around the world. Other holy days, such as the Day of al-
Ghadir (18th of Dhu' 1-Hijja) and the Muharram observances – tradition has
Fatima making a post mortem appearance at Karbala (which the Bab
mentions in his tafsir) to lament the cruel fate of her son and his family and
companions48 – are public and private occasions for honoring her memory.

Other events in her life have particular interest here: she is depicted as
threatening to remove her head covering twice: on one occasion to protest
the treatment of 'Ali after the death of the Prophet,49 and another time as
threatening to remove her head covering in order to stop Abu Bakr and
'Umar from forcibly entering her house after the so-called election of the
first caliph.50 This will bring to mind Tahirih's removal of the veil that so
scandalized even the Babis themselves.51 In another tradition, she is
presented as defiantly turning her back to the intruders to express her

repugnance;52 she is also seen traveling on horseback with `Ali to ask for the
support of the Ansar (who, unfortunately had already committed themselves
to Abu Bakr);53 she is quoted as having challenged 'Umar himself: "You
have left the body of the Apostle of God with us and you have decided
among yourselves without consulting us, without respecting our rights."54

Thus we clearly see the figure of a politically active woman, one who could
easily inspire others to similar action. It is curious, in light of this that one of
the prevailing images associated with Fatima is that of a sickly and timid
victim. Another element in Fatima's political biography is the troublesome
Fadak affair. Abu Bakr, according to Shi'i sources, deprived Fatima of
inheriting this productive oasis that the Prophet had promised her. This
deprivation caused great hardship for her and her family and also deprived
the cause of `Ali essential material support. In addition, there is the legend
of the mushaf of Fatima, the book that Gabriel brought her for consolation
after the death of her father.55 As Veccia Vaglieri points out, the material on
Fatima remains to be systematical studied. Once it is, however, it will be
most interesting to notice whether or not these conflicting images are the
result of confessional influences. In the meantime, the question posed by
Veccia Vaglieri, did Imami Shi'ism borrow from Isma'ili Shi'ism in the
veneration of Fatima? is quite pertinent to the study of the literature of the
Shaykhi school in general. As I demonstrate, it is also pertinent in the study
of the writings of the Bab, who, as far as we know, was an Imami Shi'i, born
in Shiraz on 20 October 1819 (1 Muharram 1235).

The Bab's Fatima

Many of the events or topics recounted above are touched upon and
elaborated in the Bab's tafsir. It is crucial, however, first to establish some
idea of what is to be expected. To do this, I rely upon the studies of Henry
Corbin, who is the one Western scholar to have penetrated many of the
mysteries that this kind of literature holds. In this case, we are particularly
fortunate that Corbin devoted an entire book to the study of the spiritual
feminine in Iranian religion. In Corbin's distinctive approach, Mazdean
religious ideas are connected with Islamic Shiite gnosis, first in the work of
Suhrawardi and finally, and more resoundingly, in the corpus of the
Shaykhis, a corpus that remains lamentably understudied, though progress
has been achieved since Corbin's time.56 In any case, Corbin saw the
founder of the Shaykhi school, Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i (1826) and his

writings of Hajj Karim Khan Kirmani (1870), the Shaykhi leader who was,
in some respects, the Bab's (1850) most bitter opponent. Both had been avid
students of the teachings of Ahsa'i and Rashti (as had Tahirih herself).
Corbin's reading of Kirmani's works will be shown to resonate with the
image of Fatima in this early commentary by the Bab. It is still too soon to
determine on what doctrinal grounds they might have differed with regard to
Fatima, or indeed, if they differed at all. The main area of disagreement
between the two was not a matter for scholasticism.

In this school of thought the Family of God, the Fourteen Very-Pure,
function, according to Corbin, in a way "analagous to the Aeons of the
pleroma in Valentinian gnosis." One of the distinctions between the
Suhrawardian and Shaykhi cosmologies is discerned in the shift from a
threefold to a fourfold cosmology. For Suhrawardi these were 1) the earthly,
human world, "the object of sensory perception"; 2) the world of Soul or
Malakut, "the world of imaginative perception" and 3) the cherubinic or
angelic world of Jabarut, "the object of intelligible knowledge."58
Consonant with the motif of quaternity by which much of their thought is
distinguished, Shaykhism added a fourth realm (as did Ibn 'Arabi), namely
the sphere of deity, the world of lahut. For the Shaykhis, however, this realm
was "occupied" only by the Family of God – not, as it were, God Himself.
Fatima is located first and foremost in this supracelestial realm. As Corbin
says, using one of his favorite metaphors:

> One might say that [Shaykhi thought] allows us to hear the theme of
> the celestial Earth... in a still higher octave. Each octave is a new

Corbin, 58; "primitive" here is both a formal and a chronological designation. By it such groups as
the Nusayris, the early Isma'ilis, and other of the so-called ghulat are intended.

The passage continues: "And through this supracelestial Earth, we are led to the idea of a Shi'ite
Sophiology, by which we shall perceive afresh something that Mazdean Sophiology already perceived in the
Angel of the Earth, but this time at a new and higher level, since the progressio harmonica produces the resonance
of harmonics which until then had remained silent." Corbin, 59-60).

> becomes visible through the recital of external events. It will mean to
> "see things in Hurqalya.."60

In this quaternary world the relationship between male and female is
accorded the highest possible value. Hurqalya is, of course, the abode of the
Hidden Imam who is alive there and "in hiding" since his disappearance in
260/874. There is ample evidence throughout the works of the Bab, and
particularly in the one under study here, that he himself shared a similar, if
not identical, approach to history and scripture (although he does not use the
word Hurqalya here). But we will see more of this later in this essay.61

There is no need to dwell further here on Corbin's harmonic rendition of the
history of Iranian mythology and religious symbolism62 whereby he can see
the ancient Spendarmat in the Fatima of the Shi'a, except to say that the
apokatastasis, the "restoration of all things to their primordial splendor and
wholeness, to the state in which they were before the invasion of the
Ahrimanian Counterpowers" that he perceives in Shaykhism,63 is very much
a feature of the clan of Babism. As we have already indicated, the authority
and power of Tahirih (and the other Babis) is a result of three simultaneous
events: a fulfillment of the past, a reenactment of the past, and a break with
the past.

Day of the Covenant

One of the more important controlling myths in Islam, whether Sunni or
Shi'i, is the drama of God's establishing a covenant (`ahd, mithaq) between
Himself and humanity through the prophet Adam. The Qur'an tells the story
in a characteristically terse passage at Qur'an 7:172. At a time before the
creation of the world, God summoned Adam to His presence whereupon he
caused the "seeds" (al-dharr) of all future generations to come forth from
Adam's loins. God confronted Adam – and this vast company thus arrayed
before Him – with the question "Am I not your Lord?" (a-lastu bi-
rabbikum). The immediate response was "Yea, verily!" (bala). The Qur'an
explains that this was done so that no human would be able to say on the
Day of Resurrection, when all would be given their just deserts, that they
should be excused for their sins because they were not aware of their

Corbin, 60.

All of this may be found amplified in greater detail at Corbin, 60-73.

Nothing if not baroque, Corbin's interest in the theme of the "celestial earth" (a basic coincidentia
oppositorum, it should be noted) went far beyond, yet somehow remained centered, in the figure of Fatima. He
offered the metaphor of music, specifically the progressio harmonica of the pipe organ, to explain what he saw as
a beautiful and compelling Iranian enrichment of intellectual history: "Whoever is somewhat familiar with the
organ knows what are referred to as "stops." Thanks to these stops, each note can cause several pipes of different
lengths to "speak" simultaneously; thus, besides the fundamental note, a number of harmonic overtones can be
heard. Among the contrivances that regulate them, the progressio harmonica designates a combination of stops
which allows more and more overtones to be heard as one ascends towards the upper register, until at a certain
pitch the fundamental note also resounds simultaneously" (Corbin, p. 51).

Covenat (Quran 7:172) in Safavid Quran Commentary." Proceedings of the Safavid Roundtable, Edinburgh
(1988)., forthcoming.

obligation to God. The "Yea verily!" constitutes humanity's primordial
assent to the divine covenant.64 Within this covenant myth dwells the
explanatory theory of all Islamicate religious authority. It has been
particularly instrumental in justifying the mediation and negotiation of
charismatic power and authority in a Sufi milieu, but no less in the Shi'i
milieu.65

In Shi'i communities throughout the world, the eighteenth day of Dhu' l-
Hijja, the pilgrimage month, is commemorated as the Day of the Covenant
(yawm al-mithaq) and anniversary of the public appointment by the Prophet
Muhammad of `Ali as his successor at a small oasis known as Ghadir
Khumm, "the pool of Ghadir." (In Iran, a Shi`i state, this date is an official
public holiday.) This oasis was a way station between Mecca and Medina
and it was here, during a rest on the way back from his last pilgrimage, that
the Prophet made his famous speech, the words of which are preserved in
both Sunni and Shi'i books of Tradition:

> We were with the Apostle of God in his journey and we stopped at
> Ghadir Khumm. We performed the obligatory prayer together and a
> place was swept for the Apostle under two trees and he performed
> the mid-day prayer. And then he took `Ali by the hand and said to the
> people: 'Do you not acknowledge that I have a greater claim on each
> of the believers than they have on themselves?' And they replied:
> 'Yea verily!' [bala] And he took 'Ali's hand and said: 'Of whomsoever
> I am Lord [Mawla], then `Ali is also his Lord. O God! Be Thou the
> supporter of whoever supports 'Ali and the enemy of whoever op-
> poses him.' And 'Umar [the future second caliph] met him ['Ali] after
> this and said to him: 'Congratulations, O son of Abu Talib! Now
> morning and evening [i.e., forever] you are the master of every
> believing man and woman.66

This passage (along with its several variants) is important for two main
reasons; 1) the establishment of the continuance of religious authority by the
Prophet "the covenant"; 2) the use of the exquisitely polyvocal term mawla,
which is a derivative of the root wly, upon which the word walaya is built.
Mawla is a particularly interesting Arabic word in that it can mean either
"master" or "client" – diametrically opposite denotations, according to
usage. As such, it represents admirably the mutuality and reciprocal nature

of walaya. But it also gives rise to alternate interpretations of this sermon, as
the entire history of Islam will attest. It is as the de facto and de jure
establishment of the sacred covenant that this sermon occupies us for the
moment. This covenant functions as the raison d'être of Shi'ism. Those who
recognize, subscribe to, uphold, and defend the appointment of 'Ali as
Muhammad's rightful successor and leader – both spiritual and temporal –
of the community of Muslims, are faithful to the covenant and may be
considered believing Muslims (muslim mu'min). Those who acknowledge
anyone else as the successor of Muhammad and leader of the community is
accounted a breaker (naqid) of this covenant and an infidel (kafir).

A natural starting place, then, for a detailed examination of the
person/figure/symbol of Fatima in the Bab's Qur'an commentary is the
Covenant. The Bab draws a comparison or homologue between the Qur'anic
primordial yawm al-mithaq, the events of which are narrated in Qur'an
7:172, and the Day of al-Ghadir. The first Qur'anic cue for this comparison
is in verse 2:8: "Of the people there are some who say: 'We believe in God
and the Last Day'; but they do not really believe." The people specified here,
according to the Bab, are those whom God will cause to forget faith in 'Ali's
walaya on the Last Day. They are not believers because their faith is flawed,
even though they may consider themselves true believers in 'Ali's spiritual
authority:

> Whoever knows that `Ali is the sign of God in the station of the
> Exclusive Divine Unity ... is one of the believers "in God and the
> Last Day," which is really the First Day, and it is the beginning of the
> mention of the created thing in the world of contingency, and it is the
> day God made to shine with light, and it is the light of `Ali. Such a
> one is one of the believers. And whoever abandons this station enters
> into the category: "and he is not an exalted believer." May God
> protect us through Muhammad and his family from entering into this
> error!67

It will become clear below that "the day God made to shine with light, and it
is the light of `Ali" is an indirect reference to Fatima, who is the source of
all light. The Bab strengthens the connection or homology between the Last
Day mentioned here and the Day of the Covenant and the Day of al-Ghadir
Khumm by quoting a long hadith from the eleventh Imam al-Hasan al-
'Askari‟s tafsir, in which the occasion of revelation (known in some circles
as sabab al-nuzul) for this verse is established as the Day of al-Ghadir. In
this verse, the Imam says God was warning Muhammad about those who
feigned allegiance to `Ali following the sermon just quoted. The Bab says:

> That place of testimony is the same as the "dimension" (dharr) of the
> primordial covenant, when the covenant of lordship was taken:

Baq, 47-48.

> whoever was recognized [then] was recognized [for all time]. Indeed,
> "those possessed of minds" know what happened there by what
> happened here (Ghadir Khumm), the realm of this world (or
> "religion" tashri) is in accord with the realm of that world (or "divine
> creation" takwin). But this place of testimony (viz. the Day of al-
> Ghadir) is greater than the first place of testimony, the dimension of
> the affirmation of Divine Unity, while the second place of testimony
> is the dimension of the affirmation of Prophethood – nay, rather it is
> the essence of the Divine Cause. This place of testimony of the Day
> of al-Ghadir is the third place of testimony and the greatest
> dimension. The remaining place of testimony is the last: it is the
> dimension of the Fourth Support, the rising of the Qa'im, may God
> hasten his glad advent. This occasion of testimony will occur in the
> beginning of his appearance (or emergence, zuhur) and it is the di-
> mension of the affirmation by their Shi'a that the Family of God are
> the worn of magnification in the midmost sanctity of praise.” 68

Thus the fourfold structure of the Bab's approach. The Bab says that the
shahada, the true testimony to the truth of this, is none other than the Imams
and Fatima.69 The Bab demonstrates how Fatima is implicated in this
covenant in his commentary on Qur'an 2:83. Here he says that the esoteric
meaning of the word kindred is a clear designation of Fatima, just as the
word orphans is a reference to al-Hasan and al-Husayn. "God has spoken
here about the taking of the covenant with all created things in the eight
Paradises, in affirmation of the walaya of 'Ali"70The Qur'anic verse is:

> And remember We took a Covenant from the Children of Israel:
> Worship none but God; treat with kindness your parents and kindred,
> and orphans and those in need; Speak fair to the people; be steadfast
> in prayer; and practice regular charity. Then did ye turn your back,
> except a few among you, and ye backslide even now.” [Qur'an 2:83]

In another quaternary interpretation, the phrase: "those who broke the
covenant" [Qur'an 2:27] refers to the covenant ('ahd) of Muhammad vis-à-
vis the signs (ayat) of `Ali. This covenant was instituted in the world of the
Unseen (al-ghayb), the spiritual realm. Although the term lahut is not used,
nor the word hurqalya, it is clear that the realm of al-ghayb is a spiritual
"space" with its own "time."

> These signs were placed within (fi) the dimension (dharr) of the
> hearts [which represents] the station (maqam) of Divine Unity
> (tawhid), and [in] the dimension of the intellects [which represents]
> the level (rutba) of Prophethood (nubuwwa), and [in] the atoms of
souls [which represents] the abode of the Imamate (imama), and [in]

> the love of the Shi'a after God imposed this solemn binding upon all
> created things [which is] faith (iman) in Muhammad, `Ali, Hasan,
> Husayn, Ja'far, Musa, and Fatima.71

The first who "broke the covenant" was Abu Bakr.

> He broke the covenant of God concerning His friends (awliya) in the
> unseen worlds and he violated the walaya of `Ali in its [future]
> apppearances in the visible Imams . . . and he [broke the covenant]
> by taking the land of al-Fadak away from Fatima after he knew very
> well that the Apostle of God had specified it for her during his life
> and forbidden its produce to go to anyone else.72

In Kirmani's treatment of the Qur'anic Day of the Covenant when God
demanded from the seed of Adam absolute obedience, this drama was
originally played out in the realm of lahut, "long before" it achieved its first
earthly iteration at the time of Adam. Its second, and most important
iteration occurred at the pool called Ghadir Khumm when Muhammad
appointed `Ali his successor and took a pact with all of the Muslims to this
effect.73 Fatima's response in this divine setting is precisely the "theurgic ac-
complishment" of becoming the Earth for the production of the cosmos.
None can have access or perception of this realm, it is too ratified, powerful
in its beauty and luminous beyond mortal ability to perceive. "The beings of
the pleroma of the lahut are visible only in their apparitional forms
[ashbah], which are the receptacles of their theophanies."74 According to
Kirmani, Fatima is the Earth of the sacred lahuti universe,75 which is related
to the mysterious earth of Hurqalya.

The Bab describes Fatima as the "Universal earth," "heaven" and "the
Sabbath." This same idea may be evident in a particularly vivid passage of
the Bab's tafsir. At verse 60 of Surat al-Baqara, for example, the water that

Ibid., 94. kafirun instead of the Qur'anic "losers" (khasirun, all mss.). These seven names are used as
a kind of shorthand to represent the Prophet, Fatima, and the twelve Imams because although they are twelve, they
may be known by using only these seven names; That is, each of the names Muhammad, 'Ali, Hasan, and Husayn
may be applied to more than one Imam while the names Fatima, Ja'far, and Musa can apply to only one person
respectively. Earlier in this commentary, the Bab ad Qur'an 2:3 (Baq, 22-23), speaks of seven grades of faith
(iman), taking his cue from yuminuna, "those who believe." One grade, the third, is faithfulness (wafa')- a near
synonym -associated specifically with Fatima.

Ibid., 94-95.

For important background to the Shaykhi reading of Qur'an 7:172, see Lawson, A 'New Testament‟

Corbin, 63. A study of Shi'i akhbari tafsir on precisely the subject of the Day of the Covenant reveals
that the apparitional forms of the "first" participants is more or less a standard topos. See Lawson, "A 'New
Testament.'" This, of course, was one of Corbin's main points: the Shaykhis represent a revivification of very
ancient modes of religiosity combined with a terminology that had more recently developed through the works of
such important Iranian philosophers as Mulla Sadra (d.1640).

Formed on the Arabic word ilah (god), lahut refers to the divine realm. Three other similar words are
encountered in such discussions: jabarut, malakut, mink to refer to three realms that issue in descending order
from the lahut. All of these worlds symbolize with each other. A fifth term, nasut (humanity, human dimension),
is frequently encountered. It is built on the word nas and is the polar opposite of lahut. Between lahut and nasut
the whole spectrum of cosmic activity and events occurs.

gushed forth from the rock at twelve different places after Moses struck it
with his staff, is said to represent the walaya of all the Imams. The Bab says
that although the water issued from these various places, it was in fact the
same water. The station of Fatima is further defined here as that without
which walaya could not have appeared in the world:

> And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said:
> "Strike the rock with thy staff." Then gushed forth therefrom twelve
> springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of
> the sustenance provided by God, and do no evil nor mischief on the
> (face of the) earth. [Qur'an 2:60]

The Bab says, the striker here is Muhammad, the staff is `Ali, and the stone
[from which the water came forth] is Fatima. And the springs are the twelve
Imams. `Ali, by virtue of walaya, is counted among them and by virtue of
the rank of staff is also distinguished from them. The point of this Qur'anic
passage is that it corroborates the history of Islam. Or, more important, the
Bab, through this interpretation, demonstrates that in the eternal word of
God, the story of Muhammad and his family had been established or
"prophesied." History, according to this approach (as Corbin observed), is
best seen as a subject for ta‟wil: it is symbolic (as distinct from allegorical).
God commanded Muhammad to give his daughter Fatima in marriage to
`Ali so that all people "at all times" might be able to recognize their Imam,
to "eat and drink of the splendours of the knowledge dispensed by your
Imam through the grace (fadl) of Muhammad."76 Some sources even suggest
that at this marriage (which occurred "first" in the spiritual realm) God
himself was wali for Fatima.77 Such a myth nicely supplies a narrative
explanation for those verses in the Qur'an, mentioned above, which say that
God is a wali or protector of the believers.

In the Bab's commentary at 2:29, we encounter another instance of the
historical event used as a subject of ta'wil. And here we also encounter
Fatima as the spiritual reality of a heavenly earth. The Qur'anic verse is: "It
is He who hath created for you all things that are on earth; then He turned
Himself to heaven, and he gave order and perfection to the seven heavens;
and of a[[ things he hath perfect knowledge" [Qur'an 2:291.

Fatima here is described as being this "universal earth" out of which the
Imams will appear.

Baq, 192-93. Veccia Vaglieri, "Fatima,” noticed this identification of Fatima with the rock "among
Isma'ilis and the deviant sects" and says further that she has found no trace of such an idea in the Imami sources.
According to Kashani,Muhsin Fayd. al-Safi fi Tafsir Kalam Allah al-Wafi. 5 vols. Beirut: Mu'assasat al-A`lami li-
I'Matbu`at, 1979-82. Vol 1., 136-37, Moses struck the rock invoking the name of Muhammad and his family; there
is no mention of Fatima‟s being the rock in Kashani or Bahrani, two late-seventeenth-century Safavid works. But
see Isfahani ,Tafsir, 244 where a somewhat rationalistic presentation of this reading is found. Isfahani avoids the
extreme personifications and "allegorizing" found in the tafsir of the Bab. (n.b the possible connection between
hajar "rock" and Hagar, the wife of Abraham and mother of the Arabs, as a manifestation of Fatima).

> God made the real meaning of this "comprehensive earth" to be
> Fatima, upon her be God's blessing and peace. And [He made] what
> was in her to be the Imams, upon them be God's blessing and peace.
> He is the One who created, through the angels, all that is in the Earth
> of the Divine Exclusive Unity, which is Fatima, for Muhammad,
> upon him be God's blessing and peace.

> "Then He lifted Himself to heaven," that is, He married her [Fatima]
> to `Ali and thus she is equated with heaven as far as honor (sharfa) is
> concerned. Thus God made her ... "one of the mighty portents, a
> warning to mankind, to any of you that chooses to press forward or
> to follow behind" [Qur'an 74:36-37].78

In Corbin's summary of Kirmani, we discern the logic of the Bab's
hermeneutic: Since all earthly events are reflections of a pre-eternal order,
the earthly marriage of `Ali and Fatima also had its purest and holiest
occurrence in the supracelestial realm. The earthly marriage in Medina thus
symbolized the original union that was itself "the manifestation of an eternal
syzygy originating in the eternity of the pleroma of the lahut. The First Imam
and Fatima are related to each other in the same reciprocal way as the first
two hypostases [of neoplatonism], `Aql and Nafs, Intelligence and Soul, or
in terms more familiar to us (because they go back to Philo): Logos and
Sophia."79 It is also of some interest to note that Kirmani "finds" Fatima in
the Qur'anic verse quoted here by the Bab (74:36-37).80 An examination of
more traditional commentaries discloses that this exegesis is quite old
indeed. Thus the interpretations of both the Bab and Kirmani represent in
this instance a revivification of ancient religious ideas. 81 Whether the
following striking development also has its roots in the early history of Shi'i
Qur'an interpretation remains to be established. The Bab continues his
commentary on Qur'an 2:29:

Baq, 112.

Cf. Bahrani, al-Sayyid Hashim al-. Kitab al-Burhan fi Tafsir al-Qur'an. 4 vols. Tehran: Chapkhaneh
Aftab, 1375/1955. Vol. 4, 402 and the hadith transmitted by al-Qummi, Mafatih, via the following isnad: al-
Husayn b. Muhammad ... al-Baqir, the fifth Imam who it seems was the first to interpret the verse as such. The
immediate translation for this interpretation would seem to be grammatical. "This is but one of the mighty
portents" translates the Arabic: innaha l'ihda al-kubra modifies the previous litany of three portents: "the moon,
the night, and the dawn." The Qur'an collapse all three in a not-uncharacteristic rhetorical gesture. The tension
between plurality and singularity is represented in the grammatical convention that casts nonhuman plural objects
in the feminine. The grammatical feminine is thus the exception rather than the rule. To the Shi'i exegete such an
anomalous linguistic event is demystified by identifying it with one of the Family of God, in this case the only
female member of that Family, Fatima. It should always be remembered in this context that the Arabic word for
“earth” – ard – is grammatically feminine. That such otherwise superfluous considerations can have irreversible
and long-range effects on doctrine is born out of the example from Christianity. It seems certain that the Johannine
“In the beginning was the Word/logos” was an adjustment to the Septuagint‟s preoccupation with wisdom/Sophia,
precisely because it was felt inappropriate to refer to Jesus by means of a feminine noun. Note the interesting, if
oblique, confirmation of this in the Arabic translation of the New Testament. Here, in the process of changing
logos to kalmia a change in grammatical gender occurs. Yet, the resistance to referring to Jesus by means of a
feminine noun is apparent in the Arabic: fi‟l-bad‟ kana „l-kalima… rather than the grammatical fi‟l-bad‟ kanat al-
kalima… This anomaly is standard in all Arabic translations of the Bible.

> The seven, when they go through the processes of Origination and
> Invention become fourteen manifestations of Origination. And they
> are seven heavens.82

The words fashioned and equal do not convey the exegetical device of
paranomasia with which the Bab conveys this interpretation. The Qur'anic
sawwahunna ("he gave order and perfection") is formed from the same root
as the Qur'anic istawa ("then He turned Himself"). This root, sawiya, can be
variously translated as "leveling," "making smooth," "making equal,"
"ordering." That the world is orderly – cosmos rather than chaos – is a
classic Qur'anic argument for the existence and function of God as orderer
and sustainer. How this ordering and creation is to be explained is of course
controversial. The Bab holds to a distinctive cosmogony entailing twin
creative processes;83 through these the seven heavens are rendered fourteen
– the number of the Family of God. This is a perfect example of the
otherworldly potency of Fatima's creative status: she is not only the "Mother
of her Father" (umm abiha) but the creatrice of her own self and the twelve
Imams as well. Kirmani, as recounted by Corbin, seems acutely apt in this
instance:

> Without the person of Fatima there would be neither the
> manifestation of the Imamate, nor Imamic initiation. For the

> "ego"] ... they are the very substance of pre-eternal Love; they are the
> identity of love, lover, and beloved, that identity which all Sufis have
> aspired to live ....84

As Corbin summarizes; Fatima is the Soul of creation, the Soul of each
creature, "the constitutive part of the human being." Fatima is "the eternally
feminine in man, and that is why she is the archetype of the heavenly Earth;
she is both paradise and initiation into it, for it is she who manifests the

"Without the person of Fatima there would be neither the manifestation of
the Imamate, nor Imamic intitiation."87 Corbin points out that it is in the
light of such theories the Isma'ili epithet Fatima Fatir (Fatima the Creator)
begins to be heard and understood, but this time in a new "key." Fatima, the
"queen of women " – a frequent honorific – should really be understood as
the "sovereign of feminine humanity" where "feminine" equals "meaning,"88
or "the totality of the beings of the Possible [al-imkan]! All creatures have
been created out of the Soul itself, out of the Anima of the holy Imams."89
The Bab will echo this second idea below in his commentary on Qur'an
2:35. Whether the Bab recognized anything like a Jungian "feminine
dimension of humanity" is difficult to say with any certainty at this times.90

Kirmani says the Imams are the brides of the prophet inasmuch as they have
been created from the soul or are the soul of the Prophet. As the Qur'an
[16:74 and 30:20] says, "He has made wives for you out of your own souls."
The real "mother of the believers" is the initiatic function of the Imams. But
this "motherhood" ultimately has its source in Fatima. Spiritual birth
happens through the "Fatimic" agency of the Imams. The Prophet has said,
"I and `Ali are the father and the mother of this community." The Bab
quotes this tradition in his commentary on Qur'an 2:83.91

Corbin, 66.

Ibid., 68.

Ibid., 63.

See the cognate idea carried, for example, in the phrase ara'is al-bayan (the brides of meaning), the
title of an esoteric tafsir by the mystic Ruzbehan Baqli (d. 1209). Just as a verse of poetry is called a bayt (house,
tent), the meaning of the verse is considered the bride waiting within the house or tent.

However 'Abdu‟l-Bahá, the Baha'i leader and thinker (and presumably influenced by the Bab's
ideas), spoke of the "feminization of humanity" as a precondition for the establishment of universal peace: "The
world in the past has been ruled by force, and man has dominated over woman by reason of his more forceful and
aggressive qualities both of body and mind. But the balance is already shifting; force is losing its dominance, and
mental alertness, intuition, and the spiritual qualities of love and service, in which woman is strong, are gaining
ascendancy. Hence the new age will be an age less masculine and more permeated with the feminine ideals, or, to
speak more exactly, will be an age in which the masculine and feminine elements of civilization will be more
evenly balanced" (J. E. Esslemont, Baha u'llah and the New Era, 5th rev. ed. Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust,
1987, 149). This could be a perfect example of how such an idea as "equality of the sexes," which appears
incontestably modem and Western (i.e., foreign to Islam), is in reality a native outgrowth of Islamic culture.

Corbin, 67-68. The Bab's commentary, on Qur'an 2:83, is as follows: "And when We took compact
the Children of Israel: 'You shall not serve any save God; and to be good to parents, and the near kinsman, and to
orphans, and to the needy; and speak good to men, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms.' then you turned

At Qur'an 2:65-66 Fatima as the creative element par excellence appears as
both the true meaning of "the Sabbath" and the primary principle of creation
or "primal command." It is reasonable to ask if Tahirih the Babi was
referring to this when she spoke of "the primal truth" mentioned by Amanat.
There, she is presented as seeing Fatima as a role model.92 It is possible that
she was referring to Fatima as the cosmogonic principle we are discussing.
This is not to say that Tahirih the Babi did not see in Fatima (the mother of
the Imams) a role model. But in line with the metaphysical mood of the time
and place which our texts reflect, it is probable that she was interested in
Fatima's ontological value before her sociological value. We also see in this
commentary a reappearance of the idea introduced at verse 3 of the Fatiha
above: a soul perceives according to its capacity, through himself. It sees
what it is.

The comprehensive or universal dimension of the Fatimid reality is brought
out again in the Bab's commentary on 2:37: "Thereafter Adam received
certain words from his Lord, and turned towards him; truly he turns, and is
All-compassionate" [Qur'an 2:37].

The Bab introduces his discussion by pointing out that words are "single
letters that have been combined." The Family of God represent several
stations with regard to these letters: Muhammad is the point, Ali, Hasan, and
Husayn are each different kinds of alif (viz., layniya, mutaharraka, ghayr
ma`tuf), the letters that do not change form in the Arabic script (dal etc.)
represent the remainder of the Imams. Finally, the status of word is reserved
for Fatima alone, the point being that "meaning" itself is implicated and
articulated through the Fatimid reality. The belief in the Divine unity taught
by the other prophets is in fact created by God himself from this word. In
actual fact, the Bab says, "Adam received certain words" of
acknowledgment of the walaya of the Tree of the Divine Exclusive Unity
that God had forbidden "all other than itself from approaching." But when
the visible form of Fatima was manifest to him, by means of his own self,
God cast into his soul (his huwiya) the likeness of repentance and "He
turned to him."

Typically, the Bab here cites, in rapid and skillful succession, a Tradition
and another Qur'anic verse supporting his tafsir: "The Imam, upon whom be

away, all but a few of you, swerving aside." The Bab says that God is speaking about His "taking compact" with
all created things "in the eight paradises," to recognize the walaya of `Ali. The first of these paradises is the Depth
of Unity (lujjat al-wahda) and is characterized by the command, "You shall not serve any save God ... [and this]
without reference [to anything else]." In the second paradise the compact was taken by moans of recognizing the
Universal Walaya (al-walayat al-kulliya) of the "parents," i.e., Muhammad and 'Ali who are, respectively, the
symbols of universal fatherhood and motherhood. Such recognition, the Bab says, is in reality the good mentioned
in the verse, because to do good means to do good to all according to what each merits. The good that these
particular parents deserve has only been hinted at, because were the Bab to openly (bi'l-tasrih) describe it, the
prattling enemies (mubtilun) would cavil at it. [Baq, 223-24.]

Amanat, Resurrection, 331. No source for this statement is given here.

peace, said: 'We are the words of God.'" "God (al-Haqq)," says the Bab,
"confirms this statement in His mighty Book with the following words."93

> Say: 'If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, the sea would be
> spent before the Words of my Lord are spent, though We brought
> replenishment the like of it." [Qur'an 18:109]

> And the "replenishment" (madad) is origination (ibda') and invention
> (ikhtira`) which God placed under the grade of their lordship. And
> this origination is spent before the light of Fatima is spent. "And [this
> light] is inexhaustible" [wa ma lahu min nifad = Qur'an 38:54].

Fatima is also "the Sabbath":

> And well you know there were those among you that transgressed the
> Sabbath, and We said to them, "Be you apes, miserably slinking!"

(2:65)

> In the presence of the Lord, the meaning (al-murad) of Sabbath is
> Fatima the Resplendent (al-Fatima al-Zahra), because she is the Day
> of the Book. Verily, God has caused all created things to appear
> through her; this is clear. And verily God knows that the people of

> realities are the shadows of her body, according to the degree to
> which she appeared to them through their own souls (la-hum bi-him).
> But they transgressed what God had taught them concerning true
> doctrine (i`tiqad) [namely, they thought] "our [human] realities are in

Kirmani has elaborated on the epithet al-Zahra in a discussion of the
Logos/Intellect. Corbin summarizes: The Intellect is the suprasensory

Baq, 159-60. On shabah: The beings of the pleroma of the lahut are visible only in their apparitional
forms, which are the receptacles of their theophanies (Corbin, 63; cf. Huwayzi, 'Abd `Ali, al-. Kitab Tafsir Nur al-
Thaqalayn. 5 vols. Qum: n.p., 1383/1963-1385/1965,.Vol. 1, 56-57, #142-44). The words are a prayer; the names

the details of this are unknown to me.

calling for visible Form, while the station of Fatima corresponds exactly to
this visible Form: "[The logos] is like the archetypal body, the inner astral
mass of the sun, invisible to human perception, in relation to the visible
Form, which is its aura, brilliance and splendor.... this is why Fatima has
been called by a solar name: Fatima al-Zahra ... the totality of the universe
consists of this light of Fatima.... "95Fatima is furthermore the soul (nafs,
"Anima") of the Imams, "she is the Threshold or Gate (bab) through which
the Imams effuse the gift of their light" she is "all thinkable reality." "Her
eternal Person, which is the secret of the world of the Soul, is also its
manifestation (bayan), without which the creative Principle of the world
would remain unknown and unknowable, forever hidden."96 The Bab's
commentary on 2:66 is similar:

> “And We made it a punishment exemplary for all the former times
> and for the latter, and an admonition to such as are godfearing.”
> [Qur'an 2:66]

> God tells about the evildoers who are opposed [to the true walaya]
> namely, that they allude to God by means of a triple allusion (isharat

> admonition compelling for the godfearing.99

In his discussion of the various levels of the "return" to God (thumma ilayhi
turja una, Qur'an 2:28), the Bab says that God created Fatima from the light
of His essence (nur dhatihi) and that all the prophets have their beginning,
and therefore their return in the Depth of the Exclusive Unity which Depth
was "invented" (ikhtira‟) from the light of the body of Fatima. "And as for
the generality of believers, God originated them from the shadows of the

Ibid., 65.

Baq, 200. This is possibly an allusion to the first three Sunni caliphs whom the Shi'a consider
usurpers of 'Ali's position and breakers of the divine covenant.

That is through pure contemplation, without images or thoughts contaminated by "the world." This is
a reference, one of many throughout the work, to the famous Hadith Kumayl.

Baq, 199-200.

these."100

Another interesting appearance of Fatima in this commentary is her
identification with the Tree that Adam and Eve were commanded to avoid at
Qur'an 2:35. Here the Bab says that the Tree is "absolute contingency –
because all of the manifestations (tajalliyat) are enfolded in it. "Tree,"
shajara, it will be noted, is feminine, so that the Arabic reads "enfolded in
her." This is perfectly analogous to the Imams being enfolded within Fatima
as discussed earlier. Continuing, the Bab says, "As for Adam, God created
the beginning of his existence from the superabundance of the luminous
rays of the body of Fatima."

> And a [created] thing may not “draw nigh” to [anything] beyond its
> origin. So, when Adam “drew nigh” to the Tree of Reality shining

> it, except through an instance of ecstatic consciousness (al-wijdan).
> At the time of such an experience, the "thing drawn nigh unto" is the
> Tree itself and nothing other than it.102

Adam's disobedience is also related to Fatima in the commentary at Qur‟an
2:6: "Verily as for those who disbelieve, it is all the same to them whether
ye warn them or ye warn them not, they will not have faith." Adam's
repentance after his expulsion from the Garden is the result of his having
been made aware of the generosity of Fatima. Adam had shown
covetousness, one of the three sources of kufr according to Ja'far alSadiq,
when he wanted to eat from the Tree.

> The first disobedience of Adam was his desire for the Tree of the
> Divine Inclusive Unity. Indeed, his desire was the very creation of

Ibid., 109-110.

Ibid., 108-9.

Ibid., p. 154. Here it is perhaps an affirmation of the agency and efficacy of the specifically Shi‟I
form of “enlightenment” referred to by Corbin as “instase”. Cf., in this regard, Fritz Meier‟s definition of wijdan
as “being touched inside”. Meier, Fritz. Die “fawa‟ih al-gamal wa fawatih al-galal” des Nagmuddin al-Kubra.
Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner, 1957 fasl 41 & 95; 101 German text. The terms wijdan, derived from wujud “finding”
denotes “ecstasy” in Arabic and “conscience” in Persian. I have combined the two meanings here in “ecstasy of
consciousness” – a paradoxical event of awareness in which there is no distinction between object and subject, and
therefore – according to the implied syllogism – no awareness. Wijdan can also connote an intensification or
“thickening” of the experience of being/existence analogous, perhaps, to poetry (Dichtung) as a thickening of the
experience of language. The language here is also another explicit reference to the Hadith Kumayl.

Love and Authority

We close this survey of Fatima in the Bab's tafsir with the subject that
opened the study, namely walaya, "spiritual authority," and its dimension of
love (mahabba). At verse 3 of Surat al-Baqara, the subject of Absolute
Walaya is encountered. Here the Qur'anic statement "those who perform the
prayer" is said by the Bab to imply general obedience to Muhammad and his
Trustees (or: Legatees, awsiya) and his Progeny (nabt) through the Most
Great Absolute Walaya (al-walaya almutlaqa al-kubra). While in other
statements Absolute Walaya was linked to 'Ali alone,104 here it includes all
of the Imams. In the same section walaya is identified with tawhid,
affirmation of the divine unity. The Bab says that the act of prayer (salat)
"from beginning to end" is the "form for affirming divine uniqueness" (surat
al-tafrid), the "temple (haykal) for affirming the divine unity (tawhid)," and
the "visible form (or: pre-vivified form, shabah) of walaya." This being the
case, only the actual bearers of walaya are able to perform it properly
because it is the foremost station of distinction between the Beloved
(mahbub, i.e., God) and the lover. The Family of God (al Allah =
Muhammad, Fatima, and the 12 Imams) are the true bearers of the meaning
of the divine love mentioned in the famous hadith qudsi: "I was a hidden
treasure and desired to be known, therefore I created mankind in order to be
known." This love (mahabba) was manifested (tajalla) by God to them by
means of their own selves (la-hum bi-him), to such a degree of exclusivity

Ibid., pp. 45-46 Cf. Tusi, al-Tibyan, vol. 1, pp. 59-60: This verse was revealed about Abu Jahl
according to al-Rabi' b. Anis, and al-Balkhi and al-Maghribi chose this; according to. Ibn Abbas, it was sent down
about the Jewish leaders around Mecca; some say it was sent down about the Arab idolators. Tabari chose Ibn
'Abbas: "We say rather that the verse has a general meaning."

Baq, p. 195.

that this divine love subsists only through them, and pure servitude appears
only in them.

The Bab continues to say that the Family of God are the places (mahall)
where servitude and all lordship ('ubudiyat and rububiyat) distinguish
themselves, implying that it is through their act of servitude that they have
been invested with the rank of lordship in relation to others.

> Whoever, then, confesses the truth of their walaya in “the region of
> pure servitude” has in fact performed the prayer according to all the
> stations of the Merciful One. And he who performs the prayer [this
> way] also "pierces the veils of glory” (subuhat al-jalal) and enters
> the house of glory (bayt al-jalal), where such a one will eternally
> dwell     in    the protecting shade of           their   walaya.105

At verse 62, the term Absolute Walaya is associated again with the entire
Family of God, because they are sanctified servants who do nothing of their
own wills, but rather the will of God: "Surely they that believe, and those of
Jewry, and the Christians, and those Sabaeans, whoso believes in God and
the Last Day, and works righteousness – their reward awaits them with their
Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow."

The "works of righteousness" mentioned in this verse therefore are
described as being represented, par excellence, by the act of recognizing the
Absolute Walaya of the Family of God; and "their reward awaits them with
'Ali." In the context of the verse itself, the suggestion is that non-Muslims
are implicated in the responsibility of recognizing the authority of 'Ali and
the Family of God. This may offer an indication of the way in which
"absolute" (mutlaq) is to be understood. It should be noted that the last
phrase of the above verse is repeated at Qur'an 10:62 , where it is
specifically "the friends of God" (awliya' allah) who will neither grieve nor
sorrow. Such cross references and correspondences are most certainly not
accidental, particularly in this case where the later verse corroborates this
interpretation by virtue of its vocabulary (awliya'plural of wali).106

Love as a synonym for walaya is of course not new with the Bab, but it is
important that this aspect of walaya be constantly kept in mind as a means
of holding the other connotations of the term, such as "authority" and
"power," in perspective. This equivalence led Corbin to state that Shi'ism is
pre-eminently a religion of spiritual love107 – a very large assertion that must
be considered in the somewhat ratified context of Corbin's preoccupations.
However, insofar as devotion to the walaya of the Imam represents, in
essence, an act of love, the assertion seems to stand.

This is perhaps an example of the antinomian motif so prominent in certain so-called extremist Shi'i
texts and teachings.

Baq, 195-96.

E.g., Encyclopedia of Islam, 1st ed., i, 285-303 and iii, 210.

In the commentary on Qur'an 2:23, "love" is again associated with walaya.
The Bab says:

> None can attain to the Depth of the Exclusive Divine Unity (lujjat al-
> ahadiya) except by means of his ('Ali‟s) walaya. It is the goal
> (maqsud) of your existence (wujudi-kum), because God has made
> you for the sake of this love (mahabba). And He has put His life
> (hayat) and His might ('izz) in it, to the extent that such is possible in
> the contingent world – if only you understood .

Love is related to the idea of knowledge/ma' rifa (gnosis), by virtue of the
"theosophical" axiom: the more one knows the more one loves, and the
more one loves the more one knows. This axiom is represented in the
Islamic instance by the Tradition of the Hidden Treasure, quoted above:
God's love or desire to be known set the terms of spiritual development for
"all time." True knowledge is attained through love and devotion, and if this
devotion be tested through hardship, the love, and therefore the attendant
knowledge (or vice versa) is the purer. All of the Family of God suffered,
but perhaps none more than Fatima, who as the mother of all suffers doubly.
In his commentary on Qur'an 2:25, the Bab states that "the Garden," that is,
Paradise, is indeed the love of the visible form of Fatima (mahabbat shabah
Fatima).

> But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness,
> that their portion is Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Every time
> they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: "Why, this is what we
> were fed with before." For they are given things in similitude
> (mutashabihan); and they have therein companions pure (and holy);
> and they abide therein forever. [2:25]

> For the people of inner knowledge "God gave glad tidings to those
> who believe" in Muhammad and do righteous deeds with regard to
> his Trusteeship by means of allegiance to 'Ali. For them await
> gardens, and these [gardens] are the love (hubb) of Fatima
> underneath which are rivers, meaning the two Hasans [ i.e., al-Hasan
> and al-Husayn). ... the fourth [river] is of red wine, flowing for the
> fragmentation (kasr) of all things and their refashioning (sawgh)
> according to the divine signs and tokens. And by it the love bodies
> (al-ajsad ab-mahabba) of the Shi'a of the Pure Family of God are
> reddened. And God fashioned in this river the forms of the believers.
> And God wrote at its head; "Love of the Shi'a of Ali is My fortress
> (hisni). Therefore, he who enters My fortress is secure from My
> chastisement." Every one who drinks from a river: they say, "This is
> that" in which God has put all the lights of the four signs [i.e.,
> tawhid, nubuwwa, imama, shi'a).... And there for them shall be

> spouses purified and virtuous ... And they shall dwell forever in the
> love of Fatima.108

Given the dramatic role played by Tahirih – as the reappearance of Fatima-
in the formation and development of the Babi religion, such words as these
of the Bab's give us an enhanced understanding of the sources of her
authority and influence and raise the question, Must a challenge to the status
quo entail a break with the past?
