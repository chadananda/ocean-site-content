> **Abstract:** In the late 19th century Jamal Effendi and Sayyid Mustafa Rumi made a journey to the Dutch East Indies (now the Republic of Indonesia) to establish the Bahá'í Faith there. This paper presents the results of an attempt to recover more details of that journey by using Dutch colonial sources. It focuses on Jamal and Rumi's sojourn on the island of Celebes (now Sulawesi) as it was there that they achieved what might be considered to be one of their main successes: the conversion of the king and queen of Boné.
