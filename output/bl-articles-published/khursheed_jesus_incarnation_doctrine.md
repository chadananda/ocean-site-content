Abstract

This paper shows that the Baha'i approach to the sonship and divinity of
Christ is consistent with Old and New Testament usage. It also examines
the Incarnation Doctrine and shows that its roots are to be traced to pagan
influences creeping into Christian belief in the early centuries of its
growth.

Introduction

Among Christians throughout centuries, the concept of Jesus as Son of
God or even as God Incarnate has become a common notioa Only a few
theologians and historians have paused to examine what it means or
meant.

The Incarnation Doctrine was formally declared to be a fundamental pillar
to the Christian faith at a council that met in 325 A.D. in the town of
Nicea, now called Iznik, in Eastern Turkey. There, representatives of the
early Christian churches signed a document which stated the following:
"We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ the only Son of God, eternally
begotten of the Father. God from God, Light from Light, true God from
true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father. Through him
all things were made."1. Most Christian churches share this declaration,
now known as the Nicene Creed, all over the world in surprising unity.

48             THE SINGAPORE BAHA'I STUDIES REVIEW
Historically, the belief in Jesus as God incarnate has not only divided
Christians from Jews and Muslims, but also sadly used to justify
persecutions, crusades and pogroms. Nowadays, as people of different
religions are coming into closer contact with one another, the Incarnation
Doctrine is under greater scrutiny. A growing number of people, not only
those belonging to religions other than Christianity, are questioning its
validity. In the modern inter-faith dialogue, the Incarnation Doctrine is
often associated with an exclusive stance of Christian superiority with
respect to other religions, and is one of the major obstacles towards
achieving a higher level of inter-religious harmony.

This paper sets out to demonstrate a close correlation between the sonship
and divinity of Christ as it appears in the Bible and the Baha'i writings. It
argues that the Incarnation Doctrine is not something which can be
supported from the Bible, but rather, arosefromhistorical circumstances
that surrounded the growth of the Christian faith in its early centuries.

1\. "Son of God"

1\.1 The Old Testament

What did the "Son of God" title mean to the Jews who met Christ? There
are no certain answers to this question, but from a study of the Jewish
scriptures, we can conclude that there were at least three possible ways in
which the Jews would have understood this title. The first usage is in
tarns of angels or heavenly beings. The second meaning signifies the
Israelites or people of Israel. The third usage of the Son of God torn is
associated with the anointed kings of Israel.

Since in the Gospels stress is specifically placed upon Jesus being
descended from David, and all otha descriptions of him refa to a living
human being, the first category is not consistent with the New Testament
usage.
The second meaning encompasses a wide variety of different usages that
all relate to the Israelites collectively and individually. The Israelites are
referred to as "children of the Lord", in the sense that they are chosen by

Jesus the Son of God and the Incarnation Doctrine              49

God, a holy people, and bear likeness to God. "Ye are the children of the
Lord your God... For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and
the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all
the nations that are upon the earth" (Deut. 14:1).

It is stated that Israel is Goďs son whose purpose is to serve God. When
instructing Moses on what to say to the Pharaoh, God states: "And thou
shalt say unto the Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my
first born. And I say unto thee, let my son go, that he may serve thee."
(Exodus 4:22-23)

When the Israelites wanted to make mention of "the loving kindnesses of
the Lord, the praises of the Lord" (Isaiah 63:7), they recalled how the
Lord was Israel's saviour, how He had trust in them as His honest
"children", "Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he
was their Saviour" (Isaiah 63: 8). When the Israelites prayed for God's
guidance, they stated that in contrast to their physical descendants, God
was their true Father, the one who had always guided and "redeemed"
them: "Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us,
and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O Lord, art our father, our redeemer,
thy name is from everlasting" (Isaiah 63:16).

In Psalm 82.6, the Israelites are referred to as "gods" and the "children of
the most High". This statement appears in a passage which starts by
describing God's justice, "God standeth in the congregation of the
mighty, he judgeth among gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, and
accept the persons of the wicked?... Defend the poor and fatherless: do
justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out
of the hand of the wicked..." (Ps. 82:1-4). Obviously here, the Israelites
are taken to be those who judge alongside God, and those who carry out
God's judgement. Part of their task is to protect the "poor and needy"
from the "wicked", and in this respect, they are stated to be fallible "gods"
who have fallen short of their high purpose. The Jews as "gods" and
"sons of the most High" are the "congregation of the mighty" whose
purpose is to execute God's judgements.

50            THE SINGAPORE BAHA'I STUDIES REVIEW
These passages show that the Israelites were considered to be "sons of
God" because they were His holy servants who declared God's glory and
justice, and were specially chosen to carry out His purpose.

The Son of God title is also given to King David, and at other times,
refers to a special Israelite ruler who is destined to carry out God's
punishment.
King David is called 'my son', T will be his father, and he will be my son'
(2 Sam. 7:14). Elsewhere David is referred to as the 'first born' of God,
'He will say to me, 'Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my
salvation. Also I will make him myfirst-born,higher than the kings of the
earth' (Ps. 89:26-7). Six verses before this passage, David is referred to
as 'my servant', and the specific reference of the King being anointed is
made, "I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed
him: with whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
strengthen him" (Ps 89: 20-1). In the context of a special Israelite ruler,
God speaks of a king as his Son who will punish other nations, "Yet have
I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. T will declare the decree: the
Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee'
"(Ps 2:7).

1\.2 The New Testament

In the New Testament, references to "Son of God" are consistent with Old
Testament usage. In John 10:34, Jesus specifically defines what is meant
by the "Son of God" title. Some Jews accused him of blasphemy and wore
ready to stone him for it (John 10:33). Jesus in response states that "Is it
not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods, unto
whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken, Say ye
of him, whom the father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, thou
blasphemest because I said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of
my Father, believe me not. But if I do, though ye believe me not, believe
the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I
in him" (John 10: 34-38). In this passage, Jesus clearly explains that the
Son of God term refers to those "to whom the word of God came", that is,
to whom God had entrusted to carry His message. Jesus also makes it
clear that this term especially applies to him, whom the Father had
"sanctified, and sent into the world". These words demonstrate that the

Jesus the Son of God and the Incarnation Doctrine            51

unity of God and Christ was one of purpose, not of substance and is quite
consistent with the Old Testament usage.

In the first chapter of John's gospel the term "sons of God" is used for
those who came to believe in Christ. Faith in the message of Christ is
equated with being born "of God": "But as many as received him, to them
gave he power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on his
name. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God" (John 1:12-13). A few verses later, "the only begotten
Son" is related to Jesus being a sign of God, who "declared him": No man
hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom
of the Father, he hath declared him" (John 1:18). These passages show
that Christ was a Son amongst sons of God His life and message was die
channel through which God could be known. They do not imply that God
was unknown to the Jews before Christ appeared, but through his coming
a much fuller knowledge of God was made possible.

As in the Old Testament, there are references in the New Testament to the
Jews becoming the children of God through acquiring spiritual qualities.
In the Sermon on the Mount, it is stated that, "Blessed are the
peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" (Matth. 5:9).
This is also true for those who love their enemies, "love your enemies,
bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you. That ye may be the
children of your Father which is in heaven." (Matth. 5:44-45). Hare, a
spiritual kinship with God is made through acquiring spiritual perfection,
bearing likeness to God's attributes. Chapter 5 of Matthew ends with, "Be
ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect".
The "only begotten Son of God" (John 1:18) in this context conveys the
spiritual perfection of Christ.

There are also many passages in the New Testament, which relate to the
Old Testament usage of royal sonship. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is
addressed to by an angel in these words: "And, behold, thou shalt
conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name
Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and
the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David" (Luke
1:31-32). The connection to the Old Testament where David is addressed

52               THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW
by God as "You are my son, today I have begotten you" (Ps. 2:7) is
evident.

The royal sonship usage is also apparent in the Aramaic title Masiah
(Messiah, the anointed one), by which his followers frequently addressed
him. The word 'Christ' derives from a Greek translation of this title
(Christos) and is interchangeable with 'Messiah'. Peter, the first disciple
of Jesus, states that, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God"
(Math. 16:16), which can equally be translated as "Thou art the Messiah,
the Son of the living God". The same link is made by a high priest who
questioned Jesus by asking, "I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell
us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God" (Matth. 26: 63, Luke
14:61). Here it is clear that many who came into contact with Jesus
expected him to be a King like David, who had been anointed with "holy
oil" (Ps 89: 20).

Jesus made it clear that he was only partially the 'Messiah' of Jewish
tradition. In response to Pilate's question, "Art thou the King of the
Jews", he stated "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18: 35-36). The
other Gospels for the same passage report Jesus replying, "Thou sayest
it" (Luke 23: 3, Mark 15: 2, Matth. 27: 11). In the Gospel of Matthew,
Jesus affirms he is the Messiah to Peter (Matth. 16: 17), but for the
corresponding passage in the Gospels of Mark and Luke, Jesus instructs
his disciples to "tell no man" (Mark 8: 30, Luke 9: 18).

2\. The Son of Man

The Son of Man title occurs a total of 77 times in the New Testament,
compared to the Son of God title that appears about 40 times, and is the
mostfrequentway by which Jesus refers to himself.

The "Son of Man" was an Aramaic expression, "Bar nasha", which "was
a synonym for 'man', and a substitute for the indefinite pronoun"2. It has
several usages in the Old Testament. In Ezekiel, it is used to denote a
simple 'human being'; in Psalm 8, it means a man weak and insignificant,

but destined for authority second only to that of God; in the visions of
Daniel (Dan. 7: 13-22), after four beasts which symbolise successive
despotic empires, comes "one like a Son of Man" (Dan. 7: 13), signifying
the "saints of the Most High" (Dan. 7:18) to whom God is about to
entrust his judgement and his kingdom.

While the Son of God is a generic term which was not only used for
Christ but for King David, and sons of God were used for the Jewish
people, collectively and individually, the Son of Man title is much more
specific. In its highest sense, it denoted thefigurewhom the Jewish people
believed would usher in the Kingdom of God on earth.

The references in the New Testament are all consistent with the Old
Testament usage. In the sense of "Bar Nasha" or simple "human being",
an example can be found in the reply Jesus makes to a scribe who offers
to follow him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests;
but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head" (Matth. 8:20, cf. Luke
9:58). It is interesting to note that to the question posed by the high priest
Caiaphas asking whether Jesus was the "Messiah, Son of God" (Matth.
26: 63), Jesus responds by saying, "Thou hast said: nevertheless I say
unto you, Hereafter thou shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right
hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven". (Matth. 26: 64,
Mark 14: 62, Luke 22: 69). Here Jesus does not affirm or reject the
Messiah title, instead, he refers to the "Son of Man" mentioned by the
prophet Daniel, who will come "with the clouds of heaven" (Daniel 7:13).
Whether he himself will be this Son of Man to come, is not clear. But
there can be no doubt that Jesus shows more concern for the coming of
the Kingdom of God, than in engaging in disputes about the titles
attributed to him.

3\. The Word of God

Just as there are occasions of Jesus declaring his unity with God, there are
as many instances where a clear distinction between Jesus and the Father
is made. Citing the "abomination of desolation" (Mark 13: 14) spoken of
by the prophet Daniel, Jesus states that: twBut of that day and that hour
knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son,

54               THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES4 REVIEW
but the Father" (Mark 13: 32). When someone refers to Jesus as "Good
Master", Jesus responds by saying, "Why callest me thou good? there is
none good but one, that is God" (Mark 10:18). In John's Gospel Jesus
makes clear this distinction when he states quite categorically that, "for
the Father is greater than I" (John 14: 28). These passages suggest that
Jesus was not in any way co-equal with God.

It might be argued that there is evidence to support the declaration of the
Nicene Creed in the opening words of St John's Gospel, "In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The
same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and
without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and
the life was the light of men" (John 1:1-4). This passage indicates that
Jesus was pre-existent to creation, God's co-creator, and the eternal
instrument of God's revelation. But is this enough to make Jesus co-
substantial with God, the 'God from God, Light from Light' in the Nicene
Creed?

How would the Jews living in the first century A.D. have interpreted the
'Word of God as mentioned in John's Gospel? It would not have sounded
so unique, since in their own tradition there was already an example of
eternal co-existence with God in the form of 'Wisdom'. Philo of
Alexandria, a contemporary of Jesus and a well known Jewish
Neoplatonist philosopher, equated Wisdom with the Word (Logos in
Greek) of God3.

In Jewish tradition, 'Wisdom' is personified as a female figure, (hokhma
in Hebrew and Sophia in Greek), who was "brought up" with God, who
was with God before creation, whose "delights were with the sons of
men". In Proverbs it is stated that: "I lead in the way of righteousness, in
the midst of the paths of judgement: "The Lord possessed me in the
beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from
everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were
no depths I was brought forth....When he prepared the heavens, I was
there....Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily
his delight, rejoicing always before him; Rejoicing in the habitable part of

his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. Now therefore
hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways...
For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the Lewd"
(Proverbs 8: 20-35). This description of Wisdom, as the eternal mediatrix
of God's revelation and creation, bears striking resemblance to the
attributes of the "Word of God" in John's Gospel.

Further evidence to support this view comes from the wider source of
ancient Jewish writings. From the Wisdom of Solomon writings, part of
the Apocrypha, accepted to be canonical by Roman Catholics and
Orthodox churches, Wisdom is described in such words: "like a fine mist
she rises from the power of God, a clear effulgence from the glory of the
Almighty; so nothing defiled can enter her by stealth. She is the radiance
that streams from everlasting light, the flawless mirror of the active power
of God, and the image of his goodness. She is but one, yet can do all
things; herself unchanging, she makes all things new; age after age she
enters into holy souls, and makes them friends of God and prophets"
(Wisdom 7: 25-27).

Hare Wisdom is stated to periodically enter the world, and incarnate in the
lives of "holy souls". Wisdom in these writings is described as the source
of creation, whose "skill made all things" (Wisdom 7: 22).

On the basis of such beliefs, an elaborate myth of Wisdom was created in
ancient Jewish tradition: Wisdom was first God's companion in heaven,
then she became a medium for his revelation. Rejected by mankind, she
returned back to dwell with God in heaven again. This myth is depicted in
the writings of Enoch, part of the Jewish Pseudepigrapha composed
during the last two centuries B.C., "Wisdom found no place in which she
could dwell, but a dwelling place was found for her in the heavens. The
Wisdom went forth to dwell with the children of the people, but she found
no dwelling place. So Wisdom returned to her own place, and she settled
permanently among the angels"4.

John's Gospel elaborates a theme already known to the Jews and does not
make Jesus God's equal. The early Christians were also aware of iu as

1 Enoch chapter 42: 1-2, quoted by T. Sheehan, The First Coming, p 211
56            THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW
apparent in the Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews in which it is written,
"God, who at sundry times and in clivers manners spake in time past unto
the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his
Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
worlds" (Hebrews 1:1-2).

4\. The Virgin Birth

Another piece of evidence that is sometimes used to support the belief that
Jesus was of the same substance of God, "God of God", is the manner by
which he was conceived by his mother Mary. How would the Jews have
understood the virgin birth? Did it establish proof of Jesus as the Son of
God in a physical sense?

In the Old Testament, there are several instances where prophets are born
from divine intervention. The legendary births of Isaac, Jacob and Samuel
were all cases where their respective mother's incapacity to give birth was
healed by acts of divine intervention. In Jewish tradition, miraculous
births were a distinguishing sign for someone destined to become
important.

The New Testament records that the prophet John the Baptist also was
conceived by an act of divine interventioa In fact when an Angel informs
Mary that she will bear a child, and Mary replies that, "How shall this be,
seeing I know not a man?" (Luke 1: 34), the Angel cites the case of
Elizabeth, John the Baptist's mother, who was pregnant even though she
was of "old age". The Angel says, "And behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she
hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with
her, who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible"
(Luke 1: 36-37). These last words echo the words addressed to Sarah,
mother of Isaac, who was also barren, when she laughed about the
possibility of her bearing a child. In Genesis it is recorded that God
replied "Is there any thing too hard for the Lord?" (Gen. 18: 14). The
New Testament record of the miraculous birth is entirely consistent with
Old Testament tradition and was unlikely to have suggested to the Jews
that Jesus was sired by God.

Another example of a miraculous birth connected with the Son of God is
to be found in the story of the high priest Melchisedec mentioned in the
books of Genesis (14: 18-20) and Psalms (110: 4). In the New Testament
great respect is paid to Melchisedec, who is described as "priest of the
Most high God" and "King of peace" (Hebrews 7: 1-2), and of whom it is
written that he was, "without father, without mother, without descent,
having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the
Son of God; abideth a priest continually" (Hebrews 7: 3). Jesus is
identified to be the "priest forever after the order of Melchisedec" as
prophesied in Psalms 110: 4 (cf. Hebrews 7: 17), and therefore the virgin
birth of Jesus would have been accepted by the newly converted Jews to
be entirely in keeping with the high rank of priesthood attributed to him.

5\. Christ and the Gentiles

After the death of Jesus, his brother James led the church in Jerusalem,
and Peter gave his approval to teach the Gospel to the Gentiles. But it was
the apostle Paul, a Hellenistic Jewish convert, who became the chief
missionary to the Gentiles. What was Paul's massage to the Gentiles? Did
he teach that Jesus was co-equal with God?

It is clear from the letters of Paul that he interprets the sonship of Jesus in
a symbolic sense, one which is more by adoption rather than of the same
substance as God. For Paul, those who received the "Spirit of God" were
"sons of God". In fact Paul refers to the followers of Jesus as Goďs "joint
heirs with Christ". He states that, "For as many are led by the Spirit of
God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of
bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit by adoption,
whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our
spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of
God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we
may also be glorified together" (Romans 8:14-17, Gal. 4: 4-7).

Paul never stated Jesus was God, but several times he refers to him as the
"image of God" (2 Col. 4:4), "the brightness of his glory, and express
image of his person" (Hebrews 1: 3, cf. Col. 1: 15, 2 Cor. 4:4). He also
refers to Christ as the "first born of every creature", and adds that, "For

58            THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ'Í STUDIES REVIEW

by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth,
visible and invisible. And he is before all things, and by him all things
consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning,
the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre­
eminence" (Gol. 1: 15-18). Here, there are elements of the Wisdom myth,
where Jesus is considered to be the instrument of creation. It is clear that
"first born of every creature" here refers to both "pre-eminence" as well
as pre-existence in time, but it is particularly his importance with respect
to his God-like qualities which is emphasised. Speaking in relation to the
"Father", Paul states that in Jesus "Should all fullness dwell" (Col. 1:19).
This means that Jesus was considered to be a full reflection of God, while
his servants, were understood to be imperfect images of God.

How did the Gentiles understand the person of Jesus? Did they understand
him in the sense taught by Paul, to be the full reflection of Goďs image?
The Gentile world was largely polytheist, and the Jewish insistence on the
unity and fatherhood of God, Who historically chose the Jewish people to
be His "children" was a difficult message for them to assimilate.

There are indications in the New Testament that the polytheism of the
Gentiles presented a serious obstacle to their acceptance of the Christian
message. From Acts 14: 6-19 the reaction of the Gentiles to the preaching
of the Gospel is made clear. It describes how once Paul and Barnabas,
another believer, went to Lystra in Lycaonia and they saw a man "cripple
from his mother's womb". "Perceiving that he had faith to be healed" they
ordered him to walk "and when the people saw what Paul had done" they
said "the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. And they
called Barnabas, Jupiter and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief
speaker." Then they started offering sacrifices and Paul and Barnabas
rent their clothes and ran among them saying "we also are men of like
passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these
vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea,
and all things that are therein... And with these sayings scarce restrained
they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them". This passage
indicates the kind of difficulties that the early Christian apostles had in
spreading the Gospel to the Gentile world. Here, Paul and Barnabas had
to vigorously deny being gods after healing a cripple. Not only were they

thought to be gods incarnate in human form, but they were associated
with the specific deities of Jupiter and Mercurius.

The New Testament records a story concerning Herod Agrippa I,
governor of Judea (41-4 A.D.), Herod the Great's grandson, who was
punished by God for not denying himself to be a god (Acts 12:1-23).
Herod attended the quadrennial Roman games at Caesarea, appearing in
dazzling robes of silver and, addressing the people there, "made an oration
unto them". The crowd were so impressed by his "royal apparel", that
they said it is "a voice of a god, and not a man". Herod failed to reprove
them, and as a result, received divine chastisement, "And immediately the
angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he
was eaten of worms, and gave up the Ghost".

The story of Herod illustrates how easily the pagans could acclaim that a
man was a god. It also indicates how the early apostles considered it to be
a fatal blasphemy for a Jew to think in these terms. The Son of God title
was also apt to cause confusion. It was used for the Ptolemaic King of
Egypt, son of the sun god Helios, and also for the Emperor of Rome, who
from Augustus onwards bears the titles, 'Son of God', 'son of Zeus' 5 .
There was even a story about Alexander the Great, who is credited as
being a half-human half god hybrid. He was said to have been conceived
through the god Zeus before his parents had consummated their marriage,
and was known as the Son of Zeus6.

The beliefs of the pagan population to whom the early Christian apostles
preached were characterised with a varied mixture of Greek myths and
mystery cults. The old Greek mystery religions of Demeter, Dionysos and
Orpheus were augmented by still others coming from the East such as the
cults of Isis and Osiris from Egypt, of Cybele and Atilis from Phrygia, of
Atargatis and Adonis from Syria, and later from Persia, the religion of the
Aryan deity Mithra. These beliefs were expressed in the form of rites and
ceremonies where the participants associated themselves with a god who

died or disappeared, and who then either returned to life or in some other
way shared divine power with the initiates7.

The early Christians were not immune to the mystery cult influence, and
many Gentiles who converted to the Christian message integrated it into
their owns myths. One such group was the Christian Gnostics, who based
their beliefs on the secret sayings of Christ and produced their own
versions of the recorded gospel8. They believed themselves to be the
chosen elects for which the Gospel had come, and did not accept the
authority of the churches. They linked Jesus to a variety of different forms
of personal experience in other traditions and de-emphasised his
appearance as a historical figure who lived and preached amongst the
Jews. Some groups of Gnostics wore so extreme in this respect, such as
the Docetists, that they even denied that Jesus had ever appeared in human
form, they maintained that Christ had been pure spirit9.

The early Christian leaders were at pains to eliminate Gnostic beliefs from
within their own churches. There are clear signs of this in the New
Testament. In the first epistle of the apostle John, it is stated: "Beloved,
believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God:
because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye
the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in
thefleshis of God. And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ
is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of anti-Christ,
whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in
the world" (1 John 4:1-3). Here John is providing a test by which Gnostic
beliefs from within the Church can be outlawed.

6\. The Council of Nicea

During the second century A.D., there emerged two schools of thought
about the nature of Jesus. The church based in Alexandria began to

\[7\] see T. Sheehan, The First Coming, p 206-209

\[8\] Ian Wilson, "Jesus: The Evidence", p 24-5

\[9\] ibid., p 129-130

preach that Jesus was never bounded by the normal physical constraints
of men. Bishop Clement of Alexandria stated that Jesus only "took food
and ate it in order that we should not teach about him in a Docetic
fashion"10. In the third century A.D, the Alexandrian church came much
closer to a theology based upon the belief that Jesus was God incarnate.
Archdeacon Athanasius, lata* to become the city's bishop, wrote "The
Word disguised himself by appearing in a body... by the works he did in
the body showed himself to be, not man, but God"11.

Meanwhile, the church based at Antioch, whose jurisdiction included the
birthplace of Jesus, accepted the divinity of Jesus without suggesting that
he was in any way co-equal to God. Bishop Lucian of Antioch for
instance (about a century after Christ), had taught that the message of
Jesus was more important than the theology surrounding the nature of
Jesus. By the beginning of the third century A.D, the priest Arius, taught
by Lucian and excommunicated by Alexandria's Bishop, Alexander,
brought the theological dispute between the two churches to a breaking
point. The dispute was sufficiently intractable that Emperor Constantine
was called upon to adjudicate. He decided to hold a council in Nicea to
heal the divisions between the Bishops.

It might seem odd that a political leader played such an important role in
what was essentially a theological issue. Constantine had not yet even
converted to the Christian faith when the council of Nicea took place. So
why was Constantine's authority sought on the matter? The answer might
lie in the way Constantine captured Rome more than a decade earlier.
According to legend, on the basis of a premonition, he had ordered his
soldiers to paint the Greek letters Chi-Rho on their shields in a monogram
that had been adopted by the Christians as a symbol of their belief. Most
probably this was a way to obtain the support from a group on the other
side of the walls of an otherwise impregnable city. In any case, from the
day of his successful conquest of Rome, as is well known, Constantine
became a champion of the Christian cause and greatly assisted in its
growth, stopping the persecutions against the Christians. As emperor of

\[10\] ibid., p 138

\[11\] ibid.

the recently re-unified Roman Empire, the quarrel between the churches of
Antioch and Alexandria was an important concern.
At Nicea, the two rival Christian groups fought for days on the formula to
adopt as a creed for the believers, and it was Constantine who resolved
the issue by taking sides with the Alexandrian church. Very few delegates
at the assembly were able to directly oppose the pressure exerted by the
Emperor, but later, some expressed regret at having signed the Nicene
formula. A group of Bishops who attended the Council, later wrote a
letter to Constantine confessing that, "We committed an impious act, O
Prince, by subscribing to a blasphemyfromfear of you"12.

What prompted Constantine to support the Alexandrian view is difficult
to say. But it is clear that the notion of a man being an incarnation of a
god was not unfamiliar to him. The deification of a man for Constantine
was nothing special. His father had already been deified, and he would be
accorded the same honour after his own death.

7\. A Baha'i perspective

The Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, Shoghi Effendi states that, "As to the
position of Christianity, let it be stated without any hesitation or
equivocation that its divine origin is unconditionally acknowledged, that
the Sonship and Divinity of Jesus Christ are fearlessly asserted"13. At the
same time, Shoghi Effendi writes, "that invisible yet rational God Who,
however much we extol the divinity of His Manifestations on earth, can in
no wise incarnate His infinite, His unknowable, His incorruptible and all-
embracing Reality in the concrete and limited frame of a mortal being.
Indeed, the God Who could so incarnate His own reality would, in the
light of the teachings of Baha'uTlah, cease immediately to be God"14.

(USA), 1980, p 109-110

\[14\] Shoghi Effendi, "The World Order of Baha'uTlah", Baha'i Publishing Trust,
Wilmette (USA), 1974, p 112

If the Incarnation Doctrine is rejected, what is the Baha'i understanding of
the opening passage of John's Gospel which states that, "In the beginning
was the Word, and the word was with God, and the Word was God..."?
'Abdu'1-Bahá' explains it in terms of a mirror analogy: "The Spirit and
the Word mean the divine perfections that appeared in the Reality of
Christ, and these perfections were with God; so the sun manifests all its
glory in the mirror. For the Word does not signify the body of Christ, no,
but the divine perfections manifested in Him. For Christ was like a clear
mirror which was facing the Sun of Reality; and the perfections of the
Sun of Reality - that is to say, its light and heat - were visible and
apparent in this mirror. If we look into the mirror, we see the sun, and we
say, "it is the sun"15. 'Abdu'1-Bahá goes on to state, "That is why Christ
says in the Gospel, "The Father is in the Son" (John 14:11, 17:21) - that
is to say, the Sun of Reality appears in the mirror"16.

These passages suggest that Christ was more than an inspired man. The
perfect mirror is innately different to other objects. All objects scatter and
reflect the sun's light to some extent, and indeed each object is in its own
way a sign of the sun, or 'image' of the sun. The spotless mirror however,
in this sense is pre-eminent among all objects. Likewise, Jesus is pre-
eminent in creation, because in his life and teachings, God's image is
reflected more fully than anywhere else. 'Abdu'1-Bahá explains that, "the
perfections of Christ are called the Word because all the beings are in the
condition of letters, and one letter has not complete meaning, while
perfections of Christ have the power of the word because a complete
meaning can be inferred from a word"17.

Another aspect of the Word of God is that it periodically incarnates in
human form to spiritually regenerate mankind. 'Abdu'1-Bahá states that,
"Before appearing in the human form, the Word of God was in the utmost
sanctity and glory, existing in perfect beauty and splendour in the height
of its magnificence. When through the wisdom of God the Most High it

1984, p 206

\[16\] ibid., p 207

\[17\] ibid., p 206-7

shonefromthe heights of glory in the world of the body../'18. In his tablet
of Wisdom, Baha'uTlah states that the "Word of God is the cause which
hath preceded the contingent world - a world which is adorned with the
splendours of the Ancient of Days, yet is being renewed and regenerated
at all times"19.

The BaháT approach to the true nature of Christ is not only consistent
with the Word of God in the New Testament, but also with the Wisdom
(Sophia) of the Old Testament. Baha'uTlah refers to a female figure as
the "Maid of Heaven"20 who is sent down to reflect the "beauteous image
of the Almighty" in "all created things" and with whom a convenant was
made from "time immemorial"21. There is also a striking parallel in
Baha'uTlah's 'Tablet of the Holy Mariner' with the passage from Enoch
already quoted, which describes the journey of Wisdom amongst men, her
subsequent rejection and return to heaven4. Referring to one of the
"maidens of heaven", Baha'uTlah writes that she "...descended with such
an adorning as to illumine the heavens and all that is therein...When she
reached that place she rose to her full height in the midmost heart of
creation...and sought to inhale their fragrance at a time that knoweth
neither beginning nor end...she found not in them that which she did
desire... she then cried aloud, wailed and repaired to her own station
within her most lofty mansion..."22.

In fact, from the BaháT perspective, all the founders of the world's major
religions are incarnations of the Word of God in human form.

A brief mention here will be given about the BaháT view of the Virgin
Birth. Shoghi Effendi writes, "on this point, as on several others, the
BaháT Teachings are in full agreement with the doctrines of the Catholic

Church. In the "Kitab-i-Iqan" (Book of Certitude)23, and a few other
Tablets unpublished, Baha'u'llah confirms, however indirectly, the
Catholic conception of the Virgin Birth. Also, 'Abdu'1-Bahá in the book
"Some Answered Questions", explicitly states that "Christ found
existence through the Spirit of God"24 which statement necessarily
implies, when viewed in light of the text, that Jesus was not the son of
Joseph"25. This passage suggests that the Virgin Birth was in some sense,
a miraculous event. Furthermore, Shoghi Effendi states that, "the
possibility of miracles has never been rejected in the Teachings. Their
importance, however, has been minimized"26.

As already mentioned in section 4 of this paper, there are other examples
of miraculous births associated with prophets and holy men in the Old and
New Testament, and Jesus' fatherless birth was not unique. In the words
of 'Abdu'1-Bahá', "The honor and greatness of Christ is not due to the
fact that He did not have a human father, but to His perfections, bounties
and divine glory. If the greatness of Christ is His being fatherless, then
Adam is greater than Christ, for He had neither father or mother"27. This
passage indicates that the importance of the Virgin Birth lies mainly in its
spiritual symbolism. As written in the Gospel of John, "but as many as
received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
them that believe on his name: which wore born, not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God" (John 1:12-13). If
this is true for believers, how much mere so for Christ, who was the
perfect "image of God" (2 Col. 4:4) and the "first born of every creature"
(Col. 1:15).

8\. Conclusion

The theological debates about the nature of Jesus are still continuing, long
after the Nicene Creed was signed. The issue still appears to divide
Christians into separate irreconcilable ideological groups. "The Myth of
God Incarnate"28, a collection of essays edited by John Hick, when first
published in Britain in 1977 immediately set off a theological controversy,
received hostile reviews both in the religious and secular press, and was
answered within six weeks by "The Truth of God Incarnate" and lata: by
"God Incarnate"29. In addition, a call was made by the Church of England
Evangelical Council that the five Anglican authors should resign their
orders30. So intense was the controversy that another book only two years
after the first was brought out entitled, "Incarnation and Myth: The debate
continued" which contained essays by the first book's authors and some
of their critics31.

It is unlikely that more theology will resolve the issue of the great mystery
of the sonship of Jesus and his divinity. On the other hand, it is Christ's
life and teachings that provide the clearest 'image' of God. This meaning
of the sonship of Jesus is acceptable to people from all religious
traditions. It would surely have been accepted by the great Hindu saint
Mahatma Ghandi, who describes Jesus in the following way, "To me he
was one of the greatest teachers humanity has ever had. To his believers
he was God's only begotten son. Could the fact that I do or do not accept
this belief have any more or less influence in my life? Is all the grandeur
of his teaching and his doctrine to be forbidden to me? I cannot believe so
...My interpretation... is that in Jesus' own life is the key to his nearness
to God; that he expressed, as no other could, the spirit and will of God. It
is in this sense that I see and recognise him as the son of God".32
