     Science and Religion in Chinese Culture

Anjam Khursheed

Abstract

According to the Bahá'í Faith, religion, in one form or other is believed to
lie at the root of all civilisations. This paper sets out to examine this belief
with respect to the great developments of philosophy and science in the
Chinese civilisation during the Tang (618-907 AD) and Sung (960-1279
AD) dynasties.

Science in China is usually thought to have developed in isolation, with
relatively little influence from other cultures, while philosophy in China is
often described as “humanist”, that is, one which is not reliant upon
religion. The theme of this paper is that Chinese cultural achievements
during the Tang and Sung dynasties not only emerged from considerable
contact with other cultures, but were inspired by religion. The impact of
Buddhism on Chinese culture is highlighted. This paper draws parallels
between Buddhism being the inspiration behind the Chinese Sung
Renaissance, and Islam lying at the root of the European Renaissance.

Another issue addressed in this paper is “Needham’s puzzle”, that is, the
question of why modem science did not develop in China. Some of the
source texts of the three main spiritual traditions in China, Confucianism,
Taoism and Buddhism are examined in the light of whether they
encourage or discourage scientific investigation. Also, elements of Neo-
Confucianism are critically reviewed, since it has been the dominant
school of philosophy in China for the last millennium. The general
conclusions are that: when China was characterised by an ethnocentric
world-view, illustrated for instance by Neo-Confuciamst suppression of
Buddhism, Chinese science did not make much progress. On the other
hand, creative and innovative periods in Chinese history were
characterised by an openness to foreign people, not only in terms of

126          THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

scientific exchange, but also with respect to embracing their philosophy
and religion.

1\. Chinese Scientific Achievement

It is now well known, that around a millennium ago, the Chinese culture
was one of the most scientifically advanced cultures in the world. Chinese
people living at that time, were in many ways centuries more advanced
than their European contemporaries. Until relatively recently, all this was
not widely appreciated. Only after the second world war, largely through
the seminal work of the English scientist/historian Joseph Needham, were
the great achievements of Chinese science better disseminated to the
Western world.1

Three Chinese inventions in particular, printing, gunpowder and the
magnetic compass, are conspicuous of the great scientific legacy that
China bequeathed to Europe. These inventions transformed medieval
Europe and prepared it for the modem era. By the 17th century, many
European scientists and philosophers were acknowledging their debt to
these inventions, although curiously, they did not know where these
inventions originated. The well-known English 17th century spokesman of
modem science, Sir Francis Bacon, refers to the impact of these
inventions in the following way:

“It is well to observe [said Lord Verulam] the force and virtue and
consequences of discoveries. These are to be seen nowhere more
conspicuously than in those three which were unknown to the ancients,
and which the origin, though recent, is obscure and inglorious; namely,
printing, gunpowder, and the magnet. For these three have changed the
whole face and state of things throughout the world, the first in literature,
the second in warfare, the third in navigation; whence have followed
innumerable changes; in so much that no empire, no sect, no star, seems

1 Joseph Needham’s massive achievement is embodied in the continuing Science and
Civilisation in China series, the successive parts o f which have been published by
Cambridge University Press since 1954. The home o f the project is now the Needham
Research Institute in Cambridge, which also houses a unique and growing library (the East
Asian History o f Science Library) used by scholars from East and West alike.

to have exerted greater power and influence in human affairs than these
mechanical discoveries...”2

Bacon’s clear testimony that printing, gunpowder and the magnetic
compass were among the most powerful scientific discoveries of his day
is important, as is his ignorance concerning their origins. It is difficult to
exaggerate the great social impact these inventions had on European life
in the late medieval period. The Reformation, Renaissance and the rise of
capitalism all made use of printing, and the democratic form of education
that it made possible. Gunpowder weapons brought about a more
democratic form of warfare, and led to the end of Western military
aristocratic feudalism. The castle was no longer the most secure fighting
post. Both at sea and land, gunpowder made war more mobile. The
magnetic compass opened up a new era of navigational science for Europe
in the 15th century and took Europeans around the world, eventually to
discover America. The great social transforming effect of such
expeditions gave rise to Western colonies and brought the world much
closer than it had ever been before. Also, no less important, is the role
magnetic science played in the development of modem science. The study
of magnetism provided parallels by which the gravitational force was
understood, and this body of science finally evolved into field theory.
Field theory is an important branch of physics by which we understand
electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena today.

It is extraordinary, that given the far-reaching effects of printing,
gunpowder and the magnetic compass on European society that their
origins were to remain “obscure”. What is even more surprising is that for
most Europeans, the origins of these inventions remained a mystery right
up to the 20th century. Indeed, Needham cites two occurrences of it in
books written by well-known European scholars, one which was
published in 1920, and the other published in 1962. Needham refers to it
as an attitude o f ‘invincible ignorance’.3

The Chinese wrote of magnetic effects as early as 83 AD, in relation to
divination devices called Shih. The earliest description of a magnetic
compass dates from the 9th century AD. A small wooden piece of

128        THE SINGAPORE BAHÁT STUDIES REVIEW

loadstone is embedded in the body of a wooden fish that is floated in
water. The fish has a little needle projecting from it that points south. An
interesting feature about this arrangement was that the compass-fish was
magnetised by being heated to red heat while held in the north-south
position in the earth’s magnetic field. This shows that the Chinese knew
about remnant magnetism. There is also evidence that they knew of
magnetic decimation (the fact that compasses do not point exactly North-
South and that the difference varies with time). The Chinese used the
magnetic compass in navigation around the 10th century AD. They
achieved all these things long before Europeans even knew of magnetic
polarity. The earliest mention of magnetic polarity in Europe dates from
1180 AD. This puts China ahead of Europe by at least two to three
centuries. However, Arabic commentators certainly knew of the Chinese
fish-compass, and often referred to it. It is thus quite likely that
information about the compass and magnetic effects came to Europe via
the Islamic civilisation.

Gunpowder seems to have developed out of Taoist alchemist experiments
aimed at developing an elixir for longevity. The first mention of an
explosive chemical mix resembling gunpowder occurs in the 9th century
AD. In 919 AD, the Tire drug’, as it was known, was used as an ignition
for a flame-thrower. By 1000 AD, it was packed into bomb and grenade
form. The first composition formulae appeared in 1044 AD, some three
centuries earlier than references to gunpowder composition in Europe.
These first gunpowder devices were more like rockets, and did not consist
of the much later destructive explosive mix. In fact, rocket devices in
China date from around the 11th century. Gunpowder weaponry in Europe
started to develop in the early 14th century.

Block printing in China developed in the 9th century AD. The earliest
printed book is a Buddhist text (The Diamond Sutra), which dates from
868 AD. In 932 AD, the complete printed edition of the Classical Books
of Confucius was commissioned. Moveable type was developed in the
11th century, even though a separate piece of type was needed for each
one of the thousands of Chinese characters. Moveable type in Europe was
introduced into Europe some 400 years later, when Gutenberg printed his
Latin Bible in 1456 AD.

There was much more to the Chinese technological heritage than the
development of gunpowder, the magnetic compass and printing. Other
contributions of China, according to Needham, include, the efficient
equine harness, the technology of iron and steel, the invention of the
mechanical clock, the development of basic engineering devices such as
the driving-belt, the chain-drive, the standard method of converting rotary
to rectilinear motion, segmental arch bridges, nautical techniques such as
the stem-post rudder, the seismograph, and deep drilling, to mention only
a few. The list is considerable.

Although the Chinese contribution in technology is impressive, the idea
that all these inventions came only from China is misleading. There are
several instances of Needham’s Chinese inventions being shared by other
cultures. Take for instance the invention of the mechanical clock, whose
development Needham claims to be mainly Chinese.4

A clock driven by a waterwheel is described by Su Sung in Khaiféng, the
capital of the Northern Sung Dynasty in 1092 AD. This clock used a
linkwork escapement mechanism that made it accurate. Clocks in Europe
did not arrive at the same accuracy of Su Sung’s clock until the 17th
century. The first origins of clock making in China started around 725
AD, when a Tantric Buddhist, I-Hsing and an engineer Liang Ling-Tsan
built a water wheel clock for an imperial court of higher learning.

The development of the clock had of course, a profound influence on the
craft tradition that accompanied modem science. Needham speculates that
the Chinese water-wheel linkwork clock was known in 13th century
Europe, or that there was at least the knowledge that mechanical time­
keeping had been solved. But knowledge of clocks, as with many other
scientific developments, reached Europe more directly through the Islamic
civilisation. In fact, water-wheel driven clocks were designed and
constructed in the Islamic world precisely around the same time they
appeared in China, and there is disagreement among historians whether
medieval Muslims knew of Chinese clocks or vise versa. The historian,
Arnold Pacey cites the Muslim contribution in the following way:

4 J. Needham, Clerks and Craftsman in China and the West, pp. 131-2.

130          THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

“Among Islamic books studied or translated at Toledo, there were several
which discussed mechanical devices including astronomical and several
types of water clock. One author who wrote on this subject was al-
Muradi, and he illustrated elaborate gear trains, some with epicyclic and
segmental gears. It is particularly interesting to note that he was working
at almost exactly the time Su Sung was building his great clock in China.
Indeed, one of al-Muradi’s designs was for a clock driven by a water­
wheel like Su Sung’s, but no connection between the two seems likely. A
more relevant connection is with two water-clocks of rather simpler
design which were operating at Toledo in the 1080s.”5

The relationship between clocks in the Islamic and Chinese civilisations is
not well documented. It may be that Muslims learned of Chinese clocks,
and made developments of their own. Or it could be that there was much
more exchange of technology than we suppose; and that water-wheel
clocks was a shared invention. There are similar examples in astronomy.
Water-wheel clocks in China were used to drive astronomical devices
called armillary spheres, which mapped the coordinates of stars on the
celestial sphere. Needham cites the Chinese astronomer, Kuo Shou-Ching
for the development of a bronze armillary sphere in 1275 AD at Peking,
which he takes to be the forerunner of the equitorial mounting of the
modem telescope. Modem astronomy uses the Chinese system of
equitorial coordinates to measure a star’s position on the celestial sphere,
rather than the ecliptic coordinates of the Greeks or the altazimuth
measurements of the Arabs. But Needham himself explains that Kuo
Shou-Ching arrived at his invention by modifying the ‘torqutum’, a kind
of computing machine for performing transformations between coordinate
systems, which was first designed by the Spanish Muslim Jabir ibn Aflah,
and that it was introduced into China by the scientific mission of Jamal al-
Din in 1267 AD.6 This is an instance where a Chinese invention was
inspired by Islamic science. Moreover, the explicit mention of there being
an Islamic “scientific mission” in China does seem to suggest that
Muslims at least, were looking for scientific collaboration.7

5 A. Pacey, Technology in World Civilization, p. 36.
6 J. Needham, The Grand Titration, p.79.
7 This kind of collaboration was no doubt inspired by the Prophet’s injunction to, “Seek
after knowledge, even unto China”, quoted by 'Abdu'1-Bahá in The Secret o f Divine
Civilization,
p. 26.

Needham records an instance of the Chinese setting out to learn from the
Arabs. The famous Muslim physician Al-Razi records the visit of a
Chinese scholar to his home in Baghdad in the 10th century. Al-Razi wrote
of how his Chinese guest stayed there learning Arabic in 6 months, and
then translated the works of Galen into Chinese, after which he left to
return to China. Chinese and Islamic scientists collaborated under Mongol
rule. The Mongols instigated an astronomical observatory in the 13th
century at Maraghah (south of Tabriz in Iran) under the care of the famous
Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. The Mongols arranged for a collaboration of Chinese
astronomers (Fu Meng-Chi) with Muslim astronomers that came from
Spam (al-Maghribi, al-Andalusi). Later, a similar astronomical
observatory was set up in Samarkand in Central Asia.* The
Islamic/Chinese contact, although officially sanctioned and encouraged by
the Mongols in the 13-14th centuries, had certainly taken place earlier, in
the Sung and Tang dynasties. Islam’s overland entry in China is likely to
have occurred in the mid-seventh century.89 During the Tang dynasty,
Arab traders were frequently in Canton. Mosques started to appear in
China around the turn of the first millennium. All this suggests that there
was ample opportunity for scientific interchange.

Chinese science also has points of contact with India. There are Chinese
references in 636 AD to many Brahmin books on astronomy, medicine,
and mathematics that are now lost. Around the same period, there are
Chinese references to Indian knowledge of mineral acids.10 There are
records of Buddhist activity in building and repair of bridges along routes
connecting China to India, and large bronze statues of the Buddha have
been found as early as 734 AD, which must have involved the use of
metal furnaces capable of melting about 1 ton of metal.11 Already
mentioned, is the oldest printed book, which is a copy of the Diamond
Sutra, the most sacred of all Chinese Buddhist sutras. By the 12th century
AD, Buddhist mathematical textbooks in China were very common. A

12th century Confucian scholar cited by Needham states, “Nowadays even
children learn mathematics from Buddhist textbooks which deal with the
counting of infinite numbers of sand-grains.. .”12

132          THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

Needham acknowledges that the interchange of scientific information
between China and other Asian civilisations such as the Indian and
Islamic ones requires further research.13 But one important point emerges
from the scanty information that already exists. It is not possible to study
Chinese science in isolation, without reference to other Asian cultures.
The period 600 - 1200 AD, during the so-called “dark age” of Europe,
three Asian civilisations reached their height: Chinese, Indian and Islamic,
and they had considerable contact with one another. It was also a period
of revivals: the revival of Confucianism by the Neo-Confucianists during
the 10th-12th centuries in China, the revival of the teachings of the
Upamshads by the religious leader Shankara in India during the 8th and 9th
centuries, and the revival of ancient Greek learning in Europe.
Interestingly, both the leading figures of the Chinese and Indian revivals,
Chu Hsi and Shankara respectively, were accused of being “Crypto-
Buddhists”.

A Table depicting some of these cross-cultural parallels in science,
religion and philosophy is presented below. The Table is by no means
definitive and there are many scientific achievements that have been
omitted for reasons of space and clarity. Some general patterns
nevertheless, do emerge from it. Firstly, during the Tang dynasty, which
was when Buddhism in China was at its height, some of China’s most
enduring scientific discoveries such as gunpowder and the mariner’s
compass were made. Reference has already been made to specific
inventions like bridge building and printing, which had direct Buddhist
involvement. The great scientific achievements of the Sung dynasty in
China roughly correlate with similar developments in the Islamic
civilisation. They include improvements in clock design, construction of
mechanical devices for astronomy, and the use of algebra. The very best
of Chinese science, which occurred in the Tang and Sung dynasties, took
place when China was open to Buddhist and Islamic cultures. They were
periods when China’s links with other countries were strong, through
Central Asia to Islamic countries in the west, across the mountains south
to India, eastwards to Japan, and down by sea around South East Asia.

Another pattern that emerges from the above Table is that each revival
occurred after an innovative period of science and religion. The revival of
the Upanishads (Hinduism) by Shankara followed the scientifically
creative Gupta period, the time of a second renaissance for Buddhism in
India. The Neo-Confucianist revival followed on from innovative
scientific discoveries in the Tang dynasty, a time when Buddhism reached
its greatest popularity in China. The revival of Greek philosophy by the
Christian Scholastics followed on from the scientific and religious
achievements of the Islamic civilisation.

There is also an interesting similarity with respect to how Islam
influenced the West and the impact of Buddhism in China. The great
cultural impact of Islam on the West culminated with the European
Renaissance, roughly 1000 years after its birth, while Buddhism inspired
the Chinese Sung Renaissance, which occurred around 1000 years after its
inception. The Neo-Confuciamsts, although borrowing much from
Buddhism, claimed it to be directly from Confucian writings. Similarly,
the Christian Scholastics, although using many concepts developed from
within the Islamic world, claimed them to come either directly from the
Bible, or from Aristotle. Both the Neo-Confucianists and Christian
Scholastics were ethnocentric in their outlook.

Needham points out that understanding the multi-cultural roots of modem
science helps us realise that many cultures have a share in the
development of modem science. This means that no culture can claim to
be intrinsically superior to any other on the basis of it being the originator
of modem science:

“Science and its application need therefore no longer be regarded in China
or by other Asian people as something for which they should feel
themselves beholden to the generosity of the West, something with no
roots in their own culture. On the contrary, it had many great and
illustrious roots, roots which helped to sustain the scientific Renaissance
itself, and it is right that the Chinese should become more and more
conscious of them. Though modern science originated only in Europe, to
modem science everyone in the last resort contributed.... When all debts
are acknowledged... Asians and Europeans will be able to go forward
together without hesitation, on a just and mutually appreciative basis,

‘neither afore or after other’, truly ‘without any difference or
inequality’.”14

The same principle broadly speaking is also true within Asian science.
The recognition that there were important foreign elements to the
development of Chinese science implies mutual respect and equality
amongst Asian cultures. Further research on the history of Chinese
science may well benefit from correlating it to the development of science
in other Asian civilisations.

2\. Science in the Spiritual Traditions of China

The last section summarised some Chinese scientific achievements, and
found them to be inextricably related to foreign influences coming from
Buddhist and Islamic cultures. The question of how science is related to
the sacred traditions that flourished in China is now considered. One
possible approach is to first list criteria that are important for the growth
of science, and then examine to what degree they are present in Chinese
sacred literature. The following approach is a preliminary attempt to do
precisely this. There are many pre-requisites for science to develop but
only four will be mentioned here. They are discussed more fully
elsewhere and will be stated here without discussion.15 They are as
follows:

1)   Investigating/thinking for oneself and not relying upon tradition
2)   Openness to learning from wherever it comes (from other cultures)
3)   Underlying conviction in the rationality, unity and harmony of nature
4)   Underlying conviction that we have the ability to understand/discover

Nature’s unity and harmony (that we are also rational)

These criteria for the growth of science take the form of individual ethics
or beliefs. The social component to science for the purposes of this
discussion will not be addressed. Selections from the scriptures of the

Vol. 1, No. 1.

136        THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

three mam sacred traditions that existed in China, Confucianism, Taoism
and Buddhism are now examined with the above criteria in mind.

2\.1 Approach to Science from Within the Confucian Classics

The early official formulation of Confucian literature was endorsed by the
Imperial Court of China in 175 AD. Confucianism became popular and
was to be found in the “Five Books”; The Book of Documents, The Book
of Poetry, The Book of Rites, The Book of Changes and The Spring and
Autumn Annals. After a period of decline in the Tang dynasty (618-907
AD), Confucian teachings underwent a revival in the Sung dynasty (960-
1279 AD). The leading scholar of the “Neo-Confucianist” revival was
Chu Hsi (1130 - 1200 AD), and he reformulated the Confucian doctrines
into the “Four Books”, comprising: The Analects, The Great Learning,
The Doctrine of the Mean, and the writings of Mencius. Chu Hsi’s version
of the Confucian writings received official sanction, and became the basis
of the state examination system for around 800 years. In the following
discussion, citations will be taken from ‘The Analects’ and ‘The Great
Learning’.

A background ethic articulated quite clearly in Confucianism, which is
encouraging for the study of science, is the pursuit of learning. Although
education is usually spoken of in the context of self-cultivation, of
acquiring virtues, there is an underlying respect for learning. Confucius
summarised his concerns in the following way:
“The Master said,t ‘The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not
thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being able to move towards
righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to
change what is not good:- these are the things which occasion me
solicitude.’’’(Analects 7: 3)

There is the encouragement of acquiring the ethics of honesty and
humility in our search for knowledge:
“The Master said, ‘The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!’
The Master said, ‘Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you
know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a
thing, to allow that you do not know it; - this is knowledge.’” (Analects, 2:
16-17)

This attitude of mind is vital for the growth of science. On the other hand,
Confucius regarded himself mainly as someone who sought traditional
knowledge, whose mission it was to renew old wisdom:
“The Master said, T am not one who was bom in the possession of
knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it
there.”’ (Analects, 7: 19)

If one then seeks to emulate Confucius’s way of life, as was done later in
the Confucian tradition, then following ancient knowledge will be the
primary concern. Now renewing ancient wisdom in terms of rediscovering
eternal spiritual ideals may be what Confucius had in mind, if this be the
case, looking towards tradition may be beneficial. But if the same attitude
is applied to scientific knowledge, then it is likely to be a hindrance to the
growth of science.

Although there is reference to “an all-pervading unity” and “principles” of
nature, they appear primarily in terms of improving human conduct:
“The Master said, ‘Shan, my doctrine is that of an all-pervading unity’.
The disciple Tsang replied, ‘Yes’. The Master went out, and the other
disciples asked. Saying, ‘what do his words mean?’ Tsang said, ‘The
doctrine of our master is to be true to the principles of our nature and the
benevolent exercise of them to others - this and nothing more.’”
(Analects, 4: 15)

in ‘The Great Learning’, the text mentions that the ancients “first
extended to the utmost their knowledge” and that this “lay in the
investigation of things”, which appears to be a very scientifically
encouraging statement. But when examined more carefully, this process
of “investigating things” is rooted in the “cultivation of the person”.

“The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the
kingdom, first ordered well their own States. Wishing to order well their
States, they regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families,
they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they
first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought
to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts,
they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of
knowledge lay in the investigation of things... From the Son of Heaven

138        THE SINGAPORE BAHÁT STUDIES REVIEW

down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the
person the root of everything besides.” (The Great Learning, 4-6)

Cultivating human virtues need not necessarily be opposed to the growth
of science. In fact, from a Bahá'í point of view, they should develop hand
in hand. But Confucius was relatively silent about cosmological questions,
such as the origin of the universe or the unity of Nature. He was more
concerned with acquiring harmony within human nature. With this lack of
explicit guidance, in practice, whether Confucianism was encouraging to
science or not depended on the whims of the ruling elite.

In the Analects, the relationship with foreign people is mentioned several
times. There is the following famous passage that refers to all men as
“brothers”:

“Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, 4other men all have their brothers, I
only have not.’ Tsz-hsia said to him, ‘There is the following saying which
I have heard: - “Death and life have their determined appointment; riches
and honours depend upon Heaven.” ‘Let the superior man never fail
reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others
and observant of propriety: - then all within the four seas will be his
brothers. What has the superior man to do with being distressed because
he has no brothers?’” (Analects 12:5)

It is not clear what “within the four seas” means here, but it most likely
refers to the known world for the Chinese at the time Confucius lived.
The passage implies that a morally “superior” man does not need to be
physically related to a brother, because through his elevated conduct, all
men will treat him as if he were their brother. This passage suggests that
moral behaviour transcends family ties, and by implication, racial ties,
although that is not clearly stated.

Another passage, which relates to the same theme, is in the context of
Confucius being disappointed with his reception in China, and him
expressing his intention to live amongst the “wild tribes of the east”.
Someone asked him, “They are rude. How can you do such a thing?” His
reply was, “If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would
there be?” (Analects, 9: 13)

Confucius thought that the “rude” foreigners or “Barbarians” would no
longer be uncivilised if a “superior man” were to live amongst them. This
does not necessarily mean that all “superior” men come from China, or
that all foreigners are “barbarians”. But it does emphasise the power of
moral transformation that moral conduct is more important than the race a
person belongs to. So once again, moral behaviour is the primary concern,
while racial allegiances in comparison, are secondary.

Passages like these should generally encourage a more open attitude
towards people of a foreign race. However, there are some other passages
that suggest China is superior to the “rude tribes of the east and north”:
“... In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the
ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than a
minute attention to observances. The rude tribes of the east and north have
their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are
without them.” (Analects, 3:3-5)

It is not clear what is meant here, but historically, it had been interpreted
to mean that the Chinese were superior to people of other races. The
above passage was quoted by Confucianists to suggest that China without
rulers is superior to foreign countries with rulers. In the “The Disposition
of Error”, a dialogue between a Confucian and Buddhist in the 6th century
AD, the Confucian states: “Confucius said, ‘The barbarians with a ruler
are not as good as the Chinese without one.’ Mencius criticised Ch’en
Hsiang for rejecting his own education to adopt the ways of (the foreign
teacher)...”16

In summary, there is in Confucian literature, a general respect for
learning, but it is primarily in the context of acquiring human virtues.
There is a tendency to look towards traditional knowledge, which might,
if taken to apply to all forms of knowledge, be detrimental to the growth
of science. Also, there are conflicting statements about how to treat
foreigners, and Confucius is for the most part, silent about it. Confucius
also avoids discussion of cosmological questions about the origin of the
universe or whether there is an underlying unity of Nature. While none of
these observations are directly against the practice of science, they are not
strongly encouraging towards it either.

2\.2 Approach to Science from Taoist Writings

Some excerpts from the Tao-Te Ching, the main body of writings
attributed to Lao Tzu, the author of Taoism are given below. They are, in
terms of the criteria considered here, very encouraging to the practice of
science. Firstly, there is a definite origin to things (The Tao) and although
it is in essence unknowable, it is subtle, and manifests itself in many
different ways. The Tao is the way by which “we see the beginning of all
things”. Everything, including the world of Nature, derives its harmony
and unity from the Tao. All are invited to discover the presence of the
Tao, both in the world of Nature and in human nature. There are many
mysteries to solve, and we are encouraged to delve into them. If we
contemplate the Tao, it will reveal its mysteries to us. We must be all-
embracing by “knowing the eternal”. The citations demonstrating these
points are as follows:

“The Tao (Way) that can be told of is not the eternal Tao; the name that
can be named is not the eternal name. The Nameless is the origin of
Heaven and Earth; the Named is the mother of all things. Therefore let
there always be non-being so we may see their subtlety, and let there
always be being so we may see their outcome. The two are the same. But
after they are produced, they have different names. They both may be
called deep and profound. Deeper and more profound the door of all
subtleties!” (Tao-Te Chmg, 1)

“Hold on to the Tao of old in order to master the things of the present.
From this one may know the primeval beginning [of the universe]. This is
called the bond of Tao.” (Tao-Te Ching, 14)

“The all-embracing quality of the great virtue (te) follows alone from Tao.
The thing that is called Tao is eluding and vague. Vague and eluding,
there is in it the form... Eluding and vague, in it are things. Deep and
obscure, in it is the essence. The essence is very real; in it are evidences.
From the time of old until now, its name (manifestations) ever remains.
By which we may see the beginning of all things. How do I know that the
beginning of all things are so? Through this (Tao).” (Tao-Te Ching, 21)

“Tao produced the One. The One produced the two. The two produced the
three. And the three produced the ten thousand things. The ten thousand

things carry the yin and embrace the yang, and through the blending of the
material force they achieve harmony.” (Tao-Te Ching, 42)

“The best (man) is like water. Water is good; it benefits all things and
does not compete with them. It dwells in (lowly) places that all disdain.
This is why it is so near to Tao. [The best man] in his dwelling loves the
earth. In his heart, he loves what is profound. In his associations, he loves
humanity...” (Tao-Te Ching, 8)

“He who knows the eternal is all-embracing.” (Tao-Te Ching, 16)

The Tao-Te Ching contains some of the most poetic statements on the
harmony of Nature in all the world’s sacred scriptures. It is a religious
tradition in which the Tao, as a Creator-God, has much in common with
the Jehovah, Father or Allah of the Abrahamic religions. In both cases, the
world of Nature derives its origin and unity from a supreme source, an
infinitely mysterious and subtle being. In both cases, God and the Tao are
in their essence unknowable. In both cases, God is revealed through
Nature’s laws and lies at the root of human inspiration. True, the Tao is
not described in human personal terms, nor does it directly intervene in
human affairs like the God of the Abrahamic traditions. The Tao is to be
contacted by calm contemplation, by appreciating Nature’s inherent
harmony and balance, by discovering universal harmony.

Historically, Taoists made many scientific investigations to uncover the
mysteries of the Tao. Taoist diviners during the Han times were
responsible for the early development of the magnetic compass, while
gunpowder was developed in the Tang dynasty from Taoist alchemist
experiments in search of longevity. Their science was mixed up with
notions of predicting the future, of finding an “elixir of life”. There may
have been elements of magic in their science, but their belief in the
universal harmony of Nature, in the existence of profound mysteries, and
their conviction that we can be empowered to discover these mysteries,
had a very positive effect on the development of science.

2\.3 Approach to Science in Chinese Buddhism

There have been numerous schools of Buddhism in China. Excerpts from
the source writings of only two of them will be given here. Both the Hua-
Yen School and Chan Buddhism have their roots in the Tang dynasty.
Both are distinctively Chinese and had significant influence on Chinese
philosophy and religion around a millennium ago. In the case of the Hua-
Yen school, it did not exist as a school of Buddhism in India.

The Hua-Yen School is well known for its “one-and-all” philosophy,
which not only emphasises the unity of Nature, but also stresses the belief
that the “one and many” are linked through the law of causation. When
one understands, “great wisdom can be achieved”. In the “One-and-all”
philosophy of Fa-Tsang (643-712 AD) for instance, the most well known
spokesman of the Hua-Yen school, the “one and many” principle is
described in the following way:

“All phenomena which exist spontaneously can be combined because they
rise through causation. As the one and the many totally involve each
other, we look at one particle of dust and everything suddenly becomes
manifest... The reason is that, when the mind understands, all dharmas
can be free and at ease, and because the principle is clear, great wisdom
can be achieved.”17

Elsewhere, Fa-Tsang touches on the profound mystery behind universal
causation, its paradox of embracing all in one, and how, “if we investigate
its mystery”, enlightenment can be attained.

“From the above principles, the theory of things coming into existence
through causation is unfathomable; thus its many gates are universally
alone. All things are exhaustively combined as one, and all infinities are
embraced to form a totality. If we investigate its mystery, although
(coming into existence through causation) may occupy a narrow position,
it is always broad, and if we wish to investigate its source, we find that the
deeper it is, the shallower it becomes. The principle of coming into
existence through causation is great indeed!”18

17 W.T. Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, p. 424 .
"ibid., pp. 419-20.

These citations not only stress the unity of Nature, but they encourage us
to understand the “principles” that give rise to this harmony. In terms of
the criteria for the growth of science given earlier, these writings are
extremely encouraging.

One of the most influential formulations of Chan Buddhism comes from
Hui-neng (638-713 AD), its 6th Patriach. The historical details that
surround him, as well as the earlier Patriarchs need not concern us here.

A disciple of Hui-neng, Yoka Daishi, presents the “one and many”
Chinese Buddhist tradition in terms of the moon’s light being one,
although it is scattered over many surfaces:

“One Nature, perfect and pervading, circulates in all natures; One Reality,
all comprehensive, contains within itself all realities; the one moon
reflects itself wherever there is a sheet of water, and all the moons in the
waters are embraced within the one moon; the Dharma-body of all the
Buddhas enters in my own being, and my own being is found in union
with theirs...”19

It is not certain where this analogy comes from, but it was used later by
the Neo-Confucianists.

One of the main contributions of Chan Buddhism, in terms of it
encouraging scientific investigation, was its principle of discovering truth
for oneself, as opposed to following tradition. Chan Buddhism pointed to
the “Buddha-nature” within everyone, and inculcated methods of
meditation to achieve enlightenment, as opposed to relying on the
authority of tradition. Hui-neng for instance, explicitly stated:

“All scriptures and writings, both Mahayana and Hinayana, and the
twelve sections are provided for men. It is because man possesses the
nature of wisdom that these were instituted. If there were no men in the
world, there would naturally be no dharmas. We know, therefore, that
dharmas exist because of man and that there are all these scriptures

19 Yoka Daishi, disciple of Hui-Neng, cited by D. T. Suzuki in his Manual o f Zen
Buddhism, p. 97.

because there are people to preach them... we know that all dharmas are
immanent in one’s mind and person. Why not seek in one’s mind the
sudden realization of the original nature of True Thusness? The P 'usa
chieh ching says, ‘We are originally pure in our self-nature. If we
understand our minds and see our nature, we shall achieve Buddhahood
ourselves.’”20

Even within Buddhist schools in China, Chan Buddhism acquired a
reputation for being unorthodox. Its meditation practices were specifically
designed to rely on one’s own individual investigations, rather than follow
set forms of meditation. The Chinese philosopher Wmg-Tsit Chan
describes various novel techniques that Ch’an Buddhist monks employed,
so that their students would not blindly follow tradition. They prescribed
travel, to “broaden one’s perspective and deepen one’s insight”. They
adopted an approach to “never to tell too plainly”, so that the student must
learn for himself. There was also the koan - the question and enigmatic
answer. Lastly, they employed shouting and beating - an “unorthodox
way of shocking the pupil out of his outmoded metal habits and
preconceived opinions.”21

Chan Buddhism was extremely influential in encouraging openness to
foreign knowledge. This was firstly due to the obvious reason that
Buddhism itself came from outside China. Many Chinese Buddhists
during the Tang dynasty embarked upon the long and arduous journey
South, across the mountains to India. It is quite likely that Buddhist
monks were the means through which Indian and Chinese science came
together. There was also another reason for Buddhism’s openness to
learning from wherever it came. Buddhism is intrinsically universal in its
outlook and does not encourage a parochial approach to learning. This is
why in its history, wherever there arose rivalries between various sects of
Buddhism, there would also be movements to unite them. During the
Tang dynasty, there were differences between Buddhists living in the East
and those in the West. In the “Pure Land” sect of Buddhism, some of
those living in the East came to regard a place in the West to be a “pure
land”, where they believed the faithful would be reborn. They recited the
name “Amitabha” to achieve this. But when Hui-neng was asked about

20 W.T. Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, pp. 438-9.
21 ibid., pp. 428-9.

this tradition, he made it clear that Buddhism involved the search of a
“pure land within” rather than a specific place:

“Although you are native of the East, it your mind is pure you are sinless.
On the other hand, even if you were a native of the West, an impure mind
could not free you from sin. When the people of the East commit a sin,
they recite the name of Amit bha and pray to be bom in the West; but in
the case of sinners who are natives of the West, where should they pray to
be bom? Ordinary men and ignorant people understand neither the
essence of mind nor the pure land within themselves, so they wish to be
bom in the East or the West. But to the enlightened everywhere is the
same. As the Buddha said, ‘No matter where they happen to be, they are
always happy and comfortable.’”22

During the Tang dynasty, there also arose a difference in meditation
techniques between Northern and Southern schools of Buddhism. Within
Chan Buddhism, those in the North stressed “gradual enlightenment” of
the mind, while those in the South preferred “sudden enlightenment”.
There was also a great cultural divide between the monk and the
“barbarian” (uneducated). But Hui-neng preached a more universal
outlook, and directed his teachings specifically to overcome such
differences:

‘•Although people are distinguished as northerners and southerners, there
is neither north nor south in the Buddha-nature. The physical body of the
barbarian and that of the monk are different. But what difference is there
in their Buddha-nature.”23

Hui-neng himself came from an illiterate background, and his becoming
the 6th Patriarch for Chan Buddhism was in itself, a significant triumph for
the more universal approach. All this was of course, most helpful in
creating an atmosphere of openness to foreign learning, and it was
therefore important to the growth of Chinese science.

Apart from the positive influence on the level of ethics and values, there
were some instances where Buddhist philosophy directly suggested more

22 The Sutra o f Hui-neng, p. 90.
23 W.T. Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, pp. 430-1.

enlightened ways to understand cosmology. There was for instance, the
Buddhist concept of space being infinite. This contrasted sharply with the
finite closed way of seeing the universe in medieval Christendom. Hui-
neng for instance speaks of space as an “illimitable void”, and uses it as a
metaphor to understand the infinitely great void (universe) of the mind:

“The capacity of the mind is as great as that of space. It is infinite... the
illimitable void of the universe is capable of holding myriads of things of
various shape and form, such as the sun, the moon, stars, mountains,
rivers, worlds, springs... space takes in all these, and so does the voidness
of our nature. We say the essence of mind is great because it embraces all
things, since all things are within our nature. ... you should know that the
mind is very great in capacity, since it pervades the whole dharmadh tu
[the sphere of the Law, i.e, the universe]. When we use it, we can know
something of everything, and when we use it to its full capacity we shall
know all. All in one and one in all,..”24

The Chinese Buddhist teaching that the power of the mind embraces the
Universe, that it contains a universe greater than the physical universe, is
very similar to Bahá'í teachings. Bahá'u'lláh states that:

“The All-Merciful hath conferred upon man the faculty of vision, and
endowed him with the power of hearing. Some have described him as the
Tesser world,’ when, in reality, he should be regarded as the ‘greater
world’.”25 The concept of the human mind “embracing the world of
Nature”, is a dominant theme in the talks of 'Abdu'1-Bahá.26 The belief
that the human mind is capable of understanding the world of Nature,
capable of looking at it from a “higher” perspective, of studying it
“objectively”, implies that it must in some way be fundamentally different
from it. Science is obviously reliant on the human mind being intrinsically
different to what it observes, otherwise, none of its conclusions would be
valid.

3\. The Influence of Buddhism on the Neo-Confucianists

The influence of Buddhism on Chinese philosophy and religion were far
reaching. It nurtured a revival in Confucian thought during the Sung
dynasty known as Neo-Confucianism. China, for the last 800 years, has
largely been dominated by the Neo-Confucianist tradition, and the Sung
period of Neo-Confucianism is regarded to be the golden period of
Chinese philosophy. The Neo-Confucianists were themselves, strongly
anti-Buddhist and anti-Taoist. One of their explicit aims was to eliminate
Buddhist influence from China, and they were responsible for directing
much Nationalistic propaganda against it. However, the Buddhist and
Taoist influence on their philosophy is unmistakable, and although they
claimed that their philosophy was founded on Confucianist teachings, it
borrowed a great deal from Buddhist and Taoist doctrines. This subject
has received considerable scholarly attention over the last few decades
only a brief introduction to it will be given here. Carson Chang, in his
two-volume treatise on the “Development of Neo-Confucian Thought”,
devotes a chapter to the Buddhist influence, calling it “Buddhism as
stimulus to Neo-Confucianism”. He summarises the Buddhist influence in
the following way:

“Neo-Confucianism was one of the results of the introduction to China of
Buddhism from India. Neo-Confucianism was no product of the cross­
breeding of Buddhism and the Chinese tradition, but rather a declaration
of independence from Buddhism after China had been under the influence
of Indian thought for a long period. This, however, did not leave the
Chinese mind entirely free from some of the more valuable elements in
the Buddhist way of thinking. Without the introduction of Buddhism into
China there would have been no Neo-Confucianism, and this despite the
fact that according to Chinese practice Confucian scholars were
exceedingly reluctant to admit the influence of Buddhism, and were
anxious to make clear that they would have no traffic whatever with that
school of thought.”27

Wing-Tsit Chan, the author of the widely read “A Source Book in Chinese
Philosophy”, also frequently refers to the great impact Buddhism had on

27 C. Chang, Development o f Neo-Confucian Thought, Vol. 1, p. 43.

148          THE SINGAPORE BAHÁT STUDIES REVIEW

Chinese philosophy. He describes Chan Buddhism’s influence on aspects
of Neo-Confucianism to be “Zen in Confucian disguise”:

“It was inevitable that such a philosophy would exercise a profound
influence. Its impact on Chinese philosophy was great. The new doctrine
of seriousness (ching) in Neo-Confucianism was one of its direct
products, and the whole idealistic Neo-Confucian movement of several
hundred years, initiated by Lu Hsiang-shan (Lu Chiu-yiian, 1139-1193)
and culminating in Wang Yang-ming (Wang Shou-jen 1472-1529), was
so much influenced by it that it has often been called Zen in Confucian
disguise. Even the Neo-Confucian tradition of compiling and publishing
the recorded sayings of philosophers is an imitation of those of Zen.”28

Recently, a complete volume of “Buddhism in the Sung” has been
compiled in which most of the authors follow through the theme of how
Buddhism contributed to the great cultural achievements of the Sung
dynasty. They stress, in particular, Buddhist influences on the Neo-
Confucianist movement.29 The purpose here, is not to review the work of
the main Neo-Confucian philosophers, starting with Chou Tun-I (1017-
1073), on to Shao Yung (1011-1077), through to Chang Tsai (1020-1077),
Ch’eng Hao (1032-1085) and Ch’eng I (1033-1107), culminating with the
prolific grand synthesis of Chu Hsi (1129-1200). The aim here, is to
present some Buddhist teachings which inspired the Confucian
Renaissance.

The Neo-Confucianist movement had its roots with Han Yii (768-824
AD), an influential Confucian poet of the Tang dynasty. His scathing
attacks on Buddhism and Taoism betray the overt Nationalist objective of
the Neo-Confucianists. In a letter to the Emperor, he protested against
plans to bring a Buddhist relic to the capital for an exhibition:

“The Buddha was bom in a barbarian country. His language was different
from that of the Chinese, his clothes were different, he could not speak
about the merits of our ancient emperors. If he were living today and
asked for an audience, Your Majesty would probably receive him and
order the officials of the protocol to give him a dinner party. Then he

29 Buddhism in the Sung, edited by P. N. Gregory and D. A. Getz.

might be presented with new clothes, and sent away, in order to prevent
his corrupting our people.”30

Han Yli’s main objection was that the Buddha was not Chinese, a
“barbarian”. Not only did the Buddha not eat and dress like the Chinese,
but more importantly, he did not praise the ancient Chinese Emperors,
indicating the central role that traditional authority played for the
Confucian mind. In underlying the danger that Buddhism posed, Han Yu
pointed to the danger of “corrupting” the Chinese people. This brings out
the political nature of the Confucianist mind. They perceived the Buddhist
threat mainly in social terms, not spiritual or philosophical ones.

Han Yu, like the Confucian in the “Disposition of error” already cited,
appeals to the recorded sayings of Confucius to justify his anti-foreign
bias, “The barbarians even with a King were not to be compared to the
Chinese even without a king.”31 But as already mentioned, the original
text in the Analects (3:3-5) upon which this is founded, is far from clear,
and there are other passages to suggest that racial ties are secondary to
moral conduct (see for instance, Analects 12:5). Han Yu even stigmatised
Lao-Tzu as a “barbarian”, knowing perfectly that he was Chinese32. Han
Yli’s recommended action was along the following lines, “Let a man be a
man. Buddhist books should be burned. Monasteries should be used as
dwelling places.”33 Unfortunately, this is precisely what happened on
some occasions. In 845 AD, under Emperor Wu-tsung, 4,600 large
temples and monasteries, and 40,000 smaller ones were burned and
demolished. Neo-Confucianist criticisms of Taoism and Buddhism were
inseparable from a nationalist propaganda to regain Confucianist
influence over the Chinese people.

Many statements within Neo-Confucianist literature reveal their Taoist
and Buddhist influence. Take for instance, some statements from Chu Hsi,
the most famous of all Neo-Confucianists. He writes:

“Fundamentally there is only one Great Ultimate, yet each of the myriad
things has been endowed with it and each in itself possesses the Great

30 C. Chang, Development o f Neo-Confucian Thought, Vol. 1, p. 85.
31 ibid., p. 96.
32 ibid
33 i b i d p. 97.

Ultimate in its entirety. This is similar to the fact there is only one moon
in the sky but when its light is scattered upon rivers and lakes, it can be
seen everywhere. It cannot be said that the moon has been split.”34

This citation closely parallels the former Ch’an image of: “One Reality,
all comprehensive, contains within itself all realities; the one moon
reflects itself wherever there is a sheet of water, and all the moons in the
waters are embraced within the one moon; the Dharma-body of all the
Buddhas enters in my own being, and my own being is found in union
with theirs...”35 Here, instead of the universal Buddha being reflected in
everything, it is the “Great Ultimate”.

Another instance where Ch’an Buddhist influence is evident in Chu Hsi’s
philosophy is in his ideal of arriving at a mental state of “sudden release”:

“We must eliminate the obstructions of selfish desires, and then it will be
pure and clear and able to know all. When the principles of things and
events are investigated to the utmost, penetration will come as a sudden
release...”36 The “sudden release” of understanding here closely parallels
the “sudden enlightenment” of the southern Ch’an Buddhist school led by
Hui-neng.

The goal of mind-control, was something explicitly associated with
Buddhism and had never been a major concern in the Confucianist
tradition. Yet Chu Hsi weaves it into his philosophy of “investigating all
things”:

“As to the exerting of the mind to the utmost, it is to investigate things
and study their principles to the utmost, to arrive at broad penetration, and
thus to be able fully to realize the principle (li) embodied in the mind”.37

Although Chu Hsi wrote to disassociate his philosophy of mind from the
Buddhist one, it is based upon simplifying and distorting the Buddhist
approach. In the context of him replying to the accusation that his
philosophy of mind bears similarity to the Buddhist one, Chu Hsi states

34 W.T. Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, p. 639.
35 D.T. Suzuki, Manual o f Zen Buddhism, p. 97.
36 W.T. Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy p. 630.
37 ibid., p. 604.

for instance, that Buddhists “seek the mind with the mind”, and that it is
like the “eye seeing the eye”38. Of course, this is not the Buddhist
position. Buddhism seeks to go beyond the mind with respect to its
inherent egoism so that it can discover the “universal mind”. Chu Hsi’s
views of Buddhist doctrines are better understood in terms of him having
an underlying feeling of racial superiority, which he sometimes made
explicit. After criticising the Buddhist approach to the mind, he states,
“But unless one is a superior man who thinks accurately and sifts clearly,
how can he avoid being deluded in this matter?”39 “Superior” here of
course, is the word the Chinese used for themselves, as opposed to the
word “barbarians”, which they reserved for foreigners.

Chou Tun-i and Chu Hsi made commentaries on the “Diagram of the
Supreme Ultimate”, a diagram of Taoist origin. The Neo-Confucianists
used it to provide an explanation for the creation and evolution of the
universe, something that is missing in ancient Confucian writings. Neo-
Confucianists used the diagram to provide a response to Buddhist
cosmology.

There was a clear influence of the Buddhist doctrine of “universal
compassion for all things” on the philosophy of Chang Tsai. In his
Western Inscription, he wrote: “My body reaches as far as the borderline
of heaven and earth; the commandment of heaven and earth constitutes
my nature; men are my brothers; animals and inanimate objects are my
fellow-creatures...”40 Also, the Neo-Confucianist practice of “quiet­
sitting” was a form of meditation inspired by Ch’an Buddhism.

Perhaps the most important contribution made by Ch’an Buddhism was
the injunction of not blindly following tradition, but investigating things
for oneself. This was incorporated in Neo-Confucianist doctrine, and
became known as “investigating principle to the utmost”.

There were many examples of Buddhist monks being respected for their
learning by the Confucian scholar officials or literati. Chang Chiu Ch’eng
(1092-1159) was a famous Confucian scholar who was also a disciple of

38 ibid
39 ibid
40 C. Chang, Development o f Neo-Confucian Thought, Vol. 1, p. 131.

the Buddhist (Ch’an) monk, Ta-hui Tsung-Kao (1089-1163). Chu Hsi
accused Chang of being “outwardly Confucian but secretly Buddhist”. In
fact Chu Hsi was himself later accused of being a “Crypto-Buddhist”.
Although many Neo-Confucianists in public life ridiculed and attacked
Buddhism, the same people privately acknowledged their debt to Buddhist
teachings. Chang, speaking to his nephew who was intolerant of
Buddhism, said of his Buddhist teacher:
“The subtle benefits our teaching [Confucianism] has gained from the
Buddhist dharma are great. Do not be so quick to denigrate it. The reason
why I befriended the monk Ta-hui Tsung-Kao is because I got such
enjoyment from his extraordinary ideas and discussions...”41

The same kind of situation existed for Han Yu, the pioneer of Neo-
Confucianism. Although he was publicly anti-Buddhist, on the individual
level, he had admiration for a monk named Ta-tien. This inconsistency
between public and private life was quite typical of many Neo-
Confucianists. The Buddhist association did not of course, go unnoticed.
Han Yu was accused of being a secret Buddhist. In his defence, Han Yli
wrote:

“Your story that I am converted to Buddhism is mere gossip. When I was
in Ch’ao-chuo, I met an old monk called Ta-tien [a Ch’an disciple of the
monk Shih-t’ou, 700-790 AD], who was intelligent and well-versed in
philosophy. Since I was living in exile in a remote place, and could find
no person with whom to discuss, I invited him to come to the city and stay
about two weeks. Ta-tien is a man who looks with contempt upon the
world, and who has his own convictions about truth. He is not one whit
stirred by what is going on in the world. Though I did not understand his
discourses, I was well aware that his mind was thoroughly intelligent and
unaware of puzzles. Such a man is rare, and I was glad to consider him an
acquaintance...”42 It is significant that Han Yu’s admiration of Ta-tien
was based upon his intelligence and detachment from the world.

There were also Buddhist monks who were so knowledgeable in science,
history, literature, poetry, and the Confucian tradition, that they even
became advisors to the Emperor. Take for instance Tsan-ning (919-1001

41 P. N. Gregory and D. A. Getz, Buddhism in the Sung, p. 84.
42 C. Chang, Development o f Neo-Confucian Thought, Vol. 1, pp. 127-8.

AD), he was so admired for his knowledge of the Confucian tradition, that
he was known as a “Confucian monk”. He was a wen master, that is,
someone who was part of the movement to revive Confucian learning.
Interestingly, he was renowned for his scientific learning. He for instance,
gave correct explanations of luminescent objects and invisible ink and
gamed great respect from Confucian officials who were otherwise anti-
Buddhist.43

All this goes to show that Buddhism was an inspiration to Neo-
Confucianism and to the growth of science in China. It should be
mentioned in passing here, that these observations are diametrically
opposite to those arrived at by the historian Joseph Needham. Needham
cites some positive influences of Buddhism, but then comes to the
following conclusion:

“When all is said and done, though, Buddhism does not seem to have
helped the development of science in China. It was essentially inimical to
it as any philosophy built on a profound rejection of the world was bound
to be... Buddhism, it is true, was a great civilising force in Central Asia,
but in China, where there was already a civilisation of a high order,
matters were rather different.”44

In fact, in support of this conclusion, there is an instance of Needham
citing Chu Hsi’s criticisms of Buddhism.45 But as already pointed out,
Neo-Confucian criticisms of Buddhism are replete with an underlying
Nationalistic agenda and feelings of racial superiority, which was made
explicit on many occasions. Moreover, to dismiss the Buddhist
contribution on the grounds that its philosophy involves a “rejection of the
world” is to misunderstand both Buddhism and science. In its open
declaration of investigating truth for oneself and not blindly following
tradition, in its profound conviction that the human mind can discover the
secrets of nature, in its inherent belief in the unity of nature, in its concept
of universal causation, and much more besides, Buddhism has been
extremely encouraging to the practice of science. There is also much more
to science than empirical observations. Observations need to be carefully

selected, interpreted and valued, and this involves creative powers of the
mind that are both rational and spiritual.46

4\. Parallels between the Neo-Confucianists and the Christian
Scholastics

The Neo-Confucianists had many points in common with the medieval
Christian scholastics and ancient Greeks like Aristotle. All of them, in one
way or another, had versions of the “One in Many” paradox. The Neo-
Confucianists referred to an eternal unitary realm they called ri,
manifesting itself in diverse physical ways, ch 7. Chu Hsi stated, “ri is
one, but its manifestations are demonstrated in thousands of ways”, and
“each particular thing forms a Supreme Ultimate in itself’.47 The
relationship of the “Supreme Ultimate” or ri to individual objects is very
much like the relationship between “universals” and “particulars” in
ancient Greek thought, which were debated at great length by medieval
scholastics. The “Supreme Ultimate” is used on other occasions like
Aristotle’s “Final Cause” or his “Unmoved Cause”, and is also similar to
the “First Cause” of the Scholastics. Chu Hsi’s dual model of human
nature, of an eternal realm hidden within a transient mind, like a “pearl in
dirty water”48, has similarities to the Form/Body distinction of Aristotle’s
philosophy, and the half-animal/half-angel doctrine in Christianity. The
Neo-Confucianists believed in different grades of life, each manifesting to
its own degree, the inherent ri.

This has similarities to Aristotle’s differing levels of “souls” (vegetable,
animal and human). Like Aristotle, the Neo-Confucianists thought that
human reason was the distinguishing feature that made people different
from animals. Like Plato’s form of the Good, the Neo-Confucianists
believed in the existence of an objective eternal universal moral order. In
short, the kind of philosophy that was being pursued in China around
1000 years ago, although in name very different, and ostensibly humanist
(as opposed to religious or theological), was in fact much like the

philosophy/theology of the medieval scholastics. Around exactly the same
period we have: Averroes (1126-98 AD) demonstrating the harmony of
Aristotle’s philosophy with the Quran, Maimonidies (1135-1204 AD)
formulating the harmony of Aristotle’s philosophy with the Torah, and
Aquinas (1225-1274 AD) writing of the harmony of Aristotle’s
philosophy with the Bible. Their philosophies had many areas in common
with Neo-Confucianism as articulated by Chu Hsi (1131-1200 AD), and
in fact, all these schools of philosophy, whether in the East or West, in
their own ways, express harmony between science and religion.

The 17th century European pioneers of science, such as Galileo and Kepler
echoed many of the same fundamental beliefs articulated by the medieval
scholastics, such as the unity and rationality of nature, and the essential
harmony of science and religion. One simple illustration of this is the
metaphor of “The Book of Nature”, where the world of Nature is likened
to the revelation of scripture. Galileo for instance states:

“Philosophy is written in this grand book the universe, which stands
continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless
one first learns to comprehend the language and to read the alphabet in
which it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its
characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures, without
which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it.”49

Galileo is often portrayed to be modem in his outlook, and his work is
usually thought to have opposed medieval scholasticism, but in the above
quotation, there are echoes of the scholastic doctrine. Kepler also referred
to mathematics being the script of the Book of Nature.50 Broadly
speaking, the same is true for the other 17th century pioneers of modem
science. Viewed from this perspective, the most lasting influence of
medieval scholasticism was its doctrine on the harmony of science and
religion.

On the other hand, medieval scholasticism is also known for impeding
scientific progress. Something that was cited by the 17th century pioneers
of modem science to be an obstacle for the growth of science was the

156           THE SINGAPORE BAHA’I STUDIES REVIEW

University Aristotelian tradition of learning. Aristotle’s philosophy had
been made a core and compulsory part of university education by
Christian scholastics since the rise of universities in Europe in the 13th
century. Those who worked within Aristotle’s school of philosophy were
known as “Peripatetics”. In the first half of the 17th century, Francis
Bacon, Descartes and Galileo, all wrote of the necessity to remove
Aristotelian learning from the curriculum of European universities. In
Galileo’s words:

“There remain in opposition to my work some stem defenders of every
minute argument of the Peripatetics. So far as I can see, their education
consisted in being nourished from infancy on the opinion that
philosophizing is and can be nothing but to make a comprehensive survey
of the texts of Aristotle, that from divers passages they may quickly
collect and throw together a great number of solutions to any proposed
problem. They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages - as if this
great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but by
Aristotle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.”51

Galileo himself had to reject Aristotelian theories before he could make
progress. An obvious example that comes to mind is Aristotle’s impetus
theory of motion, which was defended by the university Peripatetics, and
which needed to be rejected before Galileo could advance the modem
description of projectile motion. Galileo’s references to the Peripatetics
suggest that they were largely concerned about preserving Aristotle’s
tradition of learning, rather than investigating matters for themselves.
Understood in this way, the scholastics had institutionalised a tradition of
learning that impeded the growth of science. On the need for science to
rely on individual investigation, as opposed to traditional authority,
Galileo wrote:

“It appears to me that they who in proof of anything rely simply on the
weight of authority, without adducing any argument in support of it, act
very absurdly. I, on the contrary, wish to be allowed to raise questions
freely and to answer without any adulation [of authorities] as becomes
those who are truly in search of the truth.”52

There are many historical similarities between medieval Christian
scholastics and the Neo-Confucianists in the context of the history of
science. The following table summaries some of them.

The mam points which emerge from the comparison is that both Christian
scholastics and Neo-Confucianists over-emphasised the role of ancient
learning and institutionalised them into rigid formal systems of education.
The Chinese state examination system, which was based entirely on the
study of Confucian texts, excluded not only Taoist and Buddhist
education, but also did not include scientific subjects. This examination
system dominated and dictated the pattern of education in China for over
800 years, and it in effect, created a rote-learning environment of
education, where ancient Confucian texts dominated all forms of scholarly
activity. Many generations of Confucian scholars in the centuries
following the Neo-Confucianist pioneers, looked to ancient Confucian
texts for their scientific inspiration. But unlike the Neo-Confucianists,
they did not find a philosophy in these texts that explicitly encouraged
scientific investigation. The problem had been created by the Neo-
Confucianists themselves, who had derived their inspiration from
Buddhism and Taoism, but wrongly attributed it to ancient Confucian
writings. Unlike the situation in Europe, where the Aristotelian scholastic
tradition at universities was overthrown, there was no comparable
revolution in the Chinese educational system. The Confucian system of
education in China was for the most part, unchallenged. This greatly
impeded the growth of science in China, since progress in science
depends on thinking for oneself, as opposed to following tradition.

The Christian scholastics were Eurocentric in their outlook and this also
retarded progress in science. It meant for instance that the contributions of
India and China in the pure sciences, which were well known in the Arab-
Islamic world, were not recognised in Europe for many centuries.
Needham cites the reason for this being the highly selective translations
that were made from Arabic into Latin in medieval Europe. He states:

“It is not that there was no contact between Arabic civilization and East
Asian science; quite the contrary. But for some reason or other, when the
translations were being made from Arabic into Latin, it was always the
famous authors of Mediterranean antiquity who were chosen, and not the
books of Islamic scholars concerning the science of India and China”.53

53 J. Needham, Clerks and Craftsmen, p. 15.

A similar problem existed in China. The Neo-Confucianists succeeded in
creating a hostile attitude towards the learning of other cultures. In fact,
rejecting all forms of foreign learning had been one of their founding
aims. This meant that in subsequent centuries, the ruling elite, schooled
only in the Confucian classics, was not so open to learning from other
cultures as their predecessors had been during the Tang and Sung
dynasties. This meant that China was deprived of crucial scientific
advances, such as Greek geometry, Indian astronomy, and Islamic
astronomy, which all proved important to the development of modem
science in Europe.

Equally important, is the Neo-Confucian opposition to Buddhism and
Taoism within China. This resulted in Neo-Confucianism depriving itself
of spiritual traditions that were rich in scientific inspiration, and as a
result, Chinese science declined as Neo-Confucianism rose to power. Seen
from this perspective, it is perhaps no coincidence that the decline of
innovative science and the decline of Buddhism in China occurred over
approximately the same period, that is, the one stretching from the 13th
century to the 19th century.

Through adopting the Neo-Confucianist policy of not accepting learning
and wisdom from other cultures, both within and from outside China,
China deprived itself of the necessary pieces of the puzzle from which the
modem scientific revolution was made. These observations may provide
the basis for a solution to “Needham’s puzzle”: as to why China did not
develop modem science.54

It is perhaps instructive at this point to remind ourselves of the demise of
Neo-Confucianism in the 19th century, when China suffered humiliating
defeat at the hands of various foreign powers. Although the invading
countries had armies numerically much smaller than the Chinese one, they
were technologically much more superior, and this proved to be the
decisive element in their victory. The 19th century is, of course, well
known for being a crisis point for Confucianism in China. It was a time
when many of the Chinese elite rebelled against the Neo-Confucianist
orthodoxy and sought to make reforms. Significantly, the crisis brought
about a revival of Buddhism in China. Ian Mabbitt, a historian on modem

54 J. Needham, The Grand Titration, Chap. 6.

160          THE SINGAPORE BAHA’I STUDIES REVIEW

China, notes that most the 19th century Chinese reformers drew much
inspiration from Buddhism:

“China’s modem “revolutionaries” grew up in a tradition of rebellion
where Buddhism was an integral part of the surroundings, like wallpaper.
But the influence of Buddhism upon the intellectual life of the new men,
who sought during the last hundred years to bring their country into the
modem world, is indeed direct and traceable... Buddhism, as a tradition
of heterodoxy with something to offer to intelligent men, was of very
considerable interest to the fathers of reform in old China. Late in the 19th
century, the confrontation with a menacing western civilization which
could not readily be accommodated to the place assigned to it by orthodox
thought compelled many Chinese thinkers to distance themselves from
their own culture, seeking to assess it critically as one among many, not as
the only possible framework for thought. Liang Qichao (Liang Ch’ch’ao,
1873-1929), one of the later products of this movement, looked back at
the intellectual currency of its protagonists and wrote that ‘among the late
Ch’ing “Scholars of the New Learning”, there were almost none who did
not have some connection with Buddhism.’.. .”55

Mabbitt judges the influence of Buddhism on modem China to be such a
spiritually profound one, that he predicts it will grow and dominate
Chinese culture in the future:
“This Part begins with a prediction. However irrelevant Buddhism may
seem to modem Chinese culture now, it will in the coming years emerge
bit by bit as an influence of no mean order upon the national psyche; and
the forms of its influence will appear, not to have re-emerged after long
eclipse, but to have been always there. It is therefore proper to give it
special attention. This attention is unusual, because it is usually
Confucianism that commands our notice. There are those who say that in
China the past refuses to lie down dead, but their argument is usually
nothing to do with Buddhism. It is the mandarin, not the bonze, who has
discarded his robes; and he has put on the new-pressed uniform of the
commissar.”56

55 I. W. Mabbitt, Modern China, p. 139.
56 ibid.. p. 101.

These observations on Buddhism in modem China reinforce the theme
pursued here, that Buddhism has had a lasting impact on scientific and
cultural progress in China. The universal, egalitarian, non-partisan
principles of Buddhism contrast sharply with the elitist, nationalistic
doctrines of Neo-Confucianism, and of the two, it is Buddhism that seems
more in tune with the modem world. There is an interesting historical
comparison that can be made between China and Japan in the 19th century.

Both Buddhism and Confucianism coexisted in these cultures, but their
response to the modem world was quite different. As is well known,
Japan adopted a much more open response to foreign learning than China,
and in fact, its adaptation to the modem world has been a remarkable
achievement. Among one of the many differences between 19th century
Japan and China, was that in Japan, Buddhism had much more of a
stronger social profile than it had in China. An interesting line of inquiry
would be to investigate whether the greater influence of Buddhism in
Japan helped it better adjust to the modem world.

In the Bahá’í Writings, China’s 19th century defeat is cited in the context
of calling for more openness to foreign learning in 19th century Persia.
The contrast between Japan and China is mentioned, and the benefits of
being open to the learning of other cultures are highlighted.57

57 'Abdu'1-Bahá, in his book, The Secret o f Divine Civilization, p. 110, states that, “Observe
to what a degree the lack of education will weaken and degrade a people. Today [1875]
from the standpoint of population the greatest nation in the world is China, which has
something over four hundred million inhabitants. On this account, its government should
be the most distinguished on earth, its people the most acclaimed... Not long ago, a small
contingent of English and French troops went to war with China and defeated that country
so decisively that they took over its capital Peking. Had the Chinese government and
people been abreast of the advanced sciences of the day, had they been skilled in the arts
of civilization, then if all the nations on earth had marched against them the attack would
still have failed... Stranger even than this episode is the fact that the government of Japan
was in the beginning subject to and under the protection of China, and that now for some
years, Japan has opened its eyes and adopted the techniques of contemporary progress and
civilization, promoting sciences and industries of use to the public, and striving to the
utmost of their power and competence until public opinion was focused on reform. This
government has currently advanced to such a point that, although its population is only
one-sixth, or even one-tenth, that of China, it has recently challenged the latter
government, and China has finally been forced to come to terms. Observe carefully how
education and the arts of civilization bring honour, prosperity, independence and freedom
to a government and its people.”

5\. Chinese Spiritual Traditions and the Belief in a Personal
God

It is often claimed that Chinese spiritual traditions are humanist, in the
sense that they do not rely upon the belief of a personal God. Usually,
only Taoist and Confuciamst traditions are discussed. But if the
considerable impact of Buddhism on Chinese culture is acknowledged,
then the situation is quite different.

Our knowledge of God, according to the Bahá'í Writings, is related both
to the attributes of the Manifestations of God, (founders of religion;
Moses, Christ, Buddha, etc), and our self-knowledge. Through their
teachings and lives we are able to unlock our true spiritual potential, and
this is, effectively knowledge of God for us. The Manifestations of God
are likened to be perfect "Mirrors” which reflect the light of the "Sun of
Truth" (God). The "image of God" in human beings is a reflection of the
light cast by these perfect "Mirrors". After referring to man's knowledge
of God, Bahá'u'lláh qualifies what He means by it:

"... these mentionings that have been made of the grades of knowledge
relate to knowledge of the Manifestations of that Sun of Reality, which
casteth Its light upon the Mirrors. And the splendour of that light is in the
hearts, yet it is hidden under the veilings of sense and the conditions of
this earth, even as a candle within a lantern of iron, and only when the
lantern is removed doth the light of the candle shine out. In like manner,
when thou strippest the wrappings of illusion from off thine heart, the
lights of oneness will be made manifest."58

When we think of God, according to the Bahá'í Faith, we are actually
thinking about the spiritual attributes of a Manifestation of God reflected
within ourselves.59 When we praise God, we are not actually saying
anything about God, we are rather learning more about ourselves.
Bahá'u'lláh states:

58 Bahá'u'lláh, The Seven Valleys, pp. 23-4.
59 In the context discussing the attributes of God, 'Abdu'1-Bahá states, “Accordingly all
these attributes, names, praises and eulogies apply to the Places of Manifestation; and all
that we imagine and suppose beside them is mere imagination...” Some Answered
Questions, p. 149.

“Far, far from Thy glory be what mortal man can confirm of Thee, or
attribute unto thee, or the praise with which he can glorify Thee! Whatever
duty Thou has prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the utmost Thy
majesty and glory is but a token of Thy grace unto them, that they may be
enabled to ascend unto the station conferred upon their own inmost being,
the station of the knowledge of their own selves.”60

If our concept of God is inextricably tied to the attributes of a
Manifestation of God, then the great awe and devotion with which Jews
and Muslims worship God, or that Christians worship Christ, is equivalent
to the way Buddhists regard the Buddha. While Jews, Christians and
Muslims pray to God, Buddhists pray to Buddha. While Jews, Christians
and Muslims address God in terms of the Father and Lord, so Buddhists
address the Buddha as the ’’Blessed One" and, "Lord of the World".61 The
Buddha declares that:

"The Tathagata sees the universe face to face and understands its nature.
He proclaims the truth both in its letter and in its spirit, and his doctrine is
glorious in its origin, glorious in its progress, glorious in its
consummation. The Tathagata reveals the higher life in its purity and
perfection."62

These attributes of the Buddha are very similar to those ascribed to the
God of the Bible, Jesus, or the Allah of the Quran. Now these
observations have several consequences for our present discussion.

Our highest conception of God is an inner one, in terms of spiritual
attributes. Ultimately, these attributes do not belong to God at all, but
actually belong to us. There is then, no objective description of God
possible for us, that is, we cannot describe God in terms that are
independent of our spiritual understanding or capacity. The conception of
God as an external force, “The All-Powerful Creator” for instance,
characterises the traditional approach to God in the Semitic religions, but
the inner approach to God, the Immanent One, has also always been
present in traditions. Christ declared, "The Kingdom of God is within

60 Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings, pp. 4-5.
61 see P. Cams, The Gospel o f Buddha, pp. 158-9, where both of these titles are used.
62 ibid., p 142.

you" (Luke 17: 20). In the Quran it is stated that, "And We know what his
soul whispers within him, and we are nearer to him than the jugular vein"
(S 1: 15).

Knowledge of God comes from a process of inner enlightenment inspired
by a Manifestation of God, and this is an irreducibly personal process.
This doctrine shares much with the search for the universal “Buddha
nature” within each human being, which characterised the primary aim of
Chinese Buddhism. Knowledge of God, is then, effectively the discovery
of Buddha’s spiritual attributes within oneself. The personal relationship
that Christians strive to have with Christ through prayer, is similar to the
meditation practice of Buddhists aimed at discovering the universal
“Buddha-nature” within. From this perspective, the belief in a personal
God was very much alive in China. It was expressed primarily in terms of
an inner and personal relationship with the “Universal Buddha” immanent
within the mind. Chinese Buddhism covered a wide range of different
beliefs, from the humanisation of Buddha through to his God-like
exaltation.63 Since Chinese Buddhist monks greatly influenced the pattern
of spiritual life in China, it is reasonable to acknowledge that there were at
least these elements of a personal God belief in China. They did not speak
of the attributes of God, but referred to the spiritual qualities of the
universal Buddha, the “Buddha nature” within the mind, and this from the
Bahá'í point of view, is effectively the same thing.

6\. Conclusion

This paper has argued for Buddhism being the founding inspiration of the
Chinese cultural renaissance in the Tang and Sung dynasties occurring
over a thousand years ago. It calls for a reassessment of the place of
Buddhism in Chinese history. The Chinese culture is usually portrayed as
primarily Confucian. Redressing this balance is somewhat analogous to
pointing out that the European Renaissance was inspired by Islam,64 it
goes against centuries of orthodoxy and ethnocentricity.

Singapore Bahd'i Studies Review, Vol. 2, pp. 175-229.

What implications do the findings of this paper have for science and
religious issues in China from a Bahá'í perspective? The first observation
is that it is misleading to think of the Chinese spiritual tradition as a
“religion without revelation”65. The Chinese Religion consists of three
spiritual traditions, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Buddha is
referred to as a “Manifestation of God” in the Bahá'í writings, comparable
to Jesus, Moses, Muhammad or Krishna,66 so if the Chinese religion
includes Buddhism, it is certainly a “religion with revelation”. This then
provides some ways at least, to apply the basic Bahá'í premise that
religion lies at the root of all civilisations67 to the history of China. It also
allows for the role of a personal God in China, since from the Baháh
perspective, God is effectively understood through the spiritually
transforming impact a Manifestation of God has on people’s inner lives.
Chinese Buddhist monks for centuries sought enlightenment through
meditating on the universal “Buddha-nature” within the mind, and their
spiritual transformation had a considerable impact on Chinese society as a
whole, particularly on the ruling Confucian elite who frequently sought
their company.
