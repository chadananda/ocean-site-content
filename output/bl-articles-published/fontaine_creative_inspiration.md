By 1994, an appointment as a Fellow in the Center for Innovation in Urban
Education (1994-95) at Northeastern University (where I teach) enabled me                                        The Creative Inspiration:

Symbolism and seeing

Through the impetus of the Islamic Revelation, the European Renais-
sance gave rise to a regional renewal of arts and letters. It began in Italy and
moved across Europe, ushering the dawn of ‘the Modern Age’: man-centred,
outward-looking and technologically innovative. As stated by the humanist
writer Lorenzo Valla (1407-57):

The arts of painting, sculpture, modelling and architecture had degener-
> ated for so long and so greatly that they almost died with letters themselves,
> but in this age they have been aroused and come to life again.23

This renewal was informed by the secret teachings of the Cabbalists, He-
brew Scriptures, writings of Plato and the Gnostics and Hermetic texts (first
brought to Florence in 1460 and translated by order of Cosimo de Medici).

Although science and superstition were still inextricably blended in the
16th century, it is interesting to see the visual symbols employed to illustrate
contemporary thinking and the progress of the age. The ‘Painted Table Top’,
1533 (illustration 1) was made by the German painter and wood engraver,
Martin Schaffner of Ulm (d. 1549). It shows, in schematic form, the cosmic
harmonies thought to hold good between the planets (in the centre), the days                                                                                                 Illustration 1

the colours (their dresses) and the metals (the vessels standing next to them).

the Sun (Sunday, Grammar, Hope, yellow, gold); the Moon (Monday, Rhetoric,
Faith, white, silver); Mars (Tuesday, Arithmetic, Strength, red, copper);
Mercury (Wednesday, Logic, Love, grey, quicksilver); Jupiter (Thursday,
Geometry, Justice, blue, tin); Venus (Friday, Music, Holiness, green, lead);
and Saturn (Saturday, Astronomy, Prudence, black, iron).

Incorporated in the landscape of the table painting are numerous symbolic
forms such as flowers (transitoriness and beauty); rabbits (fertility); mountains
