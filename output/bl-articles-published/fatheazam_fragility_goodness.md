  The Fragility of Goodness: Hexis and Práxis in the

Historical Figure of `Abdu’l-Bahá

Shabaz Fatheazam

This paper seeks to understand how internal goodness of character
or soul may be preserved from interference from the world and
how character (hexis) and activity (práxis) may survive the sobering
perspective of immense moral failure on the part of a considerable
portion of humankind and of its leadership. Such apparent betrayal
or dismissal of poetic action as of any practical value is examined
through literature and the lessons of `Abdu’l-Bahá’ in His travels
to the West. The conclusion drawn from these sources will attempt
to show that good character engaged in social action is of sufficient
serious practical importance so as to be able to withstand the strikes
made at the root of goodness itself despite the fact that character and
activity are intimately connected and therefore vulnerable.

Prelude
My generation, born in the 50s, is part of this very important cente-
nary celebration. This century is part of us; we belong to this era as
the era belongs to us. This is because our own lifetime coincides with
half of the 100 years that have transpired since `Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit
to the West and this, my fortuitous and convenient chronological
insertion, thankfully, absolves me from pretending to be a scholar as
I have accumulated views and prejudices of events as a contemporary
rather than as a scholar and my information, understanding or even
patent contradiction between personal experience and the facts of

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

this period may be considered what social anthropologists label as
that of a ‘participant observer’. I hope to communicate something of
what I have learned from watching and listening but these thoughts,
in the end, form the opinion of a mortal and the opinion of mortals,
as the ancients would advise us, is not to be trusted.1

Shoghi Effendi referred to `Abdu’l-Bahá’s travels to the West as
“missionary journeys”2 and this “triumphal progress through the chief

> cities of the United States” 3 brought unprecedented animus and
> combative urgency to our era and to America. Then, as indeed now,
> there exists the tension between two divergent conceptions of this
> nation: does America mean commitment to a national experiment or
> consecration of a national destiny. `Abdu’l-Bahá reinforced the latter.
> Even Crèvecoeur, the French correspondent, still astonishes by the
> contemporaneity of his eighteenth century answer to his own famous
> question: “What then is the American, this new man?”4 Every epoch
> is “immediate to God” but the Founding Fathers were apprehensive
> as the history of antiquity had taught them that republics perish,
> that glory is transient, and just as man is vulnerable through his
> propensity to sin, republics are vulnerable through their propensity
> to corruption.

This warfare between realism and messianism5, between experiment
and destiny, continues to this day. As Bahá’ís in America, we form
a new integration of the social body and a special pivot responsible
for the movements of the historical evolution of this nation. Special
because as Bahá’ís, we have a naturally acute sense of direction and
this can be seen not just in getting the facts right, but in each of us
having a clear judgment as to the ultimate nature of our long-term
vision over the past and over the future.

This is not a responsibility to take lightly and is a telling engagement
of the complexities we must deal with. But it is not just Bahá’ís who
are history conscious. Our generation, and the one before, is history

> conscious. “This age more than other age is that of a greater histori-
> cal consciousness” to quote a notable British historian writing in the

> and more capable of appreciating the essential nature of the differ-
> ences between our own society and that we wish to usher in. “Man’s

> and complacency? To cut through the vast pervasive resistance of the
> psyche and of society to forsake manmade shibboleths in favor of the
> millennial expectation, “a new heaven and a new earth”? Hope was
> thin and the sleep of reason was producing monsters.9 Such was the
> climate that greeted the Master as he sailed “on the steamship Cedric,
> on March 25, 1912, sailing via Naples direct to New York where He
> arrived on April 11”10 a crusade made more difficult by the fact, as
> mentioned earlier, that American soil was fertile but with no corre-
> sponding drops of concession from the gathering clouds above. And
> yet, this historical figure, this ‘Oriental’ in “an outburst of activity”,
“brought the universal divine principles to bear on the exigencies of

the age.” This Hegelian notion that “The great man of his time is

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

> he who expresses the will and the meaning of that time, and then
> brings it to completion; he acts according to the inner spirit and

> which makes `Abdu’l-Bahá the historical figure He is, aside from the
> overarching, eugenic and superhuman factor of His lasting capacity
> to inspire and mobilize the masses. `Abdu’l-Bahá’s profound love
> for humanity and his quintessential goodness made His leadership
“a public transaction with history”, exemplifying, in consummate

> fashion, the proposition that good individuals can and do make a
> positive difference to history which brings us more closely to the
> subject-matter of today.

Human Nature
Nothing is more fiercely contested than the topic of human nature,
with man resting, on the one hand, on “the apex of creation” and
yet, on the other, precariously lodged lower than angels—an innate,
God-given bi-formity the characterization of which manifests itself
as much for the good as for the bad, depending on which horse is
commanding our chariot, the horse of spirit or appetite.12 Good-
ness is fragile and, therefore, precious precisely because of the kind
of creatures we human beings are and the fact does remain that we
may be incapable of sympathy, unmoved by pain, uncaring of free-
dom, and—no less significant—unable to reason, argue, disagree or
concur. This does not really help the cause of goodness in any way
nor build a very strong case for the altruistic, selfless man. It also
indicates our vulnerability in a life that is “nasty, brutish and short”,13
to cite the memorable observation of Hobbes in The Leviathan. Yet
preferable it is to face this disturbing adversity (‘The struggle itself
toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart’ Albert Camus
from his short essay on The Myth of Sisyphus) 14 and contribute
powerfully to understanding and responding to the challenge than
escape to a life of isolation and eliminate the quality of human life

> such a sense of shame, is not a universal human attribute. “Indeed,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

there existeth in man a faculty which deterreth him from, and guardeth
him against, whatever is unworthy and unseemly, and which is known as
his sense of shame. This, however, is confined to but a few; all have not
possessed, and do not possess, it.”18 Or then is it motivation? That we
find meaning not in anything objective, but in something internal to
ourselves, that it is our desires that determine whether what we do
is worthwhile. Anything is meaningful if we want to do it, indepen-
dently of whether it is reasonable or not to do so.

While such questions clearly illustrate the complexity and range of

> discussion regarding human nature and the difficulty in capturing it
> in precise axiomatic terms yet the need for explicitness, to the extent
> that can be achieved, even in looser terms, must have dialogic merit.
We cannot seek the same answer to two rather different questions:

> what would be good or rational for a person to do? and what would the
> person actually do? Are we not asking too much from people who may
> fail to understand adequately the nature of the uncertainty that may
> be involved in deciding on what to expect in any specific case based on
> the evidence available? Are we not asking too much from people with
‘weakness of will’19 or with incorrigible and innate selfishness?

An impressive start to lifting this cloud of bewilderment may well
be the remark of Augustine in his book Of True Religion: “Refuse
to go outside…Return to yourself. Truth dwells within.”20 We shall
look, then, deeper within ourselves, pause and think, and ask very
quickly: is there a biological case for human selfishness? Humans,
together with other apes and primates, are social mammals and
among social mammals it is relatively easy to find examples of animal
behavior that are anything but selfish.21 Perhaps the most famous
is the way in which dolphins help its injured members to survive. If
a dolphin is so badly wounded that it cannot come to the surface of
the water to breathe, other dolphins will group themselves around
their wounded companion, pushing it upward to the air. Wolves and
wild dogs bring meat back to members of the pack who were not in

on the kill. Chimpanzees lead each other to trees that have ripe fruit.
When hawks fly overhead, blackbirds and thrushes give warning calls,
helping other members of the flock to escape, but perhaps at some risk
of attracting the hawk to themselves. And still many other examples.
But we humans may also be proud to display even higher altruism
than our furry friends, beginning with the family. The readiness of
parents to put the interests of their children ahead of their own inter-
ests is a striking counter-example to the general thesis that people are
selfish. John Stuart Mill described the family ‘as a school of…. loving
forgetfulness of self ’.22 The duties of benevolence to our kin—broth-
ers, sisters and more distant relatives—is also widely accepted in
every society and prominent not to mention caring for others.23 In
brief, human beings often are selfish—altruism it is said, is really
self-interest on disguise—but our biology does not force us to be
so. Recently, and ever-more increasingly, we come across research
that is giving us a different side to the story. These tell us about
sympathy, empathy, cooperation, and collaboration, written by
scientists, evolutionary psychologists, neuroscientists and others.
One such author argues that in pursuing our self-interested goals we
often have an incentive to repay kindness with kindness so others will
do the same when we are in need. We have an incentive to establish
a reputation for niceness so that people would want to work with us.
We have an incentive to work in teams because cohesive groups thrive
and egocentrism does not. Cooperation is as central to evolution as
mutation and selection.24 In short, we must avoid a miniaturized
view of human nature and not allow reasoned ground for behavior,
alone, to be our focus. If we are to make properly considered ultimate
choices, we must become aware of, and feel for, the ethical ramifi-
cations of the way we live. Only then is it possible to make human
goodness a more conscious and coherent part of everyday life. Is
there a model, a cosmos of human goodness, to which we may turn
for absolute moral wisdom which allows our limited human intel-
lect to frame a perfect ideal of rational conduct not foredoomed to
inevitable failure or is every agent actuated only by self-interest, that

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

the contemporary human being is ‘for the most part an impure egoist,
a mixed utilitarian’? 25

Images of Perfection
In the figure of `Abdu’l-Bahá we can look to the world outside and
follow a living, historical, ‘perfect Exemplar’, this “…most perfect
bounty… sent…down in the form of a human temple.”26 Images
of perfection distilled in one man. We can observe and marvel at
this ‘Orb of the beauty of the great’. `Abdu’l-Bahá embodied, in both
content and style, a unique conception of human excellence. While
not free from the vulnerability of human lives to fortune, while not
protected from the mutability of circumstance, while never distant
from the existence of opposition and conflict in His commitments,
while consistently challenged by the complexity, the indeterminacy,
the sheer difficulty of actual human deliberation, His was a human
story which, while sufficiently distant from our experience, counts
as a shared extension of all of humanity’s experience. His life was
rooted firmly in the divine, and as such God-loved, and thusly,
immortal as ever a human being can be. We turn to the wise not
in despair, grappling as we are with the widespread loss of religious
faith, but to try and be as they were, to follow what they preached,
to look to what they saw, and as such, gain insight into our own
intuitions about living the life. `Abdu’l-Bahá led His life in a way for
us to learn and study the morally salient, that hunting and trapping
are inappropriate aims of a human life, that human excellence in
its nature is other-related and social and that the true value of our
rationality lies in openness, receptivity and wonder. As interpret-
ers of His life, we must respond emotionally. He would like to see
that our cognitive activity, as we explore the True Exemplar, cen-
trally involves emotional response. That we discover what we think
about Him partly by noticing how we feel about Him. In other
words, `Abdu’l-Bahá is the compass which is to guide our personal

The Fragility of Goodness

investigation into our own emotional geography as a major part of
our search for self-knowledge. But His sympathy, generosity, and
public spirit27 did not inhibit `Abdu’l-Bahá from pressing for social
improvement through systematic reasoning. His works continue
to remain unexhausted, subject to perennial reassessment. His
translucent art of writing was purified from non-intellectual appeals
and His talks clear and recognizable with a philosophical style at
once content-neutral, at once speculative, and mostly practical. He
was uniquely able to display opposed conceptions of human reason,
ranging from abstract contemplation to a versatile and resourceful
type of intelligence that concerns itself with mutable objects in a
world of concrete particulars.

`Abdu’l-Bahá is a meticulously crafted working-through of a unique

> human story, ‘abundant, spacious, and immeasurable’28 designed
> to bring certain themes and questions to our attention. His story
> advances our conversation so we may complete those life projects
> necessary to complete His. He did not teach us to seek the solitary
> good life but the good life with friends, loved ones, and community.
> He did not teach us to consider the intellect as pure sunlight, but as
> flowing water, given and received. He did not teach us leadership as
> statecraft but as service; it is the servant leader, with his humility,
> that shows the way, sets the patterns and holds society together and
> when these patterns disappear so too does society, slowly. Progress
> stands or falls on the quality of servant leadership.29 Without ser-
> vant leadership movement in history is short-lived. Humility, the
> willingness to lead and encourage from behind, was what generated
> such strong emotions of respect and esteem for `Abdu’l-Bahá and
> which form part of Aristotlean philia, loving the whole of another
> person for that person’s own sake. `Abdu’l-Bahá’s humility and
> self-effacement generates a strong desire to be more like him. This
> principle works powerfully in society, where shared public models of
> excellence play an important motivating role, and philia has greater
> motivational power through emulation that cannot be replaced by

a more general social modeling. `Abdu’l-Bahá’s example excels all
other models of goodness precisely because of the strength of emula-
tion and aspiration that is generated by the presence of this uniquely
loved person who never failed to endorse the value of the virtue
humility. “…under no circumstances, whatsoever,’ He says ‘should we
assume any attitude except that of gentleness and humility.”30

> ing social and intellectual leader, was the perfect representative of
> a creator of social forces which change the shape of the world and

> where both the intellectual and the generative component co-exist32 .

The notion of genius is best begun with St. Augustine’s statement:
“Quid est genius? [What is genius?] “Deus qui praepositus est ac vim

> habet omnium rerum gignendarum...”[God hath purposed it to be
> He who regenerates all things]33 This reminds us of Bahá’u’lláh’s own
> words on the regenerating power of His Son: “Render thanks unto
> God, O people, for His appearance; for verily He is the most great Favour
> unto you, the most perfect bounty upon you; and through Him every
> mouldering bone is quickened. Whoso turneth towards Him hath turned
> towards God, and whoso turneth away from Him hath turned away from
> My Beauty, hath repudiated My Proof, and transgressed against Me. He
> is the Trust of God amongst you, His charge within you, His manifesta-
> tion unto you and His appearance among His favoured servants . . . We
> have sent Him down in the form of a human temple. Blest and sanctified
> be God Who createth whatsoever He willeth through His inviolable His
> infallible decree. They who deprive themselves of the shadow of the Branch,

are lost in the wilderness of error are consumed by the heat of worldly
desires, and are of those who will assuredly perish.”34

The Ultimate Criterion of Goodness
There is this common fault of minds for which the vision of life
becomes an obsession to group things either into a larger mystery
or into a larger library where everything is diligently, but separately,
catalogued and labeled rather than brought into a unified whole. The
historical figure of `Abdu’l-Bahá avoids either extreme because He is
truth in the appearance—His perfection dismisses the objectionable
dilemma of us having to adopt a standpoint of perfection which pur-
ports to survey all lives neutrally and coolly from a viewpoint outside
our own particular life which will immediately stand accused of failure
of reference, for in removing ourselves from all worldy experience we
are also removing ourselves from the bases of discourse about the
world. With `Abdu’l-Bahá we do not need to take up a stand outside
of the conditions of our normal human life but base our judgment
on His long and broad and deep experience of practical and spiritual
wisdom. In this sense, our ultimate criterion of goodness cannot be
theoretical but practical. But is it practical? This is a legitimate ques-
tion if the life of `Abdu’l-Bahá is not attainable with our capabilities.
The life of a divine being might be ever so admirable but the study of
his life, insofar as it lies beyond our capabilities, is not pertinent to the
practical claims of ethics. Our humble response is this: make goodness,
at the very minimum, to be an acceptable life that we can live. Use the
historical figure of `Abdu’l-Bahá both as a predictive device (trying to
guess what He would likely do in a given situation) and as a criterion
of goodness (assessing what norms must be followed for our choice to
be seen as good). In brief, deliberately maximize behavior, that which
you are trying to promote in terms of human excellence, and actu-
ally do it. As Aristotle would say: “Excellence is a state of character
(hexis) concerned with choice…determined by a person of practical

wisdom.”35 In his view, the person of practical wisdom is a person of
good character. There is a statement of `Abdu’l-Bahá akin to this. “...
the happiness and greatness, the rank and station, the pleasure and peace,
of an individual have never consisted in his personal wealth, but rather in
his excellent character, his high resolve, the breadth of his learning, and his
ability to solve difficult problems.”36

But as mentioned earlier, rational choice of what to do is not a
predictor of what is actually chosen. The faculty of will has to be
considered. Free will makes moral responsibility possible and, con-
sequently, makes it as important as the faculty of discrimination
or perception, the most valuable manifestation of our practical
rationality. We may be intellectually ready to follow `Abdu’l-Bahá
but our will is not willing. Not just the going but the arriving also
requires nothing other than the willingness to go. Our will can-
not be split in two. What is necessary, paraphrasing Augustine, is
willing strongly and wholly, not the turning and twisting one way
and another of a will half-wounded, struggling with one part—the
beast—rising up while the other part—the angel—falls down. The
beast in this case being the rational appetite (affectio commodi) to
will for one’s own advantage and the angel in us, our inclination for
justice (affectio justitiae). The first explains our inclination toward
what is good for ourselves, that which most contributes to our
own happiness; the second is to do good regardless of whether it
has any connection to ourselves, the inclination for justice which
resists pure self-interest. It is the latter that must be developed as
it grounds our crucial capacity to love God and for His own sake
rather for our own reward.

How is our will trained? Our will is shaped by habitual decisions.
Acquiring the right sort of habit from an early age is very important,
indeed all-important. All the human virtues, in the final analysis, are
dispositions of the will so human goodness requires that the will be
infused with virtue. A will that has been badly habituated from a

young age can find itself in the iron grip of necessity making it very
difficult for us to transform on our own. The importance of habit
may be summarized by Aristotle’s expression of the point: “the Law
has no power towards obedience but that of habit”.37 People have a
natural capacity for good character, and this capacity is developed
through practice. A capacity does not come first (i.e., it does not pre-
cede an action)—it is developed through practice. Habits are devel-
oped through acting; a person’s character is the structure of habits
and is formed by what that person does. Once brought up in good
habits, ethical values are in us: they form the internal structure of
our nature, making us psychologically stable against any events that
the world can devise. Thusly, human virtue becomes incorruptible.
Taking action inconsistent with core values is irresponsible and
undisciplined.

In the Bahá’í teachings, however, there is an added dimension to habit
formation and that is the power of divine assistance and grace. “The
labor is beyond me’, Augustine cried, ‘until you open the way.”38 This
role of grace in perfecting virtue is central to Bahá’í teachings hence
the importance of prayer and fasting, in particular, and our spiritu-
alization in general. `Abdu’l-Bahá says “that prayer is indispensable
and obligatory, and man under no pretext whatever is excused therefrom
unless he be mentally unsound or an insurmountable obstacle prevent
him.”39 As to observing the fast Bahá’u’lláh tells us that it purifies
our souls and rids us of all attachment to anyone but God. This is
supremely important if we wish to acquire divine grace. Consequently,
we, as Bahá’ís, do not believe in failure of will but in a flawed disposi-
tion of will which makes it impossible for us to be efficacious as moral
human beings. To live in a state of grace we need spiritual receptivity
and volition. We have to be as talented in our spiritual architecture
as engineers are clever in their design. The colossal gossamer tracery
of iron called the Eiffel Tower, at the time of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to
Paris, the world’s tallest structure at 1,050 feet, weighs at more than
10,000 tons and yet it exerts a pressure of only 57 pounds per square

inch upon the ground!40 A titanic grace amidst sinuating, intricate,
testing and opposing metallic knots and bolts. Similarly the principles
of magnetism, constructive interaction and testing are central to our
process of spiritualization.41 Action (práxis) carried out in a spirit
of devotion and consecration attracts a great spiritual force just as in
the mundane world certain arrangements of atoms attract the force of
magnetism. “Today, as never before, the magnet which attracts bless-
ings from on high is teaching the Faith of God.”42 In another place,
the Guardian says, “consecration to the glorious task of spreading the
Faith and living the Bahá’í life ... creates the magnet for the Holy Spirit.”43
Constructive interaction, the second principle, is persisting with the
efforts despite the tidal wave of lethargy and apathy. One has only to
begin. ‘’Abdu’l-Bahá reportedly said “Make a start, make a beginning.
You will attract spiritual powers. This will reinforce your endeavors. You
will do even more, attract even greater spiritual powers...”44 By making
an effort we attract even more power, which enables us to bear more
weight and responsibility and so it builds up from there, to fight irre-
spective of the consequences:

“And do not think of the fruit of action.

Fare forward.
...    		                    Not fare well,

But fare forward, voyagers.

T.S. Eliot ‘Four Quartets’—The Dry Salvages Part III.

The third principle is that of testing and this is inevitable. “We are
tested to see if we really have the fortitude, the strength, the deter-
mination to persist in the face of adversity, in the face of distraction,
in the face of ridicule, in the face of the desire to relax, to avoid the
hardship and the effort that is involved.”45 To emerge from all this
whole, good and strong willed requires the mind of an architect, the
creativity of the engineer and the strength and perseverance of the
construction worker.

Closing Remarks

The Bahá’í Faith spans just two lifetimes; it is too green a plant.
It has yet to be nurtured, to grow, to mature, to become a “model
for study”. Can its destiny of ever flourishing to be the spiritual
commonwealth of the globe be challenged at any time? Religion
has bestowed human safety and human beneficence but it also
has shocked for its repellant violence, crudity, dangerous lies and
spectacle of decline. Religious decline is largely self-inflicted and the
answer to the question of whether the Bahá’í Faith shall emerge as
the global religion lies in us. Why else would the Báb mention in the
Bayán “…that every religion of the past was fit to become universal. The
only reason why they failed to attain that mark was the incompetence
of their followers.”46 Bad soil, receiving opportunities from God, may
yield a good crop. Good soil, however, if it fails to get what it needs,
will give a bad crop. We must tend to our garden and preserve internal
goodness by pulling out the fleshly weeds. Religion depends on the
nourishment of human goodness to thrive and on the incorruptibility
of a noble character. And the greatest part of a noble character is
guilelessness, openness, simplicity and with the departure of open-
ness comes a loss of goodness. If I question everything and look for
betrayal instead of consolation behind every expression of love, I am,
quite simply, no longer a noble person, perhaps no longer a person at
all. We need religion, its ‘laws and immutable norms born in the airy
heavens’ to effect a righting of the balance when a human requirement
is violated from the interference of the world. But religion also needs
us; it rests on the stability of good actions in times of adversity, strong
enough to withstand the blast of chance events, impurity and betrayal,
and we must defend it against the vulnerability to rottenness when
trust or the covenant is violated, as vulnerable as a child’s trusting
simplicity. All of human life and its institutions stand in need of a
proper rhythm and harmonious adjustment; the adjustment is not
natural (it requires the intervention of habit, discipline and external
assistance to reach its natural ends) but the need for it is. Moral training

promotes healthy and natural growth—it is the straightening of the
tree with moral excellence the embodiment of its straightness. Be it
action, rule or disposition, moral excellence remains the culmination
of a conscious and comprehensive spiritual outcome where eye, mind
and heart are not at ‘mortal war’ but conquering. 47 However good we
make ourselves true goodness remains a free gift of God.

15   In the time of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s travels to the West, the only genocide in

the modern sense of the word, (the term first appeared in 1941), would

29   The phrase “Servant Leadership” was coined by Robert K. Greenleaf in

> The Servant as Leader, an essay that he first published in 1970. In that
> essay, he said:”The servant-leader is servant first… It begins with the
> natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious
> choice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply different from
> one who is leader first, perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual
> power drive or to acquire material possessions…The leader-first and the
> servant-first are two extreme types. Between them there are shadings
> and blends that are part of the infinite variety of human nature.” “The
> difference manifests itself in the care taken by the servant-first to make
> sure that other people’s highest priority needs are being served. The best
> test, and difficult to administer, is: Do those served grow as persons? Do
> they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous,
> more likely themselves to become servants? And, what is the effect on
> the least privileged in society? Will they benefit or at least not be further
> deprived?” Refer to the site www.greenleaf.org for articles and books on
> this very special subject of leadership.

31   Carlyle comments in his book On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic

47    A scholar at Stanford University, ironically, the same University which
