> **Abstract:**  
>   
> Can we create a spiritualizing pedagogy in a world that is culturally and religiously very diverse? Does the post-modern assertion that there can no longer be a (satisfying) grand narrative render such a project futile? In this presentation I will give an outline of my doctoral dissertation, which provides a Bahá'í-inspired model of education.  
>   
> This autobiographically-derived, and narratively-voiced, thesis is one teacher's story. From that story a spiritualizing model of education is argued, toward making a paradigm shift. The suggested shift involves placing 'technical' learning within the context of being and becoming fully, and positively, human. Teaching then becomes a matter of enabling development of the individual's Caring, Creative and Critical abilities, developed within the Community (the 4Cs), inspired by the light of higher-order values — the remainder being processes and content. The thesis makes an original contribution to educational knowledge through the educational life-story, and through making explicit a model out of that life-experience. The suggested model of spiritualizing pedagogy, called SunWALK, therefore is grounded in accounts of the writer's major educational life-events. In particular it presents epiphanous encounters undergone in meeting three 'discourse-communities': the Bahá'í Faith, the teaching of English, and Philosophy for Children. These are seen as providing the three intrapersonal 'voices' of human engagement, Caring, Creativity and Criticality, which correspondingly have three ways of knowing: the 'social-others-centred', the 'subjective-creative-mystical' and the 'objective-reasoning-scientific'. A fourth discourse-community, that of holistic education, is the educational sub-domain to situate the thesis.  
>   
> A conceptual framework for the model is outlined, using concepts gleaned from the four discourse-communities. A view of 'the Whole', and of heart-knowing, is presented, to counter-balance the conceptual. Heart-knowing, the 'subjective-creative-mystical', is seen as an innate, intuitive way of knowing, c.f. the methods of the 'objective-reasoning-scientific'. The third form, i.e. 'social knowing', is seen as deriving from the cultural, interpersonal, matrix of family and community relationships - internalized as Caring.  
>   
> The conceptual and heart-knowing are brought together, via a 'conceptual-contemplative-conceptual' cyclical approach, using a 'Mandala Diagram'. The idea of 'Dialectical Spiritualization' is developed, as that which the four 'Cs' have in common.

The SunWALK Bahá’í-inspired model of education sees the key
challenge for education as establishing the spiritual-moral and the
creative-subjective as co-equal modes with the mode that currently
dominates; the reasoning-objective. SunWALK presents a view of
education that centres on the human spirit. The human spirit is seen
as the three intrapersonal dimensions of Caring, Creativity and
Criticality. The fourth ‘C’, Community’ includes the interpersonal-
social and the cultural. Inspired by principles evident in the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh and Abdu’l-Bahá teaching and learning are presented
as the development of consciousness and abilities in these four ‘Cs’.
Development is seen as being brought about via processes of
dialogue, service and the creation and deconstruction of ‘texts’- texts
chosen as higher-order expressions from within the arts, humanities
and sciences. In SunWALK we study texts, including the text of self,
in a ‘nest’ of contexts — of family, classroom, community and the
ultimate ground of being, that Whole that we call the presence of
God.

Summary of the meanings of the elements in the SunWALK ‘logo-diagram-mandala’

The SunWALK model brings aspects of ‘Western’ and ‘Eastern’ world-views into harmony. The
‘Sun’ = our source of spiritual inspiration & values. WALK = Willing & wise Action through
Loving & Knowing — the most general goal for education. The logo combines the following
sub-models:

> a) An ‘interior’ model of the human spirit - in relation to ‘the world’.
b) A model for re-positioning education within being & becoming human — in the world

with others.

> c) A general model of the curriculum - for primary, secondary and higher education.
> d) A framework for the analysis and evaluation of teaching episodes or projects.
> e) A model of education that makes spiritual education and moral education intrinsic.
> THE MODEL IN ONE SENTENCE: - the SunWALK model of spiritualizing pedagogy
> sees human education as the storied development of meaning, which is constructed, and de-
> constructed, physically mentally and spiritually, through Wise & Willing Action, via
> Loving and Knowing — developed in Community, through the ‘Dialectical
> Spiritualization1 ‘ of Caring, Creativity & Criticality processes, all undertaken in the light
> of the ‘Sun’ of chosen higher- order values and beliefs, using best available, appropriate
> content.

Th e o ut er ring o f the SunWAL K logo combines two dimensions: 1 ‘Commu nity’ i.e. the
social, interpersonal dimension of interaction with other individuals or groups. 2 ‘Cultural
sources’ including such dimensions as traditions, the political & the legal.
Summary of the meanings, Lights

cont. of ‘Irfán Book Six 175
The three major divisions of the arts, sciences and humanities are here thought of as the
stored, yet dynamic, accumulation of knowledge and beliefs and procedures — everything
from galleries to written laws of physics that the individual can draw upon or be influenced
by. This is the ‘stuff out there’ rather than the interiority of consciousness.

In SunWAL K e v erything within the inn er circle = a representation of
‘interiority’, i.e. human consciousness - the human spirit. The human spirit is presented
intrapersonally as 3 ‘voices’ - 3 modes of being & of engaging with reality & of knowing —
that emanate from the singleness of ‘heart-mind’ as (metaphorically) the ‘primary colours’ of
Creativity (the yellow of inspiration), Criticality (the blue of reason) & Caring (the red
warmth of love)

Creativity is the ‘I’ voice of subjective engagement via an artistic medium - it is
particularly related to the core virtue ‘beauty’ and to ‘the Arts’. Criticality is the ‘IT’ voice
of objective engagement which enables progress in the Sciences (& Math., Philosophy and
‘critical’ studies). It is concerned with objective knowing - related particularly to the core
virtue ‘truth’ . Caring is the ‘WE’ voice which enables moral engagement — for progress in
the moral domain and in service of others. It is concerned with social knowing — related
particularly to the core virtue ‘goodness’ and to ‘the Humanities’.

The physical dimension is seen as the instrument for the flow of spirit in all of its forms
— e.g. via dance drama & PE.

Each individual develops her/his I, WE and IT voices, the 3Cs, via socialization,
starting in the family, the local community and then later in formal education. A sense of
justice is seen as paramount intrapersonally as well as interpersonally i.e. it enables us to
engage with that which is beautiful, good or true with balance, clarity & due weight.

The essential process in all 4Cs is multi-level dialogue. In the case of the individual
dialogue is seen as meditation, reflection and inner-talk. In the case of groups it is dialectical
process via consultation.

The ‘Celtic’ knot that surrounds the central shield indicates that the 3Cs are simply
aspects of the one human spirit — the flow of ‘heart-mind’.

The white shield at the centre represents the meditative state in which there is no
‘focused’ engagement via one of the 3Cs — and in which there is relatively little of the ‘white
noise’ interference that we experience in the unquiet mind. This can enable us to ‘go beyond
ourselves’, i.e. transcend our normal knowing — any of the 3Cs (I, WE or IT modes) can be a
pathway to the transcendent and to subsequent improved insight into reality.

The black dot at the centre is the ‘well-spring’ of consciousness. For artists (and great
scientists) it is the Muse. For religionists it is the voice of God within (albeit distorted by the
dust of self). For non-religionists it is the inner source of spirit as energy & inspiration —
the little bits of realization and insight that come to us for which we don’t make an effort.

Educating the human spirit is seen as nurturing the life-force which culminates in the
developed human who, through higher-order consciousness, realizes abilities from within
Caring, Creative or Critical engagements. Teaching is seen as nurturing and cultivating what
is normally present, almost from birth, & certainly by the time we go to school — namely the
flow of spirit expressed in nascent forms of Caring, Creativity, and Criticality — in
Community with others. Holistic Learning takes place when the learner uses Creativity,
Criticality and Caring — in Community — inspired by higher-order values — in dynamic
combinations such as Creativity providing texts for criticality - which then via dialogue
produce the spirit for more creativity.

In SunWALK spirituality is not a dimension; it is the model as a whole. In SunWALK
moral education is not a dimension — they are one and the same. The SunWALK logo can also
be seen as a mandala, or even as a plan drawing for a fountain or a ‘temple of light’!
SunWALK is a major shift to a process view of the world, of being human and of educating
our young people. It rejects a worldview that is limited to the mechanistic, the ‘human-as-
computer, the fragmentary and the materialistic; seeking instead modelling that is based on
flow/process, holism and the spiritual.

176 Bahá’í-Inspired Education

Intr oducti on

This paper gives a brief account of some of the main features of
‘the SunWALK model’ and its rootedness in the Bahá’í Faith’s
writings. SunWALK is a new model of education designed to reflect
the paradigm shift inherent in the coming of the Bahá’í Revelation.

The model is radical in that it paradigmatically shifts the main
focus of education toward a range of ‘new’ dimensions. For example:

> from the material to the spiritual,
> from a concern with fragments to a concern with the Whole and
> its parts
> from knowledge as trading in ‘stuff out there’ to knowledge as
> being and becoming via multi-level dialogue
> from the competitive acquisition of ‘having’ to self-realization —
> through being and acting in service
> from teaching as ‘instructing’ and ‘training’ to education as
> nurturing and growth inducement
> from repetition and reproduction to the raising of consciousness
> and the solving of problems
> from merely technical learning to technical learning within the
> context of being and becoming human — in the world with
> others
> However such shifts are secondary to the most simple but
challenging shift, which is the shift to education as the nurturing of
the flow of the human spirit — as a river flows, as life-energy or ‘chi’
flows (the reader might like to look immediately at the ‘nub’ of the
model section below; see Part 1, p. 180). This of course echoes the
idea that we are spiritual beings having an embodied experience.

SunWALK was developed in my doctoral thesis. It was chiefly
forged out of the daily teaching of English with, mainly, 12 to 13
year olds in a Roman Catholic middle school plus a variety of Bahá’í
youth groups and their friends. The thesis was entitled Spiritualizing
Pedagogy: education as the art of working with the human spirit.
Until a publisher is found the thesis can be found at
http://www.holisticeducation.org.uk

Our mainstream education is notoriously conservative and is, so I
will argue, unnecessarily complicated. SunWALK is a radical way to
simplify educational modelling without losing the best of
contemporary thinking, and, indeed, the best of the wisdom of the
past. This broad concept of wisdom also means that we can respect,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 177

and draw upon, the total treasure-house of our planet’s many and
varied cultures. Celebrating diversity, and the oneness that is at the
centre of reality, can provide the guiding principles — for education
as well as for the unification of the family of humankind. The
alternative seems to be that we more agonizingly get forged into
greater unity through such catastrophic events as the recent Tsunami
disaster. Such events and the worldwide compassionate response to
them belie the postmodernist claim that there is no grand narrative.
In the SunWALK model of education the eternal grand narrative is
the ‘story of stories’ — of being and becoming human in the world
with others. Story is one of the major means for making of the parts
a whole. It is the chief means by which we make sense of our life
experiences.

With regard to ‘story’ the thesis developed what has been called a
new form of methodology, named ‘applied autoethnography’.
Autoethnography is an established, but still emergent, form of
qualitative research. Described by Ellis and Bochner (2000) it is:

> an autobiographical genre of writing and research that
> displays multiple layers of consciousness, connecting the
> personal to the cultural. Back and forth autoethnographer’s
> gaze, first through an ethnographic wide-angle lens,
> focussing outward on social and cultural aspects of their
> personal experience; then they look inward, exposing a
> vulnerable self that is moved by and may move through,
> refract, and resist cultural interpretations — see Deck,
> (1990); Neuman, (1996); Reed-Danahay, (1997). As they
> zoom backward and forward, inward and outward,
> distinctions between the personal and cultural become
> blurred, sometimes beyond distinct recognition. Usually
> written in first-person voice, autoethnographic texts appear
> in a variety of forms — short stories, poetry, fiction, novels,
> photographic essays, personal essays, journals, fragmented
> and layered writing and social science prose. In these texts,
> concrete action, dialogue, emotion embodiment, spirituality,
> and self-consciousness are featured, appearing as relational
> and institutional stories affected by history, social structure,
> and culture, which themselves are dialectically revealed
> through action, feeling, thought and language. (emphasis
> added)
To the underlined elements, and the italicised passage, in the above
quotation I would like to make connection with principles evident in
Bahá’í writings.

Firstly the Universal House of Justice, when guidance was sought
in 1992, suggested a dialectical process of going back and forth — in

178 Bahá’í-Inspired Education

this case between Bahá’í writings and positive aspects               of
contemporary educational theory and practice. They said;

> [We] might make a contribution to the evolutionary process
> of devising an educational system which “would be in full
> harmony with the spirit of the Bahá’í Teachings”.
> Knowledge of educational theory, for example, could assist
> (us) in identifying some of the relevant “basic principles”
> and “teaching ideals” that are set out in the Bahá’í Writings.
> Such principles could in turn, serve as a basis for
> highlighting positive aspects of contemporary educational
> theory and practice which could contribute to the
> implementation of Bahá’í “teaching ideals”. (Research Dept.

Memorandum 21st May 1992)
Some degree of innateness or embeddedness in human reality means
that knowledge or virtues are not just ‘stuff out’ there to be
crammed into the learner; rather we should:

> Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.
> Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and
> enable mankind to benefit therefrom. (GWB 260)
> We, as well as the Manifestation of God, are made in the image of
God (though in our case it is potentially and imperfectly). We on our
life-journey are in the business of supporting each other in the
process of manifesting whatever admixture of gifts constitutes each
individual’s uniqueness.

We can see emphasis on interiority, autonomy and subjectivity as
well as on the voice of ‘God within’, along with the importance of
self-understanding and the conditions for true knowing in the
following four Bahá’í quotations (emphases added):

> 1. O SON OF SPIRIT!
> The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; turn
> not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not
> that I may confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with
> thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt
> know of thine own knowledge and not through the
> knowledge of thy neighbor. Ponder this in thy heart; how it
> behooveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift to thee and
> the sign of My loving-kindness. Set it then before thine
> eyes. (HW Arabic #2)
> 2. Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou mayest find Me
> standing within thee, mighty, powerful and self-subsisting.
(HW Arabic # 13)

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 179

> 3. One must ... read the book of his own self, rather than
> some treatise on rhetoric. Wherefore He hath said, “Read
> thy Book: There needeth none but thyself to make out an
> account against thee this day.” (SVFV 51-52)
> 4. Turn your faces to the Sun of Reality. That Sun has
> always risen in the East. Find the answer to your questions in
> your heart. Be as little children. (PUP 213)
> The notion then of autoethnography applied to specific
objectives, such as developing a new model, aims specifically at
utilizing the creativity that lies within individual life experience. It is
a method particularly relevant to the creative and moral spheres just
as scientific methodology is appropriate for the investigation of
objective reality via science. The present writer takes the view that
included in the purpose of the Bahá’í revelation is the subjective
manifestation of potential. Conversely there is a dis-empowering of
the individual when there is the belief that knowledge is simply ‘stuff
out there’ and that it is to be handed down from on high by those
few that know. This work’s against development4. We are protected
because not only is it forbidden for individuals to impose their own
‘reading’ of the Writings on others but also because Abdu’l-Bahá also
set out clearly (PUP 197) the conditions for growth and development.
The three conditions of freedom of conscience, liberty of thought
and right of speech I suggest are not presented by Abdu’l-Bahá as
luxurious and self-indulgent ‘rights’ in an extreme liberal society.
They are nothing less than key dynamics for the whole system to
work, if we are to have development and growth. The same principle
is, I suggest, applied by Abdu’l-Bahá to establish the dialogic basis for
education. He says;

> Most ideas must be taught them through speech, not by
> book learning. One child must question the other
> concerning these things, and the other child must give the
> answer. In this way, they will make great progress. For
> example, mathematical problems must also be taught in the
> form of questions and answers. One of the children asks a
> question and the other must give the answer. Later on, the
> children will of their own accord speak with each other
> concerning these same subjects.... Oral questions must be
> asked and the answers must be given orally. They must
> discuss5 with each other in this manner. (BE 301; emphasis
> added)
These dialogical and dialectical principles go even deeper. Taherzadeh
opens the first volume of his Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh with the
statement that

180 Bahá’í-Inspired Education

> All created things, whether tangible or intangible, come into
> being as a result of the intercourse between two elements
> which assume the functions of male and female. This
> pattern is followed throughout the whole of creation...
Dialogue engages and nourishes subjective potential in the way
that rain, soil and sun nurture the potential of the seed. Because we
have a whole complex of psycho-spiritual cross-checks given by
Abdu’l-Bahá and Bahá’u’lláh we need not fear the subjective.
Abdu’l-Bahá gives us the model of the senses, reason, intuition,
tradition (see SAQ 297; PUP 21-22 and 253-255; PUP 356). Bahá’u’lláh
gives us proofs (His own Self, His Revelation, His words — see GWB
105) and a process (consultation). Combined, this set of dynamics is
more than enough to check any distortions or excesses of
subjectivity.6

Such methodology as autoethnography clearly owes something to
the postmodern viewpoint7. What may be novel is its applied use —
applied in this case to developing a paradigmatic model of education
out of deep reflection on experience — in ‘dialogue’ with a wide
range of public theory.

In the thesis some twenty-five major problems were identified, to
which the model seeks to provide answers. Here I present a few of
the main challenges, and my suggested solutions, indicating examples
of Bahá’í writings that ‘speak’ to the particular issues. The paper is in
two parts. Part I presents some general, foundational, concerns and
Part II asks, and briefly answers, five core questions in relation to
Bahá’í-inspired holistic education.

What’s in a na m e — t h e nub o f t h e mo d e l?

SunWALK as a name, and mnemonic, has two elements. Sun
stands for whatever source of values the individual, or group, draws
upon with which to illumine her/his ‘walking’ of the path of life.
This light and inspiration is also seen as the source of the will to act —
morally (or creatively or critically). WALK stands for the generalized
goal of development in Willing Wise Action through Loving and
Knowing. Will, Action, Love and Knowledge also correspond to the
‘Four Valleys’ as described by Julio Savi in his essay8 entitled “Will,
Knowledge and love as explained in Bahá’u’lláh’s Four Valleys”. This
is the ‘what’ of the model.

The ‘how’ of the model is seen as the balanced, challenging and
nurturing of the dimensions of the human spirit. The human spirit is
seen as dynamic — always being expression in one of three voices: the
‘I’ voice of Creativity, the ‘WE’ voice of Caring and the ‘IT’ voice of
Criticality (see Wilber 1998: 74). These three are interpersonally the
arts, humanities and sciences but the focus in SunWALK is as
corresponding voices, from within the individual’s spirit — through
which we engage with reality.

Evil, or at least harm, comes from the absence of positives or from
imbalance between the 3Cs — and their illumination by higher-order
values or ‘virtues’.

To the three intrapersonal Cs in the model we must add the fourth
C which is termed ‘Community’. Community consists of a) the
interpersonal and social dimension of all of our relationships — our
being in the world with others — and b) the cultural from which we
take all of the various stimuli, via socialization, through which to
develop the three voices. Naturally we develop the ‘I’ voice from
what broadly we call the arts, the ‘WE’ voice from the Humanities
and the ‘IT’ voice from science and philosophy. This starts in the
(reasonably healthy) family, local community and earliest schooling.
Our individualized version of the three voices, and our command,
more or less, of reading the cultural milieu are shaped by the beliefs
and values of the culture in which we find ourselves — as well as our
personal beliefs and values.

Education, and civilization as a whole, needs the best possible
balance between the personal and the group. Failure to enable the
release of individual potential is harmful as is excess licence or group
domination.
T h e n e e d to stay connecte d to t h e perennia l va lu es o f
truth, beauty, goodness, justice and, transcending all, love

My educational studies in addition to their Bahá’í inspiration have
had ‘perennial philosophy’, as the wider community co-equivalent

source of inspiration for ‘holistic education’. Holistic education as a
form of education is to be distinguished from other ‘labels’ such as
‘integrated education’ or the broader ‘alternative education’ because
it puts the ‘Whole’ as greater than us, greater than any bits that we
can fit together, greater than the sum of the parts. That is to say
there is a mystical dimension intrinsic to the term ‘holistic education’
even though holistic education is not ‘faith-specific’. It is, most often
centred on the eternal truths of ‘perennial philosophy’. Such eternal
truths are of course referred to by Bahá’u’lláh as transcending
specific religions — the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past,
eternal in the future (PB 118-9). The mystical connection is necessary
to holistic education and refers, as do the Guardian’s words, the core
of religious faith is that mystic feeling which unites man with God,
(LG 544) to how we relate to Mystery or the Whole. Such being and
relatedness is also described as the Whole, or, in Paul Tillich’s terms,
the ground of all being, or Being-Itself.9

The mystical connection to the Whole might enable us to maintain
an open and prayerful stance toward our theory-making and our
practice development and might consequently help us maintain a
touch of humility in how we view educational challenges and our
tentative solutions. Such a position is far from the ‘lust for certainty’
which is how the writer Karen Armstrong describes fundamentalism.
Fundamentalism of course closes down the possibilities of true
growth. Love on the other hand nurtures diversity as well as unity.
Concerning love Abdu’l-Bahá says:

> Love is the cause of God’s revelation unto man, the vital
> bond inherent, in accordance with the divine creation, in the
> realities of things ...
> Love revealeth with unfailing and limitless power the
> mysteries latent in the universe. (SWAB 27-28)
The challenges of developing a new model of education are many.

The range of concerns from which questions might be posed, is
nothing less than vast. Here as in many challenges we have to set
aside the important in favour of the most important but what is the
most important concern when setting out to develop a new model of
education? Over a number of years the most important question was
sought — on which to construct a model of education. The question
which was settled on was, ‘what is it to be human, positively and
fully?’ This I suggest is the question to which all other educational
questions need to relate. To this was added the question, ‘what are the
characteristics of education as indicated in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá?’

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 183

This paper then focuses on a view of what it is to be human — in
order to provide a clear and simple way to reflect on educational
practice and theory.

What is Holistic Education? This is my working definition:
•   Holistic Education is learning and teaching based on balancing all

> positive aspects of being, & becoming fully human — via the
> realization of interconnectedness & wholeness.
•   Holistic Education seeks to provide for balanced engagement,

> expression and relatedness of the whole person: the physical,
> mental, affective, & spiritual — intrapersonally & interpersonally.
•   Holistic Education seeks to balance content & process. It seeks to

> Critical. It also seeks to maintain a dynamic balance between
> personal and interpersonal-group concerns. The interpersonal,

> are collectively referred to as ‘Community’.
Holistic Education using the SunWALK approach is seen as an
answer to some of the key problems/challenges in education — its
fragmentariness, obviously, but also the need for moral education to
be integral throughout a model as opposed to being a bolt-on’ extra.

Inadequate parenting, or exploitation of children, are not the only
forces that negatively impact on children and their teachers. Political
interference & manipulation, de-professionalization, prevalence of
materialistic philosophies, a mechanistic world view, sheer poverty,
poor teacher education etc. are just some of the issues that shape, or
distort, education. So are all the world’s general ills, terrorism being
the most recently publicized. We could list many such problems.

For me the chief negative characteristic of mainstream education
is its fragmentariness, it lack of wholeness. Children are usually whole
(to start with) but the system progressively atrophies connections and
connectedness. Should Bahá’ís see education as (necessarily) holistic?

A range of statements concerning connectedness are to be found in
Bahá’í writings. Examples are:

> ... all parts of the creational world are of one whole. (BWF
> 364)
> God contains all.... The whole is greater than its parts ... (PT
> 23-7)
> All that exists is God.... (ABL 22)
> Every created thing in the whole universe is but a door
> leading into His knowledge. (GWB 190)
> We cannot segregate the human heart from the
> environment outside us and say that once one of these is
> reformed everything will be improved. Man is organic with
> the world. His inner life moulds the environment & is itself

Together these suggest both a view of reality and a way of
proceeding. If all is God then all is sacred, all is connected, all
potentially leads from and to Him. We need to proceed ever-
conscious of two things; a) our connectedness and the need for the
learner’s realization of, and in, connectedness and b) the infinitely
Unknowable that lies behind the little we know and can know. In our
humanness lies potentially all of the names and attributes of God. In
humanity

> are potentially revealed all the attributes and names of God
> to a degree that no other created being hath excelled or
> surpassed. All these names and attributes are applicable to
> him. Even as He hath said: ‘Man is My mystery, and I am his
> mystery.’ (GWB 177)
> Yet beyond even the fullest expression of those names and
attributes lies mystery — both immanent and transcendent. Mystery is
the ever-present reality (and conditioner) as we look within ourselves
and also as we look at all that is ‘other’ and ‘beyond’. A sense of
Mystery and of the Whole should be ever present as we nurture
thought, feeling and action in education. The writings of A. J
Heschel (1965), in addition to the Bahá’í writings, are a great
inspiration in exploring awe, wonder and the ineffable as well as what
it is to be fully human.

The chief negative consequence of fragmentariness is here seen as
alienation. Alienation breeds anti-social behaviour and possibly ill-

health, and dis-ease. At the heart of alienation is meaninglessness. The
solution to the negative effects of fragmentariness is meaning-full-
ness. The creation of meaning-full-ness is both a personal and a
community responsibility. In SunWALK rich meaning-making comes
from the choice of higher-order texts experienced within higher-
order contexts.

The chief positive consequence of wholeness, through
connectedness, is seen as a sense of belonging and a sense of place
and a sense of identity and, consequently, a sense of purpose. Thereby
our name is named, as in

> O son of man! I loved thy creation, hence I created thee.
> Wherefore, do thou love Me, that I may name thy name and
> fill thy soul with the spirit of life. (HW Arabic # 4)
which is seen as a process, not as a single completed act. The four
‘senses’ above are wholly relevant to the crisis that children and youth
are experiencing in the Western world — and perhaps the world
generally. The Hardwired to Connect10 report enables us to see both a
graphic portrait of the ills of our children and youth and also a way to
help bring healing. The notion of the panel of thirty odd scientists
who contributed to the report is to create ‘authoritative
communities’. These in effect embody the ‘four senses’ I have
mentioned above as a curative way. They also of course embody
support in answering the age-old existential questions of philosophy.
T he teac h er’s viewpoint and simplifying the teach er’s job

The SunWALK model, and its application to holistic education, is
presented from a teacher’s-eye-view of the teaching process. Its
perspective focuses on her/his consciousness, decision-making,
discourse-management, balancing of inner and outer concerns,
environment management etc. as s/he conducts the actual process of
nurturing others learning.

To illustrate the need for simplification I point to the UK National
Curriculum which originally required primary school teachers to teach
more than 200 ‘Attainment Targets’ for each and every child. One of
the consequences of the curse of ‘managerialization’ in education is
the replacement of horticultural metaphors with war metaphors.
Abdu’l-Bahá seems pre-eminently to use natural, horticultural,
metaphors in relation to education.

In SunWALK, on the other hand, I suggest that (in the West, at
least) teachers need only ever teach the development of abilities
within the dimensions of the 4Cs, three being intrapersonal, the other
the interpersonal:
The Intrapersonal:

•   Caring — abilities in other-focusedness — moral acts in service of

others
•   Creativity — abilities in construing reality via subjective

expression
•   Criticality — abilities in ‘reading’ reality via objective description
The Interpersonal:
• in Community — abilities in being and functioning with other

individuals and groups — i.e. includes teamwork and citizenship
• all the rest is forms of information and processing

The emphasis is on more than information or skills. Contexts are
as vital as texts. The supreme text is being and becoming human — in
the world with others — in the light of higher order values drawn
from our ‘Sun.’11 Information on its own is inert. It becomes
knowledge, or even wisdom, when it is placed in a context,
particularly in a values context (assuming raised consciousness in the
person). Lower-order contexts tend to debase human activity. Here I
am arguing for placing information, and all that we do in education
in higher-order contexts. Lower-order contexts tend to provide for
the greed of the individual, or group. Higher-order contexts tend to
be concerned with the good of the whole. We need to stay
consciousness of the contexts, whilst teaching ‘texts’12. In SunWALK
the teaching of the technical is always seen as within the context of
being and becoming more fully human. The ultimate context is of
course Mystery — or the presence of God. A sense of those contexts,
Wilber calls them a nest of holons (1998b: 61), can provide richness
and depth of significance and meaning.

The focuses of unbridled materialism robs children of the chance
to grow into their wholeness. Materialism narrows the meaning that is
made and the sense we have of what it is to be human. The antidote
to materialism is the spiritual, particularly in the sense of richness and
depth of meaning made.

Perhaps this is what the UK Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sachs had in
mind when he said (BBC 1 12.9.04) that the future is built on
memories. He spoke about how today’s children will become the
guardians of memory, so that what we invest in them today will
determine the legacy for tomorrow. Memory is what maintains our
knowing of who we are — but we need the collective memories of
humankind as well our personal memories. Together as contexts and
texts, dynamically interactive, they can provoke our development.

Rabbi Sachs said that children are the big time losers in our
consumer–society because what we give them is material affluence
and spiritual poverty. “Children grow to fill the space we give them,”

the Chief Rabbi said. The space I suggest is determined by nests of
contexts or holons with which we create the worldview within which
we do our teaching. We need to keep hold of eternal values to resist
the onslaught of exploitative materialism, and the dark side of the
postmodernist world-view. So massively de-stabilizing is that
onslaught that it would not be excessive to describe it as a spiritual
tsunami. The only antidote or cure to de-humanization is re-
humanization — which is why humanization is placed at the centre of
the SunWALK model.

It is a bitter-sweet irony that we can only study holistic education
fragmentedly. But we can live with a sense of the Whole — providing
that we recognize that we have no ability to comprehend the Whole.
Bahá’u’lláh says: I know not how to sing Thy praise, how to describe
Thy glory, how to call upon Thy Name. (PM 122) Abdu’l-Bahá says:
truth in its essence cannot be put into words. (ABL 22) Above all that
we know we have to acknowledge the infinity of what we don’t know.

In applying my thesis and model here I needed to summarize (some
aspects of) 12 years’ work. What did I get when I reduced more than
2000 books and papers, and many years of classroom ‘experience and
reflection and study’ to a one sentence version of the model —
consisting of approx 50 words?
T h e 5 0 word ‘one-sent enc e’ v ersion of SunWALK?

> Concepts are delicious snacks with which we try to alleviate
> our amazement. (A. J. Heschel, Man Is Not Alon e 7)
The one sentence version of The SunWALK model of spiritualizing
pedagogy (learning & teaching) sees h u ma n e d uca tion as the

> storied development of meaning, constructed, and de-
> constructed, physically, mentally & spiritually, through Wise
> & Willing Action, via Loving and Knowing — developed in
> Community through Dialectical Spiritualization processes (in
> all 4Cs) — all undertaken in the light of the ‘Sun’ of
> (chosen) higher-order values and beliefs, using the best
> available, appropriate, content.

These are the key elements, sifted from a total list of more than four
hundred concepts, and placed in a single, albeit, complex, sentence.

Presented as a list of elements the same one sentence version of
The SunWALK model of spiritualizing pedagogy looks like this:
1\. the storied development of
2\. meaning
3\. constructed, and
4\. de-constructed

5\. physically,
6\. mentally and
7\. spiritually,
8\. through Wise &
9\. Willing
10\. Action via
11\. Loving and
12\. Knowing developed in
13\. Community through
14\. Dialectical Spiritualization processes all undertaken in the light of
15\. the ‘Sun’ of (chosen) higher-order values and beliefs
Each of these is a study in its own right, and will constitute chapters
or sections in a forthcoming book version, of the model, but there is
no space here to do that, however in Part II I present a little more
about five of the SunWALK model’s major themes.

Part II — Five Core questi ons and issues fr o m
SunWALK in relation to Bahá’í-inspired education

The five themes, as questions, are:
1\.   What is the central idea around which to build education?
2\.   Given that being and becoming human is the central idea how

should we structure education?

3\.   How is knowing and knowledge viewed?
4\.   What is the key process?
5\.   How should we develop the curriculum and its contexts?
1\. Unity, the central idea around which to build education?

I suggest that the best answer to the question, ‘What is the central
idea around which to build education?’ is the idea of ‘Being and
becoming human, in the world with others, in the light of higher
order values/virtues’. The question, ‘In what can we unite?’ also
springs to mind’. I suggest that the answer to both is that we can
unite in deeper and deeper understanding of what it is to be human —
positively and fully — as guided by the best contemporary thought, as
well as ancient wisdom13. Focus on being and becoming human is not
the same as a Humanist viewpoint. The viewpoint here comes from
the idea that we are made (potentially) in the image of God and also
that we (ideally) grow in the presence of God, a presence that is
maintained through prayer, meditation and engagement in service.

As a representative image of this human-centred modelling
perhaps we can take the beauty of the human face. Beyond the beauty
of the human face, in what then can we unite and in what can we co-
operate? My answer is — in the universality of being human. We are
human, here in the world, and our needs centre on the same realities.
A student on a course on which I was teaching said, in answer to the
question, ‘Where do human rights come from?’, ‘Human rights arise
from human needs’. As is well known the psychologist Abraham
Maslow described these needs and realities as being at eight levels.

> Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs:
> 1. Physiological: hunger, thirst, bodily comforts, etc.;
> 2. Safety/security: out of danger;
> 3. Belonginess and Love: affiliate with others, be accepted; and
4. Esteem: to achieve, be competent, gain approval and

recognition.

> 5. Cognitive: to know, to understand, and explore;
> 6. Aesthetic: symmetry, order, and beauty;
7. Self-actualization: to find self-fulfillment and realize one’s

potential; &
8. Self-transcendence: to connect to something beyond the ego

> or to help others find self-fulfillment and realize their
> potential.
Human needs, and the rights and responsibilities attached to them,
indicate the shared experience we have, and are as such grounded in
such essential fellow-feelings as empathy and compassion. But this
taxonomy of needs doesn’t tell us what medium it is with which the
teacher works, in the way that the sculptor works with stone, or the
painter with paint and canvas, or the dancer with body and space.
With w h at me dium does th e teac h er-as-artist work, as the
sculptor works with stone or the dancer with h er body?

My answer is the human spirit — her own and her pupils. How
might we construe that spirit? My answer is as the flow of ‘spirit-as-
the-life-force’ (chi?)

One analogy for the ‘flow of spirit-as-the-life-force’ is water
flowing. Another analogy lies in the flow of energy as dancer dances.
Another metaphor for ‘the flow of spirit-as-the-life-force’ is that of
white light. These metaphors are the opposite of the mechanistic
‘human-as-computers’ or the older ‘humans-as-machines’ metaphors.

Since, following Abdu’l-Bahá, I see teachers as ‘developers of
consciousness’14 I here am focusing on the idea of the life-force, in a
normal person, culminating in (raised) consciousness. I also use the

term interiority to refer to consciousness. By interiority I mean
‘affective awareness’ and ‘moral awareness’ as well as ‘cognitive
awareness’ — hence my preference for ‘heart-mind’ as a term for
interiority. Thoughts lead to feelings and vice versa. In the West,
post-Enlightenment, the heart and feelings have been presented as an
opposite to the ‘real thing’ i.e. to reason. As with the elimination of
the secondary status of women, peace for the human family needs a
re-balancing of heart and head and a re-legitimization of other ways
of knowing!

Metaphorically undifferentiated consciousness I suggest can be
viewed as white light. When the light is differentiated I suggest we
be concerned not with a full spectrum but with just the ‘primary
colours’. The primary colours of the human, the life-force in its
spiritual form (i.e. all that is not-biological) can be seen as the red of
the warmth of caring, the blue of cold reason, and the yellow of
expressing creativity. (See logo diagram on p. 174 above, or for
colour version please go to www.holisticeducation.org.uk)

Seen as the three ‘primary colours’, Caring, Creativity and
Criticality are not primarily ways of cognition, certainly not simply
ways of thinking about. They are socially derived ways, and possibly
even ‘hard-wired’ ways of being and of engaging with and acting in
the world. Of course the brain is involved in all three modes — but
not in the sense of reasoning. The 3Cs as presented here (see diagram
2, page 195) are modes of being and doing. It is true that caring
draws upon both the creative, for example via imagination in
empathy, and criticality, for example via estimating the seriousness of
an act, but being moved by some-thing and then moving is a
different mode to thinking about issues15.

In the West it seems to me that ‘other ways of being’ are mistaken
for simply different kinds of cognition or ‘thinking about’. Perhaps
this is relevant to, for example, the feminist objection to the
Kohlbergian developmental model of moral development (see
Gilligan 1998). The evolution of moral maturity is not experienced by
women as a step of improvement in reasoning. In general men, who
hold the majority of the positions of power, are challenged by the
idea that their way of being may not be the only valid way (much like
some powerful nations whose ethnocentricity makes it difficult to
understand that there are other worldviews.) Acknowledging other
ways of knowing is vital for the paradigm shift, especially for a
redress toward justice and peace — both require the establishment of
the equality of women on the world’s stage. The 3Cs are spiritual in
the sense of the ongoing manifestation of the human spirit, but they
are not of themselves the Spiritual16. The Spiritual in the divine sense
is seen as the voice of God that speaks via the Revelations of the

Manifestations (but also to all, relatively, developed human
consciousness) via God immanent: Turn thy sight unto thyself, that
thou mayest find Me standing within thee, mighty, powerful and
self-subsisting (HW Arabic #13).

In the SunWALK model a quiet contemplative state of conscious-
ness is metaphorically, the ‘white light’ state — the state when our
spirit is dis-engaged from any one of the 3Cs. But from the
contemplative we can ‘fire up’ into engagement that is Caring or
Creative or Critical — we move from quietitude to focused
engagement.

In the quietness of the contemplative the ever-present God can
speak to us. Sometimes what we hear is impurified through egotistical
‘interference’, sometimes not. But from an educational point of view
since this is part of how we function as humans, being made in the
image of God, and this needs to be factored into any educational
model that considers itself Spiritual or Bahá’í.

Our psycho-spiritual life consists of events, most of which are
interactions that come through Caring, Creative, Critical and
Communal engagement. To ground these let me say this — Criticality
is the mode we (writer and reader) are in now. Caring would be the
mode of engagement if out of compassion we jumped up to care for
someone who had fallen down. Creativity would be your mode of
engagement if you took an idea and danced it as a dance, or
developed a series of filmic images, or represented it in paint, or as a
sculpture. My sense is that we are only ever in one mode, but the
other two are in the ‘background’ — each is ‘supported’ by the others.
We can ‘hover’ between two modes — but I suspect this means
switching back and forth rapidly between two modes. Whatever brain
science eventually reveals will be interesting but not vital — the
balance behind the three modes and the 4Cs is what education needs.
They enable the eliciting, developing and refining of ‘raw’ spirit into
appropriate and relevant abilities. They are what are needed to ensure
that education is whole, and education that is whole can be
instrumental toward the healing of our ailing world.

In SunWALK the teacher’s job is to develop abilities from within
the framework and dynamics of Caring, Creativity, Criticality in
Community — in the light of the ‘Sun’ of virtues/higher-order values.
The rest is information, and ‘information processing’ utilized for the
development of abilities in the 4Cs. Examples of such abilities are the
ability to analyse, differentiate, classify etc in the case of Criticality.
In the case of Creativity the abilities relate to the use of the various
arts media to express viewpoints subjectively. In the case of Caring
abilities include the capacity to empathise and act with compassion so
as to help others. The model also relates to several of the Ancient

Greeks’ cardinal virtues; truth (Criticality), beauty (Creativity) and
goodness (Caring). Justice is the over-riding virtue in the social realm
but is equally the virtue in interiority that enables us to see reality via
each of the 3Cs. It enables us to develop both autonomy and
authenticity. Justice is seen as the chief ‘conditioning’ influence in all
of the four Cs.

Each mode or voice needs an exemplary way or process to enable
its development in learners. For Criticality my exemplary process is
Professor Matthew Lipman’s philosophical inquiry programme called
Philosophy for Children. For Caring it is Bahá’í teachings and, from a
wider community perspective, perennial philosophy. For Creativity it
is — ‘artistic’ expression in any of its forms.

The 3Cs relate to three domains; the moral, the artistic and the
scientific. Epistemologically the 3Cs provide three forms of knowing
— internalized via socialization — from their various forms of social
and cultural embodiment — such embodiment being every-thing from
family members, to the media and galleries and museums.

As teachers it is our use of task setting and questioning that
provides the opportunities for challenging and nurturing abilities in
all of the 4Cs. The questions & tasks we give to children help
socialize development within the distinct modes of Caring, Creativity
& Criticality and in working in Community. With very young children
the task setting and questioning might be as simple as:

> •   “Please offer the grapes to everyone.” (Caring — Goodness)
•   “Draw me a picture,’ or ‘Dance me a dance.” (Creativity —

Beauty)
•   “Is the green doll larger or smaller?” (Criticality — Truth)
Enlightened, responsible, parents of course get these processes started
from the child’s earliest years and create a good foundation for the
teacher to build on.
2\. Gi v en t h at being and beco ming h u man is t h e c entral
id ea how shou ld w e structure e ducation ?

In SunWALK the 4Cs, become the overall structure for
developing theory and practice. What does this mean? Theoretical
developments are looked at in terms of their value for supporting
further work via the 4Cs framework. We all have frameworks, we all
construe17, but they are not always explicit or shared, not always
articulated so that we know them.

In practice series of lessons need to be looked at in terms of
enabling balanced development between the four Cs. The need to

intensify one area might become apparent following reflection on the
work pupils have achieved over the preceding weeks. Most important
is the ‘juxtaposing of work’ especially the use of work from the
criticality mode being used as a creative challenge, followed by the
opposite i.e. creative work being used as the text for the next piece
of philosophical inquiry. In my experience this ‘dialectic’ can become
the most powerful form of pedagogy, and take the teacher and class
into high-order ‘crossover’ experiences between the critical and the
creative-meditative.
3\. How is knowing and know le dge vie w e d ?

Epistemologically two major shifts are seen as needed in
education. The first is a shift from the mechanistic, atomistic view of
knowledge as ‘stuff out there’ to knowing as a state of being and a
process of engaging with the world. Education is still largely in a
‘transmissive’, ‘Newtonian’, mechanistic mode. The shift is more than
a greater emphasis on experientiality or ‘learning through the mastery
of doing’ — but it includes these re-emphases. It is even more an
emphasis on being, and being in relationship with others, as opposed
to individualistic, regurgitation of information that is largely
meaningless to the learner, except for its instrumental value. The
learner has to find meaning in forms of collective experience as well
as in the personal. As Parker Palmer (1998) says in his book Courage
to Teach;

> It is not enough to get the big story inside the student but
> we also have to get the student inside the big story.

To escape from the dominance of ‘transmission’ a number of
things have to be changed, most notably reliance on teaching that
which can be tested in narrow, regurgitative ways. The answer here
lies in a combination of self, teacher and peer evaluation that is cross-
moderated right up to national level. Standards currently result in
homogenization, which is the opposite of what is needed. We need
standards but standards that are achieved via the principle of
‘harmony in diversity’, as opposed to standards that create
homogenization.

The second shift is away from the ‘god’ of rationality into
recognition of a range of ways of knowing. These can be seen as
including women’s ways of knowing, indigenous people’s ways of
knowing etc., but here I am proposing that education needs to
legitimize four ways of knowing that correspond to the 4Cs in the
model and these are not gender specific or culture specific;

Creativity: The subjective knowing that comes via the imagistic
and other arts media
Caring: The knowing that comes from focusing on others needs

Criticality: The objective knowing that comes from observing,
measuring, repeatability etc

Community: The interpersonal knowing that comes from being
and working with others

The first three forms of knowing correspond with the voices of
‘I’, ‘WE’ and ‘IT’ as described by Ken Wilber in several of his books
(1998a, 1998b, 2000).

In suggesting, as I do, greater emphasis on the other Cs I am not
making an argument to diminish the rational. Far from it, since
reasoning is taught abysmally in many schools. The exemplary process
for criticality in SunWALK, philosophical inquiry, (Lipman’s
Philosophy for Children18), shows us how to raise standards in
reasoning, and reasonableness.

> 4. Q. W hat is t h e k ey process?

The key process for SunWALK is dialogue. It is dialogue that
causes development that is worth having. Dialogue presupposes at
least an element of innate knowing in human reality. Professor of
Mathematics education Gene Maier emphases the vital difference
between education and training;

> “Educate” stems from educere, to lead out, a Latin word
> that lives in Modern English as “educe”. “Train” is from the
> French traîner, to drag behind one, as in “bridal train.” Thus,
> we have two disparate metaphors for teaching: leading out
> or dragging behind.19
The chief purpose of dialogue, and philosophical inquiry, as in
Lipman’s Philosophy for Children, is to educe, to lead out — as in
Bahá’u’lláh’s “Man is a mine...” (GWB 260) I extend the notion of
dialogue into four forms to correspond with the four Cs and the four
ways of knowing.
Intrapersonal dia logue
1\. Caring = d. with and in the heart & with & in relationships — d. in

other-centredness
2\. Creativity = d. with and in and through the materials of the

> chosen medium; focused on expression of the subjective world-
> view (in the meditative) voice; to generate insight subjectively
3\. Criticality = d. with and in texts (math., philosophical, critical)

> focused on expression of the objective voice — to generate
insight objectively

Interpersonal dia logue
4\. Community = d. in and with people (or artefacts) that are part of

> the cultural, legal, social & political milieu — this form of d.
> includes the purpose of maintaining & developing the
social/cultural milieu

The Western separation of affect and cognition can be a curse.

Heart and mind, (heart-mind) are involved, more or less, in all three
modes of engagement. Moral development, for example, as
understood in SunWALK draws upon all forms of engagement and
both affect and cognition. Cognition is sometimes defined as the
psychological result of perception and learning and reasoning. But
knowing and being in relationship do not require constant
‘perception-and-learning-and reasoning’. A mother and baby for
example can ‘talk’ to each other via touch whilst cognitive
involvement can be elsewhere. Diagram 2 indicates a straightforward
way to model the three Cs in relation to affect and cognition —
criticality being more cognitively charged, and less affectively
charged etc. However I still hold to the idea that ultimately interiority
is best seen at ‘bedrock level’ as heart-mind, the flow of the life-force
experienced as interiority or consciousness.

D i a g r a m 2 - The Three C s

The nature of the process and methodology is vital to all aspects,
and users, of the SunWALK model. The researcher and the teacher,
and the teacher-as-researcher, need, as the Americans say, to ‘walk the
talk’. This relates to two general points. Firstly civilized living is seen
as a function of how well a society brings together the private,
subjective sphere, with the public sphere, i.e. the concerns of the
group as a whole. (What passes for democracy in the West may or
may not do better than other forms of government, at least on such
issues as care of children, or of the vulnerable — but its associated
freedoms are vital to the manifestation of potential). The second
general point concerns the conditions for maximizing the
development of potential. Chief amongst the necessary conditions is
the freedom of expression and the use of dialogue. However dialogue

here is seen as more than the exchange of speech. I include creative
expression and meditation and consultation in my broadly-based
definition of ‘multi-level dialogue’, as described earlier, since all of
these provide the stimulus for a person, and the groups to which s/he
belongs to manifest potential.
T h e re v e lation of abilities t hroug h t h e stim ulus o f
dialogic c ha lle nge

Highly relevant to the concern of subjectivity and of maximizing
the development of peoples’ potential are the writings of Charles
Taylor, especially his book The Ethics of Authenticity (1991, p. 61)
where he says;

> The notion that each one of us has an original way of being
> human entails that each of us has to discover what it is to be
> ourselves. But the discovery can’t be made by consulting
> pre-existing models, by hypothesis. So it can be made only
> by articulating it afresh. We discover what we ‘have it in us
> to be’ by becoming that mode of life, by giving expression
> in our speech and action to what is original in us. The notion
> that revelation comes through expression is what I want to
> capture ... (emphasis added)
> The chief means for eliciting potentials is seen then as dialogue,
dialogue in the broadest sense, as described in the multi-level sub-
model of dialogue. Taylor’s revelation through expression is to my
mind more than a definition of ‘acceptable authentic individuality’
compared to ‘unacceptable individualism’. It is the identification of
an essential principle for learning and development. That principle
lies, as I described above, in having the creative and the rational
yoked in dynamic relationship. It also provides an inter-faith (or pan-
religious) way to understand the intuitive voice, the spiritual and the
transcendent form of experience. One pathway to try to build
common ground between the religious and the non-religious views of
the spiritual is via art especially if we are willing to entertain the
closeness of the subjectivity of art and the subjectivity of religious
experience.
5\. How should we develop the curriculum and its contexts?

One of the key notions in SunWALK is that we enable the moral
and spiritual to be present throughout the whole process of
education. One essential way of doing this is to place all technical
learning, from basic reading through to advanced engineering, in the
context of being and becoming positively and fully human in the
world with others. Maslow’s20 hierarchy of human needs if ‘inverted’
gives us the transcendent as the outermost context with which to
embrace all ‘lesser’ focuses.

> 8) Self-transcendence: to connect to something beyond the ego or
> to help others find self-fulfillment and realize their potential.
> 7) Self-actualization: to find self-fulfillment and realize one’s
> potential; &
> 6) Aesthetic: symmetry, order, and beauty;
> 5) Cognitive: to know, to understand, and explore;
> 4) Esteem: to achieve, be competent, gain approval and
> recognition.
> 3) Belonginess and Love: affiliate with others, be accepted; and
> 2) Safety/security: out of danger;
> 1) Physiological: hunger, thirst, bodily comforts, etc. (William
> Huitt, http://chiron.valdosta.edu/whuitt/col/regsys/maslow.html)
> When inverted Maslow’s hierarchy can be seen as a hierarchy of
contexts, rather like Ken Wilber’s nests of holons. In SunWALK the
spiritual is seen as the source of the will to act morally. The spiritual
for me includes two simple ideas a) all that is not biological is
spiritual and b) spirituality is living for others21. Personally I don’t
care what a person’s belief system is so long as s/he is committed to
truth, beauty, goodness and justice. Consider the absurdity, and
horror, of humans being the only ‘animals’ that will kill each other
because they hold to different ideas. “I know that Christ is king, and
I’m prepared to kill you as a consequence.” “I know that Mu˙ammad
is the Seal of the Prophets, and I’m prepared to kill you as a
consequence.” “I know that all religion is the opium of the people
and I’m prepared to kill you as a consequence.” No lower ‘animal’
behaves like this. Whatever our worldview that which can be
cherished, that which can unite us is acknowledging virtues — and in
SunWALK I have chosen as cardinal the virtues of truth, beauty,
goodness and justice.

Consequently development in education is seen as the ability to
frame the curriculum within higher and higher developmental stages.
In using Maslow’s hierarchy ‘inverted’ the suggestion is that we try
framing the more material or biological within the higher order
context of transcendence. The transcendent (potentially) is here taken
at its simplest to mean being able to live primarily in the light of
higher order values, or ‘virtues’, and to be able to stay focused on the
needs of others. ‘Others’ here is seen as ranging from ones own
partner or family through to the human family as a whole. However
the transcendent can mean more, most importantly it is experiences in
which there is loss of ego boundaries, i.e. the subject and object
become one. It is possible that in this ‘the deeply spiritual experience’
and the ‘creative experience’, or the ‘aesthetic experience’, are all the
same — the unifying factor being the movement from subject-object

to an experience of oneness, expressed subsequently as a gain in ‘deep
feeling’ or ‘deep insight’. To include these, the deepest levels of
human experience, requires sensitive, inspired teaching of
considerable ability. SunWALK provides the framework for this kind
of development and international cooperation of the holistic kind can
help us create not just a vision, but working models and proven
practice.
C urricula mod e ls — is t h er e a fourt h le v el?

John P Miller (1996:5-8) suggests three forms/levels of
educational orientation, the Transmissive, the Transactional and the
Trans-formational — but is there a fourth? It seems to me that there is a
case to be made for a fourth namely; the Transcendental. The
transcendent I tentatively suggest might lie in such a deep
engagement, via any one of the four Cs, that there follows an
experience of oneness between subject and object, (preferably)
followed by new insight and new understanding. Unitive experience is
what Wilber calls boundarylessness, or a (temporary) loss of the ego
boundaries22. Unitive experience of itself is not, of course, a
guarantee of virtue. It is the contexts chosen that enable, or deny,
virtues.

We can’t teach transcendence but we can teach to maximize the
possibilities of transcendent experience (but that will have to be the
subject for another paper).

The approach used in SunWALK makes the model a vital new way
to develop initial teacher education, as well as in-service teacher
development. I will write about SunWALK’s application to initial and
in-service teacher education elsewhere but suffice it say that the
model applied to teacher education will involve the same dimensions
that are introduced here. This is to say that I believe that the way to
organize teacher education, as well as the teaching of children, is via
the 4Cs, multi-level dialogue etc.
Conclusion

This paper has provided a brief description of aspects of the
Bahá’í-inspired SunWALK model of holistic education’. It is
concerned particularly with holism in respect of interiority and in
respect of balances between the four modes of engagement with
reality, which in the light of higher-order values, make us human, and
which form a basis for true civilization.

Professionally as teachers we could structure our work on the three
voices found in (Western) civilization the ‘WE’ voice (Caring), the ‘I’
voice (Creativity) and the ‘IT’ voice (Criticality) — in Community —
with the rest of the process being refinement via use of various kinds

of information and processing of that information. SunWALK by
placing all technical learning in a context of being and becoming
human — in the light of higher-order values23 is a way of proceeding
that has the capacity to contribute to the establishment of justice and
peace.

East and West have an abundance of riches to bring to the task of
developing Bahá’í-inspired holistic education. With the 3 modes
corresponding to 3 ‘voices’ and corresponding to more diverse ways
of knowing we have a way to take education into the future —
providing they are linked to the cardinal values of goodness, beauty
and truth, along with justice as the measure and conditioner of all.
That way is a holistic maintaining of glorious diversity — harmonized
by our recognition that we are all in the process of being and
becoming more fully human, as with others, we spend our brief span
in this world.

We are currently working at developing courses at various levels
including an MA. We are interested to find ‘partner’ centres who
would like to work with us at developing the model further — or at
applying the model in schools or in teacher education. If you are

Colloquium October 2004 at the Louhelen Bahá’í school and the forum
held at the Bosch Bahá’í school by the CGIE — the Centre for Global
Integrated Education, October 2004. In this version however I have tried
to include some elements of a Bahá’í theological basis for educational
philosophy.

\[4\] Of course I don’t mean the Bahá’í Revelation or its proper
institutions. Here I have in mind corrupt organizations in which people
mis-represent knowledge in order to maintain power or achieve
improper ends.

\[5\] The reader of course must decide whether ‘discuss’ means the openness
of dialogue or the closedness of cloze procedures.

\[6\] ‘Mistakes’ are vital to learning — as someone said the fastest way to pro-
gress is ‘ready, fire, aim’. (My apology for the nature of the metaphor)

\[7\] We mustn’t because of contemporary chaos think that the postmodern
is all bad. An excellent sorting out of the benefits as well as the
demerits of postmodernism is to be found in Wilber (1998 ch. 9)

\[11\] The ‘Sun’ for Bahá’ís obviously is the Bahá’í Revelation. However the
model is designed to enable us to work spiritually with others without
distorting relationships through feeling the need to convert; that is it is
designed to respect other forms of worldview within the ‘Sun’.

\[12\] ‘Texts’ includes experience of dance, video, theatre etc. — and
especially the text of self.

\[13\] The current interest in ‘restorative justice’ for victims, and between
them and perpetrators of crime, is essentially a process of re-
humanization of the perpetrators. Of course it is also for some of the
victims a releasing from the negatives that can destroy.

\[14\] I have in mind the passage:

> There are certain pillars which have been established as the
> unshakable supports of the Faith of God. The mightiest of these is
> learning and the use of the mind, the expansion of consciousness,
> and insight into the realities of the universe and the hidden mys-
> teries of Almighty God. To promote knowledge is thus an inescapa-
ble duty imposed on every one of the friends of God. (SWAB 126-7)

\[15\] I continually repeat this point because many people seem to find it
difficult to understand the difference between cognition and being in
the creative mode (essentially the same as the mystical) or the caring
mode. My impression is that something of the order of 90% of male
academics, for example, just don’t ‘get it’ — they literately cannot get
out of their heads. Some women academics and politicians seem to have
essentially adopted a male-like persona in order to succeed. (Possibly
their only option.)

\[16\] I have chosen to capitalize Spiritual to indicate divine influence. I
have in mind those passages where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá speaks of the ‘breaths
and promptings’ of the Holy Spirit — e.g. PUP 7, 23, 41, 142; PT 179. In
Paris Talks the notion of higher self is not capitalized — however in a
sense the higher self it is that receives the ‘breaths’ and ‘promptings’.

\[21\] These come from the much loved professor of Religious Education John
Hull; many papers are online at http://johnmhull.biz (29 Jan 2005)

\[22\] This is a major theme in one of Wilber’s early books No Boundary (1985)

\[23\] The teacher, the school, the community needs to decide on those
virtues that are to form the ‘human context’ for a school’s teaching — I
have argued for truth, beauty, goodness and justice to be cardinal but
compassion and empathy as well imagination and other key qualities
must be developed. The authority of the school needs to be derived from
periodic consultations between representatives of all stakeholders.
