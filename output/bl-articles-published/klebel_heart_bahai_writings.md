He further instructs us to think, meditate or ponder in our heart, saying “Ponder this in thine heart” (ESW 74). A most intriguing word of Bahá’u’lláh is the following statement:
> 
> > _Say: Spirit, mind, soul, and the powers of sight and hearing are but one single reality which hath manifold expressions owing to the diversity of its instruments._ (SLH 154)
> 
> Bahá’u’lláh in this statement explains that the spiritual powers animating the human body are one single reality that is known through its expression in the diversity of its instruments. The brain, the senses and the organic heart are the instruments in their physical diversity that allow the spirit, mind or soul (i.e., the one, single, and central spiritual reality of the human person) to express itself in the physical world. According to modern neurocardiology there are newly discovered aspects of the physical heart that make the metaphorical use of this concept much more appropriate, it can be compared with the concept of brain versus mind. A very important question is the understanding of the physiology of the heart and of its nervous system, “the little brain of the heart.”

These findings of Quantum Mechanics will round up the picture and help us to understand aspects of the heart that have been ambiguous, when seen in the light of a materialistic and mechanistic medical science.

It is obvious that the use of heart in a metaphorical sense can be much better explained after these functions of the physical heart are known, creating a new basis for our understanding.

                In the Heart of All That Is
The “Heart” in Bahá’í Writings and Science

Wolfgang A. Klebel

Introduction

The title of this paper is taken from a prayer of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, which emphasizes the role of the heart as the center of the
universe when He talks about the hidden truths that are written
and embedded in the heart of all that is. 1 (CC I 251)2 This
statement about the heart of all that is, is an echo to the Words
of Bahá’u’lláh about the heart of the world:

> The Word of God hath set the heart of the world afire;
> how regrettable if ye fail to be enkindled with its flame!

(GWB 316)
It needs to be asked what role the heart plays, not only in the
individual human, but also in humanity as a whole and in the
world as a whole.

The topic of this paper is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s answer to a
question of a physician regarding the sympathetic nervous
system (which today is generally called the Autonomic Nervous
System, hereafter referred to as ANS) of the human organism.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes:

> The powers of the sympathetic nerve are neither entirely
> physical nor spiritual, but are between the two
> (systems). The nerve is connected with both. Its
> phenomena shall be perfect when its spiritual and
> physical relations are normal.
> When the material world and the divine world are well
> co-related, when the hearts become heavenly and the
> aspirations grow pure and divine, perfect connection
> shall take place. Then shall this power produce a perfect
> manifestation. Physical and spiritual diseases will then
> receive absolute healing.
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                        108

> The exposition is brief. Ponder and thou shalt
> understand the meaning. Although, on account of lack
> of time, the answer is short, by close reflection it shall
> be made long. (TAB 308)3
The present paper attempts to “ponder” the question of the
sympathetic nervous system as well as the subject matter of the
heart. The heart’s nervous system will be presented, as it has
been developed in the new science of neurocardiology.

In the above referenced text ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that the
“physical” and the “spiritual” are “connected by the
sympathetic nervous system” and that this “co-relation”
affects the heart, which becomes “heavenly” and its “aspiration
grows pure and divine.” This “perfect connection” of the
spiritual and the physical in the heart “produces a perfect
manifestation” and will lead to “absolute healing.” ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá promises that this short description will “be made long”
by “close reflection.”

In this paper the understanding of the hart as a metaphor is
look at and the difference and correspondence between the
heart as a biological feature in the material sense and heart as a
symbolic feature as is used in poesy, folklore and even theology
will be explored. Furthermore, the close reflection will be based
on another source of knowledge, which is the new findings of
Quantum Mechanics and the philosophical and spiritual
conclusions which have been drawn from this new branch of
physics. The meaning attributed to the heart in the Bahá’í
Writings will be explored to assure that the interpretation of
this text is following the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

In the following paper “In the Pure Soil of Thy Heart,”
another, equally important question is discussed; the
understanding of the physiology of the heart and of its nervous
system, “the little brain of the heart.” Can the recent
discoveries of neurocardiology help us to understand what the
Bahá’í Writings say about the heart? What are the physical
functions of the heart, which could be the corresponding
natural elements for the spiritual aspect of the heart? It is the
knowledge of God that is animating the human heart as
Bahá’u’lláh said: The spirit that animateth the human heart is
the knowledge of God. (GWB 290)

The findings of these papers will be tentative for not all
aspects of this issue can be properly explored at this time. It is
hoped that further studies of the function of the heart will shed

“Heart” in Bahá’í Writings and Science                          109

new light on this issue and will deepen the understanding, not
only of the human heart, but also of what the Bahá’í Writings
call “the heart of all that is,” and the “heart of the world,” which
is the heart of the universe, also described as “the city of the
heart.” This heart is the goal of human development and
provides the mystical entry in to the attainment of the
Manifestations of God. In the Bible this is the “Word” that
was “in the beginning” with God 4. It is furthermore the cosmic
Christ or the point Omega 5, towards which the whole evolution
of humanity moves. The Manifestations, Who are described as
the “Alpha and Omega” in the Bible are called the “The First”
and “The Last”, the “True One” and the “Beloved One” of the
worlds in Bahá’í Scripture.

Anticipating later explanations, it could be stated here that
the heart functions as the physical center of unity of the
spiritual and physical aspect of humans and humanity, i.e., the
physical and spiritual center of the individual human being, as
well as the center of humanity and the world as a whole. An
excursion into some philosophical conclusion drawn from
findings of quantum mechanics will round the picture and add
heuristic features to this elaboration, which hopefully will
entice future studies in this area in the field of theology,
philosophy and biophysical sciences.

When God’s “beloved ones” acquire the “knowledge and the
sciences and the arts”, for which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá encourages us to
pray,6 God will “make them to hear the hidden truths that are
written and embedded in the heart of all that is.” This will
introduce them into the “city of the heart,” or as Bahá’u’lláh
writes at the closure of the Seven Valleys: “this station is the
first gate of the heart’s citadel, that is, man’s first entrance to
the city of the heart.” (SVFV 41)

The Heart in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh

To study the concept “heart” in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
is not an easy task. It is made difficult mostly because it is not
easy to describe what heart means in the languages of different
cultures and how this concept is used in the Writings.

The Bahá’í Writings are understood in this paper according
to the Báb’s explanation about the “Four Modes of
Revelation.” These modes are described at length in a book
written by Nader Saiedi, 7 and will be here summarized:

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                   110

1\. VERSES (áyát): “The mode of divine verses is the direct

> revelation of God, uttered in the voice of God as the
> speaker addressing His creation (an affirmation of ‘I am
> God’). This mode employs the language of divinity,
> ascendance and lordship …” (Saiedi p. 42)
2\. PRAYERS AND SUPPLICATIONS (munáját, ad’íyih);

> “The mode of prayers and supplications is the reverse of
> the mode of divine verses. Here the language of revelation
> is uttered in the voice of the Prophet, but now speaking
> in the station of the creation, addressing the Creator
> with an attitude of servitude and effacement (an
> affirmation of ‘Thou art God’). This mode emphasizes
> the poverty and powerlessness of the creatures before
> their Creator… The discourse of prayer is fundamentally
> an expression of servitude and love — the love of the
> created being for God…” (Saiedi p. 42)
3\. COMMENTARIES AND SERMONS (tafásír, khutáb);

> “Commentaries and sermons are uttered in the voice of
> the Revelator speaking to human beings about God and
> His words (an affirmation of ‘He is God’). The
> commentaries are interpretative works that aim to
> explain, in expository form, the true meanings of the
> divine verses… The sermons praise and describe
> transcendental spiritual realities that are the cosmic
> manifestations of the Word. Often the Báb begins a
> work with a brief or lengthy sermon that endeavors to
> connect the reader’s heart and consciousness to the
> divine verities….” (Saiedi, p.43)
4\. RATIONAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND PHILOSOPHICAL

> DISCOURSE         (shu’ún-i-’ilníyyig  va      hikamíyyih)
> “…rational, educational, and philosophical discourse — is
> again spoken in the voice of the Redeemer addressing
> human beings, but this time using rational arguments to
> demonstrate the truth of the Word of God and explain
> the message expressed in the prayers (an affirmation of
> ‘He is God Who is’). The fundamental function of this
> mode is to analyze the phenomenal world and to link it to
> the transcendental realm… The purpose of this mode is to
> show the signs of the unseen within the visible realm, and
> to prove the world of divinity and dominion through its
> manifestations in the earthly world… This mode
> frequently employs logical argumentation and analysis…”
> (Saiedi p.43-44)
“Heart” in Bahá’í Writings and Science                          111

It obvious that the majority of the quotes from the Bahá’í
Writings used in this paper are related to the fourth mode, the
rational, educational and philosophical discourse, especially as
this discourse relates to the heart. Certain passages from the
Verses and from Prayers and Supplications will be used also,
especially if they shed light on the issues at hand.

There is one contention — that the concept of Heart is an
analogy, taken from the fact that somehow the heart, described
here as a muscle, seems to be central to the human body, so
everything that is central to a human person is called heart.8

> As the muscle which is the original source of these
> metaphorical applications brings life to the whole
> body, so heart refers to the core-force of personality at
> the center of its life. Because we do not want to limit
> the self with the name of intellect alone, or will alone,
> or feeling alone, nor to see these as separate, we have
> invented the sensibly opaque name of heart for the
> identifying core of our agency.
In this monograph the centrality of the heart is used as a
metaphor, a figure of speech related to the area of the physical
body as explained in medical science, which concept then is
extended, or transferred into other areas of understanding. All
of this is done with the assumed understanding that the heart is
nothing else than a muscle, a medical machine, pumping blood
throughout the body and that this function of the heart is
regulated by the external nervous system, the autonomous and
the central nervous system.

With this metaphorical understanding the attempt is made
to explain all that is said in poetry, tradition and folklore
about the heart. The religious statements about the heart are
placed into a similar category. When we read the many
statements of the Bible and in the Bahá’í Scripture, which
include the heart, we can do the same, and read them as simple
metaphors. This approach allows us to disregard the physical
heart and its meaning, and develop an idea about the heart as a
metaphorical and spiritual concept, which is not really related
very much to anything in the body.

While this is possible, it appears not to be congruous with
what Bahá’u’lláh means when He speaks in many ways about the
heart, when He speaks about the City or Citadel of the heart
and gives the heart functions that certainly not only surpass
widely any possible relation to the medical blood pump, but

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                             112

also goes far and beyond anything that is said in the tradition
about the heart as a metaphorical concept.

Bahá’u’lláh for example speaks of the “eye of thine heart ” (KI
90),or He mentions a person who has “unstopped the ear of his
inmost heart” (SLH 86), implying that the heart has an ability
that can somehow be compared to the senses of hearing and
seeing. He states that hearts can be affected by touch telling us
that “hearts have been sorely shaken” (PM 12). Bahá’u’lláh speaks
of a “wise and understanding heart” (ESW 65). Bahá’u’lláh places
the function of memory into the heart as well, when He lets us
pray: “to make my heart to be a receptacle of Thy love and of
remembrance” (PM 56). He further instructs us to think,
meditate or ponder in our heart, saying “Ponder this in thine
heart” (ESW 74).

The importance of the “Heart” in the Báb’s Writings cannot
be overlooked either, as He stated:

> Verily, all the letters of this súrih are but one single
> letter. All variations in the words and meanings therein
> revert to a single point. That point is, verily, the
> station of the heart and the sanctuary of unity. 9
To quote Saiedi:

> To interpret something is to uncover its true meaning.
> The text that is to be interpreted consists of signs,
> specifically words, appearing as combinations of
> letters of the alphabet. The supreme task of
> interpretation, the Báb explains in this passage, is to
> elevate these alphabetical signs (which constitute the
> text) to the highest level of their own reality, the station
> at which they reveal their true essential nature, or
> “heart.” The concept of “heart” ({fu’ad}) is one of the
> most important principles in the writings of the Báb.
> The station of the heart is the highest stage of a created
> being’s existential reality. It is the reflection of divine
> revelation itself within the inmost reality of things.
> (Saiedi, p. 50)
> The task of true hermeneutics is to cause a
> fundamental transformation in the phenomenal realm:
> to elevate the phenomena to the station of the heart is
> to uncover the signs of divine revelation that are
> enshrined within the reality of those phenomena, and
> to connect that which is motionless to its true inner
“Heart” in Bahá’í Writings and Science                            113

> reality  of    vibrant     spiritual      motion.      This
> transformation     is    accomplished         within    the
> consciousness of the interpreter. (Saiedi, p. 51)
For the Báb the heart is the central place where the belief in
God is centered and the heart encompassed the “expanse of
heaven and earth.” When God cheers the heart of the believer
this cheerfulness will overflow into the spirit, the soul and the
body of the faithful.

> Indeed the hearts of them that truly believe in Him
> Whom God shall make manifest are vaster than the
> expanse of heaven and earth and whatever is between
> them. God hath left no hindrance in their hearts, were
> it but the size of a mustard seed. He will cheer their
> hearts, their spirits, their souls and their bodies and
> their days of prosperity or adversity, through the
> exaltation of the name of Him Who is the supreme
> Testimony of God and the promotion of the Word of
> Him Who is the Dayspring of the glory of their
> Creator. (SWB 145)
In contrast to these rather specific references to the heart,
the Bible and the Qur’an talk frequently about the heart, but
mainly in the sense of the seat of feelings, or as the place of
contact with God, like in Galatians 4:6 “And because ye are
sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,
crying, Abba, Father.”

Similar to that Pauline statement, Bahá’u’lláh attributes to
the heart an exceedingly important capacity; it is the Seat of
God’s Revelation in man as He said in many places:

> He hath chosen out of the whole world the hearts of His
> servants, and made them each a seat for the revelation
> of His glory. (GWB 296)
> The one true God, exalted be His glory, hath ever
> regarded, and will continue to regard, the hearts of
> men as His own, His exclusive possession. (GWB 206)
> 27. O SON OF DUST!
> All that is in heaven and earth I have ordained for thee,
> except the human heart, which I have made the
> habitation of My beauty and glory. (PHW 27)
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                      114

The human heart is therefore the special and exceptional
place for the Revelation of God, it is the exclusive possession
of the one true God and it is the habitation of God’s beauty
and glory. One can only wonder what it is about the human
heart that it can function in these exalted ways and become
such an exceptional and unique place for the Revelation of the
Glory of God and the Mystery of God’s approach to man. We
will in the course of this paper find some answers to this
question, which answers need to be developed to a deeper and
improved understanding in the future.

Again, all of this can be understood simply as a metaphor,
but it raises the question if there is more to say about the heart
then it being a medical and mechanical blood pump. The
metaphorical understanding has consequences, especially if the
figure of speech is not related to any real property of the heart,
but only to a tradition and an unscientific concept, from a
time when the body was just not understood in its medical
functioning. Or we could say the human body at previous
times was not seen as a biological machine, which is its only
function, according to the prevalent medical understanding.

This is a question which needs to be raised for any metaphor.

Is there something that allows us to make this comparison and
create a metaphor; is there an intrinsic reason for this figure of
speech or is it purely a convention? Or is it just an accepted
allegory, which has no reality except in the mind and culture of
people using it? We must ask if the material world from which
the metaphor is taken has any real connection to the spiritual
world, which is described in these metaphors. The answer given
in this paper is positive; there is an internal connection
between spirit and matter, between soul and body, between
mind and brain and between the heart as a physical organ and
the heart as the seat of God’s Revelation.

There is one issue that makes us wonder if that is all that can
be said about the heart and how this word is used in different
cultures, in poetry in folklore and even in common
understanding. Since almost all languages use this figure of
speech in a similar way, we have to assume that there is in most
cultures a general human tradition that points to the heart in
explaining all these properties of man. From there the question
arises, is there more to it, than an external and cultural
tradition? In other words, is there a reality underneath and
embedded in the human organism that makes us think so?
Medical science and biology certainly have not given an answer

“Heart” in Bahá’í Writings and Science                        115

to this question so far. It describes the heart simply as “a
muscular organ responsible for pumping blood through the
blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions.”10

Another question needs to be considered here, and it is
probably an even more difficult question, because there is not
much in that tradition about the heart, which will help us in
this case. I will make a comparison that could help. We have the
same problem with the heart as we have with the brain. We used
many different words which are related to the brain. For
example we use mind, reason, intellect, we use consciousness,
understanding, knowledge and even words like thinking,
judging, willing and many other things that supposedly happen
in the brain. And there are even people, especially scientists,
who would say that all of those words and concepts mean
nothing else than the electromagnetic and chemical processes
that happen in the brain, or, more specifically in the synapses
of the brain.

Nevertheless, the assumption is generally made that there is a
difference between the brain and the mind. Then one might
identify the physiology of the brain and claim that the mind is
using the brain in order to function. If we assume that this
distinction is correct then we have to follow with the
assumption that what is happening in the mind has a reflection
in the brain. In other words, when the mind is functioning
something does happen in the brain, but what’s happening in
the brain does not fully explain what’s happening in the mind.

It seems one can say that the brain is used by the mind as an
instrument, which allows it to become materialized and be
expressed in physical words or actions. That naturally assumes
that the spiritual reality of the mind and the material realities
of the physical world are connected somehow in the brain. And
that is very similar to what Bahá’u’lláh has said, not only about
the mind, but also about the spirit, the soul, and the powers of
the senses:

> Say: Spirit, mind, soul, and the powers of sight and
> hearing are but one single reality which hath manifold
> expressions owing to the diversity of its instruments.
> As thou dost observe, man’s power to comprehend,
> move, speak, hear, and see all derive from this sign of
> his Lord within him. It is single in its essence, yet
> manifold through the diversity of its instruments.

This, verily, is a certain truth. (SLH 154)

Following this word we can say that spirit, mind, soul, and
even the power of the senses must be differentiated from the
physical and organic instruments they use. This is an
interesting and rather new idea and it brings us right into the
area of science, especially physical science, where many
instruments are used to improve the understanding of reality.
For example, physics uses the Geiger counter as an instrument
to learn about subatomic particles and making conclusions
about the reality of physical nature that were unexpected and
revolutionary and even developing a new science called
quantum mechanics.

In a letter to a person deprived of physical sight ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá has applied the meaning of the statement of Bahá’u’lláh
that the sense organs are only the instruments of the spirit:

> O thou possessor of a seeing heart! Although,
> materially speaking, thou art deprived of physical
> sight, yet, praise be to God, spiritual insight is thine.
> Thy heart seeth and thy spirit heareth. Bodily sight is
> subject to a thousand maladies and assuredly will
> ultimately be lost. Thus no importance should be
> attached to it. But the sight of the heart is illumined. It
> discerneth and discovereth the divine Kingdom. It is
> everlasting and eternal. Praise God, therefore, that the
> sight of thy heart is illumined, and the hearing of thy
> mind responsive. (SWA 37)
The blind man’s heart sees, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, and his
spirit hears, it sees and hears, it discovers and discerns the
divine Kingdom. Here the instrument of the spirit, the sight, is
lost, nevertheless the person’s mind, the man’s spirit can see
and hear what is most important, because the sight of the heart
is illumined. The thought that the human spirit can be in
contact with the divine Kingdom, even if the senses are lost, is
certainly a comforting thought, when considering the fate of
children, dying early in life and the fate of all human beings
with limited perceptual and even intellectual capacity.

When considering the concept “heart” in all its different
uses, especially in its metaphorical uses, we have to be aware of
another fallacy of understanding. Ken Wilber11 has described
this Pre/trans fallacy applying it to the development of reason,
by saying: “since both, pre-rational states and trans-rational
states are, in their own ways, non-rational, they appear similar
or even identical to the untutored eye. And once ‘pre’ and

‘trans’ are confused, then one of two fallacies occurs.” Before
describing these fallacies, it needs to be noted that this is a
general principle of understanding evolution and it applies,
even if the specific development of the mind, as Wilber
describes it, is modified.

We all can agree with him about pre-rational states of
evolution, such as the magic and mythic stages in the
development of the thinking process of mankind. At the
present time, we can be described as mainly living in the
rational state, when reason and logic is prevalent in the
thinking world. Wilber calls these stages the formal operational
stage in the development of reason. He projects future stages
such as vision logic as the first of several trans-rational stages.
In the Viennese tradition12 of Integral Logic, what Wilber calls
vision logic could as well, and possibly better be described as
integral logic.

This way of thinking will be described below; here the two
possible consequences of the pre/trans fallacy will be described.
One or the other of them follows consistently when the
differentiation between pre-rational and trans-rational is not
seen.
1\. “Higher trans-rational states are reduced to lower pre-

> rational states. Genuine mystical or contemplative
> experiences, for example, a-dualism are seen as a
> regression or throwback to infantile states of narcissism,
> oceanic, in-dissociation and even primitive autism. This
> is, for example, precisely the route taken by Freud in The
> Future of an Illusion.”
2\. “On the other hand, if one is sympathetic with higher or

> mystical states, but one still confuses pre and trans, then

It is important to apply this distinction to all writings,
especially the Writings of the Bahá’í Faith. The expressions
about the heart are not to be fallaciously mistaken for mystic
or magic understanding; they are beyond these more primitive
understanding and are only explicable after the modern
distinction and separation of the human abilities have been

taken into account. Then, and only then, will the new insight
presented by Bahá’u’lláh really be understood and its far-
reaching meaning be appreciated.

Many people have mentioned that when they first became a
Bahá’í they understood the Writings in a poetic sense and
admired them on a symbolic level. Later, after thorough reading
and meditating on what they had read, they found deeper
meaning and developed a better sense of what the Writings
convey.

It is this writer’s opinion that we have to develop this
integral thinking in order to understand the Bahá’í Writings.
For example, Shoghi Effendi calls the Watchword of the Faith,
“Unity in Diversity.” This principle is a good an example of an
integral concept that should never be confused with a primitive
pre-logical way of fuzzy thinking, nor should it be assumed
that prior mythical or magic thinking could have had a similar
differentiated understanding of reality. On the other hand, the
magic understanding can function as an introduction and
preparation towards the higher and more differentiated
understanding we have now.

This is, one needs to say, a totally new way of thinking
about reality. Leo Gabriel has expressed this concept of the
Integral Whole (Integrale Ganzheit), when he wrote (translated
by this writer):

> Talking about the Whole (Ganzheit) and Gestalt, as I
> emphasized before, is a methodological concept, a new
> way of thinking, a new way of perceiving reality, which
> breaks with a long tradition. It is therefore, an
> essential change in thinking and a true revolution,
> which started with this century and which anticipates a
> new epoch of the spirit. It is a “metanoia,” a change
> for a new world vision and a new way of thinking. 14
It is noteworthy to remember in this context of the
“Integrale Ganzheit” the statement of the Báb about the
difference between reason and the heart. Only the heart can
understand the Divine Unity and Transcendence, a view that
was not available to Leo Gabriel, who spoke about the new
epoch of the spirit and a new way of thinking, about 100 years
after the death of the Báb. The role of the heart in
understanding Unity and Transcendence of God was described
by Nader Saiedi in his book “Gate of the Heart” when he
translates the Báb’s statements (pp. 211-212):

> For, verily, reason, even in its utmost level of
> abstraction, is confined to understanding mere limited
> phenomena, which fail to guide humans unto the
> summit of the delight of their heart.
> That which is beyond these two extremes, which is the
> Middle Path … can be comprehended by naught save the
> heart. God hath created the heart to understand His
> unity and transcendence and it is through the heart
> that Divine Unity can be witnessed at the level of
> action.
It appears to this writer that this new way of thinking,
which the thinking world is slowly recognizing, was expressed
in the Bahá’í Writings a century ago and is only now being
identified by philosophy and psychology. To follow this
process is the topic of these considerations. In order to
summarize what has been said before, it must be stated that the
Bahá’í Writings seem to provide the following understanding
of the function of the heart.

The human spirit is a single reality that expresses itself in the
different perceptual and executive organs of the human body,
such as eye, ear, touch, smell, and movement, speech and touch.
Furthermore, the same applies to the heart; it is as a human
organ the instrument of the spirit, and it has the functions of
the senses as well as of the brain. In other words, while life of
the mind expresses itself through brain and the senses, the heart
has the same function, except that we do not usually consider
this fact and use these function in a metaphorical sense only.
Yet, according to the Báb, mind or reason is confined to mere
limited phenomena, while the heart is created by God to
understand unity and transcendence which explains the new
understanding of reality as Leo Gabriel has pointed out above.

There are some statements of Bahá’u’lláh that can be
interpreted by assuming that there are two realities to the
human existence, the outward and the inmost aspect. When
Bahá’u’lláh talks about the heart of my heart, the spirit of my
spirit and even the tongue of my tongue, should we not assume
that He talks about different and yet connected realities, as
above about the unity of the spiritual aspect of man and the
variety of the instruments that express the human spirit in the
physical reality? The statement below certainly has many
meanings, but this interpretation might be one of them.

> O Lord! The tongue of my tongue and the heart of my
> heart and the spirit of my spirit and my outward and
> inmost beings bear witness to Thy unity and Thy
> oneness, Thy power and Thine omnipotence, Thy
> grandeur and Thy sovereignty, and attest Thy glory,
> loftiness and authority. I testify that Thou art God
> and that there is none other God besides Thee. (TB 114)
The Physical Heart as a Metaphor for the “Spiritual Heart”

Later, when considering the new science of neurocardiology
we will bring more light into this relationship. Additionally, we
will apply Quantum Mechanics to this relationship between the
spiritual and unified aspect of man and its instrumental and
physical aspect.

Following this idea throughout this paper, it will carry us
into different areas of understanding, such as the unity of the
world, the relation between matter and spirit, and into some of
the conclusions of quantum mechanics and neurocardiology.

A caveat has to be expressed here. All the findings of this
paper are speculative and provisional, in other words, they are
not expressed here with the certainty of science but, while
based on scientific findings, they are extrapolations of these

findings. Since they are perceived as being in harmony with
statements of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, it is assumed that
they carry a certain validity, which needs to be further
developed. Religious truth is relative as the Guardian of the
Bahá’í Faith claimed, meaning that it is progressively coming
into the light of investigation, which process has been
previously described by this writer as progressive theology.

The Unity of matter and spirit in philosophical and
quantum mechanical considerations

The question of unity of spirit and matter can be solved in
different ways. The simplest solution is to deny that there is a
question and to eliminate one or the other side of it. While
today the elimination of matter as a reality is rather difficult
to claim, to eliminate spirit is easy and has been done in the
name of science quite generously.

In last year’s paper15 the connection of consciousness with
physical action as developed by Walker16 was described at
length. Here only a brief recapitulation will be given.

The astounding fact in this comparison is the new science of
quantum mechanics, which according to Walker gives an
explanation of the possibility of the spiritual affecting the
material in quantum events in the synapses of the nervous
system in the brain. These quantum effects, which are not
deterministically defined by cause and effect, can be influenced
by the observer, i.e., by the consciousness of the human mind.

Therefore, according to Walker, the spiritual mind can
influence matter at the level of the undetermined quantum
processes in the brain’s synapses that are small enough to allow
quantum effects to happen. Walker describes this process in
detail with the physics of quantum mechanics. In the context
of this description he explains a number of functions of the
mind, like sleep, ability to influence matter in rare cases, and
why the power of the mind is usually restricted, as common
sense experience tells us.

Another not yet considered question is the effect of the little
brain of the heart (as described below), which does not have
consciousness. Walker does not consider this, but it needs to
be included in this equation, a rather new and difficult task.
The difficulty is based on the fact that we do not know enough
about this “little brain of the heart,” to make cogent

conclusions. In the following we will make some conclusions
from known        facts Quantum Mechanics and            of
Neurocardiology.

The concepts of Emergence, Enchantment, Entanglement,
and Excellence of the Cosmos are used in explaining and
interpreting the conclusions from quantum mechanics for the
heart. What was said in the previous paper will here be applied
to the heart.
Emergence

The Nobel Prize laureate in physics, Robert B. Laughlin,
developed the concept of emergence in his book: A different
Universe, Reinventing physics from the bottom down. 17 In
other words, reality is defined by a view that takes the whole
into consideration, and this whole is a whole that integrates its
parts; it is an integrated whole. If this concept is applied to the
human heart, we can see that the heart is the unifying principle
of the body as well as the spiritual principle that unifies reality
and makes unity understood, while reason is concerned about
particulars and parts. This was stated by the Báb in the
following words:

> For, verily, reason, even in its utmost level of
> abstraction, is confined to understanding mere limited
> phenomena, which fail go guide humans unto the
> summit of the delight of their heart. 18
> That which is beyond these two extremes, which is the
> Middle Path … can be comprehended by naught save the
> heart. God has created the heart to understand His
> unity and transcendence, and it is through the heart
> that Divine Unity can be witnessed at the level of
> action. 19
Modern neurocardiology does recognize the intellectual
capacity of the “little brain of the heart” as will be shown
below, but the contribution of the heart to human
understanding and consciousness needs to be explored in the
future and is a matter of psychology, rather than
neurocardiology alone. According to the Bahá’í Scriptures, we
can say that God has created the heart to understand His unity
and transcendence and it is through the heart that Divine Unity
can be witnessed at the level of action, i.e., in reality.

Enchantment through Spirituality

Ervin Laszlo in his book Science and the Reenchantment of
the Cosmos, the Rise of the Integral Vision of Reality 20
describes the changes quantum mechanics has made to the
understanding of the cosmos:

> The current finding of the universe’s wholeness is the
> fruit of sustained investigation, based on observation
> and tested by experiment. It provides an entirely
> different image of the world than the mechanistic,
> materialistic and fragmented image we were taught in
> school. A cosmos that is connected, coherent, and
> whole recalls an ancient notion that was present in the
> tradition of every civilization; it is an enchanted
> cosmos. (p. 2)
This view of the cosmos brings spirituality and enchantment
into the understanding of reality and it can be directly applied
in the description of the Báb as the summit of the delight of
their heart.

> Verily, these are souls who take delight in the
> remembrance of God, Who dilates their hearts through
> the effulgence of the light of knowledge and wisdom.

(SWB 145)
Or as Bahá’u’lláh has described this enchantment in a Hidden
Word:

O FRIEND!

> In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of
> love, and from the nightingale of affection and desire
> loosen not thy hold. Treasure the companionship of the
> righteous and eschew all fellowship with the ungodly.

(PHW 3)

Entanglement in Unity

Erwin Schrödinger, born near Vienna, Austria, (1887-1961)
formulated the importance of this concept:

> I consider [Entanglement or “Verschränkung”] not as
> one, but as the characteristic trait of Quantum
> Mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure
> from classical lines of thought. 21

In other words all parts of the universe are entangled,
interwoven or intertwined with each other; the universe is a
whole and is organized as mentioned above in emerging units
on all levels of existence.

Consider this: In an experiment contrasting stimuli were
randomly presented on a computer screen to the observer, one
was presented to elicit feelings of love and acceptance, the
other fear and anxiety. The hearts of the candidates responded
accordingly as measured by the heart rate variability. The
surprising fact was that they responded about 7 seconds before
the computer started the random selection process.

In other words, even before the computer started to select
the respective picture, the heart already responded to what the
senses would perceive only seconds later. This reversal of cause
and effect cannot be explained in classical physics. Another
fact of entanglement is the widely observed fact that people are
aware of events that happen in distant areas, sometimes so far
away that any physical connection must be excluded.

Consequently, it has been established scientifically that the
heart is the first to perceive input from the perception through
the senses. As a matter of fact, it could be proven
experimentally that changes in sensual input are detected by the
heart seconds before the random computer program is started
that will select the presentation to the senses.

> Of greatest significance here is our major finding,
> namely, the electrophysiological evidence that the heart
> is directly involved in the processing of information
> about a future emotional stimulus seconds before the
> body actually experiences the stimulus.” … “The heart
> appears to play a direct role in the perception of future
> events.22
Only quantum mechanics can explain the findings of
neurocardiology that the heart has intuition, i.e. that it can
perceive physical events before they are presented to the senses,
and the other widely known fact that the heart can know of
events that happen far away.23

In the Seven Valleys Bahá’u’lláh describes this shining quality
of the heart manifesting the oneness of the world.

> Whensoever the light of Manifestation of the King of
> Oneness settleth upon the throne of the heart and soul,
> His shining becometh visible in every limb and member.

(SVFV 22)

Excellence of the Cosmos

Evan Harris Walker in his book “The Physics of
Consciousness, The Quantum Mind and the Meaning of
Life”24 describes consciousness and its interaction with the
brain:

> Consciousness is the collection of potentialities that
> developed as these electrons and these structures of the
> brain interact (as quantum elements). (Walker 237)
> By creating the possibilities that we experience as
> consciousness and by selecting — by willing — which
> synapse will fire, mind brings into reality each
> moment’s thoughts, experiences and actions (Walker 237)

Walker at a conference at Berkeley “New visions of reality” said
“What we have been doing here is laying the foundations for a
religion of the twenty-first century.” (Walker 328) He concludes
his book:

> Some have failed to see any place — any space — where
> God could reside, and others have failed to see where
> any consciousness could hide within the atoms of
> matter. But we have found that reality. We have found
> that hidden place. We have seen that the universe
> springs from every thought of God and matter from
> the very existence of mind. (Walker 337)
What needs to be emphasized is the fact that Walker does
not talk about the nervous system of the heart, yet his thinking
about the central nervous system must be applied, mutatis
mutandum, to the heart as well. The most important change
from the central nervous system to the so called “little brain of
the heart” is the fact that the latter does not have
consciousness, a fact we all know. Decisions of the heart
become conscious only in the mind, and cannot be directly
understood in our consciousness; therefore they often remain
unchecked and not clarified by reason. Nevertheless, they are
frequently followed and executed by the conscious mind in the
life of people, sometimes with questionable results. This issue
will be further pursued below.

The heart as the seat of the Revelation of God has been
described above and needs to be incorporated here,
consequently the place “where God resides” as Walker describes
it, is not consciousness, but the heart, where consciousness is
absent. The physical heart and its “little brain” is the center,
where the spiritual and the material meets and it is in contact
and constant communication with the brain and the mind,
where consciousness is present. All of this is understandable
only when we take the statement of Bahá’u’lláh serious — that
the spiritual in man is one single reality, yet it is differentiated
by its bodily instruments.

> Spirit, mind, soul, and the powers of sight and hearing
> are but one single reality which hath manifold
> expressions owing to the diversity of its instruments.
