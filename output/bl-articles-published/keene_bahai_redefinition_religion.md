                     BAHA'I WORLD FAITH:
REDEFINITION OF RELIGION

> JAMES J. KEENE
> University of Chicago*

Memnbers of the Baha'i World Faith consistently differed from Jews,
Catholics, Protestants,   and non-affiliates  in the structure of reli-
> gious behavior and its relation to personality.      By factor analysis of
> 35 religious behaviors of 112 Baha'is, five facets or components of their
> total religious life were found: Cognitive, Experiential,    Self-defming,
> Administrative,   and Meditative. Evidence suggesting possible psycho-
> social functions of these components was considered.       Strength on all
> five components at once-total,    balanced religious activity-was     found
> only in the Baha'i group. This unique Baha'i pattern in the religious
> realm was correlated with a personal orientation composed of World-
> winded, Spontaneous, and Adaptive behaviors, which was found only
> in the Baha'i group. A deviation from total religious participation
> is associated with disruption of the unique personality pattern, and vice
> versa. These findings are also discussed        in terms of a concept of
> community.
