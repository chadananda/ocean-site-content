Bahá’í Youth and Sexuality A Personal/Professional View

Sharon Hatcher Kennedy and Andrew Kennedy
Abstract
This paper examines the role of Bahá’í youth with respect to prevailing attitudes towards sexuality found in
Western society. Drawing on the results of a survey of 3,600 Canadian teenagers, the paper delineates some
current attitudes in the general population. The role of youth and the process of spiritual growth, as described in
the Bahá’í writings, are explored with particular attention to the concept of sexuality and the principle of
chastity. A number of practical suggestions are made for both individuals and institutions who must deal with
matters of sexuality.

Résumé
Ce travail examine le rôle de la jeunesse bahá’íe face aux attitudes courantes vis-à-vis la sexualité dans la
societé occidentale. En se basant sur les résultats d’une étude de 3,600 adolescents canadiens, les attitudes
courantes de la population en général sont presentées. Le rôle des jeunes et le processus de croissance
spirituelle, tels que décrits dans les Ecrits bahá’ís, sont approfondis avec une attention particulière au concept de
sexualité et au principe de chasteté. Plusieurs suggestions pratiques sont développées pour aider les individus et
les institutions qui doivent s’occuper de questions concernant la sexualité.

Resúmen
Este artículo examina el papel de la juventud Bahá’í con respecto a las actitudes prevalentes encontradas en el
occidente hacia la sexualidad. Basandose en los resultados de una encuesta de 3,600 jovenes de 13-19 años, el
articulo delinea algunas de las actitudes corrientes de la población en general. El papel de la juventud y el
proceso del desarrollo espiritual, según describido en las escrituras Bahá’ís, son explorados con particular
atención al concepto de la sexualidad y el principio de la castidad. Se dan un número de sugerencias prácticas,
tanto para individuos como para instituciones que tienen que ver con asuntos de la sexualidad.

A     s the Bahá’í Faith becomes well known, its members will increasingly be called upon to justify the position

of the Bahá’í Faith on all matters including sexuality. Drawing on some recent data on current attitudes
among teenagers towards sexuality, this paper will examine the role of Bahá’í youth with respect to sexuality in
the light of Bahá’í teachings. It will also offer some practical suggestions for dealing with these issues on a day-
to-day basis. The authors, having grown up as Bahá’í youth in a Western society, have written this paper both
from the experience of their personal struggles and from their perspective as family physicians now having to
counsel adolescents, Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í.

Some Current Attitudes

To “set the scene,” it may be helpful to look at some data concerning attitudes and trends among youth.

Bibby and Posterski have published the results of a 1984 survey of 3,600 teenagers age fifteen to nineteen from
152 randomly selected schools across Canada. The survey was undertaken to provide “a comprehensive profile
of young people regarding their attitudes, values, beliefs, outlook, expectations and behavior” (xix), and the data
on sexuality are particularly illuminating. When asked the question, “If two people on a date like each other, is it
all right for them to...,” the responses were as tabulated below:

Note: In the “other response” column were “Yes” responses with the qualifier, “If they love each other,” written
in by the respondents. (76)

The data show 11 % of the teenage population endorsed having sexual relations on the first date. Another
42% (for a total of more than half of Canada’s teenagers) feel that intercourse is appropriate after a few dates.

Furthermore, the survey determined that 80% of Canadian youth are of the opinion that premarital sex is all
right when people love each other (see below), with more than 50%. feeling that sexual relations are also
acceptable within a few dates when individuals like each other. These attitudes are not particular only to
Canadian youth, as a variety of North American studies indicate that approximately 50% of fifteen to nineteen-
year-olds have engaged in premarital intercourse, with the range running from about 33% for fifteen-year-olds
to 67% for nineteen-year-olds (77). Some further data on sexual attitudes from the study appear in Table 2.

Lest it be thought that these are just “youth phenomena,” the study also found that these percentages were
virtually identical to adult attitudes, and on some issues (e.g., homosexuality, extramarital sex) youth were more
conservative than adults (82).

Only a cursory examination of these data is needed to show that in many areas these “current” attitudes
conflict with Bahá’í teachings on sexuality. Bahá’ís are not immune to the forces of the societies in which they
live, and Bahá’ís of all ages living in a Western society will be affected by these attitudes to one degree or
another—even as far as some having adopted them outright. In trying to help Bahá’í youth cope with the issues
of adolescence and sexuality, the Bahá’í community is continually striving to reflect in their purest form the
concepts inherent in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh concerning the character and role to be attained by youth. We
recognize that we are in an embryonic stage of our development and that we are far from perfect, especially in
the very private realm of intimacy and interpersonal relationships where traditional beliefs and crystallized
concepts are the most difficult and painful to be rooted out and transformed by the new Revelation. What
follows is an attempt at understanding concepts whose full meaning and implication will likely only become
evident to future generations.

The Role of Youth

First, what standards of behavior are expected of Bahá’í youth, and why are these standards so important? If
one looks at the Bahá’í writings, there is universal recognition that these standards are very high. Bahá’u’lláh
has stated:

> A race of men, incomparable in character, shall be raised up which, with the feet of detachment, will tread
> under all who are in heaven and on earth, and will cast the sleeve of holiness over all that hath been created
from water and clay. (Qtd. in Shoghi Effendi, Advent 26)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá calls upon humanity:
> ...let each one of you be as a lamp shining forth with the light of the virtues of the world of humanity. Be
> trustworthy, sincere, affectionate and replete with chastity. Be illumined, be spiritual, be divine, be glorious,
> be quickened of God, be a Bahá’í. (Promulgation 453)

No more explicit guidance for youth can be found than in the May 1985 message from the Universal House of
Justice:

> The words, the deeds, the attitudes, the lack of prejudice, the nobility of character, the high sense of service
> to others—in a word, those qualities and actions which distinguish a Bahá’í must unfailingly characterize
> their [the Bahá’í youth] inner life and outer behavior.... Rejecting the low sights of mediocrity, let them
> scale the ascending heights of excellence in all they aspire to do. May they resolve to elevate the very
> atmosphere in which they move.... (Unrestrained 187)

One function of the mission of Bahá’u’lláh is to provide the spiritual power and guidance for the creation of
a “new race of men” from all strata of society, including all ages. Youth must be in the vanguard of this
transformation. A movement is truly progressive and “intensely alive” (Shoghi Effendi, Advent 58) when youth
are found to be putting its fundamental principles into practice with enthusiasm and devotion. Shoghi Effendi
states that if the youth “are not distinguished for their high conduct, they cannot expect other young people to
take the Cause very seriously” (Bahá’í Youth 8).

Youth are less attached to outdated concepts and traditions and provide the basis for inner change that will
lead to the transformation of society as a whole. Therefore, at this rapidly evolving stage of transition in the
evolution of humanity from its adolescence to its maturity, the youth of this generation will, before the end of
this century, “stand at the helm of the Cause... in a period when the forces of history are moving to a climax,
when mankind will see the establishment of the Lesser Peace, and during which the Cause of God will play an
increasingly prominent role in the reconstruction of human society” (Universal House of Justice, Message
1983). Succinctly, Bahá’í youth have been appointed as the vanguard in the establishment of the New World
Order, and the character transformation required to perform this task successfully “can tolerate no compromise
with the theories, the standards, the habits, and the excesses of a decadent age” (Shoghi Effendi, Advent 25).

The issue for Bahá’í youth is not how to deal with peer pressure but to realize that they themselves are the
peer pressure. Shoghi Effendi eloquently states:

> Upon them rest the supreme and challenging responsibility to promote the interests of the Cause of God in
> the days to come, to co-ordinate its worldwide activities, to extend its scope, to safeguard its integrity, to
> exalt its virtues, define its purpose, and translate its ideals and aims into memorable and abiding
> achievements. Theirs is a mighty task, at once holy, stupendous and enthralling. (Qtd. in Bahá’í Youth iii)

Given the powerful statements in the Writings concerning the role of youth and the high standard of
behavior they must exemplify, it is easy to understand how an individual Bahá’í youth may feel overwhelmed
and helpless at this prospect. These feelings are particularly enhanced in the realm of sexuality where the Bahá’í
principles and laws governing the topic may appear to be unreasonable, dogmatic, and difficult to apply in
Western society.

The Process of Spiritual Growth

The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh provides the method required for the process of spiritual change from what
we are to what we must become. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes:

> ...that in every kind of excellence the people of God shall surpass all other human beings; that both
> outwardly; and inwardly they shall prove superior to the rest; that for purity, immaculacy, refinement, and
> the preservation of health, they shall be leaders in the vanguard of those who know. And that by their
> freedom from enslavement, their knowledge, their self-control, they shall be first among the pure, the free
> and the wise. [Emphasis added.] (Selections 150)

True freedom, as defined in the Bahá’í writings, is attained by obedience to the ordinances and precepts of
God. These laws are not arbitrary or dogmatic. They have a purpose, which is to liberate human beings from the
bondage of uncontrolled or misdirected instincts or urges. By following these laws, a person becomes truly free
to channel his or her full capacities towards the more essential goals of life—the most primary of which are the
search for truth and the attainment of knowledge.

Chaste eyes enjoy the beatific vision of the Lord and know what this encounter meaneth.... (‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Selections 146)

Knowledge is not blind acceptance of memorized recitations devoid of meaning. In the spirit of the Bahá’í
teachings, knowledge is the result of the process by which the seeker arrives at a true understanding of reality. In
this context, we grasp the significance of the laws and principles and their relevance to our well-being. These
newly attained insights generate changes in our being that increase our love for God, for his Manifestations, and
for his creation. We know why we should change; we have confidence in our ability to change; and we are
inspired to align our actions with these laws and principles. This is the process by which an individual grows
spiritually. Like any learning process, it is developmental in nature and therefore requires discipline, patience,
and above all self-control. It can be painfully slow, but it is the most assured way of internalizing laws and
enjoying their benefit rather than “enduring their burden.” The gift of understanding is viewed by the Bahá’í
writings as the foundation of this growth process. Therefore, before even asking what the Bahá’í Faith tells its
followers to do about sexuality, it is fundamental to consider the Bahá’í concept of sexuality.

The Bahá’í Concept of Sexuality

> The Bahá’í Faith does not have a puritanical view of sex. Sexuality’s scope extends beyond solely for
> procreation and is seen as a God-given “natural right of every individual” (Shoghi Effendi qtd. in Bahá’í
> Marriage 14).

Shoghi Effendi states:

> It must be remembered, however, that the maintenance of such a high standard of moral conduct is not to be
> associated or confused with any form of asceticism, or of excessive and bigoted puritanism. (Advent 28)

Furthermore, the Bahá’í writings do not view the sexual impulse as arising from a sinful, guilt-ridden part
of an individual. Therefore, “The Bahá’ís do not believe in the suppression of the sex impulse but in its
regulation and control” (Shoghi Effendi qtd. in Bahá’í Marriage 14). We often pay lip-service to this principle,
but many Bahá’ís attempt to obtain control of their sexual feelings through complete suppression, perhaps
unaware that there may be more creative ways of channelling these feelings keeping within the Bahá’í
framework. This perhaps is a natural reaction to the excessive misuse of the sex instinct so prevalent in our
society, especially among youth where sex can be unconsciously viewed not only as a means for physical
gratification but also as a vehicle to obtain secondary gains such as friendship, love, self-confidence, and
acceptance so desperately needed during adolescence. When sex is pursued in this way, it generates conflict and
profound unhappiness.

In a Bahá’í context, sex is viewed as primarily a spiritual phenomenon that uses the tool of the body for
expression. The Báb writes:

> As this physical frame is the throne of the inner temple, whatever occurs to the former is felt by the latter.
> In reality that which takes delight in joy or is saddened by pain is the inner temple of the body, not the body
> itself. (Selections 95)

Unquestionably, the body, with all its senses, experiences pleasure through sex, but it is the soul that
translates this experience into meaningful fulfillment. Sex is a very powerful force with enormous potential to
bond two individuals on a very deep level. When illumined with the light of spirituality as a physical expression
of a spiritual union, sex augments love, unity, companionship, dignity, and is a source of happiness and
upliftment. Divorced from spirituality and a true understanding of God’s purpose for man, the individuals
involved run a serious risk of being left with unwanted attachment, estrangement, and abasement.

The Bahá’í teachings explain that union and oneness are essential attributes of the Creator and that the
principal generating impulse of creation is to manifest this oneness at increasingly more advanced levels.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains:

> From the pairing of even the smallest particles in the world of being are the grace and bounty of God made
> manifest; and the higher the degree, the more momentous is the union.... And above all other unions is that
> between human beings, especially when it cometh to pass in the love of God. Thus is the primal oneness
> made to appear .... (Selections 119)

It is indeed a powerful testimony to the beauty of God’s creation that all the elements exist within human
beings for this union to occur—the diversity and uniqueness of individuals; the complementarity of male and
female qualities; and finally the power of attraction, including the force of sexuality.
The Principle of Chastity

Once we understand the role of sexuality in human interaction, it is easier to comprehend the Bahá’í
principle of chastity.

> Chastity implies both before and after marriage an unsullied, chaste sex life. Before marriage absolutely
> chaste, after marriage absolutely faithful to one’s chosen companion. (Shoghi Effendi qtd. in Bahá’í
> Marriage 14)

This principle assures that the physical and spiritual union of woman and man will serve as the basis for one
of the most positive and productive units of society: the institution of marriage, considered by Bahá’u’lláh as a
“fortress for well-being” (Bahá’í Prayers 105). The meaning of the Bahá’í concept of chastity extends beyond
mere restriction of sexual intercourse to marriage. It is an attribute to be integrated into the character of every
individual that frees one to relate to all human beings, including one’s spouse, as noble and spiritual beings
rather than as sex objects. It endows us with internal controls that enable us to form connections between hearts
and “to establish bonds of comradeship and love which are eternal and founded on the spiritual life of man, not
on his physical life” (Shoghi Effendi qtd. in Bahá’í Marriage 14). In the words of Bahá’u’lláh, “The brightness
of the light of chastity sheddeth its illumination upon the worlds of the spirit, and its fragrance is wafted even
unto the Most Exalted Paradise” (qtd. in Shoghi Effendi, Advent 27).

Finally, one must always remember that the spirit of Bahá’í law lies in the principle of moderation.

> The standard inculcated by Bahá’u’lláh, seeks, under no circumstances, to deny anyone the legitimate right
> and privilege to derive the fullest advantage and benefit from the manifold joys, beauties, and pleasures
> with which the world has been so plentifully enriched by an All-Loving Creator. (Shoghi Effendi, Advent
> 28)

Some Practical Points

Having dealt with some of the Bahá’í concepts and principles on sexuality, the question now arises as to
how to apply these principles practically on a day-to-day basis. What might be some of the do’s and don’ts of
meeting the challenge of sexuality as a Bahá’í youth, parent, or institution?

Don’t Assume
All of us have been, are, or will be adolescents, hence any discussion of adolescence is necessarily subjective.
For those who have passed through or are currently passing through this period, there is a danger in the tendency
to generalize and assume that the experience and challenge of the one is the experience and challenge of the
many. It is here that any discussion of adolescence, including this one, risks being biased, superficial, and
simplistic. Sider and Kreider in their article, “Coping with Adolescent Patients,” write:

> Each individual handles the challenges of adolescence in his own unique way, and no schematic outline can
> account for the fits and starts, the inconsistencies, contradictions and vicissitudes of these years.
> Adolescence is never traversed in the abstract. It is experienced in the most personal terms, an exquisitely
> idiosyncratic journey. (840)

Quite simply put, if the individual or institution attempting to help Bahá’í youth through this period is not
acutely attentive and observant of the individual Bahá’í youth, the helper risks being “out in left field” when the
play is in the right. Given that adolescence is a distinctly unique and individual experience, its challenges by
necessity require unique and individual approaches and solutions. The approach taken by a particular individual
or institution in a particular instance may be completely inappropriate in a similar but slightly different situation.
A lack of detailed “cookbook” responses to the various challenges of adolescence should be expected and
welcomed and never be cause for anxiety;1 for it is through the utilization of the creative process liberated by the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh that individuals and institutions have arrived and will continue to arrive at unique and
creative responses to any problem. As demonstrated throughout Bahá’í history, the followers of Bahá’u’lláh
have shown their ability to surmount any obstacles; they have the potential to turn “ashes into roses.” The
challenges of adolescence are no exception.

Another frequent pitfall is the assumption about the period of adolescence itself. All too frequently
adolescence is portrayed as a perilous journey, fraught with tempests, every moment a life and death struggle,
with no guarantee of safe arrival at the port of adulthood. This frankly melodramatic attitude can leave those to
whom adolescence was a positive and rewarding experience in the ridiculous position of feeling guilty or
somehow deprived of a “normal” adolescence. Again to quote from Sider and Kreider:

In spite of the experts’ dire predictions, most adolescents survive and do tolerably well. Many appear to be

relatively unperturbed by the profound biological and psychological changes occurring in them and give
> every evidence of thoroughly enjoying their adolescent years. Some in fact do so well that they surpass their
> progenitors. Adolescence is not the only difficult phase of life; nor is it clear sailing thereafter. Every stage
> of life has its unique stresses as well as its share of those experiences common to human beings of any age.

(“Coping” 840)

The period of adolescence brings new resources to the individual: enormous physical energy, a large
repertoire of social, intellectual, and physical skills that can all be channelled and brought to bear on productive
activities. Indeed, the Bahá’í writings accentuate the potential of Bahá’í youth rather than the problems, and
hence for Bahá’í youth, this period has ever more potential to be a rich, rewarding, and productive experience.

> The endurance of youth under arduous conditions, their vitality and vigour, and their ability to adapt
> themselves to local situations, to meet new challenges, and to impart their warmth and enthusiasm to those
> they visit, combines with the standard of conduct upheld by Bahá’í youth, [to] make them potent
> instruments for the execution of the contemplated projects. (Universal House of Justice qtd. in Lights 507)

Spiritualize, Spiritualize, Spiritualize

> He should consume every wayward thought with the flame of His loving mention.... (Bahá’u’lláh, Book of
> Certitude 194)

Spiritualization of one’s life with daily prayer and deepening is the cornerstone of spiritual development
and the key to the response to any challenge, the challenges facing Bahá’í youth being no exception.
Spiritualization is given paramount importance in the Bahá’í writings, particularly those of Shoghi Effendi and
in the writings of the Universal House of Justice on the subject of Bahá’í youth.2 All too often, however,
individuals will sabotage their own efforts by “skipping” this crucial first step.

The following quotation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is probably one of the most illuminating explanations of the
primacy of spiritualization:

> Just as the earth attracts everything to the centre of gravity, and every object thrown upward into space will
> come down, so also material ideas and worldly thoughts attract man to the centre of self. Anger, passion,
> ignorance, prejudice, greed, envy, covetousness, jealousy and suspicion prevent man from ascending to the
> realms of holiness, imprisoning him in the claws of self and the cage of egotism. The physical man,
> unassisted by the divine power, trying to escape from one of these invisible enemies will unconsciously fall
> into the hands of another. No sooner does he attempt to soar upward than the density of the love of self, like
> the power of gravity draws him to the centre of the earth. The only power capable of delivering man from
> this captivity is the power of the breaths of the Holy Spirit. (Qtd. in Bahá’í Readings 305)

Clearly any program, counsels, or efforts that are not linked to a regular program of spiritualization are
ultimately doomed to failure. Even success in overcoming a particular weakness or fault, if not linked to a
process of spiritualization, risks leaving an egotistical and undesirable rigidity and pride in its wake rather than
wisdom, compassion, and flexibility.

It’s All in Your Perspective

Closely linked to the concept of spiritualization is the question of perspective. When involved in the throes
of a problem, particularly one linked to sexuality, the perspective on that problem can become extremely
distorted. Feelings of guilt and shame lead to depression and despair. This, in turn, generates a very negative
self-image, and even the smallest problem can seem insurmountable. How does one use spiritualization in this
instance?

O SON OF MAN!

> Veiled in My immemorial being and in the ancient eternity of My essence, I knew My love for thee;
> therefore I created thee, have engraved on thee Mine image and revealed to thee My beauty. (Bahá’u’lláh,
> Hidden Words 4)

O SON OF SPIRIT!

> Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased thyself. Rise then unto that for which thou wast created.
(Bahá’u’lláh, Hidden Words 9)

The distinguishing characteristic of a human being is his nobility of character. No matter what the
circumstance or the condition, the underlying reality remains that of a nobility of character in the image of God
Himself. Negative self-images have no place in a Bahá’í context, and self-abasement is contradictory and
forbidden (Bahá’u’lláh, Hidden Words 37). Struggles and frustrations should be expected as the result of the
nobility striving to express itself, and the spiritualization process in these instances must be directed towards
strengthening this image of nobility, as opposed to a tendency to cripple oneself with guilt and self-flagellation.
During these struggles it may be helpful to focus on the “gentle writings,” those that encourage rather than those
that chastize, i.e., in the middle of a struggle it may be encouraging to be addressed as “O My Friend,” “O
Companion of My Throne,” or “O Banished and Faithful Friend,” rather than “O Weed that springeth out of
Dust,” or “O Ye that are lying as dead on the couch of heedlessness.”

The Bahá’í principle of overlooking the bad qualities and focusing on the good applies to oneself as well as
to others-a fact that is often overlooked. The Universal House of Justice, quoting the Guardian, wrote to an
individual:

> We must be patient with others, infinitely patient! But also with our own poor selves, remembering that
> even the Prophets of God sometimes got tired and cried out in despair! He urges you to persevere and add
> up your accomplishments, rather than to dwell on the dark side of things. Everyone’s life has both a dark
> and bright side. The Master said: Turn your back to the darkness and your face to me.3

As important as gaining a proper perspective of oneself is developing a proper perspective of the problem.

Overzealous efforts to purify one’s life and to overcome obstacles of a personal nature can be compared to
trying to get rid of a beachball by forcing it underwater. The more one pushes, the more the ball resists until
finally inordinate amounts of energy are expended in trying to keep the ball underwater. Sometimes it is
appropriate simply to leave it alone for a while, to turn one’s attention to other concerns, or perhaps to consider
alternative methods to the “head-on frontal assault.” In a letter to an individual struggling with a problem related
to sexuality, the Universal House of Justice wrote:

> Your problem, therefore, is one against which you should continue to struggle, with determination and with
> the aid of prayer. You should remember, however, that it is only one of the many temptations and faults that
> a human being must strive to overcome during his lifetime, and you should not increase the difficulty you
> have by over-emphasizing its importance. We suggest that you try to see it within the whole spectrum of the
> qualities that a Bahá’í must develop in his character. Be vigilant against temptation but do not allow it to
> claim too great a share of your attention. You should concentrate, rather, on the virtues that you should
> develop, the services you should strive to render, and, above all, on God and His attributes, and devote your
> energies to living a full Bahá’í life in all its many aspects. (Qtd. in Lights 270)

Clearly, there is an appropriate amount of energy to be devoted to surmounting any problem and keeping it
in proper perspective. The “most grievous error,” after all is backbiting. Everything else is secondary. Too little
effort and no progress is made; too much and the problem can assume unwieldy proportions. The challenge is
determining the appropriate amount of energy and persevering in its application.

Little by Little—Day by Day

To try and to persevere is to achieve ultimate and complete victory. (Shoghi Effendi, Messages 17)

Perseverance is the hallmark of any spiritual struggle, and struggles with sexuality are no exception. It is
important to remember that purity of thought and motive are for the most part acquired traits and not inherent.
As well, it should be remembered that victory is very often achieved in the long term over months and years and
is usually a collection of “minor virtues garnered in a sweeter time” (White, Another Song 111)—a series of
small victories on a battleground littered with defeats and setbacks. Bahá’u’lláh Himself poignantly alludes to
the frustrations that are the necessary lot of all who would advance toward God:

> The companions of all who adore Thee are the tears they shed, and the comforters of such as seek Thee are
> the groans they utter, and the food of them who haste to meet Thee is the fragments of their broken hearts.

(Bahá’í Prayers 192)

In this frustration, however, there is great wisdom and purpose, for the defeats and setbacks themselves are
as important a part of the process as the victories. Combined with a process of spiritualization, they bring
patience, humility, a lessening of reliance on self and a turning to God, and a great compassion for all those who
struggle.

It’s the constant chipping away, the perseverance, that eventually destroys all obstacles. One would well
remember the story of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who when approached by a believer in the depths of discouragement
despairing of ever acquiring the qualities and virtues that Bahá’ís are required to possess, replied with the
greatest compassion and encouragement, “little by little; day by day” (qtd. in Bahá’í World 12: 704).

God Loves Laughter

> Joy gives us wings! In times of joy our strength is more vital, our intellect keener, and our understanding
> less clouded. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Paris Talks 109)

Are you happy? Be Happy! (‘Abdu’l-Bahá qtd. in Vignettes from the Life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 110)

There are very few situations, no matter how difficult or tragic, that do not have their humorous aspects—
even if sometimes only in retrospect. The history of the Bahá’í Faith provides examples time and again of how
humor was used to rise above trials and tests. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was renowned for his sense of humor. Hají Mirzá
Haidar-‘Alí, the “Angel of Carmel,” who, after being abused and beaten by authorities hostile to the Faith, had
his beard burnt off and was slung sideways over a mule with another companion to be taken to prison. All along
the way the two laughed at how ridiculous the other looked. Zaynu’l Muqarrabín, the companion of Bahá’u’lláh,
was treasured because of his ability to make Bahá’u’lláh laugh.

In the midst of a struggle, when weary “of battle far prolonged” (White, Another Song 112), a bit of
laughter, even gentle self-ridicule, can push back the shadows and banish the darkness. Might one not imagine
even the Concourse on High looking on, smiling knowingly at our furious activity and concern with what are, in
final analysis and considering the grand order of the universe, very minor and ordinary problems? Might we not
join in with them to let the laughter “refresh and gladden our spirits” and in so doing gain fresh perspective and
a new resolve?

There is Strength in Numbers

To return to the study on attitudes by Bibby and Posterski, one of their questions concerned values and what
teenagers viewed as important. Topping the list of responses were “Friendship” and “Being loved,” rated as
“Very important” by 91 % and 87% respectively. These values were viewed by teenagers as being more
important than “Freedom” (84%), “Success” (78%), and “Excitement” (58%), and, perhaps surprisingly, far
outranking “Recognition” (41 %) and “Being Popular” (21 %) often identified as the major concerns of
adolescence (Generation 17). For many, this information comes as no surprise and will simply confirm personal
experiences or intuition. Nevertheless, it deserves very special attention. Adolescence is a period of tremendous
change in the socialization of the individual. In a Western society, in particular, it usually represents one of the
first steps in “leaving the nest.” The adolescent begins to develop emotional bonds outside his or her immediate
family of a depth and intensity not previously known.

These bonds (particularly when developed between Bahá’í youth and especially in the context of Bahá’í
activities) can be a source of encouragement and strength, love and harmony that can last over a lifetime and
indeed through all the worlds of God. It is the rare individual who, having grown up as an active Bahá’í youth,
does not have several of these bonds that span distance and time and from which they derive great comfort and
strength in time of difficulty.

If friendship, as Bibby and Posterski have found, has such a primary importance for young men and
women, then it is imperative that Bahá’í communities pay particular attention to their youth, to make an extra
effort to extend the hand of real friendship and understanding, of support and encouragement. The communities
should make an extra effort to involve the youth in meaningful ways in Bahá’í activities and to encourage as
much contact with other Bahá’í youth as possible. The investment of time and effort at this crucial period will
payoff a thousand-fold in the future.

> more from it is because they have not learned to duly draw these mighty forces of love and strength and
> harmony generated by the Faith. (Universal House of Justice, Unrestrained 169)

Don’t Be Afraid to Ask for Help

> Whenever ye fall ill, refer to competent physicians. (Bahá’u’lláh qtd. in Universal House of Justice,
> Selections on Health)

> According to the explicit decree of Bahá’u’lláh one must not turn aside from the advice of a competent
> doctor. It is imperative to consult one even if the patient himself be a well-known and eminent physician.
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections 156)

Occasionally some of the problems of sexuality in adolescence will assume rather more serious dimensions,
either because of the nature of the problem itself or the way it was handled. Homosexuality would be a case in
point. In these instances any personal efforts on the part of the individual or on the part of friends, family, or
institutions should be supplemented by professional advice. It often takes much courage to approach a
“stranger” to discuss a personal problem, and more often than not it will be difficult to find a professional
sympathetic to the Bahá’í viewpoint or to convince a therapist of the value of a particular course of action and
the sincerity of an individual’s desire to overcome a problem. These difficulties may present obstacles to
effective therapy but should not be considered as insurmountable or as excuses for not seeking help.

Conclusion

Dealing with sexuality is not easy It is neither easy for youth nor for those counselling them in a given
situation to understand the spiritual principles involved, to discover an appropriate solution, and to carry through
with the necessary action. For Bahá’í health professionals, in particular, it represents a special challenge. What
is an appropriate response, for example, after getting a phone call at midnight from a Bahá’í mother who is
frantic after having just found a box of birth control pills in her fourteen-year-old daughter’s top drawer? Or
conversely, what is appropriate advice to give to the teenager who arrives in the office having already decided to
have premarital sex? To what degree is it desirable, permissible, or necessary to allow one’s principles and
beliefs to direct the behavior of those who may not share them?

Whatever the situation, with patients both Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í, it is imperative that the Bahá’í health
professionals, or for that matter all Bahá’ís, have credible explanations for their points of view and practical
ways to apply them. This is only possible when one has deepened and clarified beforehand one’s understanding
of the Bahá’í concepts involved. We hope that this paper has contributed in some way to this process.
