         Visits of the Hands of the Cause of God to

Ireland by Betsy Omidvaran
Abstract
This paper presents an overview of all known visits by Hands of the
Cause of God, the highest-ranking officers of the Bahá’í Faith, to Ireland,
and reviews the many sources available to a historian who wants to delve
into this fascinating but largely uninvestigated topic – including back
issues of New Day and national newspapers. Included is a timeline of the
known visits between 1952 and 1986.

Introduction
The Hands of the Cause of God have played a role in the progress
of the Bahá’í Faith that is unique in religious history and the Bahá’í
community in Ireland was a part of this. For the first time in an
independent religion, there was a clear line of succession from the
Founder to His successors, and an appointed group of people was
specifically charged with protecting its coherence during a
transition period between the appointed successors and the clearly
delineated elected body charged with governance of the religion
into the future.

There were at least four believers referred to as such by
Bahá’u’lláh and at least four by his appointed Successor, 'Abdu’l-
Bahá. As with many other aspects of the development of the
administration, however, it was 'Abdu’l-Bahá’s successor, Shoghi
Effendi, the Guardian, who clarified and systematised the
appointment, roles and purposes of the Hands of the Cause. He
appointed at least ten posthumously, and then, between 1951 and
1957, appointed 32 during their lifetimes, of which 27 were still
alive when he died on 4 November 1957. Most of these 32 were
appointed in three contingents, but five were appointed
individually during the period. The three contingents were 12
appointments on 24 December 1951, seven appointments on 29
February 1952 and eight appointments on 2 October 1957.

These 27 men and women led the world-wide Bahá’í
community through the last five and a half years of the Ten Year
Plan up to the election of the Universal House of Justice in April
1963, a period which is often termed the interregnum (literally
‘between reigns,’ that is, between the ministries of the Guardian
and then of the House of Justice).

The Ten Year Plan was one of a series of Plans for the
development of the Bahá’í Faith. As the Guardian systematised the
institution of the Hand of the Cause, so he systematised other
aspects of the Bahá’í administration, devising a series of Plans,
each with specific goals. At first, these were varying plans
assigned to individual National Spiritual Assemblies. The Ten
Year Plan was the first worldwide plan, lasting from 1953 to 1963.
The Guardian passed away in 1957, before this plan was
completed, and the 27 Hands of the Cause administered the world
Bahá’í community until the election of the Universal House of
Justice in 1963.

This was followed by a succession of plans decided by the
House of Justice. After a one-year hiatus, there was a Nine Year
Plan from 1964-1973. Then after another one-year hiatus, there was
a Five Year Plan from 1974-1979, a Seven-Year Plan from 1979-
1986 and a Six Year Plan from 1986-1992. The latter saw the last
visit of a Hand of the Cause to Ireland.

In Ireland for many years there had been the smallest
handful of believers. In 1948, a Local Assembly was formed in
Dublin and slowly the Bahá’í community in Ireland began to grow
and to spread.

Visits by Hands of the Cause to Ireland
The connection of the Hands of the Cause with the Faith in Ireland
is most strongly felt through the presence of George Townshend, a
Church of Ireland clergyman and convert, who left the ministry in
1947 and was appointed a Hand of the Cause in December 1951
with the first contingent of twelve. He passed away a few months
before the Guardian in 1957.

The first to set foot in Ireland, other than George Townshend,
was Leroy Ioas, who was born in 1896. His parents both became
Bahá’ís in 1898. The family was very active in the Bahá’í
community and they all met 'Abdu’l-Bahá during his travels in
America in 1912. Leroy was appointed by the Guardian to the
International Bahá’í Council in 1950 and as a Hand of the Cause in
the first contingent in December 1951. He arrived in Haifa in
March 1952 to act as the Secretary-General of the International
Bahá’í Council, as well as assistant secretary to the Guardian, and

rendered services in many aspects of the work in Haifa over the
following years.

His first visit to Ireland was very brief. In February (or
March) 1952 on his way to the World Centre, he stopped in
Shannon airport 1 and phoned George Townshend, who was living
in Dublin.

His second visit to Ireland was in 1955, when he came for
one day to visit George Townshend. In her book about her father,
Anita Ioas Chapman says the following concerning the last two
years of his life, when he was ill much of the time:

> He thought back on the long years of struggle to build
> communities and develop strength in the believers … He
> remembered his travels and the long day spent in Dublin
> with fellow Hand of the Cause George Townshend – whose
> dearest wish was to meet Shoghi Effendi – when Leroy
> talked hour after hour about the Guardian and Haifa and led
> Townshend on a visit to the World Centre right from his sick
bed.2

In 1961, during the interregnum, he visited for the third and
last time, for the Summer School which took place at Mourne
Grange, Kilkeel in Northern Ireland from 26 August to 5
September. It was part of a trip to the British Isles to celebrate the
fiftieth anniversary of the visit of 'Abdu’l-Bahá in 1911. He arrived
at the Summer School, accompanied by his wife, Sylvia, who was
also a member of the International Bahá’í Council, on 3 September,
in time for the exact anniversary of 'Abdu’l-Bahá’s arrival in the
British Isles. A special programme had been prepared on the life
and Writings of 'Abdu’l-Bahá, including a reading of his first
public talk in the West. There was a special letter from the Hands
of the Cause in Haifa to the British community and a cable to the
School.3 Mr. Ioas passed away 22 July 1965.

Another Hand of the Cause who played a role in significant
developments of the Faith in Ireland was Mr William Sears. He
was born 28 March 1911 and died 25 March 1992 and was
appointed a Hand of the Cause with the last continent in October
1957, one month before the passing of the Guardian. His first visit
to Ireland was in October 1968. He spoke at a Conference at the
Hazíratu’l-Quds in Dublin, 41 Morehampton Road, for all the

Bahá’ís in Ireland north and south, over the weekend of 11-13
October.

He was received by President Eamon de Valera on Tuesday,
15 October and presented him with a copy of his book, God Loves
Laughter. This was announced in the Social and Personal column of
The Irish Times of 16 October (p. 13) as follows: ‘The President
yesterday received Mr. William B. Sears, California … ‘ It was also
mentioned in The Irish Press (p. 10). Mr Sears recounts this
experience in his book, Tokoloshe.4 ‘I had coffee with President
Eamon de Valera during his final days in the presidential residence
in Dublin, and he told me that one of the first ambassadors he had
appointed had been named Sears. I left him an autographed copy
of GOD LOVES LAUGHTER, my light-hearted book about the
Bahá’í Faith. “I’ll have my secretary read it to me,” he said.
“There’s nothing in here that could embarrass a young girl, is
there?”’ He says that when he and Phil O’Brien returned from
touring the grounds, the President rapped on the window and
invited them to have a photograph taken with him. This photo has
hung in the National Bahá’í Centre with other photos of Irish
Presidents and may do so again.

Mr Sears then travelled to Northern Ireland, where he met
the Bahá’ís there in the Local Bahá’í Centre in Belfast, the Local
Assemblies of Belfast, Bangor and Castlereagh on the sixteenth
and all the friends on the seventeenth. This was part of a major trip
to the British Isles from 7 September to 31 October.

His second and last visit to Ireland was in 1972, when he
represented the Universal House of Justice at the first National
Convention of the Republic of Ireland.5

A third Hand of the Cause who played a significant role in
the development of the Cause in Ireland was Mr John Robarts,
who was born 2 November 1901 and died 18 June 1991. He was
appointed a Hand of the Cause in the last contingent in October
1957\.

He visited Ireland at least five times. The first visit was in
October 1970, when he visited Belfast 22-22 October, then Limerick
and then was present at a weekend school in Dublin, 24-25
October. Intensive efforts to make the Bahá’í Faith known had
been taking place in Limerick. The first person converted after Mr
Robarts’s visit and this was swiftly followed by an individual in

Dublin and others in Limerick. Mr Robarts visited again with his
wife Audrey in 1976 for the Summer School in Newtown School.

He visited again 23-24 May 1981, where he delivered a
message from the Universal House of Justice on the importance of
daily prayer. There are a number of photos of this, including a
very large group photo.6

He attended the Dublin International Conference on 25-27

June 1982, with Collis Featherstone, another Hand of the Cause
who was representing the Universal House of Justice. During the
Conference, he spoke about ‘The Local Spiritual Assembly – A
Divine Institution’ and on the subject of teaching.7

His last visit, the last visit of any Hand of the Cause and the
only one during the Six Year Plan, was in 1986, when he and
Audrey made an extensive tour of the country. They were in
Letterkenny, Co. Donegal for the inauguration of the local
Hazíratu’l-Quds, where they were photographed planting a tree.
They also visited Co. Limerick, where there was a special
gathering for older people. They met the National Assembly in
Adare, Co. Limerick, then went to Cork, the National Hazíratu’l-
Quds in Dublin and to the Northern Ireland Summer School.8

Mr Collis Featherstone, mentioned above, visited twice. He
was born on 5 May 1913 and died on 29 September 1990 in
Kathmandu. His first visit was from 8-10 June 1973. The only
record I have found of this visit was that it was announced in the
Feastletter in May of 1973.

His second visit was as the representative of the Universal
House of Justice at the International Conference in Dublin from 25-
27 June 1982. He also attended the International Conference in
Manila in May as part of a four-month round-the-world trip. At
the Dublin Conference he spoke on ‘The Pattern of Bahá’í Life’ and
on the role of the individual believer. During the Conference there
was a reception for prominent people, including the Ambassador
of Australia, which was where Mr Featherstone came from.

In addition to Mr Ioas, two other Hands of the Cause visited
during the 1950s. Hermann Grossmann visited three times. He
visited George Townshend for one day in February 1955, the day
before Leroy Ioas came. He was at the Summer School in Northern
Ireland in 1956 and visited again in the summer of 1958. I have no
other information about these visits, two of which were during the
Ten Year Plan and one during the interregnum. Mr Grossmann

was born in 1899 and died on 7 July 1968. He was appointed a
Hand of the Cause on 24 December 1951 in the first contingent.

The other Hand of the Cause to visit during the 1950s was
Dhikru’lláh Khadem. This was either in 1952 or 1953. New Day, in
an article written at the time of his second visit in 1984,9 says that
it was in 1953, but his biography, written by his wife, Javidukht
Khadem, 10 says that it was in August of 1952. There is a photo of
this visit. She also says that he had ‘a deep love for Ireland that
only grew more intense with subsequent visits.’11 With regard to
the use of the plural ‘visits’, however, there is no detail of more
than one subsequent visit.

Mr. Khadem’s second visit was for the Summer School, 11-18

August 1984.12 New Day for July/August for that year says that he
gave most of the sessions at the school, which took place in Kings
Hospital in Dublin. There is a photo of the Summer School. Mr
Khadem was born in 1904 and died on 13 November 1986. He was
appointed a Hand of the Cause with the second contingent on 29
February 1952.

Besides Mr Grossmann and Mr Ioas, the only Hand of the
Cause to visit during the Interregnum or the Ten Year Plan was
General Shu’á’u’lláh Alá’í, who visited three times altogether.
General Alá’í was born in Iran on 16 November 1889 and died on
the same date in 1984. He was appointed a Hand of the Cause in
the second contingent in 1952. According to The Bahá’í Journal
(August 1961), he visited on 10-12 April 1961, but there are no
details as to exactly where he went. He visited again on 12 June
1967, as recorded by O.Z. Whitehead in New Day of February 1993.

His third and final visit was in the week following National
Convention in 1975.13 National Convention that year was the
weekend of the 26-27 April. During this visit, he addressed two
meetings, one in Limerick, attended by Bahá’ís from Cork, Galway,
Clonmel, Wexford, Waterford, Carlow and Kilkenny, and another
meeting in Dublin. There is a photograph of him in the National
Hazíratu’l-Quds in 1975.14

There was a one-year period between the end of the Ten Year
Plan with the election of the Universal House of Justice and the
beginning of the Nine Year Plan, which lasted from 1964 to 1973.
During that year two Hands of the Cause visited Ireland. The first
was Abu’l-Qásim Faizí, who was born in Iran in 1906 and died 19
November 1980. He was appointed a Hand of the Cause with the

third contingent in 1957. Mr Faizí visited Ireland three times
altogether.

The first time was in late May 1963, the month after the
election of the first Universal House of Justice and the Bahá’í
World Congress. O.Z. Whitehead describes this in his article on the
visits of Mr Faizí, which was serialized in four editions of New
Day, April, May, June and July/August 1993. On the evening of
his first day, there was a meeting for the Bahá’ís of Dublin in the
late Adib Taherzadeh’s sitting room. On his second day, Mr Faizí,
Zebby and Adib went to St. Patrick’s Cathedral and in the
afternoon, Adib took him to Belfast to meet the friends there.

The second visit was in 3-4 January 1966, with his wife,
Gloria. In the evening they gave a talk in the home of Weston and
Mary Huxtable, in which Mr Faizí addressed the difficult situation
in many European countries. The next day, they went to Belfast.
Zebby concludes his essay by describing Mr Faizí’s ability to
encourage individual believers and the sixteen letters that Mr Faizí
wrote to him during the remainder of his life. Of interest to our
subject here, Mr Faizí strongly encouraged Zebby to write about
the early believers and spoke about the importance of everyone
doing so as much as possible. He quotes him as saying,

> it is my firm belief that in future the people of the world will
> prove thirsty to read books and recollections about the
> followers of the Bahá’í Faith in all lands. They will no more
> read books which are detrimental to the souls, hearts and
> minds of themselves and their children.’ (ND July/August
> 1993, p. 4)

He urged Zebby to follow the example of 'Abdu’l-Bahá, who
‘spent many a night in giving sketches of the lives of early
believers …’

Mr. Faizí’s final visit to Ireland was 10-15 September 1974, as
part of extensive travels in the US and Europe. He visited Dublin,
Bray, Waterford and Limerick. In Limerick, he spoke to believers
from all over the island.15

Also during the year between the Ten Year Plan and the Nine
Year Plan, in January of 1964, John Ferraby paid his first of four
visits to Ireland. O.Z. Whitehead has described these four visits in
an unpublished essay. His next visit was in December of 1964. He

visited again 11 to 14 April of 1967 and 14 January of 1969. [Zebby
says 1971, ‘about three years later,’ but this probably refers to the
visit of 1969.] Mr Ferraby was born 9 January 1914 and died on 5
September 1973. He was appointed a Hand of the Cause with the
third contingent in October 1957.

During the Nine Year Plan 1964-73, there was a steady flow
of visits by Hands of the Cause. Tarázu’lláh Samandarí was born
16 October 1875 and was the only Hand of the cause who had met
Bahá’u’lláh. Thus his presence was particularly special to the
necessarily small number of Bahá’ís who were on hand to meet
him during his visit in 1965 at the age of 90. I do not know the
exact dates or the venue of the meeting(s), but the British Bahá’í
Journal of July 1965 says ‘a few weeks ago.’ He gathered friends
from all communities north and south. Mr Samandarí was
appointed with the first contingent in 1951 and passed away 2
September 1968.

Jalál Khazeh was the special guest at two Summer Schools
held in the Hall School, Monkstown, the first and second in the
Republic, 13-27 July 1968 and 5-15 July 1969. Mr Khazeh was born
24 February 1897 in Iran. From 1963-1968 he lived in South
America. In 1969, he made an extended visit to Europe before
moving back to Iran. He was in hiding from 1979-84, then escaped
and lived out his life in Canada, where he died 21 February 1990.
He was appointed individually on 7 December 1953.

Dr Ugo Giachery visited twice. From 8-9 May 1971, he
visited Dublin and on 4-5 November 1972 he attended the first
National Teaching Conference in the Republic, speaking in several
sessions on the qualities of the Guardian and his experiences in
helping to build up the World Centre.16 Dr Giachery was born 13
May 1896. In 1969, he and Angeline settled in Monaco and visited
many European countries over the next few years. He was
appointed in the first contingent in December 1951 and died 5 July
1982 in Western Samoa.

Hand of the Cause Paul Haney was probably here during the
Nine Year Plan, in August 1971. In a letter dated 2 March 1975, he
mentioned that he met friends in Dublin at that time, on his way to
the North Atlantic Oceanic Conference in Reykjavik, Iceland. I
have no other reference to this visit. Mr Haney was born six
months after his parents’ pilgrimage in 1909. His mother was
pregnant at the time and 'Abdu’l-Bahá named him Paul ‘for the

outside world’ and He also named him 'Abdu’l-Bahá, which He
said was his ‘real name.’17 He was appointed individually 19
March 1954 and was killed in a car accident in Haifa on 3
December 1982.

Mr Haney came to the Summer School 2-16 August 1975.18

He spoke about the functioning of Local and National Assemblies,
as well as the individual within the administration. He also
explained the work of the Universal House of Justice and the
International Teaching Centre.

Dr Rahmatu’lláh Muhájir was born 4 April 1923 in Iran,
pioneered with his wife to the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia
during the Ten Year Plan, for which they were made Knights of
Bahá’u’lláh. He was appointed a Hand of the Cause in the third
contingent 2 October 1957, and spent much of the next twenty
years, until he died 29 December 1979, travelling around the world
visiting Bahá’ís and teaching, especially in very remote locations,
but including Europe and North America.

He visited Ireland three times. The first time was 6-7 July
1973\.19 On 6 July, he met in the National Centre with believers
form Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Bray, Kilkenny and Waterford. On 7
July he consulted with the National Assembly, then travelled to
Limerick, where he recommended a goal of increasing the number
of believers; a goal of 300 was decided.

His second visit was to Summer School in August 1974

(Annual Report 131). His third visit was 15-17 June 1979.20 On 16
June, he spoke in the Prince of Wales Hotel in Athlone to believers
from eight communities, but I have as yet found no record of
where else he went. Lists in the book, Dr. Muhájir, confirm that he
visited Ireland in 1973, 1974 and 1979.

In 1978, during the Five Year Plan, both 'Amatu’l-Bahá
Rúhíyyih Khánum and 'Alí-Akbar Furútan visited, the only time
either of them visited Ireland.

Mr Furútan was born 29 April 1905 and was appointed with
the first contingent in 1951. He visited the Summer School from 21-
28 August 1978. It was announced in the Feastletter of June 1978,
but was never reported in New Day, the next issue of which
appeared in September 1979.

Rúhíyyih Khánum was born 8 August 1910 and was
appointed individually on 26 March 1952. She visited for the week
10-17 September 1978, which is described in detail in New Day of

September 1979. On Sunday 10 September, she spoke to Bahá’ís in
Carrickfergus Town Hall in Northern Ireland, also giving some
news interviews and attended a reception. Then she headed south
and spoke to Bahá’ís, who travelled from all over, at the Derryvale
Hotel in Dundalk, Co. Louth on 12 September.

Then in the evening of 15 September, she spoke at the largest
public meeting for some time, on the general subject of the Bahá’í
Faith, in the Royal Hibernian Hotel in Dublin. (Her visit was the
first time the National Assembly decided to seek media coverage,
which was a historic policy change.) She had a number of such
interviews, including one in The Irish Independent and another in
RTÉ Radio’s ‘The Church in Action.’

On 16-17 September, there was a Conference at the Player
Wills Theatre in Dublin, the largest venue up to that point for a
Bahá’í Conference in Ireland, where she gave three long sessions
including a frank question and answer session.

There are a number of other possible visits by other Hands of
the Cause. There are records in the archives files of preparations
for a visit by Dorothy Baker in 1947. This would have been before
her appointment as a Hand of the Cause with the first contingent
in 1951. However, the only evidence that she did in fact visit was
her own CV prepared for the National Assembly of the United
States in which ‘Eire’ appears on her list of countries visited.

Also, there is record of preparations for a visit by Enoch
Olinga. The Bahá’í Journal of May 1972 says: ‘Mr. Enoch Olinga will
be spending nearly 3 weeks with us and will be able to visit a
number of centres in England, Scotland and the Republic of
Ireland.’ However, there is scant reference to the trip afterwards,
with no details of itinerary and no mention anywhere else that he
was ever here.

Conclusion
This is a very basic outline of all the visits of Hands of the Cause
to the island of Ireland that I have been able to document in a
short space. There may be others, and there is a slight possibility
that some of these did not actually happen. In all, out of 32
appointed during their lifetimes, 17 visited (or lived) in Ireland
and they paid a total of 39 separate visits (not including George
Townshend) between the years 1952 and 1986. This paper, it is

hoped, is a beginning toward more fully describing and evaluating
their activities and influence in Ireland.
