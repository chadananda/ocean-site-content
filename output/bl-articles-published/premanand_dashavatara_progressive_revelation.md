> **Abstract:**  
>   
> In this thesis, the phenomenon of the Divine Revelation from Hindu and from the Bahá'í points of view is studied in the background of the Religion as an eternal process. The Hindu concept of Ten Mahavatars, called Dashavataras, is mentioned and their mythological, spiritual, and evidently logical import is taken into consideration. Sri Krishna represents Hindu Faith of Dashavatara as a representative Avatara and Bahá'u'lláh, the Bahá'í revelation. The interpreted substance and the logical reasoning of the concept of God, the nature of man and his abilities and limits of knowing God through the recognition of Avatara are analyzed based on Bhagavad–Gita and the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh.

> All through the thesis, naturally informed personal metaphysical comments through the Words of Sri Krishna and Bahá'u'lláh are added thereby giving a meaningful outcome at successive stage of the thesis. Concept of Progressive Revelation according to the Bahá'í Faith is also clarified and a synthesis of succeeding revelations of Dashavatara in Hinduism and Progressive Revelation of the Bahá'í Faith is made. All through, the Writings from Hindu scriptures like Bhagavad–Gita, Patanjali Sutra and Upanishads and similarly from Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, Kitab–e–Iqán and other Bahá'í scriptures are also quoted extensively in order to provide an authentic comparative base to the ideas presented.

In the words of Bahá'u'lláh “… the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future” and the Hindu term “Sanatana Dharma, the Eternal Law”, inspiring to study and compare the Hindu and the Bahá'í conception of Revelation, which are found to be strikingly similar.

Emphasis is made on the unity and commonality of the phenomena of Hindu and the Bahá'í Revelations rather than the differences thereof. This harmonious unity of divine revelations which, to the author, is the concluding reality of all divine revelations viewed in human benefit from their teachings of spiritual and personal nature rather than from their social teachings. Because humanity can survive only in unity and cooperation, and it is the emphasis on the commonalities and not on the subordinate differences which gives rise to the feeling of oneness and harmony among diverse people, so to preserve and protect the future of mankind.

Dashavatara and Progressive Revelation
A Comparative Study of Hinduism and the Bahá’í

Faith

Anupam Premanand

There is a unique commonality of the Eternal nature of
Religion as the foundational principle of both the Hinduism
and the Bahá’í Faith which is to say the ‘Sanatana Dharma’1 and
‘the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the
future’ respectively. Thus it’s no hazard that the Hindus are so
receptive to the Message of the Bahá’í Faith.

Dashavatara are a series of ten most prominent Avatars or
the Manifestations of God of Hinduism in Indian sub-
continent.

This study is concerned with the correspondence of
Dashavatara and the concept of Progressive Revelation from
the Bahá’í Teachings. Both Hinduism in its practices and the
Bahá’í Faith in its unifying expressions encourage within it a
great diversity of life styles and aspirations contributing richly
to the ennobling and advancement of the civilization.

In this thesis, Dashavatara is represented by Sri Krishna and
His Words principally through Bhagavad-Gita as the most
representative source of teachings of Hinduism. Progressive
Revelation is represented principally through the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

The concept of God in Hinduism and the Bahá’í Faith

God is the objective of knowledge and devotion in the Bahá’í
Faith and Hinduism. Bahá’u’lláh in His revealed daily prayer
states:

> I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me
> to know Thee and to worship Thee.3
Sri Krishana in Bhagavad-Gita states:

> And whoso thus discerneth Me in all, and all in Me, I
> never let him go … because he knows and worships Me
> …4
Looking at the nature of God expressed in both Hindu and
the Bahá’í literature, Arjuna in Bhagavad-Gita addressing the
Absolute Divine Reality of Sri Krishna declares:

> Thou art Parabrahma! The High Abode! The Great
> Purification! Thou art God Eternal, All-creating, Holy,
> First, Without beginning! … neither gods nor men Nor
> demons comprehend Thy mystery Made manifest,
> Divinest! Thou Thyself Thyself alone dost know, Maker
> Supreme! Master of all the living! Lord of Gods! King
> of the Universe!5
And as stated by Bahá’u’lláh:

> …no tongue, however deep its wisdom, can befittingly
> magnify Thy name, nor can the bird of the human
> heart, however great its longing, ever hope to ascend
> into the heaven of Thy majesty and knowledge.6
226                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

Arjuna declaring his helplessness in knowing the Divine Reality
wonders:

> How shall I learn, Supremest Mystery! To know Thee,
> though I muse continually?7
And Bahá’u’lláh states:

> He is, and hath ever been, veiled in the ancient eternity
> of His Essence, and will remain in His Reality
> everlastingly hidden from the sight of men.8
Arjuna continues his wonderment stating:

> Under what form of Thine unnumbered forms Mayst
> Thou be grasped?9
And Bahá’u’lláh states:

> Far be it from His glory that human tongue should
> adequately recount His praise, or that human heart
> comprehend His fathomless mystery.10
Thus, we can make out that the Hindu and the Bahá’í view of
God is one and the same, indicating both of them having
emanated from a Same Source, and as attested by Sri Krishna
and Bahá’u’lláh, the God is the Source thereof.

But one needs to be convinced of the existence of God in
order to believe firmly of the process of the Revelations.. which
is, in my understanding is a bottom up approach, the only
feasible possibility of the belief and knowing God, it’s not the
top down approach. We find the signs of God in the created
things and find the greatest amplification of those signs in the
Manifestations of God and so through His teachings believe in
the existence of a Supreme One Who is the Source of the
Revelations.

But as per ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, for intuitive people there is no need
of a rational proof or the arguments of the existence of God
which is necessary sometimes in order to clarify the conception
of God at human intellectual level.

The Foundation and the Center of progressive revelation is
the God. It is God Who is revealed progressively in order that

Dashavatara and Progressive Revelation                          227

human can know Him. All things in a Faith revolves around the
concept of the God. But how approachable is the God?
Bahá’u’lláh states that God is immensely exalted above any
possible human conception and would remain so. Humans
can’t know Him but He is aware of everything. As said earlier
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that God, the Creator can essentially know the
created and not vice-versa.

The Nature of Man in the Bahá’í Faith and Hinduism

The Revelation pertaining to human beings has to be
according to its nature and concomitant need. Thus in order
to investigate the Revelation from God, it is worthwhile to
investigate human nature attuned to which the Divine
Revelation is revealed in its objective evolutionary education.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states in Paris Talks:

> In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher
> nature and his material or lower nature. In one he
> approaches God, in the other he lives for the world
> alone…. If a man's Divine nature dominates his human
> nature, we have a saint… But if, on the contrary, he
> rejects the things of God and allows his evil passions to
> conquer him, then he is no better than a mere animal.”
> And it is the precise function of the Manifestations of
> God to encourage and evolve the Divine nature in
> human being. 11
In Bhagavad-Gita, all beings, creatures, things, humans and
human tendencies whether noble or wretched have arisen from
God. Comprehending the “truth of truths” is to understand the
‘mystic Majesty of God’ which in the Words of Bahá’u’lláh is
“…that the Seal the Kingdom is God’s may be stamped upon the
brow of all its people”12. It means, in my understanding, that
the people of the world need to understand and realize that
everything is under God’s power and His Rule. In other words,
to realize the ‘mystic Majesty of God’ as stated by Sri Krishna:

> Whatever Natures be to mortal men distributed, those
> natures spring from Me! Intellect, skill, enlightenment,
> endurance, self-control, truthfulness, equability, and
228                                        Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

> grief or joy of soul, and birth and death, and
> fearfulness, and fearlessness, and shame, and honour,
> and sweet harmlessness, and peace which is the same
> whate'er befalls, and mirth, and tears, and piety and
> thrift, and wish to give, and will to help,- all cometh of
> My gift! The Seven Chief Saints13, the Elders Four, the
> Lordly Manus14 set- Sharing My work- to rule the
> worlds, these too did I beget; And Rishis, Pitris,
> Manus, all, by one thought of My mind; Thence did
> arise, to fill this world, the races of mankind;
> Wherefrom who comprehends My Reign of mystic
> Majesty — That truth of truths — is thenceforth linked
> in faultless faith to Me:15
Again Sri Krishna states:

> Sattwan, Rajas, and Tamas, so are named the qualities
> of    Nature,     “Soothfastness,” “Passion,”    and
> “Ignorance.” These three bind down The changeless
> Spirit in the changeful flesh.16
Thus, Satva and Tamas, in agreement to the Bahá’í teachings,
are the divine and animal nature of human beings respectively.
It is the Rajas, the passions, the emotions which bind them to
whatever they are focused upon whether they be noble things or
lower things thus giving rise to happiness or unhappiness as a
consequence of their attachment.

The nature of Soul

Man, the human, has a soul which is unknowable and
indestructible. Humans have two tendencies: to incline
towards the base and to rise upwards the lofty. Age to age this
lift towards lofty is slowed and humans start to fall again.
Then there comes another Force which empowers him in lifting
himself towards the greater heights of knowledge and
civilization. This is the view of the human nature according to
Hindu thought. Soul in Bhagavad-Gita is indestructible and
continues after human’s physical death. The destined
condition of the soul after death depends upon the merit of
one’s deeds before on this earth. Thus here, the Bahá’í Faith and
Hinduism match their view and understanding of the life after

Dashavatara and Progressive Revelation                           229

death. This is to be so since in both of them religion is eternal
and the same truth spoken differently through different sages
and prophets again and again in differing conditions of
society progressively.

On deathless continuity of Spirit and physical death being
just a change of condition, Lord Krishna states:

> …when one layeth His worn-out robes away, and,
> taking new ones, sayeth, “These will I wear to-day!” So
> putteth by the spirit Lightly its garb of flesh, and
> passeth to inherit a residence afresh.17
Some of the qualities of the soul as stated by Sri Krishna:

> I say to thee weapons reach not the Life; Flame burns it
> not, waters cannot o'erwhelm, nor dry winds wither it.
> Impenetrable, unentered, unassailed, unharmed,
> untouched, Immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,
> Invisible,    ineffable,  by    word      and     thought
> uncompassed, ever all itself, Thus is the Soul declared!18
Thus in other words understandably, physical bodies do not
last for ever. After a span of few years, physical bodies
disintegrate and the soul associated with this physical body
passes to the New World and gets possessed of “new bodies”.
This is not to say that it’s the physical reincarnation19 but a
new form of existence for the soul, a new condition by which
the soul stays in the higher realm and continues to live in an
higher plane of existence and performs the function it is
assigned. This new condition is a condition of indescribable
joy which is an inherent outcome of this existence of higher
understanding and consciousness. Here too there is a function
as on the earth that the soul is subject to. Bahá’u’lláh states this
function and the condition in which this function can be
assigned to a soul.

> Know thou, of a truth, that if the soul of man hath
> walked in the ways of God, it will, assuredly, return
> and be gathered to the glory of the Beloved. By the
> righteousness of God! It shall attain a station such as
> no pen can depict, or tongue describe. The soul that
> hath remained faithful to the Cause of God, and stood
> unwaveringly firm in His Path shall, after his
230                                        Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

> ascension, be possessed of such power that all the
> worlds which the Almighty hath created can benefit
> through him. 20
Soul is made of elements which are not physical. If it would
be physical it would be manifesting physical properties of
being touched, being disintegrable, visible or measurable. But
since it has none of these properties, it is not earthly. It is
untouched, stable and eternal, and cannot be measured by
thoughts and words. Same ideas of Invisible, ineffable, by
word and thought uncompassed, ever all itself, Thus is the Soul
declared! are expressed by Bahá’u’lláh some five thousand years
later establishing the essential oneness of the revealed Word of
Avataras or the Manifestations of God, saying..

> Know, verily, that the soul is a sign of God, a heavenly
> gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed
> to grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute,
> can ever hope to unravel. It is the first among all
> created things to declare the excellence of its Creator,
> the first to recognize His glory, to cleave to His truth,
> and to bow down in adoration before Him. 21
Soul being the sign of God, all its declarations about himself
are in reality the declarations of the excellence of its Creator.
In words of Sri Krishna the soul declared its attributes and in
the writings of Bahá’u’lláh this declaration is accomplished
with its objective in declaring the ‘excellence of its Creator’.

Soul is that pristine entity which proclaims in loudest terms
the existence of God, reveals His attributes and manifests the
sublime nature of His creation. But as Bahá’u’lláh, according
to Himself, is the most recent of Avatara or Manifestations of
God, He has brought an added spiritual knowledge according
to the forthcoming maturity of humans today. But, are people
mature enough to understand the nature of the Soul? Has
Bahá’u’lláh, therefore, revealed in full measure the nature of
soul and its condition after physical death of human? And
again as stated by Bahá’u’lláh:

> Verily I say, the human soul is, in its essence, one of the
> signs of God, a mystery among His mysteries. It is one
> of the mighty signs of the Almighty, the harbinger that

> proclaimeth the reality of all the worlds of God. Within
> it lieth concealed that which the world is now utterly
> incapable of apprehending…. 22
Then He continues stating…

> Verily I say, the human soul is exalted above all egress
> and regress. It is still, and yet it soareth; it moveth, and
> yet it is still. It is, in itself, a testimony that beareth
> witness to the existence of a world that is contingent,
> as well as to the reality of a world that hath neither
> beginning nor end. 23
Soul declares the contingency of earthly realm but at the
same time demonstrates through its attributes the reality of an
absolute existence: a world that has neither beginning nor end.
Each human is a soul and possesses a body and according to
both the Hindu and the Bahá’í beliefs, the condition of the soul
after physical death depends upon the human actions before on
this earthly plane. But as different humans have got different
states of existence on earth, there is going to be differing states
of soul’s existence after. And if it’s so, then after the physical
death do souls enter an absolute realm? Stating on this crucial
theme, Bahá’u’lláh says:

> When the soul attaineth the Presence of God, it will
> assume the form that best befitteth its immortality and
> is worthy of its celestial habitation. Such an existence
> is a contingent and not an absolute existence,
> inasmuch as the former is preceded by a cause, whilst
> the latter is independent thereof. Absolute existence is
> strictly confined to God, exalted be His glory. Well is
> it with them that apprehend this truth.24
This also clarifies what Bahá’u’lláh says it will assume the
form that best befitteth its immortality and is worthy of its
celestial habitation; what Sri Krishna says that So putteth by
the spirit Lightly its garb of flesh, and passeth to inherit a
residence afresh.

Thus, the Celestial habitation has a form.. as the spirit
putteth its garb of flesh, and passesth to inherit a residence
afresh.

Thus absolute existence is not for the soul and its journey
towards God, but only for God.

And the form which the soul takes after the physical death
depends upon its condition on this earth before the physical
death, thus is preceded by a cause and so it is not an absolute
existence. And on the theme of assuming of form, exactly same
idea and concept of the condition and forms the soul attains
after its separation of body is narrated by Lord Krishna
revealing…

> …And, at the hour of death, he that hath meditated Me
> alone, in putting off his flesh, comes forth to Me,
> enters into My Being- doubt thou not! But, if he
> meditated otherwise at hour of death, in putting off
> the flesh, he goes to what he looked for, Kunti's Son!25

Because the Soul is fashioned to its like.26

Sri Krishna states: the Soul is fashioned to its like. And
Bahá’u’lláh states: “it will assume the form that best befitteth
its immortality and is worthy of its celestial habitation.”

Dashavatara

The term Dashavatara is made of two words Dash and
Avatara. In Sanskrit, Dash signifies the numerical value of ten,
and Avatara, a noun from infinitive Avataran, meaning the
one who descents i.e. the descent of Divinity. Thus the term
Dashavatara, the ten divine descents, are generally referred in
Hinduism as the descent of Vishnu. Vishnu descends in ten (or
more) different forms for the maintenance of the Universe i.e.
the protection of virtuous and destruction of the evil; thus
establishing the realm of Dharma i.e. righteousness. This group
of sequential descents of the divinity, each descent having a
different form as conceptualized in Hinduism is known as
Avatara.
The Blessed Lord 27 said…

> Yadhaa yadhaa      hi   Dharmasya    Glaanir     bhavathi
> Bhaaratha/

> Abhyuthaanam          Adharmasya     Tad   Aatmaanam
> srujaamyaham//
> Paritranaaya        Saadhoonaam      Vinaasaaya    cha
> Dushkritaam/
> Dharma Samsthapanaarthaayaya Sambhavami yugE
> yugE//
Meaning…

> When Righteousness declines, O Bharata!28 when
> wickedness is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take
> visible shape, and move a man with men, succouring
> the good, thrusting the evil back, And setting Virtue
> on her seat again. 29
This verse from Bhagavad-Gita emphatically states the fact
that from age to age God manifests Himself. These are the
Words of Sri Krishna stating the inevitable rise of the Avatara
in every age. Dashavatara are the ten Manifestations of Vishnu.
They are the most important manifestations of these Avataras.
The list of ten Avataras is found in Garuda Purana. There are
other lists like that of 25 Avataras of Bhagavat Purana, but
these 10 Dashavatara are most famous and are the greatest
Avataras who had the maximum influence. Out of the 10, the 9
Avataras so far are:

> o Matsya (fish)
> o Kurma (tortoise)
> o Varaha (boar)
> o Narasimha (half-man, half-lion)
> o Vamana (dwarf man)
> o Parashurama (Rama with an axe)
> o Rama (the embodiment of Righteousness)
> o Krishna (the supreme Teacher)
> o Gautama Buddha (the enlightened One)…respectively.

And …

o Kalki (time, the Eternal or the destroyer of foulness,

quarrel)
As per the common Hindu thought, the tenth Avatara Kalki is
yet to manifest Himself.

Dashavatara, the ten Avataras of Lord Vishnu, are meant for
establishing ‘Dharma’30, whenever ‘adharma’31 occurs. The
scientific facts behind Dashavatara are now under research, as
it seems that these ten Avataras represent the evolution of
mankind.

Counseling a wise man to meditate upon, Garuda Purana32

mentions the ten Avataras in the context of treatment of a sick
person by the relatives:

> Relatives, coming near the diseased, should not mourn.
> My holy name should be remembered and meditated
> upon repeatedly. The Fish, the Tortoise, the Boar, the
> Man-lion, the Dwarf, Paraśurâma, Râma, Krishna,
> Buddha, and also Kalkî33. These ten names should
> always be meditated upon by the wise. Those who recite
> them near the diseased are called relatives.34
Dashavatara explains and elaborates the Hindu Avataras and
gives the sense of evolutionary stages of humanity in which
each of the Avataras have a form in conformity to that stage of
mankind’s physical, intellectual and spiritual condition.

4 Yuga35 and Avataras in each one of these Yugas:

The following are the 10 principle Avataras of Lord Vishnu in 4

Yugas:

o 4 Avataras in Krita Yuga (Matsya, Kurma, Varaha

and Narasimha)
o 3 Avataras in Treta Yuga (Vamana, Parasurama and

Sri Rama)
> o 2 Avataras in Dwaapara Yuga (Krishna and Buddha)
> o 1 Avatara in Kali Yuga (the Kalki, yet to be)

To rephrase, these are the Dashavatara who in my opinion
represent the continuum of human evolution on the planet.
They represent the manifestation of the monotheistic God on
earth among people from age to age. Thus Hinduism is
essentially a monotheism recognizing the Supremacy of
Brahman, the Eternal and all the gods and beings and everything
else is lower to that. And these Ten are the most prominent
representative ones out of the innumerable one which are sent
as the divine educators of humanity from the time immemorial.
The several mythological stories and anecdotes are later
additions and it’s but an effort to conceptualize their presence
to the then masses on Indian Sub-Continent. Even though
Avataras would be innumerable, these ten representatives, the
most prominent ones, the never ending eternal process of the
descent of divinity shall continue as it has been so. This is seen
by the Avatara coming among the humanity as ‘one among
themselves’, their physical form and characteristics represent
the physical form and the characteristics of then humanity in
general. Since they are the self same Spirit and not the body.
(That’s perhaps one of the reasons why as Bahá’ís we don’t
portray the physical form of a Manifestation.) And as most
evident in evolutionary science which says that the human life
began most probably in the sea as that of the Fish leading to
amphibian life as that of a Tortoise or Turtle thereby to the life
of the land, then being a mammal as that of the Wild Boar
evolving into an Animal Man as that of The Lion Man, half
man and half animal. This then leading to the early man of
short stature The Dwarf and then to the savage man of Rama
with Axe further leading to the complete man being the Rama
with a Bow thereby again manifesting as a sophisticated
supreme Teacher in form of Krishna evolving into the gentle
and compassionate enlightened souls that of Buddha which
seems to complete one cycle of human evolution finally leading
to the Kalki. Thus we see that all of these Avataras were always
sent in their form conducive to the state of mankind then,
which in an approximation represents the state of mankind
then under evolution which is further prophesized ending with
Kalki ushering an era of peace and righteousness.

The Progressive Revelation

Progressive Revelation means the nature of God being
progressively revealed to humanity so that humanity as
individuals and as a whole is able gradually to identify itself
with that Great Divine Being. And this identification happens
by the example of the Manifestation of God. Bahá’u’lláh says:

> O Salman! The door of the knowledge of the Ancient
> Being hath ever been, and will continue for ever to be,
> closed in the face of men. No man's understanding shall
> ever gain access unto His holy court. As a token of His
> mercy, however, and as a proof of His loving-kindness,
> He hath manifested unto men the Day Stars of His
> divine guidance, the Symbols of His divine unity, and
> hath ordained the knowledge of these sanctified Beings
> to be identical with the knowledge of His own Self.
> Whoso recognizeth them hath recognized God. Whoso
> hearkeneth to their call, hath hearkened to the Voice of
> God, and whoso testifieth to the truth of their
> Revelation, hath testified to the truth of God Himself.
> Whoso turneth away from them, hath turned away
> from God, and whoso disbelieveth in them, hath
> disbelieved in God. Every one of them is the Way of
> God that connecteth this world with the realms above,
> and the Standard of His Truth unto every one in the
> kingdoms of earth and heaven. They are the
> Manifestations of God amidst men, the evidences of
> His Truth, and the signs of His glory.36
> He Who is everlastingly hidden from the eyes of men
> can never be known except through His Manifestation,
> and His Manifestation can adduce no greater proof of
> the truth of His Mission than the proof of His own
> Person. 37
> They only differ in the intensity of their revelation, and
> the comparative potency of their light. Even as He hath
> revealed: “Some of the Apostles We have caused to excel
> the others.”38

> Know of a certainty that in every Dispensation the
> light of Divine Revelation hath been vouchsafed unto
> men in direct proportion to their spiritual capacity.39
The seeming difference in the Divine Message and customs,
traditions often leads to gradations of the different prophets
and ranking of their Message by the adherents of the respective
religions thinking their Faith to be superior or better
Revelation of Truth than the other. And also that the revelation
of these Manifestations differ because they are sent for people
of differing capacities adapted to differing conditions. Upon
this, Bahá’u’lláh states:

> That a certain attribute of God hath not been
> outwardly manifested by these Essences of Detachment
> doth in no wise imply that they who are the Day Springs
> of God's attributes and the Treasuries of His holy
> names did not actually possess it. Therefore, these
> illuminated Souls, these beauteous Countenances have,
> each and every one of them, been endowed with all the
> attributes of God, such as sovereignty, dominion, and
> the like, even though to outward seeming they be shorn
> of all earthly majesty....40
So, there is no point in considering one Manifestation being
superior in worldly terms to others, because as per Bahá’u’lláh
each one of Them are endowed with all the attributes of God
whether manifest or not.

Often the people of various religions do not actively
anticipate a new divine educator amongst themselves and they
say that their prophet or the Messenger of God of their parents
and forefathers is the final one and that there is no Revelation
after theirs. The Bahá’í Faith claims that the Revelations are a
seamless everlasting process and would continue to be in the
form of new revelations for the education of mankind. Upon
this, Bahá’u’lláh states:

> Thou art surely aware of their idle contention, that all
> Revelation is ended, that the portals of Divine mercy
> are closed, that from the day springs of eternal holiness
> no Sun shall rise again, that the Ocean of everlasting
> bounty is forever stilled, and that out of the

> Tabernacle of ancient glory the Messengers of God have
> ceased to be made manifest.41

This seems true within the dispensation of a Manifestation but
also for the whole Eternal Progression of the Revelation
indicating:

> In like manner, if the Sun of Truth were suddenly to
> reveal, at the earliest stages of its manifestation, the
> full measure of the potencies which the providence of
> the Almighty hath bestowed upon it, the earth of
> human understanding would waste away and be
> consumed; for men's hearts would neither sustain the
> intensity of its revelation, nor be able to mirror forth
> the radiance of its light.42
But Prophets of God have always been sent in all times,
places and under all conditions, perhaps even to the worlds
unknown to us perhaps in distant parts of the universe, the
spiritual worlds including those after human physical life and
many more. Here Bahá’u’lláh states:

> Through His potency the Trees of Divine Revelation
> have yielded their fruits, every one of which hath been
> sent down in the form of a Prophet, bearing a Message
> to God's creatures in each of the worlds whose number
> God, alone, in His all-encompassing Knowledge, can
> reckon. 43

Synthesis of Dashavatara and the Progressive
Revelation

In Bhagavad-Gita, in spite of several teachings and counsels,
Arjuna is reluctant to go to the war for justice and is not able
to recognize the Lordship of Sri Krishna. Then as a final resort,
Lord Krishna shows His Viraat Vishwaswarupa Darshan (the
Great Magnificent Universal Form)44 to Arjuna. Thereupon
being shaken from His core, Arjuna recognizes the Truth of
God and thus requests Sri Krishna to come back to His
ordinary human form since the Great Magnificent Universal
Form is difficult to bear. (Such stories narrated from the life

stories of many of the Manifestation including that of Sri
Krishna and Bahá’u’lláh .)

For not being able to bear longer than a few moments,
Arjuna states:

> In gentleness on me!
> Good is it I did see
> This unknown marvel of Thy Form! But fear
> Mingles with joy! Retake,
> Dear Lord! for pity's sake
> Thine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear!

> Be merciful, and show
> The visage that I know;
> Let me regard Thee, as of yore, arrayed
> With disc and forehead-gem,45
> With mace and anadem46,
> Thou that sustainest all things! Undismayed

> Let me once more behold
> The form I loved of old,
> Thou of the thousand arms and countless eyes!
> This frightened heart is fain
> To see restored again
> My Charioteer, in Krishna's kind disguise.47

Each one of this Dashavataras have been made to come down
on earth in the form that the people could bear and which
would resemble the known form existing among them. Going
further perhaps in speculation that thus possibly during the
time when man was mostly an inhabitant of jungle and forests
in prehistoric savage form, the form of Parashuram (Rama with
Axe) came forth. Even perhaps when man was in the physical
form of a sea creature that an Avatara had come to teach them
something in onward way of progress. So, during the

thousands of years from now, we would not have been able to
imagine that state and so stories and mythologies with
contemporary contexts have been build around the Matsya
Avatara of Vishnu, around Kurma Avatara (the Turtle),
around Varaha Avatara (the Wild Boar) and so on. Even the
companions of Rama Avatara, who were said to be the
monkeys, in the war with Ravana, could be another species of
humans perhaps like Neanderthals and who later got extinct,
and they are described as gentle monkeys. Or they would just be
another group of humans unknown to the former and are not
termed humans, even though just a few centuries ago that dark
skinned from Africa were not considered human by some white
skinned colonial rulers and slave traders. Or it could be other
human group with somewhat different physical features. For
scientists have put forward the theories of coming together of
Homo Sapiens and the other species of humans not very long
ago. But coming back to our discussion, Bahá’u’lláh states that
the Prophets and the Messengers of God have come to humanity
from its inception. That man exists from his origin and
foundation as man, and that his species has existed from all
eternity... 48 perhaps even before the existence of the earth.

And what was the objective of the coming of these ‘Day
Springs of eternal holiness’ and how mankind has benefited
from their appearance, and what have we learnt since they have
come to us from the very beginning of existence?

Bahá’u’lláh states one vital role of the Manifestations of
God in educating humans:

> For were it not for those effulgent Lights that shine
> above the horizon of His Essence, the people would
> know not their left hand from their right, how much
> less could they scale the heights of the inner realities or
> probe the depths of their subtleties!49
In Hindu line of Avataras, there itself is the progressive
revelation. For each of these Avatara has come bringing an
additional necessity from that which was the past. Providing
the necessary spiritual nourishment and its social application
in the form of laws and practices according to the needs of the
time they manifest. Most Hindus believe in Krishna but they
do also in Rama. For they know inherently that it is the same

Message with two versions. Rama taught the obedience in spite
of prevailing injustice. And in seeming opposition, Krishna
taught to fight for justice in spite of seeming disobedience.
And this verifying and in conformity with the teaching of
Bahá’í Faith that each Manifestation of God of the age reveals
the teachings in conformity with that age and since situations
and times change, these laws are either abrogated or new ones
are created by Him.
As repeated by Bahá’u’lláh:

> Were He to decree as lawful the thing which from time
> immemorial had been forbidden, and forbid that which
> had, at all times, been regarded as lawful, to none is
> given the right to question His authority. 50
The theme of repeated timeless coming of the Avatara is also
pronounced in Hinduism. Evidently in Bhagavad-Gita when Sri
Krishna having said that He is unborn and taught the
knowledge of Yoga, the Union with the Divine, to Vivaswata,
the son of the Sun god, who preceded time itself till present,
perplexed Arjuna asks:

> Thy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days. And
> bright Vivaswata's preceded time! How shall I
> comprehend this thing thou sayest, “From the
> beginning it was I who taught?51
Thereupon Sri Krishna makes the reply as an Eternal
Manifestation of God, the Sanatana Avatara comparable to
defining Progressive Revelation saying:

> Manifold the renewals of my birth have been, Arjuna!
> and of thy births, too! But mine I know, and thine thou
> knowest not, O Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be Unborn,
> undying, indestructible, the Lord of all things living;
> not the less- by Maya, by my magic which I stamp on
> floating Nature-forms, the primal vast- I come, and go,
> and come. When Righteousness Declines, O Bharata!
> when wickedness is strong, I rise, from age to age, and
> take visible shape, and move a man with men,
> Succouring the good, thrusting the evil back, And
> setting Virtue on her seat again.52

As mentioned before by Bahá’u’lláh, many of the memories
and records of the earlier Manifestations of God are lost in the
dust of time and as repeated by Sri Krishna saying:

> Manifold the renewals of my birth have been, Arjuna!
> and of thy births, too! But mine I know, and thine thou
> knowest not.
And also that the process of coming and going of the
Avatara is eternal. Whenever there is a spiritual decadence in
the world and the loss of moral and ethics, that the spirit of
God is born in the form of an Avatara to guide humanity on
the path of righteousness. But how often it happens that the
people who have sought the coming of the Avatara have
themselves turned against Him when He comes fulfilling the
prophecies and anticipation in order to reestablish the reign of
Virtue. Bahá’u’lláh states:

> Behold, how the divers peoples and kindreds of the
> earth have been waiting for the coming of the Promised
> One. No sooner had He, Who is the Sun of Truth, been
> made manifest, than, lo, all turned away from Him,
> except them whom God was pleased to guide… That
> hour is now come. The world is illumined with the
> effulgent glory of His countenance. And yet, behold
> how far its peoples have strayed from His path! None
> have believed in Him except them who, through the
> power of the Lord of Names, have shattered the idols of
> their vain imaginings and corrupt desires and entered
> the city of certitude. 53
As repeated by Sri Krishna:

> The minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;-
> naught see they of My secret Presence, nought of My
> hid Nature, ruling all which lives. vain hopes pursuing,
> vain deeds doing; fed on vainest knowledge, senselessly
> they seek an evil way, the way of brutes and fiends. But
> My Mahatmas, those of noble soul who tread the path
> celestial, worship Me with hearts unwandering,-
> knowing Me the Source, the Eternal Source, of Life.54
The Avatara has a dual nature as visible from the above
quote from the Bhagavad-Gita, one is Divine which is one with

God and the other is the human which is like anybody else. That
is the reason why Sri Krishna says that people mistake Him to
be only a human being and do not recognize His Divine Nature.
Adib Taherzadeh in Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, volume 1 p. 58,
speaks that in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh there are many
statements concerning the dual station of the Manifestations
of God and His Chosen Ones. In relation to God, these Holy
Souls appear as utter nothingness, but in relation to the world
of creation They are endowed with all the attributes of God
and are closely identified with Him. As Bahá’u’lláh has stated
in one of His prayers:

> When I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that
> bindeth me to Thee, I am moved to proclaim to all
> created things 'verily I am God!'; and when I consider
> my own self, lo, I find it coarser than clay!55
Similar statements have also been made in Islam. The
following tradition attributed to Prophet Muhammad clearly
indicates the dual nature of the Messengers of God.

> Manifold are Our relationships with God. At one time,
> We are He Himself, and He is We Ourself. At another
> He is that He is, and We are that We are.56
Thus, we are able to understand the universal nature of
Divine Unity in which all the Avataras or the Manifestations of
God from different religions have a dual nature. This proves
the inner essential unity and oneness of different religions and
they having come from the same Source speaking of the same
Knowledge. This is evident from the above examples of Sri
Krishna, Prophet Mohammad and Bahá’u’lláh.

But this dual nature is the cause of much confusion and
difficulty among the followers and also the outsiders of a
particular religion. The followers mainly take only the divine
form of their Avatara and while outsiders take mostly the
human form, of the Avatara of the other religion. This is one of
the fundamental reasons while they do not respect the
Manifestation of God from the other religions as much as their
own. And they give a lower rank to the Manifestations of God
from other religions whereas often they go to the height of
fanaticism for their own Avatara by replacing Him with God

Himself. An example in trinity57 in Christianity and who do
not believe in divine reality of Mohammad.

Every Manifestation of God validates and confirms the
truth of the earlier Manifestation. Even as Moses had
confirmed Abraham, Jesus had confirmed and validated the
truth of Moses and His laws and Mohammad Jesus. This is one
of the proofs in the Holy Books on the validity and truth of
each new coming Manifestation of God that He shall confirm
and validate the truth of the earlier One. Thus confirming the
soundness of history.

Even as Bahá’u’lláh confirms the truth of Mohammad
stating:

> Behold how the sovereignty of Muhammad, the
> Messenger of God, is today apparent and manifest
> amongst the people. 58
Sri Krishna in Bhagavad-Gita has confirmed Rama Avatara
while speaking in the voice of God comparing Himself to be the
Best and Center of all things in the universe. Among things and
beings of the world, Sri Krishna says,

> Time's self I am; of woodland-beasts — buffaloes,
> deers, and bears — the lordly-painted tiger; of birds the
> vast Garud, the whirlwind 'mid the winds; ‘mid chiefs
> Rama with blood imbrued, Makar 'mid fishes of the
> sea, and Ganges 'mid the streams; Yea! First, and Last,
> and Centre of all which is or seems I am, Arjuna!
> Wisdom Supreme of what is wise, words on the
> uttering lips I am, and eyesight of the eyes. And “A” of
> written characters, Dwandwa 59 of knitted speech, and
> Endless Life, and boundless Love, whose power
> sustaineth each…60

Influence of Hindu and the Bahá’í Revelations

Hinduism is the third largest community of religion in the
world numbering almost a billion just after Christianity and
Islam. What has kept the Hindu people together in cherishing
the ideals of their common heritage in spite of consistent long
assaults of corrupt practices like casteism and maltreatment of

women like many great religions of the world. Hinduism has
not only influence on itself but on the wider world beyond the
religious and spiritual ideas. Ancient astronomy, chemistry,
medicine and especially mathematics show the indelible impact
of Hinduism. Discovery and creation of decimal system and
creative imagination of zero. From last three thousand years,
hundreds of millions of Hindus have turned themselves to the
healing spiritual message of epics like the Mahabharata, the
Ramayana, scriptures like Bhagavad-Gita, Vedas and
Upanishads. The philosophy of life and ideals present in these
Books have given rise to a culture which is still continuing from
its emergence of at least ten thousand years, which until now is
unparallel in the history of world civilizations. Yoga with its
similar ancient origin has its influence worldwide. Striving for
justice and abiding by one’s righteous duties in the face of
challenges of one’s passions and others’ opposition is an
eternal and universal Hindu principle of the foundation of
peaceful and enduring social order. It has been a regular life-
time habit of Indian masses to listen to and participate in the
singing of devotional and moral characters of Mahabharata,
Puranas, Ramayana and Bhagavad-Gita. Worship and altruism
were the paramount values of individual and community life
for thousands of years. This has given rise to spiritualizing of
hundreds of millions and its effect upon the whole world. In
spite of nearly two hundred years of western colonization, and
the present waves of technology, diverse and differing modes of
living, Hinduism is sustained in its vigour in giving a peaceful
order to the people of India who are emerging as world leaders
in modern technology and spiritual ways of life as Yoga.

The Bahá’í Faith in parallel even though being the most recent
Divine Revelation in the religious history, has its first impact
in Iranian society where it is conceived. It is the Bahá’ís who
have established the first school for the girls in conformity to
their teaching on the equality of man and woman, in Iran where
girls were not considered fit to attend schools and acquire
higher learning as the boys. Coming in majority from the
illiterate and farming and lower social classes, Bahá’ís had
established themselves as the most educated, progressive and
prosperous community in Iran owing to their adherence to
lofty spiritual guidance and values given by Bahá’u’lláh and
later by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House

of Justice, the international governing Council of the Bahá’ís.
Out of Iran in more than one hundred and eighty countries and
independent territories, Bahá’ís have established their national
communities and institutions. They are engaged in teaching the
pacifying and unifying teachings of the Bahá’í Faith and also
are doing disinterested service to the people world over through
humanitarian enterprises such as schools, non-governmental
organizations in addressing social issues like health, value
education, tribal development and other socio-economic
development actions. Bahá’í International Community has a
consultative status with United Nations and thus Bahá’í
teachings have their influence on world affairs. But first and
foremost is the transformation which some six million people
in the world have experienced and have dedicated their lives in
dissemination of the healing message of Bahá’u’lláh and selfless
and indiscriminate service to the human society. Thus while
thinking globally and acting locally, Bahá’ís are assisting in
bringing the immemorial vision of world unity in reality.

Conclusion

> When Righteousness declines, O Bharata! when
> wickedness is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take
> visible shape, and move a man with men, succouring
> the good, thrusting the evil back, And setting Virtue
> on her seat again. 61
The concept of God and His nature is defined identically in
the teachings of Sri Krishna from Hinduism and the Bahá’í
teachings. He is mentioned to be the Creator of everything that
exists and He Himself is uncreated and self-subsisting,
independent and unknowable. And that to let Himself be
known, He cannot come in His Essential Form to people
because people do not have the capacity to bear a full
Revelation of God, so it is giving little by little age after age
through each Avatara or the Manifestation. He sends His
chosen Avataras or Manifestations and gives them authority
and power from His own in order to educate people to
gradually recognize His true nature and go away from the man
made Vice and progress on the path of Virtue, thus, creating a
new greater civilization each time of His appearance as an

Avatara amidst the people. Thus this phenomenon justifies in
being called a Progressive Revelation. And this unchanging
purpose of divine revelation is aptly named Sanatana Dharma,
the Eternal Law.

Human nature, using a different language in Hinduism and
the Bahá’í Faith, is both spiritual and material.

The divine revelations are the successive stages in the Divine
Plan as mentioned in both Hindu and the Bahá’í scriptures for
greater recognition of God by humans. As seen in progressive
nature of Dashavatara, the message was heroic in case of
Matsya and Kurma and Varaha and Narasimha. Then Rama
and Krishna brought the teachings of an exemplary way of life.
Then it is Buddha who has brought the lessons of renunciation
and relieving sufferings thereby living an enlightened
unattached life. And it is Kalki who shall bring the union of
differing people of the planet thereby culminating a major
stage in the spiritualization of mankind.

This is the Indian line of Avataras and there are such lines in
all the continents and the regions of the world … which
converge today into one universal convergence and union into
the Universal Manifestation of the Glory of God, the
Bhargodevasya the Maitreya Amitabha and so on…

Each of the Avataras have brought humanity to a stage
further according to its contextual needs. And so each further
progress enhances the receiving capacity of people. And as
stated by Bahá’u’lláh, the divine revelations are revealed
according to the conditions and receiving capacity of
humanity at each successive stage of its evolution and
promoting an ever advancing civilization. This is clearly
evident in the phenomena of Dashavatara and amply justified
in the concept of Progressive Revelation.

The soul in both Hindu and the Bahá’í views is uncreated and
is eternal. But unlike certain interpretations of some groups of
Hinduism if not all, the concept of reincarnation is not found
in the Bahá’í teachings. But in the author’s point of view, the
soul having taken many forms as mentioned in Bhagavad-Gita
does not mean many earthly forms, but rather several celestial
forms or successive passing of the soul through different and

innumerable realms of God till eternity until it merges in union
with her Creator. In other words, as the life in the human
temple is the first stage of the life of the soul — as the child in
the womb of the mother — it has the journey which begins on
this earthly realm and there will be many other lives in the
spiritual worlds.

The other meaning of Lord Krishna having been born several
times and Arjuna too are the several successive revelations on
earth by Avataras wherein the self-same spirit of an Avatara
was present and self-same spirit of a sincere seeker, a devotee
was present too thereby embodying the same divine grace and
human receptivity at each stage of cosmic manifestation of
Avatara.

In the author’s finding, the spiritual message and even the
details of the spiritual teachings of Bahá’u’lláh and Sri Krishna,
for example the elements like the nature of man, concept of
God, the purpose of human life, nature of soul and many
others are similar to an astonishing degree. This leads the
author to conclude the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh and Sri Krishna
to be two different versions of the same Reality, the reality of
the same Religion of God, the same Revelation spoken in two
different times by two different Persons, however in two
different social, geographical and cultural context and perhaps
with two different scopes of application. This gave rise to two
different looks over the time to these Faiths, specially for
Hinduism. Any casual observer who observes mostly the social
form and cultural aspect shall find them different whereas a
careful study of scriptures may compel us to see it to be the
application of these two identical spiritual teachings spoken in
two different languages, in two different times, in two vastly
different human contexts and perhaps in two different
geographical scopes.

Teachings of Bhagavad-Gita was limited to Indian sub-
Continent for most of its life up to now fundamentally
perhaps since means of communication and transport were
limited up to very recent till a little over one and half century
ago. Bahá’í teachings spread internationally from its birth in
1844 and much more globally from last half a century perhaps
again owing to the improved means of communication and

transport in addition to it being an attractive, radiant and
pertinent divine Message as per the need of humanity today.
24th May 1844, the first day of the birth of the Bahá’í
dispensation is marked by the start of the communication
revolution of sending of first telegraphic message in the world
by Mr. Samuel F. B. Morse, the inventor of the telegraph from
Washington to Baltimore, a message chosen from the Bible,
from the Book of Numbers read: “What hath God wrought?”62

Thus, these two different scopes of expansion from the very
beginning of Hinduism and the Bahá’í Faith led to the social
applications which gave rise to two different external looks of
these Faiths whereas analyzing their spiritual teachings, its
adherents share a one common faith in the core of their
spiritual beliefs. Having said so, but for the Bahá’í Faith,
owing to its recent origin, a reasonable conclusive statement as
to its social form cannot be made since it is on its course of
speedy evolution and some more years need to pass with at least
a significantly comparable Bahá’í population to Hindus in
order to speak conclusively of any resultant crystallized
difference between the Bahá’í Faith and Hinduism in the social
aspect or cultural elements of its practice.

Hinduism was mainly adhered by a large number, almost a
billion, of Indians and Bahá’í Faith by a very small comparative
numbers of a few millions of scattered people but living
practically on every land of the Earth. Thus, over the time as a
larger number of people accept Bahá’í Faith, the social
reflection of its spiritual application would be more conclusive
and of course different from the Hindu social reflection, even
though spiritually or cosmically they may have identical form
which we find in Bhagavad-Gita and the spiritual teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh. Thus, these two identical teachings in two
different social applications would give rise to different social
forms due to the difference in worldly conditions of its
receiving people.

One of the reasons is also that Hinduism has an
ecclesiastical class whereas the Bahá’í Faith has an institutional
administration. Enormous differences as these in my opinion
would lead Hindu Faith and the Bahá’í Faith very different
socially even though both of them live in and share this present

technological world together. But keeping a clarity of vision
unclouded by these contextual differences the author, based on
the teachings of Bhagavad-Gita and Bahá’u’lláh, concludes these
two Faiths respectively to be spiritually identical but socially
different.

Dashavatara being the most core phenomenon of Hinduism
around which Sanatana Dharma is intertwined, a typical
expression of it is taken by the author in Bhagavad-Gita which
characterizes in clearest terms the elements of a revelation in
Hindu flow. Various writings of Bahá’u’lláh slightly
supplemented by some authoritative interpretive writings of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi are taken as full
representation of the Bahá’í revelation. Thus giving a balanced
comparative counterparts in both Hinduism and the Bahá’í
Faith. And then these two revelations in their spiritual and
social elements are compared.

Due to the fundamental position of Dashavatara within
Hinduism named as the Eternal Law or Sanatana Dharma,
future researchers may like to explore in depth each of the cases
of the Avataras and bring to light the scientific or logical
reasoning behind the allegorical narration of the Life story of
each of the Avataras. This may throw greater light upon the
phenomenon of Divine Revelation as the educational process of
mankind, its objective and tools.

Author has demonstrably discovered a remarkable
resemblance of the messages of Bhagavad-Gita and the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh. This then becomes a very promising field of
comparative study in different themes of the Words and
Writings of Sri Krishna and Bahá’u’lláh. Such a study would
help in finding out the nature of Their Revelations and the
nature of the audiences to which their respective revelations are
addressed and also noting the progression, when and if any, in
the themes of such messages.
