Art.    IX.?Catalogue    and Description of 27 Babi Manuscripts.

By   E. G. Browne,    M.A., M.R.A.S.1

To   my       second  paper on the Babis                    in the J.R.A.S.          for
1889 I       added   an                                  IV, pp.      1000-1008),

Appendix    (App.
wherein      I briefly described  some of                the chief     Babi works

of which   I had obtained MSS.           in Persia,    arranging     these
according    to   their                and    the  date   of   their  com

themselves      (some of which were          of composite       character)
I gave no description.          This I now regard as an error
of judgement,       since, for many        reasons    (and chiefly      that
in the future, when           they shall pass        into other hands,
there may be no difficulty             in identifying        them),    it is
desirable  that their contents should be clearly and succinctly
stated.  This defect    in my previous work I now propose
to remedy ; but I should not perhaps have done so were
it not that since the year 1889 I have acquired            a con
siderable number     of new MSS.       from authentic    sources,
a description   of which     may   facilitate the identification
of Babi MSS.       in other collections.      To    each of these
MSS.    I shall now give a distinctive         press-mark,   which

shall be inscribed on the title-page,     and which    shall serve
for its future identification.   The whole class I denote by

the letters BB    (the first B indicating    that they are Babi
MSS.,     the    second     that    they    form     part     of my      collection).

1                this article I employ,                    to my previous writings

Throughout                               in referring
on the Babis, and to those of Baron Rosen,        the abbreviations    already explained
at the beginning      of my last article  {J.R.A.S.    for April,   1892, pp. 259-260),
which    is itself denoted by the abbreviation      B.  iii, just as this article will in
future be referred to as B. iv.

434     DESCRIPTION OF BA'Bf MSS.

I further          subdivide        them according                  to the           source whence

they were        obtained         as follows:?

MS.    (the Persian Bey an) in Rafsinjan       near Kirman.

which    he placed     in my    hands while       I was    in

in March-April,    1890)    are  denoted  by   the

letters BBF      (the F standing for Famagusta).

the letters BBA          (the A standing          for Acre).

(IV.) MSS.    obtained            from Sheykh A-,

> resident     in Constantinople,                      who    is in constant
> communication    with Subh-i-Ezel, and is implicitly

alike I have had good proof.       These MSS.     are

denoted       by    the     letters    BBC          (the C         standing   for

Constantinople).
The MSS.    in each class are further specified by a number
appended      to  the class-letters,  which number denotes simply

the order in which         they   came  into my hands.       Thus     the
first    MS.       obtained     from Famagusta         is denoted       as
BBF.      1, the    second   as  BBF.    2,  and so   on.   With      this
preliminary      explanation    of the plan of classification    adopted

(which, it will be observed, is empirical rather than rational,
but which nevertheless          appeared to me for several reasons
the most     satisfactory),   I proceed to the detailed enumeration
of    the MSS.,        some of which,         having   been   elsewhere
sufficiently    noticed,    can   be  dismissed    very shortly, while
others will need a fuller description.

it was in good condition.
For     a              account of the work        see Baron Rosen's

general
description     in Coll. So. iii, pp. 32-51;     B. ii, pp. 944-9;    and
Coll. Sc. vi, pp. 143-4.

The work was composed, as I have already shown (p. 305

supra), two years after Beha's              return   to Baghdad     from
the mountains       of Kurdistan,     i.e. in a.h. 1274 (a.d. 1858-9),
while    he still owned       allegiance to Subh-i-Ezel.    The passage
which   proves         this has been already alluded to (cf. also B. ii,
p. 946), but          it is so important    that, as it is not included
in the extracts given by Baron          Rosen,     I here give it in
full.   It occurs on ff. 78b-79b        of the present MS.,       and
ff. 123a-125a     of the Acre MS.        which will     be described

Recent    researches   have thrown no small light on the
origin  and   authorship   of this history.  As the Syndics    of
the Cambridge University          Press have consented      to publish
an                translation    of   it which  I   have prepared,     I

abridged
prefer   to  reserve   a   full discussion   of these points for the
Introduction      to that work, and will here confine myself
to a brief statement of the more important facts.

I have previously    had occasion to observe (p. 319 supra)
that  the Tdrikh-i-Jadid     was in great measure   based on a
contemporary    history   of   the Babi movement   written  by
Haji Mirza   Jani of Kashan,   who     suffered martyrdom  at
Teheran   in 1852.  Till quite recently    all my attempts to
discover some trace of the earlier work proved ineffectual.
Last   Easter,   however,  I at length   found opportunity      to
examine     the five Babi MSS. belonging    to the Bibliotheque
Nationale     at Paris which were brought     back from Persia
by Count Gobineau.         Of  these five MSS.     two were     in
Persian   and three in Arabic.     Of the former, one (Suppl.
Pers.  1,070) contained  part, and the other      (Suppl. Pers.
1,071)   the whole  of a partly doctrinal,   partly   historical
work which    at once rivetted my attention,    and which,       as
I hope to prove conclusively     in the Introduction      to my
translation     of the Tdrikh-i-Jadid,     appears to be nothing
less than the hitherto       lost work of Haji Mirza        Jani.     I
was not able to subject this MS.          to an exhaustive     exami
nation,    the period of my       stay in Paris not sufficing      for
this, but    I found  in it, reproduced    almost   word   for  word,
the bulk of the more           important   narratives   quoted from
Haji          Jani's work in the Tdrikh~i-Jadid,

Mirza                                    these being
toldeither  as  the  writer's own                or as  accounts

experiences,
heard at first-hand    from those concerned.    If this Parisian
MS.   be indeed      (as I for my part feel assured        is the
case)         the        history          of    Haji   Mirza          Jani,   its   value    can

be    over-estimated.

sur la composition du

Tarikh-i-Djadid."
The only observation which       I need        at present make on
the foregoing     version    of   the, compilation    of the Tdrzkh-i
Jadid is that it seems difficult to ascribe its final recension
to Seyyid    Jawad of Kerbela,         inasmuch as he was one of
Subh-i-EzeFs    most     loyal supporters       (See T.N.   ii, p. 342,
n. 2), while    the Tdrikh-i-Jadid,          in so far as it alludes at
all to the later history        of the Babi movement,        manifests
Beha'i    sympathies,    and    systematically    ignores Subh-i-Ezel.
Moreover,    as will be set forth at the end of this

article,
444                       BABr MSS.    BBP. 6, BBP. 7.

when     I come       to describe   the MSS.             the press-marks

bearing
BBC.         1 and BBC. 2, Seyyid          Jewad

actually composed           two
large volumes     (the  Hasht    Bihisht,     vols,   i   and   ii)   on   the
Theory   and Practice    of the  Babi   religion,    which    are    strongly
Ezeli  in their proclivities.      (See also T.N.        ii, pp. 351-371,
and pp. 296-7       supra.)    It is not unlikely,          however,      that

the two or three passages          in the Tdrikh-i-Jadid               which
refer   to Beha may be interpolations      of the copyist,     and
that, on the other hand, passages        bearing     reference   to
Subh-i-Ezel    may have been excised.        In any       case the
information    obtained by M. Toumansky        is invaluable,    as

a definite basis for further investigation.

This work I discussed         at pp. 896-902        of my       second
article in the J.R.A.S.      for 1889, and I there attempted            to
prove that it was identical with a Babi work described by
Mirza Kazem-Beg         at pp. 498-502       of vol. viii     (series vi)
of the Journal Asiatique.        In one of my earlier letters to
Subh-i-Ezel     I enquired      as to the                        of this

Bey
did plunder this recluse, and steal away most of the Epistles

what    avails  it [now] ? Most         of them
have passed    into the hands of ignorant men,            and these
have pillaged    them.              a few remain       in this land,

[Only]
and even these were conveyed            [hither]   with    difficulty,
because of the fewness of [my] friends.            For this reason
most   of those books, whereof        the worth was great,          are
no                 in my    hands,     save             a small       fraction."

MEANING OF TERM BEYAN.                                         453

"

The book which was sent to you is [part] of the writings
of   the Beyan and belongs to His Holiness       the Point  [i.e. the
Bab].      It consists for  the most   part    of   prayers   to the
Fulfiller   of needs.   Who     [else]  is  able   to produce such
words?     What    was revealed at first was called each book

a different name, but during            the later period        [of the
by

one     title and     was
Bab's   life] all received                                 called   (Beyan.9
And much        [of this]  he    [i.e.    the   Bab]      directed     to be
arranged     in  nineteen  volumes,       as    is  fully    explained     in

> the Persian     Bdyan.1   But2    in the Beyan     different grades
> [or styles]   are apparent.    The  first grade resembles   previous
> [revealed]    books3;   the second is of the nature of supplica
tions and prayers ; the third is [in] the style of exhortations,
wherein      he [i.e. the Bab]     had regard     to clearness     and
eloquence   ; the fourth       [consists    of]    scientific treatises,
commentaries,   and     answers    to   enquirers;      and the fifth,
which is [substantially]    identical with the preceding         styles,
is in the Persian      language."      I have already pointed        out

> in another  place {T.N. ii, p. 346) how fully Subh-i-Ezel's
> account of the Bab's writings  and the meaning     of the term
'Beydn'   accords with Gobineau's    {Bel. et Phil.,  p. 311).
This                 work,      then,   contains    a     collection       of

present                                                               Prayers
belonging            to   the     "second

grade"     of the Beyan,     using
this term in its wider       signification    as             all the

connoting
Bab's    later writings.      Owing       to the number     of these
prayers,   and  the   limited  space    at  my disposal,  I can

only
give the opening words of each.

with    t*&-j31^^j31 41!**^,        etc. We   may fairly assume that
within    each group the first piece represents what the Bab

"                   or " style"

calls the      first grade"                      of his writings,   the
second piece the second grade, and so on. This hypothesis

is supported by the fact that the last piece in each group
of five is in Persian, and therefore corresponds to the Bab's
"fifth grade"       (see p. 453 supra).     Of the majority    of these
pieces   it must    be   frankly  confessed   that they are not only
untranslateable,     but almost unreadable,       consisting merely   of
endless        permutations    (often etymologically     and grammati
cally     impossible)    of the different   Names      of God.

from the Commentary       on the Sura-i- Yusuf,      etc.  Concern

Subh-i-Ezel     said  that this form of visitation         was

the Bab  himself.      To this MS.,       as to the last,
composed by
is prefixed      the title ^Lj,       evidently     in that wide       sense
to which      I have already adverted           (p.  453   supra).   As      it
contains    a  great   number    of  pieces,  I  must,   for   the  sake    of

brevity, confine myself      to the briefest enumeration         of all save
the most   interesting.

The first five pieces      (extending     from f. 2b to f. 27b) begin
with the formula       *?&]    +S3I]  AlM**wJ,and appear to represent

"                    above described,      the fifth of the
each of the      five grades"

group being,      as  usual,    in  Persian,     and   beginning    in the

same way     as   the   Persian     pieces    already   described.   The
firstof these, containing          endless  permutations           of the    root
*s3 , is much the longest,        extending   to f. 23b.

Next    follows another       similarly     arranged    group     of five

each                 with   the formula     AJJIw
pieces (ff. 23b-55a),          beginning

Of these again the first contains permutations
c?y^l c-yil.
of the root c-^J, and the last is in Persian.
Next    follows a third group of five pieces               (ff. 55a-76a)

with    the formula                           4Ulw,       and
beginning                               j^-^l     ^-?>^1
arranged   like   the preceding.
The    16th                          is preceded               the formula
piece (ff. 76a-78b)                        by

Since iVtfM is, as I have shewn {B. ii, p. 997), equivalent
to Muhammad,         it is clear that we have here an

epistle

> either   to Mulla    Muhammad       'Ali of Barfurush       (Jendb-i
Kuddus)     or Mulla  Muhammad      'Ali  of Zanjan, and

probably
to the latter.    For on f. 97b we find the following words :

And      from  the Tdrikh-i-Jadid      we       learn that Mulla
Muhammad        'Ali of Zanjan    enjoyed      the    title of Jendb-i
Hujjat   (" the Proof    or

The 18th piece (ff. 82a-93b)       is another epistle addressed

to one of his chief apostles, beginning         thus :

Tabarsi       and the commemoration          of the martyrs     who fell
there, and is headed                accordingly?^yp^\                ^        *Tj^uJ1 i^bj^

The 24th piece                (ff. 107a-126a)   is of considerable  length,
but    a superficial             examination     of it reveals   no points   of
special interest.

The 25th piece               (ff. 126a-126b)  appears to be addressed
to Subh-i-Ezel,            and is described as bL>. 4L*i>- :1. It begins :

The remainder    of the epistle, which   is very   short, is
partly in Persian.
The 26th piece is short, and not specially

noteworthy.
The 27th     is long   (ff. 127*-130a), is written             in

partly
Persian,      and     contains      answers      to                                 addressed

sundry         questions
in writing    to the Bab.
Nos.    28-45                     are ali short

(ff. 130a-141a)                     epistles addressed
to believers who had written           to the Bab.          The names of
these correspondents         are mentioned       in several      cases, but
their identification       cannot be                        effected   in a

satisfactorily
brief notice     like this, and I therefore            reserve     them for
future                              .......

consideration.
The     46th      piece is the document which     I published                               and
translated         at pp. 996-7    of B. ii, wherein   Subh-i-Ezel                               is
designated          the Bab's successor.

The 52nd      piece             is the      same     as      the     first     in BBF.        1,
already described at              p. 453     supra.

The 53rd piece                (ff. 150a-153a)    is the 57th chapter of
> the Commentary      on          the Sura-i-Yusuf      (see pp. 261-8 supra),
> containing          the    explanation     or  expansion    of v. 56 of the
Sura.

The     58th     piece       is an     extract         from          the Book          of       the
names             c->b?;  see T.N.    ii, pp.                      202, 318, 338),   to

which   are   prefixed ordinances   bearing                       on the arrangement
of the Babi calendar.      The year is here                         explicitly described
as                 of 361 days    (19x19),                        and no mention         is

consisting
made      of theintercalary   days used by                        the Beha'is,    so that
these    would   seem to have been introduced by Beha         (cf.
T.N.    ii, pp. 419, 422-5).       This preface  concludes  with
a command      that all letters shall be fully dated, according
to the Babi method,       and, as a specimen, a date (seemingly
that whereon      this document was written)    is given in full,
as follows:

The     thus given

the day of   cIlm [the     12th   day]  of the month          'Ilm

[^+1     ^=6],
that the document must      have been written       during     the
last year of the Bab's             life (October,    1849).   For     this
reason, if for no other, it is interesting.

The 59th piece is a letter of instructions           to Subh-i-Ezel,
who    therefore    prefixes     to it,   as  to  some   of the letters

previously    described,     the  words     j^ ^>b     bb*   4L*>- jl?

Froma passage on f. 175b it would appear that with this

to Subh-i-Ezel   seven Vdhids of one of the

sacred books.     Of these he is instructed to keep one himself,
and to distribute    the other six to the Lands of Fa, 'Ayn,

In a letter written                  on March

by Subh-i-Ezel               13th, 1892,
in answer to questions addressed   to him by myself    as to the

of the persons to whom allusion    is here made, the
identity

following  explanations (some of which     refer to other docu
ments described in this article) were given.    By Ismu'l-Anis

(^^31      *J,    "the    Name         of the Intimate")   Haji    Suleyman
Khan,  who accompanied                   the Bab on his pilgrimage-journey,
and suffered martyrdom    at Teheran in 1852, is meant.   Ismu'l
Jawdd                 the Name of the Generous")    denotes Aka

(^jgA *J\,
Seyyid Jawad of Kerbela, who died some eight years ago at
Kirman.         (See T.N.    ii, p. 342, n. 2, and pp. 443-4 supra.)
The Letter Sin                                          means " Jendb-i

(^^1     c?{/*-) sometimes

title when his master declared himself             to be the     Point"),
and sometimes Hazral-i-Kuddus               (Mulla    Muhammad       'Ali of
Barfurush).        Ism-i-Musavvir                        the Name    of   the

(j}*3-* (^\

"the Name         of the Proof")      means     Mulla   Muhammad         'Ali
of Zanjan.   (Cf. p. 472 supra). Ism-i-Sddik (j^b       "the

^J,
Name    of the Faithful")   means   Mulla Muhammad     Sadik,
called   Mukaddas-i-Khurasan,                  the   Saint   of Khurasan."     Ism

i-Rahim            *J, "the Name      of the Merciful")            a         was

(*^-j

Nabil   (J-^3 *-*!," the Name of the Noble ") denotes    a  certain

Haji Sheykh    Muhammad      of Kazvin,   who died  at Lahijan     in
Gilan  during the Baghdad   period.                        (The name Nabil    always

> stands for Muhammad,   with which                       it is numerically    equiva
lent.     Cf. B.       ii, p.   By Ismu'l-'Ali
997).                                          "the

The 60th piece     (ff. 176b-177a)     contains more "instruc

The     62nd  piece     (ff. 177a-182b)          is a prayer         for daily

in the opening words                of    the    "visitation"        (on f. 185a),
which run thus:

{i.e. followers,     it seems probable that                              this is another form

These specimens  of the style of Hazrat-i-Kuddiis,        few
though   they be, sufficiently   show   that   his Arabic  is even
more   open to the grammarian's       criticism    than is usually
the case with Babi writings    in that language.

This,      as I have         said, presents a continuous        text,

already
composed by                        and interspersed

Subh-i-Ezel,                   with his own
commentary,     extending      from f. 22a to f. 101b.           I shall
give  the first  few   lines   only    of the   exordium,    the   whole
of the introductory      preface,    and   a  short   specimen    of   the

The     cyphers  at the end of the Naghamdtu'r-Ruh             are

at the end   of the  La'dli u Majdli   (f. 203a),   and
repeated
at the end of another MS. containing       some of Subh-i-Ezel's
Persian writings which will be described presently.           They

indicate, as Subh-i-Ezel    informed me by word of mouth,
that    the writings      to which     they are appended         are by
him.     Their   significance,  however,     he  was   not  willing    to
divulge    to  me.    Probably    they   refer  in  some   way    to the
abjad notation.

La'dli iiMajdli.

(Jb^               JU1).
Of  this piece also I shall give first of all the opening
words   of the exordium, then the short introductory preface,
then a few specimens        of the aphorisms         or " Sententiae,"
which,    arranged    in groups     according      to the position     of
the initial    (or sometimes    the  final)   letter  in the alphabet,
make       up the remainder                of the work.

The whole              work,   excluding   the preface, consists of 179
such       sections,        arranged    in groups  alphabetically   according
> to     the      initial       letter of the aphorisms.       The number       of
sections    belonging     to each letter varies.        Sections   i-xix

aphorisms,   and the specimens which I have given,

though
few, will, I  think, sufficiently   indicate its general   character.

A     collection

of Subh-i-Ezel's   Persian writings,      transcribed
by himself    in a clear, graceful, and somewhat

peculiar taHik
hand, and                  a  number    of  sections    or

containing                                     chapters of
various lengths, to each of which is prefixed a                       but

doxology,
no title.   The full examination       and description       of   such    a
collection being necessarily     a work of time, I confine

myself
here to giving      the beginning    and ending.       Near     the end
of the MS.       is a rather     long and very       important      piece
wherein    Subh-i-Ezel    defines and defends his position,           and
enters a protest against       the schism of the Beha'is.           This
piece I hope to publish with a translation            in a subsequent
number of the Journal.

The Bab's        Commentary             on the Shratu'l-Bakara                  [Kur'dn,   IT].

This   and the three following MSS.   (all containing     works
> of the Bab) were not transcribed by Subh-i-Ezel,        but  were
> transmitted   to me through him from Persia.       The    circum
> stances under which      they  were conveyed    from     Teheran
to Cyprus and thence to me were somewhat peculiar.                    On

I  received    from   Teheran     a  letter  from   an
> July 9th, 1890,
unknown                       belonging      to  the   Ezeli     sect    of
correspondent
the Babis which     bore  as  its  date    Tuesday,    Shawwal      14th,
> a.h. 1307    (June 3rd, 1890).       After a preliminary       doxology,
the writer proceeded      to explain that, being at Famagusta

in Cyprus      in the month        of Zi'1-Ka'da,       a.h. 1306 (July,
1889),   he   had  been    present   when     my     first    letter, asking
for books and information,           was handed            to Subh-i-Ezel,
and had perused        its contents;    and that he had also been
present   when     the     Governor         (i.e. the Commissioner           of
the district,    Captain Young),         called     to    see    Subh-i-Ezel
and to converse with          him through         his interpreter.         On

leaving Cyprus    to  return   to Persia    he   had    been     commanded
by Subh-i-Ezel     to collect together such of the Bab's writings
as he could (especially      those concerning which I had more
particularly   enquired).      On arriving    at Teheran   he had
accordingly    set  to  work    on  this task, and  had  succeeded

in obtaining    copies of (1) The Commentary          on the Sura-i

Yusuf,    or Ahsanu'l-Kisas     ; (2) The Names        of All Things

(3) The  Commentary    on   the Suratu'l-Bakara;
> (^Ai? *bJ);
(4) The                      on   the Suratu'1-'A sr;

Commentary                                      (5) The
Boxology    of  our Lady Fdtima     (A^bli ci^-J^. ^-^uJ).       These
books were to have been forwarded through a certain Ezeli,
whose    position would     have enabled him to secure            their
safe   conveyance,1       but   his    sudden     death     had     rendered  this
impossible.     My    correspondent             therefore         desired  me   to
suggest     some means     of transmission,   adding    that desire
to see Western    lands and to learn their languages       and arts,
as well as anxiety to escape from the continual persecutions
of the Mullas      (who had lately, without     cause or pretext,
slain six of his co-religionists        at Isfahan     and burned
their bodies),2    rendered   him very willing       to bring   the
MSS.   to England   himself, if I approved of this plan, and
if he could obtain money for the journey.

To this letter I replied in the manner    directed.  After
thanking    my    correspondent     for all the trouble he had
taken,   I explained    to him  the   great expense and difficulty
of the scheme he proposed,        and suggested    that the books

My correspondent   did not mention     the name of this person,       but   1 have
no doubt in my own mind as to who is meant.
2 The               of

persecution     Si-dih is alluded to.    See my Traveller's     Narrative,
vol. ii*, pp. 406-410.

BBF. ?.            COMM*ON SITRATU'L-BAKARA.                                       495

> should, when opportunity   offered, be conveyed    to Cyprus
> and placed  in the hands  of Subh-i-Ezel,    who could after

> the originals   to me  through    Captain Young.      In any
case it appeared to me right and proper that

they should
first be placed in his hands.

On September     19th, 1890, I received another     letter in
the same hand,       bearing  the Constantinople    post-mark,
but written,      apparently,  from Famagusta,     whither    my
mysterious    correspondent   had again   journeyed.     In this

letter       he       stated   that he had, according                           to my advice,
> abandoned              the  idea of coming to England,                          and had safely
> brought  the             following    six volumes with                         him to Cyprus
and handed               them    over   to Subh-i-Ezel:

(1) The Names
of All  Things, 2 vols. ; (2) The Commentary on the Suratu91

Bakara,    1 vol.;       (3) The   Commentary     on the Suratu91
Kawthar,    1 vol.;         The  Commentary   on  the Suratu9 l-(Asr,

(4)
1 vol.;     (5)    The     Commentary   on   the  Surai-Yusuf      or
Ahsanu'l-Kisas,                 1 vol.

Having   thus explained    how   this and the                                             following
volumes were conveyed    to Cyprus, whence most                                              of thern
have      since        been      sent    to   me,     I   return     to    the                   MS.,

present
the Commentary       on the Suratu91-Bakara.      That it was one
of the Bab's earlier works appears from a passage               in the
Tdrikh-i-Jadid,    of  which    the   substance  will  be   found   at
pp.  902-903    of   my    second   paper   on  the   Babis    in  the
J.R.A.S.            for        1889.      This        passage       contains         the       account
given by Mulla Huseyn                        of Bushraweyh                 of his       conversion
to Mirza  'Abdu'l-Wahhab                        of Khurasan,                who       narrated           it

to Haji        Mirza            Jani     of Kash an, from                 whose        book       it    is
copied by the author of the Tdrikh-i-Jadid.       It is too long
to quote or translate      in extenso, and I must       therefore
confine myself   to citing    that portion   of it which    bears
directly on the Commentary      in question.

"'          a while'"                                    of Bushraweyh]

After                   [says Mulla Huseyn
"'                                                in  a recess.    I picked

I observed several volumes         lying
> up    one  of them, and found       it  to  be    a  Commentary       on the
> Siiratu'I-Bakar    a.  After reading      a  little I perceived      it to be
> a commentary       of singular merit, and demanded              in astonish

> a high degree of knowledge         and greatness."          I again asked
> who     and where      the writer was.          "Thou      seest him," he

replied; but I did not at the time apprehend his meaning,
and continued        to read on till I came to a passage where
it was written,       the explanation of the inmost of the inmost."
This appeared      to me    to be an error, and I remarked,           Here

'                                           '

But I am wearied.           Do you read and I will listen."             He

enough.   Do not trouble yourself    further."

It is this work,   then, hitherto    unknown    in the West,

The      text         begins with            the    Shratu'l-Fdtiha            and     a     short
commentary                 on it, which       I give       in extenso?

Mulla Huseyn's                   conversion

given   by the Tdrikh-i-Jadid,
which may perhaps be mistaken       as to the identity of the
work, since Subh-i-Ezel told me that it was the perusal      of
the Commentary on the Sura-i-Yusuf    which  convinced Mulla

Here, without                      begins
Bahar a. The commentary on the first verse extends to f. 8a, so I must needs
content myself  with giving the first few lines only.
