THE B.ABI CONCEPT OF HOLY WAR

Denis MacEoin
> The religious movement known as Babism appeared in mid-nineteenth-
> century Iran following the promulgation of charismatic claims by a young
> merchant, Sayyid cAfi Mul;iammad Shiraz!, in 1844. In its earliest phase (to
> 1848), Babism grew rapidly among the Shiel populations oflran and Iraq as
> an expression of extreme Islamic pietism animated by urgent expectation of
> the return of the Hidden Imam in his messianic persona as the Imam Mahdi,
> Sayyid cAll Mu!;iammad being his agent or 'gate' (bab) on earth. In its brief
> second phase ( 1848-49), the movement achieved a tremendous charismatic
> breakthrough when a gathering of Babis announced the abrogation of the
> Islamic legal code while the Bab (by now in prison in the north west oflran)
> proclaimed himself the promised Mahdi in person. A third phase followed,
> initiated by the Bab's rapid assumption of the role ofan independent prophet
> or divine 'manifestation' directly empowered by God to open a new religious
> dispensation after Islam, to reveal new scriptures and to ordain a new legal
> system. Between 1848 and 1850, some four or five thousand Babis died in fierce
> clashes with state troops, while the Bab himself was executed by firing squad
injuly 1850. 1

The following article seeks to clarify the background to the Babi-state
> clashes in the form of a discussion of the theory of holy war as presented in early
> Babi writings and to analyse these conflicts themselves within the context of
> that theory. It is hoped that this analysis will also provide a basis for a later
> discussion of the dynamics of the transformation which took place from the
> 1860s from Babism to Baha'ism.

Although some form ofholy war has been recognized at various times and in
> different places in most religions, it is a concept most typically associated with
> Islam, a religion in which it has played a central role and where it has
> developed what is probably its most distinctive form as well as its most
> elaborate theological justification. It is not surprising, therefore, that holy war
> or jihad came to be a major feature ofBabism, particularly in its early 'Islamic'
phase, and that a response to the problems raised by jihad in the contemporary

94    D. MacEoin

> period, as well as to the complications engendered by Babi militancy, became
> a dominant element in the early development of the doctrines of the derivative
> Baha'i movement. Until now, however, the role of jihad in Babi theory and
> practice has been largely ignored by scholars, and no serious attempt has as
yet been made to define or analyse its relationship to the Islamic concept of
religious warfare.

It has, for example, been common to speak of 'Ba bi uprisings', 2 of 'Babi-
> inspired revolt' and 'rebellion',3 of a Babi 'rebellion against the state' and of
> 'Babi insurrection. 4 Later Baha'i writers have, on the other hand, consistently
> characterized the military activities of the Babis as defensive measures taken
in response to religious persecution and have rejected all suggestions of

rebellion or, indeed, of militancy. Thus, one writer states that 'when they (the
> Babis) defended themselves, as they did in a few places where a large number
> of Ba bis had congregated, their enemies misrepresented them as rebelling', 5
> and speaks of 'prolonged Babi resistance to the attacks of vastly superior
> forces' and the 'heroic defence' of the Babis. 6 Each of the struggles in
> Mazandaran, Nayriz and Zanjan is generally described as an 'upheaval', 7
> 'conflagration' ,8 or 'commotion' ,9 and the participants in them as 'the victims
> of an intense and systematic persecution on the part of both civil and ecclesia-
> stical authorities', 10 as 'martyrs', 11 and as 'the scattered disciples of a
> persecuted community' . 12 Emphasis is laid on the 'categorical repudiation, on
> the part of the Babis, ofany intention ofinterfering with the civil jurisdiction of
> the realm, or of undermining the legitimate authority of its sovereign', 13 and
> on the denial by the Babi leadership that they had sought to 'direct any
offensive' against their opponents. 14

Both these views-'rebellion' on the one hand and 'self-defence' and 'per-
> secution' on the other--obscure the more fundamental issue of the nature,
> status, and function ofjihiid within the Ba bi movement, as derived from Islam,
> from the writings of the Bab, and from the expressed attitudes of the Babi
> leadership in those localities where trouble broke out. A careful consideration
> of the doctrine of holy war is a vital factor in the study of the Babi-Baha'i
> movement, for a number ofreasons. Firstly, it provides us with an important
> focus for the consideration of the Bab's attitude and the attitudes of his
> followers to Islam and to the Qajar state. Secondly, it enables us to carry out a
> reappraisal of the political and ethical issues involved in the struggles of
> Shaykh Tabarsi, Nayriz and Zanjan, as well as in other outbreaks of violence
> on a smaller scale between Babis and Muslim civilians or military forces.
> Thirdly, it leads us directly to one of the most central questions around which
> the development ofBaha'ism out ofBabism revolves, and clarifies for us what
is perhaps the most distinctive feature of early Baha'i doctrine.

The Babi Concept efHoly War    95

> THEISLAMICCONCEPTOF]IHAD
> From the beginning, jihad has played a vital role in the expansion and con-
> solidation oflslam and in the structuring ofits world view. 15 M.M. Bravmann
> has convincingly demonstrated the close connections between the concepts of
> isl;;,m (submission, surrender) and those of holy war (jih;;,d), war in general
> (barb) and fighting (qitiil) in the earliest period. 16 More perhaps than the
> other major teachings oflslam,jihiid bears a deep relationship to its image and
> function as a universal religion to which, in the end, all men must submit, and
> whose legal and political system must ultimately embrace the planet.
> Mul:tammad is the last of the prophets 17 and, as such, commissioned by God
> with a message, not for one people or race, but for all mankind: 'We have not
> sent you save as a bringer of universal tidings and a warner unto men'. 18
> Mul:tammad's function as a bringer of tidings and a warner (primarily con-
> cerning the Day ofjudgment) included the obligation to proclaim the message
> given him by God 19 and to summon men to God and to submission to Him
> (al-isliim). 20 Although the duty of inviting men to Islam fell primarily on the
> shoulders of the Prophet (particularly in the early period when access to him
> was always feasible), and although the ultimate work of guidance was left in
> the hands of God, there gradually developed in both theory and practice an
> obligation for the believers to assist God and His apostle in the universal dacwa,
> the summons to Islam. 21 The nature of this dacwa was necessarily closely
> linked to the actual circumstances in which the Prophet and his followers
found themselves and to the character of the response which it evoked.

During the Meccan period (about 610-622 A.D.), Muhammad and his
> companions found themselves in a position of extreme weakness vis vis thea
> possible or actual physical sanctions of the society in which they lived.
> Summoning to Islam was to be carried out wisely and in a spirit of loving
> persuasion: 'Summon to the path of your Lord with wisdom and goodly
> counsel; dispute with them in the most suitable manner'. 22 The punishment of
> unbelievers lay outside the sphere of action of the small Islamic community; it
> would be taken care ofin due course by God-in the meantime, men were to be
> warned of the imminence ofsuch punishment and invited to salvation through
embracing the true faith.

The first sign of a marked change in policy coincided with the accession of
> some real strength to the Islamic community by the conversion of large
> numbers in the city of Medina between the summer of621 and June 622. In
> this latter month, a party of seventy-five Medinan Muslims came to Mecca,
> met Mul:tammad by night, and pledged themselves to accept him as their
> prophet, to avoid the commission of sins, and to fight on behalfofGod and His
messenger. This 'Second Pledge ofal-c Aqaba' came to be known as 'the Pledge

96    D. MacEoin

> of War'. 23 According to some Muslim authorities, it was not long after this that
> the first revelation concerning fighting was given to MuJ:i.ammad, in a passage
> which now constitutes verses 30 to 40 of the eighth chapter of the Qur'an: 'Say
> to those that have disbelieved in God that if they should cease (from per-
> secuting the believers), that which has gone before shall be forgiven them; but
> should they begin once more, then the example of those who went before them
> has already been given. Wherefore, fight them until persecution shall be no
> more and religion shall belong in its entirety to God. But if they should cease,
> God beholds all that they do'. 24
In Medina, Muhammad's role changed gradually from that of prophet pure
> and simple to that of divinely-inspired legislator and de facto leader of a city
> state comprising Meccan and Medinan Muslims, pagan Arabs of Medina,
> and three allied Jewish tribes. In 623, having sufficiently consolidated his
> position in Medina, Mul;iammad initiated the practice of sending out
> expeditions against Meccan caravans. These raids soon began to acquire
> something of the character of a holy war: the Quranic injunctions to take part
> in them emphasized the virtue of striving (jihad) in the way of God and were
> eventually addressed to the community of believers as a whole, rather than
> specifically to the Meccan emigrants originally involved in this activity. The
> term for thus striving on behalf of God and His prophet against the unbelievers
> came, before long, to be the technical term for the holy war waged by Islam
> against the world of infidelity. 'The change from the razzia (expedition) to the
jihad', writes Montgomery Watt, 'may seem to be no more than a change of

> name, the giving of an aura of religion to what was essentially the same
> activity. Yet this was not so. There was a change in the activity which came to
> be of the utmost importance as time went on. A razzia was the action ofa tribe
> against another tribe .... jihad, however, was the action of a religious
> community against non-members of the community, and the community was
> expanding. If the members of the pagan tribes raided by the Muslims profe-
> ssed Islam, they at once became exempt from further Muslim raids. Con-
> sequently, as the Islamic community grew, the raiding propensities of the
Muslims had to be directed ever further outwards.' 25

The open outbreak of hostilities between the fledgling Islamic state and the
> city of Mecca and the subsequent escalation of the conflict in the battles of
> Badr (624) and UJ:i.ud (625), leading to the Siege of the Trench in 627 and
> culminating in the final capitulation of the Meccans inJanuary 630, must all
> be studied in the standard histories. There is, similarly, no room here to enter
> in any detail into the discussion as to the dating of those passages of the Qur'an
which elaborate the rationale and method of the holy war.

In general, there would appear to have been a gradual movement from
> injunctions to fight Ou a defensive basis to more explicitly aggressive
ordinances in the later years of the Prophet's life. The early period seems to

The Babi Concept of Holy War    97

have been characterized by a certain distinction between the military role of
jihad on the one hand and religious conversion by peaceful means on the other:

> 'there is no compulsion in religion'. 26 Nevertheless, even if it was recognized
> that conscience could not be compelled by force (at least in days when the
> techniques of brain-washing had not been thought of), Islam was a system in
> which church and state, religion and politics formed a unity. To spread the
> faith, it was necessary to spread the Pax Islamica within which the law and
> polity oflslam might hold sway. To engage injihiidwas a religious act of the
> greatest piety in a world divided in almost Manichaean fashion between God

> and the devil, belief and unbelief: 'Those who believe do battle for the cause of
> God, while the unbelievers wage war on behalf of idols'. 27 Following the
> capture of Mecca, an unremitting war against all idolaters was enjoined on the
> Muslim community: 'When the sacred months are past, slay the idolaters
> wherever you may come upon them, and seize them, and lay siege to them, and
> prepare ambushes for them; but if they are converted and perform the ob-
> ligatory prayer and pay the alms-tax, then leave their way open'. 28 Jews and
> Christians, who had previously been looked on with some favour, were
> regarded now as, for the most part, unbelievers (kuffer) and enemies of
> Islam, 29 and war against them was prescribed, until they would pay a sub-
> mission tax or impost known asjizya. 30 Islam was to be the universal religion,
> before which all others were to give way: 'He (God) it is Who has sent His
> messenger with guidance and with the true religion, that He may make it
> supreme over all religions, even though the unbelievers may be averse to it'; 31
'fight then until mischief is at an end and all religion may belong to God'. 32

As is well known,jihiid played a fundamental role in the physical expansion
> oflslam after the death of the Prophet in 632. The doctrine of the abrogation of
> earlier Quranic texts by later ones meant that, in practice, jihad was waged in
> accordance with those scriptural injunctions which reflected an intransigent,
> uncompromising attitude towards pagans and 'people of the Book' Uews,
> Christians and, later, Zoroastrians). The former were normally given a simple
> choice between conversion and death; the latter were given three choices: they
> could submit to the authority of the Islamic state, pay the poll-tax and
> land-tax, and be treated as protected but definitely inferior subjects of the
> Islamic state (whose only true citizens were Muslims); they could fight but, if
> defeated, might be enslaved and their property be taken as booty, four-fifths of
> it belonging to the Muslim army; or they could embrace Islam and become full
citizens.

Over the centuries,jihiid has remained a duty binding on the community of
> believers, rather than an individual duty. In theory, this duty cannot be
> relaxed until the faith of Islam holds universal sway or 'until the Day of
> Resurrection'. Traditionally, the world is divided into two sections: the diir
> al-&arb (realm of war) and diir al-isliim (realm oflslam), 33 and it is the function
> 98    D. MacEoin

> ofjihad to transform the former into the latter; theoretically, therefore, a state
> of perpetual war exists between the Islamic world and the rest of mankind,
> although it has not always proved possible in practice to maintain this position
in an active sense, particularly in the modern period. Nevertheless, any war

between a Muslim and a non-Muslim state, whether offensive or, as has
> occurred more frequently in recent centuries, defensive, has the status ofjihiid,
> and those who die while waging such a war are accounted martyrs. In
> principle, war between Muslim states is prohibited; where it does occur,
> however, it is referred to as 'war', 'fighting' or 'conflict', but never asjihiid. In

> general, this principle also applies in the case of conflict between an army of an
> orthodox Islamic state and the members of a heretical group, within or
> without the state, although on more than one occasion jihad has been invoked
> as a means of sanctioning a struggle against sectaries and rebels, defined as
'people of rebellion' (ah! al-baghy).

The Twelver Shiel doctrine ofjihiid is, for the most part, identical with the
> Sunn! theory, but the peculiar conditions under which Shicism developed
> created a number of differences, some of which are of considerable impor-
> tance. 34 The Shici theory presents two features of particular interest, namely:
> the identity of the individual empowered to lead the faithful in the prosecution
> of such a struggle, and that of the enemies against whom it may be waged.
> With respect to the first of these, Shici theory limits the leadership of the holy
> war to one of the twelve Imams or to his lieutenant designate. In practice, only
> the Imams cAli and I:Iusayn ever led an army into battle, and the failure of the
> latter's rising against the U mmayad state resulted in the adoption of a quietist
> position by his successors.Jihad came to be regarded as being held in abeyance
> until the moment arrived for its revival-that is, on the return of the twelfth
> Imam as the divinely-guided Mahdi who would conquer the world for Islam.
> Since the hidden Imam did not delegate his authority directly to anyone
> except the four 'gates' (abwiib, sing. biib) who followed him during his 'lesser
> occultation' ,jihad could no longer be declared, since for anyone to do so would
> be for him to usurp the prerogative of the Imam of the age. In practice,
> however, this theory required modification in cases where the survival of a
> Shici state might depend on its ability to launch a legitimate holy war against
> its enemies. Abiijacfar al-Tiisi argued thatjihiidofa defensive nature might be
> waged in the absence of the Imam, a view that had a powerful influence on
> later theorists. Certain jurists of the Ilkhani period stated that the believers
> could be summoned to jihad by the Imam or by a person appointed by him to
> do so, in a context implying that the duty of issuing such a summons rested
with the culamii, the religious scholars, as representatives of the Imam. 35

In the ~afavi period, the establishment ofa powerful, centralized Shici state
> capable of waging both offensive and defensive warfare, was combined with
the claim by the monarchs of the dynasty to be descended from the Imams and

The Babi Concept of Holy War   99

> to possess the authority needed to assume many of their prerogatives,
> including that of leading jihad. The situation changed somewhat under the
> Qajars in the nineteenth century; in this case, the ruling dynasty was
> considered illegitimate by much of the religious establishment, while the latter
> waxed considerably in their influence, particularly during the first part of the
nineteenth century. 36 Individual culama such as Shaykh Jacfar al-Najafi,

> Mulla Mulfammad Baqir J:Iujjat al-Islam Shaft!, and Shaykh Mulfammad
> J:Iasan al-Najafi possessed personal power to a degree unmatched by even the
greatest of their ~afavi predecessors. The newly-powerful mujtahids and, in

particular, those of them who could lay claim to the function of marjaciyyat

(acting as a model and authority for the behaviour of others), came to be
regarded as the de facto representatives of the Imam. Coinciding with this

novel situation came the threat of Russian aggression on the northern borders
> oflran, leading directly to the outbreak of the Russo-Persian wars of 1804-13
and 1826-28. In 1809, five years after the start of the first of these wars, Mirza

> Buzurg Farahani Qa'im Maqam, the vazir of crown prince cAbbas Mirza,
> either on his own initiative37 or on the instructions of Fath cA!i Shah, 38

> obtained decrees from several of the leading culama at the Shici shrines in Iraq,
declaring the war against Russia to be a jihad. These decrees were collected by

> Mirza Buzurg in a volume entitled Risala-yi jihadiyya, which was one of the
> first books ever printed in lran. 39 In 1826, Russian atrocities committed
> against the Muslim population of the Caucasus stirred the religious
> authorities in Iraq and Iran, led by Aqa Sayyid MuJ:iammad Isfahan!, to
> declare a second jihad. Reluctant to declare war on Russia, Fatlf cAli Shah was,
> in the end, forced to do so by religious pressure from the culama, whichipcluded
> the issuing of a decree to the effect that opposition to jihad was a sign of
> unbelief. 40 In 1836, an attempt was made to preach holy war against the Sunni
Afghans and Turkomans; 41 in 1843, following the sack of Karbala by Najib

> Pasha, a similar attempt was made to wage a Shiel jihad against the
> Ottomans; 42 and in 1856/57 a more intensive effort was made by the state itself
> to launch a full-scale jihad against the British, who had declared war on Iran
> after the sack ofHerat in 1856. 43 Among those impelled by the British attack
> on Iran to advocate the launching of a holy war was J:Iajj Mulla MuJ:iammad
> Karim Khan Kirmanl, the leader of the Shaykhi sect in Kirman, who wrote a
> lengthy treatise entitled Risala-yi NaJiriyya, in which he outlined the nature of
> jihad and its varieties and called on Na~ir al-Din Shah and the people oflran to
defend the faith of Iran against the incursions of the unbelievers. 44

Jihad has also been invoked on occasion during the present century. In 1912,
for exam pie, following the Italian invasion of Libya, some of the Iranian culama
> of Iraq called, somewhat quixotically, for a holy war against the invaders, as
> much to stir up feelings against the British and Russians then occupying parts
of Iran as to offer real support to the people ofLibya. 45 In 1914, during the

100   D. MacEoin

> British occupation of Iraq, the Shiel culama there declared jihad in rein-
> forcement of a call to holy war made by the Shaykh al-Islam of the Ottoman
> Empire, 46 and their opposition to non-Muslim rule continued during the
period of the British mandate in Iraq.

The second distinguishing feature of the Shiel view ofjihad is the problem of
> identifying those who may be regarded as legitimate enemies in a religious
> war. Both Sunnis and Shiels are agreed that jihad may be waged against
> polytheists, apostates, scriptuaries Oews, Christians and Zoroastrians), and
> dissenters. But, whereas Sunni theory defined the latter as those who rebelled

> against the legitimate religious or secular ruler and regarded it necessary to
> fight only when the state was actually threatened by such elements, Shiel
> doctrine applied the term without discrimination to all those who opposed the
> twelve Imams-in other words, to all non-Twelver Muslims. The duty to fight
> against these dissenters was not dependent on any specific threatening cir-
> cumstances, but remained a constant element of doctrine. ' ... while the
> Imamis concurred in the need to fight the infidels, they regarded as an
> essential step the conversion of all Muslims into true believers (i.e. Imami
> Shieis).' 47 This belief is closely related to the distinction drawn in Shieism
> between islam (which is professed by all Muslims) and iman (true faith,
> professed only by the Shiiea). 48 In this way, the world is divided for the Shiea,
> not between infidelity and Islam, but into three areas: the realms of faith,
> Islam and unbelief. 49 So important is the idea of jihad against dissenters for
> Shiel thinkers that references to it in their writings 'probably outnumber
> references to other kinds ofjihad'. 50 The wars between the Imam eAli and his
> enemies are regarded by Shiel theorists as jihad, as is the subsequent rising of
> his son J:Iusayn against the Umayyad caliphate. Justification has, therefore,
> always existed within Shiel doctrine, not only for war against non-Shiel
> Muslims of another state, but for any rising against a state which is deemed to
> have usurped the rights of the Imam and his people. A novel development of
> this attitude has occurred in the last two centuries under the ostensibly Shiel
> rule of the Qajar and Pahlavi dynasties in Iran. In the course of the agitation
> which led to the granting of a constitution in 1906, the Qajars were sometimes
> compared to or even identified with the hated Umayyads, 51 while the struggle
> forca constitution was decreed as being 'like a Holy War under the command of
> the Hidden lmam'. 52 The recent Iranian revolution against the Pahlavi
> regime serves as the most telling example of the power of the jihad concept as a
> factor in political opposition within a Shiel state, nor is it insignificant that the
> opposition to the revolutionary authorities continues to style its members
mujahidin, 'fighters in the holy war'.

We may, then, identify in Shiel theory several factors which, as will be seen,
> are relevant to the formulation of the Babijihad doctrine. There is, firstly, the
traditional view that jihad is illegitimate during the period of the Imam's

The Babi Concept of Holy War   IOI

> concealment and that, conversely, the waging of a universal holy war to purify
> the earth from unbelief and 'to fill the earth with justice after it has been filled
> with injustice' was one of the central acts to be performed by the Mahdi in his
> parousia. Side by side with this, there is the apparently contradictory nine-
> teen th century experience of the issue of decrees for the waging ofjihad against
> Christian enemies and a growing tendency to legitimize internal revolutionary
> struggles by classing them as jihad. There is, secondly, the notion of a tripartite
> division of the world into the realms of faith, Islam and unbelief coupled with
> the duty of jihad not only to bring the world of infidelity within the realm of

> Islam, but to transform the world ofrebellious, 'covenant-breaking' Islam into
> that of true faith through allegiance to the Imam and his representatives.

> THE DOCTRINE OFJIHAD IN THE BA.Bl WRITINGS
> The writings of the Bab, with which we shall concern ourselves here, may
> conveniently be divided into two periods: from 1843 to 1848, during the time of
> the Bab's claim to be the 'gate' (bab) and 'remembrance' (dhikr) of the Hidden
> Imam, and his insistence on the observance of Islamic law and practice in
> preparation for the parousia of the 'Lord of the Age', the Imam as Mahdi and
> universal saviour; from 1848 to 1850, the period of the Bab's claims to be the
> Hidden Imam in person and an independent prophet, his instruction to
> abrogate the Islamic legal code, and his elaboration of a Babi code to replace
> it. The first period, in which the jihad element figures largely in written
> doctrine, coincided with the early development of Babism as a schismatic
> movement within the Shaykhi school of Shicism and was characterized by
> extreme pietism and orthodoxy, numerical weakness, and mild persecution in
> one or two isolated instances; the second period, in which jihad plays a less
> significant role, corresponds to the open abandonment oflslam (notably at the
> enclave of some eighty Bahls at Badasht in July 1848) by large numbers of the
> Bab's followers, considerable numerical strength in some areas, and outbreaks
> oflarge-scale struggles between Babi fanatics and Muslim troops and civilians
> leading to the execution of the Bab Uuly 1850), a Babi attempt on the life of
> Na~ir al-Din Shah (August 1852), and the subsequent repression of the
movement within Iran.

The first reasonably systematic elaboration oflslamic law by the Bab in an
> extant work occurs in his early 'commentary' on the twelfth chapter of the
> Qur'an, known as the Qayyiim al-asma'. This work was, apparently, com-
> menced on the evening of the Bab's announcement ofhis first claims (May 22,
> 1844), 53 and, according to some sources, was completed within forty days of
> that date, 54 although the present writer would maintain, on the basis of
> internal evidence, that it may have been completed in the course of the Bab's
> pilgrimage to Mecca in the winter of 1844-45. This work contains fuller
references to jihad than any other of the Bab's writings; these are, for the most

part, concentrated in the later section of the work, but several earlier allusions

to the subject occur in passing. A study of the Qayyiim al-asma' provides us,
> then, with a clear picture of the Bab's attitude to jihad at this early stage of his
career.

The gate and representative of the Imam, the Bab was also, in a sense, the
Imam himself 'in the worlds of command and creation', 55 and, as such, was
> entrusted with a mission on behalf of the Imam to all mankind. 56 He himself
> constantly addresses 'the peoples of the earth' 57 and 'the peoples of East and
> West', 58 and calls on his followers to 'spread the cause to all lands' .59 Towards

> the very beginning of the book, he summons 'the concourse ofkings' to take his
> verses to the Turks and Indians and to lands beyond in the East and West. 60
> God Himself had assured him of sovereignty over all lands and the peoples in
> them, 61 had written down 'the dominion of the earth' for him, 62 and, indeed,
> already ruled the world through him. 63 The Bab, clearly, did not conceive of
> his message as limited to Iran or to the Shici or even the Muslim world, but
> envisioned a universal role for himself complementary to that ofMulfammad
> and the Imams. Since the laws of Mul,iammad and the decrees of the Imams
> were to remain binding 'until the Day of Resurrection', 64 there was no
> question but thatjihad was to be the principal means of bringing men to the
true faith.

The first explicit reference to jihad occurs about a quarter of the way through
> the book, when the Bab speaks of those who have 'repented and turned to God,
> followed the Remembrance (i.e. the Bab) and the Book, and aided the most
> great Remembrance of God in jihad'. 65 T.his passage is followed several lines
> later by what is significantly, the first reference to the notion that 'the victory of
> God and His days are, in the Mother Book, near at hand'. 66 Messianic
> expectation and exhortation to jihad were clearly linked for the Bab in the role

upon it may be purified for the Remnant of God, the Expected One' .69

On the other hand, the Bab anticipatedjihad as one of the events prophesied

> Remembrance, upon crimson thrones, and shall slay you, by the permission of
> God, with our swords, in truth-just as you have disbelieved and turned aside
> from our mighty word (i.e. the Bab)'. 71 The Qayyi.im al-asma' itself was

> 'revealed', it states in one passage, 'in order that men might believe and assist
> him (the Bab) on the day of slaughter'. 72 The Bab himself was, it seems,
> awaiting permission from the Imam to 'rise up in the cause' when the time
came. 73

The regulations governing the conduct of jihad are set out in a number of
> places in the Qayyi.im al-asmii', principally in si.iras 96 to 101. For the most part
> these consist, like a great many passages of the book (notably those dealing

> paper to illustrate all of the Quranic parallels, but we shall attempt to outline
> the main features of the Bab's directions concerningjihad, with brief references
in the notes to what seem to be the Quranic originals, where appropriate.

Sura 96 opens with the words: 'O believers! God has written down for you
> warfare (al-qitiil ) in the path of this mighty Remembrance'. 74 If the believers
> should encounter a party of the unbelievers, they should make their hearts firm
> for meeting God in the hereafter and for its benefits. 75 The Bab himself is told
> by the Imam to spur the believers on in fighting, 76 and he accordingly
> addresses them, telling them not to fear to be slain. 77 There is to be no fighting
> in the four sacred months (i.e. Shawwal, Dhu 'I-Qaeda, Dhu '1-f.Ii.ija, and
> Mul;tarram), 78 and it is expressly forbidden to slay the unbelievers in the
> month ofMul;tarram or in the house of the Kacba. 79 The peoples of East and
> West are to issue forth from their countries in order to assist God, Whose
> victory is stated to be near at hand. 80 Those who fight for God are superior to
> those who sit at home, 81 and those who die as martyrs will receive their due
> reward. 82 The unbelievers have made no compact with the followers (shf a) of
> the Imam and are not to be permitted entry to the sacred territory (around
> Mecca). 83 The believers are to pray, give alms and fight with the un-
> believers,84 and are enjoined to 'conquer the countries and their people for the
> pure faith of God', while being forbidden to accept a submission-tax from the
> unbelievers. 85 The armies of God are not to fear in battle nor are they to leave a
> single unbeliever alive, in order to purify the earth for the coming of the
lmam. 86 Weak men, boys, women, the sick, the blind and the deaf are all

> exempted from fighting in the jihad. 87 The infidels are to be slain anywhere
> except in the .f:laram Mosque (of Mecca). 88 The believers are called on to
> purify their clothing for the day of war and are to issue forth when the trumpet
> sounds. 89 They are, specifically, told to purify the 'holy land' (i.e. Karbala)
> from foulness, 90 and are instructed to 'purchase arms for yourselves for the day
> of gathering together'. 91 Angels will be sent to aid them in battle, 92 and they
are assured that God, not they, shall slay the unbelievers. 93

Two major questions occur at this point in our discussion: against whom did
the Bab envisage waging holy war? And who was to lead the jihad? It is clear

> from the Qayyiim al-asma' that, as in orthodox Shicism, war could be waged
> against several distinct categories of people, although these groups are not at
> all times defined precisely-the QO)lyum al-asma' is not, after all, a work of
> jurisprudence. In general, the terms kuifar and mushrikun, which occur
> through~mt the passages on jihad, may certainly be taken to have their obvious
> meanings of 'unbelievers' or 'polytheists'; strictly speaking, a kajir is one who
> denies the favours or even the existence of God, a mushrik one who 'joins
> partners' with Him. Taken in this sense, these terms would apply, as they
> normally do in Islam, to pagans, Buddhists, Hindus and any others not
> accounted 'people of the book'. These latter, whom the Bab seems to limit to
> Jews and Christians, are certainly condemned in the Qayyum al-asma', 94 but it
> is not until a later date, as we shall see, that the Bab makes clear his intentions
> with regard to them. On the basis of this later attitude, however, we may
> assume that they were regarded in the early period as automatically subject to
> the declaration of jihad, particularly in the absence of any specific command
> abrogating the Islamic injunction to that effect. It is clear from several
> references, however, that the Bab by no means restricted the terms kiifir and
> mushrik to atheists or polytheists, but applied them to Muslims, whether Sunni
> or Shiel, who held what he regarded as heretical doctrines or, more particular-
> ly, who refused to recognize him. 95 In one place, he refers to the 'polytheists'
> (al-mushrikun) from among the people of the Qur'an. 96 He himself is the 'pure
> faith' and those who wish to accept Islam must do so by embracing his cause,
> while the deeds of those who disbelieve in Islam will not be accepted by God. 97
> To disbelieve in him is to disbelieve in MuJ:iammad and the Qur'an (and,
> accordingly, to be considered a non-Muslim) 98 This same idea occurs in an
> earlier work of the Bab's, his commentary on the second sura of the Qur'an
> (Surat al-baqara), where he states that 'not every Muslim is a believer
> (mu'min)', and speaks of the tripartite division of the world into the realms of
faith, Islam and unbelief.99

Leadership of the jihad appears to rest with the Bab himself or with a king
> who fights on his behalf. The believers are to 'assist the mighty Remembrance
> of God in the jihad. 100 As indicated above, the Bab was awaiting permission
from the Imam to 'rise up in the cause'. In the course of the directions on the

> waging ofjihiid, men are called on to 'gather together about the mighty Word,
> around the Remembrance', 101 and the Bab is instructed by the Imam to 'urge
> the believers to fight in your presence' .102 As I have noted elsewhere, 103 news
> reached the early followers of the Bab in the Karbala region of Iraq that, on
> leaving for Mecca in September 1844, he had promised to reveal his cause in
> the holy city, after which he would enter Karbala and fulfil the prophecies. In
> various letters, he summoned his disciples to gather together in Karbala in
> order to aid the Mahdi when he would appear, 104 and, accordingly, large
> numbers of Ba bis headed for Karbala-where there was already a heightened

> sense of messianic expectation and considerable tension-to await the Bab's
> arrival. Many, very possibly in accordance with the Bab's instructions in the
> Qayyiim al-asmii' (which was being distributed in the region) to 'purchase arms
> for the day of gathering together', bought weapons with which to wage the
> anticipated last jihad. In the event, the Bab was unable or unwilling to go to
> Karbala; many of his followers there dispersed, some to await a later summons
tojihiid, others to abandon the Bab as an imposter.

On almost the first page of the Qayyiim al-asma', the Imam calls on the
> reigning monarch oflran, Mu}:iammad Shah (to whom he refers as 'king of the
> Muslims') to come to the aid of the Bab, warns him not to oppose him, asks
> him to purify Karbala of those who have rejected the previous book 'on the day
> when the Remembrance shall come suddenly', and urges him to 'submit to the
> Remembrance and his cause and to conquer the countries of the earth for the
> truth, by God's permission' . 105 When the Bab's first disciple, Mulla I:Iusayn
> Bushrii'i, travelled to Tehran on the Bab's behalf in 1844, he attempted to
> deliver a copy of the Qayyiim al-asma' and other works of the Bab to
> M u}:iammad Shah. Also in his possession was a letter from the Bab to the king:
> I ctic;lad al-Sal~ana, a state official, writes that this letter contained a passage
> stating 'if you pledge allegiance to me and regard obedience to me as
> obligatory, then shall I make your sovereignty great and bring the foreign
> powers under your command' .106 In a further letter, written to MuJ:iammad
> Shah from Biishihr in 1845, the Bab writes that 'God, your Lord, has willed
> that the Turks (al-Rum) and most of the peoples of the earth should believe in
> the verses; aid, then, the faith of God, that you may be of those who are
> triumphant on the Day of Resurrection' . 107 The Bab continued to write letters
> to the Shah, but later examples of these, written from prison in Adharbayjan,
> indicate that the king's consistent rejection of the Bab and his instructions to
> have him imprisoned had dashed any hopes the latter might have entertained
> that he would adopt the role of royal warrior on behalf of the Babi cause.
> Nevertheless, as we shall see shortly, the Bab's later views on jihad centred very
> much on the hope that a Babi monarch would arise to carry out the task of
converting mankind to his religion.

The Bab's views about military assistance for the jihad from the state seem to

defendants at the shrine ofShaykh Tabarsi

The Bab next attempted a fairly systematic discussion of the regulations
> concerning jihad in his Risala furiY al-cAdliyya, written in late 1261/1845 or
> 1262/ 1846, while he was living in Shiraz after his return from the pilgrimage to
> Mecca. The sixth chapter of this work is devoted entirely to jihad; briefas it is,
> it provides several details as to the early Babi doctrine of jihad which do not
> appear in the Qayyiim al-asma'. At the beginning-and most significantly-he
> states that jihad is one of the branches (furiic) ofreligion and that it resembles
> formal prayer. 110 This is important in that it indicates that the Bab explicitly
> raised jihad to the rank of a sixth pillar of the faith. He then refers to the idea
> that, when God sent Mul:iammad, it was with five swords, and that three of
> these would not be returned to their scabbards until war came to an end. This
> would not happen until the sun rose from the west. The first of these swords
> was that drawn against the pagan Arabs, who were given a choice between
> death and conversion. 111 The second sword was that drawn against the Jews
> and Christians; the Bab quotes a Quranic verse (9:29) in this connection: 'fight
> those who do not believe in God nor in the Last Day, who do not make
> unlawful what God and His Prophet have made unlawful and who do not
> practice the true religion, yet are of those to whom the Book has been
> given-until they pay the tribute out of hand and are brought low'. He then
> states that the Imam or his representatives have the authority to accept this
> tribute from the rich but not the poor, the stupid or the insane. 112 The third
> sword is that drawn against the peoples of the earth; the Bab again quotes a
> Quranic verse (4 7:4): ' (when you meet the unbelievers) smite their necks until,
> when you have made a great slaughter among them, make fast the bonds; then
> either act with liberality afterwards or take a ransom (until the war comes to
an end)'. These too have a choice only between conversion and death. 113

The Bab then goes on to say that, after these three swords, there is that
drawn against the 'people of dissent'. This position is supported, like the

> others, by a Quranic verse (49:9) 'If two groups among the believers fall to
> fighting one another, make peace between them; but if one should act unjustly
> [from the same root as the term here translated 'dissenter'] against the other,
> then fight the unjust one until it returns to the cause of God'. cAli and the
> Imams fought according to the decree in this verse and the hidden Imam shall
> slay the dissenters on the strength of it when he appears. 114 jihad is not
> permitted to anyone except the Imam, unless he gives permission. 115 The fifth
> sword is sheathed for the purpose of punishment, as indicated in the Quranic
> verse (5:45): 'We wrote down for them in it (the Torah): "a life for a life, an eye

> for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and retaliation
> for wounds"-but whoever remits it as alms shall have it as an expiation. They
> who do not judge according to what God has sent down are unbelievers' . 116
> The decree on this matter rests with the Imam. Whoever denies these swords is
> an unbeliever; the decrees concerning them show that the ordinance ofjihad is
binding on whoever believes in God and His verses. 117

Up to 1264/1848, 'Bab!' doctrine was essentially that of orthodox Shicism,
> with differences only in some subsidiary matters and then only to a limited
> degree. From 1848, however, following the Bab's assumption of the office of
> Qa'im (i.e. the Mahdi) and his announcement of the inauguration of the
> Resurrection, the entire system of Islamic revealed law had to be dismantled
> and a new Babi structure erected in its place. As far as jihad is concerned, the
> proclamation of Resurrection and the substitution of a new code of laws for
> those of the Qur'an and traditions meant a sharp change in practice together
> with various doctrinal changes which remained theoretical. We shall discuss
> the practical consequences of the announcement that the Qa'im had appeared
> in the next section of this article; let us continue for the moment with our
> survey of the doctrinal basis for jihad in the Babi writings. The main laws of
Babism following the break with Islam are contained in the Persian Bayan

(Bayan-i-FarsZ), the much shorter, telescoped Arabic Bayan (al-Bayan al-
> eArabi), both written during the Bab's imprisonment in Makii between 1847
> and 1848, and the Haykal al-din, an extremely late work which effectively
> represents the Bab's final thoughts on these matters. Since neither of the latter
> two works adds anything particularly remarkable on this subject, however, we
> shall refer the reader in the footnotes to passages in them paralleling those of
the Persian Bayan.

In keeping with the discursive, allusive, even rambling style of this work, no
particular section of the Persian Bqyan is exclusively devoted to jihad, nor is
there, indeed, any specific injunction to wage jihad, in terms comparable to

those found in the Qur'an or the Qayyiim al-asma'. Nevertheless, several pas-
> sages exist which rest on the assumption that jihad may be waged, while others
command it in a form very different to that of the Quranic injunctions. The

> later Babi doctrine ofjihii.d rests largely on a passage in section 5 chapter 5, in

> which it states that 'the possessors of power (i.e. kings) must not wait for
something to descend from heaven in order to bring all that are on earth into

the faith of God, but it should be as all entered the faith in Islam, by reason of
> what was shown forth at the command of the Prophet of God; in every
> dispensation this must be shown forth in this way' .11 8 Had the kings oflslam
> acted on the commandments of the Qur'an, the whole earth would have been
> converted. 119 It is made a duty for every king who believes in the Bayiin not to
> allow any unbeliever to live in his country, with the exception of traders, who
> bring benefits. 120 This duty is also incumbent on all men. 121 Elsewhere, the

> person who is an unbeliever? 122 Permission is given to conquer other countries
> in order to bring men into the faith, although, if possible, other means should
> be used to convert people, such as giving them the goods of the world. 123 It is,
> nevertheless, made clear that the prohibition on killing which is laid down in
> the Bayiin applies only to the murder ofbelievers. 124 In every dispensation, it is
> said, no-one has the right to anything, not even his own life, if he does not
> believe, and the same applies in the Babi dispensation. As a result, the
> property of unbelievers may be taken by the Ba bis and only returned to them if
> they convert. This decree is only to be carried out by the kings. 125 Detailed
> instructions are given concerning the distribution of property taken from
> unbelievers, as follows: whatever is unique belongs to the Bab, while he lives;
> on his death, it is to be kept by traders 'until the rising of the sun' (the
> appearance of the messianic figure whose advent at a distant date the Bab
> alluded to); one fifth of the total value of other goods must be given to the
> Letters of the Living (i.e. the body of the Bab's chief disciples, originally
> eighteen in number) to spend on the believers; the remainder goes to the
> general of the victorious army and to those who have assisted him, each
> according to his station and needs; if there is any left, it is to be spent on the
> holy shrines, or else all the believers are to be given a share, this latter course
> being preferable unless a given shrine has not yet been erected, in which case

> what wider implications: believers are forbidden to have arms or armour
> except in time of need or holy war (mujiihada), unless, of course, they are
engaged in their manufacture. 127

Jihad, it would seem, could be waged against any group who did not believe
> in the Bayan; the questions of unbelief, Islam, faith, dissidence, and so forth no
> longer apply here since the entire non-Babi world is now the 'realm of
> unbelief. In the Haykal al-dzn, the Babi monarch of the future is exhorted 'not
> to leave upon the earth, if possible, anyone save the Babis', 128 while in the
> Dala'il-i sabca, written in Maku, the Bab states with regard to the Jews and
Christians that 'unless a powerful king shall cause them to enter the faith of

The Babi Concept of Holy War   109

> God, there shall be no way for their salvation' .129 The Shiel population oflran
> was now regarded as subject to the decree of holy war: in the Persian and
> Arabic Bayans, the Bab explicitly states that God as forbidden non-Bahls to
> live in the five central provinces of Iran (Fars, Iraq, Adharbayjan, Khurasan
> and Mazandaran), since it was from these areas that the faith spread to other
> lands. 130 0 bviously, the Shiel inhabitants of these regions would either have to
be expelled by force from their homes or converted.

The regulations in the Bayan and elsewhere are part of a generally harsh
policy on the part of the Bab towards all that did not belong to the true faith.

not to marry them. 135

We see, then, that the Bab had, by the end of his short life, moved beyond

> Despite the exhortations to jihad in the Qayyum al-asma' and the abortive

> Karbala in 1845, it soon became clear to both the Bab and the Bab! leadership

> action-although, as we shall see, tension between them and non-believers
> was slowly building up and many of the faithful were actively preparing
> themselves both mentally and physically for an imminent struggle. In the
> meantime, the Bab instructed his followers to confront their opponents in
> mubahala, a form of trial by faith in which two parties would call down the
> wrath of God on each other. 138 This practice was not uncommon in Shi eism
and had been used by the Shaykhi leader Sayyid Ka~im Rash ti as, in his view,

> the only valid means of putting claims to the truth to the test. 139 The Islamic
> practice was ratified early in Qayyum al-asma', where the Imam instructs the
> Bab to challenge the unbelievers to mubahala if things should become difficult
for him. 140

The earliest recorded instance ofa challenge issued on the directions of the
> Bab took place when his emissary, Mulla cAli Bas!ami, arrived in Iraq in the
> autumn of 1844. According to one source, Mulla cAli had been instructed by
> the Bab to summon a meeting of the religious leaders in Karbala and to issue
> such a challenge to them. 141 While in Mecca on pilgrimage, the Bab himself

> issued a mubahala challenge to two leading Shaykhi scholars from Karbala who
> were also on pilgrimage at that time. 142 In 1262/1846 in l~fahan, the Bab
> challenged the religious leaders of the city to present themselves for mubahala
> on the day ofc Arafa (9 Dhu 'l-l:Iijja/28 November), although they did not, in
> fact, respond. 143 It seems probable that, when he wrote to the clergy ofQazvin
> during his stay at the nearby village ofSiyah-dihan in 1847, calling on them to
> meet with him, he had in mind the possibility of engaging in mubahala with
> them. 144 This may also have been his purpose in requesting MuJ:iammad Shah
> in 1264/1848 to summon the clergy of the country to meet with him so that he
might 'confound' them. 145

The Bab encouraged his followers to adopt the same course of action as a
> means of seeking non-violent confrontation with a numerically and psycho-
> logically more powerful opposition. He himself refers to a mubahala challenge
> issued on his behalf, probably sometime in 1845, by Mulla MuJ:iammad
> Mahdi Khu'i to Mulla cAbd al-c AliHarati, an early apostate from Babism. 146
> In 1846, following instructions from the Bab, Qurrat al-cAyn (one of his
> leading disciples, a woman noted for her intransigence and irascibility) called
> a meeting of the religious scholars and leading divines of Karbala in order to
> challenge them either to produce verses like those of the Bab or to engage in
> mubiihala; 147 although the meeting never took place, she remained eager for
> such a direct confrontation and, in 1847, while in Baghdad, wrote a letter to
> the Shici clergy there, in which she said 'if you are not satisfied with these
> conclusive proofs, I challenge you to mubahala' .148 Again, in Kirmanshah in
> the same year, she issued a challenge to the culama of the city to meet with her
for mubahala-'and let the curse of God fall on those who speak falsely' .149

Al though mubahala functioned in theory as a means of a voiding unnecessary
> physical conflict in situations of religious disagreement, relying for its
> effectiveness on psychological and social pressure, it did not always succeed in
> its aim. Relations between Shaykhis and other Shiels had, for a period of about
> twenty years, been extremely tense and occasional violence had broken out
> when feelings ran high. Now, the introduction of a new and even more
> apparently heretical element into the situation added fuel to the fire. The
Ba bis themselves pulled few punches in their letters and sermons and, in some

The Babi Concept ef Holy War   111

> cases even threatened physical violence against those who would not accept
> their message. Thus, for example, Mulla Muf.iammad cAli Qazvini, one of the
> Bab's original hierarchy of 'Letters of the Living' and a brother-in-law of the
> fiery Quarrat al-cAyn, wrote to his aged father that, ifhe did not accept the
Bab's message, he would break his neck 'like a dog' .150

The preaching ofBabism sometimes led to physical assaults being made on
> individual Bab! propagandists, either spontaneously by their audience or on
> the instructions of the civil or religious authorities. Thus, Mulla c Ali Bas~ami,
> the Bab's legate to Iraq, was handled roughly by the followers of the out-

> standing scholar Shaykh Muf.iammad l;lasan al-Najafi, 151 arrested by the civil
> authorites in Karbala, imprisoned and tried in Baghdad, and finally sent to
> Istanbul, where he was sentenced to labour in the docks. 152 Mulla

> cAli Akbar Ardistani caused an uproar in one of the mosques ofShiraz in 1845,
> were arrested on the instigation of some of the local clergy, punished and
> expelled from the city by the governor. 153 In 1847, Mulla Ibrahim Maf.iallati
> was badly beaten by the pupils of the leading cleric ofHamadan, on the latter's
> instructions. 154 In the same year, Mullajalil Uriimi, a 'Letter of the Living'
> who had been teaching Babism secretly for some years in Qazvin, was taken by
> a mob to the house of Mulla Muf.iammad Taqi Baraghani, where he was
> bastinadoed. 155 In 1846 in Karbala, Qurrat al-cAyn was arrested and her
> house looted by a mob acting on the orders of the governor, in order to prevent
> an outbreak of more serious trouble by reason of her open expression of what
> were regarded as unusually extreme views. 156 In Kirmanshah, despite the
> favourable attitude of the governor, she and her followers were attacked,
> beaten and expelled from the town by a force independently organized.by the
> local military commander, who appears to have been bribed to act by relatives
> of Qurrat al-c Ayn from Qazvin. 157 During the mubiihala period, therefore,
> outbreaks of limited violence between Babis and non-Babis began to grow in

Leaving aside the many historical questions raised by this whole incident-

> relevant to the question of the motivation of the Babi insurgents at Zanjan
> and Nayriz, whom we shall discuss a little later.

In the fi-rst months of 1848, towards the end of his confinement in Maku, the
> Bab wrote an important letter to Mulla Shaykh cAliTurshizi cA~im, in which
> he proclaimed himself to be the Qa'im and announced the abrogation of the
> laws of Islam. On the Bab's instructions, cA~im copied and circulated this
> letter, and it would seem that news of the inception of the Resurrection spread
> rapidly among the Babis of Iran. 170 At an enclave held at the village of
> Badasht in Mazandaran in July 1848, several Babi leaders, including the
> controversial and iconoclastic Qurrat al-c Ayn, openly announced the advent
> of the Resurrection to some eighty of their followers. 171 Among those who
> played an active role at this gathering was Mulla MuJ:iammad cAli Barfuriishi,
> who was later to take effective control of the fort at Shaykh Tabarsi. It is, I
> think, unnecessary to labour the point that the advent of the Qa'im had long
> been regarded as the signal for the finaljihiid against the hosts ofunbeliefand
> that the Bab's followers had been daily expecting such apocalyptic upheavals
for some four years.

An unforeseen problem existed, however, in the fact that the Bab was still in
> prison and, therefore, unable to lead the jihad in person, as was proper. The
> Ba bis gathered at Badasht had, in fact, as one of their aims the possibility of
> formulating plans for the release of their chieffrom Chihriq, where he was now
> held; 172 Avara maintains that they decided to send out messengers to summon
> the Bab's followers to go to Chihriq as pilgrims---once there, it was proposed
> that they should try to exert pressure on Mul}.ammad Shah to free the Bab,
> failing which they intended to take the latter from his confinement by force. 173
> It has been plausibly suggested by A.L.M. Nicolas that, when Mulla l:lusayn
> Bushrii'i and his force left Mashhad about this time, it was with the aim of
> heading ultimately for Adharbayjan, in the hope of effecting the Bab's
rescue. 174

It is vital to bear in mind, however, that the Bab's particular role was far
> from clear to his followers and that Babism in this period was far from being a
> doctrinally homogeneous movement. Babi leaders such as Qurrat al-c Ayn,
> Bushru'i, Quddiis, I:Iujjat Zanjani, and others were accorded considerable
> respect and veneration and were regarded by many as incarnations of the
Imams or other sacred figures of Shiel' hagiography. It is significant to note in

> the present context that Bushrii'i is referred to consistently by Zavara'i as 'the
> Qa'im of Khurasan' and Mulla MuJ:iammad cAll Quddiis as 'the Qa'im of
> Jllan' .175 The latter in particular. seems to have been widely regarded as
> holding the station of Qa'im: Bushrii'i is reported as saying in a sermon that
> Quddiis was 'the one whose advent you have awaited for one thousand two
> hundred and sixty years', 176 while the latter is stated to have advanced this
> claim in his own behalf1 77 or even, according to the Baha'i patriarch cAbbas
> Effendi, to have claimed to be God in his (no longer extant) commentary on
> the letter ~ad of the divine name al-$amad, written mostly in Shaykh Tabarsi. 178

As Qa'im, whether in a universal or restricted sense, it was held to be
> legitimate for these two men to lead their followers in jihad. That this was not
> merely Zavara'i's personal view is indicated by several references in Lu~fc All
> Mirza's history. The latter notes, for example, that some of the Babis at
> Shaykh Tabarsi regarded Quddiis as the point towards which prayers were to
> be directed and turned to him when they performed their devotions; on the
> night of the cfd al-Qurban, Mulla J:Iusayn Bushrii'i and others performed
> ritual circumambulation around the house ofQuddiis, a practice which they
continued on other nights. 179 The Kitab-i nuq{at al-kaj, written in the early

l 850's, similarly-speaks of Quddiis and Bushrii'i in terms such as these: the
> former is stated to have claimed to be the return of MuQ.ammad 180 or of
> Jes us, 181 and is referred to as the 'promised Qa'im', whose gate was
> the Bab. 182 The latter is consistently spoken of as 'the Prince of Martyrs',
> identifying him with the Imam J:Iusayn, 183 is said to have been given the rank
> of bah in 1848 by the Bab, 184 and is described as the 'bearer ofYemeni pillar'
> and the 'fourth support', the first a term from Shici apocalypse, the second a
> Shaykhi designation for the representative of the Imam on earth. 184 Bushrii'i's
> messianic role was considerably enhanced by his carrying of a black banner on
> his journey from Khurasan, 186 a gesture whose significance would hardly have
> been missed by anyone even vaguely familiar with Shiel prophetic traditions.
> Even the enemies of the Babis were given eschatological roles to play, most
> notably Sacid al-cUlama, the leading cleric of Barfuriish and the man res-
> ponsible for the execution ofQuddiis there at the end of the Shaykh Tabarsi
> siege, who is described as the 'bearded woman' who, it was prophesied, would
kill the Qa'im. 187

It is impossible to tell what may have been in Bushrii'i's mind as he left
> Mashhad. In all likelihood, he aimed at meeting his associate Mulla
> Mu]:iammad cAll and others at Badasht, but the meeting there had been
> broken up and dispersed by local residents by the time the contingent from

Chihriq in order to effect an immediate rescue. Bushrii'i seems to have been

> Makki, a resident of Karbala, and to say that they were all headed for the
> shrines in Iraq, with various pretexts to explain their choice of such an unlikely
route. 188

Whatever their immediate aims, it is clear that the Babis under the leader-
> ship ofBushrii'i harboured general hopes of spreading Bab ism, by preaching if
> possible, by force if necessary. In the course of a sermon on the Ac;IJ:ia festival
> ( 10 Dhii '1-l:Iijja/8 November), Bushrii'i stated that his aim in leaving

> Mashhad had been to exalt 'the word of God' and to seek martyrdom. 189 Some
> time later, a more militant tone can be observed in his reply to the new
> governor of Mazandaran, Mahdi Quli Mirza, who had enquired as to the
> motives of the Babis. They had come from Mashhad, said Bushru'i, with the
> aim of spreading the truth, in whatever way might prove possible, whether by
> overcoming falsehood (apparently in argument) or by means of the sword or
> by suffering martyrdom. 190 In this same reply, he refused to leave
> Mazandaran as requested by the prince, stating that 'until the cause of God is
> manifested, we shall not depart from this province; we shall make manifest
> God's cause by means of the sword' and that 'we few companions who are here
> shall not disperse until we have overcome all (of you) or have ourselves been
> slain'. 191 Lutf cAli Mirza goes on to describe how, in his communications with
> the prince, Bushrii'i referred to Na~ir al-Din Shah as a 'puppy', made threats
of terror and sent harsh messages. 192

The twin themes of martyrdom andJihiid alternate throughout the Shyakh
> Tabarsi struggle. Shortly after their arrival at the shrine, Bushru'i addressed
> his followers, comparing their intention to reveal the truth through martyr-
> dom with events in the time of the Imam I:Iusayn (martyred in 680) .193
> According to Zavara'i, Quddus stated that his followers were the army of
> l:Iusayn and the enemy the army of Kufa 194 (a reference to the debacle of
> Karbala when I:Iusayn and a small band offollowers were massacred almost to
> a man by imperial troops loyal to the Caliph Yazid, against whom the Imam
> was rebelling). This same theme recurs in most later accounts. 195 Evocation of
> the Karbala motif provided an excellent focus for a drive towards charismatic
> martyrdom and Jihiid against the Qajar state, identified with the Umayyad
> dynasty against which I:Iusayn had rebelled. 196 The death of Mul:tammad
> Shah in September 1848 was regarded by the Bahls as a cause for rejoicing:
> 'praise be to God, the foul tree has gone to hell', 197 but, while Na~ir al-Din
> remained on the throne, true government could not be es.tablished. According
> to the author of the Nuqtat al-kiij, Quddus wrote to Prince Mahdi Qull Mirza,
> stating that 'Nasir al-Din Shah is a false king and his helpers shall be punished
> in the fires of God; we are the true sovereign, who seek for the good-pleasure of
God'.198

Our sources contain numerous explicit references to the struggles of the
> Babis with both local residents and state troops as jihad. Refused entry to
Barfuriish by the inhabitants of the town, the Babis 'began to wage jihad' and

> succeeded in killing over one hundred and fifty of the enemy. 199 Throughout
> Zavara'i's account, the Babis are described as being 'engaged in jihad' ,200
> while Bushrii'i orders them to 'fight the holy war'. 201 The purpose of this jihad
> is to 'empty the earth of corruption', 202 while the enemy troops are variously
> described as 'unbelievers', 'hypocrites', and 'polytheists' 203 or as 'the forces of
> Satan' and the 'army of satans'. 204 Although LutfcAli Mirza uses the term

jihad very little, he ascribes to Bushrii'i an interesting speech in which he states

> that 'now two matters are determined: one is jihad, the other defence. Whoever
> turns aside is an unbeliever'. 205 'Whoever turns his back onjihad, he goes on,

believers. 207

It seems clear, then, that the Bahis at Shaykh Tabarsi harboured a variety of

There were two further major outbreaks of violence between Babis and
Muslims in Iran after the suppression of the Shaykh Tabarsi rising in May

> 1849. The number ofBabis in the country was growing rapidly; in February
> 1849, Prince Dolgorukov, the Russian Minister in Tehran, wrote to his
> Minister for Foreign Affairs: ' ... no matter how serious this question (the
> military rebellion in Khurasan) may be, it has not preoccupied society to the
> same extent ever since the sectaries of the Bab have apparently had the
> tendency to grow in all parts of the Kingdom. The Amir (the new Prime
> Minister, Amir-i Kabir) confessed to me that their number can be already put
> at 100,000; that they have already appeared in southern provinces; that they
> are to be found in large numbers in Tehran itself; and that, finally, their

> presence in Adharbayjan is beginning to worry him very much'. 208 This figure
> of 100,000 is, curiously, the same as that given by the Bab himself in the
> Dala'il-i sab'a as having been converted during the first four years of his
> career. 209 In Dolgorukov's report of February 1849, he referred to rumours
> that the numbers of Ba bis in Zanjan to the west of the capital had reached 800
> and that 'by their presence, they threaten to disrupt the public order'. 210 By
> March 1850, Dolgorukov reported that the number of Babis there was now
> 2000, and noted that 'the harmful doctrines of these dangerous sectaries find a
> response among the masses and do not cease to worry the government'. 211

According to cAbd al-Atiad Zanjani, the number ofBabis in Zanjan rose to
> 3000 before trouble broke out. 212 Leadership of the sect there was in the
> hands of Mulla Mutiammad cAli Zanjani, a religious firebrand who had
> already fallen foul of the secular authorities well before his conversion to
> Babism. 213 Following his adoption of the new faith, his position was inves-
> tigated by the authorities at Tehran, but he seems to have been able to
> persuade them of his loyalty to Islam and to the state and was allowed to
> return to Zanjan. 214 It soon became apparent that his role as the Bab's
> representative in the city threatened the existing religious and civil authorities.
> Shortly after his return, he assumed the functions oflmam-Jumca (the leader
> of the main Friday prayers), a position normally conferred by the ruling
> sovereign; the incumbent naturally protested, but was told that his right to the

> This behaviour led to further protests on the part of the local clergy, and

> were based on instructions of the Bab. 216 In the autumn of 1848, however, he
> contrived to make his escape from the capital following the death of
Mutiammad Shah. 217

Back in Zanjan, it was clear that he aimed at the institution of radical
> changes in the city. According to cAbd al-Atiad Zanjani, the poor sat on the
> right side of the pulpit in his mosque and the rich on the left, while he
> consistently addressed himself to the poor. 218 He was as impatient as ever of
> the existing religious and secular powers. Following an incident in which two
> Ba bis stabbed a Muslim in the course of an altercation, one Ba bi, named cAbd
> al-c Ali, was arrested and imprisoned on the orders of Amir Aslan Khan, the
> governor. After a month, Zanjani wrote to the governor demanding the release
of this man, but was curtly refused on the grounds that this amounted to

> interference in the affairs of the local administration. A second demand was
> also refused, whereupon Zanjani's agent forcibly freed the Babi prisoner,
> releasing at the same time other criminals held in the local gaol and
threatening to kill anyone who tried to intervene. The whole episode received

the approval of Zanjani. 219 Following this incident, a decree for the death of
> Zanjani and his followers was written by the local religious leaders and sent to
the capital for ratifiction by Na~ir al-Din Shah. 220 On 16 May 1850, fighting

> broke out between a mob organized by the clergy and a small force ofBabis, in
> the course of which one of the latter was killed. 221 At some point, the clergy

declared jihad against the Babis-on which cAbd al-A}:iad Zanjani remarks

> that 'had this religious war been against such as denied their faith, and law,
> and scripture, there had been no harm; but this war was against those who
> cried like themselves: "There is no god but God, Mu}:iammad is the Apostle of
God, cAli is the Friend of God!" ' 222

It certainly appears that, even before his conversion to Babism, Zanjani had

answers to the questions raised here.

Following the first outbreak of trouble mentioned above, the governor of

jihad as such to be possible. 229

This seems to me to be an over-simplification. If the Babis were not fighting
some kind ofjihad, then their action could not be justified or rendered legal in

> any way and would be regarded simply as rebellion. Now, this was certainly

choice but to defend ourselves?' 230

The Yazd and Nayriz upheavals of 1850, led by Sayyid Ya[,tya Darabi

In conclusion, then, we may note that in no instance do the Babis seem to
have declared offensive jihad along the lines suggested in the Qayyiim al-asma',

stability, and their generally aggressive manner resulted in clashes between

> them and the civilian population which quickly escalated into full-scale
> struggles. Once battle was joined, religious motifs of martyrdom, defensive
jihad and 'perfecting the proof (i.e. demonstrating the truth of the cause in the

> eyes of men) took precedence over social, economic and other features. In the
> case ofShaykh Tabarsi, religious motives seem to have predominated from the
> beginning, whereas in the cases of Zanjan, Yazd and Naryiz, existing urban
> tensions played a central role which at times obscures the religious elements of
> these struggles. From the point of view of both local and national government,
> the Babis were manifestly insurrectionaries bent on subverting the existing
> religious and social order. The role ofjihad in these struggles is, then, obscured
> by a multiplicity of motives and by the inability of the Babis to transform merely
> local upheavals into a more widely-based revolutionary struggle against the
> forces of unbelief. The Ba bi ideal jihad, as represented in the works of the Bab,
> and the reality, as seen at Shaykh Tabarsi, Nayriz and Zanjan, were certainly
> not commensurate, and failure, once it came, was complete and permanent.
