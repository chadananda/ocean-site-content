The Birth of the Human Being:
Beyond Religious Traditionalism
and Materialist Modernity
NADER SAIEDI

According to the worldview of the Bahá’í Faith we have arrived at a
turning point in the evolution of human history. This turning point is
primarily the moment of the birth of the human being. In this paper I will
first define what I mean by “the birth of the human being” and its oppo-
site concept, namely, the logic of dehumanization. Then I will trace the
development of this idea in the Writings of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

THE BIRTH OF THE HUMAN BEING

Human history so far has been primarily a history of dehumanization. We
humans have perceived neither others nor ourselves as human beings and
therefore we have treated each other as objects and animals. Dehuman-
ization is the process through which human beings are reduced to the
level of nature, objects, and physical bodies. Humans as humans, however,
are defined by their consciousness, their reason, their spiritual powers and
perfections.

We can begin our discussion by referring to two symbols of the birth
of the human being. The first is the ancient symbol of Egyptian culture,
the sphinx. This enigmatic symbol has been interpreted in various ways.
But from a dialectical perspective, the sphinx represents the meaning and

2              The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

purpose of human history. The sphinx denotes a being whose body is an
animal while his face is human. In other words, the purpose of history is
the emergence of the human being out of the realm of nature.1 The
human being is a natural being which is the vehicle for the realization of
consciousness, spirit, and moral attributes. The emergence of a human
face—symbolizing reason and spirit—out of the physical and biological
background of humans is the emergence of the truth of the human being.
Unfortunately, throughout history we have treated humans not as beings
with a “human face” but rather as natural, biological, and animal beings.

The second symbol is a modern principle formulated in the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh. He presents a new definition of the human being and further
elaborates on that definition by discussing the true basis of human honor,
morality, and identity:

That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the serv-
> ice of the entire human race. The Great Being saith: Blessed and
> happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples
> and kindreds of the earth. In another passage He hath proclaimed: It
> is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather
> for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country,
> and mankind its citizens. (Tablets 167)

In this statement Bahá’u’lláh identifies the human being as one who is
characterized not by the will to domination but by dedication to the uni-
versal interests of the entire human race. Universalistic orientation of
service is the defining feature of the human being. In this statement, a
social and political interpretation of Darwinism which finds human socie-
ty a jungle of struggle for existence is replaced by a consciousness of the
oneness of humanity, an attitude of service to all human beings, and a
morality that is not based upon naturalistic ties of kinship, blood, or habit.
That is why Bahá’u’lláh immediately identifies a new sense of morality.

According to Durkheim, the boundary of morality is the boundary of
the social group. Human beings identify themselves collectively in terms
of their own group and follow a moral double standard in their behavior

The Birth of the Human Being                         3

towards insiders and outsiders. People outside the group become
strangers, objects, and enemies whose domination, enslavement, plunder,
and murder are perceived as heroic moral acts. In fact, the premodern def-
inition of human beings was primarily based upon such a conception of
humans as members of specific communities and their sense of natural
belongingness to the group. However, this “social belongingness” was
based upon naturalistic feelings, ties of kinship, and habits of everyday
interaction. Such a naturalistic morality was a pact of collective violence
against other groups. Rejecting that premodern definition of the human
being, Bahá’u’lláh proposes a new sense of morality and honor based upon
the universal and rational concept of humanity. We now leave the realm of
natural feelings and enter the realm of spirit. Honor is not for the one who
loves his own country but rather for the one who loves the entire human
race. Such a novel framework requires a new conception of identity, in
which human beings are not defined in terms of opposition to others but
instead by their mutual interdependence and symbiosis. The entire planet
Earth becomes the home and neighborhood of a person: the earth is but
one country, and mankind its citizens.

An investigation of various forms of oppression in human history
demonstrates that most forms of oppression are products of the reduction
of human beings to the level of nature—treating them as objects and ani-
mals. For example, the caste system in India has been an extreme form of
the culture of class and status inequality that has existed almost every-
where on this planet. The caste system reduces humans to the level of their
natural and biological characteristics. The rights, value, and opportunities
of a human are defined by the biological accident of one’s family of birth.
The fact that a person is born within a particular family is the sole deter-
minant of the person’s identity, truth, and worth. What is missing in the
caste system is the consciousness of the human being as a spiritual being,
with consciousness and reason. Likewise, any society in which the destiny
of individuals is strongly determined by the class position of the parent is
by definition a dehumanizing society. In such a society, individuals are not
treated according to their human characteristics, but rather they are pre-
destined to occupy specific social roles on the basis of their birth family.

4             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

Racism is another form of this dehumanization. Racism is primarily a
form of culture and consciousness which reduces the value, identity, and
social rights of a human being to the color of that person’s skin. Racist
consciousness is impossible without the reduction of humans to the level
of nature, biology, and physical attributes.

Patriarchy is another universal form of dehumanization. It is ultimately
a systematic culture of dehumanization where the value, worth, and the
rights of human beings are determined by their specific biological features
as male or female. Patriarchy means a systematic inability to recognize
humans as human beings, as spirit, as consciousness, as spiritual powers.

One other extreme form of dehumanization is slavery. The institution
of slavery, which has existed systematically both in the West and in the
East, is nothing but a reduction of the human being to the level of an
object. The human being becomes an object devoid of will and conscious-
ness which can be owned and treated without his or her consent, simply
by the will of the slave owner. This is an extreme form of the type of the
relationship that Martin Buber calls the “I-It relationship.”

There are, however, many forms of the dehumanization process that are
so habituated and ingrained in the consciousness of people that their
dehumanizing logic is hardly perceived. The most influential of these
institutionalized forms of the reduction of humans to the level of objects
is the most powerful basis of identity in the modern world, namely, nation-
alism. The modern nation-state has brought with it a conception of
national citizenship that assigns certain rights to individual members of
the nation-state and treats them as persons endowed with rights. In this
sense, nationalism may seem to be a force of humanization. However, while
such national citizenship has become a force of entitlement to rights, it has
also become a force of exclusion of rights.

Sociology, which is my area of study, has always been interested in study-
ing forms of inequality and oppression. However, due to its nineteenth-
century legacy, sociology usually identifies society with the nation-state.
Therefore social theory has become primarily a study of nation-states,
ignoring the relations among these nations. Consequently sociology has
been preoccupied with explaining oppression in terms of class, gender,

The Birth of the Human Being                          5

and ethnic inequalities. The problem with this approach is that in our glob-
alized world the most important basis of social inequality for human beings
is national citizenship. Citizenship—and not the class position or ethnicity
or sex of a person—is the most powerful and effective predictor of the life
chances of a person today. If a child, by mere accident, is born in a rich
country, he or she is entitled to various rights, which will define the pros-
pects of access to the resources of the world for that child. However, if a
child, again by a pure and ethically meaningless natural accident, is born in
a poor country, that child will be deprived of access to various resources
and may never have an opportunity to escape poverty. Nationalism, in other
words, reduces humans to their place of birth and defines their rights in
terms of such a naturalistic variable. However, this fundamental basis of
inequality, exclusion, discrimination, and oppression is considered by
humanity as just, normal, and natural. In fact, it is the biggest hypocrisy of
modern humanity that it talks of inalienable human rights and yet simul-
taneously considers the nationalistic exclusion of rights and opportunities
on the basis of citizenship as normal, natural, and just.

From a Bahá’í point of view, the truth of all religions is the rejection of
a culture of dehumanization. The followers of past religions, however,
have usually failed to understand their own spiritual truth, and therefore
their history was degraded to another experience of dehumanization.

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was released from prison one hundred years ago,
He traveled to Egypt, Europe, and the United States to bring this message
of humanization to various parts of the East and the West. In His lectures
He frequently emphasized a new interpretation of an old religious idea.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá often referred to the passage at the beginning of the Torah
in which God declares that He has created humans “in our image” (Gen.
1:26). This biblical statement is accepted and confirmed in both
Christianity and Islam. However, the progressive nature of this founda-
tional statement was only unveiled by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. According to Him,
the idea that humans are made in the image of God is a call for rejection
of all forms of dehumanization. For example, can a person who really
believes in this statement also believe in patriarchy and consider men to
be superior to women? The answer is a categorical no. The reason is that

6               The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

according to this statement the identity and truth of humans is defined by
their spiritual nature, the fact that humans are in the image of God.
Patriarchy reduces the rights, value, and social position of human beings
to their biological and reproductive characteristics. This move can only
make sense if we believe that God is a body, and that He is either male or
female. It is of course clear that God is defined precisely by His transcen-
dence from any of these physical and natural characteristics. Therefore if
one believes in the biblical statement, he or she must necessarily find patri-
archy inconsistent with the truth of the human being since we are defined
as the image of God and not merely as a material, biological, or physical
object. The same is true of racism, the caste system, and slavery. The fact
is that it appears that the history of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim nations
has frequently been a rejection of this central tenet of their own belief.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá invited both the people of the West and the people of the
East to recognize the truth of their belief and act accordingly. Addressing
the inconsistency of racism and a spiritual definition of human beings,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said:

According to the words of the Old Testament God has said, “Let us
> make man in our image, after our likeness.” This indicates that man is
of the image and likeness of God. . . .

Let us now discover more specifically how he is the image and like-
> ness of God and what is the standard or criterion by which he can be
> measured and estimated. This standard can be no other than the
> divine virtues which are revealed in him. . . . Can we apply the test of
> racial color and say that man of a certain hue—white, black, brown,
> yellow, red—is the true image of his Creator? We must conclude that
> color is not the standard and estimate of judgment and that it is of no
> importance, for color is accidental in nature. The spirit and intelli-
> gence of man is essential, and that is the manifestation of divine
> virtues, the merciful bestowals of God, the eternal life and baptism
> through the Holy Spirit. Therefore, be it known that color or race is
> of no importance. . . . Man is not man simply because of bodily attrib-
> utes. The standard of divine measure and judgment is his intelligence
and spirit. (Promulgation 70)

The Birth of the Human Being                         7

The biblical statement is ultimately an affirmation of a consciousness
which defines the human being as not a mere material, natural, biological,
or physical being but instead as primarily a spiritual being.

THE BIRTH OF THE HUMAN BEING IN THE WRITINGS OF THE BÁB

The foundation of the concept of the birth of the human being was laid in
the Writings of the Báb. In this paper I shall discuss only three examples
of this new conceptual orientation in the Mission and Writings of the Báb.
The first is related to both the Declaration and the Martyrdom of the Báb.
The idea of the birth of the human being is, in my judgment, the essence
of all Bahá’í ideas. Yet it may be useful to trace this concept to the very
first night in which this new spiritual culture began. This is the night of
the Declaration of the Báb. On this night, a new conception of religion and
revelation is offered by the young merchant of Shiraz.

Traditionally religion was perceived as a monologue from God to
humanity. Revelation was an arbitrary imposition of divine will, a will
which had nothing to do with the development of humanity and history,
and therefore it was unchangeable. Thus the beginning of religion was
identified as the time when the Prophet becomes conscious of his prophet-
hood, a dialogue between God and his Prophet. However, the night of the
inception of the new Faith is different. According to the Báb, this was not
the night that He became conscious of His prophetic mission. That had
happened earlier, but the event did not mark the initiation of the new reli-
gion.2 The new religion, instead, marks its inception when a dialogue takes
place between God and humanity. God, through His Prophet, speaks with
a human being (Mullá H.usayn) who has become ready to receive His mes-
sage and thus becomes his first believer. This means that revelation is not
an arbitrary despotic will of God imposed upon human objects. Rather
revelation is a process which takes place between God and humanity.

God’s revelation is defined in terms of the needs and stage of develop-
ment of humanity, and therefore revelation is always a dynamic interac-
tive process, meaning that there will never be a final revelation. Here
human beings appear as spiritual beings who participate in the creation of
religion. Religion is a means of the advancement of humanity and not a

8             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

static, arbitrary, and unchangeable imposition upon them. The very
beginning of the Cause of the Báb represents the realization of a dialogi-
cal logic in which the human being appears as the image of God. Such a
dialogical approach constitutes the essence of the new spiritual culture.

This same logic is visible even in the martyrdom of the Báb. Unlike in
previous Dispensations, the Báb decides to be martyred together with one
of His believers. Therefore, the martyrdom of the Báb represents a
moment in which the body of the Báb and the body of one of His believ-
ers become indiscriminately united, when He appears in the body of His
disciple. The night before the martyrdom, the will of His believer is
already annihilated in the will of the Báb, and the moment of physical mar-
tyrdom is the realization of that same unity of the will in a physical way.
The martyrdom of the Báb is not the negation or silencing of the Báb.
Rather it is the supreme proclamation of His truth in the form of the birth
of a new race of humanity which represents spiritual perfections as the
image of God.

A second example is reflected in the Báb’s profound principle that the
supreme evidence of the truth of the Manifestation of God is not a natu-
ral phenomenon; rather, it is an act of spirit. Therefore, unlike the natura-
listic and traditional conception of miracles as the proof of the presence of
the divine, for the Báb the supreme miracle of God belongs to the realm
of spirit; namely, it is the Word, the new worldview and the novel culture
that signifies the presence of God. Thus it is the Word, consciousness, and
reason that define the purpose and function of religion. But as we saw
before, the revelation of the Word is not a monologue of God directed to
a human object. Instead it is a supreme dialogue that recognizes humani-
ty as partners in religion. That is why the supreme evidence of the truth
of divine revelation becomes the divine Word, namely, that which has to
be appropriated, understood, interpreted, and recognized by human con-
sciousness.

Finally, the Báb defines the historic night of His Declaration as the
night of Resurrection. In this way the Báb radically transforms the tradi-
tional idea of “resurrection.” Prior to the Báb, the idea of resurrection
turned into another form of dehumanization of humans. The final destiny

The Birth of the Human Being                          9

of humans, which defines their true identity and perfection and constitutes
their final reward, is heaven. Yet the followers of previous religions mis-
understood the metaphors of their scriptures in a literal way. The result
was a consciousness that defined the ultimate reward of human beings as
incessant objectifying sex without love and an infinite hedonism of insa-
tiable consumption without work and creativity. This ultimate abject
reduction of humans to the level of animals was understood as the final
realization of the truth, destiny, and perfection of human nature.

In addition, the traditional conception of the Day of Resurrection is a
thesis of the end of history—another strategy that deprives human beings
of their humanity. The Báb argued differently. Heaven becomes a new
stage of the ever-advancing march of human spiritual advancement. It is
the discovery of the new values and spiritual culture that defines the
Resurrection of the past culture. Human are defined as spirit, as spiritual
capacities, and their heaven is also inseparable from this spiritual process.
Heaven is a process of the realization of our spiritual potentialities, and
that is the true meaning of attaining the presence of God. It is amazing
that the Báb extended the idea of heaven and hell to not only humans but
to all beings. The heaven of anything is the stage of the realization of its
potentialities. Hell is its deprivation from such a realization. All things
have the right to attain their paradise and it is the duty of humans to
ensure that all beings, to the extent possible, achieve their heaven.3 Human
transcendence from nature, in other words, becomes the very process of
protecting the sanctity of nature and preserving the environment as well.

THE BIRTH OF THE HUMAN BEING IN THE WRITINGS OF BAHÁ’U’LLÁH

The most complex and explicit affirmation of the birth of the human
being is found in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. It is obvious that the main
source of almost all the major problems that have afflicted human beings
is the conscious or unconscious reduction of human beings to the level of
nature, body, objects, and instruments. Defining humans in terms of spir-
it, reason, love, and other spiritual attributes requires a perspective that
consists of three principles. First is a spiritual definition of human beings,

10             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

refusing to reduce humans to the level of nature or biology. Second, such
a spiritual definition of the human must understand the human as a his-
torical being, refusing to reduce it to a naturalistic logic of traditionalism.
Finally, defining humans as reason and spirit requires a dialogical under-
standing of human spirit, refusing to reduce humans to the natural level
of the struggle for existence.

These three principles of a humanizing worldview correspond to the
three central principles of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. As I have discussed
in much detail in Logos and Civilization, these three principles constitute
the chronology of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. In His earlier Writings in
Baghdad, Bahá’u’lláh employs the language and categories of mysticism to
emphasize a spiritual approach to human reality. In the second stage of
His Writings, which begins in the later Baghdad period and continues in
Istanbul and Adrianople, Bahá’u’lláh emphasizes the principle of historical
consciousness, defining humans as a dynamic and progressive reality that
participates in the construction of an ever-advancing civilization.
Bahá’u’lláh’s critique of traditionalism, including religious traditionalism,
is the center of His historic Text, the Book of Certitude. Finally, in the last
stage of His Writings, which begins in the late Adrianople period,
Bahá’u’lláh emphasizes the principle of the unity of humankind. Here,
humans are defined in a dialogical way, where consultation and unity in
diversity become the ultimate realization of human reality.

The first condition of the birth of the human being is therefore a spiri-
tual definition of human reality. The birth of the human being requires a
transformation in all aspects of culture and a revaluation of all values.
Both the cultures of the East and the West need to be revolutionized and
transformed in a way that makes them compatible with a human culture,
a culture of humanization. That is why this concept of the birth of the
human being is neither the same as the Western materialistic conception
of modernity, nor it is compatible with a traditionalistic approach to reli-
gion. These two opposites in fact are very similar to each other. Both are
expressions of a dehumanization process. In our current political disputes,
Western materialism and Eastern religious traditionalism define them-
selves in terms of the negation of the other. Eastern religious traditionalism

points to the history of colonialism by Western modernity and legitimizes
its repressive fanaticism through the negation of colonialism. Western
materialism celebrates its materialistic rationality by opposing itself to
the abhorrent violence against all the basic principles of human rights
that is committed by Eastern religious fanaticism. What both theories
ignore is the fact that both perspectives share a fundamental principle in
common, which is the reduction of human beings to the level of nature.
Bahá’u’lláh’s critique of materialism is therefore simultaneously a critique
of Western militaristic modernity and Eastern religious fanaticism which
reduces God and religion to an instrument of particularism, discrimina-
tion, violence, and suppression of freedom of conscience.

Both Western modernity and Eastern spirituality contain sublime
principles that refer to a culture of humanization. Modernity recognized
the dignity of the human being as a rational being and dedicated itself
to creating a social order based upon reason. This was a noble project
since it understood the truth of the human being as spirit and con-
sciousness. Eastern religious traditions are also based upon a fundamen-
tal belief in the spiritual nature of human beings. This mystical world-
view is the essence of the humanization project and a call for the birth
of the human being. Both Western modernity and Eastern religiosity
must be reconstructed in terms of these noble principles inherent in
them. But this also requires a fundamental refutation of both the mate-
rialistic aspect of modernity as well as traditionalistic and repressive
definitions of religion.

The fundamental teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, those that are usually called
“the twelve principles”—which are in fact at least sixteen—aim at this
reconstruction and reinterpretation of both religion and modernity. Some
of these principles directly address the critique of religious traditionalism.
The unity of all religions, progressive revelation, the agreement of faith
and reason, the elimination of prejudice, the independent investigation of
truth, universal education, the equality of men and women, and most
importantly the idea that religion must be a cause of unity and peace oth-
erwise irreligion is superior to religiosity, all directly challenge tradition-
al conceptions of religion. Some others directly challenge the materialist

12             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

logic of modernity. The idea of universal peace, the critique of nationalism,
the principle of the oneness of humanity, humanity’s need for spiritual
education, the imperative of economic justice, the elimination of all kinds
of prejudice, the equality of men and women, the notion of a universal
auxiliary language, and the principle of human rights directly address the
question of modernity and call for a modernity that is based upon the
birth of the human being as a human being.

One of the key concepts of the Bahá’í Faith which directly challenges
both religious and materialistic forms of dehumanization is the equation of
spirituality with universalism. In the Writings of both the Báb and Bahá’-
u’lláh the essence of ethics is defined as a process of spiritualization, a
process in which human beings become mirrors of God, reflecting divine
attributes in their sentiments and behaviors. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá defines the
same process as following the “politics of God,” a type of policy that is
qualitatively different from the normal sense of “politics.” The defining
feature of this divine politics is its universalism. God has created all, loves
all, nurtures all, and is merciful to all. His rain showers upon everyone,
His sun shines upon all, His earth provides sustenance to all. Human pol-
itics must follow the same principle of universalism, follow divine politics,
and aim at the realization of the universal interests of humankind.

This same principle was the basis of Bahá’u’lláh’s advice to the political
and religious leaders of the world, calling them to strive to serve the inter-
ests of all human beings, to bring peace, justice, and unity to the world.
But perhaps the most striking expression of this same principle is ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s frequent statement that whatever is “universal” is “divine.” In a talk
on the occasion of Naw-Rúz, for example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that the phil-
anthropic acts of humanity have usually been restricted to a particular
group of human beings. But in this age, because it is the age of the mani-
festation of the divine name the All-Merciful, good deeds are those deeds
which aim to benefit the entire human race since all that is universal is
divine.4

The history of Western modernity has unfortunately been frequently
one of dehumanization and particularism. While Western modernity rec-
ognized in abstract ways the dignity of all human beings, it was system-

atically a history of particularism, colonialism, racism, violence, patri-
archy, and militarism. The result of such a materialistic culture has been
consumerism, obsession with the body, destruction of the environment,
extremes of militarism, nationalistic racism, and a glorification of the cul-
ture of struggle for existence where human beings are defined as either
mere means or as obstacles to the realization of the narcissistic desire for
pleasure, material accumulation, and power. Bahá’u’lláh warned the West
in the nineteenth century of this distorted nature of material civilization.
He argued that Western material culture is not balanced by dedication to
universalistic values that are inherent in a spiritual definition of human
beings. The result, He said, is a civilization out of moderation, which nec-
essarily becomes militaristic. Militarism was for Bahá’u’lláh the logical
consequence of a form of modernity which is particularistic and reduces
humans to the level of nature and material being.

With the emergence of the Darwinian model, a broad logic of social
Darwinism became the guiding perspective for defining human beings in
the two dominant institutions of modernity, namely capitalism and
nationalism. Competition and pursuit of self-interest became the leading
principle of human behavior in the market. Yet the same principle glori-
fied the nation-state as the defining unit of international relations where
a state of nature is dominant. It was, again, a worldview of reducing
humans to the level of nature. In nature, the struggle for existence means
a war of all against all. Modernity’s conception, whether in its glorifica-
tion of pure capitalism or an extreme form of nationalism, where both the
individual and state are left to the logic of mere self-help surrounded by
hostile and threatening rivals and enemies, became a cult of militarism
and estrangement.

But rejection of the dehumanizing aspects of Western modernity does
not mean a celebration of the prevalent forms of Eastern religious tradi-
tionalism. When we look at the dominant forms of that religious tradi-
tionalism, we witness a tragic paradox. Religion by its nature is an affir-
mation of the spiritual nature of human beings and a call to end the reduc-
tion of humans to the level of material and natural objects. Yet paradoxi-
cally the way religion has often been understood and practiced by its fol-

14            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

lowers has been the very opposite of religion and godliness. Religious tra-
ditionalism has been primarily a strategy of dehumanization, a strategy of
turning humans into strangers and enemies of each other, legitimizing
slavery of unbelievers, violence and discrimination against women, and
discrimination regarding the rights of humans in terms of their religious
identification. Existing religions have frequently become a breeding
ground for hate, violence, discrimination, and estrangement. Members of
religious groups frequently find each other dirty, ritually impure, and pol-
luted; avoid communication and friendship with other religious groups;
and legitimize discrimination, censorship, and patriarchy. In essence, a
main function of traditionalistic religions has become the reduction of the
human reality to the level of nature, where struggle for existence rules,
where hatred and violence is a divinely sanctioned virtue, and where other
human beings are strangers and enemies who should be subjugated,
silenced, and even forced into extinction.

This is perhaps the most perplexing phenomenon of religious history.

The purpose of religion is to curb the natural and violent aspects of
human nature and to encourage humans to turn toward their spiritual
truth, where one can see all others as spiritual beings, as mirrors of God,
as sacred and beautiful, and as endowed with equal rights. Yet in the name
of God and spiritual dedication the vilest and most sadistic, ignorant, and
particularistic aspects of our low nature have been encouraged. One
extreme form of this religious dehumanization is the law of apostasy
(irtidád).

The law of apostasy was practiced in medieval times by Jews,
Christians, and Muslims alike but is nowadays confined to some of the
countries that call themselves Islamic. According to this law if one is
born in a Muslim family and then decides to change his religion, he or
she should be killed. In other words, using one’s reason and conscious-
ness becomes the ultimate crime that is punishable by death. Religion is
degraded into a naturalistic and physical quality. Not only is freedom of
conscience not recognized, but it becomes the ultimate sin. The law of
apostasy turns humans into natural objects, dehumanizes them, and
becomes a violent rejection of their dignity of self-determination through

the exercise of their own reason. In the name of God and spirituality we
witness the ultimate de-spiritualization and dehumanization of humans.

Therefore the worldview of the Bahá’í Faith has radically reinterpreted
both conceptions of religion and modernity. Defining human beings as
spiritual beings, as mirrors of the divine, becomes a rejection of the cul-
ture of discrimination and estrangement, and affirms the institutionaliza-
tion of dialogue and consultation dedicated to realizing the universal
interests of the human race.

The second condition of defining humans as humans is the affirmation
of historical consciousness. According to this view, the spiritual character
of the human being necessarily leads to a dynamic and self-creative human
life. Being a spirit, reason, and consciousness we humans are not static
objects determined by external nature. Consciousness implies perpetual
change, self-determination, freedom, deliberation, and advancement. It is
curious that Darwin’s emphasis on the biological evolution of humankind
appears at the same time that Bahá’u’lláh’s Book of Certitude emphasizes
the concept of evolution in the spiritual history of humanity. Although
both perspectives emphasize evolution and change, Bahá’u’lláh deduces
evolution and dynamism of human history from the spiritual nature of the
human being. It is not our biology or material character which makes us
a reality that is characterized by culture and history. Rather, it is our spir-
itual nature that brings history, dynamism, and cultural change to our life.
Bahá’u’lláh emphasizes evolution and historical consciousness not by
reducing humans to their biological nature but rather by liberating
humans from all forms of materialistic and naturalistic reductionism.

The opposite of historical consciousness is the ideology of traditional-
ism. This ideology is a cult of dehumanization. Humans become static
things who are not defined by their deliberative consciousness and choice,
but rather by their blind habituation and worship of the past. This tradi-
tionalism can take a religious or nonreligious form. The religious form of
traditionalism defines the laws of past religions as eternally binding on all
human beings. Religion, in such a perspective, becomes the enemy of his-
tory, progress, creativity, reason, and humanity. The result is that any
change is considered a violation of the divine will. Thus all religions

16            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

become the final religion and in all, the laws become unchangeable till the
Last Day. Traditionalism justified by the will of God becomes a potent
force for a reactionary orientation and enmity toward progress and social
justice. That is why Bahá’u’lláh’s emphasis on historical consciousness
takes the form of the doctrine of progressive revelation, a radical expres-
sion of historicity where the principle of dynamic change is not only
applied to the realm of human institutions but also to the realm of divine
revelation.

Our intellectual world is a world of chaos and confusion. We witness the
undecided and ongoing battle among the three contending perspectives of
premodernity or traditionalism, modernity or rationalism, and post-
modernity or cultural relativism. The birth of the human being requires a
revaluation of all these three perspectives. Premodern culture is a culture
of traditionalism, where human behavior and social reality must be gov-
erned not by human decision and reason but rather by the laws of nature,
fixed in the form of traditions, usually based upon biological characteris-
tics such as age, sex, family, clan, ethnicity, or national birth. Max Weber
calls this form of authority “traditional authority,” where laws are inferred
from the realm of nature, and thus are fixed and unchangeable. Not only
are humans reduced to the level of nature in this culture, but in addition
humans are ossified; they become natural objects which are fixed and
unchangeable, part of the natural order. The idea that humans are defined
not by nature but by culture, that humans are not mere natural beings but
conscious and rational realities who create their environment and legislate
their own laws, is absent from the worldview of traditionalism.

It was partly in response to this degradation and dehumanization that
modernity revolted against traditionalism. Modernity defined humans as
rational beings, and this meant that society must be constructed on the
basis of reason. As Max Weber notes, the opposite of traditional authori-
ty becomes legal-rational authority, meaning that laws are not a natural
phenomenon but rather something that is decided and legislated by the
human mind. Modernity’s rejection of traditionalism, therefore, was a
project of emancipating humans from the bondage of nature. Unfor-
tunately, although Western modernity defined human beings as rational,

and glorified the concept of reason, it led to ideas and practices that are
the exact opposite of the dignity of human beings. Colonialism, racism,
patriarchy, consumerism, selfishness, and militarism are just a few exam-
ples of modern forms of dehumanization.

It was partly a response to this phenomenon that led Western philoso-
phers increasingly to reject modernism and adopt postmodernism. Post-
modernism rejected the idea of reason and replaced it with the value of
diversity and difference. Unlike the claims of rationalism, postmodernism
supported cultural and moral relativism, rejecting all universalism.
According to that view, there is no such thing as universal human rights.
Good and bad are defined through cultures and traditions, while cultures
themselves cannot be judged in terms of a higher or universal principle.
Thus ultimately the only criterion of good and bad becomes nothing but
the existing culture and tradition. Ironically postmodern culture returns
to the same worship of tradition that was dominant in premodern tradi-
tionalism. Yet the postmodern worldview is self-contradictory. Although
it refuses to accept any universal principle of morality, it supports the
equal right of all cultures and traditions. Yet this relativism is fundamen-
tally inconsistent with the very idea of diversity, for in such relativism a
racist culture is just as good as a humanist culture, and a culture practic-
ing genocide in the name of tribe, God, or nation is just as legitimate as a
culture valuing human rights.

From a Bahá’í point of view the birth of the human being requires
going beyond all these three ideas of premodernism, modernism, and
postmodernism. The crucial missing link in both Eastern religious tra-
ditionalism and Western materialistic modernity is the absence of the
third condition of the definition of humans as humans, in other words,
the dialogical definition of human beings. Western modernity usually
reduced the concept of reason to a strategy of selfishness where con-
sciousness becomes a private island separate from others. In this view,
other human beings, like natural objects, become instruments for the
realization of one’s own selfish ends. The same is true with religious tra-
ditionalism, an ideology which separates different types of human beings
and legitimizes discrimination of rights, violence, and depriving people

18            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

of their most fundamental element of their humanity, namely their free-
dom of conscience.

The key to this puzzle lies in the concept of rationality. Modernity was
correct to reject traditionalism and its dehumanizing tendencies. But
unfortunately, reason, in the modern definition, became nothing but a
petty calculus of selfishness. Rationality was defined as the use of efficient
means to realize one’s selfish interests. In other words, materialistic
modernity defined the essence of humans as nothing but another form of
struggle for existence. Reason became an efficient technique which was a
mere servant of our natural desires. Other human beings once again
became enemies or instruments to be used for our own gain. It is no won-
der that this rationalism became a justification for particularism, mili-
tarism, consumerism, colonialism, and destruction of the environment.
But the response of postmodernity to this problem is equally misguided.
Postmodernity completes the task of the estrangement of all humans from
all humans, all cultures from all cultures, and destroys the possibility of
communication, dialogue, and mutual understanding. Such a world
becomes necessarily another arena of struggle for existence.

The solution is a new definition of reason. Humans as spiritual beings
are defined by reason and consciousness, but this reason is defined by its
universalism and transcendence from all forms of particularism. Reason in
its true nature becomes a force that transcends the boundaries of space
and time, and rediscovers the identity and unity of all human beings as
spirit. In this definition of reason, humans rise above the realm of nature
and discover the truth of reality. Reason, in other words, becomes the very
strategy of humanization, an affirmation of the culture of the oneness of
humanity, a discovery of the intrinsic beauty and sacredness of humans
and all beings.

This new definition of reason corresponds with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s empha-
sis on the interconnectedness of all beings. The ultimate truth of all things
is their mutual interdependence or love. He defined love as the necessary
relations arising from the nature of things. Yet He defined religion in the
same way. In addition He defined nature and knowledge in the same man-
ner. The truth of nature, reason, religion, and love are one and the same

thing, and that is the necessary relations among things, relations that are
not accidental to the truth of things, rather the essential outcome of the
mutual interdependence of all things. Applied to the realm of humanity,
this idea takes the form of the principle of the oneness of humanity. In such
a perspective, reason is defined in terms of the unity in diversity of all
human beings. True rationality takes the form of a dialogue between
human beings, a dialogue based upon the recognition of the essential unity
of all.

Two main examples of Bahá’u’lláh’s radical reinterpretation of reason
as a dialogical and intersubjective reality are particularly revealing.
First, Bahá’u’lláh defines the perfection and maturity of reason as con-
sultation. In an untranslated statement Bahá’u’lláh affirms that for
everything there is a station of perfection and maturity and that the
maturity and manifestation of reason is realized through consultation.5
In other words, true rationality is nothing but consultation. That is why
the unity of humanity, justice, and peace are all inseparable from the
principle of consultation.

The second example is found in Bahá’u’lláh’s identification of reason
(wisdom) with the maturation of humanity and His identification of the
signs and characteristics of this stage of the rationalization of society.
First He identifies the sign of the appearance of reason among the people
as the emergence of a culture in which the desire for domination is
replaced with the desire for universalistic service. In the words of
Bahá’u’lláh: “The fact that you see some people exhibit delight in worldly
power, and pride themselves in earthly eminence is due to their heedless-
ness. . . . One of the signs of the maturity of the world is that no one will
accept to bear the weight of kingship. Kingship will remain with none
willing to bear alone its weight. That day will be the day whereon wisdom
[‘aql] will be manifested among mankind” (Majmú‘iy-i-Alváh-i-Mubárakih,
125–26).

It is interesting that Bahá’u’lláh identifies another sign of the matura-
tion and rationalization of humanity as the institutionalization of a univer-
sal auxiliary language (Kitáb-i-Aqdas par. 189). The Word, which was the
main evidence of the presence of God in the Writings of the Báb, becomes

20            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

a social institution that binds humanity together. Such a universal lan-
guage is the ultimate expression of the dialogical character of reason.
Modern social theory and philosophy has clearly confirmed the accuracy
of the dialogical concept of reason. It is true that Descartes’ statement “I
think therefore I am” was a revolutionary and progressive statement that
defined humans as consciousness and rejected the particularistic reduction
of humans to their naturalistic groups, traditions, and attachments. Yet
the Cartesian project reduced consciousness to a mere subjective island
isolated from other beings. The result was an unconscious identification of
consciousness with one’s particular and separate body, turning reason into
a mere slave of the selfish passions of the individual.

However, social theory has made it clear that consciousness is insepara-
ble from language, presupposing an intersubjective process of dialogue
among human beings. George Herbert Mead’s theory, for example, dis-
cusses the dynamics of the development of consciousness through the suc-
cessive stages of play, game, and Generalized Other. We learn to take the
attitudes and roles of others, put ourselves in the position of others, and
internalize others within so that we can engage in an internal dialogue
between I and Me, the latter representing the internalized other. The
decisive expression of this development of consciousness is of course none
other than language. But language presupposes the intersubjective agree-
ment of a group of human beings. Consciousness therefore is fundamen-
tally an intersubjective and dialogical process where the being of others is
presupposed in the very being of the individual’s consciousness. We think
through language, through symbols that humans have created. Language
is the realm of spirit where we transcend the domain of natural objects
and engage in a world that is created by the spirit. But this creation by its
very nature is a dialogical process. Yet Bahá’u’lláh goes even one step fur-
ther. The advent of reason among human beings is defined not simply in
terms of language but in terms of a universal language. The true realiza-
tion of reason is the realization of a culture of universal communication
and concord among the human race.

This dialogical perspective which identifies spirituality with universali-
ty and love represents a culture in which nationalistic militarism, exces-

sive social inequality, various forms of prejudice and particularism, and
religious fanaticism are transformed into a culture of the oneness of
humanity, universal peace, justice, and human rights.

THE BIRTH OF THE HUMAN BEING IN THE WRITINGS OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ

The maturation of humanity, an affirmation of the culture of unity and
communication, is the realization of true freedom. Obviously the question
of freedom is inseparable from the definition of human beings and their
spiritual birth. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has offered a unique theory of freedom and
true liberty. His theory, however, is rooted in Bahá’u’lláh’s conception of
true liberty. While in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh criticizes the libertar-
ian and materialist doctrine of hedonistic liberty, He affirms the sanctity
of true liberty. However, in one of His Tablets He defines the realization
of true liberty in terms of a universalistic culture of identity. He refers to
His famous statement, “It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his
own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world” (Gleanings
250) and identifies the realization of that principle in people’s conscious-
ness as the fulfillment of true liberty.6

In Bahá’u’lláh’s famous passage, He applies His universalistic principle
to the idea of national patriotism by redefining the concept of honor and
glory. True honor is realized when one’s love of country is associated with
one’s love of the entire human race. However, if solidarity with one’s
nation implies a degradation of the people of other countries to the level
of strangers, instruments, or enemies, this is not true honor. It is clear that
Bahá’u’lláh’s redefinition of patriotism is a categorical rejection of colo-
nialism and imperialism which are based upon patriotism of national supe-
riority, where morality is defined in the sense of pursuing the interests of
one’s country at the expense of others. Thorstein Veblen, the great Amer-
ican sociologist who wrote a book on war and peace during World War I,
recognized nationalistic patriotism as a system of invidious competition
among nations. Such patriotism, he argued, is antithetical to peace. Just as
in the realm of market relations the search for honor is manifested in
terms of invidious comparison where both leisure and waste become the

22            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

marks of economic superiority, patriotism represents the struggle for
superiority among the nations. A rational society, Veblen maintained, is a
society which refuses to accept such wasteful and irrational habits of
thought.

In other words, for Bahá’u’lláh true freedom is realized when patriot-
ism is redefined as the unity in diversity of all nations and cultures.
Conversely, the state of nature or the anarchy of international relations
with its traditionalistic logic of patriotism reduces human societies to the
level of a jungle where a particularistic morality requires the exploita-
tion, objectification, domination, and even extermination of other coun-
tries. The same universalistic logic leads Bahá’u’lláh to question the
exclusionist violence of existing institutions of nationalism and replace it
with the revolutionary principle that the earth is but one country and
mankind its citizens.

This new definition of freedom is more explicitly discussed in the
Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, true freedom is the
same as the emancipation of humans from the bondage of nature. True lib-
erty and freedom is tantamount to the birth of the human being. But this
liberation from nature has two aspects. The first aspect refers to human
liberation from external nature. This means increasing the autonomy of
human beings from natural restrictions and a progressive autonomy of
humans from their immediate environment. This aspect of freedom is real-
ized through science and technology. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá frequently indicates,
by discovering the laws of nature humans manipulate those laws and thus
are freed from natural limitations. Humans are naturally bound to walk on
earth but by inventing airplanes we fly over the planet.

However, this first form of freedom is not a sufficient and true realiza-
tion of freedom. In fact this is the main problem with materialistic moder-
nity. Both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have frequently criticized the fact
that science and technology have become instruments of destruction and
death. Thus militarism represents a culture in which technical freedom is
not accompanied by spiritual freedom. Such lack of equilibrium becomes a
major threat against not only freedom but also the very existence of
human race.

Therefore, true freedom is dependent not only on liberation from exter-
nal nature, but it also requires human emancipation from the bondage of
internal nature. This internal nature is the principle and habit of struggle
for existence, perceiving human society as a jungle. Affirming this redefi-
nition of freedom as one of the central principles of the Bahá’í Faith,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states:

And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is man’s freedom, that
> through the ideal Power he should be free and emancipated from the
> captivity of the world of nature; for as long as man is captive to nature
> he is a ferocious animal, as the struggle for existence is one of the exi-
> gencies of the world of nature. This matter of the struggle for exis-
> tence is the fountain-head of all calamities and is the supreme afflic-
> tion. (Selections 316)

In this and other statements, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá presents a theory in which
human freedom is realized when humans have overcome their naturalistic
self-alienation. The rise of human beings from the dictates of nature con-
stitutes the true realization of human freedom. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His
Writings defines the struggle for existence as a law that is prevalent in
nature. However, humans must act according to the realm of values, tran-
scend the realm of nature, and act as spiritual beings. Animals act on the
basis of the principle of struggle for existence, but their behavior is regu-
lated by natural instincts, and the overall result of such a system is the
ecological harmony of the earth. Yet humans are not regulated by
instincts because they are endowed with dynamic reason. Consequently if
humans act in accordance with the principle of struggle for existence, the
result will be not ecological harmony but rather the extinction of life on
earth through the destruction of the environment and nuclear war. Social
Darwinism, defined in broad ways, represents the reduction of humans to
the level of nature. A culture of peace, justice, unity, and communication,
on the other hand, represents the overcoming of human self-alienation,
the birth of the human being, and true freedom.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in that same Tablet addressed to the Hague Peace
24            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

Committee goes one step further and explains the cause of the bondage of
humans to the law of struggle for existence. Thus reduction of humans to
the level of nature is the same as a form of culture and social order that
defines human identities in opposition to each other. Violence and war are
necessary consequences of such culture and social order. But the real cause
of the dominance of the struggle for existence among human beings is
nothing but various forms of prejudice. Thus the elimination of all kinds
of prejudice is the key to realizing true liberty in human society. It is by
virtue of sexist, nationalistic, religious, racial, ethnic, and other forms of
prejudice that humans perceive and treat each other as objects, animals,
strangers, enemies, and instruments. The organic connection between the
struggle for existence at the level of human beings and cultural prejudices
are frequently attested by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. For example in the same Tablet
quoted above He writes:

And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that religious, racial,
> political, economic and patriotic prejudices destroy the edifice of
> humanity. As long as these prejudices prevail, the world of humanity
> will not have rest. For a period of 6,000 years history informs us
> about the world of humanity. During these 6,000 years the world of
> humanity has not been free from war, strife, murder and bloodthirsti-
> ness. In every period war has been waged in one country or another
> and that war was due to religious prejudice, racial prejudice, political
> prejudice or patriotic prejudice. It has therefore been ascertained and
> proved that all prejudices are destructive of the human edifice. As
> long as these prejudices persist, the struggle for existence must
> remain dominant, and bloodthirstiness and rapacity continue.
> Therefore, even as was the case in the past, the world of humanity
> cannot be saved from the darkness of nature and cannot attain illumi-
> nation except through the abandonment of prejudices and the acqui-
> sition of the morals of the Kingdom. (Selections 313)

We can see the intimate connection between ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s discussion
of freedom and Bahá’u’lláh’s identification of a global and universalistic

consciousness and values as true freedom. This perspective shows the lim-
itations of both religious traditionalism and materialistic modernity. In
both cases, humans are defined in particularistic and prejudicial terms. For
example, religious prejudice turns human society into a jungle and
reduces humans to the level of nature. Materialistic definitions of humans
turn markets as well as the international system into a jungle. With the
politicization of traditional religion, materialist modernity and religious
traditionalism become indistinguishable in their social functions. One
important common point is militarism. In fact, the Bahá’í critique of mate-
rialism is primarily a critique of violence and militarism. Similarly,
Bahá’u’lláh’s warnings against the violence of religious fanaticism as a
world-consuming fire and His abrogation of the concept of holy war rep-
resent the same principle. Material civilization must be accompanied by a
spiritual definition of human beings. Otherwise our technology makes us
more powerful and destructive, but less civilized. Yet our religions must
be a cause of unity and harmony, otherwise they are forms of dehumaniza-
tion and de-spiritualization.

The solution to both forms of reduction of humans to the level of nature
is the realization of reason. As we noted, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá identifies the source
of the human struggle for existence as various forms of prejudice. But in
His Tablets He also identifies the ultimate source of all prejudices.
According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s frequent statement, the source of prejudice is
the absence of independent investigation of truth in the life of human
beings. Thus it is the force of habit and traditionalism that turns humans
into unconscious beings who become incapable of recognizing the human-
ity of other human beings, thinking and feeling in universalistic terms, and
acting in accordance with true justice and morality. In other words, when
we refuse to think for ourselves, and imitate the current or past particular-
istic traditions, seeing things not through our own eyes but through the
eyes of others, we are enslaved by prejudice and fall prey to social
Darwinism broadly defined. On the other hand, if we use our reason, inves-
tigate truth independently, and look at things with our own eyes, we will
be able to transcend particularistic categories, recognize all human beings
as our equals, discover the identity and interconnectedness of all beings,

26            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

and feel and act in a communicative, consultative, and dialogical way.
Bahá’u’lláh’s methodological principle at the beginning of the Hidden
Words, asking us to see things with our own eyes, paradoxically becomes
the strategy of transcending our particular self, recognizing others, think-
ing in universalistic ways, and attaining truth. Reason becomes the path
for uniting all human beings, a force of discovery of the unity of all
humans.

The same statement of Bahá’u’lláh in the Hidden Words unveils the
greatest irony of reason. On the one hand, investigation of truth affirms
the unity of all human beings and discovers the spiritual solidarity of all
beings. On the other hand, human independent investigation is an affirma-
tion of human autonomy, individuality, uniqueness, independence, and
qualitative difference from all others. The realization of reason requires
such individuality and independence because as spirit we are free and
unique, irreducible to others. Yet the exercise of this individuality is
accompanied by the discovery of the common truth of all human beings.
The twin principles of the independent investigation of truth and the one-
ness of humankind are the indispensable conditions for the birth of the
human being. It may at first seem that there is a contradiction between the
two principles. But there is no contradiction here. It is precisely the unity
of the two principles which defines the truth of reason, freedom, and the
self-realization of humanity. We must be radically independent, different,
and unique while at the same time we must be united and one.

It is the principle of unity in diversity that defines the true meaning of
the concept of reason and spirit in Bahá’u’lláh’s perspective. Unity with-
out diversity and uniqueness is ugly and stagnant, and diversity without
unity becomes a force of estrangement, alienation, violence, and ugliness.
To be human means to be radically unique and individual while at the
same time discovering the radical connectedness, reciprocity, and unity of
all of us. Such a perspective transcends both a postmodern concept of rad-
ical exteriority and otherness of all human beings, and the collectivist dis-
solution of individual humans to a social, collective, and communal unifor-
mity, perspectives, both of which alienate humans from their humanity. It
is the principle of unity in diversity—the twin principles of the oneness of

humanity and independent investigation of truth—that points to human
liberation from a naturalistic struggle for existence. It is through this par-
adoxical culture that finally the human face can emerge out of the natural
and biological background of human existence.
