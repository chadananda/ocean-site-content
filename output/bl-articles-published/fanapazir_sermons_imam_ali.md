Baha’u’llah as fulfilment of the theophanic promise in

Translator's Introduction

The Founders of world religions, in Baha‟i discourse, the Manifestations of
God, relate their claims and their utterances to the language and beliefs of
the peoples to whom they come.1 Thus Jesus Christ stated at the outset of
his mission: "Think not that I have come to destroy the Law and the
Prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfil."2 The Qur'án repeatedly
states that it confirms the Gospel and the Torah, affirming that the Prophet's
advent has been mentioned in the Torah and the Evangel. The Bábí and
Bahá'í Revelations are also intimately related to their Islamic background
and their Judaeo-Christian heritage. As the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith,
says,

> "[The Bahá'ís] must strive to obtain from sources that are
> authoritative and unbiased a sound knowledge of the history and
> tenets of Islam, the source and background of their Faith, and
> approach reverently and with a mind purged from pre-conceived
> ideas the study of the Qur'án which, apart from the sacred scriptures
> of the Bábí and Bahá'í Revelations, constitutes the only Book which
> can be regarded as an absolutely authenticated repository of the Word
> of God."3

But what is most remarkable is the frequent reference to particular verses,
particular traditions (ḥadiths), particular tropes of Judaism, Christianity and
Islam. For example, there are many references to the messianic passages of
Isaiah. The passages of Matthew 24 and St John's reference to the Comforter
and the Spirit of Truth are frequent in Baha‟u‟llah‟s writings4. From the
Qur‟án we have multiple references to the "Meeting with God" on the Day
of Judgement, such as Surah 29:5

For a recent survey of Baha‟u‟llah‟s messianic claims see Buck, Christopher, „The Eschatology of
Globalization:The Multiple-Messiahship of Baha‟u‟llah Revisited‟ in Studies in Modern Religions, Religious
Movements and the Babi-Baha’i Faiths, Moshe Sharon (ed), Leiden:Brill, 2004,143-178 and references therein.

In the traditions of the Twelver Branch of Islám or Imámí Shi'ism in
particular, three sermons of the Imám „Alí stand out as pivotal in their
contribution to the Bahá‟í writings. These are known as the sermons of
Ṭutunjiyyih [the Gulf), Nurániyyat [Recognition through Luminousness],
and Iftikhár [Glorification]. They hold tremendous theological importance,
and, down the centuries, have had a magnetic effect on Shi‟ih religious
thought. The author of the book that contains these three sermons, Ḥafiz
Rajab al Bursi (died 1411 CE), held a very high view of the station of the
Imams6, highly evocative of the position held by Shaykh Aḥmad and Siyyid
Kazim7, the precursors of the Bábí Cause at a later century. At the time of
the Safavi renaissance of Shi'ih Islam, Bursi was considered to have
exaggerated views of the station of the Imams8. But the writings of Shaykh
Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i and Siyyid Kazim Rashti also accorded a very high station
to the Imams. The Imams are referred to as "Maẓaahir," the "manifestations
of God's names and attributes," by Shaykh Ahmad in his Sharh az-Ziyarat9.
In this regard Husayn the Son of the Imam „Ali is addressed to in the Tablet
of Visitation revealed by Bahá'u'lláh for him10 as the One through Whom the
Command of the Letters "B" and "E" came to be realised. He is also referred
to as the Mystery of Revelation in the World of God's Dominion [jabarut].
As far as one can ascertain both the Báb11 and Bahá'u'lláh affirm in their
writings the validity of these traditions which have their provenance in
Bursi.

In the Kitáb-i-Iqán Bahá'u'lláh, in expounding the twin cardinal principles of
the Unity of the Prophets and infinity of the Revelatory Process adduces as
evidence references which are to be found only in Bursi. Bahá'u'lláh's

Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come (Wilmette:Baha‟i Publishing Trust, 1961,p.114). “Indeed,
the essential prerequisites of admittance into the Bahá'í fold …, is the wholehearted and unqualified acceptance by
them …, of the legitimacy of the institution of the Imamate, …” See also Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of
Baha'u'llah (Willmette: Baha‟i Publishing Trust,1988 p. 101)

Writings thus affirm the importance and legitimacy of these utterances of
the Imam 'Ali.

Two important quotations from Bursi which Bahá'u'lláh cites in the Kitab-i-
Iqan and which again emphasise the point of the reliability of Bursi as a
narrator are the following (see italics):

> Furthermore, among the "veils of glory" are such terms as the "Seal
> of the Prophets" and the like, the removal of which is a supreme
> achievement in the sight of these base-born and erring souls. All, by
> reason of these mysterious sayings, these grievous "veils of glory,"
> have been hindered from beholding the light of truth. Have they not
> heard the melody of that bird of Heaven12, uttering this mystery: "A
> thousand Fatimihs I have espoused, all of whom were the daughters
> of Muhammad, Son of Abdu'llah, the 'Seal of the Prophets?'"13
> Behold, how many are the mysteries that lie as yet unravelled within
> the tabernacle of the knowledge of God, and how numerous the gems
> of His wisdom that are still concealed in His inviolable treasuries!
> Shouldst thou ponder this in thine heart, thou wouldst realize that His
> handiwork knoweth neither beginning nor end. The domain of His
> decree is too vast for the tongue of mortals to describe, or for the bird
> of the human mind to traverse; and the dispensations of His
> providence are too mysterious for the mind of man to comprehend.
> His creation no end hath overtaken, and it hath ever existed from the
> "Beginning that hath no beginning"; and the Manifestations of His
> Beauty no beginning hath beheld, and they will continue to the "End
> that knoweth no end." Ponder this utterance in thine heart, and reflect
> how it is applicable unto all these holy Souls.

> Likewise, strive thou to comprehend the meaning of the melody of
> that eternal beauty, Husayn, son of Ali, who, addressing Salman,
> spoke words such as these: "I was with a thousand Adams, the
> interval between each and the next Adam was fifty thousand years,
> and to each one of these I declared the Successorship conferred upon
> my father." He then recounteth certain details, until he saith: "I have
> fought one thousand battles in the path of God, the least and most
> insignificant of which was like the battle of Khaybar, in which battle
> my father fought and contended against the infidels." 14 Endeavour
> now to apprehend from these two traditions the mysteries of "end,"

"return," and "creation without beginning or end."15

Imam „Ali

This quotation is from Bursi‟s al-Alfayn cited in Ishraq Khavari, Qamus-i-Íqán, Vol. 1, p.17

Both the above quotations indicating utterances of "high Imamology" are from the self-same Bursi in
his book Alfayn as quoted by the late Ishraq Khavari (Idem).

Bahá'u'lláh, Íqán, 166-168.
92       Khazeh Fananapazir                                      Baha‟u‟llah Theophanic Promise

What these traditions have in common is their use of the language of the
World of Command ['Alam-i-Amr], to attribute the workings of the Will of
God [His Primal Will] to the World of Creation. Bahá'u'lláh, 16 on the
strength of these traditions, states that this World of Command is sanctified
above plurality:

> Similar statements have been made by 'Alí. Sayings such as this,
> which indicate the essential unity of those Exponents of Oneness,
> have also emanated from the Channels of God's immortal utterance,
> and the Treasuries of the gems of divine knowledge, and have been
> recorded in the scriptures. These Countenances are the recipients of
> the Divine Command, and the day-springs of His Revelation. This
> Revelation is exalted above the veils of plurality and the exigencies
> of number. Thus He saith: "Our Cause is but one."17 Inasmuch as the
> Cause is one and the same, the Exponents thereof also must needs be
> one and the same. Likewise, the Imáms of the Muhammadan Faith,
> those lamps of certitude, have said: "Muhammad is our first,
> Muhammad our last, Muhammad our all.

The Particularity of the Sermon of the Gulf19

One reference stands unique in that Bahá'u'lláh Himself calls it the Quṭb, or
"Pivot," around which "all the glad tidings of the past revolve."20 That is in a
passage from a sermon that was delivered by the Imam 'Ali21 called the
"Sermon of the Twin Gulfs," the "Khuṭbah" of "Ṭutunjiyyah."

The title Tutunjiyyih itself is a reference to the passage wherein the Imam
says: "I am the One that standeth upon the Two Tutunjs [Gulfs]." Es
expounded below, Siyyid Kazim explains that these two gulfs represent the
Gulf of Prophethood and the Gulf of Wilayat, or Imamate. This narration
was referred to by Henri Corbin in the following terms as the "prone sur ou
entre deux golfes":

> "L'Imám veut dire qu'il est le Póle (qutb) qui domine les deux golfes
> et détermine la courbe de leur cercle respectif. Il est celui par qui se
> manifeste la Miséricorde et par qui se manifeste son antithèse. "C'est
> en lui que se produit la différenciation des choses; c'est de lui que

> 17 Qur‟an 54:50
> 18 This is from the Bih.aar ul Anwaar [Oceans of Lights])
> 19 Khuṭbih-i-Tutunjiyyih or Khuṭbatu't-Ṭutunjiyyah ‫طتنجيه خطبه‬
> 20 This is in the 35th volume of the INBA series of Baha‟u‟llah‟s Writings.It is available on the
internet here: Baha‟u‟llah refers to this Utterance of the KhT being the qutḅ around which all language of
prophecy revolves

21 ca.600-661. See IK Poonwala, „„Ali b. Abí Ṭáleb‟ , in Encyclopaedia Iranica (E. Yarshater(ed),
London: Biblioteca Persica, 1:838-843)

> procèdent l'origine de la béatitude et l'origine de la damnation; c'est
> par lui que prend réalité la difference de l'une et de l'autre".22

> "The Imám means to say that he is the Pole (qutb) who rules the two
> gulfs and determines the curve of their respective circles. It is he
> through whom Mercy is manifested, and through whom is
> manifested its antithesis. "It is in him that is produced the
> differentiation of things; from him it is that the originof beatitude and
> the origin of damnation both proceed. It is through him that the
> difference between them becomes real."

Additionally Baha‟u‟llah, in a Tablet starting with the words "the essence of
praise..."23 exalts the Sermon under our consideration as the "blessed
sermon of Ṭutunjiyyah" and refers to it as having shone forth from the
“dayspring of absolute sanctity and guardianship". He says that it has not
been commented on in the wondrous Persian tongue and that the purpose of
the Imam 'Ali in this sermon has been the announcement of the Promise
"Anticipate ye the Advent of Him Who was the speaker with Moses on
Mount Sinai." Bahá'u'lláh then goes on to say that this promise is the Pivot
[qutb] around which all wisdom and utterance revolve.24

With this precise promise, Bahá‟u‟lláh affirms, all the peoples have been
vouchsafed the glad tidings of the Manifestation of God. Bahá'u'lláh then
goes on to say that in this day the Speaker of the Mount is manifest and that
the Speaker gives call to this utterance "Verily I am God."25

The Sermon of the Twin Gulfs is important for Bahá'í studies on several
grounds. It shows how in the pre-Bábí/Bahá'í Era various hermeneutic
approaches were needed to overcome the various objections that were raised
to its high theophanic claims, and that these interpretative efforts have
continued to be needed. Also, as Bahá‟u‟lláh asserts in the Tablet of Jawhar-
i-ḥamd ("The Essence of Praise") and the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, the
Ṭutunjiyyah is a source text for the claims of Bahá'u'lláh to be the Speaker
on Sinai26.

Siyyid Kazim and the four approaches of the divines before and during
the time of the Babi/Bahá'í Revelations

Siyyid Kazim Rashti showed great respect for this Sermon and wrote a very
large commentary on it, which is one of his longest works29. He says that the
Tutunjiyyih is the pre-eminent instance of the Wisdom that "Not everything
that a man knoweth can be disclosed nor can everything that he can disclose
be regarded as timely, nor can every timely utterance be considered as suited
to the capacity of those who hear it."30 He divides the ulama into four
different groups in relation to this sermon and, interestingly, this subdivision
was germane to all religious classes in the fervour of millennial
expectation.31

     The first group rejects the likes of these traditions and has

> dropped them from the viewpoint of credibility, saying that these
> traditions are based on a single line of narration (akhbaar aḥaad)
> and thus cannot be the basis of law or action. These traditions,
> they say, all are in the book of Bursi and since the latter was
> charged with extreme views in his day this should militate against
> their acceptance. Another reason they would be unacceptable in
> that they attempt to elevate the contingent above the level of
> contingency. They appear also to assert divine Lordship of a
> created being necessitating also that the Godhead devolves divine

Here we have perhaps Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s most explicit assertion of the reliability of Bursi‟s compilation.

Rashti, Sayyid Kazim , Sharh khutbat al-tatanjiya, (Tabriz:n.p., Lithograph, 1270 [1853-4]).

Baha‟u‟llah cites this tradition in his „Tafsir-i-Surah-i-Va'sh-Shams‟ (Commentary on the Surah of
the Sun) in Gleanings from the Writings of Baha’u’llah (Shoghi Effendi trans. Wilmette:Baha‟i Publishing Trust,
1983, LXXXIX, 176).

Does He have any partners?"32

       The second position that Siyyid Kazim in his celebrated Sharh

> mentions existed with regard to the hermeneutics of this Sermon.
> This position suggested one should remain non-judgmental about
> it on the grounds that these types of utterance exist but that
> human minds cannot comprehend them.

       The third position in regard to these sermons is the position held

> by the monists and the admirers of Ibn Arabi in Shi‟ih Islam such
> as Mullá Muhsin Fayd. Fayd-e-Kashani says: “When the
> effulgences of the Essence of God (dhat) overpower any one such
> that person's entity, actions, attributes are all obliterated in the
> rays of oneness with the Divine Essence in this state he will see
> himself one with all Essences. In this state the light of the
> distinguishing mind becomes subsumed under the Light of Pre-
> existent Essence and all contingence is lifted up”. Then Fayd-e-
> Kashani says: “This explains the utterance of 'Ali in the Sermon
> of the Ṭutunjiyyah: „I am the First Adam and the First Noah‟.”

       The fourth group -- and Siyyid Kazim Rashti considers himself

> of this group -- are those who accept this essential belief: namely
> they recognise the one being as having many "stations" and these
> "stations" are the "treasuries" of that entity's existence. “God
> says: "There is nothing of which We do not have that thing's
> treasuries [khazaa'in]."33 "Our First is Muhammad, Our Last is
> Muhammad, our all is Muhammad." Siyyid Kazim states that his
> hermeneutic principle is the verse of the Qur'án: "Creation has
> many modes [atwár] of existence."34 These include a mode of
> brevity and expansion; a mode of simplicity and the mode of
> complexity; and modes of imagination and abstraction. As to the
> first group, i.e. those who attributed the sermon to the heresy of
> extremism, Siyyid Kazim says their views are hasty and
> erroneous inasmuch as there are many similar utterances that are
> universally accepted by the Shi‟ites. Examples are the prayer of
> the month of Rajab included in all Shi‟ite anthologies; acceptance
> of the innumerable references to the Imams as "Hand of God, the
> Eye of God, Whose utterances are of God"; and the traditions of

> because rationally their arguments would entail alteration and
> transformation in the essence or Dhat of God and this position is
> untenable.

The Báb quoted the famous verse of the Ṭutunjiyyah regarding the
anticipation of the Speaker of Sinai in his Seven Proofs36

In the writings of Mirza Abu'l-Fadl the Sermon of the two Gulfs is referred
to frequently but this matter has not been discussed previously. Thus in his
Fara'id37 he writes that the sanctified reality of Most Great Spirit is single
and one and it does not ontologically become plural or multiple because the
"Mirrors" are multiple nor should it epistemologically be allowed to become
so.

An overview of the Sermon of the Gulf

In this Khuṭbah, the Imam asserts belief in the divine unity and that there is
no deity but the One God and the Prophethood of Muhammad, but adds the
necessity of loyalty to the Imamate as the repository of salvation. In this
context, the Imam 'Ali makes a series of statements all commencing with the
pronoun "I": "I am the First. I am the Last. I was with Noah. I am the
Builder. I am the destroyer. I am that Agent whereby Jesus spoke in His
Cradle. I am the Word through Which all things were consummated."
Bahá'u'lláh has explained that these utterances refer to the World of
Command or Revelation ('Aalam-i Amr).38 In one of his tablets, Bahá'u'lláh
says that the utterances of the Sermon were taught to Imam 'Ali by the
Messenger of God (Muhammad) [tilka kalimatun `allamahu Rasul'ullah], so
that although Ali utters these statements in fact it is the Prophet who utters
them39.

In this tablet, Baha‟u‟llah says:

> “Verily My Name „Ali gave you the glad tidings and announced to
> you the Advent of this Day: He said, and His Word is the Truth:
> Anticipate ye the Advent of the Speaker of Sinai. I swear by God:

The key verse of prophecy that the Manifestation to be anticipated is the
Speaker on Sinai, is understood from the Bahá‟í writings to be a clear
reference to the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh as at once the "essence, the promise, the
unifier, and the reconciler"41 of all previous revelations, inasmuch as all the
previous Faiths are understood to have spoken of the coming of the "Lord of
the Vineyard"42, the meeting with God, and the like. In unnumbered
passages Bahá‟u‟lláh claimed his utterance to be the “Voice of Divinity, the
Call of God Himself”43and his era the "Day that hath seen the coming of the
Best-beloved Him Who through all eternity hath been acclaimed the Desire
of the World."44

Bursi’s Three Theophanic “Sermons”: A Translation

Translation of the Sermon of the Gulf45

The sermon (Khuṭbah) [delivered by Imam 'Ali] which is designated That of
the Gulf (al-Ṭutunjiyyah) has an exterior level (zahir) which is elegant
(aniq) and an interior level (batin) which is deep ('amiq). Let him who reads
it beware lest he think ill of it for therein something of the sanctity of the
Creator (tanzih al-Khaliq) is reflected which no one of the creatures can
bear. The Commander of the Faithful [Imam 'Ali] delivered it between
Kufah and Medina. He said:

Praise be to God Who hath rent asunder the firmaments46 (al-ajwaa) and
opened the atmosphere (al-hawa) and suspended the vast expanses of the
universe47 and caused the Splendour (diyaa) to shine, and quickened the
dead and caused the living to die. I give Him praise such praise as shone and
became uplifted, a praise that was radiant and effulgently luminous, a praise
that ascendeth to heaven in its sending there and which goeth to the high
sphere (jaww) unto its equinoctial summit (i'tidaaluhu). He created the
heavens without pillars (bila da'aaim) and set them upright without
supports48. He then adorned the heavens with light-giving planets and
caused to be imprisoned in the spheres many a dark cloud. He created the
oceans and the mountains upon the collision of concomitant ever-flowing
currents: He opened their gates and their mighty waves were huge! I give
praise unto Him and to Him all praise is due. I testify that there is no God
but Him and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His
Messenger and that God chose him from the Supreme Company and sent
Him unto the Arab peoples and He was appointed - He that was truly guided
Himself - to guide others - He was indeed Talismanic and of the essence
(hulaahilan Telasmiyyan). Muhammad raised up the evidences and sealed
the Messages and Moslems obtained sight from Him. God manifested His
Religion through Him, may the salutation of God be upon Him and His Pure
Family.

People! turn ye repentantly unto My faction (shi'ah) and adhere to a pledge
of fealty to Me. Remain steadfast and persevering in the Faith with the best
certainty. Adhere steadfastly to the Successor of your Prophet in Whom
resides your salvation and in Whose love on the Day of Resurrection is your
safe haven! In Me resides the Hope and I am the One to be hoped for. I am
the One that standeth upon the Two Gulfs! (tutunj) I am the One that looketh

unto the Twin Rising-Places [or "Orients"]49 and the Twin Setting Places [or
"Occidents"]50. I truly did see with My own eyes [the Bounty of] God and
the Paradise! And this was as the seventh Heaven was moving in its orbit
and there in the great surging seas were the stars and their own orbits. I saw
also the earth rolled up as a short garment would be rolled up and it was
within a shell on the right sided Gulf which faces the East and the Twin
Gulfs.

Further out there are the Twin Bays (khalij) of water as if they are to the left
of the Twin Gulfs and I saw that the Circle that embraces these and the
Paradise and all that there is therein were naught but a ring on the finger of
Thy Lord. And in truth I saw the Sun when it was setting and it was like
unto a bird that seeketh its nest. And if it were not for the friction of the
head of Paradise and the mixing up of the Twin Gulfs and the Music of the
spheres all that are in heavens and the earth would hear the ebullition of heat
caused by the Sun's descent into the Black water - and that is the Warm
Fountain51. I know of the wonders of God's Work what no one knows but
God and I know what has been and what will be and what has been in the
First Sprinkling with those who preceded the First Adam52. All was
disclosed (kushifa) for Me53and I knew and all was taught Me and I have
learnt.

So hearken and do not raise a clamour. Were it not for My fear that you
might say: “Ali has become possessed or apostatised from His Faith” I shall
disclose unto you what and whereat they are and what you shall encounter
on the day of Resurrection. All that knowledge was entrusted unto Me and
thus I knew and the knowledge of all this was hidden from all the Prophets
except the Lord of this Dispensation (Shari'ah)54 of yours (Peace be upon
Him and His Family). He taught Me His knowledge and I taught Him My
knowledge.

Verily We are the Warners from immemorial times and We shall be unto
everlasting Warners from God55. Through Us will perish He that is going to
perish and by Us have obtained salvation all that have obtained salvation
and you shall not encompass that ability that is Ours. By the righteousness
of Him Whose power causeth the seed to germinate56 and Who breatheth the
spirit of life into all things, by Him Who alone hath power and grandeur! To
Me have the winds and the air and the birds of air been conquered; the
world and all that is therein was presented to me but I turned away from it. I

turned upside down the world and it was tilted away from Me. How can
subsequent events overcome Me?
I know all that is above the supreme Paradise and that which is below the
seventh Ocean, that which is in the highest heavens and that which is
between them and that which is below them. All this knowledge is derived
from an all-embracing knowledge and not from chronicled knowledge. I
swear by the Lord of the Great throne! If I wished I could inform you of
your forefathers and all your predecessors as to where they were, and from
whom they were and where they are now and how they came to be where
they are! How many of you are eating the property of his brother and is
drinking of the fountainhead of his father and yet he longeth for him and
wishes that they were with him!

O would that you knew! O would that ye knew! When that which is hidden
be manifest and that which is in the breasts were attained and conscience
were to disclose its hidden things, I swear by God you will have returned to
clay, and you will have had your "returns," and how many signs there are
between these "returns" how many those that have died or that have been
slain. (I know those that are in the craw of birds and those that are in the
belly of beasts and all mankind are between those that have already gone
and those that are being urged on). And if it were to be revealed to you all
that is with Me from time immemorial unto the end that has no end you
shall truly see many and wondrous events, many strange handiworks and all
that I comprehend.

I am the Master (sahib) of the First Creation before the First Noah, and if
you were to know what was between Adam and Noah of wondrous events
that I wrought and of nations that I caused to perish. And the true Word of
Thy Lord was fulfilled in them and evil is that which they worked" I am the
Master of the First Flood!57 I am the Master of the Second Flood!58 I am the
Master of the Deluge of Iram!59 I am the Master of the Secret Mysteries! I
am the Lord of 'Ad and its gardens!60 I am the Lord of Thamud and its
wondrous signs! I am the One that destroyed it, I am the One that caused the
Earthquakes! I am the One that caused their Return and their Perdition! I am
the Builder of those civilisations and their Destroyer! I cause their Expiry
and I cause them to be quickened! I am the First and the Last! I am the
External and Manifest61 and I am the Internal and Hidden! I am with the
Cycle (kawr) before the Cycle began! I am the Companion of the
Dispensation (dawr) before the Dispensation started! I was with the Pen
before the Pen and I am with the Tablet prior to the Tablet being revealed! I
am the Lord of the First Pre-existence! I am the Lord of Jabulqa and of
Jabulsa! I am the Master of Highest Stage (rafraf) and of Bahram! I am the

Qur‟an 7:133

Idem 29:14

One Who organised existence when there was no heaven as you have them
now nor earth as you know it now!

The Son of Suwairama said: "Are you, are you indeed that One?!" 'Ali
replied: "I am, I am that One! There is no other God But God Who is My
Lord and the Lord of all created things. Unto Him belongs the Creation and
the World of Revelation (amr). He it is Who has ordained all matters in His
Wisdom and heavens and earth are upraised in His Power. Methinks the
weak ones amongst you are saying; "Is this not the son of Abu-Talib Whom
the forces of Syria had overshadowed yesterday and He would not go out to
fight them and sent them Muhammad and Ibrahim?" But truly and assuredly
I shall fight Syria many times and I shall slay them many times. I shall fight
their armies at Siffin and I shall bring a new life unto the believer until that
thirst for justice in my chest be allayed. I shall fight for 'Ammar Yassir and
for Uways of Qaran many times. Let none say when? How? and in what
manner? and with whose assistance? How shall it be when you shall see the
Master of Syria saweth men with saws and cutteth them with trowels? But I
shall make him taste a painful retribution.

But rejoice now for the cause of all creation reverts unto Me on the morrow.
Let not this claim appear extravagant inasmuch as We have been vouchsafed
the knowledge of all fates and of all tribulations. and the knowledge of
interpretation and of the Revelation and the decisive Discourse (Faslu'l-
Khitab) and knowledge of all future calamities and catastrophes. There is
nothing whose knowledge escapes Us. This is truth and I shall see this One
[pointing to Husayn, Peace be upon Him] when His Light shall flow forth of
His eyes and I shall be present with Him a lengthy time that shall witness
earthquakes and eclipses. They that are believers will revolt in His company
from every corner. I swear by God! If I wished I would tell you of their
names every one of them and their descent from both parents, until the Day
of whose time is promised.

Then 'Ali said: "O Jabir! You are with the Truth now and you shall be with
the True One hereafter and in that true Cause you shall die. O Jabir! When
the Bell shall cry loud, when the stupor of the Nightmare shall enshroud
men, when the Cow shall speak, on that day there shall happen wondrous,
exceedingly wondrous Events, when the Fire shall be ignited in My sight,
when the Banner of the House of 'Uthman shall appear in the Black Valley,
when Basra shall be thrown into confusion and they shall seek to conquer
each other and each party shall seek the other, when the armies of Khurasan
shall begin to move, and when Shu'ayb the son of Salih of Tamim shall be
followed in Taliqan, and Sa'id of Shusha shall be obeyed in Khuzistan, and
the banner shall be raised up by the Amalekites of the Kurds, and the Arabs
shall seek victory over Armenia and the Slavs, and Heraclitus shall submit
to the patriarchs of Sinan in Constantinople, anticipate ye then the

Revelation of the Speaker of Mount Sinai62. This will appear with manifest
signs visible unto all, clearly perspicuous to them.
O but how many a wondrous sign I seek not to mention and how many
indications I have left undivulged! for I cannot find one who can bear them.
I am the One Who ordered Satan to bow down Adam!63 I am the One Who
raised Idris64 to a high station. I am the Agent whereby Jesus was enabled to
speak in His cradle while yet a Babe! I am the One who flattens the valleys
and Who sets the Earth to order and I am the One Who has divided it into
five parts, namely, land, sea, mountains, built, and unbuilt. I am the One
Who separated the Red Sea from Tarjim, and separated Aqim from Him. I
separated all from all! I am Tirathia, Janbutha, Barhilion, Aliuthoutha65. I
bring out of the Ocean that which is stored in it that it shall be cleared away
by the horses and men. take from it what you desire and leave what you
wish to leave.

He then gave 'Ammar-ibn-Yassir 12000 men who loved God and His
Apostle and each had 12000 battalions of angels to support them saying:
Rejoice for you are the best of brethren to each other for after this there shall
be a star (tarfatan) through which ye shall know some of the expounded
matter. The Mysteries of Evidence shall become clear to you when Bahram
and Keyvan (stars) shall rise together and become conjoined with exactness.
When shakings and earthquakes shall succeed each other swiftly and
banners shall be lifted up from the shores of Oxus to the Desert of Babylon
know ye then that I am the One Who causeth the winds the blow, I am the
One Who lifts your oppressions!

I am the Master of the Mount Sinai! I am that Manifest Light! I am that
Perspicuous and dazzling Evidence (that light of which an infinitesimal part
was disclosed unto Moses) and all that was vouchsafed unto Me by God the
Lord Of Glory.

I am the Master of the Gardens of eternal delight! I am the One that causeth
the Rivers to flow from the Water that emanates from the divine current, and
other Rivers which are of milk, and Rivers of pure Honey, and Rivers that
flow with wine, a delight unto those who partake. I am the One that hath
overshadowed hell when it was made to blaze and have overlooked its
several compartments: firstly the Hell of Sa'ir when it blazeth forth then the
Hell of Saqar and its fire and lastly the nethermost Hell which has been
preserved for the transgressor all of these have been preserved in the Valley
of Desolation. Again I swear by the Lord Who bringeth Dawn, He Who is
the Lord of all creation! Within it is kept eternally both Jibt and Taghut and

Note this key utterance: "...anticipate ye then the Revelation of the Speaker of Mount Sinai." This
indicates a future revelation or theophany which Baha‟u‟llah repeatedly identified as manifesting in himself. See
fn.24

Or, "I was present when Satan was ordered to bow down to Adam."

See Baha‟u‟llah, Tablets revealed, 148 (Lawh-i-Hikmat)

This sounds very close to Alitheia, "Truth," in Greek. Other terms seem also to be Greek sounding.

their servants and whomsoever disbelieveth in the Lord of this world and
the Kingdom on high.

I am the Maker and Sustainer (sani') of all the Regions of this world by the
Command of the One Who is the All-Knowing the All-Wise. I am the Word
through Which all things are consummated and through which the Universes
are brought into being. I am the One Who has made the regions of the earth
to be four and the islands to be seven: the Region of the South to be the
Depository of all Bounty, the Region of the North to be Powers and
Sovereignty, the Region of Sheba to be the Seat of earthquakes, and the
Desert Region to be the Seat of many a catastrophe. So Woe unto the cities
from those transgressors who will come to destroy and pervert justice. Woe
shall be when calamities come to transpire from that Government of
eunuchs, imbeciles, and effeminate rulers. On that Day all Regions will
bring forth false claimants claiming falsehoods. Oh! On that Day expect
eagerly your Supreme salvation and you shall see men accepting it by
troops66. On that Day God will make of the gravel of Najaf treasures of gold
and all of that will be sprinkled where the believer shall step his foot on it
and with that same dust of gold the unbeliever and the hypocrite shall be
exchanged and bartered. Then shall the value of red ruby be as nothing and
similarly other jewels and pearls. This shall be a most evident sign and when
it shall transpire the Light of God shall shine and His Glory (sat’ baha’ihi)
shall be effulgent and all that you wish for shall be made manifest and all
that is your highest desire shall become apparent.

O You who in your desires resemble cattle and the beasts of the field! How
shall it be with you when the banners of the sons of Kenan shall come upon
you and also that of 'Uthman the son of 'Anbatha in the battle fields of
Syria? Know truly that shall never be discerned by one related to Umayya or
to 'Ady."

Then He wept loudly (the salutations of God be upon Him!) and later
exclaimed; "O alas for the nations! Soon shall some hypocrites say that 'Ali
claimed Lordship (rububiyyat) for Himself but you should bear witness
thus: "'Ali truly is a created Being, a Servant, nourished of divine sustenance
and he that denies this let him be accursed of God."

Imam `Ali then descended and said; "I take refuge unto him Who hath the
Kingdoms of earth and Heaven! I seek succour from Him Who possesses all
Power and Grandeur, all Sovereignty and Authority from all that I fear and
pray to avoid!" O people! None shall utter these words but when tribulations
and calamities befall him the same will God dissipate through this prayer."
Jabir said: "Only those Words?" and the Imam 'Ali added thereunto another
thirteen words67 and left.

Translation of the “Sermon of Iftikhár”68

The Imám 'Alí said:

I am the brother of the Messenger of God and the Heir to His knowledge,
the treasury of His wisdom, and the Companion of His secret. There is not a
letter revealed by God in any of His Books whose intention does not point
towards me. He hath vouchsafed unto me the knowledge of what was from
eternity and what will happen unto the Day of Resurrection. To me hath
been vouchsafed the knowledge of past and future generations and their
genealogies. And to Me hath been given a thousand keys to a thousand
doors. The knowledge of the destinies of all things hath been granted unto
me. All these Gifts shall continue to flow through my Appointed Successors
(wasi's) as long as day is followed by night and night followed by day and
until all things return to God. For verily, He is the True Inheritor of all
things.

Unto me, too, hath been vouchsafed the Path, the Balance, the Banner, and
the Kawthar. I am the one who shall face the children of Adam on the Day
of Judgement and shall bring them to account and shall direct them to their
habitations. And verily, I am the punishment of fire meted unto the damned.
These are the bounties of God unto me. And should anyone deny that I shall
return after the Return69, or deny that I shall come back after the Raj'at70, or
should anyone reject the truth that I shall appear again, even as I have done
from the beginning that hath no beginning or even unto the end that hath no
end, he, verily, hath denied the truth of all of Us. And verily I say unto you,
he who denies any one of Us, hath denied God. I am the one who hath
summoned you; I am the companion of your prayers and invocations. I am
the Lord of retribution, and I am the Master of the signs and the Lord of the
wondrous symbols of guidance. I am cognisant of the mysteries of creation;
I am the One who brought the iron unto Men71. I am forever new and
forever pre-existent, the One who brought the Angels from out of their
habitations, the One who pledged an everlasting covenant with your spirits
on the dawn of creation and Who, on that day, asked, through the will of
God, the Self-subsisting, these words: "Am I not your Lord?" I am the Word
of God [Kalimat'u'lláh] which hath been uttered in the world of creation, the
Object of the covenant that hath been promised in the prayers and
salutations which lie in the reality of all created things. I am the name that
hath been invoked by orphans and by widows, the door to the city of
knowledge and the refuge of patience and forbearance. I am the upraised
flag of God, the companion of the banner of divine praise, the Lord of
infinite bounty and of infinite grace. But should I tell you all that I am, you

would doubtless disbelieve Me. For I am also the slayer of oppressors, the
treasury of divine favours in this world and of the next. I am the master of
the believers, the guide of those who seek the way. The truth is Mine and
certitude is at My side. Leadership is Mine and the righteous shall follow
Me. I am the first to acknowledge faith, the Cord of God that shall not be
broken, the One who will raise the world to justice even as it hath been
brought low by oppression. I am the companion of Gabriel and the
archangel Michael is beside Me. I am the tree of guidance, and the essence
of righteousness. I shall gather together the world of creation through the
Word of God that gathers together all things. I give life unto humanity and I
am the treasury of all divine commands. To Me hath been given the
Luminous Pen and the Crimson Camel72.

I am the gate-keeper of certitude, the Commander of the Faithful, the friend
of Khidir. I am the One who shall conquer Syria and destroy the arrogant. I
have existed throughout the past, and, verily, I have never uttered a
falsehood. Through a word from Me, truth hath been separated from error,
for I speak through divine inspiration and know of the stars and
constellations. God hath commanded me to ordain their orbit and
vouchsafed unto me their knowledge. With Me are the saffron and crimson
coloured flags and I shall remain concealed until the time shall come for My
manifestation in a great Cause. Then, shall I grant and withhold as I wish.
None can describe Me except Myself, for I shall protect the faith of my
Lord. I am the One Whom my Cousin chose, Who was present when His
sacred remains were shrouded. I am the Guardian appointed by God, the
Most Merciful God, the companion of Khidr73 and Aaron, and the friend of
Moses and Joshua, the son of Nun. I am the Lord of Paradise, He Who hath
caused the rain to fall and the earth to quake and the sun and moon to be
eclipsed. I am the Object of the creation of multitudes and it is I who shall
slay those who do not believe.

Verily, I am the leader of the righteous, the Sacred Fane frequented by all,
the upraised firmament, the fathomless ocean. I am the Holy of Holies, the
pillar that supports humanity. I am the Possessor of the Greatest Cause. Is
there anyone who can speak beside Me? I am fire itself. At a single Word of
God, at one utterance of the Prophet, I would put within you My sword's
length and send you hurrying unto your next abode. I am the meaning of
Ramadán and the night of Qadr74 mentioned in the Mother Book. My
utterance is decisive, for I am the Súrah of Praise75. I am the purpose of
prayer itself, whether at home or when travelling. I am the purpose of

In Islamic tradition, Khadír was a servant of God who had been taught special knowledge and was
sent to be a companion and teacher to Moses (see Qur'án 18:65-82). Khadír may not be a reference to a person,
but, rather, to the inspirational Source. In this sermon, the Imám 'Alí is, in a sense, the Muse to all those inspired
before, similar to Gabriel in the Qur'án 2:97.

fasting, and the sacred anniversaries in the months of the year. I am the Lord
of Resurrection and Judgement, the One who can remove the yoke that lies
heavy on the people of Muhammad. I am the Gate through which all shall
pass who worship God; I am His worshipper, and one created by Him. I am
both the witness and the One witnessed to, the possessor of the green
canopy, He Whose name is mentioned in the heavens and the earth, Who is
the travelling companion of the Messenger of God throughout the heavens,
for with Me is the Book and the sacred Arc. I am the One who befriended
Seth, the son of Adam76], the companion of Moses and Irám, and all
metaphors and analogies pertain unto Me. Who indeed is there to compare
with Me? For I am the heaven-sent rain that causeth each blade of green to
grow, the Lord of this nether realm Who brings forth the rains when all have
lost their hope in its downpour. I am He Who summoneth the mighty
lightning and causeth the ocean to rise and swell, the One who speaketh to
the sun and causeth the stunning trumpet to blast forth. I am the refuge of all
that have obeyed God, and verily, God is my Lord and there is no other God
but He. For falsehood offers illusions, but truth giveth thee everlasting
sovereignty.

I shall soon depart from amongst you, but be watchful and aware; be on
your guard against the tests and tribulations caused by the 'Ummayyds and
their worldly powers. And after they shall pass away, the kingdom will
revert to the 'Abbasids77 who will bring both sorrow and happiness to
mankind. And they shall build a city called Baghdád, which shall be
between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Woe betide men in those latter days,
for amongst them will rise the oppressors among My people, who shall
build palaces for themselves and courts and tabernacles. For they shall seek
supremacy through intrigue and impiety. Two score and two kings shall rule
among the children of the 'Abbasids, after whose reign shall come to pass
the Most Great Tribulation on the surface of the earth. Then shall the True
Qá'im rise up once more. Then shall I show My Face amongst men, and it
shall be as luminous as the face of the moon amid the other stars. But note
well the ten signs associated with my coming. The first sign shall be the
inversion of banners on the highways of Kúfa78; the second, the abeyance of
true worship and the prescribed prayers; the third, the end of true
pilgrimage. The fourth sign shall be an eclipse in the lands of Khorasán 79,
the gathering of constellations and the appearance of comets in the sky.

Seth is named in Genesis as the son of Adam, and he lived for 912 years. (See Gen. 4:25-5:8.) Here,
however, the reference is to the notion that Companion (Sahib), in a sense, means that the Eternal "I" was with
Seth (in Arabic, Shayth, the son of Adam). In Luke, Seth is an ancestor to Christ.

The family of Abbas, the uncle of Muhammad.

A city near the Euphrates River, 177km south of Baghdád. Formerly a Mesopotamian city, Kúfa was
re-founded by the Arabs in 638, and was the capital of the Islamic Empire during the caliphate of the Imám 'Alí.
For a time, it also served as the centre for the 'Abbasid caliphate. This and the following references are to
catastrophes and spiritual reverses in the fortunes of truth.

A mountainous and arid province in northeastern Irán. The territory served as the capital of the
eastern provinces of Islám during the time of the early 'Abbasid Caliphs. Khorásan was first invaded by the Oghuz
Turks in 1153 and again in 1157. The Mongols devastated the region between 1220 and 1222. Timur invaded in
1383\.

There shall be chaos and confusion, massacre, pillage and robbery in the
world. Many other signs shall there be too, surpassing all these signs, among
which is the sign of wonderment. But when all these signs have passed
away, then, verily, shall the Qá'im Himself arise in truth.

O people, sanctify the Lord your God from all similitudes, for every
reference to Him fails, and whosoever tries to limit the Creator by
description or comparison hath verily disbelieved in His Book, which is the
Book of God's Own Utterance.

Then He80 said: How great the blessedness of those who love Me and who
sacrifice their life in My path and who get exiled because of Me! They truly
are the repositories of God's knowledge, nor shall they be put to fear on the
Day of the Great Terror.

I am the Light of God, Who can never be extinguished; I am the Mystery of
God that can not be concealed.

Translation of Sermon of Ma'rifat bin-Nurániyyat81

This is that which Salmán82 and 'Abú Dharr83 related of the utterances of the
Commander of the Faithful, 'Alí - Peace be upon Him!'Alí said:

He whose acceptance of my guardianship is based on external reality more
than internal truth, he is that one "whose balances will be light"84 Those
whose scale will be light, their souls will be in perdition85 O Salmán! The
faith of no believer will attain perfection unless and until he recognizeth Me
with luminousness. If he attaineth unto this, then he hath truly attained faith;
he is the one whose heart is tested with true faith, whose breast is dilated in
true Islám and whose faith is based on discernment. He who is convicted of
shortcoming in this cognition - he will be a doubter, immersed in disbelief.

O Salmán! and O Jandáb!86 In truth, recognition of Me in luminousness is
the recognition of God (Ma`rifat Alláh ) and Recognition and knowledge of
God is indeed knowledge of Me; this is what is meant by sincere devotion.87
Mankind was not ordered by God to seek naught except to attain unto this
unity (tawhid). They were commanded to worship but One God.88 And they
have been commanded no more than this: "To worship God, offering Him
sincere devotion, being true (in faith), to establish regular prayer; and to
practice regular charity; and that is the Religion Right and Straight."89

"Worshipping God" is belief in Divine Unity. "Sincere devotion" and "being
true in Faith" (haneef) is confession of the Prophethood of the Prophet.
"Establishing Prayer" is my Guardianship and Friendship (waláyat or
wiláyat) He who pledges fealty and friendship unto Me hath truly
established the obligatory prayer. Yet, this matter is hard, exceedingly hard!
"Regular charity" in the above verse is confession to the Imámate. All this is
the true religion.90

Salmán-i-Farsí (Salmán the Persian), known as Salmán the Good, one of the faithful Companions of
the Prophet . Bahá`u`lláh mentions him briefly in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, p. 65. The Báb, in the Bayán-i-Farsí (Wahíd 5,
Báb 11), notes that he was one of only three souls (the other two were `Abú Dharr and Miqdád) who remained
truly faithful to the Covenant of Islám.

Jundub `ibn Junadah, known as Abú Dharr Al-Ghifarí, was a shepherd of the Ghafarí tribe which
lived in the Waddan valley, near Mecca. He was known for his courage, his calmness and his far sightedness and
also for the repugnance he felt against the idols which his people worshipped. Hearing of the new Prophet, he
journeyed to Mecca and was taught the new Faith by `Alí and attained the presence of Muhammad.According to
tradition, the Prophet had said, "The earth does not carry nor the heavens cover a man more true and faithful than
`Abú Dharr.". Bahá`u`lláh, Epistle,19 calls him "a prince of the nations

Qur`án 7:9

Idem 23:103 and 101:8

Abú Dharr.

Or "pure religion" (ad-Dín al-Khális). See Qur`án 7:29, 39:2, 3, 40:

Qur‟an 9:31 and 98:5

Arabic: za_likad dinul qay yimu. See Qur`án 30:30

The Holy Qur'án hath testified that true Faith is recognition of divine unity
and confession to both the Prophet and the Imámate. He who attaineth unto
both hath fulfilled his faith. A true believer is the one who does not reject
any matter pertaining to Us, for God Himself hath dilated His Breast such
that He may accept all. He will not doubt or be mistrustful. He who cavileth
why and wherefore becometh a disbeliever. We are, verily, the Cause of God
(Nahnu Amru`lláh)!

O Salmán! O Jandáb! Verily, God hath made me His Trustee over His
creation and His Vicegerent on His earth, in His territories, and over His
servants. He hath given Me what no artist can depict and no man of
understanding can truly comprehend. If thou wert to know Me in this
fashion, thou shalt attain unto true belief (imán).

O Salmán! God, exalted be He saith: "Nay, seek God's help with patient
perseverance and prayer: it is indeed hard except to those who bring a lowly
spirit." "Patient perseverance" is Muhammad and "Prayer" is my Wilayat
Thus, that is why God hath declared it is hard. He doth not reveal the Two91
are hard. In truth, My Guardianship is perplexing only to those who bring a
lowly spirit. These latter are they who have sought discernment using the
light of My guidance.

O Salmán! We are the Mystery of God (Sirru`lláh) that shalt not remain
hidden. We are His light that shalt never be extinguished, His Grace that is
expected from none other save Him. Muhammad is our first, Muhammad
our last, Muhammad our all!92 He who recognizeth Us in this regard hath, in
truth, consummated his Faith.

O Salmán, and O Jandáb! Muhammad and I were the Light that was voicing
forth the divine eulogy before any other reality started to praise Him. We
were the cause of illumination unto all creation. This one Light was divided
by God into two portions, the Chosen "Mustafa"93, and His Vicegerent,
"Murtada"94, and vouchsafed unto creation. God, exalted be His Glory, said
to each half, "Be Muhammad!", "Be 'Alí!"95 It is thus that the Prophet said:
"I am from 'Alí and 'Alí is from Me. None can give forth My Trust but
Myself and 'Alí."96 This refers to our unity in the worlds of Light and Spirit.
Similar is this divine utterance: "and If He dieth or is slain."97 "Dieth" refers
to the passing away of the Prophet. "Slain" refers to the martyrdom of the

A subtle point is being made here. In the cited verse (2:45), "patient perseverance" is sabr, a
masculine noun, which requires a masculine pronoun. Yet, "prayer" is salát, which is feminine. The pronoun used
in the verse (i.e. "it is indeed hard") is feminine, and thus could only refer to the aforementioned feminine noun.
`Alí then proceeds to connote salát with acceptance of his Wilayat or Guardianship, which, according to this
interpretation, is exceedingly more difficult to attain than recognizing the Prophethood of Muhammad

See Baha‟u‟llah, Íqán, 153

He who is chosen as an Envoy (Prophet Muhammad)

He in whom God is pleased (Imám `Alí)

The imperative used in both cases is Kún, ["Be" or "Exist"] (i.e. the usage of the letters "B" and "E")

Qur`án 3:61, “Our Selves [anfusaná wa anfusakum] ourselves, and yourselves"

Idem 3:144,"Will it be that, when he dieth or is slain".

Successor98, for the Two are one Entity, one Signification and one Light.
Their unity is in purpose and attributes. They are different in Their corporeal
entity and their Names. But in the world of spirit, They are One Spirit. In
Spirit, He said, "Thou art the Spirit within My Limbs." In the world of
bodies, He saith: "Thou art of Me and I am of Thine. Thou shalt inherit after
Me."

Again, there is the Divine Utterance: "Send ye blessings on Him and salute
Him with all respect."99 "Sending blessings on Him" refereth to
Muhammad. "Salute Him" refers to the Successor. No benefit shall accrue
unto thee if thou sendest blessings unto the Messenger and His Message if
they are not coupled with saluting His Successor in His Wiláyat.

O Salmán! O Jandáb! Muhammad was the One speaking and I was the One
silent. Inevitably, in every Dispensation, there is the One Who speaketh and
the One Who is silent.100 Muhammad is the Master of Ingathering101 and I
am the Master of Resurrection.102Muhammad is the Warner103 and I am the
"guide."104 Muhammad is the Lord of Paradise and I am the Lord of the
Return. Muhammad is the Lord of the Pool105 and I am the One entrusted
with the Banner.106 Muhammad is the Lord of the Keys107 and I am the Lord
of Paradise and Fire. Muhammad is the Lord of Revelation and I am the
Lord of Inspiration. Muhammad is the Lord of signs and I am Master of the
miracles. Muhammad is the Seal of the Prophets108 and I am the Seal of the
Successors.109 Muhammad is the Master Who raised the Call and I am the
One entrusted with both the Sword110 and Sovereignty. Muhammad is the
Most Generous Prophet and I am the Straight Path. Muhammad is the One
mentioned in the verse as "most kind and merciful"111 and I am the One
alluded to as "Most High, Most Great."112

Reference to the assassination of Imám `Alí in 661 A.D.

Qur`án 33:56

In the Bahá`í Dispensation, these are Bahá`u`lláh and `Abdu`l-Bahá`, respectively, for the latter
rarely took up His blessed Pen during the time of His Father.

Qur`án 42:7 and 64:9

Idem 6:128, reference to the Qur`ánic verses that eschatologically there will be a Day of Ingathering
and a Day of Resurrection

This alludes to Qur`án 13:7: "But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide

Lord of the Pool (Arabic: sáhib al-hawz) is a well-recognized title of `Alí. "Pool" refers to the pool
of refreshing water in Paradise which the sincere believers will drink from. See Qur`án 15:45, 37:45 and 76:5-6.

i.e. the Banner of Victory in the latter days

Qur`án 38:50. See also Qur`án 6:59, 39:63 and 42:12

Arabic: Wasiyys. "Seal of the Successors" is another title of `Alí. Most interesting point is made here
because, after `Alí, there were, in fact, ten more Wasiyys, or eleven if the Qá`im is included. So clearly, this means
that "Seal" does not indicate "last" temporally. On this subject, see Seena Fazel and Khazeh Fananapazir, „A
Bahá`í Approach to the Claim of Finality in Islám‟, Journal of Bahá`í Studies, 5, no:3 (1993) 17-40; Momen,
Islam, 34-59.

In the Súriy-i-Vafá, Bahá`u`lláh speaks of His Name as the "Sword of His Revelation between
heaven and earth ... through which truth is separated from error, even from now until the Day when mankind shall
stand before the Lord of the worlds." See Baha‟u‟llah, Tablets revealed, 185-186

Qur`án 9:128

O Salmán! God, exalted be He, saith: "He causes the Spirit to descend upon
any Servant He willeth."113[ This Spirit but descends unto the One entrusted
with the Command and the Decree. I give life to the dead. I know what is in
the heavens and what is on the earth. I am, in truth, the Perspicuous Book.114
I give life unto the dead and with Me is the knowledge of all that is in the
heavens and the earth. I am the Perspicuous Book. O Salmán! Muhammad
is the Upraiser of the Proof,115 and I am the Proof of the One True God unto
His creatures. It is this Testimony that empowered the Spirit of God 116 to
ascend unto heaven. I am the One who enabled Noah to sail his Ark. I was
present with Jonah in the belly of the Whale.117 I argued with Moses in the
sea.118 I caused earlier peoples to suffer loss; I bestowed the knowledge of
the Prophets and Saints and Their Decisive Utterance unto them. With Me is
the Prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad completed. I caused rivers and
oceans to flow and caused fountains to burst forth. I caused the world to be
revolutionized and I bring about the Chastisement of the Day of
Overshadowing Gloom.119 I am Khidír Who taught Moses120. I taught David
and Solomon121. I am Dhu'l Qarnayn122. I am the One who raised the
Firmament123 and flattened the Earth124. I am the Summoner from a near
Place125.I am the Creature on the Earth126. The Prophet addressed Me

Idem 40.

Idem 27:1, 28:2. It is interesting that Bahá`u`lláh confirms these passages in His last major work,
the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, by quoting the Imám `Alí as saying: The Commander of the Faithful (Imám
`Alí) hath said: "I am He Who can neither be named, nor described." And likewise He hath said: "Outwardly I am
an Imám; inwardly I am the Unseen, the Unknowable." Abú-Ja`far-i-Túsí hath said: "I said to Ábí `Abdi`lláh:
`You are the Way mentioned in the Book of God, and you are the Impost, and you are the Pilgrimage.` He replied:
`O man! We are the Way mentioned in the Book of God,--exalted and glorified be He--and We are the Impost, and
We are the Fast, and We are the Pilgrimage, and We are the Sacred Month, and We are the Sacred City, and We
are the Kaaba of God, and We are the Qiblih of God, and We are the Face of God.`" Jabír hath said that Abú-
Ja`far--peace be upon him--spoke to him as follows: "O Jabír! Give heed unto the Bayán (Exposition) and the
Má`ání (Significances)." He --peace be upon him--added: "As to the Bayán, it consisteth in thy recognition of
God--glorified be He--as the One Who hath no equal, and in thy adoration of Him, and in thy refusal to join
partners with Him. As to the Má`ání, We are its meaning, and its side, and its hand, and its tongue, and its cause,
and its command, and its knowledge, and its right. If We wish for something, it is God Who wisheth it, and He
desireth that which We desire." (Bahá`u`lláh, Epistle, 112-113)

Qur`án 4:174

Jesus Christ.

The story of Jonah is briefly recounted in Qur`án 37:139-148

Idem 18:78. In the Khutbat`ul-Iftikhár (The Sermon of Glorification), the Imám claims the station of
the companion to Khadír. See fn. 69

Idem 18:83. The Arabic phrase Dhul-Qarnayn literally means "two-horned one" or "lord of two
ages." Anything with duality is suggestive of the two natures of these Immaculate Souls (such as the Imáms);
while treading on earth, they walk in the immensity of space and heaven. Bahá`u`lláh writes of such souls: “These
ancient Beings, though delivered from the womb of their mother, have in reality descended from the heaven of the
will of God. Though they be dwelling on this earth, yet their true habitations are the retreats of glory in the realms
above. Whilst walking amongst mortals, they soar in the heaven of the divine presence. Without feet they tread the
path of the spirit, and without wings they rise unto the exalted heights of divine unity. With every fleeting breath
they cover the immensity of space, and at every moment traverse the kingdoms of the visible and the invisible.”

the earth, and lead men to God.

saying: "O 'Alí! Thou art the One endowed with the Two stations. Thou art
present both in the Beginning and the End." O Salmán! The One slain with
Us will not die. The One Who is in Occultation from amongst Us is never
absent. None can compare with Us. I am the One Who spoke through the
Utterance of Jesus when He was still cradled127. I am Noah. I am Abraham. I
am Sálih Who possessed the She-Camel as His Sign128. I am the One Who
causeth the Commotion.129 I am also the Trembling.130 I am the Protected
Tablet131 and in My possession is all Its Knowledge. I appear in
Appearances132 as God willeth. He that seeth Them seeth Me. He that seeth
Me seeth Them. In all truth, We are the Light of God that changeth not and
His effulgence that is not extinguished. O Salmán! The honour of every Sent
One is through Us, but do not call us Lords; praise Us as thou willeth.
Salvation and Perdition both are effected through Us.

O Salmán! He that believeth in all truth as I have expounded it is truly a
believer whose heart hath been tested and proven. He that doubteth and
hesitateth, he hath reneged on the Faith, although outwardly he sayeth that
he believes in the Wiláyat133. I, and the Guides of My Family, the Imáms,
are the Hidden Mystery of God134 and His Guardians135. Our Cause is One,
Our Mystery is One and Our Unity is absolute. If thou maketh distinctions,
thou wilt be among the ones lost. We appear and have Our Manifestation in
every age as the All Merciful willeth. All woe betide the One Who denieth
Us! None shall gainsay these except the one whose heart, eyes and hearing
are sealed.

O Salmán! I am as the Father of every believer. I am the Catastrophe 136. I
am the Approaching Calamity. I am the Inevitable. I am the Impending
One137. I am the Deafening Trumpet Blast138. I am the Supreme Test. We are
the Signs, the Significances and the Countenance of God139 When My Name
was written on the Throne, It attained Its Serenity. When It was inscribed on
the firmaments, They were upraised. When written on the Earth, It was
adorned. When It was inscribed on the Wind, It carried with It fruition.

Qur`án 19:30-33

Idem 79:6-7: "One Day, everything that can be in commotion will be in violent commotion,
Followed by oft-repeated (commotions)."

Idem 99

Idem 85:22. See also Baha‟u‟llah, Prayers And Meditations (Wilmette:Baha‟i publishing Trust,
1987,CLXXVI, 265) "This, verily, is the Day wherewith Thy Scriptures, and Thy Books, and Thy Tablets, have
been adorned. And He Who now speaketh is, in truth, the Well-guarded Treasure, and the Hidden Secret, and the
Preserved Tablet, and the Impenetrable Mystery, and the Sealed Book."

i.e. Theophanies

Guardianship and Vicegerency

Qur`án 6:61 and 74:31

Qur`án 101:1 and 69:4

Idem 40:18: "Warn them of the Day that is (ever) drawing near, when the hearts will (come) right up
to the throats to choke (them)."

Idem 80:33: "when there comes the Deafening Noise: That Day shall a man flee from his own
brother."

Among other titles, Bahá`u`lláh refers to the Imáms as "those unquenchable lights of divine
guidance". See Baha‟u‟llah, Íqán,144

When written on the Lightning, It caused it to shine. When written on the
Oasis, It brought nourishment. When inscribed on the Light, It caused it to
be Luminous. When inscribed on the Clouds140, It generated Their
Outpouring Grace, and when inscribed on the Thunder141, it made the
Thunder quiescent. That Name caused the Night142 to be deep in its
darkness, and when inscribed on the Day143, It made It luminous and
radiant144.
