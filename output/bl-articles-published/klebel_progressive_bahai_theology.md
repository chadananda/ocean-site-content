> **Abstract:**  
>   
> This commentary on Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet results in these tentative and preliminary conclusions:
> 
> 1.  The primary focus of Bahá'í studies must by on the Writings of the Faith, and the philosophical understanding and interpretation need to follow and be enlightened by the Revelation. Attempting to use philosophical categories and trying to understand the spiritual reality in materialistic scientific ways must be called spiritual materialism like the transpersonal philosophy of Ken Wilber.
> 2.  Therefore, the relationship between the spiritual and material needs to be re-evaluated. Bahá'u'lláh stated that the two aspects of creation, the active and the passive, the form and the receiver, the material and the spiritual are the same and are different. As a guiding principle of this understanding the Bahá'í concept of unity in diversity can be used, as well as, the philosophical understanding of Teilhard de Chardin about the unity of spirit and matter. The relationship between the whole and the part needs to be re-defined from this point of view as well.
> 3.  The meaning and importance of the sentence "The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the Prophets" should be further followed up in terms of the writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, talking about the Spirit of Faith and the Holy Spirit. This emanation is a spiritual process, not a materialistic or historically provable fact, and must be considered in any study of philosophy from a Bahá'í perspective.
> 4.  The Dialogical Thinking, as presented by Franz Rosenzweig, Martin Buber and Ferdinand Ebner can assist in understanding the importance of the "Word" in the I-Thou relationship and the Divine Word, the Manifestation, as the origin, the beginning of all that is. This thinking introduces some philosophical understanding of the fact that God is unknowable, in the sense of substantial thinking, but man is created to know and to worship God in the personal-dialogical way, which denotes the spiritual aspect of reality and is expressed in prayer.
> 5.  The last, but perhaps the most important conclusion of this paper, is the obligation to look at modern philosophy and distinguish between the findings and statements of modern philosophers. There are philosophies that are words leading to words and thereby dealing only with "that which they comprehend". On the other hand, there are modern philosophers, there are philosophical ideas and visions of contemporary thinking, that are based on the essence and the fundamentals that have been revealed by and emanate from the Prophets of the past and the Prophets of today, the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. And there are, certainly some philosophers, who are in the middle, having only partially recognized this spirit of the Prophet.
> 
> In every case it is the task of the student of Bahá'í theology to use discrimination and apply it according to the Pauline statement: "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good." (1 Thessalonians 5:21)

  L aw˙-i- Hikmat, B ahá’u’lláh’s T a b l et

of Wisd om
Towar ds a P rogr e s siv e Bahá ’í Th eology

Wolfgang A. Klebel

Introduction

In writing a paper on Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of Wisdom, an
attempt is made to appreciate some aspects of this Tablet of
Bahá’u’lláh in a personal reflection on His Revelation. He has called
this Revelation a “Beauteous,” (KA 611) and a “Most Potent
Revelation” (GWB 95) and has encouraged us to explore this
“ Mysterious and Transcendent,” (GWB 325) this “Perspicuous and
Luminous Revelation.” (GWB 196) We experience often enough this
Revelation as “Bewildering and Challenging.” (GWB 254)

This commentary should be understood as an attempt to respond
to this bewildering challenge, to see the perspicuity and the
transcendent mystery of this Revelation and how to solve the
apparent contradiction between the terms “mysterious and
transcendent” on the one hand and “perspicuous and luminous” on
the other2. Responding to the Revelation of the Manifestation
becomes the center and standard of our philosophical and
theological discourse; the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh must be the
point of departure of all Bahá’í theological thinking and only in this
sense, and in following the Covenant3, will theological studies
promote unity rather than disunity, as it has happened in previous
Dispensations.

No external criteria can be used to judge any Divine Revelation;
it is the internal consistency and the life- and world-changing power
that gives proof of the reality and truth of the Manifestation.
Bahá’u’lláh states

> Say: The first and foremost testimony establishing His
> truth is His own Self. Next to this testimony is His
> Revelation. For whoso faileth to recognize either the one
> or the other He hath established the words He hath
> revealed as proof of His reality and truth. (GWB 105)
Shoghi Effendi called this process a revolution in the life of
mankind:

120         Law˙-i-Hikmat

> For no more convincing proof could be adduced
> demonstrating the regenerating spirit animating the
> Revelations proclaimed by the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh than
> their power to transform what can be truly regarded as one
> of the most backward, the most cowardly, and perverse of
> peoples into a race of heroes, fit to effect in turn a similar
> revolution in the life of mankind. (ADJ 18)
It needs to be noted that these reflections on the Tablet of
Wisdom do not attempt to describe or comment on the Tablet as a
whole, the author would neither be able to provide this, nor does he
have the linguistic requirements to make such an attempt.
Consequently, this paper selects specific topics from this Tablet and
reflects only the thoughts of this writer to these verses, not at all
presenting a complete commentary of this Tablet or any kind of
official interpretation of the Sacred Writings of the Bahá’í Faith.

To select special verses from this Tablet for reflection appears to
be justified, when considering the statement of Bahá’u’lláh “that in
each verse of the Tablet of Hikmat an ocean is concealed.” This
statement is reported by Adib Taherzadeh in his book The
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.4 Therefore, every verse of this Tablet has
an inexhaustible multitude of meanings and the presented
reflections are only one way of understanding a particular verse.

This, of course, implies that whenever meaning is found in the
Writings, there is always an immeasurable amount of truth, revealed
in these Writings, either not known at all, or not yet understood.
Whatever is confirmed and communicated in this paper, we should
never forget the warnings expressed by Bahá’u’lláh, not to reject
what cannot be understood at this time and to implore God to open
our hearts to a more true understanding and a deeper appraisal of
the inexhaustible treasure of this Revelation, as He stated:

> O servant! Warn thou the servants of God not to reject
> that which they do not comprehend. Say, implore God to
> open to your hearts the portals of true understanding that
> ye may be apprised of that of which no one is apprised.
> Verily, He is the Giver, the Forgiving, the Compassionate.

(TB 188)
Consequently, the reader is encouraged, in true consultation, to
add her/his understanding of these verses to this paper;5 in a
communication of different opinions the truth will become clearer
and the depth of meaning can be more richly explored. This paper,
therefore, is nothing else than a preliminary attempt to understand
today’s thinking and philosophizing in the light of this “Mysterious
and Transcendent,” (GWB 325) this “Perspicuous and Luminous”
Revelation. (GWB 196)

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         121

While most of these reflections are presented here following the
sequence of the Tablet of Wisdom, which is commented upon in its
overall structure and sequence, the following special issues will be
elaborated more thoroughly, whenever these issues seem to be
presented in the Tablet.

We will specifically comment on the idea of Progressive
Theology; on the consequences of Philosophical Error; and on the
theory of Form and Matter and other similar oppositional concepts.
Another question will be raised about the Fundamentals of
Philosophy and what a True Philosopher is, according to Bahá’u’lláh.
Finally, the issue of Spiritual Materialism will be discussed in this
context and the Philosophy of Dialogical Thinking will be applied to
the understanding of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

Ultimately, the heuristic value of these findings for a Bahá’í
philosophy will be suggested, not so much in definite conclusions,
but rather in the direction in which such a potential philosophy may
develop.

Progressive Theol ogy

This topic is not directly mentioned, but implied in the Tablet,
and it is presented here in the beginning, as it appears to this writer
to be an integral part of the following reflections on the Tablet. The
term Progressive Theology is obviously coined in relation to the term
of Progressive Revelation, which is a Bahá’í principle. This principle
indicates that the successive appearances of the Manifestations of
God throughout history are for the purpose of progressively
revealing the mysteries of God to humankind throughout the ages.

In the Bahá’í understanding of religion, there is only one religion
of God and all major religions are consecutive and progressive steps
of this one religion. Consequently, the concept of Progressive
Revelation corresponds with the idea that humankind is evolving
and maturing over time and every Revelation of God is presented at
the level of understanding, which humanity has at that specific
period. Corresponding to the Progressive Revelations that occurs
every five hundred to one thousand years, there is a process during
the period from the appearance of one Manifestation to the next,
where theology or the understanding of this Revelation makes
progress, which is here called Progressive Theology.6

During this period humankind is improving spiritually,
philosophy and sciences are progressing, the understanding of the
world is growing, and this will further promote a better
understanding of the previous Revelation.7 What has to be stressed
in this context is the fact that the human progress of spirituality,

122         Law˙-i-Hikmat

philosophy and science is not independent of the previous
Revelation, as it is usually assumed by secular historians. In the
Tablet of Wisdom, Bahá’u’lláh specifically mentions the fact that it
is the Manifestation who aids philosophers, when He said:

> A true philosopher would never deny God nor His
> evidences, rather would he acknowledge His glory and
> overpowering majesty which overshadow all created things.
> Verily We love those men of knowledge who have brought
> to light such things as promote the best interests of
> humanity, and We aided them through the potency of Our
> behest, for well are We able to achieve Our purpose. (TB
> 150)
Further, Bahá’u’lláh stated that the Manifestation of God is
directing and causing the prevalence of philosophy in one country or
in one period of time:

> Consider Greece. We made it a Seat of Wisdom for a
> prolonged period. However, when the appointed hour
> struck, its throne was subverted, its tongue ceased to speak,
> its light grew dim and its banner was hauled down. Thus do
> We bestow and withdraw. Verily thy Lord is He Who
> giveth and divesteth, the Mighty, the Powerful. (TB 149)
That the Manifestation of God is the cause of all scientific progress
is clearly stated by Bahá’u’lláh:

> O Inmost Heart of this Temple! We have made thee the
> dawning-place of Our knowledge and the dayspring of Our
> wisdom unto all who are in heaven and on earth. From thee
> have We caused all sciences to appear, and unto thee shall
> We cause them to return. And from thee shall We bring
> them forth a second time. Such, indeed, is Our promise,
> and potent are We to effect Our purpose. Erelong shall
> We bring into being through thee exponents of new and
> wondrous sciences, of potent and effective crafts, and shall
> make manifest through them that which the heart of none
> of Our servants hath yet conceived. (SLH 35, emphasis
> added)
These quotes indicate that it is the Manifestation Who bestows
and withdraws, Who aids and causes the progress of philosophy,
Who promotes the progress of human science and understanding in
general. It is the Manifestation of God Who initiates and promotes
this process of increasing understanding we call Progressive
Theology.

This process is circular: the Manifestation through His
Revelation promotes human progress and this progress then assists in

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          123

better understanding the Revelation of the Manifestation, which
again improves the scientific inquiry. In this paper this circular
process is presupposed and it is the key to this presentation.

As a matter of fact, it is this writer’s personal experience that has
pointed to this conclusion. Contemporary philosophical writings
were recognized and found almost verbatim in the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, improving their philosophical meaning. At other times
the opposite happened; modern philosophical thoughts were better
understood by this writer after a deepening in the Bahá’í
Revelation.8

That this progress of science and philosophy can provide insight
into the Bahá’í theology and in a circular process improves the
science and philosophy as well, has been stated by the Universal
House of Justice:

> Those believers with the capacity and opportunity to do so
> have repeatedly been encouraged in their pursuit of
> academic studies by which they are not only equipped to
> render much needed services to the Faith, but are also
> provided with the means to acquire a profoun d
> insight into t h e m e aning and t h e i mplications of
> t h e Ba há'í T eac hings. They discover also that the
> perceptions gained from a deeper understanding of the
> Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh clarify the subjects of their
> academic inquiry. (UHJ, 1998 Mar 19, Compilation on
> Scholarship; emphasis added)
Most recently, the Universal House of Justice has mentioned the
same idea again and included not only religious people but even
those who do not have a religious inclination in this process of
increasing understanding:

> Bahá’ís will come to increasingly appreciate that the Cause
> they serve represents the arrowhead9 of an awakening
> taking place among people everywhere regardless of
> religious background and indeed among many with no
> religious leaning. (OCF p. iii, emphasis added)
> The Bahá’í Faith is the “arrowhead,” of an awakening; the tip of
the process of change in the thinking of humanity, and it is noted
that this awakening, this re-thinking, is not restricted to Bahá’ís, or
religious people, but even includes many “with no religious leaning.”
As will be pointed out, the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is the cause of
this new thinking, this revolutionary development of science and
philosophy, as He stated when He wrote “ We caused all sciences to
appear.” (ibid, footnote 8)

124         Law˙-i-Hikmat

It needs to be noted again that this is a circular and ongoing
process. The Revelation causes the sciences and arts to develop; the
study of these sciences and arts provide means to better understand
the Revelation; and this better understanding will improve the
academic inquiry of the research and study.

The figure below describes this circular process in the words of
Bahá’u’lláh on top, at the right side and at the bottom of the figure;
and on the left side in the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who implies in
the concept of worship and service the value of arts and sciences in
assisting of a deeper understanding of the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh. This deeper understanding will again aid the
philosopher to improve his/her thinking and will assist in clarifying
the inquiry as the Universal House of Justice has pointed out. The
guiding principles in this process are the Independent Investigation
of Truth and the Harmony between Science and Religion.10

Nevertheless, in the same way that an individual Bahá’í goes
through a process of progress in the understanding of the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh during her/his lifetime, the Bahá’í
community in its theological thinking will go through the same
process over time. The Bahá’í principle of “independent
investigation of truth” does not stop once a believer accepts the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven        125

Faith; it is an ongoing process. Adherence to the Covenant11 will
guarantee the unity and relevance of this theological development.

In the following table these two processes are placed besides each
other with the distinction that the process of Progressive Revelation
takes place over five hundred to thousand years, while the process of
Progressive Theology is an ongoing process during these five
hundred or thousand years. Another distinction is the fact that
Progressive Theology is a substantially different process and totally
dependent on the previous Revelation and its official interpretation.

Revelation

Consequences of Philosophical Error

The Tablet of Wisdom begins with an introduction to the
addressee12 and with a succinct and brief description of today’s
world, in which Bahá’u’lláh illustrates the grievous situation of
humanity.

> We exhort mankind in these days when the countenance of
> Justice is soiled with dust, when the flames of unbelief are
> burning high and the robe of wisdom rent asunder, when
> tranquility and faithfulness have ebbed away and trials and
tribulations have waxed severe, when covenants are broken

126         Law˙-i-Hikmat

> and ties are severed, when no man knoweth how to discern
> light and darkness or do distinguish guidance from error.

(TB 137)
In the last sentence of this narrative Bahá’u’lláh seems to be
describing different philosophical views prevalent in these days.
These views of the human inability to know truth were presented in
many philosophical systems; most of them are rather widespread
today. The following theories can be counted among these views: in
ancient times pre-Socratic sophism, today modern agnosticism,
relativism and post modernism, and in some ways nominalism and
conceptionalism, all of which deny the possibility of distinguishing
truth from falsehood, good from bad, light from darkness and
guidance from error. It appears that these are the basic causes of the
above mentioned problems of today’s world such as injustice,
unbelief, global tribulations and lack of trust in society.

The conclusion from these statements points to the fact that not
all philosophy and scientific theory is equally valid and beneficial to
humankind. There are certain differences among theories,
ideologies, and philosophical assumptions that influence a whole
civilization, leading either to its betterment or to its downfall. This
fact was clearly demonstrated during the last century, where the
clash of different ideas about “who is man” resulted in two world
wars, in continuing ideological conflicts and terror, and worldwide
disunity and in the death of about 10 percent of the world
population.13

In the next section, which we will not specifically comment
upon,14 Bahá’u’lláh calls on the peoples of this world to “forsake all
evil and hold fast that which is good.” (TB 138) Following that He
makes reference of the sorrow that the present situation of the
world has provided for Him and how He was mistreated by the
rulers of His day. He closes this section with the statement that “the
people have perpetrated a grievous injustice.” (TB 140)

At this point Bahá’u’lláh responds to the question that was put to
Him about the beginning of creation.15 He describes this beginning
with several seemingly contradictory statements in order to indicate
the inscrutable truth about creation, such as a beginning without
beginning and an end without end. Both statements are presented as
truth, the statement of the creation as having existed forever and
the statement of a beginning of creation. The conclusion of this
section is the explanatory statement for the contradiction mentioned
above, which will not be followed up here further.

> And in the station of ‘I did wish to make Myself known’,
> God was, and His creation had ever existed beneath His
shelter from the beginning that hath no beginning, apart

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          127

> from its being preceded by a Firstness which cannot be
> regarded as firstness and originated by a Cause inscrutable
> even unto all men of learning. (TB 140)

The W orld of Existence, Form and Matter and
the I ntegration of Opposites

In the following paragraph, which will be the next topic to be
reflected upon in more detail, Bahá’u’lláh uses some known
philosophical terms in explaining the beginning of creation. He talks
about preexistence16 of the world of creation and how it came into
being:

> The world of existence came into being through the heat
> generated from the interaction between the active force
> and that which is its recipient. (TB 140)
This statement could be compared with the philosophical
concepts of form and primal matter as the scholastic tradition has
explained it, following the Aristotelian metaphysic. Bahá’u’lláh
seems to use the terms of what is usually called the peripatetic school
of philosophy as presented by Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. These
philosophical concepts were further developed in the Scholastic
philosophy during the medieval period.17

The first note to be added here is that Bahá’u’lláh described
beings as coming into existence not only through the information of
the primal matter, through form and matter, as the classic
philosophy will have it, but He introduces the function of heat in
this process. In other words, He states that this coming together of
the active force and its recipient is caused by energy, i.e. heat, which
brings the world of existence into being. We can see in this
formulation an indication that the world of existence, as Bahá’u’lláh
sees it, is not a static and substantive world, but a dynamic and
evolutionary one, to speak in modern terms.18 It is energy, it is heat
which brings the world into being. ‘Abdul-Bahá speaks about
attraction and love in this context, stating:

> All created things are expressions of the affinity and
> cohesion of elementary substances, and nonexistence is the
> absence of their attraction and agreement. Various
> elements unite harmoniously in composition, but when
> these elements become discordant, repelling each other,
> decomposition and nonexistence result. Everything
> partakes of this nature and is subject to this principle, for
> the creative foundation in all its degrees and kingdoms is
an expression or outcome of love. (PUP 123)

This seems to imply that it is not matter giving the form its
existence by information, but it is the attraction and cohesion
between elementary substances (active force and recipients, form
and matter) that creates concrete actuality. In the same way, lack of
this attraction, which is basically an expression of love, will cause
decomposition and nonexistence. While in this picture some
elements of the Platonic or Neoplatonic philosophies are
incorporated, the structure is essentially different. Here it is not that
forms or ideas — existence in potential — give existence to matter,
but rather both potential and form are brought into existence
through love and attraction. Teilhard de Chardin, a century later,
similarly expressed that the ever-higher unification and convergence
of reality is caused by love, or spirit, which is always part of reality.

> The most penetrating interpretation we can give of the
> world — the interpretation we find in much the same terms
> in all mystical and philosophical systems — is to regard the
> world as a movement of universal convergence, within
> which the plurality of matter is consummated in spirit. This
> view of things takes into account the fundamental and
> creative role of erotic attraction.19
Besides the introduction of heat in the process of coming into
existence, Bahá’u’lláh explains the subject further and differently.
He defines the relation between that which is the active form and its
recipients in an altogether new way, when He adds, “These two are
the same, yet they are different.” (TB 140) This can only mean that
the form and the matter are in one way the same and in another way
different. Being the same while simultaneously being different does
not necessarily constitute a contradiction; as a matter of fact, one
could say more pointedly, the more they are the same, the more they
are different. Generally, when we oppose two concepts, we assume
that an increase on one side will cause a decrease on the opposing
side. Yet there is another kind of relationship, which is called
polarity or “integral opposition,” as one could translate the German
term Integraler Gegensatz.20 In this term two rather opposing
concepts are combined, are integrated. Integration is typically not
placed together with opposition, yet in this understanding these two
opposing concepts are deliberately united, or as it could be said, they
are integrated, indicating that both the integration and the
opposition is present, i.e., when these two concepts are united, they
form a logical unity of a higher level of reality. This process is
formed similar as the Hegelian dialectic, but the process is seen
differently; there is no need for a Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis,
which are abstract concepts, an idealistic formality. Here we talk
about a concrete integration. In other words it could be said that in
these concepts reality is described as it actually is, not separated as

reality appears in the thinking process, but reality as it is in concrete
actuality.

The Bahá’í concept of Unity in Diversity is formed in the same
way: two logically contradictory terms are combined to describe a
higher level of reality. In the quote of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá above, a similar
logical process is at work, when He says “Various elements unite
harmoniously in composition, but when these elements become
discordant, repelling each other, decomposition and nonexistence
result.”

We have a unity of various and different elements, not by
forcing these elements into unity, not by eliminating these elements
in order to establish unity, but by respecting and promoting the
different elements in the new unity of a higher order.

In this dynamic structure, out of different elements a higher
unity and harmony is produced, through unification and love, yet
this structure would decompose as soon as there is the opposite of
harmony and attraction; as soon as there is discord and absence of
harmony, the structure decomposes. Extrapolating from these
statements one could postulate that this is the structure of the
universe, where in a dynamic unification new structures are
continuously created, structures in which diverse and multiple
elements are united in a new unity. This principle of dynamic
unification of multiple elements does solve the age-old question
about the whole and the part. Which is first, which is more
important, the whole or the part? Contrary to this static view, in
which for example Aristotle stated that the whole is prior to the
part, we must now state that the whole is through the part and the
part is through the whole. They both are united through this
attraction, this spiritual element that is internal to all material
structures.

We can find thoughts like this in the philosophy of Teilhard de
Chardin and more recently in Xavier Zubiri and Ken Wilber21. The
recent book of Sen McGlinn, Church and State, applies this concept
to the relationship between religion and government, following the
Bahá’í Writings. While he calls the relationship organic unity,
philosophically he describes the same relationship in the picture of
the living organism, which was used in the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá.22

In this polar relationship, both sides are increasing together, like
in a magnet, where both poles become stronger when the magnet’s
strength increases; or, the more opposition the more integration.
This is certainly known in personal matters. The more I know and
accept another person as different, as “the other”, the deeper and
stronger the unity with this person can become.

When the differences are disregarded the result is not unity but
uniformity, or disorder and anarchy at the other side of the extreme,
both demonstrating the lack of unity. The importance of
moderation and the danger of the extremes were described by
Bahá’u’lláh, who stated at many occasion in His writings this
problem of moderation and the excesses:

> If carried to excess, civilization will prove as prolific a
> source of evil as it had been of goodness when kept within
> the restraints of moderation. (GWB 342)
The same relationship applies in the Bahá’í understanding of the
concepts of “Unity in Diversity.” When people unite they become
more the same in their unity, yet at the same time their differences
will become more marked and this will contribute to the overall
value of the unity. They are the same, therefore they are in unity;
they are different, and therefore they are diverse. The more unity,
the more diversity is possible, and vice versa. This mutual
enhancement in a polar relationship is an indication of a spiritual
relationship. In a material relationship, it is simple, the more money I
give away, the less money I will have. With spiritual values it is the
opposite, the more love I give away, the richer I get in love.

It should never be forgotten that this Unity in Diversity has to be
applied in moderation. When the unity is stressed to the extreme, it
results in uniformity; when diversity is pursuit excessively, anarchy
and disorder results. The balance of this principle is moderation.
Both the unity and the diversity have to enhance each other in order
to make this principle functional.

That diversity of the world is not in opposition to its unity but
rather is promoting unity, was expressed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the
picture of the garden in which the diversity of flowers, of colors and
scents, increases the beauty and unity of the garden. Summarizing
this concept He states:

> This difference and this variation strengthen love and
> harmony and this multiplicity is the greatest aid to unity.

(BWF 295)
In fact, as history and psychology can teach us, uniformity can
only be sustained through violence and terror, while a loving and
trusting relationship, accepting diversity, will strengthen itself. This
human and political wisdom was already understood by the Chinese
Sage Mencius, (Meng-tzu: 4th century BC) when he stated:

> To pretend Force is Humanity — that’s the mark of a
> tyrant, and a tyrant needs a large country. To practice
> Humanity through Integrity — that’s the mark of a true
emperor, and a true emperor doesn’t need a large country.

> If you use force to gain the people’s submission, it isn’t
> submission of the heart. It’s only a submission of the weak
> to the strong.
> But if you use Integrity to gain the people’s submission,
> it’s a submission of the sincere and delighted heart.23
Any system of morals is built on this relationship. On the other
hand, the classic capitalist system assumed that the selfishness of the
individual will enrich the world.

Daniel Bell24 has formulated this, stating “For Adam Smith,
individual exchange, in which each man pursues his own self-
interest, is the basis of freedom, self-satisfaction, and mutual
advantage, when rationally pursued through the division of labor, it
is also the basis of accumulation and wealth.” This just does not
happen, or if it happens, it happens only for the capitalists who are
enriched, not the worker.

The same is true for the opposing moral system of communism,
as described in the Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels25 as
“an association, in which the free development of each is the
condition for the free development of all”. This assumes that the
more people are materialistically equal in the same class, and the
more other classes are suppressed, the more they will be uniform and
happiness in freedom will prevail; in other words, the less some
individuals or classes are valued, the richer the collective becomes
for the prevailing class, i.e., the proletariat. In none of the different
Communist States, no matter of their different nationality or
culture, was this actually realized. The only people who prospered
were the party members, not the proletariat or the country as a whole.

Neither of these two extreme materialistic philosophies of
freedom through opposing economic developments panned out, and
both produced the opposite result. In both forms, in rampant
capitalism and in militant communism, only the leaders are free, not
the people. It is interesting to note that capitalism could develop and
flourish as soon as it accepted social constraints and moderation. The
same did not happen with communist states, except in what is called
democratic socialism as practiced in Europe. As soon as both systems
reach some level of moderation and acknowledge a more spiritual
understanding of the human condition, they will abolish their
extreme position and be more functional26.

Bahá’u’lláh initiates a new understanding of the relationship
between form and matter, which uses the Aristotelian terms and
formulates the issues by using scholastic concepts, but transcends
this understanding in the context of this new and “most potent
Revelation”. This understanding is not a special situation, but a

general principle in this Revelation27. Bahá’u’lláh states in the Kitáb-
i-ˆqán:

> Please God, that we avoid the land of denial, and advance
> into the ocean of acceptance, so that we may perceive, with
> an eye purged from all conflicting elements, the worlds of
> unity and diversity, of variation and oneness, of limitation
> and detachment, and wing our flight unto the highest and
> innermost sanctuary of the inner meaning of the Word of
> God. (KI 160, emphasis added)
In order to understand “the world of unity and diversity”
(Sameness and Difference) as well as the world of “variation and
oneness” (parts and whole) and “limitation and detachment”
(material aspect of creation and the spiritual detachment from it),
we have to leave the land of denial, the mindset of denying the
spiritual realm, and reach “the highest and innermost sanctuary of
the inner meaning of the Word of God”, which is the Revelation of
the Manifestation.

The polarity of unity and diversity, as well as variation and
oneness, is here integrated in the “ocean of acceptance” of the
Revelation, after the eye is purged from all conflicting elements of
materialistic thinking. In this statement the philosophical tradition
that is expressed in the opposition of form and matter, of spirit and
matter, of whole and part, of the one and the many, of individual
and collective as well as the seemingly opposition of the self and the
other, of the I and the Thou is transcended and integrated.

In the Seven Valleys, Bahá’u’lláh has presented the four states of
the self as Outwardness and Inwardness, as Firstness and Lastness.

> And thus firstness and lastness, outwardness and
> inwardness are, in the sense referred to, true of thyself,
> that in these four states conferred upon thee thou shouldst
> comprehend the four divine states, and that the nightingale
> of thine heart on all the branches of the rosetree of
> existence, whether visible or concealed, should cry out: “He
> is the first and the last, the Seen and the Hidden ...” (SV 2728)
First and Last, or Firstness and Lastness, are opposites that are
dependent on each other and not only opposed, but also related, so
we can formulate the following list of opposed categories, which are
integrated in the Spiritual Reality:

> First                        Last
> Spirit                     Matter

> Unity                     Diversity
Whole                        Part

One                        Many
Individual                  Collective

> Self                       Other
> “I”                       “Thou”

This integral opposition or polarity of these concepts needs to be
clearly understood, not as opposed, as classical logic would have it,
or as being set against each other, as political partisanship
demonstrates, but rather as existing through each other. They are
increasing and decreasing not in opposition but in mutual harmony.
The categories of Self and Other, of “I” and “Thou,” are in need of
some further explanation. What is here opposed is not the I of one
person to the Thou of another, but the fact that one person is an I
for her/himself and the same person, at the same time, is a Thou for
all others. The same is true for the Self and the Other. We are
always both. The understanding of this opposite relationship follows
strictly from Bahá’u’lláh’s statement in relation to first and last,
preceding the above quoted section where He says:

> For instance, let thine Eminence consider his own self; thou
> art first in relation to thy son, last in relation to thy father.
> In thine outward appearance, thou tellest of the appearance
> of power in the realms of divine creation; in thine inward
> being thou revealest the hidden mysteries which are the
> divine trust deposited within thee. (SV 26)
This means the same person is First and Last, depending on his
relationship, the same can be applied to all the above opposites. A
person is Spirit, is First, is Whole, is an Individual, is a Unity and a
Self in relation to his/her parts or subordinates, or lower entities or
his family; at the same time he/she is Matter (potential), Last, is Part
of a Collective, is an Other to Many, is Diverse and Different to
Others in relation to all higher units and organizations, as well as to
his family of origin.

It is this writer’s opinion that this relationship of opposites is the
basis of a Bahá’í cosmology, and he has presented a paper on this
topic with the title “True of Thyself”29. This assumption needs
certainly further investigation, but will not be followed up here.

This philosophical understanding of the concrete reality of being
was presented in the last century by a number of European authors,
some of them, which I am familiar with, will be mentioned here:

•     Vladimir Solov’ev (1853-1900) formulating “Full freedom

of Parts in Perfect Unity of the Whole”
•     Leo Gabriel (Vienna 1902-1987) in his book: Integral

Logic, The Truth of the Whole 1965
•     Romano Guardini (Munich, Germany 1885-1968) in his

> book Opposition: an Attempt to a philosophy of the
> Living-Concrete
•     Teilhard de Chardin, S.J. (France and China: 1881-1955)

> who developed an “Ontology of Unification” according to
> Karl Wucherer
•     Karl Rahner, S.J. (Innsbruck, Austria 1904-1984) in his

> book: Ontology of the Relationship between the
> Individual and the Community, 1960
•     Augustinus Karl Wucherer-Huldenfeld, (Vienna Austria,

> born 1929), who stated in the quoted book the “Integral
> Opposition of Unity and Plurality,” which is a
> fundamental principle of his philosophy. 30
None of these authors were familiar with the Bahá’í Writings,31

they do not mention these writings and do not get their
understanding directly from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. And yet,
they live and philosophize in the shade of this Revelation, they are,
as stated above, under the influence of this “Most Potent
Revelation.” It needs to be noted here that the four last of these
authors are Catholic theologians, and the first two are philosophers
from Catholic or Orthodox background. Their understanding of the
relationship between the one and the many, the integral opposition
of these concepts of unity and plurality, makes it easier for us to
understand the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Here the circle of the
Progressive Theology closes in a new and better comprehension of
the Revelation.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá has elucidated this same relationship between the
part and the whole. (Note that for increased clarity these verses are
displayed here different from the authorized English translation,
where the whole section forms one paragraph.)

> Consider; we plant a seed. A complete and perfect tree
> appears from it, and from each seed of this tree another
> tree can be produced.
> Therefore the part is expressive of the whole, for this seed
> was a part of the tree, but therein potentially was the whole
> tree.
> So each one of us may become expressive or representative
of all the bounties of life to mankind.

> This is the unity of the world of humanity.
> This is the bestowal of God.
> This is the felicity of the human world and
> This is the manifestation of the divine favor. (BWF 219)
What is so remarkable in this formulation by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the
fact that the unity of the world of humanity is not something social,
legal, political, or established by a contract, as we would normally
assume. To the contrary, the unity of the world of humanity is a
personal, individual and spiritual matter; it is a gift, a bestowal of
God. It is based on the fact that each one of us must become
expressive or representative of all the bounties of life to mankind!
Only that is the unity of the world of humanity as presented in the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh!

This aspect has not been considered by the theologian and
philosophers mentioned above, it is specific to the Bahá’í
Revelation. Additionally, it brings a new meaning to the integral
philosophy and it predicts that only this understanding and this
evolution can work. The circular process of progressive theology is
here again demonstrated. The philosophical considerations of
modern philosophers and theologians help us to better understand
the meaning of the Revelation. At the same time the Revelation
brings new and unexpected aspects into these philosophies
improving them and giving occasion to further development.

It might be said that this relationship between being the same and
being different is not only a Bahá’í principle, usually formulated as
unity in diversity, but it is also, and this is true of all Bahá’í
principles, a basic structure of the world of existence, of reality and
of human awareness, or reason, which is able to recognize this basic
structure. This ontological structure, these categories of being, could
philosophically only be fully understood after the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh. And this very Revelation is at the same time improving
and completing the philosophical understanding.

Bahá’u’lláh continues in the next sentence to point out the
importance of this understanding. It is a structure which is
specifically announced by Him, when He says “Thus doth the Great
Announcement inform thee about this glorious structure (TB 140).”
Note that Bahá’u’lláh is the Great Announcement and He calls the
structure He describes here “glorious,” which indicates the
importance of this new and revolutionary Revelation.

Again one should note that this structure of reality and its
dynamism has been later somehow recognized independently by
Xavier Zubiri in his book about the Dynamic Structure of Reality,
when he stated:

> In this sense the Universe would be absolutely dynamic in
> itself . . . . Now, the various realities that compose the
> universe, as I was saying, are not precisely substances, but
> structural systems. Reality is composed not so much of
> underlying things, but of structural things: of structures.32
It needs to be emphasized that Zubiri was familiar with modern
physics and modern physicists, such as his friend Heisenberg. The
philosophical implications of this “glorious structure”, in relation to
modern physics and cosmology, are certainly another point of
interest, but will not further be pursuit here.

In the next sentence of the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh indicates as the
origin of this process the “Word of God, which is the Cause of the
entire creation.” (TB 140) In describing the Word of God,
Bahá’u’lláh again describes this Word as being “higher and far
superior to that which the senses can perceive” i.e., to all sense
perception and it is being “sanctified from any property or
substance.” (TB 140-1) This higher and sanctified reality can be called
spiritual and it is clearly distinguished from material property and
substance.

Here we must use the term spiritual not as being opposite, or on
the same level as sense perception, i.e., spiritual is not seen in
contradiction of material, it is the transcendent aspect, the inner
reality of all material existence. One is reminded at the formulation
of Teilhard de Chardin who stated:

> It (the spirit) in no way represents some entity which is
> independent of matter or antagonistic to it, some force
> locked up in, or floating in the physical world. By spirit I
> mean ‘the spirit of synthesis and sublimation’, in which is
> painfully concentrated, through endless attempts and
> setbacks, the potency of unity scattered throughout the
> universal multiple: spirit which is born within, and as a
> function of matter.33 (Italics in original)
In the Bahá’í Writings, a distinction is made between the seen
and the unseen, or the manifest and the hidden, and this distinction
applies to the whole creation, it is predicated about the world, about
man and about the Manifestations of God.34 While the definition of
Teilhard does not exactly correspond with this understanding, it
comes rather close, considering the general understanding of what is
called spirit or spiritual.

Generally the term ‘spiritual’ is used when indicating another, a
transcendent and immanent, a different reality, which cannot be
placed at the same level of reality as the material, sensible world.

Moreover, in this context spirituality is often commonly seen as
something like matter, but subtler, more “spiritual.”

Contrary to this, the world of existence is here seen as not simply
the world of the sense perception with some added spirituality.
Reality is essentially and primary spiritual, and the material is only
another aspect of this reality. This understanding is certainly new in
Western tradition, even though it was anticipated in the Neo-
platonic philosophic tradition, but it is better compatible with
modern quantum physics and other developments of science.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá has expressed this understanding of spirit in the
biblical sense, which will be further discussed in a later section of
this paper in the Chapter on Dialogical Thinking.

> Therefore, the proceeding of the human spirits from God
> is through emanation. When it is said in the Bible that God
> breathed His spirit into man, this spirit is that which, like
> the discourse, emanates from the Real Speaker, taking
> effect in the reality of man. (SAQ 206)
> At former times, when many physical events had no material
explanation they were explained “spiritually”: things like growth,
life, thunder, waves, wind etc. were all ascribed to the gods, were
placed in the spiritual realm, while the gods themselves were
represented in the form of material statues. As soon as modern
science “secularized” these concepts, the world lost its spiritual
values, it was demystified. Eventually, and definitely in the
Darwinian explanation of the development of man, the “spiritual”
was replaced by material causes such as random selection and the
survival of the fittest. That way, spiritual values were reduced to
material things. In other words, the child was thrown out with the
bathwater. The crucial issue is the error of either negating the
existence of the spiritual, or of reducing it to the material or of
treating spirituality like material things, and that is what we will later
call Spiritual Materialism.

The next section is like a commentary on the Prolog of the
Gospel according to John. Bahá’u’lláh describes the Manifestation
of the Word “without any syllable or sound ” and describes it as the
“Command of God, which pervadeth all created things.” (TB 141) He
further states:

> It has never been withheld from the world of being. It is
> God’s all-pervasive grace, from which all grace doth
> emanate. It is an entity far removed above all that hath
been and shall be. (TB 141)

The reality of the Word of God is prior and above all that has been
and shall be, and it is the Word of God, which is the cause of
creation and cause of the continuous existence of the world.

Philosophy a nd Philosophers

Here Bahá’u’lláh interrupts His explanation and mentions the
unbelievers, who would only misunderstand Him to cavil against
God. He further remarks that because of their inability to attain to
the mysteries of knowledge and wisdom, they rise in protest and
burst in clamor. The reason for this lack of understanding is the fact
that they object only “to that which they comprehend,” (TB 141) and
not to the Revelation, which they do not understand. The only thing
they understand is the material, as one could say in this context.

In other words, they do not accept the Revelation; they don’t
understand it because of their materialism. Consequently, not
understanding the truth presented by the Word of God, they only
object to what they can imagine and they eventually have to
eliminate the gods they have erected in their own imagination. It
could be said that this is a straightforward explanation of modern
atheism. This confrontation with modern atheism, of a Nietzsche,
Freud or Marx, who reject their own construction of the reality of
religion35 and the spiritual, seems to be implied in this statement. As
Bahá’u’lláh says, “Their objections, one and all, turn upon
themselves, and I swear by thy life that they are devoid of
understanding.” (TB 141)

After this paragraph, Bahá’u’lláh returns to the issue of the
beginning and states that “Every thing needs have an origin and
every building a builder” (TB 141) And He indicates that the Word of
God is the Cause which hath preceded the contingent world, as it
was stated in the Prolog of the Gospel according to John. Later He
states that Nature “in its essence is the embodiment of My Name,
the Maker, the Creator” (TB 142) and states further: “Nature is God’s
will,” (TB 142) referring to the primal Will in the Islamic tradition.
God’s Will, God’s Word is the cause of creation and Bahá’u’lláh
remarks that Nature itself is lost in bewilderment before its
Revelation.

Turning to humankind, Bahá’u’lláh now talks about the rebirth
of man (another theme from the Gospel of John) and admonishes
the reader:

> Walk thou high above the world of being through the
> power of the Most Great Name, that thou mayest become
> aware of the immemorial mysteries and be acquainted with
that wherewith no one is acquainted. (TB 142-3)

This walking in the mystery can be interpreted as the spiritual life of
the believer. Consequently, Bahá’u’lláh admonishes the reader:
“Teach thou the Cause of God.” (TB 143)

After this explanation of the spiritual life, Bahá’u’lláh returns to
the theme of nature, describing it in a materialistic and atheistic
sense and calling it “Nature as it is in itself.” (TB 144) People who
have rejected God, and therefore cling to this concept of nature, are
called “far astray and falling short of the ultimate purpose.” (TB 144)
In the following Bahá’u’lláh then explains:

> When the eyes of the people of the East were captivated
> by the arts and wonders of the West, they roved distraught
> in the wilderness of material causes, oblivious of the One
> Who is the Causer of Causes, and the Sustainer thereof.
> (TB 144)
> The arts and wonders of the West are technology and scientific
progress, all based on the understanding of material causes. The
West has by and large forgotten “the One Who is the Causer of
Causes.” In a similar way the idea of God as the Causer of Causes
was expressed by Teilhard de Chardin, the French Jesuit, who
formulated it differently, stating two generations later: “Properly
speaking, God does not make: He makes things make themselves.”36
(Italics in the original) In other words God is not a material cause in
this world; He is the Causer of these Causes. The theological
implications of this statement, and how it is an expression of the
fact that God is beyond any human understanding and has no causal
connection with the created world, is here assumed and will not be
followed up in this paper.

After this declaration, Bahá’u’lláh turns to the core message of
this Tablet, stating

> Now We have, for the sake of God, the Lord of Names, set
> Ourself the task of mentioning in this Tablet some
> accounts of the sages, that the eyes of the people may be
> opened thereby and that they may become fully assured
> that He is in truth the Maker, the Omnipotent, the
> Creator, the Originator, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

(TB 144)
The eyes of the people are directed away from “clinging to
Nature as it is in itself,” (TB 144) and are directed toward God,
towards the Word of God, who is the Manifestation of God’s
Names as the Maker, the Omnipotent, the Creator, the Originator.

Here follows a description of philosophy and of contemporary
men of learning. Bahá’u’lláh clearly makes two important statements
in this paragraph:

> Most of the modern knowledge has been acquired from
> the sages of the past, for it is they who have laid the
> foundation of philosophy, reared its structure and
> reinforced its pillars.
> . . . The sages aforetime acquired their knowledge from the
> Prophets, inasmuch as the latter were the exponents of
> divine philosophy and the Revealers of heavenly mysteries.

(TB 144-5)
In order to prove His point, He states in the next paragraph that
Empedocles was a contemporary of David while Pythagoras lived in
the days of Salomon. (TB 145) This statement has been interpreted by
historians that Bahá’u’lláh is affirming that there was a material, a
physical and literal connection between these philosopher and
Prophets. This supposition was developed by Peter Terry.37

There are two issues related to this statement. Bahá’u’lláh
distinguishes between the Manifestation and the secondary prophets
who depend on the Manifestation, such Salomon and David, when
He states about the Manifestations of God:

> Every one of them is a mirror of God, reflecting naught
> else but His Self, His Beauty, His Might and Glory, if ye
> will understand. All else besides them are to be regarded as
> mirrors capable of reflecting the glory of these
> Manifestations Who are themselves the Primary Mirrors of
> the Divine Being, if ye be not devoid of understanding.

(GWB 73)
The question is, did Bahá’u’lláh state in this sentence only a
historical fact or did He imply more than that?

The first things to note is that neither David nor Salomon are
independent Manifestations of God; their prophesies are derived
from Moses, who is seen in the Bahá’í Faith as the Manifestation of
Israel, receiving the Revelation from God. All following prophets of
the Old Testament are secondary messengers of God, and are
dependent on the original Prophesy of Moses.38 Here they are
described as contemporary of these philosophers, as living at the
same time and receiving the Revelation of Moses through David
and Solomon, i.e., the philosophers receiving the essence and
fundamentals from the prophets. As we will see later, it is the power
of the Manifestation, who directs and influences the true
philosophers, either through direct contact or through the spiritual
influence of every new Revelation.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains the difference of influence or emanation
of spirituality independent from physical contact on the example of
the Apostles: Judas was physically in the presence of Christ, but Paul

never had contact with Christ during his earthly mission, and yet
Paul was preaching the Gospel of Christ. (Rom 15:19 and 1 Cor 9:18)

> Physical nearness or remoteness is of no importance; the
> essential fact is the spiritual affinity and ideal nearness.
> Judas Iscariot was for a long time favored in the holy court
> of His Holiness Christ, yet he was entirely far and remote;
> while Paul, the apostle, was in close embrace with His
> Holiness. (TAB 719)
The following statement of Bahá’u’lláh needs to be understood
in the same way of spiritual affinity and ideal nearness of the
philosophers to the Prophets. This influence is here called emanation.

> The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have
> emanated from the Prophets. (TB 145)
Additionally, in the next sentence Bahá’u’lláh gives us the reason
why this statement creates confusion and misunderstandings. He
appears to say that the issue is clear but people differ and
misunderstand His statement:

> That the people differ concerning the inner meanings and
> mysteries thereof is to be attributed to the divergence of
> their views and minds. (TB 145)
From this quote it seems to be not totally clear what is actually
meant here; does Bahá’u’lláh speak primarily of the essence and the
fundamentals of philosophy or does He speak of the way the
philosophers have learned from the prophets? Again, a careful
reading of the next section gives us the answer.

Bahá’u’lláh reports a case where an inspired Prophet made a
spiritual statement that was then thoroughly misunderstood in a
material or literal way.

> He exclaimed: ‘Lo! All are filled with the Spirit.’ From
> among the people there was he who held fast unto this
> statement and, actuated by his own fancies, conceived the
> idea that the spirit literally penetrateth or entereth into the
> body, and through lengthily expositions he advanced proof
> to vindicate this concept; and groups of people followed in
> his footsteps. (TB 145)
So it is not the actual hearing of the message but the way it is heard,
spiritually or literally that makes the difference in understanding.

Bahá’u’lláh even adds that He could give detailed account
thereof, but feels that this would depart from the main theme. It
appears that in this context He has clearly pointed out that spiritual
statements cannot be interpreted in a material way, cannot be

understood with the means of material methods of knowing or
methods of science, even of Western historical science.

It could be concluded that the important fact is not if the
message is heard literally or not; the important fact is the spiritual
affinity or understanding of the one who hears the message, either
physically or spiritually, which makes the difference. In either case,
the fundamentals of philosophy emanate from the prophet, as
Bahá’u’lláh stated above.

One could also say that there are two different ways of thinking
as Teilhard de Chardin has pointed out:

> However, it is just at this point, in fact, that we meet an
> initial split in the thinking mass of mankind. ...
> Beneath an infinite number of secondary differentiation,
> caused by the diversity of social interests, of scientific
> investigation or religious faith, there are basically two types
> of minds, and only two: those who do not go beyond (and
> see no need to go beyond) perception of the multiple —
> however interlinked in itself the multiple may appear to be
> — and those for whom perception of this same multiple is
> necessarily completed in some unity. There are only, in fact,
> pluralists and monists: those who do not see, and those who
> do.39
Bahá’u’lláh speaks of inspired speech and literal interpretation.

He clearly points out the difference between these two ways of
thinking, a difference based on the acknowledgment of the Word
of God, of the Manifestations and of the fact of Creation and
Revelation.

The other way of thinking is described as the Western way, which
“roved distraught in the wilderness of material causes oblivious of
the One Who is the Causer of Causes.” (TB 144) Teilhard’s
formulation of thinking in the perception of the multiple versus
thinking of the same multiple as “completed in some unity” comes
close to this understanding of Bahá’u’lláh. This should not be
surprising when we consider that Teilhard sees the goal of creation
in the point Omega, which is the return of Christ, an independent
Manifestation of God in Bahá’í understanding. Therefore, one can
conclude as well that Teilhard’s philosophical understanding is based
on a Prophet, i.e. on the “Universal” or “Cosmic Christ”40.

The process of seeing the spiritual in material and literal ways is
described in the concept of spiritual materialism. Actually, the
concept of spiritual materialism goes even farther, because spiritual
materialism describes a philosophical view that attempts to conquer

and manipulate spirituality in material ways. In the following, this
term will be further explained.

Spiritual Materialism

Spiritual Materialism is a new term that was introduced by Toegel
in his dissertation about transpersonal psychology in general and
about Ken Wilber specifically, among others. He uses this term
mentioned in the title of a book by Chögyam Trungpa,41 in a very
specific sense and defines it the following way.

> Spiritual Materialism is a specific spiritual attitude, which
> approaches the transcendental aspect of reality basically as
> if it was material.42

Following this definition Toegel describes the basis of this
worldview, stating:

> The basic materialistic attitude started from the idea that
> everything, which is not specifically human, and sometimes
> even that, can be grasped which concepts of the material
> world. From this results a specific demeanor that is
> supported by the superiority of the circumstances and the
> physical world. This attitude understands humans, their
> thinking and understanding as being elevated above all
> levels of reality. The universe might be infinitely large, but
> the investigating mind is unquestionably above it. Respect
> or humility towards the unknown is totally unknown in this
> way of thinking.
> If this attitude is directed towards the transcendental area,
> then they will research it in the same way the material area
> is researched. This attitude will make one “travel” in it, will
> make a “cartographic picture” of it, will even “conquer” it
> and will try to “possess” it. Moreover, they will attempt to
> subdue this area with the same tools and methods that are
> successful in the physical world.
> In this attempt, modern science plays a very specific role.
> In the perception of humanity, the idea of science has
> already developed “religious” dimensions. If it is said today
> that something is scientifically proven, than this statement
> will satisfy thinking and feeling at least as well, as in the
> olden days the statement “Roma locuta, causa finita”43
> Therefore, what seems to be more appropriate, then using
> this fountain of truth and knowledge, this collective
> consciousness, in order to research the transcendal aspect
of reality as well?44

This modern attempt to not only understand the spiritual, but to
try to conquer and use it has been alluded to by Bahá’u’lláh in the
Tablet of Wisdom, where He stated:

> The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have
> emanated from the Prophets. That the people differ
> concerning the inner meanings and mysteries thereof is to
> be attributed to the divergence of their views and minds.

It is crucial to understand this sentence right. It is not likely that the
meaning of this sentence is that we always could follow a literary
trace from the Prophet’s writings to the statements of specific
philosophers. There might not be any historical connection between
the Prophets and the philosophers, but Bahá’u’lláh still claims that
the essence and fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from
the Prophets. By ‘emanate’ we have to understand a spiritual
causation, which in the Writing is usually explained by the
comparison with the rays of light emanating from the sun.

The assumption in this comparison is the fact that the rays come
from the sun but are not diminishing the sun. This may not be
correct physically, but this is the common-sense understanding from
which this attribution is made. The essence and fundamentals of
philosophy come from the prophets like the rays come from the sun,
and the connection is not necessarily a physical, causal or literal but a
spiritual relationship. This is explained by Bahá’u’lláh in the next
passage of this paragraph, which was mentioned before and is here
reprinted in its entirety,

> We would fain recount to thee the following: One of the
> Prophets once was communicating to his people that with
> which the Omnipotent Lord had inspired Him. Truly, thy
> Lord is the Inspirer, the Gracious, the Exalted. When the
> fountain of wisdom and eloquence gushed forth from the
> wellspring of His utterance and the wine of divine
> knowledge inebriated those who had sought His threshold,
> He exclaimed: 'Lo! All are filled with the Spirit.' From
> among the people there was he who held fast unto this
> statement and, actuated by his own fancies, conceived the
> idea that the spirit literally penetrateth or entereth into the
> body, and through lengthy expositions he advanced proofs
> to vindicate this concept; and groups of people followed in
> his footsteps. To mention their names at this point, or to
> give thee a detailed account thereof, would lead to
> prolixity, and would depart from the main theme. Verily,
> thy Lord is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. There was also
he who partook of the choice wine whose seal had been

> removed by the Key of the Tongue of Him Who is the
> Revealer of the Verses of thy Lord, the Gracious, the Most
> Generous. (TB 145-6)
This paragraph clearly describes what was described as spiritual
materialism, as Bahá’u’lláh points out that this ‘philosopher’ took
that spiritual statement literally and described the spiritual
experience of being filled with the Spirit in a physical or
materialistic relationship so that the spirit penetrated or entered into
the physical body. Bahá’u’lláh then points out that this
“philosopher” would describe this process in detailed account
thereof and would find many followers.

Referring to the idea that spiritual materialism tries to conquer
and manipulate spirituality in a materialistic way describes as well the
method of some Sufis and other Mystics, who felt that their
methods of meditation and their mystical experiences are the path to
God and are in no need of the prophets. This view was contradicted
by Bahá’u’lláh in the Seven Valleys when He said about the Sufis:

> They who soar in the heaven of singleness and reach to the
> sea of the Absolute, reckon this city — which is the station
> of life in God — as the furthermost state of mystic
> knowers, and the farthest homeland of the lovers. But to
> this evanescent One of the mystic ocean, this station is the
> first gate of the heart's citadel, that is, man's first entrance
> to the city of the heart; and the heart is endowed with four
> stages, which would be recounted should a kindred soul be
> found. (SV 40)
> Bahá’u’lláh sets His understanding apart from the traditional
Sufi idea of being able to reach God and indicates that all of this
“spiritual” effort does only bring the soul to the city of heart, which
is the Manifestation.45

It should be noted here that the surprising success of Ken
Wilber’s integral philosophy, besides its many interesting and
exciting aspects, can be explained by a similar understanding of the
mystical tradition, as Toegel has pointed out.46 Modern man, who
basically thinks in materialistic ways, is given in Wilber’s philosophy
the ability to belong to the elite and to a new and higher level of
being.

Man can improve himself and mankind through spiritual
techniques that can be scientifically studied and this possibility, as
presented by Wilber, is certainly seductive. Wilber’s extension of
modern developmental psychology into the future improvement of
the human condition through a mystical technology is expressed in
the statement:

> And every I becomes a God, and every WE becomes God’s
> sincerest worship, and every IT becomes God’s temple47.

Wilber presents a Promethean, Mystical Technology and
Pantheism for postmodern humanity. This ambitious program needs
to be pointed out; nevertheless, Wilber summarizes modern
developmental psychology in a very comprehensive way and does
clarify many basic and valuable philosophical principles, certainly
contributing to the advancement of philosophy today. This must not
be overlooked, when the shortcomings of his philosophy are
criticized and his theological arguments are refuted.

Contrary to this vain imagining of a direct mystical access to God
through philosophy and meditation, Bahá’u’lláh states:

> Verily, the philosophers have not denied the Ancient of
> Days. Most of them passed away, deploring their failure to
> fathom His mystery, even as some of them have testified.

Verily, thy Lord is the Adviser, the All-Informed. (TB 146)
Then Bahá’u’lláh describes several philosophers starting with
Hippocrates, “who believed in God” (TB 145), and Socrates, whom
He praises “as indeed wise, accomplished and righteous.” (TB 145) He
describes Socrates’ message:

> He dissuaded men from worshipping idols and taught them
> the way of God, the Lord of Mercy, until the ignorant rose
> up against him. They arrested him and put him to death in
> prison. (TB 146)
Following this description, He mentions Plato and Aristotle, stating:

> After Socrates came the divine Plato who was a pupil of
> the former and occupied the chair of philosophy as his
> successor. He acknowledged his belief in God and in His
> signs, which pervade all that hath been and shall be. Then
> came Aristotle, the well-known man of knowledge. He it is
> who discovered the power of gaseous matter. These men
> who stand out as leaders of the people and are pre-eminent
> among them, one and all acknowledged their belief in the
> immortal Being Who holdeth in His grasp the reins of all
> sciences. (TB 146)
After that, Bahá’u’lláh describes the philosopher Balinus, who
praises God as the Creator and who follows the “hermeneutic
writings” originated by “the first person who devoted himself to
philosophy.48 (TB 148) This appears to be a reference to the origin of
philosophy, indicating that the first philosophers established their
knowledge on the acknowledgement of God, the Creator. Next,
Bahá’u’lláh describes the process of inspiration that allows Him to

read books that appear to Him “in the form of a Tablet.” (TB 149)
This interesting fact will not be followed up here.

Bahá’u’lláh mentions another remarkable fact. He states that the
Lord, the “All-Wise,” does distribute the knowledge to different
lands, saying “Thus do We bestow and withdraw, Verily the Lord is
He who giveth and divesteth, the Mighty, the Powerful.” (TB 150)
He presents as an example the history of Greek philosophy:

> Consider Greece. We made it a Seat of Wisdom for a
> prolonged period. However, when the appointed hour
> struck, its throne was subverted, its tongue ceased to speak,
> its light grew dim and its banner was hauled down. Thus do
> We bestow and withdraw. Verily thy Lord is He Who
> giveth and divesteth, the Mighty, the Powerful. (TB 150)
It is not only true that “the essence and the fundamentals of
philosophy have emanated from the prophets,” (TB 145) as
Bahá’u’lláh has stated above, it is also true that the place and the
time frame in which philosophy is preeminent in a country is
determined by the Prophets, by God. Obviously, this is not a
scientifically provable fact, this is not something that historians can
research and find evidence for in a scientific investigation. It is
rather a fact of Revelation, of Faith and of acknowledging the
station of the Manifestation and the fact that God’s wisdom and
providence is guiding this world. Without this religious truth and
believe, the statement simply makes no sense.

This fact can be described in the following example. If we find in
nature something, let’s say an unusual rock formation or
interestingly looking piece of wood, of which we do not know if it
is a product of human creation or if it is something that comes out
of “nature as it is,” we would not be able to distinguish the
difference easily. Even a detailed analysis will not always make it
clear what it is, unless we find signs and marks of human activity on
this piece of nature. If the assumed human producers of this piece
of evidence were sophisticated in hiding their handiwork, we might
never be able to prove scientifically how this product was made or
how it did develop. On the other hand, if we are told by a
trustworthy witness that it is a human creation, we most likely could
interpret the marks and find it possible, if not most likely that this is
a human creation.

In other words, the scientific inquiry would follow the testimony
and therefore only reinforce the known facts, but not prove them.
In the same fashion, scientific and historical investigation can follow
the truth of a Revelation, reinforce scientifically and historically its
truth, without being able to prove it independently. This is, as a
matter of fact, the scope and object of the present investigation.

Considering that God, the Knower, the Maker and the Creator
has created this world, and that His marks are the most hidden of
the hidden, they only become the most manifest of the manifest if
we trust the witness to the fact of creation. We are, in so many
words, reaching the limits of any scientific or human investigation.
No spiritual materialism will prove anything here. It is the
acceptance of the truth of the Prophet which will answer this
question. Even philosophy cannot penetrate this veil, unless man
assumes hypocritically that his reason and intellect is the final and
only way to find the truth.

Dialogical Thinking

In this perspective, the new dialogic thinking can provide the
philosophical bridge to understand the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.
Bernhard Casper describes in his book “The Dialogical Thinking”49
the following three thinkers: Franz Rosenzweig, Ferdinand Ebner,
and Martin Buber. Unfortunately, only some works of Buber have
been translated into English50. It has to be noted that Rosenzweig
and Buber are from a Jewish background, Ebner was Catholic.

Thinking in the dialogical sense is in opposition to the Cartesian
“I think,” (cogito) which was the historical basis of modern thinking
and modern science, and which can be called substantial thinking. 51
According to Ebner this kind of thinking is caused by the “Solitude
of the I” (Ich-Einsamkeit, a concept coined by Ferdinand Ebner,
following Kierkegaard) as well as by the Western individualism or
thinking from Descartes’ individually based “cogito, I think.” This
substantial thinking, which is expressed in the third person, he, she
or it, and relates to things, describes things and is therefore the
legitimate way of thinking of modern science and physical causality.
Yet it is inappropriate when used in terms of personal thinking. As a
matter of fact, in every day language we find it impolite and rather
offending when somebody speaks about a present person in the third
person i.e., speaks about him or her when they are present. In proper
speech we use either the name or the personal pronoun “you” and
always speak to the person and not about him or her, as if they were
not present.

Ferdinand Ebner builds his philosophical system on four basic
thoughts, which will be presented here52:
1\. Human existence basically has spiritual meaning, i.e., man is

> spiritual because he is fundamentally designed towards
> something spiritual outside of him, through which and in
> which he actually exists. The I is constituted by the relation to
the Thou.

2\. How does this become apparent? The expression of the

> spiritual existence of man is the fact that man is a speaking
> being. This is objectively demonstrable.
3\. Therefore, the thought must be contemplated that this “I —

> Thou” relationship is given (a) through the Word, (b) in the
> Word, and (c) as Word.
4\. That means, this relationship exists in the actuality of the

> spoken word, in the situation of being spoken to, which is in
> Talk, in Dialogue.

When I speak to you, I constitute myself as a spiritual being that
is able to communicate with you, (or Thou; this singular term is
preferred as it is not a polite plural which ‘you’ is in the English
language). And both understand themselves and each other, as
spiritual beings; this relationship is therefore the origin of human
spirituality. Then again, the “I” neither creates the “Thou” nor the
“Thou” the “I”. This spirituality is only possible because the eternal
Thou, the Creator, has given the Word to man. Therefore, when we
speak to the eternal Thou, that is when we pray to God, we speak
from the human spirituality in the spirituality of Faith, as ’Abdu’l-
Bahá explains:

> The human spirit which distinguishes man from the animal
> is the rational soul, and these two names — the human spirit
> and the rational soul — designate one thing. This spirit,
> which in the terminology of the philosophers is the rational
> soul, embraces all beings, and as far as human ability
> permits discovers the realities of things and becomes
> cognizant of their peculiarities and effects, and of the
> qualities and properties of beings. But the human spirit,
> unless assisted by the spirit of faith, does not become
> acquainted with the divine secrets and the heavenly
> realities. It is like a mirror which, although clear, polished
> and brilliant, is still in need of light. Until a ray of the sun
> reflects upon it, it cannot discover the heavenly secrets.

(SAQ 208-9)
From this “I — Thou” relationship and its origin in the relationship
with the human I to the Creator, Ebner finds his way to the Word
of God that was in the beginning with God, as stated in the Prolog
of John’s Gospel.

Several conclusions must be drawn from this thought, which is the
basis of every understanding of man as a spiritual being. Ebner gives
it a most important place in understanding of man, when he writes:

> It became clear to me what it means that man is the only
speaking creature that he is in the middle of a mute world

> the only one, who ‘has the word.’ It became clear to me
> that man is through the word, what he is, a human being.
> That in the word is the key to his spiritual life.
> This basic thought is essentially a ‘revolutionary’ thought,
> it is the most revolutionary thought, humankind will ever
> think. But this thought is not from me, and from whom it
> is, it is not only a thought, but a life: ‘The Life’.

In the last word, Ebner refers to the Prolog of the Gospel of John,
(1-5) where it is said:

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
> God, and the Word was God. The same was in the
> beginning with God. All things were made by him; and
> without him was not any thing made that was made. In him
> was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light
> shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
It needs to be noted here that Ebner’s concept of the word as key
of spiritual life has been expressed by Bahá’u’lláh a century before,
when He said:

> The Word is the master key for the whole world, inasmuch
> as through its potency the doors of the hearts of men,
> which in reality are the doors of heaven, are unlocked. No
> sooner had but a glimmer of its effulgent splendour shone
> forth upon the mirror of love than the blessed word 'I am
> the Best-Beloved' was reflected therein. It is an ocean
> inexhaustible in riches, comprehending all things. Every
> thing which can be perceived is but an emanation
> therefrom. (TB 173, emphasis added)
Ebner developed this relationship of man, who has the word,
with the Word that was in the beginning and was the light of men in
many of his fragments. Human spirituality is based on this fact and
founded in the Word of God.

Bahá’u’lláh clearly states that all knowledge of God is the
knowledge of Him, the Manifestation of God, and that we have to
look at Him in His Words and in His Writings, not with any other
eyes or understanding, i.e., it is a personal knowledge gained in
accepting the person of the Manifestation in word and deed.

> If it be your wish, O people, to know God and to discover
> the greatness of His might, look, then, upon Me with Mine
> own eyes, and not with the eyes of any one besides Me.
(GWB 272)

The human spirit is, therefore, based on the “I — Thou” relationship,
which is the starting point of any philosophizing. It needs to be
noted that in this relationship, both the human I and the Thou are
equal, there is no prevalence of the active over the passive, of the
form over matter, of male over female, as in the perennial Philo-
sophy; the “I” can only be in dialogue if there is a “Thou”, and vice versa.

Following Ebner’s thoughts this writer would like to add these
considerations. From this relationship one must understand the
equality of man and women, which is the life giving “I” — “Thou”
relationship, on which the physical unity of mankind is based. In all
previous philosophical and biological understanding man was the
active and woman was only the receiver, and these two were never
equal. Aristotle has stated that clearly and it is still an understanding
lurking in the psychological underground of our culture. Aristotle's
main thrust was to explain the nature of things as they are seen to
be. From the subject and low status of women he deduced their
inferiority by nature. Caroline Whitbeck53 stated:

> The reason for women's inferiority lies in a defect.
> “ Women are defective by nature” because they cannot
> reproduce semen which contains a full human being. When
> a man and a woman have intercourse, the man supplies the
> substance of a human being (the soul, i.e. the form), the
> woman only the nourishment (the matter).
It must be remembered that Bahá’u’lláh clearly states the equality
of both, of form and matter or of the active and the passive
principle of being, whom He calls different and the same, when He
said:

> That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not
> in the form thou seest today. The world of existence came
> into being through the heat generated from the interaction
> between the active force and that which is its recipient.

These two are the same, yet they are different. (TB 140)
It is interesting to note that the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh
integrates many concepts and ideas of previous philosophies, but
does this in a totally new way, creating a perspective that could not
be seen before. This new perspective has found, at least in this
writer’s opinion, already some reflections in the philosophers who
have lived since, even though they might never have heard the name
of Bahá’u’lláh. This obviously is only the beginning of a process that
will last a thousand years at least, as was predicted by Bahá’u’lláh.

The new dialogical thinking concludes in the fact that neither the
human I nor the human Thou is able to fundamentally establish this
relationship, which constitutes human spirituality, so it must have

been established originally by an eternal Thou, by the Divine Word,
by the Creation of God. Consequently, Ferdinand Ebner54 refers to
the Prologue of the Gospel of John, to bring his philosophical
thinking about the Word, and about man, as being given the word,
to its apex.55

The following example should illuminate this relationship and the
astounding parallels between the Bahá’í Revelation and another
dialogical thinker, Rosenzweig.

Compare this sentence from the Selections from the Writings of
the Báb (1819-1850):

> I have known Thee by Thy making known unto me that
> Thou art unknowable to anyone save Thyself. (SWB 196)
with this statement of Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929):

> Of God we know nothing.
> Yet, This Not-Knowing is Not-Knowing of God,
> As such, this is the beginning of our Knowing of Him.56

Referring to the word “the Fashioner” in the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh
continues to explain that “a true philosopher would never deny God
nor His evidences, rather would He acknowledge His glory and
overpowering majesty which overshadow all created things.”

He continues to explain that the true philosopher is not thinking
independently and as an individual as stated in the “I think,
therefore I am” proposition of Descartes, but that such a
philosopher is aided and loved by the Prophet, indicating that He,
Bahá’u’lláh, in His Revelation provides the essence and fundament
of any true philosophy of today.

> Verily We love those men of knowledge who have brought
> to light such things as promote the best interests of humanity,
> and We aided them through the potency of Our behest, for
> well are We able to achieve Our purpose. (TB 150)
What was stated above about the relationship between
philosophy and Revelation is here repeated and applied to what
Bahá’u’lláh calls the “true philosopher”. According to Bahá’u’lláh, a
“true philosopher would never deny God” and “promote the best
interest of humanity.” Additionally, we can recognize true
philosophers if we can detect in their philosophy the fact that they
were loved and aided by Bahá’u’lláh. This love and aid can be
recognized by the Bahá’í scholars insofar as the findings of such a
true philosopher, either in part or in total, demonstrate analogies and
similarities to the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

It is the opinion of this writer, that the philosophers quoted in
this paper are falling into these categories of “true philosophers”
according to Bahá’u’lláh. This seems true for a number of modern
philosophers such as Teilhard de Chardin Ferdinand Ebner, Martin
Buber and certainly others as well.57

This statement again points to the spiritual connection of
philosophy with the Revelation of the Prophet and is based on the
potency of the Revelation and not necessarily on any literal con-
nection or reference. So the statement mentioned above about the
essence and fundamentals of philosophy is here based on the potency
of the Revelation and the Purpose of the Manifestation of God.

In His final section of the Tablet Bahá’u’lláh again addresses
Nabil, stating that this Tablet is an irrefutable and weighty
exposition:

> My Nabil! Let nothing grieve thee, rather rejoice with
> exceeding gladness inasmuch as I have mentioned thy
> name, have turned My heart and My face towards thee and
> have conversed with thee through this irrefutable and
> weighty exposition. Ponder in thy heart upon the tribu-
> lations I have sustained, the imprisonment and the captivity
> I have endured, the sufferings that have befallen Me and
> the accusations that the people have levelled against Me.

Behold, they are truly wrapped in a grievous veil. (TB 151)
Concluding this Tablet Bahá’u’lláh reveals a prayer summarizing all
the blessings of the Revelation and He let the faithful say:

> Make me as a lamp shining throughout Thy lands that
> those in whose hearts the light of Thy knowledge gloweth
> and the yearning for Thy love lingereth may be guided by
> its radiance. (TB 151)
Conclusions

Some very tentative and preliminary conclusions are drawn from
this paper and only sketched out here for further consideration,
following the chapters of this paper.
1) Progressive Theology
a) The value of this concept for a Bahá’í theology needs to be

> further investigated and developed, especially in comparison
> with other scriptural texts,
2) Consequences of Philosophical Error
a) This consideration is based on a verse of this tablet and needs
to be followed up throughout the Bahá’í Scripture. Any

> philosophical school of thought that denies a hierarchical
> value system and that denies the difference between good
> and bad, seems to undermine civilization and therefore
> would be unacceptable for the consideration in the Bahá’í
> understanding of philosophy.
3) Form and Matter
a) The way how oppositional concepts are seen in the concrete

> world is of importance as the consequences of different
> philosophical solutions have demonstrable consequences for
> civilization. The logic of this new understanding needs to be
> developed and added to the traditional logical systems. The
> concept of Unity in Diversity can function as the watchword
> of this new conceptualization of reality.
4) Philosophy and Philosophers

> a) Bahá’u’lláh has stated clearly the criteria of a true philosopher.
b) Two philosophical criteria

> i)   True philosophers will never deny God the Creator
ii) True philosophers will promote the best interest of

Humanity
c) Two theological criteria

> i)   True philosophers are loved by the Manifestation of God
ii) True philosophers are aided through the potency of the

Manifestation
d) In any evaluation of a philosopher or of any philosophical

> system these criteria can be applied and will give a sure footing
> for their evaluation. This applies to a whole system or an
> independent part of a philosophical system. It applies to all
> philosophers disregarding their specific religious affiliation.
5) Spiritual Materialism
a) This concept seems to be the touchstone of the evaluation of

modern thinkers.
b) Any thinking that does make the human reason the “measure

> of all things” and does not accept anything that is above, or
> beyond, transcendent or hidden, will have missed the true
> human condition and therefore will have detrimental
> consequences, even if it is presented with a high level of
“spirituality”.

c) The understanding of spirituality needs to be further

> researched in the writings of the Bahá’í Faith, the system of
> dialogical thinking may be of assistance in this effort.
6) Dialogical Thinking
a) This new understanding of human spirituality in the Word

> of God can be used to understand the seeming contradiction
> in the Bahá’í Revelation, where it is said that man is created
> to know God but yet God is defined as unknowable. The
> difference between substantial or third person understanding
> and personal or first and second person communication
> needs to be developed and might be useful in better
> understanding the solution to the above-mentioned apparent
> contradiction. The fact that all knowledge of God is
> manifest in God’s Prophets, i.e. in a personal way and not in
> abstract and substantial thought processes seems to indicate
> the correctness of this distinction.
7) Final Thoughts
a) The most important conclusion of this paper is the

> obligation to look at modern philosophy and distinguish
> between the findings and statements of modern
> philosophers. There are philosophies that are words
> leading to words and thereby satisfying only the
> intellectual mind in a Spiritual Materialism dealing only
> with “that which they comprehend”.
b) On the other hand, there are modern philosophers and

> theologians, philosophical ideas and visions of contemp-
> orary thinking, which are based on the essence and the
> fundamentals that have been revealed by and emanate
> from the Prophets of the past and by the Prophets of
> today, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. And there are certainly
> some philosophers who are in the middle, having only
> partially recognized this spirit of the Prophet.
c) In every case it is the task of the student of Bahá’í

> theology to use discrimination and apply it according to
> the Pauline statement: “Prove all things; hold fast that
> which is good.”58
d) The same truth has been expressed in the Tablet of

Wisdom:
e) Forsake all evil and hold fast that which is good. (TB

138)
f) Establish the Word of Truth with eloquence and
Wisdom (TB 139)

g) . . . When no man knoweth how to discern light and

darkness or to distinguish guidance from error. (TB 138)

These are the “cold” statistics of the victims of communism as

described in this book on page 4:

U.S.S.R          20 million deaths   Eastern         1 million deaths

Taherzadeh on this topic, ibid. pp.39-46.

\[16\] This preexistence of the world (as stated above: “His creation has ever

\[17\] This term is used by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to indicate the philosophical
> tradition originated by Aristotle and Plato: "As for the second
> balance, which the Illuminati and the peripatetics (followers of
> Aristotle) rely upon, it is the balance of reason (al-mízánu'l-`aql ). In
> like manner, the other schools of the first philosophers in the
> ancient and middle centuries depended upon it. They said that that
> which is judged by reason is firmly established, clear and
> indubitable, and that there is no doubt or defect either in its
> foundations or its outcomes." (Quoted from a paper by Peter Terry,
> Bahá’í Epistemology: 'Abdu'l-Bahá, Tablet on the Inmost Heart,
> provisional translation by Steven Phelps and William McCants,
> March 2000; Persian text in Min Makatib 'Abdu'l-Bahá, pp. 83-86)

\[18\] It is noteworthy that this understanding of heat or energy as being

> and lit up with a blue nuclear flow.”

\[38\] Following Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, (SAQ 164) distinguishes as well

> between independent prophets and dependent prophets, whom He
> calls followers and promoters: “For the independent Prophets are
> founders; They establish a new religion and make new creatures of
> men; They change the general morals, promote new customs and rules,
> renew the cycle and the Law. Their appearance is like the season of
> spring, which arrays all earthly beings in a new garment, and gives
> them a new life.
With regard to the second sort of Prophets who are followers, these also

> promote the Law of God, make known the Religion of God, and
> proclaim His word. Of themselves they have no power and might,
> except what they receive from the independent Prophets.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, (‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London, p. 42) stated that even Greek

> philosophy is dependent on the Prophets: “God sends Prophets for
> the education of the people and the progress of mankind. Each such
> Manifestation of God has raised humanity. They serve the whole world
> by the bounty of God. The sure proof that they are the Manifestations
> of God is in the education and progress of the people. The Jews were
> in the lowest condition of ignorance, and captives under Pharaoh
> when Moses appeared and raised them to a high state of civilization.
> Thus was the reign of Solomon brought about and science and art
> were made known to mankind. Even Greek philosophers became
> students of Solomon's teaching. Thus was Moses proved to be a
> Prophet.” This passage clearly indicates that the teaching of
> Solomon, which has even reached the Greek philosophers, did prove
> the prophethood of Moses, who was the independent Prophet for
> Israel.
