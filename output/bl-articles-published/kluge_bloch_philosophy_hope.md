                      Bloch’s Philosophy of Hope and the Bahá'í Writings

Ian Kluge

Introduction

At first glance, any comparison between Ernst Bloch’s “philosophy of hope” and the
Bahá'í Writings looks like an unpromising venture. What could the ideas of a Marxist
philosopher, even an exiled renegade like Bloch, have in common with a religious world-view
based on divine revelation or the authorized interpretations thereof? However, despite
superficial appearances, the Bahá'í Writings and Bloch share one key underlying similarity –
adherence to an evolutionary world-view. Both agree that reality is a teleological process in
which all things strive to actualize their inherent potentials and thereby to complete themselves
in their highest possible condition. The drive to completion, or entelechy1, is found in varying
degrees in inanimate objects, living things and above all, in human beings both as individuals
and communities. This universal striving for the “Not Yet,”2 for the better future, forms the
basis for a new metaphysics and a new understanding of human nature and history as well as
humankind’s religious evolution. Because the key concepts and language of this process world-
view – for example ‘actuality,’ ‘actualize,’ ‘potentials’, ‘teleology’ and ‘entelechy’ – were first
systematically developed by Aristotle,3 this outlook might well be described as ‘Aristotelian.’ 4

Writings,” Lights of Irfan, Volume 4. (Evanston, IL: `Irfán Colloquium, 2003). Vincent Geoghegan
writes, Bloch “is clearly excited by what he terms ‘left-wing Aristotelianism’ . . . particularly of
Aristotle’s notion of the realization or ‘entelechy’ of matter.)” Vincent Geoghegan, Ernst Bloch,
(London: Routledge, 1996) 29. Bloch traced this aspect of Aristotle’s philosophy down to Hegel.

Before we proceed, however, it should be made clear that the Bahá'í Writings are divine
revelation and not simply another philosophy. In the words of Shoghi Effendi,

> For the Cause is not a system of philosophy; it is essentially a way of life, a religious
> faith that seeks to unite all people on a common basis of mutual understanding and love,
> and in a common devotion to God.5

However, while the Bahá'í Faith is not a philosophy in itself, it does, nonetheless, encompass
philosophy within its framework, as made clear by Shoghi Effendi’s references to “the Bahá'í
philosophy of progressive revelation,”6 and “the Bahá'í philosophy of social and political
organization.”7 Furthermore, it should also be noted that Shoghi Effendi points out that the
Writings have philosophical aspects, when, for example, he states,

> Nor should a review of the outstanding features of Bahá'u'lláh's writings during the latter
> part of His banishment to Akká fail to include a reference to the Lawh-i-Hikmat (Tablet
> of Wisdom), in which He sets forth the fundamentals of true philosophy.8

Here, Shoghi Effendi clearly states that the Writings encompass a “true philosophy” the
“fundamentals” of which are given by Bahá'u'lláh. Unfortunately, we cannot pursue the
possible implications of this statement.9

Emphasis added.

Shoghi Effendi not only recognizes that the Writings encompass a philosophy but also
encouraged Bahá'ís to undertake studies correlating the Writings to developments in
philosophy:

> It is hoped that all the Bahá'í students will ... be led to investigate and analyse the
> principles of the Faith and to correlate them with the modern aspects of philosophy and
> science. Every intelligent and thoughtful young Bahá'í should always approach the
> Cause in this way, for therein lies the very essence of the principle of independent
> investigation of truth.10

Such ‘correlation work’ is obviously important because it makes the Bahá'í teachings part of the
discussions of contemporary issues and this, in itself, is valuable to the discussions themselves
as well as being useful in teaching and dialogue with other philosophies and belief systems. In
particular, elucidating the correlations with Bloch’s Principle of Hope opens the door to
dialogue with such highly influential Christian theologians as Jurgen Moltmann, author of
Theology of Hope. This work, a conscious application of Bloch’s philosophy to Christian
teachings inspired the ‘theology of hope’ movement among contemporary Christians.

Finally, this introduction should make it clear that although this paper will focus on the
foundational similarities between the Bahá'í Writings and Bloch, there are differences that
generate irresolvable tension between them. While there is considerable agreement in regards
to ontology, the philosophy of human nature and even God, there are obvious differences with
Bloch’s misguided application of his philosophy to support the dictatorship of the Communist
Party in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Such support contradicts Bahá'u'lláh’s frequent
condemnations of oppression as a hindrance to human unity and progress:

\[9\] For example, could two different, even contradictory philosophies be developed from the same
foundational truths provided by Bahá'u'lláh and thereby illustrate “unity in diversity”? Or do the
Writings provide the “fundamentals” for one over-arching philosophy for the unified world?

(Compilation). (Ocean) 17. Emphasis added.

So long, however, as the thick clouds of oppression, which obscure the day star of
> justice, remain undispelled, it would be difficult for the glory of this station [of unity] to
> be unveiled to men's eyes....11

`Abdu'l-Bahá also rebukes oppressive regimes such as those Bloch supported by saying,

> When freedom of conscience, liberty of thought and right of speech prevail, that is to
> say, when every man according to his own idealization may give expression to his
> beliefs, development and growth are inevitable.12

Another problem is Bloch’s support for partisan politics, something which Bahá'ís are required
to avoid because of its disunifying effects on society. Instead, Bahá'ís are encouraged to focus
on the positive growth-facilitating potentials in social developments.13 Nor do the Bahá'í
Writings agree with Bloch’s support for radical and subversive movements:

> Let there be no misgivings as to the animating purpose of the world-wide Law of
> Bahá'u'lláh. Far from aiming at the subversion of the existing foundations of society, it
> seeks to broaden its basis, to remold its institutions in a manner consonant with the
> needs of an ever-changing world. It can conflict with no legitimate allegiances, nor can
> it undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and
> intelligent patriotism in men's hearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy. 14

In other words, Bahá'ís are not political revolutionaries dedicated to overthrowing governments.

Rather, Bahá'ís are ‘evolutionaries’ who believe in fostering progress by developing, i.e.
actualizing, the positive growth potentials in individuals and society.

The conclusion to draw from these differences is that Bloch’s own application of his
foundational ideas to the particular political situations of his time is problematical and
contradictory to the Bahá'í Writings. However, this difference with Bloch’s political
application need not prevent us from recognizing a number of foundational similarities with the
Writings and from applying these in a manner consistent with Bahá'u'lláh’s revelation. While
Bahá'í Writings converge with Bloch’s ontology, and much of his philosophy of man and God,
they diverge considerably regarding the practical application of these ideas.

Ontology: All Things in Teleological Process

Ontology concerns our theory of reality, i.e. our beliefs about the nature of being and the
structure of reality.15 The subjects covered by ontology concern the most basic aspects of
reality, such as what is or is not ‘real’, stasis and change, the origin of reality and the basic
‘stuff’ of the universe. Because ontology answers these foundational questions about the nature
of reality, it directly and indirectly shapes our views on virtually all other philosophical subjects
such as epistemology, ethics, philosophy of science as well as existential issues of individuality,
meaning and value. Given the importance of ontology, we shall begin our comparisons
between the Bahá'í Faith and Bloch’s philosophy with a glance at their commonalities.

Bloch and the philosophy embedded in the Bahá'í Writings are process philosophies in
which the universe and all its phenomena are not only inherently dynamic but are also in
orderly change to actualize their intrinsic potentials as completely as possible. However,

\[15\] Ted Honderich, ed. The Oxford Companion to Philosophy. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995)

\[634\] 
5
because nothing is ever complete, but always possesses other potentials to actualize, Bloch calls
his view “[t]he ontology of Not-yet-being.”16

According to the Bahá'í Writings, “phenomenal existence” 17 i.e. the material world18 is
characterized by ceaseless change. `Abdu'l-Bahá states,

> Know that nothing which exists remains in a state of repose--that is to say, all things are
> in motion . . . this state of motion is said to be essential--that is, natural; it cannot be
> separated from beings because it is their essential requirement, 19

In this categorical assertion, `Abdu'l-Bahá emphasizes that movement and change are necessary
to phenomenal existence, a theme `Abdu'l-Bahá emphasizes by saying, “Divine and all
encompassing Wisdom hath ordained that motion be an inseparable concomitant of existence . .
.” 20 ‘Motion’ in these statements refers not only to a change in space but also to a change in
time, in condition, in relationship, in appearance, constitution or structure, intensity, color, size
shape – indeed, any kind of accidental or essential difference between two moments in the
existence of an entity. Change does not just refer to the material but to the spiritual as well.
Even our souls are subject to change, as evident in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that the soul is “in
motion and ever active”21 something also apparent in the concept of the soul’s continued
evolution after death.

The process philosophy inherent in the Bahá'í Writings is not mere random,
directionless change; it also makes clear that phenomenal change has a direction and a goal, i.e.
is teleological or possesses a final cause. This, too, agrees with Aristotle.22 `Abdu’l-Bahá writes,

> for the existence of everything depends upon four causes-- the efficient cause, the
> matter, the form and the final cause. For example, this chair has a maker who is a
> carpenter, a substance which is wood, a form which is that of a chair, and a purpose
> which is that it is to be used as a seat.23

According to `Abdu’l-Bahá, each of the four causes contributes to the formation of a thing; for
a chair to exist, there must be wood (or metal, plastic); there must be someone who shapes the
pieces for their various functions; there must be a plan/form according to which the pieces are
shaped and put together, and finally, the plan/form must come into being to fulfill a certain
goal, i.e. the final cause. The process of making the chair possesses its own entelechy or drive
to completion which attains actuality in the chair itself.

Because the Bahá’í Writings are not just philosophy but revealed scripture, they also
express this belief in goal-orientation, in teleology in religious language. `Abdu’l-Bahá writes,
“From this same God all creation sprang into existence, and He is the one goal, towards which
everything in nature yearns.”24 This concept is also found in the following prayer by
Bahá'u'lláh:

> Lauded be Thy name, O my God and the God of all things, my Glory and the Glory of
> all things, my Desire and the Desire of all things, my Strength and the Strength of all

things, my King and the King of all things, my Possessor and the Possessor of all things,
my Aim and the Aim of all things, my Mover and the Mover of all things!25

Here we have a reference to the goal or “Aim” oriented nature of all beings, as well as the
universal desire for God as the ultimate destination of the striving of “all things.” We also
observe that God is the “Mover of all things.” This means not only that God provides the
energy by which all things move or develop but also that God is the Great Attractor or the
“Prime Mover”26 towards which all things move in their desire for actualization and
completion.

In the Bahá’í Writings, the ultimate goal is to evolve into a higher and God-like
condition though, of course, no phenomenal being can ever attain God’s ontological state.27
However, the mediate goal by which we strive towards this final end is the actualization of
latent potentials. Theologically, these potentials are often described as the “sign” or “names” of
God made visible in all created things. Bahá'u'lláh states,

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is a direct evidence of the
> revelation within it of the attributes and names of God, inasmuch as within every atom
> are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent testimony to the revelation of that Most Great
> Light . . . To a supreme degree is this true of man, who, among all created things, hath
> been invested with the robe of such gifts, and hath been singled out for the glory of such
> distinction. For in him are potentially revealed all the attributes and names of God.28

These “attributes and names of God” are “potentially revealed” most abundantly in humankind
but also in all phenomenal beings which must actualize these potentials for them to be disclosed
in the phenomenal world. However, for human beings, having these attributes “latent within
[man]”29 is not enough; humans must work or labor to actualize them since “[t]he radiance of
these energies may be obscured by worldly desires even as the light of the sun can be concealed
beneath the dust and dross which cover the mirror.”30 This, of course, suggests the importance
of the work and labor by which humans ‘make themselves’ in realizing their potentials
individually and socially and, thereby, developing throughout history. In that way Bahá’í
ontology provides the foundation for the teaching that work performed in the spirit of service is
worship and, by extension, the inherent dignity of labor.31

The Writings also refer to the existence of potentials directly when they note the virtues
“potential in the seed,”32 of the sun awakening “all that is potential in the earth,”33 of the
“virtues potential in mankind,”34 of the inventions “potential in the world of nature”35 and of the
embryo progressing until “that which was potential in it--namely, the human image—
appears.”36 Of similar import are the passages referring to the “mysteries latent in nature”37
which are actualized by humankind, the “latent talents”38 hidden in human beings, the “divine
perfections latent in the heart of man,”39 the “latent realities within the bosom of the earth,”40
and the “the greater world, the macrocosm . . . latent and miniature in the lesser world, or

microcosm, of man.”41 The same idea is implicit in Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that we are to
“[r]egard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value,”42 which is to say that humankind
possesses invaluable potentials that must be actualized through education. `Abdu’l-Bahá
provides a philosophical argument for the reality of these potentials when he says, “no sign can
come from a nonexisting thing.”43 Because potentials give real results, they must be real. If
they were not, there could be no changes since these changes cannot come from nothing.

Since the concept of teleological change and actualizing potentials is often
misunderstood it is worthwhile to engage in a brief digression to correct several common
misapprehensions and to explain it in a manner amenable to modern readers. First, the final or
formal causes need not be a conscious intentions or plans as is often assumed by critics;
Aristotle who invented the concept of four-fold causality explicitly rejects this idea.44
Therefore, final causality can also apply to unconscious natural processes. Second, as several
contemporary philosophers have pointed out, the final cause may be viewed as referring to the
laws of nature which limit physical processes i.e. the action of efficient causes, to a limited
number of results. For example, we cannot sow iron filings and harvest sunflowers. Whatever
changes iron filings may undergo, the laws of nature do not allow a change into sunflowers; at
each moment, natural laws restrict changes to a certain number of outcomes though they do not
guide towards these outcomes consciously.45 This step-by-step guidance leads to the identical
goal in identical processes. In other words, as Aristotle points out, the efficient, formal and
final causes act together.46 Thus, a process does not simply proceed randomly to any possible

outcome; it is subject to limits imposed by physical laws, and these physical laws ensure that
each aspect of the efficient cause (process) attains only certain ends until a final stage is
reached. In the words of philosopher W. Norris Clarke,

> [i]f the efficient cause at the moment of its productive action is not interiorly
> [inherently] determined or focused towards producing this effect rather than that,
> then there is no sufficient reason why it should produce this one rather than that.47

Efficient causes always lead to particular effects, and if nothing constrains an efficient cause
from acting one way or another, any effect at all could follow randomly from any action.
However, nature provides regularly observable effects – the very basis of science – so,
therefore, efficient causality is constrained by an inherent limitation, i.e. final causality.

The concept of a dynamic teleological world process of actualizing potentials forms the
ontological basis for Bloch’s philosophy of hope. He writes,

> Only with the farewell to the closed, static concept of being does the real dimension of
> hope open. Instead, the world is full of propensity towards something, tending towards
> something, latency of something, and this intended something means fulfillment of the
> intending.48

In other words, the universe is active, a process that is open to genuinely novel developments in
the future. But more than that, all processes have entelechy, a drive to completion or
“fulfillment” of their latencies; consequently, all things have a future orientation as required by
a philosophy of hope. Consciously or not, they aim to realize themselves at their highest level
of development which he identifies with their ‘utopia.’ These latencies or potentials are as real
as the actually manifested attributes of things and help to establish their essential identity; the

potentials a thing possesses constitute part of what it is and distinguish it from the rest of reality
both as a member of a class of things and as an individual. Moreover, because all things
possess the entelechy to complete themselves to the maximal possible degree, Bloch is able to
claim that ‘utopia,’ the aim for one’s highest possible state, is an integral part of the real world
and that our understanding of this world is incomplete unless we take them into account.

> Reality without real possibilities is not complete, the world without future-laden
> propensities does not deserve a glance . . . Concrete utopia stands on the horizon of
> every reality; real possibility surrounds the open dialectical tendencies and latencies to
> the very last.49

Because all things have real potentials, Bloch describes them as “not yet” 50 or “Not-Yet-Being”

\[51\] involved in “venturing beyond” 52 themselves as they are, i.e. engaged in ‘self-
transcendence.’ They seek to complete themselves by striving for the “concrete utopia,” i.e.
their best possible state of being and in that sense, hope is an inherent and objective part of their
existence. It “is not merely a projection of reason, a ‘mental creation’ of human thought but an
expression of what is really possible.”53

The “concrete utopia” standing “on the horizon of every reality” is the ontological basis
for hope, the positive forward orientation towards new actualizations of other potentials and the
fulfillment of each potential at its highest level. In humans, this structurally present hope comes
to light as “anticipatory consciousness” in which we are guided by what we know could be.
This may manifest as dreams, day-dreams (Bloch distinguishes the two) in literature or film and

\[49\] [ibid. 223] Emphasis added.

\[50\] [ibid. 114] Bloch uses the phrase “not-yet” in various combinations throughout his books, as in “not-
yet-conscious” [ibid. 113] or “That-Which-Is-Not-Yet” [ibid. 237].The purpose is to indicate the
incomplete nature of all things.

even political manifestoes. Hope, therefore, is not merely a personal subject response, but
rather is an epistemological act based on awareness of the nature of reality itself. To say it
paradoxically, hope is realistic; indeed, it is the only realistic attitude towards reality because it
alone recognizes the intrinsic drive to actualize and complete inherent potentials.

At this point it is clear that despite the differences of language, the Bahá’í Writings and
Bloch’s philosophy of hope share similar ontologies regarding the process nature of the
phenomenal world. This is important because it means that many of the similarities between
the two philosophies are foundational, i.e. grounded in similar ontologies and are, therefore,
essential and are not merely coincidental or accidental. However, because the Bahá’í Writings
are religious in nature and Bloch’s work comes from the militantly anti-religious Marxist
tradition, we shall have to examine whether there is any meeting or at least convergence on the
subject of God.

On the basis of this teleological, forward-looking ontology, Bloch and the Bahá'í
Writings also share a fundamentally positive or optimistic outlook on the phenomenal world,
human nature and history. There are always two processes going on in human development – a
declining process but more importantly, a growing or developing process as new, hitherto
hidden potentials actualize or manifest themselves.

Precisely because of this forward-looking vision, Bloch describes his philosophy as
‘utopian.’ For him, ‘utopian’ does not refer to dreams of impossibly perfect societies, people or
environments; rather, it refers to the intrinsic drive of all things to the actualization and
completion or perfection of their own potentials. Glimmers of this drive can be detected in
even the most decrepit and degenerate human productions, so there is always something
positive to observe in them. Amidst the dead, decaying, historical forms of religions or culture
we can still find a living, humanly worthwhile aspect, which Bloch calls the “utopian surplus”54

Ernst Bloch. The Spirit of Utopia. Trans. by Anthony A. Nassar. (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press,

\[54\] 
2000) 196.

or a “cultural surplus.”55 This surplus is worth salvaging or re-inventing in a new form as
culture evolves.

In the Bahá'í Writings, this positive outlook is evident in the doctrine of “progressive
revelation” in which Manifestations provide

> a restatement of the eternal verities underlying all the religions of the past, as a unifying
> force instilling into the adherents of these religions a new spiritual vigor, infusing them
> with a new hope and love for mankind, firing them with a new vision of fundamental
> unity of their religious doctrines, and unfolding to their eyes the glorious destiny that
> awaits the human race.56

In this one statement we readily discern convergences with Bloch’s philosophy. The “eternal
verities” retained and developed by successive Manifestations are reflected in Bloch’s “utopian
surplus” or “cultural surplus” that should be saved and integrated into future developments.
The hopeful, positive spirit is seen in the “new spiritual vigor,” the “new hope” and the
“glorious destiny” which the new revelation infuses into humankind. These phrases also
implicitly contain the idea of progress that is so essential to Bloch because a “new vision,”
“new spirit” and so on require that some teachings that are not “eternal verities” will be left
behind as we move beyond them. The positive attitude that Bloch and the Writings share is
succinctly and vividly conveyed by `Abdu'l-Bahá’s story of Jesus and the dead dog. Seeing a
decaying dog carcass, the disciples remarked how awful it looked and smelled, to which Christ
replied by pointing out its shining white teeth. 57 This story illustrates the attitude Bahá'ís are
encouraged to cultivate. Bahá'ís are encouraged to look for positive, ‘utopian’ signs of
development as humanity actualizes the potential for a spiritually unified global society even

though these ‘utopian’ signs are often found among symptoms of decay and degeneration of an
old and dying world order.

Thus, for Bloch and the Bahá'í Writings, the criticism that their proposals and teachings
are ‘utopian’ is not negative, but rather, positive because for them the term ‘utopian’ refers to
the essential nature, a genuine inherent impulse, of all phenomenal beings. Because all things
strive for their potential utopian state, the Lesser and the Most Great Peace are not impossible
dreams but realizable intrinsic possibilities of the human condition that are available for
individual and collective choice and subsequent action. It is up to us to develop the
“anticipatory consciousness”58 that allows us to recognize and actualize the “emancipatory
potential,”59 in our personal and collective situations. Doing so requires what Bloch calls a
“rationalism of the heart,”60 which goes beyond the “thinking theoretical Cartesian subject[]”61
and the “reflexive mechanics”62 of abstract intellectuality.
The Philosophy of God

Were Ernst Bloch a militantly polemical “new atheist” in the manner of Richard
Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens or a philosophical atheist like Marx, Freud, Bertrand Russell
or Jean-Paul Sartre, it would be extraordinarily difficult if not impossible to harmonize his
beliefs with those of the Bahá’í Writings on the subject of God. However, while Bloch
certainly portrayed himself as a Marxist, the issue of his ‘atheism’ is far from clear. In the first
place, he made prolonged efforts to salvage a useable “utopian surplus”63 from humanity’s
religious past, especially from Judaism and Christianity, though he also accepted other religions

as well as mythology as repositories of the “utopian surplus.” Obviously he does not really
think of religion as nothing but “opium”64 for the people.

In his struggle to adapt the “utopian surplus” from religion, Bloch “refunctioned”65 i.e.

re-interpreted certain religious motifs to show how ancient beliefs often pointed to values
and/or ideas that were useful in other ages and in vastly different material-economic
circumstances. For example, Bloch “re-functions” Christ, the “Son of Man” to represent a new
awareness of the potentials inherent in earthly existence and human beings themselves.66 This
aspect of Christ is part of the enduring “utopian surplus” of human evolution, whereas the
portrayal of Christ as the “Son of God” is, for Bloch, merely a dispensable artifact of a past
cultural situation. Bloch’s ideas overlap somewhat with the Bahá’ís concept of “progressive
revelation,” 67 i.e. the belief that God sends successive Manifestations to restate the “eternal
verities”68 as humankind evolves, to separate essential from non-essential culture-bound
elements, and to “separate[ ] the God-given truths from the priest-prompted superstitions.”69
Although different in Their outward historical appearances, these Manifestations are spiritually
one. Bloch’s ideas and the Bahá’í teaching of progressive revelation coincide on the existence
of religious teachings that endure through time and are valid across cultural differences. This
implies that religion has some positive value – an idea which conflicts with Marxism. On the
other hand, Bloch’s philosophy can not embrace the Bahá’í teaching that Manifestations are
sent by God and are essentially one, sharing the station of

“essential unity.”70 However, as we have seen here, and will see below, Bloch’s philosophy has
a very ‘porous border’ with religion; its atheism is an accidental feature of his philosophy,
whereas its openness to the transcendent and God is foundational or essential.

Furthermore, Bloch’s beliefs about the ontological reality of potentials raise questions
about the nature of his atheism. Bloch admits that his ontology is not compatible with strict
materialism which he actually describes as “vulgar materialism,”71 i.e. a materialism that denies
the existence of anything that cannot be measured and is not physical, be it matter or energy.
But what about potentials and latencies? In material things, they have no physical existence as
separable entities somehow ‘hidden’ in matter and in that sense are not objects of scientific
study. Yet for Bloch (and the Baha’i Writings) they are as real as any physical attribute and are
essential to understanding what a thing actually is. However, if potentials are real but not
material or scientifically measurable, they must somehow be transcendent to phenomenal
reality. But an obvious question arises. If these transcendent realities exist, then how do we
rule out the existence of God, Who, like these potentials is also real but not material? There is
nothing within Bloch’s philosophy that rules out God, although, God will have to be thought of
in a non-traditional way. Indeed, as we shall see below, Bloch’s concept of God comes very
close to one of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s characterizations of God.

Further exploration of Bloch’s quasi-atheism requires a brief detour through Ludwig
Feuerbach’s radical theory about the nature of religion. Here, too, we shall find similarities to
the Bahá’í Writings. According to Feuerbach (1804-1872), humans make God in their image,
just as the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon said that if oxen could imagine gods,
they would imagine them as oxen – a poetic pre-figuration of Feuerbach’s concept of God as
the outward projection or objectification of the human essence freed from all phenomenal
limitations. Humans objectify or project their own inner nature – intelligence love, creativity,

justice but also anger, a demand for obedience, a desire to punish – and they call this objectified
image of themselves ‘God’ to Whom they give a separate existence that transcends phenomenal
reality. In Feuerbach’s view, humans free themselves from God by recognizing themselves in
their image of God; then they are no longer in its power. When humans re-appropriate all of
God’s attributes back to themselves, God ceases to exist. He becomes no more than a negative
idea without knowable content.

Bloch basically accepts the outlines of Feuerbach’s view but develops it in his own
direction. He agrees that “religious founders represent a mythologically disguised possibility of
becoming human,”72 i.e. the God worshipped by humans is a perfected vision of ourselves
disguised as existing transcendentally on a higher ontological, epistemological and ethical
plane. For Bloch as for Feuerbach, atheism is the rejection of this projected, man-made vision
of God.

The Bahá’í Writings have a remarkably similar outlook. They recognize that the images
and conceptions of God that people possess are cultural and personal, i.e. do not – and cannot –
reflect God as He actually is in Himself. These images of God are as the human imagination
has shaped Him, usually not only as possessing our highest intellectual and moral ideals but
also as possessing unlimited strength and enormous punitive powers. We project these
idealized images of our deepest desires on the unknowable God. Our cognitive task is to
recognize these images for the man-made projections they are and not to mistake them for the
reality of God. For example, `Abdu’l-Bahá writes that people

> have pictured a god in the realm of the mind, and worship that image which they have
> made for themselves . . . They have created a creator within their own minds, and they

\[72\] Richard Roberts. Hope and Its Hieroglyph. (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990) 171.

call it the Fashioner of all that is -- whereas in truth it is but an illusion. Thus are the
people worshipping only an error of perception.73

Of course, God, “that Essence of Essences, that Invisible of Invisibles, is sanctified above all
human speculation, and never to be overtaken by the mind of man.”74 Whatever virtues we
attribute to God do not prove anything positive about God but only demonstrates that God does
not lack them: when we praise God, “[w]e affirm these names and attributes, not to prove the
perfections of God, but to deny that He is capable of imperfections.”75 We must never mistake
our images of God for God Himself.

This teaching is clearly foundational to the concept of progressive revelation which
involves, among other things, the necessity of leaving old, no longer historically appropriate
projections behind and advancing to higher levels of understanding. Our understanding of God
matures as the human race develops materially and spiritually under the guidance of God’s
Manifestations. Freeing ourselves from these projections opens new possibilities for spiritual,
intellectual, artistic and social evolution and, therefore, has an emancipatory function for us.
For example, progressive revelation can agree that our images of God can be shaped by our
economic relationships, including what Marx refers to as the “relations of production”76 i.e. the
relationship between those who own the means of production and those who do not. However,
when we understand the unknowability of God, we learn to free our images of God from our
economically shaped projections and, thereby, free ourselves too from limiting effects of these
man-made images. Of course, because of the limitations of human nature, we can never
completely free ourselves from these limitations.

The difference between the Bahá’í Faith and Bloch is that the Bahá’í Faith does not
regard the rejection of historically inappropriate projections of God as ‘atheism,’ i.e. the
ontological non-existence of a non-material transcendental entity Who is the origin of the
cosmos. It recognizes that we can accept the Feuerbachian thesis without necessarily adopting
atheism. In other words, we do not need to read Feuerbach ontologically – as Bloch sometimes
does – as a statement about God’s non-existence; rather, we can read Feuerbach
epistemologically, i.e. as a statement about human knowledge and understanding of God. Our
knowledge of God is limited but that limitation does not logically imply anything about God’s
existence.

The epistemological reading of Bloch’s (and Feuerbach’s) ‘atheism’ can lead to an
apophatic theology in which all positive assertions about God are, in the last analysis, rejected
or at best accepted as a heuristic device as an aid to reflection. But that is all these assertions
are since in Himself, God is unknowable, beyond human comprehension. This is close to the
position of the Bahá’í Writings.

> We speak of the names and attributes of the Divine Reality, and we praise Him by
> attributing to Him sight, hearing, power, life and knowledge. We affirm these names
> and attributes, not to prove the perfections of God, but to deny that He is capable of
> imperfections. When we look at the existing world, we see that ignorance is
> imperfection and knowledge is perfection; therefore, we say that the sanctified Essence
> of God is wisdom;77

`Abdu’l-Bahá emphasizes the inadequacy of our attributions to God – and thereby also opens
the way to an apophatic theology in which our ignorance of God in Himself does not become a
denial of His existence. Of course, the Writings are not limited to apophaticism since they also
require the development of a historically and culturally appropriate positive theology on the

\[77\] `Abdu'l-Bahá. Some Answered Questions. (Wilmette: Bahá'í Publishing Trust, 1990) 148.

basis of what the Manifestations reveal about God. Their revelations about God are the essence
of the Bahá’í Faith and are sufficient to provide individual and collective guidance.

We may approach this subject from another angle. If God is unknowable to us, the
question arises, ‘Does God even exist?’ While Feuerbach and subsequently Marx saw the
concept of God only as an alienation of our human essence and therefore, rejected it, Bloch, and
of course, the Bahá’í Faith do not follow the same path. According to Bloch, the ‘space’ left by
the rejection of the projected God is not empty. For Bloch, God is the horizon or farthest extent
of human possibilities, “the metaphysical correlate of this projection remains the hidden, the
still undefined-undefinitive, the real Possible in the sense of mystery.”78 It seems that for
Bloch, God continues as a “real Possible” for human evolution, as a goal for which to strive.
Moreover, this is no man-made, psychologically created God – it is a “real Possible,” something
with ontological reality of some sort, for as Bloch says, this space occupied by the “real
Possible” is not an illusion.79

A little reflection helps us realize that a “real Possible” is essentially unknowable
because as a ‘possibility” it is unlimited and whatever is unlimited is beyond human
comprehension. Here, too, Bloch’s ideas harmonize with the Bahá’í Writings. `Abdu’l-Bahá
characterizes God in a similar way when he writes,

> The very fact that the reality of phenomena is limited well indicates that there must
> needs be an unlimited reality, for were there no unlimited, or infinite, reality in life, the
> finite being of objects would be inconceivable.80

\[424\] 
21
The concept of God as an unlimited “real Possible” is also compatible with the Bahá’í position
that God is omnipotent and absolutely unconstrained since there is no limit to the possible. In
other words, Bloch’s concept of the “real Possible” goes a long way towards reviving many of
the traditional descriptors of God. The “real Possible” is omnipresent, or as Bahá’u’lláh says,
“No thing have I perceived, except that I perceived God within it, God before it, or God after
it."81 He is omniscient – since it is difficult to conceive how a being that can be everywhere
cannot know everything. It is free from time i.e. eternal because it does not exist on the
phenomenal plane like other particular beings. Finally, it has unity and “singleness”82 because
there cannot be more than one unlimited “real Possible.” In short, Bloch seems to have re-
invented God by a new name, the “real Possible.”

Of course, this concept of God as we have discussed it belongs to what is commonly
called “the God of the philosophers”83 as distinct from the “God of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob.”84 The former is more akin to an idea, a necessary ontological concept, whereas the
latter is Someone with Whom we can have a personal relationship, i.e. Who calls for a personal
response from us. Bloch’s philosophy has little or no room for such a God and, therefore, must
always remain incomplete from a theological point-of-view.

The subject of God raises another problem insofar as it highlights the issue of
‘transcendence.’ In the Bahá’í Writings God transcends His creation, because, among other
things, He is absolutely independent and everything else is absolutely dependent on Him.
Bloch’s problem is that his understanding of ‘transcendence’ leans more towards the spiritual or
philosophical idealist position than towards materialism. We have already seen this in his view
of potentials as real but not susceptible to scientific analysis, and then in the idea that there is a

“metaphysical correlate” of the projected God, who is described as a “real Possible.” It is
difficult to avoid the conclusion that his materialism is severely compromised.

The Philosophy of Human Nature

As we have seen, for Bloch, all beings, including human beings, are a becoming towards
the Not-Yet, i.e. towards the future that will develop from the real possibilities inherent in any
situation. Thus, for Bloch, human individuals and human history are “a repository of
possibilities that are living options for future action.”85 These “living options” are what Bloch
calls the “fact-based Possible”86 which, speaking generally, can by known by rationally
studying the components of reality and “their factual relations.”87 By observing these
components we can deduce some of the inherent possibilities or potentials for the future. These
potentials then become the focus of our future-oriented actions.

Because we are evolving beings in an evolving universe, hope is one of the most
prominent features of our existence, yet, paradoxically, until Bloch, it was one of the topics
least studied by philosophers. Previously, hope had been studied by theologians, who saw it as
a subjective response to our external situation and/or our inner spiritual condition. However,
Bloch sees it as something more:

> Expectation, hope, intention towards possibility that has still not become; this is not only
> a basic feature of human consciousness, but correctly corrected and grasped, a basic
> determination within objective reality as a whole.88

Hope, the teleological forward orientation towards a goal is an objectively, ontologically real
aspect of nature, and this aspect of reality manifests itself among humans as ‘hope’ which helps
to constitute human consciousness. In other words, hope is more than a subjective response.
Hope also has a cognitive function: it allows us to see the real possibilities latent in the world
around us, thus orienting present thought and action in light of the future. Consequently, hope
and the future shape both the present world and the individuals living in it.89 In this sense, the
future is present right now.

Consequently, living authentically, being an authentic human being requires us to
understand ourselves as living in hope,90 which is, in effect, living with an endless,
structurally given hunger.91 Such hunger is one of the major constitutive features of human
existence; it is an “enlightened hunger,”92 which preserves the self not only by rebelling against
external and internal strictures on authenticity but also by “self-extension,”93 i.e. by actualizing
new possibilities in the world and in itself. At the very foundation of human nature is a drive to
“fill a hollow space in the striving and longing, to fill something lacking with an external
something.”94 In other words, as `Abdu’l-Bahá says, humankind is intrinsically “restless and
dissatisfied,”95 always seeking something more. In a similar vein, Bahá’u’lláh writes that “All
men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization,”96 a statement
demonstrating the never ceasing future-oriented impulse that constitutes human nature. Such a
future orientation inherently contains a hunger, a dissatisfaction or yearning for something
better.

This kind of hunger and the resulting hope is often disguised as day-dreams at the
personal level, and as religious and/or mythical visions of ‘heaven,’ paradise, the Golden Age,
the golden islands of the Hesperides or even Valhalla. In these visions or dreams, the best
possibilities within ourselves or reality are actualized. Whether these visions are portrayed as
future states or as memories of a perfect past is less important than the fact that in them we
observe “a pre-appearance of the possible Real.”97 Rather than flights from reality, they are a
glimmering awareness of the real possibilities within ourselves and the world. Bloch calls our
dim awareness of the utopian elements a “Not Yet Conscious”98 which only sometimes
develops into full “anticipatory consciousness”99 informing our thoughts and actions. When
this occurs, we leave behind the myths and begin to develop plans and even visions for the
future, both as individuals and societies; we begin to write constitutions or utopian books and to
institute reforms aimed at dignifying peoples’ lives. All these activities are products of the
“anticipatory consciousness” which is an essential aspect of the human mind.

Let us pause for a moment to consider whether Bloch’s views on human nature
harmonize with the Bahá’í Writings. We have already noted that the Writings endorse the view
that all created things, including human beings, are in the process of actualizing their latent
potentials, i.e. their “real possibilities” to use Bloch’s terminology. For example, `Abdu’l-Bahá
says, “There is brotherhood potential in humanity because all inhabit this earthly globe under
the one canopy of heaven.”100 This assertion illustrates what Bloch means by a real possibility.
The potential for global harmony, is not based on mere wish or fantasy, but on empirically
verifiable facts about our habitation on the same planet and the actualization of all the hidden
potentials of that fact.

\[129\] 
25
However, a question remains. Do the Writings have anything that corresponds to
Bloch’s concept of hunger? The answer is found in one of Bahá’u’lláh’s prayers. He refers to
God as “my Desire and the Desire of all things.”101 If God is our desire, then it follows that we
have a hunger for God. Furthermore, if we have a genuine hunger for God and wish to draw
near to Him, then we will do what God wishes us to do which is to actualize our various
intellectual, social and above all spiritual potentials. Thus, while our ‘primary’ hunger is for
God, our ‘mediate’ hunger is for the potentials that lie within us. This idea is re-enforced in the
same prayer where we read, “my Aim and the Aim of all things.” A moment’s reflection helps
us realize that an ‘aim’ is something for which we hunger – why else would we aim for
something? – and since we hunger or aim for God, we also implicitly hunger for that which God
desires for us, i.e. the actualization of our infinite potentials.102

Another convergence between the Bahá’í Writings and Bloch is the emphasis on both
contemplation or reflection and action. `Abdu’l-Bahá says that “faith compriseth both
knowledge and the performance of good deeds.”103 This makes it clear that “conscious
knowledge” is not only for reflection and mediation, important as these are, but is also intended
as a basis for action. Knowledge and action are correlates, and each is deficient without the
other: actionless knowledge and ignorant action benefit no one. Bloch refers to “theory-
practice”104 in which he rejects static contemplation or theory as incomplete and asserts the
“theoretical-practical primacy of true philosophy.”105 In other words, philosophy or, more
generally, knowledge or cognition, should not be isolated from action.

In my view, Bloch’s views on these matters harmonize well with the Bahá’í Writings
though we must ‘read through’ a language more akin to Hegel, Marx and Heidegger than to
Bahá’u’lláh. For example, the dim “Not-Yet-Consciousness” or sense of deeper and better

\[105\] [ibid. 280]

potentials available in ourselves and in reality leaves humans inherently restless and unsatisfied
in their quest for further development. This portrayal of human nature complements `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s description of human beings as intrinsically “restless and dissatisfied.”106 Bloch also
sees human nature as inherently restless, always seeking new possibilities in our inner and outer
environment, and consequently, always anticipating future events. This “Not-Yet-
Consciousness” i.e. “anticipatory consciousness” which makes us dissatisfied with the status
quo encourages our independent investigation of truth, an attitude of detachment from
everything except the truth107 and an attitude of willingness to accept new truths or new
explanations of truths. It must be emphasized that the truth about things for Bloch and the
Writings is not simply what a thing is but also includes currently the real possibilities latent in
any thing or situation. This is the all important aspect of reality and we must never let it out of
our sight because without it, the grounds for real, rational hope vanish and we will only get a
distorted understanding of reality.

The convergence between the Writings and Bloch on the issue of the human soul is
tenuous because the concept of a soul is undeveloped in Bloch’s work. Strictly speaking, given
his supposed materialism there should be no convergence on this topic at all because the Bahá’í
concept of the soul involves its transcendence of the body and matter in general.108 However,
as already observed, Bloch’s materialism is highly suspect not only vis-à-vis the ontological
existence of potentials, but also vis-à-vis God’s existence as “the metaphysical correlate of this
projection [of God] remains the hidden, the still undefined-undefinitive, the real Possible in the
sense of mystery.”109 Could the personal soul also be a “real Possible” that transcends the
material world? Could there also be a hidden “metaphysical correlate” of the projection of the
soul? Bahá'u'lláh seems to support this view insofar as He tells us that the soul is a mystery
beyond all our particular understandings of it.

> sign of God, a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to grasp,
> and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever hope to unravel.110

At this point it is clear that Bloch’s philosophy on the subject of the soul is sufficiently
ambiguous to be open to different, even contradictory, interpretations. No definitive answer is
possible either way and the best that we can do is note that on the subject of the soul, there is a
possible convergence.

Bloch’s Principle of Hope also provides the study of human nature with a universally
applicable method of analyzing humanity’s cultural products in a positive manner. Because
“utopia is always latent in every cultural product,”111 we can analyze myth, art, music,
literature, film and theater to look for the “cultural or utopian surplus,” i.e. for those universal
qualities such as a sense of dignity, meaning, freedom, and security, which inform human
striving for the future. In this way, Bloch presents himself as the “redemptive reader”112 who
saves what is essentially human from the mass of culture-bound particulars. As, for example,
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s story of Christ and the dead dog makes clear, Bahá’ís need not depend on
Bloch’s method to salvage the positive potentials among the signs of the decay of the old world
order. This quest for the positive
in all things is an integral part of the Bahá’í world-view with its emphasis on establishing a
new, more inclusive and more constructive world order. However, by reading Bloch’s
commentaries especially on social developments and the arts, Bahá’ís may learn additional
ways of identifying the constructive, forward-looking elements and potentials.

\[112\] [ibid. 37]

In Bloch’s method of analysis, it is irrelevant whether the art is ‘high’ or low’ (‘pop’)
since traces of the “utopian surplus” can be found even in the ‘low’ or ‘popular’ arts. Art, or
cultural productions in general, begins in current reality (“the Become”) and then develops into
more completely developed expressions of the future potentials inherent in reality.113 In other
words, it begins in the contemporary ‘Zeitgeist’ or ‘spirit of the times’ and then explicitly or
implicitly shows us the way to future developments in society. For Bloch “Art is a laboratory
and also a feast of implemented possibilities.”114 The ‘implementation’ refers to the imaginative
extension of the “cultural or utopian surplus” into a completed work of art. The same principles
can be applied to cultural analysis.

The foregoing similarities notwithstanding, there is one significant difference between
Bloch’s and the Bahá’í Writings’ philosophy of human nature: transcendence. According to the
Writings human beings have both an animal and spiritual nature; because it transcends the
animal nature, the spiritual nature, the soul, is able to control our lower proclivities as it strives
towards God by trying to actualize its spiritual potentials. In other words, human lives are not
entirely immanent in the natural, material world; even when we die, we pass into a transcendent
spiritual realm where our evolution continues. Bloch’s views on this issue, as we have seen
above, are ambivalent, amenable to interpretations that both support and deny the existence of a
‘transcendent’ aspect of human nature.

Conclusion

Two main conclusion can be drawn from this survey comparison of the Bahá’í Writings
and Ernst Bloch. The first is that they share significant similarities and/or convergences in their
fundamental ontology, their belief in the importance of religion, and their understanding of
human nature. Consequently, further investigation into this subject is worthwhile since this
study is only an initial reconnaissance. Further studies have an intrinsic value for those

interested in learning in what ways and to what degree the Bahá’í Writings relate and speak to
the concepts advanced by the various leaders of thought in the time for which the Writings were
revealed.

Secondly, we conclude that further investigation into correlating the Bahá’í Writings
and Bloch is important because doing so opens the door to dialogue with such highly influential
Christian theologians as Jurgen Moltmann. His widely-read Theology of Hope which is
explicitly based on Bloch’s The Principle of Hope, sparked the “theology of hope” movement
in contemporary Christianity. A knowledge of Bloch is also useful in Bahá’í teaching work
among people from a left-wing background. Bloch’s language and references are already
familiar and meaningful to them and this makes it easier for them to follow his arguments,
especially when these lead into the direction of the Faith. The differences with Bloch’s
philosophy and his application of it in the world of politics should not blind us to what is
valuable and useable in it. Let us recall `Abdu'l-Bahá and the dead dog.
