    Dialogue Among Civilizations: Ancient and

Future, Transitions and Potentials

Theo A. Cope

Abstract

The dialogue between the ancient Chinese civilization and the nascent
Bahá'í civilization is in its beginning phase. We note in the Chinese
system many images and ideas that resonate with Bahá'í thought and
enable us to examine how this very old civilization contemplated the role
of embodiment and transformation. This article briefly examines some
similarities as found in a meditation upon the Book of Changes (             .
It then highlights the differences that exist between western and Chinese
philosophical thought, drawing out how these ideas are similar to what we
find in Bahá'í philosophy, while transcending them. It will present brief
considerations of language, epistemology, and ontological foundations.
Further, it will look at the notion of embodiment as presented in the
Chinese view of the noble person, the junzi, from Confucianism, as well
as its presentation in Bahá’í thought. Finally it will consider the place of
filial piety and world civilization in the two systems. It is contended that
these motifs, themes and images in Chinese culture that resonate with the
Bahá'í Faith lie at the roots of the Chinese psyche. In BaháVllálťs
Revelation, we find the re-expression of these truths since they are what
are needed to re-vitalize and re-animate human civilizations and transform
them from the materialistic basis that is dominant to one founded upon
spiritual principles. In order to perform this, the roots of our soul need to
be reactivated and it is the Power of the Manifestation, we are told, that
can best effectuate this collective transformation to the stage of maturity.

1\. New and Old

If we simply state that all civilizations are undergoing great transition, we
speak nothing novel. Most people living will assert such a truism. If we,
on the other hand, assert that we are living in the midst of and witnessing
the destruction of civilizations and the consequent rebirth of civilizations,
we speak a thought that echoes through the veils of time. Chinese thought,
as embodied in the I Ching, the Book o f Changes, and myriad other
philosophical treatises in its history, recognizes the implicit cycles of
ascent and descent of civilizations. Likewise, Bahá'í thought presents for
our consideration the fact of the birth of a new civilization founded upon
spiritual premises and principles, and the destruction of civilizations
founded upon materialistic premises. We are at the dawning of such a
process, and it is at dawn that one centers oneself and decides the events
of the future.

This paper will briefly examine the congruence of Bahá'í and Chinese
thought as it pertains to metaphysics, humanity and the earth. In fact,
what I hope to express clearly is how Chinese philosophy strove and how
Bahá'í thought enables us to live an embodied metaphysics, a metaphysics
that demands action, that cannot be separated from living, from building
and maintaining civilization. In this way, we are enabled to glimpse how
it is that the Bahá’í Faith, as enunciated by Bahá'u'lláh, 'Abdu'1-Bahá, and
Shoghi Effendi, reach back through the veils of time in activating modes
of being that have strong resonance in the human psyche, while at the
same time propelling us into a more mature contemplation of these
modes. This dialogue, then, will permit us to know why and how we can
live a life characterized as “personified intellect and embodied spirit.” 1

This embodiment is the hallmark of both Chinese civilization’s roots, and
core of the nascent and future Bahá'í civilization. The images, symbols
and motifs we find in the Bahá'í corpus have a deep resonance with
myriad symbolic systems throughout the world. We should not find this
surprising since religion seeks to transform the human psyche from its
total involvement with physical life to a life characterized by a connection
with the spiritual order informing mundane existence. Symbols serve the
human soul in its process of transformation by serving as foci for such

changes. In order to implement a global civilization, the Bahá'i religion
seeks to transform the myriad human societies from their concern with
limited national interests to planetary perspectives, and the personal to the
collective, without thereby losing individuality. The differentiation of the
particular unit is a vital process; it must be accomplished by an integration
with the universal so that a mature stage of development is achieved. By
reaching back through the depths of time, this religious system (the Bahá'í
Faith) awakens and transmutes symbolic systems, revitalizing them and
infusing them with new energy. Such revitalization strikes to the core of
human psychospiritual being, activating modes of being that have been
cast aside. These powers are ones that ennoble the individual and enable
her or him to attain self-mastery. Through self-mastery, one enters a
dialogue with others on different grounds, on equal footing. Equal footing
enables social cohesiveness and development along peaceful lines.

These lines of dialogue are followed by many scholars pursuing a
Chinese-Western debate, though without the spiritual and religious
implications addressed by the Bahá'í position. It is contended that the
Bahá'í Faith provides for our edification and spiritual transformation by
presenting a clear principle in the Bahá'í Writings that explains this
simply and clearly. BaháVlláh says,

> “From the heaven of God's Will, and for the purpose of ennobling the
> world of being and of elevating the minds and souls of men, hath been
> sent down that which is the most effective instrument for the education
> of the whole human race. The highest essence and most perfect
> expression of whatsoever the peoples of old have either said or written
> hath, through this most potent Revelation, been sent down from the
> heaven of the Will of the All-Possessing, the Ever-Abiding God.”2

One reason why we find within the Bahá'í corpus such resonating
concepts is because they are what are needed for the transformation of the
individual, spiritually and psychologically.     Once transformed, the
individual then proceeds to effect transformation within societies, with
transformation ultimately extending throughout the entire world system.
The loss of true interconnection with the cosmos, and interconnection
with others has resulted in a fragmented world system. The time we are

42              THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

living in is truly an “Age of Transition” from a world of divided, self-
seeking nations to a world federation. “The tumult of this age of transition
is characteristic of the impetuosity and irrational instincts of youth, its
follies, its prodigality, its pride, its self-assurance, its rebelliousness, and
contempt of discipline.”3 Bahá'u'lláh, so he claims, has brought what is
needed for the passage of the species from a stage characterized as
adolescent to that of maturity. The words he used were what the collective
species of humanity has used in its attempts to order life. Bahá’u'lláh’s
languages were Arabic and Persian, though the concepts he used were
universal. The archetypal nature of these concepts are such that they
resonate with the deepest chords of the human psyche, from distinct and
diverse civilizations, beliefs, and time periods.

Let us not be naive and assume that what we find within the Confucian,
Taoist or Buddhist texts were universally or fairly applied in China. The
beauty they aspire to, the injunctions they enjoin, the virtues they
inculcate, remained limited in application and inaccessible to the majority.
More than this, some were misused by the minority that theoretically held
to them, used for control or manipulation of an uneducated population.
The feudal bureaucratic system established by Confucians, and the
changes in Buddhist texts to entice the population to donate to
monasteries, indicate how these systems were adapted for socio-economic
purposes.4

Chinese philosophers, especially after the rise of Neo-Confucianism, held
to the universality of their ideas, and ascribed a superiority to their
cultural views compared to the ‘barbaric’ western nations. This system
offered a code of conduct and virtues to delineate it, but no belief system.
Taoist thought offers these components, but the belief system is
transpersonal only inasmuch as the Tao (xfi) is transpersonal. The debate
currently among modem scholars is to what degree the Tao can be said to
be transpersonal in a transcendent meaning. It is transpersonal in that it
transcends the individual but its transcendental aspect is questionable.
Buddhism proffered a code of belief, but by the time it reached China, it
had undergone many transformations and interpretations, and many

superstitions were overlaid onto it. The intermingling of Confucian,
Taoist and Buddhist philosophies indicates the fluidity, harmony, and, at
times, tension that existed in Chinese thought. Each system impacted the
other, flavored the language and philosophical concerns, and often vied
for priority in the society. There was often a large gap between the
religious hierarchy and popular religious thought, with the popular level
blending all three indiscriminately. With the transformations of time and
interaction with other nations, these Chinese notions were forced to
change.5 In contemporary China, these roots are unknown by the majority,
but they lay at the core of their psychological being.

This in no way belittles these concepts’ immense value for “rectifying
conduct,” acquiring virtues, or pondering how one becomes a stable and
mature being within the midst of change and chaos. Perhaps the
restatement of such concepts within a new religious system is due to their
unplumbed value for humanity; this time, these symbols and ideas come
with the power required to effect such change within the hearts. It derives
from a Divine Power bom of God, we are told. ’Abdu’l-Bahá, the son of
Bahá'u’lláh, founder of the Bahá'í Faith, informs a potential teacher of the
Chinese that they “must be imbued with their spirit, know their sacred
literature, study their national customs, and speak to them from their own
standpoint and using their own terminologies.”6 One reason for this is that
the Chinese views are profound in their wisdom, and detailed in the
mannerisms of personal transformation. Based on a desire to maintain
order within change, Chinese philosophical thought contributes greatly to
our understanding the necessary psychological processes and demands for
such transformation. It takes a power transcending the human realm to
transmute effectively and on a large scale the natural impulses and
instinctual drives of human beings in order to implement the ideals
embodied in Chinese philosophy on a social scale. Divine Revelation
proffers to humanity such a power, one that transcends and yet is
immanent within the realm of humanity. A personal relationship with the
Logos principle, the Manifestation of God, is what revealed religions offer
to facilitate such transmutation. The Bahá'í Faith offers a code of

conduct, a code of virtues, as well as a code of beliefs in a transpersonal,
transcendental order that provides a personal relationship as well.7

2\. Order and Change

Richard Wilhelm, an early German scholar, wrote much regarding the I
Ching, the Book o f Changes (Yijing) and even translated the work into
German. The eight primary trigrams of the I Ching, composed of three
lines each, either broken or solid, combine in various manners to compose
the 64 hexagrams, each with six lines, and have “very interesting
psychological implications.”8 These trigrams are “symbols standing for
transitional states; they are images that are constantly undergoing
change.”9 In order to grasp the meanings behind these images, time and
contemplation are required. Kongzi is recorded to have stated when he
was already an old man, “If I could add 50 years to my life, I would study
the Changes and become free of error.”10 This work is a treasure house of
symbols. “Symbols are representations, speaking of one thing to allude to
something else.”11 The I Ching is an ancient symbolic system used for
myriad purposes through thousands of years of time; it has impacted many
civilizations, but perhaps none as deeply as the Chinese. It impacted the
18th century German philosopher Leibniz, and the arrangement of his
binary system, and through him changed aspects of Western thought. It is
this binary system that is at the roots of computer technology.

In the historical presentation of the I Ching, there are two circular
arrangements of importance. The “Earlier Heaven,” or “Primal
Arrangement,” is attributed to Fu Xi, a legendary sage who is also given
the credit for designing the eight trigrams. These symbols were derived
before Kongzi and before the Zhou Dynasty. They are set out in a pattern,
similar to the Later Heaven Arrangement as given below, but these

trigrams are arranged differently. The arrangement is set up as polarities
with each trigram’s “opposite.” Each trigram is characterized as male or
female, and is given a “family” placement consisting of the father,
mother, three male, and three female offspring, along with myriad natural
symbols.

According to the “Later Heaven,” or “Inner-World” Arrangement, a
method for diagramming the trigrams attributed to King Wen of the Zhou
Dynasty (1122-256 BC), the trigrams are presented as they unfold in the
temporal progression in the world. A meditation upon these present an
arrangement such that these symbols become placed in the sequence of
time: daily time.

Arrangement of King Wen

Thus, we note that each of these trigrams can describe different states of
psychological bearing, and each stage lasts three hours, with the climax at
the mid point, that is, VA hours into the particular period. We have, for
example the time period from 4:30 am to 7:30 am, with the climax at 6:00
am. This coincides with sunrise and is explained in the Commentary of
the I Ching as “God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing” and the

46             THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ’1 STUDIES REVIEW

arousing is the trigram chen/zhen, the eldest son that symbolizes
awakening, thunder and a host of other images. It represents new
movement of life:

> “The sun rises, morning slowly dawns, and things attain reality. At
> first, only psychic, innermost elements are awakened to life; the shell
> of sleep is cast off. But this casting off is the first budding connection
> with the outside world. And here, immediately at the beginning of day,
> an act of conscious decision must take place. For at the first movement
> of life, things are still far removed from us, but just because they are
> far we must influence the budding beginnings of the surrounding world
> in such a way as to permit only the approach of what is suitable for us.
> The trigram, the Arousing, is very suitable for us. And the nature of its
> activity determines the way events of the surrounding world will take
> shape for us.”12

Here we see a symbolic explanation, as presented by an ancient culture, of
a very profound psychological fact: at the beginning of each day, as our
awareness returns to the terrestrial world, we need to make a conscious
choice to align ourselves with the forces of life, with spirit. Likewise, we
note very clearly in Baha’i thought that believers are enjoined and given
this advice:

> “Blessed is he who, at the hour of dawn, centring his thoughts on God,
> occupied with His remembrance, and supplicating His forgiveness,
> directeth his steps to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar and, entering therein,
> seateth himself in silence to listen to the yerses of God...”13

This Mashriqu’l-Adhkar is the House of Worship, the term literally means
“Dawning Place of Remembrance.” It is not just a religious edifice, but a
social institution offering benefit to humanity. Currently there are seven
such Houses of Worship, each on different continents. Each of these
buildings is the center of the social institution that will provide care for all
peoples, regardless of belief, nationality or gender. Each is built with nine
doors, symbolizing the openness to all directions of the planet and the
major religions of the world.

Lest we think this is only a physical location, we are provided an
understanding that transcends place. 'Abdu'1-Bahá states that: “In reality
pure hearts are the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar and from them the voice of
supplication and invocation continually reach the Supreme Concourse.”14
So, we are given to understand that the individual enters the symbolic
heart and there communes. This entering is focused upon meditation and
prayer, a communion with the interior reality of existence. Through these
actions, the heart is purified, the behavior is rectified, and the personal is
made to harmonize with the social and cosmic. We witness here a symbol
apt for an embodied metaphysics, a metaphysics that is intimately
connected with daily living, self transformation, and ultimately
transformation of the world. The Supreme Concourse is a Bahá'í term
that refers to the spiritual world, and we are told that the spiritual world
exists “within this world.”15 No separation except in our physical
dimension is conceived for these worlds; the separation is only in our
thinking and perceiving.

Following the I Ching placements further, we notice that, in the same
Later Heaven Arrangement of the trigrams, the trigram ch ’ien/qian
stands in the position of night, 8:30 to 10:30 pm. Qian is the Creative,
characterized as the father, and the I Ching states: “God does battle in the
sign of the Creative.”16 Wilhelm adds: “The work of the day is done; with
pleasure and joy things have been concluded. But now the question
arises: has this day been of productive value, or was it a petty emptiness?
Hence the Creative, because man must justify himself.”17

In a similar vein, we find an injunction in the Bahá'í Writings: “Bring
thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to a reckoning; for

death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be called to give
account for thy deeds.”18

From these short passages from Chinese and from Bahá'í thought, we
observe the injunction and advice to center our thoughts, during the hours
of dawn, and make a connection with the deep roots of existence. To
center oneself, to contemplate, with the heart and dawn as the place and
time of remembrance, enables us to profoundly reconnect with the
spiritual dimension of life, and to do so when the day first begins so that
we may order and choose the response we might maintain as the day
unfolds. This centering permits us to have conscious response-ability to
the day’s events. Likewise, to review the progress or events of the day
permits one to examine behaviors, thoughts and deeds that impact the
world and self. It is striking that in both views the same message is
spoken. In the Bahá'í Faith, we are given symbolic images that connect
with the deep recesses of our being and, in the I Ching we discover how
these symbols were envisioned before. Each system has as an integral
component a centering of the self within the spiritual, and a daily
examination of the self.

3\. Maturity and Metaphysics

This transition of time and consciousness, this centering one’s thoughts
and making conscious decisions, as well as taking conscious account of
our actions, heralds us into the stance of maturity. It takes a mature being
to attain such an awareness, and this is not dependent upon chronological
age. It is noteworthy here that Bahá'u'lláh has set the age of maturity,
with respect to religious duties, at age 15 years. This imposes upon all at
and above such age a conscious awareness and responsibility of our daily
activities, and for one at such a young chronological age, portends much
for psychological development. The Bahá'í Faith has as one of its central
premises that humanity, collectively, is now embarked upon this stage of
evolution and that Bahá'u'lláh brought the spiritual power required for
humanity to attain this stage of collective and personal maturity.

18 Bahá'u'lláh, The Hidden Words o f Bahd'u'lldh, p. 31.

A mature understanding requires that we fully realize the fact that the
Eastern and Western civilizations held metaphysical views which relied
upon ancient thought, and developed differently. Thus, in the West, all
proponents of such views looked backwards to Plato, Aristotle, or
Plotinus and Neoplatonism for proof of their suppositions; in China, all
Confucians receded to Kongzi or Mengzi to negate speculative views,
while the Taoists went to Lao Zi or Zhuangzi to bolster their views.
While the Confucian school did not develop views that were construed to
be as metaphysical as the Taoists, it was an inevitable later development,
given the mutual influences and the passage of time. 19

Bahá'u'lláh, on the other hand, overturns many such formative ideas and
presents a re-visioned view of those ideas that we witness in Western as
well as Chinese civilization and philosophy. In order to approach this, let.
us begin by also looking back, but do so with full awareness and intent to
re-think these ideas.

Chinese metaphysics has been called “the least metaphysical of all
metaphysics or is non-metaphysical” compared to Greek, that is Western,
metaphysics.20 If this is true, then we should be able to differentiate these
two metaphysical views with some clarity, briefly address a Bahá'í stance,
and thus establish a further dialogue among civilizations. Indeed, this can
be done with simplicity. To pursue these ideas deeply will lead us astray
from our intent of a Bahá'í-China dialogue. The interested reader may
turn to the many sources available to verify or negate the truthfulness of
such views.

First, Chinese and Greek languages differ greatly, the former being image
based, the latter phonetic. Among contemporary scholars, Cheng asserts
that the phonetic basis of Greek language has nothing in it “to suggest the
presence of sensible objects.”21 As such, the Greek language contributed

19 The influence o f Buddhist thought in this arena, in similar motifs presented and images
used, is vital to grasp, but is outside the scope o f this brief article. Sim Tze Hong’s article
in this publication holds many insights. Also, see A. Khursheed’s article commenting on
the influence o f Buddhism in Chinese philosophy, “Science and Religion in Chinese
Culture,” in The Singapore Bahd'i Studies Review , especially, pp. 147-154.
20 Cheng, C. “Chinese Metaphysics as Non-metaphysics: Confucian and Taoist Insights
into the Nature o f Reality” in Understanding the Chinese Mind: The Philosophical Roots,
ed. Allinson, R, p. 167.
21 Cheng, op. cit., p. 167.

to far greater abstract thought, greatly divorced from practical empirical
reality. Greek thought searched for Being, that is, the nature of the One,
or the Unmoved Mover. Christianity took up this quest with the nature of
God, the Logos (Word), the interrelation between these and this world of
temporal existence. This world was the domain of becoming, and as such
held for Greek thought little value for truth. The search for permanency
was the ideal Greek quest, epitomized by Plato and his Eidos, the Platonic
Ideas that were supposed to exist in a “supercelestial place.” For Plato
and his successors, these ideas were the Universal Forms of each
Particular existing thing. The transitory particular derived its nature from
the permanent universal which was conceived as a static reality. These
umversals contained no matter, and how something that contained no
matter could engender things with such matter was a severe challenge to
later philosophers. Aristotle refuted his teacher’s notion, but held to the
assertion that there were universals; however, these umversals derived
their existence after the particulars. The debates over universals versus
particulars or essence over existence is the hallmark of many Western
philosophical theses. The nature of Greek language lent itself to abstract
thought more divorced from physical reality, thus these debates, centered
upon rhetorical truth, could likewise be divorced from any mandate for
living. In fact, the Platonic ideal for the philosopher was epitomized in
his myth of the Cave.

The Chinese language, being character based, derived the characters’
images from physical reality and the Chinese philosophers were thus
constantly reminded of the connection to the world and society. Chinese
thought never separated the sensible world from the spiritual, earth from
heaven. Chinese thinkers saw in the changes of physical nature the
permanent feature of existence: change. These philosophers did not
retreat from change to seek an underlying permanency: they embraced it
as a fact of being, and a manner of knowing. The lack of terminological
clarity in their writings was a reflection of the lack of conceptual clarity
they knew could be attributed to any permanent delineation of existence.
More than this, each character contained a physical and abstract referent;
meaning is pluralistic. In part this was due to the fact that early Chinese
thinkers did not have the interest in logical debates in the same way as we
see in the Greeks, and realized that human understanding is limited by
language.

We also find arguments that assert an opposite viewpoint to Cheng’s,
however, and warrant our attention. Even though his view is one that was
widely held, there exist views to counter this understanding and seem to
be warranted. Significant here is a comment by A.C. Graham in his work,
Unreason within Reason,22 where mention is made of this “fallacy.”
While it is true that the phonetic script contains less a concrete referent,
and the Chinese characters present a composite (concrete and
psychological) referent, the reason lies not in script, but in philosophical
orientation. The practically-minded Confucian tradition was based upon
knowledge as being empirically oriented and scholarly. “The nature of
this knowledge was not theoretical and abstract, but concrete and
factual.”23 Hansen likewise asserts that while western language is
construed “as descriptive or representative, Chinese theory treats the
function of language as socializing, regulating, and co-ordinating
behavior.”24 If Cheng’s contention were true, then we should expect to not
see the presence of abstract metaphysical thought within Chinese
philosophy, but this is clearly not the case. If we just consider two of the
Classics, the Doctrine o f the Mean (zhongyong:               anc* the Great
Learning (daxue:                     both attributed to the Qin or early Handynasty
(222 BC - 220 AD) it is clearly seen that while the latter is concerned
with social and political issues, the former is more focused on psychology
and metaphysics, or as Wing-tsit Chan expresses, it is “religious and
mystical.”25 Furthermore, the Neo-Taoist tradition that began in the third
century AD, perhaps due to the chaos and turmoil in the Wei Dynasty
(220-265 AD), shows us much abstract thinking and flights from the “real
world” of fact. The introduction and translation of Buddhism into
Chinese culture never reduced its abstractions, and its impact on the
Confucians and Taoists prompted these systems to speculate more
metaphysically. Perhaps we can safely assert that the Analects of the
Confucian canon reveals little abstract use of language, but the Doctrine
of the Mean and later Neo-Confucian thought assuredly do, as do Taoism
and Buddhism.

The difference between Greek and Chinese language systems, then, is that
they both used words and different styles of logic, but for different
purposes. Its application is what matters most, and the systematic manner
in which it is applied.

The sophist thinker Hui Shi (380-305 BC?), friend of Zhuangzi, attempted
to attain understanding of the great One by the use of logic and rational
knowledge, but the former was opposed to Kung-sun Lung (b. 380 BC?)
another thinker who attempted to use logic as well. Hui Shi saw all things
as relative and constantly changing, while Kung-sun Lung taught that they
were absolute and permanent. Wing-tsit Chan asserts that this trend
towards logical and rational understanding did not catch hold in China due
to the disinterestedness of the philosophers in the science of logic as well
as the political upheaval during this time. “Moreover, the common
emphasis of the major schools on solving human problems, as well as the
attempts of some thinkers to strive for social reform, made the Logicians
look like idle debaters.”26 This trend towards logic, began by Mozi (Mo-
tzu), founder of Mohism, and carried on by the “Logicians,” failed to
capture an arena because it failed to win the people’s hearts.

Schwartz presents a good discussion of the similarities and differences
between Greek and Chinese philosophers.27 First, the Greeks wanted
stability; the Chinese witnessed flux. Greek thought focused on the divide
between these realms, Chinese thought strove for harmony and integrity.
Chinese philosophy arose within the context of politics and ethics, not
merely the “rectification of names” by describing particular functions or
causes of things. While it is also true that Greek thinkers conceived of the
ideal social and political order, it was projected into a mythical future;
Chinese thinkers looked to their past in the Xia or Zhou Dynasties as their
model. Even when the Chinese thinkers spoke of some standard of cause
or behavior, the locus was Tian ( ^ : often translated as “Heaven,” though
better left untranslated) not the transcendental realm of pure form we find
in Greek thought, but an embodied principle that is reflected in the sage-
kings’ lives, and eventually accessible to all. Tao is not a transcendent
force, but an immanent field of reference; it is the Way and the path upon
which one walks.

Second, Greek thought and its Western inheritors construed the role of.the
spiritually-minded philosopher and mystic to be aloof from society, to be
unconcerned with its unfolding, and to remain detached from its needs.
Plato’s “Cave Allegory” provides the best example of the philosopher’s
perceived role. Chinese philosophers, even of the Taoist school, viewed
humanity as being intimately connected with “Tian,” Earth and all of
humanity, and realized that the individual is a social being. This implies
that one fulfil one’s “experience of the cultivation of one’s nature toward
the fulfilment of oneself and others in society” which is the principle of
ethical fulfilment.28 Greek civilization sought the elevation and isolation
of the individual, the “Alone with the Alone” of Neoplatonism, while
Chinese civilization and thought never lost the immediacy of
relationships, social and cosmic. For the Confucian school, the scholar,
who was in service of the bureaucracy, strove to integrate his inner moral
character with his impact upon the social order. In fact, the bureaucratic
system in China was, in theory, created for this very purpose. It is true
that certain aspects of Taoism, such as what was seen in Neo-Taoism,
proposed isolation over social ties; however, these views never dominated
in the same way as Confucian ideology. We do know that in the Early
and Late Han dynasties, the upsurge in Buddhist monasteries contributed
to this social withdrawal and breaking of family ties and presented a
challenge to the Chinese filial system.

Third, epistemology, the theory of knowledge, differs. Greek thought
construed a view that thought and idea were the same, and equated
thinking with being. It mattered not if thought and being—that is, lived
being—were identical; it was enough that thought and idea were. The
great quest was ontology, which produces different results depending
upon the ascribed nature of being. There existed realms of being superior
to this human realm, and in one of these realms, there existed the
archetypes, the Platonic eidos, the ideas. These archetypes, such as Love,
Truth, Beauty, Justice, etc., were observed in the world, but originated in
a realm far beyond it. The value lay not necessarily in embodying these,
but in contemplating them detached from all concern for this world. The
cosmological order established these patterns and the philosopher or
mystic experienced them. This has, of course, created many problems for

Cheng, op. cit., p. 180.

philosophical thought and western civilization that has never been
reconciled. The unity that was conceived to exist in reality was not
perceived in the world, but in abstractions; the world could provide no
certain truths. These Greek philosophical discussions greatly influenced
Christian and Islamic doctrines.

Chinese thought witnessed principles (//: B§) in nature, including human
nature, and believed that an individual must strive to apply these into daily
life for them to have real personal value. The one who embodies
humanity/benevolence (ren: fH) becomes the noble person (jun zi:
The practical was fused with the cosmological and gave rise to the
theoretical. Knowledge was based upon this practicality and concerned
itself with life as lived, no matter how abstract thought became. Thought
and action were wedded, and derived from “investigation into the nature
of things” in the natural world, not the higher spheres of thought. “In
Chinese philosophy, man not only develops a holistic outlook on the
universe and man in the universe, but comes to see the dynamic unity of
all things and experience the dynamic source of all things.”29 The
epistemology that develops out of this conception embodies the intention
of the individual. “Whenever man has to learn to know the world by his
actual engagement with the world in his conduct and action, at the same
time he has to learn to act according to his knowledge of the world.”30
This implies that one becomes one’s thought, in the fullest implications.

This discussion could be lengthened, but hopefully it suffices. It needs
commenting here that we are looking at the roots of systems of thought,
and not whole philosophical systems. It is noticeable that in Bahá'í
thought, both lines of speculation can be found. The dominant view,
however, is on the integration of thought and being; in order to help
transform*another, one must be transformed first.

To speak of a non-metaphysical metaphysics may seem to be mere
academic or philosophical word play. It is far from it, however. It is first
and foremost practical and embodied. If we peruse this further, extending
it to large cosmological views, we must face the concept of the Deity; call
It God in whatever language and it still remains our concept. Western

religious thought, from the time of the Zoroastrian Religion (about 600
BC) also contended with a personification of an opposing force, Ahriman,
Satan, Iblis; call it what we will, it still remains our concept. Chinese
thought never witnessed such a split in its metaphysics, as the dark Yin
force requires the light Yang force for essential balance. Dark and light
were not opposites, but polar necessities. This world never became the
domain of darkness with humans as pawns in a great cosmic drama.
Bahá'u'lláh says little about this notion, other than to have us realize there
is no such demonic entity: it is a symbol for the darkness that exists as a
result of humanity’s own misdeeds. We can never know light if we do not
know darkness.

Taoism speaks much of the Unknowable that is termed Tao. It asserts that
it is unnameable, yet offers various descriptions in the famous Tao de
Jing. In Taoism, the Zhuangzi presents views of metaphysics which are
conceived as a dynamic process, not a stable or fixed spiritual reality
underlying existence. The Tao “is the formlessness which forms the
form.”31 Spirit is not conceived to be something transcendental, for there
is no separate metaphysical realm. The notion of interconnection, the
absence of separateness, is characteristic of Taoist thought. Language
cannot adequately express Reality, and the Taoists realized this early on.
Words cannot convey Tao, and the limits of language are vociferously
expressed.

The Confucian school, on the other hand, never asserts that the Tao is
unnameable, but offers no definite description. From the Confucian
tradition, Tao can be seen thusly:

1. The Tao is immanent in human history, culture and human practice;
> thus the Tao is both transcendent and immanent.
> 2. The Tao expresses itself in moral principles that we abide by, in
> rites and institutions within which we operate; thus, the Tao is the
universal that is embodied in the particular.

3. The Tao is embodied in the ways of the ancient sage kings or
present good rulers and princes, etc.; thus, the Tao is the universal that

evolves historically.

Philosophy, p. 10.

4, BaháT contributions to metaphysics and epistemology

If we briefly examine the Bahá’í position on the nature of philosophy, we
will see a similar vibrancy as witnessed in Chinese thought. Even though
Arabic and Persian, the two dominant languages of Bahá’u'lláh’s writings
are very amenable to abstraction, and in spite of the presence in his
writings of names and phrases that are numerologically nuanced,
BaháVlláh himself focuses our attention on the living world, while
enjoining us to integrate the abstract and concrete. He constantly enjoins
us to study those branches of knowledge that do not “begin with words
and end with words” 33 but contribute to the advancement of civilizations
and peoples. Even though BaháVlláh lived in a culture and spoke to an
audience that was steeped in abstruse and obtuse metaphysics, he
overturned this tendency and focused upon the rehabilitation of culture as
the fairest fruit of religious thought. His concern was to bring unity to a
world that was languishing because of divisions. The greatest of divisions
that distressed his being was that of religious intolerance.

One of the fundamental purposes of this intolerance was the belief in the
finality of religious truth. Adherents of the Abrahamic religions typically
believed that their religion was the only correct religion, the others being
false or incomplete.34 Here we see the philosophical notion of permanence
operating on and in western religious understanding. Contrariwise, Bahá'í
thought presents us with certain essential principles: one is the constancy

32 Chen, Xunwu, “A Hermeneutical Reading o f Confucianism,” in Journal o f Chinese
Philosophy, vol. 27:1, p. 106. It is important to note that this rendering by Chen is a
contemporary or “third wave” o f Confucian hermeneutics.
33 Sec, e.g. Kitab-i-Aqdas, Epistle to the Son o f the Wolf where this is mentioned, referring
to metaphysical hair splittings.
34 It is worth noting here that Chinese religious systems never developed this insular view,
and Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism often vied together and were blended together.
Wing-tsit Chan discusses this in his article “The Historic Chinese Contribution to
Religious Pluralism and World Community,” in E. J. Jurgi, ed. Religious Pluralism and
World Community, pp. 1 13-130.

of the Divinity in sending Messengers to guide humanity. Seen in this
light there is no difference between any of the Prophets, they all speak the
same Message, though the language and ideas may differ to suit the times
and needs of the times in which they appear. They can be “regarded as
one soul and the same person.”35 From a different perspective, “the
principle of change is vindicated”36 inasmuch as we notice change upon
the earth, within the realm of thoughts and ideas, knowledge and
ignorance, as well as change among the names, birth places, and themes
of and expressed by each Prophet. It is unique to Bahá'í doctrine, among
the Semitic religious traditions, to espouse the essential principles of
permanency as well as change. In this manner, we may notice the bridging
of Eastern and Western philosophical thought; Greek blending with
Chinese in a harmony that transcends both.

Bahá'i philosophy and epistemology can be seen to be a gnosis, but not in
the manner of gnosticism. It is a gnosis that is intimately integrated with
transformation. In order to know, one must become. Of the truths
embedded within Revelation we are told, “some can be disclosed only to
the extent of the capacity of the repositories of the light of Our
knowledge” which is a relative and progressive comprehension.37 To
know, one must be engaged in transformation. This is so because
philosophy, the “love of wisdom,” is a receptive sort of undertaking as
well as active. “Sophia,” translated as “wisdom,” is feminine. It takes a
receptive stance to realize that there are limits to rationality, it demands an
openness to intuition, a realization that in order to learn, we must immerse
ourselves in Revelation in order to “unravel its secrets, and discover all
the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths.”38 To understand we must
be willing to “stand under” in a receptive mode of being. This wisdom has
its limits; it revolves around the knowledge of the hidden dimension of
our being, a sign of God, we are told. This “inner” dimension is a
reflection of the divine.

Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'1-Bahá provide for us a directive regarding this
search for understanding the Unknowable Reality underlying and
informing creation:

Not only do we discover that the knowledge of this Únknowable Reality is
unattainable, but we also must humble ourselves before the profound
realization that the Reality which is “within” us is beyond our
comprehension. The Deity as proffered by Bahá'í thought is said to be
transcendent in its Essence, but immanent in its manifestation; we are
unable to say anything about Its true nature. In fact, Bahá'u'lláh asserts that
It is “exalted beyond all proximity and remoteness.”41 Our language cannot
adequately express this Reality, and whatever we may say is not about this
Reality, bul our limited and finite understanding. We do find passages that
indicate immanence, such as, “Within every blade of grass are enshrined
the mysteries of an inscrutable Wisdom...”42 and an injunction to turn our
sight to ourselves and find the Divinity “standing within thee.”43 Likewise
we find passages indicative of transcendence. It seems clear from searching
the Bahá'í Writings that we can neither assert nor deny absolute
immanence or transcendence: these are our concepts, and the Reality they
attempt <o delimit is beyond our conceptual word plays. The limits of
language is a certain proposition of Bahá'í thought. One fact is certain,
however. The Deity as presented in the Bahá'í Scriptures is personal
through the intermediary of the Manifestation.

Another perspective that Kongzi realized centuries ago is echoed in the
Bahá'í corpus. As Kongzi expressed, “Before you have learned to serve
human beings, how can you serve spirits?”44 We find this echoed in Chán
thought as well. Concomitantly Bahá'u'lláh informs us that instead of
pondering upon this Unknowable Reality we should instead “Be anxiously
concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and center your
deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.”45

Epistemologically, the Bahá'í religion imposes, upon us a standard of
knowledge that honors the fullness of the embodied human. 'Abdu'1-Bahá
gives us the criteria humans have at our disposal to understand truth that
are our foundation of epistemology: 1) sense perception; 2) rationality,
reason; 3) tradition; and 4) inspiration.         Individually applied, the
conclusions arrived at are faulty, as clearly demonstrated through history.
However, “a statement presented to the mind accompanied by proofs
which the senses can perceive to be correct, which the faculty of reason
can accept, which is in accord with traditional authority and sanctioned by
the promptings of the heart, can be adjudged and relied upon as perfectly
correct, for it has been proved and tested by all the standards of judgment
and found to be complete. When we apply but one test, there are
possibilities of mistake. This is self-evident and manifest.”46

This epistemic foundation demands the integration of methods; those
which are exclusively rational and those which are construed to be
^rational. The western reliance upon reason, a characteristic harkening
back to the Greek roots, re-expressed in the Renaissance with its
humanistic overtones (in part impacted by the resurgence of Aristotelian
philosophy), and the so-called Enlightenment, is counter-balanced in
BaháVlláUs world view. It is intriguing to note that Bahá'u'lláh lived
merely half a century after the end of the Enlightenment. Reason has
limits. It is important that we notice the counter-tendency appearing in
the Islamic milieu that Bahá'u'lláh appeared within: the hailing of

imagination as a non-corrigible epistemological basis.47 Never before in
religious history had a prophetic figure to contend with and respond to
two such highly developed philosophical systems, differing in that in one
system, reason was stressed, and in the other, imagination. In fact, the
traditions that Bahá’u’lláh dialogued with can be seen clearly in his
writings. It is telling to note here that Chinese thinkers were averse to
placing emphasis upon imagination and, in meditative techniques,
encouraged the contemplator to keep the eyes opened slightly, focusing
upon the “one square inch” as we find in Taoism and Chan Buddhism.
This technique has many purposes, but one is exclusively to prevent the
initiate from becoming lost in the images presenting themselves, or which
one may construe to be reality.48

’Abdu'1-Bahá provides a perspective for our consideration that may have
resonance with Chinese understanding, but requires more investigation to
ascertain. We read: “The other kind of spiritual discoveries is made up of
pure imaginations, but these imaginations become embodied in such a
way that many simple-hearted people believe that they have a reality.
That which proves it clearly is that from this controlling of spirits no
result or fruit has ever been produced. No, they are but narratives and
stones.”49 To delineate why and how this is so has been the thrust of much
of my research and writing; to correlate it with Chinese thought remains a
current and future endeavor. To integrate the fourfold approaches or
criteria of truth, provides us with an epistemological thrust that has not
been clearly articulated or delineated before.

Having expressed these fundamental points, we must pursue further to see
if there is a metaphysic that BaháVlláh brings for our consideration. We
surely note the continuation of certain terms and views that held
dominance in the Islamic world, however, if we search deeper, we notice
a thrust towards an embodied metaphysics as well, more profound.

47 This trend was initiated in early Islamic thought, carried to its pinnacle in Sufism,
specifically Ishraqi Sufism, whose prime motivators were Suhrawardi, Ibn Arabi, and
their lineage.
48 This is demonstrated in The Secret o f the Golden Flower, trans, by R. Wilhelm,
commented upon by Carl Jung, pp. 34-35. It is noteworthy that this work has been
retranslated by T. Cleary and been challenged in its interpretation and commentary thereto.
See Cleary, T. The Secret o f the Golden Flower.

Bahá’u'lláh speaks of various worlds, such as the World of Creation, the
World of Command, that is, the World of the Manifestations, and the
World of God. This is symbolized clearly in the Bahá'í talisman of the
“Greatest Name” referred to commonly as the “ringstone symbol.” This
emblem was designed by 'Abdu'1-Bahá. We find it worn as a ring stone or
pendant among many BaháVs. This design enables us to see dramatically
and simply that the World of Creation is connected to the World of God
through the link of the Manifestation. The Prophet, or Manifestation, is
that Divine Being who is the Mouthpiece of the Unknown Essence we
humans refer to as God.50

The purpose here is to simply mention this, not develop it. Such
mentioning will enable us to appreciate how it is that the Bahá'í stance is
so focused on “living the life,” that is, embodiment, as the fruit of belief,
in the same way the world is the fruit of the spirit.51 Bahd'u'Mh does not
present a coherent theory of metaphysics, nor does 'Abdu'1-Bahá; what
They focus on more is the transformation of the heart, character and
ultimately, society. This position, so rooted in the world as lived,
acknowledges the interconnection of the spiritual world and the human
world. Religion is even defined as “the essential connection which
proceeds from the realities of things.”52 Connections are relationships.
’Abdu'1-Bahá clearly states: “I swear by the true Teacher that if ye will act
in accord with the admonitions of God, as revealed in His luminous
Tablets, this darksome dust will mirror forth the Kingdom of heaven, and
this nether world the realm of the All-Glorious.”53 Lest we think that this
Kingdom of Heaven refers to a transcendental realm, beyond the reach of
humanity, we are given to contemplate, as mentioned above that it “is
within this world.”54 The mission of the Prophets is not to speak of

50 There are references in Bahá'í works to a five-fold hierarchical cosmological schema as
found in Ishraqi thought. Some scholars think that the presence o f this terminology
affirms the cosmological views o f the Islamic theosophers, while others assert that it is
merely literary and customary usage, not an affirmation nor denial o f such metaphysical
speculations. The current writer views the issue according to the second viewpoint, and
has explored this in his previous works.
51 This view has a Zoroastrian heritage and was discussed in my work, Re-Visioning, Re-
Thinking, Re-Placing.

abstract and transcendent spiritual realms, but to enable us to embody
Their teachings and make of this Earth a spiritual world.

When we consider the fact of embodiment, I might be remiss to not
mention one vital aspect of Chinese thought that we find re-expressed in
Bahá’í philosophy. This vital link is that of correspondence between
different aspects of existence. The current forces of postmodernism see a
future beyond the current notions of fragmentation and alienation in
existence, and for a connection with the whole. As an effective
assistance, Bahá’í thought presents us with the dominance of ideas
indicating correspondence and inter-relationship. We find in a talk of
’Abdu l-Bahá’s an expression of this relationship: “The worlds of God are
in perfect harmony and correspondence one with another. Each world in
this limitless universe is, as it were, a mirror reflecting the history and
nature of all the rest. The physical universe is, likewise, in perfect
correspondence with the spiritual or divine realm. The world of matter is
an outer expression or facsimile of the inner kingdom of spirit. The world
of minds corresponds with the world of hearts.” 55 Likewise we read, “the
material world corresponds to the spiritual world.” The interconnection of
various levels of existence is also addressed in many modem theories
deriving from quantum mechanics and systems theory. We see this
clearly explicated in the ecological spheres, and in Bahá'í philosophy we
notice its extension to the cosmic. Bahá'u'lláh asserts that humanity
should be thought of not as the “lesser world,” but in fact as the “greater
world.” 56 The microcosm and macrocosm are in intimate relationship, as
are humanity and the environmental surroundings.

The correlative thought that characterizes Chinese cosmology is well
documented and expressed in literature. This mode of thinking began to
arise in the fourth and third centuries BC and reached its height in the
Former Han Dynasty of 200 BC to the first century AD. Benjamin

55 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Promulgation, p. 270; see also SAQ, p. 283. It would be remiss o f me to
not note that this correlative view dominated in many pre-scientific systems o f thought;
this scientific thought referred to is modern science, not that which predated this system,
and was developed in Europe. Modern science is particular to a western approach, and
currently is the mathematico-deductive system that began with Galileo and Bacon. Be that
as it may, the foundations o f correlative thought, especially the “action at a distance” so
popular within these systems, are still open to investigation and there are experiments that
indicate such features are empirically verifiable.
56 Bahá'u'lláh, Gleanings, p. 340.

Schwartz has termed this “correlative cosmology.”57 It is observed in the
School of Yin and Yang and described clearly in the doctrine of the
“Interrelation of Heaven and Man.” “It is a kind of anthropocosmology in
which entities, processes, and classes of phenomena found in nature
correspond to or ‘go together with’ various entities, processes, and classes
of phenomena in the human world.”58

We note that in the works of Dong Zhongshu (Tung Chung Shu), a minor
philosopher who lived from 179-104 BC, there is developed a doctrine
which saw the universe as an organic whole, and man as a microcosm.
With Nature the macrocosm and Humanity the microcosm, the dynamic
interplay observable in Nature was reflected in Humanity. Tian / Heaven
has its forces of yin and yang, the opposites of passive and active, etc.,
and Humanity likewise has its opposites of humanity, or benevolence
(ren), and greed. As Tian can restrict the operations of these two forces,
so can a person. From this, we are given to learn that Tian and Humanity
operate in a similar manner. On the personal level, humanity was viewed
to have inherent goodness, but potentially so. What was needed was
education to discipline this nature. “The activity of Heaven extends to a
certain point and then stops. What stops within the operation of Heaven is
called human nature endowed by Heaven, and what stops outside the
operation of Heaven is called human activity.”59 This dimension of human
endeavor needs to be trained, thus the king and the sage are set up to
provide the society in which these aspects can be cultivated. Dong
Zhongshu even went so far as to make a correspondence with Tian and the
physical body. We notice this also in Jewish and Islamic mystical
speculations, with the human mind resembling the spiritual intelligence of
heaven.

It would be interesting to pursue further this similarity, but space does not
permit. It is telling that 'Abdu'1-Bahá uses this correlational pattern within
a system that demands the harmony of science and religion. While
Chinese philosophy derived this correlative thinking from the natural
world and applied it to the spiritual or cosmic, the Bahá'í perspective is

57 Schwartz, B., op. cit., p. 350.
58 ibid., p. 351.
59 Wing-tsit Chan, op. cit., p. 275. This concept is reminiscent o f a work by P. D.
Ouspenski, The Psychology o f M an 's Possible Evolution, in which he asserts a similar
construct.

64             THE SINGAPORE BAHÁT STUDIES REVIEW

derived from the spiritual and is applied to the natural world. Perhaps
there is a dimension to this correlative thinking that humanity has not yet
fully explored and comprehended. The differences between these systems
must be pursued before we can assert a strong similarity. While Chinese
organismic thought is presented with existence and Nature as being self­
generated, in Bahá’í thought there is a Creative Force that operates within
the physical order, and there is a dimension of self-generation within this
created order.

5\. The Embodied Human

One fundamental hallmark of Western philosophy, at least as it pertains to
living a life concerned with the spirit, is its ascetic nature. The
philosophical heritage that the earth is a prison of the soul, that humanity
“fell” from the heights of spirit, or from God’s grace, to the mortal world
deeply influenced Western philosophy.60 Asceticism, monasticism, and
various forms of self-renunciation became the way to salvation, the
manner of ascent. The body was often looked upon as a burden to be
gotten rid of and a hindrance to spirit. Emphasis was on spirit to the
detriment of body. The lack of concern for the physical nature showed its
impact on lack of concern for the body. Life was not about embodying
spirit, it was about fleeing from the flesh. We witness the psychological
counterbalance of this early tendency, beginning in the Renaissance and
with humanism, with the dominating views of humanistic pleasure and
materialistic empiricism. Asceticism often is counterposed by hedonism.

Chinese people have been characterized as being realistic in the sense of
philosophy and life. Lin Yutang expresses this clearly in his work The
Importance o f Living. In one section where he is comparing Chinese and
Western views of living he states,

> “This over-emphasis on the spirit was fatal. It made us war with our
> natural instincts and my chief criticism is that it made a whole rounded
> vie'w of human nature impossible. It proceeded also from an
> inadequate knowledge of biology and psychology, and of the places of
> the senses, emotions and, above all, instincts in our life. Man is made

> of flesh and spirit both, and it should be philosophy’s business to see
> that the mind and body live harmoniously together, that there .be a
> reconciliation between the two.” 61

Yutang’s position is clearly correct. In part the lack of inclusive thinking
was due to the abstract language used in Western philosophy, in part due
to developmental stages of thought. (It is important to note, however, that
in some aspects of Islamic philosophy, the body was viewed to be the
temple of the spirit and one was to strive to embody the highest virtues of
spirit.) This absence, of course, can be attributed to the stage of thought
that was dominant at an earlier phase of human evolution, a stage that was
not as integrative but tended towards differentiation of functions.

It is very apparent that this last position is similar to that found in Chinese
thought. The Chinese thought regarding the threefold integration of
Humanity, Earth and Tian, as well as the emphasis on becoming a junzi
(H A ), a noble person, is where we find means of establishing further
dialogue. “For Confucius, the junzi is a qualitative term denoting
someone who has an ongoing commitment to personal growth...”62
Further, “The junzi is what he says, and where he is exemplary, the world
is as he speaks it....The Confucian model of personal realization does not
permit distinctions between ethics and politics, between personal and
social, between the private and public.” 63 Through the terms xin (fff),
“living up to one’s word,”—composed of the characters ren (A) “person”
and yan (JJ) “to speak”—and cheng                 which means “sincerity” or
“integrity,” one strives to become zhenren (HA)- Zhuangzi defines zhen
as “the highest degree of purity and integrity.”64 Zhenren can also be
defined as a genuine person, one whose words and deeds are integrated.

Speaking to a group in Paris, France, 'Abdďl-Bahá spoke about the reality
of the human. He stated that our reality is our thought, and that thought
and action must be so wedded because “the power of a thought is

spiritual philosopher in these words: “His thought is himself.”65 In
another context, the Guardian of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi states
emphatically that:

> “One thing and only one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the
> undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely, the extent to which
> our own inner life and private character mirror forth in their manifold
> aspects the splendor of those eternal principles proclaimed by
> Baha'u'llah.”66

If we do not know the history of such a profound thought, this presents us
with a challenge that shakes our foundations and demands action. Here we
find words spoken that resonate with the deepest components of being.
We find in the Chinese civilization an injunction so similar that it is
uncanny. In the Doctrine of the Mean, the Zhongyong, we read:

> “What Heaven has endowed is called the nature. Following the nature
> is called the Way. Cultivating the Way is called instruction. The Way
> cannot be departed from for so much as an instant. If it were possible
> to depart from it, it would not be the Way. Therefore the noble person
> is cautious and watchful about what is unseen and fearful and
> apprehensive about what is unheard. There is nothing more visible
> than what is hidden, nothing more apparent than what is minute.

Therefore the noble person is watchful over himself while alone.” 67

Another version reads a bit differently in translation and focuses our
thought more coherently. The beginning sentences are the same:

> “One cannot depart from his way for an instant, what can be departed
> is nota way. A man of moral integrity is always discreet and vigilant
> when he is beyond others’ sight, apprehensive and cautious when
> beyond others’ hearing. One should never misbehave even when he is
> in privacy, nor should he reveal evil intentions even in trivial matters.

So a moral person remains circumspect especially when he is alone.”68

Furthermore, the “unity of knowledge and action,” a long and pivotal idea
of Confucianism, reached its pinnacle expression in Wang Yang-Ming’s
dynamic idealism (1472-1529). To Yang-Ming, sincerity of will must
precede the investigation of things, and “knowledge is the beginning of
action and action the completion of knowledge.”69 For the one who
knows, the two are integrated; one who is not integrated does not know.

It is important to keep in mind the passage from Bahá'u'lláh cited in the
opening of this article, that this Revelation presents “for the purpose of
ennobling the world of being and of elevating the minds and souls of
men” that which is the most perfect expression of such a process.
Therefore it should come as no surprise that we find such similarity. The
education of the whole human race is what has been undertaken. The
Chinese civilization and its sages and philosophers strove to embody
virtues that would maintain the balance between the cosmos and
humanity, between Heaven and Earth. This relationship was central to
their understanding. That it should find its restatement in this new
Revelation is not surprising. Chinese civilization attained great heights
and great insights. A dialogue with Western and a developing Bahá'í
civilization offers great potential.

6\. World Civilization

We have already looked at the areas for future dialogue regarding the
cosmic, or heavenly, aspect, and the human component. If we discuss a
bit about the earthly component, we will have completed the traditional
trilogy found in Chinese civilization. Indeed, the thrust of Chinese
philosophical thought, as well as Bahá'í religious thought, is
transformation of the world and civilization. The interconnection of the
earth, the environment and society is so integrated that Shoghi Effendi
was prompted to remark:

> “We cannot segregate the human heart from the environment outside
> us and say that once one of these is reformed everything will be
> improved. Man is organic with the world. His inner life moulds the
> environment and is itself deeply affected by it. The one acts upon the

Wing-tsit Chan, op. cit., p. 656.

> other and every abiding change in the life of man is the result of these
> mutual reactions.”70

If we look on the dimension of this passage regarding the oneness of
humanity with the world, but focus on the human element, we do so with
the background of how this harmony of humanity will eventuate the
rebalance of the world’s equilibrium.

It has already been mentioned that one of the central principles of the
Bahá'í Faith is the attainment of the stage initiating the maturity of the
human race. Fused with this position is another essential principle: the
oneness of the world of humanity. This thought, part and parcel of our
daily dialogues now, was unique when it was spoken in the 19th century.
Yet its roots were so deeply gripped into the human psyche and heart that
when it was broached it heralded new opportunities, transitions and
potentials.

BaháVlláh spoke emphatically about the oneness of mankind, the fact that
we all live on one planet, are nourished by one interconnected ecological
system, and created by one Creative Source. When he was a prisoner of
the dynasties in Iran, Iraq and Turkey, from 1852-1892, he loudly
proclaimed this call at a time when industrialist, separatist and nationalist
tendencies were on the rise. Race, nationality, creed or religion cannot
sever this fundamental unity. He has made it the central feature of the
religion established in his Name: “We, verily, have come to unite and
weld together all that dwell on earth.”71 This vital principle ushers us into
a new level of consciousness, one that is more and more permeating the
entire planet and its peoples.

This principle is so vital to Bahá’u’lláh’s claim that Shoghi Effendi
elaborated upon it in great detail in his writings. Among them we find
this:

> “Let there be no mistake. The principle of the Oneness of Mankind—
> the pivot round which all the teachings of Baha'u'llah revolve—is no

> more and no less than a solemn assertion that attainment to this final
> stage in this stupendous evolution is not only necessary but inevitable,
> that its realization is fast approaching, and that nothing short of a
> power that is bom of God can succeed in establishing it.” 72

This passage was cited in full because it proffers to us one of the clearest
insights into the audacious assertion of the Bahá'í Faith. Yes, this claim is

Shoghi Effendi, World Order o f Bahd'u’lldh, pp. 42-43.
70              THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ’Í STUDIES REVIEW

very bold, blatant and demands attention.                 It is fit for an extensive
dialogue, with serious implications.

It is also very clear that modem Chinese civilization and government is
working along these lines, striving to maintain peaceful relations with
other nations and build a system of inter-relationship that has heretofore
eluded it and the rest of humanity. This should not surprise us, either.

Embedded in the history of Chinese civilization, within the foundations of
Confucian thought, is the essential feature of filial piety. Honoring of
one’s parents is vital to the maintenance of civilization and thus the world.
Confucianism felt that this one area, the continuation of family ties and
the honoring of parents, was what made Taoist thought incomplete. The
isolationist practices, the aversion for social organizations could not, the
Confucianists maintained, honor filiality. The Confucian school could not
integrate filial piety with living in isolation from society. This doctrihe is
the center piece of the Doctrine of the Mean             as well as The Great
Learning             and of course the Classic o f Filial Piety (Xiaojing:

A Chinese Confucian scholar of the early 20th century commented
thusly on the implications of filial piety:

> “The family group underlies the whole fabric of society. Each smaller
> group is gathered up into a larger group, so that all trace their
> relationship to the prime ancestor....Therefore Tso Chuan says, ‘The
> way of men is to love one’s relatives. Because of love for relatives,
> ancestors are honored; honor for ancestors brings respect for distant
> relatives; respect for distant relatives brings a sense of kinship.’ This
> family concept constitutes the fundamental basis of political
> organization. When this conception is further strengthened by religious
> ideals,"its effect is the more vigorous....The logical result of such
> concepts is the recognition that all mankind is but one large family.’’73

The roots go deep, indeed. In fact we find in the Book of PoeUy, from a
time before the Lunyu {Analects) the foundation of this idea. In the Book
o f Filial Piety we read:

73 Liang Ch’i’ch’ao History o f Chinese Political Thought, cited in Jingpan, C , Confucius
as a Teacher, pp. 284-285.

> “Filial piety is the root of virtue and the origin of culture....To establish
> oneself and walk according to the right Way (Tao), in order to glorify
> one’s parents: this is the culmination of filial piety. Filial piety begins
> with serving one’s parents, leads to serving one’s king, and ends in
> establishing oneself...”74

If this were not enough to establish a foundation of dialogue with a
developing Bahá'í civilization, a brief mention of the Chinese word for
religion, jiao ($%), which is derived from the character for filial piety,
xiao ( # ) , plus a causative radical, will enable us to see more. So, the
word for religion, jiao, means to make filial in a deeper sense.

The publication China Critic writes:

> “Filial piety is the alpha and omega of his [Confucius’] ethics. It
> includes and logically presupposes every other virtue under heaven.
> Thus, honesty, justice, courage, self-control, modesty and loyalty, all
> come under the single rubric of devotion to parents.”75

Likewise, we find in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy Book of
Bahá'u'lláh, these words:

> “The fruits that best befit the tree of human life are trustworthiness and
> godliness, truthfulness and sincerity; but greater than all, after
> recognition of the unity of God, praised and glorified be He, is regard
> for the rights that are due to one's parents.” 76

The foundation of society is rooted in the family; the pivot of the Bahá'í
Faith is in the recognition of this essential oneness which is dependent
upon harmony within the family and with one’s parents. Second to the
recognition of the 'unity of God’ is that of giving due regard for parents, a
very central obligation, indeed.

To conclude this section, we must address the component of physical
Earth. It is very apparent that in Chinese civilization, the interconnection

75 cited in ibid., p. 278.
76 Bahá'u'lláh, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 139.

between humanity and Earth, between morality and environment, was
centrally recognized. In the concept of the “Mandate of Heaven” (“Tian
Ming"), ancient Chinese thought realized how vital it was for the kings
and people to live lives of morality and harmony. When the empires
failed in this compulsion, when a dynasty became morally lax and carnal
pleasures dominated, the Mandate determined that it was to be
overthrown. This was used, of course, for political legitimacy, but the
harmony and potential dialogue with Bahá’í thought is very apparent.
Humanity is organic with the world, and morality and godliness impact
the environment in direct ways that we have not yet discerned clearly.
When peace prevails in the world, when expenditures for armaments and
weapons of destruction are diverted into revitalizing societies and
assisting the peoples of the world, a new consciousness and manner of
being will embrace the world. Tensions that now exist between groups
and nations will, in the flowering of time, pass away and the long awaited
peace and harmony will prevail. This is the assertion of til ancient
thoughts, and the claim of the Bahá'í religion.

7\. Prospects for Future Dialogues

In this brief presentation, we have considered how the Chinese civilization
and the nascent Bahá’í civilization can establish a dialogue around various
areas of common concern. We have clearly seen similarities between
ideas from Chinese philosophy and Bahá'í teachings that enable us to
deepen this dialogue and pursue the transitions and potentialities inherent
within the human reality and social structures of civilization. We have
reflected upon the cosmic or heavenly component, as well as the human
and earthly components of dialogical possibilities. While this article
focused more on the Confucian school, some of the views are applicable
to the Taoist and Buddhist views. It remains for further investigation,
however, to explore a deeper analysis of these three thought systems as
they pertain to Chinese civilization as a composite entity, and to the
nascent Bahá’í civilization. For analysis, these three Chinese systems can
be separated, as long as we realize that by so doing we are considering the
parts. The intermingling of these three philosophies provided fertile
ground for much exchange and influence of ideas. In fact, it is clear that

the influence of Buddhism prompted the Neo-Confucians to begin more
metaphysical extrapolations.77

While we have examined briefly the roots of Chinese as well as Western
thought, we must not forget that present civilizations are built upon these
roots. The various changes that philosophers of each culture have
introduced, the fine tuning of ideas; all have their roots in these
foundations. While the civilizations that we inhabit today differ markedly
from these roots, the roots go deep. We are witnessing such change,
technological, economic, political and religious, that mandates we search
our roots to find what is valuable and enduring. From these, then, we
must prune that which has become dead and contributes to separation, and
foster those that nurture integration. The “third wave” of Confucian
scholars, using modem academic, philosophical, and hermeneutic
techniques, are beginning to examine the viability of Confucian thought
for contemporary society.

When one examines the Bahá'í Writings, the historical and psychological
roots that are presented and the ideas that are brought forth, clothed in a
new manner, may enable us to attain what was a vague and distant vision
in these older philosophies and civilizations. World unity has demands
that differ greatly from feudal or national unity. Again, in the Bahá'í
system, it takes a Divine Power to transform on a global scale and
implement new patterns of living.

There is need to express here what has so far been unexpressed. We find
in ’Abdu'l-Bahd’s thought a number of statements that warrant attention as
scholars begin to look closer at Chinese philosophical thought. Presented
here are two of these passages that impinge upon our awareness:

> “In short, all sections and parties have their aspirations realized in the
> teachings of Baha'u'llah. As these teachings are declared in churches,
> in mosques and in other places of worship, whether those of the
> followers of Buddha or of Confucius, in political circles or amongst
> materialists, all shall bear witness that these teachings bestow a fresh

\[77\] For a succinct overview o f Buddhism in China, see deBary, op. cit.
74             THE SINGAPORE BAHA’I STUDIES REVIEW

> life upon mankind and constitute the immediate remedy for all the ills
> of social life.” 78

> “Confucius became the cause of civilization, advancement and
> prosperity for the people of China. Now it is not the time when we
> discuss concerning the stations and positions of those who are passed
> away. We must concentrate our attention upon the present. What hath
> transpired in a former time is past. Now is the time when we restrict
> our discussion to the Most Great Luminary of Peace and Salvation in
> this Age, to talk of the Blessed Perfection [Bahá'u'lláh] and to voice
> His exhortations, behests and teachings.” 79

It seems that in these two selections we are given a manner of
approaching further dialogue. It is tempting to merely seek similarity of
concepts in religious and philosophical thoughts, especially as they
pertain to one dominant feature of Chinese and Bahá’í positions:
embodiment. So far much of the Bahá'í-Chinese dialogue has striven to
highlight points of commonality. This is always a healthy and necessary
way to enter any long term relationship. Within the context of this article,
this is the approach taken, while at the same time setting out some
dissimilar points.

I propose that the two passages above imply for us an approach that is
warranted and will contribute to further dialogue. This stance is one of
beginning to draw out the differences, while continuing to look at the
commonalities. In the second passage we are given a position to focus
“our attention upon the present.” In another work, we read, “Sciences of
former ages and philosophies of the past are useless today. Present
exigencies demand new methods of solution; world problems are without
precedent. Old ideas and modes of thought are fast becoming obsolete.”80
If we seek only common points, perhaps we will overlook the
discontinuities that are embedded within Bahá'í thought. We need to
explore more what old ideas and thoughts are obsolete, while mining
those that are enduring. And here there subsists an echo of Kongzi’s

78 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Tablet to August Forel, pp. 26-27
79 ' Abdu'1-Bahá, Tablets of'Abdu'1-Bahá Abbas, vol. 2, pp. 469-70
80 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Promulgation, p. 140

personal position and practice, “A man who reviews the old so as to find
out the new is qualified to teach others.” 81

While we must seek common ground, we need to not seek only for this. I
am here reminded of the Jesuit entrance to China under the personage of
Mateo Ricci, who, from 1583 until his death in 1610, taught the Jesuit
understanding of Christianity. In so doing, he adopted Chinese clothing,
language, customs and terminology. By so doing, he not only taught the
Chinese, he also, so some historians assert, failed to differentiate the
Christian faith enough from Confucianism, so that many were left
wondering what he offered that Kongzi did not. One such historian writes
about it this way:

> “One Christian assumption, then, has been that any particular cultural
> wrapping can cover the core of universal truth. Yet, this assumption,
> which should have precluded any Chinese emotional need to balk at
> Christian foreignness, was but a net to catch the wind. It was meant to
> persuade a Chinese that the truth belonged to everyone, but the
> assumption could simply confirm the Chinese in his predisposition to
> see truth in what belonged to him. Thus, the early Jesuits in China, in
> their fear, for their religion, of its fatal indictment as a western, passing
> thing, hopefully expressed it as a sort of ‘perennial philosophy.’ Its
> truths were supposed to be evident even in the Chinese Classics, if the
> Chinese would only look. Revelation, the emphasis on what is sui
> generis to the religion, was deliberately shadowed in mysticism, in the
> insistence that truth is free of temporal, historical context. And this
> tactic, though bom of a sound instinct that some sort of tactic was
> necessary, was self-defeating...” 82

Of course with the new trends in Chinese thought and culture, there is no
concern of not demonstrating the foreignness of the Bahá'í religion while
likewise showing its universality. The trend towards anything foreign
makes this faith and social context different. The differences that exist
between Bahd'i and Chinese thought have been little explored yet, in part
because the dialogue is so new. The cultural openness in modem China
provides many more different opportunities than Ricci or others had.

76              THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

However, the other dramatic changes, more essential than the openness to
new ideas, warrant our attention as well.

It is well known that the failures of Maoist communism, acknowledged at
the highest governmental levels, has left a vacuum in Chinese spirituality.
More than this, it has bred a distrust of any utopian idealism; religion, as
historically presented, offers utopian ideals: universal brotherhood,
universal peace, collective security, the well-being of all humankind, etc.
It seems that if a Bahá'í-Chinese dialogue does not seriously contemplate
this element, this leeriness of any doctrine that sounds utopian, the
dialogue may not penetrate to the core of the debate.83 If it is true, as Jiwei
Ci expresses, that Confucianism provided a code of conduct and a code of
virtues to support it, but did not have a code of belief, it is this last aspect
that many are seeking to find.84 This is what the belief in communism
purported to offer and could not. It offered the possibility of a utopian
ideal that failed to materialize, and that left a nation searching for
meaning. However, the adage of “once bitten, twice shy” may apply to
the current Chinese situation. The thrust of much current Chinese
scholarship focuses on the religious dimension of Confucianism and
Taoism, and while this is surely valid in the sense used, it differs

83 While the recent incidents involving the Falun Gong Movement, labeled as a cult by the
Central Government, and widely discussed in the media of the West and East, may
indicate a continued repression and control of religious freedom in China, especially of an
organization that can easily mobilize millions of people, I assume the reasons are more
complicated. While it may be valid that any perceived threat to Party control is curtailed
for political reasons, to assert that this is the only reason in the case of Falun Gong is
simplistic. Freedom of expression needs limits, as the prevalence of anarchistic tendencies
in many western democracies blatantly indicate. It is a delicate balance, especially when a
transition is being made from feudalism-communism to a socialist-capitalist market
economy in a country of 1.3 billion people! The psychological reasons for the success of
the cult are clear to one who has investigated it. A question looms here: because the
western countries, America in particular, allow the rise and flourishing of cult movements,
and then the mass suicides that occur because of this “freedom,” does this prove that such
is the best way to handle such movements? Are there logical and reasonable limits to
freedom that must be seriously addressed in incidents like this? Indeed, we notice in both
Chinese and Bahá'í positions the great virtue of the “middle way” between extremes.
Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'1-Bahá express cogently that freedom needs limits. 'Abdu'1-Bahá
espouses freedom, but it is one that is “moderate.”
84 See footnote #7. It is also valid that the Confucian Dong Zhongshu elevated the
Confucian notion of Tian to a transcendent principle, but this never became the dominating
concept in Confucianism at the time.

markedly from a religion based on revelation.85 It is well documented that
many of the religious documents in the Taoist canon are considered to be
outright plagiarism of Buddhist texts.86 Likewise it is significant to note
that deBary and Bloom’s work refers, in the chapter titled “Daoist
Religion,” to the “Shangqing and Lingbao revelations,”87 but more
research needs to be undertaken to discern the implications and usage of
this term in its historical and contemporary contexts.

Added to these are the suspicions that arise when one dialogues about
“religion” or “revelation” from God. The dominant education in Marxist
ideology gives the common people different ideas about a Deity and
religious systems, and presents a challenge when confronting those faiths
that exist there. It would be unwise, it seems to my limited understanding,
to not acknowledge fully that belief in a Deity that governs and controls,
that has created and sustains physical existence, is not a widely held
conception in modem China, though we may find traces of it in the
syncretism of folk religion. There are many contemporary scholars,
Chinese and Western, who are taking great pains to argue that it has never
been part of Chinese thought; that Chinese humanistic religion is founded
upon human ingenuity and understanding, not divine revelation as
espoused in Bahá'í thought. Are the two systems reconcilable? In fact,
can humanistic religion be justifiably considered a belief system? And if
so, then we need to clarify in what ways it is, and how it differs from a
revealed religious system. The “grounds” of belief differ significantly.
There are many issues herein that are worthy of dialogue.

One voice that provides current discussion in this dialogue is Kow Mei
Kao. His previous article in the pages of this journal, “Chinese Religions:
Evolution, Compatibility and Adaptability,” provide us with an alternative
view to Ci’s.88 Kow expresses the presence of a belief system that
characterizes Confucianism in the Han period. He asserts that it presented

85 In a previous article, I argued that the notion o f religion that may be dominant may need
to be reconsidered in light o f the teachings o f the Bahá'í Faith’s views o f religion being the
“necessary relations that emanate from the reality o f all things” rather than ju st a doctrine.
This is true. However, we must integrate it with the fact o f revelation as source o f
religion. See my article, “Heaven in China without ‘Religion’ and Manifestation.”
86 For a good presentation o f this fact, see, e.g., Liu T s’un-Yan, Selected Papers from the
Hall o f Harmonious Wind.
87 op. cit., Sources o f Chinese Tradition, p. 393.

78              THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

a belief in Heaven with a personal god; a belief that mankind is the
noblest creature composed of the trinity of Heaven, Earth and humanity;
belief in the rewards or punishments in afterlife; belief that good deeds
done in this life accumulate favors from Heaven unto the earth in the
portends of nature; and belief in astrological forecasting.89 This presents
an interesting thesis, and one worthy of investigation. However, it might
indicate, as Kow himself proposes, that it represents the Han period of
Confucian ideology and not an enduring feature, as Ci’s stance seems to
indicate.

We cannot dialogue with the past, with texts of an ancient civilization,
divorced from people who express them or their applicability to
contemporary society. While the Chinese government openly discusses
“socialist spiritual civilization,”90 the understanding of such a term greatly
differs, from in the minds of the common people, to those at higher levels,
as well as from its historical referent. This should be openly
acknowledged. A dialogue about what “spiritual” means, both within
current and historical Chinese contexts, as well as the Bahá'í stance,
implies clarity about these matters. Words used differently provide
substantially different meanings; the terms used need to be clarified so
that dialogue may proceed smoothly, and each party grasp the meanings
as used.

A saying attributed to 'Abdu'1-Bahá indicates to us that the Bahá'í who
wants to teach the Chinese should, among other things, “know their sacred
literature, study their customs, and speak to them from their own
standpoint and using their own terminologies.”91 While this is an
attributed saying rather than a quotation, it does us well to contemplate it
deeply.

89 ibid., p. 66.
90 This term is commonly used in current Chinese thought, and can be found in President
Zhu Rongji’s report submitted to the National People’s Congress on the Outline o f the
Tenth Five Year Plan for National Economic and Social development (2001-2005).
91 This passage is found in many places. It is noteworthy that in the book about Martha
Root, Lioness at the Threshold, by M. Garis, p. 510, we find a footnote to this passage.
The note (#1) reads: “Since neither documentation nor an approved translation exists for
this passage, it cannot be considered authentic and must be regarded as ‘pilgrim’s
notes.’— Ed.” This traditional saying, in fact, perhaps the development o f a Bahá'í hadith,
reflects the spirit needed for those o f us engaged in Bahá'í-Chinese dialogue.

To know the Chinese sacred literature implies a knowledge (deep or
cursory depending upon the individual propensities) of: The I Ching
(H £r: Book o f Changes), Daxue                Great Learning), Zhongyong

Doctrine o f the Mean), Zhuangzi ( J E f c - p ) , Tao de Jing
Lunyu (i£i§: Analects), and other works from the Taoist and Buddhist
canons. To speak “from their own standpoint” implies that we know their
current standpoint, not merely the historical one that many are only
vaguely familiar with. It is vital, it seems to me, for one who would be a
teacher or scholar to grasp deeply the historical views and the
development of Chinese thought, so that s/he may relate an understanding
of terminologies that are now unused but lie at the roots of Chinese
consciousness. To show contemporary Chinese the beauty that resides in
the depth of their civilization’s sacred and philosophical roots is a sacred
undertaking. These roots are widely unknown but often referred to.
Many of my students know, when it is drawn on a blackboard, or seen on
a sign, what the sign of the Yin-yang (               or the bagua (Aíh) is>
have only the most vague idea what it means and its import for their
culture.92 This is a great service, it seems, to dialogue about and to
connect with the roots again.

Finally, to “use their own terminology” seems to imply that when we
speak of the Tao, or Tian, ren, or any other term, we know what it means
historically, in its many guises, and currently. Phyllis Chew’s work, The
Chinese Religion and the Bahd'i Faith, provides some preliminary
insights into these terms and their similarities with Bahá'í thought. To
pursue and deepen this is now the task in providing for a fuller dialogue.

Considered from a different angle, and from much personal experience, to
be able to cogently and intelligently discuss the assertion of “the harmony
of science and religion” implies to “use their own terminology” as well.
“Their” education and terminology is steeped in scientism, and to know
this, to respond to these features, recognizes their validity. To be able to
articulate in a scientific manner—that is systematically, clearly and with
strong logical evidence in support—enables many contemporary Chinese

to value their learning in science, and to integrate it with a system of
belief that supports it. We need, however, to clarify that this harmony
spoken of does not mean harmony with any assertion of science, but with
its principles, system of pursuing truth, and reasonableness. Modem
science is only one dimension of science. We must make a distinction
between the spiritof science and the scientistic, that is materialistic, views
that dominate it today. Discussion on this component holds much
potential as well.

It also seems prudent to mention herein the establishment in 1999 of the
Center of Bahá'í Studies (CBS) in association with the Pacific Rim
Institute for Development and Education (PRIDE), and The Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), Institute of World Religions, in
Beijing. This Center holds great potential for dialogue as well.

Further dialogue about Chinese and Bahá'í views of civilization will need
to focus upon these issues as well as upon the ethical, moral and
psychological implications of each culture as discussed in their sacred
texts. It will need, moreover, to be integrated with the scientific world
view that is demanded in the Bahá'í civilization being built. Much of
Chinese philosophy has been termed pre-scientific; it has even been
termed as non-philosophical compared to Western philosophy. However,
what is vital to grasp is that Western philosophy has been more
cognitively oriented, grappling with abstract ideas. Chinese philosophy,
on the other hand, has been described as more orientative, that is oriented
to the transformation of the individual and thus society. 93 This is the
purpose of true philosophy and religion, and the purpose of the Revelation
of Bahá'u'lláh.

As we glance around us at the world at large, at societies and civilizations,
at individuals and families, we observe the upheavals of great
convulsions. The establishment of a spiritual civilization is not an easy
task, and only the power bom of God, working through humanity in the
world, is capable of effectuating it; this is the claim of the Bahá'í Faith.
We can only do our small, albeit significant, part to make others aware.
In so doing, when the dialogue with the Chinese civilization is deepened,
we will observe ideas that may revolutionize the understanding that many

westerners have of it. Likewise, it is proposed that as the dialogue
progresses, so too, will humanity’s understanding of the Bahá'í Faith’s
contribution to civilization. It is without doubt an exciting venture to be
able to help establish some parameters for a dialogue with a civilization as
ancient as the Chinese and as burgeoning as that envisioned in the Bahá'i
Faith as delineated by Bahá'u'lláh, and his son 'Abdu'1-Bahá, “the
Architect of His World Order.” 94
