The Marja` al-Taqlid in Shi`i Jurisprudence

The Shi`i Islam practiced by the majority of Shi`is in the
world today is that of the Usuli school of Twelver (Ithna-
`Ashari) Shi`ism. According to this school, all believers are
divided into two groups. Those who have gone through a
lengthy course at a religious college (madrasah), have striven to
acquire the required learning, and have proven to the
satisfaction of an established mujtahid that they have the
reasoning power and knowledge needed to make their own

454                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

sound independent judgments on points of religious law (the
Shari`ah) are called mujtahids (literally, those who have strived).
Everyone who has not achieved this status and does not have a
certificate from an established mujtahid is called a muqallid
(literally those who follow the pattern or example set by
another); they are obliged to seek out a mujtahid and ask that
person regarding all points of the Sharí`ah. This mujtahid then
becomes that muqallid’s marj`a at-taqlíd (reference point to be
followed [in all matters of religious law]). This means that they
are the person to whom the muqallid turns for judgments on
such matters as religious obligations (prayer, fasting,
pilgrimage, etc.), business and social transactions and personal
law (marriage, death, inheritance, etc.). Indeed over the last 200
years, there are few areas of individual and social life that the
Shi`i mujtahids have not felt that they should enter. With
Khomeini's coming to power in 1979, even the field of political
power and national governance came under their orbit. At any
one time, the general consensus among the Shi`i religious
leadership raises a number of individuals to the rank of marj`a
at-taqlíd and the rest of the Shi`i world is expected to choose
one of them and to follow that person. Such persons are now
called Ayatu’llah al-`Uzma (often translated as Grand
Ayatollah).

The word taqlíd and muqallid both derive from the second
form of the root Q-L-D. According to Lane's Lexicon, this
form of the word means, in the first place, the hanging or
attiring of ornaments or signs upon the neck of an animal or a
person. From that it came to mean the investing or conferment
of an office upon someone. In religious matters, it came to
mean “investing with authority in matters of religion.” Thus the
verbal noun from this form of the verb, taqlíd came to mean “a
man's following another in that which he says or does, firmly
believing him to be right therein, without regard or
consideration of the proof, or evidence.”1

Since it is necessary for a devout believer to turn to a marja`
al-taqlíd for advice and guidance even in the ordinary actions of

Commentary by Ayatu’llah Khomeini                                    455

everyday life, it has become the practice among mujtahids who
want to become a marja` al-taqlíd to write manuals covering
most common aspects of everyday life (risálih-ye `amaliyyih).

Ever since the founding of the Usuli school by ‘Allamah al-
Hilli and even before that, this question of following (taqlíd) of
a mujtahid has always been somewhat tricky for the Shi`i
religious class. This is because there are several verses in the
Qur’an which forbid following the rulings of others in matters
of religion (Qur’an 33:67-8; 2:170, 5:104-5; 17:36; 21:52-4; 43:22-4). In
deriving its teaching on the matter of mujtahids and muqallids,
the clerics of the Usuli school have interpreted this prohibition
on following another person to refer only to the fundamental
tenets or doctrines of religion (ußúl al-dín). And so belief in
these fundamental doctrines must be the result of each
individual’s own independent investigation and must not be the
result of merely following one’s parents or religious leaders.
With regard to the practices of the religion (furú` al-dín,
subsidiary elements of the religion), the position of the Usuli
school of Twelver Shi`ism is that anyone who is not qualified to
be a mujtahid must follow the rulings of a mujtahid.

In arriving at this position that anyone who is not qualified
to be a mujtahid must follow the rulings of a mujtahid, Shi`i
scholars have used both reason and the Traditions of the
Imams. There is one ˙adíth (Tradition) in particular that the
Shi`i clerics have pointed to in putting forward evidence for
their position that anyone who is not qualified to be a mujtahid
must follow the rulings of a mujtahid. In the following, this
˙adíth is examined in some detail.

The Hadíth concerning Taqlid recorded by the
Eleventh Imam from the Sixth Imam

This important ˙adíth is recorded and commented upon by
almost every important Usuli Shi`i scholar of the last six
hundred years that has written about ijtihád and the concept
that the mujtahids are collectively are the general vicegerent (al-

456                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

ná'ib al-`amm) of the Hidden Imam and that all other Shi`is
must practice taqlíd of one of them.

This ˙adíth is cited in a controversial work, the commentary
attributed to the eleventh Imam Hasan al-‘Askari. Shi`i scholars
have been divided in their opinions as to whether this book is
genuine or a forgery. Among those prominent scholars who
have considered the work to be genuine are: Ibn Sháhrashub,
Mu˙aqqiq Karaki, al-Sháhid al-Thani, Fayd-i Kashani,
Mu˙ammad Baqir Majlisi, Vahid Bihbihani, Shaykh Murtada
Ansari and Ayatu’llah Burujirdi. Among those who have
doubted the authenticity of this book are: ‘Allamah al-Hilli and
Ayatu’llah Khu’i.

Apart from this commentary attributed to the eleventh
Imam, probably the earliest and most authoritative citing of the
˙adíth that we are considering here is in al-Ihtijáj of Ahmad ibn
‘Alí ibn Abí ˇálib al-ˇabarsí (or Tabrisi, of the late fifth/early
sixth Islamic century, late eleventh/early twelfth Gregorian
century). This may be the same individual who is buried in the
shrine of Shaykh ˇabarsí made famous by the siege of the Bábís
there in 1848-1849.2 It appears that the correct pronunciation
is Tabrisi, which is derived from Tabris, the Arabic form of
Tafrish, a small town south-west of Tehran. The Tradition is
from the Eleventh Imam Hasan al-`Askari and he is commenting
on a verse of the Qur'an in which it is written of the Jews:

> And some there are of them that are common folk not
> knowing the Book, but only fancies and mere
> conjectures. [Qur'an 2:77, Arberry translation]

In the text of this ˙adíth as recorded by al-ˇabarsí, Imam
Hasan al-`Askari cites a Tradition from the sixth Imam, Ja`far
aß-Íádiq:

> A man said to aß-Íádiq (AS): And if these Jews cannot
> understand the Book, they have no alternative except by
> means of what they hear from their scholars. So how can

> they be blamed for their following and accepting what
> their scholars tell them. And are the ordinary [illiterate]
> Jews any different from our ordinary [illiterate] people
> who follow their scholars?
> He [Imam aß-Íádiq] (AS) said: Between our ordinary
> people and our scholars and the ordinary people of the
> Jews and their scholars there is one difference and one
> similarity. With regard to the similarity, God blames our
> ordinary people for their following (taqlíd) of their
> scholars just as He blames their ordinary people. With
> regard to the difference He does not.
> He [the man] said]: Explain this to us, O descendant of
> the Apostle of God.
> He [Imam aß-Íádiq said] (AS): The ordinary Jews have
> realized that their scholars were quite obviously lying,
> they were eating what was forbidden and taking bribes,
> they altered their judgments on the basis of
> intercessions, bribes and patronage, they knew them to
> be partial in their judgments allowing their personal
> likes and prejudices to enter into their rulings and
> giving what rightfully belongs to one person to another.
> They knew in their hearts that a person who acts in this
> manner is corrupt and it is not permissible to follow
> them or to accept as being from God or from an
> intermediary of God what comes from their mouths.
> And their blameworthiness is on account of their
> following one whom they knew and understood that it
> was not permissible to accept what he said or to act on
> his advice. It is obligatory for them to guard themselves
> in the cause of the Apostle of God (SAWA) when the
> evidence is so clear that it cannot be concealed and so
> obvious that it does not need to be explained.
> Thus the ordinary Muslims when they know that their
> religious leaders are guilty of open corruption,
> prejudice, involvement with the dross of this world,

> favoritism towards their own however much they may
> be unrighteous, and turning a blind eye towards those
> who oppose them however much they may be in the
> right. If any ordinary Muslims follow such religious
> leaders, then they are like the Jews whom God has
> blamed for their following (taqlíd) of the corruption of
> their religious leaders. And as for whoever among the
> religious legal scholars (fuqahá) guards himself, defends
> his faith, opposes his passions and obeys the

> ordinary people to follow [or pattern themselves upon
> or emulate] him, and this applies to only some of the
> Shi`i religious legal scholars not all of them ...3

This Tradition is very long and goes on for another page
after this point, but what we have given is enough for our
purposes. The full Tradition is also given in a few other reliable
sources, such Wasa’il al-Shi`ah4 by al-Hurr al-`Amili, as well as
the Tafsir al-Burhan by Sayyid Hashim Muhaddith al-Bahrani (d.
1107AH)5 and the Bihar al-Anwar of Mu˙ammad Baqir Majlisi.6

However, when this Tradition is being cited by Usuli Shi`i
scholars discussing ijtihad, the division of the believers into
mujtahids and muqallids and the position of marj` at-taqlíd, it
is only one sentence of the long Tradition that interests them
and usually this is all they cite. That sentence is:

> whoever among the religious legal scholars guards
> himself, defends his faith, opposes his passions and
> obeys the commandments of his Lord, it is then
> incumbent upon the ordinary people to follow [or
> pattern themselves upon or emulate] him.

‫ﻓﺄﻣﺎ ﻣﻦ ﻛﺎن ﻣﻦ اﻟﻔﻘﮭﺎء ﺻﺎﺋﻨﺎ ً ﻟﻨﻔﺴﮫ ﺣﺎﻓﻈﺎ ً ﻟﺪﯾﻨﮫ ﻣﺨﺎﻟﻔﺎ ً ﻋﻠﻰ ھﻮاه ﻣﻄﯿﻌﺎ ً ﻷﻣﺮ‬

‫ﻣﻮﻻه ﻓﻠﻠﻌﻮام أن ﯾﻘﻠّﺪوه‬
The reason this sentence is so interesting for these scholars is
the last word that that sentence. The last phrase in the sentence

Commentary by Ayatu’llah Khomeini                               459

reads: fa li 'l-awwám an yaqalladunúhu. The importance of this
Tradition for the Usuli Shi`i scholars is in the word
yaqalladunúhu, which comes from the same second form of the
same root Q-L-D as the word taqlíd and muqallid as used
above. Thus the Usuli scholars argue that this Tradition is
imposing upon the ordinary Shi`is the obligation to practice
taqlíd of the mujtahids.

The importance of this ˙adíth is that, according to
Ayatu’llah al-Uzma Shaykh Ja`far Subhani, who is an important
contemporary teacher at Qumm, it is the only ˙adíth in which a
word from this root is used with a meaning that instructs the
Shi`is to emulate one of the `ulamá:

> If you were to say: “Is the term “taqlíd” mentioned as a
> subject [in any texts that can be used as an evidential
> source] for legal rulings, so that we should — before all
> else — exert an effort to determine its meaning?
> I would say: The term “taqlíd” only occurs in the text of
> the ˙adíth narrated in the tafsír attributed to Imam al-
> ’Askari where he relates on the authority of him [Imam
> Ja`far al-Sadiq] after some words concerning corrupt
> `ulamá: “And as for the religious legal scholars
> (fuqahá)….7

However, Subhani goes on to point out that Shaykh
Mu˙ammad al-Hurr al-`Amili, whose narration of this Tradition
he has used and who is a member of the opposing Akhbari
school of jurisprudence, states that this Tradition should not be
relied upon as it is “weak”, being a “khabar wáhid mursil” (a
tradition with only one chain of transmission), and he further
comments that in any case it does not give any authority to
ijtihad (exerting oneself to come to a legal ruling), ray’ (legal
opinion) and zann (legal conjecture) — these being elements of
the methodology of the Usuli school.8

Many other Usuli scholars have used this ˙adíth in their
discussion of taqlíd. For example, Shaykh Murtada al-Ansari,

460                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

the most prominent Shi`i cleric in the time of Bahá’u’lláh, uses
in it writing of the permissibility and necessity of following
(taqlíd) of a faqíh.9 It is also in connection with this question of
the permissibility of taqlíd that Khomeini uses this ˙adíth in
Tahdhib al-Usul, a record of his discussions with his senior
students (see below).

This ˙adíth has also been pulled into the discussions over the
doctrine of Viláyat-i Faqíh (Rule by the Religious Legal Scholar)
propounded by Ayatu’llah Khomeini. Sayyid ‘Abdu’l-Óusayn
Lari, who was a fiercely conservative cleric who came to power
in the region south of Shiraz during the turbulent period after
the Constitutional Revolution and instituted a persecution of
the Bahá’ís that resulted in the Third Nayriz Upheaval in 1909
with the death of 18 Bahá’ís, cites this ˙adíth as evidence for
the role of the cleric in political affairs. Recent publications
have even credited him with using the term “viláyát-i faqíh” in
his interpretation of this ˙adíth. In an article in the 14th volume
(2011-2012) of the periodical Political Sciences published by the
Office of Islamic Propagation of the Qumm Seminary, there is
an article by Akhtar Shahr ‘Alí with the title “Viláyát-i Faqíh
from the viewpoint of Sayyid ‘Abdu’l-Óusayn Lari,” in which
the author writes:

> Ayatu’llah Lari considers the “Viláyát-i Faqíh” to be the
> regulator of all affairs and for all laws, parliaments and
> consultative councils to be conditional upon it. For the
> removal of the obstacles to the implementation of the
> Divine laws that occurred during the Constitutional
> Revolution and as a counter to the deviation of the
> Constitutional Movement towards the West, he asserts
> that this principle [the viláyát-i-faqíh) is the guarantor
> overall for all intellectual and practical matters. He has
said:

> The overall guarantor and what brings together the
> intellectual and practical aspects of national affairs
> and removes active obstacles is the Vilayat-i Faqih,
Commentary by Ayatu’llah Khomeini                                461

> the weightiness of which we can understand from
> the valuable commentary of Imam Hasan ‘Askari:
> “And as for the religious legal scholars (fuqahá), he
> must guard himself ...”10

The author gives the reference for this quotation from Lari
as being the latter’s treatise: “Qanún-i Mashrutah-yi
Mashru`ah.” However, if one looks at this treatise as published
in 1374/1995 in a compilation of treatises about the
Constitutional Revolution, sixteen years before Akhtar Sháhr
‘Alí’s article, one finds this quotation but without any use of
the term “viláyát-i faqíh”:

> The overall guarantor and what brings together the
> intellectual and practical aspects of national affairs and
> removes (faqd) active obstacles are the words in the
> commentary of al-`Askari: “And as for the religious legal
> scholars (fuqahá), he must guard himself ...”11

That this should be case is no surprise to those who have
observed 35 years of forgery and deceit regarding the Bahá’í
Faith that appears to be the standard for scholarship in Iran
since the Islamic Revolution.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Interpretation of the Tradition
of the Sixth and Eleventh Imams

‘Abdu’l-Bahá also noted and took a great interest in this
same Tradition of the Sixth Imam recorded by the Eleventh
Imam. And furthermore he was interested in exactly the same
sentence in this long ˙adíth as the one that the Shi`i clerics
focused on.

In Secret of Divine Civilization, after writing about the
learned (`ulamá) who “walk the straight pathway and are versed
in the secrets of divine wisdom and informed of the inner
realities of the sacred Books; who wear in their hearts the jewel
of the fear of God, and whose luminous faces shine with the

462                                                        Lights of Irfán vol. 18

lights of salvation” and stating that these are “lamps of
guidance among the nations, and stars of good fortune shining
from the horizons of humankind … [the] fountains of life for
such as lie in the death of ignorance and unawareness, and clear
springs of perfections for those who thirst and wander in the
wasteland of their defects and errors … [t]hey are skilled
physicians for the ailing body of the world, they are the sure
antidote to the poison that has corrupted human society” [SDC
32-33], ‘Abdu’l-Bahá goes on to state “For everything, however,
God has created a sign and symbol, and established standards
and tests by which it may be known.” He then says that the
learned (`ulamá) must:

> be characterized by both inward and outward
> perfections; they must possess a good character, an
> enlightened nature, a pure intent, as well as intellectual
> power, brilliance and discernment, intuition, discretion
> and foresight, temperance, reverence, and a heartfelt
> fear of God. [SDC 33-34]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then seeks to define who can truly be regarded
as being one of these learned that he has described in such
glowing terms. It is in doing this that quotes the ˙adíth that we
are considering in this paper:

> An authoritative Tradition states: “As for him who is
> one of the learned: he must guard himself, defend his
> faith, oppose his passions and obey the commandments
> of his Lord; it is then the duty of the people to pattern
> themselves after him.” [SDC 34]

ً ‫و ا ّﻣﺎ ﻣﻦ ﮐﺎن ﻣﻦ اﻟﻌﻠﻤﺂء ﺻﺎﺋﻨﺎ ً ﻟﻨﻔﺴﮫ و ﺣﺎﻓﻈﺎ ً ﻟﺪﯾﻨﮫ و ﻣﺨﺎﻟﻔﺎ ً ﻟﮭﻮاه و ﻣﻄﯿﻌﺎ‬

‫ﻷﻣﺮ ﻣﻮﻻه ﻓﻠﻠﻌﻮام ان ﯾﻘﻠّﺪوه‬
The only substantive difference between the form of this
˙adíth as quoted by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the form quoted by most
of the Shi`i scholars is that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: “As for him
who is one of the learned (al-`ulamá) …,” while the form of the

˙adíth used by most Shi`i scholars states: “As for him who is
one of the religious legal scholars (al-fuqahá).” However the
form cited by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is not unknown in Shi`i books.
Shaykh Murtada al-Ansari, who as noted above quotes this
˙adíth with al-fuqahá, elsewhere in the book quotes a shortened
form of this ˙adíth using al-`ulamá: “As for him who is one of
the learned (al-`ulamá) and defends his faith, it is then the duty
of the people to pattern themselves after him.”12

So important does ‘Abdu’l-Bahá consider this ˙adíth that he
then devotes the next 65 pages (in the English translation of the
book) to a detailed consideration and interpretation of this
˙adíth. In other words, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spends over one half (65
of the 116 pages of the English translation) of one of only a
few books that he wrote examining this ˙adíth. He analyzes the
˙adíth phrase by phrase in great detail:
o pp. 34-40: “guard himself” — which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá takes to

> mean “to acquire spiritual and material perfections.” He
> then enumerates what he means by “perfections.” The first
> of these perfections is “learning.” In expanding on the
> learning that should be acquired, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá goes beyond
> the learning traditionally acquired by the Islamic scholars.
> To the usual branches of Islamic learning such as “a
> thorough knowledge of those complex and transcendental
> realities pertaining to God, of the fundamental truths of
> Qur’ánic political and religious law,” he adds: “the contents
> of the sacred Scriptures of other faiths, and of those
> regulations and procedures which would contribute to the
> progress and civilization of this distinguished country” as
> well as “the laws and principles, the customs, conditions and
> manners, and the material and moral virtues characterizing
> the statecraft of other nations, and should be well versed in
> all the useful branches of learning of the day, and study the
> historical records of bygone governments and peoples” [SDC
> 35]. He then makes a diversion in a matter of pressing

> according to their own understanding and this caused a
> chaotic situation within the country as litigants sought out a
> scholar who would rule in their favour). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then
> goes on to list a large number of other “perfections, such as
> justice and impartiality, sincerity and purity of purpose, to
> fear God, to love God by loving His servants, to exercise
> mildness and forbearance” [SDC 39-40].
o pp. 41-59: “defend his faith” — which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá takes to

> mean that rather than just observing the outward forms,
> observances and laws of the religion, every effort should be
> made to promote and advance the Word of God. However,
> the Word of God should be spread not by the sword, but by
> words and in particular by deeds, living a life that attracts
> others to your faith.
o pp. 59-71: “opposes his passions” — which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

> regards as the “the very foundation of every laudable human
> quality; indeed, these few words embody the light of the
> world, the impregnable basis of all the spiritual attributes of

> general peace conference at which binding treaties will be
> made and mutual security established.
o pp. 71-99: “ obedience to the commandments of his Lord” —

> here ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes that “that man's highest distinction
> is to be lowly before and obedient to his God; that his
> greatest glory, his most exalted rank and honor, depend on

Contested Interpretations

It is interesting then that the Shi`i Islamic scholars and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá both attach great importance to this ˙adíth and
that furthermore they single out the same sentence in that
˙adíth for their special consideration. What is even more
remarkable is that their interpretations of this one sentence are
so completely different that one would think they were
examining two completely different ˙adíth.

The Shi`i scholars look at the sentence and see only the
beginning and they end: “And as for whoever among the
religious legal scholars (fuqahá) ... it is then the duty of the
ordinary people to pattern themselves upon him.” They take for
granted and without discussion that the Shi`i scholars will fulfill
the requirements of the middle of the sentence: “guards himself,
defends his faith, opposes his passions and obeys the
commandments of his Lord.” All of their concern is to argue
that this ˙adíth makes it incumbent upon the ordinary Shi`is to
follow or pattern themselves upon the religious legal scholars —
the mujtahids. It gives authority for the doctrine of taqlíd and
for the division of the Shi`is into mujtahids and muqallids.
Incidentally, the only one of the Shi`i clerics that pays any
attention to the middle part of this sentence and to the context
of the Tradition as a whole is Ayatu’llah Khomeini, and this he
does for a political purpose. In Tahdhib al-Usul, a collection of
the debates that he had with his senior students, he refers to the

466                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

middle section of this ˙adíth in making the point that the
purpose of the central part of this passage is that the fuqahá
that a person should refer to should not be one of the corrupt
fuqahá, by which he means those clerics who surrounded and
supported the Pahlavi court.13

‘Abdu’l-Bahá on the other hand more or less ignores the
beginning and end of this sentence which the Shi`i scholars find
so important. His focus is on the middle of the sentence the
four phrases: “he must guard himself, defend his faith, oppose
his passions and obey the commandments of his Lord.” He uses
this ˙adíth as a framework within which to expound upon the
necessary spiritual qualities that the individuals must attain in
order to allow their society and indeed civilization to progress.
The emphasis is therefore on ethics and spiritual development
rather than religious law. Indeed, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, once he has
launched his theme in the first page or so, entirely overlooks
any idea that this sentence is about religious scholars and
addresses it to all humanity, and to statesmen and rulers in
particular. The examples he uses and the stories he tells in these
65 pages are almost all about ordinary people rather than
religious scholars. He is of course helped in this by the fact that
he is using the version of this ˙adíth that has the word “`ulamá”
rather than “fuqahá.” The word “`ulamá” means someone who
has knowledge — the learned. Although in present-day usage it
relates almost exclusively to Islamic religious scholars, in
former times, it was used more widely of philosophers,
scientists, physicians and learned statesmen. Indeed in the
Safavid period, there was a cadre of people who had undergone
religious training and who then went on to take up important
position in the government, whom Said Amir Arjomand calls
the “clerical estate.”14

One could argue that if one takes the contested sentence in
its context, then probably ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s interpretation is
closer to the original meaning. For the ˙adíth taken as a whole
is not about establishing a station for religious scholars. It is
about ethics. It criticizes the Jewish people for following their

religious leaders despite knowing full well how corrupt they
were and states that the Islamic community should be different
and its religious leaders should maintain high ethical standards.
Thus ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s detailed analysis of the ethics of the four
central phrases of the sentence is probably more in line with the
intent of the ˙adíth taken as a whole than the Shi`i scholars use
of the ˙adíth to justify taqlíd. Where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá departs even
more significantly from the religion of the Islamic scholars and
establishes a new pattern for the Bahá’í community is in the
manner in which the learning of the Islamic scholars is set aside
as a criterion for someone to be “referred to as learned” and
“worthy to serve as a model for the believers” but rather the
“divine qualifications” outlined in the four central phrases of
this Tradition are to be the criteria for the Bahá’í community
and these criteria are open to all believers not a religious
professional class. [SDC 34]

It should be noted that Bahá’u’lláh also quotes and comments
on this same Islamic Tradition in the Law˙-i Sul†án, the Tablet
to Náßiru’d-Dín Sháh, in the course of writing about the
accusations made against Him by the religious leaders of Iran:

> Concerning the prerequisites of the learned, He saith:
> “Whoso among the learned guardeth his self, defendeth
> his faith, opposeth his desires, and obeyeth his Lord's
> command, it is incumbent upon the generality of the
> people to pattern themselves after him....” Should the
> King of the Age reflect upon this utterance which hath
> streamed from the tongue of Him Who is the Dayspring
> of the Revelation of the All-Merciful, he would perceive
> that those who have been adorned with the attributes
> enumerated in this holy Tradition are scarcer than the
> philosopher's stone; wherefore not every man that layeth
> claim to knowledge deserveth to be believed. [SLH 118]
