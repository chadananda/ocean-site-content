Introduction

The Guardian's explicitly theological view of history stands at the antipodes, for example, to
Voltaire's anti-religious Enlightenment `philosophy of history,'[3] and later twentieth century,
postmodern, secular views of history. These secular approaches have generally substituted human
will, self-determination, the faculty of reason, random and/or material causes for the Will of God,
prophetic teaching and Divine Providence as determining factors in the making of history. Shoghi
Effendi's providential standpoint is made apparent, not only by its own internal evidence, but also
by his copious citation of Baha'i scripture through which he interprets both contemporary events
and Baha'i history itself. He also envisions future scenarios of a peaceful and united world, an
approach that is rejected in traditional historiography.[4] His providential view is a type of
Heilsgeschichte (salvation history).[5] In a Baha'i context, this means a fully prophetic history that

anticipates the fulfilment of the destiny of the human race, what he calls "the coming of age of the
entire human race,"[6] a form of world unity as conceived and adumbrated by Baha'u'llah, the
Prophet-Founder of the Baha'i religion. This world unity will lead ineluctably to a ...world
civilization...with a fulness of life such as the world has never seen nor can as yet conceive.'[7]
Shoghi Effendi views history as both an eschaton and an apocalypse in which a New World Order
is `...destined to rise upon the ruins of a tottering civilization...,'[8] a history that is driving toward a
predetermined finis and telos — a final end and goal. While God's overlordship of history clearly
predominates in this view, the necessity of a viable human response to the Divine Will is clearly
acknowledged. While providential history is admittedly deterministic, and becomes a type of
historicism,[9] the elements of free-will and human responsiveness remain key factors in mapping
out the Divine Plan. As for Judaism, human response is viewed as a form of partnership in the
execution of the Divine Will.

The parameters of providential history

As used here, the term providential history is defined by six conceptual elements: (1) God
may never be excluded from history. (2) A Divine Plan may be discerned within the baffling
number of events that has occurred within recorded history. (3) The prophets are the founders of
civilizations, the principal educators of humanity and the main instruments of the Divine Plan.[10]
(4) This Divine Plan drives history toward a telos or final `end'[11] (goal) which is the unity of the
human race and ultimately the birth of a world civilization. (5) Those events which at face value
appear to be adverse (disasters, reverses, setbacks), ultimately prove to contain some hidden
wisdom and are seen as a "providence of God."[12] (6) The principle of indeterminancy remains in
the unfoldment of the Divine Plan. Chaos and unpredictability are inherent to `this moving
drama.'[13]

Historical nihilism, scepticism or the search for meaning

Karl Löwith remarks in the Introduction to Meaning in History (1949) that the quest for
meaning in history exists precisely because it is not readily apparent: `It is the very absence of
meaning in the events themselves that motivates the quest.'[14] Coherent patterns in some larger
picture and a moral orientation are sought within the narrative. Philosopher-historian, William H.
Dray, in his cogent study Philosophy of History (1964), identifies three types of historical theories
or non-theories. These theories both affirm and deny that meaning can be found in history: (1)
historical nihilists: those who deny any meaning to history whatsoever. Meaning is ultra vires to the
study of history. (Value-judgements are also excluded). (2) historical sceptics: those who assert that
we cannot know whether or not there be either pattern or meaning in history, the viewpoint of many
postmodern historians. (3) philosophers/theologians of history: they assert that both meaning and
morality are intrinsic to the study of history. This last approach, dead since the Enlightenment, was
revived in the twentieth century and can be found, inter alia, in the works of the British historian
Arnold Toynbee (1889-1975), the cultural anthropologist Christopher Dawson (1898-1970), the
American Protestant post-liberal theologian Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971), and earlier in the
metaphysical system of G.W.F. Hegel (1770-1831) and his dialectic of freedom and necessity.[15] It
would also correspond to the Guardian's concept of history.

Shoghi Effendi considered that Baha'is have certain insights into the meaning of the global
crises that currently afflict humanity, what he called `this titanic upheaval.' In his extended letter,
The Promised Day Is Come, which was written partly in England, and completed in Haifa in 1941,
he wrote:

Dear friends! The powerful operations of this titanic upheaval are comprehensible to none
> except such as have recognized the claims of both Bahá'u'lláh and the Báb. Their followers
> know full well whence it comes, and what it will ultimately lead to. Though ignorant of
> how far it will reach, they clearly recognize its genesis, are aware of its direction,
> acknowledge its necessity, observe confidently its mysterious processes, ardently pray for
> the mitigation of its severity, intelligently labor to assuage its fury, and anticipate, with
> undimmed vision, the consummation of the fears and the hopes it must necessarily
> engender.[16]

The academic rejection of providential histories

While history has become a widely divergent field since the 1970s, especially under the
influence of postmodern `linguistic turn' theories of language and narrative,[17] many traditional and
post-modern historians would find any theory of providential history both outdated and
unacceptable. English historian of Soviet Russia, E. H. Carr (1892-1982), a proponent of modified
objectivity,[18] in a series of lectures given at Cambridge (January-March 1961),[19] spoke on the
relationship between history, science and morality. Carr argued that providential history, and what
he viewed as extra-historical theories like it, should find no place on any serious historian's agenda.
Carr did not object to the theorist's right to `...erect a super-historical standard or criterion in the
light of which judgement is passed on historical events or situations — whether that standard
derives from some divine authority postulated by the theologians, or from a static Reason or Nature
postulated by the philosophers of the Enlightenment.'[20] Nonetheless he argued:

> It is not that shortcomings occur in the application of the standard, or defects in the
> standard itself. It is that the attempt to erect such a standard is unhistorical and contradicts
> the very essence of history. It provides a dogmatic answer to questions which the historian
> is bound by his vocation incessantly to ask: the historian who accepts answers in advance
to these questions goes to work with his eyes blindfolded and renounces his vocation.[21]

Carr's solution to this problem is a thorough-going historical relativism. All values, he
argues, `...are in fact rooted in history.' `Every group has its own values which are rooted in
history.'[22] For Carr no absolute values exist apart from historical context. Carr's Absolute — since
God and/or Revelation are excluded — would have to be history itself which is, ironically, just as
impervious to a facile definition as are the words God, religion and revelation. C. S. Lewis made
this point by giving six different meanings to the word `history' in his anti-historicism essay
`Historicism.'[23] Moreover, Carr's statement that all values are themselves rooted in history is
begging the question (petitio principii). We have to ask ourselves what exactly is the nature of this
history that he claims to lie at the root of all values? Do the events of history create values or are
they created by them? We must know what is cause and what is effect. These are not rhetorical
chicken-egg questions. The theory of providential history answers that values create history and not
the reverse.

(1) The dual phenomenon of palingenesis and transitional history

I turn now to the points outlined in the Abstract. The Guardian wrote that contemporary
history is marked by a `dual phenomenon,' the simultaneous disintegration and integration of the old
and new world orders. The seminal passages that speak of this dual phenomenon are central to his
thought and run like a leit-motif throughout his epistolary:

We are indeed living in an age which, if we would correctly appraise it, should be regarded
> as one which is witnessing a dual phenomenon. The first signalizes the death pangs of an
> order, effete and godless, that has stubbornly refused, despite the signs and portents of a
> century-old Revelation, to attune its processes to the precepts and ideals which that
> Heaven-sent Faith proffered it. The second proclaims the birth pangs of an Order, divine
> and redemptive, that will inevitably supplant the former, and within Whose administrative
> structure an embryonic civilization, incomparable and world-embracing, is imperceptibly
> maturing. The one is being rolled up, and is crashing in oppression, bloodshed, and ruin.
> The other opens up vistas of a justice, a unity, a peace, a culture, such as no age has ever
> seen. The former has spent its force, demonstrated its falsity and barrenness, lost
> irretrievably its opportunity, and is hurrying to its doom. The latter, virile and
> unconquerable, is plucking asunder its chains, and is vindicating its title to be the one
refuge within which a sore-tried humanity, purged from its dross, can attain its destiny.[24]

Shoghi Effendi was not alone in his conviction that western civilization was dying. Decades
earlier, Burkhardt in Switzerland, Nietzsche in Germany, Dostoevski and Count Tolstoy in Russia
and, of course, Oswald Spengler in Der Untergang des Abenlandes (The Decline of the West)
(trans. 1926-1928), all predicted the fall of the West.[25] His unique contribution was that he linked,
in graphic terms, and in a magisterial language of apocalyptic certitude, such a decline to the
proclamation and rejection of Baha'u'llah's Revelation. But unlike Shoghi Effendi, these historians
abstained from making pronouncements about the future development of a world civilization.

The motif of death and rebirth alluded to in the above passage is very ancient. While the
Baha'i Faith rejects reincarnation, death and rebirth have both a scientific and conceptual usage in
biology,[26] philosophy and theology. It was used by the Romantics as palingenesia[27] — the more
usual biological term is palingenesis — and was employed, among others, by the Pythagoreans to
indicate metempsychosis, and by Schopenhauer to designate the continued existence of the eternal
will in each newborn individual.[28] The duality highlighted above by Shoghi Effendi is found
especially in his dyadic expressions `death pangs/birth pangs'[29] that characterise the twin processes
that define the modern age. These sets of binary relationships are found in other passages of his
writings such as the `rise and of fall,' `integration and disintegration,' and `order and chaos, with
their continuous and reciprocal reactions on each other.'[30]

With this last phrase, Shoghi Effendi has foreshadowed one of the key ideas in modern
chaos theory. What first appears to the observer to be only chaos, when viewed in a longer and
larger perspective, may in fact signify the emergence of a new order of things. Physicist-theologian
Dr Robert J. Russell throws light on the Guardian's statement:

> From a theological perspective, we can add to the view that God creates the universe
> through chance and law, the claim that the order God is creating is in some sense the order
> of quantum chaos. Rather than saying that God creates order in place of (i.e., out of) chaos,
> from a quantum perspective we could say that one way God creates order is through
creating properties of chaos.[31]

The scientific, religious and mythic views converge, then, on the point that order proceeds,
and must proceed, from chaos. The stark contrast between these two simultaneous processes, the
one a creative affirmation of life, and the other a thanatopsis[32] of a doomed civilization, points to
the profound truth that new life springs from death in the grand continuum that is called existence.
The death of the old world order does not mean annihilation but resurrection. The same may be said
of Arnold Toynbee's cyclical view of the rise and fall of civilizations and cultures. Karl Löwith

reminds us that for Toynbee `...disintegration may look like growth and vice-versa.'[33] In the
nineteenth century Hegel made the same observation in his Lectures on the Philosophy of History
(1830): `But the next consideration which allies itself with that of change, is that change, while it
imports dissolution, involves at the same time the rise of a new life, that while death is the issue of
life, life is also the issue of death.'[34]

As mentioned, erudite histories usually abstain from making predictions. The academic
historian does not make it her business to prophesy. Apocalyptic scenarios are necessarily excluded.
Shoghi Effendi's view of history includes both apocalyptic judgements and future predictions, both
sombre and bright. Among others, he predicts a transition from `brutal nationalism'[35] to fraternal
internationalism. Of this coming new age of fraternal internationalism, he wrote: `National rivalries,
hatreds, and intrigues will cease, and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial
amity, understanding and cooperation.'[36] As mentioned above, this view points to the coming
maturity of the human race as it passes through its stage of adolescence, which he called `...the most
turbulent stage of its evolution...when the impetuosity of youth and its vehemence reach their
climax...'[37] This passage also gives credence to his linear view of the succession of historical
events in `the Day which shall not be followed by night.':[38]

> The ages of its infancy and childhood are past, never again to return, while the Great Age,
> the consummation of all ages, which must signalize the coming of age of the entire human
> race, is yet to come. The convulsions of this transitional and most turbulent period in the
> annals of humanity are the essential prerequisites, and herald the inevitable approach, of
> that Age of Ages, "the time of the end," in which the folly and tumult of strife that has,
> since the dawn of history, blackened the annals of mankind, will have been finally
> transmuted into the wisdom and the tranquility of an undisturbed, a universal, and lasting
> peace, in which the discord and separation of the children of men will have given way to
> the worldwide reconciliation, and the complete unification of the divers elements that
> constitute human society.[39]

(2) `Synchronization' in providential history

Once widespread in the English-speaking world but now largely obsolete, "providence" is a
word that has been resurrected in Shoghi Effendi's theological vocabulary. (cf. Lat. providere, 'to
foresee,' and Gk. pronia 'forethought').While firmly rooted in biblical theology, it lingers on mainly
in the disquisitions of theologians and philosophers of religion. A large topic, the existence of
Providence is usually subdivided into General and Special Providence. God's providence
traditionally includes three functional components: (1) preservation (2) provision. These two may
be subsumed by (3) government.[40] The Guardian's references to `Providence' refer mainly to God's
intervention, protection and foresight vis-à-vis seemingly adverse events in the world as they affect
the Baha'i community. Two examples follow:

(a) The outbreak of world war two

Just prior to the outbreak of world war two, in order to fortify his readers for the ordeals that
were about to engulf humanity, Shoghi Effendi shared his thoughts on what he called
`synchronisation' between upcoming catastrophic world events and the gradual but steady spread of
the Faith he directed. His words hearted those who were soon to face the upcoming global conflict;
they also indicated a basic component of his view of Providence. Writing to the American and
Canadian Baha'i communities in 1938, Shoghi Effendi alluded to the coming war on the European

continent[41] which was soon to break out on 3 September 1939:[42] `Who knows but that these few
remaining, fast-fleeting years, may not be pregnant with events of unimaginable magnitude, with
ordeals more severe than any that humanity has as yet experienced, with conflicts more devastating
than any which preceded them.'[43] And yet, he foresaw a divine wisdom in any future hostilities and
encouraged the Baha'is to remain steadfast while finding a `synchronization' between world-events
and their own appointed tasks:

> Far from yielding in their resolve, far from growing oblivious of their task, they should, at
> no time, however much buffeted by circumstances, forget that the synchronization of such
> world-shaking crises with the progressive unfoldment and fruition of their divinely
> appointed task is itself the work of Providence, the design of an inscrutable Wisdom, and
> the purpose of an all-compelling Will, a Will that directs and controls, in its own
mysterious way, both the fortunes of the Faith and the destinies of men.[44]

At the end of World War Two, he wrote in a cablegram of 12 May 1945:
> The cessation of hostilities in the European continent signalizes yet another chapter in the
> tragic tale of fiery trials providentially decreed by inscrutable wisdom designed ultimately
> to weld the mutually antagonistic elements of human society into a single, organically-
> united, unshatterable world commonwealth. They gratefully acclaim the signal evidence of
> the interposition of divine Providence which during such perilous years enabled the World
> Center of our Faith to escape what posterity will recognize as one of the gravest dangers
> which ever confronted the nerve center of its institutions."[45]
With these words, no sharp demarcation can be made between discernible secular history from the
internal and less visible sacred events associated with the development of the Baha'i Faith.

(b) The 1955 persecution of the Iranian Baha'is: one of the `mysterious dispensations of
providence'

During the summer of 1955, the Iranian government and clergy launched what Shoghi
Effendi called a `premeditated campaign' of persecution against the Baha'i community. Fuller
details of this incident may be found in his letters of 15 August and 20 August 1955.[46] The
persecution included the formal outlawing of the Baha'i Faith in the Majalis, the banning of Baha'i
activities, the destruction of the dome of the National Centre, and various abuses and atrocities
committed in the provinces which included `the hacking to pieces' of seven believers living near
Yazd, the desecration of the Bab's house in Shiraz, the occupation of Baha'u'llah's ancestral home in
Takur, the plundering of shops and farms, the desecration of cemeteries, the forcible entry and
looting of private homes, forced marriages to Muslims, rape and murder. Always ready to evaluate
the gravity of historical events, he described this persecution as `..more grievous than any of the
intermittent crises which have more or less acutely afflicted the Faith since the inception, over thirty
years ago, of the Formative Age of the Baha'i Dispensation...'

The response to the persecution was both decisive and instructive. Shoghi Effendi directed
the American Baha'i Community to send appeals for protection to President Eisenhower. Local and
national spiritual assemblies sent thousands of `appeals' to the Iranian government and the Shah.
Appeals were lodged with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the
Social and Economic Council, `copies of which were delivered to the representatives of the member
nations of the Council, to the Director of the Human Rights Division, as well as to non-
governmental organizations with consultative status.' The Guardian wrote further that the 1955

persecution led to `widespread publicity' that had attracted `...the notice of those in high places...'

and which Shoghi Effendi saw as a prelude to `...the emancipation of these valiant sufferers from
the galling fetters of an antiquated religious orthodoxy....will, in varying measure, have its
repercussions in Islamic countries, or may be even preceded by a similar phenomenon in
neighbouring territories, hastening and adding fresh impetus to the bursting of the bonds that fetter
the freedom of the followers of God's infant Faith.'[47]

In a more poetic tone, his thought on this seemingly calamitous event was expressed in the
following passage:

Indeed this fresh ordeal that has, in pursuance of the mysterious dispensations of
> Providence, afflicted the Faith, at this unexpected hour, far from dealing a fatal blow to its
> institutions or existence, should be regarded as a blessing in disguise, not a "calamity" but
> a "providence" of God, not a devastating flood but a "gentle rain" on a "green pasture," a
> "wick" and "oil" unto the "lamp" of His Faith, a "nurture" for His Cause, "water for that
> which has been planted in the hearts of men," a "crown set on the head" of His Messenger
> for this Day.[48]

(3) The Judaeo-Christian heritage: teleological history

Whatever current theories of the philosophy of history may be, or the practice of
historiography itself, it is clear that the Guardian's view of history is decidedly teleological (Gr.
telos, end, completion). Teleology lends itself to the construction of the predictive grand scheme or
the meta-narrative. Both have been criticised as failures by the French philosopher Jean-François
Lyotard (1924-1998) in The Postmodern Condition.[49] It did not escape the notice of the respected
Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye (1912-1991) that the teleological sense has virtually
disappeared in modernity: `One of the most striking cultural facts of our time is the disappearance
of this teleological sense. We tend now to think of our lives as being, like the long poem described
by Poe,[50] a discontinuous sequence of immediate experiences.'[51] However, philosopher of critical
realism[52] and poet George Santayana, in explaining Herbert Spencer's views on evolution and
substance, has argued that `...evolution must have a goal, it must unfold a germ in a determinate
direction towards an implicit ideal; otherwise there would be no progress involved, no means of
distinguishing changes for the better from changes for the worse.'[53]

In this paper, teleology means that the Divine Will has predetermined the end-goal of history
and ultimately directs the process toward its final achievement. The origins of teleology are found
in rudimentary Greek science and philosophy (Aristotelian, Platonic, Neo-Platonic),[54] although
curiously, not in their history which was basically oriental, i.e., mythic and cyclical. Teleological
movement in history is primarily Judaeo-Christian in origin since it is seen to be moving toward the
coming of the Messianic Kingdom, the ultimate end-point, goal and purpose of all creation. Yairah
Amit, a contemporary Jewish scholar, has pointed out how the belief in a coming kingdom
contrasted markedly from the mythical sense of cyclical time in the religions that preceded Judaism,
whether those of Greece or India. Only Persian, Zoroastrian eschatology resembled the Hebrew
view of history as a drama that moved toward a final resolution, after an eschatological clash of the
forces of darkness and light (good and evil) at the end of the age with the coming a Saviour-Figure
(Saoshaynt). Amit observes:

> The concept of divinity as developed in biblical literature is of a single universal deity who
> manifests himself in history, conducts a continuous dialogue, direct or indirect, with
humankind, and is not only a cosmic divinity in command of nature, but also a kind of

providence, supervising human history and directing it. This concept gave rise to a new
attitude to history, which came to replace mythology.[55]

And what of Islam? Briefly, Islam inherited from later Judaism and Christianity, as one its
five articles of faith,[56] a belief in the Last Day/Day of Judgment/End of the World and bodily
resurrection (qiyama), although the vivid details of end-time apocalyptic scenarios differ. The
Islamic view of the Last Day would appear to bring closure to the time-line of history. According to
one hadith, the Prophet held up his thumb and forefinger, making only a tiny space between them,
and said: `I and the Last Hour are like this.'[57] The Muslim belief in Muhammad as the `seal' (khtm)
and last of the prophets reinforces this idea. Islamic eschatology centers in both the judgement of
the individual soul (the lesser resurrection) and the judgement of all humanity (the greater
resurrection) and the cosmic rearrangement or end of the world.[58] Although the Last Day glories of
heaven and the terrors of hell are graphically spelled out in the Qur'an, little is said about the nature
of the new order after the return of the Mahdi and/or Jesus Christ (Isa), except that evil will
defeated. Thus Islamic eschatology points in a sense to the "end of history."

The eclectic, Christian existentialist philosopher Nicholas Berdyaev (1874-1948) in The
Meaning of History (trans. 1936) has explicated the unique contribution of the Judaeo-Christian
view of history. Berdyaev underscored the dramatic, dynamic and teleological nature of this
theology of history that was western civilization's biblical inheritance, one that became possible
only in light of the Judaeo-Christian doctrine of free-will and the freedom of humanity: `For the
Jews the idea of history turns upon the expectation of some future event which will bring with it a
solution of history. They are the first to demonstrate the structural character of the historical process
and to become conscious of the `historical'...Christianity introduced historical dynamism and the
extraordinary force of historical movement, and thus made possible a philosophy of
history...History is a progression; it possesses an inner significance and mystery, a point of
departure and a goal, a centre and a purpose...There would be no drama of history, no tragic
development, expressing the profound clash, interaction and strife between the Divinity and
mankind on the ground of freedom, if only one principle, that of natural or divine necessity were
involved...But history also demands a dynamic-creative element, a creative sequence and purpose,
an urge towards self-fulfilment.'[59]

Reinhold Niebuhr in his compelling work Faith and History (1949) has argued cogently
how the idea of the `one story' for humanity has developed from the belief in `a single divine
sovereignty...,'[60] the `single universal deity' mentioned above by Amit. Niehbuhr argues:

> History is conceived as unity because all historical destinies are under the dominion of a
> single divine sovereignty....It would seem, therefore, that the story of mankind is
> progressively becoming one story, both through an actual growth in cultural penetration
> and through the development of historical sciences, able to trace and analyse such
> interpenetrations.[61]
While Niebuhr's comment reflects on the Judaeo-Christian view of a Kingdom of God that governs
the entire world, it is also coherent with the Baha'i view of providential history which is precisely a
meta-history that shifts the focus away from the nationalistic, military or technical prowess of
particular nations to concentrate instead on the story of the development of one human family.

Seminal texts in Shoghi Effendi's writings may be found that bear on the theme of the
fulfilment of the end-goal of history, which he called `the last and highest stage in the stupendous
evolution of man's collective life on this planet.' The following one announces the promise and
fulfilment of this final end:

The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, whose supreme mission is none other but the achievement
> of this organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations, should, if we be faithful to
> its implications, be regarded as signalizing through its advent the coming of age of the
> entire human race. It should be viewed not merely as yet another spiritual revival in the
> ever-changing fortunes of mankind, not only as a further stage in a chain of progressive
> Revelations, nor even as the culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles,
> but rather as marking the last and highest stage in the stupendous evolution of man's
> collective life on this planet. The emergence of a world community, the consciousness of
> world citizenship, the founding of a world civilization and culture — all of which must
> synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of the Golden Age of the Bahá'í Era
> — should, by their very nature, be regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as the
> furthermost limits in the organization of human society, though man, as an individual, will,
> nay must indeed as a result of such a consummation, continue indefinitely to progress and
> develop.[62]

(4) Organically whole history

One of the central concepts of the seventh world order letter, `The Unfoldment of World
Civilization,' is that of `this organic and spiritual unity,'[63] also described simply as `organic
unity.'[64] This key phrase applies both to the structure and operation of the Baha'i Administrative
Order and the future unified body of nations. It is coherent with that of the `living organism'
mentioned in the second world order letter, `The Goal of a New World Order' (1930). To speak of
organic unity is to invoke holism, a word that was coined by the South African statesman and
general, Field Marshall J.C. Smuts (1870-1950) in his philosophical treatise Holism and Evolution
(1926). However, in a religion whose scriptures also promote `unity in diversity,' it is important to
note that the philosophy of holism is not synonymous with an undifferentiated wholeness. Holism
conceals, moreover, an unsuspected moral character as indicated by Shoghi Effendi's maxim, based
on Abdu'l-Baha, that `The welfare of the part means the welfare of the whole, and the distress of the
part brings distress to whole.'[65]

Organic unity is intrinsic to Shoghi Effendi's view of Baha'i history as an organic whole: it
unfolds in a developmental process that is orderly, holistic and evolutionary. He wrote in God
Passes By (1944) that the four periods he first identified in the first Baha'i century were all
interdependent and interconnected:

> To isolate any one of them from the others, to dissociate the later manifestations of one
> universal, all-embracing Revelation from the pristine purpose that animated it in its earliest
> days, would be tantamount to a mutilation of the structure on which it rests, and to a
> lamentable perversion of its truth and of its history....These four periods are to be regarded
> not only as the component, the inseparable parts of one stupendous whole, but as
> progressive stages in a single evolutionary process, vast, steady and irresistible. For as we
> survey the entire range which the operation of a century-old Faith has unfolded before us,
> we cannot escape the conclusion that from whatever angle we view this colossal scene, the
> events associated with these periods present to us unmistakable evidences of a slowly
> maturing process, of an orderly development, of internal consolidation, of external
> expansion, of a gradual emancipation from the fetters of religious orthodoxy, and of a
> corresponding diminution of civil disabilities and restrictions.[66]
(5) Periodisation: cycles, ages and epochs[67]

While periodisation is an accepted commonplace of the historical method, philosopher,
historian and archaeologist of Roman Britain, R.H. Collingwood (1889-1943) observed in The Idea
of History (1946) in his remarks on medieval historiography: `Now, the attempt to distinguish
periods in history is a mark of advanced and mature historical thought, not afraid to interpret facts
instead of merely asserting them....'[68] As was pointed out in (4), the Guardian has provided for the
Baha'i community its own periodisation, a basic technique of historiography.

His demarcation of periods was expanded to include the Baha'i Era itself and its Ages.

Following the teachings of Abdu'l-Baha, he wrote that the Declaration of the Bab marked the
beginning of the Baha'i Era and the inauguration of a new cycle in human history which is to last,
according to Abdu'l-Baha in a tablet to a Zoroastrian believer, some 500,000 years: `May 23, 1844,
signalizes the commencement of the most turbulent period of the Heroic Age of the Bahá'í Era, an
age which marks the opening of the most glorious epoch in the greatest cycle which the spiritual
history of mankind has yet witnessed.'[69]

Then we have the assignment of ages. The first age is called the Heroic, the Primitive or the
Apostolic Age. The second age is called variously `...the Formative, the Transitional,' or `Iron
Age.'[70] The third age is the Golden Age. As mentioned in (4), he devotes a not inconsiderable
portion of the Foreword of God Passes By to the establishment of `periods' (pp. xiii-xvi), by
assigning four of them to the first century of the Baha'i Era (1844-1944). He thus supplies a useful
gage by which Baha'is may situate themselves within the temporal flux of their dispensation.
Periodisation serves two other useful purposes: (1) it allows for the assessment of past events in
order to better understand their import (2) it sensitizes to the necessity of seizing present
opportunities since they in turn will become the `stuff of history.'

A `vital link' has connected these Three Ages. The Will and Testament of Abdu'l-Baha `..has
forged the vital link which must for ever connect the age that has just expired
[Primitive/Apostolic/Heroic Age] with the one we now live in — the Transitional and Formative
period of the Faith...'[71] The Guardian's assurance in the ultimate success of the Baha'i Faith is
based on his belief that it is rooted in the fertile soil of what the Greek fathers of the apostolic
church called the logos spermatikos, [72] which alluded to the fecundating power of the Holy Word.
Seed imagery is not, of course, exclusive to the Christian tradition. Just as the Bab referred to the
Bayan as being in the stage of seed,[73] Shoghi Effendi used this seed imagery to indicate evolution
or gradation, as he depicted the gradual unfoldment of the Three Ages of the Babi-Baha'i Faith:
`The period in which the seed of the Faith had been slowly germinating [Heroic Age] is thus
intertwined both with the one which must witness its efflorescence [Formative Age] and the
subsequent age in which that seed will have finally yielded its golden fruit.' [Golden Age].[74]
Needless to say, this is an image of organic wholeness.

In addition to assigning periods and ages, he has also subdivided these ages into epochs. The
Universal House of Justice determined, in its message of 16 January 2001 to the Baha'is of the
world, that they were entering the fifth epoch of the Formative Age.[75] While it is beyond the scope
of this paper to give a detailed account of the determination of these epochs,[76] one must bear in
mind the following point in order to avoid confusion. A two-track chronology of epochs is
unfolding concurrently. While each of the Three Great Ages of the Baha'i Faith is subdivided into
epochs, Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, as contained in the Tablets of the Divine Plan to the North
American Baha'is (1916-1917), inaugurated another series of epochs.[77] The dates of the first epoch
of this Divine Plan are 1937-1963, corresponding to the inception of the First Seven Year Plan

(1937-1944) and concluding with the Ten Year World Crusade/Plan (1953-1963). The Baha'is are
currently in the second epoch of Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan begun in 1964 with the Nine Year Plan
of the Universal House of Justice.

Such an assignment of ages and epochs is not, of course, without precedent in religious
history. St. Augustine in The City of God (Civitas Dei), which narrated the history of the world from
creation to the Last Judgement, and which attacked both the cyclical theory of history and the
special destiny of Rome, assigned a scheme of Six Ages based on divisions of Old Testament
history, with each age supposing to last for a thousand years, although Augustine softened this
rigidity. The seventh age is eternity. Augustine more or less absorbed these ages into the simpler
scheme of the Three Eras: (1) the pre-mosaic, or pre-legal. (2) the legal which corresponded to the
Mosaic Dispensation. (3) the Era of Grace, i.e. the Christian Dispensation. He also assigned to his
periodisation the Four World Monarchies (Assyria, Persia, Greece and Rome), with Christ's
kingdom being the Fifth Monarchy. His new scheme was, of course, the two cities that coexist in
history, Babylon and Jerusalem, the earthly and the heavenly cities, of which all human beings are
members.[78]

(6) History as identity creation: the north American Baha'i community

Shoghi Effendi's writings contributed to the Baha'i community a strong sense of its own
historical consciousness. This is particularly true of the North American Baha'i community. In both
The Advent of Divine Justice (1939), and `America and the Most Great Peace'(1933), the fifth world
order letter, he sets out the `mission' and signal accomplishments of the North American Baha'is
whom he calls `the spiritual descendants of the dawn-breakers of a heroic Age'[79] and the
`champion-builders of the World Order of Bahá'u'lláh...'[80] He describes them as holding a position
of `undisputed leadership'[81] in the Baha'i world. Preeminent among these accomplishments is the
establishment of the Administrative Order on the North American continent and around the world
and America's mission as the leading nation in the establishment of world peace.

It is the identity-creating function of such passages that I emphasize here, rather than the
preeminence of the North American Baha'i community. Sociologists of religion usually understand
identity as a function of the individual's belonging to a religious community. Yet it is no less true
that identity is also a function of the community's collective self-consciousness, particularly of its
historical and doctrinal self-consciousness. Just as an individual's sense of identity undergoes
change and development, the same is true of community identity. In his praises of the North
American Baha'i community's recent achievements, Shoghi Effendi produced a transformation of its
historical consciousness. In his eulogies, which find their origin in the writings of Abdu'l-Baha,
Shoghi Effendi largely created a sense of Baha'i community identity.

In the subsection entitled `Chief Remaining Citadel', in the opening pages of The Advent of
Divine Justice (1939), our author made a major statement on the historical achievements of the
North American Baha'is. The following passage is only the preamble to a much longer eulogy, one
that is framed by no less than thirteen rhetorical questions. Along the lines of Arnold Toynbee's
`challenge and response' causal factor in the rise and persistence of civilizations, [82] this preamble
establishes the record of the North American Baha'is, despite the considerable obstacles and
handicaps that confronted them in their early days. Each clause addresses a particular handicap or
obstacle that has been faced and successfully overcome:

> A community, relatively negligible in its numerical strength; separated by vast distances
from both the focal-center of its Faith and the land wherein the preponderating mass of its

fellow-believers reside; bereft in the main of material resources and lacking in experience
> and in prominence; ignorant of the beliefs, concepts and habits of those peoples and races
> from which its spiritual Founders have sprung; wholly unfamiliar with the languages in
> which its sacred Books were originally revealed; constrained to place its sole reliance upon
> an inadequate rendering of only a fragmentary portion of the literature embodying its laws,
> its tenets, and its history; subjected from its infancy to tests of extreme severity, involving,
> at times, the defection of some of its most prominent members; having to contend, ever
> since its inception, and in an ever-increasing measure, with the forces of corruption, of
> moral laxity, and ingrained prejudice — such a community, in less than half a century, and
> unaided by any of its sister communities, whether in the East or in the West, has, by virtue
> of the celestial potency with which an all-loving Master has abundantly endowed it, lent an
> impetus to the onward march of the Cause it has espoused which the combined
> achievements of its coreligionists in the West have failed to rival.[83]
In this and similar passages, Shoghi Effendi held up a mirror in which this community doubtless
saw itself reflected for the first time. This passage, and others like it, also provided a summary or
outline of American Baha'i history which future historians can use as the basis for their research.

Conclusion

I have argued in this paper that the Guardian's writings reflect a dynamic and coherent
concept of history which is consistent in its main features with the Judaeo-Christian understanding
of providential history. While Shoghi Effendi's view of modern history remains at odds with current
postmodern theories and academic approaches, which reject grand narratives and predictive
teleological schemes, these elements are clearly present in his concept. While it retains its own
originality, his view adapts, prolongs and offers itself as the fulfilment of the ancient Judaeo-
Christian view of the coming kingdom. As one theory among others, providential history ensures
that history continues to be viewed as the result of prophetic teaching and divine intervention rather
than the product of purely secular causes and effects. In Shoghi Effendi's view, God is no deus
absconditus.

The Word "History" Is Problematic

At the outset, we should recognize that the word history is itself ambiguous and requires
closer definition. C.S. Lewis, the great English scholar of Medieval and Renaissance literature, has
identified six commonly used meanings of the word history: (1) the total content of time: past,
present and future (2) the past only Ain all its teeming riches" (3) what is discoverable about the
past from surviving evidence (4) the findings of professional historians (5) A...that version of the
matter so discovered which has been worked up by great historical writers," i.e. Gibbon or
Mommsen. (6) A...that vague, composite picture of the past which floats, rather hazily, in the mind
of the ordinary education man."[1] But what the Guardian would refer to as "history" would indicate
those advances in civilization, those noteworthy developments and significant events, the institutes
that have been founded by the prophets, and the communities established in their name. Such a
concept must include considerations of morality, spirituality and ethics. For as `Abdu'l-Bahá has
argued, and in this, as in all things, Shoghi Effendi closely follows him: AA superficial culture,
unsupported by a cultivated morality, is as "a confused medley of dreams," and external lustre
without inner perfection is "like a vapor in the desert which the thirsty dreameth to be water."[2] This

is one of the meanings of `Abdu'l-Bahá's secret as alluded to in the title of his treatise, The Secret of
Divine Civilization (1875), that "true civilization" has an ethical and spiritual basis, without which it
is not worthy of the name.

Philosopher-historian, William H. Dray, in his cogent study Philosophy of History (1964)
identifies three types of historical theories or non-theories as the case may be: (1) historical nihilists:
those who deny any meaning to history. (2) historical sceptics: those who assert that we cannot
know whether or not there be either pattern or meaning in history. This would be the viewpoint of
postmodern historians. (3) those who assert that meaning may indeed be found in history. This last
approach, dead since the Enlightenment, was revived in the twentieth century and can be found in
the works of Arnold Toynbee, Christopher Dawson, the American Protestant theologian Reinhold
Niebuhr and in the metaphysical system of G.W.F. Hegel and his dialectic of freedom and
necessity.[3] It would also correspond to the Guardian's concept of history.

(1) Providential History

Providential history is, of course, a theological overview of history. As I am using the term,
it is being conflated and equated with prophetic history and is defined by at least five conceptual
elements some of which have already been mentioned in the Abstract: (1) God's lordship over all
includes overlordship of history. (2) A Divine Plan may be discerned within the baffling, infinite
number of composite events that has occurred or is occurring within the temporal flux. (3) The
prophets are the founders of civilizations, the main educators of humanity, and the main instruments
of the Divine Plan. (4) This Divine Plan drives history toward a telos or final "end"[4] (goal) which
is the unity of the human race and ultimately the birth of a world civilization. (5) Those events
which at face value appear to be adverse (disasters, crises, defeats, reverses or setbacks), prove in
the end to contain some hidden wisdom and serve the ends, ways and means of Providence. This
last point is particularly true of Bahá'í history.

Traditional and especially post-modern historians would find, of course, any theory of
providential history completely outdated and quite unacceptable. English historian of Soviet Russia,
E. H. Carr (1892-1982), a proponent of modified objectivity,[5] in a series of lectures given at
Cambridge (January-March, 1961),[6] spoke on the relationship between history, science and
morality. Carr argued that providential history, and what he viewed as extra-historical theories like
it, should find no place on any serious historian's agenda. Carr did not object to the theorist's right to
A...erect a super-historical standard or criterion in the light of which judgement is passed on
historical events or situations — whether that standard derives from some divine authority
postulated by the theologians, or from a static Reason or Nature postulated by the philosophers of
the Enlightenment."[7] Nonetheless he argued:

> It is not that shortcomings occur in the application of the standard, or defects in the
> standard itself. It is that the attempt to erect such a standard is unhistorical and contradicts
> the very essence of history. It provides a dogmatic answer to questions which the historian
> is bound by his vocation incessantly to ask: the historian who accepts answers in advance
to these questions goes to work with his eyes blindfolded and renounces his vocation.[8]

Carr's solution to this problem, at least as far as values are concerned, is a thorough-going
historical relativism. All values, he argues, "...are in fact rooted in history." "...Every group has its
own values which are rooted in history."[9] For Carr there can be no absolute values apart from
historical context. Carr's Absolute, if he believed in one, since God and/or Revelation are excluded,
would have to be history itself which is just as impervious to a facile definition as are the words

God, religion and revelation. Moreover, Carr's statement that all values are themselves rooted in
history is begging the question (petitio principii). We have to ask ourselves what exactly is the
nature of this history that he claims to lie at the root all values? Do the events of history create such
values or are they created by them? We must know what is cause and what is effect. These are not
rhetorical chicken-egg questions. The theory of providential history answers that values create
history and not the reverse.

Example 1: The War Years (1939-1945): "Synchronization" as the Work of Providence

Writing to the American and Canadian Bahá'í communities in 1938 during the prosecution
of the first Seven Year Plan (1937-1944),[10] with characteristic foresight, Shoghi Effendi alluded to
the imminent global conflict that was smouldering on the European continent,[11] and was soon to
burst into flame on September 3, 1939:[12] "Who knows but that these few remaining, fast-fleeting
years, may not be pregnant with events of unimaginable magnitude, with ordeals more severe than
any that humanity has as yet experienced, with conflicts more devastating than any which preceded
them."[13] In order to fortify the Bahá'ís for the ordeals that were about to encircle the globe, in
addition to his repeated exhortations and encouragements, Shoghi Effendi also intimated his views
on the workings of what he called "synchronisation" between upcoming catastrophic world events
and the steady course of the world-wide expansion of the Bahá'í Faith. Not only were his words
heartening to those Bahá'ís who were already within earshot of the rumblings of the Second World
War but they also indicated one of the basic components of his view of Providence. He wrote:

"Far from yielding in their resolve, far from growing oblivious of their task, they should, at
no time, however much buffeted by circumstances, forget that the synchronization of such world-
shaking crises with the progressive unfoldment and fruition of their divinely appointed task is itself
the work of Providence, the design of an inscrutable Wisdom, and the purpose of an all-compelling
Will, a Will that directs and controls, in its own mysterious way, both the fortunes of the Faith and
the destinies of men."[14]

At the end of World War Two, the Guardian wrote in a cablegram of May 12, 1945:
> "The cessation of hostilities in the European continent signalizes yet another chapter in the
> tragic tale of fiery trials providentially decreed by inscrutable wisdom designed ultimately
> to weld the mutually antagonistic elements of human society into a single,
> organically-united, unshatterable world commonwealth. They gratefully acclaim the signal
> evidence of the interposition of divine Providence which during such perilous years
> enabled the World Center of our Faith to escape what posterity will recognize as one of the
> gravest dangers which ever confronted the nerve center of its institutions."[15]
With these words, no sharp demarcation can be made between discernible secular history from the
internal and less visible sacred events associated with the development of the Bahá'í Faith. For the
Guardian, it is all one big history moving ineluctably toward its climax.

Example 2: The 1955 Persecution of the Iranian Bahá'ís: One of the "Mysterious
Dispensations of Providence"

During the summer of 1955 the Iranian government and clergy launched what Shoghi
Effendi called a "premeditated campaign" of persecution against the Bahá'í community. Fuller
details of this incident may be found in Shoghi Effendi's letters of August 15 and August 20,
1955\.[16] The persecution included the formal outlawing of the Bahá'í Faith in the Majalis, the

banning of Bahá'í activities, the destruction of the dome of the National Centre, and various abuses
and atrocities committed in the provinces which included "the hacking to pieces" of seven believers
living near Yazd, the desecration of the Báb's house in Shiráz, the occupation of Bahá'u'lláh's
ancestral home in Tákur, the plundering of shops and farms, the desecration of cemeteries, the
forcible entry and looting of private homes, forced marriages to Muslims, rape and murder. The
Guardian, always ready to evaluate the gravity of historical events, described this persecution as
A...more grievous than any of the intermittent crises which have more or less acutely afflicted the
Faith since the inception, over thirty years ago, of the Formative Age of the Bahá'í Dispensation...."

The response to the persecution was both decisive and instructive since it set a precedent of
response for any future abuses. Shoghi Effendi directed the American Bahá'í Community to send
appeals for protection to President Eisenhower. Local and National Spiritual Assemblies sent
thousands of "appeals" to the Iranian government and the Shah. Appeals were lodged with the
Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the Social and Economic Council,
"copies of which were delivered to the representatives of the member nations of the Council, to the
Director of the Human Rights Division, as well as to non-governmental organizations with
consultative status." The Guardian wrote further that the 1955 persecution led to "widespread
publicity" that had attracted A...the notice of those in high places..." and which Shoghi Effendi saw
as a prelude to A...the emancipation of these valiant sufferers from the galling fetters of an
antiquated religious orthodoxy....will, in varying measure, have its repercussions in Islamic
countries, or may be even preceded by a similar phenomenon in neighbouring territories, hastening
and adding fresh impetus to the bursting of the bonds that fetter the freedom of the followers of
God's infant Faith."[17]

(2) Periodisation: Cycles, Ages and Epochs[18]

The Guardian has provided for the Bahá'í community its own periodisation, a basic
technique of historiography. Beginning at the beginning, and following the teachings of `Abdu'l-
Bahá, he wrote that the Declaration of the Báb marked the beginning of the Bahá'í Era and the
inauguration of a new cycle in human history which is to last, according to the judgement of
`Abdu'l-Bahá in a tablet to a Zoroastrian believer, some 500,000 years: Shoghi Effendi wrote: "May
23, 1844, signalizes the commencement of the most turbulent period of the Heroic Age of the Bahá'í
Era, an age which marks the opening of the most glorious epoch in the greatest cycle which the
spiritual history of mankind has yet witnessed."[19] Then we have the assignment of ages. The first
age is called in God Passes By and elsewhere the Heroic, the Primitive or the Apostolic Age. In
God Passes By, he varies somewhat the nomenclature assigned to the divisions of time. The second
age is called A...the Formative, the Transitional," or "Iron Age."[20] (The added designation is the
Iron Age). Shoghi Effendi devotes a not inconsiderable portion of the Foreword of God Passes By
to the establishment of "periods" (pp. xiii-xvi), by assigning four of them to the first century of the
Bahá'í Era (1844-1944). In so doing, he supplies a necessary gage by which Bahá'ís may situate
themselves within the temporal flux of their dispensation. Periodisation also serves two useful
purposes: (1) it allows for the significant assessment of past events in order to better understand
their import. (2) it sensitizes to the importance of the present moment and to the necessity of seizing
present opportunities since they in turn will become the "stuff of history."

In addition to assigning periods and ages, the Guardian has also subdivided these ages into
epochs. The Universal House of Justice determined, in its message of 16 January 2001 to the
Bahá'ís of the world, that they were entering the fifth epoch of the Formative Age.[21] While it is
beyond the scope of this paper to give a detailed account of the determination of these epochs,[22]

one must bear in mind the following point in order to avoid confusion. A two-track chronology of
epochs is unfolding concurrently. While each of the Three Great Ages of the Bahá'í Faith is
subdivided into epochs, `Abdu'l-Bahá's Divine Plan, as contained in the Tablets of the Divine Plan
to the North American Bahá'ís (1916-1917), inaugurated another series of epochs.[23] The dates of
the first epoch of this Divine Plan are 1937-1963, corresponding to the inception of the First Seven
Year Plan (1937-1944) and concluding with the Ten Year World Crusade/Plan (1953-1963). We are
currently in the second epoch of `Abdu'l-Bahá's Divine Plan begun in 1964 with the Nine Year Plan
of the Universal House of Justice.

Such an assignment of ages and epochs is not without precedent in religious history. St.

Augustine in The City of God (Civitas Dei), which narrated the history of the world from creation to
the Last Judgement, and which attacked both the cyclical theory of history and the special destiny of
Rome, assigned a scheme of Six Ages based on divisions of Old Testament history, with each age
supposing to last for a thousand years, although Augustine softened this rigidity. The seventh age is
eternity. Augustine more or less absorbed these ages into the simpler scheme of the Three Eras: (1)
the Pre-Mosaic, or Pre-Legal. (2) the Legal which corresponded to the Mosaic Dispensation. (3) the
Era of Grace, i.e. the Christian Dispensation. He also assigned to his periodisation The Four World
Monarchies (Assyria, Persia, Greece and Rome), with Christ's kingdom being the Fifth Monarchy.
His new scheme was, of course, the two cities that coexist in history, Babylon and Jerusalem, the
earthly and the heavenly cities, of which all human beings are members.[24]

(3) History as Identity Creation: The Mission and Self-Consciousness of the North
American Bahá'í Community

In both The Advent of Divine Justice (1939) and the fifth world order letter "America and the
Most Great Peace" (1933), the Guardian sets out the divine mission and signal accomplishments of
the North American Bahá'ís whom he calls "the spiritual descendants of the dawn-breakers of a
heroic Age,"[25] the "champion-builders of the World Order of Bahá'u'lláh..."[26] and describes them
as holding a position of "undisputed leadership"[27] in the Bahá'í world. Preeminent among these
accomplishments is the establishment of the Administrative Order on the North American continent
and around the world and America's mission as the leading nation in the establishment of world
peace. In his eulogies of the North American Bahá'í community, eulogies that find their origin in the
writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi is accomplishing something remarkable. He is actually
creating a sense of historical self-consciousness which is a basic component of Bahá'í identity. In
the subsection entitled "Chief Remaining Citadel" in the opening pages of The Advent of Divine
Justice (1939), the Guardian makes a major new statement on the mission and station of the Bahá'í
community of North America. It is the identity-creating function of such passages that I am
emphasizing, rather than the preeminence of position of North America as Shoghi Effendi has
defined it. The following passage is only the preamble to a much longer eulogy, a text that is framed
by no less than 13 rhetorical questions without a single paragraph break. Along the lines of Arnold
Toynbee's "challenge and response" causal factor in making history,[28] this preamble establishes the
record of the achievements of the North American Bahá'ís, despite the considerable obstacles and
handicaps that confronted them. Each clause addresses a particular handicap or obstacle that has
been faced and successfully overcome:

> "A community, relatively negligible in its numerical strength; separated by vast distances
> from both the focal-center of its Faith and the land wherein the preponderating mass of its
> fellow-believers reside; bereft in the main of material resources and lacking in experience
> and in prominence; ignorant of the beliefs, concepts and habits of those peoples and races
from which its spiritual Founders have sprung; wholly unfamiliar with the languages in

which its sacred Books were originally revealed; constrained to place its sole reliance upon
> an inadequate rendering of only a fragmentary portion of the literature embodying its laws,
> its tenets, and its history; subjected from its infancy to tests of extreme severity, involving,
> at times, the defection of some of its most prominent members; having to contend, ever
> since its inception, and in an ever-increasing measure, with the forces of corruption, of
> moral laxity, and ingrained prejudice — such a community, in less than half a century, and
> unaided by any of its sister communities, whether in the East or in the West, has, by virtue
> of the celestial potency with which an all-loving Master has abundantly endowed it, lent an
> impetus to the onward march of the Cause it has espoused which the combined
> achievements of its coreligionists in the West have failed to rival."[29]
In such passages, the Guardian holds up the mirror of North American Bahá'í history in which this
community doubtless saw itself with new eyes and for the first time. At the same time, he also
provides a summary or outline of American Bahá'í history which future Bahá'í historians can use as
the basis for their research.

(4) Palingenesis and Transitional History

The Guardian wrote that contemporary history is marked by a "dual phenomenon," the
simultaneous disintegration and integration of the old and new world orders. The seminal passages
that speak of this dual phenomenon are absolutely central to Shoghi Effendi's thought. He cannot be
understood without our grasping this fundamental idea, for it is a leit-motif that runs through all his
writings:

> "We are indeed living in an age which, if we would correctly appraise it, should be
> regarded as one which is witnessing a dual phenomenon. The first signalizes the death
> pangs of an order, effete and godless, that has stubbornly refused, despite the signs and
> portents of a century-old Revelation, to attune its processes to the precepts and ideals
> which that Heaven-sent Faith proffered it. The second proclaims the birth pangs of an
> Order, divine and redemptive, that will inevitably supplant the former, and within Whose
> administrative structure an embryonic civilization, incomparable and world-embracing, is
> imperceptibly maturing. The one is being rolled up, and is crashing in oppression,
> bloodshed, and ruin. The other opens up vistas of a justice, a unity, a peace, a culture, such
> as no age has ever seen. The former has spent its force, demonstrated its falsity and
> barrenness, lost irretrievably its opportunity, and is hurrying to its doom. The latter, virile
> and unconquerable, is plucking asunder its chains, and is vindicating its title to be the one
refuge within which a sore-tried humanity, purged from its dross, can attain its destiny."[30]

The motif of death and rebirth alluded to in this passage is very ancient. While the Bahá'í
Faith rejects reincarnation, death and rebirth have both a scientific and conceptual usage in
biology,[31] philosophy and theology. According to Geoffrey Nash, it was used by the Romantics as
palingenesia[32] — the more usual biological term is palingenesis — and was employed, among
others, by the Pythagoreans to indicate metempsychosis, and by Schopenhauer to designate the
continued existence of the eternal will in each newborn individual.[33] The duality highlighted above
by Shoghi Effendi is found especially in his dyadic expressions "death pangs/birth pangs"[34] that
characterise the twin processes that define the modern age. These sets of binary relationships are
found in other passages of his writings such as the Arise and of fall," "integration and
disintegration," and "order and chaos, with their continuous and reciprocal reactions on each
other."[35] With this last phrase, Shoghi Effendi has foreshadowed one of the key ideas in modern

chaos theory. What first appears to the observer to be only chaos, when viewed in a longer and
larger perspective, may in fact signify the emergence of a new order of things. Thus the scientific,
religious and mythic views converge on the point that order proceeds, and must proceed, from
chaos. The stark contrast between these two simultaneous processes, the one a creative affirmation
of life, and the other a thanatopsis[36] of a doomed civilization, points to the profound truth that new
life springs from death in the grand continuum that is called existence. The death of the old world
order does not mean annihilation but resurrection.

Further, his view of history marks a transition from "brutal nationalism"[37] to fraternal
internationalism. Of this new age of fraternal internationalism, he wrote: "National rivalries,
hatreds, and intrigues will cease, and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial
amity, understanding and cooperation."[38] His view of history, moreover, points to the coming
maturity of the human race, "the coming of age of the entire human race," as it passes through its
stage of adolescence, which he called A...the most turbulent stage of its evolution....when the
impetuosity of youth and its vehemence reach their climax...:"[39]

"The ages of its infancy and childhood are past, never again to return, while the Great Age,
the consummation of all ages, which must signalize the coming of age of the entire human race, is
yet to come. The convulsions of this transitional and most turbulent period in the annals of
humanity are the essential prerequisites, and herald the inevitable approach, of that Age of Ages,
"the time of the end," in which the folly and tumult of strife that has, since the dawn of history,
blackened the annals of mankind, will have been finally transmuted into the wisdom and the
tranquility of an undisturbed, a universal, and lasting peace, in which the discord and separation of
the children of men will have given way to the worldwide reconciliation, and the complete
unification of the divers elements that constitute human society."[40]

(5)The Punctuation of Crises, Setbacks and Reverses

This next point I will touch on only briefly. The Guardian is emphatic that the history of
both the Bahá'í and non-Bahá'í world is punctuated by crises, setbacks and reverses. In his letter of
June 5, 1947 concerning the destiny of America, in which he acclaims "the immortal Woodrow
Wilson" and expatiates on the potentially beneficial "preponderating influence"[41] exercised by the
United States in world affairs, the Guardian wrote:

> "Many and divers are the setbacks and reverses which this nation, extolled so highly by
> `Abdu'l-Bahá, and occupying at present so unique a position among its fellow nations,
> must, alas, suffer. The road leading to its destiny is long, thorny and tortuous. The impact
> of various forces upon the structure and polity of that nation will be tremendous.
> Tribulations, on a scale unprecedented in its history, and calculated to purge its
> institutions, to purify the hearts of its people, to fuse its constituent elements, and to weld it
> into one entity with its sister nations in both hemispheres, are inevitable."[42]
The same is true of the relationship of the expansion of the Bahá'í Faith and its interactions with the
non-Bahá'í world. By means of crises, setbacks and reverses, opportunities are afforded to assist in
the spread and eventual universal recognition of the Bahá'í Faith. His interventionist concept of
history has it that the "Hand of Providence" may be seen to be working behind the scenes of world
events, a Hand that will advance the Bahá'í Cause, and hasten the final completion of the gestating
world order, until "...the consummation in world unity of the coming of age of the human race"
shall be realised."[43]

(6) The Retrospective

It is characteristic of Shoghi Effendi's sense of the auspicious passing of Bahá'í history to
pause for a timely retrospective. This retrospective, usually made on an anniversary or holy day,
provides the occasion for an evaluation or a summing up of the events that have carried the Bahá'í
Faith into the present. In 1934, as the passing years approached the centenary of the Declaration of
the Báb ten years later (1944), the Guardian engaged his readers in a review of the previous ninety
years. This period is viewed as one of remarkable achievements. The successes won are based upon
two major factors that become cornerstones in his view of history: (1) any present accomplishments
are built upon the solid achievements of the past. (2) any successful movement in history must be
grounded in divine truth.

> "On the 23rd of May of this auspicious year (1934) the Bahá'í world will celebrate the 90th
> anniversary of the founding of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh. We, who at this hour find ourselves
> standing on the threshold of the last decade of the first century of the Bahá'í era, might well
> pause to reflect upon the mysterious dispensations of so august, so momentous a
> Revelation. How vast, how entrancing the panorama which the revolution of four score
> years and ten unrolls before our eyes! Its towering grandeur well-nigh overwhelms us. To
> merely contemplate this unique spectacle, to visualize, however dimly, the circumstances
> attending the birth and gradual unfoldment of this supreme Theophany, to recall even in
> their barest outline the woeful struggles that proclaimed its rise and accelerated its march,
> will suffice to convince every unbiased observer of those eternal truths that motivate its
> life and which must continue to impel it forward until it achieves its destined
ascendancy."[44]

While engaging in this backward glance, the Guardian assures his readers that the events
that have transpired within the 90 year period are a sufficient guarantee of any future successes that
the Faith will achieve: A...to visualize, however dimly, the circumstances attending the birth and
gradual unfoldment of this supreme Theophany... will suffice to convince every unbiased observer
of those eternal truths that motivate its life and which must continue to impel it forward until it
achieves its destined ascendancy."[45] This is what might be called the proof from history.

(7) Teleological History (Gk. Telos: end or goal)

Whatever current theories of the philosophy of history may be, it is abundantly clear that the
Guardian's view of history is decidedly teleological (Gr. telos, end, completion). But teleology,
since it constitutes a predictive grand scheme, runs counter to the spirit of the postmodern mind and
is currently out of intellectual favour. The incisive Northrop Frye has remarked upon the loss of this
teleological sense in modern times: "One of the most striking cultural facts of our time is the
disappearance of this teleological sense. We tend now to think of our lives as being, like the long
poem described by Poe,[46] a discontinuous sequence of immediate experiences."[47] However,
philosopher of critical realism[48] and poet George Santayana, in explaining Herbert Spencer's views
on evolution and substance, has argued that A...evolution must have a goal, it must unfold a germ in
a determinate direction towards an implicit ideal; otherwise there would be no progress involved, no
means of distinguishing changes for the better from changes for the worse."[49] Teleology, in our
context, means that the Mind of God has determined the end-goal of human history and ultimately
directs the historical process toward its achievement. The origins of teleology are found not only in
rudimentary Greek science and philosophy; they are also Judaic in that history is seen to be moving
toward the coming of the Messianic Kingdom. Yairah Amit, a contemporary Jewish scholar, has

clearly articulated this view and how it contrasted markedly from the mythical sense of time in the
religions that preceded Judaism.

The concept of divinity as developed in biblical literature is of a single universal deity who
manifests himself in history, conducts a continuous dialogue, direct or indirect, with humankind,
and is not only a cosmic divinity in command of nature, but also a kind of providence, supervising
human history and directing it. This concept gave rise to a new attitude to history, which came to
replace mythology.[50]

But here is Shoghi Effendi's seminal text on this theme:
"The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, whose supreme mission is none other but the achievement
> of this organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations, should, if we be faithful to
> its implications, be regarded as signalizing through its advent the coming of age of the
> entire human race. It should be viewed not merely as yet another spiritual revival in the
> ever-changing fortunes of mankind, not only as a further stage in a chain of progressive
> Revelations, nor even as the culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles,
> but rather as marking the last and highest stage in the stupendous evolution of man's
> collective life on this planet. The emergence of a world community, the consciousness of
> world citizenship, the founding of a world civilization and culture — all of which must
> synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of the Golden Age of the Baha'i Era
> — should, by their very nature, be regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as the
> furthermost limits in the organization of human society, though man, as an individual, will,
> nay must indeed as a result of such a consummation, continue indefinitely to progress and
> develop."[51]

(8) Organically Whole History

One of the central concepts of the seventh world order letter, "The Unfoldment of World
Civilization" is the presence and maintenance of "an organic and spiritual unity," also described
simply as "organic unity." This key phrase applies not only to the internal workings of the Bahá'í
Faith and its institutions but also to the future unified body of nations. This central concept is in turn
linked to, and coherent with, another reality mentioned in the second world order letter, "The Goal
of a New World Order" (1930), that of the "living organism." The concept of organic unity is
closely tied to the last feature to be considered of Shoghi Effendi's concept of history — that Bahá'í
history itself is an organic whole. The Guardian's schema clearly reflects a particular understanding
of Bahá'í history as a process of orderly, holistic, evolutionary growth that drives toward self-
fulfilment. Writing of the four periods that he identified in the first Bahá'í century in God Passes
By, the Guardian wrote:

> "To isolate any one of them from the others, to dissociate the later manifestations of one
> universal, all-embracing Revelation from the pristine purpose that animated it in its earliest
> days, would be tantamount to a mutilation of the structure on which it rests, and to a
> lamentable perversion of its truth and of its history....These four periods are to be regarded
> not only as the component, the inseparable parts of one stupendous whole, but as
> progressive stages in a single evolutionary process, vast, steady and irresistible. For as we
> survey the entire range which the operation of a century-old Faith has unfolded before us,
> we cannot escape the conclusion that from whatever angle we view this colossal scene, the
> events associated with these periods present to us unmistakable evidences of a slowly
maturing process, of an orderly development, of internal consolidation, of external

expansion, of a gradual emancipation from the fetters of religious orthodoxy, and of a
corresponding diminution of civil disabilities and restrictions."[52]

A "vital link" has connected these Three Ages. The Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá
"...has forged the vital link which must for ever connect the age that has just expired
[Primitive/Apostolic/Heroic Age] with the one we now live in — the Transitional and Formative
period of the Faith...."[53] His faith in the ultimate ascendancy of the Bahá'í Cause is based upon a
firm conviction that the movement has taken root in the fertile soil of what the Greek fathers of the
apostolic church called the logos spermatikos [54] which described the fecundating power of the
Holy Word. Seed imagery is not, of course, exclusive to the Christian tradition. Just as the Báb
referred to the Bayán as being in the stage of seed,[55] Shoghi Effendi makes use of this seed
imagery to indicate evolution or gradation, in a process of gradual unfoldment with respect to the
Three Ages of the Bábí-Bahá'í Faith: "The period in which the seed of the Faith had been slowly
germinating [Heroic Age] is thus intertwined both with the one which must witness its efflorescence
[Formative Age] and the subsequent age in which that seed will have finally yielded its golden
fruit." [Golden Age].[56] This is obviously an image of organic wholeness.

Conclusion

I have argued in this paper that the Guardian's writings reflect an orderly, evolutionary,
dynamic and coherent concept of Bahá'í history. While Shoghi Effendi views of modern Bahá'í
history are clearly at odds with current postmodern theories of history, which reject grand narratives
and predictive teleological schemes, these elements are clearly present in the Guardian's concept.
His view of history is both theological and dogmatic in that restores the workings of Providence to
historical events. Central to his understanding is the interactive nature of the moribund old world
order and the ascendant new one, through the "dual phenomenon" of palingenesis, by which the
Bahá'í Revelation simultaneously brings about the death of the old order while it simultaneously
builds up the life-giving institutions of the New World Order of Bahá'u'lláh.
