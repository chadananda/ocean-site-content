Since the publication of The social construction of reality by Peter
Berger and Thomas Luckmann1 in 1967, it has become generally accepted
among sociologists and scholars on culture that generations of human beings
create a culture (symbols, concepts, institutions and rituals) communally
and socially that later generations then treat and react to as though they
were taken-for-granted and unalterable reality. This process has now been
discussed exhaustively by sociologists and other academic disciplines and
the field of the Sociology of Knowledge has been created. One particularly
interesting aspect of this discussion has been the idea of tropes of history, as
advanced by Hayden White in Tropics of discourse,2 within the framework
of which a historian writes and which then sets the pattern of what aspects
of the historical data will be examined and how they will be seen. Another
development in a parallel field was Thomas Kuhn’s description in The
structure of scientific revolutions3 of how scientists change from one
scientific framework to another, such as the change from the Ptolemaic
version of the universe to the Copernican one. This he calls the “paradigm
shift”. I have tried to show in my book The phenomenon of religion4 that
religious conversion (a change in religious reality) parallels in many ways
the changes described by Kuhn as a “paradigm shift”.

Academic studies on culture change have concentrated in looking
at factors such as technological change, environmental factors and influences
from other cultures, which produce culture change and hence a new social
reality. In this paper, however, I wish to look at one aspect of this concept of
the social construction of reality and the idea of a change in this reality that
has not been studied much: the question of how a group can set out
deliberately to change reality. The subject of this paper, the world-wide
Bahá’í community has, according to its explicit texts, been setting out to do
just that − to change reality, to change the way that human beings see the
world. Over a hundred years ago, its founder Bahá’u’lláh (1817-1892) talked
about “a new world order”5 and interpreted the biblical prophecies of the
“end of the world” and the “Day of Resurrection” as being references to the
end of one religious/cultural world and the birth of a new one.6

There are many aspects to the ways in which Bahá’u’lláh has sought
to change reality. His primary purpose, he states, was to create a new global
consciousness, such that human beings would stop thinking of themselves
in terms of narrow national, ethnic, religious and caste identities and think
in terms of a single new global identity: “The earth is but one country, and
mankind its citizens.”7 Another change in thinking is that humanity has been
used to thinking of human beings as being inherently war-like and
competitive. The long-standing view that war is an inherent part of human
life was reinforced by the ideas of Darwinian evolutionary theory and the
struggle for survival. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844-1921), the son of Bahá’u’lláh
and his successor as head of the Bahá’í Faith, travelled throughout Europe
and North America in the years before the First World War, warning about
the consequences of this idea and urging the nations of the world to turn
aside from the path towards war and adopt a new way of thinking. Whilst in
London in 1911, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is reported to have said:

> the light.8

‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke of the need for changing our symbolic universe
in order to bring about a change of reality. Concerning the meaning of words
related to war and competitiveness, for example, he stated that regarding
the word “victory”, for the Bahá’í Cause: “its victory is to submit and yield”9
and quotes Bahá’u’lláh as stating:

> Therefore, today, “victory” neither hath been, nor will be
> opposition to anyone, nor strife with any person; but rather
> what is well-pleasing-this is, that the cities of men’s hearts,
> which are under the dominion of the hosts of selfishness and
> lust, should be subdued by the sword of the Word of Wisdom,
> and of Exhortation.10

Similarly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá subverts the concept of competition from
its usual role in a competitive society, that of gaining power, and instead
promotes it as an approach in the arena of service: “Vie ye with each other
in the service of God and of His Cause. This is indeed what profiteth you in
this world, and in that which is to come.”11 The goal of personal ambition
and the source of greatest glory do not belong, in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s estimation,

to the person who seizes power and exerts control, but to the person who
excels in service to “human uplift and betterment”12 and to “the cause of the
Most Great Peace.”13

Hierarchical social structures as reality

There are many aspects to the changes in social reality that the
Bahá’í teachings are trying to bring about. In order to bring this paper down
to a manageable length, however, we will concentrate on one particular
practical area: the changes in social structure and power relationships that
the Bahá’í community is trying to institute. This area has the advantage that
we are able to look not only at the scriptures of the Bahá’í Faith but also at
the practical steps that Bahá’í communities are taking at the local level.

For about five thousand years, human beings have been living in
cities.14 This move from living in small widely dispersed communities to a
situation where large numbers are confined within the protective walls of a
city produced a profound change in human affairs − in human social
structures and humanity’s consciousness. Indeed the profundity of this change
in embedded in language itself. The word “civilization” and all that it
connotes of human advancement and culture comes from the Latin root
civis, meaning “city”, while the word “politics” and all that it connotes of
ordering society stems from the Greek word polis, also meaning “city”. The
main effect that it had on human society was to move human society from a
comparatively flat social structure with much consultation among society’s
elders (which still exists today in some primal societies15) to a much more
steeply pyramidal, more authoritarian structure with usually a single person

(or a small clique) at the head of the pyramid and the masses having little
say in social decision-making. This pyramidal structure occurs not just in
the political structure but also in business and industry, in religion, in most
voluntary associations and even in most families. At the head of the social
pyramid, in Europe and the Americas, are a few white middle-class or upper
class men. Supporting them are the remaining middle class and upper class
white men. This small group of people maintains a hegemonic leadership
over the base of the pyramid, which is composed of everyone else. Indeed if
one considers that half of society is women and then adds in the various
ethnic and class groups, one can see that in Western societies, where everyone
is supposed to be equal, it is only a small percentage who are at the top of
the social hierarchy and who have full access to the benefits and
opportunities, while the majority are a good deal less “equal” than them.

It had been over a hundred years now that people have been
criticising and acknowledging the faults of the hegemonic pyramidal nature
of human society.16 This criticism has become more vocal in recent years,
as people identify more and more of the disadvantages that accrue from the
hierarchical structure, especially as the attitudes and values of it feed out
from the central political structures to the corporate world and even into the
family. Feminists have attributed the patriarchal society (a society in which
men rule) in which we live to its highly-competitive, pyramidal structure
(women are by nature less competitive and therefore will always do worse
in a highly competitive environment; they do much better in co-operative,
caring environments17) and have also blamed it for the attitudes that result
in domestic violence and violence against women in general.18 Similarly,
environmentalists and anti-globalization protestors have identified the highly
competitive nature of industry as a leading cause of pollution and poor
corporate social practices (such as relocating jobs to places were employment

16 These criticisms have classically varied from Karl Marx’s criticisms of the hierarchical
class structure, Antonio Gramsci’s criticism of the cultural hegemony that maintains capitalist societies − see
note 19.

costs and environmental standards are lower without regard for the social
consequences).19

It is easier, however, to criticise hierarchical societies than to do
anything to change them. There have been a number of attempts to change
this pyramidal structure of society for a more equalitarian flatter one.
Democracy was intended to produce this result and, while it may have had
some success, the structure that is common in many democratic societies is
that of a powerful presidential figure and a small elite who hold all the
power for a fixed number of years. In other words, the pyramidal structure
remains; it is just that the people at the top may change every few years. The
French Revolution and the various Communist Revolutions that have
occurred have all been in the name of creating a more egalitarian society.
They too failed, having succeeded only in replacing one group at the top of
the pyramid with another group.

The hierarchical or hegemonic society is very stable and difficult
to change for three reasons. The first reason is that this hierarchical picture
of the world is seen as the taken-for-granted reality, the unalterable norm
for human society.20 Those who claim otherwise, who say that it is possible
to create a non-hierarchical society based on co-operation, are seen as wooly-
minded dreamers who are ignoring the harsh facts of life. The second reason
is that in a society where power and might prevail, the only way that a new
philosophy or movement can replace the old is to gain power and to use that
to introduce the new view. Thus, if one’s aim is to produce a society that is
less based on power and competitiveness, the only way of getting this view
noticed is to compromise on the view itself. Those that led the French or the
various Communist Revolutions in the name of a more egalitarian society
were however forced to seize power and in doing so found their initial values
subverted. The result was a society that was just as hierarchical as before,
but with merely a different set of people in power. George Orwell’s Animal

20 Antonio Gramsci developed the idea of the hegemonic leadership of the dominant group in
his Prison Notebooks; see Dominic Strinati, An introduction to theories of popular culture. Routledge,
London, 1995. See especially p. 165-9.

História: Questões & Debates, Curitiba, n. 43, p. 13-32, 2005. Editora UFPR

farm21 brilliantly describes this process. The values of power and
competitiveness are thus subversive of anyone who tries to overthrow them.22
A further reason that makes it difficult to achieve any change is that in
patriarchal societies, it is very difficult to even gain an acknowledgement of
the fact that a problem exists. It is men from the dominant group who control
the communications media and the education system; it is they who are the
journalists, the newspaper editors, the social analysts, the professors of so-
cial sciences and these men experience no barriers and therefore see no
problem. Such men will often assert that there are no barriers in their society
because they experience none – and therefore there is no need for any change.
The rhetoric coming from these leaders of society is that their societies are
fair and democratic with equal opportunities for all. It is the women who
experience the “glass ceiling” in their careers; it is the ethnic minorities
who are automatically given the low-grade and low-paying jobs with no
possibility of advancement. But the voices of these are not heard; their
complaint of inequality is not acknowledged and the fiction of a fair and
free society continues.23

The Bahá’í teachings on equality and globalisation

The Bahá’í teachings, as has already been indicated above, aim to
create a new global consciousness among human beings. Human beings
need to transcend their narrow partisan identities that have been the basis of
hatred, conflict and war. The world in which we are living is already unified
in terms of communications, travel, finance, trade and knowledge and even
the diversity of cultures, languages and belief systems that exist are becoming

increasingly available to all. This is the physical reality that already exists.
The Bahá’í position is that human thinking needs to come into line with it.24

Bahá’ís consider that human beings need to think in terms of the
unity of all humanity. Rather than conceptualising society as an army with a
general at its head, we need to switch to thinking of human society in organic
terms. Just as the head, the heart, the skin and even the bones have an
important part to play in the human body and each is dependent on the
other, human beings must learn that all elements in this global society are
interdependent and therefore equally important.

Changing reality: the structure of the Bahá’í community

Many writers have, however, written persuasively about the equality
of human beings and about the need for more egalitarian societies.26 As

26 Liberty and Equality were the aims of the French Revolution. The classless society and full
human freedom would of course, according to the vision of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, be the result of
the Communist Revolution.

História: Questões & Debates, Curitiba, n. 43, p. 13-32, 2005. Editora UFPR

pointed out above, however, most of these have produced no practical plan
for bringing this about. And where there has been a plan of action, such as
with the Communist Manifesto, it has failed to produce its intended effect.
It is indeed hard to change reality, especially those parts of reality that are
as deeply embedded as are hierarchical social structures.

The interesting aspect of the Bahá’í community is that it claims to
have a plan for the creation of an alternative vision of the world and its
present activities are designed to gradually put this plan into effect. Some
of the features of the Bahá’í administrative structure and its functioning
will now be described to demonstrate how it is creating a new social reality.
Such a survey is necessarily brief and readers are referred to more detailed
descriptions of the Bahá’í Faith for more information.27

The basic structure of the Bahá’í administrative order looks
superficially similar to other democratic systems of governance. It has elected
councils at local, national and international levels which administer the affairs
of the Bahá’ís. When one looks in detail at this system, however, one finds
many unusual features, most of which relate specifically to the idea that
authority in the Bahá’í community is not vested in individuals but in the
elected bodies themselves. There are no priests, prophets or learned classes
in the Bahá’í community. The individual members of the elected councils
have no authority of their own. If, for example, a member of the national
elected council lives in a particular town, he or she has no individual authority
by virtue of being on the national council and is under the authority of the
local elected council in that town. It is only the elected council as a body
taking decisions that has authority in the Bahá’í community. Thus power
and authority are taken away from individuals.

One of the most important provisions in the Bahá’í scriptures is the
concept of the Covenant. According to this doctrine, although all Bahá’ís
have the right and indeed the duty to study the scriptures for themselves,
they do not have the right to say that their understanding is the correct
understanding or is authoritative. Only the interpretations of the Bahá’í
scriptures by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the son and successor of Bahá’u’lláh, and that

27 See for example, Wendi Momen, Understanding the Baha’i Faith. Edinburgh: Dunedin
Academic Press, 2006, for a general outline. More references regarding specific points are given with the
relevant paragraphs below.

História: Questões & Debates, Curitiba, n. 43, p. 13-32, 2005. Editora UFPR

of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s grandson and successor Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957) are
authoritative. The interpretations of all other Bahá’ís have an equal non-
binding and non-authoritative standing in the community. This again is
intended to prevent the emergence of hierarchies based on knowledge and
power, the creation of factions and sects around the viewpoints of learned
or charismatic figures.28

One of the features of the Bahá’í administrative structure designed
to prevent the emergence of hierarchical social structures is the Bahá’í
electoral system, which is in many ways the opposite of the highly competitive
and power-driven Western party system. The creation of political parties,
party platforms, manifestoes and indeed all nominations and electioneering
are prohibited in Bahá’í elections. The duty of the electors in a Bahá’í election
is to consider and reflect carefully on the qualities of all of the Bahá’ís
whom they know and who are eligible for election and then to choose the
nine persons who are best suited to the task of administering the Bahá’í
community.29 One aspect of the functioning of the Bahá’í community that is
unusual by the standards of Western elections is that once elected, the
members of these councils are not answerable to their electorates. They do
not therefore need to respond to the passing whims of the masses who tend
to over-react to every passing event and are easily manipulated by
newspapers and television. They are only answerable to God and their own
consciences for their decisions.30

Another feature of the Bahá’í administration, which − it is claimed
− helps in the breaking down of hierarchical structures, is the principle of
subsidiarity. In most government systems, unless there are strong safeguards,
power tends to accumulate at the top and be removed from the lower tiers of

government.31 In the Bahá’í administration, however, there is a clear mandate
that whatever decisions can be made at the local level should be made by
the local elected councils and only those that have ramifications beyond the
local or which need to be co-ordinated at the national level should be taken
at that level, and so forth. There is a principle that authority should be
decentralized as far as possible.32 Thus for example, in the early stages of
the development of the Bahá’í Faith, the administration of the Bahá’í world
and the making of plans for its expansion was done centrally in Haifa by
Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, the international elected
council that is the supreme authority in the Bahá’í world at the present time.
Detailed plans were then sent to the various national communities for them
to carry out. As the various national elected bodies of the Bahá’í world
matured, the Universal House of Justice increasingly devolved upon them
the authority to make their own plans and carry these out.33

One can even see the Bahá’í refusal to take part in party politics as
an expression of its determination to create a new social reality.34 We have
already seen that the hierarchical society cannot be overturned by
participating in its processes. Those who have taken this approach have
ended by compromising their values and perpetuating hierarchical social
structures and the associated values of power and competitiveness. Thus
the Bahá’í refusal to participate in party politics is entirely logical and an
inherent part of its strategy for changing society. Participation in party politics
would result not only in disunity among the Bahá’ís but would compromise
the very values upon which the Bahá’ís are trying to build their new reality.

Organizational theory and the study of state and local parties, in W. J. Crotty (ed.), Approaches to the study
of party organization. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1968. p. 375- 403. As an example of this process, see the

The functioning of the community as a means of changing
reality

Within the Bahá’í community, there are aspects of its functioning
which are themselves tools for changing reality. When laying down plans
for the expansion of the Bahá’í community, Shoghi Effendi, the second
successor to Bahá’u’lláh, deliberately urged the Bahá’ís to seek out every
tribal group, minority ethnic group and social group and to try to bring
these into the Bahá’í community.35 In this way, he brought into a concrete
visualised reality Bahá’u’lláh’s concept of the unity and interconnectedness
of all humanity. By bringing together widely diverse cultures and peoples
and resolving the inevitable clashes and problems that arise in an ambit of
unity, prayer and love, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi assisted the Bahá’ís
to overcome the hatreds and prejudices that are an inherent part of all human
cultures.

A very important part of the functioning of the Bahá’í community
is the mechanism of consultation.36 All decision-making on the elected
councils and their committees is through this process, but ‘Abdul-Bahá
encourages its use in other situations also and Bahá’ís use it in making
personal or family decisions, in the work-place, in studying the scripture in
groups, in all situations where truth and guidance are sought. The rules of
Bahá’í consultation are that it should be carried out in a prayerful and
considered way; that the opinions of all present should be sought and treated
respectfully; that once an opinion is put forward, it should be detached from
its presenter and discussed without reference to personalities; that the facts
should be ascertained first, before discussion of possible solutions is started.
The qualities of Bahá’í consultation are described by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as being:

35 During the successive international plans of the Bahá’í world community, increasing the
diversity of the Bahá’í community was a prominent oart of the goals and achievements. See for example the
list of tribes and ethnic groups represented in the Bahá’í Faith in The Bahá’í Faith 1844-1963: information
statistical and comparative. Haifa: Hands of the Cause Residing in the Holy Land, [1963], p. 15-20; and the
statement in The seven year plan, 1979-1986: statistical report. Haifa: Universal House of Justice, 1986. p.
61-64.

> The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are
> purity of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else
> save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and
> lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience and long-suffering
> in difficulties and servitude to His exalted Threshold.37

The Bahá’í process of consultation is thus one which encourages
all those taking part to participate. This helps to draw out women, members
of minority groups and races as well as lower social classes who do not feel
confident enough to speak in group settings. The Bahá’í ideal of consultation
provides a safe and encouraging environment for such people to express
their views. Indeed, just as men are better at competition, women are
inherently better in the co-operative environment produced by the
consultation process.38 In such an environment, they therefore feel
comfortable in putting forward their views (which is not the case in a highly
competitive environment) and they are able to play a major role in Bahá’í
community life. Thus the process of consultation breaks down the domination
of social processes by the dominant elements in society, which, in Europe
and most of the Americas, tend to be white, middle class and upper class
men.

Changing the reality of power and authority

Another interesting aspect of the Bahá’í community arises from an
attempt to separate power and authority. In the present world, power and
authority are assumed to be inextricably linked. It is assumed that in a well-
run and well-ordered society, it is necessary that whichever individuals are
given authority should automatically receive the power with which to enforce
that authority. It is assumed that if power does not accompany authority,
disorder will arise because the institution having authority will lack the power
to carry out its orders. In the Bahá’í community, the ethos is entirely different.

There is an attempt to separate authority and power to some extent. We
have noted above that individuals have neither authority nor power in the
Bahá’í community. The elected institutions of the Bahá’í community have
the authority to direct the affairs of the community, but their obligation is to
try to achieve their objectives through winning the support of the generality
of the Bahá’í community. Shoghi Effendi, addressing primarily the members
of the elected Bahá’í institutions, states:

> Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is
> not dictatorial authority but humble fellowship, not arbitrary
> power, but the spirit of frank and loving consultation. Nothing
> short of the spirit of a true Bahá’í can hope to reconcile the
> principles of mercy and justice, of freedom and submission, of
> the sanctity of the right of the individual and of self-surrender,
> of vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one hand, and
> fellowship, candour, and courage on the other.39

The elected Bahá’í institutions have in effect very little power to
enforce their authority in many areas when compared with the central
authorities of other religions. They have no doctrinal authority; no authority
to determine correct doctrine or to create new doctrine or theological
teachings, nor to interpret the texts of the scripture. Thus they hold no power
in many areas over which religious leadership has traditionally held both
power and authority. They have the authority to direct the Bahá’í community
by laying out plans of action for the Bahá’ís, but they have no sanctions or
other means of compelling the Bahá’ís to carry out these plans. If Bahá’ís,
for example, want to completely ignore the present Five Year Plan of the
Universal House of Justice, they are free to do so without any fear of sanctions
against them. The general situation is summed up in the words of the Uni-
versal House of Justice thus:

> Authority and direction flow from the Assemblies, whereas the
> power to accomplish the tasks resides primarily in the entire
> body of the believers.40

The power that the elected institutions have over the Bahá’ís can
only be exercised in extreme situations and is thus rarely encountered by
the average Bahá’í. This power involves Bahá’ís whose actions go outside
certain limits. These include for example administrative sanctions against
Bahá’ís who are public about their disregard for the Bahá’í moral code: for
example by being intoxicated in public or publically and flagrantly breaking
Bahá’í sexual morality (note that what Bahá’ís do privately is not a cause of
action by the Bahá’í institutions). More severe sanctions are taken towards
those who seek to create division and sectarianism in the Bahá’í community
(note that holding differing opinions is not sanctionable, it is only when an
individual attempts to create a sect or grouping around such an opinion that
sanctions may be applied). The overwhelming majority of Bahá’ís will not
however experience this.

It may even be said that leadership, whether from the individuals
who succeeded Bahá’u’lláh as leaders of the Bahá’í community, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, or the administrative institutions which now
administer the community, is seen not as the instrument of power and
authority but rather as an opportunity for service. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s name
means “The servant of Bahá’ [u’lláh]”. He wrote:

> My name is Abdu’l-Bahá. My qualification is Abdu’l-Bahá.
> My reality is Abdu’l-Bahá. My praise is Abdu’l-Bahá. Thraldom
> to the Blessed Perfection is my glorious and refulgent diadem,
> and servitude to all the human race my perpetual religion (...)
> No name, no title, no mention, no commendation have I, nor
> will ever have, except Abdu’l-Bahá. This is my longing. This
> is my greatest yearning. This is my eternal life. This is my
> everlasting glory.”41

40 From a letter of the Universal House of Justice to Continental Boards of Counsellors and
National Spiritual Assemblies, October 1, 1969, in The Continental Boards of Counsellors, Wilmette, IL:
Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1981. p. 37-38. See also words of Shoghi Effendi in Citadel of Faith: messages to
America 1947-1957. Wilmette, IL: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1965. p. 130-31.

Trust, 1991. p. 139.

História: Questões & Debates, Curitiba, n. 43, p. 13-32, 2005. Editora UFPR

Shoghi Effendi signed his letters in English “Your true brother,
Shoghi” and regarded his station as that of servitude to the Master [‘Abdu’l-
Bahá]:

> May I also express my heartfelt desire that the friends of God
> in every land regard me in no other light but that of a true
> brother, united with them in our common servitude to the
> Master’s Sacred Threshold, and refer to me in their letters and
> verbal addresses always as Shoghi Effendi, for I desire to be
> known by no other name save the one our Beloved Master was
> wont to utter, a name which of all other designations is the
> most conducive to my spiritual growth and advancement.42

The spirit animating the elected institutions of the Bahá’í community
should also be, as the quotation cited above states, that of “humble
fellowship” and “frank and loving consultation”. And the qualities that those
who engage in consultation should strive for include, as described above:
“purity of motive,(...) detachment from all else save God,(...) humility and
lowliness amongst His loved ones,(...) servitude to His exalted Threshold”;
all qualities that are the exact opposite of those normally associated with
positions of power and authority. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated, regarding the
members of these elected institutions:

> Now they (the members) must, in perfect spirit and fragrance,
> in sincerity of heart, in attraction by the fragrances of God and
> by the confirmations of the Holy Spirit, engage in service; in
> the promotion of the Word of God; the diffusion of the
> fragrances of God; the training of souls; the promulgation of
> the Most Great Peace.43

This can be visualised by saying that whereas the current model of
social structure is that of a pyramid of power and authority, the model in the
Bahá’í community is an inverse pyramid with the ordinary Bahá’ís at the

top, holding the power to carry forward the religion, and the institutions,
who hold authority, below them, serving the ordinary Bahá’ís.44

Conclusion: the pathway to changing reality

As indicated above, the Bahá’ís are doing many things in moving
towards a change of reality. They are building up a non-hierarchical
administrative system where individuals do not have either power or
authority; their consultative decision-making processes encourage those who
often feel most oppressed and alienated in modern society to express
themselves and participate in social action; they have established institutions
that aim to serve rather than to exert power and authority; their aim is a new
global consciousness of human unity.

Moving human beings from one reality to another is inevitably a
slow and painstaking process. Human beings are comfortable in their current
reality and an effort is needed to change it. Just because a human being
accepts the intellectual argument that a change of reality is needed does not
mean that patterns of behaviour that are deeply ingrained in the culture can
be discarded overnight. Progress is invariably slow and must be taken in
small steps each building on the one before.

The Bahá’í community is currently engaged in a Five Year Plan as
a stage in its development. The goals of this plan are closely aligned with
the breaking down of old patterns of thought associated with the old
hierarchical social reality and creating new patterns of behaviour and thought
aligned with the new social reality. In its writngs, the Universal House of
Justice has written of “a change in the culture of the [Bahá’í] community”.45
The old reality that the Universal House of Justice has stated it is seeking to
free the Bahá’í community from is one which is dominated by

> society − in which the believer is a member of a congregation,

The passivity implied in being a “member of a congregation” is
that of the masses who are not used to taking the initiative, who are not used
to being consulted and who are used to waiting for instructions to come
from high. The new social reality cannot come about unless the individuals
who form part of it are transformed and are fully taking part in the new
culture. Through the establishment of training institutes and the participation
of every Bahá’í in programmes aimed at inducing reflective thought and
encouraging participative consultation, the whole of the Bahá’í community
(which up to this point has had the general features of a congregation) is
being stimulated to arise to the sort of level of individual initiative, group
consultation and participative action that will enable the vision of a new
reality to take concrete form. The overall aim is to increase the human
resources in the Bahá’í community and to have universal participation in
programmes of social action which have arisen out of consultative proces-
ses. In these ways, Bahá’ís believe that a new social reality is slowly but
steadily emerging within the Bahá’í community and the Universal House of
Justice has already spoken of presenting the Bahá’í community as a model
for how the global unity advocated by Bahá’u’lláh over one hundred years
ago can be achieved.47
