A New Skin for an Old Drum:
Changing Contexts of Yukon Aboriginal
Bahá’í Storytelling
Lynn Echevarria

Abstract: This article examines the construction of the religious self through the
storytelling processes of Yukon Aboriginal Bahá’ís. Previous anthropological work
has studied the social factors involved in the maintenance of faith amongst Aboriginal
Bahá’ís. This sociological study focuses on the manner in which people put together
stories to construct their contemporary Bahá’í identity. Examining recorded life
histories, public stories, and archival materials, I present one perspective on how
people story their religious identities in changing historical contexts.

Background to the Study
In 2003, I was the recipient of funding from the Northern Research Institute to
conduct a qualitative research project. The focus of the project was twofold:
to recuperate materials about the history of Yukon Bahá’is,1 and to record life
histories of Aboriginal women in this community.

Between the years 1960–1975, 204 people became Bahá’ís in the Yukon,
104 of which were from one family—the Johns (Tagish Nation).2 Since the
beginning of the religion in the Yukon (1953), materials such as oral recordings,
archival paper records, family pamphlets, and other written works have
become widely disseminated. My intent was to bring the materials together,
catalogue them, and then deposit them in the Yukon Archives. There they
would be protected for posterity and accessible to local Bahá’ís, the interested
public, and researchers.3

The initiative to record life histories of Aboriginal women arose from
my doctoral work on religion and identity in the lives of elderly Canadian
Bahá’í women.4 I was not able to include any Aboriginal women in this study
(1990s) because the women who were early Bahá’ís had passed away. And

The Northern Review 29 (Fall 2008): 39–62                                          39

although I had been advised to record Yukon stories, I was not able to travel
to the North for various reasons. It was serendipitous for me, then, to acquire
a position at Yukon College in 2002.

In my first few months in Whitehorse I learned a number of significant
things that encouraged me to embark on further research here. Aboriginal
elders had approved documentation of their stories and histories in the
English language—a significant boon and encouragement for a non-
Aboriginal researcher. I knew the anthropological research of fifty years
of Yukon cultural history would provide contextual material, and recent
work5 oﬀered the opportunity to study rare interviews of deceased and
contemporary Bahá’ís. As well, the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary
of the Bahá’í Faith in the Yukon was to take place in 2003. This meant that
local people and those that had moved away would be coming together for
a reunion to celebrate and share their reminiscences—a prime opportunity
for a researcher to engage in participant observation and documentation.6
Finally, I learned that no in-depth life history project had been conducted to
record personal stories of religiosity, and no full story had been contributed
to local families’ histories. There was, then, a possibility to contribute to local
women’s history by recording life stories. (For those interested in further
details about my methodology, see this note7).

As a sociologist, I am interested in how people, particularly women,
make meaning of their lives and how they translate that meaning into
action through social processes. I share a community of meaning with the
participants based on our membership in the same religion. I also share,
with contemporary scholars, an academic interest in agency, resistance,
and strategies for survival. My academic work is grounded in symbolic
interactionism, which recognizes that identities are multi-dimensional, and
personal stories are filled with ambiguities, tensions, and contradictions,
as well as intersubjectivity.8 However, if you are looking for an analysis
that would tease out such findings, you will not find it here.9 This article
focuses, instead, on experiences the individuals willingly oﬀered and found
important to mention, in the context of their becoming, or being Bahá’ís. In
no way is it an authoritative explanation of Bahá’í storytelling in the Yukon.
It remains for Yukon Aboriginal peoples themselves, if and when they deem
it necessary, to explore and interpret the full range of elements involved in
identity formation and sacralization.

Long Ago Stories: Types and Functions
Much has been written about the importance of oral tradition in the lives of
peoples worldwide, and a large academic literature has been established,
which documents genres of narratives and many aspects of storytelling,
such as how stories are told, and what functions they hold for listeners.10 The
sharing of memories and narratives in a group provides significant “clues
to the past,” and “windows on the making and remaking of individual and
collective consciousness.”11 Stories are told to live with and to make sense
of social change and everyday relations. They oﬀer metaphors, analogies,
and storylines that provide a foundation upon which to build present-
day understandings. As well, people will find new meaning in old stories
according to their contemporary cultural environment.

Yukon Aboriginal storyteller and cultural educator, Louise Profeit-
LeBlanc12 has identified four categories of stories in Yukon Aboriginal
traditional storytelling: classic stories, which include the creation story—for
example, how crow made the universe, how man became a human being;
regional stories, which resemble folklore stories from other cultures such
as how the south wind came to be, and which talk about certain Yukon
environmental characteristics and about relationships of people with actual
places; familial stories are those that are specific to individual families; and
communal stories are accounts of events that took place in the local community
(usually also kin-based).

The past functions of Yukon First Nations’ storytelling tradition were
many. They helped people know about the range of human virtues and
about how people overcame animal qualities and became fully human; they
taught about the law of the land and the history of the people; they inspired
by sharing tragedies; and they entertained with humorous stories. Many
traditional stories were used to orient people to the social order, and to their
position in that order, as well as to teach them how to survive on the land.13

In listening to sound recordings of early public meetings and recorded
life histories, as well as reading and listening to contemporary accounts, an
important function of these present-day stories seems to be the same as in
the past—teaching people how to live. For people in this study, survival is not
about life and death in the bush, but rather about living in societies whose
interventions and attractions are a challenge in maintaining a spiritual
orientation to life. People sharing their own life story, and the stories they
have learned, continues to be an essential part of the ongoing construction
of personal and public Bahá’í identity. People choose to tell certain stories
over others according to what is important to them and their audience, as
well as to conform to their community’s expectations of storytelling. They
also shape their accounts using particular stories that have been accorded
significance by elders in previous and contemporary times.

Changing Contexts of Yukon Aboriginal Bahá’í Storytelling   41
While traditional classic and regional stories have been used to explain
the Bahai Faith in the twentieth century, a more general practice today is
for Yukon Aboriginal Bahá’ís to use familial (family) stories and individual
stories, as I will explore later.14 It must be noted that, while many of these
people come from an extended family and hold a common kinship (Tagish),
there are First Nations people I cite here who are from other Yukon First
Nations.

Prayers, Prophecies, and Dreams
The stories being conveyed about the beginnings of this religion in the Yukon
extend back fifty years, but the foundations for many people’s adherence to
the Bahá’í Faith are drawn from much older stories from the late 1800s and
early 1900s.15 In the narratives of the first generation of people who became
Bahá’ís in the 1960s, I found three major themes—prayers, prophecies, and
dreams.

Prayers
In every life story or public presentation of life history, prayer was identified
as an essential part of living. The function of prayer—to supplicate for
God’s grace and to spiritually guide families in their everyday life—is a
touchstone in the life stories. People identified their grandmother’s (or great-
grandmother’s) prayers as being influential to their spiritual growth and to
becoming Bahá’ís.

> Louise Profeit-LeBlanc: I’m from the Northern Tutchone Nation …
> I was raised in Mayo … I’ve always been aware that spirituality
> is an important part of life. And I think that that was because of
> my training from my grandma … she taught me … you should
> pray everyday … and ask for guidance and give thanks … she just
> brought me up like that.16

Doris McLean similarly traces the spiritual heritage of her family through
the wisdom of her grandmothers:

> So we know that, because of the wisdom of the elders. It [accepting
> the Bahá’í religion] wasn’t a “fly by night.” They had a lot to think
> about. So my family, really, in their wisdom … because they had
> a mother on my father’s side, that would really pray [Mariah
> Johns]. And on my mother’s side—they say that there was a …
> greatest shaman … her grandmother. Her name was Tudeshgiá.ma’
> … that she was so powerful that they said she even walked on
water … And that she did healing and things like this. She was a
> great shaman, shaman lady. And I imagine a lot of the things that
> she had is passed down to my family, whereas a lot of them are
> dreamers. And they’d pray a lot … they always had that spiritual
> connection.17

Prophecies
There are a number of prophecy narratives among Yukon Aboriginal
shamans, including those known to the Aboriginal people through oral
history, and those documented by anthropologists and early Christian
missionaries. The Aboriginal perspective about the prophecies, contrary to
the belief of Christian missionaries, asserts that some of these shamans were
divinely inspired and foretold future events. This is a stance, as Cruikshank
points out, that “argues for the legitimacy of oral tradition as a valid historical
perspective.”18

There are a few stories told by the Bahá’ís that refer to the shamans19and
their prophecies, which are linked to the advent of the Bahá’í religion. Ida
Calmegane (daughter of Angela Sidney of Tagish-Tlingit descent) retells
one highly-prized story as she heard it from her mother: In the mid-1800s,
Major—a “big medicine man”—died during a winter hunting trip and was
then given a shallow burial by his fellow clan members, who planned to
return and give him a proper burial later.20 Some time passed and another
hunting party in the vicinity heard a voice calling from under a pile of stones
and gravel. Major was “able to read their minds” and direct them to help
him out. Subsequently, he was taken back to his people and foretold many
things to come.21 Of interest to this article is the fact that he said there would
be two men who would come from the East, like two stars, and if the Indian
people followed their teachings, everything would be all right. Later it was
interpreted that the central figures of the Bahá’í religion fit this description:
the two Messengers, Bahá’u’lláh and His forerunner the Báb, who were born
in the Middle East.22

As well, another prophecy concerning the appearance of a nine-legged
animal that would nurture the people is recounted in past and present
stories. As Angela Sidney observes, the elders understood that the animal
symbol was a spiritual metaphor; during her lifetime (1902–1991), they were
able to recognize the meaning and the fulfillment of this prophecy:

> Tells about how it’s going to be the last day someday. So he [Major]
> said, “It’s not going to happen right away. Its going to be a long
> time yet,” he said. “And,” he said, “That animal is going to have
> nine legs. A nine-legged animal is going to be our food.” And that is

Changing Contexts of Yukon Aboriginal Bahá’í Storytelling   43
the one us Indians think maybe that’s Bahá’í. The Bahá’í Assembly
> has nine points. That’s what we think. Well nothing happened like
> that until Bahá’í people started coming here telling things like that.
> That’s why we think—my family—we think that’s what he meant,
> because there is no animal that has nine legs. And he said, “That’s
> going to be your food, isn’t it?” It’s just like food. So there’s lots of
> us that joined in.23

Prophecies for Northern Tutchone people had similar teachings. These
prophecies are accorded present day meaning by Aboriginal Bahá’ís because
they resonate with the existence of two Prophets in the Bahá’í religion as
well as the foundational Bahá’í teaching, namely the oneness of humanity.
By remembering and telling about her grandmother’s teachings (circa 1950s),
Louise Profeit-Le Blanc constructs a narrative account in the year 2000 that
confirms traditional teachings for her, and her belief that they have come
true:

> … Cause when I was young, she used to say … “there’s gonna be
> two medicine men … come here … they’re gonna bring us medicine.
> When they come … they’re gonna make everybody go under one
> big tent,” … You know, “Chinamen, even the black one” … “White
> man, Indian, gonna get together” … “under that tent.”24

The metaphorical spiritual imagery that Louise’s grandmother shared
with her is contextualized for the reader here in the following quote from the
Bahá’í writings written in the early 1900s:

> Bahá’u’lláh has drawn the circle of unity. He has made a design
> for the uniting of all peoples and the gathering of them all under
> the shelter of the tent of universal unity. This is the work of Divine
> Bounty, and we must all strive with heart and soul until we have
> the reality of unity in our midst. As we work so will strength be
> given to us.25

Dreams and Visions
While shamans had a vision of future events, First Nations elders were also
visited by dreams and visions. Keish (Skookum Jim Mason) is one such
outstanding example, and his experience would become significant to many
Aboriginal communities in the Yukon.

The “white man’s” version of the discovery of Klondike gold at Bonanza
Creek has become legendary and continues to fascinate people. For those
unfamiliar with these stories, they highlight the “conquest” of the “frontier,”
and have obscured the key parts that Keish and his family played.26 Nowadays,
this story has been reworked by Aboriginal people and, with the production
of several films and a book, it has become part of local and national First
Nations history, aired regularly on Aboriginal Peoples Television Network
(APTN).27

As an example of this revisionist story, Calvin Lindstrom (2003) presents
the saga of Keish (Skookum Jim) from the point of view of his descendents.28
In Lindstrom’s film, the story is told about how Keish, with the help of his
pious sister-in-law, Mariah Johns, followed the proper behaviour toward
animals and thereby received good fortune. The narrative in the film states
that:

> Wealth Woman appeared and thanked him for saving her life when
> she was a frog. To thank Jim she gave him a walking stick. The end
> was covered with gold. Pointing to the east to a light in the sky she
> said, “not that way, that is for someone else” [“that is for others” is
> the wording given by Jim’s descendents]. Pointing north she said,
> “Go that way.” He did not know what the dream meant until after
> he found gold in the Klondike. In early June of 1896 Jim and his
> two nephews, along with their wives, travelled 600 miles down the
> Yukon River and into the history books.

Though the two directions pointed out by Wealth Woman (the
mythological being of the Tagish Tlingit)29 are an integral part of Jim’s vision,
the direction promised to “the others” was the obscure part of the story.
The descendents of Skookum Jim who have become Bahá’ís interpret this
to mean that Jim received the material riches while his descendents received
the spiritual riches.30

The film makes these connections for the audience and then takes up the
twentieth century statement of Pete Sidney, Mariah’s grandson (and a great
nephew of Keish), with the narrator stating:

> [He] said that all four of Mariah’s children,31 through their own
> visions and dreams, had been inspired to embrace the Bahá’í
> Faith. Pete felt that the light from the east is the Bahá’í Faith and
> Mariah’s family was shown the light because she is the one that
> paid that frog. Today there are one hundred Bahá’ís who are the
> descendents of Mariah, and the Faith continues to attract Yukon
> First Nations people.

Today, with a retrospective view, First Nations citizens know that
Skookum Jim’s vision was a prophetic sight into a future that would forever

Changing Contexts of Yukon Aboriginal Bahá’í Storytelling   45
change the lives of Yukon Aboriginal peoples, materially and spiritually. The
discovery of gold and the building of the Alaska Highway introduced non-
Aboriginal people into their territory.32 The white people brought radical
social change, Christianity, and eventually, as the people of my study noted,
the Bahá’í religion.

The dream of Keish, it appears, serves as a meta-communal narrative.

While Keish did not live to hear about the religion during his lifetime
(so he did not become a Bahá’í), his prescient dream provides part of the
framework upon which his descendents have ordered their construction of
belief and experience. In the early 1960s, within a few years of each other, a
number of well-known and respected Yukon elders (most, but not all, from
the Tagish people) became Bahá’ís. This influx of elders is noteworthy in
terms of both personal and group identity formation. The elders adopted
the Bahá’í principles and teachings, and used stories of their own dreams,
experiences, and new understandings to socialize younger people of their
extended family.

The fulfillment of the spiritual part of the prophecy was seen by the elders
as a confirmation of their traditional beliefs. For example, Patsy Henderson,
a nephew of Keish,33 is said to have recognized the progressive connection
between the old clan beliefs and the Bahá’í teachings. Here, Clara Schinkel
recalls Patsy Henderson’s interpretation from the 1960s and uses that to
narrate her own contemporary understanding of the continuity of spiritual
verities between the old and new religions:

> When Patsy Henderson declared [became a Bahá’í] in Carcross, I
> remember that. I’d always repeat his words. Because he said that
> when the white people came they took the clan system away. And
> then new people came and they gave it back to us—better. You
> know, because the laws … the laws are, how should I say it? The
> clan system is built on the laws of the Bahá’í Faith. So we know
> that’s eternal, you know, that it’s always been there. These laws are
> all spiritual laws. It’s … it’s something that’s just passed on, and
> Bahá’u’lláh just really re-emphasized it. It reminded people that
> you had this before, you know. And that’s what Patsy Henderson
> said. And the [Bahá’í] Faith brought back the clan system stronger
> than before.34

Clara obviously attributed great importance to Patsy Henderson’s
understanding of the eﬀect the Bahá’i teachings had on regenerating those
traditional values upon which the religious system of the clan was based.
She also expresses her belief that the Bahá’í teachings about the continuous
covenant between the Creator and mankind35 resonate with her own
understanding of the spiritual truths in the clan system.

Another influential story comes from a dream that elder Dora Wedge
had in 1948. Her family knew that her dreams contained great meaning and
that they always came true. The younger people of the family remember
her telling them about this dream on the very morning she awoke from it.
It heralded her family’s entry into the Bahá’í religion, and has become an
integral part of their Bahá’í life stories. Here, Doris McLean (Dora’s niece)
relates the dream:

> Well we were children. My Aunt Dora got up one morning … “Gee
> … you know, I had this dream last night!” she said. “I don’t know
> what this dream means and I don’t know who it was that I dreamt
> about,” she said. “And I went to this strange place.” She said,
> “There was Annie, there was Leslie, there was you, Doris,” she
> said, “and myself. We were in this boat,” and she said, “we were
> floating around in this boat.” And she said, “It was a big lake or
> big water,” she said. “All of a sudden,” she said, “there was stairs
> leading right up into the sky,” she said. “And we landed the boat,
> and we walked up these stairs,” she said. “When we got up to the
> top,” she said that, “we ran … we seen the most beautiful place,”
> she said, “this most beautiful building—strange looking building,”
> she said. “I never seen a building like that before,” she said. “There
> was flowers … it was just so beautiful”. She said, “Standing in the
> doorway was this man,” she said. “He looked diﬀerent. He wasn’t
> Indian and nor was he white,” she said. “I don’t know who he
> was,” she said.36

Annie Austin (Dora’s daughter) recalls, moreover, that her mother said,
“[T]his man was standing outside the house … the gentleman had a long
beard and a long gown and waving for us to come in, come in. The house
was full of many, many people, everyone having a good time laughing and
happy.”37

More than twelve years later, in 1953, when visiting a family member,
Dora was reported to have been astonished to see a picture of the building in
her dream, and another photo of the man who welcomed her (Sir ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
Abbas, son of the Prophet-Founder, Bahá’u’lláh).38 After making inquiries,
she learned about the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith and then became a Bahá’í.
Other members of her family would follow in her footsteps. In 1980 she
went on pilgrimage to the Bahá’í World Centre in Haifa, Israel, and found
herself standing in the exact spot she stood in the dream, at the bottom of

Changing Contexts of Yukon Aboriginal Bahá’í Storytelling   47
a mountain; this was Mount Carmel. This last experience she incorporated
into the retelling of her Bahá’í story in which the totality of her dream was
realized.

Aunt Dora’s dream is a familial/kinship story and it has also now become
a larger narrative identified with the Yukon (it has been broadcast often on
national Aboriginal television).39 Like the vision of Keish, Aunt Dora’s dream
is seen to be prophetic—not that she or Keish were considered prophets, but
that their dreams gave indications of future events.

Nowadays, the extended family of Dora use her dream in narrative
accounts to illustrate a person’s mystical connection to the world of dreams,
and to show that this dream has become manifest in reality. As well, for
Dora’s family, the story of the dream tacitly serves to aﬃrm their choice
to become Bahá’ís. In their accounts and many others, Aboriginal people
would be welcomed into the Bahá’í religion, as Dora and her family were in
the dream, and they would become active in service and governance, locally
and internationally.40

Another well-known account is that of Chief Albert Isaac of Aishihik,
who had a vision during a near death experience in 1957:

> The Chief … [told] the story of a stirring spiritual experience he
> had three years ago, a story which he apparently has told to many
> of the Yukon Indians. As I understand the story, he was in the
> hospital and close to death. As he described it, in broken English, he
> considered himself dead for two days and walking down the broad
> highway that forked to heaven and hell. Beyond the fork—on the
> way to heaven—a Man with a long flowing beard stopped him and
> talked with him. He reverently described this Man as “God” and
> told of being asked, “What do you drink?” and his honest answer,
> “liquor!” The Man replied, “Is not the water I created good enough
> for you?” He then showed him a small object of unusual shape and
> design and told the Chief he was sending him back home. Chief
> Isaac then went on to relate how he seemed to miraculously and
> quickly visit New York and California, and then suddenly found
> himself in the hospital bed again feeling well—returned from the
> dead.41

Three years after this dream, Chief Isaac visited Ted Anderson42 and, after
sharing the story of the dream, he was shown a photograph of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
The four people present witnessed his deep emotion as he identified this
person as the man in the dream.43 Upon hearing about the Bahá’í teachings,
he recognized their import for his people and vowed to share them.

The three dreams mentioned here incorporate the universal metaphor of
travel in seeking spiritual enlightenment. In Keish’s dream, he was instructed
to journey north to receive his reward. Chief Isaac travelled great distances
and received lessons for his earthly life. Dora Wedge and members of her
family travelled by canoe to another land where they were welcomed into
a new community. Using dreams in contemporary times to teach others is
supported by and continues the construction of the spiritual self in Yukon
traditional legends. In the “old time stories” women and men travelled
through visions or dreams to other realms of being, where they had various
experiences and then returned with stories, and sometimes material objects
and/or lessons and songs, for their people.44

It is well-known in the field of narrative studies that stories are not static;
they are, as has been mentioned previously, living texts that inform and
socialize people, and enable them to understand their position in present-day
society. The people that use Chief Isaac’s story are not part of his clan, yet they
have adopted his story and incorporated it as part of Yukon Bahá’í history.
Similarly, the stories of the shamans are about people from diverse clans.
In sharing these accounts, people actually model traditional expectations to
use dream content to teach others, as well as to honour the ancestral matrix.
Most importantly, it seems that sharing these dreams, today, functions to
provide a continuum to the collective history of the Aboriginal Bahá’ís in
the Yukon.

White Society and Christian Teachings: Stepping Stones to Change
The role of adopted (or adapted to) culture is also very evident in Yukon
contemporary narratives. Losing the nomadic lifestyle and having to adapt
to white society caused a falling away of Aboriginal peoples from traditional
culture. They were faced with the manifold advantages and disadvantages
that the larger civilization oﬀered. The older generation grew up in residential
schools, and their descendents attended Christian schools and churches, and
were cared for in Christian hospitals. These Whitehorse residents explain
their experiences with this new way of living and being:

> Ronald Bill: I was one of them … born in 1936 … and just like from
> stone age to jet age … Yeah, we used to live out in the bush year
> round … When we moved here to town, nine years old, I was
> forced to go to school … It was good. I learned … teach us how
> to read and do math … But one of the things they teach here, like
> forgetting your culture, was wrong, eh?45

Edwin Scurvey: Fifty years ago Indian people were very independent.

> They hunted and trapped and lived oﬀ the land, kind of leading
> a nomadic life … and were very peaceful … Modern civilization
> spoiled that. Meaning I’ve gotten used to electric lights, I have to
> turn on my radio in the morning to listen to my CBC news, or it’s
> not a day.46

It was not unusual for the Bahá’is in these small communities to have,
within their families, people who were aﬃliated with various denominations
of Christianity. This was a direct result of the mission school system at the
turn of the century that took children and placed them in schools run by the
Christian denominations.

> Doris McLean: There was my mother’s … generation. They went to
> mission schools. They put the fear of God into them, the message
> was forced on them, they were compelled to accept and give up
> their language, their beliefs, their Aboriginal identity. And they
> were taught that they should not teach us the language … like the
> Tagish or the Tlingit, because they were forbidden to speak the
> language.47

In later years (1940–50s), the Sunday schools and vacation bible summer
schools (Anglican, Baptist, Roman Catholic, and so on) became a welcome
attraction to the young children of the village. These schools were often the
only organized event happening in the community on a regular basis.

> Doris McLean: And my mother … did not worry about what church
> we went to, as long as we learned about God. So some of us went
> to a Catholic Sunday school, some went to the Anglican Sunday
> school, and I chose to go to the Baptist Sunday school. So I grew
> up as a very young child, you know in kindergarten type of thing,
> going to Sunday school. And going to all kinds of Sunday schools,
> actually.48

In the 1960s, as people came to know about the Bahá’í religion, their
Bahá’í activity increased and their church connections decreased, or in some
cases were abruptly halted. Within this cohort of people there are memories
of some kindly church members; however, when the new religion started to
gain a following, some church leaders directed people not to associate with
the Bahá’ís. Certain young people were told not to pursue their interest in
this new Faith, but these warnings did not deter them.

In the more tolerant religious environment of the late 1980s another
orientation toward religiosity is seen in the life of Angela Sidney. She was a
staunch Anglican from her young adulthood, and then in her late 80s became
a Bahá’í—one of the last people in her extended family to do so. She was able
to maintain some connection to the Anglican Church at the same time that
she began to understand and practice the beliefs of her new-found faith. As
well, she was able to connect and reconcile ideas from the Shamanism taught
to her by her parents with Anglicanism and with the Bahá’í teachings.49

One hundred years of learning Christian teachings and parables has
provided Aboriginal peoples with literacy and a new lexicon to enrich their
religious experience and enhance their narrative creation.

Ronald Bill remembers his own course of study in this regard:

> Well I read and became more interested [in the Bahá’í Faith]. And I

As a matter of course, almost all of the Aboriginal people were immersed
early in Christian teachings and studies. The new Bahá’ís, likewise,
constructed their stories through Christian terminology as well as the Bahá’í
worldview in order to understand new religious concepts and spiritual laws.
For example, this story about Peter Johns indicates that he was interested in
Bible study and used his Christian learning to investigate the Bahá’í Faith.
As his daughter Clara Schinkel explains:

> When he went to the mission school …[he] was taught to be a
> lay reader in the church. And he really knew the Bible. He knew
> the Bible! And in his sleep, he would dream about it and give big
> sermons in his sleep … And anyhow, when …[he] started studying
> the [Bahá’i] Faith, he read all about Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings and
> Christ’s teachings, and he did a comparison on it.51

Similarly, Doris McLean remembers how important it was to her that
Bahá’í’s had a knowledge of Christian teachings and prophecy, because she
herself was well versed in the Bible, and that is how she understood religion.
In other words, it is evident here that Doris’s expectations of the manner
in which the Bahá’í religion would be introduced would follow the way in
which proofs are given in Christian teaching/storytelling using the Bible:

So we walked in there. And I remember just challenging those
> Bahá’ís, you know. I went in there and I said, “Okay you Bahá’ís,
> tell us about the Bahá’í Faith.” Can you imagine? So, they had the
> best, you know, teacher in Jim Walton [Coastal Tlingit Bahá’í], who
> was there … for me, anyway, because like I said, I was a Baptist,
> and he knew the Bible inside and out. He knew his history. And so
> he goes along and he tells me the history of Christianity, you know.
> After he finishes, clarifying all those writings and how the Bible
> was predicting revelations. And everything was predicting that
> there was going to be another Manifestation of God come to this
> earth, you know. And he goes through that, and he goes through
> the history. He tells me about the [central figures of the Bahá’í
> religion] Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Guardian [Shoghi
> Eﬀendi] —the whole history. He spoke to us from about nine in
> the evening ’til about five in the morning. We were, to say the least,
> we were just completely floored! When he left, in my heart I knew
> he was telling the truth. In my soul, I knew what he was telling me
> was the truth.52

New Stories that Model Behaviour and Aﬃrm Capacity
Another aspect of storying the religious self involves the relevance of the
religion to people’s lives. There is no clergy in the Bahá’í Faith, and thus
every individual assumes the responsibility to learn about the religion and
can accept to serve in its administration if elected by other believers.

An all-Aboriginal Bahá’í Spiritual Assembly, composed of nine elders
from the same clan, was established in Carcross in 1962. The importance of
this governing council and the need to support and respect it, I was told,
was readily grasped by the Aboriginal peoples. This is conveyed using a
short and favourite familial story about the election of the Carcross Spiritual
Assembly, and the dedication and devotion of a woman to carry out her
electoral duty even in extreme circumstances: Elder Dora Wedge, suﬀering
with a broken leg, walked twelve miles with her husband across a frozen
lake to take part in the election process.53

By all accounts it seems that the heritage of traditional life handed
down through oral stories and early childhood experiences formed a natural
conceptual bridge for Aboriginal peoples’ service in the Bahá’í community.
Proselytization is forbidden in the religion, but sharing the Bahá’í message
from one place to another (called “teaching”) is encouraged. This activity
was not constrained in any way by traditional customs for men or for
women. “Travelling teaching” to other places is culturally congruent with
the grandparents’ semi-nomadic past—both sexes seasonally moved from

place to place to do their fishing, hunting, and berry picking, and to visit
other people for trade, potlatching, and storytelling.

Many contemporary stories are told that exemplify this adaptation to
new religious culture. The manner in which these particular stories are told
are windows into Aboriginal people’s agency and autonomy. The stories
give voice to personal doubts and the emergence of self-confidence gained
through practice and opportunity. Clara Schinkel shares how this happened
in her own experience:

> … In February of 1960, that April I was on the Assembly. And I
> don’t know the first thing about administration, but I learned.
> It’s just like you have on-the-job-training. You learn by doing it.
> And that’s the best way, because it’s good to learn by books, but by
> doing it—that’s the way the Indian people learn, by doing things.
> That’s how they teach, by doing things. And when I became a
> Bahá’í and this is the Bahá’í law … to teach … I accepted it just
> wholeheartedly. And then in 1963, that was the first major teaching
> trip [to Saskatchewan]. And after that I went to Alaska, I travelled
> in Alaska. I went to Kodiak Island. I was quite involved in the
> [Bahá’i] Faith … in all aspects—as delegate at conventions, took
> part in gatherings. I think I attended every gathering that I could
> remember. We went to the Blackfoot Reserve, we went to Montreal
> [1987 Conference], went to Chicago [Intercontinental Conference
> 1967]. Just travelled to every gathering.54

The Yukon Aboriginal Bahá’ís became well-known nationally for their
extensive travels in North America, as well as internationally for their
response to the Bahá’í plans for community building. These trips were
remembered with enthusiasm and nostalgia:

> Doris McLean: I’ve … left Canada eight times. I’ve been to the
> Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan, Iran, Europe, Haifa four times,
> Russia, Finland, and Slovenia, and Italy … all those places. I would
> never gone to any of those places if I wasn’t a Bahá’í. Especially as
> an Aboriginal Indian from Carcross, a village of 250 people at the
> best of times … maybe 400. And when I went to Iran on pilgrimage
> … it was amazing. To be an Indian person, an Aboriginal from a
> little village called Carcross, from the Tagish nation, to pay homage
> to the Báb [forerunner of Bahá’u’lláh], that I only read stories about
> … For me … for no other reason to go there, except I was a Bahá’í.
> To experience that in this day and age. You know I had the bounty
> of going all over the world practically …55

Revitalizing Culture
Another significant feature concerning the construction of self for early
Bahá’ís was that the religion recognized the importance of maintaining
Aboriginal culture and language. The story of Clara Schinkel and her goal of
revitalizing the Tagish culture and language illustrates this point. It also in
all likelihood will stand out as a historical narrative of import for her family
and her people:

> …The language, like, is dying out—the Tagish language.56 I told
> Auntie Angela about what the Guardian [Shoghi Eﬀendi, head of
> the religion 1921–1957] said about our culture and things … and
> the language. So we got it started. We started language in Carcross
> and then it went into dancing … It was mostly my family that was
> there. We were all Bahá’ís. We started using the Bahá’í principles to
> teach. And like I say, the clan system was very, very, very familiar
> [congruent] with the Bahá’í teachings … the Bahá’í laws. So it was
> easy to teach them. And that’s how the dance group got started. Just
> because Shoghi Eﬀendi said that we should encourage the people
> to keep their cultural ways. [Later] when I first went to work for
> Council of the Yukon Indians [Council for Yukon Indians, now
> Council of Yukon First Nations], it was in cultural education. And
> we had tried to reintroduce the people to their culture. And I was
> the Director of Cultural Education then, so I got a lot of traditional
> camps started.57

At the same time as people were making eﬀorts to revitalize and celebrate
local Aboriginal culture, they were also greatly widening the social circle of
their lives. The concept of the world as one country has been vigorously
promoted in the teachings of the Bahá’í religion since its inception. While this
world mindedness was not immediately understandable to most of the early
Bahá’ís in Canada,58 it gradually became realized through their engagement
with the religious teachings; the social processes of Bahá’í community life;
and particularly, as mentioned previously, their involvement with the global
administrative structure of the religion.59 In the Yukon, Aboriginal Bahá’ís
received an unusually large number of international visitors from many
diverse parts of the world. They also travelled nationally and internationally
to visit and assist other Bahá’í communities. In this regard, Aboriginal Bahá’ís
have both promoted and experienced the oneness of humanity.

If there has been any notion that Aboriginal people who became Bahá’ís
simply acquiesced and were timid in joining “yet another religion,” this
can assuredly be put to rest by the record of many peoples’ outstanding

participation and enthusiasm for travel and community building. Aboriginal
Bahá’ís have taken the opportunity to present their stories in ways that
demonstrate that they were active agents in learning, accepting, and
advancing the religion. They have also shared their accounts with scholars,
which has clearly been an informed strategy to enable the continuity of the
history of Yukon peoples in written form.

As the society and economy of the Yukon has grown and diversified,
radical social change has occurred. The demographics have changed markedly
in the past fifty years to the point where younger generations of Aboriginal
people now have many diﬀerent opportunities ahead of them. As well, their
community’s successful negotiations of traditional land claims and self-
governance settlements open up a new era of potential transformation. The
accounts of religiosity here show the continued adaptation and resiliency of
Yukon Aboriginal peoples in changing the form of stories. Traditional stories
were meant for knowledgeable audiences who were able to catch the implied
nuances that are evident and relevant in and for traditional life. While a
culturally diverse audience can enjoy traditional stories and pick out themes
that are universal (evidenced by the popularity of storytelling festivals),
such storytelling was most eﬀective and meaningful with an audience
and storytellers raised within the culture itself. This newer generation of
Bahá’ís—middle-aged and younger—are standing in two worlds, as pointed
out by Clara Schinkel.60 They are literate, well-seasoned travellers, users
of the latest technologies, and many are professionals in their fields. They
frame and mould their accounts using concepts and references that will be
understandable and that resonate with multicultural audiences who have
diverse expectations of what constitutes a contemporary story.

All these changes have naturally resulted in individual and family
stories that draw upon many diﬀerent threads to weave a concept of self and
communal identity in this modern day.61 It may be timely now for interested
scholars, some of whom are, hopefully, Aboriginal, to explore these types of
stories so that a new typology can be created that will help explain modern
narratives, and will in turn document these important contemporary
histories.

The stories included here pay tribute to ancestors, provide social
commentary, deconstruct colonialism, and, as well, advance personal
agency. One of the most important functions of these narratives is to connect
past Bahá’í history to the present and in so doing aﬃrm the existence and
continuity of spiritual connections between the generations. A number
of the older stories have been created in diﬀerent historical contexts, and

have transformed with changes in the outer social landscape and the inner
landscape of dreams, spirituality, and personal meanings.

Stories from the past and the present have been artfully intermingled
in new forms. Drawing upon the prophecies of shamans from the late
1800s, dreams of elders in the mid to late 1900s, new Bahá’í teachings, and
contemporary accounts of experience in the postmodern age, Aboriginal
Bahá’ís continue the time-honoured tradition of constructing individual and
collective spiritual identity through the process of storytelling.
