GREENACRE ON THE PISCATAQUA.

TONew
the

England on the Eastern
Division of the Boston & Maine
Railroad there is no hint of any
special attraction      at the plain       lit-

tle   station   of   Eliot.    A   drive    of
three miles takes       you past      thrifty
homes, with meadows            reaching to
the    broad, swift      Piscataqua,     and
through     stretches    of   dense   woods
down     to the river bank, wrhere         al-

most at the entrance to Long Reach
Bay stands      the Greenacre Inn.          It

isa quiet spot, with gently sloping
banks, and off to the west lies a long
meadow with its fringe of apple trees
and birches reflected in the waters of
the bay. There is a sense of space and
distance,a limitless expanse of sky,
a broad sweep of river and bay with

the distant low-lying banks, and far
beyond, ever changing in hue against
the sunset sky, range the foothills
of the White Mountains.                  With the
going     down        of the sun         a golden
bridge spans the waters glowing and
radiant at our        feet.

Once there was a desperate strug-
gle here;     men fought          for their lives,
while   women and children              hurried for
shelter over the fields to the garrison
house with      its   high stockade.            There
are yet signs to be seen of this old
house, and in the fields                about the
plough has turned up                  many an     ar-
row-head.       As    late as       1747 the men
of this     district       carried firearms        to
church.

Down       in the    hollow below the Inn
where the apple               trees    and locusts
bloom, there was a large ship-yard
in the    fifties,   where the        keel of   many
a good ship was             laid.      The fleetest
sailing vessel of her day.              The Night-
ingale,    built      to    carry Jenny Lind

Goldsmith back to Sweden, floated
out on the tide from these cool, green
shores.   She never       fulfilled    her pur-
pose,and years after was captured
by the government with a cargo of
wretched human beings bound for the
slave market.

The EHot of to-day        is   a quiet farm-
ing   town   of 1,500 inhabitants, lying
for six miles along the          banks of the
beautiful Piscataqua, just over the
Maine border      line,   four miles from
Portsmouth,     New Hampshire.           There
are three or four churches, a grocery
store or two,    and one         hotel. Green-

acre Inn, built ten years             ago by a
company      of enterprising Eliot peo-
ple. The Inn, a small house holding
about one hundred people, was for a
few years a resort for Bostonians.
Here John Greenleaf Whittier came,
drawing about him a circle of friends.

In 1893, that wonderful year,
when, through the World's Parlia-
ment of Religions, men were brought

to a recognition of the fundamental
points of contact in the religions of
the world,           Miss Sarah        J.   Farmer,
only daughter of Moses G. Farmer,
the inventor, conceived the idea of
continuing at Eliot, Maine, her birth-
place, the         movement inaugurated at
Chicago She determined to form a cen-

.

tre at the Greenacre Inn,            where think-
ing men and women, reaching out
to help their fellows through means
tried       and   untried,   might   find   an audi-
ence recognizing not               alone revealed
truth, but truth in the process of
revelation.           It     was   believed      that
for those of different faiths, different
nationalities, different             training,    the
points        of contact might be found,
the great underlying principles               — the
oneness of truth, the brotherhood of
man     ;    that to the individual this spot
might mean the opening door to free-
dom, the tearing down of walls of
prejudice and superstition. The teach-
ers and lecturers on this broad plat-

form were to give their services with-
out remuneration. There was no en-
dowment     fund,and the expense of
their transportation and entertain-
ment was met through voluntary
contributions.  Where else in the
world's history do we find such an-
other cornerstone?

In July, 1894, Greenacre Inn     was
opened to guests under Miss Farmer's
management. Less expensive accom-
modations were to be had in the farm
houses about.       An encampment     of

tents pitched on the river bank, over
in the   meadow where the   old garrison
house stood, gave those desiring it
the freedom of open-air life. Although
six miles from the sea, the tide rises
high at Eliot,  and the opportunities
for salt-water bathing are fine.

The great lecture tent seating three
hundred was raised just beyond the
stone wall of the meadow. The after-
noon of the third day of July had
been appointed for the opening exer-

;

cises of   the Greenacre Lecture Course,
and only a few had gathered.                           Mrs.
Ole Bull, of Cambridge, delivered the
address of welcome.                    At the    close of
the exercises       we stood with heads                 un-
covered to raise the stars and                    stripes.

For days the sky had been dark and
lowering, but as we sang ''The Bat-
tle   Hymn       of the Republic," the clouds
parted a       and a flood of sunshine

little

illuminated the scene. It was with
every man's hand to the rope that
the flag of our country went up, and
under      it    there floated           for     the   first

time over these green                   fields   a white
flagwith the legend            it.*'

A   wonderful sifting      process has
been going on through these years,
working      silently for the    most       part,
eliminating the       man with        the per-
sonal ''ism," the ''fad," the so-called
crank, and sometimes finding, in the
abundance of what the world                 calls
chaff, the kernel of wheat.

Since the first season the order of
the day has been      much   the same.        At
nine     o'clock devotional     exercises in
the lecture tent, and then the leisurely
trooping up over the          hills    to    the
Lysekloster pines, where, in pleasant
weather, the platform of the morning
is   a carpet of pine needles under a
great pine    tree.   On   rainy days, the
morning     lectures are given under a

> i
> SWAMI'S PINE.

tent in the pines,     and the afternoon
lectures   during the last few years
have been given        in the   new   lecture
hall, The Eirenion; but on bright
days ^sre listen to music and the lec-
ture of the day in the great tent, with
its sides ^de open to the river, and

with all the life and freedom of the
summer about. At sunset there is a
quiet hour in the tent, and once or
twice a v^eek a musical program. The
music school, under the direction of
Miss Mary H. Burnham, has been
an important factor in the Greenacre
work.

In 1896 the general lecture course
was     divided into    conferences begin-
ning Sunday afternoon and continu-
ing one week, and a Nature School
out in the woods and fields was
formed for the children, under Daniel
Batchellor and Melvin G. Dodge. In
this    same   year,   a school of com-
parative religions      was founded      un-
der the directorship of Doctor Lewis

G. Janes, director of the       Cambridge
Conferences.

This school has been one of the
strongest features of the Greenacre
Lecture Course.       The    sessions   have
been held during August under the
pines.   The motive has been compara-
tive   study and never propagation of
doctrine.    During the four years Lewis
G. Janes, director of the school, has
given a number of valuable lectures
upon various        subjects.    This   last
summer's work held nothing more
broadly helpful and suggestive than
Dr. Janes's course    upon   social science
and applied          The Swamis

religion.

Yivekananda, Saradananda and Ab-
hedananda have in turn expounded
the profound philosophy of the Ve-
danta.

The      history, ethics   and theology
of the     Talmud were presented by
Rabbi Joseph Silverman; the teach-

by Jean du Buy, and the
ing of Jesus

Schmidt of Cornell University gave
this yearan exceptionally interesting
course on ancient Hebrew philoso-
phers.  A brilliantly dramatic pre-
sentation of the sacred and religious
customs in Mohammedan countries
was given by the Syrian Shehadi
Abd-Allah Shehadi.     From   the stand-
point of the Christianized Hindu, T.
B. Pandian described the social condi-
tions and missionary work in India.
Lack of space alone forbids the men-
tion of many other valuable contribu-
tions to this program.     The    discus-
sions after the lectures are carried on
with a calm, judicial temper, a cour-
tesy,   a respect for the opinions of
others, an evident desire for Truth

to make them educational.

Rare opportunities for help have
been given along metaphysical lines
by Charles Brodie Patterson, Horatio
Dresser, Paul Tyner, Ellen                   M.   Dyer,
Emma       Louise Nickerson, Helen Yan-
Anderson and others.

Who can forget Emerson Day in
the Cathedral Pines            !    Frank      B. San-
born, the presiding            officer,      v^as   the
last   resident        member           of   the Con-
cord School of Philosophy, and the
friend  and companion of Emerson
and Thoreau. We sit about under
the trees and listen to tender intimate
touches from Emerson's life and expe-
rience.    We    hold his          letters,    written
seventy years           ago,       in    our   hands.
Then Charles Malloy gives a series of
Emerson readings, with lines and in-
terlines of interpretation, the                wealth
of a lifetime of study.             The great tent

is   crowded Sunday afternoon with
the people of the countryside to hear
Edward     Everett Hale.       He   gives us a
mighty summing up of the reasons
for peace, from the spiritual as well
as from the historical standpoint.
For three summers under a tree in
the Lysekloster pines we have spent
a morning ^th Joseph Jefferson in
informal discussion    .   In the afternoon
the tent   is   again crowded to hear him
on ''The    Possibilities of the     Drama,"
from     the     standpoint    of    a great
actor.

One summer under these same pines
Dharmapala, the Buddhist, pitched
his tent;       sometimes teaching from
the platform, but          more   often   from
the door of his tent, a striking              fig-

ure in his       orange robe.       Seventeen
different faiths    were represented that
year at Greenacre.         How    times have

The Parliament of Religions, Sun-
day, August 30, 1897, was a notable
occasion. The tent was crowded to
OYerflowing, the sides wide open to
the river and the fields. A platform
beautifully decorated with pines was
occupied by a remarkable group of
persons     :    Miss Farmer, in the centre

William          A.   Key,     London, of the
Unitarian church;              Horatio Dresser,
editor      of    the Journal of Practical
Metaphysics; K.              S.    Guthrie of the
Episcopal church;              Paul Carus,      edi-

tor of the Monist and Open Court,
of Chicago     ;

Jehanghier Cola in the

ences; Alfred Martin, pastor of the
free   church of Tacoma, Washington,
and Rabbis         Fleischer     and Berkowitz,
of Philadelphia.        The      brilliant   assem-
bly, the picturesque colors, the scent
of pine, the setting of river and mead-
ow, the earnest, listening company,
the few simple words of the speakers
showing the essential unity of religion
— all served to make an occasion not

to be forgotten.

Although many charming                   circles

have been formed         in the     farmhouses,
the social   life   centers naturally about
the Inn, where        most of the       lecturers
have been entertained. There is sim-
plicity of life, a charming absence
of conventionality, an almost invari-
able recognition of the             man      apart
from circumstances.               Small      circles

i8
meet on the piazza, along the river
bank or    in the         meadows, discussing
questions with the recognized leaders
of thought.       ''And the people speak
from their character, not from their
tongue."        When      else       could you hear,
without surprise,           in the          momentary
lull   of a hotel dining-room?                    —   *'I        do
not    know whether              the spirits return
to this earth, but               I    do    know        that
progress   is   the   law       of the soul."

There are opportunities day after
day    for the individual                  to take his
problem to the one best                    fitted to help

him, and the personal contact has
proved as great a factor in develop-
ment as any words from the                             plat-
form.    Many         a   life       of inaction            has
been awakened here into service.                            *'

In
the light of greater lives                   we   see the
vision of our    own."

In the fact that thousands have
come to Greenacre, and thousands
have been turned away for lack of
accommodations, in the virility and

force of the minds gathered here, in
the questions discussed from the plat-
form that affect the moral welfare
and   therefore the rational progress of
the world     — in   the renewing of the

who, touched by the spirit,
individual,
isborn into a larger love for pushing

—
starving humanity in all this is de-
monstrated the need for such a centre
in the social   organism.

In a word, Greenacre can best be
characterized as a centre.            It is   not
an organization      ;   it is   not an   institu-
tion,   "the lengthened shadow of one
man," but a great        spiritual,   formative
centre, the trend of       thought broaden-
ing with the need of the times.
The             is therefore not a

crucial test
test of the value    and purity of the
ideal, but a test of methods and their

practical application.    Can a move-
ment depending only upon voluntary
aid live in the world to-day? Only
last year a man died in London, who,
during the last sixty years, has taken
care of thousands of orphans.

The
money necessary to support this
immense work was given unsolic-
itedand used according to the strict-
est     business

principles. So far as
Greenacre amalgamates with the
highest ethical standards of the busi-
ness world, the truth          it   stands   for,
just so far, ''armed with the           Sword
of the Spirit," will      it   penetrate into
the heart of the grossest materiaHsm,
and bring forth the willing tribute of
an awakening spirit-loving service.

Greenacre, August, 1899.

This year, 1900, marks the sev-
enth season of the Greenacre Lecture
Course. It was decided to make of
it   a Sabbatical year, a year of quiet
rest,  one in which to review the past
and consider the future. Although no
programs have been issued, there has
been an average of three lectures a
week, with a daily morning devo-

tional,       and an attendance of nearly
nine hundred persons.        Edward Ev-
erett        Hale,   Charles Brodie Patter-
son,     Samuel Richard            Fuller,Ralph
Waldo          Trine,   Edward        Cummings,
Paul Tyner, Helen M. Cole,                   Lyman
C. Newell, Ellen        M. Dyer,     R. C. Doug-
las,    Swami Abhedananda,               Fillmore
Moore, Florence Richardson, Richard
Ingalese, Jeandu Buy, and Charles
Malloy have spoken from the plat-
form. A much needed rest has made
necessary Miss Farmer's absence the
last season.

1901    will   undoubtedly mark a new
era in the development of this move-
ment a movement which stands,

:                                      let

it    be remembered, not for personality
or place, but for       life,   for progress.

 Greenacre on the Piscataqua

by Anna Josephine Ingersoll
New York: Alliance Publishing Company,

Copyright, 1900 by Anna Josephine Ingersoll

A GLIMPSE OF GREENACRE.
GREENACRE ON THE PISCATAQUA.

__________

TO the traveler speeding through New England on the Eastern Division of the
Boston & Maine Railroad there is no hint of any special attraction at the plain
little station of Eliot. A drive of three miles takes you past thrifty homes, with
meadows reaching to the broad, swift Piscataqua, and through stretches of dense
woods down to the river bank, where almost at the entrance to Long Reach Bay
stands the Greenacre Inn. It is a quiet spot, with gently sloping banks, and off to
the west lies a long meadow with its fringe of apple trees and birches reflected in
the waters of the bay. There is a sense of space and distance, a limitless expanse
of sky, a broad sweep of river and bay with the distant low-lying banks, and far
beyond, ever changing in hue against the sunset sky, range the foothills of the
White Mountains. With the going down of the sun a golden bridge spans the
waters glowing and radiant at our feet.

Once there was a desperate struggle here; men fought for their lives, while
women and children hurried for shelter over the fields to the garrison house with
its high stockade. There are yet signs to be seen of this old house, and in the fields
about the plough has turned up many an arrow-head. As late as 1747 the men of
this district carried firearms to church.

Down in the hollow below the Inn where the apple trees and locusts bloom,
there was a large ship-yard in the fifties, where the keel of many a good ship was
laid. The fleetest sailing vessel of her day, The Nightingale, built to carry Jenny
Lind Goldsmith back to Sweden, floated out on the tide from these cool, green
shores. She never fulfilled her purpose, and years after was captured by the
government with a cargo of wretched human beings bound for the slave market.

The Eliot of to-day is a quiet farming town of 1,500 inhabitants, lying for six
miles along the banks of the beautiful Piscataqua, just over the Maine border line,
four miles from Portsmouth, New Hampshire. There are three or four churches, a
grocery store or two, and one hotel. Greenacre Inn, built ten years ago by a
company of enterprising Eliot people. The Inn, a small house holding about one
hundred people, was for a few years a resort for Bostonians. Here John Greenleaf
Whittier came, drawing about him a circle of friends.

In 1893, that wonderful year, when, through the World's Parliament of
Religions, men were brought to a recognition of the fundamental points of

contact in the religions of the world, Miss Sarah J. Farmer, only daughter of
Moses G. Farmer, the inventor, conceived the idea of continuing at Eliot, Maine,
her birthplace, the movement inaugurated at Chicago. She determined to form a
centre at the Greenacre Inn, where thinking men and women, reaching out to
help their fellows through means tried and untried, might find an audience
recognizing not alone revealed truth, but truth in the process of revelation. It was
believed that for those of different faiths, different nationalities, different
training, the points of contact might be found, the great underlying principles —
the oneness of truth, the brotherhood of man; that to the individual this spot
might mean the opening door to freedom, the tearing down of walls of prejudice
and superstition. The teachers and lecturers on this broad platform were to give

THE GREAT TENT.
their services without remuneration. There was no endowment fund, and the
expense of their transportation and entertainment was met through voluntary
contributions. Where else in the world's history do we find such another
cornerstone?

In July, 1894, Greenacre Inn was opened to guests under Miss Farmer's

management. Less expensive accommodations were to be had in the farm houses
about. An encampment of tents pitched on the river bank, over in the meadow
where the old garrison house stood, gave those desiring it the freedom of open-air
life. Although six miles from the sea, the tide rises high at Eliot, and the
opportunities for salt-water bathing are fine.

The great lecture tent seating three hundred was raised just beyond the stone
wall of the meadow. The afternoon of the third day of July had been appointed for
the opening exercises of the Greenacre Lecture Course, and only a few had
gathered. Mrs. Ole Bull, of Cambridge, delivered the address of welcome. At the
close of the exercises we stood with heads uncovered to raise the stars and stripes.
For days the sky had been dark and lowering, but as we sang "The Battle Hymn of
the Republic," the clouds parted a little and a flood of sunshine illuminated the
scene. It was with every man's hand to the rope that the flag of our country went
up, and under it there floated for the first time over these green fields a white flag
with the legend “Peace " upon it. The first year brought such men as Henry
Wood, Frank B. Sanborn, Edward Everett Hale, O. C. Dolbear, Lewis G. Janes,
Ralph Waldo Trine, Vivekananda, W. J. Colville and others, and they have
continued to come; such women as Ursula Gestefeld, Helen Van-Anderson,
Josephine Locke, Abby Morton Diaz. The programs of the succeeding years have
added many names of value — J. Vance Cheney, John Angus MacVannel, William
Norman Guthrie, John S. Clark, S. T. Rorer, Edna D. Cheney, William Ordway
Partridge, Samuel Walter Foss, Carroll D. Wright, Samuel Richard Fuller, Mary
A. Livermore, Emily Perkins Stetson, Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, Edwin Elwell,
Lucia Ames Mead, Helen M. Cole, Kate Tannett Woods, Edwin Markham, George
D. Herron, Julia Osgood, Edward S. Morse, William Lloyd Garrison, W. T. Harris,

EDWARD EVERETT HALE and SARAH J. FARMER.
A wonderful sifting process has been going on through these years, working
silently for the most part, eliminating the man with the personal "ism," the "fad,"
the so-called crank, and sometimes finding, in the abundance of what the world
calls chaff, the kernel of wheat.

Since the first season the order of the day has been much the same. At nine
o'clock devotional exercises in the lecture tent, and then the leisurely trooping up
over the hills to the Lysekloster pines, where, in pleasant weather, the platform of

the morning is a carpet of pine needles under a great pine tree. On rainy days, the
morning lectures are given under a tent in the pines, and the afternoon lectures

SWAMI'S PINE.
during the last few years have been given in the new lecture hall, The Eirenion;
but on bright days we listen to music and the lecture of the day in the great tent,
with its sides wide open to the river, and with all the life and freedom of the
summer about. At sunset there is a quiet hour in the tent, and once or twice a
week a musical program. The music school, under the direction of Miss Mary H.

Burnham, has been an important factor in the Greenacre work.

In 1896 the general lecture course was divided into conferences beginning
Sunday afternoon and continuing one week, and a Nature School out in the
woods and fields was formed for the children, under Daniel Batchellor and
Melvin G. Dodge. In this same year, a school of comparative religions was
founded under the directorship of Doctor Lewis G. Janes, director of the
Cambridge Conferences.

This school has been one of the strongest features of the Greenacre Lecture
Course. The sessions have been held during August under the pines. The motive
has been comparative study and never propagation of doctrine. During the four
years Lewis G. Janes, director of the school, has given a number of valuable
lectures upon various subjects. This last summer's work held nothing more
broadly helpful and suggestive than Dr. Janes's course upon social science and
applied religion. The Swamis Vivekananda, Saradananda and Abhedananda have
in turn expounded the profound philosophy of the Vedanta.

Mr. GANDHI, Dr. JANES, and SWAMI ABHEDANANDA.

The history, ethics and theology of the Talmud were presented by Rabbi Joseph
Silverman; the teaching of Jesus by Jean du Buy, and the religion and philosophy
of the Jains by Virchand R. Gandhi; Nathaniel Schmidt of Cornell University
gave this year an exceptionally interesting course on ancient Hebrew
philosophers. A brilliantly dramatic presentation of the sacred and religious
customs in Mohammedan countries was given by the Syrian Shehadi Abd-Allah
Shehadi. From the standpoint of the Christianized Hindu, T. B. Pandian
described the social conditions and missionary work in India. Lack of space alone
forbids the mention of many other valuable contributions to this program. The
discussions after the lectures are carried on with a calm, judicial temper, a
courtesy, a respect for the opinions of others, an evident desire for "Truth and not
for victory," that cannot fail to make them educational.

As we glance over the programs of the years we find Edward Griggs on "The Art
of Living," Smith Baker's morning classes on developmental psychology with
their wonderful lessons in life, W. S. Tomlin's talks on music, E. P. Powell on "The
Evolution of a Home," Hezekiah Butterworth on "The Art of Story Telling."
Francis B. Hornbrook talks on Browning, B. O. Flower on Marcus Aurelius and
Epictetus,W. D.Howells reads his "Etruria," Annie Besant lectures on
"Immortality," C. H. A. Bjerregaard on "The Mystic Life," John Fiske on " The
Cosmic Roots of Self-sacrifice," Lester A. Ward on "The Real Moral Evolution,"
Joseph LeConte on "The Relation of Biology to Philosophy," Henry Wood on
"Thinking as a Fine Art," Bolton Hall on "Single Tax," Frederick Spier on "The
Eight Hour Law," Eltweed Pomeroy on "Direct Legislation," Henry Blackwell on
"Woman Suffrage," J. H. Hyslop on "Problems of Physiology," Booker T.
Washington on "Tuskegee," Elihu Thomson on "Electricity of the Future," Cyrus
F. Brackett on "The Past and the Present Outlook of Electrical Science," Jacob
Riis on "How the Other Half Lives."

Rare opportunities for help have been given along metaphysical lines by Charles
Brodie Patterson, Horatio Dresser, Paul Tyner, Ellen M. Dyer, Emma Louise
Nickerson, Helen Van-Anderson and others.

Who can forget Emerson Day in the Cathedral Pines! Frank B. Sanborn, the
presiding officer, was the last resident member of the Concord School of
Philosophy, and the friend and companion of Emerson and Thoreau. We sit about

under the trees and listen to tender intimate touches from Emerson's life and
experience. We hold his letters, written seventy years ago, in our hands. Then
Charles Malloy gives a series of Emerson readings, with lines and interlines of
interpretation, the wealth of a lifetime of study. The great tent is crowded Sunday
afternoon with the people of the countryside to hear Edward Everett Hale. He
gives us a mighty summing up of the reasons for peace, from the spiritual as well
as from the historical standpoint. For three summers under a tree in the
Lysekloster pines we have spent a morning with Joseph Jefferson in informal
discussion. In the afternoon the tent is again crowded to hear him on "The
Possibilities of the Drama," from the standpoint of a great actor.

One summer under these same pines Dharmapala, the Buddhist, pitched his

JOSEPH JEFFERSON

tent; sometimes teaching from the platform, but more often from the door of his
tent, a striking figure in his orange robe. Seventeen different faiths were
represented that year at Greenacre. How times have changed since the good
people — not many miles distant — heard in the dead of night the click of the
horses' [photo inserted here, with caption: "JOSEPH JEFFERSON"] hoofs
carrying their minister forty miles to Salem to be tried for witchcraft"

The Parliament of Religions, Sunday, August 30, 1897, was a notable occasion.

The tent was crowded to Overflowing, the sides wide open to the river and the
fields. A platform beautifully decorated with pines was occupied by a remarkable
group of persons: Miss Farmer, in the centre; Lewis G. Janes, presiding; Virchand
R. Gandhi, representative of the Jains, in native violet dress and yellow turban;
Charles Brodie Patterson of the broad school of mental science; Saradananda, the
Vedantist, in the flame-colored robe and turban of his order, and by his side the
Quaker, Edward Rawson; C. B. Young, Boston, and William A. Key, London, of
the Unitarian church; Horatio Dresser, editor of the Journal of Practical
Metaphysics; K. S. Guthrie of the Episcopal church; Paul Carus, editor of the
Monist and Open Court, of Chicago; Jehanghier Cola in the white dress of the
Parsee, representing Zoroastrianism; Mrs. Ole Bull, founder of the Cambridge
Conferences; Alfred Martin, pastor of the free church of Tacoma, Washington,
and Rabbis Fleischer and Berkowitz, of Philadelphia. The brilliant assembly, the
picturesque colors, the scent of pine, the setting of river and meadow, the earnest,
listening company, the few simple words of the speakers showing the essential
unity of religion — all served to make an occasion not to be forgotten.

Although many charming circles have been formed in the farmhouses, the
social life centers naturally about the Inn, where most of the lecturers have been
entertained. There is simplicity of life, a charming absence of conventionality, an
almost invariable recognition of the man apart from circumstances. Small circles
meet on the piazza, along the river bank or in the meadows, discussing questions
with the recognized leaders of thought. "And the people speak from their
character, not from their tongue." When else could you hear, without surprise, in
the momentary lull of a hotel dining-room? — "I do not know whether the spirits
return to this earth, but I do know that progress is the law of the soul."

There are opportunities day after day for the individual to take his problem to
the one best fitted to help him, and the personal contact has proved as great a
factor in development as any words from the platform. Many a life of inaction has

been awakened here into service. "In the light of greater lives we see the vision of
our own."

In the fact that thousands have come to Greenacre, and thousands have been
turned away for lack of accommodations, in the virility and force of the minds
gathered here, in the questions discussed from the platform that affect the moral
welfare and therefore the rational progress of the world — in the renewing of the
individual, who, touched by the spirit, is born into a larger love for pushing
starving humanity — in all this is demonstrated the need for such a centre in the
social organism.

In a word, Greenacre can best be characterized as a centre. It is not an
organization; it is not an institution, "the lengthened shadow of one man," but a
great spiritual, formative centre, the trend of thought broadening with the need of
the times.

The crucial test is therefore not a test of the value and purity of the ideal, but a
test of methods and their practical application. Can a movement depending only
upon voluntary aid live in the world to-day? Only last year a man died in London,
who, during the last sixty years, has taken care of thousands of orphans. The
money necessary to support this immense work was given unsolicited and used
according to the strictest business principles. So far as Greenacre amalgamates
with the highest ethical standards of the business world, the truth it stands for,
just so far, "armed with the Sword of the Spirit," will it penetrate into the heart of
the grossest materialism, and bring forth the willing tribute of an awakening
spirit-loving service.
Greenacre, August, 1899.

__________

This year, 1900, marks the seventh season of the Greenacre Lecture Course. It
was decided to make of it a Sabbatical year, a year of quiet rest, one in which to
review the past and consider the future. Although no programs have been issued,
there has been an average of three lectures a week, with a daily morning
devotional, and an attendance of nearly nine hundred persons. Edward Everett
Hale, Charles Brodie Patterson, Samuel Richard Fuller, Ralph Waldo Trine,
Edward Cummings, Paul Tyner, Helen M. Cole, Lyman C. Newell, Ellen M. Dyer,
R. C. Douglas, Swami Abhedananda, Fillmore Moore, Florence Richardson,
Richard Ingalese, Jean du Buy, and Charles Malloy have spoken from the

platform. A much needed rest has made necessary Miss Farmer's absence the last
season.

1901 will undoubtedly mark a new era in the development of this movement: a
movement which stands, let it be remembered, not for personality or place, but
for life, for progress.
