The Long, Withdrawing Roar: The Crisis of Faith
and Nineteenth-Century English Poetry by Edwin

McCloughan

Abstract
The following paper was originally submitted to my Modern
English tutor in University College, Dublin at the end of
1991 as part of my final year’s study for a Bachelor of Arts
Degree in English Language and Literature. It was my
Bahá’í-orientated response to the argument that the crisis of
faith in the late nineteenth century was conditioned by
historical circumstances and has therefore little relevance
for a contemporary reader. It has subsequently been much
revised and, it is hoped, much improved. Biblical citations
are from the King James Version of the Bible; the dates after
most of the cited poems are of the year of their composition
rather than publication.

Continuing Crises
To contemporary students of literature, the so-called Victorian
age (1832–1901)1 can pose difficulties of evaluation because of
its relative closeness to our own. As G.D. Klingopulos has
observed: “The kinds of problem which confronted them [the
Victorians] – political, educational, religious, cultural – bear a
strong resemblance to, and are often continuous with, the
problems which confront us at the present time”.2 It therefore
requires considerable effort to see this period in a way that is
objective and that avoids negative preconceptions: in making
assessments about the issues which thrust into doubt many of
the long-cherished attitudes and assumptions common to “the
Bible-reading, church-going, sabbatarian generation”3 of the
Victorian era, we are in effect making assessments about issues
that have continued to absorb and to plague all strata of society
right down to the present. Indeed, it is increasingly evident that
the gradual loss of religious assurance during the second half of

the nineteenth century has served to ensure that religion –
understood as a belief system or “voluntary submission to a
Higher Power”4 and which has played so preponderant a role
in shaping and defining the values, mores and structures of
civilisation – no longer remains a potent force ministering
effectively to the urgent needs of an extremely distressed
world: as of this writing, at least 1 billion people do not have
access to safe drinking water, 40 per cent of the world’s
population is threatened with malaria and some 40 million
people have AIDS. Instead, religious beliefs have, for
increasing numbers of people, been more or less relegated to
obsolescence,5 dismissed as otherworldly superstitions,
displaced by rationalism and science or ousted by a plethora of
New Age disciplines; as a direct consequence of the import
now attached to scientific discoveries, a strongly secular
worldview has emerged and become dominant. Its intellectual
prestige and social relevance having been eclipsed, religion,
alternating with upsurges in fundamentalism which poison the
wells of tolerance,6 has, in many cases, degenerated “into a
decent formula wherewith to embellish a comfortable life”.7

In this paper, I will try to show that the decay of religion
as a stabilising social force in the twentieth century originated
most markedly during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837–
1901), and that certain historical circumstances have coalesced
to determine the secular, relativistic, postmodernist worldview
that is so distinctive a feature of present-day intellectual life.
This decay, I will venture, resulted from both the apparent
failure of Messianic expectations in the first half of the
nineteenth century and the disappointment resulting therefrom
and, to a more noticeable extent, in the unprecedented and
supremely “destructive”8 conflict that erupted between religion
and science soon after the publication of Charles Darwin’s The
Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the
Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life in
late 1859.

In the canon of English literature, this crisis of faith and
doubt finds its most eloquent, incisive and memorable
expression in much of the poetry of the period, and the paper
throughout will cite the work of mainly nineteenth-century
poets who responded to this crisis in ways that are still relevant
to both students of literary history and contemporary readers of
poetry.

The Sea of Faith Ebbs
In the opening chapter of The Imperishable Dominion, Udo
Schaefer singles out four European thinkers whose views
contributed immensely to diminishing the enormous authority
that had been wielded by religion (or rather by religious
institutions), and who thereby laid the foundations for the
construction of the secular world in which we now live:
Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud and Friedrich
Nietzsche.9 Each had rigorously interrogated and boldly
rewritten what Karen Armstrong calls “the dialogue between
an absolute, ineffable reality and mundane events”,10 and
reached such inevitably controversial conclusions as seeing
religion as “a degrading form of alienation” (Feuerbach), “the
opium of the people” (Marx) and “the outcome of infantile
desires in adults who long for the shelter of childhood”
(Freud). Most pungently, Nietzsche had pronounced that
“‘God is Dead,’” a pronouncement whose repercussions were
articulated in Thomas Hardy’s God’s Funeral (1908–10):

XI
‘How sweet is was in years far hied
To start the wheels of day with trustful prayer,

To lie down liegely at the eventide
And feel a blest assurance he [God] was there!

XII
‘And who or what shall fill his place?
Whither will wanderers turn distracted eyes

> For some fixed star to stimulate their pace
> Towards the goal of their enterprise?’ ...

A social system or philosophy based explicitly on divine
precepts was challenged and incrementally replaced by the
thesis that economics and politics were the only aspects of
civilisation deemed to be of any substantive or enduring
significance. Marx, for example, had asserted that recorded
history, rather than being “an epic written by the finger of
God”,11 amounted essentially to a long and bitter series of class
struggles.12

Before such a materialistic conception of human history
became embedded in the twentieth-century consciousness,
however, institutionalised religion, especially since the
dissemination of relativist, empirical Enlightenment
philosophies as an alternative to absolutist religious
worldviews during the eighteenth century, was steadily
relinquishing its ability to satisfy the yearnings of the mind and
heart. Hardy, for instance, had mused that the “faiths by which
my comrades stand / Seem fantasies to me” (The Impercipient
– At a Cathedral Service, 3–4) while in Hap, dating from
1866, he ponders a world devoid of benign or providential
guidance:

– Crass casualty obstructs the sun and rain,
And dicing time for gladness casts a moan ... (11–12).

Emily Brontë wrote on January 2nd, 1846 a paean to her
Creator (subsequently titled No Coward Soul is Mine) in
which appears the forthright declaration:

Vain are the thousand creeds
That move men’s hearts, unutterably vain,

Worthless as withered weeds
Of idlest froth amid the boundless main,

To waken doubt in one
Holding so fast by thy infinity

So surely anchored on
The steadfast rock of Immortality (9–16).

On the other side of the Atlantic in 1861, Emily Dickinson,
who similarly achieved posthumous literary celebrity, wryly
presented the traditional Christian belief in the physical
resurrection thus:

Safe in their Alabaster Chambers –

> Untouched by Morning –
> And untouched by Noon –
Lie the meek members of the Resurrection –

Rafter of Satin – and Roof of Stone!
Grand go the Years – in the Crescent – above them –
Worlds scoop their Arcs –

And Firmaments – row –
Diadems – drop – and Doges – surrender –
Soundless as flakes – on a Disc of Snow – (1–10).

“God’s in his heaven – / All’s right with the world!” are among
the most quoted lines from Victorian poetry. Yet they appear
in Pippa Passes (1841), the first of Robert Browning’s
collection of squalid tales about a heroine who, working in a
sweatshop 364 days a year, is about to be sent to Rome as a
prostitute; a man and woman living in adultery have just
murdered the woman’s husband; a peevish set of bohemians
has tricked a youth into marriage: the overall poem, despite
Pippa’s affirmation, by no means verifies that all is right with
the world. Many readings of Browning’s Childe Roland to the
Dark Tower Came (1852) find it more expressive of
contemporary despair than of the confidence now casually
associated with burgeoning Victorian progress, the landscape
of the eponymous questing knight being grim and nightmarish,
betokening those found in such a poem as T.S. Eliot’s The

Hollow Men (1925); at times Roland’s quest verges on the
horrific: “ – It may have been a water-rat I speared, / But, ugh!
it sounded like a baby’s shriek” (125–6). In Hymn to
Prosperine (1866), with its tension between the libertine
splendours of paganism and the sterility of state-sponsored
Christianity, Algernon Charles Swinburne included
iconoclastic lines like the following (spoken by a Roman
patrician and poet influenced by Julian the Apostate):

Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world

has grown grey from thy breath...
...Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead

shall go down to thee dead...

And in the rhyming couplets of The Latest Decalogue and of
XII respectively, Arthur Hugh Clough and A.E. Housman
satirised the hypocritical constraints imposed by religio-social
injunctions:

The sum of all is, thou shalt not love,

If anybody, God above.
At any rate shall never labour
More than thyself to love thy neighbour (21–4).

And since, my soul, we cannot fly

To Saturn nor to Mercury,
Keep we must, if keep we can,
These foreign laws of God and man (21–4).

Schaefer summarises this attitude of disillusionment when
he states: “The dominant role which science has assumed in
modern society has tended to turn religious conviction into a
private matter and expel it from the socio-political sphere”.13 If
anything, the advances made by science and technology have
been coterminous with the retreat of religion, as mourned by

Matthew Arnold in the elaborate metaphor of his most famous
poem, Dover Beach (1851):

The Sea of Faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth’s shore
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.

But now I only hear
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar

Retreating to the breath
Of the night wind, down the vast edges drear

And naked shingles of the world (21–8).

Yet in the midst of the worst excesses of British
industrialisation – “And all is seared with trade, smeared with
toil; / And wears man’s smudge and shares man’s smell: the
soil / Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod” (God’s
Grandeur, 6–8) – the Jesuit priest, Gerard Manley Hopkins,
drew consolation from the myriad wonders of “dearest” natural
freshness and the dove-like Holy Ghost brooding “over the
bent / World ... with warm breast and with ah! bright wings”
(13–14).

Decades after the French Revolution, Christianity, the
religion of transcendent redemption par excellence, was to
become transformed into a number of surrogate faiths: one has
only to read Marx and Engels’s The Communist Manifesto
(1848) – published in London on the eve of an outbreak of
political revolutions in Paris, Rome, Venice, Berlin and other
European cities – to notice the way in which the fundamental
Judaeo-Christian doctrine of the salvation of the soul had come
to be replaced by the perception of the human being as a socio-
economic functionary (rather than an essentially spiritual
being) and by the salvation inscribed in Communist tenets
which would lead ultimately to the realisation of an egalitarian
order consequent upon the victory of the proletariat hitherto
oppressed and exploited by bourgeois capitalism:

In short, the Communists everywhere support every
> revolutionary movement against the existing social and
political order of things.

In all these movements they bring to the front, as
> the leading question in each, the property question, no
matter what its degree of development at the time.

Finally, they labour everywhere for the union and
agreement of the democratic parties of all countries.

The Communists disdain to conceal their views and
> aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained
> only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social
> conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a
> Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to
lose but their chains. They have a world to win.

WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!14

One possible reason this transformation should have
occurred in the Christian West lies with an examination of the
teachings revealed by Jesus Christ Himself.

New Wine, Old Wineskins
Christ’s Revelation was one directed primarily at the
individual, at his or her relations with other individuals, and
focused itself on the moulding of personal moral conduct and a
striving for spiritual excellence through conscious discipline:

> Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill
> cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it
> under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light
> unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine
> before men, that they may see your good works, and
> glorify your Father which is in heaven (Matthew 5:14–
> 16).

> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect (Matthew 5:48).

This emphasis on God’s passionate interest in, and concern for,
the individual personality, on the worth of “slave or free, male
or female, gentile or Jew”,15 was extremely radical in “a world
where the poor little man was only a pawn in a game he could
not control”.16 This, and the love of God for all (John 4:42,
John 8:12, John 10:16, Matthew 28:19) – not alone the chosen
people to whom Christ ministered – were crucial to His
teachings, which laid much greater stress on service to others
and the cultivation of the “gentler virtues of pity and
forgiveness, of charity and self-sacrifice”17 than on the external,
meticulous observance of such religious duties as prayer,
fasting and almsgiving: for Christ, the correct intention on the
part of the individual was paramount. This differentiation was
further extended by St Paul’s formulation, in his appeal to
Gentile audiences in the Diaspora, of a doctrine of
antinomianism (anti-legalism) and of acknowledging the
messianic, salvific figure of Jesus, through Whom God had
been reconciled to postlapsarian humanity: “As in Adam all
shall die, so in Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Corinthians
15:22); “For it pleased the Father that in him [Jesus] should all
fulness dwell; And having made peace through the blood of his
cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself, by him, I say,
whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven”
(Colossians 1:19–20).

“That ye have love one to another” (John 13:35) became
the criterion of Christian discipleship, even if another should
be a Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37, Luke 17:15–17, John 4:3–42),
a Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11–32), a Roman centurion (Matthew
8:5–13), a Gerasene demoniac (Mark 5:1–20), a Syro-
Phoenician Gentile woman (Mark 7:25–30), a woman whose
condition made her unclean and a social outcast (Mark 5.25–
34), a prostitute (Luke 7.24–30), an adulteress (John 8:1–11),
a tax-collector (Matthew 9:10–13, 21, 31 and 32), a child
(Mark 10:13–16) or a penitent criminal (Luke 23:40–43). Two
of the Mosaic social laws He explicitly modified were the

loosening of strict Sabbath observance (Mark 2:23–28) and the
tightening of divorce (Matthew 12:1–8). Nowhere in the four
canonical Gospel accounts did Christ impart any definitive
guidance about how the communities of His followers should
be governed and administered, however. The civilisation that
arose upon His Teachings and example and that reached its
zenith in the fourth century18 was thus strong in the case of
individual morality but fragile in terms of social co-ordination.
Shunning affairs of state (John 6:14–15, Matthew 22:17–22,
John 18:36) and, like His forerunner, John the Baptist,
reserving some of His sternest condemnations for sacerdotal
hypocrisy and venality (Matthew 23:13–36, Luke 11:37–52,
12:1), Christ founded no institutions, though the subsequent
institutions that bore His Name were derived for the most part
by inference or invention from His utterances as recorded in
the Gospel.19 Of this Professor John Hatcher has commented:

> ... virtually at the moment of Christ's death, major
> difficulties arose as to how radically different this
> institution would be from what had preceded it, how the
> institution should be formed, how administered, how
> sustained. And because Christ left little explicit guidance
> about how these tasks should be accomplished, it is not
> hard to trace in the early history of the Christian church
> how the good intentions of the apostles and the patristic
> fathers, coupled with the confusion about the question of
> Christology (the nature and station of Christ), almost
> immediately distracted and perverted the essential
> teachings of Christ to the extent that by the fourth
> century, the Christian institution as the body of Christ
> was irreparably severed from the spiritual verities that
> constituted the soul of Christ’s ministry. The wineskin,
> mutilated beyond repair, allowed the wine to trickle upon
> the earth and thus become mixed with baser stuff. 20

After, say, the Industrial Revolution in the later
eighteenth century, Western civilisation found itself struggling
to evolve a system that successfully integrated Christian
personal ethics with social justice necessitated by the
accelerating interdependence of nation-states and by the new
frameworks of democratic government which had emerged
upon the collapse of the feudal order. It was this cleavage
between individual and collective morality – in the broadest
sense between the best interests and rights of the individual and
those of all nations and races – that called for a religious
paradigm corresponding to the relatively sophisticated degree
of social and cultural progress that had been achieved at that
stage in humanity’s evolution. As pointed out by Horace
Holley, the “man-to-God and ... man-to-man revelation”21 that
was orthodox Christianity came under intense pressure during
the nineteenth century, an age of “strenuous activity and
dynamic change, of ferment of ideas and recurrent social
unrest, of great inventiveness and expansion”,22 one that
demanded what Holley generically terms “a man-to-men
revelation.” Hence the birth and proliferation of so many man-
made polities, ideologies and utopian and social reform
movements during a period that witnessed large-scale
endeavours to create a just society with the abolition of
serfdom and slavery, the unfoldment of the national state and
the development and spread of democracy. 23

If religion was to be relevant or meaningful now, it should
address humankind as a whole, specifically its “collective
spiritual consciousness”;24 as Count Leo Tolstoy put it:

> I believe that at this very hour the great revolution is
> beginning which has been preparing for two thousand
> years in the religious world – the revolution which will
> substitute for corrupted religion, and the system of
> domination which proceeds therefrom, the true religion,
> the basis of equality between men, and the true liberty to
which all beings endowed with reason aspire.25

He Cometh With Clouds

> ... When it is evening, ye say, it will be fair weather; for
> the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather
> to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites
> [Pharisees and Sadducees], ye can discern the face of the
> sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?

(Matthew 16:2–3).

> ... Kill not the Moth nor the Butterfly,
> For the last Judgment draweth nigh ...
William Blake, Auguries of Innocence (39–40, c. 1803)

“The nineteenth century,” notes Michael Sours, “witnessed
what was probably the most dramatic period of Messianic
expectation in Christian history”.26 The Second Coming of
Christ had been a prominent feature of belief during the
ministries of Peter and Paul and the early centuries of
Christianity. But by the fifth century – marked by the
establishment of a hierarchical ecclesiastical order – it had
more or less disappeared. During the Renaissance, a similarly
vivid interest was once again shown in the Day of Judgment:
Nicolás Florentino has a painting of it in what is now the Old
Cathedral of Salamanca and Michaelangelo a fresco of it in the
Sistine Chapel dating from 1541.

By the eighteenth century, the return of Christ again came
to the fore in circles of Christian thought: Isaac Newton and
Charles Wesley, among others, had written of its imminence.
The French Revolution of 1789 was construed by those versed
in Scripture as being the prelude to the long-awaited Biblical
apocalypse (as detailed in the Books of Daniel, Ezekiel and
Revelation). In the words of Geoffrey Nash: “It was not merely
a political event, or even the destruction of an old order; it was
a new advent, the point of genesis of a new age and a new
world”.27 William Wordsworth recollected the initial

significance of the Revolution there in the Ninth Book of The
Prelude (1805):

Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
But to be young was very heaven! O times ...
When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights,

A prime Enchantress – to assist the work
Which then was going forward in her name!

> Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth
The beauty wore of promise – that which sets
(As at some moments might not be unfelt

Among the bowers of Paradise itself)
The budding rose above the rose full blown.
What temper at the prospect did not wake

To happiness unthought of? The inert
Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!

(108–9, 14–24, emphasis added).

A cataclysmic event like the French Revolution prefigured the
advent of a Messiah: Emperor Louis Napoleon in France, the
Irish Catholic Liberator, Daniel O’ Connell, and Italian
patriots, Mazzini and Garibaldi, were but four figures of
messianic charisma who rose to leadership in Europe. (The
same trend was repeated in the twentieth century with
totalitarian dictators like Mussolini, Franco, Hitler and Stalin,
though with devastating consequences.) Numerous Romantic
writers produced theories which “admitted the possibility of
the entrance of a universal Messiah”.28

Probably the most sustained and daring expression of this
grand theoretical strain was seen in the work of Percy Bysshe
Shelley, who portrayed such a possibility in his Lyrical Drama,
Prometheus Unbound (1819–20), in whose Preface was
stated: “Prometheus is, as it were, the type of the highest
perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the
purest and truest motives to the best and noblest ends”.29
Revered by early humankind as the mediator of many useful

arts and sciences, Prometheus, outwitting Zeus, the chief
Olympian, climbed the heavens and stole fire from the gods
from the chariot of the sun and was punished by being chained
to a rock on Mount Caucasus until rescued from his torture by
Hercules; writing in 1841, Marx hailed him as “the foremost
saint and martyr in the philosopher’s calendar”.30 It seemed the
liberation of Prometheus from the tyrannical captivity of
Jupiter (Act III, Scene 1), like that experienced by citizens in
America and then in France from British and monarchical rule
respectively, symbolised the ultimate triumph of the forces of
human progress and an all-compelling sense of humanity’s
regeneration:

The loathsome mask has fallen, the man remains
Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed – but man:

Equal, unclassed, tribeless, and nationless,
Exempt from awe, worship, degree, – the King

Over himself; just, gentle, wise: but man:
Passionless? no – yet free from guilt or pain,
> Which were, for his will made, or suffered them,
Nor yet exempt, though ruling them like slaves,

From chance and death and mutability,
The clogs of that which else might oversoar

The loftiest star of unascended heaven,
Pinnacled dim in the intense inane (193–204).

In the figure of Prometheus’ consort, Asia, as remarked by
Professor Ross Woodman, Shelley achieves his apocalyptic
desire: her unveiling (“Some good change / Is working in the
elements which suffer / Thy presence thus unveiled,” II. v. 18–
20), which prefigures the Revelation of Christ returned in the
glory of the Father, is “a vision of the New Jerusalem
[Revelation 21:2] descending as a bride to earth, which is, by
virtue of her descent, recreated into an earthly paradise”31
Shelley concluded his Lyrical Drama, Hellas, written in 1821
and inspired by the Greek proclamation of independence,

followed by the war of deliverance from the Turks, with a
female Chorus combining a celebration and an entreaty:

The world’s great age begins anew

The golden years return,
The earth doth like a snake renew

Her winter weeds outworn;
Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam

Like wrecks of a dissolving dream ...

O cease! must hate and death return?

Cease! must men kill and die?
Cease! Drain not to its dregs the urn

Of bitter prophecy.
The world is weary of the past,
O might it die or rest at last! (1–6, 37–42).

An unmistakable note of apocalyptic excitement also runs
through Shelley’s most accomplished lyric, Ode to the West
Wind (1819), which ends:

... Be through my lips to unawakened earth

The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind? (68–70).

This eschatological theme was continued in poems by
James Russell Lowell, Edward Marshall, Alfred, Lord
Tennyson and a venerable, nationalistic hymn for North
America by Julia Ward Howe:

> Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of truth with falsehood for the good or evil side.
Some great Cause, God’s new Messiah, offering each the

bloom or blight,
And the choice goes by forever, ‘twixt that darkness and that

> light

(The Present Crisis, 5–8).

By your greater selves; and by the love I see flowing surely

from you to me;
By these I put all evil aside ...
I show you the inheritance of riches of all time.
Yet sorrow, the best of gifts, revealer of eternal joy, I give you

not:
But One shall come in the night-time, bringing it, to transmute

the world for you,
Taking you by the hand, even while you live, through the great
gate of Death, into Elsyian fields

(Towards Democracy).

> Ring out the shapes of foul disease;
> Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
> Ring out the thousand wars of old,
> Ring in the thousand years of peace.

Ring in the valiant man and free,
> The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
Ring out the darkness of the land,

Ring in the Christ that is to be
(In Memoriam A.H.H., Section 106, 25–32).

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are

stor’d;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword

His truth is marching on
(The Battle-Hymn of the Republic, 1–4).

Something of this excitement is even evident in the final stanza
of Hopkins’s The Wreck of the Deutschland (1875),
commemorating the death by drowning of five Franciscan nuns
exiled from Germany:

Dame, at our door
Drowned, and among our shoals,
Remember us in the roads, the heaven-haven of the

Reward:
Our King back, oh, upon English souls!
Let him easter in us, be a dayspring to the dimness of us,

be a crimson-cresseted east,
More brightening her, rare-dear Britain, as his reign rolls,

Pride, rose, prince, hero of us, high-priest,
Our hearts’ charity’s hearth’s fire, our thoughts’ chivalry’s
throng’s

Lord.

Adventist movements were started, the most famous of which
(and the inspiration for Lowell’s above poem) was that headed
by William Miller, a farmer and former atheist from Vermont,
New England, whose intensive reading of the Book of Daniel
and other prophecies from the Old and New Testaments had
firmly convinced him that the return of Christ was at hand. He
fixed the date of the return at 1843–4 (other variations being
1836 and 1866).

Like the Jews who eagerly awaited their Messiah but
whose religious leaders, attentive to the letter but heedless of
the spirit of Moses’ Revelation (John 5:46–7, Matthew 23:37–
8), had refused to recognise and accept the Divinity manifested
by Jesus of Nazareth (John 1:11, 1:29, 6:41–2, 7:25–36, Luke
7:18–23, 14:16–30, Matthew 5:17, Matthew 23:37, John
26:59–66), Christian millenarians misapprehended their
Scriptures by misreading their figurative language. Thus
Christ’s prophecy – “... then they shall see the Son of Man
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory”
(Matthew 24:30) – was understood to be literal with the result
that “on one notorious occasion a concourse of votaries
assembled at a designated spot to watch the clouds from which

before nightfall a white-robed Messiah was to descend to
earth”.32 Moreover, the followers of the diverse Christian
denominations and sects had all contrived their own Messiah,
Someone Who would conform solely to the expectations
which they themselves had conceived.

When these fervent hopes and expectations were not
realised – when no white-robed Messiah was seen to descend
on a cloud to earth – disappointment filled the hearts of
Christians and enthusiasm died away. (The Seventh-Day
Adventists, as Miller’s followers thereafter styled themselves,
refer to this period as “the Great Disappointment.”) The
unparalleled millenarian zeal that had animated so many
people was “channelled into the creation of nation states and
the class politics that represented centres of mass power”:33
absolute national sovereignty, though inseparably part of an
unprecedented process of what is now called globalisation,
became a fetish.

A telling comparison can be made between the optimistic
hopes pervading the excerpts of eschatological verse quoted
above and the poignancy, irony and cynicism so evident in the
poems of Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, Ivor Gurney and
Isaac Rosenberg – which graphically exposed the reality of the
First World War’s trench battles – and in T.S. Eliot’s gloomy
masterpiece, The Waste Land (1921), one of whose speakers
concedes, “I can connect / Nothing with nothing” (“The Fire
Sermon,” 301–2), to see just how the embers of millenarianism
had been kindled into the world-devouring conflagration of
chauvinistic aggression. In other words, the jubilant prospects
that had galvanised millenarianism became those that spawned
imperialism and the aggrandisement and vaunted superiority of
the white race, epitomised by this paragraph from the
Introduction to H.A.L. Fisher’s A History of Modern Europe:

> It is, moreover, to European man that the world owes the
> incomparable gifts of modern science. To the conquest of
nature through knowledge the contributions made by

Asiatics have been negligible and by Africans (Egyptians
> excluded) non-existent. The printing press and the
> telescope, the steam-engine, the internal combustion
> engine and the aeroplane, the telegraph and the
> telephone, wireless broadcasting, the cinematograph, and
> the gramophone and television, together with all the
> leading discoveries in physiology, the circulation of the
> blood, the laws of respiration and the like, are the result
> of researches carried out by white men of European
> stock. It is hardly excessive to say that the material fabric
> of modern civilized life is the result of the intellectual
> daring and tenacity of the European peoples. 34

For American expatriate Ezra Pound, however, writing in
the aftermath of the First World War in 1919, civilisation was
damned by his poet-persona, Hugh Selwyn Mauberly, “out of
key with his time” (I, 1), as “botched,” “an old bitch gone in
the teeth” (Hugh Selwyn Mauberly, V, 89–90). W.B. Yeats in
The Second Coming, referring to the Russian Revolution of
1917 (“Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, / The blood-
dimmed tide is loosed”) and unconsciously predicting the rise
of Italian Fascism in the early 1920s, bemoaned the decline of
civilisation:

... and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst

Are full of passionate intensity (5–8).

For him, the Second Coming – in stark contrast to Shelley’s
rhapsodic, melodious vision of universal regeneration in the
Fourth Act of Prometheus Unbound, a book Yeats regarded as
“sacred” – was a mysterious and terrible event, a nightmare
similar to that depicted in the Fifth Section of The Waste Land:

... And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,

Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born (21–2)?

Here is no water but only rock
Rock and no water and the sandy road
The road winding above among the mountains

Which are mountains of rock without water
If there were water we should stop and drink
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think

Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand
If there were only water amongst the rock
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit

> Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit
There is not even silence in the mountains

But dry sterile thunder without rain
There is not even solitude in the mountains
But red sullen faces that sneer and snarl
From doors of mudcracked houses

If there were water
(“What the Thunder Said,” 331–46).

However distorted its energies had been by the ruthless
colonisation of territories in Africa, South America and much
of the Middle and parts of the Far East, initially under the
guise of a tremendous missionary effort, millenarianism was at
some level an intuitive response to “a new spiritual force”35
that had suddenly swept across Europe and North America,
leading irresistibly to an unshakeable conviction that,
commencing with the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and the
American and French Revolutions, a New Age had dawned and
that the Kingdom heralded by Christ (Matthew 4:17, 6:9–10),
together with the “new heaven and [the] new earth”
(Revelation 21:1) anticipated by St John the Divine, was very
soon to be established upon earth. Apart from reading
Scriptural verses in an exclusively literal manner, the majority
of millenarians did not look to the Eastern hemisphere where
the sun of religion – Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism,

Judaism, Christianity and Islam – had always risen. For it was
in Iran (Persia), a nation darkened by religious obscurantism,
political corruption and an appalling decadence, that a young
merchant from the city of Shiraz, Siyyid ‘Alí-Muhammad (a
lineal descendant of the Prophet Muhammad), assumed the
title of Báb (Arabic for “Gate”) in 1844 and subsequently
made claims to be both an independent Messenger of God and
the Herald of “Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest,” the
Promised One of all religions. His revolutionary Cause spread
rapidly throughout Iran and neighbouring Iraq, and He was
publicly executed by firing squad in 1850. This martyrdom
“made a great impression on late nineteenth-century Europe ...
Monographs and literary works touching on the Báb and His
martyrdom were published in a number of European countries
...”.36 Following an assassination attempt on the Shah by a
handful of deranged Bábís, a pogrom of martyrdoms ensued in
the autumn of 1852.

The One for Whose advent the Báb had made ready the
way and Who would usher in a divine, global civilisation was
one of His own followers, Bahá’u’lláh (the Glory of God), an
Iranian nobleman and the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith. Despite
being stripped of His wealth and possessions and suffering
torture, persecution, imprisonment, the relentless opposition of
two of the Middle East’s most powerful despots, four
designedly repressive exiles, the treachery of His half-brother
and the death of His younger son, He revealed the equivalent
of one hundred volumes of Scripture and summoned the
world’s sovereigns and rulers – including Louis Napoleon III,
Kaiser William I, Pope Pius IX, Czar Alexander II and Queen
Victoria – to reconcile their differences and, through the
holding of “an all-embracing assemblage”,37 to implement
measures that would lead to the creation and maintenance of
world peace; the twentieth century would reap the whirlwind
of ignoring Baha’u’llah’s dire warnings to these and various
other political and religious leaders against injustice, tyranny
and corruption. During His own ministry He had established

His religion in fifteen countries; today the community of His
followers represents a microcosm of the human race, second
only to Christianity in geographical range.38

Bahá’u’lláh’s pivotal teaching was the oneness and the
inevitable unity of the entire human race in what He designated
a “new World Order”,39 which is to be the vehicle of a spiritual
commonwealth. To Professor E.G. Browne, an English
orientalist from Pembroke College, Cambridge, He addressed
the following words two years before His death from fever in
the Holy Land in 1892:

> That all nations should become one in faith and all men
> as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between
> the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of
> religion should cease, and difference of race be annulled
> – what harm is there in this? ... Yet so it shall be; these
> fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and
> the ‘Most Great Peace’ shall come ... Do not you in
> Europe need this also? ... Let not a man glory in this, that
> he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he
> loves his kind ... 40

On September 23rd, 1893 at the inaugural World Parliament of
Religions in Chicago, this statement was read from a paper by
Reverend Henry Jessup, who wished to share the “Christ-like
sentiments” uttered by the “famous Persian Sage” with his
audience.41

Representing a “challenge, at once bold and universal”42

to sexist, national, racial, economic, political and religious
creeds, the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, comprehensive and far-
sighted in its outlook (the “wine” of His ethical and spiritual
counsels) and precise yet flexible in its methodology (the
“wineskins” required to contain and convey those counsels in
upraising a divine social edifice), and with its view of
humankind as “an organic unit which has undergone a growth
process similar to that of the individual”,43 fell for the most

part on deaf ears: the clarion call had been sounded, but
Christendom, whose custodians had been bidden to keep
wakeful lest the Lord upon his return come and go like a thief
in the night (Matthew 24:42–4, 50, Thessalonians 5:2–4, II
Peter 3:10, 13), slumbered on leaving God to pass by.

Dancing to DNA’s Music?
The antagonism between religion and science began in earnest
in 1543 with the publication of Polish canon Nicolas
Copernicus’ theories of a heliocentric universe, which ran
totally counter to the Ptolemaic theory of a geocentric universe
which had long been supported by the Churches. The title of
his work was De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (The
Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres), of which has been
cogently remarked: “Not only was [it] about the revolutionary
motions of astral bodies, it was also revolutionary in itself in its
effects on human self-awareness and imagination”.44

So it was that in spite of hypotheses grounded on ever-
more scrupulous observation and systematic classification and
collation of diverse phenomena – Johannes Kepler’s three laws
establishing that the earth is but a minor planet rather than the
centre of the universe and that all of the planets travel around
the sun in mathematically predictable elliptical orbits, William
Harvey’s lectures in 1616 in which he first put forward his view
on the circulation of the blood and Carl Linnaeus’s new,
simplified rules for the taxonomy of flora and fauna published
in Systema Naturae in 1735 – Christians were enjoined by
their clerical leaders to continue to understand the Bible
literally. What might have been abstract or spiritual realities
clothed in the garments of symbol and metaphor – Christ’s
prophetic discourses or the scintillating, bizarre imagery in the
Book of Revelation, for example – were held to be strictly
literal and, because inspired by the Almighty, unalterably true:
since God’s natural laws were fixed and immutable, it was
reasoned, so must be the comprehension of those laws. This
intransigence also extended to all non-Christian religions. Had

not God definitively revealed His Will and Purpose through
Jesus Christ alone and until the end of time?

> And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and
> we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of
> the Father), full of grace and truth (John 1:14) (emphasis
> added).

> I am the way, and the truth and the life: no man cometh
> unto the Father, but by me ... (John 14:6).

> Neither is there any salvation in any other [than Jesus of
> Nazareth, the Christ]: for there is none other name under
> heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved
> (Acts 4:12).

> For there is one God, and one mediator between God and
> men, the man Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 6:15–16).

This narrow perspective on Revelation, already disproved by
the succession of towering Luminaries, Abraham, Moses and
Christ, recounted in the Bible itself, conjoined with Christ’s
pointed statement to His disciples on the relativity of religious
truth – “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye are not
fit to bear them now” (John 16:12) – made the recognition and
acceptance of any subsequent Luminary – the prime example
being Muhammad – impossible for those wielding ecclesiastical
authority.

These Churches, irreconcilably divided by Christological
and theological doctrines and dogmas since the fourth and fifth
centuries and by internal disputes over authority (exemplified
by the Great Schism, when there were rival Popes in Avignon
and in Rome between 1378 and 1417), showed themselves
more preoccupied with temporal influence than in the genuine
spiritual nurturing and empowerment of the laity; hence they
maintained rigid orthodoxies. Scientists or, as they were then

known, natural philosophers, followed the courageous example
set by Galileo Galilei – who, heretically enthusiastic about
Copernicus’ theory and having greatly improved the telescope,
was forced to recant before the Inquisition in Rome after the
publication of his masterwork, Dialogue Concerning the Two
Chief World Systems [Ptolemaic and Copernican] in 1632 and
who ended his days under house arrest at his Florence estate
nine years later – began to read the universe as a text whose
pages could disclose much about the interconnectedness and
interdependence of all created things and, eventually,
something of the origin of humanity: science became a
revelatory discipline while religion, in the hands of
authoritarian, self-serving and uninhibitedly worldly
churchmen, already reeling under the Reformation, closed its
doors to knowledge and discovery. Both Copernicus’ and
Galileo’s books were banned by the Catholic Church until
1835, the Vatican officially absolving Galileo of his “heretical”
astronomical discoveries only in 1993; it burnt Giordano
Bruno, whom it had imprisoned and tried for eight years, at the
stake in Rome in 1600 for insisting that the stars were actually
suns: “Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve
about these suns ... ” By the time of the Industrial Revolution,
science had proved itself an extremely effective instrument for
social betterment – as, for example, in the utilisation of steam
by James Watt in 1769 for steamship transport and, after his
death, for railway transport in 1825 (by 1870 England alone
had 13,000 miles of railway); by confining itself to an anti-
heretical code of morality and the absolution of innately sinful
souls through the purchase of exclusive ecclesiastical
mediation – “There is but one Holy Catholic and Apostolic
Church outside of which there is no salvation ... ” (Pope
Boniface VIII’s Unam Sanctum) – religion was increasingly
seen to be of little or no practical value by those with eyes to
see. The public focus began “to shift ... to an eager stress on
the present combined with an impatient hope for a social
heaven on earth in the near future”.45

It remains the view that the Victorian age was unusually
puritanical, one in which religion, at least of the conventional
kind, was largely evangelical in character and purpose and in
which austere moral conduct – whether social (propriety,
conformity, respectability, decorum, discretion, obedience to
authority) or sexual (women stereotyped as Madonnas or
whores and, like children, subordinated to men in almost every
sphere of public endeavour) – was the necessary straitjacket for
carnal impulses to the extent that “erotically charged” table
and piano legs were draped when ladies and gentlemen dined
and conversed together. Despite its overtly prudish ethos and
its severe gender and class stratifications, society had attained a
state of confidence, as conveyed in the speech of Prince Albert
at the opening of the Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace in
Hyde Park in 1851:

> We are living at a period of most wonderful transition,
> which tends rapidly to accomplish to that great end to
> which indeed all history points – the realization of the
> unity of mankind.46

Nine years before, the speaker of Tennyson’s monologue,
Locksley Hall, had “dipped into the future” (119) and seen “a
vision” of the denouement to the world’s conflicts and wars in
what he termed “the Parliament of man, the Federation of the
world” (128); this note had earlier been sounded by Scotland’s
Robert Burns: “It’s coming yet, for a’ that / That man to man
the warld o’er / Shall brothers be for a’ that” (For a’ that and
a’ that). Londoner William Blake and New Yorker Walt
Whitman (both self-published), in taut metre and rhyme and
incantatory expansiveness respectively, had proclaimed this
universality some sixty years apart:

Then every man of every clime,

That prays in his distress,
Prays to the human form divine,

Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.

And all must love the human form,

In heathen, Turk, or Jew.
Where Mercy, Love, & Pity dwell,

There God is dwelling too.
(The Divine Image, 13–20, 1789).

You, whoever you are!
You, daughter or son of England!
You of the mighty Slavic tribes and empires!

You Russ in Russia!
You dim-descended, black, divine-souled African, large,

fine-headed,
Nobly-formed, superbly destined, on equal terms with

me!...
...All you continentals of Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia,

indifferent of place!
All you on the numberless islands of the archipelagoes of

the sea!
And you of centuries hence, when you listen to me!
And you, each and everywhere, whom I specify not, but
include just the same!

Health to you!
Good will to you all – from me and America sent.

Each of us inevitable;
Each of us limitless – each of us with his or her right upon the

earth;
Each of us allowed the eternal purports of the earth;
Each of us here as divinely as any is here

(Salute to the Whole World).

Ever since Samuel B. Morse had sent the first telegram (bearing
the words What Hath God Wrought?) from Washington, D.C.
to his business partner, Alfred Vail, in Baltimore on May 24th,
1844, it seemed the world could at long last be shrunk to a

neighbourhood in terms of communication. This possibility,
however ambitious it appeared then, bore witness to the strides
that could and would be achieved exponentially in so many
fields of technology and science, that first telegram being the
prototype for today’s speed-of-light telecommunications.

It was during this period of peace in Britain (disrupted by
the Crimean War of 1854–6), yet confronted with the squalor
of mining and the ugliness of industrial cities, the ravages of the
countryside, the menace of mass unemployment, escalating
poverty allied to unsanitary, overcrowded slums as well as high
rates of infant mortality and contagious, often fatal disease and
the terror of economic crisis, that naturalist Charles Darwin’s
theories of physical evolution were published. These theories
were based on collections and reflections on the similarities
and differences between various animal species garnered during
his five-year voyage upon HMS Beagle to map the South
American coast and delayed for twenty years for fear of adverse
reaction. Not since Copernicus’s De revolutionibus in 1543
(also delayed in its publication), which removed planet Earth
and, by implication, man, its prime representative, from the
centre of the known cosmos, had such a thunderbolt struck.

Two of the postulates advanced by Darwin in The Origin
of Species that so perplexed and outraged church-going
members of the English-speaking public were that by a long
and very gradual process of “Natural Selection,” or as he
preferred to call it, “Survival of the Fittest,” the millions of
species of organic life on earth had developed from previously
existing species and that at the stem of a very complex family
tree there is probably one simple form of life – thus
contradicting the traditional belief in God’s creation of the
universe in six days (Genesis 1:1–31) – and that human beings
and apes are descended from a common but now extinct
primate ancestor – thus contradicting the origin of humanity as
illustrated by the story of the creation of Adam, the first man
(Genesis 2:7), and of Eve, his “helpmeet” (2:18–23).
Caricatured in the print media as a primate, he also won fierce

denunciations from conservative pulpits, instigating often
heated debate and disagreement between creationists and
evolutionists which continue to this day. With polemical gusto,
Thomas Henry Huxley, Darwin’s best-known “disciple,” stated
in an essay in 1860:

> Who shall number the patient and earnest seekers after
> truth, from the days of Galileo until now, whose lives
> have been embittered and their good name blasted by the
> mistaken zeal of Bibiolators? Who shall count the host of
> weaker men whose sense of truth has been destroyed in
> the attempt to harmonize impossibilities – whose life has
> been wasted in the attempt to force the generous new
> wine of Science into the old bottles of Judaism,
compelled by the same strong party?

... Extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of
> every science as the strangled snakes beside that of
> Hercules; and history records that whenever science and
> orthodoxy have been fairly opposed, the latter has been
> forced to retire from the lists, bleeding and crushed, if not
> annihilated; scotched, if not slain.

Darwin held to his discoveries when he stated in The Descent
of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871):

> ... man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which
> feels for the most debased, with benevolence which
> extends not only to other men but to the humblest living
> creature, with his godlike intellect which has penetrated
> into the movements and constitution of the solar system –
> with all these exalted powers – Man still bears in his
> bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin
> (emphasis added).47

What was perhaps most startling about Darwin’s theories
was that evolution was without purpose (which approximated,

as he himself acknowledged, to philosophical speculation
rather than scientific inquiry). Tennyson had entertained grave
doubts about teleological certainty after reading Charles
Lyell’s The Principles of Geology (1830–3) which, with the
vast collections of geological and fossil data available,
indicated a longer history of the earth than that of four to six
thousand years deduced from Scripture and taught by the
Churches:

Are God and Nature then at strife,
That nature lends such evil dreams?
So careful of the type she seems,

So careless of the single life,

That I, considering everywhere,
Her secret meaning in her deeds,

And finding that of fifty seeds
She often brings but one to bear,

I falter where I firmly trod,
And falling with my weight of cares

Upon the great world’s altar stairs
That slope through darkness up to God,

I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,
And gather dust and chaff, and call

To what I feel is Lord of all,
And faintly trust the larger hope
(In Memoriam A.H.H., Section 55, 5–20).

However providential the fall of a sparrow (Matthew 10:29),
chance, autonomy and, by implication, chaos, governed the
operations of the universe, itself the work of what Oxford
zoologist, leading Darwinist and best-selling author, Professor
Richard Dawkins, sardonically terms a Blind Watchmaker.

“DNA neither cares nor knows. DNA just is. And we dance to
its music,” he states in River Out of Eden (1995).

According to true religion, as opposed to the superstitious
fancies, false imaginings and unquestioning adherence to
monolithic but outmoded customs that represent the winter of
religion castigated by, for instance, Feuerbach and Marx,
evolution has been designed and orchestrated by God, and is
not the outcome of blind chance or chaos. Dr Anjam
Khursheed invokes two analogies – based on talks given by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the eldest Son of Bahá’u’lláh and the appointed
Interpreter of His Revelation, in about 1905 – to help explain
humanity’s origin.

First, the human species developed like the seed of a tree.

This seed was distinct and different from the seeds of other
plants from the very beginning, though there may have been a
time when other seeds physically resembled it. In analogous
terms, the fact that the human species evolved directly after
certain other species (invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles,
birds and mammals) does not necessarily mean that it was
derived from them.48 Second, human evolution resembled that
of a child in the womb of its mother. Although this child passes
through various stages until it attains maturity – at one time an
embryo and at another a foetus – it always follows one single
line of development. Similarly although the human species
evolved through different phases – those of an amphibian and
of an anthropoid, for example – it was always a distinct
species, uniquely endowed with the reasoning faculty,
undergoing a continuous process of refinement.49

Scientists in general, and biologists and naturalists in
particular, now recognise that a basic genetic unity underlies
all diversities of organic life: “We are one species, one people.
Every individual on this earth is a member of ‘homo sapiens
sapiens’, and the geographical variations we see among peoples
are simply biological nuances on the basic theme”.50
Interestingly, the concise, anthropomorphic account of creation
in the First Chapter of Genesis accords with the findings of

biologists on evolutionary process: mineral (lines 1–10),
vegetable (line 11), animal (lines 20–5) and humanity (line
26). Life itself is now estimated to have emerged near the
beginning of Precambrian time, the first of twelve distinct
periods of geological time, about 3.8 billion years ago.51

As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who defined faith as conscious
knowledge expressed as virtuous deeds, 52 stated at a public talk
in Paris in November 1911:

> Religion and science are the two wings upon which man’s
> intelligence can soar into the heights, with which the
> human soul can progress. It is not possible to fly with one
> wing alone! Should a man try to fly with the wing of
> religion alone he would quickly fall into the quagmire of
> superstition, whilst on the other hand, with the wing of
> science alone he would also make no progress, but fall
> into the despairing slough of materialism ... 53

> When religion, shorn of its superstitions, traditions, and
> unintelligent dogmas, shows its conformity with science,
> then will there will be a great unifying, cleansing force in
> the world which will sweep before it all wars,
> disagreements, discords and struggles – and then will
> mankind be united in the power of the Love of God.54

The restoration of the ancient harmony between religion
and science, faith and reason (sensibilities, as it were,
dissassociated since the Renaissance), the two complementary
pathways which can lead to a clearer understanding and more
intelligent and beneficial knowledge of reality, was spelt out by
Max Planck and Albert Einstein, two pre-eminent and highly
influential twentieth-century physicists:

> Religion and natural science do not exclude each other,
> as many contemporaries of ours believe or fear; they
mutually supplement and condition each other.

Religion without science is blind. Science without
religion is lame.55

Some Blessèd Hope
Fusing the subjective prerogatives of Romanticism with the
sensitive analysing of the nation’s health (or lack of it),
Victorian poets, deeply conscious of their role as spokesmen,
sought to occupy a middle-ground: stemming from his anguish
at the death of Arthur Henry Hallam, his closest friend at
Cambridge, at the age of 22, Tennyson’s In Memoriam A. H.
H. (published in 1850) also addressed the mounting crisis of
faith and doubt besetting his public; moving in an episodic
sequence from the poet’s own numb grief and profound
questioning at his friend’s untimely death to final recovery of
hope and faith in God’s omnipresent Will in the “Epilogue,” it
became the most widely read poem in Victorian Britain, its
popularity undoubtedly helped by Tennyson’s status as Poet
Laureate – and his sheer poetic skill.

If much Romantic poetry had been visionary, therapeutic,
celebratory and, in the case of Blake, prescriptive, that of
Victoria’s reign was unabashedly nostalgic (e.g. Tennyson’s
Idylls of the King, Browning’s A Toccata of Gallupi’s,
Arnold’s The Scholar Gypsy, Swinburne’s The Lake of Gaube,
many of Housman’s lyrics) and often consolatory. Thus Arnold
closed Dover Beach with pained, morbid resignation (the
“ignorant armies” of the final line perhaps an allusion to the
revolutions of 1848–9):

Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! for the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,

So various, so beautiful, so new,
> Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain

> Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
> Where ignorant armies clash by night (28–37).

William Ernest Henley composed the much-anthologised
Invictus (1875), its four elegant quatrains crystallising in
archetypal imagery his fortitude under the crippling
tuberculosis of the bone he had suffered:

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,

I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul (13–16).

In retrospect, the poet’s dilemma was how, in a social milieu
censured by Arnold for “its sick hurry / And divided aims”
(The Scholar Gypsy, lines 203–04) and growing indifferent to
anything but material comfort and satisfied with the guarantee
of an ever-expanding Empire on which the sun would never
set, he could in fact be master of his fate (nigh-impossible in
any case) if, on the one hand, God played dice with His
creation or, on the other, be master of his soul if he was so
closely related to mere apes.

By far the most striking, if not altogether original,
religious poetry of this later period is that which dramatises the
individual’s wrestle with God (the work of seventeenth-century
Metaphysical poets Donne, Herbert and Vaughan constituting
a notable precedent). Francis Thompson’s The Hound of
Heaven (1890–2) is a superb allegorical rendering in long,
breathless stanzas of this inner turmoil, of his soul’s petulant
refusal to accept the benevolence and compassion vouchsafed
by its Creator:

I fled Him, down the nights and down the days;
I fled Him, down the arches of the years;

I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways
Of my own mind; and in the midst of tears

I hid from Him, and under running laughter.

Up vistaed slopes I sped;
Adown Titantic glooms of chasmed fears,
From those strong Feet that followed, followed after.
But with unhurrying chase,

And unperturbed pace,
Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,
They beat – and a Voice beat

More instant than the Feet –
“All things betray thee, who betrayest Me” (1–15).

Exhausted but still restless after “that long pursuit” (155), the
errant Thompson, who had been addicted to opium and had
lived in poverty in London for years, finally acquiesces:

“Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest,

I am He Whom Thou seekest!
Thou dravest love from thee, who dravest Me” (180–1).

The mature poetic career of Hopkins enacts in microcosm
the shift from certitude to incertitude that occurred during the
second half of Victoria’s reign, when Britain had established
itself as the world’s foremost industrial, economic and colonial
power. The sequence of sonnets celebrating nature as the
intricate, awe-inspiring handiwork of God as observed in Wales
and completed in 1877 (The Starlight Night, Spring, Pied
Beauty, The Windhover, Hurrahing in Harvest), the year of
his ordination, seems the more starkly radiant when juxtaposed
with the “dark” or “terrible” sonnets written during Hopkins’s
deeply unhappy tenure as professor of classics at University
College, Dublin, four years before his premature death there at
the age of 44 in 1889. Of this opus – edited and first published
in book form by his friend and fellow poet, Robert Bridges, in
1918 – these late sonnets have subsequently been acclaimed
the peak of his genius, so emblematic are they of the human
being’s wilful separation from and, it would seem,

abandonment by God (“ ... my lament / Is cries countless, cries
like dead letters sent / To dearest him that lives alas! away” – I
Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, Not Day), so uncannily
prescient of both the existentialist angst, alienation and sense
of absurdity and futility typified by much modernist literature
and the clouds of despair with which the world’s horizon came
to be shrouded in the wake of two global wars, the Great
Depression, the Nazi Holocaust, the Great Purges in Stalin’s
Soviet Union and the nuclear bombing of the cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the latter a signal instance of the
moral choices available through the use or, indeed, misuse of
one of the most sophisticated of all scientific technologies.

There then emerged the post-Victorian or modernist view
that the individual – made in the image and likeness of God
(Genesis 1:26) and poised above the beasts but beneath the
angels – as a single and unified whole, a stable entity, was no
longer valid. Freud did much to promulgate this view. In 1900,
while assistant professor of neuropathology at the University of
Vienna, he published Die Traumdeutung (The Interpretation
of Dreams). Dreams or nocturnal visions were to Freud
windows on the subconscious mind, a singular blend of recent
experiences (manifest content) and wish fulfilment (latent
content). With proper analysis, the dream can be broken down
into its component parts and interpreted to reveal long-
suppressed desires, phobias, aspirations and fears. More could
be learned by dissecting the not always rational workings of the
mind and sublimated sexuality than from moralistic imperatives
derived from Scripture and credal formulae56 cloaked in
mythology, superstition, fanaticism and ultimately barbarism
(the Crusades, the Inquisition, Europe’s sixteenth-century
religious wars, prevalent misogyny, millennia-long anti-
Semitism that would culminate in the Holocaust):
psychoanalysis and psychotherapy could succeed in identifying
and healing neuroses where sacerdotalism and sacraments had
failed.

As the nineteenth century progressed, the idealism so
cherished by such Romantic poets as Blake, Wordsworth and
Shelley succumbed to pragmatism, itself euphemistic of the
brutal colonisation and domination of foreign lands and the
exploitation of their “inferior” peoples; noble, practicable
ideals of the eighteenth century – those of Democratic Justice
and of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity enshrined in the
American Declaration of Independence (1776) and the French
Revolution (1789) respectively – were defaced by attitudes
which were hegemonic, as evidenced in the lead taken by
France and Britain to expand their colonies militarily in much
of Africa during the 1880s. The promises of the American
Revolution became blighted by racial discrimination towards,
and segregation of, Native Americans and African-Americans
(particularly in its secessionist Southern states in the case of
the latter), and which would not be properly addressed at
government level until the 1960s; those in France darkened
into the Reign of Terror (1792) and, under Robespierre and
Emperor Napoleon, a bloodstained “civilisation” predicated on
the illusion of a Glorious Republic. The foundations of
national, class and racial conflicts of the near future were laid
or rather bolstered. Religious leaders perpetuated the
misunderstandings and confusion perpetrated in the name of
religion by failing to perceive the divine Educators of
humanity’s “collective childhood as the agents of one civilising
process”;57 by stubbornly clinging to “unintelligent dogmas”,58
they “erect[ed] artificial barriers between faith and reason”59
which have largely persisted to the present. Imperialism, the
offspring of millenarian motivations and energies, and the
leitmotif of the second half of Victoria’s momentous reign of
one quarter of the earth’s inhabitants, gained a deeper root
throughout the world and loyalties to peace, justice and unity
waxed and waned. Despite the historic interfaith fellowship
inaugurated by the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago
in 1893, the early twentieth century was ripe for world war,
particularly in Europe, which by then was primed for mass

destruction, as had been foreseen by Bahá’u’lláh when He
observed to E.G. Browne in 1890: “Yet do we see your kings
and rulers lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the
destruction of the human race than on that which would
conduce to the happiness of mankind ... ”.60 The League of
Nations, the prototype for both Tennyson’s “federation of the
world” and the “mighty convocation”61 of the world’s political
and religious leaders prescribed by Bahá’u’lláh as a means of
resolving international conflict, was formed only after the
involvement of over 30 nations and 90 per cent of the earth’s
population in warfare and the deaths of at least 10 million men
and the wounding of 21 million, with tens of thousands of
soldiers slaughtered in the space of only days during the three
stages of the Battle of the Somme in July 1916.

The bleakness of the end of the year and of the
nineteenth century was deftly evoked by Thomas Hardy in The
Darkling Thrush:

The land’s sharp features seemed to be
The century’s corpse outleant,
His crypt the cloudy canopy,

The wind his death-lament.
The ancient pulse of germ and birth

> Was shrunken hard and dry
> And every spirit upon earth
Seemed fervourless as I (9–16).

Listening to the “happy good-night air” (line 30) of “an aged
thrush, frail, gaunt, and small” (line 21), the poet is “unaware”
of “Some blessèd Hope” (line 31). With so much strife,
uncertainty, alienation, violence, terrorism, greed, corruption,
dehumanisation, dysfunction and misery engendered by the
erosion of transcendence and the deification of a callow,
hedonistic individualism and a rampant, enervating materialism
– characterised in the West by a rabid consumerism and the
divorce of values from facts (which has left in its wake moral,

social and intellectual bankruptcy) – the key word for many
then, as now, was “hope.” However fleeting or illusory, this
hope was that, though the vitality of belief in God and of His
religion as an efficacious social paradigm was being corroded in
every land, humanity, the finest fruit of a majestic evolution
stretching back billions of years, could yet be renewed. In the
words of Bahá’u’lláh:

> The whole earth is now in a state of pregnancy. The day
> is approaching when it will have yielded its noblest fruits,
> when from it will have sprung forth the loftiest trees, the
> most enchanting blossoms, the most heavenly blessings
...62
