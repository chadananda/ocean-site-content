> **Abstract:**  
>   
> From a scientific perspective, the 19-20th centuries witnessed unprecedented paradigm shifts with the emergence of the theory of evolution and the quantum and relativity theories. Today, these three highly successful theories are well established, but in combination, they have radically altered the scientific understanding of man and nature. The theory of evolution dramatically shifted the Christian conception of man as static and disconnected to a more dynamic and connected paradigm. With the theories in physics, diverse phenomena, which had been previously seen as separate and irreconcilable, were gradually and systematically unified. If the theory of evolution contributed with concepts of dynamism and connectedness, the theories of physics aspired for an underlying unity amidst a perplexing diversity of entities.  
>   
> The nineteenth century also witnessed the emergence of the scientific study of religion, which was greatly influenced by the nascent theory of evolution. Attempts were made which tried to encompass religions in grand evolutionary schemes. Such attempts have, however, been gradually and systematically discredited. With the rise and popularization of modern physics, certain attempts have also been made to understand religion from both quantum theory and relativity. Yet, from a scientific perspective, no theory of religion has had similar success, nor has it contributed to any paradigm-shift in our understanding of man and religion. Still, however, attempts, since the Parliament of Religions (1893) and similar subsequent endeavors, work for religious dialogue and aim to reconcile religious diversity.  
>   
> From a Bahá’í perspective, the nineteenth century is especially interesting, not only because the Bahá’í Faith is concurrent with the above mentioned scientific paradigms and sciences, but because it is seen as a new religious paradigm in the history of world religions. The Bahá’í Faith not only stresses a highly evolutionary and dynamic perspective of religion, but also emphasizes an underlying unity of religious diversity. Moreover, it ultimately aspires to unify seemingly irreconcilable religions, nations and peoples. In this context, it is particularly the" bedrock of Bahá’í belief" — the doctrine of progressive revelation — which is significant, since it is this doctrine that contains principles of both evolution and unity. Further, one of the most basic features of this doctrine is the idea of a chain of prophecy.

From Adam to Bahá’u’lláh:
The Idea of a Chain of Prophecy*

by Zaid Lundberg

> Contemplate with thine inward eye the chain of successive Revelations that hath linked the
> Manifestations of Adam with that of the Báb . . .         —Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings XXXI

he purpose of this paper is to briefly present a preliminary1 contextualization of the Bahá’í idea of a

T       chain of prophecy, which is an intimate and important feature of the Bahá’í doctrine of progressive rev-

elation. 2
Although the term “prophecy” commonly is understood as fore-telling, in academia it is better known as
forth-telling, 3 i.e., it has to do with “prophetology” rather than with “futurology” (although prophecy, admit-
tedly, sometimes includes this dimension as well). The technical term “chain of prophecy” can be found in var-
ious religious contexts other than in the Bahá’í Faith, and is not specifically a Bahá’í term. Generally speak-
ing, a chain of prophecy refers to a sequence (linear and/or cyclical) of mediators (prophets, mess engers ,
avatars, etc). It can be defined as “a sequence of religious mediators who operate between divine (supramun-
dane) and earthly (mundane) realms.”

This paper argues that variations, or family-resemblances, 4 of such an idea of a chain of prophecy can be
located in the following religious contexts, including some major and well-known religions of the world
(Islam, Christianity, Judais m, Zoroastrianis m, Buddhism, and Hinduism), as well as a few less well-known
religions (Bábísm, Manichaeism, and Jainis m), and branches, or sects, of religions (Shaykhism, Pseudo-
Clementines, Elkesaites, and Ebionism).

The Bahá’í Faith

The opening passage from the Kitáb-i-ˆqán above may serve as an example where Bahá’u’lláh explicitly
states the idea of an unending succession of revelation, ranging from Adam to the Báb. 5 Two main themes that
are relevant for this paper are therefore the closely related ideas of:

> •       the chain of successive revelations
•       the linkage of Adam and the Báb (and ultimately Bahá’u’lláh)

It is also significant that it is within this immediate context of the quoted passage of Bahá’u’lláh where
Shoghi Effendi first employs the technical term progressive revelation. 6

A similar statement “from Adam” is also found elsewhere in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán where Bahá’u’lláh refers to
“all the Prophets, from Adam even unto the ‘Seal,’ [Muhammad].” 7 The idea of a chain of prophecy can also
be found in statements by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, e.g., “From time immemorial the divine teachings have been succes -
sively revealed, and the bounties of the Holy Spirit have ever been emanating.”8 More specifically, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá speaks of “From the days of Adam” while implying the idea of a chain of prophecy:

> From the days of Adam until today, the religions of God have been made manifest, one following the other,
> and each one of them fulfilled its due function, revived mankind, and provided education and enlighten-
> ment.9

In another passage ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explicitly identifies various religious figures while expressing the idea of
a chain of prophecy:

> For the position of Adam, with regard to the appearance and manifestation of the divine perfections, was
> in the embryonic condition; the position of Christ was the condition of maturity and the age of reason; and
> the rising of the Greatest Luminary [Bahá’u’lláh] was the condition of the perfection of the essence and of

Lights of ‘Irfán

> the qualities. This is why in the supreme Paradise the tree of life is the expression for the center of absolute-
> ly pure sanctity—that is to say, of the divine supreme Manifestation. From the days of Adam until the days
> of Christ, They spoke little of eternal life and the heavenly universal perfections. This tree of life was the
> position of the reality of Christ; through His manifestation it was planted and adorned with everlasting
> fruits.10

In the last passage it is clear that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá uses various organic metaphors (embryo, tree, fruits) to con-
vey the accumulative growth of religion/revelation. He writes more elaborately on the idea of a chain of
prophecy in the following passage:

> All these holy, divine Manifestations are one. They have served one God, promulgated the same truth,
> founded the same institutions and reflected the same light. Their appearances have been successive and
> correlated; each One had announced and extolled the One Who was to follow, and laid the foundation of
> reality . . . the divine religions They established have one foundation; Their teachings, proofs and evi-
> dences are one; in name and form They differ, but in reality They agree and are the same. 11
In connection with describing the Bahá’í Faith, Shoghi Effendi states that “The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh should
indeed be regarded . . . as the culmination of a cycle, the final stage in a series of successive, of preliminary
and progressive revelations.”12 Shoghi Effendi is even more specific than both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
since he uses the chain metaphor in conjunction with a description of the Bahá’í Faith and progressive revela-
tion in at least two occasions:

> It [the Bahá’í Faith] should be viewed not merely as yet another spiritual revival in the ever-changing for-
> tunes of mankind, not only as a further stage in a chain of progressive Revelations, nor even as the culmi-
> nation of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles, but rather as marking the last and highest stage in
> the stupendous evolution of man’s collective life on this planet. 13
> [The Bahá’í Faith] readily and gratefully recognizes their [previous Dispensations] respective contribu-
> tions to the gradual unfoldment of one Divine Revelation, unhesitatingly acknowledges itself to be but one
> link in the chain of continually progressive Revelations . . . 14 [emphases added]
> More explicitly, Shoghi Effendi clearly connects the idea of a chain of prophecy with the doctrine of pro-
gressive revelation:

> It [the Bahá’í Revelation] regards them [the religions that have preceded it] . . . as different stages in the
> eternal history and constant evolution of one religion, Divine and indivisible, of which it itself forms but
> an integral part. . . . the fundamental principle which constitutes the Bedrock of Bahá’í belief, the princi-
> ple that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is orderly, continuous and pro-
> gressive and not spasmodic or final. 15

With regard to Adam, Shoghi Effendi states that “There are no Prophets, so far, in the same category as
Bahá’u’lláh, as He culminates a great cycle begun by Adam.” [emphasis added] 16 In the following passage it is
possible to see how Shoghi Effendi refers to progressive revelation and the chain of prophecy while simulta-
neously employing an organic metaphor:

> . . . the series of progressive Revelations starting with Adam and concluded by the Revelation of the Seal
> of the Prophets, marked by the successive appearance of the branches, leaves, buds, blossoms . . .17
> In addition, Shoghi Effendi also refers to Islam as “the succeeding link in the chain of Divine Revelation.” 18

The terms “Prophet” and “Messenger”19 are frequently utilized by es pecially Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
but the term “Manifestation of God” 20 appears to be the most commonly used epithet. The Manifestation of
God 21 is also, according to Cole, at the center of the teachings of Bahá’í. 22 Similarly, Saeidi states that:

> The doctrine of manifestation, the concept of manifestation, is a fundamental, central, theological, philo-
> sophical, and sociological concept of the Bahá’í Faith. . . . Everything should be understood, can be under-
> stood in terms of this fundamental category, in terms of this fundamental concept. [It is] not just one con-
> cept among other concepts, but the central conceptual category of the Bahá’í Faith.23

Although it may be correct to infer that the concept of the Manifestation of God plays a very central role in
Bahá’í, it is argued that this concept is integral of a much larger and more central doctrine—that of progres-

\[60\] From Ada m to Ba há’u’l láh

sive revelation. 24

The terminology, which is connected with the M anifestations of God, is rather exhaustive. The following
citation by Bahá’u’lláh may illustrate the abundant and complex variety of titles and metaphors that are ass o-
ciated with this concept:

> It hath, therefore, become manifest and evident that within the tabernacles of these Prophets and chosen
> Ones of God the light of His infinite names and exalted attributes hath been reflected, even though the
> light of some of these attributes may or may not be outwardly revealed from these luminous Temples to
> the eyes of men. That a certain attribute of God hath not been outwardly manifested by thes e Essences of
> Detachment doth in no wise imply that they who are the Day Springs of God’s attributes and the
> Treasuries of His holy names did not actually possess it. Therefore, these illuminated Souls, these beau-
> teous Countenances have, each and every one of them, been endowed with all the attributes of God.

[emphasis add ed] 25

In addition to the above stated designations, Bahá’u’lláh entitles the Manifestation of God as: “Tabernacles
of holiness,” “Primal Mirrors,” “Essences of Being,” “Day Stars of His divine guidance,” “symbols of His
divine unity,” “sanctified Beings ,” “Manifestations of His wondrous Essence,” “the Luminaries of truth,”
“Manifestations of the Sun of Truth,” “Manifestations of Holiness,” “Birds of the celestial Throne” etc.
Further, the concept of “manifestation” occurs also in connection with other epithets. In the next passage
Bahá’u’lláh enumerates various titles of the Manifestations of God and states that they are all essentially iden-
tical:

> By virtue of this station they have claimed for themselves the Voice of Divinity and the like, whilst by
> virtue of their station of Messengership, they have declared themselves the Messengers of God. In every
> instance they have voiced an utterance that would conform to the requirements of the occasion, and have
> ascribed all these declarations to Themselves, declarations ranging from the realm of Divine Revelation to
> the realm of creation, and from the domain of Divinity even unto the domain of earthly existence. Thus it
> is that whatsoever be their utterance, whether it pertain to the realm of Divinity, Lordship, Prophethood,
> Messengership, Guardianship, Apostleship, or Servitude, all is true, beyond the shadow of a doubt. 26

Although Bahá’u’lláh above seems to include a variety of titles under the epithet of Manifestation of God,
in His Kitáb-i-ˆqán He elevates the “Prophet endowed with constancy” who has revealed a “Book” and which
suggests the advent of a new revelation and the establishment of a new religion. 27 ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá is more explic-
it on this point since He clearly distinguishes between two kinds of prophets :

> Universally, the prophets are of two kinds. One are the independent Prophets Who are followed; the other
> kind are not independent and are themselves followers. The independent Prophets are the lawgivers and
> the founders of a new cycle . . . The Manifestations of universal Prophethood Who appeared independent-
> ly are, for example, Abraham, Moses, Christ, Muhammad, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. But the others who are
> followers and promoters are like Solomon, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. For the independent
> Prophets are founders; They establish a new religion and make new creatures of men; They change the gen-
> eral morals, promote new customs and rules, renew the cycle and the Law. Their appearance is like the sea-
> son of spring, which arrays all earthly beings in a new garment, and give them a new life. With regard to
> the second sort of Prophets who are followers, these also promote the Law of God, make known the
> Religion of God, and proclaim His word. Of themselves they have no power and might, except what they
> receive from the independent Prophets.2 8

Here one can see an important difference in that the independent Prophets, 29 i.e., Abraham to Bahá’u’lláh,
are “founders” of “a new religion.”30 These kinds of Prophets are also referred to as “univers al Prophets.” 31 The
“second sort of Prophets” is dependent 32 upon the former for whom they are “followers and promoters.”33 In
other words, the latter kind of prophets (Salomon to Ezekiel), 34 does not establish a new religion since they do
not reveal a “Book.” They do, however, “promote the Law of God” and “make known the Religion of God.”
Consequently, only Prophets “endowed with constancy,” or the “universal” and “independent Prophets,” are
upheld as Manifestations of God.

In the example above ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá enumerates six universal Prophets, or Manifestations of God, but other
sources mention additional religious figures , and therefore the following names can be added to the sequence:

Lights of ‘Irfán

Adam, Noah, Krishna, Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Húd, Sálih, Jesus Christ, Muhammad, the Báb and
B a h á ’ u ’ l l á h . 35

If one were to include both kind of prophets (independent and dependent) that Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and Shoghi Effendi mention in their writings, one could enumerate thirty-two religious figures (in alphabeti-
cal order):

> 1) Adam 2) Abraham 3) The Báb 4) Bahá’u’lláh 5) Buddha 6) Confucius 7) Daniel 8) David 9) Elijah 10)
> Ezekiel 11) Hud 12) Isaac 13) Isiah 14) Ishmael 15) Jacob 16) Jeremiah 17) Jesus Christ 18) Jethro 19)
> Job 20) Joel 21) John the Baptist 22) Jos eph 23) Joshua 24) Krishna 25) Lot 26) Mos es 27) Muhammad
> 28) Noah 29) Sálih 30) Solomon 31) Zachariah 32) Zoroas ter
Yet, neither Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, nor Shoghi Effendi specify a limited number of Manifestations of
God. On the contrary, the number of Manifestations of God appears to be unknown or unlimited. On this theme
Bahá’u’lláh states:

> [T]he Manifestations of His Divine Glory . . . have been sent down from time immemorial, and been com-
> missioned to summon mankind to the one true God. That the names of some of them are forgotten and the
records of their lives lost is to be attributed to the disturbances and changes that have overtaken the world.36

> [T]he manifold bounties of the Lord of all beings have, at all times, through the Manifestations of His
> divine Essence, encompassed the earth and all that dwell therein. Not for a moment hath His grace been
> withheld, nor have the showers of His loving-kindness ceased to rain upon mankind. [emphasis added] 37

Similarly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes that
> there have been many holy Manifestations of God. One thousand years ago, two hundred thousand years
> ago, one million years ago, the bounty of God was flowing, the radiance of God was shining, the domin-
> ion of God was existing.38

From thes e examples it should be clear that the forgoing mentioned number of six Manifestations of God is
not an exclusive number, since Bahá’u’lláh states that they “have been sent down from time immemorial,” “in
every age,” and even that “the names of s ome of them are forgotten.” Similarly, the quote by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
above supports this conclusion since He states that the Manifestations of God existed even as far back as “a
million years ago.” The appearance of a Manifestation of God, according to this view of prophecy, may be a
rare event, but it is not a unique phenomenon in the history of mankind. Although the list of religious figures
above seems to be limited to the Near and Far East regions, Bahá’u’lláh also says that “Unto the cities of all
nations He hath sent His Messengers.” 39 Together with the above sentence “encompassed the earth” it is pos-
sible to interpret such passages as an allusion to a global scheme of revelation. Consequently, the revelatory
process does not seem to be restricted to any specific time period or geographic locality.

Although the examples above are predominantly oriented toward the past it is relevant to turn the attention
to the future pers pective of the Manifestations of God. Thus, for example, in His Súriy-i-Sabr, Bahá’u’lláh
addresses this issue and states that “God hath sent down His Messengers to succeed to Moses and Jesus , and
He will continue to do so till ‘the end that hath no end’; so that His grace may, from the heaven of Divine
bounty, be continually vouchsafed to mankind.” 40 Thus, Bahá’u’lláh only claims to be the latest, not the last,
in a s equence of Manifestations of God.

The Middle Eastern and Iranian Contexts
Babism

Bahá’u’lláh was an early and distinguished adherent of the Báb (1819-1850), the Prophet-founder of the
Bábí religion,41 though the two never physically met. That the Báb was a promulgator of the idea of continu-
ous revelation is foremost seen in His claim of being the Qá’im/Mahdí of Islam. 42 The following passage the
Báb conveys clearly the idea of a chain of prophecy, not only in the past but in the future as well:

> In the time of the First Manifestation the Primal Will appeared in Adam; in the day of Noah It became
> known in Noah; in the day of Abraham in Him; and so in the day of Moses; the day of Jesus; the day of
> Muhammad, the Apostle of God; the day of the ‘Point of Bayán’ [the Báb]; the day of Him Whom God
> shall make manifest; and the day of the One Who will appear after Him Whom God shall make manifest.

\[62\] From Ada m to Ba há’u’l láh

> Hence the inner meaning of the words uttered by the Apostle of God, ‘I am all the Prophets,’ inasmuch as
> what shineth resplendent in each one of Them hath been and will ever remain the one and the same sun.43

Here the Báb explicitly asserts a chain of prophecy. However, this chain does not end with him, but He
prophesies a subsequent man yuzhiruhu’lláh (Him Whom God shall make manifest):

> For everything shall be set aside except His Writings, which will endure until the following Revelation.
> And should anyone inscribe with true faith but one letter of that Revelation, his recompense would be
> greater than for inscribing all the heavenly Writings of the past and all that has been written during previ-
> ous Dispensations. Likewise continue thou to ascend through one Revelation after another, knowing that
> thy progress in the Knowledge of God shall never come to an end, even as it can have no beginning. [empha-
> sis add ed] 44

Another, and more elaborate passage, can be found in Báb’s Persian Bayán:

> It is clear and evident that the object of all preceding Dispensations hath been to pave the way for the
> advent of Muhammad, the Apostle of God. These, including the Muhammadan Dispensation, have had, in
> their turn, as their objective the Revelation proclaimed by the Qá’im. The purpose underlying this
> Revelation, as well as those that preceded it, has, in like manner, been to announce the advent of the Faith
> of Him Whom God will make manifest. And this Faith—the Faith of Him Whom God will make mani-
> fest—in its turn, together with all the Revelations gone before it, have as their object the Manifestation des-
> tined to succeed it. And the latter, no less than all the Revelations preceding it, prepare the way for the
> Revelation which is yet to follow. The process of the rise and setting of the Sun of Truth will thus indefi-
> nitely continue—a process that hath had no beginning and will have no end.45

The probably cleares t example of a chain of prophecy is found in the Báb’s Kitáb-i-Panj Sha’n (Book of the
Five Grades) 46 where He explicitly writes of nine man yuzhiruhu’lláh (Him Whom God shall make manifest):

> His [God’s] exteriority in [the Qur’án] is Muhammad, the Messenger of God; in the Bayán it is [the Báb];
> in the Gospel it is Jesus, the Spirit of God; in the Psalms it is David, the upright of God; in the Torah it
> is Moses, the One Who conversed with God. And after the Bayán it is [1] man yuzhiruhu’lláh; and after
> man yuzhiruhu’lláh, [2] man yuzhiruhu’lláh; and after man yuzhiruhu’lláh, [3] man yuzhiruhu’lláh; and
> after man yuzhiruhu’lláh, [4] man yuzhiruhu’lláh; and after man yuzhiruhu’lláh, [5] man yuzhiruhu’lláh;
> and after man yuzhiruhu’lláh, [6] man yuzhiruhu’lláh; and after man yuzhiruhu’lláh, [7] man yuzhiruhu’l-
> láh; and after man yuzhiruhu’lláh, [8] man yuzhiruhu’lláh; and after man yuzhiruhu’lláh, [9] man
> yuzhiruhu’lláh.47

Although the Báb here explicitly mentions nine man yuzhir uhu’lláh, this number should not be taken at face-
value but rather as a symbolic figure. Thus, Lambden writes that the Báb “did not s imply speak of one future
appearance of Manifestions of God but nine or more such theophanies. In fact, He did not limit the number of
their successive and progressive Divine Manifestations in the world.”48 The following passage of the Báb
implies that the number of future Prophets indeed is indefinite:

> God hath raised up Prophets and revealed Books as numerous as the creatures of the world, and will con-
> tinue to do so to everlasting.49
Shaykhism

The Báb had been a student of Siyyid Kázim Rashtí (d. 1843) who in turn had been the foremost disciple of
Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá’í (d. 1825), the founder of Shaykhism.50 The Báb was thus well versed in the Shaykhí
school of prophetology. Thus, for example, Rafati writes the following about the Shaykhí view of continuous
and successive revelation:

> According to the Shaykhí theory, a prophetic cycle began with Adam and continued to the Prophet
> Muhammad. During this Adamic cycle, six major prophets appeared: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses,
> Jesus, and Muhammad. While most Muslims believe that Muhammad was the last prophet, Shaykh Ahmad
> maintains that Muhammad was the last prophet only within this cycle. . . . Shaykh Ahmad’s view of
> Muhammad as the final prophet only within the Adamic cycle implies a continuing divine revelation
> through a succession of prophets in a series of cycles; while each cycle has a beginning and an end, the
> cyclical process itself is progressive and continuous.51

Lights of ‘Irfán

Rafati explains that Shaykh Ahmad uses the analogy of the development of an embryo with humanity’s spir-
itual progress and were various prophets play central roles:

> According to the Shaykhí view, the six stages of embryonic development corresponds to the six prophets
> who appeared in the Adamic cycle: the stage of the life-germ corresponds to Adam; the stage of the clot,
> to Noah; the stage of the morsel of flesh, to Abraham; the stage of the bones, to Moses; the stage of the
> flesh, to Jesus, and the stage of another creation, to Muhammad. Following the analogy further, as the first
> five stages of embryonic development are prerequisite to the entrance of the spirit into the body, the first
> five religions are perceived as performing a preparatory function for the religion of the Prophet
> Muhammad. The last stage of the development of an embryo is final only in respect to its life in the womb,
> for the now completely developed embryo will be born into another world. Likewise, although the sixth
> stage of the Adamic cycle, i.e., the Prophet Muhammad, is the last stage of its cycle, it is, at the same time,
> the beginning of a new phase in the spiritual development of humankind and marks the inception of a new
> cycle.52

Here we can clearly see that although Muhammed is regarded as the “last Prophet” He is this only within a
cycle, i.e., the “Adamic cycle.” Thus, in Shaykhism we can enumerate the following six Prophets:

1) Adam, 2) Noah, 3) Abraham, 4), Moses , 5), Jesus, 6) Muhammad
Islam

Shaykhism emerged within the Shí‘í branch of Islam that historically has emphasized the continuity of rev-
elation after Muhammed. Yet, this succession was mainly restricted through the succession of Imáms.
However, what is of importance in this context is once again the idea of a chain of prophecy. An example is
the Isma‘ílís who believe that

> Prophets come in cycles which comprise a “great week” of seven thousand years. Each cycle is presided
> over by one of the Prophets . . . (Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad), as well as by an
> “intermediary” (wási), (Seth, Shem, Ishmael (Ismá‘íl), Aaron, Peter, ‘Alí), and a “permanent Imám”
> (Imám-Qá’im). . . .53
Similarly, the Ahl-i-Haqq “believe in seven successive manifestations of God, coming to dwell ‘in a gar-
ment.’”54 It is also possible to locate pas sages of an esoteric identification with previous prophets. For exam-
ple, in the hadíth al-Sahába, ‘ Alí55 is supposed to have made the following claim:

> I am Adam, I am Noah, I am Abraham, I am Moses, I am Jesus, I am Muhammad; I move through the forms
> as I wish—whoso has seen me has seen them, and whoso has seen them has seen me.”56

According to Nicholson, Rúmí (1207-1273) believed that “in every era there is a new manifestation of God,”
and in his Díwán, Rúmí states that “every instant the Loved One assumes a new garment, now of age, now of
youth.” 57 According to this view, the Spirit has appeared in various forms as: Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus.
Nicholson further writes that “In every generation he [the Spirit] was coming and going, until at last he
appeared in Muhammad and ruled the world and he became ‘Alí with his sword.”58

The Iranian al-Mukanna’ (fl. 755-85) went one step further and identified himself not only with various
prophets but with God:

> I am your God and the God of the whole world. I call myself by whatever name I wish. I am he who man-
> ifested himself in the creation in the guise of Adam, and later in the guise of Noah, later in the guise of
> Abraham, later in the guise of Moses, later in the guise of Jesus, later in the guise of Muhammed, and later
> in the guise of Abu Muslim, and finally in the appearance you now behold. 59

Although the Shí‘í branch’s interpretations of an idea of a chain of prophecy is not accepted in the Sunni
and majority branch of Islam, both the term and the idea of a “chain of prophets” 60 can clearly located.
Waldman, writing on the topic of Nubúwah (prophethood) in Islam, states for example that it

> has been God’s primary means of communicating with humankind, involving a long and continuous chain
> of revelation-bearers who were related both functionally and genetically . . . The chain stretched from the
> first human, Adam, to the deliverer of the Qur’án, Muhammad. . . .61

The idea of a chain of prophecy is further and lucidly depicted in s everal súrahs of the Qur’án.62 For exam-

\[64\] From Ada m to Ba há’u’l láh

ple:

> Say ye: “We believe in God, and the revelations given to us, and to Abraham, Ismá‘íl, Isaac, Jacob, and the
> Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to all Prophets from their Lord: We make no dif-
> ference between one and another of them . . .” (2:136)
> We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: We sent inspiration to
> Abraham, Ismá‘íl, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron and Solomon, and to David We
> gave the Psalms. Of some Apostles We have already told thee the story; of others We have not—and to
Moses God spoke direct—apostles who gave good news as well as warning . . . (4:163-65)

The two most common terms for “prophet” in the Qur’án are rasúl (messenger) and nabí (prophet).

According to The Concise Encyclopedia of Is lam, the former is a Prophet “who brings a new religion or a
major new revelation” and the latter is a prophet “whose mission lies within the framework of an existing reli-
gion.” 63 Some of the prophets are also referred to as úlú-l-‘azm (prophets endowed with constancy; Qur’án
46:35).

> The following twenty-six prophets (in alphabetical order) can be found in the Qur’án:
> 1) Adam 2) Alaysa’ (Elisha) 3) Ayyúb (Job) 4) Dá’úd (David) 5) Dhú-l-Kifl (Ezekiel) 6) Húd 7) Ibrahím
> (Abraham) 8) Idrís (Enoch) 9) Ilyás (Elijah, Elias ) 10) ‘Isá (Jesus) 11) Isaiah 12) Isháq (Isaac) 13) Ismá‘íl
> (Ishmael) 14) Luqmán 15) Lút (Lot) 16) Muhammad 17) Músá (Moses) 18) Núh (Noah) 19) Sálih 20)
> Shu’ayb (Jethro) 21) Sulaymán (Solomon) 22) Yúnus (Jonah) 23) ‘Uzair (Ezra) 24) Yahyá (John the
> Baptist) 25) Ya’qúb (Jacob) 26) Yúsuf (Joseph) 64

Yet, the number of prophets does not seem to be exhausted by the ones listed above, since some traditions
give the symbolic number of 124,000 prophets, 65 and, more importantly, becaus e the Qur’án (10:48; 16:36)
also states that prophets/messengers have been sent to every nation/community. It is also significant that some
authors even use the term “progressive revelation” 66 and “progressive disclosure” 67 in the context of Islamic
revelation.

However, although Islam clearly recognizes a chain of prophecy, a progressive disclosure of revelation, and
that a prophet has been sent to every nation, one of the basic doctrines of Islam is that Muhammad is khátim
al-anbiyá’ (the Seal of Prophets, Qur’án 33:40), and that Islam is the perfected religion (Qu’rán 5:3-5). This is
often interpreted as if there will be no other prophet after Muhammad and, consequently, that there will be no
future religion other than Islam. On this point, for example, Zaki writes that “the Qur’án abrogates all previ-
ously revealed scriptures just as Muhammad’s prophethood supersedes the miss ions of all previous prophets,
which are now rendered otiose of his universality” and that Muhammad therefore “retrospectively annuls . . .
all the prophets who had preceded Him and at the same time invalidates the claim of any future claimant to the
title.” 68 Similarly, Nadwi writes that “It was perfectly logical as well as inevitable, too, that after the complete
and final guidance had been vouchsafed to the Prophet of Islam, the chain of prophecy should come to an end
with him.” 69

This idea that Muhammad is completing a chain of revelation can further be seen in the following hadíth
recorded by al-Bukhárí (810-870):

> Narrated Abu Huraira: Alláh’s Apostle said, “My similitude in comparison with the other prophets before
> me, is that of a man who has built a house nicely and beautifully, except for a place of one brick in a cor-
> ner. The people go about it and wonder at its beauty, but say: ‘Would that this brick be put in its place!’ So
> I am that brick, and I am the last of the Prophets.”70

By using this brick/house analogy, Muhammad is depicted as “the last brick” and thereby completing the
“house of revelation.” He is thus seen as “the last of the Prophets.” In other words, although it is clearly pos-
sible to find a chain of prophecy in Islam, this chain is seen as ending with the Prophet Muhammad.
Manichaeism

Having briefly reviewed the Bábí-Bahá’í and Islamic views of prophecy, it significant to note that Andrae
asserts that “Mohammed’s conception of revelation . . . betrays a relationship to the Ebionitic-Manichaean doc-
trine which cannot be accidental.” 71 What is especially significant with the religion of Mání (216-276) is that
here it is possible to locate a prophet-founder’s first and explicit claim of being a part of a chain of prophecy.

Lights of ‘Irfán

An example of this claim can be found in the writings of al-Bírúní (973-1048), who cites the following from
Mání’s Shábúhragán:

> Wisdom and deeds have always from time to time been brought to mankind by the apostles of God. So in
> one age they have been brought by the apostle called Buddha to India, in another by Zarathustra to Iran,
> in another by Jesus to the West. Thereupon this revelation has come down, this prophecy in this last age
> through me, Mání, the apostle of the God of truth to Babylonia. 72
In this passage it is clear that Mání sees himself as one of the apostles who have been s ent “from time to
time” and to different countries. Thus, he recognizes the following series of prior prophets:

> 1) Buddha 2) Zoroaster 3) Jes us
> However, al-Sháhrastání73 lists another sequence of prophets:
> 1) Adam 2) Seth 3) Noah 4) Abraham 5) Buddha 6) Zoroaster 7) Jesus Christ 8) Paul
> Other sources also list Shem, Sem, Enosh, and Nikotheos74 as prophets. For example, Lieu writes that:
> We learn from the first discourse in the Kephalaia that Mani regarded Seth (or Sethel), the son of Adam,
> as the first of a line of special prophets from the Father. He was followed by Enosh, Enoch and Shem. After
> them came Buddha, Zoroaster, Jesus and Paul. After Paul, mankind was gradually led astray into sin until
> the time when there appeared again a just man who belonged to the ‘kingdom’ . Together with another
> righteous person they gave strength to the church. . . . After they had descended to the Land of Light, the
> church again degenerated and became like a tree which was deprived of its fruits. It was then that Mani’s
> apostleship began, as he was the Paraclete of Truth who was promised by Christ to this last generation. 75

Thus, a more complete list of the successive prophets of Manichaeism would include the following twelve
prophets:

1) Adam 2) Seth 3) Enosh 4) Enoch 5) Noah 6) Shem 7) Abraham 8) Buddha 9) Zoroaster 10) Jesus Christ
11) Paul 12) Mání

What makes Manichaeism especially interes ting in the context of the Bahá’í Faith is that Mání “believed he
was promulgating a new universal religion that would s upersede all others.” 76 Mání, however, did not only
uphold that his religion was a continuation or succession of previous religions, but that it was superior and
final. Consequently, Lieu states that Mání saw himself “as part of a chain of revealers which finally terminat-
ed with him.” 77 Thus, it is small wonder that Mání, centuries before Muhammad, used the epithet khátimu’n-
nabíyín (the seal of the prophets). 78 Although Manichaeism seem to have influenced Islam, it is also important
to note that Mání grew up in an Elkesaite environment.
Pseudo-Clementines, Ebionites, and Elkesaites

Another context in which the chain of prophecy occurs is the Judeo-Christian sects that flourished around
the first four centuries C.E . The Pseudo-Clementines refers to a collection of early Christian writings79 (325-
380) that were clearly influenced by Ebionism. The Ebionites were Christians who maintained the Jewish law
and claimed Ebion as its founder, but this term is more likely derived from ebyóním (the poor). 80 Earlier it was
seen that Andrae referred to “the Ebionitic-Manichaean doctrine.” Both the Ebionites (c. 200 C. E .) and the
Elkesaites (c. 100 C.E .) identify Adam and Christ as prophets . They also believed in a series of successive
incarnations.81 The Pseudo-Clementines and Ebionites als o speak of a reincarnated verus propheta (true
prophet). 82 This “True Prophet” is viewed in a recurring fashion as “the s even pillars of the world” and which
can be enumerated as :

> 1) Adam 2) Enoch 3) Noah 4) Abraham 5) Isaac 6) Jacob 7) Moses
> The eight and final pillar is that of Christ. 83 However, the idea of seven pillars that the world rests upon is ,
according to Schoeps, derived from the old Jewish Haggadah. He further states that:

> All the seven are alike in that each is a saddiq (righteous man), i.e., a true prophet. Also, the picture of the
> wandering Shekinah (the glory of God) was widely known and frequently associated with the seven right-
> eous men. The names change, but the patriarchs and Moses are constant members of the group; in them the
> glory of God returns to the earth after the sins of the earliest period had driven it away. The later cabala
> developed these views into a doctrine of the reincarnation of the original man Adam Kadmon.84

\[66\] From Ada m to Ba há’u’l láh

Schoeps refers to this chain of prophecy as “cyclical succession of the Spirit of revelation.” In discussing
its range of influence he states that it “extends from Elkesai, the Mandeans, Mani, and Mohammed, to the
Shiitish Imám-doctrine of the Hadíth” and that it s ubsequently was “translated back into Judaism.” 85 Above it
was seen that this idea of a chain of prophecy could be extended forward to Shaykhism, Bábísm, and the Bahá’í
Faith. The rest of this paper will show that this idea can be extended even further backwards to encompass not
only Christianity and Zoroastrianism, but also Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism.
Christianity

Although Schoeps does not mention Christianity, it is clear that at its center is the belief that Jesus is the
eschatological and soteriological Masiah (Christos) of Judaism. Thus, from a Christian perspective, He is
promised and prophesied in the Jewish scriptures (TNK)—the “Old Testament” —and the “New Testament” is
the testimony and the fulfillment of this promise. For example, in John 5:46 Jesus is suppos ed to have said: “If
you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for He wrote about Me” which probably is an allusion to Dt.
18:15-19 “Yahweh your God will raise up for you a Prophet like Me from among your own brothers.”86 Jesus
is indeed also referred to as a “prophet” many times in the New Testament 87 and John (7:40) even makes a ref-
erence of Jesus as “the prophet.” More importantly, Jesus refers to Hims elf twice as a “prophet.”88

At the time of Jesus it was also thought that some of the ancient prophets Moses, Elijah, and Jeremiah would
appear as a prophet revividus before the coming of the Messiah. 89 This is apparent in the dialogue of the
“Transfiguration” passages in e.g., Matt. 17:1-13:90

> After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high
> mountain by themselves. There He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His
> clothes became as white as the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with
> Jesus . . . The disciples asked Him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?” Jesus
> replied, “To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and
> they did not recognize Him, but have done to Him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of
> Man is going to suffer at their hands.” Then the disciples understood that He was talking to them about
> John the Baptist. 91

Although this passage suggests a more esoteric view of the chain of prophecy, it may allude to Jesus’
prophetic stature being on par with the theophanies of Moses,92 Elijah,93 and John the Baptist.94 A perhaps more
explicit example of a chain of prophecy is “The Parable of the Tenants ” :95

> There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a
> watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey. When the harvest
> time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. The tenants seized his servants;
> they beat one [1], killed another [2], and stoned a third [3]. Then he sent other servants to them, more than
> the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. Last of all, he sent his son [4] to them. 96 “They
> will respect my son,” he said. But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, “This is the heir.
> Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.” So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and
killed him. 97

Commenting on this passage Aune writes that “The series of messengers represents the prophets who were
prosecuted and killed by a rebellious Israel, while the beloved son is Jesus, the last in a long series of prophet -
ic messengers who have experienced rejection by the people.”98 Aune also writes of Jesus as “the final mes-
senger of God.” 99 Another passage, which is often employed by Christian adherents of a continuous and pro-
gressive revelation between the OT and the NT is Heb. 1:1:

> In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in
> these last days He has spoken to us by His Son.
Judaism

Although Schoeps refers to that the idea of a “cyclical s uccess ion of the Spirit of revelation” this idea was
eventually “translated back into Judaism.” Yet, the idea of a chain of prophecy can clearly be found even in
the ancient Hebrew religion (from which Rabbinical Judaism is the only surviving offspring). Thus, for exam-
ple, the Encyclopedia Judaica boldly ass erts:

> There is . . . no analogy to the Israelite chain of prophecy . . . which produced a successive line of prophets
> spanning several centuries who guided and taught the people, reproved and censured them for their sins,
> and threatened impending destruction or promised future restoration. 100

This, however, could be questioned since both Christianity and Islam make claims of being heirs to this
“successive line of prophets .” Still, Judaism is different from both Christianity and Islam since it has no sin -
gle founder or unique soteriological mediator, although Abraham and, especially Moses— “the paragon of
prophets”101 and “the master of the prophets” 102—play extraordinary roles. Thus, the Encyclopedia Judaica
states that “The classical prophets . . . considered themselves successive links in the chain of divine messen -
gers extending back to Moses.” 103

Judaism has a variety of terms for “prophet” e.g., náví (prophet), ‘ísh ha-‘Elóhím (man of God), ró’eh and
hózeh (seer).104 That the prophets have played an important role in Judaism can be seen in the very name of the
TaNaK105 where N stands for Nevi’im (Prophets). However, the prophets can be further subdivided into nevi’im
rishonim (“former” or “earlier” prophets: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings), and nevi’im aharonim (“latter” or
“major” prophets: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel; and the twelve “minor” prophets: Hos ea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah,
Jonah, Micha, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephania, Haggai, Zehariah, and Malachi).106

The following list of fifty-five prophets is based on the Talmud and Ras hi: 1) Abraham, 2) Isaac, 3) Jacob,
4) Moses, 5) Aaron, 6) Joshua, 7) Pinchas, 8) Elkanah, 9) Eli, 10) Samuel, 11) Gad, 12) Nathan, 13) David,
14) Solomon 15) Iddo, 16) Michaiah son of Imlah, 17) Obadiah, 18) Ahiyah the Shilonite, 19) Jehu son of
Hanani, 20) Azariah son of Oded, 21) Jahaziel the Levite, 22) Eliezer son of Dodavahu, 23) Hosea, 24) Amos,
25) Micah the Morashtite, 26) Amoz, 27) Elijah, 28) Elisha, 29) Jonah ben Amittai, 30) Isaiah, 31) Joel, 32)
Nahum, 33) Habakkuk, 34) Zephaniah, 35) Uriah, 36) Jeremiah, 37) Ezekiel, 38) Shemaiah, 39) Barukh, 40)
Neriah, 41) Seraiah, 42) Mehseiah, 43) Haggai, 44) Zechariah, 45) Malachi, 46) Mordecai Bilshan, 47) Oded,
48) Hanani, 49) Sarah, 50) Miriam, 51) Deborah, 52) Hannah, 53) Abigail, 54) Huldah, 55) Esther

Although both Adam and Noah have been considered as prophets in the above reviewed religions it is note-
worthy that neither one is regarded as a prophet in Judaism. Yet, even though fifty-five prophets can be listed,
the Talmud also states that the number of prophets was innumerable, or more precisely, twice the number of
Jews who left Egypt, estimated as being 600,000. Thus, the number of prophets would amount to 1,200,000. 107
Zoroastrianism

In the above contexts it was s een that Zoroaster was only mentioned in the Bahá’í and M anichean contexts.

The life-time of Zoroaster, or more precisely, Zarathustra (Spitaman), has never been satisfactorily resolved
since scholars are divided into two groups: (1) Boyce who estimates 1700-1200 B. C.E , and (2) Zaehner and oth-
ers who claim 628-551 B .C. E . Moreover, later Parsi tradition dates Zarathustra to have lived 6000 B. C. E., but
this date is not accepted by Western scholars. Thus, there is a great variance from 6000-600 B. C. E. However,
most scholars agree that Zarathustra was an historical figure and some even suggest that He may have been
the very first prophet or apocalypt in history, 108 or the “oldest known millenarian prophet.” 109 From the extant
Zoroastrian writings it is clear that He was zaotar or áthravan (priest)110 and that He also saw himself as
saoshyant (saviour),111 and mathran (prophet).112 Nyberg states that Zoroastrianism’s greatest innovation was
its prophetology and that “Zarathustra was the first who thought good, spoke good, acted good. He was the
first áthravan, the first rathaésr (chariot-fighter), the firs t vástryó.fsuyant (shepherd),” and “mankind’s first
lawgiver and teacher of the heavenly command.” 113

In the context of the idea of a chain of prophecy it is interesting that a scheme of ten incarnations exists in
the Avesta.114 It s tates that Véréthraghna (glorious power) appeared as follows:

> 1) Váta (wind), 2) Golden-horned bull, 3) White horse, 4) Male camel, 5) Boar, 6) Young man, 7) Váregan-
> bird, 8) Ram (?), 9) Goat, 10) Warrior115

What is especially significant in this context is that Nyberg writes that Véréthraghna “has wandered through
time and makes the unifying bond in the history of Iran.”116 Further, there is the notion of kavis (priest-kings)
who are seen as forerunners of Zorostrianism, and Nyberg states that “even very old Avesta-texts may have had
a fixed series of such pre-zoroastrian rulers and heroes.” 117 Moreover, both Nyberg and Widengren describe
Zarathustra as “primordial man reincarnated,”118 which sugges ts the notion of pre-existence. Indeed, this idea

\[68\] From Ada m to Ba há’u’l láh

can be seen in the division of the development of the cosmos and its three protagonists:
1) Gayó-maretan (primordial man),119 2) Zarathustra, and 3) Saoshyant.

This idea was also seen above in that Zarathustra was seen as the first priest, chariot-fighter and shepherd.

Thus, these examples illustrate the notion of a s eries of succession, although it is unclear if they have had any
soteriological function.

The idea of the Saoshyant (savior) can be found at several places in the oldest Zoroastrian texts—the
Gáthás.120 Gnoli states that “the concept of the future saviour is one of the fundamental notions of
Zoroastrianism” and that “the doctrine . . . had already taken shape in the Achaemenid period (sixth to fourth
centuries B. C. E.).” 121 For example, in Yasht 19:89 the Saoshyant is labeled as a “messenger of Ahura Mazda.” 122
Yet, the identification of Saoshyant with a future savior is quite misleading since Zarathustra, as was seen
above, also refers to himself as Saoshyant.123 However, as was also stated earlier, Zoroastrianism recognizes
three succes sive soteriological mediators after Zarathustra, although it is believed that the number of three
Saoshyants was a later development. 124 It is possible to enumerate the three future and successive soteriologi-
cal mediators of Zoroastrianism as:

> 1) Ushedar (Uchshyatereta), 2) Ushedarmah (Uchshyat-nemah) 3) Saoshyant (Astvatereta).

The three Saos hyants are depicted as “s ons” of Zarathustra although it is clear that they are born during the
last two millennia (i.e., the years 10,000-12,000 in the Zoroastrian calendar). The eleventh millennium is inau-
gurated with the arrival of Ushedar, who will “renew the prophet’s [Zarathustra’s] revelation and defeat the
forces of evil.”125 Here Boyce implies that it is the original revelation that is renewed. The twelfth millennium
is inaugurated with Ushedarmah, and the final Saoshyant (As tvatereta) arrives at the end of the final millenni-
um—in the year 11943.126 Thus, it is important to note that the time-span between the three saviors is approx-
imately 1,000 years, i.e., a millennium. Yet, it is possible to note, as Nyberg states, that “Zarathustra makes a
continuous series with his mythical sons, the apocalyptic saviours” and that “the appearance of Zarathustra is
the prelude to the eschatological event.” 127

Further, the last Saoshyant is, in the Pahlavi-literature, always identified simply as “Soshyant,” but the
Avesta refers to him as Astvatereta (he who embodies righteousness).128 Nyberg writes that Astvatereta is “the
pinnacle and completion of humanity.” As was stated above, Nyberg sees “Zaratustra as primordial man rein-
carnated” and likewise are “the apocalyptic saviours Zarathustra reincarnated.” 129 The evidence for this ,
according to Nyberg, is Yas na 46:3 where Zarathustra identifies himself with the Saoshyants.130 Similarly,
Widengren sees the three Saoshyants as “incarnations of Zarathustra as the divine Primordial Man” and that it
is therefore possible to discern “a clear series of four saviour-figures: Zarathustra, Hushetar, Hushetarmah and
Soshyans.”131 Although Gayó-maretan may not have functioned as a soteriological figure in the mythical past,
he may, since he is regarded as the incarnation of Zarathustra, s till be included in the series of soteriological
mediators. It is therefore pos sible to summarize and enumerate the following series of five successive soterio-
logical mediators of Zoroastrianism as follows:

1) Gayó-maretan (primordial man), 2) Zarathustra, 3) Ushedar 4) Ushedarmah 5) Saoshyant (Astvatereta)

The Indian context

Having briefly reviewed and discussed the idea of a chain of prophecy in the Middle Eastern and Iranian
contexts , we will now turn to three religions of Indian context: Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism.
Buddhism

The central figure of Buddhism is Siddharta Guatama (566-486/560-480 B .C. E .) 132 or “the Buddha.” Yet, on
this point Parrinder writes that “We commonly speak of Gotama as the Buddha, but every Buddhist, Theraváda,
as well as Maháyána, believes that there are numerous Buddhas, past and to come.”133 Thus, the theme in
Buddhism which is most relevant in this context of the idea of a chain of prophecy is the idea of successive
Buddhas, or Buddhavamsa (Lineage of Buddhas). This idea seems to be specifically Indian and ultimately
influenced by the Hindu avatara-scheme, and most probably, indirectly influenced by Jainism, 134 although
Gautama “Quite early . . . is perceived as one of several Buddhas in a series that began in the distant past.” 135
Related to this is the idea from the Játaka tales which states that the Buddha has gone through five-hundred

previous births136 and that, in a sense, there are Buddhas in preparation. 137
The idea that a Buddha is born in various epochs can, for example, be found in the Digha Nikaya:

> Know, Vasettha, that (from time to time) a Tathagata is born into the world, a fully Enlightened One,
> blessed and worthy, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the world, unsurpassed
> as a guide to erring mortals, a teacher of gods and men, a Blessed Buddha. 138
Moreover, in a passage from the Saddharmapundaríka (Lotus Sútra), the Buddha supposedly said “I am
repeatedly born in the world of the living.”139 However, Parrinder writes that the idea of succession of Buddhas
is already established in the oldest part of the Buddhis t Páli canon, the Sutta Pitaka,140 mentions six previous
Buddhas where Gautama is the seventh, but the future Buddha—Maitreya—is not mentioned here (although
He is mentioned elsewhere in the Páli canon). Thus, in the oldest canon it is possible to identify the following
succession of Buddhas:

> 1) Vipassi, 2) Sikhi, 3) Vessabhu, 4) Kakusandha, 5) Konágamana, 6) Kassap, 7) Gautama, 8) Maitreya
> The first Buddha, Vipassi, is s upposed to have lived eighty thousand years ago. Later texts, e.g.,
Buddhavamsa, does not mention only six different Buddhas but twenty-five, where Gautama is identified as the
twenty-fifth Buddha and where eighteen Buddhas existed before Vipassi. The Buddhas are as follows:

> 1) Dipankara, 2) Kondanna, 3) Mangala, 4) Sumana, 5) Revata, 6) Sobhita, 7) Anomadassin, 8) Paduma,
> 9) Narada, 10) Padumuttara, 11) Sumedha, 12) Sujata, 13) Piyadassi, 14) Atthadassi, 15) Dhammadassi,
> 16) Siddhattha, 17) Tissa, 18) Phussa, 19) Vipassi, 20) Sikhi, 21) Vessabhu, 22) Kakusandha, 23)
> Konágamana, 24) Kassapa, 25) Gautama
So far it has been shown that the concept of the Buddha is highly ambivalent and that Buddhism recognizes
a limited number in the succession of Buddhas. Yet, other Buddhist writings do not limit the Buddhas but enu-
merate either a greater number or an infinite number of Buddhas in the universe. For example, although the
Mahávastu views Sidhartha Gautama as the last in a succession in the present cycle, it still names thousands
of other Buddhas. Other texts e.g., the Lalitavistara and the Saddharmapundaríka, mention millions of
Buddhas. 141 Again the Mahávastu treat the “Buddha-lands” and “Buddha-fields” as asankhyeya (innumerable)
and that the Buddhas are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. 142 Finally, the Lotus Sútra states that:

> At that time Shákyamunibuddha’s emanations in the eastern quarter, Buddhas of the lands equal in num-
> ber to the sands of a hundred thousand myriad of millions of Ganges rivers, each Buddha preaching
> Dharma, assembled in this place, Buddhas of ten directions all gathering in order and sitting in the eight
> quarters.14 3

Although the previous paragraphs convey the multiplicity of Buddhas there are still Buddhist writings which
points in the other direction i.e., towards an underlying unity beyond the multiplicity of Buddhas. For exam-
ple, the Milandapanha states that:

> There is not distinction between any of the Buddhas in physical beauty, moral habit, concentration, wis-
> dom, cognition and insight . . . for all Buddhas are exactly the same as regards Buddha-dhammas.144
This text only treats the physical, moral and mental qualities, but the Sarvatathágatatattvasangraha and the
Lankávatára Sútra teach the unity of all the Buddhas. 145 Parrinder writes that the unity and identity of all the
Buddhas is implied in the concept of the Dharma-káya (Truth or Cos mic Body), and “therefore the Buddha
was actually all the Buddhas of the past.” He labels this idea as a sort of “universal pantheism or rather pan-
Buddhism.” 146 Similarly, but writing about the five celestial Buddhas, Lamb also states that:

> Buddhism came close to Hindu monism, not to say, monotheism, with the development of the notion of a
> primordial buddha behind the five celestial buddhas [Vairocana, Akshbhya, Ratnasmbhava, Amitábha,
Amoghasiddhi].147

Moreover, the Lotus Sútra depicts the vyúha (manifestations, emanations) of the Buddha. 148 Although the
two authors write about different areas of Buddhism, they reach the conclusions that there is the concept of a
transcendental Buddha who unifies either the Buddhas of the past or the celestial Buddhas. Parrinder summa-
rizes succinctly what has been s aid above as follows:

\[70\] From Ada m to Ba há’u’l láh

> The Buddha is not an Incarnation or Avatar of God or any other superior being. He incarnates himself by
> himself. Yet there is a transcendental element, and the Buddha is a substitute-deity. The Buddha himself,
> or the reality behind all the Buddhas, or the Dharma-body, is ultimate and omnipotent. He is either utterly
> transcendent and absolute, like Brahman, or both transcendent and personal like Vishnu. In Maháyána
> there are countless Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, yet as in Theraváda there is a determined move to show that
> fundamentally they are all one. This is not in the sense that there is only one Buddha at a time, to guaran-
> tee his supremacy, but there is a need to get the bewildering multiplicity of Buddhas to their unity in the
> one Buddha or Dharma. 149
Jainism

The religion of Jainism was founded by Vardhamana (599-527 B. C. E .), better known as M ahávira (great
hero), or Jina (victor, conqueror). The most important concept in Jainism in the context of an idea of a chain
of prophecy is the doctrine of the Tírthankaras (one who builds the ford, ford-finders, crossing-makers). They
are also referred to as Jinas, or Arhants (saints). Together with the Cakravartins (wheel-turners) and other such
heroes, they form the class of the venerated sixty-three personages of the Jain universal history. Together they
are called Mahápurushas (great men). 150 Caillat refers to the Tírthankaras as “Prophets who periodically teach
the world the truth of the imperishable Jain tradition” and that “Mahávíra was one of an unending succession
of tírthankaras.”151 Moreover, it is noteworthy that the J ain tradition is referred to as “imperishable,” which
could be seen as synonymous with an “eternal” tradition. However, what is interesting is the notion that the
Tírthankaras occur periodically and in a succession. Thus, Jainis m enumerates twenty-four Tírthankaras who
“are said to appear at given periods in selected regions.”152 Parrinder states that this succession may be the old-
est and is perhaps the origin of the development of the twenty-five Buddhas of Buddhism.153 The twenty-four
Tírthankaras can be enumerated as follows:

> 1) Rishabha 2) Ajita, 3) Sambhava, 4) Abhinandana, 5) Sumati, 6) Padmaprabha, 7) Supárshva, 8)
> Candraprabha, 9) Suvidhi (Pushpadanta), 10) Shítala, 11) Shreyámsa, 12) Vásupújya, 13) Vimala, 14)
> Ananta, 15) Dharma, 16) Shánti, 17) Kunthu, 18) Ara, 19) Malli, 154 20) Munisuvrata, 21) Nami, 22)
> (Arista)nemi, 23) Párshva, 24) Mahávíra
> According to the Jain tradition, the first Tírthankara, Rishabha, lived eight million years ago.
Hinduism

The idea of a chain of prophecy can in Hinduism best be found in the doctrine of avatars. The concept of
avatára is often thought of as equivalent to “incarnation,” 155 but etymologically speaking, the word means
rather “descent” or “down-coming.” 156 It is also interesting that the term was historically coined fairly late and
that the word prádurbháva (manifes tation) is rather more frequent in the older texts. 157 Some authors suggest
that the “germ of the doctrine of the Avatar” can be derived from the Purusha-sukta in Rig Veda.158 Yet, the
word avatára neither occurs in the four Vedas, nor in the classical Upanishads, but it is implicitly referred to
in the later Upanishads.159 A classic list over the dashávatára (ten avatars) was later established in an appen-
dix to the great Indian epic Mahábhárata, called Harivamshá (c. 600 C. E .). The names and the numbers of the
avatars differ in various works (from ten, twenty-two, and thirty-nine, or innumerable), but according ten-
avatar-scheme160 the common avatars of Vishnu are:

> 1) Fish (matsya), 2) Tortiose (kúrma), 3) Boar (varáha), 4) Man-Lion (Nara-simha), 5) Dwarf (vámana),
6) Ráma with the axe (Parashu-Ráma) 7) Ráma of the Rámáyana, 8) Krishna, 9) the Buddha, 10) Kalkin.

Although this scheme clearly differs from the Zoroastrian scheme on several points, one can still recognize
a few similarities: the fact that there are ten “incarnations,” the Boar (varáha), and that both Vishnu and
Véréthraghna appear in both animal and human forms. It is also possible to recognize a few animals that are
associated with the Jain Tírthanakaras, e.g., Bull, Horse, Boar, and Goat. M oreover, the fourteenth
Tírthanakara, Anantanatha, is s ometimes associated with the Falcon, and Véréthraghna also appears as the
Váregan-bird.

> The twenty-two-avatar-scheme enumerates the following:
> 1) Primeval man (Purusha), 2) Boar (varáha), 3) Nárada, 4) Nara and Naráyána, 5) Kapila, 6) Dattátreya,
> 7) Yajna, 8) Rishabha, 161 9) Prithu, 10) Fish (matsya), 11) Tortiose (kúrma), 12) Dhanvan-tari, 13) Mohiní,

> 14) Man-Lion (Nara-simha), 15) Dwarf (vámana), 16) Ráma with the axe (Parashu-Ráma), 17) Veda-
Vyása, 18) Ráma, 19) Bala-ráma, 20) Krishna, 21) Buddha, 22) Kalkin.

As was seen in Zoroastrianism, each Saoshyant was associated with “his own time” (millennium) and the
three soteriological mediators after Zarathustra were concentrated to and identified with the last two millen-
nia, but the Indian schemes associates a soteriological mediator with each age or cycle. 162

Comparisons and Conclusions

Having reviewed the idea of a chain of prophecy in the Middle Eastern, Iranian and Indian contexts, it
should by now be clear that the idea of a chain of prophecy—above defined as “a sequence of religious medi-
ators who operate between divine (supramundane) and earthly (mundane) realms ” —is not the exception but
rather the rule in some of the world’s great religions. Yet, it has also been shown that in the great Semitic reli-
gions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) no Indian or Iranian figures could be found. Conversely, in the three
Indian religions reviewed (Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism) neither Semitic nor Iranian figures could be locat-
ed. Moreover, in Zoroastrianism no Semitic or Indian figures could be identified, although a few parallels
could be noted between Zoroastrianism and Hinduism. Even though it appears as we have three independent
religious “strands” (Semitic, Iranian, Indian) it is significant that they all have, nevertheless, developed a fam-
ily-resemblance of an idea of a chain of prophecy.

If one were to compare which prophets that are the most common in the Semitic strand163 with that of the
Bahá’í Faith, one would immediately recognize many of the above reviewed religious figures (except Krishna
and the Báb). This comparison could be depicted as follows:

The only figure that occurs across all the religions in the Semitic strand is Abraham. Jesus appears in all tra-
ditions except Judaism. As was mentioned earlier it is noteworthy that neither Adam nor Noah appears in
Judaism. Similarly, it is peculiar that Mos es does not appear as a prophet in Manichaeis m.

One major difference, however, between these three strands is that the Semitic and Iranian are predomi-
nantly linear whereas the Indian is cyclical. Moreover, it was also seen that of all the religious contexts
reviewed, two religions—Manicheism and the Bahá’í Faith—clearly included prophets/Manifestations of God
from all three strands.

Thus, Mání includes from the
> •     Semitic strand: Adam, Seth, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Christ, Paul
> •       Indian strand: Buddha
•      Iranian strand: Zarathustra

Similarly, but more extensively, the Bahá’í Faith includes from the
•       Semitic strand: Adam, Abraham, Daniel, David, Ezekiel, Hud, Isaac, Isaiah, Ishmael, Jacob,

> Jeremiah, Jesus Christ, Jethro, Job, Joel, John the Baptist, Jos eph, Joshua, Lot, Moses,
> Muhammad, Noah, Sálih, Solomon, Zachariah
> •       Indian strand: Krishna (Kalkin) and Buddha (Maitreya)
> •       Iranian strand: Zarathustra and the Báb
•       Chinese strand: Confucius

Although Manichaeism and the Bahá’í Faith draw from similar strands, the emphas is is in both cases clear-
ly on the Semitic strand. One striking difference, however, is that the Bahá’í Faith does not include Mání in its
chain of prophecy.167 Another difference is that Bahá’í Faith includes a fourth s trand—the Chinese—although
Confucius is not regarded as a Manifestation of God in the Bahá’í Faith. 168

Even though it was stated that we could speak of three independent strands, it is clear that scholars of reli-
gion believe that these different traditions have directly or indirectly influenced each other. For example, writ-
ing on the influence of Zoroastrianism on Judais m, Duchesne-Guillemin states that:

> [T]he influence of Zoroastrianism on the evolution which came to light in Judaism from the time of the
> Exile onwards and through the manifold contacts with Iran which were to follow. The development in
> Palestine of the doctrines of Apocalypse, Kingdom of God, Last Judgment, Resurrection, Man and Son of
> Man, Prince of this World, or Prince of Darkness, and Saviour, was to prepare a milieu capable of receiv-
> ing and interpreting the message of the life, the word, and the death of Jesus. 169

Similarly, Amanat writes of the “Pers o-Mesopotamian melting pot of the formative Islamic age” where “the
Mahdí of Muslim eschatology acquired many features of his Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian predeces-
sors.”170 Amanat thus seems to be in agreement with other scholars of religion who have noticed that the idea
of the Mahdí171 is part of a greater and assimilated religious heritage where the Iranian tradition of
Zoroastrianism and the Semitic traditions 172 have mixed and recycled ideas in a syncretistic fashion. Thus,
although we may see the Semitic and Iranian traditions as distinct, we could also, as Hodgson calls it, speak
of “the Irano-Semitic tradition.” 173

Yet, the idea of “the Irano-Semitic tradition” does not explain the development of the idea of a chain of
prophecy in an Indian context. On this point Lamb writes that:

> All Buddhists accept the phenomenon of Maitreya the future Buddha, who, according to most views,
> abides in Tusita heaven as a boddhisattva. Early on, Buddhism may have come under the influence of
> Zoroastrianism. By the beginning of the Christian era the cult of a Buddhist Messiah was widespread.17 4

Thus, Lamb suggests a Zoroastrian influence on Buddhism. Although the Zoroastrian view of cosmos is lin-
ear, Widengren calls this the “doctrine of cyclic revelation” and he goes much further than Lamb when he
states that this doctrine

> is so intimately bound up with the original Zoroastrian teaching of the four successive saviours, viz.
> Zarathustra and the three Saoshyants, that its ancient Iranian origin cannot well be challenged . . . And last
> but not least: the doctrine of cyclic revelation, as an Iranian theoloumenon, shows so much resemblance
> with the Indian avatara speculation that, in all probábílity, we are able to assume the existence of an ancient
> Indo-Iranian dogma of revelation as the real background of the doctrine of Mani in this case.175

In other words, we may speak not only of “the Irano-Semitic tradition” but of an “Indo-Iranian dogma of
revelation.” Buck seems to be in agreement with this when he also refers to the concept of “cyclic revelation” :

> The later Elkesaite movement had adopted Jewish-Christian ideas of cyclic revelation which show a strong
> affinity with the Ebionite-Christian concepts found in the Pseudo-Clementines. It appears from all of this
> evidence that the doctrine of cyclic revelation itself cyclically recurs, e.g. in the doctrines of
> Zoroastrianism, Ebionite Christianity, Manichaeism, Islam, and the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths, as well as in
> Buddhist thought and Hindu apocalypse. 176
To oversimplify, a few scholars of religion seem to suggest a pattern of influence in the following manner:177
(Indian Strand) Hinduism            ⁄ J ainism ⁄          Buddhism

‹
(Iranian Strand) Zoroastrianism

> (Semitic Strand) Judaism ⁄ Christianity ⁄ Elkesaites, Ebionites, Pseudo-Clementines ⁄
> Manichaeism ⁄ Islam ⁄ Shaykhism ⁄ Bábism ⁄ the Bahá’í Faith
In this view the “Indo-Iranian dogma of revelation” lies at the core and eventually influences “the Irano-
Semitic tradition.” Such a tradition is clearly expressed by Mání in the Second Century C. E . who is well aware
of not only the Semitic and the Iranian strands but the Indian as well. Being a native of Babylon
(M esopotamia/modern Iraq) he was geographically situated between the Semitic and Indian strands. Aware of
Zarathustra, the Buddha and the Christ, he claimed to be their fulfillment. Similarly, Bahá’u’lláh, seventeen
centuries later, and although a native of Iran, it was in Baghdad, Iraq where he claimed to be the fulfillment of
all previous prophets and manifestations of God.

and Inca rnation. Gon da 1960:2 69 defines an avatar as an “appearance” rather than an incarnation.
156) “From a verb trí, to cross over, attain , save, with the p refix ava, do wn ; and so ava-trí, descen d into app ear, become in carnate.”

> Parrind er 1 970:19 . It is interestin g here to note that the verb trí also can mean “save.” Thus, even from an etymological po int
> of v iew, to label the avatars as “soteriological mediators” appears to be fair.
157) See Abegg 1928 :39 and Parrinder 1970:20 . According to Parrin der 19 70:71 even s uch a late work as the Harivamsha “speaks

> of an incarnatio n as a ‘manifestation’ (pradúrbháva) rather than avatára, which is a popular term.” Parrinder 1970:230, 226
> further states that “It is a modern Hind u belief that the Avatars are . . . manifesta tions of God in them” or that they are “theo -
> phanies, ma nifestation s of th e divine in visible form.” It is also important to note that not all Hindu s believe in the avatar-
> scheme as depicted in th e class ical texts . Parrinder 1970:100 writes that s ome of th e modern Indian mo vements, e.g. Prarthana
> Samáj s tates that ‘God does not incarnate himself ’ and that accordin g to the Árya Samáj ‘the doctrin e of avatáras, or divine
> incarnation s, is denied’.

> 158) Parrin der 1 970:16-17 . Rig Veda 10: 90.
160) The different lis ts on the ten-avatar-scheme v aries. See e.g., Mahábhárata (XII. 389, 104, EM), Váyu Purána, and the entry

on “Avatára” in ER pp. 14-15.

> 161) Rishabha is the first J aina tírthankara.
> 162) Widengren 1971:268-269.
163) Omitting Shaykh ism and Bábism due to lack of s pace, b ut still noting that bo th of th ese enu merate the identical prop hets as

Islam above.
164) As was noted earlier Gayó-maretan was referred to as “primordial man,” Adam is als o sometimes, e.g ., Promulg ation of

Universal Peace:229, s een in the Bahá’í Faith as the progenitor of mankind.
165) Shoghi Effen di Go d Pas ses By:94-95 claims th at Bahá’u’lláh is the fulfillmen t o f the Zo ro astrian expected savio r Sh áh

Bahram. For a more in-depth analy sis of this relatio nship see Buck 1 998.
166) Shoghi Effendi God Passes By:9 4 claims that Bahá’u ’lláh is th e fulfillment o f the Hind u expected savior Kalkin (“rein carna-

> tion of Kris hna”) and th e Buddhist M aitrey a (“fifth Buddha”). For a more in-d epth analysis of this relation ship s ee Buck 1981,
> 1986.

> 167) One explanation of this co uld be that M anich aeism was a relig ion that ultimately “failed.”
168) “Confucius was not a Prophet. It is quite correct to say he is the founder of a moral system and a great reformer.” Letter s from

the Guardian to Au stralia and New Zea land, p. 41.

171) From al-Mahdí (the gu ided one) and which refers, according to the twelfth Imám o f the twelver Shí‘ah, M uhammad b. Has an

> al- ’ Askari (b. 869), als o k nown as Muh ammad al-Mahdí. The Mahdí is also known as al-Qá’im (the one who will arise, the
> ariser), al-Muntazár (the awaited one), al-Qá’im al-Muntazár (the awaited Qá’im), al-Hujja (the Proof), Sáhib al-Amr (Master
> of Comman d), Sáhib al-Zamán (Master of the Age). Other frequent terms that are related with the reappearance of the Mahdí
> are qiyám (rise), qiyáma (resu rrection), zuhúr (app earan ce, emergence), raj’a (return) and khurúj (coming fo rth). See Sachedina
> 198 1; Halm 1991; EI “AL-MAHDS.”
172) The religion of Mán í and the subsequent development of Man ichaeis m was in itself a g reat example of a highly s yncretistic

> religion, combining elements from both the J udeo-Christian and Zoroas trian tradition s. See e.g ., Widengren 1945, 1973; Lieu
> 198 5, 1994 .

177) Ho wever, th e influence of the idea of the chain o f prophecy must not be s een as a direct and u nilinear p ro cess of influence.

Fowler 1982:4 3 makes an impo rtan t point in this con text: “In generic resemblance, the direct line of des cent is not so dominant

\[78\] From Ada m to Ba há’u’l láh

> that th e genre theory can be iden tified with source criticis m. We n eed to leave room for po lygenesis . . . and for more remote
