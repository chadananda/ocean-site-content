Introduction a nd Overview

Though the Bahá’í writings are explicit and, in important regards,
unique in their exposition of the concept of unity, the Bahá’í
conception is not without significant historical and intellectual
precedent. This essay attempts to highlight several of the more
prominent of these underpinnings by considering, however
summarily, the history of the concept of unity (and its inseparable
counterpart: the concept of causality) as it developed in ancient
Greek thought, Neoplatonism, and, subsequently, in Islamic
philosophy and mysticism.

In particular, the following points are discussed: (1) the Greek
account of the eternity of being and of God as the Sun of Reality;
(2) the Neoplatonic account of creation by way of emanation; (3) the
accounts of various Muslim thinkers (particularly Fárábí, al-Ghazálí,
Suhrawardí, and Ibn `Arabí) joining the concepts of creation and
revelation and introducing an account of the unity of being by way
of the names and attributes of God; (4) the anomaly of Ibn Rushd in
the post-Ghazálí Islamic world, his resurrection of Aristotelianism,
and his significant impacted upon Europe; (5) the Bahá’í concept of
unity, its inheritance and systematization of the insights of its
intellectual predecessors (particularly that of Ibn `Arabí), its
distinction in establishing the Manifestation of God, rather than
God, per se, as the ground of the unity of being, and its implications
in light of the Bahá’í assertion that the Supreme Manifestation has
appeared.

It should be noted that, in relying upon several primary Greek
sources, the Qur’an, and secondary sources on Islamic philosophy,1
this paper seeks to provide an introductory and cursory overview of
the respective treatments of this problematic, as a prelude to further
study. As such, it makes no attempt to undertake a thorough, let
alone detailed, review of Islamic philosophy, nor does it attempt to
detail the social history of the flow of ideas through the three contexts.

102          Unity and Causality

Background: the Basic Pr oblem of Being

Before considering the question of unity, and the multiple
historical accounts thereof, brief consideration should be given to
the even more fundamental problem of “being.” One of the earliest
and most historically influential formulations of this problematic
can be found in the writings of the Ancient Greeks, consisting,
essentially, of the following debate: although Parmenides and Plato
argued that only universals are, Aristotle disagreed, arguing that only
particulars (ultimate subjects) are. Though this debate remained
largely unresolved in the Islamic world, certain thinkers — such as
Ibn Sina and Suhrawardí — provided a resolution through the
merging of the two elements: the doctrine of the particularity of
essences (i.e. doctrine of the individual soul).

Parmenides and Plato: Being is Universal

Of the Greek thinkers, one of the earliest extant accounts of
being is that of Parmenides (d. 515 BC). The essential problematic
he dealt with was the following: amidst this world of things that are
constantly changing (e.g. birth, growth, death), on what ground can
one assert that anything is? In other words, how can identity (the
endurance of being) be predicated on something that is never the
same from moment to moment? Parmenides made a decisive
distinction: That which “becomes and perishes,” which “alters its
place” and “changes its shining,” is the “illusion (Greek: doxa) of
mortals, in which there is no true belief.”2 In contrast, the way of
truth (Greek: alethea) is the way of the totality-of-being (Greek:
estin) which is:

> not-generated, imperishable, whole, sole-of-its-kind . . . is
> now at once all one ...And never will the force of belief say
> that from being something became besides it . . . For if it
> became, it is not, nor is it if some time it will be. Thus
> generation is extinguished and destruction is not-to-be-
> heard. Nor is it divisible ...it rests in itself.3

His students, the Eleatics, radicalized this teaching in such a way as
to lay the ground for a reaction by Plato. While agreeing with
Parmenides that there is only doxa with respect to that-which-
changes, they further asserted that such things (are)4 non-beings.
Only eternals (the sun, the gods, etc) are.

At first, Plato’s (d. 347 BC) account of being, in Book VI of
Politea, seems to confirm the Eleatic orthodoxy of the non-being of
the particular. Inquiring into the essence of rightness (Greek: dikae),
he agrees that particular things — “the many” — are constantly
changing and (are) therefore not beings proper. However, he departs

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          103

from the Eleatics in his declaration of what is being. Though “the
many” are not beings, “according to one idéa of each as one being,
we proclaim ‘what is’ each.”5 Thus, being proper pertains to the
single, universal, and unchanging idéa (i.e. “looks,” “forms,” or, as
called in later philosophy, “archetypes”) that unify the many
particulars. For instance, though the particular trees in a given grove
are not beings, they are illusory copies of the one true tree — which
is an idéa.

Aristotle: Being is Particular

Aristotle (d. 322 BC) objects. He explains that “[b]eingness, as
said in the most decisive and first and foremost sense, is what
neither is said about anything underlying, nor is in anything
underlying.”6 Restated positively, being is said of ultimate subjects
and not of predicates.

This effectively turns Plato’s conception of being on its head.

Only particular things, “the many,” the “each,” are ultimate sub-
jects.7 Conversely, “that which prevails on the whole” (precisely the
universal idéa) are always predicated on particulars.8 Thus, being lies
in the particular thing, of which the idéa is a predicate or attribute.

Aristotle, however, does not discount the being of the idéa
entirely. He explains that the distinctive and essential attribute of
each particular being is its idéa. It is only through perceiving “the
prior” (the being’s idéa) that the “posterior” (the particular being)
can be truly understood. Without perception of the prior, “what is
perceptible and first to each is often only slightly perceptible, and
has hold of little or nothing of what is.” He employs an example:
because the point is the idéa of (is prior to) the line or surface, true
knowledge of a surface amounts to the understanding that it is a
collection of points.9

Islamic Thinkers: Bridge of Universal and Particular

At the heart of this difference between Plato and Aristotle is a dis-
agreement as to the most fundamental criteria of being: constancy
vs. uniqueness. The Greeks presented these two criteria as mutually
exclusive because they assumed that the idéa are universals (e.g. in a
grove of trees, all trees are copies of the one universal idéa of tree).

Though this debate was largely unresolved in the Islamic world,10

certain thinkers, including Ibn Sina (d. 1037) and Sohrevardi (d.
1191), advanced the doctrine of the particularity of the idéa. Ibn
Sina, in critiquing the Platonic doctrine of the idéa, explains that the
universals exist in particular embodiments.11 Sohrevardi, similarly,
suggests that the idéa are not single prototypes of a multitude of

104          Unity and Causality

particulars; they     may,    rather,    be   embodied      in   particular
representations.12

In other words, to each particular being corresponds a particular
idéa distinct from the idéa of others of the same species (e.g. in a
grove of trees, each tree has its own idéa; similarly, all men do not
share the same soul but each man has an individual soul). This
resolves Plato and Aristotle’s dispute by adopting both of their
criteria. Plato was correct to assert that what truly is about a being is
its idéa, which idéa yet fulfills Aristotle’s requirement of ultimate
subjectivity because it is not common to the entire species but,
rather, is unique to this particular member of the species.
The Unity of Being

On what ground, if any, can the multiplicity of beings in the
world be considered not merely as a sum but as a totality (i.e. one
being, a unity)? This question necessarily invokes the question of
causality, which, in turn, invokes the question of God.
Greek Doctrine of the Eternity of the World (Fusis)

Though later philosophy asserted that the multiplicity of beings
were together as one in the mind of a creative God, the ancient
Greeks did not conceptualize God as a creator. Rather, their notion
was that God, like the sun, causes the movement of all beings, but
does not thereby create anything. Parmenides explains that Estin (the
totality of being) is “not-generated [from without] [for] how and
whence would it have grown? Out of not-being ...it is neither sayable
nor thinkable.”13 Similarly, nowhere in Plato is a creative God
asserted,14 merely the Supreme idéa (Greek: tou-agathou-idean) Who
“holds-above far beyond” all other idéa and is their Unmoved
Mover.15 Nor does Aristotle assert the being of a creator-God; the
closest he comes to it is asserting that “all things are either ground or
from a ground.”16 The implication is that those beings that are
themselves grounds are not from a further ground, therefore being
groundless (uncreated).17

Rather, the Greeks accounted for the oneness of being through
the doctrine of the totality-of-being (Greek: fusis) whereby the
totality of being, though moved by God, generates itself eternally.
Though the sun provides the energy needed for nature to endure, it
does not on that account create nature — rather, nature perpetuates
itself. Parmenides explains that fusis is “w hole, sole-of-its-kind . . . is
now at once all one . . . Nor is it divisible . . . it rests in itself”
(emphasis added).18 Aristotle confirms, “nothing is without order in
fusis because fusis itself is to all t h ings a cause of order” (emphasis
added).19 Thus, fusis is the account of the plurality of beings as one
being (a totality).

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         105

However, Aristotle raised initial arguments against this account
of the unity of being. First, by extension of his argument with Plato
regarding the idéa are merely attributes,20 he objects to the being of
an alleged “Supreme idéa.” Further, he argues that it is impossible to
classify the totality of being under the master genus of “Being”
(fusis). Despite his convoluted explanation,21 the heart of his
argument is compelling: “Being” itself is indefinable because every
definition must always already pre-suppose being (every definition
takes the form of “X is Y”). Therefore, Being cannot be an ultimate
genus (i.e. classification, definition).

Having objected to the two central elements of the Greek
account of the unity of being (the Supreme Mover and fusis),
Aristotle asks: “Then in what sense are different things called good?”
He offers another account, suggesting, albeit tentatively, the
“analogy of being.” He explains: “[the good of beings] do not seem
to be a case of homonymony by chance . . . Perhaps it is by way of
analogy: that is, as sight is good in the body, so intelligence is good
in the soul, and similarly another thing in something else.”22

In the end, however, Aristotle retracts this argument. Having found
no basis for any such analogy, he explains, “this question must be
dismissed for the present.” With no other way to legitimize a pursuit
of the “Science of Being,” he simply assumes that there is a Supreme
Being, one that he at times describes as self-thinking Thought
(Greek: Nous Noesis), and at others as the Unmoved Mover that moves
all beings through the attractive power of love (Greek: eros).23
The Neoplatonist Doctrine of Creation

The concept of creation, distinct from that of fusis, asserts that
God (“the First”) is the creator of all beings. This concept of a
Creator-God was present in the Judaic tradition (Book of Genesis)
and continued in the early Christian tradition (Book of John). A
subsequent bastion of this thinking was Gnosticism, which was
decisive in disseminating the doctrine, particularly from the 1st
century BC to the 1st century AD.24

The influence of these three currents of thought (Judaic, Greek,
Gnostic) upon Platonism25 resulted in Neoplatonism, a syncretism of
ancient Greek and Judeo-Christian thinking.26 As Plotinus (d. 269)
and Proclus (d. 485) both explain, God, through His self-
contemplation, emanated (created) the First Reason, which in turn
emanated a sequence of further Reasons through a series of similar
acts of contemplation. Each of these Reasons has created a
particular celestial realm, the last of which created the entire world
of nature. Thus, it is important to note that God, as the First in the
series of causation, does not directly create the world of nature, nor

106          Unity and Causality

can it be deduced that He necessarily “intervenes” (or even knows
of) the happenings of particular beings in the contingent realm (i.e.
in time and history). The eternal is bifurcated from the historical.

Significantly, this account results in an ambiguity that speaks, at
least partially, to Aristotle’s objections. Beings are not unified under
the master genus of Being because, as Proclus explains, the First
(God) is not a being. Rather, the First (is) featureless and nameless,
exalted above categories of sensible and intelligible beings, and can
only be inferred from perusal of the first caused being (Reason).27

However, viewed from the perspective of the First Reason, the
totality of being is unified under the master category of Being
because the First Reason is itself a being (created). Proclus explains
that “[a]ll things are found in the First Reason, since the First Agent
has made this product to contain many Forms and each of these
Forms to contain all the particular objects corresponding to that
form.”28 Hence, all beings exist as a totality in God’s Intelligence,
and their creation lies precisely in their existence (the Greek-
appropriated Latin word “ex-sistere” means “to cause to stand
outside of”). The apparent diversity of creation is due merely to the
divinely-ordained differences of dispositions of creatures, resulting
in varying degrees of reception of the single, uniform outpouring.29

Islamic Thinkers
Fárábí

Fárábí (d. 950), a Sufi and “philosopher,” was one of the first
Islamic thinkers to expound an explicit theory of the unity of being.
Without doubt, one of the most important contributions he made to
the concept was his distinction between necessary and contingent30
being. Meditating upon the Qur’anic articulation of the utter
transcendence, unity, and independence of God, Fárábí explained
that, while God is a being who is “necessary-in-Himself,” all other
beings are “necessary-through-Another” (this can be loosely
understood as “contingent”). This distinction amounts to a
preservation of the unity of God by way of his exclusive right to an
entire ontological domain.

Further, adapting the Neo-Platonist scheme, Fárábí explains that
God, though an act of Self-contemplation, emanates the First
Intellect.31 Through contemplation of its Author, the First Intellect
emanates the Second Intellect, and through self-contemplation, it
emanates the outermost heaven. The process continues until ten
Intellects and the specific heavenly spheres are emanated, the last of
which creates the terrestrial world, in which Man stands at the apex.32

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven        107

However, in attempting to propose an authentically Islamic
doctrine, Fárábí makes a significant departure from the pre-Islamic
account of emanation. Specifically, he attributes to this Tenth
Intellect not only the capacities of creation, but also revelation.
Thus, he equates this Intellect with the Angel of Revelation, Gabriel.
al-Ghazálí’s Critique

Hamid al-Ghazálí (d. 1111) vehemently objected to certain
features of Neoplatonic thinking, particularly as articulated by
Fárábí (and by his successor, Ibn Sina).33 One of his chief criticisms
of the emanation scheme was that it denies God’s quality of
omniscience as postulated in the Qur’an. The concept of God as
“Self-Thinking Thought” suggests that God’s knowledge is limited
to Himself or, at most, to the First Intelligence, which is the only
being that directly emanates from Him. The scheme does not
suggest that God knows all of the beings that emanate further down
in the chain — including, for instance, particular terrestrial beings.
However, the Qur’an explains that nothing escapes God’s
knowledge, not even “the smallest particle in heaven or on earth.”34

Further, he argues that the Neo-Platonist assertion of separate
chains of independent causation is at odds with God’s absolute
power and prerogative to act freely. In other words, God is the only
being with will — He causes everything, directly. Though it may
appear that other beings have agency to effectuate effects, such
effects were in truth pre-ordained by God and only correlated with
the particular agents.

Simultaneously, Ghazálí objects to the ancient Greek and Neo-
Platonist assertions of the eternity of the world, which he views as
an arbitrary limitation on God’s power. He argues that, according to
the Qur’an, God created the creation out of absolute nothingness
(creation ex nihilo) — i.e., creation happened in time because at one
point there was nothing and only at a later point was there
something.35 Causation is temporal.
al-Ghazálí’s Proposal

While opposing the Neoplatonic account of the unity of being,
Ghazálí offered an alternative account, which proved to be
particularly influential in subsequent Islamic mystical and
philosophical thinking. For starters, he confirms the general
equation that Fárábí attempted — namely that God is a Revealer.
However, whereas Fárábí attributed this power of revelation to an
intelligence that was ten steps “removed” from God, Ghazálí’s
account is more radical: God, Himself, acts as a revealer. This
effectively replaced all of the emanated intelligences with a God
Who intervenes with, and sustains the unity of, His creation through

historical revelations. Along these lines, he explains that “the Qur’an
and other revealed scriptures are the expression of” the (Neo-
Platonic) intelligible world.36

Having dismissed the demonstrative complexity of Neo-Platonist
emanation with this single stroke, he offers, instead, an account of
the unity of being that simply asserts the relative nothingness of
creation. He employs the symbolic language of light and love. For
instance, in his commentary on the Qur’anic verse depicting God as
the light of heaven and earth,37 he explains that light applies to God
primarily and to all else only derivatively. He declares. “there is no
being in the world other than God . . . everything other than He . . . is
pure nonbeing ...and is perishing eternally and everlastingly.”38
Suhrawardí

Suhrawardí was deeply influenced by Ghazálí’s account. As a
youth, he entered the Sufi path and is known to have studied
Ghazálí’s Mishqat al-Anwar, which inspired him with important
elements of his light imagery. Thus, typical of Suhrawardí’s account
is a depiction of the essence of all beings as lights originating from
the love of the Light of Lights.39

However, despite his adherence to these elements of Ghazálí’s
account, Suhrawardí departed from it in other respects, such as his
“revival” of the Neoplatonist doctrine of emanation. Suhrawardí
elaborated upon this doctrine, delineating various levels of reality
that emanate from God. In particular, he proposes the following
order of emanation: God, the world of pure Intelligences (jabarut),
the world of pure lights (malakut), the world of the fixed
archetypes, and the material world (mulk).
Ibn `Arabí

Ibn Arabí’s conception of the unity of being is often recognized as
the most mature and subtle of accounts amongst the great Islamic
thinkers and mystics. While there is no question that he made impor-
tant new contributions to this concept, it should also be recognized
that he benefited from, and utilized, conceptual features elaborated upon
by his predecessors. As this section will explain, Ibn ‘Arabí’s account
employs the following concepts that preceded him: the distinction
between necessary and contingent being (Fárábí), emanation (Neo-
platonism, Fárábí, Suhrawardí), the realm of the fixed archetypes
(Suhrawardí). Further, Ibn ‘Arabí employs poetic imagery that can be
traced to Hallaj (e.g. the mirror metaphor) and Junayd al-Baghdadi
(e.g. the shadow metaphor, discussed by Junayd in connection with
an individual’s attainment of the last of the four stages of tawhid).

To begin with, Ibn `Arabí, in his Fusus al-Hikam, makes the
ontological premise that the essence of every being in creation is

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         109

that it is a name. He posits this based upon the observation that,
linguistically, the Arabic words for “world” (‘alim), “knowledge”
(‘elm), and “sign” (‘alama) all derive from the same root (‘a-l-m).
Furthermore, the Qur’án’s Surah of the Fath pluralizes “world” in
the grammatical form of a sentient being (‘alemin). These
observations lead him to conclude that all beings are, essentially,
both means to the knowledge of God (i.e. names) and are actively
engaged in pursuing the knowledge of God (i.e. sentient).

Upon this foundation, Ibn ‘Arabí proposes a scheme of creation
by way of emanation (despite the efforts of al-Ghazálí, Ibn `Arabí
succeeds in fixing the emanation scheme in subsequent mystical
accounts of being). He explains that, in primordial, pre-eternity,
God existed alone — represented by the first part of the Hadith, “I
was a Hidden Treasure.” Here, God is most properly called al-Haqq,
which, as a concept, does not allow for Lordship, because He did not
yet create any subject-worshippers.

Next emanated the Fayd al-Aqdas (Most Holy Outpouring),
which represents the existence, in His knowledge, of the archetypes
of all things. These archetypes (a’yan) correspond to the totality of
all the names and are eternal precisely because they do not exist in
the visible realm of death and decay. This Outpouring can be
understood as corresponding to the second sentence of the same
Hadith, “I desired to be known.” Elsewhere, he equates this First
Emanation with the Reality of Mu˙ammad (al-Haqiqa al-
Mu˙ammadiya), which both created the creation and communicates
God’s will to the world historically. He explains that this Reality
refers not to the historic person of Mu˙ammad, but rather the
eternal spirit that animated all the prophets from Adam through
Mu˙ammad, of which Mu˙ammad was the fullest.40

The third stage is the Fayd al-Muqaddas (the Holy Outpouring),
which is the emanation of all created things in the visible realm, each
of which corresponding to a single archetype. This is represented by
the last sentence of the Hadith, “Therefore I created the creation in
order to be known.” God, in this respect, is most properly designated
as “Alláh,” because of his Lordship over these particular subjects.

This scheme of creation has important implications. Firstly, the
purpose of creation is not for God to reveal Himself to man, but for
God to reveal Himself to Himself. Second, the creation is the
perfect receptacle for the emanation of these names and attributes
(as Ibn ‘Arabí explains, it has the perfect isti’dad — the command
“Kon” is perfectly in harmony with the response of “Yakun”). To say
the same, the entire creation can be likened to a mirror, reflecting
the light of the sun. Third, man has a very special status amongst the
creation, because, as Ibn ‘Arabí explains in his first chapter of the

Fusus al Hikam, to Adam was taught the names and attributes of all
things, earning him the designation of “al-Insan al-Kamil.”
Therefore, man, amongst the entire creation, can be the fullest
reflection of God and the fullest means of God revealing Himself to
Himself. For this reason, the entire cosmos is referred to as the
“Insan al-Kabir” — i.e. a macrocosm of man.

From these considerations, the implications regarding the Unity
of Being become quite plain and clear. Given the scheme above, God
is the only necessary being (wajib al-wujud); all else is contingent
being (mumkin al-wujud). Thus, with respect to God, all other
beings are not; but with respect to themselves, they are, inasmuch as
they are reflections or shadows of God. It is clear, therefore, that
Ibn ‘Arabí’s account of the Unity of Being does not imply that man
can achieve union (ittisal) with God, nor that created beings are non-
beings in an absolute sense. While the multiple beings of creation
are, their mode of being is that of a shadow or reflection of God —
the sole being and the ultimate ground of the unity of being.41
Ibn Rushd

In opposition to the “mystical shift” in the thinking of the
Muslim world, exemplified in the thinking of figures such as al-
Ghazálí and Ibn `Arabí, Ibn Rushd attempted a rejuvenation of
philosophy in general, and of an account of the unity of being, in
particular, through a comprehensive refutation of both the
Neoplatonists (i.e. Fárábí and Ibn Sina) and al-Ghazálí. While
acknowledging that the Neoplatonist emanation scheme is
reconcilable with Plato, he argues that it distorts the teachings of
Aristotle. Such a scheme analogizes God’s agency to contingent
agency, suggesting that God can create only one effect. This,
however, places a false limitation on Divine power, which, in
principle, is capable of creating everything directly.42

His refutation of al-Ghazálí (in the sarcastically entitled Tahafut-
al-Tahafut), undertakes a systematic rebuttal of the assertions in al-
Ghazálí’s Tahafut. For instance, regarding Ghazálí’s gripe with the
Neoplatonists over the question of God’s knowledge, Ibn Rushd
claims that the entire debate is moot; both parties are guilty of
ascribing human modes of attributes and knowledge to God. In
truth, God’s attributes and knowledge are utterly transcendent and
categorically unknowable, inasmuch as “the First Being knows the
nature of particular beings through that Being per se, Who is
Himself.”43

Similarly, he argues against al-Ghazálí’s (and the Ash’arites’)
purported refutation of the will of created beings, explaining that
such a proposition is self-defeating because it nullifies the concept

of action altogether. Further, repudiating causality is tantamount to
repudiating knowledge, because knowledge is the act of eliciting the
causes underlying a given process. This, further, amounts to a
rejection of the notion of a wise Creator Who creates knowable
patterns in the creation by which He can be known.44

Ibn Rushd also rebuts al-Ghazálí’s criticism of the thesis of the
eternity of the creation, arguing that the Qur’an does not postulate
that God’s creation of the universe was temporal (i.e. it doesn’t say
that God existed together with non-being, and subsequently the
world came into being after it was not). In effect, Ibn Rushd rejects
the standard Christian and Muslim view of creation ex nihilo,
adopting, instead, Aristotle’s account — “the least doubtful and most
congruent with the nature of being”45 — which account asserts the
eternity of the world with respect to its potentiality. Though God
did create all beings, as the Qur’an postulates, this creation
amounted to God’s giving form to eternally pre-existing matter.

Though Ibn Rushd’s thesis of rationalism and Aristotelianism had
little influence in the post-Ghazálí Islamic world, it had a
considerable following in Europe. In the thirteenth century, his
works were translated into Hebrew and Latin, becoming, thereby, a
substantial part of Europe’s Aristotelian heritage. His Western
devotees included: Maimonedes, Siger de Brabant, Moses ben
Tibbon, Hermann the German, the “Averroesites” in the University
of Paris, Levi ben Gerson, Albert the Great, and, most notably, Saint
Thomas Aquinas.46

The effects of this Aristotelianism significantly modified the
concept of causality. In short, thirteenth century Christian
theologians recast the teaching of creation according to Aristotle’s
description of God as Nous Noesis (self-thinking Thought), resulting
in the doctrine that creation proceeds specifically from God’s
thinking (Latin: ratio, reason). The consequence: all beings are
thoughts of God. To say the same: all beings have a ratio (reason); all
beings are essentially intelligible.47 The intelligibility of beings, in
turn, legitimizes science and technique as the means of uncovering
those beings. Several centuries later, Leibnitz (d. 1716) articulates
the fullest expression of this doctrine as the Principle of Sufficient
Reason: “nihil est sine ratione” — nothing is without a ground, or,
stated positively: all that is is grounded in reason (everything has a
ground).48 Here, the departure from Aristotle49 is quite evident: even
those beings that are grounds must, themselves, be grounded. The
impossibility of an infinite regress of causes requires the being of an
ultimate, self-grounding ground (God).

Initial Reflections on the Bahá’í Sy nthesis
Inheritance and Systematization of Previous Concepts

It is clear, upon an even cursory review of the Bahá’í writings,
that numerous elements of the aforementioned intellectual heritage
have been incorporated into the Bahá’í concept of the unity of
being. As a starting point, it should be noted that the Bahá’í account
preserves the Ancient Greek insight regarding the eternity of the
universe, enshrined in the Greek concept of Fusis:

> If we could imagine a time when no beings existed, this
> imagination would be the denial of the Divinity of God. . .
> If the beings were absolutely nonexistent, existence would
> not have come into being. Therefore, as the Essence of
> Unity (that is, the existence of God) is everlasting and
> eternal — that is to say, it has neither beginning nor end —
> it is certain that this world of existence, this endless
> universe, has neither beginning nor end. (SAQ part IV)
Simultaneously, Bahá’í writings preserve the seemingly opposite,
theological concept of creation ex nihilo, espoused by the likes of al
Ghazálí:

This apparent contradiction — simultaneous acceptance of the
eternity of the universe, on the one hand, and God's creation of the
universe from nothingness, on the other, is addressed by Bahá'u’lláh
explicitly in the Tablet of Wisdom: “Wert thou to assert that [the
universe] hath ever existed and shall continue to exist, it would be
true; or wert thou to affirm the same concept as is mentioned in the
sacred Scriptures, no doubt would there be about it.” (TB 140)

Secondly, the Bahá’í conception adopts the concept of creation
by way of emanation, which concept was first encountered in the
Neoplatonist scheme and, despite the efforts of al-Ghazálí, persisted
amongst numerous of the great Muslim thinkers. More particularly,
the Bahá’í conception generally confirms the point made by Fárábí,
that the source of creation is also the source of revelation. However,
whereas both the Neoplatonist and Muslim emanationists espoused a
scheme of creation by way of a lengthy and somewhat mechanical
ordering of emanated Intelligences, the Bahá’í writings, perhaps

lending some credence to the spirit of al-Ghazálí's critique, seem to
avoid excessive nitpicking regarding the details of this scheme.
Numerous expositions of this scheme have, nevertheless, been
presented in the Bahá’í writings, perhaps the most prominent of
which focus on the concept of the Primal Will as the first emanation
from God and the direct agent involved in creation.

Thirdly, the Bahá’í writings adopt several of the essential features of
Ibn ‘Arabí's particular account of the unity of being, including the
notion that all beings are essentially names and attributes and that
Man represents the consummation of these names and attributes.

> Upon the inmost reality of each and every created thing He
> hath shed the light of one of His names, and made it a
> recipient of the glory of one of His attributes. Upon the
> reality of man, however, He hath focused the radiance of
> all of His names and attributes, and made it a mirror of His
> own Self. Alone of all created things man hath been
> singled out for so great a favor, so enduring a bounty.

(GWB 64)
‘Arabí’s claim that all beings are simultaneously means of, and engaged
in, the knowledge of God, seems to be echoed in the Bahá’í Writings:

> [A]ll t hings, in their inmost reality, testify to the
> revelation of the names and attributes of God within them.
> Each according to its capacity, indica teth , and is
> ex pr essiv e of, the knowledge of God. So potent and
> universal is this revelation, that it hath encompassed all
> things visible and invisible. (GWB 177, emphasis added)
Distinct Features of the Bahá’í Account

While confirming numerous features of Ibn 'Arabí's account,
one of the important points distinguishing the Bahá’í account seems
to be its explicit assertion that these names and attributes are not,
strictly speaking, of God, but, rather, are of the Manifestations of God.

> Man, the noblest and most perfect of all created things,
> excelleth them all in the intensity of this revelation, and is
> a fuller expression of its glory. And of all men, the most
> accomplished, the most distinguished, and the most
> excellent are the Manifestations of the Sun of Truth. Nay,
> all else besides t hese Man if esta tio ns, liv e by th e
> operat ion of Th eir Will, an d mo ve an d ha v e th eir
> being thro ugh th e ou t pour ings of T h eir grace.

(GWB 177, emphasis added)
Similarly,

> [b]y th e revelat ion of t hese Gems of Div ine
> virt ue [the Manifestations] all the names and attributes
> of God, such as knowledge and power, sovereignty and
> dominion, mercy and wisdom, glory, bounty, and grace, are
> made manifest. (GWB 46, emphasis added)
The justification for declaring that the Manifestation of God,
rather than God, is the ground of the unity of being seems to derive
from the prior conception of God's utter transcendence:

> He is, and hath ever been, veiled in the ancient eternity of
> His Essence, and will remain in His Reality everlastingly
> hidden from the sight of men. . . The door of the
> knowledge of the Ancient of Days being thus closed in the
> face of all beings, the Source of infinite grace. (GWB 46)
Indeed, precisely because of God's transcendence and consequent
inaccessibility to Man, God

> hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear
> out of the realm of the spirit, in the noble form of the
> human temple, and be made manifest unto all men, that
> they may impart unto the world the mysteries of the
> unchangeable Being, and tell of the subtleties of His
> imperishable Essence. (GWB 46)
Even more succinctly, “[t]he Unseen can in no wise incarnate His
Essence and reveal it unto men. He Who is everlastingly hidden
from the eyes of men ca n nev er be kno wn exc ept throug h
His Man if esta tion ” (GWB XX, emphasis added).

However, the radical import of grounding the unity of being in
the Manifestation (rather than in God per se) cannot be appreciated
without reference to the particular teleological view of history
espoused in the Bahá’í writings. The Bahá’í writings, of course,
assert that history consists of universal cycles that are unimaginably
long in duration, consisting of “innumerable and incalculable periods
and epochs,” at the end of each of which “not a trace or record of it
will remain.” (SAQ 160-2) Each universal cycle, in turn, consists of
two phases: an age of prophecy and an age of fulfillment, the
former of which is characterized by “Prophets” or “Manifestations
of God,” and the latter of which is characterized by a single, “great
and supreme Manifestation” who “makes the world the center of
His radiance” and whose “appearance causes the world to attain to
maturity.” (SAQ 160-2) Though other Manifestations arise during an
age of fulfillment, their role is derivative: they “renew certain
commandments relating to material questions and affairs, while
remaining under His shadow.” (SAQ 160-2)

Further, the Bahá’í writings are unequivocal in asserting that this
most radical of all possible historical events — the appearance of the
Supreme Manifestation and therefore the essential consummation of
history — has now taken place:

> O ye that inhabit the heavens and the earth! There hath
> appeared what hath never previously appeared. He Who,
> from everlasting, had concealed His Face from the sight of
> creation is now come. (GWB XIV)
Further,

> It is evident that every age in which a Manifestation of
> God hath lived is divinely ordained, and may, in a sense, be
> characterized as God's appointed Day. This Day, however,
> is unique, and is to be distinguished from those that have
> preceded it. The designation 'Seal of the Prophets' fully
> revealeth its high station. The Prophetic Cycle hath, verily,
> ended. The Eternal Truth is now come. He hath lifted up
> the Ensign of Power, and is now shedding upon the world
> the unclouded splendor of His Revelation. (GWB XXV)
And, as `Abdul-Bahá has stated so simply: “We are in the cycle
which began with Adam, and its supreme Manifestation is
Bahá'u'lláh.” (SAQ 160-2)

Though far beyond the scope of this paper, there can be no
doubt that, given this conception of history, the Bahá’í concept of
the unity of being is laden with implications unprecedented in the
Greek, Neoplatonic, or Islamic intellectual forbears. The
understanding of these implications are therefore now part of the
current and future labors of thought for Bahá’í thinkers. Given the
Bahá’í grounding of the concept of unity of being in the
Manifestation of God rather than in God per se, and given the
assertion of the appearance of the Supreme Manifestation, then the
general concept of the essence of all beings as names, attributes, and
referents to the “Manifestations” must now be re-thought
specifically and pointedly with reference to the “Supreme
Manifestation.” The very notion of unity, previously a possibility
that existed within the confounds of the relation between a historic
nation and its particular Prophet, must now be re-thought in light of
a Supreme Manifestation who has appeared to fulfill mankind at
large and all of the kingdoms of creation in general. Similarly, the
concept of a Manifestation as emanation, emanator, and creator
must be re-thought in light of Bahá'u’lláh's proclamation that
“through a word spoken by [God] in this Revelation, all created
things were made to expire, and through yet another word, all such
as [God] didst wish were, by [His] grace and bounty, endued with

new life,” (PM 42) and that “We have caused every soul to expire . . .
[w]e have, then, called into being a new creation.” (GWB XIV)
Conclusion

This paper has attempted to account for certain aspects of the
intellectual history underpinning the Bahá’í account of the unity of
being while pointing, however initially, to some of the ways in which
the Bahá’í account seems to depart, perhaps radically, from all prior
conceptions. In doing so, the present author has hoped to shed light
on the richness and diversity of elements contributing to the Bahá’í
conception, while showing that the Bahá’í account is in no way a
mere sum of these prior conceptions.

It has been argued, in brief, that the Bahá’í account confirms
both the Ancient Greek notion of the eternity of the universe and
the theological account of creation ex nihilo; that it upholds but
simplifies the Neoplatonic conception of creation via emanation;
that it confirms the general Islamic identification of the source of
creation with the source of revelation; and that it employs many of
the central features of Ibn `Arabí's account of the unity of being by
way of the universal reflection of divine names and attributes.

Perhaps more importantly, this paper has argued that the Bahá’í
conception seems to rest upon a ground that is unprecedented in all
prior accounts: the conception of the Manifestation of God in every
age as both the cause of beings and the object of their reflection,
and the radical assertion that we, in our current age and in very
recent times, have witnessed the historic happening of the most
weighty of all possible events: the appearance on the terrestrial plane
of the Supreme Manifestation. As the Ground of Grounds and the
Causes of Causes, the Supreme Manifestation has, with a single
stroke, destroyed the creation of old, and along with it all prior
limitations and possibilities, and has raised up a new creation
endowed with unprecedented and hitherto unimagined possibilities
for the reflection, by the totality of being, of the divine attributes
and names.
