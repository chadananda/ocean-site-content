“Point” and “Letter” in the Writings of the Báb

by Muhammad Afnan

he use of the terms “Point” and “Letter” in the Writings of the Báb traces its origin to a hadíth

T      attributed to Imám ‘Alí, in which he says, “All that is in the Torah, the Evangel and the Psalms is

in the Qur’án; and all that is in the Qur’án is in the opening súrih; and all that is in the opening
súrih is in [the phrase] Bismi’lláh [Bismi’llahir-Rahm an ir-Rahim]; and all that is in Bismi’lláh is in [the
letter] Bá’; and all that is in Bá’ is in its point” (provisional translation).

The Báb uses this hadíth, which is often quoted in the Sacred Writings of the Faith, to elucidate two
novel themes. The first is that the Point of Truth is the source of all existence in both the spiritual and
the material world. In other words, in the material or physical world, all lines and letters begin from a
single dot or point. All shapes and patterns in existence are formed through variations of lines, which
in turn begin with the point. Sim il arly, human speech, which is what distinguishes humankind from
other creatures, is based on words and letters, which also have their origin in a single point. So, too, in
the spiritual world, the source of all existence is compared to a Point and all the spiritual truths that are
latent within the human reality emanate from that single and unconstrained Point.

The second theme explained by the Báb is the spiritual meaning and significance of letters. Letters—
and of course, word s— which are derived from and subord in ate to the point, can be said to have moved
from the station of abstraction peculiar to the point to the station of contingence and variation that
belongs to creation. Each has its own form and characteristics, distinct from others. Since each letter is
in itself independent and possesses distinctive features, which, in combination with other letters, form
words with special and distinct mean in gs, it can be said that each letter has its own spirit and character.
Letters are thus sim il ar in a sense to human beings, who have individual souls and possess distinctive
powers of understand in g.

Perhaps on this basis, human ind iv iduals are called “Letters” in the Bayán. For instance, believers and
deniers are distinguished from one another as “Sublime Letters” and “Other than Sublime Letters.”1 The
Bayán seems to indicate that this distinction will continue until the appearance of Him Whom God shall
make manifest, but there is no mention of what will take place after that. Probably for this reason the
Báb revealed nineteen Tablets addressed to Himself and the eighteen Letters of the Living and adorned
them with the addition of another Tablet addressed to Him Whom God shall make manifest. It seems
that in this way, the Báb has envisioned the return of the Letters of the Living at the time of the reve-
lation of Him Whom God shall make manifest and indicated Himself and these Letters as the first to
believe in the Promised One of the Bayán when He appears.

Facsimiles of these Tablets are published at the beginning of The Dawn-Breakers at the direction of
Shoghi Effendi. However, it must be noted that the nineteenth Tablet, designated “Majma‘u’l-Hayákil”
(Union of Temples (?) is addressed to the Báb Himself, and not to the nineteenth Letter of the Liv in g,
since there are only eighteen Letters of the Liv in g. However, it is correct to consider it to be addressed
to the nineteenth Letter of the first Váhid (in the abjad system, “váhid” is equivalent to the number 19).
This is a point that should be mentioned in future editions of The Dawn-Breakers.

Based on the hadíth quoted in the beginn in g, all spiritual truths are contained within the phrase
“Bismi’lláhir-Rahm án ir-Rahím” and within the letter “Bá’” and within the point of the letter. In Arabic,
there are nineteen letters in the aforementioned phrase and the word “Váhid” is also equivalent to the

number 19 in the abjad system. Considering the importance of the number 19 in the Qur’án,2 the Báb
has created an order that may be compared to a pyramid, at whose pinnacle is the Point of the Bayán,
below him the eighteen Letters of the Liv in g, and below each Letter another eighteen Letters, and so on
ad infinitum.3 The extension of this pattern to the second power, i.e., 19 times 19 which equals 361, is
specified in the Bayán and designated as “Kull-i-Shay’” (All Things), which is the numerical equivalent of
361\. However, the Báb explains that Kull-i-Shay’ is in fact infinite, and that it includes an infinite num-
ber of váhids.4

In conclusion, it should be mentioned that although the Báb’s system—because it deals with letters and
words—may be confused with the beliefs of the “Hurúf í” and Nuqtaví” sects, this is by no means the
case. These sects attributed magical qualities and powers to the letters of the alphabet and associated let-
ters to supernatural worlds, which they believed influenced the human world. It is evident from all the
Writings of the Báb, however, that his description of points and letters bears no allusion to such occult
sciences. The principles of the system created by the Báb are simply reflections of an order inherent and
manifest in all degrees and conditions of the world of existence, and they suggest that the foundations
and governing laws of creation are one, whether in the abstract world of points, lines and letters, or in
the highest stations of the realms of the spirit.

Notes

> 1) Persian Bayán, II. 4.
2) Islamic scholars have discovered, using computers, that the composition of the Qur’án is based on the number 19 and

> consider this as one of the miracles of the Qur’án. The fact that there are nineteen letters in the phrase “Bismi’lláhir-
> Rahmánir-Rahím” also confirms the authenticity of the above-mentioned hadíth.

> 3) Persian Bayán, VII. 8.
