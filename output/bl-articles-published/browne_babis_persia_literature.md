Akt.      XII.?The                B?bis          of Persia.               II.     Their       Literature          and

Doctrines.              By      Edward                   Granville               Browne,         M.A.,
M.R.A.S.

On       a former

occasion   I described    some of my experiences
amongst   tlio Meet of tlio B?b?s in 1'ersia, and gave a short
sketch of the history of their appearance      and development.
In the present paper I propose        to speak of their literature
and       doctrine,        so     far   as      these        are    known         to me.

First of all, however,    it seems desirable    to say something
of the relations       and antecedents     of the B?b? movement.
Now     these are of two kinds, which         I may call formal    and
essential.   By    the  formal   relations of   the sect, I mean    the
schools of thought wherein M?rz?     'AH Muhammad                                                       the B?b
received his training, and from which he presumably       acquired

the germs of the doctrine which he subsequently       elaborated.

By the essential relations, I mean     those religious   or philo

sophical movements    with which B?b?ism has most similarity,

no external connection   can be shown to exist between
> though
> it and them.      In the discussion   which   followed my      last
paper, Mr. Kay     indicated   some very interesting   points of
resemblance between     the B?bis and the Isma'ilis, not only iu
doctrine and organization,   but even in the use of particular
terms.          Similar           resemblances,                  more       or     less

striking,     present
themselves             in other              cases,       e.g. the Druses,                the Nuseyris,           and
certain        sects      amongst              the      Sufis.          Into      these     latter,    however,
it is not my    intention    to enter at present,      inasmuch as I
do not feel that I possess      sufficient   knowledge     of them to
warrant my doing so ; and I think that I shall do better to
confine myself   entirely   to the doctrines     of the B?b and his
teachers and disciples,   leaving    to others  the  task of compar
ing and contrasting                      these with                 other        analogous        movements.

882                           THE BABIS OF PERSIA.

But     before                on to consider    what    I havo described    as

passing
the formal        relations    of the- sect, I desire   briefly to revert   to
what was          said

by          the above-mentionedspeaker concerning
the grades of initiation which exist amongst the Isma'iHs.

I have occasionally      fancied that something      of a similar
nature,  though    less definite, may   exist   amongst   the B?b?s.
That they adapt their conversation       to those with whom      they
are speaking   there is no doubt. With        a Muharnmadan      they
willspeak of the coming              of the promised   Imam Mahdi,   and

emphasize  the doctrine              that the production   of verses liko
those of the Iittr'?m          is the essential     and proof of tho

sign
With   a Christian
prophetic        mission.                       they will speak of tho
expected      coming   of   Christ   and the  signs thereof, pointing
out that     if the Christians    blame the Jews for not recognizing
Christ   as the promised Messiah,          and failing to understand

that tho prophecies       concerning     the   kingdom      of the latter
were   intended    allegorical   ly and     in a   spiritual   sense, they
are equally    to blame      if they insist on a literal fulfilment
of the signs of Christ's       coming,     and refuse to see that He
has returned.     So also, in speaking with a Zoroastrian              or a
Suli, they  will  use   arguments     likely   to  commend      themselves
to their    interlocutor.

This,     however,  is not so very remarkable,         since the same
method      is common    in greater    or  less degree to most prose

portion of the human soul with the Divine Essence.      Hence
tho doctrine    of the divinity  of Bch? to them presents no
difficulty at all, for they have their Mansurs, their Juneyds,
and their B?yaz?ds,  each           of whom

claimed to be divine.
To these the prophet     is merely     the murshid, or spiritual

on a                ; and in either case the ultimate
guide,        larger scale
outcome of his teaching     is to enable the ma rid, or disciple,
to realize the same truth    which he has attained        to. B?b?s
of this class ought perhaps     to be regarded merely        as Sufis
attracted by the prestige    and influence of B?b      or Boh?, but
really retaining   their original    beliefs   almost or quite un
modified,  and, as it were, reading      these into the doctrine    to
which   they have attached  themselves,    rather than deriving
them from it. It was only at Kirm?n       that I met with B?b?s
of this type, and when I repeated    their views to some of the
influential     and learned

B?b?s of Yczd,    they unhesitatingly
and  strongly             them ; and the following

condemned                        passage
from the Lawh-i-Aledas  (of which I spoke in my last paper
as the most concise and authoritative  r?sum? of the B?b?
doctrine    of the present day) is clearly intended to discourage
all   such mystical      speculation,     and render       impossible   that

From         this digression       I now return   to a consideration          of
the    school      of thought        in which     the B?h   was reared, pre

viously to his declaration        of his divine mission.

some years continued          to lecture at Kerbela          to all who, either

or the departed Sheykh,              or from
by reason of faith in him

the B?b, and H?j? Muhammad          Karim Khan    of Kirm?n,
whose    followers still exist in considerable numbers  under
the name of Sheykh is. They are thus called after Sheykh
Ahmad     Ahs?'?,     from whose    teaching     their doctrines,   like

those of the B?b?s, were derived.        The majority     of the early
Sheykllis    accepted   the B?b, and forthwith       became known as
B?b?s,   while   only  6uch of them   as refused   to admit his claim,

examined       in order to arrive at a satisfactory knowledge             of its
development.         This I shall classify chronologically,            both to
facilitate     reference,    and   also     to aid    in              about    a

which I have had access              I have described        as fully as the
space at my disposal would admit of.                                 In other          cases  I have
been obliged  to content myself with                                mentioning            the names
of   works      not     accessible       to   tue   at   present.
Before     proceeding            further, it is necessary                to notice       several

descriptions        of B?b? MSS.,      of                the      existence    of
published
which        I was     unaware        when      I wrote       my      first   paper.

In the Bulletin  de l1Acad?mie     Imp?riale des Sciences de St.*
P?tcrsboury    for 1801-05   (vol. viii. p. 217 et seq.), there is a
notice by Dorn of a M?. of one of tho Bab's works, wherein

several pages of the original    text are given.     This work,

doubt, since it proceeds directly        from the secretary                                of the
B?b himself, who asserted that he had written         it down                               at the
dictation       of his master.               He had       it conveyed  into European
hands        from his prison               at Tabriz.       The responsibility  for its
contents        rests,        therefore,    on   the    above-mentioned             secretary."
Baron         llosen         has
published        volumes     two

entitled Collec
tions Scientifiques de VInstitut des Langues      Orienta/es    (de St.

Pctersbourg),      of which   the  first (Les Manuscrits     Arabes   de
rInstitut,   etc.) appeared in 1877, and the second (Les Manu
scrits Persans,    etc.) in 1880.   In the first of these volumes
33 pages are

occupied with an admirable        description   and

analysis,  with   copious  extracts from the  original,   of  two B?b?
MSS.     The first of these appears to be the Bab's Commentary
on the S?ra-i-Y?suf    (zee below, pp. 904-909)  ; the second con

altogether  different   from Bella's   "Letters to the Kings,"    which
I shall describe later (see below, pp. 954-958).           The second
volume of Baron ltosen's work contains also a description               of
two B?b? MSS.         occupying     50  pages.   Of    these,  the   first
appears to be the Persian Bey?n         written  by the Bab him

self ; while the second is the I'k?n composed by Beh?.         Of
both these books I possess copies, and others exist in the
British Museum,      and I have satisfied myself   by careful com

THE BAB1S OF FERSIA.                                          887

This  notice supplies a very great                       want, the Ezeli writings
being rare and difficult    to obtain,                   and I shall notice it more

fully in  its proper place (see below,                   p. 940 et seq.).

To proceed with the classification                   of the literature bearing on
the B?b? doctrines,I             shall divide       it into four periods, as follows:

I. The writings       of the teacher of the B?b,      IIaj? Seyyid
K?zim     of Refillt, and of his teacher, Sheykh Ahmad Ahs?'?.
These I shall henceforth      denominate   as Pre^Bdbt    writings.

II. The writings     of M?rz? 'Ali Muhammad        the B?b him

other B?b? writings,    especially  the poems                        of the unfortunate
and talented Kurratu!I-'Ayn.
III. The writings    of what I may call                               the Interval," i.e.

from the death of the B?b until                        the exile        of the B?b?s from
Baghdad     to Constantinople     and Adrianople,     at the former of
which places they only remained four months               according    to
Nabil,             at the  latter in the month    of Rajab,   A.n.  1281

arriving
(December,      1804).     This period   therefore embraces   about
fourteen years and a half, during        the whole of which M?rz?

(Ilazrat-i-Ezel)    was the nominal head of the sect, and
Yahy?1
vicegerent     of   the  B?b,   although  even then Beh?     (M?rz?

'AH, M?zandar?n?),    who, according       to the accounts
lluseyn
which    I received  from   the B?b?s,  was   M?rz?    Yahy?'s   half
brother,   and older than him by       some    years, actually    took
the most prominent      part in the organization     of affairs.

IV.    The     fourth period          begins with        the claim       of Beh?        to be

According     to Gobineau    (loe. cit. p. 277) Mirz? Yahya was the son of Mirzi

ni- Verdi M?rz?i, governor        or Teheran,     and lost his

mother at his birth.        He was then adopted by the wife of Beha.                  This would
make him the adopted son instead of the half-brother             of Bella.      The following     is

He whom God shall manifest,"      and his consequent                         demand
that all the B?b?s, including M?rz? Yahy?,   hitherto                        nominal
head of the sect, should yield him allegiance.  The date of this

Dissension   waxed fierce amongst    the two parties, and finally
several on either side were killed.    The Turkish government
decided to separate them, and M?rz? Yahy?      and his adherents
were   sent to Cyprus, while Beh? and his followers were removed

to Acre, where they arrived on the 12th of Jem?di'ul-Avval,
a.m. 1285 (August 29th, 1868).        This period extends down

to the present day.    The literature of tho sect now becomes
divided    into that of Beh?     and his followers,   and that of
M?rz? Yahy?      and his partizans.    I regret to say that of the

latter I do not possess any examples,      and in discussing  it I
shall have    to rely entirely on M. Ilmirt's notice.

I shall now proceed to examine     each of these four periods
in greater detail.

First       Period.     Doctrines                 of Sheykh       Ahmad Ahs?'?          and

> his   successor   IIAj?                Skyyid    K?zim     of Resht,          the
> teacher           of    the    B?b.

The materials                for an investigation        of the above are copious,
since both Sheykh Ahmad and H aj? Seyyid K?zim were
prolific writers, and their works, which are greatly esteemed
by the Sheykhis of the present day, abound.

The chief of those composed by the former are as follows :
Sharh-i-Fav?'id,      both   text and commentary           by the samo
author,   and both       in Arabic    ; Sharh-i-Ziy?rat-i-J?mi'a       (4

a commentary      on the
vols.) ; Sharli-i-'Arshiyya,                                 'Arshiyya of
Mulla    Sadr?; Ajwibatu'l-Mas?'il        ; Sharh-i-Mash?Ur-i-Mulla
Stidr?;        Shai      h-i-2    ab $ ira-i-'Aflama      ; Jawam?nl-Kalam,      etc.

IIaj? Seyyid                  K?zim     of Resht   composed,     amongst    other
works,   a commentary                     on the Khufb?-i-Tutunjiyij?,      and tho
Sharli       i-Kasida.

Toform a proper estimate of the influence of these writers
and their doctrines on the B?b, and of the extent to which

Shi'ite divines of recent times, and the second                                          article, which

treats of the life and works of H?j? Mulla Muhammad                Tak?

at considerable    length,   deals  incidentally    with   the doctrines
of both tho Sheykhis       and the B?b?s.        l??j? Mulla Muham
mad Tak? of Kazvin          was, as mentioned        by Gobineau,      the
uncle and father-in-law      of Kurratu'l-'Ayn,       the B?b? heroine.
He         had

always     disliked    Sheylih    Ahmad     Ahs?'?    and his
followers,    denouncing       them    as  heretics ;  he  had   held   dis

putations    at  Kazvin      with    the            himself    concerning

Sheykh
the doctrine    of the resurrection        of the hody, and finally so

prejudiced     the inhabitants     of that town against him that he
was compelled      to depart thence.        When     the Bab's doctrines
began   to spread   themselves     through Persia,   Mulla   Muhammad
Takrs hatred was increased, and reached its climax when his
niece            and

daughter-in-law   Kurratu'l-'Ayn,         then  called
Zarria T?j, not only embraced      these doctrines,    and put her
self in communication      with tho B?b, but began openly          to
preach  them,   to  the   great scandal    of all   pious  Muham
madans.    H?j?   Mulla  Muhammad        Tak? publicly     cursed
Sheykh  Ahmad    Ahs?'?.  For  this  act  he paid   with  his   life,
for he was stabbed in the mosque    at Kazvin    by Mirz?     S?lih
of Sh?raz, and two or three other B?b?s.1     It was alleged by
the       enemies           of                             that    she    was        a                to    this

such,       we      may          be    sure   that    6he would      have

scarcely         escaped
the vengeance     of the Muhammadans.        As it was, she quitted
Kazvin     and proceeded    to M?zandar?n,     where she met Mulla
Huseyn     of Bushraweyh,     and  H?j?  Mulla   Muhammad      'Ali of
B?lfur?sh,    with  whom   she  remained   until a  short time before

suffered death in August,    1852.
It is on account of this fatal

enmity, which H?j? Mulla

that his              treats at some length of the doctrines of

heretical    and objectionable.

From     his statements,       it appears that Sheykh Ahmad            tried
to combine                  with                   and   to reconcile

theology            philosophy,                         dogma
with reason.        The result of this attempt,            according    to our
author,    was    to            neither                   nor

satisfy               theologians          philosophers,
the former disliking         him as unsound, the latter despising him

To develope      this doctrine,    he used    to apply cabbalistic

pronounced          unorthodox       by tho majority of the 'Ularn?, and

accused    of    holding     the  doctrines   of Mulla Sadr?, the greatest
Persian     philosopher         of  modern      times.   This he denied, and

doctrines of the B?b, although            the latter rapidly developed
far beyond this point.         As these only concern us at present,
it is unnecessary        to examine   further the Sheykhi       theology.
It is sufficient    to note three points only of Sheykh Ahmad* s
teachings     : his extreme veneration       for tho Imams, whom he

as the incarnate Attributes        of God ; his belief that

We        now come            to the second of           the four periods             which     I

again     the   materials       for   an   examination        are   abundant,   but
copies     of    the books,      which       exist    only   in  manuscript,     are

all which he composed."               Here also M. le Comte de Gobineau
displays      his usual acumen and profound                    research.     In the
Persian    Bey an (V?hid     iii. chapter  17) the B?b says, "All

in the original    reality this term is confined     to verses    (i.e.
Arabic verses, like those of the Kur'?n,      ?y?t).

In other passages       of the same work    the B?b divides      all
his writings     into five classes, viz. Verses      (?y?t), Prayers

(mun?j?t), Commentaries      (taf?sir), Scientific   treatises (shi??n
?Hlmiyy?),    and Persian     writings      (kalim?t4-f?rsiyy?),       and
expressly   states that although        the term Bey?n        is properly
applicable   only to the first, it includes them all in a certain
sense. After     the mention    of this first Arabic     Bey?n, M. le
Comte de Gobineau       continues,    "One must especially          notice
amongst       them    (i.e. the Bab's works)            a              written       in

difficulties    of tho latter.      . . Besides      the two Bey?ns           which

S?ra-i-Y?suf,       and    the  so-called     Journal       of  the Pilgrimage"
This     is not intended        to include them all, for the learned
author adds, speaking of the works of the B?b, "

they were
sufficiently     numerous      considering      his   age    and    the   shortness
of his life."      Of several  others we have mention made in the
B?b?  history      of which  I   spoke in my    last paper.   Thus we
read of a Commentary on the Shra-i-Kawlhar           written at Sh?r?z
for Ak? Seyyid Yahy?           of D?r?b, and a Commentary         on the
Sura beginning      Wa'l-'Asr"       written at Isfahan for the Imam
Jum'aof    that city, as well as a Treatise on theProphetic Mission
of Muhammad        (Nubuvvat-i-I{7i?ssc)     written    for Minuchihr
Khan, Mu'tamadu'd-Dawlah,               then Governor      of Isfahan   ;

remain hidden      away amongst      them.    Tho    B?b   himself
states in one passage of tho Persian            that  his writings

Bey?n
comprise no less than 500,000   verses.
We      must      therefore   limit     our            to the five

investigations
works enumerated by M. le Comte de Gobineau,            and of these

it will obviously  bo desirable   to consider first of all the two
earlier ones, viz. the Commentary        on the S?ra-i-Y?stif,  and
the so-called Journal of the Pilgrimage.

Before proceeding      to do so, however,   let us glance once
more at. the circumstances    of their author. Originally destined
for commercial pursuits, our hero, M?rz? 'Ali Muhammad,         had
boon sent at the age of fifteen or sixteen to Bushire       to con
duct    his   father's   business       there.   From   his   childhood     he
seems     to havebeen addicted        to speculation   and reverie, and
we   can hardly      suppose    that he found his employment          at
Bushire   congenial.     At    any   rate after  a while  he undertook
the pilgrimage       to Mecca,     and remained      for some time at
Kerbel?    studying under H?j? Seyyid K?zim.            Even   then he
attracted    considerable  attention,     favourable or  unfavourable
according     to the disposition    of those who came in contact
with him.       Let us again refer to tho Kisasu'l-'Ulamd,           the
author of which, while        in Kerbel?,     saw the B?b on sundry
occasions.     He writes    thus : Several times I attended          the
lectures of IIaj? Seyyid K?zim.      Mir   'Ali Muhammad also
used   to come to his lectures, and had with him pen and ink
stand, and whatever Seyyid K?zim said, of moist or dry, he
used to write down in that samo lecture. And ho used to
shave his beard, or cut it close to the roots with a scissors.
The cause of his being known to the author of this book was

this, that one day I was seated with a holy and just person
at the head of the tomb of that Holy One (i.e. Huseyn),    when
we saw that 6ame           (i.e. the B?b) enter. And    he stood

Seyyid
at the entrance        of the holy place, and performed             his visit
(ziy?rat),   and   turned   back   from  that  same    place.    I asked of

'                            '
that holy person (i.e. my companion),            Who      is this person ?

That holy one replied, 'This man is Mir 'AH Muhammad                        of
Sh?r?z,     and  he   is one  of  the  pupils  of   H?j? Seyyid     K?zim.'
I said, 'Wh}' does this man perform his visit (ziy?rat) thus?'
'

That person replied,        For this reason, that he considers   this
manner more       in accordance with respect/      I replied, 'This

is a mistake,   for visiting   (the shrines) is an act of worship,
and   as wo  have been commanded,       and our Imams have taught
us, so should we perform       the visitation    ; and they have
ordained  that we should go up to the side of the pure tomb,
and should embrace    the most pure tomb.       But to stand afar
off by way of (showing)    respect is  as  though we were not to
recite      supererogatory   prayers                because       we      are unworthy            to
stand      in the court of God.* "l
A      fewlines further on the same author says : "A certain

' was
individual    relates,    I      seated with a pious personage    in the
burial-place     of the K?zimeyn2         (upon both of them be peace),
when Mir 'AH Muhammad                 came up to the door of the burial*
j)lace.  That pious person said,             May God kill this Seyyid,
and cause tho time of his death to arrive !              Then I said to
that pious person, "Why dost thou curse this person P" That
pious one said in reply,             In a little while vain beliefs will

appear    from     this person,    and   will rend the honour of the
Musulmans,         und   bo   the    cause    of the shedding   of their

blood."

From              the   above    extracts     we      learn     that

period,        at   this
before     he hadput forward any claim, and while still attend
ing the lectures of H?j? Seyyid K?zim,       the B?b had adopted
the practice   (unusual   in his class in Persia)   of shaving    the
chin, which he appears to have followed,          not merely    in a
casual manner,    as a simple matter   of choice, but from a dis
like to allowing    the beard to grow, for we find that subse
quently he commanded       his followers   to do the same.3 For

the rest, he followed    the practice   of the Sheykhis   in his
method    of visiting the shrines of the Imams, and from the

is ono of the distiuetive    practices of "the Sheykhis       to this day.    Hence     they speak
of other Shi'ite Muhaminudiins           as    Balunaris,"      i.e. those  who   go up to, and
embrace,    the head of the tomb.

principal places        pilgrimage

frequency with which he appears         to have dono so, we may
well   imagine    that  he had   imbibed   from his teachers that
extreme    love and veneration     of them which     characterized
the Sheylihi    6chool.

Bearing    in mind these facts, let us turn to examine the so
called "Journal     of the Pilgrimage,"

spoken of by Gobineau
as one of the earliest writings       of the B?b.       Of its contents,
no account     is given by the learned Frenchman             ; he merely
says that in this book the B?b was                  chiefly pious and

took  with     him   the Narrative     of   the Pilgrimage        and the

the same event:        "So when      he (the B?b)        had examined
Mulla    Huseyn,      by seeing and talking with him, and found

that he was firm iu his faith, he bade him journey to 'Irak
and Khur?s?n,         and enter every city and village, and invite
men      to him.     And he entrusted        to him the Ziy?rat-n?m?,
which he had composed for          the visitation of the Commander of

the Faithful     (i.e. 'Ali), and he likewise         gave    to him tho
Commentary        on    the  S?ra-i~Y?suf,      which    he   had   himself
written,    so that he might       read   it to  his converts, and make

the eloquence    of   the B?b      in those words       an argument   for his
perfections."

There   can, I apprehend, be no manner        of doubt that the
"                  "                              "
Ziy?rat-n?m?       spoken of here, and the Narrative          of the

mentioned    by  Gobineau,   are  one  and  the  same

work.     Now    the latter translation of the word Ziy?rat-ndm?
appears    to me somewhat misleading.          It might,    no doubt,

of   tho Pilgrimage";         but it has another,     and I think a
commoner meaning,        viz. a book of prayers to bo used on per
forming a ziy?rat, or visitation,      to the tombs of the Imams,
or other saints. And from the words of the Persian historian,

which he had composed for       the visitation of the Commander of
the Faithful"    (i.e. 'Alt), I think wo can have no doubt that

it is used      in this       latter      sense, and that it is such a book of
prayers     which        we must          look for as representing   the earliest
composition     of the B?b.

Now,    while   I was at Kirm?n,       one of my B?b? friends there
one day showed me a MS.             scroll, and informed me that it
was the Ziy?rat-name           "

of    Ilazrat-i-Nukta-i-Uia"         (i.e. the
B?b).      I had    not made     any     enquiries   for  this  work,    of
which,    indeed, I had forgotten          the existence,    so that the
communication      was quite spontaneous.          Of this I obtained a
copy, which    is now in my possession,    and 1 have no doubt
that this is the work spoken of by Gobineau        and the Persian
historian.   The style of the Bab's writings     is too remarkable
to be easily mistaken,  and the same peculiarities     are found in
this as in the Persian Bey?n.
Let us go a step further.    M?rz? K?zcm Beg, in his article
on "B?b and the B?b?s        in the Journal Asiatique,1    describes
a small manuscript      which had been procured for him by M.
Mclnikoif,    who had acquired     it, along with some B?b?   talis
mans,    in Teher?n.    Concerning     the manuscript he says  that

it "consists   of twenty-seven   pages of the size of a sheet (of
paper) folded in four, written   in Arabic; and containing     in
structions on the ceremonial    to be observed by every B?b?
who has to present himself to one of the masters of his doctrine,
either during a journey or at the threshold of his dwelling,
and when he appears before him."

Now  I believe    that M?rz? Kazem Beg was mistaken         in
thinking  that  this  was   the use for which the prayers in this
volume were       intended,    and I am almost certain    that the
manuscript    of   which    he speaks was none other than this
Ziy?rat-n?m?     of tho B?b which we are now considering.
Let   us                this     conclusion                        whether      we   can

verify                                    by   seeiug

niqu? au monde       la lumi?re ?manant de la sph?re du s?jour
de l'Eternel,    et cette essence      ?tait la v?tre."    Searching
through the Ziy?rat-ndm?        I find, just as M?rz? Kazem       Beg
says,     at the beginning       of the prayer    addressed    to the
friend of God,'      the following    passage :

Awwalu'     jawharin        tarriza       wa   ashraka,   ihumma   tala'a   wa

l? ha min  sdhati kurbi hadhraiiyl-ezel   'alaykum.         This I   . . ."

should   translate,    The first substance was formed and shono
forth, (and) then arose and gleamed          from the court of the
Presence   of the Eternal upon you. . . ." Neither       the Arabic

text nor my translation     is identical in meaning  with Kazem
Bog's rendering,      but the resemblance        is sufficiently   striking

to make it in the highest degree probable that he had in view
the same passage.       However,    let us take his second specimen,
which     runs thus: "N'eut      ?t? vous, rien (personne)         n'aurait
connu Allah      ; n'e?t ?t? vous, rien n'aurait           honor? Allah      ;
n'e?t ?t? vous, rien n'aurait glorifi? Allah             I      Two pages
further on in my text I find the following            passage :

Fa lawldkum, lam ya'rifi'll?ha      shci/un    ; wa lawldkum, lam
ya'budi-ll?ha   sheifun;  wa  lawldkum    lam  yukaddisi'll?ha      she/fun.

. . ." This I translate, " And were            it not for you, nothing
would       have    known       God    ; and were it not          for you, nothing
would       have

worshipped                 God ; and were             it not for j'ou,
nothing would have glorified God."    Here, at least, I think
there can be no doubt of the identity of my text and M?rz?
Kazem                 translated

Bog's                     specimen.
To establish the matter beyond     all reasonable                    doubt, how
ever, let us take his third specimen, which runs                      thus : "Allah
vous a consolid? sur son tron? ; il vous a donn?                      son verbe ; il
vous a design?   pour distribuer  ? chacun le lot                      (sort) qui lui
est destin? ; il vom a ?lu pour transmettre     leur                  destin a\ tous
ceux qui sont soumis ? la Providence,   etc."                      This, I have no
doubt, represents the following passage   :

TUE BABIS OP PERSIA.                                       899

Kad ja'alakum     mustakirrina   Ulla 'arshild, mCn-n?tddna
min Hndifd, iva'l-mu'tina     il? kulli did hakkin hakkahu, iva'l

tin kulli did hukmin hukmalm.     . ." This I trans
mnblighina

late  : "He (God) hath made you to abide near His           throne,
and to speak on His part, and to give to every one who hath
a claim his duo, and to convey His decision          to whomsoever
necdeth       one."

that I have now fairly proved
I think                                   that both the book
which      M?rz?Kazem Beg received       from M. Melnikoff,        and

"                                                  "
tho   Journal    (or Narrative) of  the  Pilgrimage        6poken of
by  M.  le Comte   do  Gobineau, are  identical   with  one   another,
and also with      the B?b? Ziy?rat-n?m?       obtained   by me in
Kirm?n.

I have discussed    this point at considerable       length because,
from an examination       of the B?b? MSS. in the British Museum,
and in the catalogues      of the Institut des Langues Orientales at
St. Petersburg,      I am convinced       that a great difficulty         in

identifying   B?b?  MSS.    exists, and  is one  of  the  chief  barriers
to a study of them and the doctrines         they embody.

Having    now, as I hope, sufficiently     established     the identity
of this, apparently      the earliest of the Bab's writings,           it is
necessary    to examine     briefly its contents.      It appears to be

rightly described   by theMuhammadan       historian as consisting
of instructions   and prayers for visiting      the shrines of the
Imams.   After a short invocation addressed        to God it begins:
"                        to visit the Friend    of God, or one of

After        this           follows           the prayer             to be used, which                        occupies
the rest of           the work.

Now        of this introduction                             I will only               remark            two    things.
Firstly,      we find enjoined                               the

Secondly, we see the germs of the Bab's own ideas, subse

he dares     to approach  them in supplication,    and ofTer them his

annihilation      inthem, although,      when     he remembers     his
imperfections  and sins, his gladness        ceases, and his J03' is

conqyleteness of your proofs, have   pardoned me, and concealed me,
as though I had not committed any fault,           nor wrought any

for closer   communion with the Imams (such as we have seen
Sheykh     Ahmad     Ahs?'?   believed  himself    to possess),    and

This work seems to me of tho utmost interest and import
ance in tracing     the gradual  formation  of the Bab's      ideas,
und, so far as I know, it is the sole record of this earl3r period
of his life, before he put forward any claim to divine inspira

tion.   In spite of the faults of grammar     and obscurities    of
style which mark this, along with all the other compositions
of the B?b, there is something   sublime and beautiful   in the
thought   concealed beneath  the somewhat  uncouth    phraseo

we behold, not the "B?b,"   nor the "Point

Muhammad,        the young      enthusiast,    the ardent    disciple     of
H?j? Seyyid K?zim.
And   now comes  the first change.              dint of dwelling on

By
these ideas, and concentrating   all his                  on the Imams,

thoughts
the unseen dispensers    of God's will,       M?rz?     'Ali Muhammad
becomes convinced     that he enjoys          the favour of a special
communication      with them. His teacher, H?j? Seyyid K?zim,
dies, and,    as has   been mentioned,   his disciples    are left in
doubt  as   to who    is to succeed him.    Of the   exact   sequence
of events it is difficult    to judge, by reason of tho difference
which   exist s between     the various accounts.      According     to
the B?b? historian, Mulla    lluseyn    of Bushraweyh      (who after
wards played so prominent      a part in the B?b? movement          till
his death at Sheykh Tabarsi         early   in  a.d. 1819)   went     to
Sh?r?z from Kerbel?       to be cured of a palpitation         of tho
heart   from which    he  suffered.       On    arriving   there, ho
enquired   for the house of M?rz?        'Ali Muhammad,     who had
been his friend and fellow-student         at Kerbel?,   and finding
his way there, knocked       at the door, which wras opened by the

latter himself, who welcomed     his old friend, and conducted
him into the house.     After   the customary    compliments and
enquiries, M?rz?     'Ali Muhammad    said : Is it not the case
that you Sheykhis   believe    that it is necessaiy  that after the
death of the departed Sey3Tid some one should take his place ?
It is now five months     since he died.     After him, who is his
successor?"    Mulla     lluseyn    replied,  "We    have not yet
recognized    any one." M?rz?     'Ali Muhammad      said, "What

sort of person must he be?"     After a little reflection, Mulla
Huse3Tu described the qualities    and attributes which must bo

found in him.       Do 3rou behold those signs in me ? asked

the B?b.   Mulla Huseyn    knew that M?rz? 'Ali Muhammad
had onty studied at Kerbel?     for about two months,      and had
not while    there shown any signs of an unusual         degree of
knowledge,     besides    having    received    onl3r a rudimentary
education previous^.        He   was   therefore greatly  astonished
at the question,     and replied,     I see none of these signs in

a shelf, takes it up and reads a
S?ratiCl-Baleara     lying on

little, and is surprised at tho new meanings        which    it dis
closes.   He asks M?rz?        'AH Muhammad,      "Whose    book is
this?"    but the latter only replies, "A youthful     tyro (juv?ni

t?z?-k?r) has written    it, and he shows forth exceeding   know
ledge and greatness."
Next   day they have        another    similar conversation,   and the

sees    him
B?b    again asks Mulla      Huseyn      if he       in      the signs of
spiritual  leadership.       The    latter marvels     at the persistent
way he returns to this point, and determines     to convince him
of his deficient learning by asking him some questions.         To
his amazement,     these are answered with surprising    readiness
and clearness ; nay, even his inward thoughts         and doubts
seem to be divined       and answered    by  the   B?b.     He     is
astonished, yet unwilling     to believe    in this unlettered   youth,
whom he has always looked on as so inferior in knowledge                to
himself.    Finally, however,    he   is convinced,   and   accepts  the
doctrine   of the B?b with      an earnestness      and sincerity      to
which his subsequent     deeds bear ample witness.           Once con
vinced, Mulla Huseyn        does not rest idle. He         hastens   to

inform his fellow-disciples,    who     are still   in doubt    as to
whom    they should      choose    as a successor      to their    late
teacher; many    of  these    come   to Sh?r?z,   and  after more    or

accept the new creed.

less hesitation                          Thus was formed the
first nucleus     of

tho B?b?s.
The above particulars    are derived from the B?b?

history,
of which I obtained     a MS. copy at Sh?r?z, and of which
another    copy exists  in the Library    of the British Museum,
numbered     Or. 2942.    There   are difficulties  connected with
this   account, for, according   to  the  N?sikhu't-Taw?r?kh,      it
was at Kufa        that M?rz?     'Ali Muhammad      first put forward
his claims, and Gobineau         supports  this statement    (though he
does not explicitly state       that he began to preach openly till
his    return   to Sh?r?z)

; while   in another part of this same
B?b?     history         account

another         of the first beginnings        of
B?b? ism makes Medina    the scene of the earliest disclosure     of
his doctrines. M?rz? Kazem        Beg   follows   the N?sikhu't
Taw?r?kh, but represents    the B?b as revisiting Mecca       after

he     had gathered     round him     some disciples   at Sh?r?z.
According     to  this account, which   best explains the difficul

> ties of the case, it was on his return to Sh?r?z in a 11. 1260

(a.d. 1814) that the B?b was arrested by order of M?rz?

Huseyn        Khan,     governor     of F?rs,     owing      to the progress
which the sect founded by him made under the active leader

ship of Mulla        Huseyn.       This view, too, is not free from
difficulties,     since    the B?b     expressly    fixes the date of the
Zuh?r      (by  which     I  suppose    is meant    the   time when he first
became        convinced      of his divine       mission)      as the 5th of

A.n. 1260
Jnm?di-ul-U'l?,               (May 23rd, 1844), while, accord

ing to M?rz? Kazem Beg,    it was in October of the same year
that he was arrested     and imprisoned     at Sh?r?z.   It is
evidently impossible that in the space of six months he could
have come to Sh?r?z from Kerbel?,     gained adherents   there,
visited Mecca,   and returned   to Sh?r?z;   and it is equally

impossible   that he should have begun preaching    any definite
doctrine    on his own account before the date of the Zuh?r
which he himself gives very accurately   in the Persian Bey?n.
I cannot          help thinking            that M?rz?        Kazem         Beg has been
misled       by     the somewhat          proleptic         account       of the Persian
historian,     who, after            stating  the "mischief"

that               (fitn?)
began in a.h. 12G0, describes what follows up to the removal
of the B?b        to Isfahan    continuously,    not recurring     to tho
subject    till he  comes    to  speak  of  Kurratu'l-'Ayn,    and    thus
certainly    including     in the account which ho gives of tho
occurrences     of the year a.h. 12(i0 events which        took placo
subsequently      to  that   date.  This  view  is confirmed   by the
B?b? historian,      who makes     the arrest of the B?b at Sh?r?z
occur in Ramaz?n,        A.n. 1261 (September, 1846).      This gives
us a year and a half between          the Zuh?r and the Bab's first
imprisonment,   a space of time                              sufficient    for the events

amply
described as having occurred in it.
We     must        now     turn    our     attention       to   the                  on

Huseyn     carried         with     him on his missionary   journey to 'Irak
and Khurasan.             This      work is subsequent    to the Zuh?r, and
though much            bolder       in its dogma     than the Ziy?rat-n?m?,

which we have         already   considered,      it is less so than the

that this is so. Since Baron llosen has so well described     the

each of which, except the first, stands a verse from the S?ra

which     appears   to have a very slight           connection  with    the
text.  These             chapters arc, in the St. Petersburg                                    copy, stated

1844, and December,        1845,   and   therefore    stands    midway
between the Ziy?rat-ndm?        and the Persian Bey?n.           In it a
distinct claim to a divine mission      is put forward.       Thus,    in
the first chapter, it is written,

God     hath   decreed

that this book, in explanation     of the
'best of stories' (i.e. the  S?ra-i-Y?suf,    which  is so  called),
> should come forth from Muhammad,             son of Hasan,    son of

of 'Ali, son of Abu T?lib, unto his servant, that it may be

> the proof of God on the part of the Remembrance1           reaching
the two worlds."

It is interesting    to observe that the claim put forward at
this period by M?rz?         'Ali Muhammad       is that he enjoys a
special spiritual     communion     with tho  twelfth or absent Imam

(Im?m-i-Gh?'ib),       whose    return, as  tho   Imam Mahdi,     tho
Shi'ites are expecting.        So far our author does not go much
beyond Sheykh Ahmad,            who, as we have seen, claimed        to

> receive   instructions   from the absent Imams.             It is, I think,
in this    sense    that M?rz?      'Ali Muhammad          at this period
assumes     the title of      B?b,"     or " Gate       ; he is the gate

that of "Nukla-i-U'l?"                            or "Nukta-i-Bey?n"

(the first Point),
(the Point   of Utterance,     or                    ; i.e. Revelation).

Explanation
Amongst     those  who   did  not   embrace     his  doctrines,    the title
of B?b was still applied          to him, and his followers             thus

> received,       and are still known            by,         the name      of B?b?s.          The
latter, however,    never                mention

M?rz?       'Ali Muhammad
now as the B?b, but call him either "Hazrat-i-A'l?"               (His
Highness    the Supreme),     or " IIazrat-i-Nukla4-U'l?"          (His
Highness     the First   Point),   or " Ilazrat-i-Rabb?     ul-A'l?

(Fus Highness      my Lord tho Supreme).           Neither     do they call
themselves     B?b?s as a rule, but rather "AhhCUBcydn,"                    or
"Ahlu'l-Beh?,"         according     to whether     their sacred book          is
the Bey an, or whether         they are believers      in Beh?.1      In the
writings     of the latter the term MahCul-Bcy?n                  or "Ahlul
Bry?n"       (people of tho Bey?n)        often means those B?b?s who
do not accept Beh? as Ho whom God shall manifest,"                          i.e.
the Ezelis,    whom, as I have said, the Bella*is detest.
There-are     a few other

points which it is desirable       to notice
with     regard     to   the     Commentary       on   the  Sura-i-Y?suf"
Outwardly,       at least, tho dictates of Islam seem to be in the
main     accepted, and the Kur'?n            is not declared      to be abro
gated.      Thus it is written,        "Whosoever       denies Islam, God
will not accept from him any of his actions                   in the Da3r of
Resurrection."            At      the same
it is implied that a true

time
knowledge           of what                     means

is to be obtained
Islam

only
through   the B?b: "And     verily God  will not accept from
any one any of his actions, save from him who comes to the
B?b         (Gate) by the B?b                  (Gate) arloring God the Eternal,
commended   on the part of                     the B?b."

The month   of Ramaz?n                        is ordered         to be kept     as a fast,
and       no   mention      seems         to    be   made     of    the   new    month         of

> fasting,    consisting    of nineteen    ?wy^, which was afterwards
instituted.

Smoking        is forbidden    absolutely.  We    know   from tho
N?sikhu't-Taw?r?kh           that the refusal of the earlier B?b?s to

smoke     the kaly?n (water-pipe),      so much    in vogue     in Persia,
was                 as one of their distinguishing          marks.      At
regarded

for              Mulla               and    some of his
Y?rjamand,             example,            Huseyn
followers were invited to supper by one Ak? Seyyid Muham
mad, a Musulm?n          ; but when pipes and coffe? were brought

in, the  former   declared    them unlawful,     and a violent discus
sion ensued, which terminated           in tho  host  forcibly expelling
his

guests.1
Divorce     appears    to be forbidden,2 as well       as the use of

drugs    to             abortion.     Marriage   with    unbelievers   is

produce
prohibited    until  they  believe.
Although,      so far, there is no great divergence          from tho

and  doctrines    of  Islam,  there are   other  passages of
precepts
a different type, which suggest a considerable          development   of
the Mb's            In these he not only reprobates the 'Ulam?,

ideas.
and lays stress   on  his divine mission, but even distinguishes

> the believers  in his book from tho "people of the Kur'?n,"

thus at least implying     that the former is a new revelation.
Thus he says :
"                                    thanks to God, for verily

O people of the earth ! Give
we have delivered you from the doctors of doubt ('Ulam?'udh

dhann), and have caused you to attain unto the region of the
blessed         Sinai."3
Again    he says :

"And verity God hath made lawful the food of the people
of the Ku'r?n      to the people of this book, and verily we have
made     lawful the food of the people of the book (Jews and
Christians?)    unto them."

Of himself      he speaks often, but in various,      and often
> very enigmatical     ways.    Thus  in one  place he calls  himself
"This well-favoured     Arabian youth, in whose grasp God hath

he says,      O people of the earth ! hear the voice of your Lord,

B?b?s believe that in every Zuhur        or " manifestation          there
must  be a Point        of Darkness,"    opposed   to   the    Point     of
Light,"      they     readily accepted            this wonderfully            appropriate
application         of the words of              the Kur'?n,     and          thenceforth
identified H?j? Muhammad  Karim Khan                             with the former.

We      must now turn to consider the                           latest works of the
B?b, in which his doctrine is fully elaborated.

Wo     know,    from the investigations           of M.     le Comte      de
Gobineau,     that there are at least three Bey?ns,            two of these
being in Arabic,     and one in Persian.          Of the shorter Arabic

a translation    is given by    this writer    in his "Religions
Bey?n
et Philosophies     dans TA sie Centrale."          The original       text of

this I have not seen, neither do I know whether                 it exists in

Europe,    though     it is probabty      included amongst          the B?b?
MSS.    obtained    by  Gobineau      in  Persia,    which     were    six in
number.1      A work, which would              seem to be the longer
Arabic        Bey?n,   is mentioned       by Dorn,2 who gives extracts
from      it,  but of this likewise     I do not possess a copy, neither
do I think       that    it is to be found in the British Museum.

With     the Persian   Bey?n     it is otherwise.   A very good
MS.    copy of this, written     by   the   great B?b? poet Nabil,
whoso chronology      of the life of Beh? I have already spoken
of, exists in the British Museum        (Or. 2819).  Another copy,

in the St. Petersburg     Library,     is very fully described, with
extracts,  by  Baron  Victor   Rosen.3      A third I was fortunate
enough   to   obtain with    some   difficulty,  and much     entreaty,
from some of my B?b? friends            in Persia ; and I have satis
fied myself    of its identity with   the other     two.    I shall
therefore   tako this as representing  the ultimate    doctrine   of
tho B?b, since I have been able to study it at my leisure,
and there is ample internal evidence      in it to prove     that it

was   composed during    the last three years of the life of its
author, i.e. during  his imprisonment   at M?k?    (1847-1850).
Before proceeding   to sum up the doctrines   contained   in this,
however, I will dispose of the other works of the B?b.

These, as I have pointed out, were numerous       ; but so far
as I am aware      no copy of tho Commentaries             on the Suras
entitled respectively   Bakara, Kawthar,        or   'Asr   has found its
way    to Europe.    It is much    to be  hoped   that   efforts  to obtain
these may     be  made   by   those   who   have    the   opportunity      of

an
doing so, in order that all the materials             for       exhaustive
examination      of the tenets of this religion and their gradaai

development     may be collected while this is still possible.

Of one other work,        however, which        is attributed      to the

B?b, I possess a copy.         This is known amongst          the B?b?s as

"                                           but     MS.    thereof is,

written    in proof of the divine mission            of the B?b.       I am
unable to determine        its authorship,     but  from  the  stylo  of the
document       I do not   think that it was composed by the B?b
himself, although       it is less easy to pronounce                       on

manner   of thought and expression.      I should conjecture    the
writer  to have been    one  of  the  Bab's    companions   rather
than himself.    The epistle in question    appears to have been
written   in answer to a letter from one of the disciples        of

and               forth   certain   difficulties    which     the questioner

of the latter such remarks as "which                     you yourself         have

we    cannot    with    certainty    determine       either     the
Though

writer    of the letter, or the person to whom it was addressed,
it is possible to fix the date of its composition

approximately.

> It was written after the publication    of the Bey?n, from which
the writer quotes, and of which he speaks much.           The B?b
is also spoken of twice as confined             in the mountain    of
M?h?,"      and allusion      is made    to the sufferings which he had
undergone.        Now      the   B?b     was   imprisoned      at M?k?        for
about three years, viz. from the spring                  of a.d.      1847     till
his martyrdom        in July,      1850, and this book was therefore
composed during         this period.       But one passage,        if I under
stand it aright,       fixes its date still more accurately,             for the
writer quotes a prophetic          tradition of Kumeyl       concerning       the
events of five successive years of tho Zuhur, and,

speaking
of the first four, points out this                    as
prophecy       already fulfilled,

*
adding,    "and   in  the  fifth   year   thou  shalt see  (fulfilled),     there
shone forth a light from         the morning of Eternity,'        if thou dost
not thyself flee away and becomo troubled."

Now     since "the beginning            of the Zuhur"         was in A.n.
1260 (a.d. 1844), this would fix the date of this work as a.h.

1264, or early in a.h. 1265 (a.d. 1848-49),     i.e. about a year
or a year and a half before the B?b's death.

The book itself contains    an excellent     summary      of the
arguments   for the truth of the  new  religion, which     are also
given    in substance, but with less conciseness    and               sequence,
in the Persian    Bey?n  ; and in a  fuller form in  the              ?k?n.     I
shall therefore choose this place to set them forth                    once and
for all.   In doing so, I shall state them as briefly                 as is con

sistent with clearness ; and, as none of the three works from
which I quote are yet available            to the public, it appears           to
me unnecessary        to give references     to particular passages.

Briefly   stated, then, the line of argument                is this: The
Unchanging       and   Unchangeable      Essence      of  God      has existed

from Eternity       of Eternities    in unapproachable            Glory    and
Purity.      No   one  has   known   It   as  It  should    bo    known, and
no one has praised It as It should be                         It   is above all

It should be known          through aught else.          From It was pro

duced Its Creation, which      has had no beginning         in time,
and shall have no end. This Kmanatiou              or Creation was
produced by the Primal Will      (Mashiyyat-i-U'l?),    and though
eternal in duration, is subsequent  to the latter as to causation.
Since it is impossible       for created beings    to know the Divine
Essence,    the Primal Will      has, for their guidance and instruc
tion, incarnated      itself from time to time in a human form.
These    incarnations      are known     as " Prophets,"   and there
have been endless numbers            of them in the Past, as there
will bo in tho future.        That which    spoke in all tho prophets
of the Past,    now    speaks through     the B?b (or the Nukta,      to

> speak more     accurately,   6ince, as we have seen, the former
title belongs   to a period antecedent   to these teachings),  and
will speak through        Him whom God shall manifest          (Man
yudjhhiruhu'll?li),   and after him through others, for there is
no cessation     to these Manifestations.    The Primal Will      is

like the Sun, which         rises and sets day after day, but is
always the 6ame Sun         in reality, though we may, in ordinary
parlance,   speak of        the sun of to-day,"     or    the sun of
yesterday."     So in like manner,       though we  may, in common
language,    speak of Adam, Noah, Moses, David,            Jesus, and
Muhammad       as distinct,     in truth that which spoke in each of

them was One, viz. the Primal Will.   This   is the meaning
of  the saying of Muhammad,    "Amma^n-nabiyyuna,    fa ana"

But as to tho prophets, I (am thorn)."    The last manifes
tation   of     the Primal  Will        took place        1*270 years ago
(counting      not from  tho  hijra,     but   from   the   first revelations
received by Muhammad           till the beginning           of this Zuhur),
and it has    now  incarnated      itself in M?rz?        'Ali Muhammad,
the Nukta,   and speaks through him.

In each manifestation     news has been given of the follow
ing one.    Thus the Jews were told to expect a Messiah,                   but
when he came as Jesus they rejected him, because they had
imagined     his coming    in a different way, and one which was
impossible,    and contrary     to nature.        So again the followers
of Christ wrere told to expect His                return, yet when He
returned    as Muhammad          they      for  the  most part failed to

recognize      Him,   and are    to this day     expecting    His   coming,

although more than a thousand years have elapsed since that
took place.    So likewise    the Muhammadans            are expecting

the coming of the Imam Mahdi,             and continue      to pray for
that day when he shall appear, and, whenever              they mention
his name, add the formula        'ajjala'll?fmfara.jah,"       May God
hasten his gladness    ; yet  now    he  has    come,  with   verses and
signs (?y?t va  bayyin?t), they refuse      to recognize   him, because
the manner of his coming does not correspond with their own
vain imaginings    of how he ought to come.

The Muhammadans        in particular    are now addressed thus :
You     blame       tho Jews

because     they  did  not accept Christ as
the promised Messiah.        You     also condemn       the Christians
because they did    not              Muhammad        as   the Promised
recognize
Comforter,  although Christ has clearly said,          Ya'ti   min baUli
ahadun, ismuhu Ahmad'       (One shall   come  after  me    whose name
is Ahmad1)."

You      admit  that they were led to expect certain prodigies as
announcing       and   ushering     in this return of the Promised One,
but that these were           intended, and should have been under
stood,   in a  spiritual    sense.     So far you are right.        All sacred
books are written        in a mystical      language     which    needs    inter

as  it is said       the  Prophet   of   the Kur'?n     that  each
pretation,                     by
verse has meanings           within                  ;  and    as  the  Imams

meanings
'

intend by it seventy-one           (diff?rent)   aspects.'     This     sym
bolic language is common to all the prophets,               and the key to

> it is given in the sacred books themselves.               By the Sun, for
instance,   is meant    the  Primal  Will,     manifesting    itself in the

of  the         as before explained.        By   the Moon and
Prophet             Age,
stars are meant        his immediate         companions      and   disciples.

1 It is              believed                            at any rate in Persia, that such

generally                by Muhammadans,
words were spoken            Christ, and are to bo found in the Gospels.           The belief is

by
no doubt based on the prophecies            concerning    the  Varuc1ctey lor which word they
would substitute Vcrxklwlm, which corresponds                 in meaning with Ahmad or .Mu

hammad      (praised,    laudable).       See   Ihn llish?im's    "life   of Muhammad"      u\.

a hadan rather than ihdd.

an end, while the actual world is eternal), it is said that              the
Sun shall be darkened, and the stars shall fall from heaven,' or

the like, what     is meant    is that the sacred book of tho last
Manifestation      is abrogated,     and the divines,      or priests,    or
mullas, whose honour         and                          on  their  being

the expounders       of that book, have fallen from this high
privilege,     since their book is now superseded        by another.
Such is the meaning       of the S?rafu't-Takwir    (eh. lxxxi. Sale's

the stars shall fall,' and of the Suratu'l-Infitar      (eh. lxxxii.),
which begins, When          the heavens shall be cloven in sunder,
and when the stars shall be scattered.'

seek to justify their own unbelief.

or unintelligently
Have      they accepted Islam intelligently,
as a mere inheritance from their parents ? If the latter, they
are not truty believers at all, inasmuch as they believe with
out reason, and are, in fact, exactly                like the unbelievers        of
old,  who     answered   the               of   the            who     came     to

appeals              prophets

what proofs have they accepted                 it? They have never seen
the prophet, neither have they witnessed any miracles,                   so that

When       his opponents      demanded       a sign, ho challenged           them

to imitate the Kur'?n,         saying,    'Produce a siira like it, if yo

speak truly.'  No one of his adversaries was able to do this,
and for twelve centuries and more the challenge had remained
unanswered.   Now,     in these days, a young man of the race

of H?shim,  M?rz? 'Ali Muhammad     of Sh?r?z, had come, and
claimed a divine mission,  in proof of which he had produced

.verses and a book like the Kur'?n,     but surpassing    it in
wisdom    and eloquence.    If then the Kur'?n    itself was a

sufficient proof of the divine mission               of Muhammad,           the
Bey?n     was                             evidence     of   the truth   of   the

equally satisfactory
prophetic     claim    advanced    by   its  writer.    Which      was   more
wonderful     ? That Muhammad,              brought     up from his youth
amongst     the   Arabs, should, in the       course  of a sufficiently    long
life, produce     a                     small    book    like  the  Kur'?n,

comparatively
written    in his native language;          or that this young Sh?r?z?,
untrained       in the learning       of colleges,      and accounted         as
nought by        the  learned,  should     in   the  space   of a  few   hours
write    thousands of verses, like those of the Kur'?n,                 in Arabic,
which was not his native            tongue,     and     in  which     he   had not
been instructed P          It was objected           that the verses of the
Bey?n were not only not eloquent, but that they were full of
grammatical      errors.     Such an objection           showed ignorance of

the nature of the proof on which Muhammad's                        claim rested.
The Kur'?n       was not so                          in the ordinary mean

Such,    in brief, is the lino of argument               adopted by tho
B?b?s in dealing with Muhammadans.                     Its cogency      is so far
recognized by many         of   the   latter   that  they  do  not   ofteu   seek

already)
The reasons which have led me to take the Persian

Bey?n
instead of either of the two Arabic Bey?ns'have         been already
set forth.

On a perusal     of the Bey?n,      three peculiarities     therein
strike   us most                These   are : firstly,   the peculiar

who     will  confirm what he pleases of the Be}?n,              and alter
what     he pleases;     thirdly,  the certainty  with which    the  writer

> speaks    of  the   ultimate     prevalence    which  his  religion will
obtain.    These three points must be considered           in detail.

First,   then, what is the significance         of the number nine
teen, and of the peculiar arrangement            of the Bey?n ?

Each of the letters of the Arabic alphabet has, as is well
known, a numerical         value, and according to these values they
are arranged       in an order differing       somewhat       from that in
which      they  are   ordinarily             Hence       every word may

placed.
bo represented       by  a corresponding    number,      formed   by adding

together the values of its component            letters.    This property
is utilized    in representing          dates by a sentence which at once
describes    tho events, and sums up in the numerical                      values of

its component         letters that number which                it is desired        to
chronicle.      The cabbalistic method              of interpreting         texts, or

their     inmost     meanings,      depends      on    the    same
discovering
property    of    the    letters,   as does   the science   of    talismans.        In
short,  the       Science       of  the  Letters,"     and    the      Science      of
Numbers,"        are    in    the  East    highly   esteemed      and    diligently
cultivated,    and skill therein has always been considered                         an
accomplishment        of the highest   order.   The subject has been

> treated of at considerable      length by M.   le Comte de Gobineau
> in his Trait? des Ecritures    Cun?iformes.      Sheykh Muhiyyu'd
Din    ibnu'l-'Arabi,    a learned Arab of Spain, who flourished
at the end of the twelfth and beginning              of the thirteenth
centuries     of our era, and whose           numerous    and erudite

writings   profoundly    affected Muhammadan        mysticism,    and
arc still          studied   in Persia and  Turkey,   employed    this

science largely in his interpretation      of the Kur'?n.      I have

a
already, in note, made use of his explanation          of the mean

ing of the letter Bd, to explain why the B?b called himself

the B? which pervades all the Letters    ; and the fact that
he also discovered     the sacred  character   of the number
nineteen may well make us ask if the B?b may not also have
been     influenced   by his views.
Interesting     as  the     Science of the Letters             is, I have not
space    to  treat   of it here      at   any length, but         must    confine
myself    to what is necessary         for a comprehension          of the point
under discussion.       We      have seen that the letter Bd in the

"                    "     "
world of letters corresponds           to the     Primal Will           or First
Intelligence,"      since it       follows the (letter) Alif,           which      is
placed    to  correspond    with     tho   Essence      of  God."      Now    Alif
stands for One, and in Arabic One is Vdhid.9                           If we add
up  the  numerical      values   of   the  letters   in   this word    V?hid, we
find    that tho number 19 results.   Thus 1 represents     the un
manifested    Essence  of God, and 19 the first manifestation     of
the  same.    Again, God is absolute Being,     which   in Arabie
is called    Fnj?d."    If we add up tho letters in this word,
19 is again produced.      So also in the formula Bismi'lldhi'r
Rahmdni' r-Rahim,'        In tho Name    of God the Merciful     the
Clement,"  which      is used         before     commencing          any   action,
there are 19 letters.

as they are
Now      all things that exist do so only so far
permeated       by   the  Divine     Essence.      It   is  the   One     Being
diffused through them, and manifested                in them, which raises
them from Nothingness            ('adam) to the rank of "Contingent"
or "Possible       Being"      (imk?n), i.e. Being,        the existence        or
non-existence       of which       is equally possible       (as opposed        to

Vuj?d-i-Viijihu'1-Vuj?d"           "Necessarily      Existing        Being,"

which cannot even be thought of as ceasing                   to exist).     This
atllux of Being         whereby       the   Contingent      exists     is  called
> Feys i-Akdas'        (the Most. Holy Outpouring),            and sometimes
'                                           "

Vtihid-i-mri    dar jami'-i-a'ddd,'          tho One which         pervades
all tho Numbers."          When,        therefore, we descend         from tho

sphere of Absolute         Being,      and the undifferentiated            Divine
Essence,     to that of       the Names,"        i.e. of Differentiation       and
Plurality,     we  must     take    into   account      the    One    pervading
the Numbers         whereby      the latter exist.

Thus, one of the principal Attributes                 or Names     of God is
'                                                     sum

Ilayy,'   the  Living.       If  we    take   the           of the    letters of
this word,     we   find it is 18. Adding             to  this the number of
> the Alif?the         One pervading         the Numbers"?we            again get
the sacred number 19.

Tho number          1, therefore,    represents    tho Unmanifcsted,
Undifferentiated,        Unknowable      Essence;      19, the manifesta
tion thereof.               a step further, we find 19 x 19, i.e. 301,

('adad-i-Jcullu    shey,' "the   number      of All   Things;"     and    if
we add up tho values of the letters in kullu shey*l we find
they come to 3(30, which,            with    the     One pervading       the
Numbers,"       makes 361.

The number        19, being thus recognized       by the B?b as the
> sncred number, plays           a prominent part in his system.                  God,
the One (Fa/?rf=19),             the True Existence             (Vuj?d?lV),        the

books of tho sect, and is not often used oven for that purpose.
When      it is used, the day is usually given             in both of the two
manners       explained,        as,     for   instance,   in   the following

Although     the sacred character           of   the number        19 was thus

prominently    brought            forward

by                the B?b,       he by no means

implies that it was unknown     to previous                     prophets.    On the
contrary, he not only points out that the number             of letters
in the Bism?lldh?r-Rahmani'r-Rahim,"            which stands at the
head of every chapter in the Kur'?n,        is 19, but further that
the total number of the chapters themselves                =            is

(114     19x0)
a multiple   of the sacred number.     So,    in  every   "Manifesta
tion,"    tho 18 "Letters1   of the Living"            have appeared
surrounding     tho "Point,"  and   amongst      their   number there

is always at least ono woman?F?timu           in the Manifestation
of Islam, Kurratu'l-'Ayn     (Jen?b4-T?hir?)        in the present
one.   I have not a complete      list of the 18 disciples of the
B?b who constituted    the "Letters     of the Living,"   and each
of    whom      bore     a

special   title, but two at least, besides
Kurratu'l-'Ayn,   aro  prominent      figures in the history of the
sect, viz. Mulla Huseyn     of Bushraweyh     (Jcn?b-i-Bdbul-B?b),
and H?j? Mulla Muhammad               'Ali of B?lfur?sh      (Jen?b-i
Kudd?s).     So         also the B?b declares    that "He whom God
shall manifest            will appear with   his 18    Letters of the
Living."

It is unnecessary           to describe     in detailthe part played by
the sacred number               in the    ordinances       the new religion.

of
The system of coinage, the construction               of places of worship,
the fines inflicted for transgressions,             and the taxes to be
levied, are   all  arranged    on   the   same    basis, so that, to quote
from the Bey?n         (V?hid   vii.  eh.  viii.),     It seems to be seen
that the mystery         of the V?hid        will gain currency         till it
pervades   all   things,  until  even    the  pens    in  the  pen-case   shall
bo according    to the number of           the V?hid,"

Before  leaving this subject,           one point must be noticed.    I
have 6aid that the B?b? sacred             books were to be composed on
this plan, and that the longer             Arabic Bey?n   is so, we know
from Dorn's description    of the          St. Petersburg MS.     But the
Persian     Bey?n,       and    the shorter Arabic Bey?n translated by

believe that the latter is the case, and that the half-finished
works were intended     to bo a perpetual   reminder to the Bab's
followers that the revelation    they had received was not final,
and that they must continually      look for the coming of Him
whom God       shall manifest."
This   brings me to the second                peculiarity  I spoke of in the

put forward         by the B?b?s,             they   consider   that men   have
continually       fallen into error in not       recognizing      the fact that
the revelation which               believed      in was not final.         Con

have always        for the most       part rejected        it. The B?b            is
determined      that his followers         shall be, as far as possible,
prepared and warned          against    this danger, so that they may
have no excuse for failing            to recognize      and accept          Him
M-honi God shall manifest"          when ho appears.
We    have seen that, according             to the B?b's       teaching,     all
prophets     are     incarnations      or       manifestations           of    the

Primal Will."         In this sense, therefore,         the)' are all equal,
but the    same    cannot   bo    6aid  of   their revelations.        For the
human     race   is ever progressing,        and consequently,                as a

children must be told things in a simple manner which they
can easily understand,      so with the human race in its earlier
stages   of development.      For    instance,     if we wish    to explain
to a child that knowledge       is a pleasant              we may tell it

thing,
that it is sweet like sugar, though              in reality there is no

results, and evil bitter, by comparing     the condition   of the
good after death to people   in beautiful   gardens   surrounded
with all such things as they are accustomed     to consider most
pleasant, while  the wicked, on  the  contrary,   are said to be

consumed                in fire.       But    now    the world            has reached            a stage of
development                     when      it can      be      told        the       truth       about these

things without                     parables   and similes, viz. that Paradise    is
belief,           and Hell           unbelief.   But although    this revelation  is
much              fuller        than preceding    ones, it must not be considered
final.             On the contrary,  it is merely   intended to prepare the
world             for the fuller measure    of truth which will be uttered
by "Him whom God          shall manifest."                                    The Bey?n    is the
seed ; his revelation will be the fruit.                                    Whenever    men are
sufficiently  "educated"   in the Bey?n,                                    He whom God shall
manifest"     will appear.  The day of his coming    is known to
God alone, and when he comes, he will      come              even

suddenly,
as the "Nukta"       did.  Should any one at any time come and
claim      to be He, and produce      the necessary     proof   of his

identity,   viz. "verses" (?y?t), no   one is to dare   to deny him.

Thus      in the 8th chapter   of the 6th V?hid        it is written   :
"And                     have     not    so much        sense        as    to                     that   none

ye                                                               perceive
but God can reveal verses.     Know,   therefore,    that this is the
same Primal             to  whom   God    revealed    verses    in the

Reality
beginning   of Islam.  If  ye had  understood     the  proof  of  your
own religion, you would also have understood            this Matter.
Just as, from the time of Muhammad           until now, which         is

> 1270 years, no one has been able to produce verses            like it
> (i.e. the Kur'?n),so likewise after the setting of this Sun (i.e.

after the death  of the B?b) will it be, until He whom God
shall manifest shall appear.   It is impossible that any one other
thanHim whom God shall manifest can lay claim to thisMatter.
.   .   .                   one makes        such              and       verses

If        any                           claim,                            appear    from    him,
none must  oppose him, lest perchance sorrow come upon that Sun
of Truth.  Had     the people of the Kur'?n    acted thus, all their
books would not have become vain.     So, therefore, if yon hear of
such a matter, and are not certain, do not do anything which
may be the cause thereof (i.e. of bringing        sorrow on Him
whom God shull manifest),      even though it really be other than

926                         TUB BABIS OF PERSIA.

him (i.e. even though              the claimant     be not really He           whom
God shall manifest).              But     this is an inwossible idea.

But if
he (the claimant) merely mention His         name (i.e. the name of
Him    whom God shall manifest),           it is far from     those who
possess Bis    love to grieve him, out of respect for His Name.
For the matter is not outside one of two alternatives.        Either    it

isHe   (and in  truth  it is impossible that   it should be other   than
Him,     in that he reveals verses spontaneously),       and why then

should any   one deny the Truth, since they have acted night and
day in expectation thereof?      Or, which is an impossible supposi

> tion, he is not ; in that case let him alone ; it is not for creatures
toJudge him, out of respect to theName        of their Beloved."

We     cannot fail to be struck by the fact that when the
B?b was a prisoner        and an exile at M?k?,         probably well

aware of what his ultimate         fate would be, he showed far
more anxiety about the reception which            should be accorded
to Him       whom God shall manifest            than about himself.
That he did anticipate      in some degree the cruel fate in store
for him,        the
followiug   words of his, quoted      in the B?b?

: "       as
history,1   sufficiently   prove      It is    though    I heard the
voice of one crying        in my inmost heart,     the most acceptable

thing is that thou shouldst sacrifice thyself in the way of God,
even as Huseyn        (upon him be peace) sacrificed himself in my
way;    and,   did  I   not regard this mystery,       by Him     in whose
hand  is  my   soul   ! even were    all   the  Kings   of  the Earth    to

could   not  take    from   me   a                  and
assemble,    they                                     single letter,"
he      concludes      b)' stating that the object of this sacrifice is
"                       know the degree of my patience, and content

that all may
ment,      and   sacrifice   in   the   way   of   God."

Almost    every ordinance      in tho Bey?n      is similarly designed
to be a perpetual      reminder of        Him whom God shall mani
fest."    Thus,    in every assembly       of believers, a vacant place
is to be left for Him, and, if possible, 18 more empty seats
for the      Letters   of the Living         who accompany Him,          so
that,  if  they  como   suddenly,    all  may   bo  prepared     for them.

1 These words of the Biib     are also quoted iu the Vkun, and the passage where

by Baron ltoseu [Manuscrits Bersans
noted                                           de l Institut,
they occur is specially
etc'p.   43).

Whenever    His name is montioned,      all must   rise from their

scats. None of tho believers     in the Bey?n must grieve one
another, nor must   children be beaten, lest sorrow be thereby
caused to Him whom God shall manifest.           Posts, and other
means of communication,     must be well organized,     "as in the
land of tho Frank,"     so that, as soon as the new "manifes
tation" takes place, there may be every facility for conveying
the news thereof     to all parts of the earth.       Many   other
instances might bo added, but             these   are sufficient.    Any one
who reads the Bey?n        will          find       Ho whom         God shall
manifest"  mentioned    on every          page, and again and again is
the hope expressed   that, when           He comes, He may not suffer
at the hands of unbelievers     as        the B?b has suffered. When
we consider all this, we shall better understand how almost
universal was the acceptance met with by Beh? amongst the
B?b?s when he announced     that he was   He whom God shall
manifest."

The third remarkable     feature of the Bey?n which I noticed
was the assurance with which the B?b speaks of the ultimate

prevalence   of his religion.    When    we picture    to ourselves
the circumstances    in which     he was placed, a prisoner and
exile amongst foes, in continual expectation       of the inevitable
fate which          over    him, and with               a friend to

hung                            scarcely
support and encourage      him, we cannot but admire the calm

conviction with which he writes of the final triumph of his
faith, and the confidence wherewith   he organizes   the model
whereon   the B?b? empires of the future are to be moulded.
There is not a word of compromise      on the one hand, nor a
trace of rancour or desire for revenge on the other.    Infidels
are to be allowed no part nor lot in the future government                       ;

are not even to be permitted              to reside in the five holy
> they
provinces   of F?rs       (the Land       of Pa),        'Irak (the Band of

*Ayn), Azarbaij?n     (the  Land    of Alif),     Khur?s?n        (the Land of
Kli?),   and M?zandar?n         (the Land     of Mini),      nor   in  any other
country   whose    inhabitants    are  believers     in    the  Bey?n, unless

or   others   who     follow   a   useful
they be merchants,                                                   profession.
Every effort is to be made to convert                them to the faith, but
no violence is to be used, and "no one is to be slain for unbelief,

for   the slaying of a soul is outside the religion of God; . . . and

> if any one commands it, he is not and has not been of the Bey?n,
and no sin can be greater for him than this."

Much    more might            be written  on the Bey?n, but I must at
present    necessarily            content  myself  with sketching    its most

important features.               It would be interesting   to trace out in
> detail the Utopia which       the B?b had conceived      in his mind.
Briefly,   the   future B?b?   community     was  to be  one   charac

> terized by brotherly      love ; dignity   combined with courtesy
> in all dealings    and transactions    between its members     ; culti
> vation of all useful arts and improvements;           prohibition      of
> useless occupations      and studies,     amongst  which    latter   aro
> included Logic, Jurisprudence       (Fikh), Philosophy,     and Dead
Languages     ; amelioration    of  the  condition   of  women, who
were to be allowed      to appear in society ; general     elementary
education   ; provision   for the poor out of the common treasury
at the discretion    of the members     of the House of Justice

(Bcyiu'l-'Adf),      but strict prohibition           of mendicity.          The
object     of   forbidding      the    study    of  philosophy,      logic, etc.,
seems to have been                the prevention        of disputation         and
wrangling,        which     are    strongly     condemned,      as   destructive
of that harmony which it is desired to secure.                     Pilgrimages
are not much                                          in the case of women,

encouraged,       particularly
and travelling        is restricted.      Children    are to be treated with
kindness       and affection, and allowed          to play and enjoy them
selves as much           as possible,      and penalties     are imposed on
any   one   who      shall   beat    them   severely.     They are not to be
made     to   6tand   at   their lessons, lest they should be fatigued,

but    are    to   be   allowed       to    sit    on      chairs,    which      it   is   recom

mended          that all      believers            should       do    rather     than       on      tho

ground.

Amongst     many such ordinances which      suggest    to us the
> idea that the B?b had in some degree     taken European       civil
> ization as his model, wo find others which          recall rather
> the pomp and ccremoii}' of the religions    of tho Past.      This
> is especially  tho case with regard to tho instructions         laid
> down        for the enshrouding     and burial                       of   the dead.      These
are       to bo washed    first three or five                        times    with     Avater in

a    certain     definite

manner,      and with    certain       prayers  and
; then, if possible,   with rose  water.       A cornelian
ejaculations
ring,   on  which    one  of the Names       of God is         engraved,   is
then to be placed on one of the fingers of the                 right  hand   ;
after which        thecorpse is to be shrouded with          five garments
of   different   stuffs, beginning       with    silk and ending with
cotton.    During      all  these   operations,    the utmost reverence
is to be observed in moving         and turning the corpse, for      the
outward body is the throne ('arsh) of the inward or essential
body (jasad-i-b?tini, jasnd-i zat?), therefore must           the former
bo preserved     with      tho utmost      care,  that no   disgust may
come upon the latter;            for the Essential                     its

body regards
Throne,    and is gratified     if that be treated with      respect."
These   preliminaries     completed,     the body   is to be placed

in a coffin or sarcophagus        of glass or crystal   (bailar),    or
hard polished     stone.    Public    prayers  are then   to  be   per
formed over the dead, and this is the only occasion when
are permitted.          other times people must

At                          perform
they
their prayers  singly.    And now comes the strangest            regu
lation of all, which    is that the confession      of faith of the
dead man, and his belief       in the    Divine Point       (Nukta-i
ll?hiyy?)   and  the  "Letters      of the  Living"     (Ilur?f?t-i
Ilayy),   with  a declaration     of his love for them, and an
account    of his actions,      shall be written         and preserved       by
his heirs till the coming of Him whom God shall manifest."
Can we read these instructions            without      being reminded        on
the   one   hand    of  the   Zoroastrian      dislike    of  polluting     the
earth by the burial of corpses, and on the other of the
Book of the Dead          of the Egyptians        ?

If we seek for traces of Zoroastrian               ideas in the Bey?n,
we shall not fail to find other instances, such as the formal
establishment     of a solar instead of a lunar year ; the com
mand     to observe tho Nawriiz        as the great annual feast;           the
command       to wash by pouring          water     over    oneself,   not   by

into  the water;      the   salutation     of the Sun on first
plunging
beholding      it on Friday      mornings       by reciting        the verse,
"                                 on thine aspect is only from

The Brightness       (Beh?)                                              God,
O rising Sun / and bear witness unto that Which God hath

VOL. XXI.?(NEW        8EIU1?8.]   60

witnessed    concerning Himself,  that there is no God but Him,
the Precious,   the Beloved."

The parts of the Bey?n        and, generally   speaking,    of the
B?b? doctrine, which are least readily understood,         are   those
which     treat of the future life.   All the Muhammadan          con

ceptions of the Questioning     of the Tomb,   the Resurrection,
the Bridge   of Sir?t, Hell,     and Heaven,    are allegorically

interpreted.  The first   is the  summons  of the  next Manifes
tation to those who are spiritually dead to believe      in Him                ;
the second is His appearing, or arising (Kiy?mat)     ; the thirdt

the "Bridge which    is finer than a hair and sharper than a
sword to the unbelievers,    but to the believers more spacious
than Paradise,"          is belief in the Prophet      of the Age, which

is so difficult   to the self-willed     and obstinate,   so easy to those
who     are really        seeking   after  God.   Tho    Fire   of Hell    is

ignorance,      denial,     and   negation.    Paradise     is tho  joy  of
believing       in and meeting       the Manifestation       of God, and

attaining     to  the  utmost   perfection    of which    one is capable.
Hence      the perfection   of anything     is described   as the Paradise
thereof, as, for instance, in the following passage from V?hid
iv. chapter xi. : God, at the time of the revelation of the
Bey?n,    looked at all His creation, and established limits for His

creation in whatever station they may stand, so that no soul may
be in the least grieved or distressed in theParadise   of theBey?n,
but rather He      has ordained that everything should be capable

(of this), that  they should bring that thing to the summit of its
perfection,  so  that it may not be deprived of its Paradise."    As
an instance of what         is meant, it is further stated that the
Paradise    of a text is that it should be written       in the most
excellent    writing,   and adorned with gold.

When       we come to inquire what             the B?b believed        and
taught    about     the  life after  death,   we  find   it hard   to give a
satisfactory     answer.     We     have    seen  that   ho   speaks of an
"                  or "Inner Body," which

Essential"                                        survives tho death of
the elementary   body, so that it is clear that ho believed   in
some sort of future lile; but he does not seem to care to
dwell on it, and in one passage      says, in speaking   of the
"Barzakh"      (generally understood   by tho  Muhammadans

somewhat    in the sense of the Greek Hades1),         "What     is
intended by Barzakh   is merely the interval between two manifes
tations, and not that (explanation) which is (commonly) known
amongst men . . .; for none knowefh what shall be decreed unto
them after death except God."                  In another passage he speaks
of that Paradise which consists                 in a knowledge  of the Mani
festation of God, and the Letters of the One as more glorious

than a sensuous Paradise,    wherein    are " silken garments, and
gold vessels, and excellent meats, and pitre wine, and mansions,
and hurls"      It is evident   that tho B?b wishes his follower*
to worship God from love of Him, and not in the hope of
reward, as he says in V?hid        vii. chapter xix.,    So worship
God that if the recompense of thy worship of Hint were to be

the Fire, no alteration in thy worship ofHim would be produced.
If you worship from fear,      that is unworthy of the threshold of

the holiness of God, nor wilt thou be accounted a Unitarian.
So also, if your gaze is on Paradise,    and if you worship in hope

of that ; for     then you have made God's               creation   a Partner       with
Him."

Certain      passages   in the Bey?n would tempt us to imagine
> that the transmigration          of souls formed a part of the Bab's
> belief and teaching,         as would certain modes          of expression
> often employed by the B?b?s.            Yet if you ask them whether

> they believe in metempsychosis            (lan?suk/i-i-arw?h),      they will
> answer in the negative,         and declare that the doctrine,        though
> superficially    resembling       this, is in reality otherwise          ; but
> that   it cannot    easily    be  understood    except by      those   skilled
in philosophy.

In the face of this it seems presumptuous  to attempt  to put
forward an explanation       of what appears to  me   to be tho

inasmuch    as the
> doctrino  really  taught by the B?b, yet,
> subject is too important   to be passed over, I feel bound to
> state the opinion I have been led to form on it from a careful
consideration      of      the   various                            on    the   matter

passages      bearing
in the Bey?n,                                    that    I do not       presume         to

only premising
on this point.

Koran,   p. 261, note.

First   of all, I must mako a distinction       between   "Indi
viduality"     and   "Personality."      The   former   is tho  real,
essential,   and permanent       part of a man ; the latter, the
temporary peculiarities     which    condition him in a particular
state.      To make the meaning                   of this clearer, let us take the
favourite     B?b? metaphor   of                 the "Letters."    Tho    forms of
these     exist     in the mind             in unseen    types which    cannot   be
destroyed.    They likewise                  have endless external      manifesta
tions," which are transitory and perishable,       and which show
forth more or less clearly       their original    archetype.   For

> instance, the essential character    of tho letter Alif, whereby
> it is known and individualized,      is a straight vertical  stroke
of the height of five dots {nuktas).     This form can be written
again  and again, mpre or less perfectly.        When        it is written
quite   perfectly,   it completely     corresponds      with     its ideal
archetype,    and  this is its Paradise.     Particular    written alifs
may be destroyed, but only their "personality"              is destroyed;

their individuality     returns   to the archetypal Alif,      and their
essential   part  will    manifest    itself again   and   again    in the
world of writing       (tho  External   World)    as occasion    requires.
It is in this sense that one may pick out all tho alifs in a
page of writing and say that they are the same letter : they
are the same as regards          individuality,    but different   in their
accidental   conditions,     such as size, position, and perfection       of
form.     It is the same with men.            Just as we may write an
alif on a piece of paper, and then tear it up and destroy it,
and write another, and say,            Alif has been written       again,"

"                    "                                "
or     has returned ;          so also we may        say,                has

Huseyn
returned    in Mir,  ?   'Ali Muhammad,"         for both  are  manifesta
tions in different mazhars         (places of manifestation)       of tho
same     Divine          Letter."

This,    think, is the real sense of passages
I                                           like the 6th
Chapter  of  the  first  V?hid,    where    it is written,    Huseyn   has
returned to the life of the world with all who believed in him,"
or like the following        passage    from V?hid       iv. chapter v. :
"       who    hold                  and                          over the
Those                 ta'ziyasl          weep and      lament
1 Ta'zn/fis    are the                       of the adventures   and misfortuues     of the

representations
Imams,     etc., held during the mouth       of Muharram,    and especially duriug    tho lirst

misfortunes     of the first promulgators         of Islam,      nevertheless

> imprisoned and oppressed that same person whom they lament,
and the learned gave decisions (fatvds) against him."

It is this manner        of speaking which         has led the Mu
hammadan8        to assert     that the B?b?s         believed     in trans
migration,   and    that   tho  reason          met    death   so fearlessly
was their conviction        that after forty days they would come
to life again.1

I must now conclude         this necessarily     imperfect considera
tion of the doctrine of the B?b to pass on to the subsequent
developments      of it by Beh? and others.          I do so with regret,

for who can fail to be attracted             by    the   genllo    spirit of
M?rz?       'Ali Muhammad?        His sorrowful and persecuted    life ;
his purity        of conduct, and youth ; his courage and uncom
plaining         patience   under misfortune;      his complete   self
negation        ; the  dim  ideal  of a better state  of things which
can bo discerned                  the            obscure      and mystic   utterances

through
of the Bey?n      ; but most of                 all his      tragic death,  all serve
to enlist our sympathies          on              behalf     of the young prophet
of Sh?r?z.     The     irresistible               charm      which   won him such
devotion   during    his life still     lives on, and still continues

to influence the minds of the Persian people.              The majority
of the B?b?s of to-day may regard Beh?                  as " Him whom
God     shall manifest,"     and M?rz?        'Ali Muhammad       merely
as his forerunner     ; yet   it is with                        that they

loving    thoughts
dwell on the memory          of the latter.       Often    they apply    to
him these lines    from   an  old Persian     song :2
ten days thereof, by the Shi'?tes.
They
reach their culminating        point in the

and
tragedy of the death of Huseyn              and his adherents,        cut off from water,
hemmed       iu by focs ou the arid plain of Kerbelu.               My guide from B?lfur?sh
to the Tomb         of Sheykh Tubnrsi        informed mc that, following          out the parallel

to those places where
suggested by the Bub, his followers, who make pilgrimages
the earliest sufferings of the Biibis took place, call the river Babul, which flows

through Halfur?sh,           tho "Euphrates,"      and Sheykh Tabars?          "Kerbel?."       In
tho samo spirit aro the following            lines, which     form tho concluding       stanza of a
B?ib? poem of the authorship          of which I am uncertain        :
"                                          !           Jii-duvid                           !

Y/c who have seen my form of flaino!                liaste to the land from whence I came !

with lips like sugar ;
I am afraid        that by     the disturbance        of his   lips he may

throw Baghdad         into confusion."

Or, by a slight modification      of a couplet of the poet 'Iraki,
they will express   their sense of the injustice of the sentence
of death pronounced    and carried out against their hero :
Dar kud?m mazhab-ast      in ? dar kud?m inillat-ast in ?

'                         "
Ki kushand dilbarl-rd ki,       /// dilrub? chira*i V

a charmer of hearts
That      they should kill              '"

(saying),   Why
art thou a stealer of hearts P

Turning      from the B?b,    there is another figure amongst
those who    took part in this sad drama which            irresistibly
commands our attention.        I mean     the beautiful   and accom

plished KurratuT-'Ayn,      the heroine, poetess, nay, almost the

prophetess,    of the   new  faith, distinguished      by the title of
"                                           the           Anxious       as

Jcn?b-i-T?hir?,"     "Her Excellence          Pure."
I was to obtain some of her poems, I only met with               a  very

limited     amount      of success.     None       of   the B?b?s    at Sh?r?z
whom       I conversed     had any in their possession,

with                               and they
said that Kazvin      and Ilamad?n, where Kurratu'l-'Ayn           had

and Teher?n,  where    she had   suffered   martyrdom,
preached,
would be the most likely places to obtain them. However,

at Yezd    I saw copies of two short poems          (ghazals)   attri
buted to her authorship.        Both of these are in the same

sanio rhyme ; and of each of
metre    (k?mil), and have the

> them I obtained a copy for myself.         I wrote to one of my

He replied that one of them, beginning
"                                                           :

was not                         but by a Sufi poet called Suhbat,

by Kurratu'l-'Ayn,
of Lar.   Although      I have on several occasions      heard   the
latter spoken of by dervishes      and others iu Persia with     the
highest approbation,     I have neither     been able to obtain his
works,  nor  to discover    any particulars    about him ; for he is

not mentioned   in any of the Biographies   of Poets (Tazkir?s)
which    I have been able to consult, not even in the Riydzu'l

> 'A'rifln of the learned Riz?-Kul? Khan,    published  a year or
two ago at Teher?n.

> The second poem attributed       to Kurratu'l-'Ayn,    beginning,

Jadhab?tu    shawkika aljamat bi-sal?sili'l-gham    wa'1-bal?
Hama     '?shik?n-i-shikast?-dil, ki di hand jan bi-rah-i-wal?,"

was

thought by ray friend, and pronounced with certainty by
others, to be undoubtedly    the work of Kurratu'l-'Ayn.

In a small work on Persian        grammar   called Tanbihul
Atfdl,  composed    by H?j? M?rz?     Huseyn    Khan,     Persian
Consul  at Trebizonde,   and printed at Constantinople      in a.h.

1298 (a.d. 1881), the first verse of the first of these two
poems, which    I have quoted above, is cited as an example,
and its author is stated to be the above-mentioned         Suhbat

(Mulla Muhammad       B?kir) of Lar.  Further   on   in the  same
work     a verse              in the second poem         is quoted, and

occurring
attributed   to M?rz?      'Abdu'l-Kar?m,    whose       takhallus   was
8?m?.   Although     these   poems, especially   the    first, can  only
bo referred very doubtfully       to the authorship      of Kurratu'l

'Ayn, it must     be borne     in mind      that the odium which
attaches   to the name of B?b? amongst                Persian Muham
madans would       render impossible      the recitation     by them of
verses confessedly    composed by      her.     If, therefore, she were
actually   the  authoress    of  poems,     the  grace and beauty      of
which    compelled    an  involuntary     admiration      even from her
enemies, it would seem extremely          probable      that they should
6eek to justify     their right    to admire       them by attributing

them to some other writer, and this view is supported by an
assertion which      I have heard made by a learned Persian
with whom I      was   acquainted    in Teher?n,       and who, though
not actually     a B?b?,    did not      lack a certain       amount   of

sympathy for those who wero such, to tho eiFect that many
poems written by Kurratu'l-'Ayn         were amongst the favourite
6ong8   of the  people,  who were    for  the most part unaware of

their authorship.      Open allusions   to  the B?b had, of course,
been cut out or altered, so that no one could tell the source
from    whence             came.
'Without pretending         to assert                then, that either

positively,
of these two poems is by Kurratu'l-'Ayn,             I venture to give a
translation      of the second of them, which         I have attempted
to versify     in imitation   of the original metre, 6o as to afford
a better     idea of its style than could be given by a literal
rendering       in prose.   In this I have endeavoured          to adhere
as closely as possible         to the sense of the original,         even
though      the English     may     have suffered      thereby.   I have
chosen the second rather than the first poem, because there

is a stronger consensus of opinion in favour of its being the
work of Kurratu'l-'Ayn.       Tho text of tho poem will be
found appended at the end of the paper.

pagans of Tartary.

With      you who contemn both love and wine             for the hermit's

cell and the zealot's shrine,
What       can I do ? for our faith divine         you   hold as a thing

of infamy P
The   tangled curls of thy darling's   hair, and thy saddle

and steed are thy only care,
In thy heart the Absolute   hath no share, nor the thought

of the poor man's poverty.
Sikandar's   pomp and display     be thine,  the Kalandar's

habit and way bo mine,
That,      if it please thee, I resign,   while     this,   though     bad,

is enough for me.
The   country of "I"    and "We"   forsake; thy home in

Annihilation make,
Since fearing not this step to take, thou shalt gain the

highest   Felicity.

Besides    these poems, I have a copy of a Masnavi              of about
570 couplets in the same metre as the Masnavi           of        Jalalu'd
Din R?m?        (Ramal4-musaddas-i-mahzitf)   attributed           to Kur

That  this latter is a B?b? poem I              have      no

doubt, but I have not yet had time to examine      it carefully
with a view to determining     whether   it may not be a later
production   in praise of Beh?   rather  than the B?b.      For
this reason, and also  on account of its length, I leave   it for
future consideration.

One more document       of great   interest which       belongs    to
this earlier period of B?b? ism deserves notice, since it affords
us an insight      into the limitless  self-sacrifice     and devotion
which     is so remarkable   in the disciples     of tho B?b.       It is
a letter written     by Ak?   Muhammad         'Ali   of Tabriz   to  his
elder brother on the night before he suffered death with his
Master,    and the text of it has been preserved         for us by the
B?b? historian,     and will be found appended           at the end of
the paper.     It appears that the relatives of ?k? Muhammad

'Ali occupied a good position   in Tabriz, and as they did not
believe   in the B?b? doctrines,   they were extremely   anxious
to persuade him to save himself     from death by a recantation.

This  letter, of which I here givo a translation,  seems to have
been written    in answer to a last appeal of this sort from the
brother of the writer.    It runs as follows :

"He       is   the   Compassionate.

0  thou who art my Kibla!1       My condition,    thanks to God,
has no fault, and ' to every difficulty  succeedeth ease/    You
have written    that this matter    has no end. What      matter,
then, has any end? We,      at least, have no discontent        in
this matter; nay, rather we are unable  sufficiently to  express
our thanks for this favour.  The end of this matter      is to be
slain in the way of God, and 0!     what happiness      is  this!
The    will    of God will     come    to pass with               to his

What     God wills comes to pass, and there is no power and

strength,

'                                     If

bath decreed overtake me, then God is tho guardian of my

family, and thou art mine         executor:    behave     in such wise

to the respect duo from

from all those of my household,    and commit me to God.

This letter, which       bears every mark      of genuineness,

us as much
attracts                 by   its simplicity of style and lack of
those epistolary      ornaments      to which we are accustomed,
as by the spirit of courage and resignation which breathes
in every line.      I, for my part, cannot read it unmoved;        for
1 feel myself    face to face with one whose unwavering        faith
has robbed death of its terrors, and whose care is less for
himself      than     for     the helpless      little ^ones he       leaves    behind.

Firstly,   there are the writings       of M?rz? Yahy?       (Hazrat-i
FjZcI), which might      be further divided         into those written     in
Baghdad      before  Beh?     put   forward    his    claim,    while  their

> author still enjoyed the undivided       allegiance      of all the B?b?s,
> and those composed       subsequently     to  the    schism, in Cyprus.

Considering      tho very   limited    number      of   these writings    at
present available,       it seems unnecessary         to observe    this dis
tinction,   and   I  shall   therefore    include   them   all in  one  class.
Secondly,    there   are   the writings     of  Beh?    during    the  period
which     preceded his claim to supremacy;              and thirdly, those
of that which       succeeded      it. The first and second of these

we                 "

classes, which           may call        writings    of the Interval,"         I
shall consider          here,    leaving     the third class       till the end.

I. Writings          of M?rz?    Yahy?         (Ilazrat-i-Ezcl).
These need not detain us long.        I have already stated that
I met very few Ezelis     in Persia,     and that I was unable to
obtain any of M?rz? Yahy?'s        works, which        are of course
accounted as worse than worthless        by  the Beb?'?s, i.e. by the
vast majority  of the B?b?s.    Gobineau       says (op. cit. p. 312),
"                              "                           "
His Highness    the Eternal      (i.e. Hazrat    i-Ezel)    has also

a   certain      number      of   works;                       these,   that
composed                                                        amongst
which    is most appreciated     by the B?b?s is the Book of Light."
Although       I  several  times  heard mention      of this " Book of
Light"      (Idtabu*n-Nur)    amongst    the B?b?s, I never succeeded

in seeing it, or obtaining      any  information   about its contents.

The lacuna thus left in my knowledge           caused me much regret
until recentty, when my attention was drawn to an excellent

article in the Journal Asiatique   for 1887 (viii. s?rie, vol. x),
by  M.  Clement   Huart, which   contains a description   of three
B?b? MSS. which had come under the writer's observation.

The    first        of     these M.     Huart         identifies    with    the   "Book
of Light"             described  by Gobineau,                   and      indeed   the   title of
it, which            he  quotes, Beems to establish    this identity with
certainty.             There appears, however,  to  be some discrepancy
between             the size of this small MS. of 63 pages each com
prising    19 lines, and that of the thick folio work described
as the " Book of                  by Gobineau.        It is unfortunate

Light
that M. Huart         subsequently     terms    this   same work     tho

Kur'?n     of the B?b," and describes        it as the "fundamental
work of the new doctrine, concerning            which     its author said
to the 'ulani? of Sh?r?z,       Take my Kur'?n,         and compare it
with that of your prophet, and you will be convinced                 that
mine    is more eloquently      written    than yours, and that my
belief   is preferable     to the religion    of Muhammad.'"         For
first of all, the term "Kur'?n              of the B?b,"        or "B?b?
Kur'?n,"l    is open to objection.     It is only used loosely in
the sense of "the sacred book of the B?b?s,"     just

as we might
> call one of them the     B?b? Bible."     For each one of them
> the B?bis     have a special name:             Bey?n,        ?k?n, or Lawh-i
Akdas,    etc.,    as   the   case  may     be  ;   it   is          the Muham

only
madans,    who      do   not   know     one  from      the  other    and have no
knowledge       of    their   contents,   who     call    them    gcnerically    tho

Kur'?n     of the B?b?s."            Furthermore,          tho   indiscriminate
manner     in which         this term is applied to any of the B?b?
books of doctrine has resulted in no little confusion.                        Thus,
for     instance,          the           of   the                            on   the   S?ra-i

copy                    Commentary
Y?suf"      in the British Museum       is lettered "B?b? Kur'?n,"
while   a work which       appears to be one of the two Arabic
Bey?ns     is described   by Dorn by the same title.         To apply

this name     to the "Book       of Light"      also, is to increaso
unneecssarity     this confusion.    Secondly,     the latter was not

was
composed by the B?b at all, nor, so far as wo know,

it put forward by its author, who is clearly proved by M.
Huart    to be M?rz? Yahy?,     as a rival to the Kur'?n    ; neither

is it at all likely that M?rz? Yahy?        visited Sh?r?z at any
period    of his life.     M. Huart,     however,   corrects Dorn's

and identifies                                    as one
mistake,                     the work described     by him
of the Bey?ns.1

The   second work                  described        by M. Huart      comprises  26
chapters        called     Rith

(spirit),                    each of which, with      the ex
> ception of the 22nd and 24th,                       has a special title. M. Huart
shows that these too are the work of Hazrat-i-Ezel.

The third volume     contains  a number of letters             (a?wait)

Explanation       of Justice"),    and ShajaratiCWAma,      which M.
Huart    translates     "Tho Tree of Blindness"        (" If Arbre de
Vaveuglement"),       but which I should rather render by "The
tree of the (Divine) Mystery."2         I would merely   suggest as a
conjecture     that all these terms may indicate the same person,
viz. Ilazrat-i-Ezel,3     just as the B?b has several titles such as

Nukta-i-U'l?,            Ilazrat-i-A'l?,             etc.     It   is   true
Nukta-i-Bey?n,
that all the          "letters       of the Living"                  enjoyed      similar      titles,

did not behold him because         their eyes were not fit to look
upon him.       And when   it fell out that the Sublime State (the
Ottoman      Government)    and the Stato of the Sh?h       (Persia)
agreed     to expel them from Baghdad,       and the Government
transferred      them to Adrianople,    Subh-i-Ezel     came forth and
showed     himself   unto men, exercising       the authority    of vice
gerency,      and inviting  (men)  unto   the             of his master,

religion
the Seyyid         'Ali     (Muhammad,         i.e. tho B?b).        And     his
brother     envied him, and repudiated him, and asserted                    that
be was Antichrist,         and a schism occurred between             them, and

Ezelis/     and  the   latter     Beh?'?s,'   while    'B?b?s'
is a term for both           in common.           And    after a while      the
Sublime      State      (the  Ottoman      Government)         perceived    evil
designs    in them, and detected mischief                           them, so it

amongst
exiled Subh-i-Ezel         to the island of Cyprus, and there he died.1
And Beh? it exiled to 'Akk? (Acre), where he is now, with a
number of his followers."

This   account  entirely agrees with what I have heard from
the B?b?s        of

the relative    positions    of Beh?    and Ezel      at
Baghdad.      Tho    latter remained     for  the most   part  secluded
from the eyes of men, while           the business     of interviewing
disciples  and inquirers and carrying on correspondence             with
the B?b?s      in Persia    was   chiefly    undertaken      by Beh?,
although    at this time he acted merely          on behalf of Ezel.
Indeed,   it would appear that even at this time be was re
garded by the enemies of the B?b?s as the chief of the sect,

is no doubt.    This is the F kan (Assurance)                       of which

it is unnecessary     for me    to   speak   more    fully   at    present,
firstly because I included the general purport of its argument

in a former paragraph         while    discussing     tho work        called
Dahi'il-hSab'a      (The  Seven   Proofs)    ; secondly,   because     Baron

Posen    has already published       a detailed    account of it, with
copious extracts,   to which I refer those who desire         fuller

information.1    Beyond    repeating   that  it   is composed     iu
Persian,    and is eagerly  read   and highly    esteemed   by   the
B?b?s, I will only notico tho following points about it :?

(1) Except    a small tract in Persian     called Muduniyyat

(Civilization),     which     does not deal directly    with    religious

the F  kan   is, so far as I am aware,   the   only one of
questions,
their books which the B?b?s have published.               It was litho

I think in India, and much          care was bestowed
graphed,
on its execution.          It is not sold openly,     all copies being

Manuscripts   of   the work   are also   commonly  met    with    ;
Baron   Rosen   stutes that he possesses   a copy, besides    the
one which exists in the Library    of the Institut des Langues
Orientales at St. Petersburg  ; another is to bo found amongst

the MSS. of the British Museum,      numbered Or. 3116 ; and

succeeded    in obtaining   in Persia was a MS     of this work.
Almost   every  B?b?   who possesses any books  at all has a copy
of it, and from its pages their arguments      are for the most
part drawn.

wretches         have

read the Kur'?n     every morning,  and have not
yet            to

attained  a single   letter of  the purport thereof."    It
will be remembered      that the B?b is very fond of dating not
from the hijra, but from the bi'sat (mission) of Muhammad,1
which he places ten years earlier ; and this fact might make
us uncertain whether     the same method may not be employed
in this passage, and the year a.h. 1268 (a.d. 1852) be in
tended rather than the year a.h. 1278 (a.d. 1861-62).          We
have, however,  no reason for supposing     that Beh? imitated

the B?b in this ; and since a.h. 1268 was the year of the
attempt on the Shah's life, and the great persecution   of the
B?b?s which resulted therefrom, and since, moreover,   during

the last three or four months   of it, Beh? was confined     in
prison at Teher?n,    and the exodus                        of   the B?b?s        from Persia
to Baghdad   did   not  occur till a.h    1269 (a.d. 1853), while

in the I'k&n Baghdad     is referred  to in at least two passages
as                               of the chief of the sect, it seems
being the head-quarters

certain that it was in a.h. 1278, and not in a.h. 1208,
quite
that      the   latter   work       was

composed.
(3) The conclusion   of the book is important        as casting
a certain amount of light on the relations         of its author,
Beh?, with other members       of the sect at this period.      Six

when he was 37 years old, i.e. in a.h.            1270 (since he was born in a.h.   1233), and
that when he was 38 years old (i.e. in a.h. 1271 =A D. 18*34-55) he " withdrew

seeking    to destroy him, while assistance and sympathy were
withheld    by those from whom he had the best right to expect
such, he adds that, were it not that he is not only ready but
anxious    to yield up his life "in         the way of the Nukta"

(i.e. the B?b),   he  would    assuredly    not remain    in Baghdad
for a single moment.         Although      these  details which   Beh?

idea of his position at the time he wrote      it, which    is the
more valuable because    we know                 the date   of  its

precisely
composition.   To recapitulate  briefly    tho most     important
facts which wo learn from them : Beh? at this time admitted
the   supremacy     of Ezel,   and arrogated      to himself    no supe

riority  over  his   comrades,   but   at the  same   time   he   appears
to have aroused the envy and hostility          of some of the latter,
besides having attracted       tho special attention    of the enemies
of the   now   religion.     Tho    latter facts may suggest        to us
the question whether Beh? did not even at this time really
occupy a more prominent  position then his own words would
seem to imply;     while the repeated   exhortation  to the
"people of the Bey?n" not                  to reject the promised Mustagh?s
when he appeared renders                    the supposition   that he already
contemplated                 the idea of putting   forward this claim himself
not wholly   improbable.

In the year a.h. 1283 (a.d. 1866-67),            two years after the
transference of the B?b?s from                    to Adrianople,     Beh?,

Baghdad
then in his fiftieth year, openly declared his divine mission,
and called upon all the B?b?s,

including Ezel, to acknowledge
the same.      From    this point dates the schism which              to this
day    divides    tho B?b?s    into Beh?'?s    and   Ezelis,    and   hence

They consist        of numerous           letters and treatises, all, so far as I
know, of comparative                  brevity,    the longest and most      com

pleto being the Lawh-i-Akdas       which I shall discuss shortly.
All letters emanating    from Beh? are regarded          as revelations

by his followers, who carefully       preserve   and  diligently    copy
them.    In my last paper I described        how the B?b? couriers
visit Persia yearly,   bearing    with them a number            of these
alwdh (epistles) addressed    to believers    in the different towns.
To receive one of these, even of only a few lines, is accounted
a very great honour:      the favoured    recipient  exhibits   the

treasured scrap of paper to his friends and co-religionists,
who, after kissing    it, and placing     their foreheads     on it,

proceed eagerly   to peruse   it, and, if  possible, obtain leave
from    the owner   to take a copy of it for themselves.                 The
number     of these alw?h   is therefore practically       unlimited,     and
collections of them frequently         occur amongst B?b? MSS.1

As these generally     consist only of a few words of encour
agement    and exhortation,     and as, without a knowledge            of the
circumstances     and   date    of    their    composition     and    of   the
persons    to whom    they    were      addressed    (which     knowledge
could scarcely be obtained otherwise           than by careful inquiries

amongst the B?b?s at Acre)         little can be deduced from them,
I shall at present limit myself         to a consideration      of a few of
the longer and moro important            treatises and epistles of Beh?,
and for the purpose of illustration          shall choose for discussion
the Lawh-i'Nasir,     which     appears       to be the earliest of his

writings     wherein  he distinctly    and uncompromisingly    puts
forward     his claims;    the  Alw?h-i-Sal?tin    (Letters of the

Kings),    wherein he summons       the rulers of various countries
to believe     iu him   and  accept his religion ; and the Lawh-i
Akdas, which,                    as it does in a codified form the

containing
of the new faith as revised and remodelled       by
prescriptions
Beh?,   is the most important of all.

1. The      Lawh-i-Nasir.'

This is an epistle of 73 pages of small size, addressed   to
some B?b? called Nasir, who appears to have been favourably

1 One such collection occurs in the British Museum MS. marked Or. 3114,    and
> another at the eud of Or. 3116, the first part of which contains the fkdu.

disposed     towards  Beh?, but to have had some difficulties            in

admitting     the  claims    then   recently   advanced    by the  latter.
These difficulties    he had apparently         set forth in a letter, to
which this is a reply.         A copy of this I obtained at Kirm?n
by   the advice   and   through the kindness        of some of my B?b?
friends   there,  who    considered     it  as an   important document
which I ought to possess.         I know of    no  other copy in Europe.
It is for     the most     part written     in Persian,    with occasional
passages      in   Arabic.      I   shall  confine   myself       to noticing
briefly   some    of  the  more                         in  it.

important points
After     the exordium,        the letter proper commences            thus :

Ky    Xa?r     ! Ey    'ahd-i-man   !"  "O   Nasir     ! O    my   servant."
This mode of address already marks a great change from tho

> tone adopted by Beh? in the l'k?n, where he declares that he
" never
sought supremacy over any one."                A little further
on he proceeds,         N?m?-i-tit      bi-makarr-i-kuds       r?rid amad,"

"Thy    letter arrived   at    tho Plac?    of  Holiness;"       and shortly

"                            va      ma-miir
> after he says,      B?b-i-fazl     mafl?h,         tit            bi-dukhiil"
> "The door of grace          is open, and thou art commanded                   to
> enter."

That                  addressed to one named Nasir

this letter was                                   appears
from the above, and two or three other passages where               the
name of Bella's                        is mentioned.    That    it was

correspondent
written   by  Beh?   is also  evident,    apart   from the style   and
substance of the document,       from two passages, one of which

the
begins, " "La fa-wa-nafsiya      9l-Behd!"      "No, by myself
Beh? !      and the other of which runs as follows:          Wa     law

> yak?mu     ahadun       'ala hubbi-'l-Beh?fi            ardid    'l-insh?       tea yuh?ribu
ma'altu     kulla   man                     wa's-semd                                  'll?hu

fi'l-ardhi                           la-yughlibuhu
> if any one understood       the love of Beh?     in the earth    of
> "And 'aleyhim idhh?ran li-kudratihi, wa ibr?zan li-saltanatihi,"
> creation,   and were to fight on his side against all who are
> in the earth and the heavens, God would verily make him
> victorious   over them, as a showing    forth of His power, and
a setting forth of His majesty."

That    the letter was composed after Beh? had jwt forward
his claim      is also manifest           not onty from tho passages I have

quoted,     but     from many           others, and indeed from the whole

TUE BABIS OF TERSIA.                                   951

tenour       of   the      letter.      That        it was written

shortly after this
is also evident from the strong opposition      to his claims by
the majority    of the   people    of the Bey?n    (i.e. the B?b?s)
of which Beh? complains,        and for which he censures     them,
which   opposition  appears    rapidly    to have subsided until his
rival, Ezel, only   retained   a mere     handful   of followers.   In

only   one  passage   is anything      approaching    a  definite date

given, and in it Beh? speaks thus :?"0          people of the Bey?n !
have you not considered      that for twenty years he"?(Beh?          is
here   speaking of himself     in the third person)?"    has stood up
by  himself   against   tho enemies?    Many    are  the nights when
all were sleeping at ease on their beds, while this Beauty         of
Primal    Unity     (Jemdl-uAhadiyyat)     was   standing up openly
against the unbelievers  (mnshrikin), and many the days when
the Beauty of Glory and Dignity      (Jem?l-i-'izz ? tamkin) was
evident and resplendent  and obvious amongst the unbelievers,
while ye kept yourselves  preserved    and concealed   in hiding
places, fearing for yourselves."         Now Beh? must have been
one of the first to believe         in the B?b : we learn from the
B?b? history that he was amongst            those who met the latter
at a place called Kh?nlik        near Teher?n    as he was being con

to Tabriz    from    Isfahan,  which   was   in the year a.h.
veyed

> 1263 (a.d. 1847).      As we have seen, Bella's         claim was put
> forward    in A.n. 1283       (a.d. 1866-67),    exactly twenty years
> later.   From    this we may fairly assume that the Lawh-i
Nasir was written        very soon after that event, probably        in

the same year, which        conclusion   agrees with the statement
made        to me by the B?b?s at Kir man.

It remains       for me to notice the nature                      of the claim      therein
sot forth, which                is of     the utmost       possible magnitude,    and
stated in the most             uncompromising             manner, though differently

in    different       passages.        These   differences,       however,
expressed
are only of aspect, depending          on the B?b? views concerning
the unity of the essential principle       which speaks through alt
the prophets.      Thus      in one passage Beh?        sa}\s,  Kull-i
kutub'i'Samavi                                 n?zil             "?"     I

another     placo ho "calls himself       Malik-i-Sifat,"       "The Lord
of the Attributes         (meaning      thereby    that   ho is  tho Divine
Essence made manifest),         and reproves those who are              veiled
by    the Names     from    the  Essence,                                   one

mentioning      especially
(probably   M?rz?  Yahy?,         Ilazrat-i-Ezel     ")  whom     he    calls

a Name amongst my Names,1 whom I created by a single
letter, and to whom I gave life b}r a single breath," and who
nevertheless     "arose   in war against"        his "Beauty."      In
other passages,    again, he declares that he is the Nukta-i-U'l?

("The First Point,"       i.e. the B?b) returned again, and this
manner of                he   carries so far as to talk of the execu

speaking
tion of tho B?b at Tabriz as one of his own experiences,            as
in the following    remarkable passage :
"It hath been witnessed         what an amount of cruelty and

was shown                                        none can

reckon     it but God : until at length                            my

they suspended

malice     and hatred,  until my spirit returned      to tho Supreme
Companion     (Rafik-i-A'ta),   and  gazed  on  the  Most   Beauteous
Garment     (Kamis-i~Ablui).     And   not one   reflected  wherefore

it was that I accepted this injury from my own servants, for,
had they reflected, they would not have remained veiled from
my Beauty     in my second manifestation       by reason of a Name
amongst        ni}r   Names."          Aguin,      in    another     passage,     he     says,

In tho Bey?n I admonished       all in the langungo of power."

Other similar sayings might be quoted, but I think these are
sufficient to establish this point.

Many valuable pieces of information        can be gleaned   from
this epistle,    since it is less formal and didactic  than Bella's

later writings.       Thus he quotes several passages    from the
B?b's     works,    and mentions     some of the latter by name,
distinctly    stating,   for example,    that the names Ahsami'l
JCisas and Kayy?m-i-Asm?                   apply        to the     same book.       As      the

which Baron Rosen      has pointed      out.1    This    same  passage
quoted   in tho l'k?n is also cited in the B?b? history,               as
I have mentioned    in referring    to it in a former part of this

paper.2   Some information   about persons who played a more
or less important part in helping or opposing   the B?b? cause,
such as Mulla    'AH Bist?m?   amongst  the former, and one of
tho Muhammadan        'ulam? called Muhammad     Hasan   Nnjaii
amongst      the latter,   is also given.       The    second    of these

as       "
individuals    is probably     tho  same        the    Sheykh     who     is
named      as Muhammad         before Hasan,"        against    whom       a
passage    in the Lawh-i-Akdas        is directed.    I must now leave
tho Lawh-i-Nasir,      which concludes with a warning             to Nasir
that one will shortly appear before him and try to turn his
heart from the love of Beh?, but that he is to               be sure that
he   is a dovil, even             if he     be    the    highest of men."   It is

that Beh?             here     alludes      to some Ezeli missionary
probable
who         was    engaged    in trying             to prevent   the B?b?s   froiu

accepting         Bella's claim and in consequence                  rejecting      Hazrat
i-Ezel.

In

my    last paper             I    alluded       to and       enumerated            the
Letters   sent by Beh?              to the Rulers           of   the chief       countries

in Europe and Western    Asia, and promised                         to describe    their
contents more fully on a future occasion.                           I regret, that the

length which the present article has already                         attained forbids
me from discussing     them as fully as the                         great    interest of

Taken    collectively,   theso   letters constitute   what     is known

thoso of tho Letter     to the Sh?h which I am about to describe,
render   this supposition difficult.

The   letter of which I possess a copy I have compared
with another copy in the British Museum          marked Or. 3115,
with which,     apart    from   a few  various readings,  it agrees.
It is partly in Arabic, partly in Persian,     and is characterized
by extreme moderation         of tone.   The blame of persecuting
the B?b?s is chiefly laid on the 'Ulam?, who, it is alleged,
have      instigated      and maintained              these

persecutions      by false
representations           to tho Sh?h.

Tho writer declares that he has
been   a loyal                                 obedient    to his
always                     subject of tho King,
commands, and desirous of his welfare,           in proof of which he
points out that since he was released from his imprisonment
at Teher?n      on the establishment      of his innocence          of any
complicity    in  the attempt    on  the Shah's     life  (which attempt
Beh?,   in all his writings     where ho alludes   to it, strongly

condemns),   no act  of  sedition  has  emanated from    the B?b?s,
and that this     submissiveness      on their part, contrasting

strongly with   their former conduct, is in great measure       due
to his    (the writer's)  influence.

as Baron Rosen observes, numerous grammatical            errors.     The
tone it adopts towards the Sh?h is one of fierce recrimination:

the writer,      after upbraiding   him for putting      the B?b        to
death, says,1 "And would that5rou had slain          him   as  men   slay
one another, but you slew him in such wise that the eyes of
men have not seen the like thereof, and Heaven               wept over
him, and the hearts of those near (to God) cried out. Was
he not the son of your Prophet,   and was not his relationship
to the Prophet    well known amongst you ? How         then did

do unto  him   that which none  of the  former ones have
you

rejoice in your places, and are of those who are joyful.    And
you curse those who were aforetime, who did the like of what
ye have done, while ye are careless of yourselves."       A few
sentences  further on the writer proceeds      to excuse,  if not
to approve, the attempt on the Shah's life as follows:?"And
when yo slew him, one from amongst         his friends arose in
retaliation,    and none knew him, and his purpose was con
cealed from whatever      hath life.  . . Then     it is not meet
that you should blame any one for this, but rather blamo
yourselves     for what you have done, if yo bo just."

The     fact that tho particulars   which  wo glean     from a
perusal of both letters correspond     in the main     is not a proof

> that their authors were identical, for the exodus from Teher?n
> to Baghdad,    and the proceedings      eventually    taken at the
> latter place   against  tho B?b?s    included      them    all alike.
Again,   if both letters had been written    by Beh?   at different

times, we should have expected    some   allusion to be made in
one of them to the former one, which        is not the case.     On
the contrary, Beh?, in the letter which                    is undoubtedly  his,
and which was written    from Adrianople                     after it had been
decided        by   the Turkish      Government         to send him to Acre,

particularly  says that he had not previously         appealed directly

to the Sh?h, but only to one of his ministers            named M?rz?

Sa'?d Khan?     He   also says  that   he   had  not   written or com
municated    with   any foreign     states.     This,    I think, con

clusively    proves  that the document         described  by Baron
Boseu     cannot have been written        before   the one which   is
included     in the Siira-i-Heykal,     supposing    Beh?  to be the
author of the former.        If wo could overlook the difference of

we              however,      suppose   tho     reverse   of   this,   viz.

style,          might,
that the letter in the Sura-i-Heykal          was first written,    and

that the change    in tone observable     in the  other  was    caused
by disappointment      or anger at the neglect shown to the pre

ceding missive.    But when wo recall tho fate which befell the
bearer of Bella's     letter to the Shall, which       is a matter    of

notoriety  in Persia,    this hypothesis  likewise appears difficult.
It was considered desirable      that this letter should be sent by

TUE BABIS OF TEltSIA.                                        957

a special messenger,       and on the announcement       of this, several
volunteers                forward,    from   tho  number    of whom       a

stopped
youthful    believer,    now   known     amongst    the B?b?s   as Badi'

the Wonderful,"       was selected.      Travelling    on foot from
Acre to Teher?n        he succeeded, on his arrival at the Persian
capital, in delivering      his letter to the Sh?h as the latter was
riding through       tho  streets, saying as he did so,        I bring a
command      (farm?n)      to you."     The Sh?h, thinking       that the
sense of awe produced           in him by the Royal Presence          had
bewildored       him     so that he did not know what he was

saying,
remarked,        "You      mean a petition."   "No," answered Badi',
" mean

I       what          I say : a command from one whose authority
is higher than yours."      When      the Sh?h uuderstood whence
the letter came, and who the writer was, he ordered Badi'            to
be put   to death, which   was   done by branding     him with red
hot bricks.     I have heard that as the executioners   were

lifting
up the bricks with iron tongs to apply them to his bodjr, he

"                                                          :
cried out,     It is not necessary   for you to trouble yourselves
I welcome death in such a cause," and, seizing the bricks in
his own hands, pressed them to his bosom.                 as this

Amazing
seems, it finds a parallel in the behaviour of Suleyrnau Khan
at his execution  in a.d. 1852.

Now   if Beh? had been, as I at first supposed, the author
of this second letter (quoted by Baron Rosen),     some allusion
would almost certainly have been made                             in it to so remarkable
an event.   No   such allusion  occurs                           in tho notice     of its
contents.       This                 to mo     almost       conclusive      evidence          that

appears
the second letter was not written     by Beh?.     In this case its
author must have been      one of the other B?b? chiefs, and the
first supposition which would naturally      occur to us would be
that it was composed by Ezel.         This view is supported     by
the fact that in another letter occurring       in the same collec
tion, which      is quoted  in part by Baron      Rosen,1 we find
these words : Asma'ii      nidaa   *llahi 'an hddhihi 'sh-shajarati
'l-mani'ati                         'l-mub?rakati

'l-murtafi'ati                              '/-ezeliyyati     'l-ahadiyya."

Hear      the voice of God from                 this      unapproachable,            lofty,
blessed,      eternal Tree of Unify."

1 Loe.   cil. p. 208.

Against     this view of the authorship      of                  the  letter is the
fact that the writer describes himself      l as "                  this servant who

is called lluseyn   in the Kingdom of names,"         in another   while
passage he says, "Say, O people, am I not                  the son   in truth
of 'Ali ? but I am named lluseyn                                    2

spiritual world
in the
of God the Protector,    the Mighty,   the Kind."      Inasmuch
as the name of Hazrat-i-Ezel    was Yahy?, not Httseyn,       these
passages would  conclusively  disprove   his authorship     of  the
document   in question    did it not seem possible       that the
meaning      of the passages quoted             is, not that the writer of

the letter  was    called lluseyn        in the actual world or "World
of Creation"          ('?lam-i-jilulk),        but that ho is so called

because        he   is  the successor         of the B?b,       as
spiritually,
lluseyn     was   of     'Ali.    A    passage      in  which     he  speaks of

the B?b,     not as 'Ali Muhammad,                  but as 'Ali? tends         to

strengthen     this  view, which,        for  the   rest,  is fully in keeping
with B?b? methods   of thought and expression.

To sum np the results of the foregoing       investigation,    it
appears probable  that  the  letter described  by Baron     Rosen
was written  not by Beh?,     but by one of the other B?b?
chiefs,   possibly    Ezel.
Having                  so much       space with        this discussion,    I

occupied
must     speak very briefly     of    the    points   which     have   not  been

in the letter of Bella's          which constitutes      a
already noticed

of  the Sura-i-Heykal.        It   is written     with   great humility
part
and moderation         ; the writer      speaks of himself           as " h?dh?

'l-maml?k"      ("this slave"),      and prays to God for help and

courage to address tho King.             Turning        then to the latter, he
declares     that those by      whom        he    is  surrounded,      and who
counsel him to act with            severity      against     the B?b?s, do so
from interested motives          :           have    no   real   attachment    to
their master,   whereas Beh?    sincerely   and earnestly desires
his welfare,   which   can only be secured by the exorcise of

towards all his subjects    alike, regardless  of their
justice

which event I believe             I am right in placing about the year
a.d. 1880, it must have been written                    at a much        later date
than most of        the   others    now    included     in  the  S?ra-i-IIeykal.
I must confine myself            to giving a translation of some of the
most interesting        passages.

O chief!       the letter begins,        "hear the voice of God, tho

is vivid and graphic        in its eloquence.       It concludes with

especially as regards fasting and the observance           of tho two

I   can                          for        a moment         to notice           one    further

Acre, as stated previously.

pointed out the difficulties      of regarding      the epistle described
by   Baron   Rosen    as  the  work    of  Beh?,    but it must be ad
mitted    that until another      letter is discovered which,      besides
being   addressed   to   the  Rulers    of Christian    countries,  corre

sponds more             closely in style with Bella's         writings,       considerable
uncertainty            on this point must remain.

3.     The'Lawh-i'Akdas9              (Most Holy         Tablet).
I now come to the most important of Bella's works, and
the last of which    I shall speak at length ; I mean       the
Lawh-i-Akdas,   wherein   his prescriptions aro  arranged   aud
codified.  Of this work I have three MSS.    in my possession,
two of which              I         at Shir?z,

obtained      and one at Kirm?n.

Another           copy, marked Or. 2820, is in the British Museum.
One of           the copies which  I possess was written   for me by
one of the B?b? missionaries                      of whom           I spoke     in my last
paper.           It    is well      and

carefully                  written      in a   good Naskh
handwriting,    and contains      146 pages, each of which, except
the first and last, comprises          11 lines. I should estimate
that the total number of words contained         in it is rather over
10,000.     I shall translate the first few lines, and then notice
the contents     in detail   in the order in which     they occur as
briefly as possible,  only                  translating     passages      which      appear
to mo of special interest.

It begins thus :

"                                                           over what         was    and     is.

In the Name               of Him who        ruleth

the first thing which God hath ordained           unto
"Verily
(His) servants      is the Knowledge     of the Dawning-place       of
His   revelation    and tho Rising-place      of His command, who
was the station of nimself          in the world of command        and
creation.1     Whosoever      attaineth    thereunto  hath   attained
unto  all good, and he who                      is deprived   (thereof)           is indeed
of the people of error, even                     though   he bringeth            all (good)

actions.       when ye have attained

And                      to this most glorious
station,       and

this most   lofty horizon, it behoveth    every one
to follow that whereunto     he is commanded    on the

part of
the (Supreme) Object, because these two (things) are together:
one of them will not be accepted without    the other.    This  is
what       the Rising-placeof Inspiration    hath decreed.    Verily
those who        are givenvision from God will       regard the or
dinances   of God as the greatest means         to the order of the
world and the preservation         of the nations,  and he who       is
careless is of tho vile and worthless."

Tho first prescription      given   concerns prayer,    which     is
ordained         three   timesa day, in the                     the afternoon

morning,
and      the   evening;          each

prayer      is  apparently      intended    to
consist     of three prostrations    (rik'a),    since  it is said that there
are to bo nine in all.      The worshipper    is to turn his face
towards     the Most Holy Region,       the Holy     Place, which
God hath made      the point round which     the Supreme     Con
course revolves, and that whereto     the denizens of the cities
of Permanence     advance, and that whence       issueth the com
mand    to whomsoever     is in the earths and the heavens."

By    this Acre   is apparently     intended,   for it is added that
"when      the Sun of Truth     and Exhortation      sets" (i.e. when
Beh? dies) the Kibla will be changed           to "that place which
we have appointed       unto you."       All  congregational    praj-er

is abolished   except  in  the   single ease of the prayers used
for the Burial     of the Dead.     The wearing of garments which
contain     tho hair of animals,      or which       are made        of their

or  have  buttons    of bone   or                         :  "

skins,                                     ivory,    is allowed         verily
it was not prohibited         in the Furk?n      (i.e. the Kur'?n),        but
it was misunderstood        by the divines."       In the case of those
who are on a journey the prayers are still further shortened,
a simple " Subh?na'll?h"           ("Glory     to God")                     for

sufficing
those    who    cannot  manage      more.     Further       directions      for
prayer are given,      into which I have not space to enter here.
Fasts    and Feasts     are next treated of. The

great festival
is the Persian          Nawr?z         (New Year's   Day) when      the Sun
enters      sign of Aries,
the                         and this is made the

beginning
of the B?b? year, which,                  as I have

already stated, consists

of 11)months         of

19 days each, to which five interculary days
> (Khainsa-i-mustaraka)      are added,   thus bringing    the total
> number of days in the year to 366.         The month   of fasting
> is that which    immediately  precedes the Nawr?z    ; in other
words,       last month of the B?b? year ; and the five inter

the
> calary days are inserted between it and the preceding month,
> and are commanded     to be observed by entertaining   relatives
> and friends       and     feeding      the poor.   The fast itself lasts from
> Bunrise    to sunset           daily during    the month  of 19 days, and is
> incumbent    upon              all except   the young,   the sick, the aged,
and the infirm.

These instructions                 are followed by a prohibition  of Murder,
Adultery,   Slandering                 and Backbiting,   after which    tho Law
of Inheritance     is laid down.   This   is too complicated   and
obscure to discuss in detail in this place : suffice it to say that
seven classes inherit, to wit, children, wives, fathers, mothers,
brothers, sisters, and teachers;   the share of each diminishing
from the first to the last.      In the absence of one or more
of these classes, the share which would belong to them goes

to the "House      of Justice"       (Beytu'l-'Adl),       to be expended
on the poor, the fatherless       and widows, or on useful public
works,     as shall be decided       by the members            thereof.     Tho
constitution   of this House of Justice,"            though     not  described
till further on in the Lawh-i-Akdas,            is best mentioned        here.

Tho number       of its members         is to be         according      to   tho
number of Beh?"        (which   will   be  eight    if  we   take   the  values
of    the        in that word, but perhaps

letters                               19 is intended),

though   it may    exceed   this.  In   every city there must be
one such " House      of Justice,"   the members   of which must

themselves    as the trustees and representatives   of God
regard
in the world, aud strive to fulfil for the public good the trust

in them.
placed

Places    of worship are to be built, and they must not con
tain any images or pictures.      Tho dead are to bo buried with
much     pomp    and   ceremony,    having been placed    in coffins
of stone    or hard wood.    Pilgrimages   to the "House"    (Beyt)
are    commanded           to    such      as   can       undertake         them,   but    women
are excused.          By        the       House           most        of   tho Babia      whom     I

asked     understood        the Bab's          house at Sh?r?z              in the K?ch?-i
Shish?-gar?n     (Glass-blowers                 Street).

Next    follows an absoluteprohibition  of mendicity  couched
in the following words: "The most hateful of mankind     before
God is he who sits and begs:    take hold of the rope of means,
relying on God, the Causer of causes."      Men   are forbidden
to kiss ono another's hands, or to ask pardon for one another

(from God):        those who           have      done wrong             must      repent   and
turn to God.

Those      who       claim         inward        knowledge    and pretend                   to
understand       Divine  mysteries                 are next censured.                        this

By
passage,     which  I have already                 quoted (p. 883), the Sufis

and
Philosophers     appear    to  be  intended.     Austerities      and   self
mortification    are forbidden,    and their uselessness      is exposed.

A statement       next follows    to the effect that any one who
claims to have a new Revelation           before the accomplishment
of a thousand years is a liar, and to make           this more unmis
takeable, it is added that no sort of explanation          or

interpreta
tion of this verse contrary         to its obvious meaning          is to be
attempted     or listened   to.1

A passage now comes which      is important as in some degree
fixing the  date when    the work   was                         of

composed.   Speaking
some event Beh?      says, "This    is what we informed you of

Tho kings of tho earth are then addressed and exhorted                  to
adopt     and  spread tho    new    faith.   The Emperor     of Germany

is reproved, apparently         because he had gone ou a pilgrimage

Turkey, personified   in  Constantinople, is also   addressed
thus: "O Point which     liest on the shore of the two Seas!
The throne of injustice hath been fixed in thee, and in thee

hath     been     kindled     the fire of hatred                   in such wise      that   the

Some of        the cities and provinces          of Persia    aro then
addressed.     Teher?n      is blessed because Beh? was born there,
> and comforted       thus : If He         (i.e. God) will, He will bless
> thy  throne  with     one  who     shall  rule with justice and gather

Wise,   the Encompasser."

Khur?s?n    is also comforted,                         and applauded           because        therein
are heard " the voices of men

commemorating      thy Lord, the
Rich,   the Exalted."     The faithful are enjoined not to oppose
> those that rule over them, but to        leave to them that which
> they have,"   and   address themselves     to gaining  the hearts of
men.

Kirm?n     is subsequently    addressed and sharply rebuked for
the pretensions    to spiritual knowledge    of 6ome of its people.

That this alludes to the Sheykhis,        who are, as before stated,
the followers     of H?j? Muhammad         Karim   Khan,   is pretty
certain,      especially

as the       latter     is held      up to execration               in a
later     passage.

Tithes of nineteen per cent, are decreed on all who possess
more      than a hundred     misk?ls       of gold.      Believers   are
exhorted not to withhold       these,   since   by giving     them their
wealth will be purified.

Here a digression     occurs, explaining         that this book was

revealed     because Beh?     had at dilieront        times received
letters from believers   asking    for   instructions   as to conduct,
etc., which were now epitomized                             so as to be accessible to all.
The learned are warned against                              criticizing it, or judging of

its style and contents according         to their limited horizons.

They    are  also challenged     to produce    the like of it with all

their learning, and are reminded that Beh? never studied the
sciences which they have learned, but that all his wisdom              is
received    from God.      All explanations       of the sacred text

sense thereof are again forbidden.
contrary to the obvious

Certain further regulations      concerning    personal cleanliness
follow.    The nails are to be cut and the body bathed at least
once      a week,            but      the   use     of     the    tanks        (Khazina)         in the

Persian   baths is forbidden,    because     tho water     in them is

not changed sufficiently    often   and  so   becomes  foul
generally
and offensive.   It is therefore    recommended        that  the body
should bo washed by pouring water over it rather than by

entering    the water.      Praying     in the streets        is forbidden,

as                of ostentation.       Festivals     are again
probably        savouring
spoken   of  and   are   limited  to  two   :  the  anniversaries     of the
"manifestations"       of Beh? and the B?b.            As we have seen
that the Nawruz        is the great festival of the B?b?s, and as
we know that the " manifestation               of the B?b occurred on
Jum?d?'ul-U'l?     5th,    a.h.  1260     (May 23rd, A.n. 1844),             it
seems probable that that of Beh?           was   on  the Nawr?z.

The contents of the next portion of the Lawh-i-Akdas,                    so
far as they can be classified,        refer mainly       to the B?b, and
certain modifications          of    the ordinances     laid down by him
which are considered           necessary.    By him      it was enacted that
whoever    possessed any object "the             like of which was not to
on earth   was to
be found                        give it to Him whom God shall
manifest    (Persian Bey?n,    V?hid     v. eh. 16) ; that useless
and especially dead languages      were    not to be studied (ibid.

iv. 10) ; and that all books   were   to be re-writ ten every 202

years, and tho originals    then destroyed    or given away (ibid.
vii. 1). All these commands       are abrogated by Beh?, and the

study of foreign languages for purposes of missionary       enter
prise    is commanded.     Some    quotations  from    tho  Bab's
writings    are introduced  to prove that Beh?    is really    He
whom God shall manifest,"      and some of the objections   raised

by the Ezelis

are met.   This portion concludes with praise
of the B?b,   and   those who  do not believe   in him are ex
horted at any rate not to condemn      him, because    the hosts
of the oppressors who assembled against him suffice."

Sheykh Muhammad         Hasan     (also referred to in the Lawh
i-Nasir)  is  held  up   to  reprobation.      The Bey?n     is again
spoken of,   and   those  who   believe    in  it are warned   not to
allow any passage therein to make          them doubt the truth of
Bella's   claim,   since   he

is the revealer of it, and learned all
Divine  Mysteries   before Creation existed.

Next    follow some passages which       seem to be addressed    to
Bella's  rival Subh-i-Ezel,    part of  which   I translate:  "Say,
0   rising-place     of opposition    ! Cease     (wilfully)      to close thine
eyes;     then   speak   of the  truth   amongst     the    people.    By God!
my     tears   flow   over  my    cheeks   because     I   see   thee advancing
after thy lust and turning aside from him who created thee
and fashioned        thee.    Remember        the kindness of thy Master
(Maw/?ka)      when    we   educated     theo                 tho nights      and
during

'             :
days for tho service of tho Religion                   (lit. matter ')         fear
God, and be of those who repent.              . . . Remember          when thou
didst stand before the throne ('arsh) and didst write what wo
conveyed unto ihee of the signs (verses) of God, the Guardian,

. . .
the Able,     the Powerful.             Verily we advise thee for the
sake of God : if thou advancest,               (it is) for thyself        (i.e. for

> is independent       of thee and of those who follow thee in mani
fest error.       God hath taken away him who then led thee
astray ; return unto Him humbled, abased, trembling;      verily

lie will put away from thee thy sins: verily     thy Lord       is
Swift to Repent,  the Precious, the Merciful."
After  two more clauses, the first strongly forbidding     the

ill-treatment  and overloading     of beasts of burden,  the second
> ordaining   the  payment    iu  all eases  of accidental homicide  of
> the sum of 100 micjk?ls        of gold as a compensation       to the

> of thoso which exist and adopt them as a means of communi
cation one with         another.

"This,"  says Beh?,   "is the means
> of union, if ye knew it, and the greatest cause of concord and
civilization did ye recognize    it. Verily we have made these

two things tho two signs of tho maturity      of the world : the
first (and that is the chief foundation)     we have revealed in
other Tablets;       and the second we have revealed        in this
marvellous   Tablet."

I havp now completed my sketch of the sacred literature
and the doctrines      of the B?b?s.    Did I not feel that I had
already exceeded      tho limits reasonably to be assigned    to an
article of this description,   I should have said something   about

the poems of Nab?l, Na'?m, Rawh?, Maryara,       and other B?b?s
who    have drawn the inspiration of their verses from the doc

> trines of the new religion.    As it is, I unwillingly   postpone
> an   account     of   them   till   some   future   occasion.

My object in this Essay has been to sum up in the briefest
compass possible all the more important facts which I have
been able to glean on a subject hitherto                          little

comparatively
studied;  to classify and describe the literature of the different
epochs into which     the history of B?b?ism divides      itself;      to

smooth  the path of future students of this last great religious
movement     to which Persia has given birth ; and to

point out
> the most important    lacunae which exist in our present know
> ledge of this matter.    The work which was so ably begun by
M. le Comte de Gobineau        I have attempted      to carry down to
the present date so far as was possible from the materials            at
my disposal, though     I  am   painfully  conscious    that I can

lay
no claim to the masterly     pen and keen insight into character
which ho possessed,    and by the magic of which he transports
us as we read his words      into the midst of the stirring events
which   convulsed Persia     some forty years ago, in such wise
that to us the fiery and zealous Mulla Huseyn,           the beautiful

and enthusiastic Kurratu'l-'Ayn,       and most of all the gentle,
patient, persecuted  Founder       of the  new faith, seem to us as
people  whom    we  have   met    and   conversed    with rather than
6uch as we have merely      read of in history.

In conclusion    I would      ask the kind indulgence        of the
reader for the defects which may be apparent in this Paper,
whether   of composition,     arrangement,     selection of material,
or treatment thereof.     Its preparation,    frequently  interrupted
by other duties, has involved          the perusal of a number of
Persian   and Arabic MSS.,      some of which were written         in a
Shikasta handwriting         not eas}' to read.   The perusal of these
was for the most part                       pari passa with the com

the later writings    of Beh?.      That this method   of procedure

aware, further study having sometimes                  me to modify

Paper   ; while   it was   not                       so to alter the

> opinion   I had discarded  without   entirely reconstructing large
portions    of  what I had  written.    In such cases I have re

ferred iu a note to the subsequent passage wherein this modi
fication of opinion is set forth.

Lastly,   some ma}r perhaps wonder why I did not settle
those points as to the date and authorship             of certain works
which     I have been compelled           to  leave somewhat undecided

by reference to my B?b? friends while this was still possible.
With     regard to this, I can only state that to the best of my
kuowledge      I never missed an opportunity         of conversing with
tho B?b?s    on matters     connected with their religion, and that

APPENDIX           IL
Since the publication     of my  first Article    on the B?b?s,
information    bearing   on certain points   discussed     therein or
in connexion    therewith has reached me.      As it seems to me
desirable   that this should be made public,        especially   as it
has    induced me         to alterI expressed as to the age

the views
of the B?b, I have embodied  it in this Appendix,   together
with sundry other remarks which   I wished   to add to what
I had previously written.

I. The      Age   of    the    B?b.

While    engaged   in the composition of my first Article     I
wrote to a friend in Sh?r?z, who is in some sense related to
the B?b, and asked him to endeavour     to ascertain   the date
when the latter was born as nearly as possible, stating at the
same    time the difficulty I had experienced         in reconciling   the
conflicting   statements   of different    authors.

A short time ago I received          an answer stating         that the
B?b was born on Muharram              1st,   a.h.   1236   (October 9th,

1820), and married        in a.h.    1208     (a.D. 1842),    two years
before the commencement      of his mission,     at which time he
was 24 years of age.     It is therefore     evident   that the two
passages which I quoted from the Bey?n           (Journal of Boyal
Asiatic Society, July, 1889, pp. 508-511)       refer to the Bab's
ago at the time when his mission       began, not, as I at first
thought,  to the time when they were composed.

The Bab's widow       survived  till a.h. 1300, only six years
ago.   She  was  the sister  of my friend's maternal grandfather.
The above particulars are derived from an old lady of the same
family, so that there is every reason to regard them as reliable.

Mr. C. D. Cobham, Commissioner          at Larnaca, Cyprus, has
kindly  supplied  me   with   much   valuable    information     about
the B?b? exiles    there.    Amongst    other   things  he   tells me
that Mushkin Kalam          (Joum. Boy. Asiat. Soc. July, 1889, pp.
516-517),  with whom        he was well acquainted,   stated the year
of the Bab's        birth as A.D. 1819, which    agrees much more
nearly    with     the date above given   than with that which I
previously       put forward.

II.    B?b?    Exiles      in Cyprus.

In my     first article       I inserted     a note

(p. 517) stating that,
according     to the Arabic    Encyclopaedia      called Dd'iratiCl?
Ma'drif,   $ubh-i-Ezel  was dead.     Information    kindly supplied

> to me by Mr. Houston,       Mr. Cobham, and Captain Young,
> residents   in Cyprus, proves this statement       to be a mistake
According     to the information       obtained by the first of these
gentlemen,    Subh-i-Ezel     is still  living at Famagusta.        He    is
described as "evidently      a man of rank," and it is further stated

that he makes     no use of the freedom granted             him by the
British Government,       from, which he receives        a             Ile

pension.

never even appears        out of doors.       Mr. Cobham was kind
enough     to refer to the Government          Estimates    for 1884-5,
and 1889-90,        and        to communicate     to me the results of his

investigations,    which        showed    that Subh-i-Ezel'a     pension had
been reduced during              that period from ?105        6s. to ?61  16?.

During   the same period                Mushkin      Kalam's  pension  sunk
from ?58    17s. to ?20                 13s.    He   came from Nicosia    to
Larnaca       towards         the end of  1885, and remained at the latter
place       till September         14th, 1886, when he left Cyprus     for
Acre.        He    has two         sons : one, 'AH,               him to

accompanied
Acre    ; the other, Jel?lu'd-D?n,    is still in Cyprus, and is in
the employment     of the British Government      as Land Registry
clerk.    Mushkin    Kalam's      real name was          Ali-ed-Din

The information          supplied by Captain Young              is still moro
> detailed.       The day after he received              the letter of inquiry
which I had addressed             to him, he paid a visit to Subh-i-Ezel

in person, and of this interview he was kind enough to for
ward me a circumstantial             account.     On the following         day he

received a visit from Subh-i-Ezers             son,  whom     he   describes   as
" an                              man    about   30                    and   from

intelligent    young                          years old,"
him obtained         further     information.        I would gladly quote

porated

Subh-i-Ezel   is described by Captain Young    as "a

slightly
built man of about 5ft. 6in,, with a fine-cut handsome         face,
and a large beard."     His name is M?rz? Yahy?,      and he was
born at Teher?n.       His  father, named    'Abb?s, was better
known as M?rz? Buzurg,        and was   "second    to the Grand
Vizier     in Persia."         Beh?   and ?ubh-i-Ezel            are step-brothers,
born     of one father         but different mothers.             Subh-i-Ezel    was
sent to Cyprus apparently      in 1868,1 together with his wives
and children,    numbering     twelve     in all.   Muskhin      Kalam
with his family, numbering        four in all, wero also sent there
at the samo timo. These wero all tho B?b?s sent to Cyprus.
Subh-i-Ezel's    pension    from     the British     Government        at
present  amounts    to ?7  Is.  (5d. per month    of  thirty-one   days,
and about 4s. 6d. less per month   of thirty days.

Some of tho statements made by me in ray                               first Article
wero criticized by Subh-i-Ezel   as follows :

" There were threeB?b?s killed

1 Tins    is according    to n note mado by Cnptain Young's predecessor      in 1870,
which states that Subh-i-Ezel         and Mushkin Kalam have both been in the island
eleven                ^ubh-i-Ezel's    own statement    to Captain Young   is as follows:
" was years.sent here twenty-three                   I may have said in 1879 that I hnd

I                                   years ago.

been here eloven years then, but it is twenty-three              years now  according     to
Persian years."

I forget         at present the names of tho others, but about

of my followers    were killed by Beh?'is    at
twenty
Acre."

Besides         this

information,    and much more of almost equal
value, Captain Young       succeeded    in obtaining      from Subh-i
Ezel a MS. work (of which,         as I have not yet had time to
study    it, I must   reserve    tho description       for some other
occasion),   and a  document     of  great  historical     interest, viz.
the appointment       of Subh-i-Ezel              as his successor.

This   is, I believe, copied directly from the original   in Sublv
i-Ezel's possession.     As it is too valuablo to bo omitted, and
is, moreover, quite short, I subjoin the text and translation.

(Signature).

The document        from which       tho above text        is taken is
endorsed by Captain Young             as follows:     "Copy of Appoint
ment     of Subh-i-Ezel     as Bab's     successor, original written by
B?b."      I will only make        the following     observations     on it.
The B?b calls himself         'Ali before Nebil"     (i.e. 'Ali Nebil),
> instead of 'AHMuhammad,          which is his proper name.          Nebil
> is chosen as an equivalent      of Muhammad,        the numerical value
of either         being the same (92) according

word                                 to the abjad
notation.   Of these substitutions        the B?b?s are very fond,
and this same document,         short as it is, furnishes     us with
another instance.    Subh-i-Ezel     is not  addressed by his  proper
name, Yahy?,      but is described       as "he whose      name      is
equivalent                to    the One"     (wahkl), because    the numerical
equivalent of both ?*s-j                  and ^c+&?, is the same, viz. 28.     I
have already   discussed                  the important    part played   by  the
abjad notation                  in the B?b? theology    (p. 39-43),  which  has
also been fully treated of by Gobineau.     This     document
furnishes  us with the grounds whereon Subh-i-Ezel's     claims
to be      the     Bab's                         are    based.        The         reasons                the

vicegerent                                                     why
is considered   as cancelled    by the Beh?'?s  have
appointment
been mentioned      in my first Article     (p. 615).   They  admit
that M?rz? Yahy? was the vicegerent         of the B?b, but declare
that     his                   to exorcise                       ceased      on      the

right                        authority                                    appearance
of  'lie whom God shall manifest' and thu commencement    of
the new dispensation which he ushered in. That   'lie whom

God       shall manifest'              has    the    right      to assume     the fullest
authority?this   authority extending                          to the abrogation   of old
and the addition   of new ordinances?is           conclusively     proved
by the Bey?n       itself.   The whole question on which the B?b?
schism hinges        is therefore this: "Is Beba        'He whom God
shall manifest,'        or not?       If he   is, then     Subh-i-EzePs
appointment      ceases    to be valid.   If not,  then   Subh-i-Ezel     is

undoubtedly      the   Bab's chosen successor."

I cannot       lose this opportunity      of expressing      my warmest
thanks     to Captain Young,         Mr. C. D. Cobham,              and Mr
Houston       for tho ready help they havo given me                     in my

researches,     and the valuablo        information      with which        they
have     supplied me.         The   promptitude         with    which      their

were
> inquiries were set on foot, the care with which                   they
> conducted,      and   the  value of   the   results   obtained,  were     only
equalled by the ready courtesy with which                    they undertook

the investigation.        I also desire to express my gratitude               to
Mr. A. A. Bevan,           of Trinity     College,     Cambridge,      for    his
kindness       in assisting me      to revise most          of the passages

translated     from the Arabic, whereby             several serious errors
have      been   corrected,       and    many       emendations         made.

One more            remark must           be added.          In ray first Article (p.
517,              I    stated     that      a rumour          had   reached me from

note)
Beyrout    to the effect that Beba was dead.      The correspon
dent who informed me of this report has since written             to
contradict   it on the authority of no less a person than Bella's

son,     'Abb?s Efendi.

III.     The     Last       B?b?      Martyr.

Those   who were present at the Meeting       of the Society on
April   15th, 1889, at which my first paper was read, will
remember     that in the discussion   which  followed    it, General
Houtum-Schindler       stated that a B?b? had been put to death
at Isfahan    in October, 1888.     In reply to inquiries which I
made of my friends in Persia, I received a little time ago a

letter    containing  an account of                   this    event,     of a portion   of
which      I here give the translation                  :
You wrote    that you had heard from General             Schindler
of tho martyrdom     of one of this sect. The details are these.
A child, who was one of the servants of the andar?n (women's

of the Prince      Zill-es-Sult?n,      had become     ac
apartments)                                                   '

quainted   with several    individuals     of     the friends   (ahbdb),
and Ak? M?rz? Ashraf        of Ab?d? had apprized him of this
Matter   (i.e. had converted      him to B?b?ism).    News      of this

> reaches the Prince     Zill-es-Sult?n.   They    torment    the   child
> to make him tell the truth, but he in no wise discloses             the
matter.    Guile   enters the hearts of the Prince's          servants.
One of them goes and inquires of several of              the friends,'

'Where    is Ak? M?rz? AshrafP          I have a wife      in Abade,
and I desire to send to her a letter and some money.              Since
Ak?       M?rz?

Ashraf   has acquaintances   in Ab?d?,  I wish to
> send them by    means   of him.'   These, believing this repre
> sentation, point out to him the abode of Ak? M?rz? Ashraf.

When            they  recognize Ak? M?rz? Ashraf,   they seize him and
bring           him   into the presence  of the Prince.    The Prince
inquires         of Ak? M?rz? Ashraf,   Art thou of this sect ?    He

'                                            '                                            '
answers,               I    am      not.'      He                   If   thou   art     not,        curse

says,

(them, or the B?b,       or Beh?).    Ile replies,     'Since   their
wickedness     has not been made apparent       to me, I will not

'                                                   a decision
curse     (them).   Eventually    the Prince  obtains
from several of tho 'Ulamd, and telegraphs          to Teher?n,     'If
this person be    not killed, the 'Ulamd and the populace         will

> raise  disturbance   : the 'Ulam?, moreover,     have pronounced
> sentence:    he himself, also, has confessed    that be is of this
sect, and it is necessary  to kill him to quiet the people.'   The
order comes from Teher?n,        Do whatever    appears desirable.'

Then    the Prince   orders the execution of Ak?                                    M?rz? Ashraf,
According     to the accounts I have heard, they                                   cut off his head
and then gibbet him.        Afterwards   they set                                 fire to his body.
I myself    was acquainted     with Ak? M?rz?                                     Ashraf.     . . .
His               seemed            to be    about                He      was    a man          of   under

age                                          sixty.

These comprise     the chief B?b? writings     with which I am

acquainted.       Besides    them there aro numerous        short epistles
written    to different private     individuals, gcnorally     believers   ;

as  in  the  case of  the                 to  enemies   and

etc., also   exist.    Of  some  of these I possess copies which    I

hope   to publish subsequently.

V.    Transliteration.

Considerations            into which           to enter having

necessary     to add a few words of apology and explanation.
Transliteration    of Arabic is especially    unsatisfactory,      in

late Professor  Palmer,    in his Arabic Manual,    which  appears

to me at least as good as any other.      In only one point am I
conscious       of   a certain        amount      of                         viz.   in   the   trans

As  regards the Persian,    I knew of no system which I was
prepared    to adopt in its entirety.  Those employed   in France
and Germany       seemed unsuitable by reason of the more com
plicated   representation  of the consonants  rendered necessary
by the peculiarities   of those languages, while   those devised
in England   have usually been constructed with      the view of
indicating tho  pronunciation   of Persian as spoken by natives
of India.

So far as concerns     the consonants,  I have followed    the
S3'stem laid down by Forbes            in his Persian  Grammar    with
the following    exceptions     :

(1) Cj is represented           s instead of $.
?                        '
(2)     is represented    by     instead of '.

J  are alike represented
(3) ^, u? >and                                  by z. It would no
doubt have been better          to distinguish    them as Forbes   has
done, but since they occur for the most part in words which
will be immediately     recognized by any one with a knowledge
of tho language,    it appeared to me unnecessary   to introduce
further      complications   into the typography,   especially               as the
totul      amount of transliterated   Persian   in the article               is but
small.

(4) j is usually represented by v, sometimes by w.
As regards the vowels, those which are long are marked
with    an acute accent,     and the majhid      sounds of o and e
peculiar    to India   are discarded.    When    e is used, it repre
sents fntha, which, however,       is usually transliterated  a, with
the exceptions     above specified ; at the end of words ? repre
sents      *              with             and   sometimes   with

pointed            fatha,                            kesra,     e.g.

ehe for te^.
