The Baha'i Minority and Nationalism

in Contemporary Iran

Theocracy challenges both of the major nationalist traditions that
> developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The "revolu-
> tionary" or "civic" tradition in eighteenth-century France and the
United States equated the nation with the people in a democratic
society, regardless of their language or ethnicity. Often even the
individual's religion was declared irrelevant to membership in the
nation. Of importance was one's commitment to a set of secular
ideals and, at most, one's willingness to acquire the national lan-
guage, criteria that authorized a pluralist conception of the public.
The later Central and Eastern European ideals of exclusionary nation-
alism based on language and "race," which emerged in the mid-
nineteenth century, envisioned a singular source of national identity.3
Benedict Anderson has argued that nationalisms in the global South
were modular, having been modelled on nations in South America and
Europe. 4 He has been challenged on this point by Partha Chatterjee,
who maintains that nationalisms in the colonized world outwardly
adopted the techniques of colonial power (political parties, nationalist
discourse, newspapers, etc.) but inwardly demarcated a "spiritual"
realm of difference from the colonizer concerned with domesticity,
the place of women, and religion.'

Iran's theocracy turns Chatterjee's perspective on its head insofar
as Rohu'llah Khomeini transformed the latent "spiritual" realm that
distinguished Iranian nationalism from that of the North Atlantic
imperial powers into the public realm, displacing Western-derived
discourses of nationalism in the process. Iran's theocracy mixes ele-
ments of both civic and exclusionary nationalist traditions while
appearing to reject nationalism altogether. It defines members of the
nation by their willingness to accept the rule of the supreme juris-
prudent and to be subordinate to the apparatus of Islamic law, over
which he presides. In a sense, only Shi'ite Muslims are full citizens

The Baha'i Minority and Nationalism in Contemporary Iran     129

(only a Shi'ite may be president), with minorities being ranked in the
following order: Sunni Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians.
Baha'is and secularists have at many points been defined as persons
outside the nation altogether because by definition they cannot sin-
cerely accept the rule of the jurisprudent and because he cannot define
a legitimate Islamic niche for them to occupy. There is thus both an
ideological and an ethnic element in Iranian Muslim nationalism. Yet
Iran's nationalism also appeals to nativist authenticity since Iranian
Shi'ism gives a distinctive identity to members of the nation, who
either were brought up within the Shi'ite faith or are encompassed
by it culturally and politically.

Many of Iran's clerical leaders have rejected the notion of nation-
states altogether and see the international conception of human rights
as a Western invention or a hypocritical means for corrupt imperialist
powers to meddle in the internal affairs of an Islamically ruled nation.
Antinationalism in the tradition of Khomeini has been tempered over
time even though he founded the republic. It has been widely noted
that the Islamic Republic has passed through distinct phases of gov-
ernance. I will characterize these as a radical right-wing populism
during the Khomeini era (197~9), conservative theocracy during
the presidency of Hojjatu'l-Islam 'Ali Akbar Hashirni Rafsanjani
(1g8g-g7), and polarization (a struggle between radicals, conserva-
tives, and reformists) under President Mohammad Khatami (since
1997). During the Khomeini era of radical theocracy, many religious
minorities were treated with extreme harshness. During the succeed-
ing era of conservative theocracy, policies became less draconian
(although on the whole they remained unsatisfactory to the inter-
national human-rights community and to many members of the
religious minorities themselves). Here I concentrate on the 1990s and
investigate the question of minority and nation in Iran. How did
changes in regime policy affect the conception of the nation and the
place of the Baha'is within it in this period of great change? The
Iranian Baha'is are, among all the minorities, perhaps the most anom-
alous in contemporary Iranian law and politics, and from their case
we may therefore expect to learn a great deal about the consider-
ations driving Iran's minorities policy more generally.

The issue of the place of religious minorities in the Iranian nation
is more important than it might appear on the surface. Non-Muslim
religious minorities probably account for only 1 per cent of Iranians
today (around 6oo,ooo persons). But in fact, the proportion is much
higher if we take into account that Sunni Muslims are a religious

130                         Juan R.l. Cole

minority in Iran that, although traditionally estimated at only about
7 to 8 per cent of the population, some observers put at 10 to 20 per
cent. {Sunnis belong to tribal groups on Iran's periphery, such as
Kurds, Lurs, Arabs, Turkmen, and Baluch, and many are pastoralists
who have probably been undercounted in censuses; they also include
the some 2 million Afghan refugees in Iran, many of >vhorn seem
unlikely to return to Afghanistan.) It should also be remembered that
Shi'ism itself is differentiated into Sufi orders such as the
Ni'matu'llahi and theological schools such as the Shaykhi, both of
which have been persecuted in Khomeinist Iran. The heterodox
Ahl-i Haqq sect, being syncretic, coexists uneasily with Shi'ism. Reli-
gious minorities are therefore a more pressing national issue than the
undifferentiated social statistics might suggest.

Ofra Bengio and Gabriel Ben-Dor have distinguished between
"compact" minorities in the Middle East (Druze, Maronites, Kurds)
and diffuse minorities. They note that groups such as the Eastern
Orthodox Christians in Syria and Lebanon lack a strong regional base
or close political connections with centres of power. They have an
impact on culture and in private business. Elaborating upon the
observations of Bernard Lewis, they also point out that the melding
of Islamic themes with Middle Eastern nationalisms in the past thirty
years has had the effect of excluding or marginalizing Christians and
others. This problem has been especially acute for the Christians of
Southern Sudan, who are neither Arab nor Muslim in a state that has
increasingly defined itself as both. 6 The Baha'is in Iran resemble the
Eastern Orthodox Christians in being such a dispersed minority with
no strong regional base (although they are significantly concentrated
in a few towns, such as Sangesar). They benefit from being Persian-
speaking Iranians in the main, although there is a substantial Azeri
minority among them. The rise of the Islamic Republic, however,
~ositioned them unfavourably, just as Islamically tinged nationalisms
m the Arab world tend to exclude Eastern Orthodox and Coptic
~ristian minorities. Understanding the position of Iranian Baha'is
m contemporary Iran requires an understanding of how nationalism
now manifests itself in this country.

NATIONALISM        AND     THE    BAHA'IS       IN   IRAN

~ran as a nation, like most other modern nations, was first imagined
into being in the nineteenth century. Prior to this time, the Iranian

The Baha'i Minority and Nationalism in Contemporary Iran    131

plateau had been ruled by polyglot empires that, despite having
a conception of the peoples who had dwelt on the plateau (e.g.,
Persian-speaking "lranis" and Turkic-speaking "Turanis"), had no
conception of the nation-state in the modern sense. The Achaemenids
kept their records in Elarnite or Aramaic for the most part, even
though they themselves spoke Old Persian. The plateau was ruled
by Arabs from the Muslim conquest to the rise of the Buyids in the
tenth century and then by ethnically Turkic dynasties such as the
Saljuqs, Safavids, and Qajars for much of the rest of the medieval
and early modern period. Even in what is now Iran, only about 51 per
cent of the population speaks Persian as its primary language, with
Turkic dialects, such as Azeri, Qashqa'i, and Turkoman, being spoken
at home by at least a third of Iranians. Other Iranian languages, such
as Kurdish, Luri, and Baluch, are also significant. Some intellectuals
in the nineteenth century began to fall under the spell of romantic
nationalism, which posited nations as eternal essences intimately
linked to land, blood, and tongue and which sought ancient origins
for modern polities. A few Iranian thinkers found these ideas attrac-
tive insofar as they underlined the greatness of the Achaemenid
Empire in antiquity and constituted Iranians not as backward Muslim
tribespeople and villagers but as cosmopolitan heirs to Cyrus the
Great. Ominously, many of these early nationalists were especially
attracted by the scientific racism of Joseph-Arthur comte de Gobineau,
and others,7 which put "Aryans" at the pinnacle of a racial hierarchy.
By becoming nationalists, Persian speakers could thus hope to join
the system at the top (although in actuality the idea of Europeans
accepting Iranians as equals in the age of empire was foredoomed
to failure}. Thinkers such as Akhundzadih and Mirza Aqa Khan
Kirmani excoriated the Arab Muslims for having, in their view,
ruined the ancient and proud Iranian Aryan civilization, character-
ized by Zoroastrianism and ernpire. 8 Needless to say, this view of
things struck most Iranian Shi'ite Muslims as bizarre.

The Baha'i faith has its roots in the nineteenth-century millenarian
Babi movement, which around 1849 may have had as many as 50,000
to 100,000 adherents in a population of around 6 million." However,
it was brutally suppressed in the 1850s, and these numbers, if they
were really this high to begin with, certainly declined dramatically
during the persecution launched after leading Babis attempted to
assassinate the shah in 1852. Baha'i numbers in Iran have always been
a matter of informed guesswork. 10 From the late 186os, the movement

132                         Juan R.I. Cole

was reinvigorated and transformed by Baha'u'llah, who founded the
Baha'i faith, which from all accounts grew rapidly in Qajar Iran. His
modernist message of world peace, world unity, and adoption of both
parliamentary democracy and Western technology struck a chord
with many Iranians. 11 It would not surprise me if there were 200,000
Baha'is by 1900 in a population of 9 million, and the movement
appears to have garnered enormous numbers of adherents and sym-
pathizers in the early twentieth century under the charismatic, liberal,
and universalistic leadership of 'Abdu'l-Baha (head of the religion
from 1892 to 1921). By the 1920s an internal census conducted by the
Baha'is is said to have found that about a million persons in Iran came
at least occasionally to Baha'i meetings. This number seems surpris-
ingly high, but it is plausible given that it reports only attendees, not
actual members of congregations, and that it includes many persons
who would now be categorized as vague sympathizers, as friends of
believers, or perhaps even as idly curious. 12

Because the Baha'i faith originated in the mid-nineteenth century
on Iranian soil, it could conceivably claim advantages over the "for-
eign" Islam of the Arabs. In actuality, the movement out of which it
developed, Babism, was a form of hyper-Shi'ism focused on the
advent of the Shi'ite Mahdi, or promised one. In contrast, the Baha'i
faith itself shed most of the particularistic practices of Shi'ism and
Babism, seeking instead to engage modernity by emphasizing values
such as globalization and world unity. As neither Shi' ism nor Babism
lent itself to modern nationalism, both sects were often dismissed
by nationalists. Akhundzadih, a Voltaircan who deeply disliked
Islam, sniffed that given what the Bab's grandfather (the Prophet
Muhammad) had achieved, it seemed unlikely that the "grandson"
(Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab [181cr-50]) had founded a
beneficial movement.

Mirza Husayn 'Ali Nuri (1817-<J2), known as Baha'u'llah, the
founder of the Baha'i faith, was deeply suspicious of modern Euro-
pean nationalism. He said, "Glory does not lie in loving one's nation
but_ rather in loving the whole world." Still, he took pride in Iran's
ancient civilization and urged Iranians to adopt modem institutions,
such as parliamentary democracy, and to embrace science in order to
recover their honoured place among the nations. In 1891, during the
Tobacco Revolt against a European monopoly: he wrote, "O people
0 fP    ·11n                                    '

ersia.   former times you have been the symbols of mercy and
the embodiments of affection and kindliness. The regions of the

The Baha'i Minority and Nationalism in Contemporary Iran           133

world were illumined and embellished by the brightness of the light
of your knowledge and by the blaze of your erudition. How is it that
you have arisen to destroy yourselves and your friends with your
own hands?" He added, "How strange that the people of Persia, who
were unrivalled in sciences and arts, should have sunk to the lowest
level of degradation among the kindreds of the earth.""

Much earlier, in a book published in Bombay in 1882, his son
'Abdu'l-Baha 'Abbas, later the leader of the movement from 1892 to
1921, had written words about Iran that any romantic nationalist
would recognize:

0 people of Persia! Look into those blossoming pages that tell of another
day, a time long past. Read them and wonder; see the great sight. Iran in
that day was as the heart of the world; she was the bright torch flaming in
the assemblage of mankind. Her power and glory shone out like the morning
above the world's horizons, and the splendor of her learning cast its rays
over East and West. Word of the widespread empire of those who wore her
crown reached even to the dwellers in the arctic circle, and the fame of the
awesome presence of her King of Kings humbled the rulers of Greece and
Rome. The greatest of the world's philosophers marveled at the wisdom of
her government, and her political system became the model for all the kings
of the four continents then known. She was distinguished among all peoples
for the scope of her dominion, she was honored by all for her praiseworthy
culture and civilization. She was as the pivot of the world, she was the source
and center of sciences and arts, the wellspring of great inventions and
discoveries, the rich mine of human virtues and perfections. The intellect,
the wisdom of the individual members of this excellent nation dazzled the
minds of other peoples, the brilliance and perceptive genius that character-
ized all this noble race aroused the envy of the whole world.><

He went on to recount legends, based on Firdawsi's epic, Shalmameh,
of how "the first government to be established on earth, the foremost
empire to be organized among the nations, was Persia's throne and
diadem" and then to speak of the glory of the Achaemenids, who
ruled much of the ancient world.'" The Baha'i emphasis on peace and
globalism led outside observers, such as E.G. Browne, to assume that
they would side with foreign powers against the interests of their
own nation, but there seems little evidence for such an allegation. 'n
The Baha'i leaders were more critical of Europe and European impe-
rialism than Browne realized.

With the rise of the Pahlevi dynasty in the mid-192os, ideas of race
and nation began to be spread through the modern school system.
On the one hand, nationalists such as Reza Shah and his supporters
attempted to reduce the power of Shi'ite Islam and to foster a civil
Iranian identity. Many Baha'is saw this emphasis as beneficial to
them at least in the short run. On the other hand, strong secular
nationalists such as Ahmad Kasravi attacked the Baha'is and other
religious groups as a source of disunity for the Iranian nation.
Throughout the twentieth century, Shi'ite religious nationalists saw
the Baha'is as dangerous heretics and as channels by which danger-
ous Western ideas, such as equality for women, entered Iran. Insofar
as the Baha'i faith was a post-Islamic religion, its legitimacy was
rejected by the Shi'ite clergy, who could not recognize any religion
arising after Islam as a real religion. They categorized it as a political
movement, a somewhat bizarre characterization given the Baha'i
leaders' quietism. 17 It is true that in the 1930s some Baha'i leaders
turned their back on the earlier scriptural principle of separation of
religion and state championed by Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha and
began to advocate a theocracy in which Baha'i institutions would
ultimately supplant civil governments and impose censorship and
Baha'i law on the populace. Such theocratic dreams, however, were
not regarded as a practical goal to be implemented but as a mystical
vision that God would bring about by visiting sudden catastrophes
on humankind. From the 1960s, the Baha'is' bestowal on these apoc-
alyptic motifs of a patina of anticlericalism, modernism, and
cosmopolitanism made them hated among Shi'ite activists, such as
the Hujjatiyyih movement, which was dedicated to fighting Baha'i
influence and disrupting the religion and which cooperated with the
shah's SAVAK, or secret police, in order to do so.

~e Baha'i faith has no trained formal clergy and deals with its
affairs by electing or appointing lay officers. From the late 1920s, a
rigid administrative structure was imposed on the Iranian Baha'i
community involving elections in which nominations or overt cam-
paigning were forbidden. While such a system worked relatively well
in small local communities where ever:.,one was known and inter-
action was face to face, the newly inve;,.ted electoral system of the

9 0s and 1930s posed great problems at the level of national elec-
ti?ns, and administrators, despite their wide popularity, gradually
discovered that incumbents could almost never be unseated and
could, behind the scenes, create a "buzz" around informal candidates

The Baha'i Minority and Nationalism in Contemporary Iran     135

they favoured to fill open seats. This openness of the system to such
irregularities and authoritarian tendencies at the national level was
reinforced by the Baha'i authorities' insistence that these institutions
be obeyed implicitly and never publicly criticized and by the creation
in 1951 of a body, the "hands of the cause," charged with both
propagation and "protection" of the Baha'i faith. In the view of the
more narrow-minded "hands," the latter function authorized them
to conduct a standing Inquisition against Baha'is with innovative
ideas. They were empowered to suggest excommunication and shun-
ning as punishments for thought crimes, giving them great informal
power. Strict prepublication censorship was required of adherents
who wrote anything for publication about their own religion, and
Baha'i books and histories, even some scriptures, were routinely
suppressed by the Baha'i leaders. That is, the universalist and liberal
principles of the founders of the religion had by the mid-twentieth
century been reduced to an attractive facade for a movement that
now had a secret authoritarian agenda. It is instructive that several
of the religion's major intellectuals in twentieth-century Iran ended
up being largely marginalized or even shunned inside the commu-
nity, which produced only a handful of writers willing to brave such
opprobrium.

From the mid to late 1920s, Baha'is in Iran were forbidden by their
ecclesiastical authorities to maintain dual membership in the Baha'i
faith and any other religion, to belong to political parties, to hold
political posts, or to belong to organizations such as the freemasons
or Sufi orders. Baha'is were excommunicated and shunned for declin-
ing to relocate from their homes to some other region when ordered
to do so by the Baha'i authorities. An anti-intellectualism emerged
that alienated many Baha'is who entered higher education as stu-
dents or professors. These policies had the effect of transforming an
open and universalistic movement of great popularity, with many
adherents and sympathizers, into a closed, quietist, and somewhat
narrow-minded ethnic community that sometimes sought inordinate
control over the lives of the faithful. Among the few high positions
open to Baha'is in Iranian society were those in the Pahlevi military,
and many became officers. Prominent Baha'i military men emerged
as power brokers within the community and began to impose almost
military-style discipline at Baha'i meetings and study classes.
Because of the Baha'i administration's rigidity and controlling ten-
dencies, as well as the hatred many Iranian Shi'ites entertained for

Juan R.L Cole

the new faith, many Baha'is left the religion in the course of the
twentieth century. By 1978 there were only about 90,000 registered

Baha'is in Iran and perhaps another 200,000 ethnic Baha'is and sym-
pathizers who never declared formal membership. Many of the
sympathizers who did not formally join were unwilling to submit to
the degree of control over their lives or isolation from Iranian political
and civil society demanded by Baha'i leaders of formally registered
believers. In addition to regimentation inside the community, Baha'is
faced occasional attacks from outsiders and even, in 1955, a nationwide
pogrom. 18 Many of these developments devastated the movement in
Iran, where most supporters and many members voted with their
feet by melding into secularist groups.

In his book on nationalism in Iran, based in part on interviews with
Iranians in the 1950s, Richard Cottam maintains that the nationalist
movement of Muhammad Musaddiq curbed those in its religious
wing who wished to attack the Baha'is in the early 1950s. He argues
that nationalism can benefit indigenous groups such as the Zoroas-
trians and Baha'is, while those religious minorities identified \.Yith a
foreign state (Armenians and, after 1948, Jews) are hurt by it. Musaddiq,
who nationalized Iran's oil industry and sent the shah into exile, was
overthrown by a CIA-backed coup in 1953. Two years later, the con-
servative clerics who had been allied with the shah launched a major
campaign of persecution against the Baha'is. Cottam suggests that
Muhammad Reza Pahlevi thereby rewarded those Shi'ite clergymen
who had supported him against the nationalist Musaddiq. What
Cottam does not know is that the shah also owed debts to the Baha'is.
His royal physician, a Baha'i who had grown fabulously wealthy
from court patronage, supported him while he was in exile in Italy
in 1953. Thus the shah allowed only symbolic damage to be inflicted
on the Baha'i centre's dome in Tehran in 1955, which nevertheless
served to establish his bona fides with conservative clerics, such as
Ayatollah Burujirdi.

But Muhammad Reza Pahlevi then gradually included the Baha'is
in his policy of favouring minorities for court patronage as a way of
offsetting the demands of nationalists and dissident Shi'ites. He
extended a certain amount of protection to minorities in return for
their support of his corporatist state. Baha'i industrialists, such as
Habib Sabet, benefited enormously from royal patronage, as did
bankers, such as Hozhabr Yazdani. (Employees in Sabit's enterprises
tended to dominate the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran.) The

> by Baha'is. This minorities policy of the 196os and 1970s, which
> benefited Baha'is, was a source of Khomeini's most vehement denun-
ciations of the shah's regime. Cottam reports that the Iranian Baha'is

he interviewed in the late 1950s professed themselves to be strong
supporters of the Iranian nation, but he seems ambivalent about

whether to believe them. 19 There is no strong reason to dismiss these
expressions of fervour. I have been told by older fallen-away Iranian

Baha'is that they first experienced an intellectual and cultural awak-
ening during the Musaddiq crisis. In the 1970s, at the height of the

minorities policy, Iranian Baha'is frequently told this author that the
shah's so-called White Revolution was based on Baha'i teachings,
and they were universally proud that "Hadrat-i Baha'u'llah" (His
Holiness, Baha'u'llah) had sprung from Iranian soil.

Khomeini's ascension to power in the winter of 1979 shifted the
official basis for identity in Iran from nation to Islam. This shift
disadvantaged all the religious minorities since a Zoroastrian could
be an exemplary Iranian but could be nothing more than an infidel
in fundamentalist Islamic terms. Among many other things, the 1979
revolution represented for many committed Shi'ite activists, includ-
ing Khomeini himself, the opportunity finally to take measures against
the Baha'is. Under Khomeini, many activists within the Hujjatiyyih
movement, which was obsessed with destroying the Baha'i faith,
gained great power in the new government. Among them was
Muhammad 'Ali Raja'i, who was elected president briefly before
being blown up by the Mujahidin-i Khalq guerrilla movement. In
1979 the Baha'i headquarters was invaded and confiscated, and the
membership list naming some 90,000 registered believers was found.
Between 1979 and 1989, nearly 200 Baha'is were executed and thou-
sands jailed. 20 Among those killed were the members of the Baha'i
national spiritual assembly. A Muslim judge and head of the Revo-
lutionary Court in Shiraz gave a newspaper interview in 1983 in
which he maintained that "The Iranian Nation has risen in accor-
dance with Quranic teachings and by the Will of God has determined
to establish the Government of God on earth. Therefore, it cannot
tolerate the perverted Bahais who are instruments of Satan and fol-
lowers of the Devil and of the superpowers and their agents.'' 21 This
passage evinces a confusing mixture of nationalist and religious lan-
guage: It is the "Iranian nation" that has established the Islamic
theocracy, and the Baha'is are excluded because of their alleged

RAFSANJANI'S             FIRST     TERM,        1989-93

The year 1g89 represented a major turning point for the Islamic
Republic. The previous year, Imam Khomeini had reluctantly
accepted a ceasefire in the long \var of attrition with Iraq; thus, for
the first full year since 1q&J, Iran was not on a war footing. Khomeini
himself died of a heart attack on > July 1q8q, hringing to a c!O'-'t' a
decade during \vhkh he and his policies of authoritarianism and
mass terror had dominated Iran. The clerical Assembly of Expert'>
met and selected Hujjatu'l-Islam 'Ali Khamenei, who had 5erved as
president since 1981, as the new supreme jurisprudent. Presidential

ment with Western European countries and privatization of industry.

He surrounded himself with Western-trained technocrats, dubbed
the "California mafia," and increasingly moved toward a pragmatic
conservatism that not onlv , alienated him from the radical theocrats,
but even created tension between him and the somewhat more
xenophobic and reactionary supreme jurisprudent, 'Ali Khamenei. 28
Rafsanjani promised in his inauguration speech to respect the "free-
dom and dignity of individuals," 2 9 and although his critics would
have found such a pledge on his part laughable, it is remarkable that
he should have spoken in such terms at all. This rhetoric was no
doubt an attempt to signal the international community that he
intended to undertake policy changes. Khomeini's persecuting soci-
ety, with its ever-widening wave of taboo groups, began to subside
in favour of a more selective use of repression.

During Rafsanjani's eight years in power, the absolute numbers of
those jailed or killed annually declined. The improvement under
Rafsanjani was relative, not absolute, and his regime was much worse
than some of the other dictatorships in the second half of the twen-
tieth century if one focuses on incarceration and executions of
political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. It is still true that acts
of official terror occurred far less frequently than in the frantically
bloodthirsty days of the early 198os. From 1 989 to 1997, human-rights
~:uganizations continued to report widespread abuse in Iran, includ-
mg substantial use of torture, arbitrary detentions, lack of fair trials,
and restrictions on the rights of women and of workers. Members of
the political opposition - such as the Mujahidin-i Khalq, the Tudeh
communist party, the Kurdish parties, and others - continued to be
?rutally arrested and executed on a large scale. The number of polit-
ical prisoners in Iran as late as IC)96 was estimated to be several
thousand by Amnesty IntemationaLJ0 Most religious minorities, in
contrast, began to be shown some clemency. By 1989, for instance,

the number of Baha'is in prison as prisoners of conscience had fallen
to 15, and this number remained the average in the succeeding
decade. This change marked the Rafsanjani years as quite different
from the situation under Khomeini.

In the 1990s some Baha'i students who had been expelled from
state schools were allowed to resume their studies, and a small
amount of property was returned to the Baha'is from whom it had
been confiscated. 3 ' The relative tolerance of Baha'is coincided with a
sharp drop in the influence of the Hujjatiyyih and of other radical
right-wing Shi'ite populists on the Iranian state. The Baha'is incar-
cerated during the Rafsanjani period included Bihnam Mithaqi and
Kayvan Khalajabadi, who were arrested in Karaj because of their
beliefs in April 1989 and continued to be held at Gohardasht Prison
without charge or trial for the succeeding decade. 32 The relatively
small number of arrests after 1989 took the form of serial harassment
of prominent or die-hard Baha'is. In 1990, for instance, fourteen
Baha'is were arrested as prisoners of conscience, whereas nineteen
were released. A few Baha'is were actually issued visas to leave Iran.
Others were allowed to reopen private businesses.

A strong Khomeinist legacy of official discrimination against the
Baha'is, who were branded a "misguided sect," did continue. The
Baha'is' administrative institutions had been disbanded by official
decree in 1983, and they continued to be banned from holding elec-
tions for local or national spiritual assemblies, which crippled the
Baha'i "administrative order," a sort of one-party structure that nor-
mally controls important aspects of adherents' lives. They were also
prohibited from proselytizing others to their faith. 33 The government
continued to deny that the Baha'i faith was a religion at all. This
religious community's property, including administrative offices and
places of worship, had been confiscated by the Khomeinist govern-
ment, and no restitution had been made. Baha'is were largely
excluded both from attending universities as students and from
teaching on their faculties as professors. In the mid-1990s some Baha'i
youth were prevented from attending the final year of high school
as well.

Given the position of modern education and of universities in
nation-building and nationalist iconography, this exclusion clearly
marked the Baha'is as somehow not a part of the Iranian nation. The
government regularly ruled Baha'is ineligible for compensation for
injury or criminal victimization on the grounds that only Muslim

142                         Juan R.I. Cole

plaintiffs may receive compensation. 34 They •vere frequently denied
public sector jobs, and the 10,000 Baha'i civil servants fired from the
state bureaucracy in the 1980s continued to be denied government
employment and the pensions they had accumulated. Indeed, even
in the 1990s demands continued that they pay back to the govern-
ment the salaries they had received while working for the state and
that those too indigent to do so be jailed. Again, exclusion from
positions in the state bureaucracy marked them as alien, as shape-
shifters only pretending to be part of the Iranian nation. Most were
not issued passports, although this began to change for a few. Baha'i
marriages were not officially recognized. This nonrecognition had
been used in the 1980s as a pretext to accuse Baha 'is of adultery and
the religious officials who married them of being pimps - both capital
crimes - but such accusations appear to have become uncommon in
the 1990s. The Baha'is allege that they suffer continued discrimina-
tion in the judicial system and that revolutionary officials pressure
defence lawyers not to accept Baha'i clients, although the Iranian
authorities deny this charge. Baha'is have had difficulty meeting
together for worship because the government has insisted that no
more than fourteen can gather at one time.35

How the Baha'is were treated in the 1990s depended a great deal
on the jurisdictions in which they lived, and some suffered more than
others. Yazd, for instance, was a difficult place for Baha'is to operate
businesses. The imprisonment and execution of Baha'is as well as the
other acts of persecution to which they were subjected in the 1990s
were symbolic, making a statement about the illegitimacy of the
community in the eyes of the authorities rather than involving
pogroms and large-scale judicial murder, as had occurred under
Khomeini. In 1993, for instance, the Tehran municipal authorities tore
up the Baha'i cemetery in order to build a cultural centre on the site.
Grave markers were reportedly uprooted and sold off, and earthwork
often involved desecrating gravesites.>6 This action created the prob-
lem for the Tehran Baha'i community of \.vhere to bury their dead
and elicited widespread condemnation from Western governments
and human-rights organizations. In the end, the Baha'is were
assigned some wasteland by the authorities for their burials but were
denied the right to place tombstones with names over the graves. 37
~ike. ~iversities and bureaucracies, graveyards tend to have national
~ign~ficance, as repositories of past citizens, some of whom would
inevitably be veterans or persons of national significance. Just as

living Baha'is were defined out of the Islamic Iranian nation, so now
even their dead were erased from history and dumped unnamed in
wastelands. ' 8

Some further executions of Baha'is did take place in this decade.

Bahman Samandari, a Tehran businessman, was suddenly arrested
and summarily executed in 1992. Samandari appears to have been
punished in part for having acted as liaison for the leaderless Iranian
Baha'is with the religion's officials in Haifa, Israel, and in part for
having gotten word out to the United Nations about his arrest. The
official reason given for his execution was "espionage," although
Iranian officials also openly complained about his having contacted
the United Nations about his arrest. 39 Although such executions came
to be rare, at times Baha'is were sentenced to death, and a handful
appear to remain on death row.

In 1991 Ayatollah Khamenei formalized many of these policies by
approving a "blueprint" for dismantling the Baha'i presence and
influence in Iran aimed at employing Shi'ite state hegemony gradu-
ally to extinguish the community rather than wiping it out through
brute force. The document was dra•vn up by Sayyid Muhammad
Gulpaygani, head of the Supreme Revolutionary Cultural Council,
after this body consulted on what to do about the Baha'is. Ironically,
as will be seen, this clerical plot resurrected key elements of secular
nationalist Iranian identity. The policy decided upon a grudging and
partial toleration of individuals but heavy discrimination against the
community, the religion, and its organization. Baha'is were not to be
arrested, imprisoned, penalized, or expelled from the country for no
reason (i.e., for no reason other than that they were Baha'is). As
Iranian citizens, they were to be provided routinely >vith ration book-
lets, passports, burial certificates, and work permits. They were to be
allowed to earn a modest living but not to prosper in such a way as
to encourage them to remain Baha'is. They could be schooled but
only if they avoided identifying themselves as Baha'is, and they were
to be sent especially to schools known for being able to indoctrinate
students heavily into Khorneinist ideology. With regard to employ-
ment, they were to be denied government posts and university jobs
and were generally to be kept out of education as a field. Baha'i
attempts to proselytize others and to spread their religion were to be
met with counterpropaganda. The memorandum advised, "a plan
must be devised to confront and destroy their cultural roots outside
the country." This paragraph appears to refer to the Khomeinist

officials' bizarre belief that the Baha'i faith was founded as part of a
British or other imperialist plot to divide Iranians. Finally, the docu-
ment insists that "their political (espionage) activities must be dealt
\vith." 40 This phrase refers to the officials' conviction that Baha'is
systematically engaged in spying for Israel and the us, a charge that
their apolitical quietisrn makes absurd and for which not even all the
reconstructed shredded documents captured at the us embassy
provided an iota of confirmation.

The general tenor of the plan submitted by Gulpaygani and signed
by Khamenei was to treat the Baha'is as ordinary citizens of Iran for
most purposes and to avoid making them martyrs in the eyes of the
international human-rights community for no good purpose; rather,
gradual and firm pressure was to be exerted on the community to
force it into the ranks of the poor, with the aim of thus making it
extremely unattractive to be a Baha'i. They clearly hoped that over
the long run, such systematic discrimination would deplete the reli-
gion's ranks without any need for wholesale persecution of the sort
tried during the early 1980s. Still, in recognizing that the Baha'is were
Iranian citizens who should be treated like other citizens, the docu-
ment found a new way of legitimating their existence as individuals
in the country, even while it continued to deny the legitimacy of the
religion to which they belonged. Remarkably, this legitimation
appealed to the secular principles of Iranian nationhood and citizen-
ship and left out reference to Islamic law altogether. Henceforth,
individual Baha'is were to suffer discrimination similar to that visited
upon African Americans in the days of Jim Crow in the American
South or upon Jews in the Germany of the rnid-193os, but they would
not face the sort of extreme persecution they had suffered under
Khomeini.

RAFSANJANI'S           SECOND        TERM,      1993-97

Rafsanjani's second term, 1993-97, was marked by increased strugg~e
between the three camps that had now emerged among the theocr~tic
heirs of Khomeini: what I will call (1) the pragmatic conservative,
( 2 ) the reactionary, and (3) the radical. Pragmatic conservatives, sue~
as Rafsanjani and his followers, continued to advocate economic

stances redolent of the radical position. They outlawed satellite dishes
and Western television, and they reconstituted the basij (irregular vol-

unteers who had fought at the Iraqi front) as a civilian vigilante force
with the power to harass and even summarily execute persons they

viewed as deviating from Islamic norms. They elevated Khomeini's
fatwa, or ruling of death, against Salman Rushdie to the status of an
irrevocable law, or hukm (apparently in the knowledge that this would
make it difficult for Western European nations entirely to effect a
rapprochement with Iran). 42 The weakness of the pragmatic conser-
vatives and their friction with reactionaries and radical right-wing

Juan R.I. Cole

populists was played out on many levels, including that of the treat-
ment of religious minorities.4 3

From 1993 through 1997, the Islamic court system, especially in the
provinces, became the primary arena for symbolically sanctioning
apostates, both Baha'is and others. As President Rafsanjani sought
good relations with Western Europe and institutions such as the
World Bank, he had a motivation not to engage in unnecessary and
egregious human-rights violations on the old Khomeinist scale. A
desire to continue to subject the Baha'is to punitive measures remained
liveliest among the more radical clerics, who, although comprising
only 15 per cent of parliament deputies, retained great power over
the judiciary. Radicals could also pressure the private sector, as in
Mashad, where businesses were discouraged by Khomeinist activists
in the rnid-199os from employing Baha'is.

The UN High Commission on Human Rights denounced the prac-
tice in the second Rafsanjani term of "arresting Baha'is and detaining
them for short periods and of summoning Baha'is to Ministry of
Intelligence agencies on various pretexts" and noted that during the
years 1994-97, "nearly 200 Baha'is were arrested and detained for
periods ranging from two days to six rnonths."44 Religious beliefs
affected sentencing. Police arrested a group of young men for mis-
conduct and later released the Muslims among them. Two of the
arrested, however, Arman Dimishqi and Kurush Dhabihi, were
Baha'is, and the courts demanded that they recant their faith in order
to obtain quick release as well. When they refused, both were sen-
tenced to eight years in prison. Among those in prison in 1997 were
Mansur Haddam and Kamyar Ruhi, who had been convicted of
"being active in the Baha'i community, of gathering for Baha'i meet-
ings in a private house and of working against the security of the
country by organizing a Baha'i children's art exhibit." A Baha'i edifice
in Urumiyeh was destroyed in 1997, Baha'is were occasionally sum-
marily expelled by Revolutionary Guards from their homes, which
were confiscated, and "it was alleged that the majority of the Baha'is
in the city of Yazd were prohibited from conducting any business
transactions."45

But the courts were entirely capable of going well beyond mere judi-
cial harassment on occasion. Bihnam Mithaqi and Kayvan Khalajabadi,
two Baha'is arrested in April 1989 and held without charge or trial
until December 1993, were sentenced to death. 46 A New York Times
editorial explained, "The judicial judgment against two defendants

living in Karaj, near Teheran, accuses them of a new kind of crime -
transmitting information that they were on trial for their lives to the
United Nations and to Bahai groups outside Iran." 47 In addition, the
two were accused of holding religious ceremonies, owning books, and
being"at war" with Islam. The government, however, managed to drag
its feet on carrying out the sentence, so the two men simply lan-
guished in prison. Also late in 1993, a provincial revolutionary court
in Rafsanjan sentenced another Baha'i, Ramadan 'Ali Dhulfaqari, to
death for apostasy. He was released from prison on 6 January 1994,
although the charge of apostasy "is said to remain outstanding. " 48
This outcome appears to reflect a conflict between the provincial judi-
ciary, who wanted Dhulfaqari executed, and other officials of the
Islamic Republic, who seem to have effectively buried the case, even
though it inevitably still hangs over his head.

In January 1996, Dhabihullah Mahrami (b. 1946) was sentenced to
death by a revolutionary tribunal in Yazd, joining Bihnam Mithaqi
and Kayvan Khalajabadi on death row. In February the Iranian
Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences against Mithaqi and
Khalajabadi, although one Iranian official floated the bald-faced lie
that the charge against them was espionage rather than religious
heresy. Their situation differed from that of Mahrami, however, inso-
far as they had been arrested in 1989 while Khomeini was still alive
simply for being Baha'is. Mahrami, born a Baha'i, had succumbed in
1g81 after the revolution to pressure to convert to Islam in order to
keep his job in the Ministry of Agriculture in the Province of Yazd.
His conversion under duress had been announced in the Kayhan
newspaper in August 1g83, and in 1985 he had signed a document
at the ministry where he was employed indicating that he was a
Muslim. Either because he could not bear the hypocrisy any further,
or because he thought that Khomeini's death and Rafsanjani's elec-
tion had made it safer to announce one's adherence to the Baha'i
faith, or both, Mahrami had then apostatized from Islam in 1g89.

However, he had not realized that under classical Muslim jurispru-
dence, such as had been made the law of the land in Iran, apostasy
is a capital crime. The clerics might have overlooked those 6o,ooo or
so formally registered, born Baha'is who had neither left the country
nor adopted Islam. But apostasy was something they could not
accept. For one thing, if citizens began feeling it was safe to say they
were Baha'is after having affirmed a primary Muslim identity for
over a decade, then not only might thousands of formerly registered

Baha'is return to their religion, but even the 200,000 or so former
sympathizers with the religion might begin experimenting again with
dual identity. Moreover, the possibility of the religion drawing new
converts from Islam could not be ruled out. Mahrami's boldness
presented the clerics in control of the judicial system with the difficult
choice of either risking the reemergence of the Baha'i faith as at least
an informal religious option for hundreds of thousands of people in
Iran or provoking economic and diplomatic retaliation against Iran
by the world community. They must have likewise been worried
about the underground successes of Christian evangelicals in win-
ning converts in northern Iran and about a renewed secularism, both
of which would have been emboldened if they had allowed apostasy.
The conflict between the radical Islamic republicans among the clerics
and their enemies (the pragmatic conservatives) heated up and began
to involve charges against an old and favourite scapegoat, the
Baha'is.

Mahrami had been summoned to the Islamic Revolutionary Court
in Yazd on 24 July 1995 and came before the court on 6 August 1995.
In this session, he was questioned about his current religious beliefs.
He affirmed he was a Baha'i. The authorities brought Mahrarni back
for three further court sessions. Each time, they requested that he
reconsider, repent, and return to Islam. He repeatedly declined the
invitation. As a result, he was charged with "national apostasy," a
crime specified in the writings of Imam Rohu'llah Khomeini that had
come to have the force of law for judges of the Islamic Republic. The
inextricable intertwining of Shi'ite religion with the Iranian nation is
underlined by this conception of national apostasy. The phrase
implies that abandoning Shi'isrn for any other religion is tantamount
to renouncing Iranian citizenship, or to treason (also a capital crime).
Despite the language of the Gulpaygani document cited above, which
recognized Baha'is as Iranian nationals due the rights of citizenship,
the conception of national apostasy that still dominated judicial think-
ing about them continued to define Baha'is as traitors to the nation.

After Mahrami had chosen a defence lawyer, the 2 January 1 #
court session took place at which he was condemned to death. It is
worthwhile quoting some of the verdict of the Revolutionary Court
in Yazd against him:

Concerning the charges against Mr. Dhabihullah Mahrami, the son of
Gholamreza, i.e. denouncing the blessed religion of Islam and accepting the

> beliefs of the wayward Baha'i sect (national apostasy), in light of his clear
> confessions to the fact that he accepted the wayward Baha'i sect at the age of
> maturity, later accepted Islam for a period of seven years, and then returned
> to the aforementioned sect; and because of the fact that, despite the most
> tremendous efforts of this court to guide him and encourage him to repent
> for having committed the most grievous sin, he remains firm in his baseless
beliefs, he has, on three consecutive meetings, while being of sound body and
mind and in absolute control, announced his allegiance to the principles of
Baha'ism and his belief in the prophethood of Mirza Husayn-Aliy-i-Baha,
he has openly denied the most essential [principle] of Islam (Prophet
Muhammad's being the Seal of the Prophets], and he is not willing to repent
for having committed this sin, the following verdict was issued, based on the
investigations of the Department of Intelligence of the Province of Yazd, and
the damaging consequences of his leaving the true religion of Islam and
rejoining the Baha'i sect, which, according to indisputable principles accepted
by reasonable people, is a clear insult to the beliefs of over one billion Mus-
lims. By applying the tenth definition of "Nijasat" [ritual impurity] to be
found in the first volume of Tahrir ol-Vasileh in defining an infidel and an
apostate, as well as section ten of the book of Al-Mavarith (on the topic of
inheritance) and sections one and four of al-Hudud (on the topic of apostasy)
written by the great founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, His Holiness
Imam Khomeini, the accused is sentenced to death because of being an apostate.
Furthermore, based on section one of al-Mavarith (on the topic of inheritance)
and in light of the fact that he does not have any Muslim heirs, a verdict is
issued for the confiscation of all his properties and assets [Mahrami's wife
and children are Baha'is and this decree would disinherit them].49

Mahrami appealed the death sentence against him to the Supreme
Court in accordance with a 1994 law governing public and revolu-
tionary courts. Amnesty International reported that on 7 March 1996
the organization "received a letter from the Iranian Embassy in
London . . . which stated that the Supreme Court had quashed the
death sentence against Dhabihullah Mahrami and referred the case
back to a lower court for reconsideration." Mahrami's own family,
however, may not have been informed that this was the case. 50 And
then the "reconsideration" turned sinister, as Mahrami continued to
be detained in Yazd while awaiting a new trial in a civilian (rather
than revolutionary) court on the same charges!5 1 This turn of events
suggests some technical flaw in the way the first Yazd Revolutionary
Court proceeded against Mahrami or perhaps a conflict between the

Supreme Court judges in the capital and the provincial revolutionary
officials in Yazd.

The clerics in the Isfahan judiciary drew the same sort of line in
the sand when, in June 1996, they sentenced Musa Talibi to death for
apostatizing from Islam to return to the Baha'i faith, in which he had
been reared. He appealed the sentence but was reportedly told that
it had been confirmed. Talibi had originally been arrested in Isfahan
in October 1994 on charges unrelated to religion and sentenced to ten
years imprisonment. He appealed, and in February 1995 his sentence
was reduced to eighteen months. The prosecutor for the Islamic
Republic objected to the reduction in sentence on the grounds that
Talibi was an apostate, which had not been taken into account by the
courts. The prosecutor's demand for a retrial provoked the June 1996
death sentence. 52 In 1996 there were about 10 Baha'i prisoners of
conscience in Iranian jails, including Mahrarni and Talibi.

On 14 May 1996 Chief Justice Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi gave
an address in the holy city of Qom, in which he alleged that "The
Bahai sect is not a religion, but a web of espionage activities." Here
again, deviant religion and treason to the nation are collapsed into
one another. It should be underlined that the punishment in Iran for
espionage is death. He accused the West of "using the human rights
issue as a means to pressure other countries." He added that Iran
would "never abandon the application of Islamic law just to please
international organizations." He further alleged that recognized
Iranian religious organizations "enjoy freedom of faith."5 3 Given that
the Supreme Court had confirmed the death sentences against
Mithaqi and Khalajabadi the previous February but had in March
overturned Mahrami's death sentence for apostasy, it is difficult to
interpret this speech. Was he announcing a reconsideration of his
leniency toward Mahrami and saying that he was now determined
to see apostates from Islam to the Baha'i faith punished and that he
would attempt to find a fig leaf such as espionage that would not
require an open admission that apostasy is a capital crime in Iran?
Was he throwing down a gauntlet before Rafsanjani, whose govern-
ment, eager for good relations with Western Europe, had been hurt
by the bad publicity over Mahrami? Or was he simply employing
bluster, reminding them that he had reaffirmed the two earlier death
sentences in an attempt to exonerate himself in the eyes of more
radical, provincial clerics who were angry over Mahrami's acquittal?

European human-rights organizations attempted to intervene.

Since Europe traded with Iran and the us did not, Europe was in a
stronger position to apply threats of damage to bilateral relations and
trade if Iran continued to ignore basic human-rights standards. Thus
early in 1997 as the Supreme Court was preparing to make its ruling,
Ruprecht Poienz, an Iranian-affairs specialist and member of the
ruling Christian Democrat Party in the German Parliament, con-
demned the Supreme Court verdict, insisted that it was in fact based
on a charge of apostasy, and warned that Mahrami and Talibi were
in imminent danger of being executed. He noted that as of early 1997,
twelve Baha'is remained in custody as prisoners of conscience. The
German government wrote letters of protest to the Iranian justice and
foreign ministries and also to the Iranian Embassy in Bonn. 54 Polenz's
and others' efforts notwithstanding, on 23 February 1997 a higher
Revolutionary Court affirmed the sentence of death for Talibi and
Mahrami. The Revolutionary Court chief, Ghularn Husayn Rahbarpur,
announced the court's confirmation that the two would be executed
for "spying for the Zionist" regime (i.e., working for the Israeli
intelligence service, Mossad). Because Baha'is have their world head-
quarters in Israel, they are often falsely suspected in the Muslim
world of being espionage agents for Israel.

Rahbarpur vehemently denied that the two had been condemned
merely for their faith, calling such charges "false and fallacious." He
added, "No one could be punished in Iran because of his beliefs or
his religion."55 The clerics in the judiciary had thumbed their noses
at the world community, but the international outcry that ensued
may have tied the hands of the executive branch, which was respon-
sible for actually carrying out the sentence. One Baha'i was killed in
a provincial prison in Iran in 1997, and another, a soldier, was shot
with impunity by his commanding officer that summer. The major
capital cases against Baha'is in the 1990s largely grew not out of
simple adherence or even practice but out of an attempt to reverse a
forced conversion to Islam by returning to the Baha'i fold. The aya-
tollahs clearly feel that strong sanctions against such reverse
apostasies is called for to prevent thousands of reconversions, the
death sentences against Talibi and Mahrami being a case in point.
This use of judicial murder, however, is mainly a holding action and
thus may well fail to intimidate those at whom it is aimed. Talibi and
Mahrami have, at the risk of their own lives, already made the point

that in the post-Khomeini era such reversals of the gains of the radical
religious right are at least conceivable.

Rafsanjani's shift to a more nationalist discourse probably had
some benefits for the Baha'is, who now had to be recognized as owed
the basic rights of Iranian citizens. In contrast, the change appears to
have benefited the Zoroastrians even more positively. The Zoroas-
trian minority was subject to certain constraints, mainly various
forms of local discrimination, under the Khomeinist government. But
its relations with the Rafsanjani government were favourable enough
that it was permitted to hold the sixth Zoroastrian International
Conference in Iran in 1996, a decision that one community represen-
tative said was made "after the fifth Majlis (Parliament) elections,"
probably a reference to the successive weakening of the radical Islarn-
ists.56 The conference was addressed by President Rafsanjani, who
stressed the need for harmony among the religions and cooperation
in the face of Western materialism. He said of Zoroastrianism, "The
canons of the Zoroastrian faith, including monotheism and the neces-
sity of righteous ideas, speech, and behavior are also evident in
Islam." He stressed "freedom of action and a peaceful and tranquil
life for the religious minorities in Islamic Iran."57 The president's
speech was remarkable for its Iranian nativism, evoking a sort of
nationalist pride in Iran's Zoroastrian heritage that was common in
the Pahlevi era and against which the radical Khorneinists had
strongly reacted. In a BBC interview, Zoroastrian leaders vehemently
denied the implication voiced by the correspondent that "Zoroastri-
ans in Iran are under pressure and being intimidated" and that the
conference had been authorized only after years of putting pressure
on the Iranian government.58 A year later in a speech, the Zoroastrian
member of Parliament, Parviz Ravani, commended the Iranian gov-
ernment for curtailing foreign influence in the country and confirmed
that religious minorities in Iran enjoyed freedom of worship and
were allowed to publish their community magazines. He added that
"all religious minorities in Iran seriously confront any act of treason
against the Islamic government and the nation."59 Although, of
course, all such official speeches and statements must be approached
cautiously, it certainly appears to be the case that Zoroastrians
enjoyed a warmth in their relations with the central Iranian govern-
ment during Rafsanjani's second term that was missing with regard
to Jews or non-Armenian Christians and that is quite different from
the Islamic Republic's hostility to the Baha'is.

The second Rafsanjani term witnessed a renewed power struggle
between the far right and the conservative pragmatists, in which the
religious minorities often became pawns. Apostasy emerged as the
primary issue seized upon by the reactionaries and the radical
populists with which to menace the religious minorities. Radical
frustration with the pragmatist status quo led to the assassination of
prominent pastors and apostates by death squads. The radicals and
reactionaries were reduced merely to defending the gains they had
made in the 19gos and were unable to return to launching large-scale
pogroms or judicial murders against the minorities. Moreover, after
1993 the Iranian electorate began shifting substantially to the left,
leaving the radicals and reactionaries in the judiciary and high cler-
ical office increasingly isolated and putting pragmatists and relative
liberals in power in Parliament and the presidency from 1996 to 1997.
The continued economic difficulties in Iran left it in greater than ever
need of foreign investment and good relations with the European
Community. Thus the international outcry over the persecution of
the apostates from select religious minorities made it difficult for the
executive branch to carry out the judicial murders occasionally
ordered by the clerical judges, and it appears even to have in some
instances dissuaded the Supreme Court from concurring in judg-
ments passed on apostates by provincial courts.

THE    KHATAMI        PERIOD

In 1997, when the mood of the Iranian electorate unexpectedly swung
to the liberal side, the dark-horse candidate Ayatollah Muhammad
Khatami was elected with nearly 70 per cent of the vote. Khatami, a
former minister of culture under Rafsanjani in the early 1990s who
had been forced by reactionaries and radicals in Parliament to resign
for being too liberal, was unexpectedly allowed to run for president
by the Council of Guardians. He became a favourite candidate among
youth, women, and the urban middle class. Having lived in Germany,
where he had made a serious study of German philosopher Jurgen
Habermas's work on civil society, Khatami incorporated the idea of
the need for active citizens' organizations at the grass roots into his
political ideology. Since both reactionaries and radicals favoured
strong state control and regulation of such intermediate organiza-
tions, he was bound to come into conflict with them. Khatami also
pursued an opening to the West and even called for dialogue and

contact between the Iranian citizenry and Americans on a nongov-
ernmental level.

The Khatami presidency provoked an extensive polarization of
Iranian society and politics that was much more extreme than what
had occurred early in Rafsanjani' s second term. Liberals like 'Abdu'l-
Karim Suroush were emboldened to speak to large crowds of stu-
dents on subjects like freedom of speech and conscience and openly
to question the whole idea of theocracy. Ayatollah Muntaziri openly
challenged the idea of the Guardianship of the Jurisprudent and was
threatened with jail time by Supreme Jurisprudent 'Ali Khamenei. In
the summer of 1999, liberal students mounted large demonstrations
in the capital. In response, radicals and reactionaries interrupted
Suroush's speeches with heckling and violence, opponents of
Khatami in the Ministry of Intelligence conducted a series of assas-
sinations against prominent liberal and secular intellectuals in the
fall of 19g8 and the summer of 1999, and student demonstrations
were infiltrated by agents provocateurs from the basij, who commit-
ted acts of violence in hopes of turning the public against the student
activists.

Minorities of conscience have been among the chief victims of this
new polarization. As mentioned, a string of secular-leaning and lib-
eral intellectuals were assassinated in the fall of 1998. Some twenty
members of the Baha'i faith were in jail in 1998. On 21 July 1998, a
Baha'i, Ruhu'llah Rawhani, was executed in Mashhad on charges of
converting a Muslim woman to the religion (a charge she denied).
Rawhani, 52, a medical-supplies salesman and father of four, had
been imprisoned in September 1997. He was never formally sen-
tenced, was given no access to legal counsel, and was summarily
executed.6o It seems likely that provincial radicals acted in this hasty
and arbitrary fashion precisely to avoid interference from the Khatami
government in Tehran, which might have resulted in Rawhani being
left for years on death row or even being released rather than exe-
cuted. In late September 1998, Ministry of Information officials raided
500 private homes of Baha'is and arrested thirty-six Baha'is in a
number of cities, charging them with teaching informally in the
Baha'i "Open University," an institution set up by the community to
circumvent the ban on Baha'i students attending university in Iran
that had graduated some 140 students in the 19905. The purge of
Baha'i professors in the 19Bos had left many with time on their hands
and a willingness to teach their specialties in their own homes. The

professors were eventually released, many only after they pledged
to dose the Open University. 61 Reza Afshari provides a useful sum-
mary of the situation in the late 1990s:

Limitations on travel abroad were still in place, although some Baha'is
succeeded in receiving limited exit permits. The problems faced by Baha'i
physicians and lawyers continued unabated. No bank credit was made avail-
able to Baha'i applicants. Baha'i marriages and divorces were not legally
recognized, nor was a right to inheritance, a situation Ann Mayer has aptly
described as "civil death." The properties of a deceased Baha'i would go to
the state if there were no Muslims in the family. The regime continued
denying the Baha'is retirement pensions. 62

Members of other religions suffered in the early Khatami period as
well. Some twenty Muslim converts to Christianity disappeared
between 1997 and 1998 when authorities learned of their baptisms.
In May 1998 Jewish businessman Ruhu'llah Kadkhuda-Zadih was
summarily executed, possibly for helping Iranian Jews flee the coun-
try. And in March 1999 thirteen Jews were arrested and charged with
espionage, charges that human-rights analysts generally found
implausible on the basis of the information released by the Iranian
government. Even Shi'ites, such as members of Sufi orders, reported
increasing persecution between 19g8 and 1999.63

Although Khatami's election signalled the desire of a broad swathe
of Iranian society for a certain amount of liberalization, the late 1990s
were not noticeably better for religious minorities than before.
Khatami's victory galvanized radicals and reactionaries into attack-
ing him by scapegoating outspoken liberal intellectuals and members
of religious minorities. Khatami, although president, did not control
the armed forces, the police, the basij, or even some ministries, such
as the Ministry of Intelligence, nor could he always count on the
support of Parliament. He was therefore not in a position to push
liberalization very far or very fast and was opposed by powerful
enemies who often controlled substantial resources, including armed
forces. If Iran really does move toward greater liberalization in the
coming years, it is unlikely to be without a fight, and the religious
minorities are likely to be in the crossfire. Baha'is continue to be
branded national apostates by the radical populists and to be sub-
jected to arbitrary arrest and punishment. They are excluded from
national institutions and widely considered spies for foreign powers

(despite the lack of any credible evidence for such charges). They are
in an even more precarious situation than Iranian Jews, who have
faced similar espionage charges on occasion.

CON CL US ION

The position of the Baha'is as members of the Iranian nation has been
in dispute throughout the modern period. As early as the Constitu-
tional Revolution, measures were enacted by a supposedly progres-
sive and newly established Parliament to exclude them from political
participation. Still, in the Pahlevis' secularizing form of Iranian
nationalism, Baha'is had begun to find a precarious (and sometimes
unsavoury) niche. The rise of Khomeinism knocked them off this
perch rather decisively. Official Khomeinist discourse rejected the
idea of the modern nation-state altogether and aimed at a Pan-Islamic
union of the Muslim peoples across ethnic and linguistic, even across
sectarian-Muslim, divides. In such a system, the only recognized
position for non-Muslim religious minorities would be that of dhim-
mis, or protected communities. Such a status was accorded Jews,
Christians, and Zoroastrians but was not available for a post-Islamic
religion such as the Baha'i faith. Baha'is were denied any claim to
belonging to a religion at all; instead, they were depicted as compris-
ing a political party created and fostered by British colonialism and
Israeli imperialism that had no specifically religious character. They
were equated with organized atheism, and their adherents were
defined as apostates from Islam (although significant portions of the
community originated with conversions from Judaism and Zoroas-
trianism in the nineteenth century and thus had never apostatized).
The Baha'is experienced civil death under Khomeinism, facing exe-
cution if prominent, imprisonment if vocal, and harassment in daily
life. Baha'i marriages were redefined as prostitution, and those offic-
ers of the local spiritual assembly who conducted them were rede-
fined as pimps. Parents were charged with endangerment of minors
for bringing them up as Baha'is, and their children were sometimes
confiscated and raised as Muslims. They were fired from government
jobs and expelled from the universities and finally even from the
cemeteries. No institution over which the Iranian Muslim state had
direct control could tolerate Baha'is given that they were civilly dead.

Along with the official Khomeinist rhetoric of Muslims vs infidels,
some Muslim fundamentalists gave a more central position to Iran

and the Iranian nation but identified both with Islam. This Iranian
nationalist form of Islamism became more appealing in the course of
the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88, when much of the Arab Muslim world
supported secularist Iraq against Khomeini, profoundly disappoint-
ing Khomeini's ecumenical hopes. It has been argued that Rafsanjani,
in power from 1989 to 1997, rehabilitated the discourse of Iranian
nationalism. It was increasingly denied that Baha'is were persecuted
because of their conscientious beliefs. It was alleged not only that
they were spies for foreign powers, but also that they were national
apostates, defectors from the Iranian Muslim nation. Still, the execu-
tions slowed dramatically, and the terms of imprisonment shrank to
a few weeks, with hundreds of Baha'is being rotated in and out as a
means of serial harassment rather than languishing behind bars for
long periods of time. The key capital crime for which Baha'is were
charged under positive law now became not abstract apostasy but
the real thing. It was made clear that those Baha'is who converted
under duress to Islam in the 1980s would not be allowed to revert to
the Baha'i faith without facing the executioner. Nor would prosely-
tizing other such "new-Muslims" to return them to the Baha'i faith
be allowed.

Gulpaygani's document of the early 1990s laid out a plan for the
extermination of the Baha'i faith in Iran not through a physical
holocaust but through gradual attrition. Ordinary Baha'is would be
granted some of the usual rights of Iranian citizenship. In some areas
of life, their civil death was annulled, although it remained their lot
in many other spheres. They could not be deprived of life and prop-
erty arbitrarily - that is, just for being (inactive) Baha'is. They could
again marry and have families without being unduly bothered. But
they could not go to university or perhaps even finish high school.
Even informal institutions of education inside the community were
closed, forcing Baha'is into the ranks of the day labourers and the
indigent. They could not hold government jobs or teaching positions.
They were denied the respectability of holding professions. They
could not even be properly buried. The icons of the nation - the
bureaucracy, the university, the cemetery - were declared off limits
to them. The areas of civil life that could in any way be seen as
privileges bestowed by the state were denied to them. The hope was
clearly that a dynamic middle-class community, finding such a fate
intolerable, would convert to Islam to escape it. The Baha'is were to
be akin to members of India's lowest castes in the old days - that is,

permanently relegated to the status of low-ranking outsiders. Yet the
Gulpaygani document recognized them as Iranians of a bizarre sort,
not as Muslim Iranians or dhimmi Iranians, but still as Iranians. It
made a place for them in the body public, however abject, that
Khomeini's divide between Muslims and heretics could not have
abided. As the Iranian nation reemerged in the 19gos within the
discourse of Islamic republicanism, the Baha'is were at least some-
what renationalized. However, only in relation to the dire pogroms
of the 1980s was their position much improved.

The two approaches - that of seeing the Baha'is as dangerous
heretics who must be destroyed and that of seeing them as outcasts
with Iranian citizenship who merely had to be curbed - coexisted
into the late 1990s. Each of these views remained prominent in certain
institutional settings. Because Rafsanjani and the pragmatic conser-
vatives, along with Khatarni's later reformers, wanted World Bank
loans and international recognition, they had reason to put the Baha'i
issue on the back burner. By comparison, the radical right-wing
populists continued to seek political power within the country by
scapegoating the Baha'is. Many of the specific legal cases initiated
against Baha'is and members of other religious minorities appear to
originate with local, provincial courts controlled by radical right-
wing populists, who increasingly lost power in the realm of elective
government and were therefore left with the judiciary as their pri-
mary means of influencing society. In some instances, the judgments
of the provincial courts have been overturned by the Supreme Court
despite its dominance by figures such as Yazdi, a radical right-wing
populist himself. In other instances, the Supreme Court has called for
the death sentence, but the executive branch, controlled first by con-
servative theocrats and after 1997 increasingly by liberal theocrats,
has declined actually to implement it, leaving the accused (mainly
those convicted of being apostates from Islam) on death row for long
periods of time. Frustration over their frequent inability to secure
actual executions of those charged in the provincial courts appears
to have encouraged the radical theocrats to resort to death squads
and vigilante tactics, resulting in the murders of several prominent
evangelical pastors, Sunni activists, and Baha'is.

It is not unusual for nationalism to be construed so as to exclude
some communities from the nation despite their long-standing resi-
dence on national territory. As Partha Chatterjee has noted, the more

The Baha'i 11.1inority and Nationalism in Contemporary Iran    159

virulent forms of Hindu nationalism in India define Indian Muslims
as foreign invaders - that is, essentially as illegal aliens - even though
most are converts from Hinduism and their families have lived in
what is now India for centuries if not millennia. White Protestant
nationalism in the United States has sought to exclude Catholics
and blacks and Jews from the American nation. The Nazis defined
German Jews not as fellow Germans but as a pollution of German
purity. The Iranian Muslim nationalism of Khomeini's successors can
therefore be identified as a form of this sort of exclusionary nation-
alism. As Eliz Sanasarian notes, "This was the unique by-product of
the theocratic system. The 'aqaliat' [religious minority] was 'the
other,' 'the marginal,' 'the separate from us'; it was an institutional-
ized 'otherness' which was disturbing and different." She adds,
"Before 1979, everyone was an 'Irani' albeit in pretense; after the
Revolution, Irani was replaced by aqaliat, Bahai and Sunni."64 All
nations comprise such religious and ethnic communities, but, as
Hobsbawm has argued,6 5 civic nations make a place for them as
constituents of the nation, whereas exclusionary nations achieve their
unity precisely by singling out the unabsorbable minority within as
a cultural and political fifth column. Islamically based nationalisms,
as Ofra Bengio and Gabriel Ben-Dor argued after Bernard Lewis, 66
tend to be exclusionary in this way. Chatterjee has also shown that
religious nationalisms, such as those of the Rashtrya Swayamsevak
Sangh in India and Khomeinisrn in Iran, are no less "modem" than
secular nationalism. Religious nationalism insists on a singular
majoritarian source of identity, such that India must be Hindu and
Iran Shi'ite. "Islam here is either the history of foreign conquest or a
domesticated element of everyday popular life," Chatterjee observes.
"None of these answers, however, can admit that the Indian nation
as a whole might have a claim on the historical legacy of Islam." 67
A pluralist conception of the nation, which takes pride in its varie-
gated strands and gives civil equality to all citizens, is the only sort
of nationalism that can hope to avoid the virulent pathologies wit-
nessed in the twentieth century. Iranians would have to admit that
they might have a claim on the historical legacy of the Baha'i faith
and vice versa. Khatami and his reforming supporters often speak as
though they seek to make Iran a civic nation. Yet they or their
successors cannot hope to do so as long as thousands of Iranians
remain under the sentence of civil death.
