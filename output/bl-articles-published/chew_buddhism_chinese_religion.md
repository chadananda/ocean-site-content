       Brothers and Sisters: Buddhism in the
Family of Chinese Religion

Phyllis Ghim-Lian Chew

Abstract

Confucianism is often referred to as the "Chinese Great Tradition" and
hailed for imbuing Chinese civilisation with humanitarian values. Yet its
endurance and sustainable power for 2,000 years is in part ascribed to its
two sisters, Buddhism and Taoism, which were content for the most part
to play a subordinate role. Confucianism acknowledged their vitality but
kept them in the wings, conscious always that its privileged position as
elder brother not be infringed upon. In this way, periodically encouraged,
tolerated, and persecuted, the ecclesiastical personnel and structure of
Taoism and Buddhism survived into modern times. Eventually, the sisters
no longer asserted themselves, content with the hearts and allegiance of
the masses while relegating state power to Confucianism. This paper
examines Buddhism's role in the family of Chinese religions as well as
the implications of its role in relation to new religions in China.

1\. Introduction

It is often claimed that Confucius was the greatest and most significant
unifying force of Chinese civilisation. In fact, Confucianism (Ju Chiao) is
synonymous with what is known as the "Chinese Great Tradition". It was
the official philosophy of China for about two thousand years until the
birth of the Republic of China in 1911. Through the influential education
system, teachers succeeded in inculcating Confucian values into the minds
of young people. The term Confucianism embraces education, letters,
ethics and political philosophy. The large family system with its special
emphasis on filial and fraternal obedience, for example, was heavily
influenced by Confucian ideals and continues to be a dominant factor in

Chinese society. Thus, the Chinese outlook on life has been immensely
coloured by Confucian ideas, which have been formulated since
Confucius' day into a governing code of etiquette and morality.

Although Confucius only claimed to be a transmitter of knowledge,
temples have been built in his name. Indeed, his name became a religion
among the learned of China who were the officials and the literati and
who included scholars waiting for official appointments. The philosophy
became in all meaning and purposes a "religion", with its classics its
scriptures, its schools its churches, its teachers its priest, and its ethics its
theology.

Its endurance and spiritual power may in part be ascribed to its two
sisters, Buddhism and Taoism, which were content for the most part to
play a subordinate role to their elder brother. Confucianism borrowed
their vitality and kept them in the wings, conscious always that its
privileged position as elder brother not be infringed upon. Periodically
encouraged, tolerated, and persecuted, the ecclesiastical personnel and
structure of Taoism and Buddhism survived into the modern day. In time,
the sisters no longer questioned this role, as they were able to capture the
heart and allegiance of the Chinese masses. The older brother honoured
the gods of the sisters and the sisters in turn incorporated many of their
brother's principles and priorities. Through the passage of time, Taoist,
Buddhist and Confucian gods all came to be united in the same temple
and formed one whole. Though they were different in origin and
emphasis, they came to view themselves as having one and the same
object.

Of the two sisters, this article will focus on the older and foreign one, that
is, Buddhism. Buddhism's relationship with Confucianism and Taoism in
the religious history of China will be examined. This is of special interest
to the Baha'i Faith because in the Chinese religious trilogy, only
Buddhism is recognised as a revealed religion and Buddha, a
Manifestation of God. 'Abdu'1-Bahá's authoritative interpretations of
Baha'u'llah's writings state that the Buddha originally established the
oneness of God and a new religion.1 However, he cautions that while
Buddha was a Manifestation of God, like Christ, His followers do not

possess His authentic Writings.2 Where Confucius was concerned,
Baha'is regard him as the cause of civilisation, advancement and
prosperity for the people of China.3 He was a "cause and illumination of
the world of humanity."4 'Abdu'1-Bahá also said: "Confucius was not a
Prophet. It is quite correct to say he is the founder of a moral system and
a great reformer."5 In like manner, Baha'is do not consider Lao-tzu a
prophet.

There is another reason to take a closer look at Buddhism. First, its impact
was great enough for Chinese itself to become an essential language of the
Buddhist religious canon, since translations have survived where the
originals have not. As early as 166 CE, we find a record of Emperor Huan
installing statues of Huang-Lao (a god synthesised from the Yellow
Emperor Huang-ti, a prehistoric immortal and Lao-tzu) and of the Buddha
within his palace. Many Buddhist texts from Sanskrit and other Indie and
Central Asian languages have been translated into Chinese and these have
been disseminated far and wide in China. Second, stories from the Lotus
Sutra are dominant features on the walls of popular temples, while
religious preachers, popular storytellers and lower-class dramatists have
always drawn on the rich trove of mythology provided by Buddhist
narratives. Last but not least, Chinese Buddhism has survived the Cultural
Revolution.

2\. Reasons for the Spread of Buddhism

Many scholars have been puzzled as to the ease and extent to which
Buddhism, a foreign religion, has spread to China. Its Chinese reference,
Fojiao (teachings of Buddha) involves the recognition that this teaching,
unlike the other two, (Daojiao, teachings of the Tao, and Rujiao,
teachings of the scholars) originated in a foreign land. While Ru refers to

a group of people and Dao refers to a concept, Fo does not make literal
sense - it represents a sound, a word with no semantic value - after the
Chinese Sanskrit word "Buddha". Yet Buddhism became widespread not
only in China but the surrounding regions and it enjoys a perennial appeal.
Many reasons can be established for this unusual phenomenon but only
four will be discussed here. They are the Chinese intrinsic interest in
gods, Buddhism's familiarity to the Chinese people, its explanation of the
after-life and its ability to acquire state support.

2\.1 The Interest in gods

The Chinese people have always been intensely interested in things seen
and unseen. Where the unseen is concerned, there is a lively interest in
myths, which portray a fascination with the riddle of existence. Take for
example, the popular and colourful stories of Wang Mu, the Western
Queen. Storytellers have vied with one another in fantastic descriptions of
the wonders of her fairyland, and the repairing of the heavens by Nii Kua
Shih with five-coloured stones and the great tortoise, which supports the
universe.

There is evidence to believe that there have been ancient religions
practised in China, the details of which we no longer possess. Perhaps this
may explain why in China's long history, we find sacrifices to heaven, the
hills and rivers, ancestors and spirits. In traditional Chinese towns and
villages, there is an abundance of village and wayside temples and shrines
to honour their ancestors. The gods of thunder, rain, wind, grain, and
agriculture abound in the lives of peasants. The later emergence of
Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism added more temples, monasteries,
priests, sacrifices and rituals to the Chinese landscape. Shoghi Effendi, the
Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, explained that: "The only reason there is not
more mention of the Asiatic prophets is because their names seem to be
lost in the mists of ancient history... we are taught there always have been
Manifestations of God, but we do not have any record of their names."7

A typical Chinese funeral will also bear testimony to the Chinese
fascination with the things of the spirit. There is a three-tiered world view:

of heaven above, the dead below, and earth, the abode of the living m
between. On death, the upper soul (hun) rises up to heaven while the
lower soul (p'o) descends to earth. There are also other festivals, for
example, the New Year festival, celebrated with extravagance and
grandeur so as to mark a passage not just in the life of the individual and
the family, but also in the annual cycle of the cosmos. Last but not least,
there is the traditional Chinese practice of consulting a spirit medium in
the home or small temples for solutions to some sickness or misfortune.
Dream divination and manipulating the hexagrams of the I Ching is still
practised as a way to allow people to understand the pattern of the
universe as a whole and also the concept of Yin-Yang.

2\.2 The Familiarity of Buddhism

Buddhism took a firm grip on the Chinese mind because many of its
subsequent practices form a familiar landscape.8 For example, Buddhist
shrines were very similar to the existing shamanistic shrines to deities.
Many of these shrines would contain some icon or relic of a Chinese
Buddhist monk and this was something reminiscent of shamanistic and
Taoist practices. Buddhist temples, similar to earlier native temples
became places where people would meet to celebrate festivals. Buddhism
also affirmed values of filial piety, longevity and posterity by, for
example, allowing the building of stupas9 to be a means of preserving the
memory of parents. In time, local deities were incorporated into the
Buddhist pantheon and Buddhist deities incorporated into the existing
local pantheon.10 Indeed, many Buddhist shrines and complexes were so
like shamanistic and Taoist shrines that it was hard to tell one from the
other. In addition, Taoist ideas and expressions were used in the
translation of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese, resulting in a blending of
Indian and Chinese thought.11 The first translations of Buddhist sutras into
Chinese - namely those dealing with such topics as breathing control and
mystical concentration - utilised a Taoist vocabulary to make the

\[8\] J. Ching, (1989) argues that this is the main reason why Buddhism survived in China,
that is, it did so by essentially serving Chinese goals including Confucian family values.
Its monastic life was, however, criticized by the Confucians.

Buddhist faith intelligible to the Chinese. For example, the Buddhist terms
dharma and yoga were both translated using the Chinese word tao;
nirvana was translated as wu wei. This resulted in a fusion of Taoist and
Buddhist ideas.

It is pertinent here to note that it is the Mahayana rather than Theravada
version of Buddhism which made inroads into China. The Mahayana
version was attractive for various reasons. First, there was the teaching of
the universal accessibility of Buddhahood. This was very much like the
universal accessibility of the goal of sagehood in Confucianism, a concept
which was easily understood. Second, the Chinese liked the idea of a
bodhisattva (including the lay bodhisattva as in the Vimalakiirti sutra), a
saviour figure who refrains from entering Nirvana in order to help more
people. This reminded them of the noble Confucian sage who "returns to
the people what they have lost" and "helps all things find their nature" 12.
The Buddhist doctrine of compassion (karuna) could also be related to the
Confucian yen, the concept of the ideal relationship among human beings.
In addition, the Chinese appreciated the Buddhist explanation of suffering,
something which was not expounded in Confucianism and Taoism. While
suffering is something to be escaped from in Theravada teaching, in
Mahayana teaching, suffering becomes meaningful and is a means of
salvation.13

Mahayana Buddhism's message of salvation was of great appeal to the
masses, many of whom led a life of great poverty and hardship. While
Theravada's doctrine is atheistic with no anthropomorphic god, the
Mahayana doctrine turned the human Buddha into an eternal and supreme
deity presiding over the world and offering salvation to all. The Mahayana
version makes it possible for a believer to pray and worship as a means of
pleasing God and in so doing, achieving salvation. In addition, there was
no necessity to leave the family to live in the monastery or to live an
ascetic life.

\[12\] H. Maurer, Tao, the Way of the Ways, chap. 64.

\[13\] This is similar to the Baha'i faith in that Baha'u'llah teaches that suffering tempers the
individual and makes him realise his vulnerability and spiritual needs: "The true lover
yearneth for tribulation even as doth the rebel for forgiveness and the sinful for mercy."
(Baha'u'llah, Arabic Hidden Words, No. 49)

Buddhism in the Family of Chinese Religion           9

Much relief was offered for the masses m the form of Mahayana
personalities who had human features. For example, if a bodhisattva
vowed to liberate all beings from suffering, that bodhisattva was also the
object of devotion. Bodhisattvas such as Manjusri, the bodhisattva of
wisdom; Ksitgarbha who, as Jizo, in Japan rescues children, born and
unborn; Maitreya, the bodhisattva who will become the next Buddha; and
most of all Avolokitesvara, who took the female form as Guanyin in
China and Kannon in Japan and who in Tibet, takes the human form in the
succession of Dalai Lamas. According to Ching (1989), the Bodhisattva
Guanyin is probably a response to a popular need for a protectress, one
not a mother herself, but who listens and responds effectively to the
prayers of would-be mothers.14

Some of the intelligentsia was also converted to Buddhism. This is not
surprising because once the voluminous scriptures of Buddhism were
translated into Chinese, people found in them a depiction of the world
incomparably broader than that found in the six Chinese classics. The
vivid accounts of human emotion, volition and psychology found in the
Buddhist scriptures were also far more complex and richer than that
handed down by the sages.

2\.3 The Accounting of the Afterlife

One reason for the popular appeal of Buddhism (and religious Taoism)
was the irresistible human desire for immortality. Buddhism taught the
indestructibility of the soul and the attainment of nirvana as a kind of
immortality. The idea was so appealing that a popular Chinese sect, the
Pure Land Buddhists, also introduced the notion of rebirth not into heaven
or hell, but directly into the "Pure Land of Bliss" established by Amitabha
Buddha. These pure lands are described in elaborate detail in certain
Mahayana sutras, which tell of the variety of jewels, the streams of water,
and soothing breezes. Rebirth in one of these heavenly pure lands
(buddhaksetra) is the goal of Buddhist practice in India, China and Japan.
Pure lands are not a permanent paradise but a realm devoted to the
nurturance of the Buddhist Faith. It is the ideal environment in which to
achieve Buddhist enlightenment and eventually, Nirvana.

10         THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

Buddhist (and Taoist) funeral ceremonies also involve the symbolic
transfer of goods, made out of paper to the next world. There is a belief
that the physical and spiritual worlds are interconnected. In Chinese
mythology, the journey imagery is seen through the cline of existence.
Immorality and morality are often blurred, and there are degrees of both
states. Spiritual powers attributed to monks and nuns seemed to threaten
the core value of the Chinese family system. The interdependent nature of
the relationship between lay people and the professionally religious is
seen in such phenomena as the kinship terminology - an attempt to
recreate family - amongst monks and nuns, lay donors and monastic
officials in a wide range of rituals designed to bring comfort to ancestors.

In contrast, for the Confucian literati, the question of whether life exists
after death is always carefully left out of the discussion. As Tzu-kung
(520-450 BC) said, "We cannot hear our Master's views on human nature
and the Way of Heaven". In the first century AD Wang Ch'ung, one of
the more critical and influential philosophers in Chinese history, wrote a
treatise to disprove the existence of spiritual beings. In the 5th century,
Fan Chen (450 BC) attacked the Buddhist belief in immortality. Neo-
Confucianists, from the 12th century onwards, have unanimously attacked
both the Taoist and Buddhist belief in everlasting life. The main concern
for Confucians was not whether man had a soul but rather how to put this
distinctively human quality to good use.

2\.4 State Support

The influence of Buddhism was also due to the fact that it enjoyed state
support at certain periods in Chinese history. The conversion of a
Parthian prince (c 148-170 CE) named An Shih-kao, for example, greatly
accelerated the growth of Buddhism. Later, in 401 AD, the Chinese court
commissioned the Indian monk, Kumárajiva, to do the monumental
translations of the Hindu Vedas, the occult sciences and astronomy, as
well as to standardize the Hinayana and Mahayana sutras. During the 5 th
and 6l centuries AD, new specifically Chinese Buddhist schools began to
form. Monastic establishments proliferated and Buddhism became well
established among the peasantry.

Buddhism in the Family of Chinese Religion              11

The collapse of the Han dynasty m 220 CE caused China to lapse into
disunion and to break into small warring states for four centuries. Political
disunion caused the political power of Confucianism to collapse and this
opened the door to the rapid spread of Buddhist ideas. Many kings of
small states became nominal Buddhists and sought to replace Confucian
influence with Buddhist influence. This was especially so in the northern
Chinese states, which were keen to reject Confucianism, as it represented
the regimes they had toppled. During the Sui dynasty (581-618 AD),
Buddhism flourished as a state religion.

The Tang dynasty (618-906 AD) was the golden age of Chinese
Buddhism. This period witnessed a flowering of translation activity. The
most famous was Hsiian-tsang, pilgrim and translator, who brought back
to China hundreds of sutras. Although T'ang emperors were usually
Taoists, they tended to favour Buddhism, which had become extremely
popular and which was similar to Taoism in many of its metaphysical
principles. Under the T'ang, the government extended its control over the
monasteries as well as the ordination and legal status of monks. From this
time onward, the Chinese monk styled himself simply "ch'en" or
"subject". During this period, several Chinese schools developed their
own distinctive approaches and there was a comprehensive systemization
of the vast body of Buddhist texts. This was a period when many
monasteries were built. It was also a period when many scholars made
pilgrimages to India, heroic journeys that greatly enriched Buddhism in
China, both by the texts that were acquired and the intellectual and
spiritual inspiration that came with them.

Emperor Wu (c. 502-549) is best remembered by posterity for his lavish
patronage of the Buddhist religion.15 Indeed, he himself was the author of
a short treatise entitled Shen-ming ch 'eng-fo I-chi, which contains some of
the standard Chinese Buddhist arguments for the existence of the eternal
soul.      He was also a fervent student of the Mahay ana
Mdhaparinirvdnasutra, having commissioned Pao-liang and Fa-lang of
the Chien-yuan temple to compile commentaries for it. To summarise, the
Tang period saw unprecedented numbers of ordinations into the ranks of
the Buddhist order, the flourishing of the new allegedly "Chinese' school
of thought and lavish support from the state.

\[15\] See his poem on the three religions, in Tao-hsuan (c. 596-667).

3\. The Relegation of Buddhism to the Background

We come now to an interesting paradox. If Buddhism was so attractive
and appealing to both the literati and the masses, why has it adopted a
secondary position? Why is the "Great Chinese Tradition" more
Confucian than Buddhist? Four reasons can be found to explain this
unusual phenomenon: the association of Confucianism with state power,
the emergence of Neo-Confucianism, the nature of sinitic Mahayana
Buddhism and the lack of unity among the myriad Buddhist groups.

3\.1 Confucianism and State Power

One reason Confucianism lasted as long as it did was because, over time,
it became synonymous with state power. Confucianism shaped the
bureaucracy which supported the system of absolute monarchy and the
bureaucracy itself was the institutional embodiment of the Confucian
tradition. The bureaucracy was under the emperor, who was the founder
or descendant of a founder whose virtue enabled him to take over from a
previous corrupt ruler. He ruled by the principle of the "mandate of
heaven" (Tianming), that is, he was conceived as a semi-divine force and
carried out the commands of heaven. Over the ages, Confucian moral
values have often been politicised to serve an oppressive authoritarian
regime. The virtue of loyalty to the state was exploited because it
contributed to the social and political ideology, which kept the emperor in
power. Emperors found that Confucianism rather than Taoism or
Buddhism served their political needs better because of its emphasis on
decorum and rationalised orderliness. For example, the five obligations:
between the sovereign and subject, father and son, husband and wife,
elder and younger brother and between friends helped keep peace and
order in society.

The bureaucracy was all-powerful in traditional Chinese society. The
chief official responsible for a county was a magistrate, selected from a
central pool on the basis of his performance in the state examination
system. He was responsible for employing lower-level functionaries e.g.
scribes, clerks, sheriffs and tax-keepers. He reported to superiors and

followed their orders. He made offerings at a variety of officially
recognised temples and to local deified heroes, gave lectures to residents
on morality and watched over religious activities especially those whose
actions threatened the sovereignty and the prerogatives of the state.

Any religion then that posed a threat to the great power of Confucianism
was periodically persecuted. Perhaps the major one was that led by
Emperor Wu-tsung in 845 AD. According to records, 4,600 Buddhist
temples and 40,000 shrines were destroyed and 260,500 monks forced to
return to lay life.16 There was persecution, not just against religionists but
also against philosophers who deferred from the main ideological stream.
For example, followers of Mo Tzu were persecuted because Mo Tzuism
closely resembled the anthropomorphism of Christianity. In this
philosophy, we find Heaven (which was anthropomorphically regarded.by
Mo Tzu as a personal Supreme Being) creating the sun, moon and
innumerable stars. On the other hand, the philosophy of Mo Tzu's
contemporary, Mencius, was exalted because the latter's chief concern
was to eulogize the doctrines of the great Confucius, and like his master,
Mencius preferred to let the origin of the universe look after itself.

3\.2 The Emergence of Neo-Confucianism

After a period of decline during the Tang dynasty, the Sung dynasty (960-
1279 AD) saw a revival of Confucianism which was sufficiently different
from earlier Confucianism to merit the term "neo-Confucianism". The
neo-Confucianists realised that the only way to revive Confucianism was
to plug its deficiency with regards to its metaphysical foundation. It was
in their vested interest after all to preserve and strengthen their
bureaucratic office and high social prestige with the formalisation and
spread of Confucianism. Accordingly, the neo-Confucianists tried to
attain a firm metaphysical basis for its ethical ideas by looking into a
scientific theory of the origin of the universe and man. Sung scholars
secularised Buddhist and Taoist mystical ideas and used them as starting
points to establish a systematic ontology and cosmology as the
metaphysical foundation for Confucian ethics.

See the New Encyclopaedia Britannia under "Buddhism", pp. 273-4.

To ensure that Confucianism remained the bedrock and that its sister
philosophies of Taoism and Buddhism remained as helpers and
companions, many temples were built in honour of Confucius. In these
temples, the chief disciples and distinguished Confucians of later ages
were also honoured. Above the altars were the words, "The teacher of
10,000 generations". Only scholars could take part in the sacrifices.
Emperor T'ai-tsu (960-976 AD) of the Sung dynasty made regular
sacrifices to Confucius. Emperor Chen-tsung (997-1022 AD) who claimed
to have had frequent heavenly visitations set a precedent by prostrating to
Confucius at the temple in Lu. In 1012, Emperor Chen-tsung also
bestowed on Confucius the title "most perfect sage".17

The neo-Confucians also wrote many polemical works against Taoism
and Buddhism, especially on the topics of rebirth and karma which found
no correspondence in Confucian teachings. Generally, neo-Confucians
criticised Buddhism as metaphysically nihilistic and therefore amoral.
They felt that sobre reason was superior to what was perceived as the
superstitious or spiritualistic obsession and imaginative invention of both
Buddhism and Taoism. Chu Hsi's (1130-1200) critique of Ch'an
Buddhism in particular was devastating. Chu Hsi accused Buddhism of
failing to tackle everyday socio-moral problems, which, in his Neo-
Confucian judgement, only the Confucian tradition was able to resolve
completely and perfectly.18 There were also attacks on the Ch'an
teachings of "sudden awakening" and accusations that Ch'an had
completely neglected the importance of the necessary and gradual life-
long cultivation of man's moral and social nature.

What was ironical in the neo-Confucian movement was that in its attempts
to stem the popularity of its sister traditions, it drew much inspiration
from them. Neo-Confucianist, Lu Hsiang-shan (Lu Chiu-yuan), for
example, stressed that truth is a result of experiencing "sudden
enlightenment", a Buddhist concept. He also argued that the goal of
enlightenment is the attainment of the supreme knowledge of self and the

\[17\] See N. F. Gier, On the Deification of Confucius, Asian Philosophy, pp. 43-45.

\[18\] Chu Hsi may be said to be the most influential Neo-Confucian and he has been
compared to a Chinese Spinoza or St. Thomas Aquinas. His interpretation of
Confucianism was accepted as official philosophy and served the interests of feudalistic
dynasties for over 700 years (from the late Southern Sung (1127-1279) to the end of the
Ch'ing dynasty (1644-1912).

world of the universal truth. Another famous neo-Confucian was Wang
Yang-ming, who was more Buddhist than Confucian. It was reported that
he was suddenly enlightened one night and attained a new understanding
of the central idea of The Great Learning, which became central to the
Neo-Confucianist reformulation of the Confucian classics. He said "the
great man is an all-pervading unity, which is one with Heaven, Earth and
all things." In his research, Chan Wing-tsit (1989) located more than 40
Buddhist expressions and stories in Wang's treatise, the Ch'uan-hsi In
(Instructions for Practical living).19

Not surprisingly, this period saw tensions arising between Confucianism
and Buddhism. To counter Confucianist criticisms, Buddhists viewed
themselves as        "ultimate cure" (pi-ching chili), and characterised
Confucianism as a "worldly dharma-medicine (shih-chieh fa-yao) which
merely provoked a "view of the temporary (chia-kuan)."20 Nevertheless,
this rivalry did not enable Confucianism to defeat Buddhism, because
Buddhism (and Taoism) still retained its mass appeal. If one can be
certain as to what Confucianism achieved, it would be that it enriched all
three spiritual traditions and encouraged their synthesis to a greater degree
than ever before. While Confucianism became more Taoist and Buddhist,
it also contributed to Taoism and Buddhism. For example, the Ch'an
Masters Miao-hsi and Chu-an in the Sung dynasty edited a famous book
named Valuable Instructions in the Forest ofCh 'an, which adopted many
of the moral norms of Confucianism.21

3\.3 The nature of Sinitic Mahayana Buddhism

One reason why sinitic Mahayana Buddhism never overtook
Confucianism in terms of its influence was the fact that it was not so
much interested in state governance as it was in the pursuit of individual
salvation and nirvana. Sinitic Buddhism was more concerned with
spiritual realism than the state of governance. Buddhism (like religious
Taoism) is ultimately concerned with the problem of life-and-death -

Wang Yang-Ming (1472-1528) may be said to be the most outstanding philosopher of
the Ming Dynasty. See W. M. Tu, Neo Confucian Thought in Action.

> E. T. Ch'ien, The Neo-Confucian Confrontation with Buddhism, pp. 347- 370.

Wu Yi, On Chinese Ch 'an in Relation to Taoism, pp. 131-154.

while Confucianism is committed to the constant moral perfecting of man
and society. Sinitic Mahayana Buddhism was basically a popular lay
movement that sought to restore Buddha's original compassion through
the ideal of the bodhisattva, the person who sacrifices his own welfare in
order to lead all to nirvana. It is interesting here that the bodhisattva
represented is not so much an inspiration but as a model to be
scrupulously emulated. One can think here perhaps of the role of Abdu'l-
Bahá in the Baha'i Faith.

Sinitic Mahayana Buddhism taught self-perfection as the supreme good
and the final goal. It is a religion of salvation concerned not so much with
the world but with liberation from suffering and rebirth. Qualities such as
benevolence, liberality, gratitude and tolerance are stressed rather than
worldly possessions. The Baha'i Faith is somewhat similar here ~ in the
sense that the individual's salvation is a personal journey from him to
God. The individual has to develop his spiritual faculties to the fullest in
this earthly life so that in the next life, he will be able to attain a higher
spiritual station and his soul can move closer to God. The Confucians, on
the other hand, were very much involved with the material world and with
the faculty of reason in their dealing with life. For the Buddhists, the
faculty of reason provided a relatively superficial awareness, insufficient
to the task of directly apprehending the truth. All endeavours in the realm
of what might be termed "philosophy" were thus theoretically subservient
to the greater ultimate goal of enlightenment.

Sinitic Mahayana Buddhism also chose to play a more defensive role. It
tended to be metaphysical, transcendental, and above all worldly things.
While the religious specialist was a popular and important figure in
Chinese culture, there was no self-perpetuating Sangha, and ordination
ceremonies were rarely held. This contrasted with the more practical,
morally idealistic, and historically minded Theravada form of
Buddhism.22 In Theravada Burma, the Sangha (Buddhist hierarchy) has
always been politically active, more so since the military overthrew the
civilian government of Prime Minister U Nu in March 1962. Similarly,
while Theravada Buddhism does not play a visible role in Thai politics, it
nevertheless influences many of its political, economic and social policies.

Buddhism in the Family of Chinese Religion                               \7

While there had been Buddhist/Taoist-led messianic peasant rebellions
throughout Chinese history, they were essentially non-political as they did
not offer an alternative to the civil service.23 Neither did the uprisings
come from ideological opposition to religious Taoism or Confucianism. In
contrast to the Confucianist persecutions against Buddhism, which were
mainly political and economic, the issues m Buddhist/Taoist-led
rebellions were basically economic. The major persecution of 845 AD
came about mainly because of economic issues. Many able-bodied men
had joined monasteries and thus became unavailable for agricultural
production and army or labour conscription, or too much land belonged to
the Buddhist church and thus became tax-exempt. Significantly,
confiscated images of bronze were made into currency, those of iron into
agricultural implements, those of gold and silver turned over to the
Treasury and images of wood, clay and stone left untouched.24 On the
whole, Buddhism may be said to possess a distinguished legacy in "search
after truth" and has clearly-stated lessons on detachment. More than any
other religion, it warns against the perils of blind attachment to religion.
There are many images that beautifully express this in Buddhist
writings.25

It should also be noted that besides the Chinese trilogy of Confucianism,
Taoism and Buddhism, there were many other sectarian groups, which
were a mixture of these. They were split up into numerous competitive
sects with no central organising body. Many of these are syncretic
Buddhist and religious Taoist groups. Most are not well defined because
syncretic religions have ever-changing combinations. Chinese secret
societies range from political, religious, politico-religious and they adapt
themselves to changing conditions due to the demands of the people they
wish to attract. In the long history of China, these groups have organised
uprisings for what may seem to be religious concerns but which are, upon
further investigation, economic or political.

3\.4 The Lack of Unity in Chinese Buddhism

Generally in China we can discern five varieties of Buddhism.26 The
following are the main Buddhist groups in China but these are in no way
discrete or self-contained for it is possible to find believers embracing
features from two or more schools. In addition, each of these schools may,
by themselves, be divided into many sub-sects or branches, depending on
the varying emphasis on methods and techniques. These sects meant that
there was no central ecclesiastical authority of Buddhism in China as there
was in Thailand, Burma and Sri Lanka, and this meant that they did not
have the power or influence they had in these other countries.

4\. The Role of Buddhism in Chinese Culture

Buddhism gained a foothold in China because of four main reasons: the
Chinese intrinsic interest in the spiritual life, Buddhism's ability to adjust
and adapt to Chinese culture, its explanation of the after-life and its ability
to acquire state support. On the other hand, Buddhism did not become the
state philosophy of China because of four main reasons. First, as a
predominantly lay movement, it did not enjoy state power. Neither did it
endeavour to pursue, capture or maintain such power, being more
interested in the pursuit of salvation and nirvana. The neo-Confucianists'
efforts to increase their influence at Buddhism's expense also contributed

\[27\] One notes that while all schools of Buddhist thought acknowledge and use the name of
Maitreya, the name of Buddha Amitabha can only be found in Mahayana scriptures. But
the signs and times for their occurrences are similar. Amitabha was made into a purely
spiritual phenomenon to be experienced only in a spiritual plane, and by this process,
Mahayanists were able to isolate the references regarding time and dates from the
phenomenon of Amitabha and settled upon Maitreya as the actual physical Buddha, Who
would manifest Himself on earth in accordance with the prophecies - in their Scriptures
and the Pali text. According to J. Fozdar, p. 243, Maitreya and Amitabha signify One and
the same Person.

20         THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

towards this end. Last but not least, the numerous Buddhist groups were
disadvantaged in not being united in their beliefs and practices and in their
lack of a central authority.

This article has also discussed how, despite the predominance of
Confucianism in Chinese religion, it was on closer inspection, an official
philosophy valued more for its ability to ensure stability and order in
society than as a means of spiritual insight or source of inspiration. Its
endurance and sustainability for 2,500 years was in part due to its sister-
faiths, Buddhism and religious Taoism, which satisfied the spiritual needs
of the masses and kept them compliant. The sisters were much more
metaphysically in tune than their brother who was often preoccupied with
matters of state. While Confucianism was concerned with the moral
perfecting of man and society, Buddhism and Taoism became intimately
connected with the problem of life, death and immortality. Emerging in
China around the same time to fill the spiritual vacuum left by
Confucianism, the sisters were similar in many ways. For one, both were
completely at home with metaphysical propensities. The Taoist, for
instance, had no problem understanding the Buddhist's penchant for
solitude, meditation and monasticism. In like manner, Buddhism utilised a
Taoist vocabulary to make the Buddhist faith intelligible to the Chinese,
especially when dealing with topics such as breath control and mystical
concentration.

As elder brother of the Chinese religion, Confucianism guarded its
privileged position jealously. While it acknowledged its sisters'
contributions to the family, it was determined that they should not
overstep their boundaries. Occasionally there were jealousies,
disagreements and rivalries. Sometimes it was the brother with one of the
sisters, or two of the sisters together; at other times, the two sisters would
disagree among themselves and periodic quarrels and squabbles would
break out. Whatever the cause, the elder brother would often use the state
apparatus to stem the disorder. Most of the time, however, the three lived
together in harmony and co-operation. They also borrowed ideas freely
from each other in their daily lives. Through the course of history,
Buddhism eventually found it prudent to coalesce with Confucian-Neo-
Confucian and Taoist traditions to form a complex multi-religious ethos
within which all three traditions were more or less comfortably
encompassed. This was also the case with religious Taoism which in the

Tang period, incorporated Confucius into its pantheon of gods, a
hierarchy which was headed by the Tang Emperor himself! Not
surprisingly, after such intimate and intricate liaisons, it was often
difficult for outsiders to tell the members of the family apart.

5\. The Future of Religion in China

5\.1 Needs of the Chinese people

Archaeological discoveries in China (as elsewhere) have established
beyond doubt that from the earliest times, the Chinese people have had an
awareness of an Unseen Power. Humanity has instinctively felt "it"
inwardly and worshipped "it" outwardly. The Chinese appear to be
instinctively intuitive and spiritually receptive. Despite the fact that they
had to endure repeated periods of upheaval, oppression and chaos, there is
no questioning the close and pervading relationship of religion to the daily
lives of the Chinese people. Even when religion was at its ebb during the
time of Mao, "Maoism" (much in the spirit of the two sisters) attempted to
fill the void. Mao was called "our great helmsman" and "the red sun in
the heart of people throughout the world". He was praised for "unlimited
wisdom, courage and strength" and for "always being with us". He was
also the source of inspiration and the object of devotion in songs and
rituals with a strongly religious character.

Today, the overseas Chinese community is perhaps the best example of
this religiosity. Chinese religion thrives in the myriad temples in the
overseas communities of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
'Abdu'1-Bahá had a special compliment for the Chinese people: "The
Chinese people are most simple-hearted and truth-seeking... In China,
one can teach many souls and train and educate such divme personages
that each one of them may become the bright candle of the world of
humanity."28 Perhaps he was thinking of Emperor Ming (58-67 AD) who,
having seen Buddha in a dream, sent envoys to India to inquire about the
doctrine and whose envoys subsequently returned with numerous sutras
and holy objects, as well as two Indian monks to translate the sutras.

\[28\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, cited in the Star of the West, Vol. 13, 185. Note that in this instance the
original text of'Abdu'l-Baha's words is not available.

We may also learn from what the neo-Confucians have realised all along:
that for any philosophy or religion to have a powerful and enduring hold
on the hearts and minds of the people, it must have a metaphysical
foundation. The neo-Confucianists endeavoured to fill the chasm of
unfulfilled needs left by the Analects, a chasm which enabled ancient
shamanistic practices to continue to thrive in Chinese society and which
led to the subsequent emergence of Buddhism and Taoism.

In the past, attempts were made to fill this chasm. Confucius was deified
500 years after his death in the later Han dynasty and worship of him was
conducted in government schools. Numerous temples were also erected in
his honour in the Tang dynasty in 630 AD. This did not stem the growing
popularity of the sisters and a further effort was made during the Sung
dynasty by the neo-Confucianists to strengthen Confucianism by the
infusion of metaphysical principles into it. While their efforts succeeded
m stemming the growth of Buddhism and Taoism, it certainly did not
succeed in eradicating their influence.

It is apparent from Chinese history that the metaphysical foundation of
religion or philosophy must provide answers to the afterlife since a human
being is more self-centred than humanitarian. One remembers 'Abdu'l-
Baha's exposition on man: "Self love is moulded into the very clay of
man." Human beings are fundamentally spiritual creatures and a part of
them is intensely interested in what lies beyond death. This is a much
stronger impulse than the fact that they are human. The humanist
philosophy has no answer to what lies beyond death and an answer is only
provided by religion. Understandably, people are constantly worried about
their own survival and what the future holds for them. It can be argued
here that humanitarianism as a creed has not succeeded in laying the
foundation of any great civilisation such as the Egyptian, Christian,
Islamic and Buddhist civilisations. Marcus Aurelius was a humanist but
his philosophy did not spread to the psyche of the masses. Communism, a

\[29\] Capitalism's success lies in its ability to exploit the self-love and profit motive inherent
in man. In this sense it has used an important potential of man mentioned in the Baha'i
Writings. It is stated that "self-love", which in this context may be translated into self-
interest "is moulded into the very clay of man". Self-love is the greatest motivational force
known to us, and the use of personal reward is a valuable path towards material
advancement.

humanitarian creed, which aimed to effect social justice had to be
sustained by the barrel of the gun. The most successful humanitarian
movement of all - Confucianism - lasted 2,500 years only because it was
supported and sustained by its two sisters who were content for the most
part to be part of the family of "Chinese religion".

The composition of Chinese religion also reveals the Chinese as a
practical people. This can be seen in the fact that the Chinese religion is
not an institutional religion but one that satisfies a range of religious
needs. It can be compared to an empty bowl, which can be filled with the
contents of religions such as Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism,
Christianity, Hinduism, etc. Confucianism, for example, fulfilled the
Chinese need for a social order, Taoism, the need for the spirit and
Buddhism, the need for belief in the afterlife. Confucianism filled the role
as the "moral" and "ritual" religion, Taoism the "polytheistic" and
"alchemical" and Buddhism, the "devotional" and "mystical". Their
contributions are also distinct: Buddhism and Taoism influenced Chinese
art, sculpture, religion, and philosophy of life, Confucianism contributed
to government, education, literature, society, and ethics. It is a question of
fulfilling needs. In Chinese funerals, this type of functionalism can be
seen very clearly. The Chinese family may employ a Buddhist and Taoist
monk to perform funeral rituals although they may have nothing to do
with one another. After the funeral, they perform the Confucian rites of
ancestral worship. On another occasion, they may reach into their
shamanistic tradition by consulting a spirit medium to consult about
matters of luck.

While it is often argued that Buddhism survived because it acculturated
itself,30 it must also be remembered that its survival was due to the fact
that it fulfilled a basic craving left by Confucianism - the need for
salvation for all beings and the opportunity for progress to an afterlife.
Buddhism provided a spiritual respite from the harsher routines of

\[30\] See J. Ching, Chinese Perspectives, p. 221. Buddhism adapted so much to Chinese
society that Julia Ching has posed the question as to whether it was "the Buddhist conquest
of China or the Chinese conquest of Buddhism?".

\[31\] Similarly, religious Taoism was more appealing than philosophical Taoism because it
was essentially preoccupied with basic concerns, such as life, death and immortality, and
pragmatic issues relating to health, wealth, business and marriage. See P.G.L. Chew, Life,
Death and Immortality, The Singapore Baha'i Studies Review, 2, 1, 1997, pp. 69-90.

Confucianism. It gave hope to the masses by teaching that the Buddha-
nature is in all of us, that the Bodhisattva lives to help his fellow
creatures, and that ignorance can be removed through the attainment of
Enlightenment when the Truth of the Highest reality is realised.

Indeed, I would venture so far as to say that the ordinary Chinese person
is not concerned much with Confucianism, Taoism or Buddhism even
though we hear such names vaunted frequently in their literature. The
real religion of the ordinary Chinese people is concerned with meeting
their immediate needs, that is, the pursuit of worldly success, the
appeasement of the dead and spirit, and the seeking of knowledge about
the future. On the other hand, the real religion of the intellectuals is an
ideology that conforms to rationality, order and harmony. To attain a
foothold in China, a religion must address these needs.

5\.2 Addressing Basic Needs: the Chinese Religion and the
Baha'i Faith

In relation to these basic needs, the Baha'i Faith has specific teachings
addressed to the creation of wealth, of the spiritual world and of the
future. In terms of worldly success, Baha'is are not opposed to the
accumulation of wealth. Marxism was attractive to the Chinese because it
offered a solution to widespread poverty and proposed as its goal an
egalitarian society in which individuals receive benefits according to their
true needs. Like the founding fathers of communism, Baha'is believe that
there must be tyranny somewhere if poverty exists. While wealth is to be
encouraged, poverty is to be abolished. Baha'i teachings stipulate that if
an owner has a large fortune, his workmen should also have a sufficient
means of existence. In the Baha'i model, employees are partners and not
just wage earners. Baha'i institutions such as the Huququ'llah, which
institutes a 19% tax on profits above a certain level has helped in the
equalisation of income.32

There are also teachings with regard to the metaphysical. There is a belief
in an ultimate goal or Being, the existence of an afterlife and the necessity
of performing good deeds in the material world of existence. In line with

\[32\] Baha'u'llah, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, p. 14.

Chinese beliefs, Baha'is believe that the status of a departed spirit is
influenced by the intercession of others through prayers and good works
done in their name and that there should always be gratitude towards
parents and grandparents for the gift of life.33

Last but not least, the Baha'i Faith is concerned about the future. All of its
social principles are designed to enable humanity to exist happily for
another 1,000 years. The keyword is unity and the principles are centred
on the one-world concept, that is, the promotion of a world language, a
world currency, a world tribunal and a world defence force.34 The Baha'i
world is basically a world without borders where humanity is one and the
same everywhere. The Baha'i recognises a world made one by the
revolution in telecommunications and the impracticality and the
redundancy of working within man-made political borders. It is a
principle aligned to the economic prosperity of humanity since it would
mean the eradication of wars - a major disincentive to prosperity.

Where intellectuals are concerned, an attractive philosophy would be one
where the principles of rationality, order and harmony, are adhered to.
After all, Confucianism was adopted because it was an incarnation of
common sense and practical wisdom. It also ties in well with the concept
of harmony in the universe. The idea of harmony is an important
component of Chinese traditional culture. As early as the last years of the
west Zhou dynasty 5,000 years ago, ancient scholars elucidated the
brilliant idea of "harmony making prosperity". Later, Confucius and the
Confucian school put forward the proposition of "harmony above all" and
established theories on the co-ordination of inter-personal relations, the
protection of the natural environment and the maintenance of ecological
balance.

Indeed, harmony appears to be the predominant motif in Chinese religion.
Confucianism finds supreme harmony in a disciplined and ordered human
relationship. Buddhism perceives all reality as interdependent and teaches
man to achieve union through the rejection of selfish desires and of a
separate ego. Taoism finds harmony in nature and naturalness and dreams
of immortality beyond this earthly life. The Baha'i vision of the unity of

\[33\] ibid., p. 65.

\[34\] ibid., p. 15.

humankind and the establishment of a world civilisation based on peace
and justice can be an appealing one in this context.

The trilogy of Chinese religion reveals to us the possibility of the peaceful
co-existence of religious beliefs. A reason for the harmony of both
Taoism and Buddhism is that both converge in the quest for the truth of
existence. Where the Chinese perception is always oriented in the triadic
heaven-earth-humankind relationship to exhibit the Tao and its
manifestation, the Buddhist took the lead from the historical Buddha's
insight that led to nirvana. On the whole, the methodological quest for the
Tao is similar to the quest for Dharma. Both acknowledge the subtleties of
the quest. In addition, the Buddhist idea of "all in one" or "one in all" is
an appealing one. During the reign of Empress Wu (684-704 AD), there
was an attempt to develop a universalistic view called the Dharmadhatu,
which was adopted to promote the spirit of cosmopolitanism, not only in
politics but also in religion.35

This idea was propagated by the neo-Confucianists and has its source in
the I Ching: "In the world there are many different roads but the
destination is the same. There are a hundred deliberations but the result is
one."36 In line with this idea and in contrast to the Theravada tradition,
smitic Mahayana temples usually have many Gods and also an infinite
number of future Buddhas.37

As the Chinese experience shows, religion becomes viable if it does not
attempt to displace and deny the essential truth of all the great religions.
Buddhism's incursion into China did not replace the native gods of China.
The Baha'i perspective of progressive revelation will not be too unfamiliar
to the Chinese since the traditional attitude was one of tolerance rather

\[35\] King Asoka in 3 rd century BC is another good example of a tolerant ruler. As an ardent
Buddhist, he made no attempt to suppress other religious groups. On the contrary, he lent
them positive aid and encouragement. To suppress Brahmanism would, he believed, depart
from the true spirit of Buddhism. See D. Ikeda, Buddhism in the First Millennium.

\[36\] Cited in J. Legge, The 4 books, Pt. 2, Ch. 5.

\[37\] Theravada temples contain only the image of Skyamuni Gautama Buddha and the bodhi
tree. In contrast, the Mahayana temples contain a multitude of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,
which are myriad manifestations of Absolute of which Gautama is only one. Also
Amitabha Buddha (Amituofo and the Bodhisattva Avalokitsevara Kuanyin) is more
important than that of Buddha. Icons in Mahayana temples are always more numerous and
there may be ancestral tablets on the altar as well.

than dogmatic discrimination and ideological opposition. One observes in
the history of Chinese thought a tendency for wholeness and a sense to
look towards the relativity of particulars within the universal totality.
There are also other implications for teaching that may be derived from a
study of Buddhism m China. The history of sinitic Buddhism tells us the
great importance of good translations. The greatest figure who made
Mahayana thought really acceptable and digestible for the Chinese was
Kumárajiva, who came to Chang-an in 401. During the 12 years that
followed, aided by his able disciples, he translated thirty-five sutras.
Although these translations were later criticised by Hsuan-chuang as not
scholarly or faithful enough to the original, Kumárajiva knew better -
because he aspired to present the sense in such a way and style to be
readily understood by his readers. Here, one discerns two schools of
translators; the one is scholarly and the other strives to reproduce the
spirit. Hsuan-chuang belongs to the former and Kumárajiva to the
second.38 Both are needed of course. Other translators were Paramartha
(499-569) who came to South China in 546; Chi-I (538-597 AD) and Chi-
tsang (549-623) of the Sui dynasty; and last but not least, Fa-tsang (643-
712 AD) the founder of the Avatamsaka School.39 The importance of

> good translators able to transmit both the thought and spirit of religious
> scriptures cannot be lightly discounted.

The success of Buddhism in China tells us that foreign ideologies can take
root and develop. The Chinese are eager to learn from foreigners.
Presently, they desire to learn from the West. Even Lao-tzu's ideas are not
so thoroughly native to the Chinese as that of Confucius. Some scholars
think that Lao-tzu derived these teachings from India and while this
cannot be historically proven, it cannot be ignored either. The Chinese
love for knowledge and learning is legendary. One remembers here that
while the Europeans were attracted to India for its material wealth, the
Chinese were attracted to India for its spiritual wealth.

If there has been religious persecution in China, the key issue was not
whether something was "foreign" or "home grown" but whether it had
mass appeal and whether it was a potential threat to the monopoly of state

See B.L. Suzuki, Mahayana Buddhism, p. 8.

\[39\] Chi-I is the founder of the T'ien-dai (Tendai in Japanese) School whose teaching is the
development of the doctrine contained in the Saddharmapun-darika. Chi-tsang is the
principal expounder of the shastras belonging to the Madhyamika School of India.

power. One remembers that although there were religious persecutions in
the history of China, these were not prolonged and there was not so much
an opposition to the religious doctrine itself as there were grievances with
respect to its economic and political implications.40 The scenario today is
no different from the past. Today, Communist China seems determined to
maintain control over religion, regardless of the impact on its international
relations. In recent years, Beijing has outlawed several Christian groups -
as illegal cults. In December 1999 alone, more than 100 Christians were
arrested nation-wide while six Protestant leaders in Henan province were
sentenced to labour camps for leading "evil cults".41 The massive crack
down on the fast growing and popular Falun Gong spiritual sect in July
1999 is another example. Reminiscent of past persecutions, one notes that
the absolute power of communism is not so much opposed to the spiritual
content of the teachings, but are more fearful of its potential threat to state
supremacy. It is apparent here that just as the Neo-Confucians were
fascinated and fearful of Buddhism's growing influence in the 11th and
12th century, so too, there is a simultaneous love-hate, and attraction-
repulsion relationship to the incursions of new ideologies into China.

According to the Baha'i Faith, the 20th century can be seen as one where
humanity sheds the last vestiges of a troubled adolescence to enter into a
more mature and stable adulthood.42 The 20th Century has seen the death
throes of many political social and economic ideologies as well as
unprecedented technological developments and a massive search for a
new world order. In 1912 and 1949, in China, Republicanism and
Communism respectively filled the political gap but these ideologies seem
all too soon to be losing their influence. For one thing, Communism has
no metaphysical foundation and its humanitarian ideals are powered by
force. Like Confucianism, there is no flight of imagination or soul-stirring
religious emotion in its scriptures. Worse, the sisters have been ex-
communicated, and communism, unlike Confucianism, is perched
precariously alone. Time will tell whether the 20th century is indeed
another axial period in which the essential insights that spawn great
cultures take root. Great political, social, economic and spiritual changes
often occur during such times. So too, do teachers of great civilisations

such as Confucius, Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed emerge. Whether the
20th century is another watershed in human history will only be apparent
to later historians.
