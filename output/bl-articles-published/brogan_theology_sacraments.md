                       The Theology of Sacraments in the
Roman Catholic Church

Kevin Brogan

Abstract
One of the most endearing features of the Bahá’í Faith is its openness to
people of different beliefs and traditions. But that openness demands a
knowledge of the belief systems of the people with whom one is in dialogue.
This paper attempts to enter into a dialogue between the theology of Roman
Catholic Sacraments and the Bahá’í response to that theology.

Introduction
One cannot ignore the part played by the Sacraments in the life of a Roman
Catholic. While there may be a decline in the actual belief that people have in the
Sacraments, they continue to be administered at crucial points in an individual’s life.
Perhaps it is because they are thus administered that they still hold such importance.
Many Catholics today may see the Sacraments as mere empty formulae, but others
see them as stepping stones along the path to eternal life, whereby the believer is
infused with the Grace of God at significant points in their lives: they are seen as
signifying no less than Christ’s hand in humankind’s redemption.

The intention of this paper is to examine the background to the Sacraments, their
central importance to Catholic belief and their significance in the tradition of the
Roman Catholic Church. It would not be possible to treat each of the Sacraments
adequately in this space, but it is hoped that a detailed explanation of the Eucharist
will give Bahá’ís some understanding of the importance of Sacraments in Roman
Catholicism.

What are Sacraments?
The seven Roman Catholic Sacraments are: Baptism, Penance, Confirmation,
Eucharist (or Mass), Marriage, Holy Orders and Sacrament of the Sick (formerly
“Extreme Unction”). The Church tells us that Sacraments are “the signs and
instruments by which the Holy Spirit spreads the grace of Christ, the Head,
throughout the Church which is His Body” (The Catechism of the Catholic
Church, Section 774). The noun “sacrament” is derived from the Latin
sacramentum, originally “a military oath” taken by Roman soldiers not to desert
their standard, turn their back on the enemy or abandon their general (traces of
which survive in early Christian usage), but whose present meaning comes from its
employment in the Latin New Testament to mean “sacred mystery.” As one
receives each Sacrament, he or she experiences the Grace of Jesus Christ and
ultimately of God in a deeper way than experienced in previous Sacraments: one
experiences God in a deeper way when one receives the Sacrament of Confirmation
than when one is baptised. In the Vatican Council Document (“The Constitution
on Sacred Liturgy,” Section 59), we are told that the “purpose of the Sacraments is
to sanctify men, to build up the body of Christ [the Church] and finally to give
worship to God.”

However, they also act as a form of instruction. Usually before one receives the
Sacrament, one goes through detailed instruction about that Sacrament and its
significance in the Christian life of the individual and the community. We see this
especially in the case of adult Baptism, Penance (Confession), First Communion
(Eucharist), Marriage, and Holy Orders. Bahá’ís might be familiar with the elaborate
preparations for First Confession and Holy Communion among children in primary
schools and also the preparation for Confirmation when the child reaches about
eleven years of age. Much of this preparation concerns instruction in the meaning of
the Sacrament being received. The person who is to receive it must have a strong
Christian faith, but at the same time the celebration of the Sacrament helps the
participant to nourish, strengthen and express his or her faith still further. That is
why they are called “sacraments of faith” (Vatican Documents : The Constitution
on Sacred Liturgy).

Sacramental Grace
In addition to this, the Church teaches that for believers, the Sacraments are a
requirement for salvation and entry to eternal life (The Council of Trent, 1547). The
reason for this is that Christ - through the Holy Spirit - bestows “Sacramental
Grace.” This grace (which comes from the Latin gratia or “gift”) is defined as “a
participation in the life of God” (Catechism of the Catholic Church, Section
1997) and is the “gratuitous [free] gift that God makes to us of his own life,
infused by the Holy Spirit into our soul to heal it of sin and to sanctify it” (Ibid.,
Section 1999). Without this, one cannot participate in eternal life with God. More
than a gift, therefore, it is a relationship with God.

Bahá’u’lláh, in the Kitáb-i-Íqán (the Book of Certitude), also highlights this
relationship when He says: “...for the highest and most excelling grace bestowed
upon men is the grace of attaining unto the Presence of God, and of His
recognition, which has been promised unto all people” (p. 138). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also
highlights the importance of grace in the spiritual life of a believer: “It is evident that
the souls receive grace from the bounty of the Holy Spirit which appears in the
Manifestations of God. Therefore, if a soul does not receive grace from the
bounties of the Holy Spirit, he remains deprived of the divine gift...” (Some
Answered Questions, p. 128). He goes on to state: “Therefore, it is evident that
the spirit of Christ is a heavenly grace which descends from heaven; whosoever
receives light from that spirit in abundance - that is to say, the heavenly teachings -
finds everlasting life” (p. 98).

While ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is saying that the Holy Spirit gives us eternal life through the
teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, the Catholic Church also teaches that the Holy Spirit is
received by reading the Word of God or Bible (The Dogmatic Constitution on
Divine Revelations: Vatican Council Documents); in addition, the believer receives
the Holy Spirit in a special way through the rituals and symbols enacted in
participating in the Sacraments.

Sacraments as the Continuation of Jesus’ Revelation
A key role played by the Sacraments is that when the Church celebrates them,
“she confesses the faith received from the Apostles” (Catechism of the Catholic

Church, Section 1124), and indeed from Christ Himself. It is He Who acts in and
through the Sacraments and communicates the grace that each Sacrament signifies.
In this we are being told that the Sacraments go back to the time of the early
Church, and have been given to us by Christ. If one examines the Gospel,
however, one does not find any account of Jesus prescribing the Sacraments in
detail. The Church explains that while Jesus did not directly institute the Sacraments
while He was on earth, He nevertheless instituted them through the Apostles and
their successors. The Gospel reference to Jesus’ appointment of Peter as first Pope -
the so-called Petrine Clause - is used to explain this:

> “...thou art Peter [Gk. Petros], and upon this rock [petra] I will build my
> church; and the gates of hell [Hades] shall not prevailagainst it. And I will
> give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind
> on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
> earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Matthew 16:18-19).

The Council of Trent (1545-63), the 19th ecumenical gathering of the Roman
Catholic Church, which, in response to the Protestant Reformation, initiated a general
reform of the church and precisely defined its essential dogmas, stated in 1547:

Adhering to the teaching of Holy Scripture, to the apostolic tradition and to
> the consensus… of the Fathers, the sacraments of the new law were… all
> instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church (Section 1115) tells us that “the mysteries
of Christ’s life are the foundations of what he would henceforth dispense in the
sacraments through the ministers of his church.” This means that the unfolding
mysteries of Jesus through the ages are being revealed in the Sacraments and that
through them, He is revealing Himself to suit the needs of every age. This Revelation
of Jesus in the Sacraments is being carried out through His ministers - the bishops
and priests - who are seen as the direct link with the apostles and therefore with
Jesus Himself. Since the existence of the Apostles’ Creed as a formula from about
the second century, the Church has, since the eleventh century, formally defined
itself as “Catholic and Apostolic”.

One can see here again the need that the early Church had for putting the
Christian faith under the authority of bishops and priests. Because the Sacraments
are important steps in the life of a believer, the doctrine around them was very
much influenced by the need to have an authoritarian priesthood. When the
Sacraments were first instituted in the first or second century, it was necessary to
emphasise the direct line with the Apostles and with Christ Himself. The bishops and
priests, as the successors to the Apostles, acted as administrators of the sacraments,
as in today’s Church. This was necessary at that time because of the fear of schism
and because it was necessary to keep the purity of Jesus’ teachings intact. (It could
be said that this also happened in the Bahá’í Faith with the succession of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi as the two authoritative interpreters of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation and also with the “learned arm” of the Faith, specifically the appointment

of the thirty-two Hands of the Cause of God by Shoghi Effendi between 1951 and
1957 for the purposes of its protection and propagation.) However, it also meant
that the Church authorities controlled the development of Jesus’ Faith, and did not
take into consideration the spirituality of the people and how Jesus was working
through them. This is also understandable in that the laity was not educated enough
to be able to think for itself: it was a flock needing pastoral guidance (John 10:11-
16) and, in a metaphorical sense, feeding (John 20:15-17).

Signs and Symbols
Part of the celebration of the Sacraments is the use of signs and symbols, which
derive their meaning from both the Old and New Testaments. Their purpose is to
allow humanity to “express and perceive spiritual realities through physical signs and
symbols” (Catechism of the Catholic Church, Section 1146). In the same way
that in the world of social relationships one uses actions, gestures and words, so
also the Catholic Church teaches that we need signs and symbols to conduct a
relationship with God. In many cases these signs, symbols and rituals are born out
of the social relationships of the day. Washing and anointing, breaking bread and so
forth help to demonstrate the presence of God and our relationship with Him while
simultaneously being practical activities in the contemporary social milieu. The
Sacraments integrate all of these signs and symbols in ritualistic celebrations.

The Church goes further than this in its use of symbol. St. Thomas Aquinas
(1224-1274), the foremost Scholastic scholar and theologian and a major figure in
the medieval Roman Catholic Church, tells us that a sacrament is an “efficacious
symbol,” which means that what is symbolised happens. For example, the bread
and wine at the Sacrament of the Eucharist (from the Greek word, eucharistos,
meaning “grateful,” literally a “thank-offering” or “thanksgiving”) symbolise the Body
and Blood of Jesus, but because the Eucharist is a Sacrament, Church teaching
states that what is symbolised actually happens: that is, the bread and wine actually
become the Body and Blood of Christ, while still remaining visibly bread and wine.

Why is it necessary to give signs and symbols such importance? Why is it so
important to insist that people believe that this bread and wine become the Body
and Blood of Christ, when it is so obvious that they are merely bread and wine? In
today’s world, does this belief in Transubstantiation recreate the image of fellowship
and community that was evident during the Last Supper? The answer possibly lies
in people’s need in the past for the miraculous and mysterious. It also placed the
priest, who was representing Jesus at the altar, in a position of authority. Today,
however, people are much less willing to accept this use of symbol and the
authoritarian, centralised model of Church that accompanies it. A new understanding
of symbol is required.

Bahá’u’lláh discusses symbols as follows:

> Know verily that the purpose underlying all these symbolic terms and
> abstruse allusions, which emanate from the Revealers of God’s holy
> Cause, hath been to test and prove the peoples of the world; that
> thereby the earth of the pure and illuminated hearts may be known
> from the perishable and barren soil. From time immemorial such hath

been the way of God amidst His creatures, and to this testify the records of
the sacred books (Kitáb-i-Íqán, p. 49).

In this we learn that symbols are used by the different Manifestations to show us
what God expects of us: they are a means of understanding God’s expectations.
In the same way, Jesus used symbols to convey or reinforce His Teachings. He
spoke of shepherds (John 11:11-16) and fishermen (Matthew 4:18-22) in relation to
how His followers should act. He addressed the nature of fellowship by invoking
the analogies of the vine and its branches (John 15:1-9) and of bread and wine.
Symbols have a purpose, they are a means to an end, not an end in themselves.
To a large extent with the Catholic Church and its teaching on “efficacious
symbols,” this use of symbols has become an end in itself, where the symbol is
often more important than what it represents. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá clarifies that “Outward
forms and symbols must be used to convey intellectual conceptions” (Some
Answered Questions, p. 83). He goes on to explain what this means by using
examples:

...so the symbol of knowledge is light, and of ignorance, darkness; but
> reflect, is knowledge sensible light, or ignorance sensible darkness? No, they
> are merely symbols. These are only intellectual states, but when you desire
> to express them outwardly, you call knowledge light, and ignorance darkness.
> You say: ‘My heart was gloomy, and it became enlightened.’ Now, that light
> of knowledge, and that darkness of ignorance, are intellectual realities, not
> sensible ones; but when we seek for explanations in the external world, we
> are obliged to give them a sensible form. It is clear and evident that these
> signs have symbolic signification, and that they are not literal (p. 84).

Regardless of what Bahá’ís might feel regarding the application of ritual and the use
of symbols as they apply to the Sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church, they
are an essential part of Church teaching. It is a core teaching of the Church that
they are the “signs and instruments” by which the Holy Spirit spreads the Grace of
Christ to all believers. To certain Catholics, they are greater instruments than the
actual teachings of the Bible.

Perhaps the greatest sacramental instrument is that of the Eucharist. This is
commonly referred to as the Mass (from the Latin missa or “dismissal,” signifying
the solemn dismissal by the priest of the baptised congregation after it had partaken
of the Eucharist in the early Church) and it is obligatory on each Roman Catholic
to attend Mass each Sunday and Holy Day.

The Eucharist
Recognised by the Catholic Church as “the source and summit of the Christian Life”
(Vatican Documents: Lumen Gentium, Section 11), the Sacrament of the Eucharist
has as its basis the Last Supper of Jesus Christ portrayed in the synoptic Gospels.
It was the night before He was to be crucified. The meal has a poignancy that did
not exist at any meal up to this. What added to its importance and solemnity was
that it was also the Jewish Passover Meal (Pesach), which commemorated the

Exodus of the Jews from slavery in Egypt, an event, we are told, in which the
angel of death passed over all the houses of the Jews and entered the homes of
the Egyptians and killed their firstborn. As a consequence, Pharaoh released them
from slavery (Exodus 12:31-32). Since then each year to commemorate this event,
a Passover meal was prepared in each Jewish home, a long-established tradition
which continues to this day. It included bread and wine, which were recognised as
“the first fruits of the earth” and were offered as an acknowledgement of the
greatness of God. The bread was unleavened (without dough and therefore nor
fermented) to signify the Jews’ hasty escape from slavery. Central to the
commemoration was the celebration of Yahweh’s Covenant with His people, in
which He promised to be faithful and loving to them in return for their acceptance
of Him as the One True God. It was at this most important time of the Jewish
year that Jesus chose to have His last meal with His closest followers.

It is the belief of Christianity that Jesus was herewith establishing the new
Covenant. At Passover a lamb was sacrificed and eaten. Under this new Covenant
[Testament], Jesus was the “Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the
world” (John 1:29). He had come to die for the sins of the world, a death that
was imminent. This was a highly momentous occasion. All that had been said and
done by Jesus over the three years of His ministry was encapsulated in this meal.
Because He was hosting the Passover Meal, Jesus “took bread, and blessed it, and
broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, ‘Take, eat; this is My body’. And
He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, ‘Drink ye all of it;
for this is my blood of the new testament [covenant], which is shed for many for
the remission [forgiveness] of sins’” (Matthew 26: 26-28).

What is the meaning of these words? The Catholic Church takes them literally.

By the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, Roman Catholics believe that at the
Consecration of the Mass, which is a re-enactment of the Last Supper, the
substance of the bread becomes Christ’s Body and the substance of the wine
becomes His Blood. This was referred to above as an “efficacious symbol”, which
means that what is symbolised actually occurs. The bread and wine offered at the
altar are believed to become the actual Body and Blood of Christ. This doctrine,
formulated at the Council of Trent in 1551, teaches that Christ is “whole and entire
in each species”, that is, in the bread and in the wine. How does this happen? St.
John Chrysostom (354-407), Bishop of Constantinople and Doctor of the Church, in
his book, De Proditione Judae, tells us that “the priest pronounces the words, but
their power and grace are God’s,” while St. Thomas Aquinas informs us that the
transformation of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ “cannot
be apprehended by the senses but only by faith which relies on divine authority”
(Summa Theologica). The Catechism of the Catholic Church today tells us that
this transformation happens “in a way surpassing understanding” (Article 1333). There
is no rational explanation for this, so the believer is expected to take
Transubstantiation as an article of faith.

Is there a different meaning to what Jesus was telling His disciples at the Last
Supper? By going back to the Passover meal commemorated each year by the
Jews, we see that the bread and wine are symbolic of food that sustains life, while
the lamb in the Old Testament was a sacrificial victim in rituals. Jesus tells His

listeners: “I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger, and he
who believes in me shall never thirst” (John 6.35). Here Jesus is saying that He is
the real food of life. The bread symbolises the spiritual nourishment that He gives
through His Teachings. In verses 49-51 of this same chapter, Jesus tells those
assembled in Capernaum’s synagogue:

“Your fathers did eat of manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the
> bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and
> not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any man
> eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my
> flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”

His listeners took offence at this last remark: “How can this man give us his flesh
to eat?” (John 6:52). Even His disciples found His figurative use of bread to be
“an hard saying; who can hear it?” (John 6:60), and “From that time many of
[them] went back, and walked no more with him” (John 6:66) and were thereby
“tested and proved,” as explained by Bahá’u’lláh with reference to symbolic
language. Yet Jesus is the “Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the
world” (John 1:29). The new Covenant or agreement between God and His people
is sealed by the shedding of Jesus’ blood in the same way that the shedding of the
lamb’s blood at Passover (Exodus 12:7-13) brought about the safe passage of the
Israelites into the Promised Land. By His death and resurrection, Jesus is bringing
about the New Covenant, a Covenant which the Letter to the Hebrews explains as
letting “us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith” (10:22).

The image of bread has another meaning also. Jesus refers to Himself as the
“bread of life.” He also says: “...the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit,
and they are life” (John 6:63, emphasis added). The bread He gives is the spiritual
nourishment or sustenance of His Teachings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that this “celestial
food is the divine bounties, the spiritual splendours, the heavenly teachings, the
universal meaning of Christ. To eat is to draw near to Him and to drink is to
believe in Him [John 6:35]” (Some Answered Questions, p. 98). He concludes by
saying: “Then it is clear that the bread and wine are symbols, which signified: I
have given you My bounties and perfections, and when you have received this
bounty, you have gained eternal life and have partaken of your share and your
portion of the heavenly nourishment” (p. 98).

Because the early Church took Jesus’ words literally, this non-symbolic
interpretation became the Sacrament of the Eucharist. As a result the spiritual
meaning of the Last Supper was clouded. The reasons for this misunderstanding may
lie in the fact that during the formative period of the early Church, there were
similar examples of sacred meals where bread and wine were consecrated. Among
the Essenes, a monastic group from the desert areas, there existed a “common
meal,” and according to the Damascus Document found among the Dead Sea
Scrolls in 1947, a priest blessed bread and wine. There is evidence that some of
the members of the early Church had some contact with this group. There is also
evidence of sacred meals partaken of by the Romans, where bread and wine were
consecrated. It is probable that from these related examples of sacred meals, which

were part and parcel of the culture of the time, developed the concept of the
Eucharist, as celebrated at Mass today.

The Eucharist, which began as the re-enactment of the Last Supper, evolved into
what is called the Mass. It is one single act of worship and contains two
fundamental parts. The Liturgy of the Word includes readings from the Gospel and
the Old and New Testaments, the homily or sermon given by the priest and the
prayers of the faithful. This is followed by the Liturgy of the Eucharist, which
comprises the offering of the gifts of bread and wine, the Consecration - where the
bread and wine are blessed and changed into the Body and Blood of Christ - and
finally the faithful partake of that meal which is called Holy Communion. This present
format seems to have developed early in the Church’s history. St. Justin (100-160
CE), who wrote to a pagan emperor around the year 155 CE, records what the
Christians did:

> On the day of the sun, all who dwell in the city or country gather in the
> same place. The memoirs of the apostles and the writings of the prophets
> are read as much as time permits. When the reader has finished, he who
> presides over those gathered admonishes and challenges them to imitate these
> beautiful things. Then we all rise together and offer prayers for ourselves and
> for all others, wherever they may be, so that we may be found righteous by
> our life and actions, and faithful to the commandments, so as to obtain
> eternal salvation. When the prayers are concluded we exchange the kiss.
> Then someone brings bread and a cup of water and wine mixed together to
> him who presides over the brethren. He takes them and offers praise and
> glory to the Father of the universe, through the name of the Son and of the
> Holy Spirit, and for a considerable time he gives thanks that we have been
> judged worthy of these gifts. When he had concluded the prayers and
> thanksgivings, all present give voice to the acclamation by saying ‘Amen’.
> When he who presides has given thanks and the people responded, those
> whom we call deacons give to those present the ‘eucharisted’ bread, water
> and wine and take them to those who are absent (Apologiae, chapters 65-
> 67).

There are many similarities between that account of the primitive Mass on the
Sabbath and the Bahá’í Nineteen Day Feast. The Feast constitutes the heart of the
Bahá’í community, and attendance, while not obligatory, is an important Bahá’í duty.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained the significance of these Feasts: “The Nineteen Day Feast
was inaugurated by the Báb and ratified by Bahá’u’lláh in His Holy Book, the
Aqdas, so that people may gather together and outwardly show fellowship and love,
that the Divine mysteries may be disclosed. The object is concord, that through this
fellowship hearts may become perfectly united, and reciprocity and mutual helpfulness
be established” (The Nineteen Day Feast, p. 5). In just the same way that the
Mass is the most important community prayer of the Catholic Church and its central
act of worship, the Nineteen Day Feast is seen as the foundation of the World
Order of Bahá’u’lláh.

The Nineteen Day Feast has many similarities to the Mass in format. The first
part is the spiritual or what is called the Devotional, which consists of reciting or
chanting the prayers and the Writings of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
to a certain degree corresponds to the Liturgy of the Word in the Mass. The
second part is general consultation on the affairs of the Faith. During this part, the
Local Spiritual Assembly, the ruling administrative body elected or formed by the
local Bahá’í community each year, consults with the community and learns what the
community thinks and then studies the resolutions consulted upon and passed at the
Feast. This corresponds to a large extent to the priest’s homily because the priest
is the spiritual leader of the local parish; the main difference is that his sermon does
not, like the consultative portion of the Feast, involve dialogue with the congregation.
The third part of the Feast is the social. Here the host, who may be the owner of
the house in which the Feast is held, prepares refreshments for the participants.
Indeed, in the early Church, when numbers were small and the Eucharist would
take place in people’s homes, the host would prepare a meal. This is akin to the
Holy Communion received by Catholics. When talking to Roman Catholics about the
Bahá’í Faith, there is an opportunity to mention the Feast and its place in the Faith
and to introduce its similarities with the Mass as an explanation.

For Catholics, the Mass is a very important celebration of the Christian
experience. It allows the community or parish to meet each Sunday to renew their
Covenant with God through Jesus Christ. Indeed, in the past in Ireland, as in other
countries, it also had a social dimension in that it allowed the neighbours and parish
members to meet one another on a Sunday morning after the priest had bidden his
congregation to “go in peace to love and to serve the Lord.”

However, one cannot help thinking that if the Church had not misunderstood the
meaning of what Jesus said at the Last Supper, that celebration would have been
even more meaningful. By adopting the literal meaning of Jesus’ symbolic words, a
very rich spiritual meaning was lost to countless generations of Catholic believers.
Jesus’ redeeming message was clouded by the mystery and “magic” of
Transubstantiation. There must also have been good reason why the true meaning of
the Last Supper was obscured in this way, however.

Conclusion
In this paper I have tried to give an outline of the general theology of the
Sacraments, which is quite difficult in that they have evolved into what the Church
explains as a special encounter with God in and through Jesus, an encounter which
fills the participant with the Holy Spirit and bestows a Grace which enables the
believer to draw closer to the Creator of all things, an encounter without which the
believer cannot attain eternal life. While the Bahá’í Faith does not recognise these
Sacraments, it is imperative that in speaking to Roman Catholics, Bahá’ís understand
their significance in a believer’s life.

Bahá’u’lláh has revealed:

> The Word of God… is God’s all-pervasive grace, from which all grace doth
> emanate. It is an entity far removed above all that hath been and shallbe...

Know thou, moreover, that the Word of God - exalted be His glory - is

higher and far superior to that which the senses can perceive, for it is
> sanctified from any property or substance. It transcendeth the limitations of
> known elements and is exalted above all the essential and recognized
> substances. It became manifest without any syllable or sound andis none but
> the Command of God which pervadeth all created things          (Kitáb-i-Íqán,
> pp. 140-141).

It should be remembered that the Word of God in the Bible is also a source of
Grace to the Roman Catholic. Indeed, increasing numbers of believers see the Bible
as being of greater significance in their lives than the Sacraments. Bahá’ís believe
that because Jesus did not directly institute the Sacraments, they do not have the
same Divine impact or efficacy as the Word of God or Gospel. Bahá’u’lláh tells us
that the Sacraments are no longer necessary or essential, but to say this to a
devout Roman Catholic is to dismiss a core article of their faith.

As a Bahá’í who was once an active believer in Roman Catholicism, I feel that
when speaking to followers of the Catholic Church, it is vital to understand where
they “are coming from.” In this paper I have tried to explain the teaching behind
the Sacraments and particularly the Sacrament of the Eucharist, while at the same
time offering a Bahá’í perspective that will allow for dialogue between both Faiths. I
feel that it is only in such a spirit of sensitive and constructive dialogue that Roman
Catholics - who constitute the world’s largest and most widespread Christian
denomination - will begin to consider investigating the Bahá’í Faith and that Bahá’ís
themselves will consort with Catholics in a more focused and positive way.
