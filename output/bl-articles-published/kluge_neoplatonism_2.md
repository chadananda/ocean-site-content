           Neoplatonism and the Bahá’í Writings

Part 2

Ian Kluge

1: Introduction
In order to demonstrate how the work of Plotinus complements
and offers new insights into the philosophy embedded in the Bahá’í
Revelation, this paper expands and builds on some of the issues and
ideas presented in “Neoplatonism and the Bahá’í Writings, Part 1.”1
A project like this immediately raises two issues. The first is, what
is meant by referring to a philosophy embedded in the Bahá’í Writ-
ings? Does not Shoghi Effendi write that Bahá’u’lláh “has not merely
enunciated certain universal principles, or propounded a particular
philosophy, however potent, sound and universal these may be.”2?
Does he not say that the Bahá’í Faith has “refus[ed] to be labeled a
mere philosophy of life?”3 Elsewhere he writes,

> For the Cause is not a system of philosophy; it is essentially
> a way of life, a religious faith that seeks to unite all people on
> a common basis of mutual understanding and love, and in a
> common devotion to God.4

In light of these statements, is not a project like this in danger of
reducing the Writings to a man-made philosophy? In our view, such is
not the case because this study recognizes that studying the philosoph-
ical aspects of the Writings does not exhaust Their contents; there is
obviously more to the Writings than philosophy. However, we must
clearly recognize that these philosophical aspects exist; there are pas-
sages referring to metaphysics and ontology, epistemology, ethics, the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

philosophy of man, social and political philosophy and philosophy
of history. Furthermore, Shoghi Effendi indicates that philosophical
characteristics of the Teachings exist when he refers to the “philosophy
of progressive revelation”5 and the “Bahá’í philosophy of social and
political organization.”6 Indeed, he encourages a questioner to cor-
relate the Writings with contemporary developments in philosophy
and only warns him or her away from what he calls “metaphysical
hairsplitting.”

> Philosophy, as you will study it and later teach it, is certainly
> not one of the sciences that begins and ends in words. Fruit-
> less excursions into metaphysical hair-splitting is meant, not
> a sound branch of learning like philosophy.7

Correlation with other philosophical schools can only be done by
focusing on the philosophic aspects of the Writings which is pre-
cisely what Shoghi Effendi is encouraging us to do. In addition, we
have `Abdu’l-Bahá’s use of philosophical knowledge, principles and
arguments throughout His talks and letters, as, for example, in His
proofs for the existence of God. In one such He proves the necessity
of God by presenting the philosophical argument that the idea of
an actual infinite regress of causes is “absurd.”8 The impossibility of
actual infinite regresses is a highly philosophical issue and brings in
its train a variety of logical implications. Elsewhere `Abdu’l-Bahá
proves the immortality of the soul with the argument that simple,
i.e. noncomposite, things cannot decompose and die.9 Such passages
amply demonstrate that the Writings have well-developed philo-
sophic features that require study.
The second issue raised by this project is what do we mean by a philo-
sophical understanding of the Writings? In a nutshell, a philosophical
understanding seeks rational knowledge of three things: what the
Writings say explicitly or implicitly; the connections among various
statements, and how they are related to other philosophies.

Abdu’l-Bahá says that “the essence of a thing is known through its

Second, a philosophical understanding seeks to identify and study
how the explicit and hidden connections among the teachings, so
that we can discern more of the underlying unity of the Writings, i.e.
their organic, interdependent structure. In other words, a philosophic
understanding can help us recognize the Writings as an integral
whole. This is important because the inability to see the organic inte-
gral structure of the teachings inevitably causes us to underestimate
the strength of their rational coherence. Difficulties on these matters
inevitably undercuts our ability to explicate and defend the Writings
and to carry on meaningful dialogue with other thought-traditions.
Third, a philosophical understanding of the Writings allows us to
discover the relationship of the ideas in the Writings to those in other
philosophical schools. For example, given the emanationist metaphys-
ics starting from a non-material source as the ultimately real, it seems
clear that the Writings have significant similarities to some forms
of idealism. But if so, what kind of idealism do they resemble—the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

subjective idealism of Berkeley or the objective idealism of Hegel or
Schopenhauer? And how do they relate to other great traditions,
such as Thomism, Transcendentalism, existentialism, phenomenology
and neo-Aristotelianism? Philosophic understanding can also help us
understand why the Writings are so difficult to harmonize rationally
with dialectical materialism, logical positivism or postmodernism.
Knowing which philosophic traditions the Writings resemble can help
us expand our understanding of the Writings by widening our intel-
lectual horizons, sharpening our thinking about important questions
and studying the Writings from new perspectives.
As an addendum, we should say that, paradoxically, a philosophical
understanding of the Writings also helps us to appreciate the inherent
limits of rational thought. The Writings do not just promote rational
understanding but also the “understanding heart.”12 Not everything
can be fully understood or comprehended by reason alone, such as
the deepest inner motives that cause us to accept Bahá’u’lláh as the
Manifestation for this Age or our fullest love for the Manifestation
and His plan for the world. As Pascal said, “The heart has reasons
which reason cannot know.”13
Finally, it should be explicitly noted that examinations of similari-
ties between the Writings and philosophies that pre-dated them are
emphatically not be read as ‘influence studies’ and no statement
made in this paper is intended in even the slightest degree to suggest
any such influence. Influence studies and similarity studies are two
different things. The mere notation and exploration of similarities
as presented in a work or works is not the same thing as a study that
traces the specific pathways by which one set of ideas affects another.
This latter is an historical study involving questions of how, when,
where, who, to what extent and even why, while the similarity study
only takes note of the materials presented directly to the reader and
explores whether they are alike or not. It should also be noted that
there is no logical way to infer historical influence from similarity per

Neoplatonism and the Bahá’í Writings: Part 2

se. Many things are similar but are not, therefore, causally related or
influenced either symmetrically or asymmetrically. Thus, it is clear
that this similarity study offers no grounds whatever for inferences
about influence.

2: The Theology of Aristotle
It is possible, of course, to study the agreements and convergences
between the Bahá’í Writings and Neoplatonism from a strictly non-
historical perspective, i.e. to study the two as separately developed
and independent but strikingly similar systems of thought. In biology
such a development is known as “convergent evolution.” However, in
the case of the Bahá’í Writings and Neoplatonism, there is strong
evidence that links the cultural world of late antiquity i.e. of Ploti-
nus and Proclus to the cultural world of Bahá’u’lláh. This concerns
the entry of Neoplatonic thought into the Muslim and, specifically,
Persian world.
The first entry to Neoplatonism into Persia came in 529 AD when
the Christian emperor Justinian I closed the School of Athens and
the philosophers, the vast majority of them Neoplatonists, fled for
protection to the Sassanid King Khosrau I. They brought with them
numerous philosophical manuscripts including those of their master
Plotinus. Their exile from Rome only lasted four years, but, at the
very least, contact between Neoplatonism and the Persian cultural
sphere had been established. Neoplatonist learning then continued
in the Academy of Gundishapur which was an important Sassanid
intellectual center.
However, there is a far more tangible link between Neoplatonism
and the Muslim world, namely a text called The Theology of Aristotle
which was “the most important direct source of Neoplatonic ideas
in the Islamic world.”14 This book, allegedly produced in Baghdad

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

in the Ninth Century CE, was actually a misattribution of Ploti-
nus’ Enneads to Aristotle. It was widely circulated and influenced
generations of great Muslim philosophers including such Persians
as al-Ghazzali, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Suhrawardi and Mulla Sadra.
In other words, there is a clearly identifiable Neoplatonic influence
in the cultural world in which Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Bahá lived.
Thus, it is understandable that Bahá’u’lláh sometimes expressed
His revelation in a language recognizable to those familiar with this
philosophical tradition.
In itself, the Theology was a paraphrase (it has even been called
a ‘forgery’) with some additions of Enneads IV to VI. Some of the
paraphrases are reasonably close to the original passages in the Enne-
ads, but some in some cases the Theology’s words stray far from the
meaning of the original.15 However, the Neoplatonic language used
in the Writings is consistent with Plotinus’ usages. The Theology was
augmented by other, though less influential, Neoplatonic works such
as the Book of Causes based on Proclus’ Elements of Theology, as well as
The Letter on Divine Science which also paraphrased portions of the
Enneads. However, these other books lacked wide influence because
they were not associated with Aristotle’s prestige.16
The pervasive influence of The Theology of Aristotle also sheds a cul-
tural and historical light on one of the interesting features of the
Bahá’í Writings, viz. the mixture of elements that from a historical
perspective can be called ‘Platonic’ and ‘Aristotelian.’ An idea which
is historically associated with Plato is that the “the earth is the mirror
of the Kingdom; the mental world corresponds to the spiritual world.”17
Plato, of course, taught that the material world was a reflection or
shadow of the ideal spiritual world. Elements that are historically
associated with Aristotle are four-fold causality18, actuality and
potentiality19 and arguments, such as the impossibility of an actual
(as distinct from theoretical) infinite regress to prove the existence
of a Prime Mover.20 The co-existence of Platonic and Aristotelian

Neoplatonism and the Bahá’í Writings: Part 2

elements is significant because one of the major goals of Neopla-
tonists from Plotinus onward was to reconcile the ideas of the two
Greek philosophical giants and fit them into a coherent whole. This
harmonious use of both Plato and Aristotle points to another simi-
larity between the Writings and Neoplatonism.

3\. Discourse About God
In this section we shall examine Bahá’í and Neoplatonic discourse
about God or the One. Our discussion will start with an observa-
tion by Eugene F. Bales that the Enneads employ “three modes of
discourse”21 about God.

> The first mode of discourse is employed when he speaks of
> The One as though it transcends Being, Mind, Freedom,
> Will, Consciousness and Form and is thus void of all act and
> intelligible content. This mode of discourse I shall refer to
> as meontological.22

In this mode God is spoken of as transcending all the phenomenal
attributes including not only the most fundamental one – being – but
also form, which all phenomenal things must have to be particular
things, as well as higher attributes such as mind and consciousness.
The Writings, of course, warn us against any reduction of God to the
level of a phenomenal being:

> This appearance through manifestation [i.e. as a phenomenal
> being] would be for God, the Most High, simple imperfec-
> tion; and this is quite impossible, for the implication would
> be that the Absolute Preexistent is qualified with phenom-
> enal attributes. But if this were so, pure independence would
> become mere poverty, and true existence would become non-
> existence, and this is impossible.23

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

`Abdu’l-Bahá then goes on to say, “The preexistence of God is the

> preexistence of essence, and also preexistence of time.”24 In other
> words, God has “preexistence” and this “preexistence” is essentially
> His, i.e. it constitutes Him. This can be understood to mean that
> insofar as God is preexistent, He transcends ‘being’ or existence
> itself; He is the pre-condition needed for the being of created things
> to occur. For things to ‘be,’ they must be limited, i.e. have their own
> particular or limited being. However, since God is not limited in any
> way, He does not have being in this way. This is emphasized in the
following statement:

> To every discerning and illuminated heart it is evident
> that God, the unknowable Essence, the Divine Being25, is
> immensely exalted beyond every human attribute, such as
> corporeal existence, ascent and descent, egress and regress.
> Far be it from His glory that human tongue should ade-
> quately recount His praise, or that human heart comprehend
> His fathomless mystery. He is, and hath ever been, veiled in
> the ancient eternity of His Essence, and will remain in His
> Reality everlastingly hidden from the sight of men.26

Here, too, we observe how God transcends, “is immensely exalted
beyond,” phenomenal attributes, and, therefore, beyond human
conception. Clearly, the word “Being” in the phrase “Divine Being”
is not used in the same way as when it refers to created beings since
it is qualified by the word “Divine.” This passage draws the obvious
conclusion that since God surpasses ordinary attributes of being, He
also surpasses human understanding:

> It is evident that the human understanding is a quality of the
> existence of man, and that man is a sign of God: how can the
> quality of the sign surround the creator of the sign?—that is
> to say, how can the understanding, which is a quality of the
> existence of man, comprehend God? Therefore, the Reality

Neoplatonism and the Bahá’í Writings: Part 2

> of the Divinity is hidden from all comprehension, and con-
> cealed from the minds of all men. We see that everything
> which is lower is powerless to comprehend the reality of
> that which is higher…. Therefore, how can man, the created,
> understand the reality of the pure Essence of the Creator?27

The “lower” and “higher” refer to ontological dependence. That which
is “lower” in the scale of being depends on that which is “higher,” and
God, being independent of all things, is the highest and therefore,
beyond comprehension by any created thing. Another way in which
the Writings emphasize God’s transcendence of the ordinary attri-
butes of being is by the use of such phrases as “the All-Bounteous, the
Most Generous,”28 “the Almighty, the All-Knowing.”29 Phrases like
this abound throughout the Writings. All of them indicate that God
possess these attributes pre-eminently, in a way that surpasses the
nature of all created things.
Perhaps the most dramatic statement of God’s transcendence vis-à-
vis the created, phenomenal world is the following quotation:

> And since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind
> the one true God with His creation, and no resemblance
> whatever can exist between the transient and the Eternal,
> the contingent and the Absolute, He hath ordained that
> in every age and dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be
> made manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven.30

A clearer and categorical statement of God’s transcendence is difficult
to imagine, since there is “no direct intercourse” and “no resemblance
whatever” between the Divine and creation. Implicit within this is
the conclusion that none of the attributes that apply to phenomenal
existence apply to God, i.e. that God’s mode of existence is utterly
different in kind from ours.

Plotinus pursues this same line of thought from a more philosophical
perspective. He writes,

> The First must be without form, and if without form, then it
> has no Being. Being must have some definition and therefore
> be limited.; but The First cannot be thought of as having a
> definition and limit, for thus it would not be the Source [of
> form and limit] but the particular item indicated by the defi-
> nition assigned to it.31
Here, too, we see the idea that the One transcends ‘being’ because
‘being’ implies existence as a particular thing and this, in turn, implies

> having limitation, i.e. definition and form. However, God surpasses
> definition and form and therefore exceeds the capacities of the human
> mind: “No vision taketh in Him…”32 Because God exceeds form,
> limit and definition He cannot be merely one more thing among all
> the other thing. He is the pre-condition for their existence and con-
> sequently, He must transcend these attributes.

Furthermore, strange as it may seem, for Plotinus God transcends
act or will in the ordinary human understanding of these terms
(which will have to be amended later), because both of these imply
deficiency or lack. We will something to be or to be done, we act in
order to achieve goals because we do not yet have the thing, situation
or condition for which we act. We are a subject acting to obtain a
goal of some kind. However, since God is “self-subsisting,”33 i.e. self-
sufficient and lacks nothing, He transcends the ordinary sense of
these terms. Another way of explaining this concept is to say that

> the will of the One is not something which aims at an end,
> but [is] the end itself. There is no distinction of any kind
> between the will and its accomplishment.34

The logical basis for Rist’s view is the absolute unity of the One or
God which vitiates any distinction between intention (will) and act.
In God, they are one.
Of course, the Writings refer to “the Divine Will that pervadeth all
that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth”35 but from our
perspective, the qualifier “Divine” already indicates transcendence of
any mere human conception of ‘will.’ To claim otherwise would be
to posit deficiency in God. However, as Plotinus makes clear, in the
case of the One, willing need not be motivated by lack or need for
something; rather, the One wills and acts not out of need but from
completeness and super-abundance.
In our view, this concept of superabundance is the ontological signifi-
cance of some of the imagery in the Writings:

> This is the Ocean out of which all seas have proceeded, and
> with which every one of them will ultimately be united. From
> Him all the Suns have been generated, and unto Him they
> will all return. Through His potency the Trees of Divine
> Revelation have yielded their fruits….36

> We might characterize this as the ‘imagery of superabundance,’
> emphasized by the capitalization of such words as “Ocean.” Other
> examples are “Ocean of everlasting bounty,”37 “the Most Great
> Ocean,”38 and “the ocean of My eternal wealth.”39 These suggestions
> of super-abundance are also implicit in such epithets of God as “the
> All-Possessing,”40 “the All-Bounteous, the Most Generous,”41 and
“the Great Giver.”42
The language and imagery we have examined in the Writings and the
Enneads suggests that God’s actions are the consequence of His super-
abundance and His transcendence of all merely phenomenal qualities.

3\.1 The Second Mode of Discourse About God
In his article on the modes of discourse about God, Bales identifies a
second mode of discourse [which] is employed when Plotinus speaks
of The Good [i.e. the One or God] as though it is within Being rather
than beyond it, the essence of Act, containing all things potentially,
as having some kind of Consciousness, Will, Mind and as being
the Transcendent Self. This mode of discourse I shall designate
ontological.43
In other words, the second mode of discourse treats the Good, the
One or God as having presence in the phenomenal world instead of
only transcending it. He quotes Plotinus:

> Hence the Good is not to be sought outside [of the Good]; it
> could not have fallen outside of what is; it cannot possibly be
> found in non-Being; within Being the Good must lie, since
> it is never a non-Being. If that Good has Being and is within
> the realm of Being, then it is present, self-contained, in
> everything: we, therefore, are not separated from Being; we
> are in it; nor is Being separated from us; therefore all beings
> are one.44

> In Plotinus’ view, the Good cannot be entirely divorced from the
> phenomenal world of being because it would be without presence
> within creation, and this absence would effectively be equivalent to
“non-Being” within creation. This is impossible since the Good can-

> not be “non-Being” anywhere: such an absence of the Good would
> be a deficiency. In the language of the Writings, the Good would no
> longer be “omnipresent”45 and, therefore, lacking an essential divine
> attribute. Because the Good is also present (somehow) in the world
> of being, we are not separated from the Good and are joined together
> by its presence.

However, we must not conclude that Plotinus means that the Good
literally incarnates itself in specific objects; rather the Good is present
pre-eminently, i.e. in a manner consistent with its own divine nature.
The Writings also reject the belief that God’s presence in creation
means that God is somehow divided or distributed in the particular
objects of the world. `Abdu’l-Bahá categorically denies the Sufi view
which requires that the Independent Wealth should descend to the
degree of poverty, that the Preexistent should confine itself to phe-
nomenal forms, and that Pure Power should be restricted to the state
of weakness, according to the limitations of contingent beings. And
this is an evident error.46
Although the Bahá’í Writings disallow incarnation as a mode of
God’s presence in creation, they explicitly recognize God’s pres-
ence in the phenomenal world. Bahá’u’lláh writes, “No thing have
I perceived, except that I perceived God within it, God before it, or
God after it.”47 Perceiving God “within” things is to see the presence
of the Divine in them, and by extension, in the phenomenal world.
Of course, the Divine is not present in the phenomenal world in the
same way we are as incarnated beings. (The phrases “God before
it” and, perhaps, “God after it” refer to the transcendence of God.)
God’s presence is also evident in the following quotation:

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
> is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the attri-
> butes and names of God, inasmuch as within every atom
> are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent testimony to the
> revelation of that Most Great Light. Methinks, but for the
> potency of that revelation, no being could ever exist. How
> resplendent the luminaries of knowledge that shine in an
> atom, and how vast the oceans of wisdom that surge within
> a drop! To a supreme degree is this true of man…. Again He
> saith: “And also in your own selves: will ye not, then, behold
> the signs of God?”48

> The concept of God’s presence through the revelation of the “attri-
> butes and names of God” is clearly evident in this passage, which
> also asserts that this revelation is necessary for phenomenal things to
> exist. No kind of existence from the atoms to humankind is exempt
> from revealing signs of God. Furthermore, it is worth noting that
> humans have a privileged place for the divine presence to reveal itself:
“And also in your own selves: will ye not, then, behold the signs of

> God?”49 Elsewhere, God reveals that “We are closer to man than his
> life-vein.”50 A more dramatic way of emphasizing God’s presence in
> humankind and in the phenomenal world is difficult to imagine.

The Neoplatonists recognize that God’s “attributes and names” are
present throughout creation. Proclus refines this insight into a uni-
versal principle of ontology:

> Prop. 18. Everything which by its existence bestows a char-
> acter on others itself primitively [originally] possess that
> character which it communicates to its recipients.51

Any cause, therefore, “communicates” some of its nature or character
to what it causes and thus retains a presence in the effect. The opera-
tion of this principle is most readily evident in the creation of art, but
it is really a principle that describes action at all levels of reality.
The Writings also portray God’s presence in the phenomenal world
through His Will and His actions:
“He doeth whatsoever He willeth in the kingdom of creation,”

> that thereby the sign of His sovereignty might be manifested
> in all things.52

Here we observe how God acts “in the kingdom of creation” rather
than remaining transcendentally distant from it; moreover, He does

so to manifest signs of His presence in the phenomenal world. In a
similar vein, the Writings say,

> …He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatso-
> ever He pleaseth. Know thou moreover that all else besides
> Him have been created through the potency of a word from
> His presence, while of themselves they have no motion nor
> stillness, except at His bidding and by His leave.53

God wills and ordains, i.e. issues commands that lead to the creation
of the phenomenal world among other things. Even more, nothing in
creation has “motion” or “stillness” except by God’s “leave” or permis-
sion, i.e. all things depend on God’s permission to act or not. This
emphasizes the extraordinary degree through which God’s power is
present through the actions of all things. He actively operates within
creation on an on-going basis in all our “motion … or stillness.”
God is also portrayed as acting in the phenomenal world by means
of progressive revelation according to which He takes part in human
history by sending Manifestations to guide us through the next phase
of our historical development. The Manifestation is the intermediary
through which this is accomplished.54 Furthermore, God establishes
a covenant with humankind and assists us in our troubles when He
listens to or answers our prayers. He is portrayed as a “beneficent
Father,”55 which is another image involving presence-in-the-world,
as is the image of God as the “compassionate physician,”56 and “the
Healer, the Preserver.”57 These and other quotations make it clear
that in addition to being utterly transcendent to the phenomenal
world, God is also portrayed as having presence within it.
If the One or God has a will to cause specific acts in the phenomenal
world, it seems logical to suppose that God, in some sense, has a self,
i.e. an identity, desires58 and a will. Otherwise, how, or why would it

> act in creation? In this way, the One may be portrayed as being within
> the world. This is conclusion drawn by Bales, who claims that the
> Enneads’ discourse about the Good proceeds “as though it is within
> Being rather than beyond it:”59 the Good also is portrayed as having a
‘self ’ which would, of course, make it the “Supreme Subject or Self.”60

> Plotinus says, “He is what He is, the first self, transcendently The
> Self.”61 The One, therefore, has, to that extent, an identity and the
> will to express itself and its decrees, though to a greater degree than
> any created thing.62 In the traditional language of theology, it has
> these attributes pre-eminently.

The Bahá’í Writings also seem to suggest—albeit more tenuously
—that God has a self and refer to it in a number of passages. For
example, in His discussion about the four kinds of love `Abdu’l-Bahá
says that the third kind of love

> is the love of God towards the Self or Identity of God. This is
> the transfiguration of His Beauty, the reflection of Himself
> in the mirror of His Creation. This is the reality of love, the
> Ancient Love, the Eternal.63

Not only do we observe God’s presence “in the mirror of His creation”
but also we have an explicit reference to God’s “Self ” and “identity.”
Indeed, in this case, we have a self-reflexive action by God, one in
which He is both subject-actor and object-recipient. Such internal
division is difficult to fathom vis-à-vis a transcendent God and is
conceivable only to an entity within the world of being. Further-
more, the Writings state that God “hath ordained the knowledge
of these sanctified Beings to be identical with the knowledge of His
own Self.”64 Moreover, some of God’s actions are portrayed as being
consistent with a being which has a sense of self:

> He bestoweth His favor on whom He willeth, and from
> whom He willeth He taketh it away. He doth whatsoever He

> chooseth… He hath, however, caused you to be entangled
> with its affairs, in return for what your hands have wrought
> in His Cause.65

Elsewhere, God “willeth, and ordaineth that which He pleaseth.”66
Bestowing favor, willing, taking, causing and being pleased—these
are the kinds of actions consistent with a self that is involved with
creation. This raises the suggestion that God acts like a self or person
insofar as He has an identity, conscious knowledge (“the All-knowing,
the All-Wise”67), desires and will or intentionality. Of course, to say
this is only to say that He does not lack these attributes, not that He
is limited by them.68 Nonetheless, the possession of these attributes
allows us to conclude that God’s relationship to us involves a personal
aspect; that God is a ‘person’ in some pre-eminent way. Conversely,
we might say that it would mistaken to claim that the Bahá’í view
of God is impersonal or non-personal. He is not only a power or
ground-of-being, though He is these things as well. The personal
aspect of God’s relationship to us is also evident in the Manifestation
Who, as we shall see below, reflects the personhood of God into the
phenomenal world. It is through the Manifestation that we relate to
God personally.

3\.2 The Third Mode of Discourse about God
Bales refers to the third mode of discourse about the One or God
as “paradoxical.”69 By this he means that it joins and “shows the
relationship between the first two modes of discourse,”70 it exhibits
traits of both the transcendent mode of discourse and the imminent
mode of discourse that indicates the One’s actions in the world. Bales’
paradigm case for the third mode in Plotinus is self-causation.71 The
One is said to be self-caused—but how can this be? For something to
cause itself it would have to exist in order to bring itself into existence.
But how can it do this before it exists? The cause and the caused are

identical: “his [the One’s] self-making is to be understood as simulta-
neous with Himself; the being is one and the same with the making.”72
This is logically untenable, or, to use Bales’ term, “paradoxical.” How-
ever, by means of this paradox, Plotinus unifies the discourse of God
as transcendent to being, i.e. transcendent to the phenomenal world
as we have seen in the first discussion and the discourse of God as
imminent or acting within being as we saw in the second.
Can such paradoxical concepts be found in the Bahá’í Writings? In
our view, they can, both implicitly and explicitly. For example, both
Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Bahá refer to God as the “Self-Subsisting.”73
Self-subsistence means independence of anything outside itself,
i.e. absolute self-sufficiency, i.e. complete transcendence over the
conditions of phenomenal existence in which such uncompromised
self-sufficiency is impossible. In the phenomenal world of being self-
sufficiency means being one’s own final, formal, efficient and material
cause74—something that no phenomenal thing can be. Yet God is
exactly that from the phenomenal perspective. Thus, like the concept
of self-causation in Plotinus, the concept of self-subsistence paradoxi-
cally unifies two contradictory perspectives and modes of discourse.
Another example of such paradoxical concepts is found in the phrase
that God is “the most manifest of the manifest and the most hidden
of the hidden!”75 Unlike the previous example, the paradox is quite
explicit here. As absolutely transcendent, God is “the most hidden of
the hidden,” and yet as present throughout creation (God is seen in,
before and after things as explained above), God is plainly manifest
or visible if we have the desire to see. The transcendent and immanent
modes of discourse are joined in this description of God as they are in
the statement, “Nothing have I perceived except that I perceived God
before it, God after it, or God with it” which we have already exam-
ined.”76 Here, too, God’s transcendence and immanence are joined in
one paradoxical statement.

Perhaps the most important example of unifying the transcendent
and immanent perspectives is found in the discourse about the
Manifestation. It should be noted at this point that in the Enneads no
counterpart to the concept of a Manifestation exists. The knowledge
required to achieve freedom and salvation at the personal and social
levels needs only individual effort and does not require guidance
from someone through whom God speaks. Enlightenment comes to
the individual seeker through mystical union with the One, which
Plotinus describes as

> the life of the gods and of the godlike and blessed among
> men, liberation from the alien that besets us here, a life
> taking no pleasure in the things of the earth, the passing of
> the solitary to [the] solitary.77

The “solitary,” of course, refers in the first instance to the human
seeker who is alone in his quest for enlightenment, and in the second,
to the One who has no peer or likeness and is, therefore, alone.
Discourse about the Bahá’í concept of the Manifestation includes
and unifies transcendent and immanent elements. It may be objected
that this subject has little or no connection to the transcendence and
immanence of God; after all, the Manifestation is not God. While
this is patently true of the Manifestation in His earthly station, the
issue is more complex vis-à-vis His divine station. The following pas-
sage paradoxically joins both of these stations in the person of the
Manifestation Himself:

> When I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that
> bindeth me to Thee, I am moved to proclaim to all created
> things “verily I am God”; and when I consider my own self, lo,
> I find it coarser than clay!78

The transcendent aspect is in the Manifestation’s statement, “I am
God.” As Baha’u’llah says,

> Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to
> declare: “I am God,” He, verily, speaketh the truth, and no
> doubt attacheth thereto. For it hath been repeatedly demon-
> strated that through their Revelation, their attributes and
> names, the Revelation of God, His names and His attributes,
> are made manifest in the world79

However, Baha’u’llah’s statement that when He considers Himself,
He finds Himself “coarser than clay!” includes the immanent aspect
of existence which His being also includes. Here is another example:
“Manifold and mysterious is My relationship with God. I am

> He, Himself, and He is I, Myself, except that I am that I am,
> and He is that He is.” And in like manner, the words: “Arise,
> O Muhammad, for lo, the Lover and the Beloved are joined
> together and made one in Thee.”80

The Manifestation embraces two contradictory identities, His own
identity as a creation and His identity as God the Creator, and this
duality-in-one necessarily requires paradoxical discourse as the
foregoing passage illustrates. The second part of this passage also
exemplifies the paradoxical discourse required by the Manifesta-
tion’s duality-in-one. The “Beloved,” of course, is God, “the Desire
of the world”81 and in this statement the lover and the “Beloved” are
paradoxically one. We may, therefore, conclude that the Manifestation
combines in one being both transcendent and immanent aspects and
any discourse about the nature of the Manifestation is inevitably
paradoxical. We observe this in the following selection:

> Thus, viewed from the standpoint of their oneness and
> sublime detachment, the attributes of Godhead, Divinity,

> Supreme Singleness, and Inmost Essence, have been, and are
> applicable to those Essences of Being [Manifestations], inas-
> much as they all abide on the throne of Divine Revelation,
> and are established upon the seat of Divine Concealment.82
The Manifestation possess the “attributes of Godhead” and the
“Inmost Essence,” i.e. the attributes of transcendence. It is worth

> noting that this passage contains another related paradox: the Mani-
> festation is established both on the “throne of Divine Revelation”
> and “Divine Concealment”; He is both hidden and revealed, with the
> hidden referring to the transcendent aspect and the revealed to His
> worldly, immanent aspect.

Here is more evidence of the Manifestation’s possession of attributes
of immanence in the world of being:

> Viewed in the light of their second station—the station of dis-
> tinction, differentiation, temporal limitations, characteristics
> and standards—they manifest absolute servitude, utter desti-
> tution, and complete self-effacement. Even as He saith: “I am
> the servant of God. I am but a man like you.”83

The attributes listed here are those of ordinary, limited beings: they
are conditioned by time, have identifiable characteristics, have distinct
form and, like all other contingent beings are “nothingness”84 vis-à-vis
God. This stands in sharp contrast to their transcendent attributes.
The dual nature of the Manifestations, the possession of both tran-
scendent and immanent attributes, inevitably makes any discourse
about Their nature paradoxical insofar as it must combine these
inherently contradictory aspects. Efforts to avoid this paradox can
only end in developing a distorted understanding of the nature of
Manifestations. Hence, from a Bahá’í viewpoint, a purely humanistic
or secular understanding of Manifestations is inherently false.

A clear concept of these three modes of discourse is useful in at
least three ways. First, it defuses misunderstanding and/or possible
critique of the Writings. The Baha’i Scriptures do not contradict
themselves in Their various ways of speaking about God, saying first
one thing and then the opposite. Rather, They discourse about God
in three distinct modes appropriate to three distinct viewpoints: the
viewpoint of absolute transcendence of the phenomenal world; the
viewpoint of immanence or presence within the phenomenal world;
and the viewpoint of the Manifestation Who exemplifies both tran-
scendence and presence. Because the three modes are based on three
different point of view, the Writings cannot be contradictory in their
discourse about the divine. Second, awareness of the three modes
of discourse and the viewpoints from which they originate helps us
think more precisely about any statements the Writings make about
God by relating the modes of discourse to particular points of view.
It enhances our understanding of God as presented in the Writings.
Third, the shared three modes of discourse about the Divine suggest
that the Writings and the Enneads share some commonalities in their
way of understanding God’s way of being and relating to the world.
Of course, these commonalities do not constitute an equivalence since
Neoplatonism has no exact counterpart to the concept of the Mani-
festation which is central to the Bahá’í concept of how God relates to
the world. Furthermore, this discourse can only reflect what human
capacity allows us to know and, therefore, reflects our understanding
of God’s way of being as related to us through the revelation of His
Manifestations.85 Nonetheless, we should not overlook the fact that
this mode of understanding, while limited, is still genuine understand-
ing that reflects the realities of our human situation. There are truths
available to us. Forgetting this all too easily leads to a relativism,
skepticism and, at its worst, nihilism.

4: Human Being: Body and Soul
We shall begin our examination of human being in the Bahá’í Writ-
ings and the Enneads with a study of the relationship between the
soul and body. According to `Abdu’l-Bahá, the soul is not located
within the body:

> the rational soul, meaning the human spirit, does not
> descend into the body—that is to say, it does not enter it [the
> body], for descent and entrance are characteristics of bodies,
> and the rational soul is exempt from this. The spirit never
> entered this body so in quitting it, it will not be need of an
> abiding place.86

Time and space, ascent and descent and entrance and departure are
attributes of material things and soul or “the human spirit is an intel-
lectual, not sensible reality.”87 Therefore, it does not enter or leave
anything. This naturally raises the question of the soul’s relationship
to the body, about which `Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> Some think that the body is the substance and exists by
> itself, and that the spirit is accidental and depends upon the
> substance of the body, although, on the contrary, the ratio-
> nal soul is the substance, and the body depends upon it. If
> the accident—that is to say, the body—be destroyed, the
> substance, the spirit, remains.88

Because this explanation is couched in Aristotelian philosophical
terminology, a few preparatory remarks are in order. A substance in
Aristotle’s philosophy is, primarily, anything that “exists by itself ” as
a distinct and individual entity, be it a sensible or intellectual reality.89
Every substance has attributes which depend on it, just as `Abdu’l-
Bahá describes how, in one view, the soul “depends upon the substance
of the body.” Attributes are of two kinds: essential attributes are

those which a substance needs to have to be the thing it is, e.g. water-
tightness in a cup, and, accidental attributes are those which it may
have but does not need to be what it is, e.g. the color of the cup. In the
materialist view, in which the “body is the substance… [and]… the
spirit is accidental,” the non-essential soul need not be present for the
body to exist as a body.
`Abdu’l-Bahá takes a diametrically opposite position. In His view the
“rational soul is the substance,” i.e. exists independently and the body

> is the accident, i.e. non-essential to the existence of the soul. There-
fore, the body may pass away but the soul will survive:

> The rational soul—that is to say, the human spirit—has nei-
> ther entered this body nor existed through it; so after the
> disintegration of the composition of the body, how should it
> be in need of a substance through which it may exist?90

This statement has at least three major consequences. First, it dem-
onstrates the soul’s independence from the body, and, thereby, its
immortality, a viewpoint Plotinus shares.91 Proclus elevates this idea
to a basic principle of Neoplatonism: “Prop. 186. Every soul is an
incorporeal substance and separable from body.”92 This is only possible
because the soul is the cause of the body, i.e. without the soul there
would be no body at all. As an attribute, body is dependent and can-
not exist without the soul, i.e. it takes a soul to make an actual body
as distinct from a conglomeration of elements or a mechanical device.
This relationship of dependence is not reciprocal.

> Third, `Abdu’l-Bahá’s position is, in effect, a rejection of emergentism
> and reductionism. Emergentism is a group of philosophies based on
> the belief that new, irreducible and unpredictable attributes appear
> or emerge as material structures become more complex; while the
‘emergents,’ such as mind, consciousness or soul, cannot be reduced

to their material substratum, they cannot exist without it either. This

is obviously not compatible with what `Abdu’l-Bahá has written here
since the soul is the independent substance and the body the depen-
dent accident. Emergentism should not be confused with the following
statement in Some Answered Questions:

> Moreover, these members, these elements, this composition,
> which are found in the organism of man, are an attraction
> and magnet for the spirit; it is certain that the spirit will
> appear in it. So a mirror which is clear will certainly attract
> the rays of the sun.93

This differs from `Abdu’l-Bahá’s position insofar as in emergentism
the very existence of the soul depends on its material substratum. In
the foregoing quotation, the appearance or presence—but not the
existence—of the soul or spirit in the phenomenal world depends on
a certain level of physical complexity. Second, according to `Abdu’l-
Bahá, the soul is ‘external’ to the complex organism insofar as it is
attracted from a higher ontological level than matter, whereas emer-
gentism (and reductionism) views the soul as on par or dependent on
matter. Reductionism holds that only attributes present in the original
components of the material substratum of a complex structure are
real and that all phenomena such as life or mind can be explained
by or reduced to the qualities of the underlying matter. In effect, the
soul is a property of matter. Clearly, this, too, contradicts `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s statements. Both emergentism and reductionism make the
soul dependent on its material foundation and both reduce the soul
to the same ontological plane as matter.
Fourth, the distinction between soul and body is not a distinction
between two utterly different and independent substances, as in, for
example, the philosophy of Descartes. In fact, there is only one sub-
stance—soul; the body is an attribute of that soul-substance when it
appears in the material world. This, in effect, dissolves the mind-body
problem since we are not dealing with two separate and unrelated

substances but with one substance—soul—and an accidental attri-
bute—body. There is no ‘problem’ or ‘mystery’ about how a substance
can communicate with or is linked to its own attributes; no ‘commu-
nication’—as if between two separate things—is necessary because
attributes are essentially (permanently) or accidentally (temporarily)
part of the substance. From the Bahá’í perspective, the so-called
mind-body problem does not exist.
Let us now investigate the Neoplatonic view. According to Pauliina
Remes, “given the overall causal and explanatory directions [of Neo-
platonism], the body is not a separate substance but generated by the
soul.”94 Plotinus writes, “Soul on the contrary is that which engenders
the Form residing within the Matter and therefore is not the Form.”95
Leaving aside the philosophical technicalities regarding “Form,” this
statement means that ultimately the soul causes the existence of the
body, so the Enneads, like the Writings, reject emergentism and
reductionism. This conclusion echoes `Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement about
the soul as substance and the body as accident produced by the soul.
Furthermore, Plotinus shares the view that the soul is not in the body:

> Neither the Soul entire nor any part of it may be considered
> to be within the body as in a space… the Soul is not a body
> and is no more contained than containing.96
Plotinus then proceeds to refine what he means by explaining that
“the mode of the Soul’s presence to body is that of the presence of

> light to the air...”97 He adds that this image is accurate because while
> the air constantly shifts, the light is “stable” and that “the air is in the
> light rather than the light in the air.”98 Later, he adds, “a living body is
> illuminated by soul”99 just as air is illuminated by light. For Plotinus,
> the body is ‘in’ the soul because the body is dependent on the soul
> for its existence; in his system of emanations, the spiritual is always

higher than the material if for no other reason than that the material
is the lowest level of being. The physical depends on the spiritual to
exist.100 As William Inge puts it so aptly, “the Soul ‘is present’ with
the Body, but not within it.”101

> The analogous soul-body relationship in the Writings and the Enne-
> ads leads to some similar conclusions, the most obvious of which
> is the immortality of the soul.102 Being spiritual makes the soul
> non-composite, and, therefore, immune to destruction. Another
> implication is that the soul is the active principle in its relationship
> to the body and that the body is passive. According to `Abdu’l-Bahá,
“the soul as thou observest, whether it be in sleep or waking, is in

> motion and ever active.”103 Soul, says Plotinus, is “act and creation”104
> and “is the starting point of motion and becomes the leader and pro-
> vider of motion to all else.”105 In other words, even physical motion
> is a symptom of, or, perhaps material metaphor for, spiritual action.
> This, in turn, suggests that the material derives its value from the
> spiritual,106 illustrating, thereby, how intimately ontology and value
> are related both in the Writings and in the Enneads. The value of

> being the least valuable at the lowest level. Value in this instance is
> determined by the degree of creativity something has or, conversely,
> how many other things depend on it. Since everything depends on
> God or the One, He has supreme value.

5: Psychology or Ontology?
At this point an objection may be raised. When Plotinus speaks of
the soul, he sometimes seems to be speaking about the World Soul
i.e. about ontology, and sometimes he seems to be speaking about the
souls of individual humans, i.e. about psychology. This brings us to

one of the distinguishing features of Plotinus and Neoplatonism in
general, namely, that the ontological or metaphysical and the psycho-
logical reflect one another. Pauliina Remes refers to

> the internalization of the Platonic metaphysical hierarchy.
> In some manner, a human being encompasses, or is funda-
> mentally related to, the metaphysical levels. She is not an
> outside spectator.107

R.T. Wallis, for example, observes that in Neoplatonism, metaphys-
ics and psychology “cannot be sharply separated.”108

> Viewed as a metaphysical reality each level is real in its own
> right; viewed as states of consciousness, on the other hand,
> the lower levels become imperfect ways of viewing the true
> realities contemplated by the ‘higher’ ones.109

Emilsson agrees, writing that “at the intelligible level, being and
knowledge, ontology and epistemology, are unified.”110
These two viewpoints—the ontological and the psychological—are
not contradictory and exclusive, but rather they are complementary
because each promotes understanding of different aspects of real-
ity. We can adopt both understandings simultaneously since one is
reflected in the other. Of course, the higher is always paradigmatic
for the lower; the lower always reflects the higher to the limits of its
capacity. Proclus, the great systematizer of the Enneads, succinctly
sums up this idea when he writes, “For each principle participates
its superiors in the measure of its natural capacity and not in the
measure of their being.”111 In other words, to the limits of its ability,
all things, including the human soul reflect the nature and activities
of the World Soul. Bahá’u’lláh states,

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
> is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the attri-
> butes and names of God, inasmuch as within every atom
> are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent testimony to the
> revelation of that Most Great Light… To a supreme degree
> is this true of man… 112

> Each thing reveals the “attributes and names of God” to the limit of
> its capacity. In The Elements of Theology, Proclus writes, “All is in all
> but in each appropriately to its nature”113 Every level of reality is pres-
> ent in every other but in a manner that is appropriate to its capacities
> and limitations. Because “all is in all” the psychological reflects or
> participates in the ontological and, therefore, by looking inward, we
> can learn a great deal about the ontological nature of reality. This
> teaching of the “all in all” opens up far-reaching possibilities for a
‘subjective science,’ i.e. a ‘science’ of subjectivity which explores reality

> by a rigorous study of subjective consciousness. Such a development
> has obvious affinities to modern phenomenology.

6: Humankind as Microcosm
The idea of the “all in all” implicitly contains the notion that human-
kind is a microcosm. Pauliina Remes writes,

> A basic feature that metaphysics reveals about Neoplatonic
> anthropology is that to be human is to exist on and in a sense
> encompass all metaphysics levels: the sensible realm of time
> and matter, and the hypostases, that is, the Soul, the Intel-
> lect and the One.114

In a manner appropriate to our nature, humankind ‘contains’ the
phenomenal realm and even the hypostases. Of course, the phrase

“in a sense” suggests that we cannot accept this claim literally. Rather,

> it seems to mean that the phenomenal realm and the hypostases have
> a presence as signs or images within us, or, as the principles operative
> in the rest of reality also operate in us. One might also call this a
‘holographic likeness.’ In a holographic picture, every portion reflects

> the whole to a degree proportional to its segment of the whole, i.e. to
> its nature.

This view of humankind as a microcosm is explicitly adopted by
Plotinus:

> For the Soul is many things, is all, is the Above and the
> Beneath to the totality of life: and each of us is an Intel-
> lectual Cosmos, linked to the world by what is lowest in us,
> but, by what is the Highest, [linked] to the Divine Intellect:
> by all that is intellective we are permanently in that higher
> realm, but by the fringe of the Intellectual, we are fettered
> to the lower.115

Metaphysically speaking, human beings live in various levels of
reality or, to put it psychologically, in various states of mind. We are
an “Intellectual Cosmos” because we reflect or ‘contain’ the principles
at work throughout created reality; we touch on both the “higher”
and “lower” realms although it must be emphasized again, we do so
in a manner proportionate to the capacities and limitations of our
essential nature.
The idea of humankind as a microcosm is also found in the Bahá’í
Writings:

> Man is the microcosm; and the infinite universe, the macro-
> cosm. The mysteries of the greater world, or macrocosm, are
> expressed or revealed in the lesser world, the microcosm…
> Likewise, the greater world, the macrocosm, is latent and

> miniatured in the lesser world, or microcosm, of man. This
> constitutes the universality or perfection of virtues potential
> in mankind. Therefore, it is said that man has been created
> in the image and likeness of God.116

Similarly, we read, “Man is said to be the greatest representative of
God, and he is the Book of Creation because all the mysteries of
beings exist in him.”117 This passage may be understood to mean
that humankind expresses or discloses all the principles operative
throughout the macrocosm. In us, these principles are “latent” which
is to say, hidden or concealed—like “mysteries”—presumably until
such time as human evolution allows us to become conscious of
and reveal them. Since the universe is “infinite,” this evolutionary
unconcealing process within humankind will endure infinitely. In
all likelihood, the reference to “virtues” here refers not so much to
virtues in an ethical sense, but virtues in the sense of powers or
capacities inherent in the rest of creation as well as in humankind.
Because God also possesses these capacities to a pre-eminent degree,
humankind is an image of God as stated above by `Abdu’l-Bahá.
Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh clearly tells us that even atoms contain signs of
the revelation of God and that

> [t]o a supreme degree is this true of man, who, among all
> created things, hath been invested with the robe of such gifts,
> and hath been singled out for the glory of such distinction.
> For in him are potentially revealed all the attributes and
> names of God to a degree that no other created being hath
> excelled or surpassed.118

Here, too, we observe that humankind is a microcosm or image of God
containing, at least potentially, “all the attributes and names of God.”
Of course, these attributes are present in us in a manner appropriate
to our particular and limited human nature. Proclus’ Proposition
103—“All things are in all things but in each according to its proper

nature”—appears to apply in the Bahá’í Writings as well not only vis-
à-vis creation but also vis-à-vis the signs of God within us.
One of the logical consequences of the doctrine of the microcosm
is that turning inward is one way for humankind to encounter the
Divine. In the Arabic Hidden Words Bahá’u’lláh says,

> Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou mayest find Me standing
> within thee, mighty, powerful and self-subsisting.119

> In our view, a literal reading of this passage presents so many logi-
> cal obstacles as to make it untenable. At the very least, it violates
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement

> It [the sun, i.e. God] does not appear in the substance of
> things through the specification and individualization of
> things; the Preexistent [God] does not become the phenome-
> nal; independent wealth does not become enchained poverty;
> pure perfection does not become absolute imperfection.120

If Bahá’u’lláh’s statement cannot be taken literally, then it is inevitable
that the phrase “Me standing within thee” refers to the signs of God
or of the Manifestation abiding within the human microcosm. This is
why it is so important to attain self-knowledge, not just of our ego and
conscious selves but of our spiritual human nature as microcosms:

> In this connection, He Who is the eternal King—may the
> souls of all that dwell within the mystic Tabernacle be a sacri-
> fice unto Him—hath spoken: “He hath known God who hath
> known himself.”121

Interpreting this passage literally instead of reading it as a reference to
an inward sign of God adapted to our human capacities could lead—at
its worst—to a potentially disastrous inflation of the human ego.

7: The Lower and Higher Aspects of Humankind
One of the consequences of being a microcosm is that human beings
also have a higher and lower nature that corresponds to the general
cosmic order with its higher, i.e. divine, and lower, i.e. material,
aspects. This understanding of our dual or nature is evident in the
Writings. For example, `Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature
> and his material or lower nature. In one he approaches God,
> in the other he lives for the world alone. Signs of both these
> natures are to be found in men. In his material aspect he
> expresses untruth, cruelty and injustice; all these are the
> outcome of his lower nature. The attributes of his Divine
> nature are shown forth in love, mercy, kindness, truth and
> justice, one and all being expressions of his higher nature.122

We might say that humans are “amphibious,”123 i.e. they live in two
worlds, though, of course, they must ultimately choose which of these
worlds is to predominate and guide their development. This is made
clear by `Abdu’l-Bahá’s foregoing statement which associates all posi-
tive virtues with our higher nature and negative attributes with our
lower nature. Similar ideas are expressed in the following passage:

> Man is in the highest degree of materiality, and at the begin-
> ning of spirituality—that is to say, he is the end of imper-
> fection and the beginning of perfection. He is at the last
> degree of darkness, and at the beginning of light; that is why
> it has been said that the condition of man is the end of the
> night and the beginning of day, meaning that he is the sum
> of all the degrees of imperfection, and that he possesses the
> degrees of perfection. He has the animal side as well as the
> angelic side.124

This declaration takes an ontological perspective of humankind’s
duality, pinpointing our location in the hierarchy of being at the
borderline between “materiality” and “spirituality.” This borderline
ontological location is reflected in our dual nature. It is noteworthy,
too, that `Abdu’l-Bahá associates “materiality” with imperfection
and “spirituality” with perfection—a connection clearly made in
the philosophy of Plotinus who not only associates the higher with
the divine and the lower with the body but also holds that the soul
occupies an intermediate position between higher and lower levels of
reality:

> But in spite of it all [being in a body] it has, for ever, some-
> thing transcendent; by a conversion towards the intellective
> act, it [the soul] is loosed from the shackles and soars…
> Souls that take this way have place in both spheres, living of
> necessity the life there and the life here by turns, the upper
> life reigning in those able to consort more continuously with
> the divine intellect, the lower dominant where character or
> circumstances are less favourable.125

Elsewhere He states that “every human Being is of two-fold charac-
ter.”126 Pierre Hadot sums up the situation succinctly:

> The human soul occupies and intermediate position between
> realities inferior to it—matter and the life of the body—and
> realities superior to it: purely intellectual life characteristic
> of divine intelligence and, higher still, the pure existence of
> the Principle of all things.127

According to Remes, Plotinus holds that “human beings are ‘amphibi-
ous’’—they live two kinds of life, those of the intellect and those of the
composite.” 128 The “composite”129 refers to the view that the human
body is matter and a form which endows it with animal life. ‘Intellect,’
of course, refers to the higher spiritual life of the Nous (translated as

‘Spirit’ by Inge) which finds its image in the human soul; ‘intellect’

> does not simply mean the ‘rational intellect.’
> It is clear, therefore, that both the Writings and Plotinus position
> humankind between two contradictory types of reality, matter
> and intellect or spirit. This has some interesting philosophical con-
> sequences. Because humanity has two different natures we may
> conclude that humankind is inherently and constituitively self-
> contradictory, divided, paradoxical, or even absurd. Existentialism is,
> of course, the philosophy that has richly explored these aspects of

8: Actualizing Our Highest Potentials
The foregoing passages show that both the Writings and Plotinus
maintain that our challenge as human beings is to actualize our
higher potentials by cultivating that which is spiritual in us. `Abdu’l-
Bahá re-emphasizes this theme when He writes,

> He has the animal side as well as the angelic side, and the
> aim of an educator is to so train human souls that their
> angelic aspect may overcome their animal side. Then if the
> divine power in man, which is his essential perfection, over-
> comes the satanic power, which is absolute imperfection, he
> becomes the most excellent among the creatures; but if the
> satanic power overcomes the divine power, he becomes the
> lowest of the creatures.131

He also says, “If a man’s Divine nature dominates his human nature,
we have a saint”132 whose spiritual condition is contrasted to that of
a “mere animal.”133
Plotinus expresses similar views:

> Our task, then, is to work for our liberation from this sphere
> [the material world], severing Ourselves from all that has
> gathered around us; the total man is to be something better
> than a body ensouled—the bodily element dominant with
> a trace of Soul running through it and resultant life-course
> mainly of the body. There is another life, emancipated, whose
> quality is progression towards the higher realm, towards the
> good and divine… [so we may become]… the higher, the
> beautiful, the Godlike… 134

Both passages emphasize the importance of overcoming our lower
nature so that human beings may free the full powers of their spe-
cifically human natures to become “saints”135 or “Godlike.” In other
words, both agree that human beings do not have a natural destiny
but rather a supernatural destiny—a view which follows logically
from the fundamentally spiritual nature of humankind.
However, we must not be deceived into thinking that Plotinus and the
Bahá’í Writings completely disparage the body, let alone recommend
ascetic practices. Our challenge is neither to over or underestimate the
body and to keep it in control. Plotinus writes,

> He [the sage] will give to the body all that he sees to be
> useful and possible, but he himself remains a member of
> another order… [the body is] the thing which he tends and
> bears with as a musician cares for his lyre, as long as it serves
> him… 136

This is an eminently practical attitude; we must do our best to look
after our body properly but must not become obsessed about catering
to it. The Bahá’í view on this subject is perhaps best summarized by
Shoghi Effendi, who categorically states,

> We are not ascetics in any sense of the word. On the contrary,
> Bahá’u’lláh says God has created all the good things in the
> world for us to enjoy and partake. But we must not become
> attached to them and put them before the spiritual things.137

Quite clearly, both the Writings and Plotinus both adopt an attitude
of moderation in regards to the body.

9: Free Will
Both the Writings and Plotinus agree that human beings have free
will. Having accepted free will as a basic datum of human nature,
Plotinus proceeds to define what this freedom is:

> We think of our free act as one which we execute of our own
> choice, in no servitude to chance or necessity or overmaster-
> ing passion nothing thwarting our will… everything will be
‘voluntary’ that is produced under no compulsion and with

knowledge.138

> Elsewhere he adds, “Where act is performed neither because of
> another nor at another’s will, surely there is freedom.”139 In many
> respects his ideas are quite modern insofar as they present a ‘nega-
> tive freedom,’ i.e. freedom from outside interference. Furthermore,
> he requires knowledge for informed consent to an act. Interestingly
> enough, he requires not being in the grip of an “overmastering passion”
> as a criterion for a free act. That which hinders us from implementing
“our own choice” may well come from within yet nonetheless, it is not

really ‘us’ and we could find ourselves as “slaves of passion.”140 This
concept of negative freedom is also evident when he writes,

> Effort is free once it is towards a fully recognized good; the
> involuntary [unfree] is, precisely, motion away from the good
> and towards the enforced, towards something not recognized
> as good; servitude lies in being powerless to move towards
> one’s good, being debarred from the preferred path in menial
> obedience. Hence the shame of slavedom is that… [is when]
> the personal good must be yielded in favour of another’s.141

Freedom requires that we are not forced away or deterred by others
from our desired good and that we have the capacity or power to
achieve our good. Anything else is “servitude” or lack of freedom.
However, Plotinus’ view of free will is not limited to ‘negative free-
dom’ of non-interference. Absence of interference is a necessary
condition for exercising our free will but it is not, by itself, sufficient.
Plotinus writes,

> Soul becomes free when it moves without hindrance, through
> Intellectual Principle [Nous], towards The Good: what it
> does in that spirit is its free act… That principle of Good
> is the sole object of desire and the source of self-disposal to
> the rest.142

> According to Plotinus, full freedom requires a lack of external or
> internal hindrance but also requires that our acts be towards the
> Good. If they are not, then our so-called freedom is deficient or
> incomplete and we, in effect, are not entirely free. However, Plotinus’
> view goes further. Because he believes that all things naturally seek to
> approach the good in a way befitting their nature, he also thinks that
> anything which takes us away from the Good is, in effect, “enforced,”
“involuntary” and “servitude.” Hence, insofar as we move towards the

Good, we are fully free.

At this point, an obvious question arises: ‘Does freedom not include the
ability to do wrong?’ Plotinus inclines to a negative answer because, in
his view, the ability to make negative choices is not necessarily a virtue.

> But when our Soul holds to its Reason-Principle, to the
> guide, pure and detached and native to itself, only then can
> we speak of personal operations, of voluntary act. Things so
> done may truly be described as our doing, for they have no
> other source; they are the issue of the unmingled Soul.143
R.T. Wallis writes,

> Freedom for Plotinus consists in tending spontaneously and
> with full knowledge towards realization of one’s true good,
> and thus contrasts with actions performed under compul-
> sion or under constraint from man’s irrational nature.144
Pauliina Remes summarizes Plotinus’ position by saying,

> Freedom is based on knowledge of universal good and intel-
> ligible principles that govern the universe, and is thus not
> primarily personal or subjective but tied strongly with the
> intelligible order.145

This constitutes a significant difference from modern concepts which
closely associate freedom with personal, i.e. subjective, choice and
action no matter how arbitrary it might seem. On this issue, John
Rist writes, “in Plotinus’ view true freedom is a direction of the soul
to its source in the One.”146 Elsewhere, Rist points out,

> Freedom then for Plotinus is not simply equivalent to the
> power of choice. Rather it is freedom from that necessity of
> choice which the passions impose. The soul that hesitates
> between good and evil is not free, nor is such a choice godlike.147

R.T. Wallis explains Plotinus’ position like this:

> Clearly, Plotinus does not accept the idea that freedom nec-
> essarily requires the possibility of choice among opposites.
> He writes, the “ability to produce opposites is inability to
> hold by the perfect good; that self-making must be definite
> once for all since it is the right.”148

He seems to be saying that having the ability to do the bad also means
being unable to hold to the good, i.e. being unable to achieve the per-
fection that is natural to us. Until we can hold to the good so closely
that the bad is not even an option for us we are still enslaved, to one
degree or another, to our passions. In this quest we are assisted by the
fact that the good is natural to us because “[t]he spring of freedom is
the activity of the Intellectual-Principle, the highest in our being; the
proposals emanating thence are freedom.”149 As humans, the highest
aspect of our being is our reflection of the Nous or “Intellectual-
Principle” and consequently, our real freedom lies there. It is what we
really want even though we may think we want something else. In the
words of Lloyd P. Gerson, “We are only in control and therefore free
when we identify ourselves as agents of rational desire.”150
In short, we humans may pursue the pseudo-freedoms of our own
desires or the genuine freedom offered by the quest for the One. The
former seems genuine but is really restrictive and the latter may feel
restrictive but is actually true freedom. This conclusion follows from
our human nature which, in Plotinus’s view, is an objectively real and
with which we can live in harmony, i.e. freedom, or in disharmony
i.e. slavery. Even though we choose to delude ourselves that slavery is
freedom, it is slavery nonetheless.
The Bahá’í Writings clearly support the belief that humankind has
free will. `Abdu’l-Bahá writes that

> [s]ome things are subject to the free will of man, such as jus-
> tice, equity, tyranny and injustice, in other words, good and
> evil actions; it is evident and clear that these actions are, for
> the most part, left to the will of man. But there are certain
> things to which man is forced and compelled, such as sleep,
> death, sickness, decline of power, injuries and misfortunes.151

Elsewhere, He writes, “But in the choice of good and bad actions he is
free, and he commits them according to his own will.”152 What these
passages make clear is that moral decisions are within human power
but a large number of physical necessities are not. Ethical freedom
exists, but freedom in other matters may be non-existent, such as
the need to sleep or eat, or severely circumscribed. According to the
Writings, we also have freedom of thought – which includes the free-
dom to think mistakenly, as indicated by Shoghi Effendi:

> There is, unfortunately, no way that one can force his own
> good upon a man. The element of free will is there and all
> we believers—and even the Manifestation of God Himself—
> can do is to offer the truth to mankind.153

> Because of free will, belief cannot be compelled even if it is for our
> own good. Shoghi Effendi also advises an inquirer that “The exer-
> cise of our free will to choose to do the right things is much more
> important [than speculation in astrology],”154 thereby again drawing
> attention to free will in matters of morality. In the teaching of the
> independent investigation of truth the Writings clearly advocate
> freedom of thought for each individual, a freedom which is predi-
> cated on our ability to think and to exercise free choice. On this issue
`Abdu’l-Bahá writes,

> When freedom of conscience, liberty of thought and right
> of speech prevail—that is to say, when every man according

> to his own idealization may give expression to his beliefs—
> development and growth are inevitable.155

From the foregoing discussion it is plainly evident that the Bahá’í
Writings value the importance of free will, free choice and free
thought.

9\.1: The Limits of Liberty
Like Plotinus, the Bahá’í Writings do not embrace without quali-
fication the concept that humans are well served by unlimited
freedom or that everything which humans choose to call ‘freedom’
really is freedom in the truest sense of the word. The fact that we
have free will as individuals does not necessarily mean that we
should follow our inclinations in any direction or that the exercise
of free will can, by itself, justify almost anything. Our freedom in
the world—which is predicated on our free will—can easily be mis-
used. As Bahá’u’lláh writes,

> Consider the pettiness of men’s minds. They ask for that
> which injureth them, and cast away the thing that profiteth
> them. They are, indeed, of those that are far astray. We find
> some men desiring liberty, and priding themselves therein.
Such men are in the depths of ignorance.

Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames none
> can quench. Thus warneth you He Who is the Reckoner, the
> All-Knowing. Know ye that the embodiment of liberty and
> its symbol is the animal… Liberty causeth man to overstep
> the bounds of propriety, and to infringe on the dignity of his
> station. It debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity and
> wickedness.156

> Bahá’u’lláh makes it clear that not everything we call “liberty” is
> necessarily “true liberty”157—a position similar to that adopted by
> Plotinus. False understanding of liberty may mislead us into forget-
> ting “Noble have I created thee”158 and thereby lead to harm, or even to
“depravity and wickedness” that disgraces our higher nature. Certainly

> Bahá’u’lláh rejects the notion that liberty for its own sake can justify
negative and self-destructive acts. That is why He says,

> We approve of liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse to
sanction it in others. We, verily, are the All-Knowing.

Say: True liberty consisteth in man’s submission unto My
> commandments, little as ye know it. Were men to observe
> that which We have sent down unto them from the Heaven
> of Revelation, they would, of a certainty, attain unto perfect
> liberty.159

This passage reemphasizes that Bahá’u’lláh denies any purely subjective
concepts of freedom: an act is not necessarily free or not free because
we personally think it is. Subjectivity alone does not determine what is
or is not free. One of the other objective factors that must be taken into
consideration are the Manifestation’s commandments, which reflect
what is best for human nature and development whether we personally
like it or not. That is why Bahá’u’lláh says freedom is submission to
His commands, “little as ye know it,” meaning that although we may
not recognize a condition as being truly free, it may be free despite our
subjective disagreement.
Concrete examples help to clarify His concept. For example, if people
drive their cars on the basis of subjective freedom, the roads would be
a worse carnage than they are. Ultimately, this kind of purely subjec-
tive freedom is no freedom at all because everyone would be stalled
amidst the wreckage. The freest driving is made possible by everyone’s
submission to the rules of the road because there are objective laws

of physics that must be obeyed. The same is true in other areas of life.
Are people who are compulsive shoplifters or eaters free even though
they inflict untold harm on themselves and others? Subjectively, they
might claim to make their decisions freely, but are they really? Ulti-
mately, would they not be more free if they submitted to the laws
forbidding shoplifting and the medical guidelines providing rules for
healthy eating? After all, the ‘laws’ of physiology are as rigorously
objective as the laws of physics as are the facts of our human nature.
To fully understand the second example, we must remember that
both Bahá’u’lláh and Plotinus agree that human nature includes
higher and lower aspects, and that our real or essential self is asso-
ciated with our higher nature. Consequently, our “true liberty” is
to do whatever strengthens our higher self, and ‘false liberty’ or
unfreedom advances our animal nature. We cannot violate our
essential nature and claim to be free in any but the most subjective
meaning of the word.
Of course, such a line of argument raises an obvious question: ‘What
are we free from in the kind of freedom advocated by Bahá’u’lláh?’
As with Plotinus, the answer is that we are free from slavery to
our passions, to our lower animal nature and to the vagaries of the
world. In other words, Bahá’u’lláh’s pronouncement is on a conver-
gent course with Plotinus’ insofar as both recognize the distinction
between true and false liberty and both advocate that submission to
divine commandments and to our noble human nature gives us more
genuine freedom than the arbitrary exercise of human preferences. It
is obvious, of course, that approaching the Good in Plotinus and
submitting to Bahá’u’lláh’s “commandments” are virtually the same
actions. After all, the divine commandments are intended to bring
us to the Good.
Both Bahá’u’lláh and Plotinus seem to agree that liberty is not an
end-in-itself and its own self-justification but rather is a means to

achieve the goals of developing the intellectual and spiritual nature of
humankind, of liberating our higher selves. Modern sensibilities are
likely to find this unsatisfactory because we think of subjective free-
dom of choice as the ultimate freedom. Appearances to the contrary,
these two concepts of freedom are not necessarily mutually exclusive
if we place them in a hierarchy. At the basic level there is freedom of
choice, at which people have to make all kinds of choices regarding
good and ill, their emotions, their values, purpose and goals and so
on. This is the level of freedom as generally discussed in our society.
However, at a higher level, we find what Emile Brehier calls “radi-
cal freedom,”160 the kind of freedom apparent in Plotinus and the
Writings, i.e. a freedom from the kind of choices that mark the first
level and where individuals are no longer slaves of “passion.” Such
freedom is greater than its predecessor because the individual “is
not a prisoner of any of the forms of reality.”161 This “true liberty”
is achieved by following the divine commandments or, in Plotinus’
terms, participating in our higher spiritual nature. `Abdu’l-Bahá
seems to be thinking of this kind of freedom when He says people
must be educated so

> that they will avoid and shrink from perpetrating crimes, so
> that the crime itself will appear to them as the greatest chas-
> tisement, the utmost condemnation and torment.162

When this level of sensitivity and awareness has been attained, the
individual no longer experiences crimes or other human weak-
nesses as possible choices or temptations, and, thereby, no longer
a matter of choice. Such individuals have transcended freedom-as-
choice to a higher level where freedom finds its fullest expression in
likeness to God by recognizing the Manifestation and by obeying
His commands and, thereby, evolving to participating more fully in
His attributes.

10: Who/What is the Self?
The issue of free will brings us directly to the subject of ‘self,’ i.e. the
individual who acts and experiences subjectivity. We know that we
share a universal human nature with other people, but what about
our specific ‘selves’ who make decisions, have feelings, take actions
and are particular, i.e. different from others? What about the “his-
torical personality,”163 the self-aware person whom I identify as ‘me’?
What is its origin? How is it related to our universal human nature?
To discuss this matter clearly vis-à-vis the Bahá’í Writings, it is first
necessary to review what is said about the soul. According to `Abdu’l-
Bahá, “the essence of man is the soul”164 which is to say, the soul is
our unique distinguishing feature as human beings; the essence of
a thing is precisely what gives it its identity as the kind of thing it
is, in this case man. This is confirmed when `Abdu’l-Bahá says, “the
human spirit which distinguishes man from the animal is the ratio-
nal soul, and these two names—the human spirit and the rational
soul—designate one thing.”165 Rationality is one of the divine gifts as
indicated when Bahá’u’lláh tells us to “Consider the rational faculty
with which God hath endowed the essence of man.”166 This, in turn,
suggests that the essence of man and rationality are strictly corre-
lated, i.e. rationality is an essential attribute. The human soul cannot
be human without it.
In Plotinus, the situation is similar. The rational soul is the human
essence, i.e. what makes us the kind of being we are.167 Plotinus states,

> The true man is the other, going pure of the body, natively
> endowed with the virtues which belong to the Intellectual
> Activity… This Soul constitutes the human being.168

In Plotinus’ philosophy, the human soul is an emanation or projec-
tion of the Nous or Intellect and thus reflects its rational nature; John

> Deck calls it an “emissary from the Nous [Intellect].”169 A similar line
> of reasoning is at work when Plotinus says “the soul is a rational soul
> by the very same title by which the All-Soul is called rational.”170 The
> All-Soul is that aspect of the third hypostasis, i.e. Soul from which the
> human soul is emanated; since the hypostasis is rational by nature, so
> is the human soul. According to Pauliina Remes, “For Plotinus, every
> person has a single, rational and self-aware soul;171 Plotinus identifies
“the self primarily with the core self, the reasoning capacity.”172 Like

> the Writings, he also associates the rational self with the ‘higher self ’
> that will “illuminate the life of the lower self.”173 This, by implication
> makes the rational soul the higher self.174 In Plotinus’ words, “the
> We (the authentic human principle) loftily presides[s] over the Ani-
> mate,175 i.e. our animal nature.

At this point it is already clear that the Writings and Plotinus agree on
two issues: the identification of the soul as humankind’s essence and
the essential rationality of the soul. However, these are the universal
aspects of the soul that apply to all human beings, but this does not tell
us anything about our individual identity or ‘personality.’ How does
this arise? What are its foundations and what is its ultimate destiny?

10\.1: The Descent in Plotinus
For Plotinus, the origin of our personal existence is the inevitable
result of the soul’s fall into the imperfect phenomenal world. The fol-
lowing passages from Pauliina Remes summarizes Plotinus’ position:

> Our home and origin in the intelligible universe, gazing
> closely at the One or God, yet becoming a human being with
> a personality, individual characteristics and body, as well as
> a place and a task in the universe, unrelentingly ties us to the
> realm below perfection. Thus belonging to something high
> and perfect, without any individualizing characteristics, is

> contrasted with being an individual with one’s particular
> existence and personal features. Personality and individual-
> ity are understood as essential to our nature, yet connected
> to imperfection. 176

> The “intelligible universe” is, of course, the Nous (sometimes trans-
> lated as Intellect or Spirit) which contains all potentially existing
> things: “the Intellectual-Principle [Nous] is the authentic existences
> and contains them all – not as in a place but as possessing itself and
> being one thing with this content.”177 The “intelligible objects” or the
“Authentic Beings” are, akin to Plato’s Ideas, i.e. models which nature,

> a lower level of reality, aspires to and imitates in concrete individual
> examples. This is “intelligible realm” from which the soul descends;
> our personality is a consequence of this descent. From this, it is clear
> that personality or individuality begins with the soul’s existence as a
> separate entity.

According to Plotinus, the association of personality with the imper-
fection of material existence happens because

> [t]he evil that has overtaken them has its source in self-will,
> in the entry into the sphere of process and in the primal
> differentiation with the desire for self-ownership. They [the
> potential souls] conceived a pleasure in this freedom and
> largely indulged their own motion;… they came to lose even
> the thought of their origin in the Divine.178

Once again, we observe the correlation of the descent into the phe-
nomenal world and the desire for “self-ownership” and “self-will,” both
of which are attributes of personality. The soul becomes so entranced
by these desires that it forgets its divine origin. Plotinus’ word for this
is tolma which means audacity with a suggestion of hubris. This casts
the descent of the soul in a decidedly negative light. He also believes
that the soul enters phenomenal reality to actualize its potentials “by

> exhibiting those activities and productions, which remaining merely
> potential… might as well have never been…179 While this is a more
> positive reason for the descent, it is not the explanation emphasized
> by Plotinus. Finally, Plotinus claims the soul descends partly to
“bring order to its next lower [level],”180 i.e. to act as a form for lower

> levels of reality. This may be called the soul’s cosmic function. The
> Bahá’í Writings share these views, though not this attitude towards
> phenomenal existence.

10\.2: The Descent in the Writings
How well Plotinus’ doctrine of tolma coincides with the Writings
depend on how it is understood. It we interpret tolma metaphysi-
cally, i.e. as an actual choice made by a pre-existing soul, then there is
no correspondence. In the Writings, the soul makes no such choice
before coming into existence on the “material plane.” However, if it is
interpreted psychologically, as a person’s self-assertion towards God,
i.e. as an exertion of self-will and hubris, then there is a correspon-
dence. This fall occurs not before birth but can happen at any time in
our lives whenever we over-value the blessings of the material world
and obey our physical instead of our spiritual impulses.
According to the Writings, self-actualization of potential capacities
is the reason for our appearance in the phenomenal world.

> The wisdom of the appearance of the spirit in the body is
> this: the human spirit is a Divine Trust, and it must traverse
> all conditions, for its passage and movement through the
> conditions of existence will be the means of its acquiring per-
> fections. So when a man travels and passes through different
> regions and numerous countries with system and method, it
> is certainly a means of his acquiring perfection… It is the
> same when the human spirit passes through the conditions

> of existence: it will become the possessor of each degree
> and station. Even in the condition of the body it will surely
> acquire perfections.181

As in the Enneads, the soul may use its life in the phenomenal world
to actualize potentials, or acquire “perfections.” However, unlike the
Enneads, the Bahá’í Writings view self-actualization as the major
cause for our appearance in the material world, and, thereby, retain
a more positive outlook on this event. It is not a result of audacity
(tolma) or any other defect as with Plotinus.

> the journey of the soul is necessary. The pathway of life is
> the road which leads to divine knowledge and attainment.
> Without training and guidance the soul could never progress
> beyond the conditions of its lower nature, which is ignorant
> and defective.182

It is evident that the Writings and Plotinus have different emphases
in their explanations for the appearance of the soul in the phenom-
enal world. As we have already seen, for Plotinus, the appearance
in the world is a fall, the self ’s desire to exert its own unique pow-
ers even though this will separate us from the higher realm of the
Nous. Although it is an issue of contention whether or not Plotinus
thinks that earthly existence degrades the soul, it is apparent that
his attitude is ambivalent, being neither whole-hearted embrace nor
complete rejection. The following quote illustrates this:

> Under the stress of its powers and of its tendency to bring
> order to its next lower, it penetrates to this sphere in a vol-
> untary plunge; if it [the soul] turns back quickly all is well; it
> will have taken no hurt by acquiring knowledge of evil and
> coming to understand what sin is, by bringing its forces into
> manifest play by exhibiting those activities and productions,

> which remaining merely potential… might as well have
> never been…183

We observe both positive and negative elements here. On one hand,
all will be well if the soul “turns back quickly” so it will “take no hurt
by acquiring knowledge of evil and… sin.” Clearly existence in the
phenomenal world is not an unalloyed gift nor a necessary phase in
the actualization of human capacities. On the positive side of the led-
ger, Plotinus thinks the soul also provides order to the lower levels of
reality, and also actualizes its latent abilities in the phenomenal world.
However, Plotinus’ belief that matter is the ontological foundation of
evil184 casts a lugubrious shadow over his view of the material world.
The Bahá’í Writings differ from the Enneads insofar as They are
not tinged with any ambivalence about the value of our bodily exis-
tence or about our exposure to sin and evil. In regards to the latter,
Bahá’u’lláh teaches us to pray, “O Thou Whose tests are a healing
medicine to such as are nigh unto Thee.”185 The exposure to worldly
evil is conceived as a positive challenge to stimulate the growth of the
soul. Only when the soul becomes too attached to the physical world
does material existence become “a prison for heavenly souls.”186 Simi-
lar statements can be found in Plotinus, but, as noted before, they are
overshadowed by his belief that matter is characterized by inherent
ontological evil, a belief not shared by the Bahá’í Writings which see
the ‘evil’ of matter as relative and not absolute.187
Plotinus also mentions that the soul descends partly to “bring order
to its next lower [level],”188 an idea that is similar to what the Bahá’í
Writings say about humankind’s cosmic role: “For the enlightenment
of the world dependeth upon the existence of man. If man did not
exist in this world, it would have been like a tree without fruit.189
Even more dramatically, `Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> This world is also in the condition of a fruit tree, and man is
> like the fruit; without fruit the tree would be useless.190

Without humankind, the phenomenal world would lack its high-
est possible development or purpose, i.e. its final cause, and would,
thereby, remain incomplete. Of course, in the four-fold causality
accepted by `Abdu’l-Bahá,191 if the final cause is missing, there can
be no formal cause and, therefore, no order. This is virtually identical
to Plotinus’ idea that without man, the lower world would lack “order”
or form since man is the formal cause bringing order. In each case,
the human soul has a cosmic function.
According to Plotinus, the soul undertakes a “voluntary plunge.” As
Gerard O’Daly says, for Plotinus “Human existence is willed, it is a
decision;”192 “historical human existence is willed by a good soul – it
is a realization of essence on a lower level.”193 This view, which some-
what lightens the typically gloomy outlook Plotinus has on material
existence, has no counterpart in the Bahá’í Writings. According
to the Writings we do not choose our existence here, although we
do choose how to conduct ourselves once we have arrived. Plotinus
believes in this choice to re-enter the material world because he advo-
cates re-incarnation, in which souls have to decide when and how to
return. The Writings reject this option.194

11: Given Attributes Not a Blank Slate
What the Writings and the Enneads have to say about the
soul has relevance for a long-standing debate between those
who believe humans are a blank slate and those who think that
humans arrive with certain characteristics or structures pre-given.
In our view, there can be no question that for the Writings and
Plotinus, humans are not blank slates but rather pre-determined
in some essential ways. It is worth recalling here that both the

Bahá’í Writings and Plotinus agree that it is the soul which
“generates” and individuates the body and not vice versa as is so

In the case of Plotinus, this is evident from passages such as the
following:

> One Reason-Principle cannot account for distinct and dif-
> fering individuals: one human being does not suffice as the
> exemplar for many distinct each from the other not merely
> in material constituents but by innumerable variations of
> ideal type: this is no question of various pictures or images
> reproducing an original Socrates; the beings produced differ
> so greatly as to demand distinct Reason-Principles.198

Every soul has its own reason-principle or forming-principle, i.e. it
is given its individuality from the very beginning. (The World Soul
or Soul of All Things contains—albeit not in any spatial sense—all
possible reason-principles.) No one individual can be the model
for all others of its type and account for all the diversity within
a type. This implies that, in the last analysis, our individuality is
not a product of the physical body or of historical and/or cultural
circumstances or choices. Our individuality has ontological foun-
dations and is given to us.

The same is clear when `Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The personality of the rational soul is from its beginning; it is
> not due to the instrumentality of the body, but the state and the
> personality of the rational soul may be strengthened in this
> world; it will make progress and will attain to the degrees of
> perfection, or it will remain in the lowest abyss of ignorance,
> veiled and deprived from beholding the signs of God.199
`Abdu’l-Bahá clearly rejects the idea that the personality or individu-

> ality is caused by the “instrumentality of the body.” As with Plotinus,
> our existence as persons is not dependent on the body or on our
> physical condition. Instead, our “personality” or individuality is an
> inherent aspect of the human soul; it is absolutely correlated with
> our existence200 and, in that sense, is ‘given’ to us. Soul, not matter,
> individuates. Thus we are individual, particular persons from the
> very start of our journey through the phenomenal world. From our
> very beginnings, we have a unique, given ‘self ’ although it may take
> a life-time of development to actualize even a portion of its infinite
> potentials.

This inherent aspect of ourselves is also referred to as the “inmost true
self ”, as, for example, in the following statement from Bahá’u’lláh:

> Through the Teachings of this Day Star of Truth every man
> will advance and develop until he attaineth the station at
> which he can manifest all the potential forces with which his
> inmost true self hath been endowed.201

Like the soul and “innate character,” the “inmost true self ” is endowed
with divine bestowals which suggests that humans are not blank slates
but rather come into being with certain divinely given structures
and potentials or capacities. These form both our species-essence
as human beings and our individual-essence as particular persons.

In addition, these various statements strongly imply that the terms
“inmost true self,” “rational soul,” and the “innate character” refer to

the divinely given essence of man.

Another feature of humankind’s given or pre-determined nature is
our location in the ontological scale of being. Plotinus tell us that

> Humanity, in reality, is poised midway between gods and
> beasts and inclines now to the one order, now to the other;
> some men grow like to the divine, others to the brute and
> the greater number stand neutral.202

One of the innate, essential, human attributes is that we “are revealed
as the medial and mediating tensions between conflicting and diverg-
ing opposites.”203 These words could also apply to the following state-
ment by `Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Man is in the highest degree of materiality, and at the begin-
> ning of spirituality—that is to say, he is the end of imperfec-
> tion and the beginning of perfection. He is at the last degree
> of darkness, and at the beginning of light.204

In both the Writings and Plotinus our ontological position as the
meeting point of “gods and beasts” and “materiality” and “spirituality”
determines an essential aspect of our nature as human beings. This
nature is given, i.e. it is not decided by personal will or culture, and
cannot be eradicated or amended by fiat or legislation; indeed, this
ontological position is pre-determined by the One or God as one of
the essential attributes of our being. It is the ontological pre-condition
for our existence as beings endowed with moral choice. All we can do
is choose which of these two aspects of our nature we shall develop.

In the Bahá’í Writings, the ambiguity concerning the soul’s ontologi-
cal position at the border between the material and the spiritual is, as
we have seen in a previous section, also reflected in our dual nature.

> In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature
> and his material or lower nature. In one he approaches God,
> in the other he lives for the world alone. Signs of both these
> natures are to be found in men. In his material aspect he
> expresses untruth, cruelty and injustice; all these are the
> outcome of his lower nature. The attributes of his Divine
> nature are shown forth in love, mercy, kindness, truth and
> justice, one and all being expressions of his higher nature.205

> We are constituted by two contradictory natures and this gives
> us a certain ambiguity; Pauliina Remes describes humankind as
“amphibious.”206 Lest we disparage this ambiguous or amphibious

> state, it should be noted again that this ambiguity is the ontological
> pre-condition for our freedom of choice and is, thereby, one of the
> pre-conditions of our existence as humans. In any case, our “higher
> nature” is what we have inherited from God. This rational soul, our
> original personality or “inmost true self,” always remains in us and is
always available if we turn our lives towards God or the One.

> the state and the personality of the rational soul may be
> strengthened in this world; it will make progress and will
> attain to the degrees of perfection, or it will remain in the
> lowest abyss of ignorance, veiled and deprived from behold-
> ing the signs of God.207

The narrative that is constructed by the history of our choices may
be called our ‘historical self.’ When the rational soul chooses to turn
to God, we may become one of the “angels.”208 However, when the
rational soul chooses to turn towards phenomenal, material real-
ity, we develop an “ego.209 and give in to “the natural inclinations of

the lower nature”210 which “is symbolized as Satan—the evil ego
within us.”211 Shoghi Effendi says,

> The ego is the animal in us, the heritage of the flesh which
> is full of selfish desires. By obeying the laws of God, seeking
> to live the life laid down in our teachings, and prayer and
> struggle, we can subdue our egos. We call people “saints” who
> have achieved the highest degree of mastery over their egos.212

It appears that the term ‘ego’ (as used here) describes the rational soul,
self or personality when it turns away from God and the Manifesta-
tion.213 Because it is a consequence of our turning away from God, we
might say that the ‘ego’ is a construct of the rational soul which has
become too attracted to and dependent on phenomenal reality. In
this condition, we confuse our “inmost true self ” and our rational
soul with the ego, the “idol of self and vain imagination,”214 a confu-
sion which impedes spiritual progress. Blinded by this “idol” we no
longer are aware of our higher nature and our higher potentials.

12: The Hierarchical Self
The inherently ambiguous nature of the human soul complicates the
matter of personal identity insofar as the relationship between the
lower and higher self is concerned. In Plotinus, the lower aspects of
the soul are associated with its connection to the animal body and
the material world. However, the soul has not completely fallen into
physical existence. Plotinus writes,

> Even our human Soul has not sunk entire; something of it is
> continuously in the Intellectual Realm, though if that part,
> which is in this sphere of sense hold mastery, or rather be
> mastered here and troubled, it keeps us blind to what the
> upper phase holds in contemplation.215

In other words, even though the soul exists in the phenomenal world,
one aspect of the soul remains in the Nous (Intellect or Spirit). The
higher self never enters or falls into the phenomenal world where the
other, lower aspects of self are to be found. This leaves the self in an
ambiguous situation, divided or perhaps even torn between these two
aspects and, thereby, inevitably conflicted to one degree or another.
The conflict about which facet of self to favor or develop constitutes
the narrative of our lives as ethical beings.
Does Plotinus’ doctrine of the higher self remaining in the Nous (the
intelligible realm) have a counterpart in the Bahá’í Writings? Initially,
the answer appears to be negative, but further reflection suggests that
there may be a line of reasoning that could at least close the distance
between the two viewpoints. According to `Abdu’l-Bahá, “Know
thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is only
its shadow stretching out.”216 This statement leads to a crucial ques-
tion: if the phenomenal world is a shadow of the Kingdom, do human
beings also have their ‘heavenly counterpart’? If such is the case – and
that remains to be proven – then one could, indeed, claim that there
is a higher version of ourselves in the Kingdom, i.e. a ‘higher self ’ that
is has not fallen into phenomenality. This higher self could be inter-
preted as the ego with which we converse in inward consultation:

> A man may converse with the ego within him saying: “May I
> do this? Would it be advisable for me to do this work?” Such
> as this is conversation with the higher self.217

If we interpret the “higher self ” as the “higher nature”218 of the
rational soul, there is little agreement with Plotinus’ position. In
this case, our interpretation might be called psychological because
it concerns an aspect of our inner constitution. However, if we read
these passages ontologically, one could make a case that a ‘heavenly’
version of ourselves exists in the Kingdom even though we currently
dwell in the phenomenal world; this “higher self ” is what we consult

in inner deliberations. This view would be closer to Plotinus’ position.
In the last analysis, however, the extremely abstract nature of this
issue makes it doubtful that any final resolution can be reached even
by further study.
There seems little doubt that in the Bahá’í Writings our true self is
our “higher nature” or the personalized “rational soul.” This is the
self that should be in control of our embodied lives. However, in the
phenomenal world, the given, personalized “rational soul” operates
in the phenomenal world through the instrumentality of the body,
i.e. the soul’s accidental physical attribute.219 Of course, our spiritual,
higher nature should be in control, allowing the soul’s physical nature
its due, but no more.
Consequently, the Bahá’í Writings seem to present our identity in
the phenomenal world as a two-fold hierarchical structure. The foun-
dation of this structure is the rational soul, or “inmost true self ” with
its divinely bestowed personality. This foundation is given to us by
God. The second level consists of what the “rational soul” chooses
to make of itself through its powers such as the mind220 as well as its
other gifts and potencies. This might be called the ‘historical self ’ or
acquired self. It is constituted by our decisions to move towards or
away from God by the way we live. If we have chosen to turn away
from our higher selves and God, we develop an ‘ego’ in (the negative
sense) which keeps us focused on the material world and keeps us
veiled from the Kingdom. With such an ‘ego’ we develop a false con-
sciousness which supports a false identity often based on being under
control of our “lower nature.” Finally, such a false identity inevitably
causes inner dissonance for individuals, an inherent and contradiction
between the higher potentials which are always available, and the
lower choices that betray these potentials in one way or another. This
conflict cannot be resolved without turning towards God. On the
other hand, if we choose to turn towards our higher selves and God,
our ‘historical’ self ’ and our rational soul will be in harmony with

each other to one degree or another. We will be more like polished
mirrors and, we might say, we will also be ‘genuine’ because are one
with our highest self. In either case—genuine or false—the ‘histori-
cal self ’ is the self we bring into the next world.
As to the soul of man after death, it remains in the degree of purity
to which it has evolved during life in the physical body, and after
it is freed from the body it remains plunged in the ocean of God’s
Mercy.221
A similar idea can be found in the Enneads:

> the entire form, man, takes rank by the dominant [part of
> ourselves which has ruled our lives], and when the Life-Prin-
> ciple leaves the body it is what it is, what it most intensely
> lived.222

In other words, the identity we take into the next life is the one we
have created on the “material plane.”
With Plotinus, the situation regarding identity is similar but not
identical. He holds that human existence has three degrees or levels:
first, there is the person as found in the Nous or intelligible realm;
second, this higher self illuminates the person who lives by sensa-
tion; third is the lowest part of the vegetative functions of growth and
reproduction. These three are unified under the form of the highest,
i.e. humanity.223 We take our identity from that aspect of ourselves
which we choose to develop: “each person is that by which he acts,
though he is all as well.”224 That is to say, even though we are human
beings, our acquired identity is shaped by the degree according to
which we habitually choose to act. Some people act mainly on the
vegetative, i.e. the lowest biological level; others live in the materialist
world of sensations and tangible realities; and still others actualize
their uniquely human potentials. It is important to remember that

each person contains all of these levels to the degree appropriate
to our nature but of these three, the real self, is the “higher soul…
[which]… constitutes the man,”225 i.e. the soul at its highest level
which faces the ethical task of freeing itself from entrapment in the
material world:

> Our task then is to work for our liberation from this
> sphere…the total man is to be something better than a body
> ensouled…there is another life, emancipated, whose quality
> is progression towards the higher realm towards the good
> and divine… 226

These words, which harmonize well with the Writings, describe
the challenge confronting the real self of “Authentic Man.”227 The
history of meeting these challenges and making ethical decisions228
constitutes the ‘historical’ self. Here, too, we observe the two-part
hierarchy of self that we found in the Bahá’í Writings. At the founda-
tion is the ‘pure’ person as existing in the Nous or intelligible realm,
who must then choose and act in the material world, and through
choices and actions develop a ‘historical self.’ This ‘historical self ’ is
the second stage of this hierarchy. Moreover, as with the Writings,
this historical self can be in harmony or disharmony with its higher
original; it can be an ego or false consciousness, or, to use a Bahá’í
metaphor, a polished mirror.

13: A Normative Ethical Telos
The Bahá’í Writings and the Enneads share another important attri-
bute: they both hold to

> a normative telos: not just any kind of life, choices and actions
> count as self-constitution. The normative ideal, the inner self
> understood as the wholly actualized and integrated reason is

> supposed to regulate the process… unified by the active and
> goal-directed self-constitution on the part of the agent. Nor
> is the rationality in question just any kind of exercise of one’s
> cognitive capacities. It involves understanding the essential
> structures of the intelligibly ordered cosmos… 229

The “normative telos” referred to by Remes is a goal or end-state that
is appropriate for all humans since, in varying degrees, we share the
same basic nature and, therefore, the same ultimate good, i.e. resem-
blance to the One or God, and rational freedom from domination
by the material realm whether it be the external world or their own
bodies. Our actions must be in conformity with the nature of the
cosmos and our own human nature. Contrary to prevailing attitudes,

> [w]hat is sought is not an individual identity with worldly
> ties and personal experiences but something over and above
> it, a free self-determination not bound by the restrictions of
> the phenomenal realm.230

Not any action will do, no matter how sincerely motivated it may
be. To achieve the desired effects, it is imperative that our actions
accommodate themselves to the objective criteria and requirements
of cosmic and human nature. In the Bahá’í Writings, this “normative
telos” makes itself apparent in the virtues that we are expected to
strive for to the best of our ability. No consideration whatever is given
to our personal preferences or agreement:

> O SON OF SPIRIT!
> My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and radiant
> heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient, imperishable
> and everlasting.231

In this passage, Bahá’u’lláh informs us that if we wish certain
things—“sovereignty ancient, imperishable and everlasting”—we are

required to achieve certain virtues. Nothing in the content nor in the
tone of this categorical statement suggests that our preferences are
even slightly relevant. Because we have a certain nature as human
beings, certain virtues are objectively necessary for us to achieve our
goals; moreover, because these virtues are objectively necessary, there
is an imperative to achieve them.
A similar outlook prevails in Plotinus. The operation of a “normative
telos” is evident even in the First Ennead, which informs us that cer-
tain virtues are necessary in order to actualize our highest human
aspects. There is no choice about what these virtues are; they are
made necessary by the facts of our human nature. In particular,
Plotinus emphasizes sophrosyne, i.e. self-control and moderation
acquired through self-knowledge. If we wish to be fully human, then
we must know our own nature as human beings and as individuals.
This knowledge makes the actualization of these virtues possible.
(Bahá’u’lláh expresses a similar idea when He says that “man should
know his own self and recognize that which leadeth unto loftiness
or lowliness, glory or abasement.”232) For Plotinus, to be virtuous as
human beings and escape the evils of embodied existence we must
strive to resemble the One.233

> it would be good, it [the soul] would be possessed of virtue
> if it threw off the body’s moods and devoted itself to its
> own Act—the state of Intellection and Wisdom—never
> allowed the passions of the body to affect it—the virtue
> of Sophrosnyny [moderation guided by self-knowledge]—
> knew no fear at the parting from the body—the virtue of
> Fortitude—in which state is Righteousness.234

We observe that Plotinus prescribes certain actions in order to acquire
certain virtues; both of these are normative for all human beings sim-
ply because we share a universal human nature. Our actions are not

virtuous because they are sincere or express us but because they are
appropriate to the kind of beings we are.

14: Sculpting the Self
Plotinus uses the analogy of the sculptor to explain how we must
proceed to acquire the virtues we seek in order to be at our best:

> Withdraw into yourself and look. And if you do not find
> yourself beautiful yet, act as does the creator of a statue
> that is to be made beautiful: he cuts away here, he smoothes
> there… never cease chiseling your statue until there shall
> shine out on you from it the godlike splendour of virtue…235

In other words, we must consciously undertake to reform ourselves
in such a way as to let our highest potentials appear. This, of course,
requires us to know not just ourselves and our human nature, but
also what beauty is. That beauty becomes apparent when “[we]
find yourself wholly true to [our] essential nature,”236 i.e. when our
acquired historical self harmonizes with our divinely given higher
self. Moreover, Plotinus believes that our philosophical knowledge
and insight depend on the kind of lives we live and the kind of people
we are: “first, let each become godlike and each beautiful who cares
to see God and Beauty.”237 Our understanding of God or the One
and the universe, our cognition of reality, depends on the virtues we
have acquired.
The Bahá’í Writings have much the same emphasis in associating per-
sonal virtue and cognitive knowledge. `Abdu’l-Bahá summarizes the
remarks of Galen, a non-Christian philosopher and medical scientist:

> In our time there is a certain people called Christians, who,
> though neither philosophers nor scholastically trained, are

> superior to all others as regards their morality. They are per-
> fect in morals. Each one of them is like a great philosopher
> in morals, ethics and turning toward the Kingdom of God.238

The Christians’ cognitive knowledge of ethics depends on the moral
condition they have achieved. To appreciate the full significance of
this, we must recall that ‘ethics’ in this context means the objective
knowledge of what actions are objectively appropriate to human
nature and not merely rationalized preferences, acting in ‘good faith’
or sincere self-expression. We also see this more objective outlook
when Bahá’u’lláh says, “man should know his own self and recognize
that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or abasement,
wealth or poverty.”239 This self-knowledge is a pre-condition for fol-
lowing the “straight path [which] is the one which guideth man to the
dayspring of perception and to the dawning-place of true understand-
ing.”240 This emphasis on the connection between attaining personal
virtue and cognitive philosophical knowledge is a typical feature of
classical Greco-Roman philosophy with its recognition of philosophy
as a way of life and not just a matter of theoretical knowledge.241
Furthermore, the Bahá’í Writings, albeit in different language, have
a concept parallel to Plotinus’ image of the sculptor of self. Just as the
sculptor chisels away and smoothes over unacceptable aspects of his
art work, Bahá’ís are told to sacrifice, i.e. give up those aspects of self
that impede making moral progress. `Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is
> bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is
> the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of the living
> God may then shine forth. The martyr’s field is the place of
> detachment from self, that the anthems of eternity may be
> upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self… 242

> It is through sacrifice that we ‘carve’ or ‘sculpt’ ourselves, removing
> undesirable attributes as a sculptor removes unwanted marble from a
> statue. Such removal is the “dying to self.” We also have to be practice
“detachment from self ” by looking and judging ourselves objectively,

> not by our personal preferences but by the criteria provided by the
> divinely revealed Writings. Another statement by `Abdu’l-Bahá
emphasizes these points:

> With reference to what is meant by an individual becoming
> entirely forgetful of self: the intent is that he should rise
> up and sacrifice himself in the true sense, that is, he should
> obliterate the promptings of the human condition, and rid
> himself of such characteristics as are worthy of blame and
> constitute the gloomy darkness of this life on earth—not
> that he should allow his physical health to deteriorate and
> his body to become infirm.243
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s injunction tells us to “obliterate” the unwanted aspects

> of ourselves, just as Plotinus’ sculptor chisels away unwanted marble.
> (Of course, neither the Writings nor Plotinus approve of asceticism,
> as we have already discussed above.) The underlying idea in both
> cases is the same: we must exercise our free will and our power to
> shape ourselves according to a standard that appropriately adapts
> us to the ontological structure of reality and to the eternal spiritual
> realm instead of merely to our temporary residence in material reality.

Pauliina Remes’ statement about the Enneads is equally true of the
Bahá’í Writings:

> In contrast to modern accounts of selfhood as a process or a
> story in time, for Plotinus the end is – or should be – fixed.
> Only a process leading towards what is good and beautiful
> counts as true self-constitution. The normative ideal acts
> also as a regulative principle. Embodied selfhood is always a

> process towards ideal unity, rationality and virtue, a lifelong
> exercise in becoming what we are… What is sought is not an
> individual identity with worldly ties and personal character-
> istics but something over and above it.244

In other words, the Bahá’í Writings and the Enneads share a common
understanding of what constitutes true or genuine selfhood. We
should not give unqualified assent to the notion that ‘genuine’ self-
hood is merely any life-story whatever; every person inevitably has a
life-story but every life-story does not constitute a genuine, true self
according to the criteria laid down by the Writings or the Enneads.245
Bahá’u’lláh’s injunction to know ourselves clearly indicates that self-
deception about ourselves is possible,246 as do the countless passages
about being led “astray.” For the Writings and the Enneads the goal is
to seek an identity that does not exclude but transcends material and
worldly considerations. As `Abdu’l-Bahá says, “become yourselves
the saints of the Most High!”247 In this sense, both the Writings and
the Enneads share what may be called the ‘perennialist’ concept of self,
i.e. the concept that genuine selfhood requires trying to meet certain
ethical and spiritual standards in order to prepare us for a better lives
in the future. These standards are almost universal and re-appear in
all of the world’s major religions. The re-appearance of these generally
similar concepts of self in various forms are, of course, one of the
implications of the essential unity of religions.

15: Union with God
The ultimate human goal according to the Bahá’í Writings and the
Enneads is nearness to or unity with God, but what this actually
means must be carefully explored in each case. Both agree that the
closer we are to God or the One, the more truly we are ourselves, the
more authentic we become; in other words, we become more like our

essential, spiritual selves and achieve our higher destiny. The Bahá’í
Writings tell us that

> The greatest attainment in the world of humanity is nearness
> to God. Every lasting glory, honor, grace and beauty which
> comes to man comes through nearness to God. Every lasting
> glory, honor, grace and beauty which comes to man comes
> through nearness to God. All the Prophets and apostles
> longed and prayed for nearness to the Creator.248

The matter could not be stated more clearly; this “attainment” has
no equal in the phenomenal world, meaning that no amount of
knowledge, technological progress, creative cultural sophistication or
political wisdom can compensate for its lack. This goal is irreplace-
able. However, in the Bahá’í Writings, “nearness to God” does not
imply even the slightest suggestion that human beings can in any way
or from any perspective become ontologically one with God.249

> there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one true
> God with His creation, and no resemblance whatever can
> exist between the transient and the Eternal, the contingent
> and the Absolute.250

The ontological difference between an absolutely independent God
and an absolutely dependent human is unalterable. Proclus seems to
suggest the same idea when he writes,

> Prop. 9. All that is self-sufficient either in its existence or in
> its activity is superior to that which is not self-sufficient but
> dependent upon another existence which is the cause of its
> completeness.251

Things cannot be superior or even equal to that on which they depend
as long as the dependency relationship lasts. In the case of the One,

or God, this is bound to be eternal. It is, therefore, inconceivable
that humans and God could become ontologically one and any such
assertions must be rejected as mistaken understandings. To assume
such a union has taken place, is, in effect, to elevate ourselves to the
rank of the Manifestations.252 A mergence of self and God may be
experienced psychologically, but, as the foregoing passage shows, this
experience must not be interpreted ontologically. Consequently, for
Bahá’ís, “nearness to God” means, for example, something like a
mergence of our individual wills into the will of the Manifestation,
or a psychological loss of self-consciousness in a vision of the Divine
splendour, or our ecstasy of spiritual insight and knowledge of the
mysteries of creation,253 or our elation at escaping from the prison
of the ego. (This is not, of course, intended as a complete list of pos-
sibilities.) In each of these examples, there is a loss of self/ego, i.e. a
psychological state which is not to be confused with an actual, i.e.
ontological, union with God. On this matter, psychology—the expe-
rience of union with the Divine—does not reflect itself in ontology.
The mediator between God and humankind is the Manifestation
Whose “double station”254 enables Him to represent God as “One
Whose voice is the voice of God Himself ” as well as the human sta-
tion. Given the impossibility of ontological union with God, the only
way to achieve “nearness to God” is through our relationship to the
Manifestation:

> In all the Divine Books the promise of the Divine Presence
> hath been explicitly recorded. By this Presence is meant the
> Presence of Him Who is the Dayspring of the signs, and the
> Dawning-Place of the clear tokens, and the Manifestation
> of the Excellent Names, and the Source of the attributes, of
> the true God, exalted be His glory. God in His Essence and
> in His own Self hath ever been unseen, inaccessible, and
> unknowable. By Presence, therefore, is meant the Presence
> of the One Who is His Vicegerent amongst me.255

The Báb states,

> [t]here is no paradise more wondrous for any soul than to
> be exposed to God’s Manifestation in His Day, to hear His
> verses and believe in them, to attain His presence, which is
> naught but the presence of God, to sail upon the sea of the
> heavenly Kingdom of His good-pleasure, and to partake of
> the choice fruits of the paradise of His divine Oneness.256
These passages leave no doubt that attaining the presence of the

> Manifestation is what the Writings mean by attaining the presence
> of or “nearness to God.” This concept obviously affects the Bahá’í
> understanding or interpretation of concepts such as ‘union’ with God,
‘mystical’ experiences of God as well as cataphatic as well as apophatic

> theology. For example, if attaining the “Divine Presence” means
> attaining the presence of the Manifestation, what is involved in the
> latter, especially for those Who never knew Bahá’u’lláh personally?
> In what sense and to what extent is a Bahá’í cataphatic theology pos-
> sible since the Manifestation can be known, at least to some extent?
> Or, conversely, must Bahá’í theology necessarily be apophatic? These
> and other questions await further exploration.

In Plotinus, the issue of “nearness to God” is less clear than in the
Bahá’í Writings. Whether or not the human soul merges with the
One ontologically or only psychologically by losing consciousness of
itself is not easily settled. For example, it is possible to argue that the
following passages show that there is complete ontological union.

> In this seeing [of the One], we neither hold and object nor
> trace distinction; there is no two. The man is changed, no
> longer himself nor self-belonging; he is merged with the
> Supreme, sunken into it, one with it… 257

Even more dramatically, Plotinus writes,

> she [the soul] has seen that presence [of the One] suddenly
> manifesting within her, for there is nothing between; there
> is no longer a duality but a two in one; for, so long as the
> presence holds, all distinction fades; it is the lover and the
> beloved here… the soul has now no further awareness of
> being in a body and will give herself no foreign name, not
> man, not living being not being… 258

> When the soul becomes united with the One, it does not lose con-
> sciousness of being a separate identity but rather it loses its separate
> existence and thus become indistinguishable from the One. It has,
> so to speak, been ontologically ‘up-graded’ from a dependent and
> contingent to an independent and non-contingent. This situation
> raises questions about how this identity can be regained after the
> moment of union is over. If the self is lost ontologically, how can it be
> regained without continuing to exist in some way? Questions of this
> kind prompt scholars such as J.M. Rist reject the notion of the soul’s
‘obliteration’ in the One.

> while the soul as a spiritual substance can be enveloped by
> the One, enraptured, surrendered, wholly characterized so
> as to become infinite and not finite, it is neither obliterated
> nor revealed as the One itself… 259

In some way, the distinct soul continues to exist even while new
hitherto unimaginable potentials become actualized in this state
of union; however, the soul does not disappear or become the One.
This position is strengthened by its logical consistency with Plotinus’
characterization of the One. For example, Plotinus states that “the
Supreme as containing no otherness is ever present with us,”260 mean-
ing that even though the One is always with us, it does not, thereby,

contain any “otherness,” i.e. other substances or individuals. “We are
ever before the Supreme”261 says Plotinus; we can contemplate it and
lose ourselves in the contemplation but we can never be it. If we could,
the One would contain ‘otherness.’ Pauliina Remes takes a similar
position.

> The problem with the idea that the human soul could unite with
> the One is the fact that the One is supposed to be complete
> and self-sufficient. If it were possible to ‘add’ something to
> it, its completeness and uniqueness might be compromised…
> The One remains beyond substance and human soul.262

In other words, the concept that the union of self and the One is
ontological contradicts the essential, self-sufficient nature of the One
as well as its being beyond the category of “substance.” Indeed, if the
One is infinite in its self-sufficiency, how can anything be added to
that which is infinite? Remes also claims that “[t]there is no danger of
getting lost in the One”263 because the formless and limitless nature
of the One is inherently incompatible with the nature of the rational
soul which “grasps things through limits and definitions—through
rational or intellectual activity.”264 If the soul loses its inherent,
essential nature, it would no longer exist, and that, once again, raises
extremely difficult questions about how the limited rational soul
could return to existence after the end of its union with the One.
Plotinus himself recognizes this difficulty:

> yet, there comes the moment of descent… and after that
> sojourn in the divine, I ask myself how it happens that I can
> now be descending, and how the Soul ever enter into my
> body… 265

There are no obvious answers to the many questions surrounding the
question of union with the One. For example, is the body the ‘anchor’
during the time of union? How can the individual soul or higher self

re-constitute itself after it has lost its distinguishing essential and
personal attributes in the One? Re-constituting oneself after the
self has been ontologically eliminated seems contradictory since it
requires one to exist when one does not! Or is there a remnant of
self? But if the latter is the case, the union is not fully ontological but
at least partly psychological since a remnant remains even though it
may not be conscious of itself as different from the One.

While this difficult issue in Neoplatonic studies is one for special-
ists to solve, if, indeed, that is possible, we can say that the Bahá’í
Writings are only compatible with the psychological interpretation
of the union with the One. From the Bahá’í perspective, any sugges-
tion that the created can attain the ontological status of the Creator
is inadmissible because the absolutely dependent can never become
absolutely independent. Such an assertion would be equivalent to
claiming the same ontological status as God:

> Beware, beware, lest thou be led to join partners with the Lord,
> thy God. He is, and hath from everlasting been, one and
> alone, without peer or equal, eternal in the past, eternal in
> the future, detached from all things, ever-abiding, unchange-
> able, and self-subsisting.266

> In short, the Bahá’í Writings do not allow us to change our onto-
> logical status. The claim that we can unite with God ontologically
> violates the principle that God is “one and alone” since such a claim
> makes it possible for us to ‘end’ God’s aloneness and His ‘one-ness.’
> It also means that God is no longer “detached from all things” and
“unchangeable” since the mergence with the human soul suggests that

> something has been ‘added’ to the Divine. This, in turn, undermines
> the concept of God as “self-subsisting” since the very possibility of
‘adding’ anything to God means that God was in some way ‘defi-

cient’ before the addition was made, and, therefore, dependent on

> the addition to be complete. A similar point can be made for “ever-
> abiding.” If it is possible to ‘add’ anything to God, He cannot be
“ever-abiding;” nor can He be “eternal” in the past and future because

> there would a ‘before’ and ‘after’ the union. Finally, if a soul, i.e. a
> dependent creation can raise its ontological status to ‘independent’
> from ‘dependent,’ then obviously God is not “without peer or equal.”

16: Sympathy

One of the key principles of Plotinian thought is that of ‘sympathy,’ i.e.
“the view that since the world is a living organism, whatever happens

> in one part of it must produce a sympathetic reaction in ever other
> part.”267 In other words, creation is a unity made up of inter-active
> parts none of which exist or can exist in isolation. The Stoics called
> this view “cosmic sympathy;”268 it was a point of agreement among all
> ancient philosophies except the materialists and atheists. According
to Plotinus, every created thing

> while executing its own function, works in with every other
> member of the All from which its distinct task has by no
> means cut it off; each performs its act, each receives some-
> thing from the others, each one at its own moment bringing
> its touch of sweet or bitter.269

In short, directly or indirectly, everything influences everything else
in some way and thereby helps make the world what it is. `Abdu’l-
Bahá teaches the same idea:

> For all beings are connected together like a chain; and
> reciprocal help, assistance and interaction belonging to the
> properties of things are the causes of the existence, evelop-
> ment and growth of created beings. It is confirmed through

> evidences and proofs that every being universally acts upon
> other beings, either absolutely or through association.270
The concept of a “chain” reminds us of the ancient concept of the
“great chain of being”271 which holds all elements of creation together

> in a coherent order based on ontological levels. In `Abdu’l-Bahá’s
> statement, reciprocal interactions are the “causes of existence” which
> means that nothing can exist or come into existence in isolation. Such
> interactions are also necessary for “development and growth,” sug-
> gesting thereby that self-actualization of all latent potentials requires
> the presence of a community of beings and is not something that can
> be done alone – or for oneself alone. In one way or another, at least
> some actions must be adapted to the community context in which
> things find themselves.

However, `Abdu’l-Bahá does not think that the interactive process in
the phenomenal, material world is self-directed but rather requires
guidance:

> a universal power inevitably existeth, which encompasseth all,
> directing and regulating all the parts of this infinite creation;
> and were it not for this Director, this Co-ordinator, the uni-
> verse would be flawed and deficient. It would be even as a mad-
> man… every separate par of it performing its own task with
> complete reliability… Thus it is clear that a Universal Power
> existeth, directing and regulating this infinite universe. Every
> rational mind can grasp this fact.272

> It is evident, therefore, that the powers of sympathy and influence in
> the phenomenal, material world do not function randomly or capri-
> ciously; their actions are necessary but are not sufficient to explain
> the order we observe. To provide a complete, adequate explanation a
“Universal Power” is needed which cannot only provide cosmic order

by guiding the interactive processes through law, but can also help
explain the origin of physical laws, and the origin of the capacity to
influence and be influenced. Obviously, such a power must transcend
the phenomenal world.
Plotinus agrees. In the Enneads, he compares things of the universe
to members of a “dance-play”273 in which each dancer plays a part in
order that is “the coordinating All.”274

> The Circuit does not go by chance but under the Reason-
> Principle of the living whole; therefore, there must be a
> harmony between cause and caused; there must be some
> order ranging things to each other’s purpose or in due
> relations to each other.275

Change and motion, the interactive process of things, (“the Circuit”)
creates a rational order through influence or sympathy, i.e. the “har-
mony between cause and caused.” Without that harmonized sympathy
or influence, the cosmic process would be random and capricious and
the Universe could not be a “living whole” let alone a rational order.

17\. Conclusion
In the two parts this paper, we have focussed on major areas of
similarity between the Bahá’í Writings and the Enneads in regards
to ontology, epistemology, ethics and philosophical anthropology.
Naturally, this study is not complete, but it does provide an initial
foray into this hitherto largely unexplored field of studies. From this
investigation we are able to draw three conclusions.
First, the similarities between the Writings and the Enneads are
numerous and far-reaching on the foremost issues. In this sense, the
philosophy embedded in the Writings and the philosophy explicated

by the Enneads are ‘sister-philosophies,’ i.e. they bear a close family
resemblance to one another.
Second, these foundational similarities open new worlds to explore
in regards to the philosophy embedded in the Writings and classical
Neoplatonic and Greco-Roman philosophy, a field that is currently
subject to dramatically increased interest. The relevance is not lim-
ited to specific teachings but also includes such issues as the nature of
philosophy and how philosophy should be pursued.
Third, the similarities between the Writings and the Enneads form
a solid foundation for in-depth philosophical dialogue with three
major religious traditions whose philosophical expression over the
centuries has been heavily influenced by Neoplatonism: Christianity,
Islam and Judaism. Such dialogue is important because it concerns
the intellectual basis on which their teachings and attitudes are built.
