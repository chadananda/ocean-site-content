The Fikr, only journal currently published in Tauris, carried the following
article:
During these last years, some plotters had endeavoured to sow suspicion
between the government and the nation; to stir dissension between the
constitutionalists and the reactionaries! It was everywhere proclaimed: If the
government and nation do not become constitutionalists, religion will
disappear! We had been told this so much, that we were persuaded and
convinced of it. At last the government and the people came to agreement
and the organic laws were drawn and printed. We all know them; their limits
are precise, and the acts of government, as those of the nation also, must be
in accord with both the civil and the religious Law.
However, at that moment, someone, dressed in the garb of Islam, set about
gathering all that was needed to raise, between the government and nation at
last in agreement, the germs of dissension and hatred. Soon one could see
that certain individuals, enemies of Islam, whose garb they wore, were
carefully chosen by certain others. They were specifically charged to
prevent, by whatever means, the entente from becoming established.
Among these last, shines the name of Mirza Ghaffar Zenouzi, popular
tribune. This hypocrite, beating on his chest with the stone of Islamism,
shouted from the rostrum: “Islam has disappeared! Islam is dead!” Certainly
all of you, inhabitants of Tauris, know him. Then the people of the governor
general arrested him2 and found him to be the carrier of the two letters
which we publish below. One of these letters is signed by Mirza Ghaffar
himself and is addressed to Saint-Jean d’Acre; the other comes from the
hand of Abdoul-Béha, signed with his seal and addressed to Mirza Ghaffar.

Abdoul-Béha et la situation [article traduit par A.-L.-M. Nicolas, sous le pseudonyme de Ghilan],
Revue du Monde Musulman (Paris), 1912, vol. 21, p. 261-267. Editor’s note: regarding this article, we read in
Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání’s diary for Sunday, August 24, 1912, “The newspaper `Fikr' [Thought] was mentioned,
and He continued: “In this newspaper our letter speaks for itself. We are far from taking part in any seditious
movement and we hold fast to the will of the Lord.” (Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání, Mahmud's Diary: The Diary of
Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání, translated by Mohi Sobhani, George Ronald, Oxford, 1998.

Mirza Ghaffar frequented the Lazarite school in Tauris. As such he was more or less, and rather less,
protected by the French consulate. As the Consul was absent, a Lazarite went directly to the governor Choudja ed-
Dowlé. This behaviour was not pleasing and the Lazarite was not admitted. Mirza Ghaffar was condemned to
death, to be executed that very night. At nine o’ clock in the evening, the Consul’s wife, made aware of the
situation, telephoned Choudja ed-Dowlé to ask for mercy for the guilty. Choudja ed-Dowlé granted it with the best
grace in the world and Mirza Ghaffar was released.

I wish for you to publish these two documents so that Persians may become
aware of the hidden springs of certain events and understand, at the same
time as the goals pursued, the twisted means adopted. They will then know
whence come the widespread tides of blood, and from what source emanate
the troubles and discord. They will understand where is the centre of activity
seeking to throw to the winds the might of government. Then, perchance,
the blinded Persian nation will be able to recognise where her friends are to
be found and who her enemies are.
Letter of Abdoul-Béha
O friends of Abdoul-Béha! The Creator of the world is bestirred! The cloud
of divine mercy is moved! The light of God hath appeared and rises over all
horizons! It is the cause of tranquillity for all created beings. This is the time
for goodwill and union stretching to the high heavens! This is the peal of the
bell of unity and concord, sounding from the mysteries of glory! Man has
found felicity once more, while the shadows have cleared. The freed have
recovered their joy; the sea of unity is astir with crashing waves, and union’s
zephyr blows from the flowerbed of mercy3. Each one of God’s friends must
become even as a regiment, and make their hearts steadfast through
unveiling and making visible the truths, evidences, insights and meanings.
The divine bugles must proclaim the glad tidings of God, and attract the
souls to happiness in these good news.
Call all men to the light of guidance, and give the glad tidings of the great
gift! Soon will this land, through the bounty of the God of all the world,
become purified and be the object of heaven’s envy! The banner of guidance
will be raised! The curtains that conceal the unity of the human world will
be lifted! East and West will become one! Between North and South there
will be no more differences! The basis of all things will be founded upon
unity, and all mention of the opposer will die out! The Most Great Name,
may the souls of his servants be a sacrifice for Him, has destroyed all
obstacles, torn away all bonds. He shows forth love for everyone, casting
the blessing of unity into the thronged multitudes; spreading its benevolence
to each being in this world and counselling and bidding everyone to profit
from the lights of Truth and benefit from the ultimate Beauty!
Therefore do not look upon the faults nor defects of anyone! Pay no heed to
envy or hostility! Become, one and all, the tokens of God’s mercy, and
endeavour to obtain forgiveness from everyone! Thus will ye change the
stranger into an intimate, and every oppressor into a friend of justice! The
ignorant, summon ye to knowledge! Guide the steps of the wayward to the
Sirat! Act with the greatest joy, the most perfect goodwill, with all your
soul! May the glory of the All-Glorious rest upon you.

Whether this tableau refers to Persia or the world in general, it must be confessed that it does not
remotely resemble reality.

412      Ismael Velasco                                         Situation in Tauris

Letter of Mirza Ghaffar
O my Master! O Abdoul-Béha!
I write with extraordinary ardour and love! I yearn to kiss thy blessed feet!
May it please heaven that as those who have at this moment the honour of
attaining thy presence, I may take my portion of this immense boon! For I,
who am nameless before the existence of that Sultan of Being, have rejoiced
in the recognition of this great Cause! It is through the blessing of the
marvellous preaching and exhortations of my dear friend Mounir Divan that
from darkness’ shadows I have stepped into the world of lights! It is thanks
to him that I have become a unit in the army of the friends! Praised and
glorified be God!
At the command of my guide, Mirza Ebrahim Mounir Divan, I will recount
the dream that was my guide and the cause of my conversion. I will share
also a strange dream I had, two years ago, in Téhéran. The night of the 12
djemmedi el-evvel 1330, I saw a corridor 4 metres wide, but with a length
of many farsakhs. It stretched out in a straight line. The ceilings and walls of
this strange corridor were carpeted with polished fabrics of many colours
and great price. Suddenly, I arrived at a door that was on the right hand side
and opened into a room. Numerous people entered and left this room.
A young man, handsome, of tall stature, who wore on his koulah the
insignias of the Soultan4 of the Persian army, was sitting, in the room, on a
chair. Another young man, like a servant, stood nearby. Suddenly I saw my
eldest brother approach. Thereupon I understood I had stumbled into a
gathering of Béhaïs. I then began to insult my brother, telling him: “O my
brother, do you know what you have done? You have become a Béhaï! You
have dishonoured our family!” I spoke to him thus for a long time! The
moment when, carried away, I overflowed with the most awful insults, I felt
of a sudden a revolver in my hand! I shot at him and struck his back on his
right. He bled profusely, but did not move. Only a faint smile hovered on his
lips, whilst he gazed at me.
The one who seemed the servant of the Sultan addressed me violently:
“Brother!” he told me, “Why do you torment the people? Why do you pull
the curtains thus? Perhaps the majority of men share in the beliefs of this
religion! What have you to meddle in the religion of another?” But the
Sultan silenced him: “What is this to do with you? How many times have I
told you not to get involved in what does not concern you? Such a person
acts, acts, acts, and ends up by exhausting himself!” I shot a few bullets at
the domestic and he was gravely wounded. But neither he nor my brother
died.

A subordinate officer in the Persian army

Fearing that I might be questioned, I moved on. I was leaving in a troubled
state, when suddenly I stepped on a precipice more than 1000 metres deep.
It rose above an ocean dark and full of waves. Were I to move in the
slightest, I was indubitably lost. My head turned and suddenly I began to
insult myself: “Wretched one! Why did you not perceive this earlier! You
could have avoided this misfortune!” I had such fear, that I could not turn
back my steps. The cliff plunged abruptly into the sea. I fell all the while
screaming like a madman. But, suddenly, I saw my brother who, with the
smile still on his lips, stretched out his arms and caught me. I was so
ashamed I turned away… and awoke. I declared my faith the same day!
As to my dream in Téhéran, which I have written on my notebooks as a
political dream, it is as follows:
“I saw, in a dark night, two dragons, similar to those which are struck on
Chinese coins, that is head raised, tail hanging, suspended between heaven
and earth. They were yellow and spotted and one would have described
them as golden by the light of the setting sun. Suddenly a two headed eagle,
full of eagerness, claws outstretched, plunged toward them. These two did
not pay, at the beginning, the least heed; but the eagle having reached their
vicinity, the dragons turned their heads toward it. The eagle then withdrew,
then returned to the charge. At this moment a tiger assailed the dragons; then
a panther made its appearance and joined the battle. A wolf arrived, then a
stag, and an elephant. All fell on the dragons and the attacks increased.
All these wilds beasts found themselves, now in the air, now on the floor.
I then saw an enormous lion, but very old and very thin. With perfect
slowness, caused by its weakness, it marched slowly towards the dragons. It
sought to keep itself on the air, but he was so feeble that he advanced only
with great difficulty. He went thus till he reached the dragons. Suddenly
these, with an infernal noise, exploded. One of them was surely an
instrument of hellfire, since all around him took flame. All the wild beasts
disappeared. There was naught but those multicoloured sparks one witnesses
in fireworks. I awoke trembling with fear.
May I be offered up as a sacrificed to the friends!
I beseech my Master to please to honour me with the explanation of these
dreams and instruct me as to the services I may render the Cause5
Translation: Ghilan6

One can get a sense of the mentality of Abdoul-Béha’s adepts. The misfortune is that this incident
alerted the Musulmans and that little by little the Béhaïs were thrown out, in Tauris, from administrative posts
