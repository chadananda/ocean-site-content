Introduction

The concept of wealth is difficult to define or measure
because it is mainly a stock of assets such as house, land or
personal possessions and accumulated money; therefore, it is
different from income. Income is a flow while wealth is a stock.
If we define wealth as the abundance of valuable possessions
and assets, then it is difficult to measure because they can be
appreciated or depreciated. The question is how income and
wealth affect well-being, standard of living, and the creation of
a happy life. Currently, Gross Domestic Product (or GDP)
measures standard of living and economic growth in a country.
This measurement is based solely on the monetary value of
goods and services and ignores for example negative
externalities such as the production of those unnecessary and
damaging products affecting the life of humans, animals, and
the environment. A ‘happy life’ could not be measured in terms
of monetary values alone but rather in terms of well-being;
income being one of the features. With ‘well-being’ the all-
encompassing levels of deprivation need to be addressed. For
example, a good society should be measured in terms of how
human rights is respected and practiced, or in terms of how
women and girls are treated. Hence, those values applied in
current socio-political-economic systems need to be revised.
Religion can suggest values that can redirect attention away
from selfish greed and the need to own and consume. Values
such as honesty, trustworthiness, compassion, cooperation and
fairness are moral resources and should become part of an
economic system.

Wealth accumulation

According to economist Thomas Piketty, “The distribution
of wealth is one of today’s most widely discussed and
controversial issues.”1 Piketty is concerned about the long-term
evolution of wealth. He raises questions such as: do the
dynamics of private capital accumulation inevitably lead to the

Role of Religion in Wealth and Poverty                           7

concentration of wealth in ever fewer hands? The problem of
wealth accumulation and its concentration in the hands of a
few is expanding and keeps growing locally, nationally, and
globally. As the economy grows, concentration of private
wealth gets worse. Exploring this view, Oxfam has been giving
depressing updates on wealth concentration each year. For
example, they have reported that in 2010, 388 richest people in
the world owned more wealth than that owned by the bottom
half of the world population. In 2014, 85 richest people were in
the same position. In 2015 the number reduced to 80 people.
This year (2016) Oxfam predicted that 62 richest people own
more wealth than the total wealth of the bottom half of world
population. Sadly, the private wealth concentration is getting
worse and worse each year.

This kind of wealth accumulation and its concentration in
the hands of few is dangerous because it causes imbalance in the
market and economic activities including shortages and
surpluses of products and hence wastage of valuable rare earth
resources. Concentration of wealth also means concentration
of social and political power, and concentration of privileges,
and opportunities. This may cause destroying harmony and
democracy, and pushes the world towards social explosions. The
reverse is also true, if we do not have any wealth, we have no
power, no privileges, and no opportunities. The bottom 50% of
the world population who own only a small fraction of 1% of
the global wealth, belong to this category. Concentration of
wealth was observed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, He said if “…some are
accumulating exorbitant wealth and others are in dire want —
under such a system it is impossible for man to be happy.” [FWU 39]

Concentration of wealth is an ongoing non-stop process
under the present economic system. A current economic
assumption is that human happiness can be achieved merely by
increasing the wealth of the individual members of society. The
underlying assumption is that all human beings are motivated
by self-interest, selfishness and greed and that the more any
particular economic policy caters for these base motivations,

8                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

the more successful it will be. The self is primarily seen seeking
to maximize his or her own utility, often through maximization
of consumption opportunity. The root idea flowing from self-
interest is consumer sovereignty and utility maximisation. The
rationale is that consumers know their interests best and can act
to advance them through exchange. For many, prosperity lies in
increasing consumption and each consumer will pursue his or
her opportunities until the marginal cost of a transaction
exceeds the benefits of it. Each person maximizes utility or
happiness subject to a number of constraints, including
income. Thus, the economic theory considers mainly monetary
aspects of life and ignores other factors, such as those values
that are essential for creating interactions among people, and
those necessary values for protecting the environment, and
respecting the future generation.

Let us draw our attention to the point that the richest people
are not necessarily immoral people, as popularly imagined; it is
partly the systems that allow them to behave immoral. Since
1776 with the publication of The Wealth of Nations by Adam
Smith, that the modern economic system or the free market
economy has been in operation, those in power and perhaps
with good intentions have tried to bring a better life for the
generality of the population, but the manipulation,
mismanagement and abuse of systems has created a condition
which led to widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
Shoghi Effendi in 1927 perceived the need for a system that
“…prevents among others the gradual control of wealth in the
hands of a few and the resulting state of both extremes, wealth
and poverty.”2 It can also be said that wealthy people have
enormous political power and influence and do not allow
decision-makers to prevent them from becoming even
wealthier. The current free market system is out of control and
does not convey the original message advocated by its founder,
Adam Smith, in his second book The Theory of Moral
Sentiments. In this book, Smith discusses the position of
philosophers and those in charge of the society. He argues that

Role of Religion in Wealth and Poverty                          9

it would be contradictory and unjust for them just to think
about their own self-interest. Instead they should cultivate a
sense of public duty in order to be any good at helping to solve
the world’s most pressing problems. Disappointingly, this vital
and critical idea of the founder of the free market system is
forgotten. There is a need for a new way of thinking to change
the economic structure of the whole society. The Universal
House of Justice believe that “A fresh look at the problem is
required…”3 And in a more recent statement it is stated “With
prevailing modes of thought found to be badly wanting, the
world is in desperate need of a shared ethic, a sure framework
for addressing the crises that gather like storm clouds.”4 In
reference to capitalism, in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi, it is stated: “There is nothing in the teachings against
some kind of capitalism; it present form, though, would require
adjustments to be made.”5

Concerning the issue of poverty, the current process of
globalization, although defective in many ways, is one way for
poverty reduction. According to the World Bank, the number
of people who have come out of absolute poverty in last three
decades has fallen from 1.2 billion to 700 million.6 The concern,
however, is that the poverty reduction has not occurred evenly
across the globe. Supporting this view, the Noble Memorial of
Economic Science 2001, Joseph Stiglitz writes:

> countries and people are not sharing in its benefits.

Another worrying condition of current process of
globalization is that increasing the wealth of the rich is much
steeper than the decline of the poverty level, and this is exactly
the concern in the Bahá’í writings, and hence advocating the
role of government in elimination of extremes of wealth and
poverty. According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “The government of the
countries should conform to the Divine Law which gives equal
justice to all. This is the only way in which the deplorable
superfluity of great wealth and miserable, demoralizing,
degrading poverty can be abolished” [PT 159]. He, elsewhere
emphasizes the important role of government in balancing the
economic power:

> There must be special laws made, dealing with these
> extremes of riches and of want. The members of the
> Government should consider the laws of God when they
> are framing plans for the ruling of the people. The
> general rights of mankind must be guarded and
> preserved. [PT 159]

The role of religion

For a discussion of the role and function of religion and its
connection with wealth and poverty we need to understand and
be clear about the claims of the Founders of Faiths and the
nature of the contents of Holy Scriptures and the ways they can
be interpreted. Did for example, Mu˙ammad, Jesus, Moses,
Bahá’u’lláh and other Prophets of God appear to solve our
economic problems? Did anyone of these Prophets claim to be

Role of Religion in Wealth and Poverty                        11

experts in wealth creation and poverty eradication? Are the
Holy Scriptures academic textbooks containing materials on
the subject of wealth and poverty? The Bahá’í Writings
maintain the view that these prophets are divine educators, and
Holy Scriptures are guidance for better living and creating
love, fellowship and unity amongst people. Bahá’u’lláh states:
“The Prophets and Messengers of God have been sent down for
the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the straight Path of
Truth” [GWB 156-157]. However, religions also have expressed
views on how the poor and the rich should be treated. There are
principle guidelines, recommendations and commandments
about what should be consumed, what should be produced, and
the way resources should be distributed. These instructions are
mainly with moral and spiritual foundation affecting human
behaviours. These guidelines help experts in different fields to
device programs, models and systems with a moral and ethical
approach.

The main functions of religion in relation to wealth and
poverty can be summarized as follows: First, religion can
redirect human thought to spiritual concerns, focusing on
spiritual aspect of wealth and poverty, and remind them of the
duty to care for other human beings. It can be argued that
alleviating poverty is about restoring the caring attitude. A
number of spiritual principles supports this claim, for example,
the Christian command “Love your neighbor as yourself,”8 the
Islamic command of Muslim brotherhood which states “without
doubt believers are brothers of one another,”9 the Jewish
appreciation of Jewish community solidarity, and Bahá’u’lláh’s
exhortations to the Bahá’ís: “Consort with the followers of all
religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship” [GWB 95].
These statements are clearly reflecting upon relationship and
interdependence by way of love, a condition necessary to
appropriate wealth creation and poverty alleviation. The true
spirit of all the Faiths can influence this aspect of human
affairs. Second, religion can provide the ethical function.
Altruism is a human quality, which emphasises the human

12                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

responsibility towards others. Religion reminds people of this
condition of human nature, to seek selflessly to benefit others.
Third, religion teaches society proper values and principles to
be applied in a given socio-political-economic system. Wealth,
fame and power are now considered synonymous in many
societies. Those with wealth have the power to control the lives
of the poor. The current capitalistic value system maintains
differences between the poor and the rich. Greed is an
unacceptable quality, but it is one of the features of capitalistic
system. It would be more appropriate if a socio-political-
economic system were based on fair values, enabling survival of
all the people rather than survival of the wealthy. Currently
none of the existing systems satisfy this condition. Shoghi
Effendi states: “Every system, short of the unification of the
human race, has been tried, repeatedly tried, and been found
wanting…crisis has succeeded crisis” [WOB 190]. There is a need
for an economic system that is fair, flexible, and universal, and
based on human values. Religion is the source of human values,
and provides hope for the vast majority of the planet’s
inhabitants. Therefore, according to the Bahá’í International
Community, it is “…inconceivable that a peaceful and
prosperous global society, a society which nourishes a
spectacular diversity of cultures and nations, can be established
and sustained without directly and substantively involving the
world’s great religions in its design and support.”10

A survey of religion on wealth and poverty

Religiosity is a growing phenomenon, especially among the
poorer societies. Claims are made by a number of researchers
that poverty is a cause of religiosity, or the poor people are
more spiritual. Jacob Olupona, an expert in African spirituality
confirms that in Africa the most impoverished people tend to
be deeply spiritual.11 Also, research carried out by two political
scientists, Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart, indicate how
religion is growing, especially amongst poor and oppressed
communities. A feeling of insecurity, lack of food and fight for

survival for example, create the seedbed for religious
dependency. A need for dependence amongst the oppressed and
the poor, therefore, strengthens religious belief. These experts
found close correlation between poverty and religiosity in
eighty societies, covering most of the world’s major Faiths.
Based on their research, it is argued that religious dependency
persists most strongly among vulnerable populations, especially
those in the poorer nations and in failed states, facing personal
survival-threatening risks. The researcher’s claim is that
exposure to physical, societal and personal risks drive
religiosity. Conversely, a systematic erosion of traditional
religious practices, values and beliefs appear to have occurred
among the more prosperous strata in the rich nations. At the
same time, a growing proportion of the population — in both
rich and poor nations — spend time thinking about the meaning
and purpose of life. It is argued that in developed countries, the
established churches are losing their ability to tell people how
to live their lives, but spiritual concerns, broadly defined, may
be becoming increasingly important.12

Poverty has many faces. It can be material, social, cultural,
or spiritual. The causes of poverty can be man-made or through
natural disasters such as: shortage of physical and human
resources; political instability; internal conflict; national debt
crisis; human rights issues including discrimination and social
inequality; poor health-care system; unemployment; weak and
unrecognized currency in the international market; social
exclusion; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and
hurricanes. Also, the poor have little opportunity for adequate
education and gaining skills or having access to necessary
resources for wealth creation.

Furthermore, the presence of certain values in the current
economic and market condition upholds poverty. For instance,
through effective advertisement, the need is created to
consume; also, excessive availability of credit makes it easier to
buy and fall into debt; and social status is constructed in terms
of what one possesses. Therefore, the more one possess, the

14                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

higher their social standing. The consumption driven economy
urges cheap production in order to participate in a competitive
market. The result is the exploitation of labour and resources.
These values stimulate consumption and they create the illusion
that poverty can only be alleviated by increased consumption
and a proper life is a life of consuming more goods. The more
one has, the richer she/he appears: while, in fact, in trying to
possess more one become poorer.

A comparative study of religion, wealth and
poverty

In modern time, due to creativity, innovation, improved
transportation, and increased human and technological
capabilities, the wealth of nations has increased significantly.
The question is whether the balancing forces of growth,
competition and technological progress would lead to reduced
inequality and create greater harmony among the classes? The
challenge, therefore, is not increasing the wealth but how it is
created rightfully and distributed fairly. The aspect of wealth
redistribution and its accumulation in the hands of a few have
been the concern of Holy Scriptures and hence laws are set for
its just distribution. The phrase “poverty” can be interpreted as
either spiritual or material poverty. However, the spirit of the
teachings of all Faiths encourages earning through integrity and
hard works to support own self, one’s own family, helping
others, and contributing for social progress. In practice there is
variation about the two concepts of wealth and poverty among
the different Faiths and within a particular Faith. Here a brief
description of wealth and poverty is provided from perspective
of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and the Bahá’í Faith. It is worth
noting that given centuries of divergent interpretations of
Scriptures and a huge range of practice within each, attempting
to summarize Faith’s perspective on wealth and poverty in few
pages would not be justified, but some salient lines of thought
in each could be identified.

Judaism

Judaism sees no merit in poverty. It is stated, “We are on
earth to experience and enjoy this life within the constraints of
the law.”13 These rules include a very strong responsibility to
support those in need. According to the Jewish view “poverty is
an unmitigated evil.”14 Jews see no virtue in poverty, poverty is
pointless suffering, and hence it is not admired. The Jewish
attitude towards wealth is quite positive. In fact, wealth, peace,
and/or long life are rewards from God for obeying God’s
laws.15 God will bless those that use their wealth to help the
poor.16 Jewish view on wealth is very much related to charity.
Hence, acquiring wealth is praiseworthy, because it allows them
to contribute generously to charity and to help the poor
regardless of their background. It is clear that Judaism sees
nothing wrong with wealth as long as it is obtained honestly and
used to help the poor. In other words, wealthy people should
not live in luxury, and wasting their wealth on unnecessary
things. Asceticism and becoming financially a burden on others,
on the other hand, was opposed by many of the Jewish scholars
and philosophers. According to Jewish scholar Joseph Isaac
Lifshitz, Jewish law calls upon Jews to do everything in their
power to avoid becoming a burden on others. They are to be
responsible for their own welfare and not to rely on the
community to provide for them.17

Christianity

In Christianity, poverty and a humble life help bring
individuals closer to God. Wealth is not inherently evil, but
greed causes people to act in their own self-interest and
distracts believers from helping others. In the New Testament,
it is stated, “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the
kingdom of God” [Luke 6:20]. The term ‘poor’ may be interpreted
as detachment from material things; one should have a humble
life and not be possessed by material wealth. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states:

16                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> When Christ came upon the earth, those who believed in
> Him and followed Him were the poor and lowly, showing
> that the poor were near to God. When a rich man believes
> and follows the Manifestation of God, it is a proof that
> his wealth is not an obstacle and does not prevent him
> from attaining the pathway of salvation. [PUP 216]

Christ says to His Disciples, “Blessed are the poor.” For
those who struggle in difficult times, such as material poverty,
this would bring them comfort and hope. Struggles during
difficult times give people an opportunity to try for
improvement while placing trust in Christ and let Him be the
source of hope, strength and security. In the Hidden Words,
Bahá’u’lláh states:

> O Son of My Handmaid! Be not troubled in poverty nor
> confident in riches, for poverty is followed by riches,
> and riches are followed by poverty. Yet to be poor in all
> save God is a wondrous gift, belittle not the value
> thereof, for in the end it will make thee rich in God, and
> thus thou shalt know the meaning of the utterance, ‘In
> truth ye are the poor’… [HW Persian #51]

Also, Jesus rejects the possibility of dual service. He said:
“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and
love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise
the other. You cannot serve both God and wealth” [Matthew 6:24].
For an understanding of this verse, we look at the Saint Paul’s
interpretation. According to Saint Paul, “The love of money is
a root of all kinds of evil” [Timothy 6:10]. Consequently, wealth is
looked at negatively if a person places it above spirituality.
Therefore, it is not about whether or not one saves up money
or accumulates wealth. It is about one’s motives for doing so.
Looking at this from a different perspective, it would be
possible to consider ‘poverty’ as having a humble and simple
life, and being content and satisfied, which are in agreement
with the spirit of Christian Faith. And since the main message

of Christ is love and fellowship, then association with others
will be more effective if a person has enough material
possession to be able to give a part of it generously to those in
need, rather than asking for help or to beg.

The following statement from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá suggests that
references in the Bible to poverty and wealth may also have a
literal meaning:

> And the seventh question: Bahá’u’lláh hath been made
> manifest to all mankind and He hath invited all to the
> table of God, the banquet of Divine bounty. Today,
> however, most of those who sit at that table are the
> poor, and this is why Christ hath said blessed are the
> poor, for riches do prevent the rich from entering the
> Kingdom; and again, He saith, ‘It is easier for a camel to
> go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to
> enter into the Kingdom of God.’ [Matthew 19:24; Mark
> 10:25] If, however, the wealth of this world, and worldly
> glory and repute, do not block his entry therein, that
> rich man will be favoured at the Holy Threshold and
> accepted by the Lord of the Kingdom. [SWAB 195]

The interpretation of wealth, particularly from Protestant18

point of view is that the pursuit of wealth is not only
acceptable but it is an outcome of faith and a religious duty.
This perspective is generally attributed to Calvinist, associated
to John Calvin19. Calvinism as a school of thought set the stage
for the later development of capitalism in northern Europe. In
this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against
the medieval condemnation of profit earning and wealth
accumulation in general. The view considers hard work and
good and healthy lifestyles as spiritual acts. The supporters are
strong advocates of wealth creation, and to avoid wealth
becoming an obstacle to faith. Among those who view wealth as
an outcome of faith are the supporters of prosperity theology,
viewing that God promises wealth and abundance to those who
will believe in him and follow his laws.

18                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Max Weber20 in 1904-1905 submitted a thesis and argued
that Reformed Calvinist and Protestantism have led to modern
capitalism. The English translation of his work, which was in
German, was published in book form in 1930 as The Protestant
Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Weber argued that
capitalism in northern Europe evolved because the Protestant,
particularly Calvinist ethic influenced large numbers of people
to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own
enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of
wealth for investment. Weber's work focused scholars on the
question of the uniqueness of Western civilization and the
nature of its economic and social development. Scholars have
sought to explain the fact that economic growth has been much
more rapid in Northern and Western Europe and its overseas
offshoots than in other parts of the world including those
Catholic and Orthodox churches that have been dominant over
Protestantism.

Islam

In Islam, the Prophet’s Hadíths indicate that poverty is a
danger and threat for both individuals and societies. It is an
unwanted situation from which every Muslim should protect
himself. He Himself prayed “O My Allah, I refuge to you from
the evils of poverty”21, and He advised the following prayer for
His friends: “Refuge to Allah from the evils of poverty, famine,
degradation, oppressing and oppressed.”22 Indeed a devoted
Muslim is one who has adequate wealth, but never puts it into
his/her heart. Hence, wealth is good as long as it does not
become a source of pride, arrogance and oppression or cause
people to be enslaved to it. Furthermore, Islam considers that
struggling to make a living by producing something through
commerce is a meritorious act. In order to sustain a good life in
this world, working and having enough property is imperative
for everyone in Islam. Moreover, working to obtain property
and maintain a good life is accepted as a valuable effort and
worship. It is stated in the Qur’an that while the night is

created for rest, the day is created for the maintenance of life
[Qur’án 28:73].

The holy Qur’an provides two levels of poverty: (1) those
living at or below the poverty level defined as the poor (al-
fuquara). These are the persons who lack material means,
possessions or income to support them.23 And (2) those living
very much below it, defined as the destitute (al-masakin). The
destitute (miskin) is in misery, dependent on others, either
unable to work or not earning enough to maintain himself and
his family. As compared to the poor (fakir), he is in a worse
economic condition, well below the poverty level. Hence, there
is a distinction between the poor, the destitute, and a person
who uses begging as a profession.

The guidance from the verses of the Qur’an refers to charity
as an important approach to reduce poverty. Charity-based
Islamic models are financially and socially sustainable because
they are based on the concepts of brotherhood, local
philanthropy, and volunteer services. These can broadly target
the economic and social needs of the poor.

Another important measure for poverty eradication in Islam
is Zakah. It is a mandatory duty for the wealthy to perform.
Zakah is an important means for poverty alleviation if work is
not available or its return is not sufficient to meet the
individual's basic needs in life. Every wealthy Muslim must pay
Zakah to complete his worship to God.24 Being wealthy means
having “Nisab” which is a given level of monetary or in-kind
wealth exceeding one’s needs and that of his family. Zakah is a
religious duty calculated as a fixed percentage on each form of
wealth. It is calculated as 2.5% of most physical and financial
assets, 5% of agricultural products from artificially irrigated
land and 10% for naturally irrigated land; for cattle not used
for land work it is levied in-kind after a minimum number for
each kind. Zakah is to be paid at the end of each lunar year;
only Zakah of the agricultural products is to be paid, mostly in-
kind, at the harvesting time.25

20                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

There is, however, the need for clarification when discussing
wealth creation and wealth redistribution from Judaism,
Christianity and Islamic perspective. They do indeed have a
great deal to say about the poor, about work, and about social
justice. But their teachings are revealed for another age and a
relatively primitive economy. It should be noted that economic
ideas are always and closely a product of their own time and
place. The exploration of the Bahá’í teachings on economics has
occupied an important place in the Bahá’í Writings because
Bahá’u’lláh has appeared at a time of global economic
integration and interdependency of nations. The economic
teachings have a vital effect on the Bahá’í community and on
the wider society.

The Bahá’í view on wealth and poverty

In the Bahá’í writings the acquisition of wealth is not
condemned, but ‘true wealth’ has been interpreted differently.
The notion of true wealth consists of faith and building moral
character and wisdom. The Writings consider the dual nature of
human beings. This unique perspective connects material and
spiritual well-being. The view is that human beings are spiritual
in nature and thus, material well-being alone cannot guarantee
human happiness. Bahá’ís are directed that they would be
happier if the spiritual aspects of their lives are fulfilled and
developed alongside the material; it is stated that “…only when
material and spiritual civilization are linked and coordinated
will happiness be assured ” [PUP 110]. Abdu’l-Bahá refers to
concepts of spirituality and wealth as two different things.
Consequently, there is no need for a complete rejection of one
for total acceptance of the other. Confirming this ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says “Material progress and spiritual progress are two very
different things, and that only if material progress goes hand in
hand with spirituality can any real progress come about” [PT 107].

Wealth is regarded positively in the Bahá’í Writings. For
example, Bahá’u’lláh approves the need for wealth after the

stage of maturity. Moreover, wealth is appreciated if it is
acquired legitimately through honest work, and is spent
sensibly. In the following statement, Bahá’u’lláh describes the
attainment of wealth by one’s own efforts and hard work as
desirable after reaching the stage of maturity:

> …man should know his own self and recognize that
> which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or
> abasement, wealth or poverty. Having attained the stage
> of fulfilment and reached his maturity, man standeth in
> need of wealth, and such wealth as he acquireth through
> crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy
> in the estimation of men of wisdom, and especially in
> the eyes of servants who dedicate themselves to the
> education of the world and to the edification of its
> peoples. [TB 34]

The stage of fulfilment and reaching maturity in the light of
this discussion can be described as attaining a high level of
human consciousness where the acquisition of wealth becomes
worthy, if achieved through appropriate means and expended
for an appropriate ends. Similarly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes how
wealth should be acquired and spent. He said, “Wealth is
praiseworthy in the highest degree, if it is acquired by an
individual’s own efforts and the grace of God, in commerce,
agriculture, art and industry, and if it be expended for
philanthropic purposes” [SDC 4]. According to this passage, the
first condition for acquiring wealth is that it must be earned by
one’s own efforts. This emphasises the need to work and be a
productive member of the society. The second condition is that
the income earned be spent on charitable and philanthropic
activities, thereby directing the Bahá’í community towards a
culture of philanthropic, humanitarian and benevolent acts. The
understanding is that one should not be possessed by the love
of wealth but being detached. In the following statement
attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains the meaning and
implication of material detachment:

22                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> Detachment does not consist in setting fire to one's
> house, or becoming bankrupt or throwing one's fortune
> out of the window, or even giving away all of one's
> possessions. Detachment consists in refraining from
> letting our possessions possess us. A prosperous
> merchant who is not absorbed in his business knows
> severance. A banker whose occupation does not prevent
> him from serving humanity is severed. A poor man can
> be attached to a small thing. [ADP 135]

For further analysis of wealth creation and redistribution
there is a need to make a distinction between ‘means’ and
‘ends’, otherwise what is a mere instrument could become the
main goal of an individual in life. Reminding His followers of
the importance of reliance in God while engaging in an
occupation, Bahá’u’lláh said: “It is incumbent upon each one of
you to engage in some occupation … Hold ye fast unto the cord
of means and place your trust in God, the Provider of all
means” [KA para#30]. The affirmation is that the money earned is
a ‘means’, not an ‘end’ and that God is ‘the provider of all
means.’ These ‘means’ are those that are befitting human
dignity. The indication is that our economic models cannot
reduce all values to money or what is known as
‘commoditization’26 in a competitive market.

Expounding on the same subject, the Universal House of
Justice, addressing the Bahá’í community, stresses that the
acquisition of wealth as a ‘means’ for achieving higher ‘ends’
such as meeting one’s basic needs, promoting the welfare of
society, and contributing to the establishment of a world
civilisation is praiseworthy.27 Exploring the concept of wealth
and the justification for acquiring it, the Universal House of
Justice states: “However constructive and noble the goal,
however significant to one’s life or to the welfare of one’s
family [wealth] must not be attained through improper
means.”28 Examples of “improper means” might include using
child labor, paying low wages for reducing cost to increase

profit, unfair trade through aggressive competition, or any
activities that lead to the destruction of the environment.
Furthermore, policies, which internalise ‘negative externalities’,
should be carefully evaluated so as not to foster attitudes of
self-satisfaction and selfishness. Negative externalities are
where the actions of an individual or a firm has an impact on
others for which they do not pay, such as the cost of damaging
roads and polluting the air by driving a car. Internalising
negative externality means that in this example car drivers are
responsible to pay the cost of road maintenance and
pollution.29 In a similar fashion it should be noted how
economic theory with its self-interest utilitarianism has reduced
everything to commodities. To avoid these difficulties, there is
much guidance as to how to carefully weigh the difference
between gaining wealth in fields such as agriculture, commerce,
the arts and industry, and in obtaining it without effort or
through improper means.

Economist and philosopher Amartya Sen has commented on
the two elements of ‘means’ and ‘ends’. He is establishing an
association between the two in relation to commodities and a
level of ‘functioning’ in life. The commodities over which a
person had command were, after all, only a means to an end,
and that end was a level of functioning in life, being able to live
the kind of life that one values. This ‘functioning’ was subject
to objective measurement as well, such as: life expectancy,
infant mortality, literacy, morbidity, political participation and
so on.30 Sen was concerned that the average longevity of a
resident of a poor neighborhood in New York is less than that
of a resident of Dhaka in Bangladesh, despite the fact that not
only incomes, but real incomes, are many times higher in some
parts of New York than in Dhaka.31 Sen’s view helps to better
understand the legitimacy of how wealth is obtained and how it
is spent in relation to ‘means’ and ‘ends’.

Reflecting on the following verse from the Bible “You
cannot serve both God and wealth” [Matthew 6:24] one can view it
in the light of the two concepts of ‘ends’ and ‘means’. That is,

24                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

God is the ‘ends’ and money or wealth is the ‘means’. As the
human being is spiritual in nature, material means can be used
to serve spiritual ends.

On the issue of poverty, the question can indeed be asked
whether the concepts of religion and poverty belong together?
One may argue that poverty is a material condition related to
food, housing, clothing, and other necessities for living; and
religion is a spiritual entity related to transcendental.
Therefore, these two do not belong to each other. However,
studying religious scriptures, we can maintain that religion has
positive effects on poverty reduction. For example, religion
supports the production of those goods and services that are
befitting human dignity, hence avoiding the production of
commodities that are destructive and damaging to human life
and to the environment. Religion encourages moderation, and
inspires believers to work and be productive members of the
society. Religion focuses on the importance of education.
Education, also leading to the emancipation and empowerment
of women, inspiring them to participate at all levels of society
resulting in an increase in the wealth of a nation. The positive
opportunities and accomplishments achieved through spiritual
education will create the necessary conditions for activities
resulting in acquiring wealth and a smoother process of
attaining well-being.

The role of religion when it comes to poverty can never be
reduced to merely sympathy and well-wishing, nor empty words
of comfort by emphasising a better future still to come.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is talking about the real need of the poor which
are food, cloths, housing, good health, and education. People
with different religious affiliations need to play an active role
in attempting to alleviate poverty. Religion, therefore, creates
an awareness of the problem of poverty by redirecting the
attention to a higher spiritual existence, devoid of material
needs, but does not change the existential effects of poverty.

Monetary instruments such as money and wealth are ‘means’
and in some sense determine the way we can relate to others,
particularly to those in need. In this dispensation, the rich are
given the responsibility to take care of the poor. This is
confirmed in numerous Writings of the Founder of this Faith:

> o “Blessed is … the rich one who careth for the poor…” [TB 70]
o “O children of Dust! Tell the rich of the midnight sighing

of the poor…” [HW Persian #49]
o “O ye rich ones on earth! The poor in your midst are My

> trust, guard ye My trust, and be not intent only on your
> own ease.” [HW Persian #54]
o “They who are possessed of riches, however, must have

the utmost regard for the poor…” [GWB 202]
o “O ye rich ones of the earth! Flee not from the face of

the poor that lieth in the dust…” [GWB 314]
o “The beginning of magnanimity is when man expendeth

> his wealth on himself, on his family and on the poor
> among his brethren in his Faith.” [TB 156]
It requires a great deal of material sacrifice and spiritual
enrichment by the rich to guard the poor. However, the wealthy
Bahá’ís taking responsibility for the poor does not exclude the
poor from taking responsibility for their own lives. Bahá’u’lláh
states: “…the poor may exert themselves and strive to earn the
means of livelihood. This is a duty which, in this most great
Revelation, hath been prescribed unto every one, and is
accounted in the sight of God as a goodly deed ” [GWB 202].
Shoghi Effendi states that: “Every individual, no matter how
handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation of
engaging in some work or profession…” [DG 47]. The term
handicapped may raise a question as to how would one expect a
handicapped person to work and whether this refers to someone
with physical or mental disability, while knowing that begging
is forbidden. It may be said that the effectiveness of a disabled

26                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

individual’s work depends on the availability of social and
medical services along with technological advancement to support
such people to be engaged in work that they can perform. In
developed countries, more attention is paid to ensure that
people with physical and mental disabilities receive appropriate
support to engage in some form of profession, which improves
their sense of well-being, as well as allows them to be more
productive members of the society. Good planning by
governments and on the part of institutions, and of course in-
dividual self-initiative are partly responsible for such provisions.

As the Bahá’í community evolves and principles such as work
as worship, compulsory education, participation of women in
social and economic activities are applied, absolute poverty
shall disappear and there will not be any need for individuals to
remain in absolute poverty. However, it is not reasonable to
think that the individuals’ generosity is the only way of dealing
with the challenges of poverty. The role of the government and
good governance through legislation and other methods such as
social welfare programs is crucial in its eradication. Therefore,
when expressing concern about poverty, the Bahá’í Writings
suggest a holistic approach, keeping all needs of humans in
mind by creating a balance in human life.

Conclusion

This paper maintained the view that religion is able to have
positive effects on wealth creation and poverty alleviation. The
view presented that Holy Scriptures emphasise the production
of those goods and services that are befitting human dignity.
Religion has traditionally defined human nature, and our
relationship with each other and with respect to the
environment. Religion is “the cause of development and the
animating impulse of all human advancement” [PUP 361]. All
Faiths encourage the practice of moderation, which may result
in avoidance of shortages and surpluses of commodities in the
market and hence the efficient use of valuable resources.

Religion also encourages sharing and caring and hence
influences improved wealth redistribution. Many of the
important decisions about family, work and savings have been
rooted in religious beliefs. Religion focuses on the importance
of education and training for the development of human
resource that constitutes the ultimate basis for wealth of
nations. The positive opportunities and accomplishments
achieved through education will create the necessary conditions
for well-being. Work done in a spirit of service is considered as
worship, and this spiritual principle inspires believers to be
productive members of the society. Religion reveals to us
principles that are neither invention of the human mind nor
social conventions, rather, insights into reality. Science helps us
apply these principles to the social reality in which we are
immersed. The proposition is that there is economic poverty
but there is also spiritual and moral impoverishment. It is this
latter form of poverty that has a direct impact on economic
poverty because it prohibits a person from living and
functioning to his or her full potential. The perception,
therefore, is that the two disciplines of religion as a spiritual
realm and a source for moral regeneration, and economics as a
social science, although different entities, the effective
partnership of the two fosters human well-being through right
channels of wealth creation, and wealth redistribution. Hence,
there is no need for the complete rejection of one, and the total
acceptance of the other, it is with the partnership of material
advancement and spirituality that any real progress come about.
