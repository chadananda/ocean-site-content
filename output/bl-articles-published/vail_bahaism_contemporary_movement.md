| BAHAISM — A STUDY OF A CONTEMPORARY MOVEMENT   
  
ALBERT R. VAIL   
  
Ubbana, Illinois   
  
More and more there is being brought to our attention   
the news of a great spiritual awakening in Southwestern   
Asia, that home of the prophets and birthplace of relig-   
ions. At first it was called Babism, and centered around   
the brilliant youth, Mirza Ali Mohammed, the Bab, who   
after six years of teaching was martyred at Tabriz,   
Persia, in 1850. Later, most of his followers accepted   
the leadership of Mirza Husain Ali, generally known   
today as Bahá'u'lláh, and following his more universal   
teaching called themselves Bahais. Bahá'u'lláh after   
forty years of heroic teaching in exile and imprisonment   
closed his earthly existence at Acca, Syria, in 1892. The   
present leader of the movement, Abdul Baha (Abbas   
Effendi), under whose guidance the Bahai gospel has   
spread with remarkable rapidity into many countries, has   
recently spent more than a year in Europe and America,   
making its principles known, and through his great kind-   
ness, his words of wisdom, his sweet persuasiveness, has   
reflected its pure spiritual light. Apparently, it is not so   
much an organization as a spiritual attitude, not so much   
a new religion as religion renewed. Its followers are   
found in all sorts of ecclesiastical organizations. To be   
a Bahai a man need not sever his previous religious affili-   
ations; he may remain a Buddhist, or Hindoo Braman,   
a Parsee, a Mohammedan, or a Christian. He becomes   
one of the Bahai Movement when he catches the Bahai   
spirit.

This is part of a world-wide movement, for without   
doubt we stand at the dawn of a great spiritual renais-   
sance. New religions are appearing and sweeping through   
the world with a vigor that makes the religious awaken-   
ing of our age, as William James has said, "analogous   
in many respects to the spread of early Christianity,   
Buddhism, and Mohammedanism." * William James   
referred merely to America. But clearly this is a more   
universal revival, a spiritual spring-time, as the Bahais   
call it, when the formalism and dogmatism of the ecclesi-   
astical winter give way to the flowers, the joy, and the   
gentle breezes of true and spiritual religion. For the   
reason that the flood of spiritual warmth and sunlight   
which appears in such an awakening is so great, estab-   
lished institutions, even though they be revived and en-   
larged, are unable to contain it all. Hence it clothes   
itself in scores and hundreds of new sciences, philanthro-   
pies, and reforms. It is an old truth that the newest   
and most active wine must often be put into brand-new   
bottles.   
  
Here is a fascinating opportunity for the study of the   
psychology of religion, when that mysterious force ap-   
pears, as now, in its innate freshness, vigor, and con-   
quering power. In fact, it is difficult to see how we can   
comprehend religious history in the past without the   
study of contemporary experience. It is easy enough   
to pronounce the heroes of ancient days illustrious when   
the world has with unanimous vote put them among the   
company of immortals, but the task of passing judgment   
on contemporary men, reforms, and visions, though   
harder and more adventurous, is far more interesting.   
  
What is the secret of the growth of this Bahai gospel?   
What makes such a religion, in the face of the most   
terrible persecution, spread like wild-fire until in a little   
more than fifty years it counts its followers by the mill-

ions? What inspires 20,000 men, women, and children   
to become willing martyrs in its path? These are ques-   
tions of universal interest, because they get at the heart   
of vital religion wherever it may appear.   
  
The Bahai Movement clearly supplies some rather   
universal need. Otherwise it could not win men of all   
classes, in all countries. This need is in part intellectual.   
The Bahai teaching presents a clear and beautifully   
ordered interpretation of the universe. But this is of   
course not a universal need. A few intellectually culti-   
vated men crave philosophical consistency. To the mass   
of men it is a secondary concern. They want not so   
much new and clear ideas as new life. They are worried   
and confused; they cry for peace. They are unhappy;   
they long for joy. They are dissatisfied with mere mate-   
rial pleasures; they pray for something that is satisfying.   
They feel the chains of self -centered living; they long   
for release. Their inner self is a prison; they would   
exchange it for a palace. To the multitude of mankind,   
as to our new philosophers, knowledge is primarily an   
instrument for the production of life. This truth is   
written all over the history of the world. Men value   
religious truth just so far as it gives them this life. In   
short, that religion grows and persists which gives to   
men regeneration. We have come to distrust this word   
"regeneration," because in the past it has been defined   
so largely in unethical terms. But seen in its true light   
the longing for redemption is simply the deep urge of   
an evolving universe, which, pressing through the minds   
of men, constrains them to climb from a merely physical   
existence to one that is spiritual. All men at a certain   
level of development feel this divine urge upward. The   
religion which helps them in that climb they greet with   
gladness.   
  
Many movements are popular today because they   
offer, with the spiritual, the more material redemption —   
  
  
  
342 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW   
  
release from sickness and poverty. The Bahai Movement   
offers no physical prizes. On the contrary, it declares   
the supreme height of spiritual attainment is revealed   
when man is enabled to meet sickness, poverty, and   
death with unclouded brow, "radiant acquiescence,"   
perfect joy. The appeal is a purely spiritual one. It   
bids men come and "drink of the pure Wine which has   
no likeness, from the Chalice of everlasting Glory" 2   
— the wine of union with God.   
  
The Bahai teaching also differs from various spiritual   
movements of the day in its exaltation of social redemp-   
tion. The body of humanity is sick; it must be healed.   
"These fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars, shall pass   
away and the 'Most Great Peace' shall come." 3 Ine-   
quality of opportunity must give way to justice, equality   
of the sexes be established, and the fiction of "inferior   
races" melt before the dawning light of universal broth-   
erhood. It takes for granted that the social conscious-   
ness is part of man's native endowment, that every man   
at his best wants not only individual regeneration but   
the redemption of the world. 4   
  
The Bahai Movement then makes its appeal to the   
high human instincts for spiritual, social, universal re-   
demption. It promises only the reward of spiritual joy   
for the individual and social welfare of the nations.   
It spreads with surprising rapidity because to such a   
large degree it is fulfilling these exalted promises. Its   
converts will often tell you of the power of the spirit   
they have won in this new teaching, how it opens the   
doors of inspiration within them while they speak, how

it strengthens them to endure suffering, how it makes   
the rewards of the material world look like tinsel and   
ashes and sets them afire with the love of the wealth which   
is spiritual.   
  
Among the oriental Bahais the spiritual results are   
said to be the most remarkable. Mr. Charles M. Remey   
in his Observations of a Bahai Traveller' 1 ' describes the uni-   
versal spirit of hospitality and brotherly love which   
prevails in the Bahai communities of Persia and South-   
ern Russia. Bahais he had never met would travel a   
day's journey to see him on the train. Mr. Sydney   
Sprague tells us of the beautiful spirit of comradery   
which prevails among the Bahais of India and Burmah. 6   
They are gathered from half a dozen religions which   
formerly shunned each other as some dreadful poison.   
Professor Edward G. Browne describes the remarkable   
and unforgettable spiritual atmosphere at Acca. 7 Mr.   
Myron Phelps, after his visit to Palestine and the neigh-   
boring regions, dwells on the "pure and gentle spirit of   
the Bahais — of them all, so far as I have seen them."   
He declares there is a spiritual exaltation and certainty   
about them which makes it impossible to question the   
reality of the unseen in their presence. He tells how   
their devotion to each other is so perfect that if an officer   
seeking men for martyrdom takes the wrong Bahai,   
that Bahai will often not declare the mistake but gladly   
die in his friend's stead. 8   
  
In fact, nowhere does the spiritual dynamic in the   
movement appear more vividly than in its martyrdoms.   
A man of eighty when assaulted cried out, '"We are   
from God, and to Him we are returning,' and in the   
very moment of his expiration he called out in a loud

voice with great joy and exultation, 'You have done us   
no harm! You are only transmitting us to our Lord!'" 9   
A child of eleven is tortured to death by his fanatical   
school-mates and teacher. They afterwards said:   
"When we were stabbing him he only cried out, 'Oh   
Most Glorious God! oh my Supreme Beloved!' never   
wavering for an instant, but with greatest joy and de-   
light he yielded up his life to his Beloved One." 10 A   
youth named Badi was present when Bahá'u'lláh asked   
for a volunteer to take a letter to the Shah of Persia   
on the chance that it would allay the horror of the mar-   
tyrdoms, though it would mean practically certain death   
for the bearer of the letter. Badi offered himself; and   
the bystanders declared that as he was granted the   
commission his face was transfigured. 11 He walked   
hundreds of miles, delivered his message in person to the   
Shah, was rewarded by being slowly burned to death   
during a period of three days, but every moment pre-   
served radiant joy. We need only imagine ourselves   
in such a position to realize that something has happened   
within the martyr's mind. A death like that requires   
a spiritual reinforcement most of us have not yet learned   
to rely upon.   
  
Abdul Baha gives a beautiful summary of the effects   
of this new teaching on the people of Persia, where it is   
said one person in every three is a Bahai, showing how   
already the movement is achieving its ideal of social   
redemption. In speaking to Miss Laura Clifford Barney,   
the author of Some Answered Questions, 12 who had spent   
a number of years studying the Bahai Movement, he

turns to her with the exclamation, "Praise be to God,   
you have been to Persia, and you have seen how the   
Persians, through the holy breezes of Bahá'u'lláh, have   
become benevolent toward humanity. Formerly, if   
they met any one of another race, they tormented him,   
and were filled with the utmost enmity, hatred, and   
malevolence; they went so far as to throw dirt at him.   
They burned the Gospel and the Old Testament, and if   
their hands were polluted by touching these books, they   
washed them. Today the greater number of them   
recite and chant, as is suitable, the contents of these   
two books in their reunions and assemblies, and they   
expound their teaching. They show hospitality to their   
enemies. These sanguinary wolves have become as gentle   
as gazelles in the plains of the love of God. You have   
seen their customs and habits, and you have heard them   
speak of the manners of former Persians. This trans-   
formation of morals, this improvement of conduct and   
of words, are they possible otherwise than through the   
love of God? No, in the name of God! If, by the help   
of science and knowledge, we wished to introduce these   
morals and customs, truly it would take a thousand years,   
and then they would not be spread throughout the masses.   
Today, thanks to the love of God, they are arrived at   
with the greatest facility."   
  
Here then is a religion which is succeeding in the   
undertaking to which all religion is committed, of edu-   
cating men out of the image of the earthly into that of   
the heavenly. It is demonstrating its power by enter-   
ing what are perhaps the darkest countries of the Orient   
and lifting their people toward the light. What is the   
secret? What is the method by which it accomplishes   
these transformations?   
  
It is all summed up in one word — education. Of   
course in outlining the way to the new social order, to   
the salvation of the nations, the Bahai teachers suggest   
  
  
  
346 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW   
  
certain laws, especially for the regulation of excessive   
fortunes, the prevention of poverty. In a hundred years,   
Abdul Baha believes, poverty will have disappeared from   
the civilized world. International laws will be neces-   
sary for the settling of international disputes. Laws   
should be framed to accomplish everything within the   
power of law to accomplish. But this power is limited.   
We cannot bring in the Kingdom of God by legislation   
alone. Furthermore, it requires education of the social   
conscience of men to pass the law and to enforce it.   
Hence the first and the last word in the regeneration of   
the world must always be — education.   
  
Abdul Baha distinguishes between education which is   
material and that which is spiritual. Both are needful.   
Material education builds up the body of our material   
civilization. Spiritual education, however, is the only   
power which can bring to birth that divine civilization   
which is its light and soul. Upon this heavenly educa-   
tion must the religious teachers concentrate, for therein   
lies the hope of humanity.   
  
Spiritual education is the proclamation of spiritual   
truth. Of contemporary thinkers none glorify Truth   
more than Bahá'u'lláh and Abdul Baha. To them, as   
to all liberals, it is the only power under heaven which   
can set men free. "The Sun of Truth is the word of   
God, upon which depends the training of the people in   
the country of thought. It is the Spirit of Reality and   
the Water of Life." It is "the Fire of God which, glow-   
ing in the hearts of people, burns away all things that are   
not of God." 13   
  
Religion in all lands and all ages sets men's spirits   
free in so far as it keeps pure this eternal Word of Truth.   
The great prophets have given it to men in all its pristine   
purity, dressed of course in garments fitted to their   
age and time. Their followers continually imprison it   
  
13 Hidden Words, pp. 58, 59.   
  
  
  
BAHAISM 347   
  
in the husks of barren and materialistic creed and   
ritual. Dogmatic imitations of celestial Truth always   
destroy its effectiveness in spiritual regeneration. Be-   
hold the history of Buddhism or Mohammedanism or   
Christianity.   
  
The truth therefore must be rediscovered and restated   
with each new age. The eternal in the message of   
the prophets must be dissevered from the merely material   
provisions and ordinances. This is possible only to those   
who are free from prejudice and possessed by a passion   
for Reality. 14 Today it is first necessary to recognize   
the value of reason and scientific method. "Weigh care-   
fully in the balance of Reason and Science everything   
that is presented to you as religion. If it passes this test,   
then accept it, for it is truth. If, however, it does not   
so conform, reject it, for it is ignorance." For "it is   
impossible for religion to be contrary to science even   
though some intellects are too weak or too immature   
to understand truth." 15 "Religion and science are the   
two wings upon which man's intelligence can soar into   
the heights, with which the human soul can progress. It   
is not possible to fly with one wing alone. Should a man   
try to fly with the wing of religion alone he would quickly   
fall into the quagmire of superstition, whilst on the other   
hand with the wing of science, he would make no progress   
but fall into the despairing slough of materialism." 16   
  
Religious truth, however, comes primarily through   
spiritual insight. It is conformable to reason. It also   
transcends the measuring rod of our mere rationalistic   
processes and rests ultimately upon spiritual intuition.   
The Bahai teachers declare further that the validity of   
a man's intuition depends upon the purity of his heart.   
We may hear within us not the voice of the spirit but of   
the satanic ego. It is only in the spotless mirror of a

348 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW   
  
pure heart that the rays of the Sun of Truth are reflected   
with unbroken clearness and splendor. The purest   
and most perfect of men, therefore, attain the highest   
degree of certainty in intuitive knowledge. These by the   
common testimony of mankind are the great prophets.   
To them we turn for the knowledge of Reality. The   
true seeker studies their utterances without prejudice,   
remembering that "light is good in whatever lamp it is   
burning. A rose is beautiful in whatever garden it may   
bloom. A star has the same radiance if it shines from   
the east or the west." 17 The words of the most illumined   
prophets, however, are often imperfectly reported and   
always need interpretation. Therefore traditional script-   
ure alone will not suffice as a criterion for truth. In fact,   
no one of the four accepted standards of truth — the sen-   
sory, the rationalistic, the intuitive, or the traditional —   
is in itself sufficient. When, however, all are combined   
and all agree, we may count their deliverance the truth.   
This is at least the nearest approach that the seeker   
possesses until, after long spiritual discipline, the voice of   
the assurance of the Holy Spirit speaks from the serene   
depths of his own pure and God-illumined heart. 18   
  
What then are the spiritual truths which, passing this   
test, stand forth as enduring certainty? Or, to narrow   
our quest, what are the truths by the teaching of which   
the Bahai Movement is effecting the transformation of   
its followers' lives? They are very few; in fact they can   
all be gathered under one supreme concept — the inherent   
unity of the universe. Written on almost every page of   
the writings of Bahá'u'lláh and Abdul Baha are the   
words, oneness, unity. Their supreme aim is to bring   
men to "the Tent of Unity," the "presence of single-   
ness," the "ocean of oneness." And "oneness, in its   
true significance, means that God alone should be real-

BAHAISM 349   
  
ized as the One Power which animates and dominates all   
things, which are but manifestations of Its energy." 19   
All nature is one and reveals to the seeker the splendor   
of the "Ideal King." All the prophets speak one truth,   
declare one religion, manifest one God. The individual   
man is the potential manifestation of this one God. The   
immanence of God in the "servants" is taught with per-   
sistent intensity. Hence men of all classes and races   
are the "drops of one sea and leaves of one tree."   
Many a mystic has beheld God in his own soul. The   
Bahai teaching invites men to advance to the more   
universal view and behold His light in all humanity.   
Abdul Baha was asked, "Why do the guests that visit   
you come away with shining countenances?" He an-   
swered, "I cannot tell you, but in all those upon whom   
I look I see only my Father's face." By the inculcation   
of these few but sublime truths would this new gospel   
not only regenerate the individual but heal the disease   
of war, annul the blight of racial, creedal, and class antag-   
onisms, and bring in the "Most Great Peace."   
  
There are however many liberal thinkers in different   
parts of the world who are announcing these same truths   
of universal religion and universal brotherhood. The   
Bahais are part of a great world-movement. Their sig-   
nificance lies in the effectiveness of their teaching.   
Some teachers present these ideas, and their hearers say,   
"How true, how beautiful!" The Bahais proclaim the   
same truths, and often those who listen rise as from the   
dead, possessed by a new heart, aflame with the love   
which moves the world. There must be some dynamic   
in their method of presentation.   
  
What is it? Truth regenerates men when they really   
believe it. Belief is something far more vital than mere   
intellectual assent. We may in a vague way surround   
a truth with the light of our intellect; but if that is all,   
  
19 Hidden Words, p. 61.   
  
  
  
350 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW   
  
it has little effect upon us. The power comes when the   
truth surrounds us, grasps our will, kindles our heart,   
possesses our thought day and night, conquers and sub-   
dues our desires, our ambitions, our hopes, and our loves.   
When the truth shines through the horizon of our mind   
with such conquering brilliance that we cry, " Woe be to   
me if I do not do its bidding!" then we really believe.   
Such belief, as Abdul Baha says, invariably regenerates   
a man. "If his reality is dark, he will become enlight-   
ened; if he is heedless, he will become conscious; if he   
is sleeping, he will be awakened; if he is earthly, he will   
become heavenly; if he is satanic, he will become divine.   
This is the meaning of true belief."   
  
A teacher brings his hearers to this pitch of belief   
only when he in like manner believes the truth he is   
proclaiming. Belief is contagious. He who has it not   
can never transmit it. The Bahais succeed as teachers   
because of the intensity of their belief. To them, at   
their best, it is all in all — life for the world, the hope of   
the ages, the will of God. They die rejoicing, if their   
service to that Truth requires it.   
  
The fact of their absolute belief in what they teach is   
made apparent by what they have sacrificed to do its   
bidding. This is especially clear in the lives of their   
three great teachers — the Bab, Bahá'u'lláh, and Abdul   
Baha. These teachers say that material things count   
for nothing, are so much "water and clay." The whole   
material universe is to the spiritual man of no more   
consequence, says Abdul Baha, than an insect's wing.   
They show they believe it by giving up all physical   
comforts. Abdul Baha and Bahá'u'lláh lost all their   
property, lived in prisons most of their lives, endured   
privations and tortures, often in underground dungeons   
the horrors of which, to Western ears, are almost beyond   
belief. Yet every day, as Abdul Baha has declared, was   
a day of joy. They slept of their own choice on the   
  
  
  
BAHAISM 351   
  
floor that the poor might have their beds, ate the scan-   
tiest food that the hungry might share their meals, re-   
fused to flee from their imprisonment when the gate was   
open. Therefore when they declare the life of physical   
comfort, of self-centered ease, is nothing, the life of   
spiritual love is the one glory of existence, their hearers,   
beholding their life, believe them and toss away their   
fortunes, their homes, their lives, with the same perfect   
joy. Their teachers had put their gospel to the severest   
test and had lived it without wavering. Hence, when   
the followers heard their prophet proclaiming the word   
of God, "If My Will thou seekest, regard not thine own,   
that thou mayest die in Me, and I live in thee," 20 they   
knew he had proved it true in his own experience and   
were constrained to offer "what they had for the hope   
of what \[God\] had." 21 Bahá'u'lláh puts this law of   
spiritual education thus: "The effect of the word spoken   
by the teacher depends upon his purity of purpose and   
his severance." 22 "Guidance hath ever been by words,   
but at this time it is by deeds." 23 "The truth of words   
is tested by deeds and dependent upon life. Deeds   
reveal the station of the man." 24 "He whose words   
exceed his acts, know verily that his non-being is better   
than his being and death better than his life." 26 In   
short, they had power as teachers because they lived the   
truth they taught. "The spiritual teacher shows his   
belief in his own teaching by himself being what he   
recommends to others." He is the Truth.   
  
Here is one of the supreme laws in spiritual pedagogy.   
Religious truth is a life. It manifests itself in man as   
pure love, wisdom, joy, sublime vitality, peace, far-   
reaching service. This divine life in man is but an image,   
a reflection of the life of God, which is Reality. The   
divine life, therefore, whether in man or God is the same.

Now we may describe this life in essay or treatise. That   
is a word-picture or photograph of Reality; but it is   
quite different from the Life itself. The motive power in   
spiritual advancement is love. And we are so made that   
we love not abstractions but realities, not cold prin-   
ciples but the life incarnate. For that reason phil-   
osophic religions are always a failure. No mere "system   
of philosophy has ever been able to change the manners   
and customs of a people for the better." That is the   
reason all the greatest religions of the world gather   
around some noble personality — a Moses, a Confucius,   
a Buddha, a Zoroaster, a Jesus — who lives the creed he   
proclaims. The effect of the prophet in exalting the   
lives of the people lies in the degree in which he can say,   
"I am the Way, the Truth, the Life." True Buddhism   
is the life that was in Buddha; Christianity, the spirit   
which was in the Christ. Until he sees the "splendor   
of the life" incarnate in a human friend, not one man in a   
thousand is able to appreciate its glory and take the hard   
steps which lead to the summit of its transfiguration.   
  
Furthermore, this life seems actually to pass from   
teacher to listener. This experience has been recorded   
in all ages. It is the secret of every inspiring teacher.   
His inward glory breaks away and through his words,   
his face, his deeds, and enters the minds of those who   
hear or see him. In this experience it seems as though   
reality were transmissible, as if the divine light could   
pass from mind to mind awakening the slumbering divin-   
ity in the hearts of men by the warmth and brilliance   
of its shining. "The unusual intellects, for instance, of   
Plato, Aristotle, Pliny, and Socrates, have not influenced   
men so greatly that they have been anxious to sacrifice   
their lives for their teachings; whilst some simple men   
\[have\] so moved humanity that thousands of men have   
become willing martyrs to uphold their words." 26 A

carpenter, Jesus, was able to light the Roman world   
with a veritable spiritual conflagration. When the fire   
of the love of God and men blazed forth in his heart it   
needs must kindle the hearts of millions, for it is the   
nature of such fire that it spreads, and burns from the   
minds it touches all that is not of God. Only "such   
Fire of Love will assemble all the different peoples into   
one court." 27 Only by the transmission of this holy   
fire from man to man will the Kingdom of God appear on   
earth.   
  
Its penetrative and re-creative power lies in this: it   
is the light of God by which all things have come into   
being. It is creator of the world. It is an easy matter,   
therefore, for it to re-create man. This divine life in the   
good man is God. "He who desires to associate with   
God, let him associate with His beloved; and he who   
desires to hear the word of God, let him hear the words   
of His chosen ones." 28 God is incarnate in these "chosen   
ones" in the degree of their spiritual perfection. The   
sun shines on the stone and the polished mirror. But   
only the polished mirror reflects its real splendor. The   
Sun of Reality, which is God, shines on the hearts of all   
men, but only those which are pure, burnished by the   
spirit, reflect its Divine Glory. For instance: "Christ   
was the mirror; God was the Sun. The Sun appeared   
with all its effulgence and splendor in the mirror; that is,   
the virtues, the perfections, and the characteristics of   
God appeared in Christ. That is what is meant where   
it is written in the Bible that 'We have created man in   
our own image.' The perfect man is the visage and   
image of God, just as the mirror reflects the sun. We   
cannot say the sun has come down from heaven and   
taken a place in the mirror. The sun is eternal, living in

its own station. It has no ascent or descent; but the   
rays and the heat of the sun have become fully reflected   
in the clear mirror." 29 The sun is in the mirror; God   
is in Christ. Therefore he that hath seen Christ hath   
seen the Father.   
  
The Bahais also emphasize an often forgotten truth.   
This Light, the Spirit, may be put into a book, clothed   
with the transparent garment of words. Some books   
contain ideas; others, ideas wrapped and drenched in the   
living spirit of Reality. These latter books awaken life,   
transmit the fire of love, usher one into God's very pres-   
ence, as did their author when he met men in the flesh.   
Jesus was incarnate not only in the body of the car-   
penter. He was incarnate also in the words of the Gos-   
pels. Reading their pages with pure and receptive heart,   
we may behold him rising from them in glory. The   
Bibles of the world have this power: they preserve as a   
living presence the spirit of their author for future gen-   
erations. They grasp men's hearts, stir their hopes,   
strengthen their wills, as did the prophet himself. They   
move the world. A few pages of the Gospels turned the   
course of history.   
  
The Bahais, who make a practice of reading as far as   
possible the sacred books of all religions, declare the words   
of the Bab, of Bahá'u'lláh, and Abdul Baha, possess this   
same re-creative power. They illumine, exalt them, re-   
veal to them the presence of God, and set them aflame   
with His love. They shake their soul awake with the   
divine thirst for the "immortal, everlasting chalice" of   
union with God. And that is the first aim of spiritual   
education in every land, every age. Inertia is the wall   
which blocks the pathway of men's spiritual advance-   
ment. They are asleep, they must be awakened; spir-   
itually dead, they must be called forth from the tombs.   
The teacher who can through deeds, through spoken or

BAHAISM 355   
  
written words, awaken that love of the divine life will   
save men. The first step in the Bahai method of spir-   
itual education is that of reading inspired words or meet-   
ing exalted teachers, until one is able for a moment "to   
taste of the honey of union with \[God\]. If we drink   
of this cup we shall forget the whole world." 30   
  
After this arousing from without, man must take the   
process into his own hands. His active co-operation is   
imperative. God puts great responsibilities upon our   
will. When once "the world-illuminating sun of long-   
ing dawns forth, and the fire of love becomes ablaze,"   
we must quickly sever ourselves from all lower ambi-   
tions, from "aught else save God," turn our "face from   
the faces of all created beings unto the Holy Face of   
\[His\] Oneness," 31 and pray. Few religious teachers give   
to prayer a more central place than the Bahais. The   
good Bahais rise, if possible, at dawn with a prayer of   
awakening, turn to God in adoration as they dress, spend   
a half hour or so in earnest supplication and praise before   
breakfast, pray as they leave the house for the daily   
business, pray in the stillness of the evening, and drop   
away to sleep committing their bodies and spirits into   
the hands of God's care and protection. Prayer, they   
declare, is one of the chiefest pillars of all religion. With-   
out it the highest human life is impossible. To them   
prayer is "giving up the outward eye and opening the   
inward eye." It is the concentrating of the whole mind   
upon that "central radiance" of the universe which is   
God. Above all, it is cleansing our motives by absorp-   
tion in the thought of God. "A pure heart is like unto   
a mirror. Purify it by the polish of Love and Severance   
from all else save God, until the Ideal Sun may reflect   
therein and the Eternal Morn may dawn." 32 As such

prayer grows perfect, he who is traversing the valleys   
towards the "sea of nearness and union" attains a won-   
derful knowledge of God. "In an ocean he will see a   
drop, and in a drop he will detect the mysteries of an   
ocean." "The core of whatever mote thou mayest split,   
therein thou wilt find a sun." "He beholds the beauty   
of the Friend in everything. In fire he sees the face of   
the Beloved; in unreality he perceives the sign of the   
Reality." 33 He discerns the "goodness at the heart of   
things evil." " He finds life in death and glory in shame."   
His character is therefore transfigured. "If he experi-   
ences any oppression, he will endure it with patience, and   
if he sees any wrath, he will show forth affection." 34   
He passes on and on in the divine journey until the self-   
centered self vanishes as a shadow. He has "abandoned   
the drop of life and reached the Ocean of the Beloved   
One." Nay more, he has "plunged into the seas of   
Grandeur." He is of those who "swim in the sea of   
Spirit and roam in the sacred atmosphere of Light." 35   
"The Beauty of the Face unveils itself from the Orient   
of the Eternal World and the meaning of 'Everything   
is mortal save the Face of God' becomes manifest."   
  
Such is the height to which Bahá'u'lláh would lead his   
spiritual students through contact with inspired prophets   
and the intensive practice of prayer. But there is noth-   
ing approaching other-worldliness about this exalted state.   
He who sees God in everything will behold Him first of   
all in the neighbor who needs his service, in the great   
causes which make for the upbuilding of spiritual civiliza-   
tion. Abdul Baha declares that today the supreme con-   
firmations of the Holy Spirit come to those who rise to   
serve the "Most Great Cause" of universal religion and   
universal brotherhood. 36 Immersion in the "sea of   
union" is the final preparation for the service of such a

divine cause. It brings that baptism of fire which makes   
him in whom it is burning a light to illumine all those   
who hear his word or see his face. "The minds of the   
lovers are ever aflame with this fire." 37 It transforms   
character, destroys ignorance, quickens civilization. It   
made a few illiterate fishermen of Galilee the leaders of   
the Western world. It is at once the mightiest and the   
most contagious force known to man. The Bahai Move-   
ment is but a new statement and a new demonstration   
of the power of the Holy Spirit in the education of   
humanity.
