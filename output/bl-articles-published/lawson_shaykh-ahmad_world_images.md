Shaykh Aḥmad al-Aḥsāʾī
and the World of Images
Todd Lawson

When considering the role of Shiʿism in the modern and contemporary world,
one topic of importance is infrequently broached, namely the enduring reality of
a spiritual realm referred to as the World of Images (ʿālam al-mithāl). This placeless
place emerges as one of the chief distinguishing features of the work of the so-
called Isfahan School.1 Taking Avicenna (d. 1037) as inspiration, Suhrawardī
(d. 1191), Shaykh al-Ishrāq, established the ontic reality of a world of “appari-
tional forms” for subsequent Eastern philosophical discourse. In the Safavid
thinkers, this world would come to occupy a permanent and essential place, help-
ing to make philosophical (i.e. “scientific”) sense out of such Twelver Shiʿi reli-
gious beliefs as the continued existence and return of the Hidden Imam. The
West has long since rejected the reality of a World of Images for reasons appar-
ently unrelated to sectarian religious beliefs. According to Corbin, the crucial
event was the rejection of the Avicennan cosmological realm of celestial Soul.
The result was the stranding of the human soul without readable guidance for its
journey home. Since this rejection, few Western thinkers have managed to redis-
cover the all but forgotten realm of the imaginal. Among these, Paracelsus
(d. 1541) and Swedenborg (d. 1772) have been singled out as having somehow
survived spiritually and philosophically. To these may be added the artist and vi-
sionary William Blake (d. 1827) for whom the imaginal realm was most real and
crucial and Carl Jung (d. 1961), for whom the imaginal powers of the human be-
ing were necessary for its psychological salvation. More recently, the influence of
both Corbin and Jung on psychology has been unmistakable in the writings of

von Franz and Hillman, among others.2 Finally, a recent book on mysticism has
reasserted the value and reality of the imaginal realm, again influenced by Cor-
bin.3 It remains, however, that even though we may find here and there thinkers
and artists for whom an imaginal realm is real and crucial, in the main such West-
ern thinkers have been marginalised by the greater Western religious and philoso-
phical tradition.

In the East, the reality of this realm has remained a theological, philosophical
and mystical commonplace. From Suhrawardī and his followers to Ibn ʿArabī
(d. 1240) and his wide and deep influence, to the later Shiʿi and Sufi writers and
thinkers, some form of the imaginal realm remained an essential feature of life as
such: even when its ontic status would be questioned by the likes of Sirhindī
(d. 1625), its usefulness for spiritual pedagogy would appear to remain unques-
tioned by him.4 Here is not the place to speculate on all the possible reasons for
this basic difference between East and West. The task at hand is much more fo-
cused, and perhaps by comparison, elementary.

Corbin’s Spiritual Body, the groundbreaking study of the ʿālam al-mithāl, can
leave a reader with the false impression that because all the numerous Eastern
sages treated therein agree on the reality of the ʿālam al-mithāl, that they also
therefore agree on all other aspects of religion or philosophy or, that whatever dif-
ferences there might be are trivial. This is most certainly not the case, as the fol-
lowing comparison will demonstrate. By briefly discussing the serious doctrinal
and philosophical differences between two Eastern scholars on the topic of the
ʿālam al-mithāl, the axiomatic status of the doctrine will be underscored.

Here, then, we are concerned with the main characteristics and function of this
world as found in the writings of Mullā Muḥammad Muḥsin Fayḍ Kāshānī
(d. 1680) and Shaykh Aḥmad al-Aḥsāʾī (d. 1826). The first is considered the faith-
ful bearer of the thought of his teacher and father-in-law, Mullā Ṣadrā (d. 1640)
and one of the more important authorities of post-Safavid religious teachings.
The second is frequently seen as reviving an archaic pre-classical religiosity, and as
a severe critic of Ṣadrian philosophical presuppositions. In this context, it is im-

portant to emphasise, philosophical presuppositions take on some of the charac-
ter of religious beliefs (ʿaqāʾid). That both scholars rely on the ʿālam al-mithāl for
the solution to problems of cosmogony, cosmology, ontology, epistemology and
eschatology indicates the degree to which recourse to this realm is a common-
place, particularly in later medieval Shiʿi thought. That is to say, for both men the
world of images functions as a bridge between reason and revelation. Yet, the dif-
ferences between their respective teachings surrounding this topic are fundamen-
tal, ultimately indicating two mutually exclusive religious types.

Kāshānī is widely esteemed as one of the pillars of post-Safavid Shiʿi religious
culture. He produced a number of important books on Twelver doctrine and
practice. In addition, Fayḍ Kāshānī was the most prolific student of the great
Mullā Ṣadrā, producing two important and influential works on ḥikmat (philoso-
phy), the Kalimāt-i maknūna and the Uṣūl al-maʿārif.5 He was also the student of
Sayyid Mājid al-Baḥrānī (d. 1657), the avid Akhbārī scholar.6 Kāshānī’s formation
combined salient features of the Akhbārī approach7 to fiqh with the Ṣadrian ap-
proach to metaphysics and ontology. This also involved a further advance in the
Shiʿi domestication of the thought of Ibn ʿArabī, a process that may be seen to
have begun as early as Maytham al-Baḥrānī (d. ca. 1280).8 These elements, there
can be no doubt, also combined with ṭarīqa-type Sufi influences, although appar-
ently he did not commit himself to any particular order.9 Whatever the reality of

Kāshānī’s true Sufi allegiances, he has become known in later scholarship as the
“Ghazālī” of post-Safavid Twelver Shiʿism.10 Kāshānī’s teaching on the imaginal
realm may be schematised as follows:11
1) That the realm exists.
2) That it begins at the convex surface of the ninth sphere.
3) It is known by several names: barzakh, hūrqalyā, the 8th clime beyond Mt. Kāf.
4) Figures reflected in clear water and mirrors or any reflecting medium are of

the ʿālam al-mithāl.
5) “It is through this world that the truth is confirmed of the accounts of the

> Prophet’s assumption to Heaven which mention that, in the manner of an
> eyewitness, he has a vision of the angels and prophets.”12
6) It is in this intermediate world that the Holy Imāms are present when they

appear before a dying person, as related in so many traditional accounts.
7) This is the world in which the interrogation of the tomb takes place, with its

delights and its torments.
8) This is the world in which departed spirits will recognise and associate with

> each other, as has been mentioned in the Traditions. It is where, for example,
> the believer may visit those closest to him after death.
9) The Shiʿi doctrine of Return and Resurrection depends upon the reality of

> this world. Here also would be included the “descent of Jesus”, which will oc-
> cur during the Return.13

The master of the Shaykhiyya, or the Kashfiyya as its adherents preferred to be
designated, was Shaykh Aḥmad b. Zayn al-Dīn al-Aḥsāʾī. He was born in 1753 in
a small village in Bahrain, apparently of pure Arab lineage. His family had been
followers of the Shiʿi version of orthodoxy for five generations. From his early
childhood, it was clear that Shaykh Aḥmad was strongly predisposed to the study
of religious texts and traditions. By the age of five, he could read the Qurʾān.

> Ḥusayn Zarrīnkūb, Dunbalā-yi Justujū-yi dar taṣawwuf-i Īrān (Tehran: Amīr Kabīr 1362
> sh./1983-84, p. 257). For Shaykh Aḥmad al-Aḥsāʾī there is absolutely no doubt that Kā-
> shānī’s religious vision shares much in common with Ghazālī’s, but for Aḥsāʾī, this is no
> commendation or point of honor. See Aḥmad al-Aḥsāʾī, Sharḥ Risāla fī ʿIlm Allāh, recently

13   It should be noted that the Kāshānī’s language here is quite striking, he speaks of Jesus’ re-

> turn “after his death” (Kāshānī, Kalimāt-i maknūna, 72). Does this indicate a creative read-
> ing of the famous “non-crucifixion” verse (Qurʾān IV : 156) more in line with standard

through the agency of the spiritual imagination.

SHAYKH AḤMAD AL-AḤSĀʾĪ AND THE WORLD OF IMAGES                                 23

During the remainder of his primary education, he studied Arabic grammar and
became exposed to the mystical and theosophical expressions of Ibn ʿArabī and
the less well known Ibn Abī Jumhūr (d. after 1501), author of the Kitāb al-mujlī.14
His teachers in his homeland included the Dhahabī Sufi, Quṭb al-Dīn Muḥam-
mad Shīrāzī, through whom he possibly gained his first (negative?) exposure to
the work of Ibn ʿArabī.15 In 1772-3, Shaykh Aḥmad left his home to pursue ad-
vanced religious studies in the ʿatabāt shrine cities of Kāẓimayn, Najaf, and Kar-
balā.16 In 1209/1794-5, he received his first ijāza from the renowned scholar Say-
yid Muḥammad Mahdī Ibn Murtaḍā l-Ṭabāṭabāʾī Baḥr al-ʿUlūm (d. 1212/1797),
and eventually six others from various recognised teachers.17

In 1793, at the age of forty-six, Shaykh Aḥmad took up residence in Basra,
seeking refuge from the Wahhābi attack on his native al-Aḥsāʾ. From this time
on, Shaykh Aḥmad remained in either the region of ʿatabāt or in Iran. He trav-
elled widely and gained the respect of the Iranian religious and political elite.
From 1807 to 1813, he lived mainly in Yazd. It was during this period that he
was invited to visit the ruling Qajar monarch, Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh (r. 1797-1834). In
1813 he moved from Yazd to Kirmānshāh where he lived until 1816. At this
time he went to Mecca on pilgrimage after which he returned to the ʿatabāt. He
eventually moved back to Kirmānshāh where he remained, except for a few visits
to other Iranian centers, from 1818 until he departed for another pilgrimage to

Mecca. It was during this journey that Shaykh Aḥmad died, not far from Mecca,
in 1241/1826. He was buried in the Baqīʿ cemetery in Medina.18

For Aḥsāʾī, who would appear to subscribe to most if not all of the points
listed above as constituting Kāshānī’s teaching, the imaginal realm is further dis-
tinguished by its place in an overall cosmic design. Here one of Aḥsāʾī’s more dis-
tinctive doctrines comes into play. In order to appreciate this doctrine and the
implications it has for the present discussion, we must digress briefly. The doc-
trine is not found explicitly articulated in the passages selected for Corbin’s Spiri-
tual Body, but among the many places where it is expressed, one is particularly
suited to the present discussion. This would be Aḥsāʾī’s prolonged critique and
unequivocal condemnation of Kāshānī’s position on the topic of God’s knowl-
edge, or more accurately God’s knowing.19

Aḥsāʾī’s unrelenting rejection of Kāshānī’s attachment to waḥdat al-wujūd is
perhaps the most prominent feature of his critique. Waḥdat al-wujūd, existential
monism, is understood by him to violate the utterly transcendent essence (dhāt)
of God. This perhaps reflects faithfully a strong wariness – particularly amongst
the Shiʿa of the ʿatabāt – about common interpretations of waḥdat al-wujūd that
were seen as tainting the otherwise laudable – if not indispensable œuvre of Fayḍ
al-Kāshānī.20 Aḥsāʾī quotes as follows against those who profess waḥdat al-wujūd:
“It is rather as our Imām, the Commander of the Faithful, a.s., has said: ‘The cre-
ated thing ends only in its likeness and the resort of the quest is only in its like-
ness. The road [to the Essence] is forever blocked, and the search for it is eternally
barred.’”21

According to Aḥsāʾī, both Kāshānī and his teacher Mullā Ṣadrā had strayed
from the true teachings of religion in that they had allowed the transcendence of
the divine essence to be violated. For Aḥsāʾī, the cosmos or creation is, by very
definition, everything other than God.

Here we must direct attention to a speculation touching upon the nature of
Aḥsāʾī’s spiritual and intellectual genealogy made by Hermann Landolt over

18   Rafati, “Development”, 44-45. According to Amanat, Resurrection, 67, Aḥsāʾī’s departure

> from Iran and ʿatabāt was precipitated by the enmity of a growing number of ranking Shiʿi
> ulama.
19   See above note 10 for the bibliographic details for this work, Risāla fī ʿilm Allāh. Corbin

> does not refer to this work in his Spiritual Body. He characterizes Aḥsāʾī’s originality as be-
> ing equally at odds with the philosophers and the theologians (Corbin, Spiritual, 324,
> n. 57). What we are emphasizing here is that, on the basis of such texts as Risāla fī ʿilm Al-
> lāh (and passages of Aḥsāʾī’s Sharḥ ḥikmat ʿarshiyya not highlighted by Corbin in his Spiri-
> tual Body) we see that for Aḥsāʾī, at least, the gulf separating him and Kāshānī (and his
> master) was unbridgeable.

Greek idea contained in the word aporia (i.e. “path strewn with obstacles”).

thirty years ago. Landolt observed an intriguing similarity between the influential
Iranian Sufi, ʿAlā l-Dawla Simnānī (d.1336) and Aḥmad al-Aḥsāʾī: both heavily
criticised waḥdat al-wujūd and sought to replace it with a dynamic view of the di-
vine Act (fiʿl), even as both were accused of having misunderstood waḥdat al-
wujūd in the first place. In some ways, it is even more suggestive that both shared,
as Landolt points out, similar views about a “subtle body”.22 It may be that Aḥsāʾī
was directly influenced by Simnānī on these characteristic subjects.23 It may be
that both authors, one from the 14th, the other from the 19th centuries were ulti-
mately indebted to the Ismāʿīlī tradition for their ontological views, since they
appear to have so much in common with them. It has recently been observed that
“the figures who come closest to prefiguring Simnānī’s cosmological scheme are
the Ismāʿīlī philosophers […] as-Sijistānī (d. between 996 and 1003) and Ḥāmid
al-Dīn al-Kirmānī (d. after 1020).”24 Simnānī’s distinctive attachment to the Fam-
ily of the Prophet25 may represent nothing more than tashayyuʿ ḥasan (good
Shiʿism). Could it be that the same theological elan that characterised so much of
Simnānī’s influential legacy and great popularity contributed to Aḥsāʾī’s fall from
grace as the “philosopher of the age”?

However this may be, when Aḥsāʾī says that the ʿālam al-mithāl occurs between
the divine Acting (fiʿl) and the Acted Upon (mafʿūl),26 his language is indicative of
the wide gulf he saw separating him and Kāshānī. That the imaginal realm repre-
sents a “transitional stage” between fiʿl and mafʿūl is quite characteristic of Aḥsāʾī’s
thought. He raises this and related points repeatedly during his many condemna-
tions of waḥdat al-wujūd and those, like Kāshānī, who propagate it. The point to
be made by drawing attention to this incompatibility is to underscore the fact
that in the East, unlike the West, the imaginal realm was such an unquestioned
feature of religion and philosophy that even two such otherwise incompatible re-
ligious types had no choice but to uphold it.

It is also interesting to observe that both Kāshānī and Aḥsāʾī see the imaginal
realm as the world where meetings with the Hidden Imām and the rest of the
Fourteen Pure Ones occur. Kāshānī says: “It is in this intermediate world that the
Holy Imams are present when they appear before a dying person, as related in so
many traditional accounts.”27 But note that he does not speak about a person vis-
iting the Imams apart from the circumstances of morbidity. In contrast, Shaykh
Aḥmad speaks frequently about an ecstatic (ḥāl) encounter with the Imams in the
imaginal realm. It was in this world that Shaykh Aḥmad received his ability to
“understand” directly from the Imams themselves.28 The reality of the imaginal
realm for him is reflected in the strength of his own considerable certitude,
whether applied to his reading of the Qurʾān or akhbār (statements in ḥadīth form
that are traced to one of the 14 chahārdah maʿṣūmāt, or Sinless Ones – Muham-
mad, his daughter Fāṭima and the 12 Imams) or his critique of what he consid-
ered to be erroneous philosophical speculations. The source of this certitude is
experiential – not logical29 – namely, the ʿālam al-mithāl and his encounters with
it. Such a function appears to be absent in Kāshānī’s schema. That is to say, on
the basis of the brief text we have on the topic, as well as scattered references in
his other writings, Kāshānī does not speak of the ʿālam al-mithāl in the context of
a type of ecstasy or spiritual encounter with the Imām resulting from individual
spiritual discipline, sulūk.30

For Aḥsāʾī, the imaginal realm was also an essential stage in the development
of the individual believer’s “resurrection body”. He speaks about this process in
dizzying detail, whereas Kāshānī speaks only in very brief and general terms about
the same problem in Kalimāt-i maknūna. It may be, of course, that Kāshānī’s
teachings about the imaginal realm represent in this instance a foundation for the

later, very complex theories of Aḥsāʾī.31 In such a case, Aḥsāʾī’s theories may rep-
resent an example of “scientific progress”, building upon, and working out the de-
tails of the insights, however general, of earlier scholars and making reasonable,
by recourse to alchemy and appropriate support from the Qurʾān and akhbār,
such categorical statements as the one by Kāshānī that the imaginal realm is
where spirits are embodied and bodies are spiritualised.32 It falls to Aḥsāʾī to offer
the highly complex and somewhat baroque array of details explaining the opera-
tion left mysterious by Kāshānī, even though they both agree that this is where
Resurrection truly occurs.

The main point here is that the Resurrection body is “made” by the believer as
a result of his moral and ethical decisions and actions, his response to the pri-
mordial covenant and obedience to the sharīʿat. The example given by Aḥsāʾī,
based on a specific theme found in the Qurʾān and akhbār, is of the individual
who was created “according to what he was” at the time of the covenant (Qurʾān,
VII : 172). In many cases, such individuals may have outwardly responded cor-
rectly to the divine question: “Am I not your Lord?”, but inwardly their response
was insufficient. The result, according to Aḥsāʾī, is that:

> [A]t the very moment when his secret thought was contradicting his answer, his “clay”,
> that is, the consubstantial matter of his being, was molded by his thought in the likeness
> of an animal […] So when he descended to this world, […]and when he had consum-
> mated his choice by repetition and by applying his effort to what he had already under-
> taken in the world of seminal reasons [ʿālam al-dharr] what had existed in his secret
> thoughts was revealed in the light of day and he manifested the works of his animal na-
> ture. That is also why he is resurrected in the animal state.33

Aḥsāʾī’s certitude that he understood the nature of God’s knowledge and know-
ing as perfectly as possible in this sub-lunar realm was utterly unshakeable, even
though (or perhaps because) such certitude is based ultimately on the aporia of

31   Certainly it is the case that many of these details are articulated in dialogue with Kāshānī’s

God’s absolute unknowable Essence.34 An example of the certitude I am speaking
of is exemplified in Shaykh Aḥmad’s response to those who charged him with re-
lying upon strange and unsound akhbār to support his ideas. He serenely re-
sponded that he could distinguish a sound ḥadīth from a weak one through its
“fragrance”.35 Such a response ultimately implies a rejection of taqlīd which is then
not merely “imitation” but “blind imitation”, in matters religious.36

For Aḥsāʾī, the imaginal realm would seem to be more a part of a process while
for Kāshānī it is more of a place. This difference is in harmony with their respec-
tive and profoundly conflicting views on ontology. If we take the similar differ-
ences noted by Landolt in Simnānī’s critique of Ibn ʿArabī as a model, for Kā-
shānī, absolute existence is “static” being, while for Aḥsāʾī, absolute existence is
“dynamic” — God’s Act, or more accurately, God’s Acting. Such Acting issues
somehow from the divine essence which remains separate, inaccessible and utterly
ineffable. One of the ways in which Aḥsāʾī preserved this essence was through a
complicated theory of temporal modes. In descending order, these are called azal,
sarmad, dahr and zamān. The first is identified with the divine essence, and there
is no more to be said. From this, however, issues the other three temporal stages.
While there is no space here to explore this in any detail, it is interesting to note
that while Aḥsāʾī locates the imaginal realm between the cosmogonic stages of fiʿl
and mafʿūl, he also says that it is located between dahr and zamān.37 Such specula-
tions also seem to be absent from Kāshānī’s work. And such details also empha-

sise the idea of process “through” time over place “in” space. Ultimately, Aḥsāʾī’s
critique of waḥdat al-wujūd and its later theoreticians such as Fayḍ Kāshānī is
more purely experiential and theological than it is philosophical.

In closing this brief comparison of two modern Shiʿi theoreticians of the world
of images, I would like to revisit the question of the absence of the imaginal
realm from serious philosophical discourse and speculation in the West. Corbin
traced this absence to the rejection of Avicennan angelology by Averroes, leaving
only two, instead of three, worlds: the sensible and the intellectual. Rahman sug-
gested, on the other hand, that one of the factors determining the extended life of
the imaginal realm in the East was that thinkers and Sufis “in a milieu of political
uncertainty, socioeconomic imbalance, and general external deterioration –
sought refuge in a realm that was more satisfying and certainly more liquid and
amenable to imaginative powers.”38

For those who did maintain its ontic (i.e. scientific, philosophic) reality, how-
ever, it remained possible also to maintain the validity of such otherwise “irra-
tional” religious doctrines as bodily resurrection, the ascension of the prophet
and so on. Post-Enlightenment European religious discourse, as we know, wasted
no time in demonstrating the falseness, not to mention the “spiritually” perni-
cious nature, of such beliefs. On the other hand, the Imagination itself remained
of interest to certain rare thinkers in psychology (Jung), philosophy (Langer) and
art (Blake, et al.). It is as if in the West the imaginative realm also somehow be-
came more real than what the medieval scholars call the sensible realm. But it also
became fully “secularised”. Apart from such Westerners as Swedenborg and Blake,
the major religious discussions ignored the imaginal realm, transferring whatever
interest there might have been to areas of hermeneutics and philology, among
other of the auxiliary theological sciences. The imaginal realm continues to have
virtually no place in “serious” philosophical discussions. Quite to the contrary,
recent condemnations by philosophers of “the image” have acquired the features
of a near-phobic polemic:

> Thus perhaps at stake has always been the murderous capacity of images, murderers of
> the real, murderers of their own model, as the Byzantine icons could murder the divine
> identity. To this murderous capacity is opposed the dialectical capacity of representa-
> tions as a visible and intelligible mediation of the Real. All of Western faith and good
> faith was engaged in this wager on representation: That a sign could refer to the depth
> of meaning, that a sign could exchange for meaning, and that something could guaran-
> tee this exchange — God, of course. But what if God himself can be simulated, that is to
> say, reduced to the signs which attest his existence? Then the whole system becomes
> weightless, it is no longer anything but a gigantic simulacrum — not unreal, but a simu-
> lacrum, never again exchanging for what is real, but exchanging in itself, in an uninter-
> rupted circuit without reference or circumference. […]

38   Rahman, “Dream”, 419. He also suggests here that the suppression of the arts in the East

may be partly responsible.

> This would be the successive phases of the image:
> it is the reflection of a basic reality.
> it masks and perverts a basic reality.
> it masks the absence of a basic reality.

it bears no relation to any reality whatever: it is its own pure simulacrum.39

One imagines that Corbin himself might have predicted such extreme invective
against the image. On the other hand, we occasionally find a validation of the
imaginal in contemporary intellectual discourse. Thus Castoriadis:

> [P]hilosophers almost always start by saying: “I want to see what being is, what reality is.
> Now, here is a table; what does this table show to me as characteristic of a real being?”
> No philosopher ever started by saying: “I want to see what being is, what reality is. Now,
> here is my memory of my dream of last night; what does this show me as characteristic
> of a real being?” No philosopher ever starts by saying “Let the Requiem of Mozart be a
> paradigm of being”, and seeing in the physical world a deficient mode of being, instead
> of looking at things the other way around, instead of seeing in the imaginary, i.e., hu-
> man mode of existence, a deficient or secondary mode of being.40

Needless to say, the philosophers mentioned here are not our Eastern sages. Yet
this passage seems quite remarkable as an example of the transposition, cum secu-
larisation, of the ideas we have been speaking about.

The world today is in serious travail, this no one denies. Those who value the
realm of the imaginal tend to agree that one of the reasons for our current pre-
dicament is precisely the denial of that world. Here it is impossible to forbear
mentioning that of the numerous methods of entering or encountering the
imaginal realm discussed by our authors (i.e., the dream, visions, spiritual ecstasy)
there is one that seems to stand out as particularly emblematic for us, whether in
the East or the West. Most of our Eastern theoreticians of the imaginal realm
agree that one of the most ready means of encounter is none other than pure
clear water, on whose luminous surface images from that realm may appear to us
as guides and teachers. Thus we are asked to bear in mind that while the earth’s
most valuable natural resource is absolutely necessary for biological life, it is
equally necessary for the life of the soul. Indeed, it is at the “problem” of water
where soul and body meet today. It may therefore be fitting to close with a few
words from one of the more serious modern students and theoreticians of the
imagination, the American poet Wallace Stevens (1879-1955) who long ago told

us that the “imagination is the power that enables us to perceive the normal in
the abnormal, the opposite of chaos in chaos.”41 His poem, entitled “Exercise for

genial images of water and light — and maybe even hope.
