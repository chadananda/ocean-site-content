  The Emergence and Organization of Chinese

Religions1

Phyllis Ghim Lian Chew

There has never been a time in recorded history when
leadership has not occupied a central place in people’s views
about politics, war, sport or business. In recent decades, there
has been much research-based framework emphasizing
sociological, psychological, behavioural and other theories of
leadership. However, while there have been many studies on
leadership, there has been very little interest on leadership and
succession in religious organisations. For example, Weber
(1993) has described the nature of bureaucracies but has shown
little interest in the internal structure of religion. Likewise, the
field of political science has many papers on democratic
elections but they usually concentrate on policy outcomes.
Economists pay a lot of attention to the internal structure of
firms but not of religion.

Religions are organized in a variety of ways. They may
resemble an elected autocracy, a parliamentary democracy, or
something akin to a monarchy, where heredity plays a primary
role. Mao and Zech (2002) show how doctrinal concerns put
limits on the organisational forms that a religion may take.
Giuriato (2009) in her study of the Catholic Church has written
about an elected autocracy. Historians (Reese, 1996,
Baumgarten 1998) have written about the struggle for power
within a particular religion but their methodologies are not the
same. For the most part, their studies are on Christianity and
Islam and very little is known about the management structure
of Chinese religion.

Archaeological discoveries in China have established that,
from the earliest times, the Chinese people have had an
awareness of the unseen power, felt it and worshipped it.
Despite the fact that they had to endure repeated periods of
upheaval, oppression and chaos, there is no questioning the
close and pervading relationship of religion to the daily lives of
the Chine people. Even when religion was at its ebb during the
time of Mao, Mao was called “the red sun in the heart of the
people throughout the world” and was praised for “unlimited
wisdom, courage and strength” and for “always being with us”.
He was often the object of devotion in songs and rituals with a
strongly religious character. Not surprisingly, since the death of
Mao and while the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is avowedly
atheist, it has been growing more tolerant of religious activities
in the last three decades, not just because of the practical
realization that religious impulses are too deeply embedded to
be effectively eradicated, but also that the moral teachings of
religion might be utilized for the running of the secular state.
Hence, various religious forms such as Mazuism in southern
China, Huandi worship, Black Dragon worship in Shaanxi and
Caishen worship in various parts of China have received
support by state officials.

This public resurgence of religious practice in China has
encouraged burgeoning studies on post-Mao China: for
example, Jing (1996), Lagerwey (2004), Huang and Yang (2005),
and Jones (2010, 2011). In particular, Dean (2009), Yang (2000)
and Flower (2004) have examined how a revival of traditional
religious practices has enabled participants to construct
frameworks of morality in their daily lives. Some preliminary
work has even been done on the little known healers and
shamans, for example, Fan (2003) and Cline (2010). Nevertheless
most of this research has been on the history, philosophy,
festivities and ritualistic practices of the Chinese religion, and
there are still “enormous holes” (Dean 2003, 340), one of which
must certainly be on that of temple management, and in

Chinese Religions                                             11

particular leadership and succession, which is the focus of this
paper.

Research Methodology

Three research trips each about a month’s duration to villages
and townships in the vicinity of Tong’an and Zhangzhou, Fujian
in 2010; Longnan and Tianshui, Gansu in 2011; and to Baoji and
Xi’an, Shaanxi, in 2013 were undertaken by myself. During
these periods, I was able to do ethnographic studies of temple
festivities. Many interviews were conducted at religious sites
and interviews and the interviewees included spirit mediums,
temple managers, Taoist priests and priestesses, monks, nuns,
lay temple staff and ordinary worshippers. Informal
conversation was also undertaken with villagers, intellectuals
and provincial cadres in the provincial religious bureaus. Some
of these were tape-recorded or videoed for subsequent
reflection and analysis. In my travels to rural areas of these
provinces, I have found a temple in almost every village. I have
witnessed a recycling of discontinued ritual practices and new
construction of temples and, last but not least, listened to
monks preaching the scriptures to ever-increasing numbers of
devotees.

Three modes of research may be discerned: 1) participant
observation at temple festivities and interviews with temple
keepers; 2) case studies of the lives of spirit-mediums through a
one-to-one interview; and 3) home visits to adherents of
sectarian organisations. My research questions are concerned
with leadership and succession; namely, the nature of the
religious leadership such as appointment, tenure, and demise
and the relationship between administrative procedures and
religious practice.

The total amount of time I have spent on fieldwork is small
compared with the amount of time ethnographers typically
spend in the field, and I am aware of the limitations of my
work. However, instead of waiting for fuller information, I

12                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

thought it prudent to share my research quickly in view of the
dearth of studies on this topic. As the organizational structure
of the Bahá’í Faith is already well known to the reader of the
Lights of ‘Irfán, this paper has placed its main focus on the
Chinese religion through a description of its many temples, as a
means to give a preliminary insight into its management
structure and especially on leadership and succession. Only in
the concluding section is there a commentary engaged on the
main similarities and differences between the Chinese religion
and the Bahá’í Faith, as gleaned from the research.

The “Chinese Religion”

The whole of China may be considered a sacred space,
containing a continent of spirits, not all of which are
metaphorical. Not surprisingly, Abdu’l-Bahá (1844–1921) has
paid tribute to the Chinese people, describing them as “simple-
hearted and truth-seeking”. “In China one can teach many souls
and train and educate such divine personages that each one of
them may become the bright candle of the world of humanity.”2

The term “Chinese religion” comprises Confucianism,
Daoism, Buddhism, and Shenism, each of which reflects on an
aspect of Chinese life. Confucianism is associated with the
bureaucracy, the traditional educational system, and the
collection of political-moral values drawn from Confucius’
teachings (Chew 1993). Popular Daoism is essentially concerned
with basic issues such as life, death and immortality and
pragmatic issues related to health, wealth, business and
marriage. Sinitic Mahayana Buddhism aims to teach the Buddhist
scriptures as a means of attaining salvation. Finally, Shenism is a
collection of ancient folk practices focusing on the worship of
numerous gods and spirits, exorcism of demons, and the use of
potions and spells for healing and good fortune.

To add to the tapestry, there are also various sects, subsets,
and schools within each of these religions. For example,
philosophical Taoism is quite different from religious Taoism.

Chinese Religions                                               13

Philosophical Taoism is represented by the philosophies of Lao-
tzu (circa 600 B.C.E.) and Chuang-tzu (circa 370–319 B.C.E.), two
influential Chinese sages, documented in texts ascribed to them
— namely, the Tao-teching and the Chuang-tzu — as well as later
materials such as the Huainanzi and the Liezi. Religious Taoism
can be traced to Chang Tao-ling (circa second century C.E.),
who claimed that he had a vision, whereby Lao-tzu gave him the
authority to organize religious communities, to forgive faults
and sins, to heal, and, more important, to exorcise ghosts,
demons, and evil spirits. Over the centuries various schools of
religious Taoism arose with different degrees of emphasis on
revelations, healing, rituals, oracles, and other shamanistic
practices, as evident in the Lushan rite, the Duangong ritual and
theatrical traditions of Sichuan and the thunder rites of Hunan
etc. (Dean 2009). Chinese Buddhism is predominantly of the
Sinitic Mahayana variety and in itself have many subsets, such as
the T’ien-t’ai, the Hua-yen, the Ch’an, the Pure Land, and Folk
Buddhism, both in mainland China and the Chinese communities
in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia.

Another layer is added to this complexity through syncretism
in almost every possible combination. Often, statues of
Confucius, Lao-tzu, and Buddha are set up as objects of
veneration alongside those of traditional Chinese immortals. In
religious ceremonies, Buddhist and Taoist priests and laymen of
various beliefs are seen performing their rites together. Indeed,
religious doctrines, symbols, ceremonies, and even deities have
been so intermingled that it is difficult for even scholars to tell
if they are of Confucian, Buddhist, or Taoist origin. For
example, Caishen (财神), the God of Wealth, begun as a Chinese
folk hero but today both Daoism and Mahayana Buddhism
venerate him as a God. Similarly, while Guanyin (观音) is
inspired from the male bodhisattva Avalokite vara, of India,
“he” has now become a “she” and is venerated as a Chinese
immortal.

In addition to the above variants of the Chinese religion,
there are “charity temples” which are lay in character and which

14                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

meet in private homes. The religious bureau refer to them as
jihui (集会) although they may be more aptly called guohui
(过会) since they are variations on the theme of mutual help
associations which have a long history both in and outside
China. Their members recognize the validity of Confucianism,
Taoism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.

In this paper, the management structure of Chinese religion
is discussed under five broad categories of “temples”, defined
here as an edifice or place dedicated to the service or worship of
a deity or deities. Under this broad definition, some Chinese
homes may be considered temples to themselves since within
their vicinity are altar(s) displaying gods such as Caishen (财神),
Guanyin (观音), and Maitreya (弥勒佛). In Chinese, Miao (庙) is
a word which refers to all kinds of Chinese temples especially
non-Buddhist ones while those which are more Buddhist are
called si (寺). While the subsequent discussion is presented
under a typology of “temple structures”, namely: 1) home
temple; 2) the small built temple; 3) committee temples; 4) the
monastic temple; 5) tourist temple; and last but not least, 6)
charity temples; in practice, they are often not as discrete as
they are made out to be, and their varied physical
manifestations could and should be more usefully construed as a
continuum of religious practices, oftentimes overlapping.

The Home Temple

The “household idiom” (Chau 2010) of the Chinese religion is
essentially a private residence. It happens when a member of the
household begins to show gifts of divination, and unusual
spiritual powers such as glossolalia or the performance of
superhuman feats. Family members will then begin to realize
their sibling’s “special talents” and begin to consult him or her
with regards to their spiritual needs. The news of the divining
“gift” of this member of the family soon spreads to the
extended family and soon neighbours also begin to knock at the
door. Family members may have to help if the initial trickle of

Chinese Religions                                               15

visitors turns into a stream. Eventually, frequent visitors may
inconvenience the family and they may then try to “systematize”
the visitation by delegating certain times or days of the week
for consultation so that their own schedules may not be
compromised. With time, a dedicated room may be assigned, an
altar may be set up and a table purchased. Other religious
paraphernalia such as a statue or picture of the deity(s), censors,
joss-sticks, charm papers, candles, may then be added and what
first began as a spontaneous “service” becomes a formal
“occupation”. As seekers and a “clientele” begin to arrive from
other villages or towns, family members may be pressed to
consider the building of a separate structure near their abode
and if none is available, they may look for a building either to
rent, purchase or build.

There were two mediums, shenpo (神婆), Mdm Liu and
Madam Yan, whom I visited in Western Shaanxi respectively.
Mdm Liu operated from the upper floor of her home, which had
little signs of religiosity from the exterior. However, as we
climbed the stairs to the second floor there was an altar on
which were heaped daily offerings of food, water, incense and
appropriate language. She looked like any other person, was
very pleasant but has been maimed since youth. When a small
crowd of about 10 to 12 people started to form, she began to
go into a trance by kneeling before Jiutian Xuannu (九天玄女
Mysterious Maid of the Highest Heavens) who would graciously
descend at her request to do service. During the time of entry
and exit of the deity, Mdm Liu shook violently and two male
members of the household had to restraint her physically, one
on either side, in case she fell. As Jiutian Xuannu and now
seated on a heavily-built chair, Mdm Liu began to speak with a
distinctly different accent to each person (neatly in queue) who
knelt in front of her to ask their respective question(s). As she
gave the advice, her two assistants would simultaneously
scribble some writings on a talisman, made of either cloth or
paper. For example, if the oracle responded to a query on
illness, there usually would be a prescription given. The assistant

16                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 15

would then advise the client as to what to do with the
prescription — either to bring it to the pharmacy, to burn it at
the altar or to dilute part of it with the medicine prescribed.

As for Mdm Yan, she was “initially confused” when the “call”
came in the 1990’s. She was the third child of five siblings, none
of whom were particularly religious, visiting the neighboring
temple only occasionally, and mostly during festivals. Before
she became a medium at the age of 40, she had had recurring
dreams that she was to give her body to Guanyin. These visions
interfered with her work as a baker’s assistant. She was
eventually dismissed from her job and a close friend then
advised her on the vocation of mediumship. Her husband and
two children were initially afraid and feared that she would be
“lost”, but eventually she managed to overcome their
objections. The family has now accepted her as she is, and even
assists her during her trances, which take place twice weekly.
Clients appear at her household waiting for advice with regards
to problems related to money, education, children, etc.

Both mediums sat on specially designated chairs during the
trance and meditated in front of altars replete with visuals and
statues of deities. Both had low education, never held a steady
job in their lives and could only speak in the vernacular.
Although of low social status, their special abilities gave them a
chance for “respectability” in the village. They did not appear to
profess knowledge about religious scriptures or philosophy
since what was important to them was not knowledge per se but
a belief in the “spirit”, striving to do good, the accumulation of
merit and the use of appropriate language. When I enquired
about the financial aspect of the enterprise, they were puzzled
and explained that money was not the main criteria but that
what was important was sincerity, helpfulness and the
appeasement of the gods.3 No fees were charged but clients were
free to give a donation to offset the cost of maintaining the
altar (food, fruits, candles, incense, etc.) if they felt disposed to
do so. Clients could also, on their own volition, attend special
intercession rituals on the 1st and 15th day of the lunar month.

Chinese Religions                                                17

Both mediums had assistants (family members, the occasional
neighbor) to assist them in a trance state, and their helpful tasks
included the handling of ritual objects, the wiping of the altar
table, assisting in the translation of the oracle and instructing
clients on appropriate behavior in the presence of the medium,
etc.

The house temple remains alive as long as the divining power
is existent. Its operational cost is low and a small number of
local patrons is all that is required to keep it going. The temple
is a law unto itself, without prior existing power structures, and
there is no management pyramid to climb. Mediumship is not
normally “taught” but “caught” and there are no liturgies or
canonical precepts to imbibe. The medium’s success is based on
his or her performance and a skilled medium will attract many,
while an ineffective one will soon have to close his/her practice.
Some mediums are known to lose their “power” as swiftly as
they acquire it and if this be the case, the home ceases to be a
temple. Some mediums also relocate and take their temples with
them. As a home enterprise, succession is normally passed to a
member of the family. However, this is only possible on
condition that the predetermined successor has managed to
cultivate an affinity with the spirit. If this is not possible, upon
the medium’s death or retirement, the home temple may once
again be return to private residency or left vacant, sold, or
rented to another spirit-medium.

While such home temples are regarded as prime examples of
‘feudal superstition’ by the government, and hence “illegal”,
many officials choose not to interfere and close one eye to their
presence since they are small non-political concerns, especially
if they or their family members happen to be clients of the
medium as well. Indeed, during the height of the Cultural
Revolution (1966-1971) when statues of deities were smashed or
discarded, house temples continued their unobtrusive practices
and through word-of-mouth, villagers continued to gather
within to perform religious ceremonies.

Small Built (Spirit) Temple

When the home temple becomes too small for a growing
clientele, a separate dedicated temple structure, the “small built
(spirit) temple,” may be constructed. These have a humble
beginning from mud and thatch and may look more like a
shrine. Over time, it will have a concrete floor, or brick wall,
built from the occasional largesse from grateful clients, and
when this results, the place may no longer look like a
nondescript residence but more like a “temple” (Overmyer
2009). For one, an altar will predominate on which are placed
many visuals and statues of the deity (or deities). The walls,
pillars and roof of the small building may be gifted with a paint
of red and gold with carvings of mythological animals such as
the pixiu and the qilin.4 If the incense burner is free standing,
there will usually be a table in front of it with a lamp to light
the incense. There may be more than one incense burner,
depending on the number of visitors. Holders for stick candles
and “wish candles” may also be placed in front of the incense
burner.

Such small temples originating from spirit mediumship are
owned by a family and may be classified as a small business, in
which case they will have to be registered with the authorities.
One member is usually chosen as the steward while another may
function as the manager, or the two roles may reside in the same
member. In Zhangzhou, I met the temple manager, Mr Chu,
who informed me that he began his spirit-mediumship as a child
of 5, when his grandparents, both of whom were themselves
mediums, dreamt that Guangze Zunwang (广泽尊王), the
ancestral God of filial piety, had designated him to take over the
successorship.5 Hence, while his other siblings graduated from
middle school, he was only educated up to Elementary Grade 3.
On festivals, he took his role as a child medium in trance
alongside his parents and grandparents and did his fair share as
an altar-lad assistant. He is versed in chanting and ritualistic
dance, and has some knowledge of herbal medicine. When his

parents died within a week of each other, he stepped into their
shoes not just as the resident medium of the temple but also as
its manager. He received help from family members especially
on the first and fifteenth day of the lunar calendar when many
visitors would visit the temple to pray.

Mr. Chu reported that he also had cousins who were mediums
in other temples. While these temples may not be exactly
identical in ideological practice to his, this is not so important
as much as the fact that they are helpful to each other. At times,
the clan may get together to hold bigger and more impressive
commemorations of holy days for the villagers. On major
festivals such as the birthday of the deity(s), they may enact a
makeshift stage for a theatrical performance as well as other
ritualistic ceremonies in honor of the deit(ies). In this way, a
blood and spiritual bond is created and a “brotherhood” of
many spirit-mediums in session together from neighboring
temples is not uncommon.

These temples are sustained by donations from worshippers.

The main act of worship is the lighting of incense or joss sticks,
which are generally provided to worshipers in exchange for a
small donation. As congregational membership is non-existent
and worshippers are not required to have allegiance to any
temple — indeed, many do not have allegiance to any temple at
all, but visit different temples for different needs — the
manager may also find it prudent to incorporate popular
bodhisattvas into the temple such as the Milefo (弥勒佛), the
future Buddha, and Shakyamuni (释迦牟尼), the historical
Buddha, flanked by Jiayefo (迦叶佛) and Guanyin. There are also
nature gods, e.g. gods of soil and grain, the dragon god who
manage wind and rain, the five emperors of the five directions,
the sun god, and the moon lady, the various powers of the
planets and the northern dipper. Sometimes their statues are
placed in glass-fronted cabinets, and wooden tables are placed
in front of them to hold the religious offerings of fruits and
food. Padded cushions for kneeling are usually placed in front
of the altar. Each altar or hall of the deity has “merit boxes”

20                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

(gongdexiang 功德箱) where devotees may place a cash offering
if they so desire.

With the growth of the temple, a shrine or two may be added
and small appendages to the building constructed. A special
room may be dedicated for families who wish to put tablets of
their families on a dedicated altar. Here, initial or regular
donations may be necessary to “maintain” the ancestral tablets
through the offerings of food and prayers on special occasions.6
Indeed, some temples may be “private” ones dedicated only to
these functions.

An additional service in many smaller temples, especially
when the medium is not in attendance, is qiuqian (求签), “seek
the deity’s answers through fortune poems”. Here the
worshipper uses a set of fortune poems which is done by
shaking a container of numbered bamboo slips until one of the
slips falls to the group. The number of the slip corresponds to
the number of one of the fortune poems and the poem provides
the god’s answers to the worshipper’s questions or problems. In
busy temples, professional explainers provide explanations of
the meaning of the poem, in relation to the worshipper’s
problems, for a fee.

As the temple grows, more branches may be formed, some of
which are breakaways rather than ‘legal” representative
branches. Breakaways result after the passing of the patriarch
and when there is a disagreement as to how a temple is to be
run. Here, a sibling or partner in the family operation breaks
away and builds another temple either in the same or
neighbouring village to practice his or her own version of
religiosity. This act, of course, engenders the inevitable
acrimony between what are now two competing sects of the
same temple. The viability of the new operation will depend not
just on whether the breakaway will be able to draw adherents
but also keep his own operation intact without generating
additional breakaways from his own nascent group. In addition,

when the temple owner loses interest in his “business”, the
temple may be abandoned or sold to other operators.

Larger Committee (Priestly) Temples

While the rural temple may be small family or clan-run
concerns, larger temples in townships and counties are highly
visible affairs where official registration with the authorities
become important. Here, one may find prominently displayed
on the temple’s noticeboard a certificate of authorization as a
place of religious practice (宗教使用场所) alongside a set of
regulations banning foreign intervention and control of
religious activities and organizations. Such temples are more
often run by a committee of unrelated members, most of whom
are the elders or respected of the religion. They may run it
themselves as a committee (comprising normally a chairperson,
vice-chairperson, secretary, treasurer and sub-committee
members) with the help of a full-time salaried “steward” to run
the day-to-day operations. These committees are not to be taken
lightly since they provide a growing range of social and cultural
services and infrastructural improvement at the local level
whenever central government control or intervention declined.
They sponsor religious rites, manage popular communal operas
and according to Dean (2009) are akin to “China’s second
government”.

Such temples may also employ full or part-time Daoist
priest(s). The payment for the priests usually goes to the Head
Priest who will then allocate it among his subordinates. Unlike
the spirit-mediums who are more concerned with faith, the
priest is usually a literate and educated individual who is
concerned in performing rituals with some orderliness. Here,
priests perform daily rituals before the altar to the principal
deity on a schedule that is determined by agreement with the
temple managers. The priests are dressed in colorful robes, are
involved in coordinated chanting, singing and bowing before
the altar with occasional accompaniment by percussion

22                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

instruments. Their oratorio-like liturgical performance often
provides a solemn and spiritual spectacle for viewers (Chau
2011). Their chanting, often in scriptural language
incomprehensible to adherents, creates a calming and spiritual
atmosphere which is soothing.

There is another advantage of engaging the clergy as most of
them are registered with a branch of the official Daoist
association to which they report. This then becomes a way for
most temples to gain the necessary legitimacy with the state.
Head priests may be expected to meet important visitors and
government officials and they are normally appointed by the
local Daoist association, which may also get a share of the
annual payment paid to the priest. While their presence may be
an expensive item in the temple’s budget, this is often
compensated by the fact that they may be commissioned to
perform special “private” ceremonies by devotees. In such cases,
the money earned will be split between the priest and the
temple’s general accounts.

There are a variety of ways to recruit the priests (Yang et al.

2005). One may engage them through a contract arranged
through the local Daoist Association which is a sub-branch of
the Chinese Daoist Association (CDA) (中国道教协会).7 Monks
here are graduates of the Quanhen sect with their headquarters
in Beijing (白云观, White Cloud Temple). CDA has branches all
over China and Quanchen graduates work in state-sponsored
institutions and government agencies, having been trained not
only in Daoism but also Marxism. Another source of hire is
from a local lineage which means that the priest in question has
been trained under a specific ritual master and adopted into his
or her lineage such as Celestial Masters (神仙). Daoist ritual
masters transmit their liturgical texts and practices to their sons
and disciples in discrete, local lines of transmission. Some
ordination certificates make a reference to Longhushan
(龙虎山), the hereditary center of the Zhengyi Tianshi Celestial
Masters (正一天师). The system is not too regulated yet and
some temple managers or entrepreneurs can move between

temples. Some also gain qualifications to serve in a temple with
very minimal training (cf. Yang et al. 2005).

With the secularization of religious activities, there are
further opportunities for income generation. For example,
“temple fair” activities have recently become major fundraising
events for temples. Such fairs are a form of both worship and
entertainment and are recognized by provincial authorities as
‘immaterial cultural heritage’ (非物质文化遗产) worthy of
preservation. The contents of the temple fairs are different
from place to place but generally the following stable features
may be discerned: the local opera, shadow-play and story-telling.
Additional personages such as guest monks, spirit–mediums, a
Chinese orchestra, acrobats and the Lion and Dragon dance
troupes are also invited to complement the activities in the
temple.

Monastic Temples

While the concept of “priest” is associated with Daoism, the
concept of a “monk” is more akin to Buddhism. However, due
to the syncretic nature of Chinese religion, it may at times be
difficult to differentiate the two and the term may be used
interchangeably. For example, some monks may be approached
to perform exorcism and dispense charms, in which case he may
actually function like a Daoist priest. On the other hand, I have
witnessed state-licensed Daoist priests in Baoji performing
healing sessions in Buddhist temples and functioning much like a
jitong (乩童) but without the self-mortification which may
accompany such events.

Some monastic temples are on faraway mountain cliffs
therefore outside institutional control. However, others which
are more accessible are well-known, for example, Mount Tai in
the east (1545 m., near Confucius birthplace in Qufu), Hua in
the west (2200 m., near Xian), Heng in the north (2017 m.),
Nanyue (Hengshan) in the south (1290 m. near Changsha) and
Song in the center (1440 m., near Luoyang, south of the Shaolin

monastery). Most of these mountains have multiple peaks and
include large scale temples at the bottom as well as numerous
hermitage and monasteries perched on mountain tops and built
into cliffs. The monks in the mountainous region aim to pursue
enlightenment through meditation and learning and in this
regard they are different from the monks in the city, whose
functions are more ceremonial and consultative.

Monastic temples are those which contain residency and
schooling for Buddhist monks. The lowest rank is
shami（沙弥） or acolyte (an inexperienced monk who has
recently entered religion). The next rank is biqiu (比丘) (a
Buddhist monk as he gains experience). The third is zhuchi (主持
or 方丈) or abbot (the superior of an abbey of monks). The
administrative staff in a temple include fangzhang (方丈) or
abbot, jianyuan (监院) or monastic manger and shouzuo (首座)
or chief monk. The abbot runs the temple in a patriarchal and
authoritarian manner as would the head of a typical Chinese
household with a knowledge learnt through apprenticeship from
a master which is in turn imparted to his disciples. He controls
both the religious and administrative activities and assigns
various tasks to his disciples and temple assistants. He is the
spiritual guardian, the model of morality and personal behavior
and he may be able to lecture on the dharma.

Monastic temples derived income from the provision of
religious service. Substantial financial contributions may also be
given by grateful worshippers or merchants who have benefitted
from the temples as contractors of various services to the
monastery. Generally, the temple’s relationship to its adherent is
based on mutual benefit — where the worshippers enjoy
religious service and who in turn will donate some largesse
should their prayers be granted. Income for temple maintenance
is also available from the practices of purification, exorcism,
healing and blessings (for marriages, houses, cars and
businesses), as well as from the sale of talismans, amulets, and
charms. Like Daoist priests, Mahayana monks are also hired not
just for communal sacrifices (jisi 祭祀; fahui 法会) at local

temples dedicated to the gods of the local pantheon, but also at
private funeral and requiem services and other minor rites for
individuals and families from which they may receive a fee.

In the last decade, as part of the process of increasing
legalization in China, there has been a gradual trend towards the
need for fiscal oversight, legal property rights and a more
formalized organization subjected to the rules and regulations
spelled out in the Buddhist Association of China (中国佛教协会)
which is under the Bureau of Religious Affairs.8 Hence, larger
monastic temples have a part which is administrative and a part
which is religious and while monks and nuns may be involved in
administration, they are usually confined to the religious sphere.
Such temples enjoy the managerial expertise of a lay committee.
Here, the chairperson, who is also a Buddhist, is empowered to
make decisions after consultations with committee members,
subject to the local Buddhist/Daoist association, the first
supervising body which is state-controlled and whose
administrators include ordained clergy as well as supportive lay
followers. In such a scenario, the daily running of the temple
(correspondences, records, and coordination) is usually under
the purview of the Vice-President and Secretary. The treasurer is
concerned with the collection of subscriptions or donations
form members. He/she holds the petty cash account and defrays
small expenditures incurred by temple, while larger expenditure
are approved by the main committee, which are audited.
Numerous sub-committees, headed by a sub-leader, help with
other tasks such as temple publications, fundraising, and charity
work and temple restoration.

Tourist Temples

Tourist temples are managed and controlled by government
or business instead of religionists and their religious dimension
is overshadowed by other concerns (Chau 2011).9 Since the
1990’s many new temples have been built, reconstructed or
restored not just as a means of cultural self-assertion but also as

26                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

a means of revenue generation (Yang et al. 2005). The Shaolin
temple in Henan is one temple that draws a steady stream of
visitors, most arriving on tour buses, because of its historic
significance and its uniqueness as a famous center for martial
arts training. Other temples in the mountains are also able to
attract visitors for similar reasons. Understandably, these
temples are supervised not just by the Religious Affairs Bureau
but also by the Department of Tourism. Not so much concerned
with religious activities or the creation of a spiritual
atmosphere, they are manned by a management interested
mainly in revenue and the smooth entertainment of large
crowds. Part of the profits are channeled towards restoration
and expansion, so that many temples now have a revived and
energized look, are open to the public, and offer a wide variety
of religious resources (books, charms, herbs, teas, martial
training). There are also state-run temples such as the Wild
Goose Pagoda in Xi’an (西安市), where the government will
tacitly choose the religious leaders who are schooled in the
doctrine of Marxism and compliant with governmental
supervision. While beautiful, without an active oracle and the
mediumistic talents which was the beginning of the whole
process, the gods remain lifeless, encased in their museum-like
tombs.

Not all entrepreneurial ventures such as these are successful.

For example the former home of Chinese saint, Huang Daxian,
was originally erected in 1995 to draw tourists and overseas
pilgrims (Chan and Lang 2007). As this was not successful, the
township officials modified their efforts and tried to draw local
visitors instead through the contract-responsibility system.
Here, the temple is contracted to a head priest who would be
required to pay an agreed rental annually to the committee in
return for the right to operate the temple (and to keep surplus
revenues). It now depends on the charisma and management
skills of the head priest to keep the temple going through the
organization of festivities and other religious activities. One
popular way of generating a revenue stream for temples is

through the installation of light towers. These towers are
circular structures, about three to six feet high placed near the
main altar so that the deity’s benevolence may radiate over
them, implying the blessings and protection provided by the
divine forces in the temple. The towers comprise ascending
rows of electrically illuminated niches, each of which carries a
person’s name and date of birth and symbolically represents the
presence of those who have purchased niches in the towers. The
price for each niche in a light tower varies, depending on
whether the niche is in a larger band of niches at the bottom, or
a smaller band near the top.

In brief, tourist temples, such as Zhongnanshan Guanyin
Chanyuan (终南山观音禅院/) at the foot of Qinling Mountain
in Chang’an, are built at the expense of private entrepreneurs
and therefore are accountable to the local business company.
These are run along the guidelines of modern corporations and
defer to the chief investor who has close ties with government
officials.10 Indeed, more and more Chinese Buddhist and Taoist
temples are passively packaged with tourist products and some
are even listed on the stock market.11

Charity Temples

Charity temples share features of secularity, sectarianism,
benevolence and religiosity and are a traditional distinctive
feature of traditional Chinese practice dating to the shantang
(benevolent halls 善堂) and shanhui (benevolent associations
善会) of the Ming dynasty. They take place in homes or offices,
and are relatively democratic as membership is non-hierarchical
and without a central authority. Preferring spontaneity and
innovation rather than stylized liturgies, they are basically lay
gatherings with no professional clergy. They are opportunistic,
non-dogmatic, consultative groups of spiritually-minded
people. They have a pragmatic “do it because it works” and
“seek spiritual guidance because it pays.” While some have
charismatic leaders, many do not. They are basically grassroots

28                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

movements, well-organized with members passing information
to one another through an informal network. There is no
national umbrella for such organizations as these are centered in
homes and therefore do not require any registration with the
authorities.12 While some may be registered, most are not. For
example, the Beijing-based Yidanxuetang (一耽学堂), a non-
profit association, is legal and carries out a number of activities
such as rites and ceremonies to honor Confucius, study tours in
the countryside, editing word and charitable acts (Billoud
2011).13

Charity temples are basically mutual help organizations,
philanthropic, and benevolent in nature. They share a set of
Confucian ethical standards and moral obligations such as the
Hall of Spreading Benevolence (广瑞堂) established by social
elites in Tianjin in 1878 (cf. Laliberte 2011). The members are
encouraged to follow morality practices such as the “five
ethics” and “eight virtues” (from Confucianism), say daily
prayer two or three times a day, attend religious classes, and
chant scriptures. Their constitution lists objectives such as the
promotion of morals and values irrespective of race, color and
creed, and the worship and reverence of founders of all major
religions. Good deeds are more important than priestly words
and some of these temples have contributed to the building of
schools, old folks home and the running of free clinics for the
poor.

Charity temples are also religious in nature since their
dedication to the common good stems basically from religious
motives. Palmer (2011) terms them as “salvationist” while Duara
(2003) refers to them as “redemptive societies” as they are
influenced by an ancient millenarian and syncretistic tradition
and advocate the salvation of both the self and the world.
Rather than being world-denying or other-worldly, they are
affirmative, multiracial and multi-religious. Many practice
divination, spirit-writing, healing and ancestor veneration. On
special occasions, an entranced medium may write out messages
believed to originate from the patron saint of the association.

These messages include commentaries on Confucian and Daoist
classics, stories of karmic retribution from Buddhism,
descriptions of spirit-journeys to otherworldly realms, moral
exhortations, and theoretical treatises on points of religious
doctrine and cultivation. These commentaries may be discussed
in regular group meetings that resemble a combination of
Protestant preaching and Sunday school. Studied by group
members, they may be collected and published for distribution
to the public as “morality books” (善书).

The porous, essentially inclusive and undogmatic nature of
charity temples attracts many adherents. While this may explain
its strength in the several home gatherings I have attended, these
associations are also highly sectarian in nature. Its open-
endedness and flexibility means that certain groups may add
new ideas which may not agree well with all members, leading a
section to break away, since in the very first instance, there are
only very general principles to adhere to. For example, while the
Xiantian Dao (先天道) sect claim to represent a Way (dao 道)
that transcends and unites all other through the unity of the
“five religions (Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity
and Islam), the group is paradoxically divided into various
“breakaway”       subgroups    with    variations    in    liturgy,
organizational structure and doctrine. Its deviational
offsprings, such as the Tongshan She (同善社 “Society of
Goodness”), Tian De (天德教 “Sacred Religion of Celestial
Virtue”) and Tien Di (天帝教 “Religion of the Lord of
Heaven”), Daoyuan (道院 “Sanctuary of the Tao”), and the Ci
Hui Tang (慈惠堂 “Compassion Society”), continue to resemble
the mother body through their non-ascriptive voluntary path of
salvation; and an embodied experience through healing.14

Dissension commonly occurs at the passing of the founder or
charismatic leader or sub-leader. For example, in the case of the
Yiguan Dao (一贯道, “the Pervasive Truth”) at the time of its
patriarch, Chang T’ien-jen’s death in 1947, the nominal
leadership passed though the hands of the Matriarch Madam Sun
Hui Ming.15 There were opposition to her leadership and the

30                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

group eventually split into a number of separate branches, all of
them developing more or less independently with many making
their way to Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States and
Southeast Asia establishing their own versions of the Yíguàn
Dào. Today, Yíguàn Dào remains a family of closely related but
autonomous branch associations.

These associations are not legally registered in China but
many continue to exist in private homes and one must be
invited to attend its private sessions since there are no public
announcements of its meetings. It is not very clear how these
associations are organized since ordinary members themselves
often do not know how it is run, professing, when asked, that
“names are unimportant” — it is only the teachings (and the
good deeds) to be passed to others that are important. Indeed,
most grassroots members do not know the official names of
their groups or the names of the founder-members of the group.
However, we may assume that among each active group are
informally elected chairperson and secretary, treasurer, and a
list of other sub-committee members, much as one may expect
of a legally registered society. The owner of the home in which
it is held is usually a leader or sub-leader of the group and “a
descendant of famous masters.” The informal management
usually comprises the largest donors and or the most successful
teachers of the group.

Some of these groups may on special occasions elect to meet
in a neighboring temple to worship. Sometimes, one group or
several groups may combine their resources to build their own
dedicated committee temple and in this way start life afresh as a
legally registered entity.

Conclusion

This paper has attempted to unravel the diversity and
complexity in the emergence and organization of Chinese
temples with particular focus on their leadership and succession
procedures. It is clear that religiosity is alive and well in

mainland China and that China is, in reality, a religious state
and Chinese society a religious one (cf. Lagerway 2010). While
all local religious groups are monitored strictly by national and
state organizations under the supervision of the Religious
Affairs Bureau of the State Council, there is a great regional
variation in the degree of support and cooperation between
these agencies and religious institutions. In some provinces,
such as Sichuan and Hubei, Chinese religionists are made very
welcome and religious activities are supported with enthusiasm.
In other provinces, such as Shaanxi and Hunan, politicians tend
to be wary of religious organizations and a relatively restrictive
mode prevails.

I will now conclude by drawing comparisons from other
religions, not least to add scope to the discussion but also to
illuminate the practice of leadership and succession in the field
of comparative religion. Here, the Bahá’í Faith is given
particular attention not least because it emphasizes the spiritual
unity of all humankind, that diversity of race and culture are
seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance, and that all
major religions stem from the same spiritual source; but also
because this journal is centered on its scholarly study.

Succession is a problem with many religions and the Chinese
religion is not an exception to the rule. In our survey, sectarian
divisions abound, in various syncretic forms within the Chinese
religion. While temples may be sold, restarted, closed down, and
expanded, according to changing social-economic circum-
stances, the greatest test of viability usually comes at the time
when the founder or patriarch/matriarch passes away. At such
occasions, there is often a power struggle and the temple may be
split into two or more factions. This phenomenon is not
peculiar to Chinese religion but is common in all major
religions. For example, Islam was split after the death of the
Prophet Mohammad between the followers of Abu Bakr (Sunni)
and those of Ali bin Abu Talib (Shia). Christianity has seen even
more fractures even before the well-known split of Martin
Luther from the Catholic fold in the 16th century.16 Chinese

32                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

religion has had a long history of factionalisms and disunity.
Hence, the establishment of the Buddhist and Daoist
associations by the Chinese government should not simply be
seen as a measure of social control but also as a means to
promote the public image of the Chinese religion. For example,
both the Taoist and Buddhist associations aim to banish the
superstitious, mystical magical elements of Chinese religion and
to standardize and consolidate its teachings so as to allow it to
move with the times.17 Successorship problems are often due to
the lack of clearly written succession codes. In contrast, the
Bahá’í Faith is predicated upon clear and detailed instructions
within its own sacred text. Explicit instructions concerning
successorship are also given. Bahá’u’lláh clearly named a
successor in the Book of the Covenant, which also serves as his
Last Will and Testament. There is no such authoritative
document in the Chinese religion and, as we have already
recounted, any individual who feels spiritually endowed can
start his own home temple or join a religious order as a means
of exercising religious power.

An examination of the management structure of Chinese
religion shows it to be run much like a family firm. Hence,
despite guidelines laid down by the Daoist and Buddhist
Associations and the Bureau of Religious Affairs, Chinese
temples are still not quite regarded as civic institutions with
activities accountable to the public. Leadership remains
basically patriarchal and based on the Confucian “familial”
structure where the eldest member, usually male, prevails. In
monastic temples, the clergy is organized like a family and
promotion within the order depends on the whims and fancies
of the chief monk, the patriarch. In committee temples,
although the chairperson has to consult his committee before
making a decision, more often than not the committee members
will defer to his wishes or say what the “head” of the temple
wishes to hear. While large temples may theoretically confine
the Head monk to the role of religious specialist in line with
modern management principles, it must be noted that many

monks continue to assume the status of the administrative
chairperson, while nominating religious duties to others under
his charge. Even when de jure power is held by an appointed lay
member chair, it is the head monk who is the de facto head of
the temple, as he is often regarded, deferentially, as the
“grandfather”. Similarly, in the small built temple, the temple
manager is the “patriarch” (or “matriarch”) of decision making
whether or not he is the spirit medium or a manager of the spirit
medium. It is often the tendency of the leader to elect a
successor who will allow him or her to keep their influence and
legacy. Even in relatively democratic charity temples, the
elections of key “senior” members are done through prayers and
planchette divination. The problem is that in most scenarios,
these key senior members are themselves planchette mediums or
have a relationship to planchette mediums through which they
may easily influence nominations. In contrast to the above
practice of familial autocratic leadership, the Bahá’í Faith is
administered by a unique combination of freely elected councils
and a complementary institution of appointed advisers which
operates at the local, regional, national, and international levels.
There is no class of ecclesiastics or clergy in the Bahá’í Faith.

According to Mao Zedong, “women hold up half the sky”
(妇女能顶半边天), but I saw few women in leadership position
in temples other than that of the home temple. There appears to
be a glass ceiling for women temple leaders, be it in the small
built, committee, monastic, tourist and/or charity temples. Yet
temple women do a tremendous amount of background work,
such as coordination with patrons and worshippers,
administrative, secretarial and domestic duties and assisting the
monks in ritual service. Bounkenborg (2012) has recounted a
scenario where males are openly seen in “frontline roles” in the
temple fair of a local dragon deity in Fanzhuang, Hebei, while
female spiritual mediums are doing “background” ritualistic
duties in the home. This “glass ceiling” amidst the rise of global
feminism is not peculiar only to Chinese religion but also a
current challenge faced by other major religions such as

34                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Christianity, Islam and Hinduism where the patriarchal culture,
social norms, economic marginalization and political
inequalities pose barriers that affect women and reduce their
access to employment opportunities and religious education
(Madimbo 2012). In contrast, Bahá’u’lláh has exalted the status
of women and allowed them to hold positions on both the local
and national governing councils though a democratic electoral
system. There are also women on its advisory arm, namely in
their roles as Counselors and Auxiliary Board Members.

Both the Bahá’í and Chinese temples are alike in the sense
that both have no pulpits where sermons by clerics can be given.
There is no “congregation” such as those found in churches or
mosques and no communal recitation of prayers. However,
while worshippers who come to a Bahá’í temple may have simply
come into the central hall to sit down quietly and reflect on
their own thoughts or on the world’s sacred scriptures, or on
special occasions to listen to the singing of voices on scriptural
passages, this is not the practice in Chinese temples. In visiting
a Chinese temple, there are many “tasks” that a believer is
supposed to perform, such as lighting the joss-sticks, the
offering of food and flowers, the burning of talismans, and the
worship and recitation of prayers and mantras at various altar
tables. There may also be the consulting of Chinese fortune
sticks and perhaps a queue to consult the temple medium.

Since there is a tendency of wholeness and a sense to look
towards the relativity of particulars within the universal
totality, one finds more tolerance than dogmatic determination
and ideological opposition where membership criteria are
concerned. There is, for example, no central figure as a point of
reverence; instead there is an array of gods, deities, ghosts and
demons which the believer may adopt according to his
individual preference. Hence the individual is relatively free to
believe what he or she chooses and is free to move from temple
to temple according to his or her needs. In contrast, the Bahá’í
community is predicated upon clear and detailed instructions
which exist within its sacred text. Bahá’ís define their members

as those who have accepted Bahá’u’lláh as the messenger of God
for this age, and this often requires that the member sign a
declaration card to the effect for administrative purposes,
including also the electoral roll of the annual election of their
governing bodies.

The fact that the Chinese religion is generally non-exclusive
and temples cannot bind worshippers to a particular temple nor
their exclusion of worship at other temples, has led it to lose
many of its members to other religions such as Christianity, in
recent years in China. This is aggravated by the fact that there is
little need to learn complex texts or rituals (or to relearn them
when switching to another temple). There is a tendency in the
Chinese religion to be ambiguous, ambivalent and indeterminate
in the name of social harmony. In contrast, the Bahá’í Faith (like
Christianity, Judaism and Islam), finds it important to organize
schools and classes for their believers and the children of their
believers as a means of familiarizing them with their religious
texts and scriptures. Hence, there are a lot more social capital at
stake in these religions, making it more difficult for adherents
to leave the religion. In contrast, in Chinese temple worship,
little or no attempt is made to entrench the adherent and his or
her offspring within a particular temple or religious ideology.

I believe that it is inevitable that Chinese religionists will
soon have to grapple seriously with problems of internal
governance as a result of the increased demand for greater
transparency brought about by mass education, modernization
and technological advances. To ensure their continued viability,
temple management will have to come to terms with managerial
challenges that have become obvious in our discussion, namely,
the challenge of unity in succession disputes; sectarian divisions
in various syncretic forms within the Chinese religion; the
limitations of patriarchal autocratic control and public
accountability; of issues relating to gender equality; and the
continued loss of significant numbers of youthful members to
“external religions” such as Christianity.

\[4\] The pixiu (貔貅) is a guardian animal standing for fair play and right while

\[6\] I have seen temples with altars with about 100 tablets belonging to about

10 families.

\[7\] In Xian city, I was able to visit and interview temple personages in Ba Xian

Au (八仙庵)

\[8\] It was founded in 1953 at the urging of followers of Taixu,(1890-1947)

> from the Linji school of Chan Buddhism in Xiao Jiǔhuá Temple
> (小九華寺/小九华寺) in Suzhou.

\[9\] This is not to say that my other categories of temple do not attract tourists.

\[12\] Some examples are The Red Swastika Society (世界红卍字会),
> founded in China in 1922, as the philanthropic branch of the Daode she
> ((道德社)) or the Daoyuan Not legally registered in China, it is however
> thriving in the diasporic communities of Hong Kong, Taiwan and
> Singapore.

\[13\] Their legality may be due to their more subdued call of a “cultural
> renaissance” rather than that of “salvation for the world”.

\[14\] In brief, the sub-sects are variations on the same theme and one way to
> enhance their distinctiveness from one another is the use of different
> names to refer to the supreme mother deity. For example, in the T’ung-
> shan She, it is referred to as the “Venerable Mother of Limitless Heaven”
> (Wuji Laomu), in the Tz’u-hui Tang as the “Golden Mother of the Jasper
> Pool” (Yao-ch’ih Chin-mu), and as the “Unborn Sacred Mother” (Wusheng
> Shengmu) (cf. Palmer: 2011).

\[15\] Yiguan Dao was founded in 1930 by Chang T’ien-jn (1889-1947) in
> Shantung. It incorporates elements not just from Confucianism, Daosim
> and Buddhism but also Christianity and Islam. Currently, it is banned in
> China but this has not kept it from practicing through different names such
> as The Confucus-Mencius Society, The Morality Society, etc. They have
> also been called the Zhenli Tiandao (真理天道, The True Celestial Tao).

\[16\] Even more tightly knit Christian communities such as the Mormons found
> themselves embroiled in a succession dispute which resulted in several
> distinct branches of the congregation after the passing of their founder-
> prophet Joseph smith in 1844.
