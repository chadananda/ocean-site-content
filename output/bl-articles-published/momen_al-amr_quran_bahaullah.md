A STUDY OF THE MEANING OF THE WORD “AL-AMR”
IN THE QUR’ÁN AND IN THE WRITINGS OF BAHÁ’U’LLÁH

Moojan Momen

ummary: The word “amr” in Persian or “al-amr” in Arabic has a range of meaning that covers sev-

S    eral words in English. In two instances the precise meaning has become a source of controversy and

it is therefore necessary to examine this matter more carefully. In this paper, I will look in detail at
the use of the word in the Qur’án in order to delineate the semantic range for this word in the Qur’án.
This is in order to examine the assertion by Bahá’í apologists that the term “al-amr” in Qur’án 32:5 (“He
establishes His Decree—al-amr—from heaven to earth and it will return to Him in a Day, the length of
which is one thousand years in your reckon in g”) refers to the appearance of a new religion one thousand
years after the Prophet Mu˙ammad. I will also examine the semantic range of the occurrence of this
word in the early writings of Bahá’u’lláh in order to assess the assertion of Prof. E.G. Browne that the
phrase “maßdar-i-amr” which appears in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán is an acknowledgement by Bahá’u’lláh of the
leadership of Azal at the time of the revelation of the ˆqán in about 1861– 62 .

The purpose of this paper is to study the semantic range of the word al-Amr in two contexts: the
Qur’án and the early writings of Bahá’u’lláh during the Baghdad period. The reason for this study is
because this word has become controversial with respect to two particular passages, one occurring in the
Qur’án and one in Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-ˆqán.

The first passage which we shall consider in this paper involves the fifth verse of the Suráh al-Sajdah
in the Qur’án. In order not to prejudge the issue of the exact meaning of the word al-amr in this set-
ting, I will here give Yusuf Ali’s translation but inserting the transliteration of al-amr:

> He establishes al-amr from heaven to earth and it will return to Him in a Day, the length of
> which is one thousand years in your reckoning (32:5)
This verse is involved in a controversy in relation to the polemics between Islam and the Bahá’í Faith.

Bahá’ís consider that the verse refers to the appearance of a new revelation from God one thousand years
after the coming of Mu˙ammad. Because of the Muslim understanding of the concept of Mu˙ammad
being the ‘Seal of the Prophets,’ Muslims interpret this verse without any implication of the coming of
a further revelation from God.

The second passage which has involved controversy over the meaning of the word al-amr, is a state-
ment made by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, again merely transliterating al-amr at the point where it
occurs in Shoghi Effendi’s translation:

> By the righteousness of God! Our withdrawal contemplated no return, and Our separation
> hoped for no reunion. The one object of Our retirement was to avoid becoming a subject of
> d is cord among the faithful, a source of disturbance unto Our companions, the means of injury
> to any soul, or the cause of sorrow to any heart. Beyond these, We cherished no other inten-
> tion, and apart from them, We had no end in view. And yet, each person schemed after his own
> desire, and pursued his own idle fancy, until the hour when, from the Source of al-amr, there
> came the summons bidding Us return whence We came. Surrendering Our will to His, We sub-
> mitted to His injunction. (Bahá’u’lláh: Kitáb-i-ˆqán, p. 251)
This passage, in which Ba há’u’lláh relates the circumstances surrounding his return to Baghdad after his
sojourn in Sulaymáníyyi h, is involved in a controversy in relation to the polemics between Bahá’ís and the

supporters of Mírzá Ya˙yá Azal. Supporters of Azal’s position, such as E.G. Browne, have translated this
passage as referring to a summons by Mírzá Ya˙yá instructing Bahá’u’lláh to return to Baghdad.

His reason for altering this resolution was that ‘the order to return emanated from the source of com-
mand’, which clearly shows us that at this date (A.D. 1861–62) Behá still recognized Ezel as his chief, and
submitted to his authority, at least nom in ally.1

Browne thus used this passage as evidence that at the time of the composition of the ˆqán in 1861–2,
Bahá’u’lláh still acknowledged the leadership of Azal. Bahá’ís maintain that the ‘source of command’
(maßdar-i amr) which Browne considers to be Azal, in fact refers to God. In other words that it was on
God’s instructions that Bahá’u’lláh returned to Baghdad. Shoghi Effendi translates ‘maßdar-i amr’ as
‘Mystic Source,’

A. Al-Amr in the Qur’án
Returning now to the first instance that we are exam in ing in this paper, we must try to establish the
meaning of the word al-amr in this verse of the Qur’án. We have various approaches to this question that
we can util iz e.

1. Dictionary definitions. In the first place it is useful to examine what is stated in the standard dictio-
naries. In Edward Lane’s Lexicon of the Arabic Language, there are two series of meaning given for amr:

A. ‘a command; an order; a bidding; an injunction; a decree; an ord in ance; a prescript’ with the plur-
al of awámir and the antonym of nahy (prohibition).

B. ‘a thing; an affair; a business; a matter; a concern; a state, of a person or thing, or of persons or
things or affairs or circumstances; a condition; a case; an accident; an event’ with synonyms of shan,
˙ál, halah, ˙ádithah, or fi‘l and a plural of umúr.

In exam in ing this Qur’ánic verse in the light of Lane’s definition of amr, there are two considerations.

The first is: which meaning goes best with the preceding word “yudabbiru”? And the second is: which
meaning goes best with the following phrase which refers to al-amr descending from heaven to earth and
then ascending again. With regard to the first question, yudabbiru, which is the third person of the pre-
sent/future tense of the II form verb of the root d-b-r, can be translated by a wide range of English
words: to make arrangements, prepare plans, plan, organize, devise, arrange, bring about, contrive,
direct, conduct, manage, run, reg ul ate. It would appear that mean in gs in either range A or B above would
fit with yudabbiru, although range B would be somewhat better. With regard to the second question,
however, it is clear that mean in gs in range A fit much better: the picture of God sending down com-
mands, orders, injunctions, decrees or ord in ances from heaven to earth is one that is common to all of
the religions of the Abrahamic line.

2. Qur’ánic Commentary. It is also usual in trying to ascertain the meaning of a passage in the Qur’án
to consult the various standard commentaries on the Qur’án. Most of the commentaries do not appear
to give a direct opinion on the meaning of the word ‘amr’. One exception is al-Kashshaf of az-
Zamakhsharí (d.1144) which comments thus on this verse:

> ‘Al-amr’—He causes the acts of obedience and pious deeds which are ordained (al-ma’múr bihi
> min at-†á‘át wa’l-a‘mál as-ßáli˙ah) to be sent down in an organ iz ed manner (mudabbiran) ‘from
> the heavens to the earth.’ Then they are not acted upon and there does not arise to Him those
> things that are ordained in a pure form as He desires and wishes except in a very lengthy peri-
> od of time on account of the fewness of numbers of the workers of God and of the paucity of
> pious souls among His servants. And the fewness of deeds that ascend is because only right-
> eous deeds are described as ascending and the evidence for this is His words concerning its
> effect: ‘little thanks do ye give’ (23:78) or He establishes the amr of all of the world from heav-
> en to earth for every day of the days of God; and this is one thousand years, just as He has
> said: ‘Verily a day with your Lord is as one thousand years as you reckon.
> ‘Then it will return to Him’—that is to say whatever is ra is ed up of this amr and enters into
> being will go to Him and will be confirmed with Him and will be written down in the scrolls

\[82\] Lights of ‘Irfán

> of His angels every moment of this period of time until this period reaches its end. Then He
> will arrange also the last Day and so on until the [Last] Hour arises. And it is said that the rev-
> elation (al-wahy) is sent down with Gabriel (upon him be peace) from the heaven to the earth
> and then whatever acceptance or rejection of the revelation there was returns to Him with
> Gabriel. This occurs in a time that is in reality one thousand years because the distance of trav-
> el is one thousand years in descent and ascent inasmuch as the distance between heaven and
> earth is a journey of five hundred years and it becomes a day of your days on account of the
> speed of Gabriel, for he cuts through a journey of one thousand years in one day. And it is said:
> He establishes the amr of the world from the heaven to the earth until the [Last] Hour arises,
> then all of this amr will return to Him, that is to say it will go to Him in order that He may
> judge it.
> ‘In a day, the length [miqdar, amount] of which is one thousand years’—and this is the Day of
> Resurrection (yawm al-qiyámah)2
From this lengthy extract from az-Zamakhsharí, the following interpretations may be derived.

Zamakhsharí evidently interprets al-amr as the decree of God to human beings concerning what are cor-
rect and righteous actions that should be performed in obedience to God (at-†á‘át wa’l-a‘mál as-ßáli˙ah).
These are carried down by Gabriel and it appears from this passage that az-Zamakhsharí identifies what is
sent down with al-wahy, the revelation that is sent down to the Messengers of God. This would be logical
since the revelation of God’s decrees concerning correct and righteous actions was the very purpose of the
coming of the Messengers of God, such as the Prophet Mu˙ammad. And of course the revelation to
Mu˙ammad was carried by the angel Gabriel. Lastly, az-Zamakhsharí describes this process as continuing
until the Last Hour and he identifies the ‘day’ mentioned in this verse with the Day of Resurrection.

Al-Bay∂áwí (d. 1291) repeats much of az-Zamakhsharí, almost word for word in places. He does not
give a specific interpretation of the word amr, but rather explains the first part of this verse as mean-
ing: ‘He organizes the amr of the world with heavenly instruments such as the angels and others, their
effects going down to the earth.’3 Later in explaining the second half of the verse, al-Bay∂áwí repeats az-
Zamakhsharí’s phrase ‘the acts of obedience which are ord a in ed (al-ma’múr bihi min at-†á‘át)’ thus implic-
itly agreeing with the latter’s gloss on al-amr. Al-Bay∂áwí repeats the identification of what is sent down
as being revelation (al-wahy) and also the assertion that this process will go on until the Last Hour and
will end when it returns to Him on the Day of Resurrection. Thus al-Bay∂áwí concurs in all of the main
points that we have identified above in az-Zamakhsharí’s commentary.

Other authors of commentaries on the Qur’án are not so helpful. Many of them seem to give most of
their attention in commenting on this verse to statements about how long angels take in descending
from heaven to earth. Thus for example Ibn Kathír (d. 1372):

> ‘He establishes His Decree (al-amr) from heaven to earth and it will return to Him’ that is to
> say, his amr comes down from the highest part of heaven to the furthest districts of the sev-
> enth earth, as He (exalted be He) has said: ‘Allah is He Who created seven Firmaments and of
> the earth a sim il ar number. Through the midst of them (all) descends His Command, (65:12)’
> And deeds rise up to their account books (i.e. each person’s actions rise to heaven where they
> are entered into one’s heavenly account), which is above the sky of the world, the distance
> between them and the earth being a journey of five hundred years and the thickness of heav-
> en is five hundred years....4
In general, however, it is not useful to turn to the later commentators for interpretations of this verse
in the context of our investigation. This is because once the doctrine of Mu˙ammad being the ‘Seal of
the Prophets’ became a firm doctrine in Islam at about the beginning of the fourth Islamic century (late
tenth century AD),5 all interpretations of verses such as this one were constrained by this doctrine and
it became increasingly difficult to offer any interpretations that that could be seen as casting doubt on
this doctrine. Since the Bahá’í interpretation of this verse does, as we shall see later, cast doubt on the
traditional Muslim interpretation of the concept of the ‘Seal of the Prophets,’ we cannot expect to find
support for it in the commentaries, except perhaps in the very earliest ones. Unfortunately, commentary

as a literary form in Islam arrived relatively late and so there is little commentary material ava il able from
the earliest period, before the concept of the ‘Seal of the Prophets’ became a firm doctrine in Islam.

3. Interpreting the Qur’án by means of the Qur’án. While the information that the dictionaries and
commentaries give is useful, for our purposes, it is probably better to adopt the classical Islamic
approach of ‘tafsír al-Qur’án bi’l-Qurán’—interpreting the Qur’án by means of the Qur’án. This is not
only because of the constraints imposed upon interpretation by later doctrine as mentioned above, but
also because the Qur’án itself is almost the only document that we can reliably state stems from this
period. And so if we want to know what a word meant at the time of the revelation of the Qur’án then
really it is only the Qur’án that can act as documentary evidence.6

The word al-amr is extensively used in the Qur’án and has a range of meanings. There are 153 occur-
rences of the word al-amr alone and in combination with various pronouns and 13 occurrences of the
plural, al-umúr, as detailed in Table 1.

Qurán al-Karím, Cairo, 1364. Although the words are given above in nom in ative form, they include
occurrences of other cases.

An analysis of these 153 references to the word amr shows that they may be divided into the two dif-
ferent mean in gs given by Lane and also according to whether the word amr relates in some way to God
or not. Such an analysis gives the following result (excluding for the time being verse 32:5):

\[84\] Lights of ‘Irfán

J.M.S. Baljon has written a paper analyzing the appearance of the word amr in the Qur’án.7 Baljon’s
main intention in this paper is to discredit the earlier notion that the word amr was equivalent to the
Christian logos concept(a Divine hypostasis. Nevertheless, Baljon makes a few points that are of interest
to our discussion. He discerns the word amr in the Qur’án as meaning several stages in the process where-
by God interacts with the world. In the first place, it relates to God’s preparation or organ iz ation of the
His decrees (yudabbiru ’l-amr); then He determines (yaq∂iya, 19:35, 39) the amr; then He sends it down to
earth (yatanazzalu, 65:12). But the descent of al-amr can be either a positive or a negative factor. For those
who have disobeyed God, such as the people of Lot, it is a fearful punishment (15:66); while for those who
are God-fearing, al-amr is an easy matter(65:4).8 It should be noted that the stage of God’s preparation of
His decree has been inserted by Baljon in order to account for the very verse that we are considering here
(Qur’án 32:5). Evidently, the statement that al-amr returns to God from earth puzzled Baljon and so in
order to account for it, he postulated an initial stage when the decree is sent to earth as an “inquiry of the
state of affairs in the world”; it then returns to God who determines the decree and it is then sent down a
second time as a decree to be executed. It can be seen that in the interpretation of this verse given below,
there is no need to postulate this initial stage of preparation because all references to the descent of al-
amr refer to the same phenomenon and the returning of it is the completion of the cycle which is, in turn,
the starting point for the next cycle. This would eliminate the need to postulate that God’s knowledge is
in some way deficient and so an initial enquiry into the state of the world is necessary. In those contexts
where amr is attributed to or effected by humans, Baljon finds the following meanings: command (20:65,
92, 94), intentions (10:72), deeds or conduct (59:15, 65:9), and religion or rites (23:55, 22:66).9

In trying to understand the meaning of the verse in question (Qur’án 32:5), we can try to find verses
in the Qur’án that most closely parallel this verse in structure and content. Thus we can see from the
verse and its context that the whole passage is referring to Divine actions. We can therefore eliminate
from our enquiry all of those 53 verses in Table 2 where the occurrence of the word amr is not related
to God. Exam in ing the remaining 99 verses, we can find several where there are structural and content
similarities to this verse.

a. ‘He establishes His Decree’. The verse that we are exam in ing (Qur’án 33:5) begins with the phrase
yudabbiru ’l-amr. This phrase occurs in several other places in the Qur’án.

> 10:3. Verily your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and is firm-
> ly established on the Throne (of authority) regulating and governing all things (yudabbiru ’l-
> amr). No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after His leave (hath been obtained). This is
> A ll ah your Lord; Him....
> 10:31. Say: “Who is it that sustains you (in life) from the sky and from the earth? Or who is it
> that has power over hearing and sight? And who is it that brings out the living from the dead
> and the dead from the liv in g? And who is it that rules and regulates all affairs (yudabbiru ’l-
> amr)?” They will soon say “A ll ah .” Say “Will ye not then show piety (to Him)?”
> 13:2. Allah is He Who ra is ed the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; is firmly estab-
> lished on the throne (of authority); He has subjected the sun and the moon (to His law)! each
> one runs (its course) for a term appointed. He doth regulate affairs (yudabbiru ’l-amr) explain-
> ing the Signs in detail that ye may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.
Here the evident meaning is God regulating and ordering the affairs of heaven and earth. Since, how-
ever, God does this regulating through the decrees that He issues, it is difficult to decide whether al-amr
here should be considered in its A or B range of mean in gs.

b. ‘His Decree from heaven to earth.’ Looking at the next part of Qur’án 32:5, it speaks of al-amr as
being something that comes down from God. If we look in the Qur’án for other occasions in which we
find al-amr coming down from God, we find:

> 16:2. He doth send down His angels with inspiration of His Command to (yunazzila al-
> malá’ikah bi’r-rú˙ min amr-hi ‘alá) such of His servants as He pleaseth (say in g): “Warn (Man)
> that there is no god but I: so do your duty unto Me.”
> 44:3–5: We sent it down (anzalná) during a blessed night: for We (ever) wish to warn (aga in s t

> Evil). In that (night) is made distinct every affair of wisdom (amrin hakímin). By a command
> (amran) from Our presence. For We (ever) send (revelations, mursilín).
> 65:12. Allah is He Who created seven Firmaments and of the earth a sim il ar number. Through
> the midst of them (all) descends His Command (yatanazzalu ’l-amr bayna -hunna): that ye may
> know that Allah has power over all things and that Allah comprehends all things in (His)
> Knowledge.
The above verses which are the closest to Qur’án 32:5 in form and content give a clear indication of
the probable meaning al-amr of 32:5. The use of verbs from the root n-z-l indicates that the process of
revelation is involved, since this is also the verbal form that is used in connection with the com in g
down of verses of the Qur’án (2:23, 97, 176; 3:3, 93; 4:136, 140, etc). This is made clearest in the first
of the above verses (16:2), where it is indicated that al-amr comes down to one of God’s servants with
the instruction to warn humanity (andh ir u). This function of being a warner is one that is tied in the
Qur’án to that of being a Messenger of God (see 5:19, 7:184, 188, 27:92, 29:50, 33:45, 34:44, 35:24, etc.).
In the second example above (44:3-5), al-amr is clearly tied to the revelation of the Qur’án. Thus the
coming down of al-amr in 33:5 appears from these parallel verses to be intimately connected with the
coming down of revelation upon a Messenger of God. It was presumably such considerations that caused
az-Zamakhsharí, in the passage quoted above, to connect al-amr with ‘the revelation (al-wahy)’ that ‘is
sent down with Gabriel (upon him be peace) from the heaven to the earth’. Further evidence for this is
the following verses, the first of which connects al-amr to the process of revelation (al-wahy, here in
the verbal form aw˙ayná) and second, more specifically links al-amr with the revelation to Moses on
the west side of Mount Sinai:

> 42:52. And thus have We by Our command sent inspiration to thee (aw˙ay-ná ilay-ka ru˙an min
> amri-ná): thou knowest not (before) what was Revelation and what was Faith; but We have made
> the (Qur’án) a Light wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will; and verily thou dost
> guide (men) to the Straight Way
> 28:44. Thou wast not on the Western Side when We decreed the commission to Moses (qa∂ayná
> ilá Músá al-amr) nor wast thou a witness (of those events).
Al-amr may thus be likened to the commission which a king or government gives to a governor or an
army officer; it is this commission which gives that person his authority and makes his authority the
equivalent of the giver of the commission. Si milar, the giving by God of al-amr to the Messenger of God
gives him the authority of God.

There is an exact parallel to verse 16:2, analyzed above, in the following verse from the Qur’án in
which al-amr is described as coming from God and where the context clearly denotes a descent. Here
again this process of the descent of al-amr is linked to the function of warning (yundh ir u), which as
indicated above is part of the function of the Messenger of God:

> 40:15. Raised high above ranks (or degrees) (He is) the Lord of the Throne (of authority): by his
> command doth He send the spirit (of inspiration) to (yulqí ar-rú˙ min amri-hi ‘alá) any of His
> servants He pleases that it may warn (men, yundh ir u) of the Day of Mutual Meeting (yawm at-
> taláq)
Finally, we can look at a large number of other occasions in the Qur’án where al-amr is stated to have
come from God to humanity. In many of these instances, the context is that of God having sent a
Messenger of God as a warner to humanity. Humankind ignores the warning and al-amr issues from God
in the form of a severe penalty. Here, al-amr can be translated as the ‘decree’ or ‘command’ of God. The
whole of the Súrah of Húd in the Qur’án consists of instance after instance of this usage. In almost every
case the word al-amr is used in conjunction with the verb já’a.- al-amr came or issued forth. The first
instance cited is that of Noah who is described as being sent as a warner (nadhírun) to his people. They
refused to believe in Noah and his message, nor did they help him with his Ark, until:

> 11:40. At length behold! there came Our Command (já’a amru-ná) and the fountains of the
> earth gushed forth!

\[86\] Lights of ‘Irfán

> 11:43. The son replied: “I will be take myself to some mountain: it will save me from the
> water.” Noah said: “This day nothing can save from the Command of Allah (amri Alláh) any
> but those on whom He hath mercy!” and the waves came between them and the son was among
> those overwhelmed in the Flood.
The destruction continued until the waters abated and al-amr was ended:

> 11:44. When the word went forth: “O earth! swallow up thy water and O sky! withhold (thy
> rain)!” and the water abated and the matter (al-amr) was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi
> and the word went forth: “Away with those who do wrong!”
Si milarly, Húd was sent to the people of ‘Ád and ßáli˙ was sent to the people of Thamúd to warn them,
but they ignored them and then:

> 11:58. So when Our decree issued (já’a amru-ná) We saved Húd and those who believed with
> him by (special) Grace from Ourselves: We saved them from a severe Penalty.
> 11:66. When Our Decree (já’a amru-ná) issued We saved Saleh and those who believed with him
> by (special) Grace from Ourselves and from the Ignominy of that Day. For thy Lord He is the
> Strong One and Able to enforce His Will.
Next mention is made of Abraham. Abraham pleads with God against the penalty that was to be
imposed upon the people of Lot:

> 11:76. O Abraham! seek not this. The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth (já’a amru Rabbi-ka):
> for them there cometh a Penalty that cannot be turned back!
> 11:82. When Our decree issued (já’a amru-ná) We turned (the cities) upside down and ra in ed
> down on them brimstones hard as baked clay spread layer on layer...
The Súrah of Húd then reviews the fate of the people of Madyán, to whom Shu‘ayb was sent:

> 11:94. When Our decree issued (já’a amru-ná) We saved Shuaib and those who believed with
> him by (special) Mercy from Ourselves: but the (mighty) Blast did seize the wrongdoers and
> they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning...
In reviewing all of these cases, the text of the Súrah of Húd states:

> 11:101. It was not We that wronged them: they wronged their own souls: the deities other than
> A ll ah whom they invoked profited them no whit when there issued the decree of thy Lord (já’a
> amra Rabbi-ka): nor did they add aught (to their lot) but perdition!
Other examples of this usage of al-amr are:

> 16:33. Do the (ungodly) wait until the angels come to them or there comes the Command of
> thy Lord (for their doom, aw ya’tiya amra rabbi-ka)? So did those who went before them. But
> A ll ah wronged them not: nay they wronged their own souls.
> 57:14. (Those without) will call out “were we not with you?” (The others) will reply “True! but
> ye led yourselves into temptation; ye looked forward (to our ruin); ye doubted (Allah’s promise);
> and (your false) desires deceived you; until there issued the Command of Allah (˙attá já’a amr
> alláh). And the Deceiver deceived you in respect of Allah.
Thus these examples and the whole of the Súrah of Húd bears witness to this meaning of al-amr—that
it represents the decree of God imposing a severe penalty on those who fail to obey the Messenger of
God when he comes.

c. ‘and it will return to Him.’ Continuing with our analysis of verse 33:5, we go on to the next phrase
which refers to al-amr returning to God (thumma ya‘ruju ilay-hi). The verse that come closest in parallel-
ing this is also of great interest because it is the last verse of the Súrah of Húd, which, as demonstrated
above, is full of references to al-amr as the decree coming from God and penalising those who oppose
the Messengers of God. Here, at the end of this Súrah, we see that al-amr returns to God.

> 11:123. To Allah do belong the unseen (secrets) of the heavens and the earth and to Him goeth
> back every affair (wa ilay-hi yurja‘u al-amr kull-hu): then worship Him and put thy trust in
> Him: and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do.
There are several other verses in the Qur’án that have some sim il ar i ties but in each case what is record-
ed as going back to God is al-umúr, the plural of al-amr.10

d. ‘in a Day.’ Verse 40:15, quoted above and also the contents of the Súrah of Húd, described above,
> have important implications also when we come to consider the next two words of Qur’án 33:5—‘in a Day,’
> (fí yawmin). We have seen how in the Súrah of Húd, whenever the people turned away from the Messenger
> of God, a severe penalty was visited upon them. In two verses of this súrah, it is implied that this fate
> that befell them was their Day of Judgement. In both of these verses, however, Yusuf Ali and other trans-
> lators have changed things somewhat to make it appear that the reference to a Day of Judgement is to a
future event. In reference to ‘Ád’s rejection of their Messenger of God, Húd, Yususf Ali translates:

> 11:60. And they were pursued by a Curse in this Life and on the Day of Judgment. Ah! behold!
> for the ‘Ad rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! behold! removed (from sight) were ‘Ad the
> people of Húd!
And sim il arly in relation to the rejection of Moses by Pharaoh and his people, Yusuf Ali translates:

> 11:99. And they are followed by a curse in this (life) and on the Day of Judgment: and woeful
> is the gift which shall be given (unto them)!
The literal word for word translation of the opening words of both of these verses is, however (the only
difference between the two is that the word ad-dunyá appears in 11:60 and not in 11:99):
Wa utbi‘ú fí hádhihi [ad-dunyá] la‘nah wa yawm al-qiyámah

> And they were followed in this [world] by a curse and the Day of Judgement (actually probably
> more accurately translated as Day of Resurrection)
> Thus the Arabic text places ‘curse’ and ‘Day of Judgement’ side-by-side as that by which the
> people were pursued—the tense being the past tense. In other words, it regards what happened
> to the people of ‘Ád and the people of Pharaoh as being the Day of Judgement for them. This
> would support az-Zamakhsharí in his assertion that the Day that is referred to in 33:5 is the
> Day of Judgement (see above). This then takes us back to Qur’án 40:15, which links the com-
> ing of al-amr from God to earth with the coming of a revelation to a Messenger of God and
> to the Day of Mutual Meeting. Az-Zamakhsharí, in his commentary on verse 40:15, states that
> the Day of Mutual Meeting is the same as the Day of Judgement and other commentaries
> agree.11
> 40:15. Raised high above ranks (or degrees) (He is) the Lord of the Throne (of authority): by his
> command doth He send the spirit (of inspiration) to (yulqí ar-rú˙ min amri-hi ‘alá) any of His
> servants He pleases that it may warn (men, yundh ir u) of the Day of Mutual Meeting (yawm at-
> taláq)
e. ‘the length of which is one thousand years in your reckon in g’. The next phrase in 33:5—the length
> of which is one thousand years in your reckoning—has one close parallel in the Qur’án. Interestingly, this
> parallel passage can be considered as a summary of the Súrah of Húd that we have already discussed at
length:

> 22:42-7: If they treat thy (mission) as false so did the Peoples before them (with their prophets)
> the People of Noah and ‘Ad and Thamud; Those of Abraham and Lut; And the Companions of
> the Madyan people: and Moses was rejected (in the same way). But I granted respite to the
> Unbelievers and (only) after that did I punish them: but how (terrible) was My rejection (of
> them)! How many populations have We destroyed which were given to wrong-doing! They tum-
> bled down on their roofs. And how many wells are lying idle and neglected and castles lofty
> and well-built! Do they not travel through the land so that their hearts (and mind) may thus
> learn wisdom and their ears may thus learn to hear? Truly it is not their eyes that are blind but

\[88\] Lights of ‘Irfán

> their hearts which are in their breasts. Yet they ask thee to hasten on the Punishment! But
> A ll ah will not fail in His promise. Verily a day in the sight of thy Lord is like a thousand years
> of your reckoning.
> Here the period of one thousand years is closely linked to a future day of punishment. In other
> words the same overall scheme as is suggested in az-Zamakhsharí’s commentary is confirmed—
> that the Day that is mentioned is the Day of Judgement and this is linked to a one thousand
> year period.
> 4. The Collections of Traditions. While it is true, as stated above, that there are few other
> sources that we can consult that reliably contain usage of Arabic words contemporaneous to the
> Qur’an, it is useful to look also at the collections of Prophetic Traditions. Although these were
> not written down until 150 years or more after the time of the Qur’án and doubts have been

> we can find a number of these Traditions where the word al-amr is used in a way that sheds
> light on its use in Qur’án 33:5.
> In the collection by al-Bukhárí, which is one of two collections that have been given the name
> as-ßa˙í˙ (the correct) by Muslims on account of their reputation for authenticity, the follow in g
> two Traditions occur which generally support the above interpretations of al-amr:
> God brings about whatever he wishes of His amr.12
> God says: The son of Adam hurts me when he curses Time (ad-Dahr), for I am Time; in my
> hands is al-amr and I cause the revolution of night and day.13
By far the most interesting of these is a Tradition that occurs in slightly varying forms in almost all
of the major collections of Traditions, including al-Bukhárí, Muslim, Ibn Májah, and at-Tirmidhí. The
following is the form in which it is recorded by Ibn Óanbal:

The Messenger of God (PBUH) said: A group of my followers will continue victorious upon the path
of truth and they will not be harmed by those who desert them until the amr of God shall come.14

This Tradition seems to be the natural corollary of Qur’án 33:5, stating that in future, after al-amr
returns to God, it will come once again to earth.

5. Ancient Arabic poetry. It is customary for Islamicists in considering the meaning of words in the
Qur’án to turn to ancient Arabic poetry for clues. Although the authenticity and exact relationship of
this poetry to the Arabic of the Qur’án is a matter of some dispute, it cannot be denied that, whether
genuinely pre-Islamic or written after the advent of Islam, it is some of the closest literature to the
Qur’án in time that is ava il able to us.

There are several instances where there are close parallels between the Qur’ánic use of amr and that
of ancient Arabic poetry. Umayya ibn Abí’ß-ßalt, for example writes in one of his poems of the King of
Heaven and His angels who are elected for His amr and descend to earth with it and ascend aga in .15

The idea that at some time in the future, al-amr of God will descend again and that this is the Day of
Judgement finds strong contemporary support in the poetry of Óassán ibn Thábit, a Muslim poet who
was a companion of the Prophet Mu˙ammad. He wrote:
That the amr of God may descend upon us hastily this very night or tomorrow

Then we shall stand in the [Last] Hour and participate in the pure good16
6. Summary. In summary then, we can say that on the basis of a survey of other parallel passages in
the Qur’án and taking into account the early commentators such as az-Zamakhsharí and al-Bay∂áwí, the
collections of Traditions, and ancient Arabic poetry, the meaning of verse 33:5 can be reconstructed thus:

> He establishes (yudabbiru): establishes, organizes, orders,
> His Decree (al-amr): command, decree of God

- that which God send down with the angel (especially the Angel Gabriel) as a revelation (al-wahy) to
the Messenger of God

- the commission which God gives to the Messenger of God, charging him with a mission on earth
- the decree of God ordaining a severe pun is hment for people who have ignored or opposed the
Messenger of God

from heaven to earth (min as-samá’ ilá ’l-ar∂): this appears to function as an equivalent of a verb from
the root nazala (coming down, descent, revelation) which is used in the Qur’án to describe the revela-
tion of verses to the Messengers of God

and it will return to Him (thumma ya‘ruju ilay-hi)—al-amr—the decree or commission delegated to the
Messenger of God—returns to God

in a Day (fí yawmin)—this Day is the Day of Judgement—on which the previous amr returns to God
and a new decree is issued—a new amr comes

the length of which is one thousand years in your reckoning (kána miqdár-hu alf sinah min má
ta‘uddún)—the duration of time in which the decree is in effect before its return to God is completed is
a period of one thousand human years. Each of these is a Day of God—a Day of Judgement

7. The Bahá’í Interpretation. The discussion above has yielded a number of possible interpretations of
the word al-amr in Qur’án 33:5. Two of these appear to be very different from one another: the revela-
tion or commission that is given to a Messenger of God and the penalty imposed by God upon a peo-
ple when they reject a Messenger of God. It is interesting to note that the Bahá’í interpretation of al-
amr in Qur’án 33:5 has the ability to link these two mean in gs so as to refer to one event. The Bahá’í
interpretation of this verse would be that it refers to the coming of a Messenger of God one thousand
years after the Islamic revelation. In the Bahá’í interpretation, the coming of any Messenger of God is
a Day of Judgement, for the followers of the previous religions. It is their Day of Judgement to see if
they have been faithful to the teachings of the previous Messenger of God. If they fail this test and do
not accept these teac h in gs then God sends down upon them a severe penalty or chastisement. The day
of judgement is also called the Day of Resurrection (because those who believe are spiritually revital-
ized) and the Day of God. Thus, in the Bahá’í interpretation, both of the interpretations of al-amr,
whether as revelation/mission or as penalty/Day of Judgement, refer to the same phenomenon, the com-
ing of the Messenger of God.

The Bahá’í interpretation of this verse is thus that God sent down from heaven the revelation to the
Prophet Mu˙ammad. This was also the Day of God, the Day of Judgement, for the followers of previ-
ous religions such as Christianity and Judaism. As they fa il ed to respond to Mu˙ammad’s message, they
suffered a severe penalty. The Islamic Day of Judgement lasted one thousand years. Since Bahá’ís accept
the Shi‘i account of the true nature of authority after the Prophet Mu˙ammad, this one thousand year
period began in AH 260, with the occultation of the Twelfth Imam, at which time, authoritative, div in e-
ly-guided interpretation of the Islamic revelation was ended. After one thousand years, in AH 1260 (AD
1844), the period in which the Divine commission (al-amr) was entrusted to the Prophet Mu˙ammad
ended and al-amr returned to God. In 1844, God once more sent Divine revelation to earth, once more,
through the Báb.

B. Al-Amr in Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-ˆqán
The Kitáb-i-ˆqán is one of Bahá’u’lláh’s early works from the Baghdad period. It was written in
response to a number of questions posed by one of the maternal uncles of the Báb regarding why the
signs accompanying the coming of the Mahdí did not appear to have been fulfilled with the coming of
the Báb.

At one point in the is work, Bahá’u’lláh refers to his two-year sojourn in the mountains around
Sulaymáníyyih in Kurd is tan. Dealing then with his return from that self-imposed exile, he states that,
although he himself had no thought of return, the command for this issued from maßdar-i-amr and so
he returned. E.G. Browne has argued that this reference to maßdar-i-amr in fact indicates that Bahá’u’lláh

\[90\] Lights of ‘Irfán

at this date still deferred to Azal as leader of the Bábí movement. Shoghi Effendi has translated maßdar-
i-amr as “the Mystic Source.”

In the early days of Our arrival in this land, when We discerned the signs of impending events, We
decided, ere they happened, to retire. We betook Ourselves to the wilderness, and there, separated and
alone, led for two years a life of complete solitude.... Many a night We had no food for sustenance, and
many a day Our body found no rest. By Him Who hath My being between His hands! notwithstand in g
these showers of afflictions and unceasing calamities, Our soul was wrapt in bl is sful joy, and Our whole
being evinced an ineffable gladness.... Our withdrawal contemplated no return, and Our separation
hoped for no reunion. The one object of Our retirement was to avoid becoming a subject of discord
among the faithful, a source of disturbance unto Our companions, the means of injury to any soul, or
the cause of sorrow to any heart. Beyond these, We cherished no other intention, and apart from them,
We had no end in view. And yet, each person schemed after his own desire, and pursued his own idle
fancy, until the hour when, from the Mystic Source, there came the summons bidding Us return whence
We came. Surrendering Our will to His, We submitted to His injunction. (B ah a’u’llah: The Kitáb-i-ˆqán,
pages 250–251)

In order to clear this matter up, it is clearly necessary to examine Bahá’u’lláh’s use of the word amr in
detail particularly his use of the word in the ˆqán itself since it is conceivable that Bahá’u’lláh’s usage of
the word may have changed over the years. I have looked at 154 instances of the noun amr in the Kitáb-
i-ˆqán. The details of these instances are to be found in Table 3.
Table 3: Occurrences of the Noun Amr in the Kitáb-Iqán.

> Total                         154

In looking at the meaning of the word amr in this context, it is necessary to add a meaning which is
additional to those derived above from Lane’s Dictionary, but which has already been discovered in our
consideration of the Qur’ánic meaning of this word. Most frequently in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, al-
amr means the mission given to the Messenger or Manifestation of God. Thus amr Alláh means the
Cause of God, or the commission given by God to the Messenger of God. This meaning is closely linked
to the decree, command, order range of meanings of amr, and may be considered as part of that group
but it has been given separately in Table 4 for clarity.

Unfortunately the phrase maßdar-i amr does not appear elsewhere in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán and so this can-
not be used directly to derive the mean in g. The word maßdar is the noun of place (nomina loci) derived
from the verb ßadara, which means to go out, issue forth, originate or emanate. Maßdar thus comes to
mean: point of origin, source, or origin. It is clear that with the preceding word, maßdar, the word amr
in this context is more likely to have either meaning A or C from Table 4, rather than meaning B. Table
4 indicates that the most likely meaning for amr in this context is that it means the “Divine commis-

sion or Cause.” The following are a few examples of its use in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán that demonstrate this
meaning of the “Divine commission or Cause.”

> Moreover, the more closely you observe the denials of those who have opposed the
> Manifestations of the divine attributes, the firmer will be your faith in the Cause of God [dar
> dín-i khud va amr Alláh mu˙kamtar va rasikhtar shavíd]. (ˆqán, p. 6)
> When He was invested with the robe of Prophethood, and was moved by the Spirit of God to
> arise and proclaim His Cause [bar amr qiyám farmúd], whoever believed in Him and acknowl-
> edged His Faith, was endowed with the grace of a new life. (ˆqán, p. 154)
> Among the utterances that foreshadow a new Law and a new Revelation [shar‘-i jadíd va amr-i
> badí‘] are the passages in the “Prayer of Nudbih....” (ˆqán, p. 240)

Total                                                          154

Thus, maßdar-i amr is most likely to mean the “Source of the Divine commission or Cause.” Since the
“the Divine commission or Cause” can only come from God through a Manifestation of God, the
“Source” referred to can only be either God or the Manifestation of God. Indeed with the frequent recur-
rence (ten occasions in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán) of the phrase amr Alláh, the Cause of God, it becomes clear that
the Source of amr is most likely to be God. In the circumstances surrounding the writing of the Kitáb-
i-ˆqán in Baghdad, the meaning that E.G. Browne tries to give to this phrase thus becomes very unlike-
ly. In speaking of the Source of Command, Bahá’u’lláh could only really be speaking about God or pos-
sibly about a Manifestation of God. The Báb had previously been martyred in 1850 and Azal was not at
this time claiming to be a Manifestation of God. Indeed the claim to be a manifestation of God equat-
ed within the Bábí context to a claim to be Man YuΩ h ir uhu’lláh—He whom God shall make manifest,
which Azal did not claim during this Baghdad period. Later during the Edirne period, it seems that he
briefly put forward such a claim in response to Bahá’u’lláh’s open proclamation of his claim,17 but it does
not appear to have been accepted by any substantial group of people and seems to have later been with-
drawn, as Browne does not report any such claim on the part of Azal during the period of his contacts
with him. Thus in the context of the Baghdad period, this leaves only the interpretation of this phrase
as a reference to God. Bahá’u’lláh is in effect saying that the cause of his return to Baghdad was a Div in e
summons.

One further approach to elucidating this issue which helps us to a certain extent is to look for
other occasions where the term maßdar-i amr appears in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh. I have only been
able to trace a few other instances of the use of this term and none of these can be def in i tely stated
to belong to the Baghdad period of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. In the first of these, the context makes it
more likely that God is meant, in the second and third, the Manifestation of God appears to be
intended.

> Bounteous, and were addressed to Siyyid Javád, known as Karbilá’í. (Epistle to the Son of the

\[92\] Lights of ‘Irfán

> I yield Thee thanks that Thou hast made known unto me Him Who is the Day-Spring of Thy
> mercy, and the Daw n in g-Place of Thy grace, and the Repository of Thy Cause (maßdar amri-ka).
> (Prayers and Meditations, no. 137, p. 225)
> ...in such wise that the changes and chances of the world will be powerless to hinder me from
> recognizing Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine own Self, and the Revealer of Thy signs,
> and the Day-Spring of Thy Revelation, and the Repository of Thy Cause (maßdar amri-ka).

(Prayers and Meditations, no. 139, p. 228)
There are also two occurrences of similar terms that are worth noting here. The first has the word
maßdar (maßádir) in the plural and clearly refers to the Manifestations of God:

> They, verily, are the manifestations of the power of God, and the sources of His authority
> (masádir-i amr), and the repositories of His knowledge, and the daysprings of His command-
> ments. (Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 90)
The second has the word amr in the plural. Since the form of the plural is awámir, this confirms that
in this phrase, maßdar-i amr, the word amr is present in its meaning of decree, command, order (i.e.
mean in gs A or C in Table 4 above; since it is the plural for this range of mean in gs that is awámir). This
passage is from the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, the last major work of Bahá’u’lláh. Here, Bahá’u’lláh
is challenging Shaykh Mu˙ammad-Taqí the recipient of this epistle, to go to Cyprus and meet Mírzá
Ya˙yá and ascertain for himself the truth of the matter—that Mírzá Ya˙ya is not “the source of the
Divine laws” (maßdar-i awámir):

> In this day, this Wronged One requesteth thee and the other divines who have drunk of the
> cup of the knowledge of God, and are illum in ed by the shining words of the Day-Star of
> Justice, to appoint some person, without informing any one, and despatch him to these
> regions, and enable him to remain a while in the island of Cyprus, and associate with Mirza
> Yahya, perchance he may become aware of the fundamentals of this Faith and of the source of
> the Divine laws (maßdar-i awámir) and commandments. (Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p.

120–21)
Perhaps more pertinent than these examples however, is the occurrence of a variant of maßdar-i-amr
in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán itself. This the phrase maßádir-i amriyyih, which appears in the following context:

> Know verily that the purpose underlying all these symbolic terms and abstruse allusions,
> which emanate from the Revealers of God’s holy Cause (maßádir-i amriyyih), hath been to test
> and prove the peoples of the world. (ˆqán p. 49)
Here again the word maßdar is in its plural form while instead of the genitive construct, the word amr
appears in adjectival form as amriyyih. Here again, it seems clear from the context that the
Manifestations of God are meant.

In summary, this an al ysis shows that the term maßdar-i-amr is always used with the meaning of amr
relating the word to “Divine decree, command or commission.” The word maßdar means source or ori-
gin. Thus the phrase masdar-i-amr cannot have a meaning related to earthly leadership or even the lead-
ership of a religious movement, such as Azal claimed. The “source of the Divine command or decree”
can only be God or a Manifestation of God who has been given the authority (amr) to carry out the
decree of God. Azal was not claiming any such station at this time and thus Browne understanding of
this phrase in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán is incorrect. It was in fact an assertion by Bahá’u’lláh that he returned
from Sulaymáníyyih in response to a Divine summons.
