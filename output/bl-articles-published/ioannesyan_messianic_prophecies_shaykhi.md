Reflections on Some Messianic Prophecies in

Shaykhi Works

Y. A. Ioannesyan*

While working on a Russian translation from the original
Persian of Siyyid Kázim’s treatise “Usul-i-‘Aqá’id” (“The Basic
Principles of Belief”), 1 I noticed certain correspondences
between the messianic prophecy Siyyid Kázim quotes and the
time periods, dates and names related to the Bábí and Bahá’í
Faiths symbolically expressed. The prophecy in question is
actually a passage within a broader account of eschatological
events described in Chapter 5 of Siyyid Kázim’s treatise.2
When I realized that this whole chapter was in fact Siyyid
Kázim’s Persian translation of the corresponding part
(Chapter 5) of Shaykh Ahmad’s “Hayát al-Nafs” (“The Life of
the Soul”) — for some miraculous reason incorporated into
Siyyid Kázim’s work — I turned my attention to Shaykh
Ahmad’s “Hayát al-Nafs” in Arabic.3 Studying this part of the
“Hayát al-Nafs” only reinforced my previous impression of the
correspondences between the prophecy concerned and Bábí and
Bahá’í history, as such correspondences became even more
apparent to me in the Arabic text. The sources for this study
are from the collection of the St. Petersburg Institute of
Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences (“the
Hayát al-Nafs”, manuscripts: А 706, B 4276, B 1895,4 its Persian
translation by Siyyid Kázim, lithograph: Pk 213, and the “Usul-
i-’Aqá’id,” lithograph: Ps II 157).5

The present writer is well aware of the skeptical attitude of
some people, especially scholars, towards prophecy. By sharing

my ideas, I have not the least intention of trying to convince
skeptics of the significance of prophecy, and even less so of the
validity of my interpretations. This is only an attempt to trace
and highlight correspondences which, in my view, exist between
the dates and facts symbolically referred to in the prophecy and
the events of Bábí and Bahá’í history. Obviously, the suggested
interpretation is not authoritative.

Since the language of prophecy is symbolic, it would be
useful to first consider its characteristics. Though in the works
available to me this language is mostly treated in relation to
revealed Scripture, it is relevant to approach it as a general
phenomenon, assuming that its basic features must apply to
the symbolic language of traditions as well. The
mathematician-philosopher William S. Hatcher defines it as a
“metaphorical, extramathematical language.”6 Concerning the
differences between this language and the language of science,
he writes:

> The language of science is deliberately linear —
> eschewing metaphor and multiple meaning — and
> minimalist — accepting the objective existence of only
> those nonobservables strictly necessary to an
> explanation of observable configurations (which, as it
> turns out, is still quite a bit). Thus, the strengths of
> science are clarity, precision, and applicability
> (practicality). Its limitations derive primarily from its
> partialness (specialization, fragmentation), relative
> incomple-teness, and general lack of a global vision…
> In contrast to the language of science, the language of
> revelation is nonlinear (extensive use of metaphor and
> multiple meaning) and maximalist (as rich as possible,
> freely referring to nonobservables)... Thus, the
> strengths of revelation are its adequacy and its
> completeness, but its limitations (from the human
> point of view) lie in its complexity and the consequent
> frequent lack of an obvious linear meaning for a given
> portion of the revelatory text. The student of
> revelation must be prepared to struggle to understand
> the different levels of meaning enfolded in the
> revelation. 7

Hatcher amplifies his analysis of these differences by the
following point:

> Mathematical language puts a premium on exactness
> and precision of expression. Ideally, a mathematical
> language is totally formalizable in such manner that
> every grammatically well-formed expression has only
> one logical meaning. In this sense, mathematical
> language is linear: text (syntax) is already linear, and if
> we avoid metaphor and multiple meaning in our
> lexicon, then our semantics will also be linear. In this
> case, each syntactical sign is its own meaning. It is
> precisely such totally linearized languages that are used,
> for example, in computer programming.8
To summarize Hatcher’s viewpoint: the language of science
in which every expression or sign has only one logical meaning
is linear. It is characterized by clarity and precision. On the
contrary, symbolic language, in which an expression has
multiple meaning, is non-linear. It is characterized by
metaphor and complexity. It would be relevant to add that one
of the definitions of the term “linear” is “having only one
dimension.” Regarding problems of interpreting the symbolic
language of prophecy Michael Sours says the following:

> Some people argue that prophecies must be fulfilled
> exactly in every detail, but examples of prophetic
> fulfillment in the Bible show that this is not the case…
> This is not to say that the details of prophecy are not
> important. Sometimes these details raise issues that
> help clarify the nature of fulfillment, but in many
> instances the details are intended to make the message
> relevant to the time when the prophecy was first
> revealed…
> In the Book of Certitude, Bahá’u’lláh teaches that
> Scripture is written in two kinds of language, one
> ‘unconcealed and unveiled’ so ‘that it may be a guiding
> lamp and a beaconing lamp’ and another that is ‘veiled
> and concealed, so that whatever lieth hidden in the
> heart of the malevolent may be made manifest and their
> innermost being be disclosed’...9

> To perceive the concealed meaning of prophecy one
> must acknowledge the symbolic nature and spiritual
> significance of the words used. If prophecy is
> interpreted literally, and it is imagined that such events
> will literally happen, then one may expect a truly
> extraordinary sign and proof that requires little or no
> spiritual discernment to recognize and acknowledge
> it.10
On the multiple meaning of prophecy Sours says:

> …some prophecies may be both literal and symbolic. In
> most cases, however, prophecy is symbolic…Many
> verses in Scripture can have several meanings. In
> connection with the interpretation of Scripture and
> sacred traditions, Bahá’u’lláh cites a saying of Imám
> Sádiq…: ‘We speak one word, and by it we intend one
> and seventy meanings’…11 Nevertheless, although there
> may be many meanings in a verse of Scripture, it is
> important not to confuse significant meanings with
> any meaning. 12
A good example of how the days referred to in the context of
the same prophecy may have to be reckoned differently is best
illustrated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s interpretation of a Zoroastrian
prophecy of which Shoghi Effendi wrote:

> As a further testimony to the greatness of the
> Revelation identified with Bahá’u’lláh may be cited the
> following extracts from a Tablet addressed by ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá to an eminent Zoroastrian follower of the Faith:
> “Thou hadst written that in the sacred books of the
> followers of Zoroaster it is written that in the latter
> days, in three separate Dispensations, the sun must
> needs be brought to a standstill. In the first
> Dispensation, it is predicted, the sun will remain
> motionless for ten days; in the second for twice that
> time; in the third for no less than one whole month. The
> interpretation of this prophecy is this: the first
> Dispensation to which it refers is the Muhammadan
> Dispensation during which the Sun of Truth stood still
> for ten days. Each day is reckoned as one century. The
> Muhammadan Dispensation must have, therefore,

> lasted no less than one thousand years, which is
> precisely the period that has elapsed from the setting of
> the Star of the Imamate to the advent of the
> Dispensation proclaimed by the Báb. The second
> Dispensation referred to in this prophecy is the one
> inaugurated by the Báb Himself, which began in the
> year 1260 AH and was brought to a close in the year
> 1280 AH As to the third Dispensation — the Revelation
> proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh — inasmuch as the Sun of
> Truth when attaining that station shineth in the
> plenitude of its meridian splendor its duration hath
> been fixed for a period of one whole month, which is
> the maximum time taken by the sun to pass through a
> sign of the Zodiac. From this thou canst imagine the
> magnitude of the Bahá’í cycle — a cycle that must
> extend over a period of at least five hundred thousand
> years.13
In a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada,
the differentiated method of interpreting time periods
employed for this prophecy is explained in the following way:

> Concerning the passage in the Dispensation of
> Bahá’u’lláh in which the Guardian quotes ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá's interpretation of the prophecy referring to the
> times when the sun would stand still in the heavens, he
> wishes me to explain that the days referred to in this
> prophecy have to be reckoned differently. In the
> Scripture of various religions there are to be found
> frequent references to days, but these have been
> considered as indicating different period of time, as
> for instance in the Qur’án a day is reckoned as one
> thousand years. The first ten days in the above
> mentioned prophecy represent each a century, making
> thus a total of one thousand lunar years. As to the
> twenty days referring to the Bábí Dispensation each of
> them represents only one lunar year, the total of twenty
> years marking the duration of the Revelation of the
> Báb. The thirty days in the last dispensation should not
> be reckoned numerically, but should be considered as
> symbolizing the incomparable greatness of the Bahá’í
26                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

> Revelation which, though not final is none-the-less thus
> far the fullest revelation of God to man. From a
> physical point of view, the thirty days represent the
> maximum time takes by the sun to pass through a sign
> of the zodiac. They thus represent a culminating point
> in the evolution of this star. So also from a spiritual
> standpoint these thirty days should be viewed as
> indicating the highest, though not the final stage in the
> spiritual evolution of mankind.14
The above interpretation is based on three different
approaches to the calculation of days within the same prophecy
and clearly indicates that interpretation does not necessarily
require a uniform approach to all parts of a text. The
application of different systems of reckoning should not be
confused with the inconsistency of method detracting from its
validity. Rather, it should be seen as a differentiated approach.

Shaykh Ahmad and Siyyid Kázim present the messianic
prophecy to be considered here in relation to the eschatological
concept of “return” (raj‘a/raj‘at), traditionally understood in
Shi’ih Islam as the return of the Prophet Muhammad and the
twelve Imáms, including the “Hidden Imám,” known as the
Qá’im. The Bahá’í notion of the “return” is best expounded by
the Prophet-Founder of the Bahá’í Faith in His Book of
Certitude:

> Strive therefore to comprehend the meaning of “return”
> which hath been so explicitly revealed in the Qur'án
> itself, and which none hath as yet understood. What
> sayest thou? If thou sayest that Muhammad was the
> “return” of the Prophets of old, as is witnessed by this
> verse, His Companions must likewise be the “return” of
> the bygone Companions, even as the “return” of the
> former people is clearly attested by the text of the
> above-mentioned verses…
> Wherefore, should one of these Manifestations of
> Holiness proclaim saying: “I am the return of all the
> Prophets,” He verily speaketh the truth. In like manner,
> in every subsequent Revelation, the return of the
> former Revelation is a fact, the truth of which is firmly
> established. Inasmuch as the return of the Prophets of
Messianic Prophecies in Shaykhi Works                          27

> God, as attested by verses and traditions, hath been
> conclusively demonstrated, the return of their chosen
> ones also is therefore definitely proven…
> Therefore, those who in every subsequent Dispensation
> preceded the rest of mankind in embracing the Faith of
> God, who quaffed the clear waters of knowledge at the
> hand of the divine Beauty, and attained the loftiest
> summits of faith and certitude, these can be regarded,
> in name, in reality, in deeds, in words, and in rank, as
> the “return” of those who in a former Dispensation had
> achieved similar distinctions…
> From these statements therefore it hath been made
> evident and manifest that should a Soul in the “End
> that knoweth no end” be made manifest, and arise to
> proclaim and uphold a Cause which in “the Beginning
> that hath no beginning” another Soul had proclaimed
> and upheld, it can be truly declared of Him Who is the
> Last and of Him Who was the First that they are one
> and the same, inasmuch as both are the Exponents of
> one and the same Cause…15
Thus, the “return” in the Bahá’í Faith is understood
allegorically. Bahá’u’lláh is identified with the Imám Husayn
“returned,” not in the sense of His being the return of the same
person. 16 Interestingly, there is even a correspondence between
their names. Bahá’u’lláh’s name is Husayn-‘Alí, while that of
Imám Husayn was Husayn b. ‘Alí. Accordingly, the Báb, whose
name was ‘Alí-Muhammad, is identified with the Qá’im. 17

The prophecy we are going to discuss falls into the category
of eschatological accounts which provide clues to the time
frame within which the events relating to the messianic
figure/figures are going to happen as well as to the
circumstances of these events. Sours refers to such prophecies
in the following passage:

> Many prophecies, rather than offering direct and
> explicit evidence that Bahá’u’lláh is a Manifestation of
> God, provide clues relating to the circumstances of His
> life and the age in which He was destined to appear. In
> many instances, it is only by first recognizing the

Now I will quote the corresponding part of the Hayát al-

available in the collection of the St. Petersburg Institute of

Of special note is the fact that the two other manuscripts are
even more specific. They both have “from/since them” referring
to the “seventy years”:

A correlating prophecy is quoted by Siyyid Kázim-i-Rashtí in
his “Risáliy-i-Bahbahániyyih.” For convenience’ sake, we can
refer to it as “prophesy 2” and to the prophesy from “Hayát al-
Nafs” as “prophesy 1”. In the aforementioned work Siyyid
Kázim states:

> ‫ﻭﯼﻁﻩّﺭ ﺍﻝﺃﺭﺽ ﺏﺱﯼﻑ ﻕﺍﺉﻡﻩﻡ ﺭﻭﺡﯼ ﻑﺩﺍﻩ ﻑﺏﻉﺩ ﺫﻝﮎ ﯼﺭﺝﻉﻭﻥ ﺍﻝﯼ ﺍﻝﺩّﻥﯼﺍ‬

Since we are not concerned in this paper with linguistics or
mathematics, and, given the fact that the language of prophecy

is symbolic and non-linear rather than scientific, it would be
proper to consider also that “fifty-nine” sounds in Arabic as
“nine and fifty”. Thus, in a more literal translation (of
numbers), the passage from prophesy 1 will appear in the
following way:

> The duration of His kingdom is seven years. God
> prolongs the days and nights…Thus the duration of His
> kingdom [will be] seventy years…And when nine and
> fifty years pass/elapse from/since them Husayn…will
> come forth.
The key phrase from prophesy 2 will assume the following
form:

> …The first of them to return nine and fifty years after
> the Qá’im…is Husayn b. ‘Ali…
All the numbers in the passages from both prophesies are
significant with respect to periods and dates in Bábí and Bahá’í
history. Leaving alone number 50 for the time being, let us
consider seven, nine, and 70. The Báb was martyred during the
seventh year of His mission (which corresponds to the end of
“the Qá’im’s kingdom” in symbolic language). Shoghi Effendi
writes: “On the evening of the very day of the Báb’s execution,
which fell on the ninth of July 1850 (28th of Sha‘bán 1266 AH),
during the thirty-first year of His age and the seventh of His
ministry…”24

Getting back to prophesy 2 (see above), if we add nine to the
year 1260 AH (the year of the Báb’s declaration, i.e., the “rising
of the Qá’im for His mission”) we will come to 1269 AH — i.e.,
the time when Bahá’u’lláh (Husayn-‘Alí) first received His
revelation in the Siyáh-Chál prison. Referring to this event
Shoghi Effendi points out:

> During nine years, as foretold by the Báb Himself,
> swiftly, mysteriously and irresistibly the embryonic
> Faith conceived by Him had been developing until, at
> the fixed hour, the burden of the promised Cause of
> God was cast amidst the gloom and agony of the Siyáh-
> Chál of Tihrán…His25 imprisonment lasted for a period
> of no less than four months, in the middle of which the

> “year nine” (1269), anticipated in such glowing terms
> by the Bab, and alluded to as the year “after Hin” by
> Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá’í, was ushered in, endowing with
> undreamt-of potentialities the whole world.26
Thus, the numbers seven and nine should be understood
literally, as they perfectly match the historic periods. But if we
look further into the passage from prophecy 1, we may discover
that it contains more information than it appears: “the
duration of His kingdom [will be] seventy years…And when
nine…years pass/elapse from/since then Husayn…will come
forth.” “Nine” years passing/elapsing from/since “70”
(understood as a year)27 will lead us to 79 — the year of
Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration, which took place in the month of
Dhi’l-Qadih 1279 AH (May 1863) in the Garden of Ridván in
Baghdad.

The above prophecies also clearly indicate that Husayn b.

‘Alí will outlive the Qá’im and that He will rise for His Cause
after the Qá’im’s death. The Qá’im will be martyred, while
Husayn b. ‘Alí will outlive Him. These indications perfectly fit
into the historic context and particularly into the
circumstances of the ascension of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh.

Let us now proceed on to the second part of the prophecy in
the Hayát al-Nafs beginning with its Persian translation by
Siyyid Kázim:

My translation of the above passage based on both versions is
as follows, with different readings indicated by a forward
slash:

> And Yazíd b. Mu‘áviyyih and ‘Ubaydu’lláh b.
> Ziyád…and those who were content with their
> abominable actions from the first to the last, may God
> curse all of them altogether, will assemble. Then His
> holiness imám Husayn, may peace be upon Him, will
> put them all to death and execute vengeance upon every

> hypocrites and their companions until a party of
> enemies and the remaining unbelievers/unbelievers
> from every side, from every corner of the world band
> together against His holiness in a way that they prevail
> [over him] and besiege that Noble person in the Sacred
> House of God. When the situation becomes
> increasingly grave for His holiness then the “Generous,”
> the Commander of the Faithful, may peace be upon
> Him, will come forth with angels to assist His precious
> son/ solace of the eyes. Then He will kill enemies of the
> religion and the leaders of the hypocrites. That Noble
> person will stay (lit.: tarry) with His highly honored son
> for a period of three hundred and nine years as did (lit.:

> (handkerchief?) from extreme old age.
Before we compare this passage in Siyyid Kázim’s Persian
translation with its Arabic original let us clarify certain
points. “The Generous/Blood-shedder” (Saffáh) is an epithet
describing imám ‘Ali (whose other epithet is “the Commander
of the Faithful”). Imám al-Báqir is quoted as saying:29
‫ ﻩﻝ ﺕﺩﺭﯼ ﻡﻥ ﺍﻝﻡﻥﺕﺹﺭ ﻭﺍﻝﺱﻑﺍﺡ؟ ﯼﺍ ﺝﺍﺏﺭ ﺍﻝﻡﻥﺕﺹﺭ ﺍﻝﺡﺱﯼﻥ ﻕﺍﻝ ﺝ‬:‫ﺍﺏﺭ‬

(‫)ﻉﻝﯼﻩ ﺍﻝﺱﻝﺍﻡ( ﻭﺍﻝﺱﻑﺍﺡ ﺃﻡﯼﺭﺍﻝﻡﺅﻡﻥﯼﻥ )ﻉﻝﯼﻩ ﺍﻝﺱﻝﺍﻡ‬30

> Jábir said: Do you know who is the Victorious (al-
> Muntasir) and the Generous (al-Saffáh)?’ — ‘O Jábir,
> the Victorious is al-Husayn (may peace be upon Him)
> and the Generous is the Commander of the Faithful
> (may peace be upon Him).

“The companions of the Cave” is an allusion to Koran 18:24/25:
“And they tarried in the Cave three hundred years, and to that
they added nine more.”31

Let us now turn our attention to Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá’í’s
original text of the passage in the “Hayát al-Nafs” based on the
three manuscripts:

Following is a translation of the above passage based on the
three MS versions, with different readings indicated by a

The same message is conveyed by the passage in Siyyid
Kázim’s “Risáliy-i-Bahbahániyyih” already quoted:

What is special about this part of the prophecy, which is
based on the Koranic verse, is that “309” features in it as a split
number consisting of two separate numbers of years/year
periods: three hundred years and nine years (see above). The
noun it modifies (“years”) occurs twice — following the “three
hundred” and the “nine”: ‫“ ﺙﻝﺍﺙﻡﺍﺉﺓ ﺱﻥﺓ ﻭ ﺕﺱﻉ ﺱﻥﯼﻥ‬three
hundred years and nine years,” while from a grammatical
stand-point a compound number (309) should be treated in
Arabic as one single unit with the modified noun that follows
it occurring once: ‫“ ﺙﻝﺍﺙﻡﺍﺉﺓ ﻭ ﺕﺱﻉ ﺱﻥﯼﻥ‬three hundred and
nine years.” In the Koranic verse which the prophecy alludes to
— though generally understood to indicate a single number
(309) — nine is also separated from 300: “And they tarried in the
Cave three hundred years, and to that they added nine more.”
All these factors considered it is reasonable to suppose that
nine has a special value attached to it in this prophecy and that
it stands on its own (which of course does not preclude 309
from being significant too). This also serves as a confirmation
of the validity of the method we employed earlier, which
consisted of splitting “fifty nine” into “nine” and ‘fifty”
(years) and considering each unit on its own merits. In other
words, this part appears to hold a clue to unraveling the riddle
behind the whole prophecy, based largely on a special

symbolism of “nine” within the compound numbers the
prophecy contains.

Now let us reflect more deeply upon the following lines and
the message they convey, focusing on the numbers, names and
name combinations involved:

> Then imám Husayn…will kill them and avenge upon
> them… When the situation becomes increasingly grave
> for Him then ‘Alí…will come forth with angels to assist
> Him…And ‘Alí will stay with Husayn…for three
> hundred years and nine years…
In summary, it conveys the following message: “Husayn (who
is mentioned first) is joined by ‘Alí and they stay together for
three hundred years and nine years.” Taken symbolically, this
forms a name combination, which is highly significant, for it
corresponds to Bahá’u’lláh’s name: “Husayn” plus “‘Alí” is
“Husayn-‘Alí.” The prophecy tells us that “Husayn + ‘Alí
(Husayn-‘Alí, i.e., Bahá’u’lláh) will stay for 309 years.” We have
already seen that numbers expressing temporal realities in non-
linear language do not necessarily refer to a time period and
can also indicate a year (cf. “70” which we interpreted as a
reference to the year 1270). Accordingly, if we apply “309” to a
year it would be logical to take it to imply 1309 AH, which is
the year of Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension. Consequently, viewed from
this angle, the hidden message of the prophecy appears to fit
perfectly into the context of historic realities becoming
transparent and fully meaningful: Husayn-‘Alí (Husayan + ‘Alí),
i.e., Bahá’u’lláh stays in this world until 1309. In his account of
Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension, Shoghi Effendi wrote:

> …His general condition grew steadily worse…which at
> last culminated in His ascension…on the 2nd of Dhi’l-
> Qa‘dih 1309 AH (May 29, 1892), eight hours after
> sunset, in the 75th year of His age.37
If we look further into the quoted passage from the
prophecy, we may discover that it contains even more
information, given the fact that a message conveyed in
symbolic (non-linear) language can well have several layers of
meaning. This assumption is supported by the earlier
conclusion that “nine” which is separated from “300” has a

special value attached to it within the compound number
“309.” Therefore it must play a special role. But what is the
significance of nine here? The clue to the riddle appears to be in
the sentence itself: “And ‘Alí will stay with Husayn …for three
hundred years and nine years…”

We have already considered the names in their combination.

Let us now analyze them separately. The name “‘Alí,” by which
the Báb often referred to Himself, is the first component of
His compound name: ‘Alí-Muhammad. Husayn is the first
component of Bahá’u’lláh’s name: Husayn-‘Alí. The first part
of the prophecy (see above) clearly indicated that Husayn would
outlive ‘Alí, while the second part tells us that ‘Alí will stay with
Husayn for…nine years. If ‘Alí is taken to imply ‘Alí-
Muhammad the Báb and Husayn — Husayn-‘Alí Bahá’u’lláh,
then a correspondence with historic realities will become
apparent. Between the Báb’s declaration in 1260 AH and
Bahá’u’lláh’s first receiving His revelation in 1269 AH, a period
of nine years elapsed (see above) or to put it metaphorically, for
nine years Husayn[-‘Alí Bahá’u’lláh] abided under the shadow
of ‘Alí[-Muhammad the Báb]’s Revelation before the birth of
His own Revelation. To quote Shoghi Effendi, Bahá’u’lláh was
in “active and exemplary discipleship in the service of the Báb”:

> At a time when the Cause of the Bab seemed to be
> hovering on the brink of extinction, when the hopes
> and ambitions which animated it had, to all human
> seeming, been frustrated…, the Divine Promise
> enshrined within it was about to be suddenly redeemed,
> and its final perfection mysteriously manifested. The
> Bábí Dispensation was being brought to its close (not
> prematurely but in its appointed time), and was
> yielding its destined fruit and revealing its ultimate
> purpose — the birth of the Mission of Bahá’u’lláh…
> During nine years, as foretold by the Bab Himself,
> swiftly, mysteriously and irresistibly the embryonic
> Faith conceived by Him had been developing until, at
> the fixed hour, the burden of the promised Cause of
> God was cast amidst the gloom and agony of the Siyah-
> Chal of Tihran. “Behold,” Bahá’u’lláh Himself, years
> later, testified…, “how immediately upon the

> embittered by agonizing sorrows, and immortalized,
> as it drew to a close, by the sudden eruption of the
forces     released   by    an     overpowering,      soul-

revolutionizing Revelation.
Let us now move to the closing lines of the second part of
the prophecy:

> Then ‘Ali will be struck upon His head…, may God
> curse His murderer. And Husayn… will remain supreme
> over the religion of God. And the period of His
> kingdom/period is fifty thousand years until He covers
> (lit.: ties) His eyebrows with a bandage from extreme
> old age. (cf. above)
This passage brings us back to the circumstances of the death
of ‘Alí and Husayn. Once again, it is emphasized that ‘Alí will
be murdered/martyred and that Husayn will die a natural death
at an old age. Husayn will outlive ‘Alí and continue to promote
their common Cause, staying firm in the religion of God after
‘Alí is martyred. His kingdom will last for 50,000 years. In
linear language, the syntax of the last phrase would imply that
Husayn will first reign for 50,000 years and then die upon the
completion of this period. But in the symbolic non-linear
language in which the prophecy is told, the story does not
unfold sequentially. Thus, several different messages can be
conveyed simultaneously. Consequently, one plane of meaning
may be understood to refer to the short-term perspective, i.e.,
to the lives of ‘Alí and Husayn on earth, while another conveys
a long-term picture, i.e., Husayn’s spiritual Kingdom. Once
‘Alí and Husayn are identified with the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh,
respectively, the correspondences between the first plane of
meaning and reality become apparent. That the described
short-term events match completely the circumstances of the
earthly lives of the Bab and Bahá’u’lláh is so obvious to anyone
who is familiar with the history of the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths
that the issue does not need further elaboration. As for the
meaning of “the 50,000 years of Husayn’s kingdom” one can
assume that a year here implies 10 years as indicated in the
beginning of the prophecy (“…the True and Exalted [God] will
prolong days and nights so that a year will become equal to ten
years.”). By multiplying 50,000 by 10, we get 500,000 (years)
which correspond to the duration of Bahá’u’lláh’s Cycle as
interpreted by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in relation to the Zoroastrian
prophecy (see above).

Let us now return to the first part of this prophecy and the
related prophecy from the “Risáliy-i-Bahbahániyyih” to
consider a number for which no interpretation has so far been

suggested, i.e., “50” in the following lines of the respective
eschatological accounts:

> …Thus the duration of His (i.e., the Qá’im’s) kingdom
> [will be] seventy years…And when nine and fifty years
> pass/elapse from/since them Husayn…will come
> forth...And when He dies Husayn...will set
> up/administer His burial arrangements.
> …The first of them to return nine and fifty years after
> the Qá’im…is Husayn b. ‘Ali…
It was suggested earlier that “nine years elapsing from 70

(understood as a year)” indicated (12)79 AH, i.e., the year of
Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration, which marks the beginning of His
mission. The starting point for this calculation is 1270 AH.
However, the other prophecy implies that “nine” and “50” may
also be counted from the beginning of the Báb’s mission (1260
AH), who is identified with the Qá’im. The underlying logic
behind all our interpretations is based on the fact that events
when expressed in non-linear language are not necessarily
sequential and the message has different levels of meaning
enfolded in the text which coexist without precluding one
another. It has already been shown that nine years calculated
from 1260 AH lead to a significant date in history, i.e., 1269
AH (the time when Bahá’u’lláh first received His revelation),
confirming the validity of the assumption that 1260 AH should
be taken as a starting point from which to reckon “50” as well.
This would lead one to another significant date, the ascension
of Bahá’u’lláh, marking a period which embraces the Ministry
of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh as the Twin Manifestations of God
(from the Bab’s declaration until Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension 49
years and six months ≈ 50 years elapsed) described by Shoghi
Effendi in the following way:

> Inaugurated by the Báb, culminating in Bahá’u’lláh,
> anticipated and extolled by the entire company of the
> Prophets of this prophetic cycle, this period has, except
> for the short interval between the Báb’s martyrdom and
> Bahá’u’lláh’s shaking experiences in the Siyáh-Chál of
> Tihrán, been characterized by almost fifty years of
> continuous and progressive Revelation — a period
> which by its duration and fecundity must be regarded

> as unparalleled in the entire field of the world’s
> spiritual history.39
Another significant 50 year period can be identified elapsing
from the time of the Báb’s execution (1266 AH) until His
remains finally arrived in the Holy Land — not precluding the
previous interpretation. Shoghi Effendi writes:

> Assisted by another believer, Háji Sháh Muhammad
> buried the casket beneath the floor of the inner
> sanctuary of the shrine of Imám-Zádih Zayd, where it
> lay undetected until Mirzá Asadu'lláh-i-Isfahani was
> informed of its exact location through a chart
> forwarded to him by Bahá’u’lláh. Instructed by
> Bahá’u’lláh to conceal it elsewhere, he first removed the
> remains to his own house in Tihrán, after which they
> were deposited in several other localities such as the
> house of Husayn-i-‘Ali-yi-Isfahani and that of
> Muhammad-Karím-i-‘Attár, where they remained

> Kirmánsháh, Baghdad and Damascus, to Beyrut and
> thence by sea to ‘Akka, arriving at their destination on
> the 19th of the month of Ramadan 1316 AH (January
> 31, 1899), fifty lunar years after the Báb’s execution in
> Tabriz. 40
The quoted passage from Shoghi Effendi clearly shows that
the arrangements for the transportation of the Báb’s remains,
their protection and temporary concealment until they were
finally laid to rest in the Holy Land were made under
Bahá’u’lláh’s direct instruction, Who literally “administered”
the Báb’s burial. Thus, the phrase from the prophecy: “And
when He dies Husayn...will set up/administer His burial
arrangements” (see above) fits well into historical context.

It would be fair to say that the predictions contained in
Shaykh Ahmad’s eschatological account are not unique to his
work and can be found in other sources. Moreover, his
prophecy is composed of parts which can be traced back to the
“Bihár al-Anvár” by Majlisí, “Usul-i-Káfí” by Kuliní, and

“‘Aválim al-‘Ulum va-l-Ma‘árif” by Shaikh Bahrainí, which are
cited in many other works. Thus, in Moslem traditions there
exist numerous references to seven and/or nine and/or 70 years
of the Qá’im’s/Mahdí’s life or reign, for example:

ً‫ﯼﻉﯼﺵ ﺥﻡﺱﺍً ﺃﻭ ﺱﺏﻉﺍً ﺃﻭ ﺕﺱﻉﺍ‬41
[The Qá’im/Mahdi] lives five or seven or nine;

References to Husayn being the One who administers the
Qá’im’s burial are frequent too:

Numerous prophetic references to “309 years” are also found in
the sources:

The sources also clearly indicate the period of 50,000 years:

And finally references to “Husayn covering His eyes at an old
age” are also found in the traditions:

Thus every part of Shaykh Ahmad’s prophecy which we have
considered in this article is found elsewhere and the prominent
religious thinker simply collected them from well-known
sources. However, when the eschatological events related in
different traditions are put together precisely the way Shaykh
Ahmad did in his account, the correspondences between the
predictions and Bábí and Bahá’í history become most apparent:

> The duration of His kingdom is seven years [the Báb
> was martyred during the 7th year of His mission]. God
> prolongs the days and nights that a year may become
> equal to ten years. Because God, may He be praised,
> commands the sphere[s] to slow down. Thus, the
> duration of His kingdom [will be] seventy years
> [counting] by these years. And when nine and fifty
> years elapse since them Husayn, may peace be upon
> Him, will come forth [1270 + 9 = 1279 — the year of
> Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration; 1260 + 9 = 1269 — the year

> 1309≈50 years — the Ministry of the Báb and
> Bahá’u’lláh as the Twin Manifestations; 1266-1316 — 50
> years elapsing from the Báb’s execution until His

In conclusion, let us summarize the main points above. The
prophecy being considered, which was put together by Shaikh
Ahmad from different traditions, reveals a picture of real
historic events disguised in symbolic non-linear language. It is
largely based on a play upon the numbers and names following
in a certain significant, but not necessarily sequential, order.
The numbers and names form meaningful combinations in a
manner that does not preclude their components from
conveying separate messages as well. A special role is accorded
to the number “nine.” Thus one can identify indications of the
following events and time periods in Bábí and Bahá’í history:

1\. The Báb will be martyred;
2\. He will be martyred during the 7th year of His mission;
3\. Bahá’u’lláh will outlive the Báb;
4\. Bahá’u’lláh will take care of the Báb’s remains;
5\. After the Báb’s martyrdom Bahá’u’lláh will rise to

continue Their twin ministry;
6\. Bahá’u’lláh will challenge the old world order by His

powerful new teaching;
7\. Bahá’u’lláh will face fierce opposition;
8\. Bahá’u’lláh will prevail over His enemies, live until an old

age, and die a natural death;
9\. Indications of years and periods:

> a. 1270 + 9 = 1279: the year of Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration;
b. 1260 + 9 = 1269: the year when Bahá’u’lláh first received

His revelation;
> c. 1309: the year of Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension;
d. 1260-1309≈50 years: the Ministry of the Báb and

Bahá’u’lláh as the Twin Manifestations;
e. 1266-1316: 50 years elapsing from the Báb’s execution

> until His remains arrived at their permanent
> destination;
f. 50,000 × 10 = 500,000 years: the duration of

Bahá’u’lláh’s cycle.59
Finally, the present writer is aware of the possible objections
to his interpretations on the grounds that the correspondences
suggested in the article could be seen as mere coincidences or
assumptions. The only counter-argument I can put forward to
my opponents is that such numerous “coincidences” within a
short passage of text raises the question of an underlying
objective reality. As for the assumptions, as long as I have been
consistent in my assumptions (which I believe I have) they are
at least not arbitrary. It would be relevant to remember that

Shaykh Ahmad — given his spiritual status acting under a
divine inspiration or guidance — could have consciously or
unconsciously presented a prophecy in a manner which would
include an account of real future events.

NOTES

\[1\] The St. Petersburg Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian

> Academy of Sciences (former St. Petersburg Branch of the Institute of
> Oriental Studies) has a vast collection of Shaykhi manuscripts (as well
> as Bábí and Bahá’í). Most of the manuscripts containing works of
> Shaykh Ahmad Ahsá’í and Siyyid Kázim Rashtí (50 works) originated
> before the Báb’s Declaration in 1260 AH and therefore did not pass
> through the hands of Karím-Khán Kirmání’s followers.

\[2\] Since the subject of this article is limited to this passage, I will refer to it

as the “prophecy.”

\[3\] The “Hayát al-Nafs” is a systematic outline of Shaykhi doctrines,

providing the basis for the “Usul-i-’Aqá’id.”
