BABISM AND THE BAB.
IN studying the origins of an ancient religion and endeavoring
to sift its records so as to extract the pure gold of unalloyed
truth, the candid scholar soon comes face to face with unex-
pected difficulties. He finds himself in a world very differen'
from that which he has been accustomed to deal with ; he meets
a class of minds marked by an intense conviction and readiness
of belief quite foreign to our nineteenth century indifferentism.
'fhe air is electric with supernatural tension and miractilous
signs. Hidden wisdom is clain1ed .for the u1ost trivial acts, and
providential guidance for the most ordinary occurrences, and the
usual sequence of motives and conduct seems often radically
altered. Prudence and caution give place to enthusiastic ardor
and an unshakable devotion to some religious leader whose
lightest word is sacred authority, and in loyalty to whom fortune,
rank, hon1e and family interests are counted as dross. Visions
of a new and better age, a reign of God's saints on a renovated
eartl1, sweep not only peasants and fisher1nen, but also merchants,
scholars and philosophers off their feet to encounter persecution
and death in its most f1·ightful forms.

In these graphic narratives, with their signs and prophecies,
sudden conversions and extraordinary heroisms, - annals so full
of the broadest contrast to the usual course of things to-day, -
how n1uch may the historian credit as having actually occurred?
Does the intense conviction that seals its testimony with its blood
authenticate the accuracy of the accounts, or does it cast doubt

upon them? Are these reported marvels the signs of super-
natural agency and an inspired authority, or, on the other band,
are they exaggerations of ce1·tain natural facts, or, perhaps, even

pure myths, originated by dogmatic tendencies and popular expec-
tations, in the prolific soil of the believer·s imagination? When
the first outbursts of enthusiastic faith . and heroic self-sacrifice

> have passed away, and the chronic human passions of envy, am-
> bition and jealousy have sprung up again among the successors
> of the first prophets and martyrs of the cause, should we suppose
> that the early accounts will then pass down to us in their original
> simplicity, or may they be radically mutilated or embellished by
the later propagators and leaders of the faith?

In solving these questions it is evident what a priceless light is

range the rise of a new religion in our OW'll age. This fact it is
that gives such special value to the study of the origin and his-
tory of the Babi movement. Not a few of its original disciples
and leaders are still living, or were living a few years ago, and
have supplied to European scholars their personal narratives of
the movemeut. Several inestimable early recorcls have already
been published and been put beyond reach of alteration. The
growth of the moveinent, moreover, in spite of the terrible per-
secutions it has suffered, has . been more than sufficient to give
it notable political siguificance. In the abundance and nloving
po\ver of its dramatic incidents, in the unswerving fortitude
under all the tortures that OriAntal tyranny could invent and
t he absorbing personal loyalty to their adored leader exhibited by
his disciples, the story of Babism is one of the most ro1nantic to
be found in either ancient or modern history. In the lig ht of
these facts it is evident bow instructive, both to the student of
comparative religion, and to hin1 who would get a clearer under-
standing of Christianity, the '1istory of the Bab and the faith he
founded must be.

"Fifty years ago," to quote the 'vorcls of Mr. Edward G.

Bro\vne, to whose researches, conducted with truly 1·emarkable
enthusiasm, diligence and thoroughness, \Ve owe so much of our
knowledge of this n1ovement, "Persia belonged to all intents and
J>urposes to the ancient \vorld. There hardly anything \Vas im-
possible, and not very mil.ny things grossly improbable." The
delight in mystical theosophic speculations, the readiness to believe

any "'onder or supernatural claim, and the susceptibility to e1n<>-
tional excitement in response to florid rhetorical appeals existed
in a fo1·1n and degree genuinely Oriental. The Persian genius and
tendencies, having r emained immovably Aryan ( however uncon-
sciously so), have never found the Semitic faith of l slan1 entirely
congenial. This is the secret of the division of the Shiite 1\'Ios-
leu1s from the Sunnites, and the license accorded her e to the
pantheistic rhapsodies of the Sufis. This has also undoubtedly
increased the natural irritation of the people against the Moslem
priests. The quibbling and hypocrisy, the cupidity, narrowness
and ignorant dogmatism of the ~Iullahs had become notorious,
and the mass of spurious tradition and absurd fable that they
strove to force men to believe brought religion into conteu1pt and
disrepute. These various influences naturally combined to dis-          •
turb the religious world of Persia, whose waters, for that matter,
are always seething with some new doctrinal agitation.
724                   Babism and the Bab.               [December,

But sixty years ago a more special and intense source of com-
motion began to 611 all Per8ia with unrest. This was the e.x-
pected coming of the In1a1n-M:ihdi. According to the Shiites,
the Twelfth Imatn, l\'1ul1amn1ad, "the Proof of God," 'vho suo-
ceeded to the In1a1nate in the year 260 of the Muha1n1nadan era,
did not die, but disappeared mysteriously. The Moslems of the
East held that he still lives (like Frederick Barbarossa in the
German legend) surrounded by a chosen band in the ruyste1-ions
city of J :1.bulk{i. When the fullness of tinie comes, and the earth
is fill~d with injustice and the appointed signs appear, he 'vill
co1ne forth to overthro\v the infidels and inaugurate a reign of
universal peace and blessedness. During the period, 110,vever,
that the In1am-l\1ahdi \Vas hidden from the sight of 111en, certain
channels of comn111nication, or Gates, u1ight appear.

As the year 1844 of our era, which \vould complete the cycle
of a thousand· years fro1n the date of the minor occultation of the
original Imam-Mahdi, came near , the expectation and excitement
over the manifestation of the Coming One naturally gre\v intense
throughout Persia. The multiplication of sects and schisms and
the very corruption of the regular Muhan1madan clergy were
regarded as signs that a ne\v Divine Manifestation \vas at hand,
for it is just before da,vn that the night is darkest. So1ne years
before, a fa1nous ascetic and seElr, the pious Sheykb Ahmad of
Ahsa, had founded a new school of faith called the S heykhi.
Residing mainly in the neighborhood of the holy shrine in Ker-
bela, he visited Persia several times and diffused through that
country also his some,vhat heterodox views. He believed hi1nself
under the special guidance of the l1nams, \vhom he regarded as
creative forces. He taught that the grosser elements of the body
perish irrevocably at death, but that there is a subtle celestial

•
body which survives.

On the death of Sheykh Ah1nad his disciple, Haji Seyyid Ka.zin1

of llesht, succeeded hin1 ; this teacher's various works are said t-0
exceed three hundred volumes. He emphasized especially the
doctrine called the Fourth Support, - that there must always be
in the true 1'1oslen1 church so1ne one perfect man or spiritual
guide and revealer, capable of serving as a channel of grace

and that when this Sun of Truth appeared, it would "irradiate
all horiwns." After his death, the Skeykbis, therefore, \Vere
anxiously expecting the appearance of son1e one to take the leader-
ship of thei1· body. As Sin1eon, in the days when J esns \Vas born,
was waiting for the Consolation of Israel, so in P ersia, in those
clays, there were many 111en, just and devout, who we1·e looking for
him who \Vas to be a ligb~ unto their nation and· manifest the
return of the long-awaited ln1am, the Divine Revealer.

It was in this atmosphere of expectation and faith that the
young 111an, Mirza Ali Muban1macl, after\vards called the Bab,
gre'v up, and at this juncture he first came into public notice.
According to the best accounts he was born on October 9, 1820,
in the city of Shiraz. 1'he Babis say that at the mo1nent of his
birth he exclaimed " The kingdom is God's." His teacher, who
after\vartls becan1e an ardent disciple, relates that the very first day
on which the little Ali \vas brought to school and the alphabet
had been written down for him, he read both Persian and Arabic

> \vith ease and a1nazed the teacher with subtle reasonings and ques-
> tions. Before he had been instructed in writing he composed and
> \Vrote do,vn eloquent verses on the 1nystery of the Divine Unity.
> These ma1·velous signs of the Bab's holiness and lofty spiritual
> rank are attested not only by his teacher, but also by his mater-
> nal uncle, who brought Ali up, afte1· his father's early death, and
> subsequently died a 01artyr to his Babi faith. If our Christian
> readers are inclined to be skeptical as to the honesty of the wit-
> nesses, we can only refer the1n to the argument of the Bahi his-

tory of the Bab," by E. G. Browne, p. 265 ).

Although claiming to be a Seyyid, or descendant of the Pro-

that this was for purposes of study and maintain that it was
the elder teacher rather who was helped by this acquaintance.
Those who do not belong to the Babi circle, however, declare
that, as a youth, !Y1irza Ali Muhammad was illiterate and had uo
sufficient knowledge of Arabic g1·a.mmar; scholars have fouud
even his mature \vritings very peculiar, to say the least, in their
grarn mati cal construction.

After the death of Seyyid Kazim, the members of the Sheykh i
School, as we have seen, were in great perplexity as to \vhom they
should recognize as the God-ordained channel of divine grace,
worthy to wear the mantle of their departed Master. Meeting
after meeting \Vas held with prayer and fasting, seeking divine
guidance in their choice. This went on for some five months,
when, one day, the Mullah Huseyn of Bushraw~yb, one of their
most learned and influential leaders, ca1ne to visit ~1irza Ali
Muhau1mad. 1'he young 1nan asked the Mullah whotn the Sheyk-
his now ackno,vle<lged as their Master. When told that, as yet,
they had recognized no one, he boldly asked if the Mullah did
not recognize in him the characteristics and signs required. As
the Mullah in t'vo nlonths' acquaintance with him had not . ob-
served any signs of special knowledge, he frankly answered in
the negative. But soon thereafter, being shown Commentaries
upon the Surat u'l Bakara, the Sura of Joseph, and the "Tra-
dition of the Handrnaideu," and hearing Mirza Ali Muhammad
r ecite verses of a very lofty and profound character, whose sub·
tlety and eloquence he believed were quite beyond what he could
have uttered had he not been supei·naturally inspired, Mullah
Hnseyn recognized the young man as the long-looked-for Bab, the
Gateway 01· Door of Revelation. 'fhe title \Vas not new, but
anciently had been used to designate those who had access to the
I:welfth I1uam during his seclusion. It had also been assumed
in the tenth century by a noted heresiarch and was used by the
Seyyid l{lizim to designate his inspired function as the forerunner
of the Coming One. As Ali, the Prophet's nephe,v, had been
the gate by \vhich n1en entered the city of the prophet's know-
ledge, so ~Iirza Ali Muhan1ma.d (whose very name showed him to
be a return of the ancient revealer) was the gate through which
men might have kuo,vledge of the great Revealer who was shortly
to appear.

Many of the Sheykhi School vigorously repudiated these lofty
pretensions of a young man of poor education, hitherto quite
obscure. But fully one half of them, led by Mullah fluseyn

1897.]                Bal>ism and the Bab.                     727

(who, as the first disciple to acknowledge the Gat.e, was called the
Gate of the Gate), accepted the new revelation and recognized in
the young man the fulfillment of the pro1nised signs. It was
recalled that when the departed Master Seyyid. Kazim was askecl
about the manifestation which was to succeecl him, he had said,
"There will be a schism amongst my followers, but God's affair
will be clear as this rising sun." As he spoke, he pointed to the
door, through which streamed a flood of sunlight ; and at that
sa1ne 1no1nent, Mirza Ali Muha1nmad crossed the threshold. The
very fact that the young man had, bcfo1·e this tirne, been con-
sidered illiterate, and had been found stumbling over the inter-
pretation of passages in the Koran, made it so much the clearer
proof of his divine inspiration that verses which were regarded
as superior in eloquence and beauty to those of the Moslem Scrip-

> tures should be "poured forth like copious sho\vers by this sin1-
> ple and unlettered youth." "0 God I " exolai1necl the Saint of
> Khurasan, "in face of such a1nple proofs, how is denial possi-
> ble ?" The Mullah l\'1 uham1nad Ali of Barfurush, a man noted
> for his piety and godliness, had no sooner seen and conversed
> with the Bab than he at once believed, without seeking any fur•
> ther sign, regarding such a demand as unsee1nly, and was re·
> warcled with the title of Hazrat-i-Kuddus - " His Holiness the
Sacred."

Another of the early and prominent disciples was the re1nark-
> able \voman - the Hypatia of the movement -Zarriii-taj, or
"Golden Crown." The daughter of the Mullah Salih of Kaz.

> rious martyrdom, she stands forth incon1parable and immortal
a1nidst her countrywo1nen."

Under the impulsion of these enthusiastic apostles and their
> fellow proselyters, many important converts were made and tbe
> new faith began to spread. To give it greater pro1ninence, tbe
> leaders of the new movement planned to go to the ruined 1nosque
of Khufa, deeply revered in t hat part of Asia, and there proclaim
t heir master as the forerunner and channel of cornn1unication of
t he 11uam-Mahdi. But as tbe Musulman wo1·ld clicl not see1n
ready to respond to this call and many of their missionaries
received disrespectful treatment, a bolder and more effective plan
\vas for1ned. This \vas no less than to send the Bab, under the
guidance of his lieutenants, !Jaji Suley1nan Khan and Hazrat-i-
Kuddus, to ~ecca, and there proclaim his divine mission to the
g1·eat assemblage of pilgri1ns fro1n all quarters of I slam. Not
only \vould the good ne,vs thus be spread more \videly than in
any other w:iy; it would also fulfill the prophecy which declared
that the l1nam-Mahcli would manifest himself at Mecca, Me-
dina, and beyond I(hufa and Khurasan at the end of a thousand
years.

'fhi s plan was accordingly carried out. The pilgTimage was
1nade, and in 1844, tbe exact completion of the cycle of a thou·
sand yea1·s, tbe Bab proclaimed at Mecca his manifestation as
the Divine Gate and performed the circuman1bulatio11 of the Holy

1897.]                      Babism and thd Bab.                729

Mosque, " with such an air" (to quote the words of one who
dated his con version to Babism from that incident) "of solemn
ecstasy, reverence and humility as filled me with amazement, so
that I knew of a surety that this must be either He who is to
arise out of the family of Muhammad (i. e. the Mahdi) or else
one of the Guardians who shall accomp1'ny him."

In 1845 the Bab returned to Bashire by sea and then visited
Khufa and Khurasan, t.o complete the fulfillment of the prophecy,
and at once sent out his missionaries to all the principal cities of
Persia to proclaim him as the "Remnant of Allah," him who
should appear from the lineage of the great Prophet. Eighteen
chief apostles were. appointed, called the L etters of the Living.

The vices, ignorance and narrowness of the regular Moslem
clergy were unsparingly denounced ; the descent of the Bab from
the great prophet and the n1iracles that attended hitn were pro-
claimed; the inspiration which enabled him to 'vrite Arabic

> verses that were superior to those of the Holy Book was trium-
> phantly adduced, and the notable conversions of eminent Doctors
> of I slam and the very dissensions and persecutions of the time
> were brought forward as signs that he was the true Gate of the
New Dispensation.

The Mullahs and the more fanatical of the Moslem laity were
> exceedingly angry at the outbreak of this new heresy. The
> preachers of the faith were mobbed and grievously maltreated,
> and even punished with the lash by the authorities. The Bab
> was seized and confined at Shiraz ; his house was attacked by
> a rabble instigated, it is alleged, by the authorities themselves.
> The Governor, instead of punishing the ringleaders of the mob,
> confiscated the goods of the Bab and subjected his uncle, the
> owner of the house, to the bastinado. But all these persecutions
> only spread abroad the fame of the new prophet. The officer to
> whose custody the Bab was committed became convinced that the
> recovery of his son from au attack of the plague was due to the
> Bab's prayers, and so gave him liberty to escape. In this flight,
> as in that of Muhammad to Medina, supernatural wonders lent
> their sacred halo to the Prophet. To whichever of the three
> horses the Bab rode, "a peculiar virtue was communicated, so
> that it went more smoothly and swiftly and forbore to void its
> excreta." One night, when the Bab had been missed and sought

which is symbolical of the Divine Unity, while a continuous ftow
of light hung like a veil round about him and rose heavenwards.
This light so encompassed him, forn1ing, as it were, a halo round
about him, that tlie eye was dazzled. The other companion of
the flight, beholding -this, uttered a. loud cry and swooned away,
and was never again in his right mind, and soon after, as the
effect of this vision, yielded up his spirit to the Lord of glory.

This miracle of the Bab's transfiguration is perhaps one of the
most striking of the supernatural powers and incidents attributed
to him by his followers. But it is only one among many. The
faith of the Babis in the divine mission and character of their
prophet was so ardent as readily to lend a miraculous tinge
to very commonplace occurrences. Doors, bolted and locked,
opened at his command. A box of sweetmeats that he bad was
kept perennially filled. A metal pipe.cover was transmnted to
gold at his touch. .!t Milan he healed a scald.headed child by
dra\ving a handkerchief over him and repeating certain holy
words. The water in which he washed was sought by the crowd
to use for healing the sick, and proved efficacious in working
wondrous cures. Besides this he exhibited marvelous powers of
prophecy and knowledge of secret things, such as a message hid
in a cucumber. Mullah Mirza Muhammad once wrote down two
thousand and four hundred occurrences of a miraculous character
which he had witnessed on the part of his Holiness, the Bab, and
his apostles. The Bab himself, however, did not regard these as
proofs of his mission, and did not desire to have them published.
The one supernatural sign on which he rested his commission was
his inspired poetic improvisations. "By what sign," the lma10-
J um'a asked him at Isfahan, " do you establish the truth of your
claim?" " By verses," said the Bab, "for without pause of pen
I can, in the space of three hours, write a thousand sentences on
any subject that I please." "But," objected his host, "you may
have considered the matter previously." "I will write," replied
the Bab, "on any subject you like." "Then," said his host,
"write for me a commentary on the Sutra Wa'l-asr" (103 of the
Kuran ). " So his Holines~ began to write and in three hours
[or six, in Mirza Jan i's account] wrote a thousand verses. Thus
the lmam-Jum'a was convinced that such power was from God,
being beyond the capacity of man" ("New History of the Bab,''
pp. 209 and 34 7).

On his arrival at Isfahan, the Bab was entertained by one of
its most distinguished religious leaders, who soon beeame a oon-

vert. The governor, Minuchir Khan, took a strong interest in
him, and tried to arrange a public discussion between him and
the lea.ding Mullahs concerning the new faith. The regular
clergy were afraid to risk an argument with the heresiarch, and,
instead, ran to the higher officials at Teheran with a batch of
gross misrepresentations. The governor, ordered to send the
Bab to the capital, ma.de a feint of so doing, but concealed him
in his own palace, and even offered, it is alleged, to lend him five
thousand tribesmen to back him, in case he was disposed to go
to war with the royal authority. Not long after, however, this
independent governor, who had become so attached to the Bab,
died, and the Bab was removed as a prisoner of state, first to
Maku, next to Chihrik, and then to Tabriz. In these various
places the Bab was connned for three or four years, being allowed,
however, to write and communicate with his followers. The
epistles, prayers, treatises, sermons and commentaries on the
Kuran that he wrote in this time are said to have exceeded one
hundred thousand verses ; they were spreacl among all classes of
the people and through all quarters of the land, and made mul-
titudes .of converts. During this time, also, a great step in the
doctrinal development of the Babi faith was taken.

In the early years of the movement, Mirza Ali ~uhamma.d had
been content to call himself the Bab or Gateway of entrance to a
greater Divine :h1anifestation of which he was the forerunner.
But, a.s the movement grew and his disciples everywhere asked,
"\Vho is this greater Incarnation, and when will he manifest him-
self? " theosophic in1agination and natural personal ambition,
inextricably mingled with it, plumed their wings for a still higher
flight. Where else should one look for this greater Theophany,

the goal of the Divine ~1anifestation, than among the Babi
leaders themselves? It seems to have been Hazrat-i-Kuddus 'vho
first laid claim to being this Final Manifestation of God, the
Nukta or Point of Revelation in whom the divine inspiration
reached its climax and God returned in bodily form to the earth.
As proof he produced a lot of verses with which he had been
inspired. For a time Mirza-Ali-Muhammad allowed the claim ;
and his sun became "effiilgent in quiescence." He deferred to

Hazrat-i-Kuddus as his spiritual superior and ceased to write
epistles to the Babi church a.s its head. The leading apostle and
chief arbiter of the sect, Mullah Huseyn, who ha.cl first discovered

the Bab, and so gained the title of "The Gate of the Gate,"
also yielded precedence to the bold disciple who had been the

732                   Babiam and the Bab.             [December,
very last to be admitted to the inner circle of the " Letters of
the Living," but who now aspired to rise above them all at
one bound, as the Mahdi, or Twelfth Imam returned, or (as, at
other times, he claimed to be) Christ come back to earth. The
prophetess l(urratu'l.Ayn also claimed to be a manifestation of
Fatima, the prophet's daughter, and that anything unclean was
rendered pure by being sub1nitted to her gaze.

After a short period of submission to these loftier claims of
Hazrat-i-l(uddus, the Bab and his first Apostle, Mullah Huseyn,
who from the outset seems to have been the resolute ruling spirit
of the new sect, concluded to "turn down " their too ambitious
disciple. Whether they did not find Hazrat-i-Kuddus' verses gen-
uine or sufficiently inspired, or this vain and bumptious leader
failed to secure the confidence or popular support of the mass of
the disciples, we can only conjecture. At any rate, the leaders
concluded to promote the Bab himself to the higher dignity of
Point or Supreme Revealer. Mirza Ali ~1uhammad from the
beginning, it was claimed, had been the destined Goal of Revela-
tion, the Final Manifestation of Allah, only at first his divinity
had been veiled and he had been content to manifest himself
simply as the Bab or Gate. The Babi church enthusiastically
adopted this solution of the mysteries of Providence ; and the
Mullah Huseyn was rewarded for his inesti1nable services by
being pron1oted to the position of Bab. With the acknowledg-
ment of the Supreme Lordship of Mirza Ali Muhammad, this
dignity of Bab was left open to descend to the next in rank in
the Babi hierarchy. Just what compensation or pressure was
e1nployed upon Hazrat-i-Kuddus to make him yield his claims we
are not told; but yield he did. Now tha~ the Bab had become
the Kaim, the Supreme Manifestation of the Divine, greater won-
ders than ever attended his career. "Such radiance of might
and majesty streamed fro1n his countenance that none could bear
to look upon the effulgence of his glory and beauty." No sooner
did the Indian Believer catch sight of the face of His Holiness
than he exolai1ned "This is my Lord," and fell swooning to the
ground.

The excitemel!t and dissension in Persia over the Bab ( for,
although he had now become to his followers " His Supreme
Holiness, the P oint,'' it will be most convenient to continue to
call him by the name by which he bas always been known in the
world at large) were of coarse now greater than ever. Not long
after this the Crown Prince happened to visit Tabriz and decided

1897.J                 Babiam and the Bal>.                       733

to investigate personally the claims of the new prophet whom so
many revered as the long-expected Mahdi. The Bab conducted
himself with dignity and courage, repeating his claim to be J.he
inspired channel of God's grace, authenticated by his miracu~us
gift of versification. The Muhammadan clergy contended that
he could not be the expected Mahdi because there was no n1ys-
tery about either his bil'th or parentage, and they indulged in
much heated abnse. The Crown Prince and bis officers badgered
and mocked the prophet by asking him a multitude of imper-
tinent and ridiculous questions, and at length the sentence to
the punishment of the bastinado, determined upon in advance, was
ordered.

Soon after this, the Shah, Muhammad, passed away, and the
present ruler of Persia, ;Nasil'-u'd-Din, ascended the throne. Such
changes of dynasty in the East, where government is so purely a
personal, not a constitutional matter, are al\vays periods of unrest
and tu1·bulence. The antagonism between the Babis and the regu-
lar clergy grew sharper and sharper. About this time, or a little
earlier, there occurred at Badasht a conference in which the're was
a great deal of wild t.a.J.k, the reports of which increased the popu-
lar prejudice against the Babis. All the outward forms of reli-
gion, prayer, fasting, pilgrin1age and alms, were explained away
as allegories, and esoteric meanings were substituted. All men's
goods were declared to be the property of the Point, the head of
the Babi church. The polygamy and the restrictions on \fjman's
activities prescribed in the Kuran were attacked. " The religion
of the Kaim (i. e. the Point) is to abrogate all prE1vious religions
and laws." Under the rule of "him      . who is to arise of the fam-
ily of Muhammad, men will go to the bazaars, invoke blessings
and take whatever they please from the shops. All goods are the
goods of the Point; all men are his servants, and all women are
his handmaidens, whom he giveth to whomsoever he pleaseth and
taketh from whomsoever he pleaseth." The Kibla (or place to
which one turns in prayer) is all around us. When Hazrat-i-
Kuddus was turning towards Mecca to recite his prayers, "Con-
solation of Eyes" bade him kneel to her: "I am the Kibla."

These erratic doctrines seem not to have remained mere specu-
lations ; many of the Babis began to put thein in practice. They
refused to pay taxes to the government. The Bab, as head of the
church, took it on him to divorce men and women, releasing, for
example, Hazrat-i-Kuddus and " Consolation of Eyes" from their
old marriage bonds and giving them to each other. Fanatic dis-

were treacherously surrounded and shot down, only a few of the
leaders being reserved for a more lingering and painful death
at the hands of their enemies. The Said-u'l-Ulama gratified his           ·
religious hate by first mutilating, and then killing with his own
hand, the leader of these obstinate heretics.

These harsh measures, far from silencing the Babis, only in-
flamed their zeal. In Teheran, the capital itself, a rising was
actually meditated by them. The project was, however, betrayed
before the date set for the conspirators to strike their blow, and
thirty-seven were arrested. All those who would renounce their
faith were offered pardon. But seven faithful ones determined to
die rather than fail in loyalty to their Lord. All of them faced
death and torture with a steadfastness that profoundly in1pressed
the public, who crowded the Royal Square to \vitness their execu-
tion. When a rich merchant sought to ransom the Bab's uncle,
he replied, "My sole desire is ruartyrdoru and the attainment. of
this happiness." Mirza Kurban-Ali's last words were "Know
that this man (the Bab) is he who is to arise of the fan1ily of

Muhammad and we are his servants. W ere I possessed of a
thousand lives I would sacrifice them all for him." As one after

At any rate, it would cost the1n their commissions, perhaps their
lives. They made search, and in a little room, which opened
by a single door on to the platform over which the conden1ned
man had been suspended, the Bab was found. 'fhere, with a
fragment of charcoal, he was calmly writing on the wall this
stanza:-

> I bid thee not be moth or salamander,
> But, as thou 'rt bent on burning, be a man.

> As the executioners ran up to seize him, he said : " 0 people, am
> I not, after all, the Son of God's apostle ? Fear God and have
some shame before his apostle. "'\-Vhat is my crime but that I
have invited you to the knowledge of God and cast myself into
affliction and suffering for your sake? " ("New llistory," p. 383).

> But the executioners had no time to waste in listening to hirn.

He was promptly strung up again and the soldiers were ordered
to fire another volley. As the men, who were Muhammadans,
were reluctant to do so, a Christian reghnent, considered to be
untainted by the new heresy, was ordered out and their volley
proved at once fatal to the prophet. The Babi historians assure
their readers that the strange escape of the Bab from the first
volley was due to his sovereign will which overruled the evil
purpose of men " for the showing for·th of his power and the
fulfillmg of bis proof, to confirm bis servants and to corroborate
the truth of his word: 'There shall not come to pass save that
which I will.' " When the Bab fell under the second volley, it
was because his own Divine Grace seconded and gave effect t.o the
will of his persecutors, to exhibit the sinfulness and rebellious-
ness of the wicked, according to the verse, " We will cause him
to obtain that to which he is inclined."

The historica l student, however, who prefers to think that not
even a Bab's will overrules the natural connections of cause and
effect, will be apt to accept the more prollaic explanation, that
the soldiers of the Muhammadan regiment, who first fired at the
Bab, secretly syn1pathized with him and so aimed at the cords,
not at the person, of the Bab. \Vhatever _the explanation, the
inciden.t will always remain one of the most striking instances of
the tremendous importance in the history of a nation that a single
minute, wisely in1proved or stupidly lost, may attain. Had the
Bab, when the soldiers' bullets had cut the cords and he was thus
strangely released, kept his presence of mind and run into the
throng of spectators, largely composed of Ba.bis or secret syn1pa-
thizers with the new faith. there is little doubt that his life would

738                   Babism and the Bab.             [December,
have been saved. The whole population, ready believers in the
supernatural, would have regarded it as an evident proof of his
divine claims. Not a soldier, as Gobineau says, would have
dared to fire upon him. There would have been a revolt, a gen-
eral insurrection, and in a city of the importance of Tabriz, the
second capital of the Empire, to suppress it would have b een
quite another affair than quelling the rising in Zanjan.         The
dynasty now reigning would perhaps have succu1nbed, and Bab-
ism have become the state religion of Persia, if not of a still
greater part of Asia. But, unfortunately, the Bab, tortured as
he had been since early morning, with his mind dazed by the
painful suspension on the wall and the sudden fall , knew not
what he was doing and, under the unreflecting instinct of taking
refuge somewhere, almost unconsciously turned into the open
door of the guardhouse. Then, finding hirnself in a cul-de-sac,
he submissively resigned himself to the discovery and death which
1nust soon overtake him.            '

It was on July 8, 1850, that the Bab was executed. For two
days his body, \vith that of his faithful disciple, \\'as exposed to
public vie\v. Then the Babis, by bribing the sentinels, succeeded
in getting possession of it and transferred it to a shrine near
Teheran, \vhich the Bab himself had before appointed as his grave.

The chief of the new religion was dead and, according to the
calculations of the prime minister, Mirza. Taki Khan, the most

profound peace ought to be established and the etnpire be no
1nore troubled from the side of this obstinate heresy. But this
was one of those cases that needed something more than political
experience and sagacity. If the prime minister had taken the

pains to study the doctrines of the n ew fait.h, he would have
kno\vn that the perpetuity of the sect was not bound up with the

took a special interest in the youth, still in his .teens, filling
him with the milk "whereof the savor altereth not." At the
time of the siege of the fol'tress of Sheykh Tabarsi, the young
man and his elder brother, Beha, sought to aid the besieged, but
were captured and for a time imprisoned. On account of his
ardor in the cause and his high position among the Persian
nobility, he was made the fourth of the "Letters of the Living;"
and when the leaders preceding him in the apostolic line had
perished in the conflicts in Mazandaran, the Bab, in order that
there might be "no intermission in God's grace," no1ninat~d
Mirza Yahya as the next head of the church under the title
Subh-i-Ezel (the Morning of Eternity) or Hazrat-i-Ezel (His
Holiness the Eternal). He also sent him his personal effects and
the holy rings according to the number of the Unity (19). Subh-
i-Ezel, as he is usually called, at once took up the superintendence
of the Babi church. Seeking a place of retirement where he
thought himself safe, he engaged in tl'anscribing and circulating
the Babi books, expounding the doctrine, and comforting ancl
encouraging the church by his epistles.

But the many fervid and ambitious spirits who had been
wrought up to a high pitch of enthusiasm by t~e theophanies and
transcendental mysteries of the new faith were by no means con-
tent to leave this prize of Divinity to this youth of twenty-three
without a stl'uggle. The first manifestation of the "Blessed T1·ee
of the Eternal " was an illiterate confectioner, eighteen years of
age, called Zabih. His devotees exalted him as "the lt<Ianifesta-
tion of the Everlasting, the mystery uncreate, the eternal essence."
"From the reed bed " of the young confectioner's wisdom, they
declared, " grew sugar-canes of affection." " His walking was
the glory of God, bis looking the .influence of God, his silence
wisdom, and by bis S\veet sn1ile he introduced a new joy into the
very Essence of Heavenly Bliss." Next a blind seer and mystic,
.Tenab-i-Basir, called the Indian Believer, about \vhom many
signs and wonders clustered, "manifested himself." He claimed
to be a return of the Imam Huseyn and a Gate of the two masters
(the Bab and Subh-i-Ezel) and that his godhead was proved by
the greatest of all signs, " to wit, verses spontaneously uttered."
Jenab-i-Azim also made the same claim, but hesitated to put it to
the test of improvising verses, and there was much heart-burning
and wrangling among the followers of each. A.t Tabriz, at Fars,
and at Baghdad also, manifestations of the Godhead, "sprin-
klings from the ocean of Divinity" appeared. and their various

or years he or she had been in confinement (as had the prophet-
ess, "Consolation of Eyes"). Some of these, especially those
who had influential friends, succeeded in convincing the govern-
n1ent of their innocence of the conspiracy. But twenty-eight of
the leaders were doomed to execution. To divert exclusive
responsibility for these executions from the court, the ministry
and the ordinary administrators of the law, the astute but horri-
ble plan was formed of compelling representatives of every class
in the capital, from the princes and secretaries of state down to
the merchants, professo1·s and common people, to torture and
execute the victim appointed to their r espective class. Several vic-
tims \vere hacked in pieces with knives; one was blown from the
mouth of a gun, after his eyes had first been plucked out; another
was stoned to death ; another had iron nails driven into his feet
and head. Mullah Fathu'llah, the eon of the one \vho fired the
shot at the S hah, had holes cut into his body into which lighted
candles were inserted, and then, after this kind of torture had
gone on for a time, he was hacked in pieces with knives. Suley-
man Khan and Kasim of Niriz, two of the mqst distinguished
Babis, first had lighted candles inserted in deep cuts made in
their bodies for the purpose, and thus were paraded through the
streets to the sound of minstrelsy. Glowing iron shoes were next
nailed to their naked feet and their teeth and nails pulled one
by one. These frightful tortures were borne with marvelous
fortitude, and the victitns through their long agony ceased not to
testify their joy that they should have been. worthy to suffer mar-
tyrdo1n for their Master's cause. .Suleyman Khan, the Bab's
former scribe, even sang and recited verses of poetry. "Why do
you not dance," asked his executioners mockingly, "since you find
death so pleasant ? " " Dance l " cried the Babi martyr. " Yes !

in one hand the wine-cup, in one hand the tresses of the Friend-
such a dance in the midst of the market place is my desire."

Last, but not least, among the victims of this devilish ven·
> geance was the beautiful and accomplished Kurratu'l-Ayn, the
> prophetess "Consolation of Eyes." For the preceding two or
> three years she had been kept in prison in the house of Mahmud
> Khan, the Kalantar at Teheran. Like every one else who came
> in contact with this most captivating woman, the Kalantar was
> fascinated by her, and extended to her every favor and comfort
> consistent with the discharge of his duty. Having been closely
> confined for so long a time, it was plain that " Consolation of
> Eyes" could have had no hand in the conspiracy. But, as she
was the idol of the Babis and an immense source of strength to
their cause, it was determined to remove her for good and all,
unless she would recant. If she would but abjure her faith, she
might be released at once, she was assured. But her noble spirit
scorned such cowardice and disloyalty. She was ready for mar-
tyrclom and glad to seal her faith with her blood. .Al; with the
others, her death was made as painful and lingering as the inge-
nuity of her cruel executioners could devise, but she met it with
what one who witnessed it was compelled to call "a superhuman
fortitude."

The Shah and his ministers expected by these horrible punish-
ments to strike such terror into the Babis as to put an end, from
that time on, to the accursed here~y. But they had overshot the
mark. The heroism of the martyrs made a deeper impression
than the severities of the government. Not an apostate was
found. Even their executioners were imbued with admiration
for the courage and devotion of the Babis. The public curiosity
to kno\v more about these doctrines, and the popular expectation
of a great career in the future for a religion which could com-
1nand such astonishing consecration and self-sacrifice were raised
to an extraordinary pitch. As Gobineau says - "That one day
gave the Bab more secret partisans than all his preachings could
have gained." Soon, in the province of Niriz, there was a new
rising. The governor \Vas killed, and only after some time was
tlie insurrection put down. Again the government accompanied
its victory with horrible but ineffectual crnelties, visited upon the
heads of the vanquished wom"en and children as well as men.

After a time, however, there came a lull. The Babi leaders
adopted a new policy, - the policy of concealment and secret
propagandism, avoiding all open conflicts with the government.
It was under the direction of a new leader, Mirza Huseyn Ali,
called Beha.'u'llah, a half brother of Subh-i-Ezel (the successor of
the Bab) that this took place. Subh-i-Ezel, to save his life, dis-
guised himself and fled, and for a long time remained hidden.
\'Vhen, at length, he ventured to reappear, it was across the
frontier , in Turkish territory. As he was more of a scholar and
a devotee than a man of affairs, the interests of the Babi church
were plainly beginning to suffer. Too many new claimants of
the headship, new incarnations of Godhead, ~·ere allowed to
1nauifest themselves and distract the church. The Ba.bis were
allo,ved to take up a too irreconcilable attitude towards the Per-
sian authorities.
1897.]                Babism and the Bab.                      743

Beha'u'llah, thirteen years older than his brother, and a man of
more resolute spirit and executive ability, to whom much of the
administrative work of the church had been already intrusted,
became convinced that Subh-i-Ezel was not equal to the situation.
A community of religious enthusia.'!ts, revolutionaries, visionaries
and speculative mystics (for of such material the Babi church
was in great n1easure composed) needed a firmer hand than bis
gentle and contemplative half-brother could supply. For a while
the practical and determined Beha'u'llah managed things in l1is
brother's name. But at length he concluded that he n1ight as
well have the official position as be the unrevered power behind
the throne. It was not a difficult thing to do. He had but to
proclaim himself as the real Point of Revelation, the long ex-
pected One who was to appear, of whose greater glory and full
Divinity in the time to come the Bab had at first prophesied. As
all the Babis agreed, the sign of " Him whom God shall mani-
fest," who was to' perfect and complete the Babi religion, was the
revelation of verses. This \Vas a very easy miracle, and so in the
year 1866 or 1867, at Adrianople, whither the Babi exiles had
been removed because of the strife and disordel'l:I they had created
while at Baghdad, Beha'u'llah " revealed " sundry signs in elo-
quent Arabic and Persian wherein he summoned all the Babis to
acknowledge him as their supreme and sole chief and spiritual
guide. Beha'u'llah was to be revered as the final Point or Goal
of Revelation, to whom all the verses and prophecies of the Bab
had pointed, and the Bab was no longer to be looked upon as a
veritable manifestation of the Divine but as a mere precursor of
the more perfect theophany of Beha'u'llah. Subh-i-Ezel, \vho had
been the appointed successor and for so many years had been re·
vered as their authoritative teacher and incarnation of heavenly
wisdom and virtue, was to be branded as the " First Letter of
Denial" of the New Dispensation.

This proclamation shook the Babi church to its centre and the
communities were rent asunder by the most bitter of schisms.
The majority of the Ba.bis, especially the younger, accepted Be-
ha'u 'llah as their master. The older leaders, who had been per-
sonal friends of the Bab and had exposed their lives in his behalf,
stood stanchly by his nominee, the gentle visionary Subh-i-Ezel.

But, one by one, they dropped away, victims of the unscrupulous
violence of their rivals. . Two of the Letters of tpe Living, the
original apostles, were assassinated, one at Tabriz, the other at
Kerbela. At Adrianople and. Acre half a dozen more of the
elder leaders, who stood by Ezel, were stabbed or poisoned by the
followers of Beha. From sixteen to twenty of the older leaders

soon as he was established in his authority, he began to exercise
·the privilege which all the Ba.bis recognized as belonging to the

final Point of Revelation, to abrogate, change, develop and super-
sede the ea1·lier revelations. He discouraged the visionary specu-

rise of the Bab and his church was written over in an entirely
new vein ; the Bab was represented as a mere forerunner of
Beha; Su.bh-i-Ezel was described as a coward and fugitive; his
earlier friends, Hazrat-i-Kuddus and " ·Consolation of Eyes,"
were craftily depreciated ; and Beha'u'llah and his Neo-Babi
doctrines were profusely glorified, and every expression of detes-
tation of the Shah which might interfere with Beha's new policy
of conciliating the government was eliminated. The effort to

metamorphose thus radically the whole record of Babism fortu-
nately failed through the fact that many of the early. documents
had previously passed into European hands ; but the effort to
establish pacific relations with the Persian government proved
successful, and for thirty years the Babis have been free from
public persecution; by a secret propaganda they have so diffused
their doctrines that their numbers are now estimated at half a
million or more.

We will now briefly consider the Babi literature. The writ-
ings of the Bab are extremely voluminous ; one of his followers
claimed that he wrote not less than a million verses. In general
they are called the Beyan, or Exposition, although in a more spe-
cial sense this term is applied only to such compositions as have
the form of Arabic verse, a form considered preeminently in-
spired. Besides the Arabic verses, th~re are the Commentaries
on the Sura of Joseph, the Bismillah and the W a'l-asr, and a
larger Commentary on the Kuran ; the Book of Recompense, the
Book of Names, the Book of Figures and a large number of
Prayers, Supplications and miscellaneous writings. Suhh-i-Ezel
wrote "The Book of Light " and many other works. Mr. E. G.
Browne, who has made a more thorough study of these books
than any other European, says they contain " noble ideals, subtle
metaphysical conceptions, and splendid though ill-defined aspira-
tions. . . . But they are so lost in trackless mazes of rhapsody
and mysticism, so weighed down by trivial injunctions and im-
practicable ordinances that no casual reader can hope to find
them."

The leading doctrine is that of the Manifestations. Outside
of God there is no other God. · From Him all existences ema-
nate ; but they suffer diminution and imperfection in so doing.
The world emanates from divinity by the action of seven attri-
butes or letters; force, power, will, action, condescension, glory
and revelation. In the sympathetic stream that passes between
the Infinite and the finite, God shows his living nature by his

continued relations with his creatures. All the great prophet.&
and sages. are words of God ; they come from him more really
and return to him more directly than other men. As men can-
not know the eternal essence of God but only the manifestation
of the Divine Will, there occur from time to time incarnations
of the Primal Will. Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, were
all such intermediaries between God and man. Each was suc-
cessively more full of truth and grace than his predecessor, and
revealed sufficient for the time. All these Theophanies are iden-
tical in their essence, and differ only in circumstance, just as
the sun which shines to-day is the same as the sun which shone
yesterday. The periods when these great prophets or Imams
flourish are the Theophanic Days, and the periods between are
the periods of Occultation. But even in this night, the last
Revealer still lives in concealment and communicates with his fol-
lowers by certain Gates. When the Revealer is about to reincar-
nate himself again, this great event is preceded by a number of
prophetic Gates or C hannels of communication.

After these new Gates or seers appear, and schisms and certain
other signs are observed, then the Heaven of Will, the Proof of
God, manifests himself. Coupled with this doctrine is a curious
belief called that of "the Return." In the first Vahid or section
of nineteen chapters in the Beyan it is asserted that Muhammad,
the great prophet, Fatima, his daughter, the twelve Imams and
the Four Gates (who followed the Twelfth Imam) have returned
to the life of the world with such as believed in them. Io the
second Vahid, it is taught that by the Resurrection is meant the
new Manifestation; by the Questioning of the Tomb, the tidings
of it brought by its messengers to those who slumber in igno-
rance ; by the Raising of the Dead, the awakening of those who
lie thus dead in ignorance, and so on ; the ideas which prevail of
a corporeal resurrection, a material heaven and hell, and the like
are mere figments of the imagination. Hl!-ji Mirza Jani, the
Babi historian, who had been a personal friend and follower of
the Bab, declares that this doctrine of the Return means neither
incarnation, absorption nor transmigration. But he admits t11at
" none knoweth it save those who have returned ; " and, if it is
not substantially a doctrine of soul-transmigration it is difficult to
say what it is. Not only in the Apostles of the Unity, but also in
the bosom of all the faithful, according to their respective careers
and missions, does this communication of the divine and reincar-
nation of the great of the past occur. When one of them was

1897.]                Babism and the Bab.                         747

found fulfilling a certain role which recalled that of some holy
saint preceding him, it was said among the Babis, " That is the
lmam-Riza, or Ali, or Jesus Christ, returned." .Although the
Babis constantly affirm their fidelity to the doctrine of Divine
Unity, it is plain that we have here very patent germs of a
luxuriant polytheism, and if the religion goes on we shall one day
have personal cults, symbols and temples. Is it, after all, the
long smothered spirit of ancient paganism that is reasserting itself ·
so strangely against the too bare and hard monotheism of Islam
which had been imposed upon it by force of arn1s?

.A second peculiar doctrine of Babism is the sacred character
of the number 19. .As the word ahyy, "he who gives life," has
19 for its numerical equivalent, this, it was argued, is the divine
num her. .As the world is only a di vine emanation and . rests ·on
these same principles of life, this number 19 is found at the basis
of all things rightly organized. Over the whole world this num-

> ber should reign. .Accordingly the Bab ordered his followers to
> reconstitute all divisions of time and space according to the
> sacred number. In the Babi year there were to be 19 months;
> and every month should have 19 days, every day 19 hours, and
> every hour 19 minutes. All measures of length and weight .
> were also revolutionized by a division into 19. In the courts,
> the temples and the ecclesiastical organizations, eve~ything was
> to be regulated by the same numerical cycle. Naturally, there-
> fore, the .Apostles, or "Letters of the Living," as the Bab poeti-
> cally called them, were eighteen, who, with the Bab, constitute
> again the sacred number. It is worthy of notice that, although
> the Bab is the Point, the Divine Manifestation, yet it is not in
> him by himself that this virtue is held to be seated, but in that
> Divine Unity formed by this inspired college of 19. Hence,
> when the Bab was put to death, the divine wisdom and authority
> which resided in him, constituting him the Point of Revelation,
> did not cease to be, but joined itself to the activity residing in the
rest of the sacred college, and the signs of the Godhead appeared

> in the next in dignity among the sacred Letters. At the last
> Judgment, the Point of Revelation is to preside. .All the pure,
> in recompense for their virtue, will have given to them the full
> revelation of truth : thus prepared, they will be united with God,
> to live eternally with Him participating in all his perfections and
happiness. The wicked will be annihilated.

On the earth, when the Babi faith comes to its own, there will
be established a faith at once monarchical, theocratic and demo-
cratic. On the places where the Babi leaders died as martyrs,
the holiest sanctuaries will be built. In the temples, there will
be employed the most precious materials and richest stuffs and
every kind of costly decoration, with lofty thrones for the priests.
The faithful will have talismans, - star-shaped apiulets in which
they can put entire confidence. In the Babi state, when it cau
he set up, the unbelievers who reject the Bab will have no legal
rights. All their property may rightly be taken from them, and
five provinces, at the very heart of the Persian empire, a.re named
in which they a.re not even t.o be allowed to reside. When a
t.own or province of the unbelievers is conquered, one fifth of the
spoils belongs t.o the Head of the Church ; then the warriors are
to take what they need, and the rest is given t.o the poor; but the
lives of the unbelievers are not t.o be taken simply because of
unbelief.

The &bis need not engage in public prayer, except upon spe-
cially sole1nn occasions, and the ablutions and the doctrines of
ceremonial impurity of which the Moslems make so much are
entirely abrogated, since they give God neither pain nor pleasure.
These two reforms would remove very great sources of national
and religious friction, and be a genuine service (say those who
know the East) to Oriental society. To the government, a cer-
tain tax, or per cent, on every miskal of gold or silver is due. If
one pays, he fulfills his duty. If he does not, be should not be
constrained, but the punishment should be left to God. The
penalties and chastisements allowed by Babism are very mild.
The death penalty is never mentioned. Torture and blows are
formally prohibited. The legal penalties are of two kind.s. The
first is a fine nineteen times the injury, or some higher multiple of
nineteen, according t.o the gravity of the case. The second kind
of penalty consists in interdiction of conjugal indulgences for a
number of days or months, according to the gravity of the trans-
gression. For example, if a man strikes a child be is prohibited
from approaching his wife for ninety days. Begging, so common
in the East, and regarded as rather meritorious than involving
any disgrace, is strictly forbidden . Everything belongs t.o God,
and the rich hold their wealth only in trust for Him and must
give liberally to the cause of religion and to those who have not
enough.

The Bab encouraged commerce and recommended tranquillity
of mind, affectio~te relations and an extreme politeness. Di&-
cussion should be avoided. The books of the faith are t.o be dili-

1897.]               Babiam and the Bab.                      749

gently studied, but writings alien to the Babi doctrine should be
avoided and even destroyed. Asceticism is reproved. The Babis
should not fear that which gives pleasure. Rich clothes, silken
goods, embroideries and jewels not on~y may, but ought to be pro-
cured and enjoyed by the faithful, according to the measure of
their resources. Especially at weddings should those who are
able, adorn themselves richly ; but, if they are not able, they
should not mourn, for their Lord, at the Last Judgment, will
bestow on his faithful servants these rewards.

The Bab attached extreme importance to marriage and to the
establishment and upholding of the family, - that great desid-
eratum in Asiatic civilizations. To continue the family line is
a religious duty, and after eleven years of age marriage is recom-
mended. A second wife is permitted but not recommended.
Concubinage, a common vice of the East, is severely interdicted.
These were important measures in the interest of woman. But
the Bab did not content himself with these. He also prohibited
divorce and abrogated the use of the veil. The great plague of
Persian and most Moslem societies is not so much the license they
give to have more than one wife, but the freedom which the laws
of divorce allow to the husband to change his wife at any moment
and on the most frivolous pretext. The transitory nature of the
usual 1narriage has done much more than polygamy or concubin-
age to deprave the relations of the sexes and render real marriage
unions impossible. Most women from twenty-two to twenty-four
years old, says Gobineau, have had two or three husbands. The
Bab struck at these disorders by prohibiting divorce except in
cases of extreme necessity, and then only after waiting a year,
and by interdicting the covering of woman's face with the veil,
- a c:iustom, Eastern observers say, which gives especial oppor-
tunity and encouragement to the most unprincipled intrigues.
Those who became Babis were to associate together freely,
though discreetly, without regard to sex: at the hospitable table
which the well-to-do Babi was to spread, women as well as men
were to be admitted. \Vomen might also go on pilgrimages ; but
they were to be encouraged rather to attend to their homes and
children; if they go on a pilgrimage, they are to be very careful
about over-fatigue or danger to their health. No child is to
receive a blow before five years of age : after that time it must
not receive more than five blows at a time and these must not be
on the bare skin. Parents should desire the young to laugh, play
games and to do everything which will make them happy. Men

750                   Babirm and the Bab.              [December,
should not drink wine or smoke opium, or wear beards, but shave
their faces ; they should never forsake their own country nor
leave their families to take journeys, nor read any but religious
books.

Such is the Babi Utopia. If the sect could obtain such a
majority as to put it into practice, it would certainly make a great
revolution in Persia. The Babis have been accused of being
communists, of allowing nine husbands to one woman, of drink·
ing wine and of indulging in all sorts of promiscuous license
in the love feasts to which their women come unveiled. But
the universal testimony of tho11e who know them is that. on the
contrary, they are distinguished as a body by an unusually high
standard of morality. They are. temperate, chaste, pious, pure,
self-sacrificing, and of late years ·peaceable and obedient to the
laws, at least outwardly. They still look and wait for the time
when "the just shall inherit the earth," and they firmly believe
that they, the disciples of the Bab, are the persons to whom that
final triumph is promised.

The future of the Babists it is difficult to predict. They have
abandoned the idea of open conflict and adopted the plan of a
secret propaganda which does not even hesitate, in case of need,
at denying their belief under oath. It is possible, therefore, that
the glowing faith which courageously confronted the most fright-
ful tortures and filled princes with dread of dire convulsions
may, like the flame of Anabaptist zeal in Germany, cool down to
tepid respectability, accommodate itself to the world and simply
add one more to the many obsaure sects of the Orient.

On the other hand, we must remember the weakness of the
Persian power and the activity of these dreamers of a new king-
dom of heaven on earth. The unhesitating faith, the burning
enthusiasm, the heroic martyrdoms and the fearless loyalty of the
Babis, belong to all ages and classes ; their devotion "inspires
respect in .t he indifferent and strikes profound terror in their
adversaries." When we think of these things it will not seem
improbable that some day there may be " a Manifestation " and
explosion, both political and religious, in that ancient country
which will work as great a revolution as Muhammad in the
seventh century wrought in Arabia and Syria.
