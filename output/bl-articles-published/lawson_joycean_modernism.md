Joycean Modernism in a Nineteenth-
Century Qur’an Commentary?
A Comparison of the Bab’s Qayyūm al-

asmā’ with Joyce’s Ulysses

Todd Lawson
We are the first generation in the West able to read the Koran, if we are able to
read Finnegans Wake. ~ Norman O. Brown1

Introduction

N        umerous structural, thematic, and reception parallels exist

> between two otherwise quite incommensurable literary works. The
> one is James Joyce’s well-known, controversial and vastly influential
Ulysses, generally considered the first major work of the modernist move-
ment in European literature. The second, entitled Qayyūm al-asmā’,2 is the
virtually unknown, unpublished and unread yet highly distinctive and un-
usual commentary on the 12th sura of the Qur’an by the Iranian prophet
Seyyed Ali Mohammad Shirāzi (1819–50), better known to history as the Bab.
By suggesting the existence of parallels and similarities between these two
works it is not also suggested that there is any sort of connection between
them or their authors, genetic, social, historical, or otherwise. But, both au-
thors wrote at specific and intense moments of cultural crisis and change
in their respective socio-historical situations. And each was profoundly and
acutely aware of the particular centrality of the literary tradition in which
they wrote and the literary weight of the sources and models for their
respective compositions. In the case of Joyce and Ulysses, the weight and

2. “Sustainer of the Divine Names” There are two other titles for this extraordinary com-
position: Commentary on the Chapter of Joseph (Qur’an 12)/Tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf and The Best of Sto-
ries/Aḥsan al-qaṣaṣ. Qayyūm al-asmā’ – though difficult to translate properly – is probably the
most common. See Todd Lawson, Gnostic Apocalypse in Islam: Qur’an, Exegesis, Messianism, and the

authority of this literary history is represented by the Odyssey and Joyce’s
appropriation (and simultaneous celebration and critique) of the epic tra-
dition, exemplified by the Odyssey. In the case of the Bab and his Qayyūm
al-asmā’, the quite considerable and truly unique weight and authority of
his tradition is represented by the Qur’an, on which this ostensibly exegeti-
cal work is modeled.3 In actuality, with this composition, which is better
thought of as being in the disguise of exegesis, the Bab is claiming the same
authorial independence and originality exemplified by the Qur’an itself. The
adoption of the similarly monumental and sacrosanct genre of scriptural
exegesis (tafsīr) for this disguise is only a little less daring than the Qur’an
imitation that it “hides.” Our author, a merchant by profession and class,
came from outside the typical learned class and was indeed unschooled in
the Islamic sciences according to prevailing standards. He was also only 25
years old at the time of writing and would have thus been regarded as far too
immature, even were he of the scholarly class, to attempt such a work. The
grandiosity and brashness of presuming to compose a new Qur’an is analo-
gous to Joyce’s rewriting the epic in his Ulysses, but actually outstrips it in
terms of outrageousness because of the Qur’an’s unique place in Islamic reli-
gious scholarship and culture. In both authors their work is simultaneously
a literary fiction paying homage to tradition and an authentic occasion for
unprecedented – if not shocking – originality. This is the primary structural
analogy: both the Odyssey and the Qur’an (and its traditional exegesis) oc-
cupy monumental and epic space in their respective cultural contexts, and
both will appear to be deeply violated and disfigured by our authors. Such
innovative, thoroughgoing and self-conscious imitation and improvisation
on these venerable symbols and metonyms of culture had not been previ-
ously achieved or attempted to the degree we have in these two works.4 (See
below figures 1 & 2). In what follows, we will give some brief introduction
to the generally well-known life and celebrated works of James Joyce, some
necessarily more extended introduction to the much less well-known life
and works of the Bab. After this, we will focus on a comparison of the two
works at hand to illustrate formal and thematic similarities. This compari-
son will focus on a few major topics: (1) the formal structure of the two
works and (2) the thematic concerns of the two works, such as (a) time, (b)
polarities or oppositions and their resolution, (c) the relation between form

James Joyce and His Work
James Joyce (1882–194) was born in Dublin, acquired from the Jesuits a
thorough education including the classics and theology, excelled as a
scholar of modern languages at University, and at the young age of
twenty-two left Ireland, more or less for good, in 1904. He is considered the
father of literary modernism because of his two major books, Ulysses and
Finnegans Wake. Both works represent radical innovations in the art of the
novel and changed forever the way literary art was construed and
practiced. The works were also highly controversial, attracting censorship,
ban, derision, and condemnation on the grounds of obscenity and general
structure and style of which the famous (or infamous) “stream of
consciousness” (perfected by Joyce) was a major feature and which
challenged the reader in ways no earlier work of literary art had done.
Today, Joyce has been vindicated and recognized as a great literary genius.
No less an authority than Northrop Frye deems his Finnegans Wake a
uniquely powerful example of literary art in our time.5 The library of Joyce
scholarship is massive, with commentaries, concordances, dedicated
journals, analyses, appreciations, imitations, criticism and explications de
texte seemingly without number. During his life he struggled with poverty,
ill-health and family crises and is distinguished by his heroic dedi-cation to
his art – which he never abandoned, even momentarily.6 In the case of the
author of the older Arabic work, there is really no reason to believe readers
should have even the barest notion of who he was. In fact, one of the
somewhat ironic facts that the present comparison records is that on the
one hand, in the case of Ulysses, a daring literary experiment resulted in
universal renown (and/or infamy), celebrity and veneration, highly
productive literary influence and a continuous tradition of scholarship
devoted to the study of Joyce and his works.7

ible word hoard of humor, wit, erudition, and symbolism; it never, for me, degenerates into a
mere puzzle, but always has on every page something to astonish and delight.” Northrop Frye,

tion.)

The Bab and His Work
The daring literary experiments of the Bab resulted in the opposite: obscu-
rity, disregard, contumely, and ultimate imprisonment and death by firing
squad.8 The literary innovations of the text were not pursued or emulated by
later authors because of such extra-literary and extra-artistic factors as the
deeply embastioned cultural and religious attitudes toward the Qur’an as
inimitable and final revelation. It will be of some useful interest to provide a
very brief outline of this author’s life and career before continuing further
with the more purely literary comparison of the two works, Ulysses and the
Qayyūm al-asmā’. “The Bab” is an Anglicization of the Arabic al-bāb, the usual
word for “door” or “gate” in that language. In the present instance, it func-
tions as a title with a very long history, especially in Shi‘i Islamic religious
literature. The general understanding is that the word designates one who
represents the twelfth or hidden Imam of Ithna-‘ashari (so-called Twelver)
Shi‘ism, even though it is clear that the word has frequently indicated sta-
tuses other than mere representative to suggest the Imam and the prophet
himself. It is also true that in the Islamic philosophical tradition the intellect
was frequently termed “the gate” [to knowledge].9

The Bab was born in Shiraz in 1819 into a family of merchants. His
precocity and piety caused remark and anxiety amongst his family, and
teachers were challenged by his intellect and originality. The time, accord-
ing to Shi‘i sacred history, was propitious and pregnant with eschatological
event, it being 1,000 years since the disappearance of the long-awaited hid-
den Imam. In his early twenties, the Bab abandoned the life of a merchant to
join the circle of a prominent millenarian teacher based in the holy shrine
cities of Iraq. This teacher, Seyyed Kāzem Rashti (1793–1844), was a learned
Persian mulla and mujtahid and successor to the Arab polymath, philosoph-
ical theologian, and mujtahid Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsā’i (1753–1826). These

substitute for reading the major works of Joyce himself, beginning with the collection of short
stories, Dubliners (1914), The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), Ulysses (1922) and finally
Finnegans Wake (1939). In what follows, reference to Ulysses will be indicated by U, standing for
James Joyce, Ulysses (New York: Vintage Books, 1961), to Finnegans Wake by FW, standing for
James Joyce, Finnegans Wake (London: Penguin Books, 1992).

8. The work may be thought to have had quite considerable influence from another an-
gle, inasmuch as it was the first announcement of a powerful if short-lived messianic move-
ment in Iran which ultimately led to the rise and world-wide expansion of the Baha’i Faith. But
this is not literary influence as usually understood.

two teachers had, on the brink of the Twelver Shi‘i eschaton, attracted a
large following especially of young seminarians, because of their creative
and compelling interpretation of the standard topics of Shi‘ism, including
the idea of the return of the hidden Imam, the imminent resurrection and
day of judgment (qiyāma), or rising of the Qā’im who, as Mahdi (“rightly
guided one”), would lead an army of spiritual warriors against the forces of
darkness at the end of time. This following, which burgeoned throughout
Iran during the middle half of the nineteenth century came to be known
as the Shaykhiyya – “the Shaykhis” – an eponymous reference to the above-
mentioned Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsā’i. The main thrust of the eschatological
teaching of the first two masters of the Shaykhi School was that while the
return of the hidden Imam is assured, the end of time and creation is not.
Rather, what ends is a cycle of prophecy that will be replaced by a new cycle
of fulfillment.10 They furnished a vocabulary and method for thinking about
and perhaps domesticating the potentially unruly and mysterious forces
that were gathering at the time and would issue in profound social and his-
torical change. In short, they provided a discourse for the emergence of a
distinctive Qajar modernity from its traditional past.11 There was also much
about the form and content of the Shaykhi doctrine that appealed to an
Iranian audience; not least, was the way in which the masters of the school
combined the mystical with the rational in the interest of solving the many
supra-rational problems confronting Shi‘i religion. In addition, the prolific
writings of the first two teachers are characterized by a strong literary and
poetic aesthetic very much in keeping with the general élan of Islamicate
scholarship in which style is as important as substance. In the case of the
Shaykhis, their technical terminology, deriving from the broader Islamic
philosophical and mystical tradition, is at times transmuted into a kind of
poetry of metaphysics. Thus, one may also be justified in thinking of it as
a literary movement as well as a theological movement in which theologi-
cal connections and resonances have literary value and literary connections

10. A specifically Viconian cyclism eventually would be adopted by Joyce, not in Ulysses,
but rather in his last work, Finnegans Wake. However, cyclicism is not absent from Ulysses, as
will be seen.

and resonances have theological implications. Such a movement and such a
discourse was evidently irresistible for our author, Seyyed Ali Mohammad
Shirāzi (1819–50), soon to become known as the Bab. And he, accordingly,
abandoned his career as a merchant to study at the feet of Seyyed Kāzem
Rashti. At the time of composition of the work at hand, his beloved teacher
had died and his followers were left to search or wait for the realization of
the Shi‘i eschaton: the return of the hidden Imam, the promulgation of the
true Qur’an, the establishment of justice throughout the world through the
defeat of the forces of darkness and the establishment of the rule of the
Mahdi. At the time, this doctrine had generated numerous interpretations
and was teeming with a variety of possibilities including (1) the appearance
of a general age of enlightenment, as distinct from (2) the actual triumph of
an individual messianic figure, or to (3) a combination of both.12

Composition of the Qayyūm al-Asmā’
We have precise, if enchanting, details of how the Bab came to compose his
revelatory exegesis, the Qayyūm al-asmā’. As these circumstances are insepa-
rable from the resulting literary form of the work, it is important briefly to
relate them. The actual composition began during a meeting with one of
the senior students of the recently deceased Kāzem Rashti, the young and
talented mulla, Hoseyn Boshru’i (1813–49). Upon the death of Rashti, he,
together with a few companions, set out from Karbala in quest of the long-
awaited advent: the manifestation of the hidden Imam and the beginning of
the new cycle of fulfillment. Their search had taken them to Shiraz where
Boshru’i encountered the young merchant, Ali Mohammad (the Bab), whom
he had apparently known from his Karbala sojourn. The year was 1844CE
(1260AH) and our author was 25 years old. He invited Mulla Hoseyn to his
home and there, in discussions about how the hidden Imam was to be identi-
fied, the Bab is said to have suggested that he himself could be the promised
one as he fulfilled many of the descriptions outlined in the traditions. Mulla
Hoseyn, nonplussed by what he took as unwonted arrogance and perhaps
thinking to quench the impudent and impertinent messianic pretensions
of his host, remembered to himself that their teacher, Seyyed Kāzem Rashti,
had added to the list of requirements and physical attributes that would
identify the promised one another more purely literary requirement: the
promised one would compose a commentary of the Qur’an’s Sura of Joseph.
At this point, so the story goes, the Bab, apropos of apparently nothing, an-
nounced that it was now time for him to reveal the commentary on the Sura

of Joseph and then proceeded to write the first of the 111 chapters of this
highly unusual work, the Sūrat al-mulk, the Chapter of Divine Dominion or
Ownership.13 So important is this literary event in the mind of the author,
its date is fixed in Babī and Baha’i scripture: 22 May 1844, corresponding to
the early evening of the Islamic date 5 Jumada I, 1260, almost exactly 1000
(lunar) years since the assumption of the Imamate by the “hidden” Twelfth
Imam, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Askari in the year 260AH/874CE. In ad-
dition, the actual astro-chronological moment for the beginning of the new
cycle is fixed by the Bab, in a later work, at 2 hours and 11 minutes after
sunset on that date.14 Amanat is doubtless correct when he suggests that this
unusual precision in timing the beginning of the long-awaited resurrection,
the day of judgment, represents the moment when Mulla Hoseyn assented
to the Bab’s claim.15

The author of the completed commentary, which he tells us was com-
posed over a forty-day period, eventually attracted a large and active
messianic following, known to Iranian Religious history as the Babi religion.
Announcing that with these new revelations the new cycle of fulfillment
had been inaugurated and the qiyāma, the resurrection and day of judgment,
were now in play, it was now necessary to recognize the Bab as the source
and focus of all religious authority, the word for which in Islamic theological
terminology is walāya/wilāya (Persian valāyat/velāyat). His mission would last
nearly six years until he was executed in Tabriz for blasphemy and heresy
on  July 1850. The remnants of his movement eventually formed the
Baha’i religion in which followers saw the fulfillment of prophecies found
in the remarkably voluminous writings of the Bab. These writings may be
briefly summarized as an attempt to reorient and recast the sacerdotal and
political hierarchical authority in the social imagination of Shi‘i Iran in
which the main elements were: the Prophet and the Imams (including
Fātima, the daughter of Muhammad and wife of the first Imam Ali); the
royal family,

the Qajars, their retainers and officials; the religious estate, comprising the
classically educated religious classes, and others, unevenly divided between
scripturalists and rationalists; and of course the general population of be-
lievers, the Shi‘i community.16

An attempt to clarify lines of authority in a culture, it has been sug-
gested, is also intimately related to the perennial problem of and quest for
identity, which presents a single and powerful literary theme in world lit-
erature and one of the main themes of the epic genre as such.17 The writings
of the Bab may be thought an attempt to provide orientation in a highly
turbulent period during which standard and traditional notions of identity,
authority, and allegiance were in flux and were being debated in various
quarters throughout Iranian society, from the very highest levels of court-
ly life, to the religious seminaries, to the bazaar and its environs. Another
similar attempt may be discerned in the decisive developments at this time
in understanding the “sacerdotal” office of universal authority for the Shi‘i
community, the marja‘ al-taqlīd (authoritative exemplar), closely related
to what has come to be known after WWII as the office of Grand Ayatol-
lah, a relatively recent religious innovation.18 However much the literary
activities of the Bab were fraught with profound and dramatic religious
and theological implications, in the present somewhat experimental explo-
ration, I am studying the Bab’s writings from the point of view of artistic
and literary considerations. Although it was thought important to provide
some theological background as context, in what follows, I will, as much as
possible, avoid theological and religious questions, even though there is an
obvious deep connection between the artistic/aesthetic and the religious
in Islamicate culture in general, Iranian Islamic culture more specifically,
and the life and the work of the Bab himself as heir to these cultural re-
alities and predispositions. In the case of the Bab the seamless interplay
between the artistic/aesthetic and what might be thought the more purely
“religious” dimensions of his life and ministry has been noted from the very

16. In his Risalat al-sulúk, the Bab delineates the levels of authority and application of re-
ligious truth and allegiance (God, the Prophet, the Imams and the Shi‘a) and says that they
are all dependent on each other. See Todd Lawson, “The Bab’s Epistle on the Spiritual Journey
towards God,” in Moojan Momen, ed., The Baha’i Faith and the World Religions: Papers Presented at
the Irfan Colloquia (Oxford: George Ronald, 2005), 231, 237, 241. For a discussion of these factors
from a socio-historical perspective, see Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal.

beginning.19 It now remains to focus on the two texts that are the subject of
this chapter.

Form and Sructure
The form and structure of both works suggests a veneration or sacraliza-
tion of the past and a simultaneous desire to replace the old with the new.
The following tables illustrate to some degree the way in which each work
is structured by its author to represent a reworking of two culturally cen-
tral texts, the Odyssey and the Qur’an. And because these structures are
themselves so symbolically meaningful, their adoption has implications for
thematic and narrative content.

Joyce himself made two different tables illustrating the close relation-
ship between his Ulysses and the Odyssey.20 The schema in Figure 1 was
prepared in 1921 for his friend Stuart Gilbert and demonstrates how Joyce
simultaneously took great liberties with and venerated the Odyssey, rear-
ranged it and recast its stories and myths which in the original take place
over a twenty year period (a generation), in order to fit it all within a single
day in the life of Dublin: 16 June 1904.21 Further, the events and narrative
flow of Joyce’s epic are, according to his schema, intricately coordinated
with numerous other factors and elements. Thus, the first episode, not
marked off in the actual published novel, may be identified with Telema-
chus, the name of Odysseus’ son who searches for his father and awaits his
return back home in Ithaca. There is in Ulysses a correspondence between
this and the opening scene and the time of day. Joyce also assigns to this
episode a particular color and science or art (theology) and literary tech-

occupations see Moojan Momen, “Perfection and Refinement: Towards an Aesthetics of the
Bab.”

Literary Reference to His Life and Works (New York, NY: Facts On File, 2006), 392–93 for a repro-
duction from Hugh Kenner’s finished composite of Joyce’s two schemata for his friends and
colleagues Linati and Gilbert.

21. This Joycean turn may be thought to have been anticipated by the ancient Arabian
poetic tradition, which saw in the idea of “the day” – al-yawm (pl. ayyām) – a certain epic
dignity and challenge as in “the days of the Arabs (ayyām al-‘arab),” where the word connotes
battle and the heroic resources required to survive the day through struggle for survival. The
Qur’an’s (and the Bible’s) a “day with thy Lord is as a thousand years” would also seem to
resonate: Qur’an 22:47; Psalms 90:4; 2 Peter 3:8. See Sebastian Günther, “Day, Times of,” in En-
cyclopaedia of the Qur’an, edited by Jane Dammen McAuliffe, 1:499–504 (Leiden: Brill Academic

nique (narrative). Each of the following 17 sections of the novel is similarly
structured. Thus the famous, if not notorious, Joycean stream of conscious-
ness disguises an almost unbelievably and meticulously structured work of
art. But apart from this, we may discern in this vast system of connections,
correspondences, and resonances what might be thought – and surprisingly
in this modernist literary experiment, a somewhat medieval certitude about
the essential meaningfulness and interconnectedness of life, the kind of eu-
phoric certitude that such totalizing devices as “The Great Chain of Being”
or “The Diapason” bespeak.22 In sum, Joyce takes great liberties with the
Odyssey while at the same time remaining faithful to it. Such has been char-
acterized as Joyce’s “art of mediation,” an art that seeks to negotiate the
space between two apparently diametrically opposed elements, in this case
the opposites are innovation and tradition.23

The interplay between tradition and the new is also the main focus of
the Bab’s work, whether from the point of view of structure or content. That
we find a similar web of correspondences in the Bab’s work is, perhaps, to
be expected given the medieval ontological and mystical presuppositions
of his tradition and his audience. So we see in his writing a vast grid of cor-
respondences (even if a complete table illustrating them has yet to be made)
in which climates, prophets, heavenly spheres, colors, hierarchical levels of
Being, types of individuals and so on, provide both the flesh and the skeleton
of his compositions.24 For example, many of these compositions exploit to a
very high degree the traditional abjad system of numerology, in which every
word has a numerical value to be read and considered in a given context.25
If we remain at the level of literature in comparing both compositions we
see that they embody to a remarkable degree a great deal of exquisitely and
intricately designed literary “hanging together,” much of which has to do

with the relationship of their respective works to their monumental and
epic exemplars. In Joyce’s case this model is the Odyssey. In the Bab’s case,
it is the Qur’an.26

The Sacramental Day
The Bab, like Joyce, goes to great lengths to innovate and improvise while
also preserving and honoring the sanctity of tradition. In this, one could also
refer to his as the “art of mediation.” The central narrative at the core of
the Bab’s work, the Biblical story of Joseph son of Jacob, is the epic quest of
a son for his father and a father for his son after separation. The structure
of the work, which is divided into suras (“chapters”) and āyas (“verses”), is
explicitly patterned on the Qur’an, a feature Muslims would and did consider
heretical.27 At the same time, it is clear that the Bab is also concerned with a
single day, that day outside time and space when all humanity – “God’s chil-
dren” – were gathered in God’s presence. This is the day referred to at Q7:172
and known to the Islamic tradition as the day of the covenant. In mythic
terms, it symbolizes for the Islamic tradition the birth of both consciousness
and history.28 In Qur’anic terms, it is the essential prelude for the creation of
the world as told, for example, in the Biblical book of Genesis.29 Evidence of
the Bab’s deep concern for this mythic event is woven into the very structure
of the composition, through versification (explained below) and in innumer-
able explicit textual references. The covenant and its renewal is the central
concern of the work because it supplies a sacred paradigm for the Josephian
theme of separation and reunion through the cyclicism mentioned earlier.
For the moment, suffice it to remark that the day of the covenant involves
also another day, the day of judgment. According to the Qur’an, all of human-
ity was gathered in the presence of God on the day of the covenant at a time
and place before actual creation so that they would have no excuse on the

day of judgment for not having obeyed God and his prophets. It is clear
that the Qayyūm al-asmā’ is also a new rendition or performance of the day
of the covenant.30 When Mulla Hoseyn Boshru’i accepted the claims of the
Bab, the momentousness of the act was enshrined in its exact time being
recorded in the Bab’s later book of laws, UIF 1Frsian Bayan. Such
momentousness resides in its making present the drama of the original
primordial covenant mentioned in the Qur’an (Q7:172). This was when God
interrogated Adam and all of humanity with the question: “Am I not your
Lord?” (A lastu bi-rabbikum) and to which Adam and all humanity
immediately responded “Yes! Indeed! (balā).” Here the Bab, from the
literary (metaphorical and spiritual) perspective is God – or more
accurately the face of God (wajh allāh) and Mulla Hoseyn is Adam/
Muhammad.31 And to the degree that the work is concerned with the
journey between affirmation of the covenant and judgment it may be
thought to assume a circular form where the two ends of the composition
are indicated in each other. This is of course one of the more prominent
features of Joyce’s Finnegans Wake: its end is its beginning and its beginning
is its end, what Joyce calls “Doublends Jined”(FW20).32 Such points to the
multi-layered meaning of the title: revelation/awareness, resurrection
(Wake), cyclical repetition (Man [finn] again), and the concomitant circular
nature of history, the wake of human activity. Such continuity and stability
as is represented in this totalizing design, whether of the Qayyūm al-asmā’
or Ulysses, seems to offer solace and assurance for chaotic times, in the
promise of a new day that is In the case of simultaneously and mysteriously
ancient. Joyce’s day, we have a compression of thousands of days (the 20
years of the original Odyssey) into a single 24-hour period. In the case of
the Bab’s day, it is the opposite. Rather than a condensation of time, we
have what might be thought, in musical terms, the melismatic cantillation
over ages, generations, verses, words, and syllables of the original and
originating power of that mysterious and momentous day (or moment) of
the covenant represented by the word balā – Yes! Thus the considerable
spiritual energy of the myth of the day of the covenant is joined with that
of the day of resurrection. It is not only a powerful literary trope, it is,
given the basic apocalyptic structure of the Qur’anic revelation, the central

FMement of Islamic religious consciousness, which believers are called upon
by the Qur’an continuously to remember or call to mind, the practice in-
stituted in Sufism known as dhikr (Persian zekr).33 Thus is the original (and
originating) moment present in every other moment.34 Indeed, one of the
other important titles by which the Bab refers to himself in this work is
precisely “the Remembrance” (al-dhikr) – embodiment or personification
of the day of the covenant. Both the Bab and Joyce offer an implicit com-
mentary on and radical interpretation of the idea of time and history in
relation to the nature of consciousness. They demonstrate in their respec-
tive works the subjectivity, malleability, and shape-shifting quality of time
and what the otherwise commonplace notion “day” can possibly mean. For
both authors, the extraordinary “enchanted” quality of the epiphany is in
contrast to the humdrum and “mundane” occasion of its occurrence.35 Both
the Qayyūm al-asmā’ and Ulysses in some ways turn time into a literary trope,
or, express concern with the unity and literary significance of time in inter-
esting and innovative ways demonstrating that both authors seem intrigued
by the recurrence of character types and cycles in the wake of which normal
historical and chronological time becomes transmuted into something ap-
proaching sacrament.

Ulysses came at a time in the history of the English novel when tradi-
tional notions of literature and authorial vocation were in flux. The Babi
movement also arose during a transition period in which the nature of or-
thodoxy and religious authority was being negotiated. In the first case we
use the term modernism as signal and “symptom” of the change.36 The Bab
and his audience used the word qiyāma: resurrection and judgment (Persian:
rastākhiz). The Bab takes even greater liberties with the Qur’an than Joyce
did with the Odyssey in composing this new work, one that he explicitly

times in the Qur’an. Of these, the majority of occurrences indicate the obligation and com-
mand to remember God and the day of the covenant. Remembrance is thus a major theme
of the Qur’an (as it is in Plato). For the specifically mystical aspects of the institution of the
covenant, see Gerhard Böwering, The Mystical Vision of Existence in Classical Islam: The Qur’anic
Hermeneutics of the Sufi Sahl At-Tustari (d. 283/896) (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1980).

excellence of Islam, Husain, the son of Ali, was massacred along with his family. It is a nation-
ally sanctioned holy day in Iran and observed elsewhere throughout the Muslim world.

presented as an emblem of the arrival of the resurrection: namely, the True
Qur’an that had been in the safekeeping of the hidden Imam during his oc-
cultation.37 Figure 2, below, gives some indication of the Bab’s iconoclastic
desire to compose a “new Qur’an”. Note here the pervasive use of the unique-
ly Qur’anic literary device of the mysterious disconnected letters (al-hurūf
al-muqatta‘āt) that appear in various combinations at the beginning of 29 of
the 114 suras of the Qur’an.38 As can be seen, in the Bab’s composition the
disconnected letters are used in all but four of his new suras, i.e., in almost
all 111 of them.39 We will return below to some of the other ways in which
the Bab’s work imitates the Qur’an and in some senses “out-Qur’ans” the
actual Qur’an. Suffice it here to say, that the implications of such an unprec-
edented outrage were not lost on his contemporaries. Even during the Bab’s
lifetime, a combined Sunni and Shi‘i court of Islamic jurists was convened in
Baghdad to deliberate on the legality of the provocative literary act. Their
joint fatwa condemning the author of the Qayyūm al-asmā’ for composing an
imitation of the holy Qur’an demonstrates how a contemporary audience
would be scandalized by such a daring and provocative literary event.40 As
is well known, Joyce’s work was repeatedly challenged in the courts, most
frequently for obscenity. While there is nothing that could be construed as
obscenity in the Bab’s compositions, the religious scandal his writings pro-
voked was, in the context of this cross-cultural comparison, analogous in
the intensity of the outrage it provoked.

Epic, Monomyth, and Epiphany
Both artists rethink and reconstrue their respective “monomyths” – a word
coined by Joyce in Finnegans Wake as a near synonym for the epic telling of
collective humanity’s genealogical, historical, and mythic experience. Joyce
wants us to understand the epic dignity and value of the mere quotidian: the
grand interconnectedness of the ordinary. The Bab wants us to understand
something similar, but in reverse, if you will. All time and history is a per-
petual and continuous performance of a single day, the day of the covenant.
In both Joyce and the Bab, the idea of the day acquires a distinctive sacra-

mental value: the day looms as a central integer and quantum of experience,
revelation/epiphany and being.

The epic, whether Homeric or Qur’anic, seeks, among other things, to
demonstrate or imitate the interconnectedness and therefore meaningful-
ness of experience, consciousness, and history. Such interconnectedness
may be thought a given of the Bab’s religious perspective. Joyce, forging a
new understanding of the existential and psychological realm, has Stephen
contemplate “the ineluctable modality of the visible,” the realm in which
Stephen is called upon to read “the signatures of all things.”41 The implica-
tion is, of course, that there is much else besides the visible and the sensible
to which this visible is somehow connected, even if it is only connection
itself. And, we know that much more than connection itself is indicated
namely, the great unseen and unknown inner world of the psyche or soul to
which access is gained precisely through the epiphany and which would re-
main incompletely known without it.42 Such an attitude towards the natural,
visible world has a great deal in common with the Bab’s logocentric uni-
verse where the true believer is really a true reader who has been charged
with reading and contemplating the “signs of God” that have, according to
Islamic teaching, been placed in the Qur’an, the physical universe and the
souls of human beings:

> We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in themselves, till it
> is clear to them that it is the truth. (Q41:53)

Creation, whether divine or artistic, has profound literary implications.

The Bab wishes to emphasize the interconnectedness of being-as-such
(wujūd) symbolized by the central notion of spiritual and worldly author-
ity that circulates through these three distinct “modalities”: the readable
Book, the visible Cosmos and the invisible Soul. Walāya, the word for this
authority, has a special charisma as the all-important Qur’anic divine at-
tribute which stands for religious (and, for that matter, “secular”) authority,
allegiance, guardianship, friendship, intimacy, sanctity, love, and being. The
Prophet Muhammad and the Imams were bearers of this divine quality and
as such are the sources of all authority in the cosmos (which was, in fact,
created for them), whether construed as secular and political or spiritual
and religious. The Bab as representative of the hidden Imam would also be
a bearer of this authority. Ultimately, walāya may be understood as a meta-
phor for consciousness itself: that through which all things are connected
and thus endowed with or acquire meaning. Recall that it is really walāya,

God’s guardianship, that is set in play on the mythic day of the covenant
described at Q7:172. As “divine friendship,” the notion is preeminently par-
ticipatory and renders even the most ordinary thing or event holy or sacred
through a distinctly islamicate version of holy communion.43

Coincidentia Oppositorum
Both Joyce and the Bab may be thought, therefore, to explore the possibili-
ties of what is sometimes referred to these days as an enchanted reality.
Nowhere is concern for such enchantment more palpable than in the way
both authors contemplate and demonstrate the essential fundamental unity
or resolution of oppositions – the coincidentia oppositorum of the Scholastics,
including the alchemists.44 This ancient philosophical theme has enjoyed a
similar life in both Christian European and Islamic Middle Eastern thought
where it is frequently encountered in writers of a more mystical orientation.
More than any other conceit or trope, it speaks of the paradoxical nature of
reality and calls into question such manmade notions as “good” and “evil,”
“justice” and “tyranny.” This is the apperception behind Blake’s “Fearful
Symmetry.” As a frequent feature of paradox, the coincidentia oppositorum
has, as it were, one foot in the realm of philosophy and theology and one
foot in poetics and the art of literature. There is an ongoing debate in Joyce
Studies, as to which preponderates in his thought and work. One argument
suggests that he took the idea from Bruno’s theological work and adapted it
to a more or less purely literary usage.45 Others suggest that Joyce’s interest
in and use of the coincidentia oppositorum goes deeper than this, that it indi-
cates a faith that true knowledge rises above such “logical entanglements”
as result from a slavish devotion to the epistemic value of such notions as
saved and damned, heaven and hell, up and down, here and there, past and
present, day and night and so on. Joyce’s interest in the “figure” has been
studied with regard to the final chapter of Ulysses, the Penelope episode.46

“Penelope” begins and ends with the word “yes,” emblematic of the circular-
ity of lived experience, the circle being a representation of the resolution of
polarities. The resolution of opposites is also evident in the character Mol-
ly Bloom whose heroic response “yes” to the otherwise unjustifiable and
perhaps unbearable contradictions and defeats offered by life is the goal
to which the entire novel has been traveling on its epic journey. For Joyce,
the greatest man in literature was Odysseus whom he had encountered for
the first time as a schoolboy through Charles Lamb’s retelling of the story.47
Lamb highlights how Odysseus was saved from Circe by the intervention of
the god Hermes/Mercury, who gave him the ugly and black-rooted plant
with the beautiful white flower (and the instructions how to use it) called
moly as a magical protection. The entire passage deserves to be quoted:

> But neither [Mercury’s] words nor his coming from heaven could
> stop the daring foot of Ulysses, whom compassion for the misfortune
> of his friends had rendered careless of danger: which when the god
> perceived, he had pity to see valor so misplaced, and gave him the
> flower of the herb moly, which is sovereign against enchantments. The
> moly is a small unsightly root, its virtues but little known and in low
> estimation; the dull shepherd treads on it every day with his clouted
> shoes; but it bears a small white flower, which is medicinal against
> charms, blights, mildews, and damps. “Take this in thy hand,” said
> Mercury, “and with it boldly enter her [Circe’s] gates; when she shall
> strike thee with her rod, thinking to change thee, as she has changed
> thy friends, boldly rush in upon her with thy sword, and extort from
> her the dreadful oath of the gods, that she will use no enchantments
> against thee; then force her to restore thy abused companions.” He
> gave Ulysses the little white flower, and, instructing him how to use it,
> vanished.48

In a recent study of duality in the Odyssey (having nothing directly to do
with Joyce or Joyce studies) it has been suggested that the magical power
of the moly comes from none other than its joining the opposites of mor-
tal and divine, ease and difficulty, black and white, root and flower in its

very biological and botanical structure. It was this structure and composi-
tion that rendered it a “saving device” for Odysseus.49 In short, the magical
plant, the moly, is a coincidentia oppositorum. Molly Bloom is also a coincidentia
oppositorum and may also be thought to embody a kind of salvific function.
She is: Madonna and whore, mother and daughter, good and evil, beautiful
and ugly, joyful and sad, tender and scold, dismissive and loving, jealous and
faithful; she “saves” (gives meaning to) the epic of Ulysses with her affirma-
tive engagement with life.50

Joyce’s interest in the coincidentia oppositorum as something of a foun-
dation for his personal religious and spiritual vision was, as is well known,
deeply influenced by his great admiration for the fifteenth-century “her-
etic” Giordano Bruno (1548–1600). It is from the “trope” or “device” of the
coincidence of opposites that the much-studied Joycean epiphany emerges
out of the “ineluctable modality of the visible (at least that if no more)”
(U37). This background is useful for coming to terms with Joyce’s highly
personal relationship with the numinous, as distinct from his relationship
with the Catholic church.51 It also provides a firm basis upon which to pro-
ceed with the comparison of the two otherwise literally incomparable works
examined in this essay. This basis is none other than the ontological pre-
suppositions from which and because of which the coincidentia oppositorum
and its expressive power emerges as both literary trope and philosophical
axiom. The coincidence of opposites speaks to the possibility of a noetic
experience with creation (viz: epiphany) as the “device” through which
God’s presence as imminent in matter is encountered or at least witted. It
bespeaks an adamantly non-dualistic view in which “flesh” is no longer the
enemy of “spirit” but one half of a syzygy that comprehends both and rises
above “logical entanglements”– precisely, Blake’s “fearful symmetry.” And
the description of Joyce’s epiphanic experience resonates beautifully and
harmoniously with the Islamic apophatic mysticism that was the central
pillar of the Bab’s religious universe in which Absolute Being and Reality
were frequently considered synonyms, if not “improvements,” for the word

“Allah” or “God” vis-à-vis the type of “entity” those words were meant to
indicate.52 Pointing out that Bruno himself was deeply influenced by the
pre-modern “father of the coincidentia oppositorum,” Nicholas of Cusa (1401–
1464), Voelker quotes from one of Joyce’s favorite books about his martyr
hero on the topic of Being:

> Knowledge is posterior both in time and in value to Being, or Reality,
> of which it is at best a copy or sign, hence Reality can never be wholly
> comprehended by it. Every human assertion is at best a “conjecture,”
> a hypothesis or approach to truth, but never the absolute truth itself.
> Only in the Divine spirit are thought and reality one; the divine
> thought is at the same time creative, human only reflective, imitative,
> thus the Ultimate Being is and must remain incomprehensible.53

At U782 Molly says “well who was the first person in the universe before
there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do
I so there you are” – in perfect demonstration of Brunonian apophaticism.
Molly is also singled out as expressing most perfectly the metaphysical and
poetic implications of this same Brunonian existential monism and its in-
fluence on the young Joyce, who, in a 1903 review of the then new book on
Bruno by Lewis McIntyre, wrote:

contradictions in the person of Molly, who was, as it happens, born on the
Feast of the Virgin, 8 September.55 The following underlines what might be
thought, for want of a better term, the “sacramental value” of the coincidenta
oppositorum in Ulysses56 and its apotheosis in Penelope and the character of
Molly who therefore emerges as something of simultaneous (living) martyr
saint to and high priestess of Joyce’s powerful spiritual or mystico-poetic
vision:57

This passage is revealing on another level. It provides yet another entree
into the comparison between Joyce and the Bab. In Bruno, as in the Qur’an
and the Islamic philosophical tradition, nature is not the opposite of the di-
vine but a vehicle for its expression and encounter. To one familiar with the
Qur’an, a decidedly non-dualistic book,58 it is impossible to read the above
lines without thinking of such verses as:

tioned in this passage “Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses” (U782, and else-
where in Ulysses) may allude to the ecstatic religious vision in Dante symbolized by the mul-
tifoliate rose. See William York Tindall, The Literary Symbol (New York: Columbia University

Such exemplifies a cardinal presupposition of Islam, universally applicable
regardless of which Islamic community we are studying, Sunni, Shi‘i, Sufi,
traditional or modern. This is the theory (or “doctrine”) of signs, briefly
detailed above, in which everything other than God is in fact a sign or por-
tent, precisely “epiphany” of God. This applies to the verses of the Qur’an,
the material universe including nature and its constituents, or to the ideas,
thoughts and feelings that compose the interior of the individual. Thus the
Qur’an and eventually, but not exclusively, the mystical philosophers of Is-
lam, such as Ibn al-‘Arabi (1165–1240) anticipate the theology of Eckhart
(1260–1328), Cusanus (1401–1464), and Bruno and such modern spirits as
Berdayev (1874–1948). 59

The Bab was fully at home in and indeed celebrated this deeply mystical
and religious existentialism. In addition to the centrality of Q7:172 in the
Bab’s composition, the above verse (Q41:53), much beloved by the Islamic
tradition as a whole, is quoted or alluded to literally hundreds of times in the
Qayyūm al-asmā’ as well as in other of his works.60 The two authors, Joyce and
the Bab, may have much more in common than initially suspected.61

Chaosmic Epic and Reader as Hero
All this seems to suggest that Joyce knew the Qur’an, and of course this is
true, as Atherton, McHugh, and Yared have convincingly demonstrated.62

Bruno’s indebtedness here to Cusanus has recently been questioned: Leo Catana, “The Coin-
cidence of Opposites: Cusanian and Non-Cusanian Interpretations,” Bruniana & Campanelliana

61. Another evidence of Joyce’s exposure to the Qur’an may be read in Molly’s rhetorical
question “why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they
call themselves” (U782) which is also remarkably similar to the so-called challenge verses in
the Qur’an. These are five passages which have been read traditionally as a response to the
skeptics and cavilers who doubted Muhammad’s mission. One will suffice: And if you are in
doubt concerning that We have sent down on Our servant, then bring a sura like it, and call
your witnesses, apart from God, if you are truthful. And if you do not – and you will not – then
fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for unbelievers. (Q2:23–24)

Whether or not this specific passage is the direct result of such knowledge
is not possible to confirm at this time. However, the idea that joining, rec-
onciling or resolving the nearly infinite instances of opposition and duality
encountered during mundane lived experience in the sublunary realm pro-
vides the modality or occasion for epiphany is one held both by Joyce, as
has been demonstrated, and by the Bab, especially in the work at hand, the
Qayyūm al-asmā’.63

Ulysses emerges as a critique, an interpretation and a typological re-presen-
tation-cum-appropriation of the traditional epic. It is also a representation
and critique or commentary on social reality. It is massive, creative, inven-
tive, very rich and difficult to read. The modern world is in Joyce’s word
“chaosmic.”64 Neither purely chaos nor cosmos, it is both together and it
represents serious problems for the thinking and feeling individual who
would like to make sense of it all. The task of making sense of it all, in the
case of Ulysses is most definitely left to the reader in much the same way the
aware individual must reconcile the oppositions and contradictions of lived
experience to perceive the truth of their revelatory message. The relation-
ship between the reader and the text here is a microcosmic example of the
relationship between the individual and the world. Apart from the epic tasks

ly Bloom), the work is also an epic that the reader accomplishes through the
heroic process of reading and understanding.65 In the nineteenth century,
the “outside” third-person narrator was in complete control of everything
that went on in the novel. Even if the novel was problematic and difficult
and chaotic, the narrator saved us at the end by being in control and solving
the problems, answering the questions. Joyce, Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot and
their “progeny” say it is not like this any more (if it ever was). And this is a
hallmark of modernity and many works of literary modernism.66 In the end,
Joyce, through Ulysses, specifically through the voice of Molly Bloom, affirms
a hopeful and life-affirming response to the chaotic “nightmare” of history67
and modern life with her famous series of twelve yesses that end the novel
and which transforms the chaos into not cosmos but “chaosmos.”68

There is also an epic at the center of the Bab’s composition, the Qur’an.69

This is the story of God’s relationship to humanity from the beginning on
the day of the covenant, to the end, on the day of judgment. The Bab’s
composition is based on the Sura of Joseph, the Qur’anic model of narra-
tive continuity and coherence as a result of which it is frequently known by
its other name: The Best of Stories (ahsan al-qisas) a self-descriptive epithet
found at Q12:2. Indeed, that sura 12, the Sura of Joseph, may be thought the
narrative core of the Qur’an because it sets out the terms of the paradig-
matic Qur’anic “monomyth” in clear and consecutive detail. By choosing
the Sura of Joseph, the Bab demonstrates that he is alive to the special place
of this sura in the Qur’an as the best and most complete iteration of the
distinctively Islamic monomyth and as simultaneous emblem of the entire

by Baudelaire, who famously observed in 1845: “[T]he heroism of modern life surrounds and
presses upon us … There is no lack of subjects, nor of colours, to make epics. The painter, the
true painter for whom we are looking will be he who can snatch its epic quality from the life
of today and can make us see and understand, with brush and pencil, how great and poetic
we are in our cravats and our patent-leather boots. Next year let us hope that the true seekers
may grant us the extraordinary delight of celebrating the advent of the new.” Charles Baude-
laire, “The Salon of 1845,” in The Art of Paris (Oxford: Phaidon Press, 1965), 31–32.

Ulysses, but if we scan the pages carefully, reading with the ear, we find other yesses hid-

Ulysses is composed of Ul + ysses (= yesses), such words in the final lines as “yellow houses”

69. Lawson, “The Qur’an and Epic.”

Qur’an, divine revelation.70 It is not without significance that the story of Jo-
seph, like Ulysses, entails a quest of a father for a son and a son for a father.

Ulysses is a retelling of or commentary on the Odyssey. It is an imposi-
tion of the Odyssean template on the events and character of modern life
in Dublin, and so is simultaneously very old and completely new. In Islamic
terms, Joyce confuses or disturbs an easy understanding of the difference
between revelation (tanzīl) and interpretation (ta’wīl).71 In both Ulysses and
the Qayyūm al-asmā’, differences and relationships and reversals between
content and form are privileged and explored. In the case of the Bab’s
composition, his commentary proceeds without the use of the typical and
universally employed technical exegetical connectives such as “this means”
(ya‘ni) or “the intention of the text here is” (al-murād), devices used fre-
quently in his earlier tafsir and also used in some of his later work. Rather,
here the commentary is the composition and the composition is the com-
mentary. Another aspect of Ulysses that is most suggestive of comparison
with the Qayyūm al-asmā’ is the way it highlights and problematizes the rela-
tionship between text (“father”) and commentary (“son”). Their “re-union”
in the Qayyūm al-asmā’ is indicated in the device of paraphrase offering an
excellent comparative example of the way in which form and content ex-
change roles in this work.

This finds a parallel in those episodes in the first half of Ulysses in which
the character, say Bloom, is the episode (as in Lestrygonians) through the
replacement of a typical nineteenth-century-type narrator with Joyce’s
original and newly-crafted technique of stream of consciousness and “in-
terior monlogue.” We do not read about Bloom, we read Bloom directly. The
Circe episode, in the latter half of the novel, is written as a play precisely
because everything in the brothel is speaking, everything has a tongue.
“Everything” is connecting itself as speaking itself into existence. Again,
a Qur’anic resonance may be seen in the fact that its main topic there is
precisely revelation, discourse, and communication: form and content are a
perfect generative unity.72 This Qur’anic “conceit” is continued and intensi-
fied in the Bab’s Qayyūm al-asmā’. In Ulysses the form becomes content in the

Joycean insight is elaborated in Nabokov’s Pale Fire. It is interesting therefore that Nabokov
himself seems to have disdained Joyce’s last work Finnegans Wake. On this see Maria Kager,

School, June 29- July 5, 2014.

Oxen of the Sun which functions also as a chrestomathy of English prose
styles in forty sections (the number of weeks for human gestation), or in the
chapter Aeolus in which the advertising and newspaper layout is the con-
tent. Both works embody a resounding and unambiguous – if quite avant la
lettre – demonstration of McLuhan’s “the medium is the message.”73

By its structure, the Bab’s composition has much in common with the
literary rupture represented by Joyce’s Ulysses. The Tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf (an-
other name by which the Qayyūm al-asmā’ is known) is, as we saw, the work
through which he proclaimed his messianic mission. In this title we see,
perhaps, some Joycean mischief with the word tafsīr, a technical term mean-
ing “scriptural commentary,” and always indicating the long tradition of
Muslim scholasticism that produced it.74 In reality, this work has virtually
nothing in common with that tradition and is as much unlike a standard
work of tafsir as it could possibly be. It is, however, a reconfiguration of the
Qur’an and a rewriting of the Qur’an, in the same way that Joyce’s Ulysses is a
creative reconfiguration of the Odyssey. That Joyce did not have to resort to
such a disguise for his work and could proclaim openly that it was an imita-
tion of the Odyssey says something about the differences in the respective
cultural settings and the differences between the two texts, the Odyssey and
the Qur’an and their respective functions.

The word al-Qayyūm comes from the Qur’an (Q2:255; 3:2; 20:111) where
it always appears as a divine attribute in tandem with al-hayy, “the ever-
living.” It is frequently translated as “self-subsisting.” Its choice as part of
the title of this work is related to its numerological (abjad) value,75 a gema-
tric iteration of the name Yusuf: both Qayyūm and Yūsuf have the same
numeric value (156) and are therefore read as equivalent in the deep “un-
seen” structure of the language. Additionally, the word Qayyūm is derived
from the same Arabic root as the key messianic terms qā’im (resurrector) and
qiyāma (resurrection/judgment). Thus the figure of Joseph is understood
and presented in a messianic and eschatological mood. The prominence of
the word, which tends to elude a “crisp” translation, especially in the title of

1964), 7–21.

74. Tafsīr expresses the authority of tradition in Islam the same way the word midrash does
in Judaism.

75. Abjad refers to the system by which each Arabic letter has a numerical value. This is
a common – and ancient – phenomenon in the alphabets of many Middle Eastern languages,
perhaps related to the need for a computational system in a trade-oriented culture. The nu-
merical value of words is part of their esoteric meaning in much mystical and theological
writing throughout the history of Islamic letters.

the work Qayyūm al-asmā’, is explained by its connotative function as sym-
bol of the resurrection and day of judgment through articulating the same
sounds of the words qā’im and qiyāma and bearing the central semantic value
of the triliteral Arabic root Q-W-M.

In the Qayyūm al-asmā’, there are a hundred and eleven chapters desig-
nated by the author “suras.”76 Each sura is composed of verses designated by
their author as āyāt, usually translated as “divine signs.” A wordier though
accurate translation is: “miraculous portents” of God’s transcendent
oneness. They are miraculous in the first place because the prophet Moham-
mad, through whom they were spoken, was an unschooled merchant77 and
because any description of God is, according to the Qur’an, paradoxically-
cum-miraculously fraught because of “His” utter unknowability (Q112). The
word āya/sign reflects something of the idea in the New Testament’s “signs
and wonders” (John 4:48; Romans 15:9) without the negativity implied in
the John passage. Here it is the author, Ali Mohammad Shirāzi, who uses
the term tafsīr in the opening words of the first sura. But the composition
is in reality taking the form of a “new” Qur’an or more accurately, from the
mythopoeic point of view, it is the “true” Qur’an that had until now been in
hiding with the hidden Imam.

(QA3, sūrat al-mulk, 9)

76. Inexplicably, this is the same number of suras mentioned in Finnegans Wake. Atherton,
Books at the Wake, 203 (see however some inconsistency in Atherton on this subject at 45 and
172). The proper number of Qur’anic suras is 114. There is no reason to believe that Joyce had
any knowledge of even the existence of the Bab’s writings although he did have knowledge
of the Qur’an and Islamic history and was also in some ways consciously trying to “rewrite”
the Qur’an. (See Yared above in note 64). Atherton’s view (p. 203) is that Joyce’s 111 is a veiled
condemnation of or expression of “hostility towards” the Qur’an because it is also an allusion
to a condemnatory sura (#111) of the Qur’an in which the arch villain of early Islamic history,
Abu Lahab, is roundly condemned to hell. I do not agree that Joyce was hostile to the Qur’an.

77. On Muhammad’s so-called “illiteracy” see Sebastian Günther, “Muhammad, the Illiter-
ate Prophet: An Islamic Creed in the Qur’an and Qur’anic Exegesis,” Journal of Qur’anic Studies
4:1 (2002): 1–26. On the parallels between the life of the Prophet Muhammad and the biog-
raphy of the Bab, see Stephen Lambden, “An Episode in the Childhood of the Bab,” in Peter
Smith, ed., In Iran, Studies in Babí and Baha’í History volume 3 (Los Angeles: Kalimát Press, 1986),
1–31.

Each āya of the Qur’an’s Sūrat Yūsuf, which has 111 verses, becomes the
lemma for each of the suras in this work, the topic-heading under which
the commentary is generated. The first chapter of the Bab’s composition, as
mentioned earlier, is entitled the Sūrat al-mulk. After this first element of a
given sura, comes the basmala – that is the ubiquitous Islamic short prayer
and invocation: In the Name of God, the Merciful the Compassionate, a formu-
la that heads all but one of the Qur’an’s 114 suras and which is also used
throughout Islamic social and learned culture on countless other occasions,
literary, liturgical and social as blessing or prayer. After the basmala comes,
in the spirit of the “occasions of revelation” genre of Qur’anic sciences,78 and
in imitation of Qur’ans which typically list the number of verses at the head
of each sura, the following statement: “this was revealed in Shiraz in forty-
two verses” as part of the title section of each sura.

As in Ulysses, so in the Qayyūm al-asmā’, there is a pervading sense of
affirmation, assent, acceptance, and commitment. The number forty-two,
the total number of verses for each sura, the Bab himself points out, is the
numerical equivalent of the word bala “Yea verily” which is, as mentioned
earlier, the answer of humanity to the question posed by God on the day
of the covenant, the day of alast. This “Yea verily” – which in the Qur’anic
chronotope represents the beginning of consciousness and history – finds
an unexpected yet powerful resonance in Molly Bloom’s future directed af-
firmation in Penelope, ending the entire novel with “yes I will I will Yes.”
And just as chaos and cosmos are combined in Joyce’s modernist literary
masterpiece, by making each of his new 111 suras 42 verses in length lends
a heretofore-unimaginable regularity to the idea of “Qur’an.” But, as we saw,
the number 42 is not accidental, even if the number 111 in Finnegans Wake is,
encoding how form becomes content in this remarkable work by the Bab. It
may be thought that this primordial “yes” flows through the “veins” of the
entire work, all 4,442 verses, as the Bab himself explicitly says.79 Casting new
verses, braiding direct quotations from the Qur’an with his own words and
words and phrases from Hadith in a seamless new verse, the author regu-
lates it all with the familiar – and here unvarying – Qur’anic rhymed prose,
saj‘. There can be wide variation in the length of the individual verse in the
Bab’s composition, just as there is in the original Qur’an, from the short-

78. On this topic see Andrew Rippin, “Occasions of Revelation,” in Encyclopaedia of the
Qur’an, edited by Jane Dammen McAuliffe, vol. 3 (Leiden: Brill Academic Publishers, 2003),

79. See below the translation from the Qayyūm al-asmā’: “the Letter ‘B’ that circulates in
the water of the two groups of letters.” “Two groups of letters” is a poetic way of referring to
all language. The letter ‘B’ is, among other things, the first letter of the word ‘balā’: Yes!!.

est, e.g. a set of disconnected letters, to the longest (the 15 lines of verse 8
of the Sūrat al-‘abd, (QA10: 225–6). The Bab combines commentary with
text, audience with performance, revelation with interpretation. In terms
of European literary history, such may certainly be considered a modernist
gesture.

Following this first section of a given sura, comes the citation of the
Qur’anic verse from the Sūrat Yūsuf that is to be the object of commentary
– the lemma – for the particular chapter. Then come, for all but four suras,
the disconnected letters (some Qur’anic, some new). After the disconnected
letters, comes the third section of the commentary. It is difficult to char-
acterize this third section satisfactorily because it can be so different from
sura to sura and sometimes highly variegated within each sura. In many of
the suras, this third section represents a further level of paraphrase, gloss
and commentary. For example, the Bab’s composition from suras 80 to 91,80
in addition to offering a commentary for the Qur’anic verses 12:79 to 12:91
(as would be expected following the structural logic of the work) also pres-
ents a running paraphrase of a long series of verses in Qur’anic order that
takes into account the bulk of the actual Qur’an from suras 10 through 16.
The final or fourth section or division is the return to the actual verse from
the Sūrat Yūsuf under which the new sura has been written. Here the autho-
rial creativity assumes the character of pure paraphrase. The verse itself is
recast to reflect the concerns of the author. These concerns are largely to do
with the appearance of the hidden Imam and the inauguration of the return,
the qiyāma and the day of judgment all in one literary moment. In compari-
son with Ulysses, this final section may be thought a similarly life affirming
response to the challenges and “nightmare” of history – in short, an awak-
ening, a revelation. In order to illustrate what might otherwise be difficult
to visualize, reproduced here is a translation of the opening of chapter 109
of the Bab’s Qayyūm al-asmā’, the Sura of the Servant. Here the Qur’anic form
will be quite apparent in the opening invocation, the mention of the num-
ber of verses and the place of revelation, and perhaps most importantly, the
close relationship between commentary and text in which it is very difficult
to discern at times where the Qur’anic material ends and the Bab’s so-called
commentary begins. In order to illustrate this aspect of the work I have
employed the typographical expediency of showing the verbatim Qur’anic
passages and words in small capitals.

Such literary activity, in the guise of exegesis, may be understood partly
as excavating or carving out of the mass and chaos of revelation a here-
tofore-inconceivable regularity in which the pre-existing irregular and the
frequently non sequitur narratological aspect of Qur’anic suras become as
formally structured as sonnets. In the context of the return of the hidden
Imam with the true Qur’an, this could suggest that the irregularity of the
Uthmanic codex – the basis for all published Qur’ans – was a result of textual

violence on the part of the breakers of the covenant (al-nāqiḍīn). Whatever
the implications of this new orderly Qur’an text might be, it is clear that
the resulting composition mirrors the confidence of the author in claiming
the authority to do such an otherwise unimaginable and heretical thing: to
rearrange and re-write the Qur’an. It may be that Joyce’s design, to collapse
the 20-year long story of Odysseus into the confines of a single day in the
life of Dublin bespeaks a similar desire to exercise control over the “night-
mare of history” of which Stephen Dedalus so famously spoke (U34). Thus
the name of the first sura written by the Bab: mulk, or [divine] ownership,
may be read as his ownership and mastery of the Holy Qur’an, reorganizing
it, making it regular, in a sense making it “rational,” while at the same time
announcing and declaiming through a torrential storm of language with
“expectation on the verge of being fulfilled” inside it, anticipating a kind
of Joycean “chaosmos.” It should be recalled, as well, that the composition
can be seen as a melding together of innumerable fragments of scripture
making the resulting composition simultaneously old and new – another
coincidentia oppositorum.

Such a storm is experienced in Ulysses but is even more manifest and
intense in Finnegans Wake: a riot of language, which eventually emerges as
quite deliberately and meticulously orchestrated – and this to a nearly un-
believable degree.82 Eventually emerges, that is, after the heroic effort of the
reader has succeeded in discerning the art and craft sometimes otherwise
obscured by these two remarkable compositions, Ulysses and the Qayyūm al-
asmā’, in which the epic adventure of language in extending the resources
and significance of language itself is central.

We do not need to emphasize how shocking and scandalous – unthink-
able even – such an imitation of the Qur’an was and is. But such extreme
scandal – though in a different “key” – also relates to the literary act of Joyce
75 years later, when he takes ownership of and participates quite fully in the
sacred aura and dignity of the epic tradition, and appropriates its author-
ity for himself in refiguring it according to contemporary Irish life in all its
“chaosmic” plenitude, from the sublime preoccupations of Stephen, to the
fatherly and husbandly quest and the attendant peripeties of Bloom and the
ultimate salvific affirmation of Molly. The life is told in the – at that time –

82. There are numerous works of scholarship devoted to decoding the otherwise extremely
daunting Finnegans Wake and revealing its intricate logic and structure, we mention here
only fJWF, beginning with the oldest: Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson, A Skeleton
Key to Finnegans Wake: Unlocking James Joyce’s Masterwork (Novato, CA: New World Library, 2005
[first published 1944]); Adaline Glasheen, A Census of Finnegans Wake: An Index of the Characters
and Their Roles (London: Faber and Faber, 1957); Clive Hart, A Concordance to Finnegan’s Wake
(Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1963); Atherton, The Books at the Wake; John
Bishop, Joyce’s Book of the Dark, Finnegans Wake (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press,
1986).

scandalous graphic depiction of sexual and other intimate bodily acts and
functions, in the roiling, sometimes tawdry and racist encounters in Dublin
pub life, in the private tenderness that occurs between various characters.
There is also pointed criticism of the hypocrisies and paralysis Joyce saw in
Roman Catholicism. He makes the Odyssey his own in order to express his
own particular artistic vision a vision that entails a significant Brunonian
“mystical” noetic. The Bab does the same thing with the Qur’an. He says
this is mine. And, I am demonstrating how I am taking ownership of it now.
And, I am reorganizing it. Rewriting it according to the exigencies of the
moment. Thus the Bab also interrogated, disturbed and problematized the
relationship between revelation (tanzīl ) and its interpretation (ta’wīl ), in
the life affirming hope to awaken from the nightmare of history marked
most dramatically at his time by the mutual and frequently quite virulent
heart-breaking enmity among various Muslim communal identities all of
which traced their genesis to the gospel of divine unity originally preached
by Mohammad. As a son of Shi’i Islam the Bab’s awareness of such disunity
was particularly exquisite.

When the Qayyūm al-asmā’ was first brought to the attention of “Orien-
talism” in the nineteenth century, people said it is meaningless; the man
was insane; there is no sense to this; “it is an unintelligible rhapsody”; the
grammar is bad.83 This response is of course very similar to the kind of
thing that was said about Ulysses when it inaugurated literary modernism
in 1922. However, neither the Qayyūm al-asmā’ nor Ulysses is nonsense. Both
are very clearly and intricately structured, even if the warp and woof of
this structure is frequently overwhelmed by torrential linguistic virtuosity.
It is worth noting that by the time the Bab was writing, Shi‘i philosophy
had established an interesting discourse in which the hidden Imam could
be identified with an individual internal spiritual or existential reality, in
addition to the expected advent of history, as in the Protestant
transposition of the Return of Jesus to the inner realm of the individual
soul. The Bab reorganized the words and verses of the Qur’an to apply
specifically to the appearance of the hidden Imam and his own role as the
gate of the hidden Imam. Thus, the hidden Imam serves in some ways as a
poetic reference for the “new” individual as such, in addition to being aO
ever-living symbol of radical historical change, which seeks to resolve the
problems tradition poses to the current moment in Iranian society. This
would seem to be clearly indicated in the Bab’s much recited short prayer,
called in English “The Remover of Difficulties.”84

of the Bab (Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre 1976), 217.

> Is there any remover of difficulties save God? Say: Praised be God, He
> is God. All are his servants and all abide by His bidding.85

An equally accurate translation, and one which acquires a certain imme-
diacy in the exceptional context of the Shi‘i “millennium” or qiyāma (during
which time the Bab composed his various works), would alter the transla-
tion of the last five words (which in Arabic are wa kullun bi-amrihi qā’imun) to
“and each is a qā’im in God’s cause.” In Twelver Shi‘ism, the qā’im is typically
held to be the hidden or Twelfth Imam who had, until the time of his divine-
ly ordained return, been in occultation (ghayba). So, in another rendering of
the original Arabic prayer a “modern” notion of the individual emerges: “Is
there any remover of oppression apart from God? Say: All praise be to God!
He is God. All others are His servants and are to arise (qā’im) in obedience to
His holy cause (amrihi).” This indicates also that the time for waiting for a
savior is over. In the new cycle, the cycle of fulfillment, maturity and resur-
rection, all members of the human race are potentially qā’ims, arisers in the
cause of God. Naturally, it is also quite within the bounds of accepted usage
to understand both meanings as complementary to each other.

Here, we see another point of comparison with Joyce and the Bab and
another feature of the epic dimension of both Ulysses and the Qayyūm al-
asmā’ (and of course of the Qur’an itself): in some ways the most salient
aspect of their epic qualities becomes apparent in the epic struggle of the
reader himself to “complete” the journey. The individual becomes singled
out as the center of narrative gravity and comprehension. Understanding
is heroic. The reader is an autonomous, creative-cum-heroic participant
without whom the composition would not exist. Revelation is cast in the
language of the recipient:

> And We have sent no Messenger save with the tongue of his
> people, that he might make all clear to them; then God leads astray
> whomsoever He will, and He guides whomsoever He will; and He is
> the All-mighty, the All-wise. (Q14: 4: wa mā arsalnā min rusul illā bi-lisān
> qawmihi)

Related to the idea of “reader as hero” is the quest for identity, emblematized
in the search of son for father in both works. It is the grand “monomythic”
theme of literature as such.86 This theme emerges in both Ulysses and the

Qayyūm al-asmā’ through revelation, recognition (anagnorisis) or epiphany
(zuhūr, kashf), the Greek word for which is of course apocalypse. Both Ulysses
and the Qayyūm al-asmā’ are dealing in revelation. For Ulysses, this is intense-
ly encountered in Penelope. For the Qayyūm al-asmā’ the intensity of the
encounter is maintained at a remarkable level throughout the entire work.
Revelation, for the Bab, springs from the coincidentia oppositorum, which
employs all created phenomena in order to demonstrate that there is some-
thing beyond logic and sense perception that shines through the “clash” of
apparent oppositions. And in both the Bab and Joyce this is demonstrated
over and over again through the epic adventure of language in which the
coincidentia oppositorum has a simultaneous poetic or literary function and a
philosophical or mystical function.87

The literary fiction, that the book was given to the Bab by the hidden
Imam, asserts of course an important “religious” credential, namely that he
is the “official” representative of the hidden Imam and so the focus and lo-
cus of all the power in the universe (viz. al-walāya al-mutlaqa). But the actual
work establishes an even more important “literary” credential. Certainly
the earliest followers of the Bab made much of his verbal artistry and prodi-
gious literary abilities as a proof of his claims to be in touch with the hidden
Imam. Without the hidden Imam there is, of course, no Twelver Shi‘ism;
without the idea of the absence or the discussion about the hidden Imam’s
representative, there is also no Twelver Shi‛ism. But, there are certain clues
throughout the text that the Bab himself is actually this same hidden Imam,
clues that he himself is the one from whom he himself received the book.88 What
might be thought clear and unambiguous indication of this is found in the
titles of the hundred-and-eighth and hundred-and-ninth suras. The discon-
nected letters for these two chapters, Sūrat al-dhikr (QA108) and Sūrat al-‛abd
(QA 109), are respectively A-L-Y (‛ayn-lam-yā) and M-H-M-D (mīm-ḥā-mīm-
dal). Neither set of disconnected letters occurs in the Qur’an and must be
thought original – as disconnected letters – with the Bab (as are many other
sets of disconnected letters in this work). Further, each set when looked at as
not disconnected but as spelling a word are seen to be the names Ali and Mo-
hammad. These are the names, in reverse order, of (according to Shi‘i Islam)
the first two bearers of divine authority in Islam: Ali ibn Abi Tālib (d.661)
cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad (d. 632). That these are

88. Lawson, Gnostic, 117. A similarly self-reflexive process is studied in Omid Ghaem-

also the names of the author of the Qayyūm al-asmā’ is obviously no accident,
making the point that history is cyclical and is repeating itself in the revela-
tion of the Bab. They are inserted here in an artistic, nearly playful, manner
to underscore that he is indeed responsible for this text as its author. (See
Figure 3 below.) The name of the author Ali Mohammad [viz: Shirāzi - the
Bab] is thus camouflaged in these not too mysterious, “disconnected” let-
ters, which are clearly not disconnected at all.89 And, most importantly,
with this assertion of authorship, the Bab complicates and challengeT a
traditional understanding of divine revelation.

The Qayyūm al-asmā’ is the very embodiment of high seriousness and ear-
nestness. No irony, no comedy or humor. These “disconnected letters” are
striking evidence of authorial presence and an artistic gesture that combines
the Bab’s inborn temperament and preoccupations with his unconventional,
even iconoclastic, religious ideas. These concerns are channeled through a
traditionally pietistic religious modality: the Qur’an and its exegesis (tafsīr).
The Qur’an is the raw material out of which issues this work, just as the
Odyssey is the raw material out of which Ulysses emerges as Joyce’s expres-
sion of his own unorthodoxy. Both are works that by their very nature ask
questions about the relationship between tradition and change, narrative
and authorial creativity, and the role of the reader. In the Bab’s composition,
the relationship between revelation and interpretation is privileged. This
may be thought emblematic of the basic presupposition of a distinctively
Shi‘i hermeneutic in which the angel of revelation is also the angel of inter-
pretation.90

This is of course where it parts company to some degree with Ulysses.

Ulysses is not terribly religious in the traditional “institutional” sense of that
word, although Joyce was himself saturated in Roman Catholicism, and much
of his language and much of his point of view was formed by his early educa-
tion and his conflicts coming up against Catholicism in the “modern world.”
It is indisputable that he rejected Catholicism. But, we have seen how Joyce’s
“religious faculty” was attracted to and stimulated by the mystical philoso-
phy of thinkers like Bruno. It is not accurate to call Ulysses secular precisely
because of its epic structure and élan, its seriousness, which may be thought
highlighted and accentuated by the fluent, obbligato-like leitmotif of hu-
mor and its revelatory observation of the hallowed interconnectedness of all

89. While I am unaware of the any of the sets of actual Qur’anic disconnected letters being
identified as proper names, the reverse is certainly true. Sets of these mysterious letters have
frequently been given as proper names in Islamic societies, e.g., Ta Ha (from Sura 20) and Ya
Sin (from Sura 36).

1971), vol. 3, 292–300.

things. Ulysses has the gravitas of scriptural purpose and the solemnity and
nobility of the epic. Just as the Qur’an is concerned with a universal human
experience – an epic which it casts in terms of dīn – sacred responsibility
or “religion,” Ulysses locates sacred responsibility in Bloom’s search for a
son (Rudy), Stephen’s search for a father, and Molly’s exuberant and some-
how also highly devout affirmation of life. We can never imagine the Bab
saying anything like Joyce’s: “How I hate God and death! How I like Nora.”91
However, in the opening chapter of his work, the Sūrat al-mulk, the sura of
dominion, he says with similar vehemence and commitment that all power,

explicitly that of the Shah and that of the ulema, has now been returned
to its rightful place: the hidden Imam (i.e. himself). And though the Bab’s
balā “Yes indeed!” is a different affirmation than Molly’s series of 12 yesses
that end the book, both adverbial affirmatives assent to the power of life
to endure, abide, flourish in order to provide the “modality” out of which
more life can be created and renewed. Earlier, it was suggested that the word
qiyāma may in some ways reflect and indicate Qajar modernist energies. An-
other word, much used in the Bab’s writings and by later Baha’i writers, is
badī‘, which may be translated as “wondrously new.” It is wondrous because
it indicates a quality that is simultaneously new and eternal or ancient. It is
the word used, for example to indicate the new calendar constructed by the
Bab and followed by Baha’īs. This same tension uniting the old and the new
is clearly present in Ulysses.

Thus does literary modernism, in the cloak of Iranian religiosity,
anticipate by 70 years or so, a much more well-known and -recognized ep-
ochal literary shift whose emblem is James Joyce’s Ulysses.92 Whether this
has relevance for theorizing about the relationship between such literary
creativity and the more purely historical problem of the relationship be-
tween the modern and whatever its opposite might be, is a question that
will have to be postponed. But for the moment, we can perhaps allow our-
selves a little latitude to ask in closing whether we might not be somewhat
justified in thinking of Ulysses as a case of Qajar literary modernism in a
twentieth-century European masterpiece? Indeed, all of the Bab’s literary
works were condemned and demonized by the broader culture as hereti-
cal. Thousands of the Bab’s followers were in fact slaughtered by the Shah’s
forces, at the behest of the clerical estate. Those who might otherwise have
been attracted to and inspired by the literary achievements of the Bab had
much more at stake than “mere” literary success or failure. But the compari-
son of the two works is suggestive on the level of literature precisely because
of the structural and thematic parallels, the similarities between the two
texts as scandalous, outrageous and “difficult,” the respective authors’ sense

92. The present exploration is not the first time the unique œuvre of the Bab has been
likened to modernist European literary developments. Years ago, in conference presentation
Denis MacEoin, prolific scholar of the Babi and Baha’i phenomena, said: “As a matter of fact,
his Arabic was never as bad as his Muslim critics have suggested. There is something entic-
ingly Dadaist about his defiance of linguistic tradition and his explosion of Arabic roots past
all ordinary meaning.” (“Deconstructing and Reconstructing the Shari‛a: The Babi And Baha’i
Solutions to the Problem of Immutability” British Society for Middle East Studies Conference
1997\.) That presentation has recently been published in a collection of articles. See Denis Ma-
cEoin, The Messiah of Shiraz : Studies in Early and Middle Babism (Boston: Brill, 2009), 645–57, refer-
ence here is to p. 652.

of themselves as revolutionizing their own particular literary cultures and
their singular and heroic dedication to their respective visions. From the
point of view of the centrality of rupture, scandal and shock and the signal
that something new was happening embodied by both works, there is much
to commend the comparison and it is difficult to ignore their obvious simi-
larities.
