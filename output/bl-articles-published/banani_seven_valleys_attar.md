The Seven Valleys of Bahá’u’lláh and Farid ud-Din Attar

e are even as the bird which soareth, with the full force of its mighty wings and with complete

“Y        and joyous confidence, through the immensity of the heavens, until, impelled to satisfy its

hunger, it turneth longingly to the water and clay of the earth below it, and, having been
entrapped in the mesh of its desire, findeth itself impotent to resume its flight to the realms whence it
came. Powerless to shake off the burden weighing on its sullied wings, that bird, hitherto an inmate of
the heavens, is now forced to seek a dwe ll in g-place upon the dust.”1

Introduction

While in Baghdad in exile, Bahá’u’lláh left the city for a period of two years (April 10, 1854 to March
19, 1856) to withdraw to the mountains of Kurd is tan and the town of Sulaymaniyyih where His true
identity as unknown but word of His sanctified character and mystical knowledge spread. After He
returned to Baghdad, Bahá’u’lláh, who had not yet openly declared His mission, wrote a letter respond-
ing to questions posed to him by a sufi mystic, Shaykh Muhyi’d-Din, which has come to be known by the
title The Seven Valleys (Haft-Vadi). This short mystical essay, written in the Persian language, traces the
essence of the journey of the soul in its eternal approach towards its Creator, God. The seven stages (val-
leys) of this journey is a traditional Eastern mystical concept. The metaphor of the seven valleys is also
found in the famous late twelfth century work of Farid ud-Din Attar, a narrative poem of more than four
thousand lines, called “The Conference of the Birds” (Manteq at- Tair). The Seven Valleys of Bahá’u’lláh
is an original commentary on that traditional mystical theme and alludes to His own impending procla-
mation in many subtle ways. With the threads of sim il arity of theme, stories, allegory, and especially
bird imagery, Bahá’u’lláh weaves a new garment for the mystical path of humanity. The theme of bird
imagery in both the work of Bahá’u’lláh and of Attar is the topic for this paper.

Imagery of the Bird—Sufism and Attar’s poem

The Conference of the Birds is the best known work of the mystical Persian poet, Farid ud-Din Attar,
who was born in mid-twelfth century A.D. in north-east Iran (where Omar Khayyam also was born). His
name, Attar, indicates a perfume seller or druggist/doctor which may have been his occupation as well
as poet. He traveled widely, much as his counterparts in medieval Europe, the troubadours and wander-
ing scholars. After his wande r in gs, he settled in his hometown of Nishapur although there is some evi-
dence that later he was tried for heresy. He was banished and his property looted. However, at the time
of his death he was back in Nishapur where he is buried.

Attar’s “The Conference of the Birds” is a poem about sufism, a doctrine of the mystics of Islam.

Sufis were continually under threat of being accused of being heretics (by orthodox Islam) because their
teachings were handed down from shaykh (spiritual leader) to pupil and they were forbidden to reveal their
most important beliefs, although different sufis living at different times have clearly believed in differ-
ent things.

Sufi doctrines include: only one God exists, all other things are an emanation of Him, or are His
‘shadow’; religion is useful mainly as a way of reaching to a Truth beyond the teachings of particular reli-
gions—however Islam is the most useful religion; man’s distinctions between good and evil have no
meaning for God who knows only unity; the soul is trapped within the cage of the body but can, by
looking inward, recognize its essential affinity with God; the awakened soul, guided by God’s grace, can

progress along a ‘Way’ which leads to ann ih il ation in God. The doctrine received its most extreme
expression in the writings of the Spanish Arab pantheist Ibn Arabi, a contemporary of Attar, who main-
ta in ed that the being of creation and the Creator are indivisible. In “The Conference of the Birds,” Attar
frequently seems to be about to propound the same doctrine, only to step back at the last moment and
maintain a final distinction between God and His creatures.2

Sufism was not simply a doctrine but was a discipline for living where its practitioners followed a care-
fully prescribed ‘Way.’ Attar’s poem, “The Conference of the Birds,” is a description of the stages
encountered by the adepts of the sufis’ Way in the form of an allegory of the “birds” of the world gath-
ered together to seek their “king” (God). In their quest, the birds are led by one of them called the
hoopoe bird (hod-hod, in Persian) who acts as their shaykh (spiritual guide) on their journey through the
seven valleys: quest, love, insight into mystery, detachment, unity, bewilderment, and poverty/nothing-
ness. The purpose of the discipline is to achieve purification.3

Although the stories are told by the hoopoe to birds they are in reality told by Attar to humanity. The
hoopoe tells the birds that they indeed have their own king—called the Simorgh—but that he lives far
away. The birds are at first enthusiastic to begin their search, but when they realize how difficult the
journey will be they start to make excuses. The nightingale, for example, cannot leave his beloved; the
hawk is satisfied with his position at court waiting on earthly kings; the finch is too afraid even to set
out. The hoopoe counters each of their excuses with stories and anecdotes which show how their desires
and fears are mistaken and gives advice for liv in g. The birds fly a little way and then pause to ask the
hoopoe about the length of the journey. In answer the hoopoe describes the seven valleys of the Way.
The journey is quickly dealt with and, out of the thousands of birds who began the journey, only thirty
birds have made it to the end where they arrive at the court of the Simorgh. At first they are turned back
then, after each bird is asked to review its own misdeeds in life, with their spirits now ref in ed, the birds
are finally admitted and find that the Simorgh they have sought is none other than themselves reflect-
ed in the “face” of the Simorgh. The story depends on a pun in which the words in Persian si (30) and
morgh (birds) remain at the end of the journey, and the si morgh (30 birds) meet the Simorgh, the goal of
their quest. Two sufi themes are diffused throughout the poem: the necessity for destroying the Self, and
the importance of passionate love. The two are connected: the Self is seen as an entity dependent on
pride and reputation; there can be no progress until the bird (pilgrim) is indifferent to both, and the
commonest way of making him indifferent is the experience of overwhelming love.4
The hoopoe says to the birds:

I know our king—but how can I alone
Endure the journey to His distant throne?
Join me, and when at last we end our quest
Our king will greet you as His honoured guest.

How long will you persist in blasphemy?
Escape your self-hood’s vicious tyranny—
Whoever can evade the Self transcends

This world and as a lover he ascends.
Set free your soul; impatient of delay,
Step out along our sovereign’s royal Way:
We have a king; beyond Kaf’s mountain peak
The Simorgh lives, the sovereign whom you seek,

> And He is always near to us, though we
> Live far from His transcendent majesty.
A hundred thousand veils of dark and light
> Withdraw His presence from our mortal sight,
> And in both worlds no being shares the throne
That marks the Simorgh’s power and His alone—

He reigns in undisturbed omnipotence,
Bathed in the light of His magnificence—

\[32\] Lights of ‘Irfán

No mind, no intellect can penetrate
The mystery of His unending state . . .5
And near the end of the poem Attar says:
You cannot hope for Life till you progress
Through some small shadow of this Nothingness.
First He will humble you in dust and mire,

And then bestow the glory you desire.
Be nothing first! And then you will exist,
You cannot live whilst life and Self persist—
Till you reach Nothingness you cannot see

The Life you long for in eternity.6

Imagery of the Bird—Bahá’í sources

One of the Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh, the famous calligrapher, Mírzá Óusayn-i-Isfahani (died in ‘Akká,
1912 AD) entitled Mishkin-Qalam (Musk-scented Pen), who is perhaps most well known as the designer
of the “Greatest Name” symbol, was the first Bahá’í artist to use the Islamic cultural art of calligraphy
and pa in ting to express his Bahá’í religious and mystical feelings. Bird imagery, which appears so often
in his calligraphic rende r in gs, is a powerful expression of the theme of the “Nightingale of Parad is e”
announcing the bringing of the heavenly message of a new Faith to our earthly home. Numerous exam-
ples of his outstanding work are preserved in museums (including the Sackler Museum at Harvard
University) and Bahá’í centers around the world.7

The Central Figures of the Bahá’í Faith have used the image of the bird to convey numerous spiritual
conditions and states of being, drawing on a rich cultural heritage to express more vividly their message.
A list of examples include:

From Bahá’u’lláh:

bird of utterance (Epistle to the Son of the Wolf); bird of the human heart, bird of the Throne, bird
of the spirit, the bird which soareth (Glean in gs); bird of Desire, bird of Eternity, bird of Heaven, bird
of the human mind, mystic bird (Kitáb-i-ˆqán); bird of thy soul, Persian bird, bird of the heavens of God,
this mortal Bird (Seven Valleys); and celestial bird, broken bird (Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh).

From ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

broken-w in ged bird, bird of love and understanding (Bahá’í Prayers); divine bird, roving bird, bird of
high flight (Japan Will Turn Ablaze); bird of joy, kingly bird (Memorials of the Faithful); wealth of a
bird (Some Answered Questions); and bird of my mind, bird of clay, bird of faithfulness, soaring bird
(Selections from the Writi ngs of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá).

From Shoghi Effendi:

the bird of human kind (God Passes By).

Bahá’u’lláh’s Uses of Bird Imagery in The Seven Valleys

> In the letter’s preamble, Bahá’u’lláh addresses Shaykh Muhyi’d-Din with these loving words:
> “Further, we have harkened to what the nightingale of knowledge sang on the boughs of the tree of
thy being, and learned what the dove of certitude cried on the branches of the bower of thy heart.”8

“...and the bird of thy soul shall recall the holy sanctuaries of preexistence and soar on the wings of
longing...”9

And in the form of a postscript at the end of His letter, Bahá’u’lláh answers a question from the
Shaykh which may have been about one of the famous birds from Attar’s Conference of the Birds.
Bahá’u’lláh writes:

“The thoughts thou has expressed as to the interpretation of the common species of bird that is called
in Persian Gunjishk (sparrow) were considered. Thou appearest to be well-grounded in mystic truth.
However, on every plane, to every letter a meaning is allotted which relateth to that pl an e. Indeed, the
wayfarer findeth a secret in every name, a mystery in every letter. In one sense, these letters refer to holi-
ness.”10

Bahá’u’lláh’s advice to the Shaykh challenge his spirit and questing soul with these words:
“Wert thou to harken to the melodies of this mortal Bird [Bahá’u’lláh], then wouldst thou seek out the
undying chalice and pass by every perishable cup.”11

The spiritual journey which Bahá’u’lláh describes passes through the seven valleys of search, love,
knowledge, unity, contentment, wonderment and poverty/absolute nothingness.

> To be able to pass through the second valley (love), Bahá’u’lláh writes:
> “And, if confirmed by the Creator, the lover escapes from the claws of the eagle of love...”12

To leave the third valley (knowledge), Bahá’u’lláh writes:
“If thou be a man of communion and prayer, soar up on the wings of assistance from Holy Souls, that
thou mayest behold the mysteries of the Friend and attain to the lights of the Beloved.”13

In the middle of the fourth valley (unity), Bahá’u’lláh refers to His own precarious condition, say in g:
“And if a nightingale soar upward from the clay of self and dwell in the rose bower of the heart, and
in Arabian melodies and sweet Iranian songs recount the mysteries of God—a single word of which quick-
eneth to fresh, new life the bodies of the dead, and bestoweth the Holy Spirit upon the moldering bones
of this existence—thou wilt behold a thousand claws of envy, a myriad beaks of rancor hunting after
Him and with all their power intent upon His death.”14

“Thus it hath been made clear that these stages depend on the vision of the wayfarer. In every city he
will behold a world, in every Valley reach a spr in g, in every meadow hear a song. But the falcon of the
mystic heaven hath many a wondrous carol of the spirit in His breast, and the Persian bird keepeth in
His soul many a sweet Arab melody; yet these are hidden, and hidden shall remain.” 15

In the fifth valley (contentment), Bahá’u’lláh writes:
“The tongue faileth in describing these three Valleys, and speech falleth short. The pen steppeth not
into this region, the ink leaveth only a blot. In these planes, the nightingale of the heart hath other songs
and secrets, which make the heart to stir and the soul to clamor, but this mystery of inner meaning may
be whispered only from heart to heart, confided only from breast to breast.”16

And in the seventh valley (true poverty and absolute nothingness), Bahá’u’lláh concludes:
“Then, ere the nightingale of the mystic paradise repair to the garden of God, and the rays of the heav-
enly morning return to the Sun of Truth—make thou an effort, that haply that in this dust-heap of the
mortal world thou mayest catch a fragrance from the everlasting garden, and live forever in the shadow
of the peoples of this city. And when thou hast attained this highest station and come to this mightiest
plane, then shalt thou gaze on the Beloved, and forget all else.”17

Conclusion

Bahá’u’lláh, in most of his writings, says that all we can “know” of the unknowable essence of God is
what we understand through belief and worship of His Manifestation(s). There is a clear distinction
between the three realms of the Creator, the Manifestations of God, and the creation. The closest we can
come to God is living a life in God, “that every man may testify, in himself, by himself, in the station
of the Manifestation of his Lord, that verily there is no God save Him, and that every man may there-
by win his way to the summit of realities, until none shall contemplate anything whatsoever but that he
shall see God therein.”18 The hoopoe bird in Attar’s poem which acts as a spiritual guide (shaykh) to the
world of birds on their quest to reach their king, Simorgh, is not the same as a Manifestation of God,
but his words of wisdom shed light on the journey’s Way.

\[34\] Lights of ‘Irfán

> In The Seven Valleys Bahá’u’lláh, speaking of His own Station as a Manifestation of God, warns:
> “O My friend! Many a hound pursueth this gazelle of the desert of oneness; many a talon claweth at
this thrush of the eternal garden. Pitiless ravens do lie in wait for this bird of the heavens of God, and
the huntsman of envy stalketh this deer of the meadow of love....”

“[t]hey who soar in the heaven of singleness and reach to the sea of the Absolute, reckon this city—
which is the station of life in God—as the furthermost state of mystic knowers, and the farthest home-
land of the lovers.”19

After bringing the “severed wayfarer” through the seven valleys, Bahá’u’lláh reveals that “to this
evanescent One of the mystic ocean, this station is the first gate of the heart’s citadel, that is, man’s first
entrance to the city of the heart” of which He cannot speak unless a “kindred soul” can be found.20
