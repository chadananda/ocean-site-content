Abstract

Islamic civilisation at its cultural height, was not only characterised by a
creative harmony between science and religion, but was open to learn
from many older traditions, secular and religious. Prior to the European
Renaissance, Islam inspired revivals in the religious and cultural
traditions of Christianity and Judaism. The aim of this paper is to show
how these spiritual reforms indicate a fundamental harmony between
Islam, Christianity and Judaism. The paper also seeks to demonstrate that
the religious reforms inspired by Islam were a necessary prelude to the
European renaissance and the modern scientific revolution.


1. Introduction

There are many references within the Baha'i writings to modern
civilisation being essentially Islamic in origin. 'Abdu'1-Bahá, the eldest
son of Baha'u'llah, the founder of the Baha'i Faith, wrote in his book,
The Secret of Divine Civilisation, that, "A careful and thorough
investigation of the historical record will establish the fact that the major
part of the civilisation of Europe is derived from Islam; for all the
writings of Muslim scholars and divines and philosophers were gradually
collected in Europe and were with the most painstaking care weighed and
debated at academic gatherings and in the centres of learning, after which
their valued contents would be put to use"1. 'Abdu'1-Bahá cited, John

William Draper (1811-1882), as one of the few European historians who
fully acknowledged the Islamic contribution2.

The grandson of 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi, states that, "The so-called
Christian civilization, of which the Renaissance is one of the most striking
manifestations, is essentially Muslim in its origins and foundations... It is
wholly unfair to attribute the efflorescence of European culture during the
Renaissance period to the influence of Christianity. It was mainly the
product of the forces released by the Muhammadan Dispensation"3.
Earlier in the same letter, Shoghi Effendi suggests that Baha'is have the
task of dispelling the "misunderstanding about Islam in the West", and
show how the Islamic teachings have "guided the course of human
development".

Of course, there is now much more well documented evidence published
in the West on the subject of Islam being the inspiration to the European
Renaissance than in 1875, when 'Abdu'1-Bahá wrote the Secret of Divine
Civilization4. But much misunderstanding about Islam in the West still
exists. The historian Norman Daniel, in his book, "Islam and the West",
describes how many western prejudices about Islam were formed during
the medieval period, and how they have persisted up to the present day5.

The Holy Wars between Islam and Christianity from the beginning of the
12th century to the middle of the 13th century mark one of the most
infamous episodes of religious fanaticism and hypocrisy in all religious
history. For Christians, the religious frenzy of seven crusades, starting
from the declaration of the first crusade in 1095 to the recapture of
Jerusalem in 1249, involved not only the killing of Muslim infidels in the
Holy Land, but spread to large scale massacres of Jews throughout
Europe.

For the Papacy, the crusades were only one of a series of wars. Others
had already been waged against the Eastern orthodox church and yet
others were being fought against the Roman Emperor, and Kings of
France and England. The general period for Christianity, is arguably, the
lowest point in all its spiritual history.

But the interaction of religions is a complex phenomenon. Through all the
killing and destruction, the crusaders were making religious and cultural
discoveries, and the beginnings of what became known as a Christian
revival was on its way. The very religion which the crusaders set out to
defeat, exercised a profound influence on medieval Christendom, both in
religious and cultural terms.

Islamic civilisation at its cultural height, was not only characterised by a
creative harmony between science and religion, but was open to learn
from many older ancient traditions, secular and religious. Prior to
bringing about the European Renaissance, Islam inspired revivals in the
religious traditions of Judaism and Christianity. The aim of this paper is
to show that these spiritual reforms were essential prerequisites to the
modern scientific revolution and demonstrate how the rise of a new
religion can revive the older ones.


2. Islamic Science

The origins of modern science are not only European. There is a standard
misconception about the growth of science - a popular myth which has
come to dominate the European mind ever since the close of the Middle
Ages. According to this myth, science originated in ancient Greece. It was
then preserved by the Arabs while Europe was plunged into the "Dark
Age". During this time, all scientific progress came to a halt. When
science was transmitted back to Europe in the 13th century it began to
bear immediate fruit. The revival of Greek learning in Latin Christendom
caused an intellectual revolution in Europe, particularly through the
works of Plato and Aristotle, and eventually culminated into the European
Renaissance out of which modern science grew6,7.

  B. Russell, History of Western. Philosophy, p 420
178             THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

Such notions of the history of science portray Europeans to be both the
originators and developers of science, while designating the role of other
cultures either as completely "barbaric" to science, or like the Arabs, to be
"preservers" of what is seen to be essentially a European heritage. How
this myth came to dominate the Western mind for many centuries is a
complex question. No doubt the propaganda associated with the crusades
provided much of the initial socio-political impetus to it, but that does not
explain its duration up to the present day. One suspects that western
technological and industrial supremacy ever since the industrial revolution
has not helped to dispel the myth, but rather encourage it. Perhaps the
dominant role played by Europe in scientific research and technological
development over the last few centuries has blinded many into believing
that Europe had always led the world in these areas. But whatever the
reasons, the historical records indicate otherwise; modern science is very
much a multi-cultural heritage. Not only were major developments to the
growth science made from non-European cultures, but they came during
the Middle Ages - precisely in the period which is most commonly
regarded as a "Dark Age" for cultural and scientific development.

From the very beginning, the popular European myth on the growth of
science is at best, oversimplified. The Ionian philosophers speculating on
the primary substance of the universe, or the Pythagoreans finding
mathematical harmonies in the universe did not arrive at their theories
from a cultural vacuum. Living on the Eastern outposts of Greek colonies,
they were brought into close contact with other cultures - older
civilisations where important scientific developments had already taken
place. The ancient Greeks themselves frequently acknowledged their debt
to the cultures of Egypt and Babylon. One cannot deny the title of science
for instance to pre-ancient Greek cultural achievements such as the
invention of multiplication and division in Arithmetic, or to the techniques
used to construct a 750 feet Pyramid base structure with only an error of
less than 1 inch, or to the measuring of the seasons by using the time lapse
between helical risings of the star Sirius as a fundamental unit. Quite
simply, the ancient Greeks greatly added to science, but they did not
create it. Their contributions in the art of deductive reasoning, in

  A. Koestler, The Sleepwalkers, p 90-1
     Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity          179

geometrical mathematics were invaluable to the subsequent development
of science. Their translation of empirical laws into general mathematical
formulae anticipated many developments in later science - centuries later.
Yet in the final analysis, ancient Greek science was an important phase in
the evolution of science, but not its parent-seed. There were many other
contributions to science that were non-European in origin, and were made
at other periods in history which proved to be just as influential to the
growth of modern science as the ancient Greek contribution. The Middle
Ages was such a time.

To designate the period from the collapse of Rome at the end of the 5th
century AD to the beginning of the 12th century AD in European history
as a "Dark Age", serves as a useful marker for historians and broadly
speaking is justified. During this period, most of Europe was overrun by
Germanic tribes whose invasions stunted cultural growth, embroiled
European people in wars and feuds whose impact lasted well over 700
years. It put an end to the early period of the Byzantine empire which had
begun with Emperor Constantine (288-337 AD) and under whose orbit
fell several important centres of learning. But to apply the term "Dark
Age" to describe the general state of science during the period of the
Middle Ages is completely inaccurate. In fact the opposite is true. While
most of Europe was undergoing a cultural dark period, science as a whole
was undergoing a particularly enlightened one. While England and France
were tormented with internal disorders and factional rivalries, and the
churches of Europe were racked with controversies over religious
doctrines such as the legitimate use of icons, the rulers of the Islamic
Empire lived in magnificent luxury in Baghdad, the cultural capital of the
world. By the 8th century, as Europe languished in the Dark Ages, the
Muslim Empire reached from Spain and southern France to the borders of
China and India, a spectacular fusion of diverse cultures and peoples,
renowned for its patronage and promotion of learning and the arts.

The Islamic culture in vivid contrast to the rural, feudal and solemnly
ascetic life of most of Europe, was urban, commercial, exotic,
cosmopolitan and in a word - modern. At the western end of the Islamic
empire, Cordoba in Spain was almost as large as Baghdad, and its
suburbs extended twenty-four miles along the river-bank. Its streets were
paved with stone and lit with lamps, there were public gardens and
180            THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

fountains, a plentiful water supply, sewers, public baths and a library.
This, compared with the rest of Europe, where the towns were muddy,
undrained, without public water supplies or sanitation; where few people
could read or write, and baths and soap were unknown.

Most important of all for the development of science - the Islamic
civilisation was a melting pot for learning, where the cultural traditions of
India, Persia, Babylon, Egypt, the Byzantium empire, ancient Greece, and
the Roman Empire were brought together under the patronage of one
language, one way of life, and one common faith. A Muslim in any one of
the many centres of learning scattered throughout the Islamic empire had
the opportunity of studying the scientific records of almost all the ancient
preceding civilisations. The mathematics, the astronomies, the medicines,
the philosophies, in short almost the whole corpus of ancient knowledge
and wisdom which evolved over millennia, merged together under the one
common lore of Islam. This multi-cultural legacy was not merely
preserved in Islamic culture, but its multi-various elements were united
together in a spectacularly creative way. The science that emerged from
this medieval cross-fertilisation of ancient cultures was completely
unique. It in many ways surpassed the scientific achievements of any one
of the individual cultures that gave birth to it - including the Greek
heritage. Islamic science is a crucial phase in the development of modern
science. Many of the methods and techniques now taken to be
indispensable to science were first conceived in the Islamic era. Islamic
civilisation is incontrovertible proof that important elements within the
development of modern science are non-European in origin and help to
show that modern science is a multi-cultural legacy - and not a Greco-
Latin one.

Take for example what would now appear to be the most basic of all
prerequisites to any science, namely numbers. So powerful a contribution
did Islamic science make in this area that our present decimal numerical
system is still referred to as "Arabic". In ancient times, a numerical
system was largely derived from some form of finger-reckoning. The
Roman number system is a good illustration of this; the Roman sign for
five for example is closely associated with the V-shape formed by the
fingers held together and the thumb extended. Although additional
symbols such as "C" designating the koman centum (one hundred)
      Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity            181

simplify the number representation, numbers are "bundled" together to
denote larger ones - and the system is cumbersome to read at a glance,
The more advanced Babylonian sexagesimal number system operated on a
base of sixty, and used the local position of numbers to construct larger
ones (their relative positions denoted different base units of sixty). Our
method of dividing time derives from this number system - the counting of
seconds, minutes and hours.

Although the Babylonian system was definitely an advance on finger-
reckoning systems, it was not until the idea of "zero" appeared as part of a
digit within the number, which the Babylonians had merely denoted by a
"blank", that a revolution occurred within number counting. This decimal
system of counting was first used by Indian mathematicians and passed
on to the Islamic civilisation during the Middle Ages.

The contribution made by mathematicians working within the Islamic
civilisation was to realise the inherent potential of the Indian decimal
system, both to commerce and science, and to convert the number system
into a visual code which allowed one to read a number at a glance. Al-
khwarizmi, a mathematician working in Baghdad in the 9th century, wrote
the first handbook on what became known as the "Arabic numerals". It
was introduced to the West by Leonardo Pisa in the 13th century. The
term "algorithm" commonly used in mathematics, derives from Al-
Khwarizmi's name. Al-Khwarizmi demonstrated basic arithmetical
operations through the use of the decimal number system, and also
included discussions on the principle of squares and roots. Al-Khwarizmi
was followed by other Muslim mathematicians. The role of these
mathematicians in the development of science is much more than being
"transmitters" as western accounts often suggest. Through their work, the
West came to understand the power with which mathematical operations
could be expressed by the Indian system of counting - a feature which is
arguably as valuable as the invention itself. The magnitude of this
contribution to the development of modern science is momentous. It is
difficult to imagine the motions of the stars, the vista of distances, angles,
laws of motion etc. that are now computed in modern science, expressible
in terms of Roman Numerals. This Indian-Islamic computing device plays
a vital role in the history of science.
182            THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

Another field of mathematical enquiry developed within medieval Islamic
civilisation is the field of Algebra. The term "Algebra" comes from an
Arabic word meaning the reduction and combining of parts, and was used
by Al-Khwarizmi as the title of his best known mathematical treatise. The
development of Algebra proved to be indispensable to the growth of
modern science - particularly in the advance of physics during the 17th
century. The two main mathematical traditions which played a crucial
role in the 17th century scientific revolution was the Geometry developed
by the ancient Greeks, and the Algebraic tradition developed within the
Islamic civilisation.

The 17th century French mathematician, René Descartes, brought these
two mathematical disciplines together in a powerful union through the
creation of co-ordinate geometry. Shortly afterwards, the English
physicist, Isaac Newton, further unified them in the development of his
differential and integral calculus. These kinds of developments laid the
foundation of mathematical physics since the 17th century to the present
day. The notion of mathematical equations is so fundamental to science
that it is difficult to imagine scientific progress without them. The
principles underlying mathematical equations and the scientific potential
of Algebra was first realised a millennium ago within Islamic culture.

Al-Khwarizmi detailed the possibilities inherent in the idea of an equation:
the idea of adding or subtracting equal quantities on either side and
maintaining the balance - like a weighing scale; or the principle of finding
an unknown quantity through establishing this equilibrium condition in the
equation. Al-Khwarizmi gave the West their first example of equations,
systematically classified according to basic problems. Mathematicians
after Al-Khwarizmi dealt with more advanced problems in Algebra, like
the famous Poet-Mathematician Omar Khayyam, who formulated and
solved cubic algebraic equations.

Algebra formed an essential complement to Greek Geometry in the
development of 17th century science. Since then, Algebra has undergone
an even greater transformation, and has gradually become more and more
abstract and yet at the same time, a more and more powerful
mathematical tool. The former ancient Greek primacy of Geometry in the
     Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity           183

mathematics of pre-modern times has, in the modern era, largely been
overtaken by methods deriving from Algebra.

Another Islamic-Indian contribution to the field of mathematics, also vital
to the development of modern science is the discipline of trigonometry.
Although the ancient Greeks had classified angles in terms of a table of
chords, it was not until the development of trigonometry, based upon
expressing angles in terms of the ratio of the sides of a right-angled
triangle - that angles were represented in terms of number ratios - and
thus made the notion of angles less dependent on geometry, making them
more abstract and flexible. Trigonometry was pioneered by Indian
mathematicians, and once again illustrates a propensity of the Indian mind
towards the more abstract. In mathematics, this tendency has proved to be
immensely beneficial. Al-Khwarizmi published Indian astronomical tables
where the trigonometric functions sine and tangent were employed. Later
mathematicians and astronomers within the Islamic civilisation derived
important mathematical relations between trigonometric functions of
different angles, and along with planar trigonometry, also developed
spherical trigonometry.

Tables of trigonometric functions were initially applied to measure angles
within the field of astronomy - they were later used by the 16th and 17th
century pioneers of modern science. Indeed, Copernicus devoted a
complete section of his famous treatise "Revolutions" to the description of
spherical trigonometry.

From the beginning of the 17th century scientific revolution, the power of
trigonometry as a mathematical aid to physics and astronomy was
immediately recognised, and trigonometry soon developed into a subject in
its own right. It greatly aided the mathematical description of the laws of
motion in Physics, and became a powerful and flexible way of expressing
the phenomena of periodicity. The significance of this perhaps needs some
explanation to the non-scientist. Wherever one looks, one cannot but help
observe wave-like periodic motion in Nature. From the motion of ripples
in a pond to the twinkling of a star (light is a wave of electromagnetic
energy), Nature is filled with energy vibrating in periodic motion. Thus it
was not until periodicity was made quantifiable, through the invention of
trigonometry, that fundamental laws of Nature were expressible in
184            THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

mathematical terms, and it is precisely this kind of advance in science
which is recognised to be one of the key developments of modern science:
namely its ability to describe Nature in more and more profound
mathematical terms.

The mathematical developments undertaken within Islamic science in
many ways surpassed the mathematical achievements of ancient Greeks.
They opened up the possibility of describing Nature in more advanced and
general mathematical terms, and paved the way for the scientific
revolution of the 17th century. Their lasting impact on the modern world
is evidenced by the fact that we still use them: the decimal system of
numbers, the methods of Algebra and trigonometry.

The contributions of Islamic science in the field of optics is a good
illustration that significant aspects to the "modern scientific method" were
developed in the middle ages, within the Islamic civilisation, and not only
in the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe. The most famous Islamic
mathematician-physicist in this field was the 11th century born Ibn-al-
Haitham, known as Alhazen in the Latin speaking world. Alhazen made
discoveries that went well beyond the ancient Greek studies in this area,
and at the same time tested his mathematical theories with a systematic
method of experimentation. He inspired men like the English scientist-
philosopher Roger Bacon in the 13th century to carry out similar
scientific experiments, and also drew praise from men like the 15th
century Italian Renaissance artist-engineer Leonardo da Vinci, and the
17th century German astronomer Johan Kepler for his contributions to
science. Alhazen's theories in optics laid the foundation of the principles
of perspective in the visual arts and his authority in the field of optics
lasted well into the 17th century where it was further developed by Isaac
Newton.

The Greeks had assumed that rays of light originated from the eye,
whereas Alhazen established the fact that they leave the luminous object
observed by the eye. He gave an accurate and detailed account of the
operation of the eye and how it functioned. He also generalised the laws of
the reflection of light from plane mirror surfaces to concave and parabolic
ones, and related the laws of refraction to the solid density in which the
light was deflected. This latter observation was extended to describe the
      Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity            185

influence of the atmosphere on the light from luminous objects in the sky.
He modelled problems in optics by mathematics. One such problem led to
him solving a 4th degree algebraic equation by geometrical means and
became known as the "Alhazen Problem" in the Latin speaking world.
Performing experiments on his ideas, he constructed ingenious mechanical
apparatus, like steel refractor lenses. In all this work, Alhazen displayed a
degree of mathematical and experimental rigour which had not existed in
ancient science and which greatly contributed to the development of
modern science - six centuries before the emergence of the scientific
revolution of the 17th century.


3. Man and Cosmos within Islamic Philosophy

The dramatic cultural differences between Latin Europe and the Islamic
Civilisation in the early Middle Ages were reflected in their respective
philosophies. The invading barbarians from the north obliterated almost
all trace of ancient learning from most parts of Europe for over 600 years
- only a few ancient manuscripts survived. Prominent among these were
some of Plato's writings. During the collapse of Rome, a Nubian priest, St
Augustine (345-430 AD) formulated a synthesis between Plato's
philosophy and Christian theology which came to dominate Christian
thinking up to the end of the first millennium AD. This "Neoplatonic"
philosophy, as it is often termed, tended to emphasise the moral and
spiritual side of man not simply alongside the study of Nature - but in
place of it. Broadly speaking, the exercise of Reason to understand the
operation of Nature was seen as a temptation to Sin. It was regarded with
suspicion, as something which inherently detracted from man's main task,
namely moral salvation.

It is important to realise here that the "Neoplatonic" philosophy that came
to be associated with Augustine, did not regard thinking about the
physical world as a possible way of uncovering deeper eternal truths, as
Plato had taught, but looked upon the contemplation of the natural world
as inherently sinful - it tended to divide man's moral nature from the rest
of the cosmos. In Plato's philosophy although the natural world was an
imperfect copy of the higher world of the Forms - there was nevertheless
186               THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ' STUDIES REVIEW

the possibility, with the use of man's rational faculty, of finding eternal
divine harmonies within it.

 Just to what extent the division between science and religion in the
Neoplatonic philosophy was inspired by Augustine himself is not clear.
He himself explicitly stated that where there is a direct clash between a
scientific fact and religious scripture, the religious scripture should be
interpreted allegorically, and the scientific fact should be accepted. But
where there is a clash between a scientific theory and scripture, the
scriptural text should be read literally, and the scientific theory should be
rejected8. But this distinction between a scientific theory and a scientific
fact is of course, a matter of interpretation. Augustine for instance, did
not accept the sphericity of the earth and the existence of the antipodes,
because he thought it was in conflict with the unity of the human race,
which was a teaching of the Bible9. Belief in a spherical earth had been
accepted by many philosophers of ancient times such as Plato, but in the
third and fourth centuries A.D, the belief in a flat earth became popular.
Augustine in this respect, not only makes a poor judgement with respect
to a scientific theory, but is also taking a questionable interpretation of
biblical scripture. It is not clear why the belief in a spherical earth should
contradict the Christian belief in the unity of the human race.

There are also other elements in Augustine's philosophy which encourage
a division between science and religion. For Augustine, understanding the
operation of Nature was regarded as "knowing for knowing's sake" and a
temptation to be avoided:

           "At this point I mention another form of temptation more
           various and dangerous... there can also be in the mind
           through those same bodily senses, a certain vain desire
           and curiosity, not taking delights in the body, but of
           making experiments with the body's aid, and cloaked
           under the name of learning and knowledge... Pleasure
           goes after objects that are beautiful to see, smell, taste,
           touch; but curiosity for the sake of experiment can go

    Augustine, "City of God", p xxxiii,
9
    ibid
       Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity          187

          after quite contrary things, not in order to experience
          their unpleasantness, but through a mere itch to
          experience and find out... Thus men proceed to
          investigate the phenomena of nature - the part of nature
          external to us - though the knowledge is of no value to
          them: for they wish to know simply for the sake of
          knowledge... Certainly the theatres no longer attract me,
          nor do I care to know the course of the stars..."10

Here Faith is put above Reason. Both Reason and the world of Nature are
separated from man's spiritual purpose. The dominant theme in
Augustine's theology is Sin, the Fall of Man from Grace, his subsequent
depravity and the Redemption possibility. In contrast to the Pythagorean
belief of purifying the soul through the study of Nature, Neoplatonic
theology seems to have the notion of purifying the soul by denying the
world of Nature, or more precisely in the context of science, denying the
impulse to study Nature. In another passage, Augustine states:

          "When... the question is asked what we are to believe in
          regard to religion, it is not necessary to probe into the
          nature of things, as was done by those whom the Greeks
          call physici\ nor need we be in alarm lest the Christian
          should be ignorant of the force and number of the
          elements - the motion and order and eclipses of the
          heavenly bodies... and a thousand other things which
          those philosophers either have found out or think they
          have found out... It is enough for the Christian to believe
          that only the only cause of all created things...whether
          heavenly or earthly is the goodness of the Creator, the
          one true God."11

Although Augustine does not explicitly oppose scientific investigation, he
warns against the danger of it becoming an end in itself, without serving
the higher spiritual purpose, his philosophy was later interpreted by the
medieval Christian community as opposing scientific enquiry. His

188               THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

theology was used to set religion against science for over 600 years in
medieval Europe.

The anti-science theology of the church was not the only barrier to the
development of science in early medieval Europe. The constant feuding,
often involving wars led by ecclesiastical authorities against secular rulers
did not create the stable social conditions under which science could
flourish. Towards the end of the first millennium AD, the Papacy had
succeeded in extending its dominion over a significant number of
territories. These worldly concerns of the church were pursued in parallel
with the austere world-denying salvation doctrine formulated by St
Augustine, and were somehow set apart. Both these contradictory
concerns, in their own ways, retarded the growth of science in Europe.

Shortly after Augustine's death, a monastic movement was started by St
Benedict. The Benedictine Order, based upon withdrawing from the world
and its inherent Sin, and instead, concentrating upon individual Salvation,
was entirely in keeping with Augustine's philosophy. Yet at the same time,
the Benedictine Order was cojoined to the political power struggles of the
papacy. A Benedictine monk, later known as Gregory the Great, became
Pope at the end of the 6th century and greatly expanded Papal power and
its dominions. He was hostile toall forms of secular learning and was able
to maintain a world-denying salvation theology while at the same time
engaging in the expansion of Papal territories by acts of war12.

The split-mind mentality of the early medieval outlook in Europe is also
illustrated by the two different types of geographical maps that were then
in circulation. On the one hand, the earth was portrayed as a tabernacle
spread over areas which had no geographical existence, such as the
garden of Eden - but had a theological significance; whereas on the other
hand, there existed the geographically accurate Portolano charts which
were used by Mediterranean seamen13. One type of map was almost
entirely theological, while the other was entirely geographical. Both these
maps, completely unrelated, existed side by side.

The divided worlds of the early middle ages also extended to cosmology.
The universe was seen as a series of heavenly concentric rings along
which the planets and the sun revolved around the earth. Each orbit
consisted of a perfect circle with its axis through the earth's centre.
Beyond the outer sphere, the ninth sphere, lay God's home the Heaven - or
"Empireo". Although it was impossible to reconcile this cosmology with
observation, the apparent irregularities of the orbits of the planets were
dismissed as unimportant - the senses after all were part of a corrupt
world which merely led man to commit sin - the senses were liable to
deceive the true believer. The world had been corrupted by Man's fall
from grace. From that time, the seasons appeared, earthquakes scourged
the earth, disease and famine became rife - and if events in the night sky
did not entirely fit into the scheme of the medieval heavenly cosmos, or if
the coastlines of the continents did not appear on the medieval heavenly
maps - this was due to the corrupt nature of man, a result of the First Sin.

Another dominant feature of the early medieval mind was that it moved
within well-defined boundaries: in space; in time; and in terms of
knowledge. In space, the ninth sphere was thought to act like a ceiling
beyond which the physical universe did not extend. In time, the universe
was believed to have been created some 5000 years in the past. The date
of this Genesis act was thought to be clearly indicated in the Bible. The
future of the universe was also seen to be finite - limited by the second
coming of Christ, which the medieval mind had expected to occur in its
foreseeable future (within generations). Religious knowledge was thought
to have been revealed once and for all in biblical Scripture, while
knowledge of Nature was thought of as being once and for all discovered
by the Ancient Greeks.

This latter point is vital to the understanding of the history of science. For
the early medieval European mind, scientific knowledge had been
completed and was closed - just like their conception of religious truth.
Science was not a matter for open investigation. Where it was to be
pursued at all, it was regarded to be a matter of reference and
classification. The Ancient Greeks came to have supreme authority - the
revealers of Gospel truth in matters of science. Knowledge of the natural
world was not a goal that the early medieval European mind attached a
great deal of importance to, but if it were sought, it was to be sought in
190             THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

the writings of the ancient Greeks, particularly in the writings of Plato. It
is for reason of these "finite" features in the early medieval mind, that its
world-view has sometimes been referred to as the "walled-in universe" -
like a medieval town's outer wall which marked a clear physical enclosure
around its inhabitants, the early medieval Christian mind placed mental
boundaries upon its own thinking.

The early European medieval walled-in universe contrasted completely
with the world-view of medieval Islamic culture. Within medieval Islam,
the acquisition of knowledge was regarded to be religious injunction
which Muslims were expected to follow. Knowledge was seen to be a
divine attribute. The Muslim believed that only God possessed perfect or
infinite knowledge, but since in Islamic tradition, as in Christian tradition,
man was created in God's image: that God had breathed His spirit into
man (S. XV:29), then man in striving to make himself more God-like
would naturally strive to attain more knowledge. Knowledge in the
medieval Islamic world was looked upon as an open-ended enquiry, and
was inextricably bound to regarding Nature as part of God's handiwork
and creation:

        "It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on
        earth; moreover His design comprehended the heavens,
        for he gave order and perfection to the seven
        firmaments; and of all things he hath perfect
        knowledge." (S. II. 29)

In the Quran it is also stated that: "Are those who know equal with those
who know not?" (S. 39:9). Such statements gave rise to many hadiths
(sayings) in Islam which encouraged the attainment of knowledge. For
instance, it was said that: "the quest of knowledge is obligatory for every
Muslim..", or that "verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the
prophets", or "seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave". Injunctions
such as "seek knowledge be it even in China" explain why Muslims were
not only open to assimilating the learning of ancient cultures, but
considered the gathering of such learning to be a sacred moral duty14.



  , H.M. Balyuzi, Nfuhammed and the Course of Islam, p 291
      Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity          191

In the Quran the "order and proportion" in the world of Nature, extends to
the soul of man and is related to his task of soul-perfection:

        "By the sun and his glorious splendour; by the moon as
        she follows him, by the day as it shows up the sun's
        glory; by the night as it conceals it; by the firmament
        and its wonderful structure; by the earth and its wide
        expanse; by the soul and the proportion and order given
        to it; and its enlightenment as to its wrong and its rights;
        - truly he succeeds that purifies it..." (S. XCI:l-9)

This celestial harmony in the universe and its natural link to the inner
character of the soul is a central pillar of Islamic metaphysics: man is a
natural part of the cosmos. Both man and the cosmos are signs of God,
and both meet in the world of God. It is not just given to man to follow
religious laws but also inherent in his character to share in the knowledge
of "order and proportion", both in the cosmos and within his soul. It is a
complete man, both moral and intellectual who looks to God for this
unity:

        "Who hath created, and further given order and
        proportion; who hath ordained laws, and granted
        guidance"
        (S.LXXXVH:l-3)

Unity - at all levels, social, individual, cosmological is the alpha and
omega of Islamic teaching. Both the universe and man are viewed as
ultimately noble and spiritual. In a well-known verse in the Quran, God is
presented as the "Light of the Universe" and at the same time a "Lamp"
shining within the soul of man where his "radiance" is revealed in "layer
upon layers" of light:

        "Allah is the light of the heaven and earth. His light may
        be compared to a niche holding a lamp: the lamp is
        encased in glass, the glass shines like twinkling star. Its
        sacred oil... is luminous though the fire itself does not
        touch it. Thus we see his radiance in layer upon
        layer."(S.24:35)
192             THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

Although the "Lamp" in this passage is often taken to refer to the prophet
Mohammed, it is clear that it also refers to an inner lamp - one that shines
within the soul of man. There is then, a profound harmony between the
moral life of man and the study of the cosmos in Islamic tradition: the
moral side of man is linked to God's presence within the soul of man - the
divine spark within. The exercise of Reason unveils the hidden signs of
God in the universe. Man is the meeting point between two universes, the
universe within him, and the universe external to him. Both find a natural
union in Islamic Faith - founded ultimately on divine unity.

In another famous passage from the Quran this unity is explicitly stated:
"We will surely show them Our signs in the world and within
themselves"(S. 41:53) and in a well-known Islamic hadith it is stated that:
"Dost thou think thyself a puny mortal form, when the universe is folded
up within thee?"15. Such statements explain why knowledge of Nature in
the Islamic civilisation was not a matter that was fixed by ancient
authority as it had been for the early medieval mind in Christendom - for
on matters of science as well as religion, only God was regarded as the
ultimate authority.

Islamic philosophers, while encouraged to seek out knowledge and
wisdom from wherever it came, did not regard it as final and complete but
subjected it to critical review - looking always to develop it. This also
explains the enthusiasm with which the world of Nature was studied in the
Islamic civilisation. Nature was looked upon as a garden, rather like the
heavenly gardens depicted in the Quran that await the devoted Muslim,
whose multi-various forms, whose numerous "order and proportions" all
reflect the presence of a heavenly light in the cosmos - and at the same
time, shine within the soul of man, "layer upon layer".

The contrast between Christians and Muslims was also apparent in the
way they regarded one another. While Christians were generally hostile to
Muslims, and frequently justified their war against them by describing
Muslims to be followers of the "Anti-Christ", Muslims had a much more
enlightened view of Christians. In the Quran, Jesus is described as a


   Attributed to Hussayn Ali, quoted by BaháVlláh in, The Seven Valleys and Four
Valleys, p 34
     Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity           193

righteous prophet (S 6:85), one having the same rank as Mohammed
himself. Where the prophets are mentioned, the Quran explicitly states
that "we make no difference between one and another of them" (S 2: 136).
The disciples of Jesus are described as Muslims (S 5:111). Muslims are
explicitly enjoined not to dispute with Christians, since their God is one
and the same: "And dispute ye not with the People of the Book... But say,
"We believe in the Revelation which has come down to us and in that
which came down to you;... Our Allah and your Allah is One..."
(S 29:46).

The light of Islamic learning only graduallyfilteredthrough into medieval
Europe over a period of several centuries. It took four complete centuries
before European thought was to become fully set aglow with the new
Islamic spirit of learning.

At first, around the end of the first millennium AD, only isolated rays
penetrated the ascetic gloom of the medieval Christian European mind; in
the twelfth century, as a result of the contact made through the crusades,
more Europeans were attracted to the Eastern light, and undertook
journeys to find it; in the 13th century, schools of thought grew up in
Europe which started to reject the former Augustinián theology for a new
one based upon the Islamic world-view; and in the period from the 14th to
the 16th centuries, the influence of the Islamic civilisation on Latin
speaking Europe effloresced into the European Renaissance.

One of the first Europeans to seek out Islamic learning was a Frenchman
known as Gerbert of Aurillac. He went to Catalonia in Spain to study
Islamic mathematics and astronomy in the 10th century. His journey to
learn from Muslims became famous, for in 999 AD he ascended to the
Papal throne and contributed towards raising the appreciation of scientific
study amongst the medieval Christian clergy. The historian, David
Knowles, writing on the influence of Gerbert of Aurillac, states that, "The
first great name in the history of medieval thought is that of Gerbert of
Aurillac, who was master of the school of Rheims c.972, and ended his
life as Pope Silvester (999-1003 AD). In his writing on logic, and still
194               THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

more in his mathematical interests and his use of Arabian sources, he was
the harbinger of many new things"16.

In the 12th century, a steady trickle of European scholars undertook the
journey across the French border into Spain and across the Mediterranean
sea to Sicily, in order to translate Arabic texts into Latin. One such man,
an Englishman named Adelard of Bath, brought back a collection of
manuscripts from his travels, which included Greek mathematical
treatises such as Euclid's famous book, "Elements". But it was mainly the
underlying philosophy behind Islamic science that these scholars brought
back to Latin speaking Europe at this time. The mathematics that was
then in use in medieval Islamic culture was not properly appreciated until
after the 14th century onwards in the rest of Europe. In contrast to most
Europeans of his time, Adelard of Bath declared:

          "Of course God rules the universe, but we may and
          should enquire into the natural world. The Arabs teach
          us that."17

Adelard of Bath stated that he had learned to put Reason above ancient
authority from his Arab teachers in matters of natural knowledge, since in
fact the ancients, who possessed authority, had themselves gained it
through the operation of Reason.

During the gradual reconquest of Spain launched by Christendom in the
12th century, European scholars began to discover the glitter of the Orient
- coming from their solemn ascetic perspective, it must have seemed as if
suddenly a window had been opened up on to an exotic life of a new
world. In the territories that had been reconquered, traces of Islam could
be found: in the elaborate ceramic decor of colourful facades, under the
horseshoe arches, the gardens, the mosques - and most important of all for
the development of science - in the libraries.

In the Islamic centres of learning the medieval European scholars found a
wealth of ancient learning, together with insightful commentaries,

17
     Adelard of Bath, edited by C. Burnett, p 16
        Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity         195

containing a vast array of scientific material which had been completely
unknown to the Latin speaking world. A translation centre was initiated at
Toledo by Alfonso VII, King of Castile and Leon, a farsighted monarch,
who thus greatly aided the flow of Islamic learning to other parts of
Europe. The overall effect of this transmission of learning was to start an
intellectual revolution without parallel in European history.

In the 12th century, although the benefits of Islamic science were still
dimly recognised, a school of learning was founded in the French town of
Chartres, close to Paris. The school was originally founded by Fulbert, a
pupil of Gerbert of Aurillac. Fulbert was a bishop in Chartres from 1006
to 1028 AD and became well known for laying down a programme of a
wide literary and philosophical culture, harmonised to biblical teachings.

At Chartres, the very beginnings of an intellectual revolution started to
take shape in Latin speaking Europe. Soon afterwards, the first European
universities at Pisa, Paris, Oxford, Bologna and Padua were modelled on
the Islamic centres of learning in Baghdad and Cordorba.

The scholars working at the school of Chartres, influenced by the newly
acquired sources of Islamic-Greco learning that found its way across the
French border from Spain, began to articulate a philosophy based upon
the fundamental harmony between Reason and Faith. William of Conches,
a leading figure in the Chartres school of learning stated:

           "I take nothing away from God: He is the author of all
           things, evil excepted. But nature with which He endowed
           His creatures accomplishes a whole scheme of
           operations, and these too turn to His glory since it is He
           who created this very nature."18

He had clearly been influenced by the Islamic injunction to seek
knowledge when he stated that: "To seek the reason of things and the laws
of their origins is the greatest mission of the believer"19.

The school of Chartres, a religious institution, was one of the first in
medieval Latin Christendom to be influenced by Islamic learning. The
commonly held notion today that the medieval church only retarded the
growth of science is an inaccurate simplification of the state of science in
the medieval period - a frequent modern misconception. It is true that the
scholars at Chartres did receive religious opposition to their new
philosophy, but in their defence, they appealed to the very same authority
from which the opposition drew - namely Christian scripture. They
emphasised aspects within Christian scripture which were different to the
austere ascetic world-denying ones. They stressed the harmony of Reason
and Faith, and not the rejection of Reason in the name of Faith, as the
medieval followers of Augustine's theology had tended to do. The scholars
of Chartres did not make any major scientific discoveries, but they do
mark a significant change in the intellectual climate of medieval Christian
Europe. They canrightlybe regarded as the first scholars within a centre
of learning in Latin medieval Christendom which arose to redress the
imbalance between Reason and Faith that prevailed in the early middle
ages in Europe, and as such, represent the first major wave of Islamic
influence in Christian Europe.


4. Scholastic Harmonies

 In 13th century Latin speaking Europe, the steadily increasing influence
of the Islamic civilisation gave rise to a distinctive philosophical school of
thought known as "scholasticism". Accounts of scholasticism in the
history of science often present it as an alliance between Aristotle's
philosophy and Christian theology. It is claimed that the rediscovery of
Aristotle's writings in Europe through Latin translations (made from
Arabic texts) started a major European intellectual revival, of which
scholasticism formed the first part. Aristotle's vast array of empirical
studies on Nature, his use of rational and logical principles to classify and
catalogue these observations, are thought to have loosened the hold of
Augustine's "world-denying" theology over the medieval Christian mind20.
But this view betrays an overt European bias. It is undeniably true that

^   A. Koestler, The Sleepwalkers, p 109
      Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity            197

Aristotle's writings exercised a strong influence over the 13th century
scholastic minds - he was the most respected of all philosophers and was
simply known as "The Philosopher", just as St Paul was referred to as
"The Apostle". But having recognised this fact, it is also true that the
scholastic system of philosophy in all its essential characteristics, existed
long before the 13th century Christian "schoolman" had "rediscovered
Aristotle".

For over three centuries immediately preceding the 13th century, Islamic
philosophers had pioneered the integration of Greek philosophy with
Islamic theology, gradually refined the resulting metaphysics, and passed
it on to the Latin speaking world in the form of commentaries on major
Greek works, or in the form of theological writings that accompanied
numerous Islamic scientific treatises. It is a testimony to the profound
unity existing between the Quran and Bible - often poorly acknowledged
by Christians and Muslims themselves, that Christian scholasticism in all
its major features, is identical to Islamic scholasticism. There is indeed
considerable irony in this fact, since medieval Christendom had launched
a series of crusades - Holy Wars against the Islamic "infidels". Yet
increased contact with these "infidels" not only "civilised" the Christian
world in matters of science and philosophy, but also helped to initiate a
reformation in the Christian theological medieval world-view. Broadly
speaking, the impact of Islam on medieval Christianity redressed the
imbalance between Faith and Reason which had existed in the philosophy
of St Augustine.

Islamic medieval philosophers considered the study of Nature to be a
religious duty which led to the recognition of God's signs in the cosmos.
They saw the rational faculty of man as the "light of God" within the
human temple, and also looked upon its use as a sacred activity. This
contrasted sharply with early medieval Christian theology which regarded
the study of Nature as a temptation to Sin. The most important feature of
scholasticism is that it was first and foremost a religious revival, and only
secondly an intellectual renewal. In fact the two were inseparably linked.
In this sense, the rise of Christian scholasticism is an important precursor
not only to the Renaissance, but more significantly to the Reformation.
Just as Muslims pointed to the Quran as their only authority in matters of
knowledge and wisdom, Christians started to point to the Bible as the
198            THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ' STUDIES REVIEW

ultimate authority in their science and religion, as opposed to ancient
manuscripts, or papal authority.

The Reformation and the Renaissance were two great changes in Europe
which were interdependent, and were two sides of the same coin. They
were both revolts against authority, based upon establishing fundamental
rights of the individual: the right to interpret scripture according to one's
own conscience, and the right to interpret the "book of nature" according
to one's own reasoning and observations. Medieval Christendom was
stirred into this spiritual and intellectual rebellion by the influence of the
Islamic civilisation. The change in the Christian medieval religious world-
view, inspired by Islam, provided the metaphysical foundation on which
modern science was built, and was one that was able to harmonise Reason
and Faith, and not emphasise one at the detriment of the other.

One of the most influential of Islamic philosophers in medieval
Christendom was Averroes, an 11th century jurist, physician and
philosopher from Cordoba in Spain. Averroes became so well known for
his commentaries on Aristotle's works, that he was simply referred to as
"The Commentator". His writings aroused considerable anti-clerical
opposition and generally caused upheaval among the intelligentsia in 13th
century Latin speaking Europe. During the 1270s, students and faculty
members at Paris were defying traditional teaching under his name. The
writings of Averroes were looked upon as subversive doctrines by 13th
century church establishments and were condemned in an explicit list of
219 "errors"21. Different groups, first in France, and then later in Italy
became known as "Latin Averroists".

The main themes pursued by Averroes in his writings were related to
demonstrating the intrinsic harmony between Reason and Faith, to extol
Muslims to study Nature as a sacred duty, and to promote the use of
rational and logical principles in this study. He constantly referred to the
Quran as his source of authority for these teachings. For instance, in a
treatise entitled "Kitab fasl al-maqal" (on the Harmony of Religion and
Philosophy), he states that the Quran enjoins Muslims to study Nature,
use rational principles, and make use of ancient wisdom:

   T. Goldstein, The Dawn of Modern Science, p 125
       Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity           199

          "That the Law summons to reflection on beings, and the
          pursuit of knowledge about them, by the intellect is clear
          from several verses of the Book of God (Quran), Blessed
          and Exalted, such as the saying of the Exalted, "Reflect,
          you have vision" (Quran S. LIX,2) this is textual
          authority for the obligation to use intellectual
          reasoning      Another example is His saying "Have they
          not studied the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth,
          and whatever things God has created." (Quran S. VII,
          185)...therefore we are under an obligation to carry on
          our study of beings by intellectual reasoning... From this
          it is evident that the study of the books of the ancients is
          obligatory by Law... "22

The Law here, refers to an explicit commandment of God, and is for a
Muslim the greatest possible form of injunction. Another central feature
to the philosophy of Averroes is the proposition that theology and
philosophy cannot contradict one another. It is not merely the stance of
holding the two to be compatible, but the view that they cannot conflict -
as a matter of principle. His position on matters where theology and
philosophy appear to conflict is to interpret Scripture allegorically. He
says: "Muslims accept the principle of allegorical interpretation, they only
disagree about the extent of its application"23. For Averroes, the use of
Reason in studying Nature can only reveal the handiwork of God. He
likens Nature to be a piece of art which glorifies the Artisan:

           "If the activity of 'philosophy' is nothing more than study
           of existing beings and reflection on them as indications
           of the Artisan, i.e. inasmuch as they are products of art
           (for beings only indicate the Artisan through our
           knowledge of the art in them, and the more perfect this
           knowledge is, the more perfect the knowledge of the
           Artisan becomes), and if the Law has encouraged and
           urged reflection on beings, then it is clear that what this


22
     Averroes, On the Harmony of Science and Philosophy, p 44-5

     ibid., p 51
200                THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

           name signifies is either obligatory or recommended by
           the Law."24

In another passage he states that "true science is knowledge of God":

           "You ought to know that the purpose of Scripture is
           simply to teach true science and right practice. True
           science is knowledge of God... Right practice consists in
           performing the acts which bring happiness and avoiding
           the acts that bring misery and it is knowledge of these
           acts that is called practical science".25

Thus for Averroes there is a fundamental unity between science, religion
and living a moral life. All are different forms of "science", and all are
inextricably linked together in the "knowledge of God". This view was
characteristic of all the great medieval Islamic philosophers and contain
the essential principle of scholasticism - a universal sense of divine unity.
Although the main thrust of Averroism was at first opposed by medieval
Christian institutions in the 12th and 13th centuries, it was thereafter
gradually incorporated into Christian doctrine.

The great Persian theologian, philosopher and physician, Avicenna, born
1080 AD, was also well known to medieval Christendom in the 12th and
13th centuries. Apart from his treatises in science, some of which
remained standard text in the field of medicine up to the 17th century in
medieval Europe, he was particularly influential in moral philosophy and
theology - in such subjects as analysing rational proofs for the existence
of God and the Soul.

In his treatise "On the existence of the Soul", he argued that Reason is the
most important of all human characteristics and that it is essentially a
spiritual phenomenon - immortal, and a sign of God within Man. He
formed a synthesis between Greek thought, particularly Aristotelian and
Islamic theology, which was to become very influential in Latin speaking


24
     Averroes, On the Harmony of Science and Philosophy, p 44

     ibid, p 63

Europe. The religious character of man's reasoning power was described
in the following way:

         "The activity most distinctive to the human soul is
         knowing consciousness. It has many uses, including
         acknowledgement, recognition, and worship of God. For
         when a person knows his Lord in thought, apprehends
         His identity in the mind, sees His grace mentally, by of
         reason, he ponders the very essence of God's creative
         act. One sees the perfection of the Truth Itself in the
         celestial bodies and supernal substances, recognising
         that they are the most perfect of all created things... one
         sees in one's own rational self a being akin to the very
         eternity and rationality of the heavenly bodies, and one
         rises in thought to the Commanding Word of the Unseen
         and recognises that command as well as creation are
         His, as He says, "Are not creation and command His?"
         (Quran 52:7). For the flowing forth of creation is
         entailed by His command".26

In this passage, it is clear that the rational self is a divinely created self
which of all human qualities bears the most likeness to God, unlike the
situation in Augustin's philosophy, where the Greek emphasis on reason
was seen to be contrary to the spiritual path of salvation. For Avicenna,
use of reason was a spiritual act, and significantly, he quotes the Quran
for the source of this belief.

The rationalism of the 17th century underlying the world-view of the
pioneers of the scientific revolution was profoundly shaped by Avicenna's
philosophy. For instance, Descartes's famous "Cogito ergo sum" (I think
therefore I am), demonstrating the primacy of the mind over the senses
derived much from Avicenna's "floating man" example:

          "One of us must suppose that he was just created at a
          stroke, fully developed and perfectly formed but with his
          vision shrouded from perceiving all external objects -

26
     Lenn E. Goodman, Avicenna, p 167
202               THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

          created floating in the air or in space, not buffeted by
          any perceptible current of the air that supports him, his
          limbs separated and kept out of contact with one
          another, so that they do not feel each other. Then let the
          subject consider whether he would affirm the existence
          of his self. There is no doubt that he would affirm his
          own existence, although not affirming the reality of any
          of his limbs or inner organs, his bowels, or heart or
          brain, or any external thing. Indeed he would affirm the
          existence of this self of his while not affirming that he
          had any length, breadth or depth. And if it were possible
          for him in such a state to imagine a hand or any other
          organ, he would not imagine it to be a part of himself or
          a condition of his existence."27

By imagining a situation where all sensory stimulation is withdrawn,
Avicenna concluded that the mind is in some sense more fundamental to
the human self than the body. It is closely related to attempting to doubt
the existence of the senses, as done for instance, in the philosophy of
Descartes. This "floating man" example was widely discussed in medieval
Christendom, and Descartes would have certainly been familiar with it.
Of course, within the Christian tradition, Augustine had already
articulated the primacy of the mind over the senses28. But Augustine de-
emphasised human reasoning with respect to man's goal of salvation, and
even referred to it as a "temptation to sin", so that theologically, Reason
was faulty. Avicenna on the other hand, described the rational faculty as a
way of discovering God's signs in the universe, and it was this latter
approach that was to become characteristic of the 17th century pioneers
of science.

In his arguments for the existence of God, Avicenna not only discussed
considerations that relate to the First Cause or the inherent Design in the
universe, but also provided a version of what has come to be known as the
"Ontological argument for the existence of God" which was later

with the mind being a sign of God in the cosmos - demonstrates the
existence of God - based upon the idea of God29. Rational arguments for
the existence of God became a prime activity for Islamic scholastic
philosophy and was continued in Jewish and Christian scholasticism.

Roger Bacon, the 13th century Englishman, already mentioned in
connection with Islamic science, and famous for being one of the first to
use modern scientific methods in Christian medieval Europe, referred to
Avicenna as "the prince and leader of philosophy"30. Apart from
performing many experiments based on Alhazen's work in optics, he is
well-known for his accurate predictions on what science would discover.
Notably, Roger Bacon cited Avicenna and Averroes to support the view
that scientific knowledge was not to be argued from ancient authority but
must entail the independent use of Reason31.

Another sign of the respect and influence that Avicenna and Averroes held
amongst the Christian scholastics was that in "Inferno", the famous work
of the 14th Italian poet Dante, they were consigned to Purgatory, rather
than Hell - this was an unusually high position to occupy for mere
"infidels".

In connection with understanding the impact of Islamic philosophy on
medieval Christendom, a point needs to be made on how the conflict of
science and religion appeared to the medieval mind in general. A scientific
way of looking at the world was identified with the work of Aristotle, and
the harmony of science and religion was in large measure translated into
the issue of whether Aristotle's philosophy was consistent with religious
scripture. This explains why certain passages from Aristotle's writings,
relating to the eternity of the universe or human immortality, became the
focus of theological controversy, first in Islam, and then later in Judaism
and Christianity.

From the modern point of view, there is no scientific evidence which
favours the eternity of the universe hypothesis, as opposed to the one
based upon creation in time. But in the medieval period, the eternity of the
universe was the scientific world view, for no reason other than that
Aristotle had stated it to be sw4sláttiic philosophers, who advocated the
Aristotelian world-view, such as Averroes and Avicenna, felt the need to
clarify Islamic doctrines with respect to it, and set out to demonstrate that
the Quran was consistent with Aristotle's philosophy. Avicenna for
instance, argued that the creation of the universe is not to be viewed in
time, but in terms of causation. The chain of causes that gives rise to the
universe occurs not in time, but in terms of priority, that is, the universe is
a timeless effect emanating from a cause lying outside time. Others within
the Islamic world did not agree with him, and so a debate between the
orthodox Muslims and the "philosophers" ensued.

Another area where Aristotle's writings set off a medieval theological
controversy was with respect to the "Active Intellect" or "Agent
Intellect". In his De Anima, Aristotle suggested that there was a passive
and active part to the human rational soul, and human thinking arose out
of the influence of the active part, an immortal entity known as the Active
Intellect, on the passive part. The controversial element to this philosophy
was that Aristotle appeared to imply that the Active Intellect was located
outside the human mind.32 Exactly what Aristotle had intended to mean is
not clear from the original text, and a variety of different interpretations
are possible. Averroes interpreted the Active Intellect to lie outside the
human mind, and describes the human mind in mainly passive sensory
terms. The Active intellect from this point of view, is the same for all
mankind. Averroes' view appeared to reject personal immortality, and was
thus brought into conflict with the orthodox religious view of the soul
surviving death. His view bears resemblance to the "Atman" of Hinduism,
which is often presented to be an impersonal entity transcending
individual consciousness and individual identity. Avicenna on the other
hand, located the immortal part of the soul within the human mind, which
although inspired by the Active Intellect, was nevertheless, separate from
it. Avicenna placed the Active intellect in a hierarchy of "divine
emanations" where it took tenth place down a chain of causes which

32
     Aristotle, De Anima, HI, 5, 430a 10-25
       Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity         205

emanated from God. Averroes' view in particular aroused opposition, both
from within Islam, and later amongst Jews and Christians.

Averroes and Avicenna formed only a part of the long line of Islamic
philosophers who developed scholastic philosophy over three centuries.
The works of philosophers such as Al-Kindi, a 9th century Arab
philosopher, and Al-Farabi, a 9th century Turk, were also known to the
medieval Latin speaking world. Their commentaries on the scientific and
religious aspects of ancient Greek philosophy, particularly on the writings
of Plato and Aristotle, and how they were related to Islamic theology,
helped to shape the chrysalis from which Christian scholasticism grew.
They were by no means all in agreement. Al-Kindi wrote in favour of the
creation ex-nihilo doctrine, while Al-Farabi advocated the eternity of the
universe. But more importantly, they were united in their openness
towards secular learning. Al-Kindi for instance wrote, "we should not be
timid in praising truth and in seeking it, from wherever it may come, even
it be from distant races and people different from us "33.

Al-kindi concentrated on demonstrating the Unity of God. He gave many
examples of the different types of unity known to man, and argued that
the Unity of God was the most noble and singular amongst them. Like all
other Islamic philosophers he put the attainment of Wisdom before the
acquisition of knowledge. This was another major characteristic of
scholastic philosophy. Although the acquisition of knowledge was
encouraged by scholastics, it took second place to the "First Philosophy"
(spiritual wisdom) which was regarded as the most important kind of
knowledge. Al-Kindi stated:

          "The noblest part of philosophy and the highest in rank
          is the First Philosophy, is knowledge of the First Truth
          who is the cause of all truth. Therefore it is necessary
          that the perfect and most noble philosopher will be the
          man who fully understands this most noble knowledge;
          for the knowledge of the cause is more noble than
          knowledge of the effect..."34

There is a certain irony here when the above statement is compared to the
modern approach of acquiring knowledge from identifying causes. The
process of scientific investigation seems to move along a chain of causes,
where each newly discovered cause is in some sense more profound than
the previous ones. The chain of causes uncovered by science seems to
proceed along in a direction of greater simplicity, where the number of
causes used to explain the world around us is constantly decreasing in
number. The notion of a First Cause is but a natural extension of this
process. The ultimate goal of all scientific investigation would of course,
be to uncover a single cause, which could explain the range of our entire
experience: explain ourselves, the universe, and our relationship to it.
Viewed in this way, science and religion do not oppose one another,
rather, religion starts where science ends.

Before Islamic medieval thought inspired the rise of Christian
scholasticism, it proved to be the source behind the reformation period of
another of the world's major religions, namely Judaism. The flowering of
Jewish scholasticism in the 11th and 12th centuries took place under the
auspices of the caliphate of Cordoba, and is another example of the
fundamental religious unity existing between the Quran and the Bible: the
golden age of Jewish philosophy echoed all the major scholastic themes
already developed by Muslim philosophers. Jewish philosophers not only
acted as a bridge between Eastern and Western medieval thought but also
greatly added to it. From within their own Hebraic tradition, they affirmed
the major tenets of scholastic thought and as in the case of their fellow
Muslim compatriots around the same period, many of their scientific
advances were founded upon this scholastic metaphysical ground.

The period of greatest stability for the Jews living in Spain occurred in the
10th century. At this time, the opulent Caliphs gave special consideration
to philosophy and poetry. They protected their Jewish subjects by law,
and allowed them to compete for the acquisition of wealth and honour on
the same terms as their Muslim fellow-citizens. The learning of science,
philosophy and poetry was consequently cultivated by the Jews with the
same zest as by the Arabs. This period of religious enlightenment was
crucial to the cultural progress inspired by Islam. Many of the
philosophers and scientists who contributed to Islamic learning were
actually Jews. In fact, so intermingled was their contribution with their
     Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity         207

Muslim fellow-citizens, that when the Christian West came to absorb
Islamic learning from Spain, they frequently mistook Jewish writers and
philosophers to be Muslims.

But in the 11th century, some Caliphs began forcibly to convert Jews to
Islam, and many Jews fled to neighbouring countries. Of course, this
persecution was still mild compared to the mass progroms of Jews that
occurred within medieval Christian communities. For the most part, both
Jews and Christians were able to live in comparative safety and freedom
under Islamic rule. When the Muslims were not preoccupied with
converting the Jews to their faith, both Jews and Muslims benefited.

The dominant concern of Jewish scholasticism, as with Islamic
scholasticism before it, was to demonstrate the harmony of science and
religion. This characteristic was the motivating force behind the most
famous of all Jewish scholastics, Maimonides, born at Cordoba in 1135
AD. Maimonides wrote in Arabic, as did most Jewish philosophers living
iň Spain. He frequently cited Islamic philosophers, with whose works he
seemed to be quite well acquainted. In his, "Guide for the Perplexed", a
long treatise written to demonstrate the unity between Jewish theology and
Greek philosophy, he gave many reasons for studying science, each
supported by references to the Torah. For example, he stated that:

        "You will certainly not doubt the necessity of studying
        astronomy and physics, if you are not desirous of
        comprehending the relation between the world and
        Providence as it is in reality, and not according to
        imagination... Consequently he who wishes to attain
        human perfection, must therefore study Logic, next the
        various branches of Mathematics in their proper order,
        then Physics, and lastly Metaphysics... The necessity of
        such a preparation and the need for such a training for
        the acquisition of real knowledge, has been plainly stated
        by King Solomon in the following words: "If the iron be
        blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to
        more strength; and it is profitable to prepare for
        wisdom" (Eccles x. 10); "Hear counsel and receive
208                 THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ' STUDIES REVIEW

           instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end"
           (Prov. xix. 20)35

Here, the studying of different sciences, Logic, Mathematics etc. are not
only linked to the many counsel^ of acquiring wisdom in the Old
Testament, but stated to be an important preparation for understanding
scripture. Maimonides thought by studying the universe, traces of God
could be found:

           "Nothing exists except God and this universe, and that
           there is no other evidence for His existence but this
           universe in its entirety and in its several parts.
           Consequently the universe must be examined as it is, the
           propositions must be derived from those properties of
           the universe which are clearly perceived, and hence you
           must know its visible form and nature. Then only will
           you find in the universe evidence for the existence of a
           being not included therein".36

But Maimonides like all other philosophers within scholasticism only saw
the acquisition of such knowledge as a means to a spiritual end - an
instrument to acquire spiritual wisdom. He stated that:

           "If the person does not know the measure of the cone, or
           the sphericity of the sun, it is not so important as not to
           know whether God exists, or whether the world exists
           without a God."37

Hence, scientific knowledge for Maimonides was always moderated by
divine knowledge. He explained that the holding of a higher principle to
the attainment of scientific knowledge should not deter one from studying
science:

     ibid., p 43

          "It was not the object of the Prophets and our Sages in
          these utterances to close the gate of investigation
          entirely, and to prevent the mind from comprehending
          what is within its reach, as is imagined by simple idle
          people, whom it suits better to put forth their ignorance
          and incapacity as wisdom and perfection... The whole
          object of the Prophets and the Sages in these utterances
          was to declare that a limit is set to human reason where
          it must halt."38

He explains that in Jewish scripture, the acquisition of knowledge is often
symbolically referred to by the taste of honey: "My son eat thou honey,
because it is good, and the honeycomb... so shall the knowledge of
wisdom be unto thy soul." (Prov. xxiv:13,14). Through the imagery of
honey, Maimonides explains that Jewish scripture counsels moderation in
the acquisition of knowledge: "Though great, excellent, noble and perfect,
it is injurious if not kept within bounds or not guarded properly..."39. He
quotes scripture to support this interpretation: "It is not good to eat too
much honey" (Prov. xxv. 27). These passages underlie a general core
principal of scholasticism, in this case illustrated from the Jewish
perspective: that knowledge was regarded as the servant of wisdom, and
the attainment of wisdom was part of a wider spiritual quest. This search
for wisdom did not detract from science, but nourished it.

On the subject of the eternity of the Universe, Maimonides was committed
to the creation ex-nihilo doctrine, and thought that it was implied by
Judaic doctrine. On the other hand, he felt the philosophical arguments
often used to advocate it were faulty, and that in general, the arguments
used by philosophers who favoured the eternity of the universe were much
stronger. He thought that Aristotle had only proposed the eternity of the
universe as a theory, and not stated it to be a fact. He set about both
showing the limitations of the creation ex-nihilo and eternity of the
universe arguments. In his discussion, his reference points were schools
of thought within Islam.

210                 THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

Maimonides discusses weaknesses in the arguments of a certain Muslim
theological school called the v Mutakallemim', who advocated the creation
ex-nihilo doctrine. He stated that their arguments were not consistent with
the "laws of nature" and that they were based only upon religious bias.

He writes:
                                        I
          "The first Mutakallemim tried to prove a proposition
          when it was expedient to demonstrate its truth; and to
          disprove it, when its rejection was desirable, and when it
          was contrary to the opinion which they wished to
          uphold.... I tell you, however, as a general rule, that
          Themistus was right in saying that the properties of
          things cannot adapt themselves to our opinions, but our
          opinions must be adapted to the existing properties".40

Not only did Maimonides think the Mutakallemim to be unscientific, but
objected to them using the ex-nihilo doctrine to prove the existence of
God. In fact, in connection with arguments concerning the existence and
qualities of God, Maimonides preferred the writings of the
"philosophers". These philosophers were Muslims, such as Al-Farabi.
Maimonides specifically cites Al-Farabi on several occasions, whom he
refers to as "Abunazar Al-Farabi". In one instance, he states that many of
the arguments against the Mutakallemim had already been developed by
Al-Farabi. Writing on the weakness of a Mutakallemim proposition, he
states, "Yet all these things have no reality and are mere fictions.
Abunazar Al-Farabi in criticizing this proposition, has exposed all its
weak points, as you clearly perceive, when you study his book on the
changeable beings earnestly and dispassionately"41.

Although Maimonides criticises the philosophy of the Mutakallemim, he
indicates that many Jews had accepted their beliefs and had not produced
any original philosophy of their own. Writing of Jewish scholars, he
wrote, "they followed the lead of the Mohammedian Mutakallemim, and
what they wrote is insignificant in comparison with the kindred works of

     Moses Maimonides, The guide for the Perplexed, p 110
41
     ibid., p 138
       Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity        211

the Mohammedians"42. In another passage, Maimonides states that some
Jewish thinkers identified themselves with the vMu'tazilah\ an Islamic
theological school that flourished in the 8th and 9th centuries. In
connection with the Islamic philosophers, he stated that "our Andalusian
scholars followed the teachings of the philosophers, from whom they
accepted those opinions which were not opposed to our own religious
principles"43. All this shows that Jewish scholasticism arose out of the
matrix of Islamic scholasticism and was inextricably linked to it.

A profound theological resonance between the Quran and Torah lies in the
unity and essential transcendence of God. It was in this connection that
the philosophy of Maimonides had its lasting impact. He described the
route to God in a negative way: that God was best understood in terms of
what He is not. Maimonides stated, "Know that the negative attributes are
the true attributes: they do not include any incorrect notions or any
deficiency whatever in reference to God while positive attributes imply
polytheism, and are inadequate... we cannot describe the Creator by any
means except by negative attributes.."44. Maimonides cites scripture for
this view, "To whom, then, will you liken me" (Isaiah xl. 25), or "There
is none like unto Thee" (Jer. x. 6)45. This is of course, a point of unity
between Muslims and Jews, and there are many similar passages in the
Quran, such as Sura 42:9, where it is written of God that, "There is
nothing like unto Him".

The Christian scholastics were generally not as well informed about
Islamic theology and philosophy as their Jewish counterparts. Their
approach was generally a hostile one. There were of course, obvious
political reasons for this, very few Christians could be seen to praise the
enemy. From the 13th century onwards, the learning that Christian
Europe absorbed from Islam was not generally acknowledged to be
Islamic, but claimed to be a combination of Aristotelian philosophy and
Christian theology. All these points are clear in the works of the most

famous of all Christian scholastics, St Thomas Aquinas, a 13th century
Italian priest.

Aquinas wrote the treatise, "Summa Theologicae" as an attempt to
demonstrate the inherent harmony bd^veen Reason and Faith. On the one
hand he encouraged the study of science stating for instance that: "There
is a place for the authority of reason: the grace of God does not replace
but fulfils it"46, or elsewhere stating that: "We know God in all we
know"47. On the other hand, in characteristic scholastic tradition, he
emphasised the limits to human reason: "God has destined us for a goal
beyond the grasp of reason"48.

Aquinas derived much of his knowledge about Islamic philosophy from
his Master, Albertus Magnus (Albert the Great), who lived in the early
part of the 13th century. Albert Magnus was one of the greatest
transmitters of Greek and Islamic philosophy to the Christian scholastic
world, he spent over fifty years assembling one of the largest store houses
of medieval learning in Europe. He frequently cited Avicenna in his
works, to whom he referred with admiration and appreciation49.

Aquinas, gives similar arguments to those presented by Muslim and
Jewish scholastics before him, in describing how science and religion were
compatible. The main message, that the use of reason unveils traces of
God in the universe, and is in harmony with religious revelation, is in this
instance, supported with references to Christian scripture. Aquinas gave
four reasons, two of which are quoted below, of why he thought
"consideration of creatures is useful for building up man's faith in God":

          "This meditation on the divine works is indeed vnecessary
          in order to build up man's faith in God. First, because
          through meditating on His works we are able somewhat
          to admire and consider the divine wisdom. For things

         made by art are indications of the art itself, since they are
         made in the likeness to the art. Now God brought things
         into being by His wisdom: for which reason it is said in
         the Psalm: "Thou has made all things in wisdom" (Ps ciii:
         24). Hence we are able to gather the wisdom of God from
         the consideration of His works, since by a kind of
         communication of His likeness it is spread abroad in the
         things He has made. For it is said (Eccles 1:10), "He
         poured her out", namely wisdom, "upon all His works":
         wherefore the psalmist after saying: "The knowledge is
         become wonderful to me: it is high, and I cannot reach to
         iť, and after referring to the aid of the divine
         enlightening, when he says: "Night shall be my light",
         etc., confesses himself to have been helped to know the
         divine wisdom by the consideration of the divine words
         saying: "Wonderful are Thy works, and my soul knoweth
         right well" (Ps cxxxviii: i-vi). Secondly, this
         consideration leads us to admire the sublime power of
         God, and consequently begets in men's hearts a reverence
         for God. For we must needs conclude that the power of
         the maker transcends the things made. Wherefore it is
         said (Wis. xiii:4), "If they", the philosophers, to wit,
          "admired their power and their effects", namely of the
         heavens, stars, and elements of the world, "let them
         understand....that He that made them is mightier than
         they". Also it is written (Rom. I: 29): "The invisible
         things of God.... are clearly seen, being understood by the
         things that are made: His eternal power also and
          divinity". And this admiration makes us fear and
          reverence God. Hence it is said (Jerem, x.6, 7): "Great is
          Thy name in might. Who shall not fear Thee, O King of
          nations?"50.

The above references to biblical scripture from one of the greatest
expounders of Catholic theology, conveys exactly the same meaning as
the scripture quoted by Maimonides, and those quoted by Avicenna and

50   St Thomas Aquinas, The Summa Contra Gentiles, The second book, chapter 2, p2-3
214                  THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

Averroes from the Quran, and indicate a fundamental line of unity
between the Islamic, Jewish and Christian Faiths. Aquinas was however,
writing against the former tradition of Augustine. The core of his
message was not accepted by the European Christians of his day. He
acknowledged this, and he specifically cited Augustine for being in error
with respect to separating the "truth of Faith" and "opinions one holds
about creatures":

           "Accordingly it is clear that the opinion is false of those
           who asserted that it mattered not to the truth of faith
           what opinions one holds about the creatures, so long as
           one has a right opinion about God, as Augustine relates
           in his book De Origine Animae: since error concerning
           creatures by subjecting the human mind to causes other
           than God amounts to a false opinion about God, and
           misleads the minds of men from God, to Whom faith
           strives to lead them"51.      +

The considerable influence that Islamic philosophers had on 13th century
Christian theologians is also apparent on the issue of the Active Intellect
and the nature of the human soul. Aquinas wrote a treatise entitled, "On
the unity of the intellect against the Averroists"52. In it, he quotes from the
Works of Avicenna and Abu Hamid Al-Ghazzali, an 11th century sufi
mystic Islamic theologian who lived in Bagdad. Ghazzali was known as
Algazel in Christian Europe.

After citing the views of Avicenna and Algazel on the soul, Aquinas,
states, "Now these things we have said first, not as though wishing to
reject the above error by the text of the philosophers; but to show that not
only the Latins, whose words some do not relish, but also the Greeks and
the Arabs were of this opinion.."53. This citation indicates that Aquinas
wrote his treatise not for Muslims, but for his fellow Christians who held

the writings of the "Greeks and Arabs" in great esteem, and who were
committed to Averroes' conception of the human soul.

Elsewhere in the same treatise, Aquinas states, "Now what they [the
Averroists], say is clearly false, namely that it was a principle among all
philosophers, both Arabs and Peripatetic, though not among the Latins,
that the intellect is not multiplied numerically. For Algazel was not a
Latin, but an Arab. Avicenna, too, who was an Arab, speaks this in his
book, On the Soul,..."54. The Latin "Averroists" were particularly active
at Paris in the 12th century, such as the Priest, Siger of Bibrant. Here,
Aquinas also appears to be unaware that Avicenna was a Persian. He
thought that Algazel wrote in support of Avicenna's works, by only
having an incomplete part of Algazel's works. In fact, the opposite was
true, Algazel's work, "On the incoherence of the philosophers", was
actually a refutation of Avicenna's philosophy55.

Although Aquinas had rejected Averroes' conception of the human soul,
he had in large measure accepted the Avicennian hypothesis that the
Active Intellect was located outside the human soul. Like Avicenna, he
believed the human soul to be immortal and thought that the function of
the Active Intellect was to inspire and cause progress in the soul. The
Avicennian synthesis of the Aristotelian and Islamic doctrines of the soul
was accepted by most Christian scholastics with minor modifications. The
transmission of Avicenna's views, apart from Latin translations of his
work De Anima, were made by some Christian theologians, such as the
Italian priest Gundisalvi, who lived in Spain in the 11th century, and who
was a translator of many Islamic works56. Gundasalvi wrote a treatise
entitled De Anima', where he essentially advocated an Avicennian
doctrine of the soul. The historian D. Knowles notes that:

          "The great scholastics of the mid-thirteenth century, who

          literature of the works upon the soul and its powers,
          stretching back from Gundisalvi and the Arabs to the
          works of Aristotle. Their first impulse was to apply the
          system of Avicenna to clarify that of Augustine, making
          of the agent intellect of the former the divine illumination
          of the latter. Then, when Averroes appeared, with his
          commentary on Aristotle, they were faced with new
          difficulties. Some, and among them, Siger of Bibrant, at
          least in the early stages of his career, adopted the
          Arabian philosopher's solution of the problem. Others,
          and chiefly Albert the Great, and Aquinas, while using
          both Avicenna and Averroes, based themselves on the
          pure doctrine of Aristotle's De Anima..."57.

Aquinas claimed that he based his theology on the philosophy of Aristotle
and the Bible, historically, this misleading interpretation of scholasticism
has come to dominate European history. It is however, only partially true.
Aquinas, as with his Master Albertus Magnus, largely adopted an
Avicennian conception of the soul, where the religious doctrine of the
immortality of the soul was combined with Aristotle's Active Intellect.

The 17th century pioneers of modern science were for the most part
scholastic disciples. Their continual emphasis on science uncovering the
handiwork of God; of the intrinsic harmony between Reason and Faith;
the acquisition of Wisdom being the supreme human goal; the limits to
human reason when compared to the world of God, all these sentiments
echoed medieval scholastic philosophy. Moreover, the natural harmony
between reason and faith incorporated in such a vision, was vital to the
growth of modern science.


5. The Renaissance Man

It is often thought that the Humanist philosophy which lay behind the
Renaissance was a rebellion against Scholasticism58. But this was true

57
     D. Knowles, The Evolution of Medieval Thought, pl97

only with respect to the details of scholasticism and not with respect to its
general principles. Those elements of scholastic philosophy which
incorporated Aristotle's specific theories - such as his earth-centred
cosmology, were overturned. But this did not destroy the foundation of
scholasticism. In fact quite the reverse is true. The Renaissance was a
time where much of the unity formulated within scholasticism came to
fruition.

"L'uomo universale" of the Renaissance was artist, craftsman,
philosopher, inventor, humanist, scientist, astronomer and monk all in
one. Science, Religion and Art were so intermingled that it was difficult to
distinguish between them. It is not easy to tell whether a drawing of
Leonardo da Vinci was intended as a piece of art or for anatomical
demonstration - it was seemingly for both. A similar situation existed for
maps: were they pieces of art or drawn to guide travellers? The answer
again seems to be both. In fact scientific developments evolved side by
side with artistic innovations. Map projection for instance developed
alongside perspective drawing for 150 years during the Renaissance
period, both locked together in a mutually fruitful relationship. The
construction of Gothic cathedrals united technical dexterity, artistic
beauty, and spiritual aspiration - all in one. They epitomised the
scholastic vision of Reason being harmoniously guided by Faith. They
were all external symbols demonstrating the medieval belief in an inner
universal order.

The inner spiritual aspirations of Renaissance man and his harmonious
relationship to his environment take material form through the Gothic
cathedral. The moral, the rational, the empirical, the artistic, the physical,
all find union in a building directed towards the world of God.

Another common misconception concerning humanism is that it arose out
of a resurgence of Plato's philosophy in Europe, and in particular, to the
Pythagorean elements within Plato's philosophy. According to this view,
the universe as a mathematical order, inherent in Pythagorean-Platonic
philosophy began to replace the influence of Aristotelian Logic in
European intellectual thought59.

218             THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

While it is true that the humanist movement did place greater emphasis on
mathematics rather than logic, this influence did not only come from
ancient Greece. In fact the period between the 14th to 16th centuries saw
the fresh translations of Islamic mathematical manuscripts into the Latin
speaking world, and as a result, a/renewed interest in mathematics in
Europe was engendered. Both Algebra and Trigonometry were
transmitted to medieval Christendom during this time. Biagio for example,
an Italian mathematician, living in the 14th century, presented simple
algebraic operations as a part of practical arithmetic. In the 15th century
quadratic equations were solved by geometric means - as they had been in
the Islamic civilisation. These developments in Islamic science were
transmitted primarily via universities in Italy. Studies in trigonometry
were made from Arabic texts by Regiomontanus, a German astronomer
who lived in Northern Italy in the 15th century.

Regiomontanus made explicit use of the sine function, stated the laws of
the sines, and wrote a treatise on spherical trigonometry, from which
Copernicus is supposed to have borrowed but not acknowledged.
Regiomontanus built his own astronomical observatory, and is regarded
as one of the first astronomers in Latin speaking Europe who succeeded in
treating astronomy as an exact science. The work of 17th century
scientists drew much from his astronomical work. In fact Regiomontanus
is known to have hinted at the notion of the motion of the earth, long
before Copernicus formulated the heliocentric theory. Regiomontanus
stated that: "It is necessary to alter the motion of the stars a little because
of the motion of the earth"60.

Another humanist, vital to the development of Renaissance science in the
15th century was the German ecclesiast-mathematician, Nicholas of
Cusa, who also lived in Northern Italy. Nicholas of Cusa is most famous
for his statements concerning the earth not being at the centre of the
universe and being in motion. He made these statements at least twenty
years before the Copernican theory was formulated. Nicholas of Cusa
stated for instance, that:




   A. Koestler, The Sleepwalkers, p 212
       Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity          219

          "Since, then, the earth cannot be at the centre, it cannot
          be entirely devoid of motion... It is clear to us that the
          earth is really in motion though this may not be apparent
          to us, since we do not perceive motion except by
          comparison with something fixed."61

Neither did Nicholas of Cusa confine his thinking to Aristotelian
principles of uniform motion, or circular Platonic celestial orbits, in which
he was, in both respects, well ahead of his time - certainly far beyond the
later conceptualisations of Nicholas Copernicus. Cusa maintained that:

          "Moreover, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor any
          sphere - though to us it seems otherwise - can in (its)
          motion describe a true circle, because they do not move
          around a fixed base... nor is (anything) ever at one time
          (exactly) as at another, neither does it move in a
          precisely equal (manner)..."62

Cusa also believed that stars were made of the same kind of materials
found on earth, thus refuting the ancient Greek notion of the heavenly
bodies being stainless and perfect. He stated for instance that:

          "...It cannot be said that this place of the world (is less
          perfect because it is) the dwelling place of men, and
          animals, and vegetables that are less perfect than the
          inhabitants of the region of the sun and of other
          stars..."63

In all these remarkable speculations, Nicholas of Cusa exhibited a
rebellion against the traditional knowledge of his day. He based much of
his speculations on the conception of the universe as a mathematical
order, which has no natural centre and is unbounded. Cusa for instance
stated that." number is the first model of things in the mind of the

           64
Creator" . Nicholas of Cusa gained much of his mathematical knowledge
from Islamic sources. He read the Arabic language and was considered to
be one of the most knowledgeable Europeans on the Islamic culture of his
period. In fact Cusa wrote a treatise on the Quran in which he stated that
the prophet Mohammed's impulse Ůf be essentially good, and that the
Quran had genuine religious merits. His treatise, although a Christian
polemic against Islam, was nevertheless quite unlike the blatantly abusive
Christian polemics against Islam of his period. Cusa favoured establishing
a dialogue as a means of settling Islamic-Christian rivalries. In fact he
was involved in Peace negotiations with the Turkish Islamic world in the
hope of averting war in the early 15th century.

Cusa's dissatisfaction with the Ptolemaic theory was no doubt also
influenced from the controversy surrounding the theory within the Islamic
civilisation. Some Muslim philosophers objected to the Ptolemaic system
on the grounds that it did not conform to the Aristotelian principles of
uniform motion in its complex system of epicycles. Alternative
astronomical schemes were devised which did not violate any Aristotelian
principles of motion. Although these schemes were not successful, they
were known to the Latin speaking world. It was precisely this controversy
that led Averroes to state that: "The Ptolemaic astronomy is nothing so far
as existence is concerned; but it is convenient for computing the non­
existent"65. Such statements would have been well-known to Cusa, and
perhaps indirectly to Copernicus, who set about revising the Ptolemaic
theory precisely for the reasons of it not conforming to the Aristotelian
principle of uniform motion. At the Universities of Cracow and Bologna
where Copernicus studied, the mathematical tradition of Cusa and
Regiomontanus was very much alive. In fact Copernicus at the beginning
of his "Book of the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres" had put the
motto: "for mathematicians only"66. There is no doubt that the wider
influence of Islam, not just the rediscovery of ancient Pythagorean-
Platonic harmonies within Latin speaking Europe, lay at the foundation of
the humanistic movement of the Renaissance. Nicholas Rescher, in his

     A. Koestler, The Sleepwalkers, p 209
66
     ibid., p 222
       Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity          221

book "Arabic Studies" has written of this Islamic influence in the
following way:

          "In the Italian Renaissance of the 15th to mid-16th
          centuries, Averroism exerted a great influence in the
          study of the philosophy of nature at Padua and Bologna,
          with the result that Arabic philosophy was operative as a
          significant force in the intellectual ferment that underlay
          the work of Galileo and saw the beginnings of modern
          science."67

Single events in history rarely explain very much on their own. They may
sometimes serve as a convenient marker to separate different periods in
history, as events relating to the progress of science in the 17th century
signify the beginning of a modern era in our history and the end of a
medieval one. But such historical dividing lines are clearly plagued with
an inherent degree of arbitrariness and inaccuracy. The dangers of
compartmentalising history by these rough markers should always be
borne in mind and one should be willing to revise the boundaries. Any
historical event takes place in a wider scheme of beliefs and perceptions.
Events are integrally linked to and formed out of a certain world-view,
sometimes articulated, but more often than not, unexplicated. To choose a
once popular turn of phrase, events are formed within a certain
Weltanschauung. The roots of the modern scientific world go back much
further than the 17th century. The background "Weltanschauung" from
which the scientific discoveries of the 17th century were made, was
initiated by the rise of Islam in Arabia, formulated in its essential
characteristics under the spectacularly cosmopolitan Islamic culture,
further developed as it gradually gave rise to Jewish and Christian
scholasticism, and culminated in the explorations and historical revolts of
the Renaissance. There is no simple dividing line between the medieval
era and the modern one, just as there is no single culture from which the
European Renaissance grew. The Renaissance is not European, neither is
the 17th century uniquely modern compared to the centuries before it.

222             THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

During the so-called "Dark Ages" in Latin speaking Europe, generally
thought to be barren for the progress of science, vital technological
developments were made from which the craft tradition of the European
Renaissance grew. It was during this period for instance that the heavy-
wheeled plough was invented, whifch allowed the use of horses in the
process of ploughing, thus saving labour and time. The invention of the
water-wheel also dates from this "Dark" period, which was subsequently
used in Mills to grind corn, creating a food surplus - without which the
building of towns, cathedrals, universities etc. during the Renaissance
period could not have been carried out.

Opening up the scope for sea travel, the medieval inventions of the stern-
post rudder, Lateen Sail, and bowsprit, enabled boats to be kept at sea for
months on end. The historian Arnold Toynbee compares the increase in
sea exploration with the steppe-borne horse used earlier by the Eurasian
nomads in the following way:

        "The steppe-borne horse had conveyed its nomad rider to
        the back doors of all the civilizations of the Old World;
        the Ocean-borne ship conveyed its Western navigator to
        the front doors of all civilizations on the face of the
        planet. The Modern Western sailing-ship was an
        instrument and the symbol of the West's ascendency in
        the World during a Modern Age of Western history..."68

The widespread exploration of the seas, the revolution in crafts, arts and
sciences during the Renaissance period, were made possible only through
these aforementioned "Medieval" inventions.

The Renaissance arose out of a world-wide interpenetration of cultures.
The craft tradition that arose during the Renaissance, generally
acknowledged to be the forerunner of the empirical method in modern
science, owed much of its development to Chinese science. The
introduction of Chinese inventions such as the magnetic compass,
gunpowder, and paper making into Europe during the early Renaissance
period greatly facilitated the subsequent rise of 17th century science.

   A. Toynbee, An Historians Approach to Religion, p 145
       Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity         223

Paper making, which came via the Islamic civilisation in the form of
block-printing, led to the dramatic rise in literacy which is well-known for
having made the historical revolt of defying Papal authority possible - by
making copies of the Bible available to everyone who could read.
Moreover, the popular rejection of the authority of the ancient Greeks in
secular learning, a characteristic feature of humanist philosophy during
the Renaissance, was also made possible only by their writings attaining a
wide degree of accessibility through the use of printing.

The Renaissance was a time of discovering New Worlds. The sense of
adventure and exploration that arose from these discoveries was felt well
into the 17th century. Francis Bacon, the famous 17th century populariser
of modern science wrote the following about the new spirit of discovery:

         "The world sailed around, the largest of the Earth's
         continents discovered, the compass invented, the printing
         press sowing knowledge, gun-powder revolutionising the
         art of war, ancient manuscripts rescued and the
         restoration of scholarship, all witness to the triumph of
         our New Age."69

It was this confidence in a New Age, of new explorations and adventures
that characterised the vision of the 17th century pioneers of modern
science. They enthusiastically embarked upon a path of intellectual
discovery with the same zeal and sense of adventure that their
predecessors had set about charting the unknown seas of Africa, or set
about sailing for the "New World". Yet all these advances and discoveries
were made with an underlying medieval conviction of an inner moral
order.

The great exploits and discoveries of the Renaissance have their roots in
the spiritual renaissance of an inner vision. It was a vision that was
mathematical as well as being spiritual, rational as well as moral, artistic
as well as scientific. All these advances, including those made within 17th
century science, carry with them an inner confidence, a balance of science
and religion that took centuries to develop, in which three of the world's

69   J. Marks, Science and the Making of the Modern World, p 44

major religions, working from within their own spiritual traditions came
to harmonise their theology with ancient forms of wisdom and give
inspiration to the rediscovery of nature. The metaphysical ground upon
which the Renaissance and the modern scientific revolution stood was not
only multi-cultural, but also multi-faith. Modern science grew out of the
chrysalis of religious world-views.


6. Medieval Islam and Baha'i Teachings

There are aspects of medieval Islam that correlate with and help clarify
some Baha'i teachings. The first relates to the Baha'i belief that
civilisations are founded by religion. 'Abdu'1-Bahá, after describing the
great cultural achievements of Islam, writes, "The purpose of these
references is to establish the fact that the religions of God are the true
source of the spiritual and material perfections of man, and the
fountainhead for all mankind of enlightenment and beneficial
knowledge"70 . The culture inspired by Islam, including its impact on the
Christian West, provides one of the most clear examples in all religious
history of the civilising effects of religion. This paper has attempted to
illustrate how characteristics vital to the success of Islamic culture, such
as its openness to all forms of learning, its inherent balance between
science and religion, and religious tolerance, can be directly traced to the
text of the Quran.

The second observation concerns the relationship of science and religion.
From the Baha'i perspective, the harmony of science with religion is a
fundamental balance upon which individual and collective progress is
made. Religion and science are likened to the two wings of a bird. Around
the turn of this century in Paris, 'Abdu'1-Bahá stated that:

             "Should a man try to fly with the wing of religion alone
             he would quickly fall into the quagmire of superstition,
             whilst on the other hand, with the wing of science alone



70   1
         Abdu'1-Bahá, Secret of Divine Civilization, p 94
       Medieval Islam: the Influence on Judaism & Christianity          225

         he would also make no progress, but fall into the
         despairing slough of materialism"71.

The importance of harmonising religious beliefs with science is clearly
reflected in the success of Islam. Generally speaking, the most influential
strand of thought in early medieval Christendom tended to reject science
in favour of religion, and as a result, European Christian communities
were characterised by a "quagmire of superstition". The impact of Islam
redressed this balance. Both Islamic civilization and the European
Renaissance which Islam inspired, were characterised by their
harmonious integration of scientific, artistic and religious sentiments.
Many of those who contributed most to cultural progress during these
periods operated simultaneously as philosopher, theologian, scientist,
artist, and engineer.

The need for a balance between science and religion is also an urgent
concern today. But unlike the medieval period, the most influential strand
of thought in modern times rejects religion in the name of science, and
many of today's modern societies evoke 'Abdu'1-Bahá's image of being
in a "slough of materialism". Redressing the balance today may well
involve strengthening religion.

The third observation relates to the search after truth. In the Baha'i Faith,
an earnest "search after truth" is a fundamental prerequisite to
establishing the harmony of science with religion and also the fundamental
unity between religions. 'Abdu'1-Bahá stated this principle in the
following way,

          "When we are earnest in our search for anything, we
          look for it everywhere. This principle we must carry out
          in our search for truth. Science must be accepted. No
          one truth can contradict another truth. Light is good in
          whatsoever lamp it is burning! A rose is beautiful in
          whatsoever garden it may bloom! A star has the same
          radiance if it shines from the East or from the West. Be
          free from prejudice, so you will love the Sun of Truth

71   'Abdu'1-Bahá, Paris Talks, p 143
226               THE SINGAPORE BAHA' STUDIES REVIEW

          from whatsoever point in the horizon it may arise! You
          will realize that if the Divine light of truth shone in Jesus
          Christ it also shone in Moses and in Buddha. The
          earnest seeker will arrive at this truth. This is what is
          meant by the 'Search after Tfuth' "72

It is perhaps no accident that medieval Muslim religious tolerance and
cultural diversity went hand in hand with an openness to learn from
ancient secular and religious traditions. The search after truth by medieval
Muslims led to their appreciation and assimilation of cultures as far away
as China and India, and was a decisive factor in their cultural success.

The search after truth is not the primary characteristic which is associated
with religious people today. This study of Islamic civilisation suggests
that for a spiritual and cultural renaissance to recur, religious people must
once again become genuinely truth orientated and truth centred, so that
they can rise above their theological prejudices, not just in their words,
but in their deeds.
