        BAHÁ’Í-INSPIRED PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN RIGHTS

Rights and Responsibilities in the Bahá’í World Order

Rights and Responsibilities in the Bahá’í World
Order: From “Me” to “Us”—Confronting the Fear

BY MARTHA L. SCHWEITZ

The international field of human rights is fraught with conflicting assump-
tions and worldviews, accusations of cultural hegemony or alternatively of self-
serving cultural relativity, and arguments about whether universality is desirable,
necessary, or possible. These disputes reach an impasse most readily when
they concern the priority of the individual versus the community, often ex-
pressed in terms of choosing to confer priority either on individual human
rights or on individuals’ responsibilities to society. This essay proposes that
this presumed conflict—between the need to fully protect human dignity and
equality and the need to foster the well being of society as a whole—is false.
It is submitted that the essential goals of the liberal human rights regime can be
achieved while also creating communities that are more unified and conducive
to the common good than is generally believed possible in modern Western
societies. Bahá’í principles offer a way to do both, and Bahá’í communities in
every culture around the world offer emerging models, still in infancy, of how
to put these principles into practice.

To Western human rights advocates, any attempt to legally link human rights
with human responsibilities is suspect. Such linkage is a hallmark of socialist
legal traditions, under which the exercise of individual rights is dependent
upon the performance of duties to society. In such legal systems, rights are a
contingent grant of the state, rather than an entitlement belonging to every hu-
man being.1 The socialist position is anathema to the essential liberal concept
of human rights, defeating the very purposes for which that concept was histori-
cally created: to protect individuals from tyranny, and from oppressive and
abusive claims of social duty or the collective good as determined by unac-
countable authorities. Nevertheless, as U.S. society is reportedly beginning to
rediscover the value of community, and to entertain the thought that an indi-
vidual rights approach alone may not be sufficient to achieve social justice and
human fulfillment, the question is before us again: where is the ideal balance

Rights and Responsibilities in the Bahá’í World Order

between individual freedom and the good of society as a whole? Is this image
of a “balance”—implying that for one side to go up the other must go down—
the right image?

All people are conditioned in our thinking, our concept of self, our rela-
tionships and worldviews by what we have experienced and learned growing
up in our native cultures. As incontrovertible as this fact may be, and as fre-
quently acknowledged as it is in human rights debates, its full implications are
still usually ignored in the first person. The Western human rights tradition is
not only a legal heritage but a set of cultural and social assumptions that perme-
ate individuals’ views of themselves and of their relationships to others, to
society, and to governmental institutions. People in Western societies do not
disavow social responsibilities. Most would acknowledge that they have count-
less responsibilities, either voluntarily assumed or flowing from citizenship,
to a range of people and institutions, including family, friends, neighbors, em-
ployer, civic or private organizations, government, and perhaps even to society
at large. The question is whether these responsibilities have any direct con-
nection to rights, and how the exercise of rights affects all of these human
relationships.

It is not within the very limited scope of this essay to explain systematically
the Bahá’í teachings on human rights, the Bahá’í view of service to humanity as an
essential purpose of life, the new institutional order ordained in the Bahá’í
writings, or even the Bahá’í principles on community building, as essential as
these are to the points being made. Much of this is set out elsewhere in the
present work.2 The purpose is rather to suggest some perspectives—cultural,
legal, and psychological—to help explain why those of us with a generally
Western upbringing have such difficulty imagining how a unified society could
be created without unacceptably compromising individual rights. Unless we
understand why we believe what we believe, we cannot loosen the hold that
culture and upbringing have on our minds. Recasting the boundaries between
individual and society requires probing the assumptions and wholly legitimate
fears underlying Western individualism. These are evaluated here in light of
Bahá’í principles. It also requires a mind open to the possibilities of social
evolution, based on changed assumptions and a new institutional order. To be
independent in our investigation of truth, a core Bahá’í principle, demands no
less.

There are passages in the Bahá’í writings that, taken alone, could support the
liberal Western view of human rights; others could support the socialist ap-
proach (which also resembles the approach of many traditional “non-modern”
societies). There are countless references in the Bahá’í writings to individual
rights, to abolishing prejudice and all forms of discrimination, to the duty to

Rights and Responsibilities in the Bahá’í World Order

speak one’s views frankly, and to the central spiritual duty to investigate truth
without bias. The individual is “the focus of primary development” in society,
and the Universal House of Justice has the constitutional duty to “safeguard the
personal rights, freedom and initiative of individuals.”3 Shoghi Effendi wrote:

> The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh, implies the establishment of a
> world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and per-
> manently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal free-
> dom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely
> safeguarded.4

Such passages confirm the Western view of the necessity and even central-
ity of individual rights in creating a just society in which all can flourish. Other
passages in the Bahá’í writings suggest a different view:

> The Bahá’í conception of social life is essentially based on the principle of the subordina-
> tion of the individual will to that of society. It neither suppresses the individual nor does it
> exalt him to the point of making him an antisocial creature, a menace to society. As in
> everything, it follows the ‘golden mean.’5

To some readers, the foregoing statement comes as welcome assurance of
restoring balance to an unbalanced world, of promoting the good of both indi-
viduals and society as a whole, without sacrificing the well being of either. For
others, reference to “the principle of the subordination of the individual will
to that of society” is a red flag. Governments, armies, and others (certainly not
limited to those of socialist heritage) have waged atrocities against human be-
ings the world over in the name of perverse claims of the “good of society” or
the “good of the state.” But what are we to make of “the principle of the subor-
dination of the individual will to that of society” when it is joined in the Bahá’í
writings with powerful defenses of human rights? This is new. This combina-
tion raises questions that communities and governance systems have not yet
addressed, much less resolved. This is the basis for the claim that, in the Bahá’í
system, human dignity and equality can be fully protected while also fostering
the well being of society as a whole and building unified communities.

It is more accurate to say that the Bahá’í writings blend seemingly diverse
ideals, rather than balancing them or compromising between them. A 1988 let-
ter of the Universal House of Justice to the Bahá’ís in the United States, pub-
lished under the title, Individual Rights and Freedoms in the World Order of

Rights and Responsibilities in the Bahá’í World Order

Bahá’u’lláh (hereinafter Rights Statement), is a preeminent example of such
blending with respect to free speech rights and the responsibility to build
unity in one’s community and society. This letter was motivated by noticing
Bahá’ís in the United States “invoke Western liberal democratic practices when
actions of Bahá’í institutions or some of their fellow Bahá’ís do not accord with
their expectations.”6 The Rights Statement emphasizes the nature of the Bahá’í
administrative order and its distinction from previous governance structures,
the requirements of freedom, the appropriate avenues and methods for criti-
cism within the Bahá’í community, the role and right of freedom of expression,
and the love that is necessary to build peace and unity on the foundation of
justice. The Rights Statement is a model of how to approach the blending of
ideals, based on an analysis of ultimate purpose. It also goes a long way to-
wards bringing to light the assumptions of Western tradition, both those that
are worthy of the future of humanity and those that need to evolve. This essay
attempts no such comprehensive analysis, but does in its conclusion return to
the question of ultimate purpose: development of the individual not only as a
political or economic actor but as a spiritual being, who requires relationships
and community to achieve full human potential.

So, how does one begin to achieve independence in the investigation of
truth? What is at issue here is not the possibility of attaining truly objective
knowledge, which has preoccupied philosophers for centuries and is now, in
the age of quantum physics, considered virtually impossible, but rather increas-
ing degrees of detachment from the views of others. Bahá’u’lláh, the Founder of
the Bahá’í Faith, wrote that through justice, “thou shalt see with thine own eyes
and not through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and
not through the knowledge of thy neighbor.”7 The more highly educated we
are, the more we like to believe that we are the masters of our own thoughts,
free of external control, but the persistence of cultural differences belies this
notion. Education is one way to escape cultural conditioning, but it must be an
education that challenges one’s assumptions rather than consistently and implic-
itly reinforcing them.

Another path to increased detachment from one’s upbringing is to live in a
foreign culture long enough for it to cease being foreign, long enough to dis-
cover that your view of your home culture has changed and that your thought
patterns are shifting. The following sketch comparing life in Japanese society
to life in the United States demonstrates, lest there be any doubt, that there is
more than one way to live. Generalizations are offered not as accurate descrip-
tions of every member of a given society, but as reflecting ideas that Japanese
and Americans in fact hold about themselves and about each other. This ob-
server has lived in each country long enough to become thoroughly unsure as to

which extreme—U.S. individualism or Japanese communitarianism—is more
threatening to human well being or holds more promise of evolving towards
the “golden mean.”

The United States and Japan—One Planet?

A Western foreigner newly settling in Japan will at first be surprised by
stories of junior high school students who are ostracized or worse for wearing
the wrong socks with their school uniform, or who are expelled from school
for coloring their hair. Surprise will give way to deep concern when this Western
foreigner realizes that most of her Japanese university students are incapable
of formulating an interesting question for class discussion, in either Japanese
or English, and that even those who could do so will never voluntarily speak in
class unless coerced. Concern yields to distress when this foreigner learns that
her own outspoken seven-year-old daughter, after only one year in Japanese
school, now refuses to answer a teacher’s question until she is sure what answer
the teacher is looking for, in fear of making a m-i-s-t-a-k-e. The teenage sui-
cide rate in Japan is off the charts. Widespread domestic violence is only now
beginning to emerge from being shrouded as a private family matter. The Japa-
nese saying, “the nail that sticks up gets hit down,” takes on ever deeper and
more pernicious meaning the longer one remains in Japan and understands the
implications of Japanese-style communitarianism. 8

A Japanese foreigner newly settling in the United States will at first be
surprised by the sloppy appearance of students on their way to high school and
by how much free time students enjoy, with few evening or weekend classes.
Surprise will give way to concern when this Japanese foreigner realizes that
most of her American university students not only eat their lunches during lec-
tures, but expect their teachers to be available at their beck and call to discuss
at length any idle question that occurs to them or to challenge their grade on a
quiz. Concern yields to horror when this foreigner learns that anyone in the
United States, not only police officers, may own a gun, most of them legally. In
the United States, the likelihood that one will be a victim of violent crime
(other than domestic violence) is heavily dependent on the neighborhood in
which one lives and works, which in turn depends primarily on one’s economic
advantages, which correlate strongly with one’s race or ethnicity. The American
advertising slogan, “have it your way,” takes on ever deeper and more perni-
cious meaning the longer one remains in the United States and understands the
implications of American-style individualism.

Americans are shocked at the lack of individuation in Japan, at the lack of
what is viewed in the United States as personal moral maturity and autonomy

typical for an adult, and the low level of apparent public debate and concern
over profound issues of social justice, such as the status of permanent residents
of Korean ancestry. But Japan is a country where every child receives a decent
public education, where the differences between the best and the worst public
schools are tiny by U.S. standards, where virtually every (legal) resident is
covered by affordable national health insurance, and where the levels of pov-
erty and violent crime are a small fraction of those in the United States. Granted,
all of these systems are coming under increasing stress in Japan with the cur-
rent economic recession, but the differences in how these human needs are
handled in the two countries remain astounding.

Japanese are shocked by the lack of personal security in the United States,
physical and otherwise, by public incivility and rudeness, and by the extreme
segregation by economic level of housing, from mansions and sprawling sub-
urbs to inner cities and dangerous subways. But the United States is a country
where almost anyone (relative to Japanese practice) has a chance to train for a
new job at any stage of life, where women are (almost) the peers of men in
many public and private institutions, where university education is among the
best in the world, where public interest groups have some effective voice in
politics, where it is no longer publicly acceptable to be overtly bigoted or
extremely sexist, and which is struggling severely but making some progress
in figuring out how to create a harmonious and just society out of the hugely
diverse population that is the United States.

Are all of these differences between Japan and the U.S. (and these are only
some of the most obvious) due to the two societies’ respective views of the
individual and society, of human rights and human responsibilities? Probably
not. Japan and the United States are radically different cultures, each with long
histories of social and political evolution and revolution that barely intersected
with one another. But their respective communitarian and individualistic roots
clearly have something fundamental to do with all of the social, political, and
cultural differences between them.

The Spectrum

Japan and the United States do not represent opposites but rather points on
a line. Societies or governments that place primary value on the individual, and
those that place primary value on the collective or community, can be located
along a spectrum of possibilities. The United States may be considered a state
of strong individualism, and Japan a state of strong communitarianism.

In the individualistic state, even young children are imbued with an indi-
vidual rights orientation, prone to argue loudly about whether a game is fair,
about what they have a right to do (such as take their ball and go home), and how
no one (often including their parents) has the right to tell them differently.
Such a society tends to perpetual disruption and conflict, as competing rights
claims clash. Given ordered systems for public and private dispute resolution,
however, members of such a society generally accept this persistent contention
as a fact of life, as a necessary part of the process for resolving rights claims
and thereby achieving some level of social justice, since it appears that no
better way has been found.

In the communitarian state, young children are imbued with a sense of their
responsibilities to the group, with the need to belong and to find their identity
in belonging, and they are punished by exclusion, be it to the hallway of a
school or to the outdoor back steps of their home.9 In Japan, children and adults
alike are largely defined by relationships to their “sempai” (seniors) or “kohai”
(juniors), and by the respective duties or privileges that flow from these rela-
tionships of status. Such a society has rigid structures of authority, in both public
and private life and institutions, and obedience to rules and to those in power
is generally considered a virtue.

In the individualistic society, the overall aim of social organization may be
described as “social justice,” whatever that may mean to various segments of the
population. Unfortunately, justice is often reduced to meaning getting one’s
way, taking revenge, or proving someone else wrong. In the communitarian
society, the overall aim is “social harmony.” While harmony obviously has much
to commend it, it can also be reduced to meaning only a superficial quiet, a lack
of overt conflict or a condition of prevailing homogeneity and passivity, born
of tight social controls and the need or desire to please certain others.

As far apart as the United States and Japan are on the spectrum of individu-
alism and communitarianism, this spectrum continues further in both directions.
Beyond the individualistic state to the “left” is libertarianism and anarchy. To
the “right,” beyond the communitarian (but politically democratic) state is to-
talitarianism and autocracy. It would seem that human civilization, on the global
scale and through the long ages of history, has in the main managed to advance
from both primitive extremes. Compared to these poles, Japan and the United
States represent considerably more moderate forms of governance and social
structure, in terms of the balance between wholly unfettered individual will
and absolute unfettered and unaccountable authority. The challenge and oppor-
tunity offered to humanity by Bahá’u’lláh is to take the remaining steps toward
the golden mean, to the ideal blending of individual autonomy and community
cohesion, called in the Bahá’í writings, “unity in diversity.”

Shoghi Effendi describes the future “world federal system” not as a
compromise or trade-off among various prevailing systems, but as “blending
and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West.”10 It is generally per-
ceived that one ideal of Eastern cultures is their emphasis on community and
relationships; one ideal of Western societies is their emphasis on individual
autonomy and moral choice. The mandate of the nascent global Bahá’í commu-
nity and institutions is to blend these ideals. In a blending, as distinct from a
compromise, the essence and virtue of both individualism and communitarianism
are preserved. What is jettisoned are the unfortunate extremes to which East
and West have both succumbed. An individualistic society does not necessarily
have to be self-centered, fractured, morally adrift, and greedy. A communitarian
society does not necessarily have to be conformist, exclusionary, authoritarian,
and ethnocentric. A characteristic of the maturity of civilization should be the
capacity to blend ideals, and to distinguish between the core of an ideal value
and its mutation into a harmful or even pathological extreme.

Assumptions Underlying the Liberal Concept of Human Rights

Western attachment to the moral and social primacy of the individual is
intimately linked with the traditional Western concept of human rights. That
concept, which has been both defended and critiqued eloquently and repeat-
edly, need not be addressed at length here. But it is useful to identify certain
assumptions underlying the Western human rights concept, and to pay particular
attention to free speech rights in the United States in comparison with interna-
tional treaty standards. This example shows that even free speech is not an
absolute right under U.S. law (as is sometimes supposed by non-lawyers), and
that the judicial interpretation of what is and is not protected speech reflects
value choices that may not serve the present needs of the highly pluralistic U.S.
society, let alone the world.

Human rights are a very distinct category of rights claims, distinguished, for
example, from contractual, legal, or moral rights. Contractual rights are acquired
voluntarily by a party upon entering into a valid contract, and generally depend
upon performing one’s duties to the other party. For example, in a sales con-
tract in which money is to be exchanged for a computer, the seller has no claim
to the buyer’s money apart from the contract, and only has a claim to the money
under the contract if she delivers the computer. Legal rights are those that the
relevant legal system recognizes, generally implying that there are legal means
available to pursue a remedy if the right is violated. Such rights may flow from
private agreements (contracts), from laws and governmental regulations, or from
the national constitution directly. Moral rights is a term most often used to

assert a claim to a right that is not a legal right. While many legally enforceable
rights are also considered moral entitlements, a right is sometimes said to be
“only” a moral right when the legal system does not recognize it. Legal rights
differ among countries, but moral rights claims may be even more diverse,
reflecting the different values held by individuals and groups within a single
society.

In contrast to contractual, legal, and moral rights, the traditional Western
concept of human rights is that they are rights belonging to every human being,
simply by virtue of being human. 11 They are not given by any government, and
therefore cannot be taken away by any government. Thus, they need not be
legal rights. The concept assumes the moral equality of every human being,
positing that every person is equally entitled to respect and to protection of his
or her dignity. One’s human rights are expressly not contingent on fulfilling
duties of any sort. To condition human rights on performance of responsibili-
ties would be to assert that human rights derive from some social relationship
rather than from one’s simple humanity, and this would gut the concept.

The independence of human rights from responsibilities does not mean that
an individual cannot be deprived of the enjoyment of a right, through legiti-
mately constituted criminal justice procedures, as a consequence of criminal
conduct. For example, a person may be imprisoned (restricting the right to
freedom of movement) as punishment for theft, in some places sentenced to
death (terminating one’s right to life) upon conviction for murder, or have their
children taken away (restricting parental rights) as a consequence of being con-
victed of child abuse. But in no case does proving the absence of criminal
conduct or fulfillment of a duty come first. In other words, one does not need
to show that one is a good parent in order to have parental rights, that one is a
good citizen in order to have the right to vote, that one does not discriminate
against others in order to be entitled to equal protection of the laws, or that one
has something worthwhile or truthful to say in order to be entitled to freedom
of speech.

The question of what particular rights are or are not human rights consistent
with the traditional Western concept remains a subject of some debate, but at
the core are the essential civil and political rights plus the right to own prop-
erty. The overall purposes of these rights are generally to provide equal op-
portunity to all (as distinguished from equality of outcome or results), to allow
everyone to participate on an equal basis in the democratic political process
and the legal system, and to ensure that otherwise the government leaves people
alone to speak, choose, and do as they please. Due to the nature of these rights,
the party with primary responsibility for protecting them is the government
and its agents. For example, the government has a legal duty not to discriminate

based on race, religion, national origin, sex, etc., but individuals have no such
duty, provided that they are acting in their individual capacity in a “private”
sphere of activity.

In the traditional Western concept of human rights, can rights ever be lim-
ited or restricted? The theory holds that the only justification for limiting a
human right is to protect another person’s human right. There is only one right
which may be said to be “absolute,” subject to no limitations whatsoever, and
that is freedom of belief and conscience, because its exercise can never inter-
fere with another’s right. All other rights may be limited, including how one
practices one’s beliefs or expresses one’s conscience. For example, one may
not handle snakes dangerous to the public in the name of religious practice, nor
burn crosses in another’s front yard. There is also a doctrine that gives narrow
play to protecting “public order,” that has been invoked, for example, to pro-
hibit bigamy in the name of religious observance, but other examples of its use
are rare. When courts must choose between two competing rights claims, they
engage in a balancing process. It is instructive, for example, to examine the
limitations in U.S. constitutional law on free speech, perhaps the most cher-
ished U.S. rights tradition, to see in what circumstances other rights are given
priority.

The principal exceptions to the free speech right guaranteed in the First
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution are obscenity, defamation, and creating an
immediate physical danger. The reason for excluding obscenity from protec-
tion is not some competing right not to be exposed to it (although this concern
does enter into zoning restrictions for pornographic but not obscene establish-
ments), but is based on an analysis of the kind of “speech” Congress had in mind
when it adopted the Amendment. For similar reasons, “commercial speech,”
i.e., advertising, enjoys some but not full constitutional protection. Defamation
laws prohibit speaking or publishing that harms another’s reputation in certain
ways, but only if the statement is false. In other words, people have a right not
to have their reputation smeared by false statements, but have no right to be
protected from damaging but accurate statements. The other right that may su-
percede another person’s right to free speech is the right to physical security.
According to the classic example, one has no right to scream “Fire!” in a crowded
movie theatre when there is no fire.

The central principle in free speech doctrine is that, absent the foregoing
exceptions, speech must not be restricted on the basis on its content. The First
Amendment, as currently interpreted and applied by the U.S. Supreme Court,
protects an individual who wishes to say or publish even the most hate-filled
racist muck, provided that it will not be likely to create immediate physical
danger. Thus, a racist speech given to a group of like-minded listeners is per-

mitted. The same speech given on a street corner where it is likely to provoke
a riot is not. The danger of future riots, not to mention all other forms of human
suffering and social conflict that will predictably flow from a proliferation of
hate groups, is considered legally too remote or speculative to justify denying
the right to free speech.

The foregoing example illustrates how out of step the U.S. system is now
with international standards. States parties to the Convention on the Elimina-
tion of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, that entered into force in 1969,
agree to “condemn all propaganda and all organizations which are based on
ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour
or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and dis-
crimination in any form, and … shall declare an offence punishable by law all
dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred … .”12 In compar-
ing this standard to U.S. law, it is apparent that the U.S. system (that is, the
Constitution as currently interpreted by the Supreme Court) places a higher
value on individual free speech rights than it does on creating a racism-free
society, or at best feels that it is too hard to define hate speech without endan-
gering constitutionally protected speech. On wonders whether the U.S. public
generally would agree.

The supreme value placed on free speech under U.S. law is based on the
notion of the “free marketplace of ideas.” The remedy for “bad” speech (that
which arguably has no value or is destructive of social values) is not to censor
it but to allow more speech, on the assumption that flooding the system with
information is how the public shapes its opinions and learns to distinguish,
according to each individual’s own value system, what is good and what is bad.13
Nevertheless, to allow racial hate speech seems prehistoric, as if the govern-
ment is trying to maintain a stance of moral neutrality toward the issue, a neu-
trality that is belied by our nation’s more recent legal and social history. The
human right of an individual to be a racist cannot be disputed, as there can be no
justification for a government to dictate permissible beliefs to individuals. But
that does not imply the right to act on those beliefs nor to disseminate such
ideas, when they are socially divisive in the most profound way: by explicitly
denying the principle of human equality on which the concept of human rights is
supposedly based.

The U.S. Constitution has been referred to by one writer as embodying a
“morality of noninterference,” viewing individuals as “atoms of self-interest”
and the struggle for power as a zero-sum game. Safety from man’s “insatiable
appetite for power” was presumed to flow from rules reinforcing separation:
separating legislative from executive from judicial, federal from state, gov-
ernment from commerce, government from the people, and people from people.

This mindset is identified by that (male) writer with a prototypical male view,
that equates adulthood with autonomy and individual achievement. He contrasts
this with the prototypical female view, which equates maturity with responsi-
bility and the capacity to care for and empower others. The female approach
seeks security in relationships and in connections, and is suspicious of the male
view as justification for indifference and unconcern. 14 The argument is not that
the female view should replace the male, but that both need to be reflected in
our laws and institutions to create a balance which is more fully human.

This gender analysis is one approach to understanding the need for further
evolution in Western constitutional rights structures. Another is to see the shift
from a highly individualistic approach to an approach that gives wider scope to
an individual’s sense of concern and responsibility as the move from an adoles-
cent stage of newly discovered individuation to a more mature concern with
one’s place in the larger world. Another may be to see this stage of radical
individualism, along with the strong Western human rights tradition that accom-
panies it, as a historically necessary stage in order to obliterate, permanently,
any claim of legitimacy for tyranny and oppression. The argument can be made
that in order to overcome these evils it has been necessary to place the indi-
vidual squarely above society, to ensure that human rights trump any collective-
good policy justification. But evolution of civilization need not stop there.

The conclusion suggested by this look at the assumptions underlying the
traditional Western concept of human rights is not that they have all been su-
perceded or become unnecessary. On the contrary, by giving rise to national
governments based on a central purpose of protecting individual rights, human-
ity has gradually discovered and developed over the course of recent centu-
ries the concept of limited government or constitutional government. This is a
profound step forwards in political organization, particularly considering that
it followed on the era of the divine right of kings. In a constitutional system, by
definition, there are limits placed on the powers of government, the structure
of government is set out along with provisions about how the system can accom-
modate change over time, basic rights are guaranteed, and a system is estab-
lished to ensure authoritative interpretation of the constitution itself.
Constitutional government is an advance in civilization that is to be treasured
and guarded. The question is, what kind of constitution is necessary for the next
stage in the evolution of human society? Bahá’ís believe that the writings of the
Faith contain, as Shoghi Effendi terms it, the “charter” of future world civiliza-
tion. 15

The Bahá’í writings that compose this “charter” set out laws and principles,
ordain an institutional system from the local through international levels, allo-
cate the powers of interpretation and elucidation of the charter itself, and form

the basis upon which a full legal system may be developed in the future. By
addressing issues from obligatory prayer to the prohibition of slavery, from
the requirements for marriage to condemning tyranny and violence, from ex-
hortations to truthfulness to punishments for certain crimes, it is unlike any
constitution known. 16 Its universal, comprehensive, and irrevocable principles,
all of which may be said to derive from and promote the central value of the
oneness of humanity, constitute the framework within which all Bahá’í institu-
tions must operate. The overarching social purpose of these principles is to
create unity in diversity, and to create it through justice. “The light of men is
justice. Quench it not with the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny. The
purpose of justice is the appearance of unity among men.”17 “Justice and equity
are two guardians for the protection of man.”18

Preserving and defending the body of rights that today are considered in-
ternationally to be fundamental civil and political rights (although not necessar-
ily entirely as now interpreted in U.S. law) would seem to be an essential
element in achieving this justice and in accomplishing the aims both explicit
and inherent in the concept of the oneness of humanity. But in the Bahá’í system
justice alone is not the final goal. The purpose of justice is unity, and unity
requires that rights be joined by responsibilities. Unity does not require that a
new raft of responsibilities become legally enforceable, and, in this writer’s
view, fundamental rights should remain wholly legally independent of respon-
sibilities.19 But in tandem with legal development, achieving unity requires a
profound psychological shift in how we understand both our rights and our
selves in relation to our community and society.

The Psychological Factors—What Are We Afraid Of?

Those of us who have been raised with American-style individualism face a
number of real barriers if we venture to consider recasting the relationships
between ourselves and our families on the one hand, and our society and social
institutions on the other. At both the personal level and the level of social
policy, we seem to be held back by certain fears, all of which are entirely
rational, given our circumstances. Nevertheless, these fears may be examined
and questioned. As has been emphasized earlier, it is a great challenge to sepa-
rate what is meritorious in individualism from the cultural habits of self-
centeredness, supposed moral neutrality, and greed that it has engendered,
while at the same time recognizing that the alternative is not to bounce to an
opposite extreme of stifling conformity. The principles of community build-
ing in the Bahá’í teachings express an unusual blend.

At the most basic personal level, the primacy of individual autonomy ap-
pears to be so extreme that we are afraid we will lose our selves if we be-
come part of anything at all (the image of imprinting at birth on John Wayne,
archetypal cowboy of American movies, comes to mind.) We seem to fear,
consciously or otherwise, that if we join a group or commit to being part of a
community, without keeping a substantial psychological distance:

> 1. I will have to be like everyone else and act like them;
> 2. I will have to agree with what others say or at least pretend to agree;
> 3. I will have to like everyone else or at least be nice to them all;
4. I will have to take on responsibilities to others that I may not always feel

like fulfilling;
> 5. my independent initiative will be limited; and/or,
6. I might have to admit dependence on others or that I am not fully self-

sufficient.
What are the assumptions about the characteristics of community implied in
these fears? How do these assumptions compare to principles of Bahá’í com-
munity building? If this list is even partially accurate, it is apparent that fear of
having to conform (#1 and 2 above) is a basic problem in community building in
our society. Of course, many groups (social, religious, political) do demand
from their members a high degree of conformity, and to this extent the notion
of belonging has been given a bad name. According to Bahá’í principles, a com-
munity must thrive on diversity of all kinds: race, gender, ethnic background,
social class, language, culture, educational experience, religious temperament,
family styles, personality types, even diverse styles of learning and expres-
sion. As Shoghi Effendi stressed, uniformity in matters of principle is essen-
tial, diversity in everything else is encouraged.

Conformity in thought or behavior should not be confused with the conse-
quences of the exercise of choice. A fundamental purpose of our Western free-
doms is to enable individuals to make their own life choices. Every significant
choice one makes necessarily forecloses other options. For example, when
one becomes a Bahá’í, one is choosing to give up the prerogative to join the
KKK, to run for partisan political office, to drink alcohol, and to engage in
other behaviors that are contrary to Bahá’í laws and principles. The fact that all
members of the community make these same choices is not evidence of confor-
mity, but of acting on shared principles and values, freely chosen as a result of
one’s faith in Bahá’u’lláh. Every choice exercised is a choice to forsake the
freedom to choose that which is incompatible with the first. That is the meaning

of the verb, “to choose.” A perpetual state of total freedom, meaning a continu-
ing state of available but unexercised choice, would not seem to have much
value in adult life.

As for other elements in the list above, independent initiative (#5) is pre-
served in a Bahá’í community; in fact individual initiative is referred to in the
Bahá’í writings as the source of power of a community. It is also raised to an
additional community level, as individuals should discover in a Bahá’í commu-
nity that their own initiative can often contribute to progress in collective ac-
tion, as well as be improved itself through consultation with others.
Acknowledging one’s dependence on human relationships (#6), as well as one’s
capacity to learn to care for and be responsible for others (#4), are essential to
community life, and reflect spiritual reality described in the Bahá’í writings.
These are necessary aspects of personal spiritual growth.

As for the remaining element above, Bahá’í community life does require
being nice to others (#3). More specifically, “love, respect and courtesy” are
among the “spiritual requisites for all successful Bahá’í relationships.”20 Why
do we have such trouble with this, to the point of sometimes even claiming that
such “manners” (itself a mischaracterization) are a limitation on freedom of
expression? In American society, does one have a “right” to be rude, insulting,
or thoughtless? This is not an entitlement included in the U.S. Bill of Rights or
in any human rights treaty, and would seem somewhat contradictory to protect-
ing human dignity, but it is not uncommon for Americans to claim that they are
entitled to speak to anyone in any manner they please at any time. Perhaps this
claim is based on the assumption that anything not prohibited by the govern-
ment is acceptable. If so, this assumption reflects an extremely limited view of
human society. Laws have never been intended to be the sole guides of human
behavior, but simply the last resort and safety net to prevent behavior most
destructive to society or harmful to others. To imagine that the safety net is the
standard itself, that law has replaced morality (regardless of the extent to which
moral standards are agreed in a given society), seems to be a characteristic of
our individualistic rights-oriented society. On some level, we seem to think
that we should “feel free” to do anything at all that a law does not proscribe,
even though very few people actually live their lives that way. People gener-
ally do impose upon themselves all kinds of extra-legal limitations and re-
quirements, and may or may not be aware of where those values have come
from in their lives.

It is useful to compare the foregoing list of fears and apprehensions with
those that underlie the stereotypical fear of commitment upon entering into
marriage. Marriage is sometimes portrayed in our society as the most severe
encroachment on personal freedom, e.g., “ball and chain.” Yet anyone fortunate

enough to have experienced a good marriage, or who is closely acquainted
with someone who has, knows that nothing could be further from the truth—in
a good marriage. The freedoms, prerogatives, and greater level of autonomy
that one “sacrifices” to be part of a good marriage are not considered a loss by
the partners. A partner in a good marriage has learned by experience that the
value of the relationship far exceeds what was given up, and may even deny that
anything of value had been sacrificed. The same is true for those who have
successfully entered into community with others in forms less intimate than a
marriage.

When considering political questions of human rights and governmental au-
thority rather than personal issues of autonomy, why are we afraid to let go of
the supremacy of the individual? Subordinating the individual will to the good
of society means, to our knowledge, that the state can dictate where you live,
where you work, how many hours you must work, what you will earn, who will
take care of your children while you work, how many children you may have,
who you may marry, with whom you may associate, what you must profess to
believe, and what you can read. This is expressly not what “subordination of
the individual will” means in the Bahá’í system. Bahá’í law and principles di-
rectly contradict such repressive governmental restrictions. It may tax our imagi-
nation to discover other meanings of “subordination of the individual will” that
are compatible with basic human rights, but it can be done.

Beyond the specific practices of oppressive governments, past and present,
we are afraid of what we cannot foresee. We are afraid of what we do not know
and have not experienced. Even if we are inspired to try to blend the ideals of
East and West, we do not know exactly where we are going. It is hard enough to
handle a change process when one knows with some confidence what the out-
come will look like. But to work for change based on principles—on applying
both the transcendent and more specific principles of the Bahá’í writings to
whatever may be the current conditions at a given time and place—is a severe
psychological challenge. This process is bound to produce anxiety and discom-
fort, along with excitement, inspiration, and enticing glimpses of the possibili-
ties. For example, to approach gender equality, we need to give up many of our
gender-stereotyped identities, but in the Bahá’í writings there are no clearly
defined definitions of masculinity and femininity with which to replace them.
This is what principle-based learning is about, as distinguished from rule-based
learning or following a developed model, and it is what Bahá’ís are called to
do. As the popular book title (on time management) reads, “feel the fear and do
it anyway.” Bahá’u’lláh has prepared us to expect radical change: “The world’s
equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great,
this new World Order. Mankind’s ordered life hath been revolutionized through

the agency of this unique, this wondrous System—the like of which mortal eyes
have never witnessed.”21

Along the path of this process of blending ideals, there seem to be two
particularly deep pitfalls to avoid. The first is myopia. Because the Bahá’í writ-
ings embody a combination of ideals on a variety of subjects, it is extremely
easy to read selectively and thereby justify or feel comfortable with one’s own
current assumptions, whatever they may be. One can emphasize honesty and the
frank expression of one’s views or the responsibility to be courteous and re-
spectful; the sanctity of motherhood or the requirement that women become
the peers of men in public life; the prohibition on backbiting or the desirabil-
ity of consultation with one’s Assembly to solve problems. In all of these cases,
it is not a question of choosing one or the other. It is figuring out how to do both
at the same time. The same is true with respect to blending the rights of indi-
viduals with the responsibilities necessary to create unified societies.

The other pitfall is the pendulum swing. When our values are questioned, a
human tendency is to assume that the only alternative is an opposite extreme.
Or, as we try to engage in a change process and to move away from our habits,
we overshoot the golden mean and land on the other side. This is a conse-
quence, again, of the principle-based learning process. We are not comfortable
with this process, and habitually seek a model to follow. The only alternative
models available are likely to be just as far from the mean in the other direc-
tion. This can happen, for example, when someone who has generally distrusted
authority and institutions becomes a Bahá’í, thus finding good reasons as well as
a spiritual basis to come to think that authority in certain forms is a good thing.
But the result may be that he or she behaves for a time in a manner that is rigid
or domineering, or otherwise displays negative expressions of authority. Prin-
ciple-based learning, intertwined as it must be in the Bahá’í system with per-
sonal spiritual growth, is a perpetual challenge.

The greatest fear likely to be aroused by the Bahá’í teachings on social
evolution is that it is advocating not only values but a system of governance
derived from revealed religion. It is beyond the scope of this essay to explain
how the Bahá’í administrative order differs from other systems, to further de-
scribe the protections inherent in its constitution, or to explain why the prin-
ciple of obedience to decisions of elected Bahá’í institutions instills confidence
in the Bahá’í community rather than fear. The Bahá’í governance system needs to
be examined on its merits, as well as in light of its claim to divine origins. It
would be a great loss if our devotion to our Western traditions, that have given
rise to such progress in governance, would render us incapable of considering
that they too must evolve and develop in response to change and in order to
release still-untapped human potential. The advances and lessons of the past

few hundred years are a vital foundation for the future, but they are not the end
of the story.

An Emerging Sense of Responsibilities—A Proposed Universal Declaration

As high as the psychological barriers to community building may be, and as
strict as the Western tradition has been about separating rights from responsi-
bilities, few have ever supposed that a good society could be created on the
basis of rights alone. The difficulty has been to reach agreement on what re-
sponsibilities members of society share, and on whether they should be le-
gally codified.

The debate about the relationship between rights and responsibilities goes
back, in the Western tradition, at least as far as the French Revolutionary Parlia-
ment of 1789. Nearly half of the members of that Parliament who voted for the
Declaration of Human Rights voted also for a proclamation of human responsi-
bilities. More recently, the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, adopted as a United Nations General Assembly resolution in 1948, in-
cluded one article on responsibilities. Article 29 states, “Everyone has duties
to the community in which alone the free and full development of his person-
ality is possible.” The Declaration also acknowledges the needs of the general
welfare, stating that the only limitations on rights are those necessary to protect
the rights of others or to meet “the just requirements of morality, public order
and the general welfare in a democratic society.” A few years ago, in honor of
the 50th anniversary of that Declaration, a significant initiative was launched to
increase individuals’ sense of responsibility to each other without compromis-
ing human rights. The InterAction Council proposed a Universal Declaration of
Human Responsibilities.22 Its primary drafter was Dr. Hans Küng, President of
the Global Ethic Foundation, who also drafted the Declaration Toward a Global
Ethic, adopted by the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago in 1993.

The Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities was intended as an
ethical appeal, put forward for international debate, in an attempt to establish a
standard that can be adopted by all people. It was intended as a complement to
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to reinforce and strengthen it.
Whereas the latter eventually led to the adoption of many human rights trea-
ties, the initiative of the InterAction Council is specifically not aimed at legal
codification. “Precisely because community and morality cannot be prescribed
[as legal obligations], the personal responsibility of citizens is indispensable.”23
In nineteen very brief articles, the Universal Declaration of Human Responsi-
bilities sets forth duties concerning non-violence and respect for life, justice
and solidarity, truthfulness and tolerance, and mutual respect and partnership. It

begins with the general principles that every person has a “responsibility to
treat all people in a humane way” and to “strive for the dignity and self-esteem
of all others.” All persons, groups and organizations, including states, armies
and police, are “subject to ethical standards.” It also includes the negative con-
verse of the Golden Rule: “What you do not wish to be done to yourself, do not
do to others.” The provisions of the Declaration may represent emerging glo-
bal consensus on the core responsibilities necessary to create more humane
societies.

With respect to non-violence, the Declaration includes the responsibilities
to respect life and to resolve disputes without violence, denies the right to
injure, torture, or kill (except in self-defense), and prohibits genocide, terror-
ism and the abuse of civilians as instruments of war. “The animals and the natu-
ral environment also demand protection. All people have a responsibility to
protect the air, water and soil of the earth…” As the dominant rights-oriented
approach in the U.S. legal system has forced even environmental issues into the
rights mold, leading to arguments about whether or not plants or animals or
natural resources have legal “standing” in order to claim a right to protection,
this alternative approach based on responsibilities might be considerably more
sensible and productive (if, in this case, tied to enforcement measures).

With respect to justice and solidarity, the Declaration states that, “Every
person has the responsibility to behave with integrity, honesty and fairness.” In
contrast to the rights approach of the United Nations Declaration on the Right to
Development, the InterAction document asserts that, “All people, given the
necessary tools, have a responsibility to make serious efforts to overcome
poverty, malnutrition, ignorance and inequality [and to] promote sustainable
development…” “All people have a responsibility to develop their talents
through diligent endeavor;… Everyone should lend support to the needy, the
disadvantaged, the disabled and to the victims of discrimination.”

Other articles in the Declaration include the responsibility of all men and
women “to show respect to one another and understanding in their partnership.
No one should subject another person to sexual exploitation or dependence.”
Representatives of religions “should not incite or legitimize hatred, fanaticism
and religious wars, but should foster tolerance and mutual respect between all
people.” Every person, “however high or mighty,” has a “responsibility to speak
and act truthfully.” “General ethical standards,” such as truthfulness and fairness,
apply to politicians, public servants, business leaders, scientists, writers, art-
ists, and others. This extends to the media as well. “Freedom of the media
carries a special responsibility for accurate and truthful reporting.”

One additional provision deserves comment, as it seems particularly for-
ward-looking. Article 11 states:

> All property and wealth must be used responsibly in accordance with justice and for the
> advancement of the human race. Economic and political power must not be handled as an
> instrument of domination, but in the service of economic justice and of the social order.

To even begin to put this provision into practice would require a profound
shift in perspective on the social function of wealth and on the rights and duties
associated with property ownership. Presently, the control of property is used
as a means of acquiring power over others and of gaining independence from
those who could do one harm. It is widely believed that wealth confers privi-
leges that the owner is free to use in an entirely self-serving manner. Accord-
ing to the Bahá’í principles on economics, possession of property or resources
carries responsibilities and imposes on the owner duties to others. This is
central to the Bahá’í vision of economic justice and is fundamental to the pro-
cess through which the extremes of wealth and poverty are to be eliminated. In
addition to governmental measures, voluntary action on the part of individuals
and enterprises is essential to the Bahá’í economic model.24

Similarly, Article 11 states that political power must not be used to
dominate but to serve justice and the social order. This also comports with
Bahá’í teachings. The Bahá’í administrative order is based on the attitude of
service. The possibility of individual political power has been structurally
eliminated, replaced with corporate decision-making by elected bodies. The
concept of leadership itself is changed, from control to empowerment.
“[L]eadership is that expression of service by which the Spiritual Assembly
invites and encourages the use of the manifold talents and abilities with which
the community is endowed, and stimulates and guides the diverse elements of
the community towards goals and strategies by which the effects of a coherent
force for progress can be realized.” 25

This proposed Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities is a
worthy attempt to promote thought and dialogue. Efforts like this, or the Earth
Charter with respect to environmental issues, work to create a global ethic by
articulating standards that can be agreed worldwide—not by seeking the low-
est common denominator but by encouraging all people to learn from each
other and to move forwards in the development of their own thought and tradi-
tions. The global moral dialogue continues. In the meantime, the worldwide
Bahá’í community is both contributing to this process and learning from it, while
devoting primary effort to bringing into being the spiritualized habits, rela-

tionships, and institutions that it believes are ultimately necessary to the matu-
rity and unity of humanity.

Conclusion—Some New Assumptions: Transcending Self to Find Self

Blending the ideals of East and West does not require abandoning most of
the assumptions underlying the Western human rights tradition or even indi-
vidualism itself, but it does require adding new dimensions. In addition to
assuming that members of society require physical security and moral autonomy,
the Bahá’í writings assume that we also require community, an environment of
mutual support and cooperation. The individual is a political and economic
actor but is more fundamentally a spiritual being, requiring relationships and
community to achieve full human potential. This requires that we operate on
the principle of unity in all of our affairs, in order to achieve unity through
justice. This sounds circular, but is quite rational. Unity in diversity is not only
the ultimate social goal in the Bahá’í writings; it is also the basic operating
principle, the means and method. As a recent letter of the U.S. National Spiri-
tual Assembly states, “Unity is the precondition of all progress. The expecta-
tion of unity, the perspective of unity, and unswerving compliance with the
requirements of unity are the disciplines that every member must master…”26
These new assumptions about human spiritual reality are what require a re-
alignment of our sense of self and community, of rights and responsibilities.

It is awkward or impossible to carry out this realignment piecemeal. The
necessary changes in attitude, environment, and institutions are tightly interre-
lated. For example, it is a blessing for an individual to act selflessly, putting
the concerns of others first, in a situation where this can build intimacy and
community. It is dangerous to be selfless in a situation where it would lead to
being abused or taken advantage of. Likewise, Bahá’ís are enjoined to trust
their institutions (Local and National Spiritual Assemblies and the Universal
House of Justice), not only because they are divinely ordained but because
they are organized to function in ways that render them deserving of trust. All
component parts of the system, at the individual, community, and institutional
levels, must function together for any of them to achieve their purpose.

An analysis of any part of the Bahá’í system must take into account other
components as well. To compare in isolation parallel aspects of entirely dis-
tinct systems is unproductive. For example, the issue addressed in the Rights
Statement of the Universal House of Justice—the form and manner of expres-
sion that is appropriate and necessary in Bahá’í community life—can only be
understood in the context of the Bahá’í governance and community system. Con-
trast the article on the media in the Universal Declaration of Human Responsi-

bilities with an excerpt from the Rights Statement. Article 14 of the Declaration
states:

> The freedom of the media to inform the public and to criticize institutions of society and
> governmental actions, which is essential for a just society, must be used with responsibility
> and discretion. Freedom of the media carries a special responsibility for accurate and
> truthful reporting…

The Universal House of Justice wrote in the Rights Statement:

> [T]he code of conduct of the press must embrace the principles and objectives of consul-
> tation as revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. Only in this way will the press be able to make its full
> contribution to the preservation of the rights of the people and become a powerful instru-
> ment in the consultative processes of society, and hence for the unity of the human race.27

Both of these passages prescribe ethical standards for the media. The first
emphasizes truthfulness, accuracy, responsibility and discretion, but is predi-
cated on the belief that it is necessary to a just society for the media to criticize
social institutions and governmental actions. The second prescribes for the
press the principles and objectives of Bahá’í consultation, which would not
include criticism of the kind assumed to be necessary in the first. These two
prescriptions, different as they are, are each consistent with their own frame of
reference. They diverge because they are based on different assumptions about
the overall purposes of their governing institutions and about how these insti-
tutions most effectively evolve and mature.

Progress in modern democratic systems is thought to depend on continuous
public comment and criticism of government and direct, often accusatory, chal-
lenge. Progress in the Bahá’í governance system depends on “consultative pro-
cesses.” Briefly, Bahá’í consultation is collective truth-seeking. It is a way to
make decisions, solve problems, and increase understanding, whether in a
meeting of a Spiritual Assembly, between wife and husband, within a Bahá’í
community, or in any other group. The spirit required for consultation is self-
lessness and detachment from one’s own ideas, as well as frankness, respect,
and courtesy. Other essential elements in the Bahá’í governance system include
a structured appeals process, from the local to national to international levels,
as well as appointed institutions whose members work closely with individu-
als and communities in a support and advisory role but without decision-mak-
ing authority. Frequent and regular opportunities for the members of a Bahá’í

community to consult with its Local Spiritual Assembly are intended to create
an intimacy, trust, and sense of co-partnership that have no parallel in other
models of governance. Other structures in the Bahá’í system serve a similar
purpose at the national level. In this system, cooperating with (rather than pub-
licly criticizing) an institutional decision that one believes to be in error is
what creates the encouraging (rather than confrontational) environment in which
mistakes can most readily be recognized, learned from, and corrected. It should
not be surprising that operating this way within the Bahá’í institutional system,
based on the expectation, perspective, and requirements of unity, could be
more productive than the methods we see around us, that create neither unity
nor sufficient change to meet urgent needs.

Thus, the first principles of the Bahá’í order regarding the spiritual nature
of human beings are complemented by an institutional system worthy of spiri-
tual beings, and conducive not only to individual growth but to collective spiri-
tual transformation. In order to evolve in this direction, the individualist must
look beyond herself, to see herself as part of a community that has a value
greater than the sum of its parts. It requires the communitarian to look within
himself, to see himself as an individual that has value as more than a constituent
element of a group. Which is easier? Is the American culture or the Japanese
culture better positioned to evolve toward the golden mean? As people of the
West fear conformity and oppression as destructive of what they value most,
people of the East fear excessive self-indulgence and social chaos as destruc-
tive of their most cherished values. But Bahá’u’lláh has called us all to change,
and this demands courage as well as detachment from cultural conditioning. The
most profound way to achieve independence of thought and spirit is to im-
merse oneself in the Bahá’í writings, the Creative Word of God for this age,
and thereby approach a divine knowledge that transcends human limitations.

Ultimately the next advance in human civilization would seem to depend,
most fundamentally, not on new structures or systems but on a change in how
people conceive of their own selves. In the Bahá’í writings, the word “self” is
used in two senses:

> [O]ne is self, the identity of the individual created by God. This is the self mentioned in
> such passages as “he hath known God who hath known himself,” etc. The other self is the
> ego, the dark, animalistic heritage each one of us has, the lower nature that can develop
> into a monster of selfishness, brutality, lust and so on. It is this self we must struggle against,
> or this side of our natures, in order to strengthen and free the spirit within us and help it to
> attain perfection.

> Self-sacrifice means to subordinate this lower nature and its desires to the more godly and
> noble side of our selves. Ultimately, in its highest sense, self-sacrifice means to give our
> will and our all to God to do with as He pleases. Then He purifies and glorifies our true self
> until it becomes a shining and wonderful reality.28

The Western human rights tradition has established and vigilantly sought to
protect our right to choose what we do with our God-given talents and capaci-
ties. Beyond that it cannot take us, as the modern democratic state is intended to
allow for as wide a range of moral choices in a pluralistic society as possible.
It seems, unfortunately, that in becoming preoccupied with protecting our right
to choose we may forget to think about our greater purpose in making choices.
For a Bahá’í, “an individual finds fulfillment of his potential not merely in
satisfying his own wants but in realizing his completeness in being at one with
humanity and with the divinely ordained purpose of creation.”29

> [T]he honor and distinction of the individual consist in this, that he among all the world’s
> multitudes should become a source of social good. Is there any larger bounty conceivable
> than this, that an individual, looking within himself, should find that by the confirming grace
> of God he has become the cause of peace and well-being, of happiness and advantage to
> his fellowmen? No, by the one true God, there is no greater bliss, no more complete
> delight.30

World religions have invariably called believers to transcend self, to dis-
cover a spiritual perfection that is both beyond themselves and within them-
selves, and to put others before themselves. Selflessness has always been
identified as spiritual freedom. In the Bahá’í era, this freedom now finds not
only individual but community and institutional expression as well, in an order
conducive to close relationships and loving communities. Shoghi Effendi wrote
that the Bahá’í community is “one spiritual family, held together by bonds more
sacred and eternal than those physical ties which make people of the same
family.”31 The institutional order has been ordained solely to facilitate commu-
nity building, in the broadest sense and on a global scale. “World order is
nothing else than the administrative aspect of brotherhood.”32

Bahá’ís are among the staunchest supporters of human rights, because we
know their spiritual value. Human rights are necessary in order to allow free
reign to our higher selves. But we also know that our purpose lies beyond
gratification of the individual will, and that our happiness depends on what we
do in relationship with others.

> God has given us eyes, that we may look about us at the world, and lay hold of whatsoever
> will further civilization and the arts of living. He has given us ears, that we may hear and
> profit by the wisdom of scholars and philosophers and arise to promote and practice it.
> Senses and faculties have been bestowed upon us, to be devoted to the service of the
