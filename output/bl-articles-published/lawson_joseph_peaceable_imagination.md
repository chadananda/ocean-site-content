The Baha’i Tradition
The Return of Joseph and the Peaceable Imagination

Todd Lawson

> In the Baha’i tradition, nonviolence is not a principle derived primarily through
> exegesis but one given through revelation, to use the Baha’i technical term for its
> primary scripture. There can be no dispute or discussion on this point by either a
> follower of the Baha’i faith or those who study and understand this relatively recent
> religion. What may be a source of discussion is the question of how in the context
> of the history of religion and religions and especially the history of the Baha’i faith
> this came to be. Here I will ﬁrst offer a brief discussion of the role and status of
> violence in the Baha’i tradition, based on a comparatively limited selection of the
> most inﬂuential and characteristic statements from the vast library of Baha’i writ-
> ings. The chapter will then examine some possible religious, historical, and social
conditions in which these doctrines were articulated.

Baha’i teachings are unambiguous: the purpose of religion is the promotion of
> harmony and unity among human beings.1 The founder of the Baha’i faith, Mirza
> Husayn ‘Ali Nuri (1817–92), who is most widely known as Baha’u’llah (the glory
> of God), has written that if religion becomes the cause of disharmony then it is
> better that there be no religion at all.2 Baha’i teachings condemn violence as
> something to be avoided at all costs. The Baha’i tradition is perhaps too young to
> have generated much in the way of exegesis as normally understood. However,
> exegesis is relevant in the sense that Baha’i writings may be thought of, in some
> ways, as an interpretation of Islamic scripture. (Here scripture would include both
> the Qur’an and the Hadith corpus.) Baha’u’llah was of course a son of Shi’i Islamic
> culture. A careful reading of the authoritative literature of the Baha’i faith leaves
little doubt that its adherents are proud to acknowledge their tradition’s Shi’i roots.3

The “grammar and syntax” of the piety and religious practice of both traditions

> have much in common. However, with regard to speciﬁc points of doctrine there
> are dramatic and unbridgeable differences. In some instances, these differences
> have been made clear through a distinctive literary “event” I have elsewhere called
> “interpretation as revelation.”4 It is clear that one of the two most important works
> of Baha’u’llah, the Kitāb-i Iqān, is primarily a work of exegesis.5 It was written to
> explain how the messianic claims of Sayyid ‘Ali Muhammad Shirazi (1819–50),
> better known as the Bāb (Arabic for “gate” or “door”),6 may be understood in the
> light of certain qur’anic verses and Hadith or Akhbār, holy traditions or statements
> traced to the Prophet or, in this case, one of the other thirteen pure ones (Persian:
> chehardeh ma’sūmāt),7 namely the Prophet’s daughter Fatima, his son-in-law ‘Ali
> ibn Abi Talib, and the remaining eleven Imams acknowledged by Ithna ‘ashariyya
> or Twelver Shi’ism.8 Composed around 1862, the book is relatively early in the
> corpus of Baha’u’llah’s writings.9 In this early major work the problem of violence
> is mentioned chieﬂy with regard to the violent response of humankind to all the
> prophets and messengers of God, including the Bab. In several passages, the author
> suggests that all previous prophets were considered by their immediate audiences,
> or at least a segment of them and sometimes overwhelming majority, to be sedi-
> tious or heretical. Such concerns are particularly poignant in the case of Shi’ism
> and its expectation of the last day, the Day of Resurrection, yawm al-qiyāma.
> Traditionally, this “Day” is viewed as the time when the heretofore hidden Imam
> would appear with his faithful companions to “ﬁll the earth with justice as it is
> now ﬁlled with tyranny.”10 The hero of this event, the returned twelfth Imam, is
> known by numerous epithets, among which the most common and perhaps most
> emblematic of a certain robust theme of Shi’i eschatology is “the one who arises
with the sword,” al-qā’im bi al-sayf.11

Baha’u’llah argues in the Book of Certitude that this divinely guided hero had
> indeed arisen and that his message had indeed been proclaimed. But the vast
> majority of those who have been in the peculiarly Shi’i sacramental state of mes-
> sianic expectation and hope (namely intizār) these eleven or so centuries (that is,
> the Shi’a themselves) had failed to recognize him because they misinterpreted all
> of those traditions and qur’anic verses they had traditionally studied, memorized,
> and commented on in the hope of preparing themselves for his glad advent
> (zuhūr).12 Thus, the same violent response to all previous divinely sanctioned
> prophets and messengers had also greeted the Bab, culminating in his execution,
in 1850, in Tabriz. Baha’u’llah writes:

> Why is it that the advent of every true manifestation of God [mazhar-i ilāhī] has
> been accompanied by such strife and tumult, by such tyranny and upheaval? This
> notwithstanding the fact that all the prophets of God, whenever made manifest unto
> the people of the world, have invariably foretold the coming of yet another prophet
> after them, and have established such signs as would herald the advent of the future
> dispensation. To this the records of all sacred books bear witness. Why then is it

> that despite the expectation of men in their quest of the manifestations of holiness,
> and in spite of the signs recorded in the sacred books, such acts of violence, of op-
> pression and cruelty, should have been perpetrated in every age and cycle against
> all the prophets and chosen ones of God? Even as He has revealed: “As oft as an
> Apostle cometh unto you with that which your souls desire not, you swell with pride,
> accusing some of being impostors and slaying others. (Qur’an 2:87).” (Book of Cer-
> titude, 12–13/10)13

An arguable subtext is that such persecution is indeed the most compelling
> credential for the claims of such prophets. Though this is not an exclusively Shi’i
> attitude (the Qur’an itself is replete with examples of the persecuted chosen one),14
> it is an orientation or theme taken to its most developed extent in Twelver Shi’ism.
> With regard to the speciﬁc expectation that the Qā’im would arise with an actual
> sword and defeat all of the enemies of God in an apocalyptic battle, the Book of
> Certitude suggests that such a sword is best understood as a metonymic allusion
> to the sovereignty (saltānat) of the Qā’im, a sovereignty with which all divine
> messengers have been endowed and which “is inherently exercised by the Qā’im
> whether or not He appear in the world clothed in the majesty of earthly dominion”
> (Book of Certitude, 107/80). Such sovereignty, also known to the wider Shi’i tradi-
> tion by the cognate and near synonym walāya (Persian: valāyat/vilāyat), is ex-
> pressed (namely wielded), according to Baha’u’llah in this same work, through
> the revelation or words of the one divinely chosen. This divine word has the power
> to both separate—like a sword—and unite, as a word unites otherwise disparate
> and perhaps even otherwise uncongenial sounds and letters into a unit of meaning.
> In the following quotation, Baha’u’llah expands on this distinctive feature of Baha’i
> hermeneutics. Note also the reference in this passage to reunion and uniﬁcation,
> fragrance and garment (qamīs), at the end of this passage. These “josephian”
> metaphors play a key role in signaling the “return of Joseph” and will be discussed
> further in the second part this chapter.

> The following is an evidence of the sovereignty exercised by Muhammad, the Day-
> star of Truth. Have you not heard how with one single verse He sundered light from
> darkness, the righteous from the ungodly, and the believing from the inﬁdel? All
> the signs and allusions concerning the Day of Judgment, which you have heard, such
> as the raising of the dead, the Day of Reckoning, the Last Judgment, and others,
> have been made manifest through the revelation of that verse. These revealed words
> were a blessing to the righteous who on hearing them exclaimed: “O God our Lord,
> we have heard, and obeyed.” They were a curse to the people of iniquity who, on
> hearing them afﬁrmed: “We have heard and rebelled.” Those words, sharp as the
> sword of God, have separated the faithful from the inﬁdel, and severed father from
> son. You have surely seen how they that have confessed their faith in him and they
> that rejected him have warred against each other, and sought one another’s property.

How many fathers have turned away from their sons; how many lovers have shunned

> their beloved! So mercilessly trenchant was this wondrous sword [in sayf-i badā’] of
> God that it cleft asunder every relationship! On the other hand, consider the welding
> power of His Word. Observe, how those in whose midst the Satan of self had for
> years sown the seeds of malice and hate became so fused and blended through their
> allegiance to this wondrous and transcendent Revelation [in amr badī’ manī’] that
> it seemed as if they had sprung from the same loins.15 Such is the binding force of
> the Word of God, which unites the hearts of them that have renounced all else but
> Him, who have believed in His signs, and quaffed from the Hand of glory the
> Kawthar of God’s holy grace.16 Furthermore, how numerous are those peoples of
> divers beliefs, of conﬂicting creeds, and opposing temperaments, who, through the
> reviving fragrance of the Divine springtime, blowing from the Ridván of God, have
> been arrayed with the new robe [qamīs-i jadīd] of divine Unity, and have drunk
> from the cup of His singleness!17 (Book of Certitude, 111–112/84–85, italics added)

> Thus, the Awaited Imam (al-imām al-muntazar), the Master of the Age (sāhib
> al-zamān), the One who arises by Divine right (al-qā’im bi ‘l-haqq), had been
> murdered through an act of violence by the very people who should have welcomed
> him with open hearts. The condemnation of such violent opposition to God’s
> messengers may be thought a major theme of this book. Its source, Baha’u’llah
> says here, is selﬁshness, jealousy, egotism, and vested interest. Though never stated
> explicitly, the conclusion is certainly difﬁcult to avoid coming to that the author
> thought it was also caused by an appalling, painful, and pathological lack of
> imagination. The exegeses performed in the Iqān offer imaginative and poetic
> ways of understanding various predictions about the return (raj’a) of the hidden
> or twelfth Imam, interpretations that are largely symbolic and metaphorical. As
> the answer to those who argue, for example, that the Imam (here associated with
> the Son of Man’s return in clouds of heaven in Matthew 24:29–31) is expected to
> return “in the clouds” and have wrongly imagined them to be clouds of the meteo-
> rological variety, Baha’u’llah explains that in reality the word cloud must be un-
derstood quite differently:

> And now regarding His words, that the Son of man shall “come in the clouds of
> heaven.” By the term “clouds” is meant those things that are contrary to the ways
> and desires of men. Even as God has revealed in the verse already quoted: “As oft as
> an Apostle cometh unto you with that which your souls desire not, ye swell with
> pride, accusing some of being impostors and slaying others. [Qur’an 2:8])” These
> “clouds” signify, in one sense, the annulment of laws, the abrogation of former
> dispensations, the repeal of rituals and customs current amongst men, the exalting
> of the illiterate faithful above the learned opposers of the faith. In another sense,
> they mean the appearance of that immortal Beauty in the image of mortal man,
> with such human limitations as eating and drinking, poverty and riches, glory and
> abasement, sleeping and waking, and such other things as cast doubt in the minds
> of men, and cause them to turn away. All such veils are symbolically referred to as
> “clouds.” (Book of Certitude, 71–72/55)

Viewing such exegetical virtuosity in the context of the subsequent, fully ar-
> ticulated Baha’i ethos, it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that, according to that
> ethos, violence may indeed be thought to stem from a general poverty of imagina-
> tion.18 The Baha’i faith and teachings would eventually develop a new rhetoric, or
> what has been referred to as a distinctive “expressive style”:19 distinctive, that is,
> with regard to the major concerns and guiding ethos of its parent religion, Twelver
> Shi’ism. Baha’u’llah wrote the above words not in Iran but in Baghdad, where he
> had been exiled as a result of a general government crackdown on the Babis. It has
> been suggested that Baghdad, as a much more cosmopolitan milieu than the com­
> paratively xenophobic Tehran, provided an apt and congenial setting for the ﬁrst
formulation of Baha’i universalism (as distinct from Babi parochialism).20

Baha’u’llah himself and his growing entourage came to be known and in fact to
> identify themselves as Babis until around 1868 when the adjective “Baha’i” started
> to be used more categorically. Even now though, the implication, at least to the
> uninitiated, is that we are speaking of Baha’i “Babism” as distinct from Azali
> “Babism.”21 Explanations of the transition from Babi to Baha’i identities and ori-
> entations are spoken of in terms of “progressive revelation,” a cardinal and distinc-
> tive Baha’i teaching that explains both history and religion in one gesture by as-
> serting that all prophets have been sent by the same God from time to time in
> order to promote and carry forward an “ever-advancing civilization.”22 Thus “civi-
> lization” as such is a distinct and explicit religious value in the Baha’i teachings.
> And, it may be thought to represent a particular “exegesis” of basic qur’anic pro­
> nouncements on the “sacramental value” of community (umma), social justice,
> and a searching contemplation of the cosmos, the self, and the holy books. Such
> Islamic beliefs are, in the Baha’i faith, universalized beyond their formative Arabo-
> islamicate matrix, and beyond their evolution or development in the more far-ﬂung
realms of later islamicate civilization.23

Civilization, accordingly, in order to be true to itself must be peaceful. Thus,
> violence is completely outlawed in the Baha’i faith and the idea and law of “reli-
> giously sanctioned warfare” (cf. jihād) is, in conversation with and distinct from
> the Islamic tradition, completely, irrevocably, and unambiguously abrogated.24
> The time line of this abolition is also not open to dispute. It was ﬁrst unambigu-
> ously and publicly identiﬁed with the religion of Baha’u’llah in 1863 in Baghdad,
> even though it appears to have been part of the noetic substance of a revelatory ex­
> perience a year or so earlier.25 While the spirit of this abolition is certainly promi-
> nent in Baha’u’llah’s Most Holy Book, composed in Ottoman Palestine, in 1873, it is
> in a later composition that religiously sanctioned warfare is again speciﬁcally out­
lawed in no uncertain terms.26

In a brief work composed toward the end of his life, known as the Tablet of
> Glad-Tidings (Lawh al-bishārat), Baha’u’llah listed the major principles of his new
> religion.27 The ﬁfteen distinct laws or verities may be thought a precursor to the

> later, perhaps more widely circulated, “Twelve Principles of the Baha’i Faith.”28 At
this earlier stage, they are, in this order:

(1)   the abolition of religiously mandated warfare;
> (2)    lifting the ban on associating with followers of other religions;
> (3)    the promotion of a universal language;
(4)    the obligation to support any “king” who arises to protect the beleaguered

new religion;
(5a)    enjoining obedience to the laws of the country in which any of his follow-

ers reside;
(5b)    enjoining the inhabitants of the world to aid his persecuted followers so

> that the “light of unity and concord may shine forth and shed its radiance
> upon the world”;
(5c)    the hope that all weapons of war be converted “into instruments of recon-

> struction and that strife and conﬂict may be removed from the midst of
> men”;
> (6)    the principle of the Lesser Peace;29
(7)    people are permitted to wear whatever clothing they wish and to cut their

> hair anyway they wish as long as they do not allow themselves to become
> “playthings of the ignorant”;
(8)   the abolition of celibacy and monasticism of all kinds so that “monks and

> priests” may live in the world and enter into wedlock to “bring forth one
> who will make mention of God”;
(9)    one must seek forgiveness from God alone; confession to fellow creatures

is prohibited (when followed by a prayer for forgiveness);
> (10)    the prohibition of the destruction of books;
> (11)    permission to study arts and sciences that are beneﬁcial;
(12)    the obligation to acquire a trade or profession—work and trade are re-

garded as a form of worship.

> The ﬁrst principle or “good news” is expressed as follows:
> O People of the World! The ﬁrst Glad-Tidings [bishāra] which the Mother Book has,
> in this Most Great Revelation, imparted unto all the peoples of the world is that the
> law of jihād has been blotted out from the Book [ya ahl-i ard bishārat-i avval kih az
> umm al-kitāb dar īn zuhūr-i a’zam bi-jāmi’-i ahl-i ‘alam ‘ināyat shud mahv-i hukm-i
> jihād ast az kitāb]. Gloriﬁed be the All-Merciful, the Lord of grace abounding,
> through Whom the door of heavenly bounty has been ﬂung open in the face of all
> that are in heaven and on earth.30

> The explicit mention here of the familiar, frequently vexing, originally qur’anic
> term jihād indicates that there is no ambiguity about this law. Jihād is neither
> explained nor interpreted; it is simply abolished. This bold proclamation should

> to distinguish his religion from traditional Islam. It may be, as is certainly the case
> with the tenth principle (against the destruction of books), that the ﬁrst audience
> here was the Babis themselves, there having been serious and prolonged disagree-
> ment, since the execution of the Bab, about precisely such matters as religiously
> mandated violence and other distinctively and traditionally unexceptionable
> topics found mentioned in the writings of the Bab.31 But it is also obvious from
> the text that these “glad tidings” are addressed to humanity in general. Further-
> more, according to recent scholarship, the tablet itself was ﬁrst sent speciﬁcally to
> the leaders of thought and state in Britain and Russia, probably as the result of a
> contemporary event that called into question the Baha’i attitude toward violence.32
> By this time, Baha’u’llah had successfully created a peaceable, law-abiding com-
> munity out of the rather roiling welter of Babi disarray, in which there had been,
> for example, obvious and dramatic controversy over the role and status (if any) of
> jihād in what we saw referred to above in the quotation from the Book of Certitude

> The Baha’i era is held to have begun on the evening of May 22, 1844/1260 (that is,
> at onset of the Twelver Millennium) in Shiraz. This is when the young merchant,
> Sayyid ‘Ali Muhammad (known to history as the Bab), began the composition of
> a highly unique commentary, itself cast in the form of the Qur’an complete with
> separate suras (with titles), āyas, the number and place of revelation indicated,
> and, in the oldest manuscripts, marginal indications where prostration should
> occur. The medium was the message: a new revelation had happened.34 This un-
> usual Qur’an commentary (tafsīr), presented as a “new” Qur’an—or more accu-
> rately the “original” uncorrupted Qur’an, which until now had been in the keeping
> of the hidden Imam—was restricted to one qur’anic chapter, the sura of Joseph.35
> Later Baha’i readers see this as an allusion to and prophecy of Baha’u’llah’s advent
(zuhūr), a return of the True Joseph.36

Without delving into great detail, I would like simply now to emphasize that,
> of all the qur’anic prophets and messengers, Joseph is distinguished by his moral
> and physical beauty, a major component of which is his willingness to forgive his
> faithless brothers their evil betrayal. In an act of world-changing tolerance, wis-
> dom, and forbearance, he summons the hitherto scattered forces of his holy
> lineage to become the salvation and preservation of Israel and, from the point of
> view of Islam, the prophecy—or, perhaps better stated, God’s very connection with
> the world. In Arabic, such tolerance, wisdom, and forbearance are combined in the
> word hilm. Hilm is a frequent word in the Qur’an, where it appears in the divine

1\.Renard, Fighting Words.indd 141                                                                       7/13/12 2:14 PM

> attribute al-halīm, indicating God as the par excellence model and source of long-
> suffering, patience, control of anger, tolerance, slowness to punish, gentleness, and
> wisdom.37 Its meaning and moral scope is exempliﬁed in numerous instances in
> pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, the stories of the Prophets, and in the overall literary
and poetic heritage of islamicate culture.

In line with the qur’anic logic of prophecy, all prophets are endowed with this
> and every other noble moral virtue, but some are more exemplary of this or that
> virtue than others.38 Of the many examples of this virtue that have been celebrated
> and admired in Islam, whether Sunni, Shi’i, or Suﬁ of whatever speciﬁc iteration,
> or even at the “nonaligned” level of the folktale, none is more characteristic, com-
> pelling, or universally admired than the way in which the prophet Joseph, son of
> Jacob, exempliﬁed this all-important religious virtue in his dealings with those
> who betrayed him. According to the qur’anic telling of his life in the sura of Joseph,
> his betrayers are his brothers, the wife of the powerful Egyptian into whose house-
> hold he had been sold as a slave, her husband the powerful Egyptian himself, and
> the fellow prisoner who broke his jailhouse promise.39 Certainly many other
> prophets (and indeed other heroic or powerful ﬁgures in Islam or Islamic history,
> including the controversial Mu’awiya) exemplify this distinctively Islamic virtue.40
> But Joseph is arguably the prime example. Without raising the problematic ques-
> tion of causality, I suggest that the Baha’i elimination of violence, vengeance, re-
> ligiously mandated violence, and indeed hatred is a reﬂection of the image of Jo-
> seph and its centrality in its own particular ethos and history. This unites the
> various streams of inﬂuence and discourse ﬂowing from the Qur’an, its exegesis,
> and its contemplation within both Sunni and more particularly Shi’i contexts. It
> also unites the whole range of islamicate moralia and pedagogy (adab/akhlāq),
> poetry (mystical and profane), speciﬁc tonalities of Twelver Shi’i piety, and escha-
> tology that, by the time of the genesis and rise of the Baha’i faith, had become
seamlessly joined to the greater mystical and spiritual tradition of Islam.

The word bishāra, “glad tiding,” from the title of the tablet summarized above,
> is not qur’anic. But the basic root idea is frequent in the form of bashīr, “bearer of
> good tidings.”41 As such, it often occurs with a companion term, warner (nadhīr),
> as one half of the prophetic ofﬁce, as it were. Muhammad is described as such in
> Q 2:119, 5:19, 7:188, 11:2, 34:28, 35:24, 41:4.42 The remaining instance of bashīr occurs
> in the famous scene in the sura of Joseph (12:96) when after long years languish­
> ing in painful and blinding separation from his beloved son, Jacob miraculously
> detects—and at great distance—the presence of Joseph from the scent of his fa-
> mous, spiritually charged shirt (qamīs). The joy of such a perception is indescrib-
> able, and this is probably why the Qur’an presents it in such a striking scene. If it
> were a ﬁlm, it would function as a dramatic cutaway. Joseph’s brothers are crossing
> “the border” separating Egypt and Canaan. The scene shifts instantly to the aged
> Jacob, languishing a great distance from this border (presumably in the family

> pasturage in north Canaan) and sensitized through his deep abiding and prophetic
> love, who immediately senses through the extraordinary shirt (qamīs) which the
> brothers are bringing to him that his beloved and heretofore bitterly lamented son
Joseph lives:

> And as soon as the caravan [with which Jacob’s sons were traveling] was on its way
> [ falamma fasalat al-’ir], their father said [to the people around him]: “Behold, were
> it not that you might consider me a dotard, [I would say that] I truly feel the breath
> of Joseph [in the air]!” (Q 12:94)

In the previous verse, the previously hidden and now manifest Joseph had
> instructed his brothers to take this shirt back to their home and to lay it on the
eyes of their blinded-by-grief father so that his sight would be renewed:

> “Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father: he will come to see
> (clearly). Then return (here) to me together with all your family.” (Q 12:93)

> The Qur’an continues:
> Then, when the bearer of good news [bashīr] came and placed the shirt on to Jacob’s
> face, his eyesight returned and he said, “Did I not tell you that I have knowledge
> from God that you do not have.” (Q 12:96)

It is of some interest to note that another form of the same root B-SH-R occurs
> early in the this story at Q 12:19, precisely when Joseph is discovered in the well by
> the traveling caravan that would then purchase him from his perﬁdious brothers
and remove him to Egypt, thus beginning the crushing separation from Jacob:

> Some travelers came by. They sent someone to draw water and he let down his bucket.
> “Good news [bushrā]!” he exclaimed. “Here is a boy!” They hid him like a piece of
> merchandise—God was well aware of what they did.43

The prophetic career of Joseph had long been of special interest and importance
> to the Ithna ‘ashari Shi’a for a number of reasons. In the Shi’i understanding of the
> qur’anic account, Joseph is distinguished as an embodiment of the mystery and con­
> ﬂuence of divine selection, occultation, and pious dissimulation (walāya, ghayba,
> and taqiyya), three very important Shi’i religious “sacramental” categories. In ad-
> dition, the entire story may be characterized as “an apocalypse of reunion,”44 em-
> blematic of the important and distinctive Shi’i doctrine of “return” (raj’a) in which
> this eschaton is typologically preﬁgured in the qur’anic reuniting of Joseph with his
> family.45 There are several other interesting features of the twelfth sura that were
> taken to the bosom of Shi’ism; but it may be the ﬁgure of Joseph as a peacemaker—
> benevolent, patient, chaste, pious, and wise—that captured the imagination of the
> founders of the Baha’i tradition.46 Joseph orders no war. On the contrary, he for-
> gives those who betrayed him. In this particular context, it is difﬁcult to avoid the

> thought that it is through the powerful example of Joseph that the Shi’i community
> may be able to ﬁnd the strength and courage to forgive the Sunni community (and,
> of course, vice versa). Such “iron in the soul” appears to be something highly
important to the Baha’i tradition.47

Joseph also qualiﬁes as an example and type of the Verus Propheta, or ruling
> prophet (on the ancient model of Melchizedek), in which both spiritual and
> worldly/political authority are clearly vested and perfectly combined, as in the
> Shi’i ideal of the Imam.48 The continuation of such veneration in the Baha’i faith
> may be thought a logical development from both the Shi’i and the Suﬁ traditions,
> a veneration that begins in earnest with the Bab’s remarkable tafsīr on Q 12 and
> continues through the many allusions and references to the Joseph story scattered
> throughout the writings of Baha’u’llah.49 For example, in the Most Holy Book
> (Kitāb Aqdas), written in 1873 by Baha’u’llah, after he had been further exiled from
> Iran through Baghdad to Istanbul, Edirne, and ﬁnally ‘Akka in what was then
> Ottoman Palestine, we ﬁnd the following characteristic reference to the story of
> Joseph in which the “josephian” metaphors of beauty, scent, garment, blindness,
> heartbreak healed, and family reunited are clearly combined with the idea of divine
> messenger and “administrative or legislative wisdom.” Note also the qur’anic dic-
tion of this passage, beginning with the characteristic imperative “Say” (qul):

> Say: From My laws the sweet-smelling savor of My garment [qamīsī] can be smelled,
> and by their aid the standards of Victory will be planted upon the highest peaks.
> The Tongue of My power has, from the heaven of My omnipotent glory, addressed
> to My creation these words: “Observe My commandments, for the love of My beauty
> [hubban li-jamālī].” Happy is the lover that has inhaled the divine fragrance of his
> Best-Beloved from these words, laden with the perfume of a grace which no tongue
> can describe. By My life! He who has drunk the choice wine of fairness from the
> hands of My bountiful favor will circle around My commandments that shine above
the Dayspring of My creation.

Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. On the contrary,
> We have unsealed the choice Wine [al-rahiq al-makhtūm] with the ﬁngers of might
> and power. To this bears witness that which the Pen of Revelation has revealed.

Meditate upon this, O men of insight! (Most Holy Book, para. 4, 20–21/3–4)

> deﬁnes this “warrior” in a lengthy passage now known in the Baha’i community
> as the “Tablet of the True Seeker.” What follows is a brief examination and explica-
> tion of a few key passages containing the theme of “combat” and those josephian
metaphors indicated above. The tablet (lawh) opens as follows:

> But, O my brother, when a true seeker (mujāhid) determines to take the step of search
> in the path leading to the knowledge of the Ancient of Days, he must, before all else,
> cleanse and purify his heart, which is the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries
> of God, from the obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge, and the allusions of the
> embodiments of satanic fancy. (Book of Certitude, 192/148–49)50

Although a thorough analysis of the entire tablet is not possible here, sufﬁce it
> to mention that neither here nor anywhere in the rest of the Book of Certitude (or
> anywhere else in the Baha’i writings) is there any suggestion that those engaged
> in the pursuit of truth and the quest for divine nearness in this the Day of Resur-
> rection (yawm al-qiyāma: the fulﬁllment of the Shi’i eschaton) are expected to
> bear actual arms and engage in anything resembling armed or military activity.
> On the contrary, the remainder of the “Tablet of the True Seeker” is concerned
> with inculcating spiritual, moral, and ethical standards reminiscent of the preach-
> ing of the earliest Suﬁ masters such as Muhasibi (d. 857), Junayd (d. 910), Hallaj
> (d. 922), and al-Makki (d. 996), which is consolidated in the work of Ghazali (d. 1111).
> The tablet also echoes themes and insights developed in the later Islamic spiritual
> and mystical traditions by such luminaries as Ibn ‘Arabi (d. 1240), Rūmi (d. 1273),
> and Shabistari (d. 1340), to name only three of the numerous religious virtuosi
> whose own mystical and spiritual struggle, including literary composition, con-
> tributed to the culture from which the Baha’i faith emerged, a culture whose study
> is necessary for a proper understanding of Baha’i teachings.51 In the “Tablet of the
> True Seeker,” any explicit Shi’i references are conﬁned—in addition to the quoting
> of speciﬁcally Shi’i Hadith mentioned earlier—to the general if not generic sense of
> expectation and fulﬁllment, a sense not out of place within Sunni Islam after all.52
> As the passages excerpted here show, the central, pervasive metaphors of scent,
> messenger, separation and distance, and knowledge and reunion represent a ty-
> pological reiteration of the story of Joseph in the Qur’an. Here is a Joseph who,
> through the exempliﬁcation of forbearance, tolerance, and long-suffering, trans-
> forms the earlier betrayal of his brothers into a spiritual event that, devoid of vio-
> lence and bitterness, serves to cause the reunion and healing of the fractured
family, a family which in Baha’i thought is emblematic of humanity.

In the excerpts below, the reader experienced with Islamic mystical works will
> see much that is familiar. Yet the combination of the idea of “holy struggle” (jihād)
> with the josephian imagery and metaphors of beauty, lover and beloved (Jacob
> and Joseph, Zulaykha and Joseph), attainment of spiritual knowledge, scent and
> perfume as an emblem of or metaphor for spiritual knowledge, and the related

> elements of the qur’anic narrative seems to set the tone of the Baha’i ethos in an
original and creative way. The tablet continues:

> He must purge his breast, which is the sanctuary of the abiding love of the Beloved,
> of every deﬁlement, and sanctify his soul from all that pertains to water and clay,
> from all shadowy and ephemeral attachments. He must so cleanse his heart that no
> remnant of either love or hate may linger therein, lest that love blindly incline him
> to error, or that hate repel him away from the truth. Even as you see in this Day how
> most of the people, because of such love and hate, are bereft of the immortal Face,
> have strayed far from the embodiments of the divine mysteries, and, shepherdless,
> are roaming through the wilderness of oblivion and error. That seeker must, at all
> times, put his trust in God, must renounce the peoples of the earth, must detach
> himself from the world of dust, and cleave unto Him Who is the Lord of Lords. He
> must never seek to exalt himself above any one, must wash away from the tablet of
> his heart every trace of pride and vain-glory, must cling unto patience and resigna-
> tion, observe silence and refrain from idle talk. For the tongue is a smoldering ﬁre,
> and excess of speech a deadly poison. Material ﬁre consumes the body, whereas the
> ﬁre of the tongue devours both heart and soul. The force of the former lasts but for
> a time, while the effects of the latter endures a century.

The next passage offers again explicit reference to a jihād restricted to the spiri-
tual or existential realm:

> These are among the attributes of the exalted [‘ālin], and constitute the hall-mark of
> the spiritually-minded [rūhāniyīn]. They have already been mentioned in connection
> with the requirements of the wayfarers [sharā’it-i mujāhidīn wa mashy-i sālikīn] that
> tread the path of the pursuit of the knowledge of certitude [dar manāhij-i ‘ilm al-
> yaqīn]. When the detached wayfarer [sālik-i farīgh] and sincere seeker [tālib-i sādiq]
> has fulﬁlled these essential conditions [ba’d az tahaqquq īn maqamāt], then and only
> then can he be called a true seeker [laf’ mujāhid dar barih-yi ‘ū sādiq mi’ayad].
> Whenever he has fulﬁlled the conditions implied in the verse: “Those who make
> efforts for Us [al-ladhīna jāhadū fīna],” (Qur’an 29:69) he shall enjoy the blessings
> conferred by the words: “In Our Ways shall We assuredly guide him.” (Q 29:69)

In the following paragraph we see a return to those traditional moral, ethical
> virtues and themes associated with Suﬁsm. This is a prelude to the dramatic refer-
> ence to precisely the “messenger of joy” (bashīr), translated here as “Mystic Herald,”
> who brings the glad tidings of the “return” of Joseph (something of an apocalyptic
> reversal, since it is in reality the family, led by Jacob, who “returns” to him). That the
> adjective apocalyptic is appropriate is borne out by mention of, among other allu-
> sions, the qur’anic image of the Trumpet Blast, immediately followed by reference
to the new creation or new life that results from this spiritual event/experience:

> Only when the lamp of search [sirāj-i talab], of earnest striving [mujāhada], of long-
> ing desire, of passionate devotion, of fervid love, of rapture, and ecstasy [dhawq,

> rawshan shud], and the breeze of His loving-kindness is wafted upon his soul, will
> the darkness of error be dispelled, the mists of doubts and misgivings be dissipated,
> and the lights of knowledge and certitude envelop his being. At that hour will the
> Mystic Herald, bearing the joyful tidings of the Spirit, shine forth from the City
> of God resplendent as the morn [dar ān hin bashīr-i ma’navī bi-bishārat-i rūhānī
> az madīnah-yi ilāhī chun subh-i sādiq tali’ shavad], and, through the trumpet-blast
> of knowledge, will awaken the heart, the soul, and the spirit from the slumber of
> heedlessness [wa qalb wa nafs wa rūh ra bi-sūr ma’rifat az nawm-i ghaﬂat bīdar
> namayad]. Then will the manifold favors and outpouring grace of the holy and
> everlasting Spirit [rūh al-quds-i samadānī] confer such new life [hāyat-i tazah-yi
> jadīd] upon the seeker that he will ﬁnd himself endowed with a new eye [chishm-i
> jadīd], a new ear [gūsh-i badī’], a new heart, and a new mind [qalb wa fu’ād-i tazah].
> He will contemplate the manifest signs of the universe, and will penetrate the hidden
> mysteries of the soul. Gazing with the eye of God, he will perceive within every atom
> a door that leads him to the stations of absolute certitude. He will discover in all
> things the mysteries of divine revelation, and the evidences of an everlasting
> manifestation.

Joseph and his story are present again in the following direct continuation of
> the preceding excerpt, especially in speaking of detecting the “fragrance of God”
> from a great distance and also in the reference to perfume, breath, and fragrance
in other contexts:

> I swear by God! Were he that treads the path of guidance [sālik-i sabīl-i hudā] and
> seeks to scale the heights of righteousness [tālib-i ma’ārij-i taqi] to attain unto this
> glorious and exalted station [bih īn maqām-i buland-i a’lā wāsil gardad], he would
> inhale, at a distance of a thousand leagues, the fragrance of God [rā’ihāh-yi haqq rā
> az farasangha-yi ba’idih istinshāq namāyad], and would perceive the resplendent
> morn of a divine guidance rising above the day spring of all things [wa subh-i
> nūrānī-yi hidāyat rā az mashriq-i kull-i shay’ idrāk kunad]. Each and every thing,
> however small, would be to him a revelation, leading him to his Beloved, the Object
> of his quest. So great shall be the discernment of this seeker that he will discriminate
> between truth and falsehood, even as he doth distinguish the sun from shadow. If
> in the uttermost corners of the East the sweet savors of God be wafted, he will as-
> suredly recognize and inhale their fragrance, even though he be dwelling in the
> uttermost ends of the West [mathalan agar nasīm-i haqq az mashriq-i ibdā’ wazad
> wa ‘ū dar maghrib-i ikhtirā’ bāshad al-battah istishmām kunad]. . . . When the chan-

> unfailingly perceive the breath of the Beloved across immeasurable distances, and
> will, led by its perfume, attain and enter the City of Certitude. . . . With both his
> inner and outer ear, he will hear from its dust the hymns of glory and praise ascend-
> ing unto the Lord of Lords, and with his inner eye will he discover the mysteries of
> “return” and “revival” [wa asrār-i rujū’ wa iyāb rā bi-chashm-i sirr mulāhazah
> farmayad]. . . . The attainment unto this City quenches thirst without water, and

> mysteries of an inscrutable Wisdom, and upon every rose-bush a myriad nightin-
> gales pour out, in blissful rapture, their melody. Its wondrous tulips unfold the

> of holiness breathe the perfume of the Messianic Spirit [wa az nafahāt-i qudsiyyah-
> ash nafkhah-yi rūh al-qudus-i ‘isawi bāhir]. It bestows wealth without gold, and
> confers immortality without death. In each one of its leaves ineffable delights are
> treasured, and within every chamber unnumbered mysteries lie hidden.

The tablet concludes with a reiteration of the nature of jihād in using the by
> now familiar words religiously motivated warrior (mujāhid) and struggle (juhd).
> The agony of separation (cf. Jacob’s separation from Joseph) is conjured here as
well:

> They that valiantly labor in quest of God [wa mujaāidin ﬁ Allāh], will, when once
> they have renounced all else but Him, be so attached and wedded to that City, that
> a moment’s separation from it would to them be unthinkable. . . . Once in about a
> thousand years shall this City be renewed and readorned [dar ra’s-i hizār sanah aw
azyad aw aqall tajdīd shavad wa tazyīn yābad].

Wherefore, O my friend, it behooves us to exert the highest endeavour to attain
> that City [bāyad juhdi numūd tā bih ān madīnah wāsil shawīm], and by the grace
> of God and His loving-kindness, rend asunder the “veils of glory” [kashf-i subūhat-i
> jalāl]; so that with inﬂexible steadfastness, we may sacriﬁce our drooping souls in
> the path of the new beloved [dar rāh-i mahbūb-i tāzah]. . . . That City is none other
> than the Word of God revealed in every age and dispensation [ān madīnah kutub-i
> ilahiyyah ast dar har ‘ahdī]. In the days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days
> of Jesus, the Gospel; in the days of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, the Qur’án;
> in this day, the Bayan; and in the Dispensation of Him Whom God will make
> manifest, His own Book [dar ‘ahd-i man yab’athuhu allāh kitāb-i ‘ū]—the Book unto
> which all the Books of former Dispensations must needs be referred [kih rujū’-i kull-i

> that hilm is, in some ways, synonymous with islām.53 It is therefore perhaps natural
> that the Baha’i teachings, as a distinct development-cum-interpretation of islami-

> but violence of any kind. This appears to be nonnegotiable. The one exception is

spiritual in force—that is necessary when combating aggression.

One of the striking results of the Safavid “venture” (1501–1722), when Shi’ism for
> the ﬁrst time in centuries became consolidated as the ofﬁcial religion of a distinct
> polity, was the transposition of Twelver Shi’ism from the “key of Arabic” to the
> “key of Persian.” Joseph had always loomed especially important in persianate
> Islam,54 whether as a symbol of divine kingship (and therefore “civilization as
> such”) or as an example of the kind of moral and ethical restraint and wisdom in
> governance—indicated in the term hilm—that lends a particlar élan to his holy
> heroism. As such, he is an exemplar for kings and shahs, suﬁ shaykhs, their dis-
> ciples, and the common “average” Muslim, who, as this tradition so wisely ob-
> serves, is assaulted by the same passions as the king. The halīm is, in the ﬁnal
> analysis, the civilized man whose soul is formed by the energies and expectations
> of the last divine revelation: a true Muslim. As such, he is the polar opposite of the
> jāhil, the savage, uncivilized inhabitant of a brutal world, unregenerated by and
ungrateful for revelation, the word of God.55

It was during the nineteenth century, perhaps with the photographed horrors
> of the American Civil War, that the glory associated with military might and
> achievement began to diminish, a process that seems to have ended in the abject
> brutality and carnage of World War I, the Great War. The Baha’i teachings are there­
> fore very much in harmony with what might be thought a particular Zeitgeist: the
> world was becoming smaller, a new globalization was on the horizon. Baha’u’llah
> saw this, as is clear from his many writings on the oneness of humanity, the one-
> ness of the world, and the oneness of religion and God. It is also clear that these
> freshly articulated ideas had a history, especially in Islam, the parent religion and
> culture of the ﬁrst three central ﬁgures of the Baha’i faith: the Bab, Baha’u’llah,
> and ‘Abdu’l-Baha. I have argued elsewhere that to some extent Baha’i irenics may
> be seen as a response to, in the ﬁrst place, the violent and brutal animosity that

> had split and aggravated anew the unity of the post-Muhammadan Muslim
> world.56 With the rise in the later medieval and premodern periods of the three
> mutually exclusive islamicate imperial protonations, the Ottoman, the Mughal,
> and the Safavid, such disunity and estrangement became reiﬁed, certainly politi-
> cized, and frequently dramatized. Figuring thereby a distinctive islamicate mo-
> dernity, these new alignments and rivalries sought, through what might be thought
> more purely religious emblems, to mobilize loyalties and enmities. The late Henry
> Corbin’s designation of Twelver Shi’ism as a “religion d’amour par excellence” ac-
> curately captures one arc of Shi’i piety, namely the central and deﬁning attitude
> and relationship of allegiance to charismatic absolute authority (walāya).57 The
> other arc, one that may complete the circle of Twelver Shi’i religious dynamism,
> has been characterized as “sacred hatred.”58 The operative technical term is ta­
> barra, a companion concept for tawalla (from W-L-Y, which is also the basis for
the word walāya) built on the root verb bari’a (from B-R-’A):

> For the imams, bara’a [or tabarrī] is the indispensable complement to, and opposite
> of, walāya [or tawallī]. If we translate walāya [or tawallī] by “faithful, tender love” of
> the Imam, then bara’a [or tabarrī] would be “wild, implacable hatred” of the Enemy
> of the Imam. . . . According to the imams, one cannot fully love the Imam and his
> Cause without simultaneously hating the Enemy opposed to him and to his Cause
> since the time of creation; the “believer” who is faithful to the imams should pledge
> Love and Obedience to the Master who initiates him into the divine Sciences, and
> Hatred and Disobedience to him who stands for the opposite of this Initiation. If the
> world is the way it is, invaded by evil and darkness that will only increase until the
> triumphal return of the Mahdi, it is because the Masters of Injustice and the mass
> majority [‘amma] that follows them are dominant, condemning the Sages and the
> chosen minority [khassa] that follows them to isolation and suffering. . . . [T]he
> imams have forbidden their faithful to show their Hatred or their Disobedience in
> the form of revolt or open insurrection; bara’a should thus remain interiorized (just
> as is the case for walāya, because of the danger of death for the person who professes
> it) until the return of the hidden imam, even if on the outside obedience to the unjust
> is forced; this is one of the facets of the Battle that has forever opposed the initiated
> and the counter initiated; sabb al-sahāba [insulting or even damning members of
> the early community seen as enemies of the Shi’] is one way of upholding it.59

History of Religions, including the anthropology of religion and other related

It may well be that the founders of the Baha’i religion were expressing a general
> cultural exhaustion with such powerful spiritual incongruities, non sequiturs,
> and contradictions as are implied in such formulae as “sacred hatred.” The ﬁrst

purpose of the original preaching of Muhammad.

2. ​Continuing this theme of nonviolence, Baha’u’llah’s son and successor, Abdu’l-Baha’, the title
> by which Abbas Effendi (1844–1921) is most widely known, has left numerous, emphatic pronounce-
ments, such as the following:

> True religion is based upon love and agreement. Bahā’u’llāh has said, “If religion and faith are the
> causes of enmity and sedition, it is far better to be nonreligious, and the absence of religion would
> be preferable; for we desire religion to be the cause of amity and fellowship. If enmity and hatred
> exist, irreligion is preferable.” Therefore, the removal of this dissension has been specialized in
> Bahā’u’llāh, for religion is the divine remedy for human antagonism and discord. But when we make

Seven Doors to Islam, 259–72.

40. ​“[Mu’awiya’s] was a style that involved indirect rule through the ashraf, supplemented by his

41. ​B-SH-R is a frequent qur’anic root. It is in the form bashar “(mortal and fallible) man” thirty-
> seven times. In a nearly equal number of passages, however, it is connected with a rather interesting
> semantic reversal from the somewhat gloomy connotations of bashar, namely “human as weak,” in
> numerous words for joy and glad tidings; in addiiton to bashīr, they are: bushr (three times), bushrā
(ﬁfteen times), bashshāra (thirty-three times), istabshāra (eight times), abshara (one time).

42. ​Nadhīr is said to be the opposite of bashīr in A. J. Wensinck, “Nadhir,” in First Encyclopedia

> these two opposites as descriptive of the ofﬁce of prophet, though he does remark that nadhīr is held
by some to be a synonym for rasūl, “messenger.” There is no article in EI2 for bashīr.

43. ​The irony expressed by this speciﬁc lexical juxtaposition has, as far as I know, not been ex-
> plored. On the distinctive circular structure of sura 12, see Mustansir Mir, “The Qur’anic story of

46. ​Joseph’s popularity may also be connected to his functioning as an emblem of “irenic relief ”
in an otherwise polemic-saturated milieu within Shi’ism.
