**THE END IS NEARISH!**

_> From a series of press releases issued between August 1993 and October 1994 by Neal Chase, spokesman for Bahá'ís Under the Provisions of the Covenant, a religious sect based in Missoula Montana._

**RELEASE DATE: AUGUST 4, 1993**

In our previous releases, we gave you the exact date that New York was to be bombed: November 26, 1992, the Day of the Covenant. That date, plus the prophesied season of three months (Daniel 7:12) brought us to February 26, 1993, the day, the minute, the hour, the second that the World Trade Center was bombed. We stated that this was just an OMEN of the big one yet to come.

Now we are giving the date for the big one. Saddam Hussein has vowed to take revenge on New York and the United Nations for what they did to his country. Ezekiel gives us THE VERY DAY that this will happen. In chapter 4, verse 5, he states that the destruction of the city will last 190 days, which, counting from the date of the bombing of the World Trade Center, brings us exactly to September 4, 1993, the day the UN building and all New York City will be nuked.

We have warned you. The blood of the people is not on our hands.

**RELEASE DATE: SEPTEMBER 27, 1993**

From the date of the World Trade Center bombing of February 26, 1993 (which we accurately predicted), there were exactly 190 days to September 4, 1993. Ezekiel then gives 40 more days in chapter 4, verse 6, which brings us to October 14, 1993, the day the UN building and all New York City will be destroyed by a thermonuclear bomb!

Noah sent out three releases telling the people the day of the flood to come. With the third and final release, the flood wiped out those who had scoffed at him. This release is the third release pertaining to the big one. This third release is the final blast, the warning trumpet.

The waiting is over.

**RELEASE DATE: NOVEMBER 1, 1993**

On March 23, 1994, the veils will be rent asunder with the fiery holocaust of New York City's millions of inhabitants! Forty days later, on May 2, 1994, will come the Battle of Armageddon, in which one third of mankind will be killed in one hour of thermonuclear war.

WE DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE when we wrote in our previous releases that New York would be destroyed on September 4 and October 14, 1993. We didn't make a mistake, not even a teeny eeny one!

The New Jerusalem Bible and the New English Bible both say, in Ezekiel 4, that the destruction of the city of New York will occur over a period of 190 days. But the King James Version and the Revised Standard Version give 390 days for that same verse of Ezekiel. We gave the earlier date because if we had given the later date of 390 days and all New York had been destroyed after 190 days—on September 4—or even 40 days after that—on October 14—then everyone would be dead and we would be to blame for having misguided the people.

There shall be no more delay! God never makes a promise he doesn't keep.

**RELEASE DATE: APRIL 4, 1994**

All the dates we have given in our past releases are correct dates given by God as contained in the Holy Scriptures. Not one of these dates was wrong; all of them pertain to the siege of the city of New York and the UN building, which will come to an end on May 2, 1994.

Exactly 390 days after the World Trade Center bombing, on March 23, 1994 came the Edison Gas Explosion. \[A gas pipeline exploded in Edison, New Jersey, on March 24, injuring about a hundred residents.\] As reported by the New York Times, it was likened by eyewitnesses to a nuclear blast comparable to Nagasaki or Hiroshima. This woke up the people of that area, who are in IMMEDIATE DANGER, so that now they can leave the city by May 2, 1994, when the siege will be complete.

Ezekiel gives a total of 430 days for the siege of the city, one day for each year that the Israelites were in captivity in Egypt before the Exodus of Moses. Four hundred and thirty days added to the World Trade Center bombing of February 26, 1993, brings us exactly to May 2, 1994.

By now, all the people have been forewarned. We have done our job.

**RELEASE DATE: OCTOBER 9, 1994**

Exactly as we have been predicting, Saddam Hussein has now mobilized his forces to take his revenge for the Gulf War: full-scale thermonuclear destruction of the UN building and all New York City, scheduled to take place on November 26, 1994, give or take a week or two.

On May 2, 1994, there was the Lincoln Tunnel Explosion, which completed the days of the siege. \[On May 5, a helicopter crashed near the New Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel and burst into flames, killing two.\] In Revelation 8 it says that there will be "silence in heaven for about half an hour." The original Greek shows that in fact this half hour is half a year, or about 180 days. About 180 days from May 2, 1994, brings us to the significant Holy Day of November 26, 1994. The Bible does not say exactly 180 days but about that much time, with a week or two leeway, for the nuclear destruction of the UN building and New York City to take place.

We are the only ones in the entire world guiding the people to their safety, security, and salvation!

We have a 100 percent track record!

Fifteen Years of Failed Prophecy

Coping with cognitive dissonance in a Baha’i sect

by

Robert Balch, John Domitrovich,
Barbara Lynn Mahnke, Vanessa Morrison

On April 29, 1980, members of the Baha’is Under the Provisions of the
Covenant (BUPC) entered fallout shelters to await a nuclear holocaust that they
believed would fulfill the prophecies of Revelation. In the first hour, they expected a
third of the world's population to perish, and they claimed that over the next twenty
years, the planet would be ravaged by starvation, disease, revolutions, and natural
disasters. They believed that by the year 2000
God's kingdom would be established on earth and a thousand years of peace would
ensue.

This prediction was only the first in a long series of failed prophecies that
would test the faith of the BUPC. Between 1980 and 1995 the group’s leader, Dr.
Leland Jensen, set twenty dates for the battle of Armageddon or lesser disasters that
would lead up to the Apocalypse. In this paper we will examine the long-term effects of
these failed prophecies on the BUPC.

Our analysis is based on the theory of cognitive dissonance, which Festinger,
Riecken, and Schachter (1956) used to analyze reactions to failed prophecy in a
millennial flying saucer cult. The group’s leader, Marian Keech, was a medium who
claimed an extraterrestrial being named Sananda had warned her that much of the
Midwest would be inundated by a catastrophic flood on December 21, 1954.

Paradoxically, Festinger et al. predicted that the failure of Mrs. Keech’s
prophecy would result in increased conviction and heightened efforts to recruit new
believers. They argued that Mrs. Keech and her followers would experience severe
cognitive dissonance when the prophecy failed, but that it would be extremely difficult
for them to abandon their beliefs because they had made numerous public and private
commitments to the prediction. To reduce the dissonance they would invent
rationalizations to explain away the disconfirmation, and more importantly they would
try to gain social support for their beliefs by increasing their efforts to recruit new
believers.

The study by Festinger et al. supported these hypothesis. Mrs. Keech
responded to the failure of her prophecy by proclaiming that the catastrophe had been

called off because her group “had spread so much light that God had saved the world
from destruction” (1956, 169). She eagerly granted interviews to reporters and invited
curiosity seekers into her home to explain Sananda’s latest revelation. Most of her
followers were equally enthusiastic about publicizing Sananda’s message, which was
remarkable because the group had never shown much interest in proselytizing.

Festinger et al. specified five conditions that must be met before prophetic
failure will be followed by increased conviction and vigorous proselytizing:

> 1. Belief in the prediction must be held with deep conviction.
> 2. Members must have committed themselves to the prediction by engaging in
> important actions that are difficult to undo.

3. The prediction must be specified enough that it can be clearly disconfirmed.
> 4. There must be undeniable evidence that the prediction was wrong.

5. Members must have social support from fellow believers.

The BUPC clearly met these conditions in 1980, but less so when Jensen made
his second prediction a few years later. By the 1990s, when Jensen and a few members
of his inner circle met the first condition of deep conviction, and the commitments
specified in the second condition were minimal compared to those that members had
made in 1980. Our date suggest that the diminishing relevance of the Festinger et al.
theory reflects the emergence of an underground culture of dissonance-reduction
consisting of disclaimers and post factum rationalizations that reduced the impact of the
predictions and subsequent disconfirmations. This culture enabled members to dismiss
the predictions and move on with their everyday lives while still claiming allegiance to
Jensen and the Baha’i faith. The goal of preparing for the holocaust ultimately was
displaced by more immediate, mundane concerns, despite the fact that the group's
rhetoric remained as apocalyptic as ever.

DATA COLLECTION

Our data on the BUPC come from four participant-observer studies we
conducted between 1980 and 1996. Beside taking part in numerous group activities,
including potluck dinners, teaching sessions, and weekly meetings, we conducted forty-
seven formal interview with members, three group interviews with six ex-members,
three individual interviews with high-ranking defectors who left in 1994 and 1996, and
a lengthy interview with Jensen in 1980. Balch and two student also spent the night of
April 29, 1980, in three BUPC fallout shelters. In addition, we have studied the group’s
press releases and BUPC newsletters pertaining to the predictions.1

AN OVERVIEW OF THE BUPC

The BUPC are a small Baha’i sect based in Missoula, Montana. Their founder,
a chiropractor named Leland Jensen, was expelled from the mainstream Baha’is in
1960\. During a doctrinal dispute following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the

\[1\] Balch observed the BUPC over an eight-month period before and after the 1980

prediction. Mahnke (1987) spent eight months with the group in 1986 when members
expected Halley’s comet to collide with the earth. Domitrovich took part in BUPC
activities between 1990 and 1995 when most of the failed prophecies occurred, and
Morrison observed the group for almost twelve months in 1995 and 1996.

[page 76]

Guardian of the Baha’i faith, Jensen aligned himself with a schismatic leader named
Mason Remey who claimed to be the second Guardian. However, Remey died a few
years later and his followers split into rival factions, each proclaiming a different
Guardian. In 1964, after becoming disillusioned with the infighting, Jensen and his
wife, Opal, moved to Missoula where they opened a chiropractic clinic. Although
Jensen once had been a highly acclaimed Baha’i missionary, he had stopped teaching
the Faith by the time he got to Montana.

Then in 1969 Jensen was convicted of sexually molesting a fifteen-year-old
patient. During the trial, several women testified against him, and he was sentenced to
twenty years in the Montana State Prison. Shortly after his imprisonment, Jensen had a
revelation:

I felt a presence only. I saw nobody. I saw no dove, no burning bush
> or anything of this nature. It talked to me – not in a physical voice but
> very vividly expressing to me that I was the Promised Joshua
> (prophesied in Zechariah 3).

After studying the Bible and Baha’i writings, Jensen understood that his
mission was to establish the Baha’i Universal House of Justice after the world was
cleansed of evil and apostasy by a nuclear holocaust.2

Jensen immediately began tying together diverse strands of Bible prophecy,
Baha’i teachings, and pyramidology to substantiate his claims. He recruited many
followers in prison, and after being paroled in 1973 he founded the BUPC in Missoula.
By the end of the 1970s Jensen also had attracted followers in Wyoming, Colorado, and
Arkansas.

Since 1980 membership in the BUPC has fluctuated considerably, but it
probably has never exceeded 200 nationwide despite Jensen’s claims of having
thousands of followers around the world. In 1994, the last year for which we have a
membership list, there were only sixty-six members in Montana and fewer than twenty
in other states. The Wyoming and Arkansas contingents disbanded after the 1980
disconfirmation, but new groups were formed in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Over the years, about a third of the members have had college degrees, and the
group has always stressed the importance of reading and research, so members tend to
be exceptionally well informed about the Bible, Baha’i teachings, world religions, and
international politics.

One of the most significant events in the history of the BUPC was the
recruitment of Neal Chase, a spiritual seeker from Wisconsin who proved to be brilliant
at synthesizing Jensen’s teachings with other prophetic beliefs. Chase’s most
\[2\] The development of the BUPC is a classic example of the psychopathological model
of cult formation, in which religious founders assume a messianic role to compensate
for a devastating collapse of their self-image and social world (Bainbridge and Stark
1979).

notable contribution was to bolster the “proofs” for Jensen’s mission by incorporating
the prophecies of George Williams, leader of an obscure nineteenth-century Mormon
sect known as the Morrisites (Anderson 1988; Chase 1990). According to Chase,
Williams predicted that Christ would return in Montana’s Deer Lodge Valley where the
Montana State Prison is located. The anticipated date of Christ’s return, August 9, 1969,
happened to be the first full day that Jensen spent in the prison, which Chase claims
bears a striking resemblance to Ezekiel’s temple described in the Bible.3 By 1990,
Jensen, then 76, had turned much of the responsibility for interpreting the scriptures
over to Chase.4

THE PREDICTIONS

Between 1979 and 1995 Jensen and Chase made twenty specific predictions.

The first time Jensen set a date for the apocalypse was in 1979, when he proclaimed
that a nuclear war would begin on April 29, 1980. Jensen’s second prediction came in
1985, when he claimed that Halley’s comet would crash into the earth the following
year, triggering catastrophic upheavals that would culminate in the battle of
Armageddon. All eighteen predictions in the 1990s were made by Chase, although each
had Jensen’s approval. Unlike Jensen’s two predictions in the 1980’s, which foretold
worldwide catastrophes, Chase’s predictions pertained to small-scale disasters that he
claimed would lead step-by-step toward the apocalypse. Some of his predictions
focused on upheavals caused by meteors, asteroids, and comets, but most pertained to
the destruction of New York City by a nuclear bomb that would be planted by Middle
Eastern terrorists.

REACTIONS TO PROPHECY FAILURE IN THE BUPC

Two predominant patterns emerged in response to the BUPC’s failed
prophecies. Jensen and Chase reacted in a manner that for the most part supports
dissonance theory, whereas their followers generally did not. Therefore, it is important
to treat these patterns separately.

The Reactions of Jensen and Chase

Before and after each prophesied date, Jensen and Chase behaved much like
Marian Keech. Prior to every date they made strong public commitments by

issuing strident press releases, and in the 1990s Chase made numerous unequivocal
proclamations on the BUPCs public-access television show, “Baha’i Phone-In Live.”
Before the 1980 date, Jensen urged his followers to build fallout shelters and stock them
with food, water, and survival gear, and he allowed his own shelter to be photographed
for a front-page story in the local newspaper. Jensen also proclaimed in one of his

\[3\] Leroy Anderson, the leading expert on the Morrisites (Anderson 1988), disputes
Chase’s claims about William’s Deer Lodge prophecy. In a personal conversation,
Anderson told Balch that Williams never specified August 6, 1969, as the date for the
Second Coming of Christ. The date simply happened to be the day of the last annual
Morrisite gathering.

\[4\] Jensen died unexpectedly on August 6, 1996. Chase has taken the helm and members
seem to be taking the transition in stride. Neither the group’s apocalyptic rhetoric nor its
routine activities appear to have changed. However, Jensen’s death is likely to have
serious repercussions because Chase is disliked by some influential longtime members.

books that any religion that cannot predict the exact moment of the apocalypse “lacks
Divine Guidance” (1979, 61-62).

Jensen and Chase also reacted like Mrs. Keech when their predictions were
disconfirmed. In light of the hypothesis that proselytizing should increase after
disconfirmation, their most notable response was to heighten efforts to spread the
BUPC message. After each failed prediction they quickly issued more press releases in
which they insisted they had been right all along. These releases were sent as far away
as the Vatican and the United Nations, and frequently they were hand delivered to
politicians and media executives. Jensen and Chase eagerly granted interviews to
newspapers and radio talk shows, and they urged BUPC members to take advantage of
each reprieve by renewing their efforts to recruit 144,000 who would enter God’s
kingdom.

Renewed proselytizing, however, required plausible explanations for each
prophecy failure. Throughout the fifteen-year period, at least seven types of
explanations were used: (1) the prediction was fulfilled spiritually rather than
physically; (2) the prophecy was fulfilled physically, but not in the manner expected;
(3) the date was off because of miscalculation; (4) the date was a prediction, not a
prophecy; (5) the leaders has a moral responsibility to warn the public despite the date’s
uncertainty; (6) God had given the world a reprieve; and (7) the predictions had been
tests of member’s faith.

1. Jensen relied heavily on the notion of a spiritual fulfillment in 1980. He
claimed that the seven-year Tribulation described in Revelation had commenced on
April 29 and that the four winds of destruction (Revelation 7:1) were being held back
until the 144,000 had been recruited. He offered a similar explanation in 1986 after
Halley’s comet failed to crash into the earth:

> The Spiritual fulfillment [of the prophecy] did take place. A spiritual
> stone hit the earth. This stone is the message of the messiahship that
> only the [true] Baha’is understand. The spiritual stone crushes and
> destroys what the Christians claim, and what the covenant breakers
> [mainstream Baha’is] claim.

When a meteor collision and massive earthquakes failed to occur as predicted
in 1991, Jensen claimed the prediction had been fulfilled by a “spiritual

earthquake” caused by the defection of one of his most important followers,
“Everything,” he said, “happens on the spiritual plane before it manifests in the physical
plane.”

2. More often, Jensen and Chase claimed their predictions were physically
fulfilled by other events that happened on or around the dates or shortly thereafter. In
1980, Jensen cited numerous phone calls from reporters as far away as Australia to
prove that he had fulfilled the prophecy that the Seventh Angel would pour his “bowl of
wrath” into the air (Revelation 16:17-18). He claimed this referred to the worldwide
media coverage his message received on April 29. When Mt. St. Helens erupted
nineteen days later, Jensen proclaimed the volcanic ash that inundated Missoula was a
warning of what would happen when Portland and Seattle were bombed.

A more recent instance of claiming a physical fulfillment occurred in 1994
after Chase made the following prediction about the bombing of New York City:

On March 23, 1994, the veils will be rent asunder with the fiery
> holocaust of New York City’s millions of inhabitants! Forty days
> later will come the battle of Armageddon, in which one third of
> mankind will be killed in one hour of thermonuclear war. (Press
> release, November 1, 1993)

3. Jensen and Chase frequently claimed to have made a miscalculation when
they missed the mark. After the prophecy failure in 1980, Jensen immediately set a
second date and then a third. Chase used this strategy continuously in the 1990s. For
example, Chase’s first prediction about new York was that the city would be bombed
on November 29, 1992. Nothing happened until the world Trade Center was bombed
three months later, although not with a nuclear weapon. Chase subsequently cited
Daniel 7:12, which says, “their lives were prolonged for a season and a time,” to prove
that his prediction had been correct. Claiming that “a season” is three months, he
announced that the November 29 date “plus the prophesied season of three months
brought us to February 26, 1993, the day, the minute, the hour, the second that the
World Trade Center was bombed” (press release, August 4, 1993).

4. The admission of human error was rationalized by making sharp distinction
between a prediction and a prophecy. Prophecies came directly from

God, whereas the BUPC’s predictions were based on research and logic, which are
subject to human fallibility. As Chase put it: “We can’t be false prophets because we
don’t claim to be prophets. We simply interpret what is already there in the Bible.”
Jensen had always made this distinction, but it became increasingly important in the
1990s. according to this reasoning, Jensen and Chase were only human and they could
make mistakes like everyone else.

5. Despite the uncertainties caused by human failings, Jensen and Chase
claimed they had a moral responsibility to warn the public because so many “signs” had
suggested that catastrophes were imminent. The signs were synchronistic events that
converged around a particular date. For instance, Chase claimed that numerous events
had pointed to November 26, 1992, as the date for the bombing of New York:

1. Thousands of covenant-breaking Baha’is would be gathering on

> this date in New York, a city marked for destruction in the
> prophecies of Nostradamus.
2. Comet Swift-Tuttle, which supposedly heralded the founding of the

> Baha’i faith in 1863, would reach its closest distance to earth on
> December 18.
3. During a lunar eclipse on December 9, the moon would turn blood

red as foretold in Revelation 6:12 and Joel 2:31.

To ignore these signs would have been morally irresponsible because the
BUPC had a “mandate from God to warn the people” about the apocalypse. If New
York had been destroyed while they kept silent, because they only suspected something
might happen, then “the blood of the people” would have been on their hands.

6. With each disconfirmation, Jensen and Chase claimed that God had granted
the BUPC a reprieve. After the 1980 prediction, Jensen claimed that God had given the
BUPC more time to recruit the 144,000. The same explanation was offered in 1986.
After both the Trade center bombing and the Edison pipeline explosion in the 1990’s,

Chase claimed that God in his mercy had spare New York, but that the predictions were
“wake-up” calls for the city’s residents.

7. Finally and most consistently, Jensen and Chase repeatedly claimed that the
predictions were tests. After the 1980 prediction, Jensen pointed out that Matthew
24:37 says that the “coming of the Son of Man [Jensen] will repeat what happened in
Noah’s time,” which according to Baha’i teachings is that

Noah predicted the flood several times (Baha’u’llah 1931). Noah’s first predictions
separated the “sheep from the goats” so that when the flood finally happened only the
pure-of-heart remained. By the 1990s, Jensen was referring to the 1980 prediction of
“God’s fire drill” and a “practice run.”

The explanations offered by Jensen and Chase are examples of what Lyman
and Scott (1968) call accounts. These are face-saving strategies intended to reduce
embarrassment after a discrediting situation has occurred. In the BUPC these accounts
enabled Jensen and Chase to claim they had been right all along: “We didn’t make a
mistake,” Chase proclaimed after two failed attempts to predict the nuclear destruction
of New York, “not even a teeny eeny one!” (press release, November 1, 1993). Almost
a year later, after five more failed prophecies, Chase claimed that the BUPC had “a 100
percent track record!” (press release, October 9, 1994).

At first glance, the way Jensen and Chase reacted to the failure of their
predictions seems to be entirely consistent with cognitive dissonance theory. However,
the theory does not consider the effects of repeated prophecy failures.

Before the 1980 date, Jensen encouraged his followers to build fallout shelters
and store food to prepare for the holocaust. Yet by the time of the second prediction in
1986, Jensen no longer emphasized physical preparedness and the group’s fallout
shelters, including his own, had been dismantled. Instead he claimed that Missoula
would be safe because of its remote mountainous location, as well as the fact that the
“Promised One” lived there. In the event that shelters might be needed, Jensen said that
the BUPC would be able to occupy an extensive network of tunnels under the
university and city center, and he claimed his followers could stockpile all the
provisions they would need in just three days.

By downplaying the need for building, stocking, and maintaining shelters,
Jensen eliminated one of the most important commitments members had made in 1980.
This is significant because, following the reasoning of Festinger et al., the fewer
commitments members make before a prediction, the less the dissonance should be
when a prophecy fails.

Perhaps more important are two changes that occurred in the 1990s. First, the
nature of the predictions changed from apocalyptic global catastrophes to small-scale
disasters heralding the nuclear conflagration. Chase explained that prophecy fulfillment
is not a discrete event but a continuous, unfolding process. This had the effect of
diffusing the impact of any particular prophecy failure.

Second, beginning in 1993, Jensen and Chase began making disclaimers
before their predictions. Disclaimers are face-saving strategies that are used to head off
anticipated embarrassment (Hewitt and Stokes 1975). For example, one of the dates for

the bombing of New York was Septemberm4, 1993, the third anniversary of Opal
Jensen’s death. Even before the day was over, Jensen was speculating that the real date
might be September 8, the anniversary of his wife’s burial. Before the next date Chase
clearly hedged his bets by saying:

> I don’t really care if the bombing is today, tomorrow, or next year, I
> only know it is part of God’s plan, and it will happen as prophesied.

Nothing can alter the plan of God.

Because severe dissonance is likely to occur only when a prediction is
believed with deep conviction, the use of disclaimers should reduce the
dissonance caused by prophecy failure. What is most interesting about these
disclaimers however, is that ordinary members had been using them for years
before Jensen and Chase.

The Reactions of Ordinary Members

The responses of ordinary BUPC members to the failed predictions were
considerably more complicated than those of Jensen and Chase. Not only were their
reactions consistent with the hypotheses proposed by Festinger et al., but their
reactions changed considerably over time. By “ordinary members” we refer to everyone
in the BUPC except Jensen and Chase. It will help to divide the fifteen-year period into
three phases: 1980-1981, before and after the original prediction; 1986-1987, before
and after the second; and 1990-1995, when Chase made a flurry of predictions about
lesser events that would culminate in Armageddon.

1980-1981. The first prediction provided the clearest test of dissonance theory
because the BUPC met all the conditions specified by Festinger et al. (Balch,
Farnsworth, and Wilkens 1983)

The prediction was specific down to the minute, and members made
substantial commitments based on their belief that it would come true. The most
important commitment was the construction of fallout shelters, but members also wrote
numerous pamphlets and books using Bible prophecies and pyramidology to prove the
prediction was correct. Several members sent letters to the local paper warning people
to prepare for the holocaust, and the BUPC organized a nuclear-preparedness group
called SAFE (Safety and Fall-Out

Education), which distributed thousands of leaflets urging Missoulians to prepare for
nuclear war. The disconfirmation was painfully obvious to everyone, but, consistent
with Festinger et al.’s fifth condition, members had the support of a close-knit
community of fellow believers.

However, there was no increase in proselytizing after the date. In fact,
proselytizing stopped altogether, which is significant because the BUPC had been
heavily committed to teaching the Faith before April 29. During the first BUPC
meeting after the prophecy failure, Jensen gave an emotional speech in which he
exhorted his followers to capitalize on the reprieve: “Rise and Shine!” he shouted.
“Establish the kingdom! Teach as you never have before!” Although he had brought a
large box of books for members to distribute, not one was taken. The BUPC were
extremely confused and demoralized, and attendance at meetings dropped precipitously.
These reactions clearly contradict dissonance theory.

On the other hand, it took six months before anyone defected, and when
members left, their stated reasons usually had no direct connection to the failed
prophecy. Instead their leaving usually was prompted by doctrinal disputes or
interpersonal conflicts within the group. The prophecy failure may have contributed to
their disillusionment but it was not emphasized by any of our informants. The members
who stayed were able to sustain their faith by claiming that the prophecy was only a
test, which had given them more time to prepare. The Noah analogy was quickly
adopted throughout the group. However, rather than redoubling their efforts to prepare
for the holocaust, most members seemed burned out by the group’s apocalyptic fervor.
They claimed they had become so wrapped up in the prophecy that they had ;lost sight
of the basic Baha’I teachings. As a member explained: “I think we all made a mistake.
We got too caught up in the physical. We weren’t ready for the war because spiritually
none of us were strong enough.”

1986-1987. Since Jensen claimed the seven-year Tribulation began on April
29, 1980, he had committed himself to a second prediction for 1987. Halley’s comet,
which was due to arrive in 1986, provided the rationale. Jensen predicted that on April
29, 1986, the comet would get pulled into an orbit around the earth and begin to break
up, pelting the planet with debris that would strike with the force of nuclear warheads.
The gravitational pull of the comet would produce massive earthquakes and a
convulsive shifting of the earth’s crust. This would continue for one year until April 29,
1987, when the remainder of the comet would plummet to earth, producing tidal waves
thousands of feet high and earthquakes more devastating than any before.

The predictions rekindled the group’s millennial enthusiasm. The comet
dominated practically every meeting as members eagerly discussed books, articles, TV
documentaries, and biblical prophecies about comets. On March 22, 1986, the group
finally went public with the prediction by issuing a press release proclaiming Halley’s
comet as the herald of the new kingdom.

However, the activities of the BUPC prior to the 1986 prediction differed from those in
1980 in two important ways. First, this time members made hardly any personal
preparations to survive the coming destruction. Missoula presumably would be safe
from the tidal waves and earthquakes that would devastate coastal cities.

The second difference was that members began hedging their bets with
disclaimers before the 1986 date. The group’s self-taught comet expert suggested that
God might be using the comet to distract mankind from the real threat, which he
speculated might be asteroids. Others speculated that God might be using the comet to
test their faith, much as they had been tested in 1980. Still others claimed Jensen could
be mistaken because, despite his identity as the “Promised One”, he was “only a man”
with failings like everyone else.

On the evening of April 28, 1986, the BUPC had a potluck dinner. Unlike a
similar meeting the night before the 1980 date when Jensen delivered a fiery speech
and members had talked excitedly about the impending holocaust, Jensen did not
address the group and nobody even mentioned the comet.

The morning after the disconfirmation members quietly resumed their
lives by going to work, attending school, or taking care of their children, as if it were
just another day. As in 1980 there was no increase in proselytizing and members
offered accounts to explain the failed prophecy, the most common being parallel with
Noah’s predictions. But unlike 1980 there was no apparent confusion or

disillusionment, perhaps because members had not committed themselves to the same
extent and because they already had prepared themselves for the prophecy failure. The
expression “business as usual” is a good description of the aftermath of the
disconfirmation. Although some members continued to profess belief that Armageddon
would happen by April 29, 1987, others appeared to have lost interest in Jensen’s date
setting.

By August of 1986 the emphasis had shifted away from the new date
to being spiritually prepared for the end, whenever it might occur. Reports by ex-
members indicated that the 1987 date was ignored by virtually everyone. Jensen began
ridiculing the Tribulation as a misguided concept promoted by “the Christian sects.”
And his followers quickly followed suit.

1990-1995. Prior to the 1980 and 1986 predictions, members had sought
confirming evidence to prove the accuracy of the prophecies, and that pattern continued
in the 1990s. The evidence marshaled to support the predictions included Hopi
prophecies, planetary conjunctions, dreams, numerological coincidences, the prophecies
of Nostradamus, and predictions made by psychics and other religious leaders, such as
Jeane Dixon and Elizabeth Clare Prophet.

However, as in 1986, the BUPC made a few public commitments to the dates.

The members who had weathered the disconfirmations of the 1980s were the least
likely to take the predictions seriously. They made virtually no preparations. Some of
the newer members attended civil defense workshops and stored survival gear, but these
were isolated individual efforts. No maps of the city’s civil defense tunnels were
distributed to the BUPC and members did not make an effort to warn the public as they
had with SAFE in 1980. On two occasions members boxed up their possessions and
camped in parks or their back yards when earthquakes were expected, but these
commitments were minimal compared to those in the shelter-building days of 1979 and
1980\.

Members also used disclaimers more often than ever before. Significantly,
these face-saving strategies were extensions of the accounts that had been offered to
explain past prophecy failures. Even members of Jensen’s inner circle used these
disclaimers. For example, one of Jensen’s staunchest supporters started telling
prospective members “not to lay any stock in the predictions Neal made [because] the
real sign would be the entrance of the 144,000.” She added that “the truth is that people
would have really preferred for Neal to knock off his prophesying.”

After each failed prediction, life for the BUPC continued on course, There
were few traces of disillusionment among either new or old members. The BUPC
provided the usual accounts in an offhanded matter: Jensen and Chase had to warn the
public whether they were sure or not; God gave the BUPC more time because they were
not ready yet; the prediction had been just another test. Some members did not even
bother to offer accounts for the failed predictions. “I didn’t get too concerned about
these predictions,” one said, “because a number of them had not been materialized in
the past.” Proselytizing continued unabated, but few members stressed the predictions
when teaching the Faith. Instead they focused more on Jensen’s mission and the
importance of being spiritually prepared when the prophecies on Revelation ultimately
would be fulfilled. Even the World Trade Center bombing and Edison gas explosion
failed to rekindle the group’s apocalyptic enthusiasm.

Instead of focusing on Armageddon, members became increasingly absorbed
by everyday life in the BUPC. In addition to the traditional round of weekly and
monthly events, new group activities developed. These included a public-access
television show, information tables at the university. Sunday church services, song
writing and a choir, and demonstrations against the U.S. government’s treatment of
Iraq. The demonstrations are significant because prior to the 1990s the BUPC had never
shown an interest in changing political events, only monitoring them for warning signs.

In 1991, Jensen established a twelve-person governing body called the Second
International Baha’i Council (IBC) whose stated purpose was to lay the foundation for
the Universal House of Justice, which Jensen expected to govern the world after the
apocalypse.5 The IBC quickly came to dominate the lives of its members as its
meetings steadily became longer and more frequent. IBC members engaged in endless
wrangling over administrative details, writing projects, plans for establishing the world
government, and discussions of other members’ personal affairs, including martial
problems, homosexuality, and gambling.

In contrast to the informality of previous years, the BUPC took on increasingly
bureaucratic character despite the fact that by 1990 the group probably had fewer than
one hundred members nationwide. The IBC elected officers passed numerous “laws”
governing the conduct of BUPC members, and conducted its meetings according to
Robert’s Rules of Order. To deal with more mundane matters, local BUPC “councils”
were formed in Montana, Colorado, and Wisconsin. City and county councils were
established in Missoula, each with its own officers and formal responsibilities.

We found no evidence that these changes were prompted by the spate of failed
prophecies in the 1990s. Instead, former IBC members attributed them to the death of
Jensen’s wife in 1990 and the growing irrelevance of the predictions. According to their
first hypothesis, Opal Jensen’s death compelled Jensen to consider his own morality
and the need for an administrative structure to carry on his mission after he died. The
second hypothesis was that the new councils, offices, and activities were created to
keep members motivated as the predictions lost their grip on the BUPC.

In addition to the structural changes that occurred in the BUPC, the defection
rate accelerated in the 1990s. However, this seems unrelated to the failed prophecies.
Instead members were leaving because of doctrinal disputes6 and resentment over the
intrusion of the IBC in their private lives.

By 1996 we found only one member who still placed much emphasis on the
predictions. He admitted to “feeling stupid” when they failed and he claimed he would
leave if the nuclear war did not happen by 2000. For the others, the date setting had
become irrelevant even though they continued to believe in Jensen’s mission. The
IBC’s former vice president explained the general attitude this way:

> I think we’re immune to it now. We’ve been desensitized. [The dates]
> come and they go and they come and they go and they come and they

\[5\] The first IBC was established by Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha’i Faith.

The BUPC’s IBC was an exact replica of the first.

\[6\] These disputes usually revolved around the Guardianship. Ever since the 1970s,
Jensen had claimed that Mason Remey’s son, Pepe, was the Guardian, but Pepe
steadfastly refused the title. After Pepe died in 1994, Jensen began hinting that Chase
might be the next Guardian, but many members disagreed.

go. I think that’s…. why there isn’t much preparedness. I think
> people mostly really don’t believe them. I think mostly people would

CONCLUSION

When reviewing the reactions of the BUPC to repeated prophecy failures, two
major patterns emerge: the behavior of the BUPC leaders generally supports the theory
proposed by Festinger et al., but the responses of ordinary members do not. Jensen and
Chase maintained their enthusiasm for the predictions and never seemed disheartened
when their prophecies failed. This is not true for their followers. After the 1980 debacle,
Jensen’s followers became disillusioned and for a while they stopped proselytizing
altogether. Over the next fifteen years Jensen’s predictions became less and less
important for the average member. The BUPC made fewer preparations and they
showed little disappointment when the prophecies failed. By the mid-1990s the
predictions had become largely irrelevant.

The long-term responses of the ordinary members reflect the emergence of a
culture of dissonance-reduction with in the BUPC. The key ingredients of this culture
are accounts and disclaimers that were disseminated in BUPC meetings, press releases,
newsletters, and conversations among members. The origins of this culture can be
traced to the accounts Jensen used to explain the 1980 failure. Following subsequent
predictions, the ordinary members began turning these accounts into disclaimers to
reduce the possibility of dissonance even before it could occur.

Eventually even Jensen and Chase began to conform to the culture of
dissonance-reduction. Not only did they start using disclaimers themselves, but they
reduced the magnitude of the dissonance caused by their failed prophecies by

making predictions about relatively minor events instead of a global catastrophe. They
also demanded fewer commitments to their predictions.

The trends between 1980 and 1995 illustrate the process of goal displacement.

Goal displacement occurs when an organization’s original goals are supplanted by more
achievable ends. Group members “retreat from the initial program to a more moderate
and conservative program in the interest of maintaining the strength of the
organization” (Blau and Scott 1962, 229). In goal displacement the means of achieving
organizational goals become ends in themselves as members focus their attention on
mundane administrative jobs, and the group’s original ideals become increasingly
irrelevant to members’ everyday lives.

The concept of group displacement describes what happened in the BUPC. In
1980 the group’s primary goal was preparing for the holocaust, but by the 1990’s this
objective had been supplanted by the more immediate goal of creating an administrative
structure for ushering in God’s kingdom. The first hints of goal displacement occurred
after the failed prophecy in 1980 when members began downplaying the importance of
physical preparedness in favor of getting back to the basics of the Baha’i faith. The
back-to-the-basics movement reemerged after the second disconfirmation in 1986. By
1995 the culture of dissonance reduction had become so entrenched in the BUPC that
hardly anyone was concerned about the imminence of the Apocalypse.

Our study of the BUPC, like all case studies, is more suggestive than
conclusive, However, the data reveal two important weaknesses in Festinger et al.’s
dissonance theory of prophecy failure. First, the theory ignores a fundamental structural
distinction between leaders and followers: the leaders who make prophecies may
respond to their failure quite differently than their followers. Second, the theory fails to
address the long-range effects of prophecy failure. Our findings suggest that repeated
failures cause a decline in both the fervor before the predictions and the disappointment
afterward, until the goal of preparing for the apocalypse is finally displaced by more
ordinary and achievable objectives.
