    Shoghi Effendi’s Translation of Terms Related

to Law in the Bahá’í Scripture

Moojan Momen1

The goal of this paper was to find out whether there was any
pattern within Shoghi Effendi’s translation of terms related to
the word “law”. In this section of the paper, I have search the
translations of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings by Shoghi Effendi and
found instances where some word has been translated by Shoghi
Effendi as “Laws” or “Law”. I found that some 8-10 different
words were translated by Shoghi Effendi in this way:

> 1. Sharí`ah — Sharí`at — plural Shará’i`
> 2. Shar`
> 3. Óukm — plural A˙kám
> 4. Námús — plural nawámís
> 5. Qánún — plural qawánín
> 6. Aßl — plural ußúl
> 7. Amr — plural awámir
> 8. Óadd — plural ˙udúd
> 9. Sunna — plural sunan
> 10. Far∂ — plural furú∂
In the following, these words are considered in more details.

In each case, the word is given followed by a dictionary
definition and some words indicating the roots of the word and

how it came to mean “law” in Shoghi Effendi’s translations.
There is then some indication of whether the word occurs in the
Qur’an and how it is used there. This is followed by one or
more quotations, showing instances where Shoghi Effendi has
translated this word as “law” or “laws”. And following that, one
or more quotations in which Shoghi Effendi has translated this
word in some other way.

1\. Sharí`ah — Sharí`at — holy law. This is the usual word in
Islamic Law for the holy law which has been derived from the
Qur’an and Traditions — derived from root meaning “to go
along a path”. Thus the implication is that by following the
Sharí`ah, one is following the path of Mu˙ammad,

> There is one Qur’anic occurrence of this term: “And
> now have We set thee (O Mu˙ammad) on a clear road
> (sharí`ah) of (Our) commandment; so follow it, and
> follow not the whims of those who know not.” [Q 45:18]

In the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, this term appears in the
following passages, which have been translated by Shoghi Effendi:

> I implore Thee by Them Who are the Tabernacles of Thy
> Divine holiness ... to grant that Thy servants may not be
> kept back from this Divine Law (sharí`ah) ... [PM 27]

> Gather them, then, together around this Divine Law
> (sharí`ah), the covenant of which Thou hast established
> with all Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, and Whose
> ordinances Thou hast written down in Thy Tablets and
> Thy Scriptures. [PM 106]

> And yet no one hath paused to reflect that if the
> promised Qa’im should reveal the law (sharí`at) and
> ordinances (a˙kám) of a former Dispensation, why then
> should such traditions have been recorded, and why
> should there arise such a degree of strife and conflict that
> the people should regard the slaying of these

> companions as an obligation imposed upon them ... ? [KI
> 245]

> Where is He Who hath the authority to transform the
> Faith (sharí`ah) and the followers thereof? [KI 240]

> Let your principal concern be to rescue the fallen from
> the slough of impending extinction, and to help him
> embrace the ancient Faith (bih sharí`at-i baqá) of God.

[GWB 316]

> Behold the absurdity of their saying; how far it hath
> strayed from the path (sharí`at) of knowledge and
> understanding! [KI 136-7]

> ... others accused Him of being “the one that
> withholdeth the people from the path (sharí`at) of faith
> and true belief” ... [KI 215]

> And after Him there appeared from the Ridvan of the
> Eternal, the Invisible, the holy person of Salih, Who
> again summoned the people to the river of everlasting
> life (bih sharí`at-i qurb-i báqiyyih). [KI 9]

> In another sense, by the terms “sun”, “moon”, and
> “stars” are meant such laws and teachings as have been
> established and proclaimed in every Dispensation
> (sharí`at). [KI 38]

> ... this generation still waiteth in expectation of beholding
> the promised One who should uphold the Law of the
> Muhammadan Dispensation (sharí`at-i furqán). [KI 239]

> Hence, it is clear and manifest that by the words “the
> sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her
> light, and the stars shall fall from heaven” is intended
> the waywardness of the divines, and the annulment of
178                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> laws (a˙kám) firmly established by divine Revelation
> (sharí`at) ... [KI 41]

> Were men to meditate on these words which have
> flowed from the Pen of the Divine Ordainer, they
> would, one and all, hasten to embrace the truth of this
> God-given, and ever-enduring Revelation (bih sharí`at-i
> báqiyyih iláhiyyih), and would testify to that which He
> Himself hath solemnly affirmed. [GWB 82]

1b. Shará’i` — al-shará’i` — sharáyi` — plural of Sharí`ah. These
are other terms from the same root as sharí`ah and are
translated by Shoghi Effendi thus:

> These “clouds” signify, in one sense, the annulment of
> laws (a˙kám), the abrogation of former Dispensations
> (shará’i`), the repeal of rituals and customs (qawá’id va
> rusúm) current amongst men [KI 71-2]

> Aside from these things, before his partaking of the
> reviving waters of faith, he had been so wedded to the
> traditions (˙udúdát) of his forefathers, and so
> passionately devoted to the observance of their customs
> (ádáb) and laws (shará’i`), that he would have preferred
> to suffer death rather than violate one letter of those
> superstitious forms and manners (umúr taqlídiyyih)
> current amongst his people. [KI 155]

> In such a manner hath the Kitáb-i-Aqdas been revealed
> that it attracteth and embraceth all the divinely
> appointed Dispensations (sharáyi`). [Bahá’u’lláh in GPB 216]

> In all the Divine Dispensations (sharáyi`), the eldest son
> hath been given extraordinary distinctions. Even the
> station of prophethood hath been his birthright.

[Bahá’u’lláh in GPB 148]
Legal Terms in Bahá’í Scripture                                 179

> They clamored that He Whose advent the Bible had
> foretold must needs promulgate and fulfil the laws
> (sharáyi`) of Moses, whereas this youthful Nazarene,
> who laid claim to the station of the divine Messiah, had
> annulled the laws (˙ukm) of divorce and of the sabbath
> day ... [KI 18]

> ... and the dispensations of Thy providence have been
> promulgated (shari`at al-shará’i`) unto the followers of
> all religions. [PM 60]

1c. Shar`ah — This term is sometimes used as an alternative to
sharí`ah. Historically this and shar` were the original form of
the word used and Cantwell Smith has shown how the word
used moved from meaning an ethical obligation of Muslims to
follow the path set by God to meaning a legal obligation to act
in a certain way because that is what the sharí`ah says.

In Qur’an the word shar`atan occurs in 5:48:

> To each among you have we prescribed a law (shar`atan)
> and an open way (minhajan).
> Thou shouldst, moreover, arise to enforce the law of
> God amongst them, that thou mayest be of those who
> are firmly established in His law (shar`). [GWB 234]

> Among the utterances that foreshadow a new Law (shar`)
> and a new Revelation (amr) are the passages in the
> “Prayer of Nudbih” ... [KI 240]

> Did He not speak a different language, and reveal a
> different Law (shar`)? [KI 150]

1d. Shara`a — verb — to legislate, enact, also to go along a path

180                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Qur’an:

> He has ordained for you (shara`a lakum) of religion what
> He enjoined upon Noah ...
> We have, then, called into being (shára‘ná) a new
> creation, as a token of Our grace unto men. I am, verily,
> the All-Bountiful [GWB 29-30]

> Gather ye around that which We have prescribed
> (shára‘náhu) unto you ... [ESW 55]

1e. Tashrí‘ — legislation. This word does not appear in the
Qur’an.
> This House of Justice enacteth the laws (maßdar-i
> tashrí`st) and the government enforceth them. The
> legislative body (tashrí`) must reinforce the executive
> (tanfídh), the executive (tanfídh) must aid and assist the
> legislative body (tashrí`) so that through the close union
> and harmony of these two forces, the foundation of
> fairness and justice may become firm and strong [WT 14-
> 5]

2\. Óukm — (legal) judgement, decision, regulation, rule. Comes
from the same root as hákim — judge — thus signifies a
judgement as made by a judge (or by God as the Judge).

There are multiple occurrences of this word and its
derivatives in the Qur’an (e.g. 3:79, 5:43, 5:50, 6:57, 6:62, etc.).
Legal Terms in Bahá’í Scripture                                   181

> Thus hath the sun of My commandment (˙ukm) shone
> forth above the horizon of My utterance ... [Bahá’u’lláh in
> ADJ 33]

> Thus hath the decree (˙ukm) been irrevocably fixed by
> Him Who is the All-Wise. [Bahá’u’lláh in PDC 41]

> None of the many Prophets sent down, since Moses ...

ever altered the law (˙ukm) of the Qiblih. [KI 51]

2b. A˙kám — plural of ˙ukm

> A Youth from Bani-Hashim shall be made manifest,
> Who will reveal a new Book and promulgate a new law
> (a˙kám) ... [KI 241]

> ... and the annulment (naskh) of laws (a˙kám) firmly
> established by divine Revelation (sharí`at) ... [KI 41]

> ... they idly contend that the law (a˙kám) formerly
> revealed, must in no wise be altered. [KI 240]

> Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code
> of laws (al-a˙kám). [GWB 332]

3\. Námús — from Greek nomos = Latin lex — meaning law, rule,
honour. It is non-Quranic.

> O kings of the earth! The Most Great Law (al-námús al-
> akbar) hath been revealed in this Spot ... [KA 18]

> Love is the most great law (al-námús al-a`.zam) that
> ruleth this mighty and heavenly cycle ... [Writings of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 27]
182                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> Thine iniquity hath made Gabriel (al-námús al-akbar) to
> groan, and hath drawn tears from the Law of God
> (sharí`at Alláh) ... [ESW 81]

3b. Nawámís — plural of námús

> The animal is the captive of nature and cannot
> transgress the rules (qawánín) and laws thereof (nawámís
> tabí`at) ... all other beings, whether of the mineral, the
> vegetable or the animal world, cannot deviate from the
> laws of nature (nawámís tabí`at) ... [TAF 10]

4\. Qánún — plural qawánín — from the Greek — canon,
established principle, basic rule, towards the end of the 19th
century it was being used by secular reformers to indicate
secular law, e.g. in their argument that society should be run be
the rule of law rather than the whims of a despot. Bahá’u’lláh
rarely uses this word. It is non-Quranic.

> These principles (usúl) and laws (qawánín), these
> firmly-established and mighty systems, have proceeded
> from one Source, and are rays of one Light. [ESW 13]

> [N.B. In the Tablet to Dr. Forel ‘Abdu’l-Bahá frequently
> uses qánún-i tabi`at for laws of nature.]

Also qánún and words derived from it are used by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
for laws of the Universal House of Justice:

> And inasmuch as the House of Justice hath power to
> enact laws (qawánín) that are not expressly recorded in
> the Book and bear upon daily transactions (mu’ámilát),
> so also it hath power to repeal (násikh) the same. Thus
> for example, the House of Justice enacteth today a
Legal Terms in Bahá’í Scripture                                 183

> certain law (mas’ali’í qánúní) and enforceth it, and a
> hundred years hence, circumstances having profoundly
> changed and the conditions having altered, another
> House of Justice will then have power, according to the
> exigencies of the time, to alter that law (mas’alih
> qánúní). This it can do because that law formeth no part
> of the divine explicit text. The House of Justice is both
> the initiator and the abrogator of its own laws. [WT 20]

> It enacteth all ordinances (qawánín) and regulations
> (a˙kám) that are not to be found in the explicit Holy
> Text. [WT 14]

5\. Aßl — plural Ußúl — means root or trunk and therefore has
come to mean foundation, principles. Thus it means law in the
sense of foundational principles. There are three Quranic
occurrences of this word and its plural but only with the
meaning of root of a tree.

> ...these divines who are still doubtful of, and dispute
> about, the theological obscurities of their faith, yet
> claim to be the exponents of the subtleties of the law of
> God (ußúl iláhiyyih), and the expounders of the essential
> mysteries of His holy Word. [KI 83]

> It behoveth you, O Ministers of State, to keep the
> precepts of God (ußúl Alláh), and to forsake your own
> laws (ußúlikum) and regulations ... [GWB 123]

> Say: What! Cleave ye to your own devices (ußúlikum),
> and cast behind your backs the precepts of God (ußúl
> Alláh)? [GWB 124]

> Have ye clung unto the promptings of your nature (ußúl
> anfusikum), and cast behind your backs the statutes of
> God (ußúl Alláh)? [ESW 49]
184                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> If your rules and principles (ußúlikum) be founded on
> justice, why is it, then, that ye follow those which
> accord with your corrupt inclinations ... [GWB 124]

6\. Amr — plural awámir: commands, orders (- also Faith,
Cause); comes from the same root as amír, commander or ruler
and thus means law as that which issues from the ruler or king
(or from God as Ruler or King); also has a plural form umúr in
which case it has the meanings: affairs, matters. This word and
its derivatives occur numerous times in the Qur’an (e.g. 2:210,
3:128, 3:152, 3:154, etc.).

> Thus hath His ordinance (al-amr) been sent down from
> the Kingdom of Him Who is the Most Exalted, the
> All-Wise. [GWB 278]

> He Who is the Lord of Lords is come overshadowed
> with clouds, and the decree (al-amr) hath been fulfilled
> by God, the Almighty, the Unrestrained. [Bahá’u’lláh in PDC
> 31]

> This Book is a heaven which We have adorned with the
> stars of Our commandments (awámir) and prohibitions.

[Bahá’u’lláh in GPB 216]

> ... and enable him to remain a while in the island of
> Cyprus, and associate with Mirza Yahya, perchance he
> may become aware of the fundamentals of this Faith
> (aßl-i amr) and of the source of the Divine laws and
> commandments (maßdar-i awamir wa ahkám). [ESW 121]

> The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the
> recognition of Him Who is the Day Spring of His
> Revelation and the Fountain of His laws (ma†la` amrihi),
> who representeth the Godhead ... [GWB 330-31]

> The second is strict observance of the laws (awámir) He
> hath prescribed ... [GWB 290]

> Aid Thou His Majesty the Shah to execute Thy laws
> (awámirika) and Thy commandments (ahkámika) ... [ESW
> 139]

7\. Óadd — plural ˙udúd — this word signifies an edge,
boundary, or limit, and hence has come to mean ordinance,
legal punishment. It occurs in the Qur’an, where the plural is
used in the sense of the limits set by God (e.g. 2:187, 2:229).

> Reflect, how single-handed and alone they faced the
> world and all its peoples, and promulgated the Law of
> God (˙udúd Alláh)! [KI 45]

> They whom God hath endued with insight will readily
> recognize that the precepts laid down by God (˙udúd
> Alláh) constitute the highest means for the maintenance
> of order in the world and the security of its peoples.

[GWB 331]

> Respect ye the divines amongst you, They whose acts
> conform to the knowledge they possess, who observe
> the statutes of God (˙udúd Alláh), and decree the things
> God hath decreed in the Book. [Bahá’u’lláh in PDC 111]

> Say: O people be obedient to the ordinances of God
> (˙udúd Alláh), which have been enjoined in the Bayan by
> the Glorious, the Wise One. [Tablet of Ahmad]

> Lay not aside the fear of God, O kings of the earth, and
> beware that ye transgress not the bounds which the
> Almighty hath fixed (˙udúd Alláh). [GWB 250]
186                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

8\. Sunnah — plural sunan — customary practice or procedure;
came to mean in Islam the practice of the Prophet Muhammad
— hence Sunni Muslims are those who follow the practice
(sunna) of the Prophet. It is non-Quranic.

> Ponder in thine heart the revelation of the Soul of God
> that pervadeth all His Laws (al-sunan) ... [GWB 160]

> Empower me, then, O my God, to be reckoned among
> them that have clung to Thy laws (sunanika) and
> precepts (˙udúdátika) for the sake of Thee ... [PM 299]

9\. Far∂ — plural fará’i∂ — duty, obligation, ordinances. This
word and its derivates occur in the Qur’an (e.g. 2:197, 28:85,
33:38, etc.)
Shoghi Effendi’s translation:

> Where is He Who is preserved to renew the ordinances
> and laws (al-fará’i∂ wa al-sunan)? [KI 240]

It could be argued that this last one, far∂, should not appear
on the list as it appears to translate “ordinances” rather than
“laws”. If one to exclude far∂ and also to count shar` and
sharí`ah as one, since they are from the same root, then the list
is eight long. If one include either it become nine and if one
includes both it becomes ten.

Legal Terms in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas

In the second part of this presentation, we will carry out the
mirror of the above analysis and look at the cluster of words in
English which we have found above to be associated with the
word “law” in Shoghi Effendi’s translations (law,
commandment, ordinance, statutes, precepts) and see what

words in the Arabic text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (including
Questions and Answers) have been translated by these terms.

1a. Law

> 81. O kings of the earth! The Most Great Law (al-námús
> al-akbar) hath been revealed in this Spot, this scene of
> transcendent splendour.

> 98. Various petitions have come before Our throne from
> the believers, concerning laws (no word) from God, the
> Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of all worlds.
> We have, in consequence, revealed this Holy Tablet and
> arrayed it with the mantle of His Law (al-amr) that haply
> the people may keep the commandments (a˙kám) of their
> Lord.

> 10. ANSWER: All are charged with obedience to the
> Kitáb-i-Aqdas; whatsoever is revealed therein is the Law
> of God (˙ukm iláhí) amid His servants. The injunction on
> pilgrims to the sacred House to shave the head hath been
> lifted.

> 31. QUESTION: Concerning the sacred verse: “The Lord
> hath prohibited ... the practice to which ye formerly had
> recourse when thrice ye had divorced a woman.”

> ANSWER: The reference is to the law (˙ukm) which
> previously made it necessary for another man to marry
> such a woman before she could again be wedded to her
> former husband ...

> 76. QUESTION: Concerning observance of the Fast by
> people engaged in hard labour during the month of
> fasting.

> ANSWER: Such people are excused from fasting; however,
> in order to show respect to the law of God (˙ukm Alláh)

> and for the exalted station of the Fast, it is most com-
> mendable and fitting to eat with frugality and in private.

> 100. ... In this regard, a law (˙ukmí) was revealed in the

> Q&A 106: exalted station. Well is it with him who in the

1b. Laws

> what He pleaseth. He chooseth ...

> 7. ... Whoso hath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the

> transgress them not at the prompting of your base and
> selfish desires.

> 45. ... We school you with the rod of wisdom and laws
> (al-a˙kám), like unto the father who educateth his son,
> and this for naught but the protection of your own selves
> and the elevation of your stations.

> 45. ... By My life, were ye to discover what We have
> desired for you in revealing Our holy laws (awámiriná al-
> muqaddasah), ye would offer up your very souls for this
> sacred, this mighty, and most exalted Faith.

> 96. O Most Mighty Ocean! Sprinkle upon the nations

> 120. ... Thus have We exhorted you in most of Our
> Epistles and now in this, Our Holy Tablet, above which
> hath beamed the Day-Star of the Laws (a˙kám) of the
> Lord, your God, the Powerful, the All-Wise.

> 142. Verily, He revealed certain laws (al-a˙kám) so that,
> in this Dispensation, the Pen of the Most High might
> have no need to move in aught but the glorification of His

Conclusion

Shoghi Effendi does not seem to have maintained any pattern
in his translation of the words associated with “law”. He does
not seem to have distinguished any nuances of meaning in the 8-
10 Arabic/Persian words that occur in Bahá’í scripture and have
been translated by him as “law” or other equivalent terms. Nor
indeed does he consistently use such terms as “ordinance”,
“commandment”, “statute” or “precept” to designate any
particular Arabic/Persian word. He appears to have relied on
his literary sensibilities in choosing which words to use when
translating this range of words in Arabic/Persian to a parallel
range of words in English.
