CHAPTER 15

Baha’ism: Some Uncertainties about
its Role as a Globalizing Religion
Towards a Deﬁnition (of sorts) of Globalization
I must assume that anyone reading this has a reasonably good idea
of what Baha’ism stands for as a religion and as a social movement
with as yet unrealized political ambitions. Globalization, on the other
hand, is a widespread term with numerous interpretations. I hesitate
to offer a deﬁnition of the latter to readers of this collection, many of
whom are experts in that very topic. But I ought, at least, to clarify
my personal views on the subject, and to specify some of the political
and religious attitudes that seem to me to contradict it.

Globalization is a politico-economic process that has been gathering
pace since the Second World War and the end of empires (America
excepted). Conspiracy theorists apart, few would suggest that there
is a centrally-organized ‘globalization plan’ or pre-conceived goals of
any kind, even if globalization works towards such goals on a local
or corporate scale. It proceeds through developments in technology,
through free trade between nations, through the dissemination of
science and information, through exercises in religious ecumenism,
and through philosophical explorations of what encounters between
nations, races, and religions may involve.

Its greatest expression to date must surely be the Internet, with its
extraordinary ability to shrink distances and eliminate borders at the
tap of a computer key. Ten years ago, searching for a rare book was
a time-consuming activity that could take years. Now, however, one

288                                                          Denis MacEoin

can search for a volume in seconds through websites that provide
access to bookshops around the planet. From my study in the UK, I
regularly order books from France, America, and Australia, and I can
now buy recordings of Portuguese fado music from a Portuguese shop
in Frankfurt, or sencha tea from several places in Japan.

Spaces close, not always with the best result. On the downside,
globalization tends to homogenize cultures or to impose a variety of
Western culture on non-western people or American culture on every-
body else, including the French. Trade is eased, often with serious
consequences for local producers or those employed in sweatshops
by multinational companies. Cheap air fuel (kept that way by low
taxation) means that it’s cheaper to ﬂy cherries in from Chile instead
of transporting them by road from the farm just outside town directly
to the supermarket.

In the religious sphere, globalization sets an ideal of harmony and
cooperation, at the price of blurring important distinctions between
belief systems. Inter-religious harmony is, in any case, a frail thing
cultivated by people with irenic temperaments. The reality of religious
behavior is still, in many ways, Catholic versus Protestant in Northern
Ireland,1 Hindu mobs in India, Islamic mobs in Kashmir, Jew versus
Muslim in the Middle East, right-wing American fundamentalism
spoiling for a ﬁght with Islam, and Muslims on several continents
contra mundum.

Globalization and Scientiﬁc Values
There is a link between globalization and science that is crucial and
exciting. The virtues of science are neutrality, objectivity, and secular-
ity. Just as there cannot be ‘Jewish science’, ‘Muslim science’, ‘Hindu
science’, and so on, so there cannot be American globalization, British
globalization, conservative globalization, or liberal globalization, and
so on.

By its very nature, a globalized outlook threatens parochial inter-
ests and outlooks. Irish by birth, when I watch a French ﬁlm or read
a Persian poem or listen in awe to Cristina Branco sing Aquele Tao

Triste Dia or marvel at a piece of Arabic calligraphy — in all of these
undertakings I transcend the ‘Orangeism’, the ‘meat and two veg’, the
‘Kick the Pope’ songs, and the constant bigotry of my Northern Irish
origins. I am not alone.

The most important resistant culture and religion is that of Islam.

Of course there are similar strains in Haredi Judaism, in militant Hin-
duism, in the German sects of North America, and in the Paisleyite
variety of Protestantism. But Islam has stolen the stage, not only in
its terrorist-militant forms, but even in most of its moderate incarna-
tions. Although Islam is far from homogeneous, having two important
divisions: Shi‘i and Sunni, Suﬁ and non-Suﬁ; and more graduated
variations between regional styles, it remains visibly less sectarian
than any other religion of its size, with idealizing and universalizing
pressures that reduce the impact of the divisions. Many Suﬁ brother-
hoods have been and are highly shari‘a-minded, many mystics have
taken part in or led holy wars, the four Sunni law schools differ on
minor points only, and Shi‘is and Sunnis agree on more things than
they fall out over.

Today, only a minority of Muslims are terrorists, but larger num-
bers will support the jihad-based struggle of the minority, while even
larger numbers will condemn terrorism outright while agreeing with
classical formulations regarding holy war, the priority of Islam, or the
sacredness of martyrdom. It can never be accurate to say ‘Muslims do
this’ or ‘Muslims believe that’; but with some degree of caution it is
easier to generalize about the Islamic world than most other religious
congregations.

Muslim insistence on denying a fullness of human rights to women
and religious minorities, the persistence of practices like female genital
mutilation and honour killing, or the extraordinary continuance of a
vicious anti-Semitism at most levels of society, in the popular press,
on radio and television, even in school textbooks are all indications of
a culture that has distanced and continues to distance itself from some
of the most basic demands of a globalized society. Those Muslims most
likely to embrace globalization and its consequences wholeheartedly
will inevitably be partly or wholly secularized. It is secularization
that provides the real test of openness to global values, not relatively
insigniﬁcant distinctions of style between Cairo and Qum.

I think it is not untrue to say that any Muslim, if asked, would wel-
come the dissolution of the state of Israel and its replacement with a

290                                                         Denis MacEoin

Muslim Palestinian state. Some might seek the physical destruction of
Israeli Jews, others might accept them as dhimmis under Islamic law,
yet others might seek to exile them to any country that would have
them. The thing is that the underlying desire to see Israel gone and
Islam resurgent has a powerful inﬂuence on politics throughout the
Muslim world, and this in turn makes Muslim involvement in global
issues harder than it might be.

Baha’ism and Islam
Having said all this by way of preamble, let us return to the Baha’is.

What, the informed reader may wonder, has Islam to do with this?

I had been tempted to make my title read: ‘a post-Islamic response’,
but a moment’s thought told me that we are deﬁnitely not living in
a post-Islamic world, much as George Bush and his advisers might
like to think so. The Baha’i faith, of course, is manifestly not a sect or
school of Islam, and you will not ﬁnd me arguing that. Baha’is do think
of themselves as post-Islamic (and post-Christian, post-Buddhist, and
so on), but that should not carry so much weight with the rest of us.

Although it has broken from Islam and offers a post-Islamic rev-
elation, it is important to remember that Baha’ism does carry a heavy
weight of Islamic inﬂuence, such that any intelligent examination of
its position among other cultures must take account of this. Just as
we can talk without contradiction of Judaeo-Christian this and that,
so we can, I think, speak accurately about Islamo-Baha’i theology
and theophanology, Islamo-Baha’i legalism, Islamo-Baha’i ritualism,
Islamo-Baha’i morality, and so on.

A notable feature that Baha’ism shares with other New Religious
Movements, and that distinguishes it fundamentally from major world
religions, is the absence of any real polarity between Great and Little
Traditions within the religion. It would be unrealistic to expect one so
soon. But it would also be reckless to anticipate such a development
as inevitable. In spite of their best efforts, the Baha’is have so far failed
to develop either local cultures or a single universal one. What traces,
if any, of a culture that do exist are manifestly too weak to provide
a real identity for the religion, and as yet much too undeveloped to
exercise a perceptible inﬂuence on local cultures, let alone on those of
international stature. There is, for the present, no distinct Baha’i art,

Baha’ism: Some Uncertainties about its Role as a Globalizing Religion 291

no Baha’i music, no Baha’i architecture,2 no Baha’i literature (by which
I mean, for example, poetry, belles lettres, and even ﬁction), no Baha’i
cinema, no Baha’i cuisine, no Baha’i humour, and so on. It could take
another century, and probably more, before such cultural expressions
begin to emerge, if they do at all. More probably, by that time a global
culture will have taken hold that will encourage Baha’i poets to write,
composers to compose, or painters to paint in that context, rather than
searching for a more limited form of religiously-deﬁned expression.

But to anyone familiar with the movement, the absence of a distinct
culture does not mean that Baha’ism has no ﬂavour, that it is ersatz,
that its books and rituals and doctrines are the blank products of
unformed minds. What we actually ﬁnd is a young religious tradi-
tion rich in Islamic cultural and religious referents, whose doctrinal,
legal, and ritual core is colored throughout by ‘Islamicity’, if I may
use such a clumsy term. Alongside this wealth of themes, symbols,
rituals, mystical styles, and much else from Islamicate culture, there is
an overwhelming sense of the abiding presence of Persian inﬂuence,
from the literary style of the scriptures (even where written in Arabic),3
to the design of book jackets, to the use of Persian chant in devotions,
to the hanging of the Ya Baha’ al-Abha calligraphic symbol on walls,
to the availability of Persian food, to the physical and psychological
presence of Iranian Baha’is in most Baha’i communities.

Because an assertion of independence from Islam has been of such
importance to Baha’is almost from the inception of the movement
(though, as is widely known), Abbas Effendi continued to attend the
mosque until his death), there has been an understandable tendency

for members to exaggerate the originality of everything from laws to
common practices.

The ‘External Inﬂuence’ versus ‘Divine Inspiration/Innate Knowl-
edge’ Debate
More recently, a debate has developed between liberal Baha’i scholars
like Juan Cole on the one hand, and what I would term fundamental-
ists like Nader Saeidi and many others on the other. The former have
propounded a scenario that puts the Bab, Baha’ Allah and ‘Abd al-
Baha’ deep within their cultural environment, and have identiﬁed a
range of possible inﬂuences on their thinking, from Islamic mysticism
to Western republicanism. The latter, arguing that all three ﬁgures
were, in two distinct measures, divinely inspired from the moment
they ﬁrst took breath, deny any possibility of the slightest inﬂuence on
their thought from any quarter whatever, other than God himself.

It’s not my purpose here to enter into that debate, other than to say
I ﬁnd myself wholly on the side of the liberals, and that I ﬁnd noth-
ing in the Baha’i scriptures that cannot be ascribed to existing norms.
This may seem like a minor internal debate, but the truth is that it has
enormous signiﬁcance for understanding the relationship between
Baha’ism and the wider culture.

Because everything the Bab and his successors did or said is deemed
to have come from their innate knowledge (‘ilm-i laduni, an old Suﬁ
term), it follows that all new ideas in Babism or Baha’ism must be
treated as though wholly original, as though brought into the world
tabula rasa from the mouth of the twin prophets. This creates an extraor-
dinary ahistoricism, whereby all earlier examples of the phenomenon
in question are simply ignored.

Thus, for example, the principle of the equality of men and women
was enunciated by Baha’ Allah, but not by the Bab. Despite that, or-
thodox Baha’is will attribute this same teaching to the Babi poetess
Fatima Baraghani Qurrat al-‘Ayn. My most strenuous researches have
failed to reveal the slightest mention of this subject in Qurrat al-‘Ayn’s
extant writings, and I doubt very much whether she gave the matter
much thought. Certainly, I would not count her as an active promoter
of women’s rights, much less as the ﬁrst woman in the world to adopt
such a position.

It is quite understandable that earlier generations of Baha’is, lacking
Baha’ism: Some Uncertainties about its Role as a Globalizing Religion 293

hard information about feminism in history, may have granted Qurrat
al-‘Ayn a primacy that was ill-justiﬁed. That they persist in doing so
is less easy to comprehend. The historical position is clear. Open writ-
ing and debate about women’s position in society, including detailed
demands for equality between the sexes began in England and France
from the fourteenth century and reached remarkable proportions by
the late 16th.4 By the time of Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797), the rights
of women were ﬁrmly on the agenda for women in Europe and North
America.

Baha’i insistence here and in many other areas on Baha’ Allah’s
primacy is inconsistent with a worldview that recognizes the achieve-
ments of other cultures and religions. It resembles the old Soviet trick
of claiming primacy for almost all modern inventions for Russia. Surely
it should be enough that the Baha’is support the principle of male and
female equality, without making a song and dance about a historically
indefensible primacy.

Let me put all this in a somewhat different form. The Bab and
Baha’ Allah were never inﬂuenced through the whole range of their
religion-making activities by the Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, Shinto-
ist, Amerindian, African, Protestant, Confucian, Tibetan, Santerian, or
any other signiﬁcant religious tradition. Though that may sound like
stating the obvious, the absence of any coloring from such sources is
extremely relevant in the context of globalization. Quite simply, po-
tential converts from those and many other traditions will see nothing
familiar in Baha’ism on their ﬁrst contact with it, but will instead be
asked to take on board a host of ideas and acts of worship or personal
routine saturated with Iranian, Arab, Suﬁ, Shi‘i, Islamo-Christian and
related norms. It’s a one-way street, in other words.

By way of contrast, individuals from an Iranian, Shi‘i, or Sunni
Muslim background will have no difﬁculty in recognizing, say, the
Baha’i hajj, or the practices of ziyara, salat, or sawm as cognates of

Islamic ritual practices, even if the forms differ; they will feel at ease
both with the style of Baha’i historical narrative, and with much of
the content; they will recognize theological concepts such as tawhid
(the divine unity), progressive revelation, and even the Manifestation
of God (which has exact cognates in some Shi‘i literature); they will
ﬁnd photographs of early Babis and Baha’is resonant with images of
their own grandparents; they will ﬁnd that the original scriptures are
in languages they will understand or at least partly recognize; they
will ﬁnd some Baha’i imagery (such as the ya baha’ al-abha symbol, the
ringstone symbol, and the ﬁve-pointed star) essentially familiar; they
will ﬁnd the names of historical ﬁgures familiar and pronounceable;
they will feel at ease with the style of chanting used in devotions; they
will ﬁnd ‘Abd al-Baha’s insistence that women wear headscarves un-
surprising; they will have no problems with the ban on alcohol; they
will have no difﬁculties with the extensive use of Quranic and hadith
quotations in scripture; they will not be ill at ease with the use of Al-
lahu abha as a greeting. I could go on, but I think the point has been
made.

But how would a Scottish Presbyterian, say, or a Tibetan Buddhist
or a Vodoun priestess or a Mormon elder react to all the above?
Everything I have just mentioned will be unfamiliar, alienating, and
often downright mysterious. There is no comfortable link between
the Isle of Lewis and City of Shiraz, or between the Potola and the
mansion of Bahji.

Oddly enough, the community that would ﬁnd Baha’ism most fa-
miliar — Islam — displays the most negative reaction in fact, whereas
a community without common referents (Hinduism) has proved a
major source of converts.

Does Cultural Connectivity Matter?
Baha’is may say that none of this matters, because the main features
of their religion revolve around matters like world government, world
peace, and world brotherhood, or the administrative order, or in-
ternational development. There’s some truth in that, but I am not
convinced that the Baha’i faith can travel so far from its roots as to
become genuinely culture-free at heart. Matters like theology, the law,
ritual, and sacred history are far more important in deﬁning a religion
than, say, involvement with the UN or advocating a world language

Baha’ism: Some Uncertainties about its Role as a Globalizing Religion 295

or promoting racial harmony, activities which are common to many
other religions and secular bodies.

At this point, I feel I am only scratching the surface of the problem.

Practising Baha’is, at least those who aspire to some serious knowledge
of their origins and beliefs, will say that they do not feel alienated
by these elements of their faith. But many Western Baha’is ﬁnd long
Persian names, or historical accounts set in the alien world of 19th-cen-
tury Iran, or even Shoghi Effendi’s impossibly long periods difﬁcult
to read and digest. Converts from Christianity frequently ﬁnd the
Islamic-style legalism hard to link with earlier beliefs in the primacy
of conscience.

Perhaps that does not matter, and perhaps it doesn’t matter today
how little new converts among tribespeople and other marginalized
groups may understand these things.

But the children and grandchildren of these converts are, presum-
ably, going to receive a more thoroughgoing Baha’i education, and we
must assume that that will alienate them to some degree from their
own traditions and belief systems. Indeed, such a process has to hap-
pen if Baha’ism is not to suffer the fate of so many earlier faiths and
ﬁnd itself overgrown by a congeries of beliefs and practices alien to
its original nature. In fact, there appears to be a genuine disapproval
of ‘Little Tradition’ features that ‘corrupt’ the ‘pure’ Baha’i teachings
and prescribed practices.5 Newly-converted tribes are put through
‘deepening classes’, the purpose of which is to acculturate them to
Baha’i ways of thinking and doing.

And this is roughly where my worries centre. To speak of Baha’ism
as a global religion and yet pursue a conversion and educational pro-
cess which allows one culture (i.e. Baha’i/Islamic/Persianate culture) to
dominate seems to me contradictory. Although ofﬁcial Baha’i teaching
emphasizes a need for ‘unity in diversity’, one is often struck by an
overriding stress on the unity side of the equation. This is because
fear of sectarian division has led Baha’is to be cautious of words and
behavior that might compromise the integrity of the gemeinschaft. Any
attempt to introduce, say, Hindu prayers into Baha’i worship might
be deemed contrary to strict orthodoxy.

5   On this, see Denis MacEoin (1994).

The Oneness of Religion
Baha’is preach their belief in the oneness of religion. But what does this
really mean? In practice, it means something very similar to the Islamic
belief (from which it is obviously derived) that there has only ever been
one heavenly religion, and that it has been manifested historically by
Judaism, Sabeanism, Christianity, and now Islam, or by prophets like
Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. The Islamic doctrine of the oneness
of the heavenly religions had a side-effect of rendering Judaism and
Christianity betrayed and corrupted faiths that had to be infantilized
into ‘protected peoples’. All others were out of the game entirely.

The Baha’i faith widens this a little, by artiﬁcially incorporating
Buddhism and Hinduism as divine religions, while stripping both of
them of everything that makes them ‘Buddhism’ or ‘Hinduism’. There
is no scriptural indication that other faiths (Sikhism, Jainism, Shinto-
ism, Maori religion, the new Japanese religions, African religions,
Mormonism, Candoblé, Vodoun and so forth, together with the in-
numerable sectarian variations in them and in the larger faiths) have
any value whatever. Standard Baha’i texts on progressive revelation or
world faiths simply ignore them.6 They are certainly not considered
by Baha’is to be divinely revealed, nor are their founders (where one
exists) considered Manifestations of God.

This in itself means that, as far as a large proportion of mankind
is concerned, the only possible interaction with Baha’ism is either to
convert or to remain resistant. Neither seems appropriate in a global-
ization context.

Baha’i Dogmatism
But this is not all. Like Islam, Baha’ism is a dogmatic religion. Very
clear lines are drawn between truth and falsehood (‘This, verily, is the
truth, and all else naught but error’, Baha’ Allah).7 This means, for
example, that Christian belief in the Trinity, in the status of Christ as
God incarnate, in the resurrection of Jesus, in the divine origin of the

6   One exception is Amerindian religion, which is credited with a chain of

oral prophecies believed to foretell the advent of Baha’ism.
7 Baha’ Allah (1956) Lawh al-malika, in Gleanings from the Writings of Baha’u’llah,

trans. Shoghi Effendi: 255.

Church and the liturgy, in the status of Mary as Mother of God, in the
intermediary role of the priesthood, in the salviﬁc power of confes-
sion and the forgiveness of sins, in the intercession of the saints, in the
resurrection of the dead, in the infallibility of the Pope, in the efﬁcacy
of the sacraments, and so much else that is absolutely fundamental
to all Catholics (other lists could be made for other churches) are all
regarded as errors or worse by Baha’is.

Similarly, the absence of a Buddhist belief in God is not only con-
sidered false, but is subject to extreme revisionism, as in the Baha’i
book by Jamshid Fozdar, The God of Buddha.8

It is hard to see how this essentially intolerant attitude can hope
to further the aims of globalization, in which no one culture or set of
beliefs should be allowed to dominate. Baha’is have for a long time
claimed that their faith is a strong force in bringing together dispa-
rate religious traditions. But we have only to look at the content of
Baha’i-managed World Religion Day events to see them as ham-ﬁsted
attempts to declare all previous religions as precursors of Baha’ism,
all conforming to basic ideals of one God, a succession of prophets,
one true faith from Adam to Baha’ Allah, and so on.

This divisive approach is accentuated by the intensity of the Baha’i
international missionary effort, an endeavour that has for many de-
cades now dominated Baha’i activities in all continents. Baha’is do
not set out to bring religions closer in an ecumenical manner, but
rather seek to convert Hindus to Baha’is, Buddhists to Baha’is, and
even Northern Irish Protestants to Baha’is. Positively understood,
globalization is not about proselytizing, but about mutual respect,
tolerance, and an abandonment of earlier beliefs about one religion’s
superiority over another.

In its favour, it is worth remembering that Baha’ism has broken
from Islam in a number of important areas. It has abolished jihad, it no
longer punishes apostasy,9 and it contains strict rules for the tolerant
treatment of religious minorities of all kinds, whether ‘People of the
Book’ or not. But the urge to convert and to establish Baha’i states and
an eventual ‘Baha’i World State’ rather undermine what might have
been an important ecumenical role for the faith.

8   Fozdar, Jamshid K. (1973).
9   It does, of course, punish dissidence (‘covenant-breaking’) by total excom-

munication.

Globalization and Secularization
Let’s leave the purely religious aspect for the moment, and take a
look at some other aspects of Baha’ism that may create problems for
a serious Baha’i role within a broader globalization process. It is, I
think, axiomatic that healthy globalization must involve the spread
of democratic forms of government, a monitored attachment to hu-
man rights, and — more controversially — a gradual secularization
of societies across the globe.

Though much criticized in some quarters today, secularization has
for some time now been seen as a prerequisite of democracy, liberaliza-
tion and socio-economic progress. I would not be the ﬁrst to suggest
that nothing would further the peace progress in my native Ireland
more than a massive injection of secular values on both sides. Cer-
tainly, the development of democracy and human rights legislation
has been markedly more positive in mainly secularized countries,
such as those in Europe, than in the Islamic world or other religiously
determined societies.

Even though the simple secularization thesis has been abandoned
in the face of a wave of determined religious revivalism, there seems
to be no evidence that religions can work easily with modernization,
other than in mechanical, technological ways. Ideological aspects of
modernity, such as women’s rights or the rights of the individual to
freedom of conscience and expression (including the right to change
one’s religion and to dissent), tend to meet with resistance in the
religious realm, particularly from Islam, where apostasy is, strictly
speaking, punishable by death, and simple questioning as often as
not equated with apostasy.

I have said before that, like Islam, Baha’ism is, by its very nature,
a dogmatic religion. I’m not saying that that is, in itself, a bad thing
to be. Many people seek precisely the sort of security and certainty
that such a religion can bring. But their certainty in dogmas may be
bought at a high price for their fellow citizens.

Dogmatism is particularly visible in the system of Baha’i law, the
shari‘a, based on Islamic norms but in this case sent down from heaven
by Baha’ Allah. Baha’i behaviour in most things can be determined
from the Kitab al-aqdas and related texts, and in future fresh laws and
rulings are expected to be delivered (under divine inspiration) by the
Universal House of Justice.

Although the Baha’i shari‘a is, as yet, far from as detailed as its Is-
lamic model, or, for that matter, its eccentric precursor, the Babi shari‘a,
it does contain injunctions that ensure the Baha’is will be unable to
modify their stance on certain issues, much as modern Muslims have
resisted social change through a reluctance to alter or even reinterpret
their own legal code.

Two matters may bring Baha’is into increasing dissonance with lib-
eral social opinion in the West, particularly in Europe. One is approval
of capital punishment, including its use in cases of arson (where the
perpetrator may be burned to death), the other, famously, is prohib-
ition of active homosexuality. Europeans (and a considerable number
of Americans) have come to regard capital punishment with abhor-
rence, and opposition to it has come to be identiﬁed with a sense of
compassion and justice that is socially more adult than the baser mo-
tives of revenge that surround executions.

Acceptance of homosexuals as worthy fellow citizens has come to
symbolize respect for our fellows and the vital importance of tolerance
in all parts of the social sphere.

To become identiﬁed with intolerance while preaching the abolition
of prejudice may do the Baha’is harm in precisely those social contexts
that may be most supportive of the positive aspects of globalization.
A religion that tells men how long they may grow their hair, or that
even provides detailed directions on how to eat (as laid down in Baha’
Allah’s Lawh al-tibb) is likely to fall out of favor with a majority of
independent-minded people in the West, and with growing numbers
of people in developing countries who are only now learning how to
break away from their own stultifying traditions and petty injunc-
tions.

Religion and Secular Norms
This almost certainly means that, whatever role religion may play
in the globalization process, it is always likely to be out of step with
secular achievements. Here are some examples: the refusal of the Ira-
nian government to recognize Baha’is, Hindus, Buddhists and others
as citizens, or to accord Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians full legal
rights; the illegality of preaching or converting to non-Muslim faiths
within Islamic countries; the blatant intolerance displayed towards all
non-Muslim faiths by Saudi Arabia; the persistence of caste divisions

in India; the opposition until recently of both the Russian and Greek
Orthodox churches to the legal recognition of Catholicism, Judaism,
and other faiths; the insistence by the Afghan Taliban that Hindu cit-
izens wear badges indicating their faith; the long-standing interference
in politics by the American Christian right; the imposition of shari’a
law on animists in southern Sudan; the concealed involvement of the
Uniﬁcation Church in the restore Nixon campaign; the role of the
Dutch Reformed Church in promoting and justifying apartheid; the be-
lated acceptance of black converts by the Mormon church; the support
given to the Ceaucescu régime by the Romanian Orthodox Church,
and obstacles created for young members to join the pro-democracy
movement; the banning of various religious movements by the state
of Brunei, which actively promotes Islam; the close involvement in
right-wing politics, high ﬁnance, and academia of the Catholic order
Opus Dei, especially in Spain; the insistence of several religious groups
in the United Kingdom on the right to provide their children with
separate education to that of the majority, an attitude long established
in Northern Ireland, which is nobody’s model for a healthy democracy
capable of taking part in the globalization process; and so on.

All of the above, tedious as it may be, is only part of a broad pic-
ture that shows most religions to have a reactionary and intolerant
side which often dominates, and to be quite incapable of providing a
secure basis for democratic processes and the rule of law in keeping
with the International Declaration of Human Rights. It is because of
this that secularists like myself are forced to conclude that the only
healthy way forward is through a thoroughgoing secularization that
keeps the hands of priests and ulama off areas like freedom of thought
and the right to dissent.

Baha’ism, by way of contrast, sees no true globalization, no true
international unity, other than by means of religious forces. And, most
importantly, it sees those religious forces as inhering exclusively within
itself.

The Promised Day is Come
To understand this (and what is to come) correctly, one has to read
Shoghi Effendi’s 1941 treatise, The Promised Day is Come and related
texts, from which I can only quote very selectively here.

The main thrusts of this central text are, ﬁrst, that the Bab and Baha’
Allah have come to usher in the Day promised in all the holy books;
secondly, that both prophets suffered terribly at the hands of clergy
and rulers alike; thirdly, that all religions, but Islam and Christianity
in particular, have gone into rapid and permanent decline as retribu-
tion for their rejection of these two ﬁgures, so prominently preﬁgured
in their scriptures; and, lastly, that the future of humanity is glorious
and will culminate in a global world political system provided by the
Baha’i faith and the emergence of one world religion (which obviously
is not going to be Islam, Christianity, or Hinduism).

In other words, all the events of the past one hundred and ﬁfty
years or so have been set in motion by the appearance in the world of
the Baha’i revelation. Even secular events like wars and revolutions
ultimately owe their appearance to the earlier emergence of Baha’ism
and its rejection by the forces of ignorance, bigotry, and arrogance.

The ‘Decline’ in Religious Inﬂuence
Shoghi Effendi expresses the decline in religious inﬂuence throughout
the text, as in the following declaration:

The decline in the fortunes of the crowned wielders of temporal power has
been paralleled by a no less startling deterioration in the inﬂuence exercised
by the world’s spiritual leaders. The colossal events that have heralded the
dissolution of so many kingdoms and empires have almost synchronized with
the crumbling of the seemingly inviolable strongholds of religious orthodoxy.
That same process which, swiftly and tragically, sealed the doom of kings and
emperors, and extinguished their dynasties, has operated in the case of the
ecclesiastical leaders of both Christianity and Islam, damaging their prestige,
and, in some cases, overthrowing their highest institutions. (Shoghi Effendi,
1941: 71)

With regard to Islam, he says:

The dissolution of the institution of the Caliphate, the complete secularization
of the state which had enshrined the most august institution of Islam, and the
virtual collapse of the Shi’ih hierarchy in Persia, were the visible and immedi-
ate consequences of the treatment meted out to the Cause of God by the clergy
of the two largest communions of the Muslim world. (ibid.: 86)

This message is hammered home in numerous other passages too long
to quote here. Christianity is treated in much the same way:

Indeed, ever since the Divine summons was issued, and the invitation extended,
and the warning sounded, and the condemnation pronounced, this process, that
may be said to have been initiated with the collapse of the temporal sovereignty
of the Roman Pontiff, soon after the Tablet to the Pope had been revealed, has
been operating with increasing momentum, menacing the very basis on which
the entire order is resting. Aided by the forces which the Communist movement
has unloosed, reinforced by the political consequences of the last war, acceler-
ated by the excessive, the blind, the intolerant, and militant nationalism which
is now convulsing the nations, and stimulated by the rising tide of materialism,
irreligion, and paganism, this process is not only tending to subvert ecclesiasti-
cal institutions, but appears to be leading to the rapid dechristianization of the
masses in many Christian countries. (ibid.: 99)

Whether Shoghi Effendi will one day be proved right, and we will
see the utter decline of all religions save Baha’ism, it is not for me to
argue. What is more interesting here is his almost inadvertent support
for secularization (as in the ‘rapid dechristianization of the masses in
many Christian countries’ mentioned above). In some of his letters
from around the 1930s and 40s, he speaks with great approval of the
secularizing policies of Reza Shah in Iran. The more the Pahlavi regime
tried to reduce the inﬂuence of Islam, the more Shoghi gave it his
backing. He writes more than once of the beneﬁts this situation gave
to the previously persecuted Baha’i community. And many Baha’is,
with their Western education (acquired abroad or in Baha’i schools),
their ability to act as entrepreneurs outside the narrow conﬁnes of
the Bazaar, their international contacts, their attraction to subjects like
science, engineering, medicine, or architecture, acted as important
conduits for the secularizing process.

Perversely, both Shoghi Effendi and subsequent conservative Baha’i
writers in Persian and English have shown themselves to be stridently
anti-secular, to the point where their fulminations could comfortably
be exchanged with those of their fundamentalist Christian cousins.
What they see as a decline in public morality, a breakdown in law and
order, and the spread of individualism and excessive personal freedom
chimes perfectly with the main concerns of right-wing Christian and
Muslim writers.

Many of these Baha’i thinkers are particularly exercised by the
thought that modern men and women are given the freedom to make
their own decisions on issues like morality. The Baha’i preference is
for a society governed by divine law and instruction, for the only true
freedom lies in absolute and unquestioning obedience to the Law of
God and its elevation above the human intellect and conscience.

This can be carried to ridiculous lengths, as in the ruling that couples
seeking to marry should ﬁrst obtain the consent of all living parents,
even if the couple be in their forties or ﬁfties and parents themselves.
That is a barely-concealed method of guaranteeing arranged marriages
for almost everyone.

This distaste for the freedoms, rights, and responsibilities that make
up secular society sometimes results in blatant contradictions. For ex-
ample, Udo Schaefer, a major advocate of ‘the Law above all’ approach
to social relations writes that’ ‘most people’ are at present inclined to
the idea of a concrete, apodictic religious law with its absolute, non-
questionable, obligatory nature as much as the devil loves holy water’.
Later, he actually quotes with approval part of an interview with a
French sociologist who speaks of the way in which young people in
Europe have abandoned organized religion.10

Considering that Shoghi Effendi and other Baha’i writers have
thought that the abandonment of the established churches was a sign
of God’s hand at work in society, punishing the detractors of the Baha’i
faith, and clearing the way for its coming triumph over the religions
of the past – it seems odd that Schaefer should regret the spread of
secular values so much.

Shoghi Effendi got his prophecies badly wrong when he predicted
the ongoing decline of faiths, almost all of which are currently expe-
riencing waves of regrowth. He got it wrong, of course, by trying to
impose a grand scheme on everything and everybody. His ‘Divine
Plan’, a plot made up of the future advent of a new world order, the
need for God to punish those responsible for the sufferings of the Bab,
Baha’ Allah, and their followers, and an overriding desire to believe
and demonstrate that history is not something made by human beings,
but rather thrust upon them by a divine puppet-master proved itself
constantly prone to rebuttal by the simple march of human events.

10 Udo Schaefer (2000: 321).

The Baha’i Dilemma
So, the Baha’is have a dilemma. They don’t want the process of secu-
larization rolled back, since this would mean either the regeneration of
old faiths that ought to be on their way out or the forward march of new
religions whose temporal success would surely negate a Divine Plan that
has no role for them. Since it is far from likely for the foreseeable future
that Baha’ism alone will both challenge secularism and supplant it glob-
ally, it looks as though the Baha’is will have to accept a secular society
for a long time to come. In any case, only a tolerant secular society, the
sort of society that grants human beings their liberty to think and speak
and write as they wish, can provide the context for any forward move-
ment of the Baha’i faith. But since the Baha’is don’t really like secular
society and make a point of adopting a conservative position on many
issues that will only serve to alienate the best minds and most tolerant
participants in such a society, they aren’t likely to get very far.

What does this imply for Baha’ism and globalization? If my argu-
ment is correct, that a global society needs to be a secular society, then
it suggests that the Baha’is won’t know which way they are going. If
they choose secularization because it means toleration for their own
beliefs and activities (something they certainly do not ﬁnd in Muslim
societies), their anti-secular attitudes will probably result in their mar-
ginalization or some sort of unholy alliance with the Christian right.
If, on the other hand, they prefer to promote ﬁrm religious belief, we
have already shown the problems this may create between them and
the adherents of other churches and faiths.

Summary
To sum up: it seems to me axiomatic that Baha’ism can be character-
ized as:

• Intolerant of other religions, yet tolerant of their adherents (but not

their priesthoods).

• Triumphalist with regard to the defeats of other faiths.
• Intolerant of the best aspects of secular society, such as freedom of

> thought and speech, freedom to dissent, freedom to reject religion,
> and so on, which are important factors in creating a tolerant global
> society.

• Ambivalent towards secularization, which offers them advantages

> and helps fulﬁll prophecies, but emphasizes freedoms for which
> they do not care too much.
• Intolerant towards internal dissent, to the extent that non-conform-

ists may lose their voting rights or be excommunicated.

The foregoing may seem to most people reading this paper a contra-
diction of what they believe the Baha’i faith to hold dear. How could
Baha’ism be intolerant of other religions, for example? I think I have
provided enough evidence above to show that this is really the case,
notwithstanding World Religion Day and the willingness of Baha’is to
take part in inter-faith activities. It may be true that Baha’is will never
actively persecute the members of other faiths. But Shoghi Effendi,
whose views are never challenged in Haifa or elsewhere, seemed
to think it a matter worth rejoicing over that Christians, Muslims,
and others were subjected to humiliation and worse during his life-
time.11 The Universal House of Justice, despite clear evidence to the
contrary, has continued to pursue a vision of a world falling into
irremediable decay, and the continuing inﬂiction of divine vengeance
on all non-believers. To my knowledge, no modern Baha’i authorities
have tackled the topics of the meaning of the Holocaust, AIDS, global
warming, etc. in the context of God’s supposed plan for mankind.

I do not doubt that the Baha’is will contribute to what they see as
half-way measures towards world unity, while working in their own
fashion towards the establishment of a Baha’i World Commonwealth
somewhere in the future. They will continue to participate in confer-
ences on world unity and peace, they will continue to show a concern
for human rights (and to publish booklets on human duties, which they

see as essential corollaries to rights), and they will continue to enter
into some sort of dialogue with the followers of other faiths, even if this
is only window-dressing, since they don’t actually believe those other
faiths to be anything but distortions of some pristine faith. They will
— with total justiﬁcation — protest to the UN and other bodies about
the persecution of Baha’is in Iran, and yet enjoy a thrill of satisfaction
every time Islam meets with a setback there or elsewhere.

My conclusion is that, if the Baha’is are going to get anywhere in
their contribution to globalization, they will have to reinvent them-
selves, and I’m not sure they will be willing or able to do that. A less
Islamicist religion, one that was better able to adapt itself to circum-
stances, rather than believing circumstances should adapt themselves
to its universal prescriptions, might accomplish much. Obsolete laws
would be placed where they belong, silly historicist theories would be
cast aside, absolute scriptural rulings would be interpreted in a more
liberal fashion, and ethics would bend to accept things that human
beings, in their foolishness and dignity, have found to be of beneﬁt. But
Baha’ism has inherited from Islam a rigid core and a thoroughgoing
authoritarianism that sit uneasily beside its seeming openness, and it
is this that may, as the very nature of the global enterprise develops,
make it a dinosaur.
