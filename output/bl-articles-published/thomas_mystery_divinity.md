               The Mystery of Divinity
a Comparison of Traditional Views of Divinity to Those

in Some Answered Questions

James B. Thomas

Introduction

In the normal course of events we share an endless chain of ideas with
the use of definitive terms in efforts to get our points across, whether
metaphorical or real. And we do this with great confidence in our own
understanding of such terms. Even the parameters of uncertainty can
be described with clarity in terms of probability when dealing with
a myriad of statistical information, ranging from human affairs to
nuclear physics. Yet in matters of the spirit we often do not have a clue
as to what words such as soul, God, heaven and others that we use so
frequently really mean. Generally they are described in a most super-
fluous manner in order to at least have some kind of transitory grasp
of their relationship. Such a term is Divinity, one that truly relates
to a realm of deep mystery. This paper approaches an understanding
of this subject in four stages: [1] Sources of knowledge relating to
divinity are reviewed with reference to the Greco-Roman, Medieval
and modern periods; [2] Applications of meanings provided by these
sources are evaluated in terms of current understanding; [3] Societal
impacts of such applications are examined; [4] New thoughts and
proofs are introduced in light of the writings of `Abdu’l-Bahá. Finally,
a conclusion is drawn that infers a new paradigm of spiritual evolu-
tion, and suggests a possible platform for philosophical dissertation
regarding religious influence on secular matters in the modern world.

1: Sources of Knowledge

Choice sources for researching knowledge are the authentic experts
in various fields of expertise, but in most fields, such as astronomy,
physical sciences, mathematics, sociology, philosophy, political sci-
ence, economics, engineering, electronics or education, the notion of
divinity is utterly absent. Perhaps in the fields of advertising and of
music, a cursory accolade to a product or performer may be made
with use of the term ‘divine’ with little inference as to its true meaning.
Even in psychology and medicine the word is rarely if ever mentioned.
So, for one to understand divinity requires reflection on a different
level. For example, a quality of divinity is called providence where
benevolent intervention occurs based on faith. This infers that in the
field of theology the ramifications of divinity may be determined.

> In one view the concept of Providence, divine care of man and
> the universe, can be called the religious answer to man’s need
> to know that he matters, that he is cared for, or even that he is
> threatened, for in this view all religions are centered on man,
> and man is individually and collectively in constant need of
> reassurance that he is not an unimportant item in an indif-
> ferent world; if he cannot be comforted, to be threatened is
> better than to be alone in an empty void of nothingness.1

This comment from an overview article in the Encyclopedia Bri-
tannica on divinity with respect to Providence provides a general
understanding of ancient and current views of the subject; these will
be extolled in this section. Following is a summary in paraphrase of
the concepts and views from the article.

A second view of Providence involves a cosmic order wherein man-
kind has a proper place of a divine nature that is intended for its
wellbeing. But it is incumbent that man not pervert the order or
upset it by rebellion. However, the degree of firmness of this order, if

too extreme, may invoke the possibility of degenerating into fatalism
such that man might then drift powerless on the path of an imper-
sonal destiny. Most religions combine both views.

Greco-Roman Times

> The etymology of Providence as a special quality of divinity began
> in the five or so centuries preceding the Common Era when
> philosophers and statesmen exercised the terminology with respect
> to what is now considered to be pagan religious notions. The first
> Greek author to use the term was Herodotus, a fifth-century BCE
> historian, who mentioned that Divine Providence was the source
> of wisdom that keeps nature in balance. Others, like Xenophon
> and Plutarch, referenced the word in connection with the watchful
> care of the gods over mankind and the world. Cicero referred to the
“Providence of the gods” and the Stoics wrote treatises on the subject.

> Around the Third Century BCE the Greek poet/philosopher Clean-
> thes wrote a hymn in glorification of the god Zeus as a benevolent
> and foreseeing ruler of the world and of man: “For thee this whole
> vast cosmos, wheeling round the earth, obeys, and where thou leadest
> it follows, ruled willingly by thee.”2

Seneca said man should believe “that Providence rules the world
and that God cares for us.” Further, the Stoic school to which he
belonged rejected blind fate and maintained that everything happens
according to a benevolent divine plan, which they preferred to call
Providence. It was this concept that influenced Christianity. In the
Latin world the word Providence was used as a designation of the
deity. In fact it was Seneca again who wrote that it is proper to apply
the term Providence to God.

Early Middle Ages
With the fall of Rome in 476 CE, the Christian Church in the west
continued its long ascendency to power. Philosophy was then influ-
enced by the late Roman thinkers Augustine and Boethus, among
others. Augustine’s philosophical ideas were shaped by Neoplatonism,
which helped him understand the realm of truth that lies beyond the
senses. It is a spiritual realm that becomes the goal of human striv-
ing that Augustine identified with the God of Christianity. Though
Divinity is not specifically mentioned, he maintained that truths
associated with mathematics and ethics are eternal and immutable
but cannot come from the contingent world nor even from the mind,
which is also contingent, but are due to the illuminating presence
in the mind of eternal Truth, or God.3 In modern terminology this
would appear to be an example of Divine Providence.

Boethius is considered to be an important channel through which
Greek Philosophy would later be made available in the middle ages.
His untimely death at the behest of the Ostrogoth king, Theodoric,
cut short his plan to translate Greek Philosophy into Latin, but he
was able to translate the logical writings of Porphyry and Aristotle.
The Aristotelian doctrine of universals (terms that can be applied to
more than one particular thing) are presented as innate ideas (from
Plato) that are remembered from a previous existence. “This book was
widely discussed in the Middle Ages. It contains not only a Platonic
view of knowledge and reality but also a lively treatment of provi-
dence, divine foreknowledge, chance, fate, and human happiness.”4

From the Eastern Church, the Greek Fathers provided another means
by which Greek Philosophy would be embraced in the Middle Ages.
Again it was Neoplatonic concepts that would provide a synthesis of
Christian thought. John Scotus, of Ireland, translated the writings of
some of the Greek theologians into Latin. In his own extensive trea-
tise On The Division Of Nature he developed an interesting concept
regarding divinity.

> God is the primal unity, unknowable and un-nameable in
> Himself, from which the multiplicity of creatures flows. He
> so far transcends his creatures that he is most appropriately
> called super-real and super-good. Creation is the process of
> division whereby the many derive from the One. The One
> descends into the manifold of creation and reveals himself
> in it. By the reverse process, the multiplicity of creatures will
> return to their unitary source at the end of time, when every-
> thing will be absorbed in God.5

With the writings of the great thinkers of the early Middle Ages, con-
cepts of divinity began to take on new meanings. As philosophers of
the period moved away from what was considered pagan beliefs, they
integrated secular logic of the early Greeks with a Judeo-Christian
stance such that the idea of Divine Providence became central to the
basic belief system of Christianity.

Medieval Period
Western philosophy was profoundly influenced by a cultural
revolution in the Twelfth Century. New approaches to education
emphasized logic, dialectic and early scientific discipline in place of
grammar and the reading of classics in Latin, as witnessed by the
scholar John of Salisbury (c. 1115–1180):

> Behold, everything was being renovated: grammar was being
> made over, logic was being remodeled, rhetoric was being
> despised. Discarding the rules of their predecessors, [the
> masters] were teaching the quadrivium (arithmetic, music,
> geometry, astronomy) with new methods taken from the
> very depths of philosophy.6

Platonism was diminished while a renewed interest in Aristotle
emerged. His methods of disputation and science were embraced
especially by Thomas Aquinas and his mentor Albertus Magnus.
There was also great esteem for Arabic and Jewish thinkers, all of
whom contributed to a knowledge explosion in Western Europe.
Aquinas felt that the philosopher seeks the first cause of things
based on data supplied by the senses, whereas the theologian finds
truth about God as revealed in sacred scriptures. He thought Aris-
totelianism to be a useful tool for Christian thought, along with
Platonism to some extent. It was Aristotle’s proof of a primary
unmoved mover that Aquinas deepened or expanded to mean God
in the Judeo-Christian context.

> The eminent Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) had a profound
> impact on these medieval Schoolmen whose theological and philo-
> sophical teachings in the universities were referred to as Scholasticism.
“His analysis of many metaphysical terms, such as being, essence, and

> existence, and his metaphysical proof of the existence of God were
> often quoted, with approval or disapproval, in Christian circles. Also
> influential were his psychology, logic, and natural philosophy.”7

Among Jewish scholars was Moses Maimonides, who helped the
Schoolmen to reconcile Greek Philosophy with revealed religion. He
felt that there could be no conflict between reason and faith because
both come from God. In deference to Aquinas’ view, he thought that
Aristotle’s arguments for a world eternal were not valid because they
disregarded the omnipotence of God.8

In sum, the primary philosophy in the Western world during the
Middle ages was Christian in the way that it complemented divine
revelation. It was the churchmen who developed the philosophical
arguments through the Fourteenth Century and who were also
theologians at the Universities of Oxford and Paris. But from this

period forward, the importance of divinity and providence gave way
to profound changes in the arena of philosophy.

> As secular authority replaced ecclesiastical authority and
> as the dominant interest of the age shifted from religion to
> politics, it was natural that the rivalries of the national states
> and their persistent crises of internal order should raise
> with renewed urgency philosophical problems, practically
> dormant since pre-Christian times, about the nature and the
> moral status of political power. This new preoccupation with
> national unity, internal security, state power, and interna-
> tional justice stimulated the growth of political philosophy in
> Italy, France, England, and Holland.9

As the late middle ages deferred to the Renaissance there burst forth
a revival of interest in medicine, classic literature and mathematics.
Discoveries in mathematics impelled the scientific revolution in the
Sixteenth Century and the impetus of Classical literature provided a
philosophical foundation of humanism that emphasized the central-
ity of human beings in the universe with their supreme value. It was
Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) who put forth three propositions
that were so pertinent to the times:

> Here are enunciated respectively (1) the principle of empiri-
> cism, (2) the primacy of mechanistic science, and (3) faith in
> mathematical explanation. It is upon these three doctrines,
> as upon a rock, that Renaissance and early modern science
> and philosophy were built. From each of Leonardo’s theses
> descended one of the great streams of Renaissance and early
> modern philosophy: from the empirical principle the work
> of Bacon, from mechanism the work of Hobbes, and from
> mathematical explanation the work of Descartes.10

Modern Era
In approaching the Modern Era with its materialistic bent, it
becomes evident that we must depart philosophy in order to find
any further influence of Divinity on the modern mind. The remain-
ing track for study is religion for whatever it might reveal in those
changing times. Indeed the Protestant Reformation provided a “sea
change” in western civilization.

What was central to Protestantism throughout its history was the
belief that humans are justified before God by grace through faith. It
was this that separated the early Christian reformers from Roman
Catholicism and its concern with sin, atonement and good works.
Justification is concerned with the desire to find oneself on good
terms with God:

> Aware of its shortcomings, its ignorance, its sin, and its guilt,
> humankind saw itself standing before a bar of justice pre-
> sided over by God. Without help, individuals could expect
> nothing but God’s wrath and condemnation. This meant
> that they would perish everlastingly, and their present
> life would be full of torment. Yet the Bible also presented
> humankind with a picture of a loving and gracious God, who
> desires happiness for all.11

But the question remained as to how one could be sure that God
would not reveal His wrathful side instead of His graciousness. In
other words, “how could one be confident that they would be the
recipient of God’s positive loving action?”12

The answer to this lingering question must somehow depend upon
a deeper understanding of Divinity and the source of its Providence.
And, it is apparent that the understanding of divinity is inescapably
bound up with the Revelation or Enlightenment associated with any
religion under question. Some theologians reject revelation on the

basis of mythological conceptions connected with it. With others
there have been moments of ecstatic experience that bring the sense
of internal revelation and with it some degree of wisdom. But how is
it confirmed?13 To understand this aspect we will need to know how
the meanings inherent to Divinity have historically been applied to
the life of human kind.

2: Applications of Meanings

Comments were made that further characterize the nature of divinity
with respect to the application of the qualities associated with Provi-
dence. For example, the belief in a concept of Providence as a quality
of divinity entails the existence of a powerful, wise and benevolent
deity. These three attributes are essential and the primary require-
ment is benevolence. This does not exclude the possibility however of
punishment when one transgresses. Yet the divine being is understood
to be well intentioned toward man. What’s more, Providence does
not have to be direct as it may operate through various intermediary
beings, such as ancestors or spirits in non literate religions or angels
in Christian and Muslim belief. Providence on the other hand can be
expressed by a world order that makes life possible and guarantees
future existence. Further, it may exist as a principle of cosmic order
that is maintained by a divine being. But if the connection between
that being and justice is lost, then Providence degenerates into a
concept of fate where divinity would be inconsequential.

This idea of cosmic order does have a profound effect on the general
picture of Providence as divine care for mankind but does not rule out
the introduction of intermediary beings in the process. However, if the
cosmic order is considered to be benevolent where man can feel safe, it
is markedly different from a personal relationship between man and
his god or gods. A personal god can be influenced by prayer and sacri-
fice to influence events whereas a fixed world can not be so influenced.14

> Although the introduction of intermediary beings brings
> no essential change in the idea of Providence as the divine
> watchful care for the benefit of mankind, the notion of a
> cosmic order changes the picture profoundly. Even if the
> cosmic order is conceived as a benevolent order in which
> man is able to feel safe and whose very existence reassures
> him, such an order is different from the personal relation-
> ship between man and his god or gods. The concept of an
> unchangeable world order requires a different reaction. A
> personal god may, perhaps, be moved by prayer and sacrifice
> to give or to prevent events; when the order of the world is
> fixed, however, the course of events cannot be changed by
> these or any other means.15

One can see that such a conflict in precepts opens the door to a con-
fusing array of ideas about providence, divinity and cosmic order
where on the one hand one may be attracted to a deity that would have
compassion for the individual and where on the other hand one may
lean in a rational fashion toward a cosmic order that is under the pur-
view of a distant impersonal Creator no longer involved in the order
itself. It could be said that the impact of philosophical arguments
on the daily course of human affairs are rarely acknowledged except
for those that are in agreement with religious notions of the day. In
other words, it does seem that mountains of words, however logical
they may be, do not really move people unless they somehow touch
the hearts, and for this to happen belief systems must be brought
into play, as for instance in the application of prayer in moments of
crisis or joy. Hence, when a concept of God is introduced through a
revelatory process, the idea of a cosmic order seems logical with its
foundation based on faith instead of words alone. That is perhaps
why the impact of ideas upon the society of man take hold in the
sweeping course of history. But this notion requires a deeper look
into the implications of faith in the life of man and of how civilization
is constantly tested.

3: Social Impacts

Although the names of the founders of the world’s great religions are
mentioned in scholarly studies, a point that is generally overlooked
is the process associated with Divine Revelation. Simply put, the
process of revelation from a Divine Prophet introduces knowledge
and wisdom in an utterly different way than those derived by phi-
losophers in a material world. Such knowledge is from a divine
source and must be addressed on its own terms that might ultimately
require unequivocal faith. Therein lies a problem for many who
waffle between certitude and doubt in their pursuit of truth. This is
not easy to reconcile, often resulting in a fall-back to an earlier time
that might seem more safe and comfortable, as suggested by a phrase
in a favorite song “give me that old time religion, it’s good enough for
me…” Such imagery might produce a sense of solace and peace but
in reality a return to an earlier time would remind one of hardships
long forgotten. Nevertheless, ideas of the past do linger in various
forms as they weave through the cultural psyche. The concepts of the
ancients regarding divinity and providence mentioned in Section I
are still with us in fragmented forms and, though nameless, do influ-
ence our thinking today.

> Mention is made of predestination as a possibility for com-
> bining the idea of a personal divine will with a cosmic fixed
> order that man is expected to work within as governed by a
> set of rules. The Deists in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth
> Centuries believed that “God created the world and the
> cosmic order in such a manner that to a great extent the
> course of the world is fixed from the first beginning and he
> is no longer involved in it.”16 Even now, in the Twenty-first
> Century, this thought is held by some very accomplished
> scientists who question the existence of a God that would
> create a universe and then leave it alone with no apparent
> further involvement. On the other hand, opposing views

> are made:The fact of creation helps man to believe in Provi-
> dence because it would be inconsistent for the creator god
> or gods not to care for the further existence of the created
> world. Only persistent disobedience and open rebellion can
> then furnish a reason for the Creator to abandon or destroy
> the world. This situation is expressed in the myths of a great
> flood or some other form of destruction sent as a punishment.
> There is, however, never a total destruction of the world in
> these myths, although this final solution may be threatened
> for the eschatological (ultimate end) future. It may also be
> promised, if the eschatological events are construed as the
> definitive institution of a world order that is perfect for all
> eternity and will never deteriorate.17

Additionally, in the Zoroastrian Faith there is among its concepts
one of determined order that is natural and ethical as well. Founded
around 650 BCE in Persia and later expanded into India, the religion
refers to Asha that is identified with the sacred element of fire. His
counterpart, Drug, represents evil and deceit, whereas the Indian
Rta fills the same role as Drug. Providence, on the other hand, has
particular objectives whereas the cosmic order in a general sense
embraces the world and, by extension, the universe and all it contains.

> The benevolent aspect of Providence may be confined to a
> special group of people or at least be specially related to that
> group; or a number of patron gods or saints may watch over
> some specific activity or smaller group. This accounts for
> the idea of a chosen people watched over and led by a just
> and loving God. The ancient people of Israel is, perhaps, the
> best known example; the concept, however, is widespread.
> Patron gods and patron saints who are particularly charged
> with caring for some small group, craft, or activity or who
> operate in special circumstances, such as during illness or
> war, occur in most religions and are popular in many.18

It was suggested that we are left with certain critical problems. “In
monotheistic religions, Providence is a quality of the one divinity;
in polytheistic religions it may be either a quality of one or more
gods or it may be conceived as an impersonal world order on which
the gods, too, more or less depend.”19 The consequence of the latter
may be chance instead of benevolence all of which reflects a sense of
ambivalence for fate and Providence. Lastly, the reconciliation of a
provident God with the existence of evil in the world may constitute
the most difficult problem associated with Providence and therefore
with divinity itself.

4: New Thoughts

`Abdu’l-Bahá puts a question: What connection has the Reality of

> Divinity with the Lordly Rising-places and the Divine Dawning-
> points? (SAQ 46) This question alone opens a whole new paradigm
> for inquiry apart from what has been addressed so far. For instance
> one might want to know what is meant by Lordly Rising-places. And
> what are Divine Dawning-points? To answer these questions, certain
> other considerations deserve attention.

To begin, He infers that the Reality of Divinity is the Essence of
Oneness, that it is absolute holiness, and further, it is exempt from all
praise because it is pure sanctity above all accessibility in the world of
man. He then offers a surprising clarification of supreme attributes
with reference to this human plane of existence. He points out that
they exist only in our imaginations. In other words, this pure essence
of sanctity that is beyond description, that is incomprehensible, that
is invisible, and that is inaccessible still surrounds all things. He
further makes a point of logic that whatever is being surrounded is
necessarily less than that which surrounds. Moreover, that which is
being surrounded is limited to its internal reference points but by
nature, remains oblivious to the outer reality that surrounds it. No

matter how far evolution may take us, the extent of knowledge that
man may acquire will always face the limitations of his own reality.

> However far mind may progress, though it may reach to the
> final degree of comprehension, the limit of understanding, it
> beholds the divine signs and attributes in the world of cre-
> ation and not in the world of God. For the essence and the
> attributes of the Lord of Unity are in the heights of sanctity,
> and for the minds and understandings there is no way to
> approach that position. “The way is closed, and seeking is
> forbidden.” (SAQ 146)

The beauty of this is that, though one might not be a part of that
sanctified essence, one may be made aware of spiritual reality through
the numerous examples of its effects in human interaction in spite
of such limitations. For instance, when people commit acts of kind-
ness without expectations of reward, they are exhibiting attributes
of a non material order, e.g. kindness, sharing, concern for others
and benevolence, to name a few. What’s more, these attributes are
learned through the study of revelation or by examples of others who
have so learned. Philosophical dissertations have their place but they
appear to be unable to escape the dichotomy of contending ideas in
a kingdom of words when describing divinity as shown in Section
I. The approach offered by `Abdu’l-Bahá goes far beyond any play
of words because His logic is unremitting in the pursuit of truth
regarding Divinity.

He observes that human understanding is a quality of man’s existence
and that man being so endowed is one of the signs of God. Then He
asks a provocative question: “How can the quality of the sign sur-
round the creator of the sign?” In other words, a quality of man such
as understanding is incapable of comprehending God. Thus Divinity
is hidden from all comprehension. Being concealed from the minds
of men, it is on a plane impossible to attain. The reasoning here is

that everything of a lower reality is powerless to comprehend that of
a higher reality. He gives the example of a tree that, no matter how
evolved, cannot comprehend the functions of sight, of hearing and
of other functions, and yet “man and tree are alike in that they were
created. Therefore, how can man, the created, understand the reality
of the pure Essence of the Creator?”

`Abdu’l-Bahá elaborates further on the bewildering challenge facing

> anyone who attempts to understand, much less explain, the unap-
> proachable plane of God. There is simply no sufficient explanation
> for its comprehension. Indeed, in the mind of man there is no way to
> identify an indication of it.

> Consequently, with reference to this plane of existence, every
> statement and elucidation is defective, all praise and all
> description are unworthy, every conception is vain, and every
> meditation is futile. But for this Essence of the essences, this
> Truth of truths, this Mystery of mysteries, there are reflec-
> tions, auroras, appearances and resplendencies in the world
> of existence. (SAQ 146)

This quote about auroras and appearances sequels the question
put earlier by `Abdu’l-Bahá regarding Divine Dawning points. He
explains that these mysterious reflections related to the Essence of
essences are associated with the Holy Dawning-places for the ris-
ing of Divine Messengers of God. They are the true mirrors of the
sanctified Essence of God and appear to us in visible form. They are
like clear polished mirrors that reflect the splendor of the Sun but in
Their own essence reflect the splendor of God. He is quick to point
out that the sun is not the same as its image in the mirror and that
it never becomes part of it. Similarly, the “Unlimited Reality” is not
limited to the place of appearance. In other words it is not anthropo-
morphic. “No; all the praises, the descriptions and exaltations refer
to the Holy Manifestations…” He adds that all the attributes and

qualities mentioned return to the Divine Manifestations although
they are beyond human description since no one has attained to the
Essence of Divinity. “Therefore, all that the human reality knows,
discovers and understands of the names, the attributes and the
perfections of God refer to these Holy Manifestations.” (SAQ 148)

> Yet, concurrently we do voice the attributes and names of the Divine
> Reality and while, in our praise, attribute to Him the familiar five
> senses as well as knowledge, life and power. To do so affirms that He
> is incapable of imperfections. In this light a contrast is drawn between
> perfection and its opposite, imperfection. For example, ignorance is
> imperfection whereas knowledge is perfection. Thus, the Essence of
> God is wisdom. Weakness is imperfection but power is the opposite;
“consequently, we say that the sanctified Essence of God is the acme of

> power.” (SAQ 148) But all these attributes, though they may have the
> same names as our own, are beyond human comprehension for they
> are identical with His Essence. `Abdu’l-Bahá logically maintains that
> there would be multiple preexistences if the attributes are not identi-
> cal with His Essence. And since Preexistence of God is necessary for
> consideration of the reality of creation, this would mean that there
> would be an infinite sequence of preexistences. Such a condition is
> considered to be impossible in a universe of finite entities. That is, if
> each had an infinite sequence of preexistences then they would no
> longer be finite and Divine Messengers would be infinite in number
> and for that matter, the same would apply to God, an obvious error.
> Thus, His attributes must be identical with His Essence and there-
> fore beyond our comprehension.

At this point `Abdu’l-Bahá reinforces an extraordinary concept that
lies at the root of spiritual belief with a quote from a Hadith. “All
that you have distinguished through the illusion of your imagina-
tion in your subtle mental images is but a creation like unto yourself,
and returns to you.” (SAQ 149) He makes it clear that all of these

eulogies, praises, names and attributes really apply to the Places of
Manifestation. Further, it is pure imagination to think of anything
beside them because we are unable to comprehend the invisible or
the inaccessible.

> It is clear that if we wish to imagine the Reality of Divinity,
> this imagination is the surrounded, and we are the surround-
> ing one; and it is sure that the one who surrounds is greater
> than the surrounded. From this it is certain and evident
> that if we imagine a Divine Reality outside of the Holy
> Manifestations, it is pure imagination, for there is no way
> to approach the Reality of Divinity which is not cut off to
> us, and all that we imagine is mere supposition. (SAQ 149)

Though not aware of it, people everywhere are caught up in a myriad
of imaginations. They have become worshipers of the idols of conjec-
tures that are considered to be the ultimate Reality that, contrarily, is
actually purified from all descriptions. And they regard themselves
as unified with others being worshipers of idols. At least idols have a
material composition whereas the imaginations of man are nothing
more than fancies that do not even have a mineral content.

It is affirmed that all the Holy Manifestations of God have attributes
of perfection and divine bounties and that from Them lights of inspi-
ration emanate. It is emphasized further that Christ and Baha’u’llah
show evidence that is beyond human imagination. It is given that
They possess attributes of the former Manifestations but in addition
They possess some perfections that other Prophets depend upon. The
example is given regarding the Prophets of Israel who were, in them-
selves, centers of inspiration. Mentioned were Isaiah, Jeremiah and
Elijah to, name a few, but as profound and influential as their utter-
ances were, there remains a vast difference in them when compared

to the inspiration of the Word of God as spoken by Manifestations
of God such as Christ and Baha’u’llah.

We are asked to reflect upon the way light radiates and stimulates the
nerves in the eye to produce sight. The light emanating from a lamp
does so in a like manner as the sun but is vastly inferior in power. He
further comments that when the spirit of man appears, it does so in
the embryonic state. It then progresses to the state of childhood and
then to maturity. As such it does so in a condition of perfection. He
states the spirit is one, but that in the embryonic condition, hearing
and sight are undeveloped but in the state of maturity it appears in
splendor and brilliance.

> In the same way the seed in the beginning becomes leaves
> and is the place where the vegetable spirit appears; in the
> condition of fruit it manifests the same spirit—that is to say,
> the power of growth appears in the utmost perfection; but
> what a difference between the condition of the leaves and that
> of the fruit! For from the fruit a hundred thousand leaves
> appear, though they all grow and develop through the same
> vegetable spirit. Notice the difference between the virtues
> and perfections of Christ, the splendors and brilliance of
> Bahá’u’lláh, and the virtues of the Prophets of Israel, such as
> Ezekiel or Samuel. All were the manifestations of inspiration,

Conclusion

Philosophy notwithstanding, it was religion that ultimately promul-
gated a deeper appreciation of Providence with respect to divinity

or, in other words, Divine Providence. In the early period of the
Hellenic world, fatalistic belief was strong, as expressed in astrology
where man is governed by the stars and planets, while the Talmud
of Jewish tradition taught that Israel is subject only to God, not to
any of the stars. Later the Christian sense of Providence was shown
in the Gospel according to Matthew: “Are not two sparrows sold for
a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your
Father’s will. But even the hairs of your head are numbered. Fear not,
therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.”20

This infers Divine intervention and possibly represents the most
meaningful concept of Divinity that remains with us in the Western
and Islamic civilizations today in spite of all the later developments.
As the ideas regarding Providence evolved from what are sometimes
called pagan beliefs, through the many rational arguments from
the early middle ages to the Medieval period, through the Renais-
sance with certain Islamic influences, and through the Reformation
regarding proofs of God, we find throughout a cross pollination of
religion and philosophy. After all these centuries the Protestant
world clings to fundamental concepts of an earlier time mixed with a
strong impulse toward individuality.

Divinity may be resolved with the very title of Section 37 in Some
Answered Questions, “Divinity can only be comprehended through the
Divine Manifestations.”
