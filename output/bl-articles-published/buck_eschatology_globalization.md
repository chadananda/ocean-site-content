THE ESCHATOLOGY OF GLOBALIZATION:
THE MULTIPLE-MESSIAHSHIP OF

BAHÀ"U"LLÀH REVISITED

Christopher Buck

1. Mission and Message

1\.1. Introduction
Globalization is a fact of postmodern life and the entire world is
impacted by it. While its definition eludes consensus and is hotly
contested, “globalization” generally refers to the increasing inter-
dependence of nation-states, the integration of economic systems, and
the relativization of cultures which, in pre-modern times, had been
worlds unto themselves. Clearly, globalization is supraterritorial in
its domain, but always local in its effects. It is transforming the world,
irreversibly. World religions are caught up in this tidal wave of
change.

The new world religion known as the Bahà"ì Faith has recently
been studied from the standpoint of globalization, as the titles of two
recent sociological studies suggest: “Bahà"ì: A Religious Approach to
Globalization” (Warburg 1999), and “The Religious Construction of
a Global Identity: An Ethnographic Look at the Atlanta Bahà"ì
Community” (McMullen 1997). This new global community has been
described as “a unique religious movement responding to globalization
processes by creating a worldwide religious identity for its adherents
through both ideological and organizational means” (McMullen 1997:
224). The prophet-founder of the Bahà"ì Faith, Bahà"u"llàh (d. 1892),
anticipated globalization and established ethics and laws for it. This
study investigates the nature of his relationship to globalization.

Declaring himself the “Promised One” of all religions (that is, sev-
eral messiahs at once a “multiple-messiahship” converging in one
person), Bahà"u"llàh explained both his truth-claims and world reforms
as the symbolic (rather than literal) fulfillment of messianic prophecies
found in world religions (Buck 1986). These public proclamations
were the dramatic climax of Bahà"u"llàh’s progressive roles as mys-
tic messiah, prophetic messiah, and royal messiah. In his messianic

144                        

role as “World-Reformer,” Bahà"u"llàh undertook one of the first
global peace initiatives in modern history and thus was engaged in
a dialectic with modernity. Since the notions of “World-Reformer”
(mußli˙ al-'àlam: see Tablet to Queen Victoria below) and world
reforms are globalizing concepts, inevitably a question arises: Was
Bahà"u"llàh an epiphenomenon of globalization or a catalyst of it?
The answer appears to be both. This study argues that Bahà"u"llàh’s
signal contribution to globalization was to ethicize and sacralize it.
Messiahship was the medium (Bahà"u"llàh as revealer), and world
unity was the message (revelation).

An illustration of this interplay between medium and message may
be seen in the following historical anecdote: Àqà 'Azìzu"llàh, sur-
named Jadhdhàb, was a Jewish merchant from Mashhad who, fol-
lowing his conversion, had visited the Holy Land and met Bahà"u"llàh.
At the request of 'Abdu’l-Bahà", Jadhdhàb carried on a correspon-
dence between Edward Granville Browne and Count Leo Tolstoy.
In 1902, again at the request of 'Abdu’l-Bahà", Jadhdhàb traveled
to Yasnaya Polyana to acquaint Tolstoy with the Bahà"ì Faith. Tolstoy
asked several questions, and part of the interview, as recorded by
Jadhdhàb himself, concerned Bahà"u"llàh’s messianic claims: “Next,
his query was about the claim of the Blessed Perfection [Bahà"u"llàh],
and I replied that He was ‘the Speaker on Sinai’, ‘the Everlasting
Father’, ‘the Spirit of Truth’, ‘the Heavenly Father’ Whom the Sons
of Israel and the Christians expect; the return or advent of Óusayn,
according to the beliefs of Shì'ì Islam; and according to the views
of the Sunnìs the Advent of the Bàb was the Mahdì, the Advent of
Bahà"u"llàh was the Second Coming of Christ; and according to the
beliefs of the Zoroastrians, it was the Advent of Shàh Bahràm”
(Balyuzi 1985: 189).

This is a fair characterization of Bahà"u"llàh’s eschatological claims
which, together with his identification as the Bàbì messiah, He Whom
God Shall Manifest, reflect six distinctive messianic identifications:
(1) Judaism: a messianic reading of the so-called “Yuletide prophecy”
of Isaiah 9:6, which equates the “Everlasting Father” with Bahà"u"llàh
as the promised Messiah; (2) Christianity: Bahà"u"llàh as the Spirit of
Truth or Comforter predicted by Jesus in his Farewell Discourse of
John 14–17; (3) Zoroastrianism: Shàh Bahràm Varjavand, a Zoroastrian
messiah predicted in various late Pahlavi texts; (4) Shì'a Islam: Óusayn
redivivus, that is, the return of the Third Imam; (5) Sunnì Islam: the
return of Jesus ('Ìsà), whose role, as attested in the “sound” (ßa˙ì˙)

                        145

Sunnì ˙adìth, is to break crosses and kill swine; (6) the Bàbì movement:
He Whom God Shall Manifest (man-yuΩhiruhu"llàh).

As mystic messiah, Bahà"u"llàh sustained a period of messianic
secrecy in Baghdad (1853–1863), during which his messianic role
was intimated but not openly disclosed. As prophetic messiah,
Bahà"u"llàh announced his mission to the religious leaders of Zoro-
astrianism, Judaism, Christianity (Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity,
Protestantism), Islam (Sunnì and Shì'a), and the Bàbì movement. As
royal messiah, Bahà"u"llàh issued collective proclamations, as in the
Sùra of the Kings, articulating his professed role as “World-Reformer”
and corresponding world reforms. To communicate his mission to
world leaders directly, Bahà"u"llàh addressed epistles to Pope Pius
IX, Napoleon III, Czar Alexander II, Queen Victoria, the Shah of
Iran, and others. Bahà"u"llàh also took pains to effect delivery of
these epistles, especially through diplomatic channels. Magisterial in
style, these letters about “God and country” from God to each coun-
try became the public record of Bahà"u"llàh’s reformist vision, with
its attendant teachings of unity, of which there are at least thirty
specific types (twenty-three of which are itemized in Buck 1999).

Context interprets text. History can be used as a heuristic or inter-
pretive device for understanding religions in terms of their founders.
In what was possibly the first critical study of these truth-claims (Buck
1986), a first-order phenomenology was used to provide a descrip-
tive (not explanatory) reduction of these claims to the concept of
“multiple-messiahship,” which finds its only real analogue in the
proclamations of the second-century prophet, Mànì (d. 274). This
phenomenology ought now to be complemented (“revisited,” as the
title of this study suggests) by a history of religions approach, to
place Bahà"u"llàh’s multiple-messiahship in historical perspective. A
brief review of the form and function of these messianic proclama-
tions will help provide a context for Bahà"u"llàh’s world reforms,
illustrative of his engagement with history a dialectic typically referred
to in the broader literature as a “response to modernity.”

The following typology of Bahà"u"llàh’s messianic claims is based
on Bahà"u"llàh’s own retrospective summation of three stages in the
historical sequence of his mission, in which he communicated his
messages to “mystics (al-'urafà"), then divines (al-'ulamà"), and then the
kings (al-mulùk wa al-salà†ìn)” (Ishràqàt 260; tr. Saiedi 2000: 241).

Nader Saiedi sequences these stages as follows: (1) first stage,
1852–1860; second stage, 1860–1867; and (3) third stage, 1867–1892

146                       

(2000: 7). This chronology is neither rigid nor exclusive. Rather, it
suggests a period of mystical intimations evident only to the rela-
tively few who were attuned enough so as to discern them, followed
by a period of increasingly overt messianic self-disclosures, culmi-
nating in public proclamations to world leaders.

2. Mystical Messiah

As stated, over the course of his forty-year ministry (1852–1892),
Bahà"u"llàh “proclaimed” his mission to mystics, divines, and kings
and rulers. Bahà"u"llàh’s mystical allusions to his impending prophetic
vocation took place during the Baghdad period (1853–1863), which
was characterized as a period of messianic secrecy, referred to as
“days of concealment” (ayyàm-i bu†ùn), this term having a semantic
association with gestation in the womb. Persian Bahà"ì sources even
refer to Bahà"u"llàh’s visions of the heavenly Maiden in his 1852
imprisonment in the “Black Pit” (Siyàh-Chàl ) as constituting a “pri-
vate declaration.” To Westerners, this would appear to be an oxy-
moron. Yet the proclamations of Bahà"u"llàh are seen within a
continuum of latent and kinetic self-disclosures, driven by the same
spiritual energy but constrained according to the dictates of wisdom.

2\.1. Messianic Secrecy
In 1848, the Bàb revealed a new law code (Bayàn-i Fàrsì ), para-
doxically super-Islamic in piety, yet supra-Islamic in principle. After
the Bàb’s martyrdom, Bahà"u"llàh revitalized the Bàbì community.
Occasionally, Bahà"u"llàh would drop messianic hints, as instanced
in the Four Valleys (Chahàr Vàdì ): “Methinks I catch the fragrance
of musk from the garments of [the letter] ‘H’ (qumùß al-ha) wafting
from the Joseph of Bahà" (Yùsuf al-Bahà")” (tr. Lambden 1998: 39;
cf. SV 59), a rather transparent circumlocution with messianic over-
tones. Bahà"u"llàh thus began his career in relative messianic secrecy,
having first become a follower of the Bàb, who thereby finds a par-
allel in the figure of John the Baptist, to whom Christ at first sub-
mitted. While Bahà"u"llàh had a clear intimation of his messianic
role in the Siyàh-Chàl dungeon in 1852, where he experienced a
visionary annunciation when a celestial “Maiden of Heaven” appeared
to him, he did not disclose the full messianic implications of these
visions until 1863.

Islamic prophetology is anchored in the received interpretation of
Q. 33:40, establishing Mu˙ammad as God’s final Messenger or “Seal
of the Prophets.” In perhaps his most significant exegetical maneu-
ver, Bahà"u"llàh relativizes that claim in order to supersede it, re-
focusing the reader’s attention a mere four verses later (Q 33:44), a
verse that promises eschatological attainment to the “presence of
God” (liqà"u"llàh) on the Last Day. Since direct beatific vision of God
is impossible, Bahà"u"llàh reasons that Q 33:44 anticipates a future
theophanic messiah who, as deus revelatus and divine vicegerent, is
symbolically “God” by proxy. By force of explicative logic, the Kitàb-
i-Ìqàn (arguably the world’s most widely read non-Muslim Qur"àn
commentary), which was revealed in Jan. 1861, served as advance
prophetic warrant for Bahà"u"llàh, who, on 22 April 1863, declared
himself as “He Whom God Shall Manifest” (man-YuΩhiruhu"llàh), the
messianic theophany foretold by the Bàb.

3. Prophetic Messiah

The vast majority of early Bahà"ìs were, as would be expected, “apos-
tates” from Shì'a Islam. (In Islam, apostasy [irtidàd ] is a capital
offence.) This, in itself, tempts the hasty conclusion that the new reli-
gion was merely an offshoot of Islam, its sectarian roots notwith-
standing. It was not long until the nascent Bahà"ì community emerged
from its Islamic chrysalis as a universal religion, superseding, in some
sense, traditional Islamic boundaries and, indeed, the dichotomous
categories of the “House of Islam” (dàr al-Islàm) and the “Abode of
War” (dàr al-˙arb) although the latter category foreshadowed the
intense persecution that Bahà"ìs were soon to face and had already
experienced in the Bàbì phase of their history. The universal char-
acter of the Bahà"ì religion was dramatically demonstrated through
the entrance of Zoroastrians and Jews, who were the first religious
minorities to convert to the Bahà"ì religion (Maneck 1991 and 1984).

3\.1. Zoroastrianism
The eminent Zoroastrian theologian, Dastur Dhalla, estimated that
around 4,000 Zoroastrians had converted to the Bahà"ì Faith in Iran
(primarily from the ethnic strongholds of Yazd and Kirman, includ-
ing virtually all of the Zoroastrians of Qazvin), while 1,000 Parsees
were won over in India (cited by Maneck 1991: 36). These conversions

148                         

were religiously actuated by acceptance of Bahà"u"llàh’s identification
as Shàh Bahràm, a belief that served as an eschatological “bridge”
over which Zoroastrians conceptually transferred their allegiance from
traditional Zoroastrianism to a new identity as messianic Zoroastrians.

Shàh Bahràm Varjavand was a Zoroastrian messiah predicted in
various late Pahlavi texts. In a recent article, “Bahà"u"llàh as Zoroastrian
Saviour” (Buck 1998a), the relevant texts are assembled and atten-
tion is drawn to some problems in connection with their fulfillment.
One of Bahà"u"llàh’s Tablets to the Zoroastrians, reads, in part, as
follows: “This is the Mystery of your Book (Ìn-ast sirr-i kitàb-i shumà)
[the Avesta], which was revealed [lit. ‘sent’] aforetime (ka az qabl
firistàda shud )” (MMM 24). In the Tablet of Seven Questions (Law˙-i
Haft Pursish revealed in pure Persian for the benefit of a Zoroastrian
audience), Bahà"u"llàh repeats a question posed by Ustàd Javàn-
Mard, who, at one time, had served on the Council of Zoroastrians
in Yazd (RB 3:272): “The fourth question: ‘Our books have announced
the [future] appearance of Shàh Bahràm with manifold signs for the
guidance of mankind’,” (tr. Razavi 1993: 50) to which Bahà"u"llàh
responded: “[O friend!] Whatsoever hath been announced in the
Books hath been revealed and made clear. From every direction the
signs have been manifested. The Omnipotent One is calling, in this
Day, and announcing the appearance of the Supreme Heaven” (PDC
77; MMM 243–244). The effects of such proclamations were not,
alone, sufficient cause for these conversions, but the eschatological
claims themselves provided the requisite religious authority for those
who suspended their disbelief in a realized eschaton.

The early Zoroastrian converts, as Maneck (1991 and 1984) has
shown, tended to remain within their respective Zoroastrian enclaves
of Yazd and Kirman. Some of them worked assiduously for the ame-
lioration of the plight of the Zoroastrian community, and were quite
effective at it, especially in educational reform. Inevitably, perhaps,
the Zoroastrian priests took umbrage over the presence of apostates
within their fold, and consequently exercised their authority in hav-
ing these Zoroastrian Bahà"ìs expelled from the community.

The notion of “apostasy” is itself relative. While the high priests
found the conversions an offensive kind of betrayal or religious “trea-
son,” as it were the Bahà"ì converts themselves had embraced their
new-found religion as the fulfillment of Zoroastrianism, not as a rejec-
tion of it. Suffice it to say that the conversions of Zoroastrians
redounded to the welfare of the Zoroastrian community itself, which

                       149

witnessed a fresh resolve on the part of the converts to improve the
conditions of the Zoroastrians who were socially marginalized as sec-
ond-class citizens in an Islamic system which did not live up to its
founding ideals of protection and relative parity of religious minori-
ties under Muslim rule.

3\.2. Judaism
As there was no centralized leadership or authority within Judaism,
Bahà"u"llàh’s proclamations to Jews were essentially of a local nature,
with a collective rhetorical style of address. In an unpublished epis-
tle to a certain Àqà Jàn and other Bahà"ìs of Jewish ancestry,
Bahà"u"llàh declares: “The Face of the Ancient One [Bahà"u"llàh]
hath turned towards the sages (˙ukamà") in al-hà" and al-mìm [=
Hamadàn] and announceth unto them the glad-tidings of the Ri∂wàn
of God, the Lord of all the worlds. . . . By God! He hath come who
hath been named Jehovah in the Torah, and the Comforter (al-
mu'azzì ) in the Gospel (al-injìl ), as well as the Great Announcement
(al-naba" al-'aΩìm) in the Qur"àn” (tr. Lambden 1986: 65). The inter-
religious nature of Bahà"u"llàh’s claims are typically expressed in mes-
sianic clusters, as this one, in which the convergence of such claims
serves to heighten their dramatic impact. The “sages” addressed here
are the rabbis of Hamadàn, scene of the first concerted Bahà"ì mis-
sion to the Jews.

The late Óasan M. Balyuzi credits the celebrated Bahà"ì savant,
Mìrzà 'Abu’l-Fa∂l Gulpàygànì (d. 1914), with much of the success
of the Jewish mission: “It was principally through his writings that
the Bahà"ì Faith was presented to the Jews of Iran in such a way
as to bring a large number of them into the Bahà"ì fold” (1985:
264–65). By 1884, the Bahà"ì missionary effort that began in 1877
in Hamadàn yielded its fruit, where, according to the historian of
Persian Jewry, Habib Levy, some 150 of the approximately 800
Jewish households had converted. From there, the Bahà"ì Faith spread
like wildfire to the Jewish communities of Tehran, Isfahàn, Bukhàra,
Mashhad, Gulpaygan (where seventy-five percent of the Jewish com-
munity had been won over), and Kàshàn (in which half of the Bahà"ì
community was of Jewish origin), according to the best estimates
(cited by Maneck 1991: 36).

The late Adib Taherzadeh notes that, while Bahà"u"llàh did, by
and large, address the political and religious leaders of his day,

150                          

“[p]robably one exception was the Jewish people as they did not
belong to a particular state at that time” (RB 4:168). This is a telling
observation, a fact not lost on Bahà"u"llàh himself. In 1891, a year
before the end of his life, Bahà"u"llàh reflected on his proclamation
to the world’s rulers. Reportedly, Bahà"u"llàh said that, while he had
fully proclaimed his mission to crown and mitre, he wanted to pre-
sent his message to Baron Rothschild, who could in some ways be
regarded as the leader of the Jewish diaspora at that time. Bahà"u"llàh
therefore commissioned the aforementioned Jadhdhàb to write to this
magnate to acquaint him with the Faith and, if possible, to follow
this up with a visit (RB 3:168). According to his memoirs, Jadhdhàb
did write his letter to the Baron, which was rendered into French
(qtd. in RB 3:172), in which Bahà"u"llàh is represented as the Lord
of Hosts. It is not known, however, whether or not the meeting
between Jadhdhàb and Baron Rothschild ever took place.

It was not just for rhetorical effect that Bahà"u"llàh’s proclama-
tions to Jews were expressed in pluralistic terms. He gave further
breadth to their traditional messianic imagination, expanding the
notion of a world-prophet whose fulfillment of expectations from
other world religions lent some credence to those religions them-
selves. In a Tablet to Óàjì Elyahu Kohan, known as 'Abdu’l-Óusayn,
Bahà"u"llàh proclaims:

> Say: This day the City of God hath appeared and can be witnessed
> in perfect adornment. This is the City in which the God of all peo-
> ples hath appeared. Ponder these words of John, who announced the
> great and sacred City and said: “And I saw no temple in it; for the
> Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city
> had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the
> glory of God [Arabic: Bahà"u"llàh] did lighten it, and the Lamb is the
> light of it” (Rev. 21:22–23). (tr. Buck and Buck 1991: 35)
Lambden observes, “Bahà"u"llàh cites this verse in Arabic exactly as
it was printed in the London 1671 (1858) edition of the William
Watts Arabic Bible for Eastern Churches” (1998: 21). Bahà"u"llàh’s
use of Rev. 21:22–23 as a proof-text in a Tablet to a Jewish Bahà"ì
is perfectly consistent with the changed outlook of converts to the
Faith, who embraced Christ and Mu˙ammad in the process of accept-
ing Bahà"u"llàh as the Lord of Hosts.

3\.3. Christianity
Bahà"u"llàh’s proclamation to the Jews transitions to a proclamation
to Christians, who have assimilated much of Hebrew scripture and
tradition. Having already cited the Book of Revelation for the
edification of Jewish converts, Bahà"u"llàh made further use of this
text in a Christian context. On a specific prophecy elsewhere in the
Apocalypse and on the prophecies of Jesus generally, Bahà"u"llàh, in
“The Essence of Mysteries” ( Jawàhir al-asràr) exclaimed:

> Shouldst thou reflect on these words [Rev. 1:16–17], thou wouldst find
> them to exemplify the utmost perspicuity and highest eloquence nay,
> to have attained the furthest limit of refinement of expression ( faßà˙a)
> and the last degree of elegant lucidity (balàgha), as if the very suns of
> eloquence (shumùs al-balàghat) had been generated from them, and the
> stars of perspicuity (anjum al-faßà˙at) had risen and shone resplendently
> above their horizon (Buck 1995: 81).

In Christian terms, Bahà"u"llàh saw himself as the Spirit of Truth
or Comforter predicted by Jesus in his Farewell Discourse of John
14–17. This claim was of great moment, but Bahà"u"llàh superseded
even this by his claim to be the “Father.” In “The Most Holy Tablet”
(al-Law˙ al-Aqdas), popularly known among Bahà"ìs as the “Tablet
to the Christians” and thought to have been revealed to the first
Christian convert to the Faith, Faris the Physician, Bahà"u"llàh explic-
itly declares: “Say, Lo! The Father is come, and that which ye were
promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled!” (TB 11). This is an unex-
pected claim, to say the least, inasmuch as Christians for centuries
had awaited the return of Christ in glory, but had never conceived
of the eschatological advent of the “Father.” The closest Christians
ever came to such an interpretation was in their typological read-
ing of the so-called Yuletide prophecy of Isa. 9:6, which heralds the
advent of the “Everlasting Father,” who was never identified as a
messianic figure with Judaism. In their search for scriptural warrant,
Bahà"ì apologists have often pointed to the Parable of the Vineyard
as the New Testament witness for the advent of the Father.

Bahà"u"llàh explains that prophecies are, by design, arcane. They
can only be decoded by those who are spiritually discerning, and
who thus have the capacity to realize that fulfillment has already
taken place. As Bahà"u"llàh states: “Know then that He [ Jesus], Who
in the realms of glory gave utterance to these words, wished to
describe the signs of the One Who would appear by means of symbol

and allusion lest the worldly (ahl al-majàz) should perceive His mean-
ing” (cited in Buck 1995: 81). As there are three major divisions
within Christianity Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and Protestantism, Bahà"-
u"llàh’s approach to each of these great traditions within Christianity
will be treated separately.

3\.3.1. Catholicism
For an analysis of Bahà"u"llàh’s proclamation to Catholics, see the
discussion of the Tablet to the Pope in section 4.5.2.

3\.3.2. Orthodox Christianity
In The Promised Day is Come, Shoghi Effendi (1980) has translated
around one-third of Bahà"u"llàh’s second tablet to the first Christian
convert to the Bahà"ì Faith, Faris Effendi (Lambden 1993: 23). The
most important proclamatory passages in this Tablet reflect Bahà"u"llàh’s
familiarity with the hierarchy of the Eastern Orthodox Church:

> Say: O concourse of patriarchs ( yà ma'shar al-ba†àriqa)! He Whom ye
> were promised in the Tablets (al-alwà˙) is come. Fear God, and fol-
> low not the vain imaginings of the superstitious. Lay aside the things
> ye possess, and take fast hold of the Tablet of God (law˙ Allàh) by His
> sovereign power. . . . Pride ye yourselves on My Name (bismà), and yet
> shut yourselves out as by a veil from Me (min nafsà)? This indeed is
a strange thing!

Say: O concourse of archbishops ( yà ma'shar al-ma†àrina, lit. metro-
> politans)! He Who is the Lord of all men (walì al-barrìya) hath appeared.
> In the plain of guidance (barr al-'ahdi ) He calleth mankind, whilst ye
> are numbered with the dead! Great is the blessedness of him who is
> stirred by the Breeze of God (nasamàt Allàh), and hath arisen from
amongst the dead in this perspicuous Name (al-ism al-mubìn).

Say: O concourse of bishops ( yà mala" al-asàqif )! Trembling (al-
> zalàzil, lit. earthquakes) hath seized all the kindreds of the earth (al-
> qabà"il, lit. tribes), and He Who is the Everlasting Father (al-rabb al-abadì,
lit. Everlasting Lord) calleth aloud between earth and heaven.

Say: O concourse of priests ( yà ma'shar al-qissàs)! The Day of Reckoning

This text was quoted at length to draw attention to the Orthodox
ecclesiastical hierarchy to which this proclamation was directed. Bahà"-
u"llàh’s interactions with Protestants reveal other distinctive features.

3\.3.3. Protestantism
Moojan Momen (1982) has written an account of contacts between
the early Bahà"ìs and the Presbyterian missionaries in Persia. These
contacts led to the first public mention of Bahà"u"llàh in America.
Speaking before the World’s Parliament of Religions (1893), the Rev.
Henry H. Jessup stated: “In the palace of Behjeh . . . just outside the
fortress of Acre [in Palestine], . . . there died a few months since a
famous Persian sage, the Bàbì saint, named Baha Allah . . . the head
of that vast reform party of Persian Moslems, who accept the New
Testament as the Word of God and Christ as the deliverer of men,
who regard all nations as one, and all men as brothers. Three years
ago he was visited by a Cambridge scholar, and gave utterances [sic]
to sentiments so noble, so Christ-like” (qtd. by Momen 1982: 76).

One Protestant who actually corresponded with Bahà"u"llàh was
Georg David Hardegg (1812–1879). In 1854, he co-founded the
“Society for the Collection of the People of God” that is, the German
“Association of Templers” (Tempelgesellschaft) in Jerusalem. While at
the Templer colony in Haifa, he naturally heard of Bahà"u"llàh, the
mystique of whose reputation piqued Hardegg’s curiosity. In conse-
quence of this, Hardegg tried to meet with Bahà"u"llàh, but was
never granted an audience. However, the two corresponded. In
response to Hardegg’s questions, Bahà"u"llàh revealed a tablet known
as the Law˙-i Hir†ik. An English rendering of a German translation
of this letter was published by Momen (1981: 216–17; cf. RB III:28–31),
but Stephen Lambden has provided a provisional translation from
the original Arabic text, in which Bahà"u"llàh states:

> As for what you mentioned, that a certain person hath supposed there
> are no differences between us with regard to the Spirit [ Jesus]: This
> is the truth, inasmuch as the Spirit [ Jesus] is sanctified above being
> overwhelmed by differences, or encompassed by symbolic expressions.
> He, verily, is the Light of Oneness among mankind, and the Sign of
> the Ancient among the peoples. He who turneth unto Him [ Jesus]
> hath turned unto He [God] Who sent Him [ Jesus] . . . He hath ever
> been what He was and will ever remain the same as what He was;
> only the effulgence of His Epiphany in the Mirrors varies on account
> of Their different forms and colours. (tr. Lambden 1983: 56).

In the Law˙-i Hir†ik, Bahà"u"llàh does not openly proclaim his messiah-
ship. But there are hints of it, in such passages as this: “Land and
sea have rejoiced at the beneficence of God and the promise made unto
the nations concerning [the appearance of ] the ‘Healer of Infirmities.’

(mu†ahhir al-'ilal ) He, verily, is the builder of the Temple (bànì al-
haykal ). Blessed be those possessed of mystic knowledge. When the
appointed time came, Carmel cried out, trembling (ihtizàz) as if
shaken by the breezes of the Lord. Blessed be those who hearken”
(Lambden 1983: 54). Taking as his imagery the sacred topography
of the Holy Land, he personifies Carmel as one who recognizes the
advent of Bahà"u"llàh. In this oblique way, Bahà"u"llàh “tests” the
receptiveness of Hardegg. At one time, Bahà"u"llàh briefly lived among
the Templers at the foot of Mount Carmel. This was towards the
end of his life. While Bahà"u"llàh was a guest among them, he was
erstwhile a prisoner of the Persian and Ottoman governments through-
out the course of his forty-year ministry (1852–1852). This was the
result of a fundamental conflict with one of the major tenets of Islam:
the finality of Mu˙ammad’s prophethood.

3\.4. Islam
While there is much in common between Sunnì and Shì'ì end-time
predictions, there are considerable differences as well. Some of these
differences will be discussed in the next two sections. However, many
of Bahà"u"llàh’s proclamations to Muslims of whatever persuasion are
pan-Islamic, in that they communicate his claims of universal prophet-
hood by way of Qur"ànic exegesis, rather than through reference to
the popular a˙àdìth or akhbàr narrations of the fantastic events of the
eschaton. Bahà"u"llàh transforms certain current readings of verses,
understood to relate to the afterlife, into dramatic messianic promises
of which he was the fulfillment. The example of the Kitàb-i-Ìqàn was
mentioned above, and in that text can be seen the key ingredients
of Bahà"u"llàh’s unique exegetical approach to Qur"ànic eschatology.
The Qur"ànic concept of the Day of Resurrection is interpreted in
such a way as to describe Bahà"u"llàh’s own time (the hermeneutic
of presentism), and the many verses promising the attainment to the
presence of God (liqà" Allàh) are cited, not as assurances of beatific
encounters after death, but as prophecies of Bahà"u"llàh’s advent.

3\.4.1. Sunnì Islam
There is a need to differentiate Bahà"u"llàh’s messianic identity within
a Sunnì context from the specifically Shì'ì associations that the claim
to Óusayniyya entails (on which see the next section). While the figure
of Óusayn, the grandson of Mu˙ammad, is venerated in Sunnì piety,

he does not play a role in the Sunnì eschatological drama. For both
groups, the emergence of al-Mahdì initiates the events of the last
days, but, for Sunnì Islam, it is Jesus, not Óusayn, who is at the
centre of the post-Mahdi eschaton. If one were to look for a specifically
Sunnì messiah likely to correspond with Bahà"u"llàh’s proclamations,
it would be the Sunnì Jesus. However, the matter is not so simple.

As a prophetic messiah, Bahà"u"llàh repeatedly stated that he
fulfilled the prophecies of all religions, that he was the Promised One
of all the holy books. Within the chain of interpretive authority ini-
tiated by Bahà"u"llàh’s “Book of My Covenant” (Kitàb al-'Ahdi ) both
'Abdu’l-Bahà" and Shoghi Effendi have identified Bahà"u"llàh with
the Jesus of Sunnì eschatology (SAQ 39; GPB 94). And yet, while
Bahà"u"llàh addressed a number of works to Sunnì audiences in
which prophetic authority and claims to divine revelation are explicit,
there is no known text in which he engages the traditional litera-
ture and expectations regarding the return of Jesus after al-Mahdì.

The works of Bahà"u"llàh that do amount to identifications of his
messiahship with the return of Christ are directed to audiences that
are either Christian or Shì'ì, and thus engage the elements of those
traditions regarding the eschatological Jesus. The equation of Bahà"u"llàh
with the Sunnì Jesus in Bahà"ì literature can therefore be seen as
the elaboration of the principle of multiple-messiahship enunciated
by Bahà"u"llàh. In the proclamations to the leaders of Sunnì com-
munities, however, it is upon other grounds that Bahà"u"llàh estab-
lishes his prophetic credentials. This may be due to the nature of
the traditional sources of Sunnì eschatology, in which the primary
role of the returned Jesus was to break crosses and kill swine.

3\.4.2. Shì'a Islam
Although Bahà"u"llàh’s Shì'ì-referenced proclamations were aimed
more at Bàbìs than Shì'a Muslims, it is true that the latter had
anticipated the advent of Óusayn redivivus, that is, the return of the
Third Imam, an expectation that Bahà"u"llàh himself acknowledges:
“Consider the eagerness with which certain peoples and nations have
anticipated the return of Imam-Óusayn, whose coming, after the
appearance of the Qà"im, hath been prophesied . . . “That hour is
now come. The world is illumined with the effulgent glory of His
countenance” (GWB 12). In an Arabic passage in Bahà"u"llàh’s pre-
dominantly Persian Tablet, the Law˙-i Nasìr, Bahà"u"llàh proclaims:

> By God! This is He Who hath at one time appeared in the name of
> the Spirit [al-rù˙ = Jesus Christ], thereafter in the name of the Friend
> [al-˙abìb = Mu˙ammad], then in the name of 'Ali [the Bàb], and after-
> wards in this blessed, lofty, self-subsisting, exalted, and beloved Name.
> In truth, this is Óusayn, Who hath appeared through divine grace in
> the dominion of justice, against whom have arisen the infidels, with
> what they possess of wickedness and iniquity. Thereupon they severed
> His head with the sword of malice, and lifted it upon a spear in the
> midst of earth and heaven. Verily, that head is speaking from atop
> that spear, saying: “O assemblage of shadows! Stand ashamed before
> My beauty ( jamàlì ), My might (qudraì ), My sovereignty (sal†anatì ) and
> My grandeur (kubriyà"ì ). Turn your gaze unto the countenance of your
> Lord, the Unconstrained, so that you may find Me crying out among
> you with holy and cherished melodies.” (tr. Buck 1986: 163; MMM
> 196; cf. MacEoin 1989: 120)
This is a striking and powerful image. Indeed, the passion and pathos
of Óusayn must surely have resonated with Bahà"u"llàh’s own suffering
as a result of the persecutions he had to endure.

3\.5. Bàbìsm
Given the Islamic background of the Bahà"ì Faith, its message was
cast in a traditional Islamic (that is, Shì'ì) mould. Yet there was a
transformation of function. While Islamic (specifically Ishràqì) vocab-
ulary was still being used, the very words took on new meaning.
The Bàb, who was Bahà"u"llàh’s precursor, had already precipitated
a decisive break from Islam. As stated earlier, the Bàb had estab-
lished a religion that was super-Islamic in form, yet supra-Islamic in
function (Buck 2001). In practical terms, Bahà"u"llàh completed what
the Bàb began. Indeed, Bahà"u"llàh’s religion represents, from a cer-
tain perspective, the universalization of the religion of the Bàb.

To the Bàbìs, Bahà"u"llàh proclaimed himself as He Whom God
Shall Manifest (man-YuΩhiruhu"llàh), a figure promised throughout the
Bàb’s writings. Bahà"u"llàh’s lengthiest work is the Kitàb-i-Badì (Edirne,
c. late 1867 or early 1868), written in defense of his Bàbì messi-
ahship. In this book, Bahà"u"llàh cites a rather explicit and striking
prophecy of the Bàb, from Sura 57 of the Qayyùm al-Asmà" (p. 224):
“Indeed, God hath created everywhere around this Gate oceans of
divine elixir, tinged crimson with the essence (lit., “oil”) of existence
and vitalized through the animating power of the desired fruit; and
for them God hath provided Arks of ruby, tender, crimson-colored,
wherein none shall sail but the people of Bahà" (SWB 57–58; cf. tr.

Lambden 1986: 60). One illustrative passage of Bahà"u"llàh’s procla-
mation to the Bàbìs is this: “Verily He Who is the Truth hath
appeared in His sovereignty! His proof is the revelation of His divine
verses, and His testimony is the manifestation of His own Self ” (tr.
Saiedi 2000: 182). This line of argument follows that of the Bàb
himself. What remained for the Bàbìs was to decide whether or not
Bahà"u"llàh was indeed the one foretold by the Bàb. The majority
of Bàbìs accepted Bahà"u"llàh’s claims.

3\.6. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Beyond
While Bahà"u"llàh did not proclaim himself to be the Hindu mes-
siah directly, he did so in principle. Moreover, in 1872 he sent a
teacher Jamal Effendi to India, with the result that the latter is con-
sidered by Bahà"ìs to be the “spiritual father of India.” Later, 'Abdu’l-
Bahà" confirmed an American Bahà"ì’s identification of Bahà"u"llàh
with Kalki (“Destroyer”) Vi“nuyasas (“Fame of Vi“nu” or “Glory of
God”), the Tenth Avatar of classical Vaisnavaite tradition (Buck
1986). Jamal Effendi also traveled to Burma, where the first Buddhists
to become Bahà"ìs converted.

4. Royal Messiah

Between the years 1867 and 1873, Bahà"u"llàh as mentioned above
sent epistles to the world’s rulers and religious leaders. Historically,
the more important messages were addressed to the crowned heads
of Europe, in public proclamations to Queen Victoria, Napoleon III,
Pope Pius IX and other world leaders during the Adrianople
(1864–1868) and 'Akkà periods (1868–1892). Dissemination of these
messages was no easy task, and involved certain practical concerns.
In the nineteenth-century Middle East and even to this day (espe-
cially in the Islamic Republic of Iran), mere possession of Bahà"u"llàh’s
writings could result in the arrest, imprisonment, torture, and pos-
sible execution of their bearer. This is most dramatically illustrated
in the transmission of Bahà"u"llàh’s Tablet to the Shah of Iran
(revealed in the spring of 1868; see Cole 1998a: 32), which will be
discussed shortly.

Our knowledge of the dispatch of Bahà"u"llàh’s epistles, revealed,
for the most part, in 'Akkà to the leaders of the Great Powers, is
sketchy. The circumstances under which they were written are as

dramatic as they were oppressive. A British lawyer, Myron Phelps,
spent the month of December 1902 in 'Akkà. While he was there,
he recorded a rare, oral account of the imprisonments and exiles of
Bahà"u"llàh, his family and entourage as told by the prophet’s daugh-
ter, Bahìyyih Khànum (see photograph in Balyuzi 1980: 348). Owing
to the prevailing Muslim customs, it was not possible for Phelps to
meet with Bahìyyih Khànum personally, and so her narrative was
conveyed, in installments, through Madam M.A. de S. Canavarro.

“When we had entered the barracks,” Bahìyyih Khànum recounts,
“the massive door was closed upon us and the great iron bolts thrown
home. I cannot find words to describe the filth and stench of that
vile place. We were nearly up to our ankles in mud in the room
into which we were led. The damp, close air and the excretions of
the soldiers combined to produce horrible odours. Then, being unable
to bear more, I fainted.” “As I fainted,” Bahà"u"llàh’s daughter con-
tinues, “those about me caught me before I fell; but because of the
mud and filth there was no place upon which I could be laid” (Phelps
1903: 57).

When illness broke out among the Bahà"ì prisoners, no physician
was allowed, until a prison officer pleaded with the governor to allow
a physician to treat 'Abdu’l-Bahà", who had been stricken with dysen-
tery. Bahìyyih Khànum recalls: “My brother begged him [the physi-
cian] to take a message to the believers who were waiting to hear
from the Blessed Perfection [Bahà"u"llàh]. He undertook to do so,
and carried away a tablet in the lining of his hat. For two years this
physician conveyed tablets to and from in this way” (Phelps 1903:
65). Bahà"u"llàh’s daughter then makes this general statement, from
which we can deduce the manner in which Bahà"u"llàh’s epistles to
the kings and rulers were both revealed and relayed to their intended
recipients: “We were imprisoned in the barracks, without any sub-
stantial change in our manner of life, for two years. During this time
none of us left the prisonnot even my brother or any of the chil-
dren. The Blessed Perfection passed his time in his room, writing
tablets, or rather dictating them to my younger brother, who was a
rapid penman. 'Abbàs Effendi would copy them and send them out
by the physician” (Phelps 1903: 65–66).

Notwithstanding the perils of dissemination, Bahà"u"llàh took specific
measures for the delivery of his epistles and other writings to vari-
ous heads of state and to leaders of religions as well. One of the
few Europeans to have personally met Bahà"u"llàh attests to this

practice and to the intentions behind it. This was Henry Edward
Plantagenet, known as Count Cottrell, who, because of his involve-
ment with the 'Akkà-Damascus railway, was in 'Akkà during the last
year or two of Bahà"u"llàh’s life. Around 1891, together with his wife
and daughter, Count Cottrell had the rare privilege of enjoying
Bahà"u"llàh’s hospitality. On that occasion, the Count was given a
copy of Bahà"u"llàh’s law code, the Arabic al-Kitàb al-Aqdas, penned
in the hand of Mìrzà Àqà Jàn, Bahà"u"llàh’s amanuensis. Count
Cottrell wrote:

> I have personal and intimate knowledge of the present leaders of the
> Bàbìst movement in Persia, the four sons of the late Mirza Hussein,
> who are political prisoners in 'Akkà, though the Shàh within the last
> twelve months has repealed the penal laws against the sect, and is now

> 1895; qtd. in Momen 1981: 236).

Cottrell’s references to “the princes” may appear unusual to a reader
who is aware that Bahà"u"llàh and his entourage were exiles and
virtual prisoners. Under such circumstances, they were hardly “princes”
by any stretch of the imagination. In reference to Bahà"u"llàh him-
self, 'Abdu’l-Bahà" has said: “Every person, friend or stranger, who
came into His presence used to say, ‘This is a prince, not a cap-
tive’” (SAQ 32). This was true in Cottrell’s case. His observations
concerning Bahà"u"llàh’s intent to proclaim his mission to world lead-
ers are validated by Bahà"u"llàh’s own statement: “Upon Our arrival
at this Prison ['Akkà], We purposed to transmit to the kings the
messages of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Though We
have transmitted to them, in several Tablets, that which We were
commanded, yet We do it once again, as a token of God’s grace”

(GPB 206). This refers to an earlier set of proclamations, contained
in the Sura of the Kings (Sùrat al-Mulùk), revealed in Edirne (Adrianople)
in 1867.

On the delivery of these epistles to the various kings and rulers
whom Bahà"u"llàh addressed, Nabìl reports Bahà"u"llàh as saying:

> From Our Most Great Prison, We were moved to address to the sev-
> eral rulers and crowned heads of the world Epistles, in which We sum-
> moned them to arise and embrace the Cause of God. To the Shah
> of Persia, We sent Our messenger Badì, into whose hands We entrusted
> the Tablet. It was he who raised it aloft before the eyes of the mul-
> titude and, with uplifted voice, appealed to his sovereign to heed the
> words that Tablet contained. The rest of the Epistles likewise reached
> their destination. To the Tablet We addressed to the Emperor of France,
> an answer was received from his minister, the original of which is now
> in the possession of the Most Great Branch ['Abdu’l-Bahà"]. . . . The
> Epistle we addressed to the Czar of Russia, alone failed to reach its
> destination. Other Tablets, however, have reached him, and that Epistle
> will eventually be delivered into his hands.

'Abdu’l-Bahà" confirms, “these letters, with one exception, were sent
through the post” (1979: 177).

“The most important of His Tablets addressed to individual sov-
ereigns,” Shoghi Effendi writes, “Bahà"u"llàh ordered to be written
in the form of a pentacle, symbolizing the temple of man” (PDC
47). Taherzadeh discloses that the Tablets were copied in the fol-
lowing order: (1) the Sùrat al-Haykal itself; (2) the Tablet to Pope
Pius IX; (3) the Tablet to Napoleon III; (4) the Tablet to Czar
Alexander II; (5) the Tablet to Queen Victoria; (6) and the Tablet
to Nàsir al-Dìn Shah (RB 3:133; cf. Walbridge 1996: 168). An
overview of these Tablets and their dispatch will afford a glimpse
into this phase of Bahà"u"llàh’s mission. As to their dating, Browne
observes: “It seems to me not unlikely that the Epistles to the Pope,
the Emperor of the French, and the Czar of Russia were written at
Acre at about the same time as the Epistle to the Queen of England”
(1892a: 313). Precise dates of the revelation of the Tablets addressed
to the Pope, Czar Alexander II, and the Queen of England still can-
not be determined. However, due to the fact that five individual
Tablets to the Kings were inscribed in the Sùrat al-Haykal which,
according to 'Abdu’l-Bahà" (SAQ 25), circulated amongst the Bahà"ìs
during the early period of Bahà"u"llàh’s incarceration in 'Akkà, these
Tablets were probably revealed in 1869 during the same period when
the Tablet to Napoleon was also written.

Bahà"u"llàh’s proclamation to kings and ecclesiastics represents pos-
sibly the earliest (or one of the earliest) global peace initiatives ever
undertaken, rendering this mission historic. “When We arrived in
the Prison,” Bahà"u"llàh recounts, “We desired to send to the mon-
archs the epistles of their Lord, the master of men, that they might
know that tribulations have not deprived God of His sovereignty”
(AQA I 341; tr. Cole 1998: 60; cf. Browne 1992: 280). During this
time, when the “Great Powers” held sway Europe’s world domin-
ion having been achieved through imperialism and exploitative col-
onization the United States of America was relatively insignificant
on the world scene. It should be noted that Bahà"u"llàh did address
a short Tablet to the “Rulers of America” (PB 63).

4\.1. Tablet to the Shàh of Iran
Evidently before his arrival in 'Akkà, Bahà"u"llàh revealed an epis-
tle for Nàsir al-Dìn Shah, king of Persia (r. 1848–1896). In this epis-
tle, Bahà"u"llàh refers to the order decreeing his banishment to 'Akkà:
“And the lords of authority and wealth are about to send us from
this land, which is named Edirne [Adrianople], to the city of 'Akkà
[Acre]” (Browne 1892a, 282 and 313; cf. TN 80). That firmàn was
dated 26 July 1868. And so Browne was right when he surmised:
“Though the Epistle may very likely have been finished at Acre, it
must have been begun, therefore, in August, 1868” (Browne 1892a:
309). This is confirmed by 'Abdu’l-Bahà". “During the latter days
[passed] in Adrianople,” he recounts, “Bahà"u"llàh composed a detailed
epistle” which he then “placed . . . in a packet and adorned its address
with the royal name of His Majesty the King of Persia, and wrote
[on it] that some person pure of heart and pure of life, dedicated
to God, and prepared for martyr-sacrifice, must, with perfect resig-
nation and willingness, convey this epistle into the presence of the
King” (TN 58). The most probable date is March 1868.

4\.1.1. Transmission
The king’s resolve to exterminate the Bàbì and Bahà"ì religions was
actuated by the attempt on his life by Bàbìs who were aggrieved
over the Bàb’s execution in Tabriz in 1850. There had been a long-
standing need to assure the Shah that the Bahà"ìs their persecutions
notwithstanding were loyal subjects, and not bent on sedition. It was
important that Bahà"u"llàh communicate this directly, in writing, to

the Shah, in order to state for the record that the former condemned
the assassination attempt on the latter as a misguided and vile act.

In early 1869, a seventeen-year-old youth named àqà Buzurg
Nìshàpùrì, known by the honorific Badì' (“Unique,” “Wondrous”),
arrived in 'Akkà to attain the presence of Bahà"u"llàh. During his
two interviews, Bahà"u"llàh mentioned his Tablet to the Shah of
Iran, which had been revealed but not yet dispatched. Badì' requested
the honor of being chosen as the one to personally deliver that
Tablet, and was granted that historic opportunity. In a tablet, Bahà"u"l-
làh wrote: “We ask God to send one of His servants, and to detach
him from Contingent Being, and to adorn his heart with the deco-
ration of strength and composure, that he may help his Lord amidst
the concourse of creatures, and, when he becometh aware of what
hath been revealed for His Majesty the King, that he may arise and
take the Letter, by the permission of his Lord, the Mighty, the Boun-
teous, and go with speed to the abode of the King.” (tr. E.G. Browne
1891: 2:391–392; cited in Balyuzi 1980: 299). Pursuant to this mis-
sion, Badì' journeyed on foot, for four months, until he reached his
destination. Bahà"u"llàh anticipated the danger or even inevitability
of the martyrdom of Badì' in saying, further in the tablet:

> And when he shall arrive at the place of his throne, let him alight in
> the inn, and let him hold converse with none till he goeth forth one
> day and standeth where he [the Shah] shall pass by. And when the
> Royal harbingers shall appear, let him raise up the Letter with the
> utmost humility and courtesy and say, “It hath been sent on the part
> of the Prisoner.” And it is incumbent upon him to be in such a mood
> that, should the King decree his death, he should not be troubled
> within himself, and shall hasten to the place of sacrifice . . . (tr. Browne,
> apud Balyuzi 1980: 299)
The Shah would decree not only the death but the torture of the
youth as well. From Tehran, Badì' sought out the Shah’s summer
resort at Làr, approached the Shah, and attempted to deliver to him
Bahà"u"llàh’s tablet. Arrested and tortured to extract from him the
names of his companions, Badì' maintained that he had acted solely
on his own. This torture the dauntless youth endured with indomitable
resolve. (A photograph of Badì' taken during this period of torture,
is published in Balyuzi 1980: 306.) After this excruciating ordeal,
Badì' was finally killed in July 1869 by the blow of “a pounder used
for ramming in iron pegs.” Mu˙ammad-Valì Khàn Sipahdàr-i A'Ωam’s
moving account of the martyrdom of Badì' was penned in the mar-

gins of the copy of the Persian version of Some Answered Questions
which he had been given while in Paris in 1913 (Balyuzi 1980:
292–310, with facsimile on 302).

The Tablet to the Shàh was acquired by Russian consular officials
in Persia who then dispatched it to St. Petersburg, where it was
archived in the Collection of the Institute of Oriental Languages by
its director, M. Gamazov, who catalogued it as MS. No. 48/465.
Baron Victor Rosen sent Cambridge Orientalist a copy of the cat-
alogue of the Collection, which gives a complete description of the
Tablet. According to Browne, Bahà"u"llàh’s “instructions to the bearer”
that is, Badì' were “written on the outside of the packet” (1892a:
270).

4\.1.2. Proclamation
Browne notes that this tablet “is characterized by extreme modera-
tion of tone” (SWEGB 261). It is, moreover, “written with great
humility and moderation,” as evinced by Bahà"u"llàh’s self-reference
as “this slave” (hàdha al-mamlùk)” (264). Notwithstanding, Bahà"u"llàh
named this tablet, “The Rumbling” (RB 3:174). This Tablet is not
without the grandeur that is so salient a feature in the other epis-
tles to kings. Bahà"u"llàh speaks of himself as the “Comforting Spirit”
(ru˙-i tasallì ) in a transparent reference to his role as Paraclete
(Lambden 1997: 91). Towards the end of the Tablet (38), Bahà"u"llàh
states that “soon” ( yawma"idhin) there would be entry by “troops”
(afwàjan) into the Bahà"ì community.

4\.1.3. Response
The Shah’s immediate responsethe arrest and torture of Badì' has
already been noted. On the eve of his jubilee in 1896, the Shah
was assassinated.

4\.2. Tablet to Czar Alexander II

4\.2.1. Transmission
“One of the sections of the Sùratu’l-Haykal,” Bahà"u"llàh writes, “is
the Tablet addressed to His Majesty, the Czar of Russia” (ESW 56).
The tablet begins: “O Czar of Russia! Incline thine ear unto the
voice of God, the King, the Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the
Spot wherein abideth He Who, among the Concourse on high,
beareth the most excellent titles, and Who, in the kingdom of creation,

is called by the name of God, the Effulgent, the All-Glorious (Allàh
al-Bahìyy al-Abhà)” (PDC 33; cf. SWEGB 275). As stated earlier,
Bahà"u"llàh’s epistle to Emperor of Russia, Czar Alexander II
(r. 1855–1881), was revealed at a time when Bahà"u"llàh languished
as a prisoner in the barracks in 'Akkà. The Research Department
at the Bahà"ì World Centre in Haifa, Israel has not been able to
locate any further evidence as to whether or not the Tablet to Czar
Alexander II had ever been delivered. Recalling Bahà"u"llàh’s reported
statement, “The Epistle We addressed to the Czar of Russia, alone
failed to reach its destination. Other Tablets, however, have reached
him, and that Epistle will eventually be delivered into his hands”
(Dawnbreakers), Juan Cole has drawn attention to what he describes
as a “second” Tablet to the Czar, in which Bahà"u"llàh writes:

> In the Tablets to the Kings a mention was revealed of this wronged
> one’s imprisonment and the protection afforded by the resident min-
> ister of the glorious Russian state, may God aid him. O Tsar, one of
> your ambassadors helped me when I was in prison, weighed down by
> manacles and chains. Therefore, God has inscribed for you a station
> that no one can know. Beware lest you exchange this august station.
> During the days when this wronged one was being tormented in the
> dungeon, the ambassador of that glorious state may God assist him arose
> with perfect zeal to rescue me. On a number of occasions, permission
> to have me released was obtained, but some of the ulama of the city
> forbade it. But in the end the attention and efforts of the ambassador
> succeeded in freeing me. Then we set out for Iraq. (Cole 1998b)
This recognition of Russian intervention is written in a respectful,
even deferential tone. Internal evidence suggests that this second epis-
tle to the Czar was revealed after 1889. Clearly, Bahà"u"llàh assumes
an altogether different “voice” in his earlier, proclamatory epistle, in
which an exalted theophanic claim is made.

4\.2.2. Proclamation
Elsewhere in the epistle, Bahà"u"llàh warns the Czar:

> Beware lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who is the
> Supreme Sovereign. He, verily, is come with His Kingdom, and all
> the atoms cry aloud: ‘Lo! The Lord is come in His great majesty!’ He
> Who is the Father (al-ab) is come, and the Son [ Jesus], in His holy
> vale, crieth out: ‘Here am I, here am I, O Lord, My God!,’ whilst
> Sinai (al-†ùr) circleth around the House (al-bayt), and the Burning Bush
> (al-shajar) calleth aloud: ‘The All-Bounteous is come mounted upon the
clouds (al-sa˙àb)!, (PDC 33; ESW 57; LS 53).

This proclamation is stunning in its eschatological audacity, and rep-
resents a claim that was sure to challenge Russian Orthodoxy, had
sufficient publicity been drawn to it.

4\.2.3. Response
As Bahà"u"llàh’s first epistle to the Czar had never, evidently, reached
its destination, no response was forthcoming.

4\.3. Tablet to Napoleon III

4\.3.1. Transmission
Bahà"u"llàh sent two epistles to Napoleon III (r. 1852–1870). In
response to the first, Napoleon is reportedly exclaimed: “If this man
is God, I am two Gods” (PDC 51). In a letter on behalf of the
Universal House of Justice, the following observation was made: “We
do not know at the present time of any particular material about
Napoleon III with reference to his reported exclamation, ‘If this man
is God, I am two Gods.’ Such matters will undoubtedly be investi-
gated by Bahà"ì historians in the future” (28 July 1971 to an indi-
vidual). Bahà"u"llàh himself writes:

> In proclaiming His Cause, He, in no wise, hesitated. Addressing Himself
> unto the kings and rulers of the earthmay God, exalted be He, assist
> them He imparted unto them that which is the cause of the well-
> being, the unity, the harmony, and the reconstruction of the world,
> and of the tranquility of the nations. Among them was Napoleon III,
> who is reported to have made a certain statement, as a result of Our
> Tablet while in Adrianople. To this, however, he did not reply. After
> Our arrival in the Most Great Prison there reached Us a letter from
> his Minister, the first part of which was in Persian, and the latter in
> his own handwriting. In it he was cordial, and wrote the following: “I
> have, as requested by you, delivered your letter, and until now have
> received no answer. We have, however, issued the necessary recom-
> mendations to our Minister in Constantinople and our consuls in those
> regions. If there be anything you wish done, inform us, and we will
> carry it out.” From his words it became apparent that he understood
> the purpose of this Servant to have been a request for material assis-
> tance. We, therefore, revealed in his (Napoleon III’s) name verses in
> the Sùratu’l-Haykal, some of which We now quote, that thou mayest
> know that the Cause of this Wronged One hath been revealed for the
> sake of God, and hath come from Him. (ESW 45–46)
Regarding this second Tablet to Napoleon, revealed in 1869, it was
spirited out of the prison barracks in the lining of the hat worn by

the Bahà"ì physician referred to in Bahiyyih Khànum’s narrative
(supra and PDC 51). Bahà"u"llàh discloses that: “We bade a Christian
dispatch this Tablet, and he informed Us that he transmitted both
the original and its translation” (ESW 56). Corroboratively, 'Abdu’l-
Bahà" states: “This epistle was sent to Napoleon, by post . . . as was
known to all the companions of His [Bahà"u"llàh’s] exile” (SAQ 33).
It was dispatched by a Christian Arab, Khàjih Louis Catafago (Balyuzi
1980: 320), French consular agent in 'Akkà and Haifa at that time,
who first translated it into French. The son of Catafago became a
Bahà"ì after seeing the fulfillment of Bahà"u"llàh’s prophecies regard-
ing Napoleon come true (RB 3:114).

4\.3.2. Proclamation
Bahà"u"llàh addresses Napoleon, saying: “Give ear, O King, unto
the Voice that calleth from the Fire (al-nàr) which burneth in this
Verdant Tree (al-shajara al-kha∂rà"), upon this Sinai (al-buq'ah al-muqad-
dasah al-bay∂à") which hath been raised above the hallowed and snow-
white Spot, beyond the Everlasting City (qulzum al-baqà")” (ESW 47;
PDC 29; Lambden 1988: 142, who notes that what is here trans-
lated as “Everlasting City” is literally the “Abyss of Eternity”).

4\.3.3. Response
Napoleon’s responses have already been noted above. In his account
of his visit to 'Akkà in March 1874, Shaykh KàΩim Samandar (d.
1918), a notable Bahà"ì of Qazvin later designated by Shoghi Effendi
as an “Apostle of Bahà"u"llàh” (see photos in Balyuzi 1985: 199, 202
and 262), stated that Bahà"u"llàh said that Napoleon III was a god-
less man, and that he had made an idol of his own intellect (Balyuzi
1985: 208).

4\.4. Tablet to Pope Pius IX

4\.4.1. Transmission
Bahà"u"llàh’s Tablet to the Pope is from the “Everlasting Father” to
the “Father” (which is the meaning of the word “Pope”) of the
Catholic Church, which was and still is the largest body of Christians.
The Pope at that time was Count Mastai-Ferretti, former Bishop of
Imola, installed as the 254th pope since the inception of the pri-
macy of St. Peter. For centuries, the Papacy exercised and enjoyed
temporal as well as spiritual sovereignty. To be sure, the Pope was

a political power to be reckoned with in Europe. However, Pius IX,
author of papal Bull, which established the Immaculate Conception
of the Blessed Virgin (1854) and promulgator of the new dogma of
Papal Infallibility (1870) adopted during Vatican I, was a poor states-
man and ruler.

Despite Bahà"u"llàh’s reported statement that the epistles to the
kings and ecclesiastics reached their destination (with the exception
of the Czar of Russia), there is some question as to whether or not
Bahà"u"llàh’s Tablet to the Pope was ever really delivered to Pius
IX. Expressing his doubts, Shoghi Effendi writes:

> It seems likely that Bahà"u"llàh’s Tablet to the Pope was never deliv-
> ered to him. We do not know the method used to transmit it to him,
> and can only guess that Church dignitaries would not have attached
> sufficient importance to it to deliver it. . . . [I]t would be wonderful if
> it were actually found in the Vatican archives. The original was writ-
> ten in Arabic. In 1868 Bahà"u"llàh arrived in 'Akkà, and the Tablet
> was supposedly sent from there about that period. Unfortunately this
> is the closest we can come at present to an accurate date (From a let-
> ter dated 15 November 1947 to an individual believer.)

4\.4.2. Proclamation
In studying this tablet, I have consulted the version in Kitàb-i Mubìn
(AQA I), without critically collating texts. The text, however, appears
to be reliable. I follow Shoghi Effendi’s translation, while supplying
Arabic terms from the original. The Tablet opens:

> O Pope (an yà pàpà)! Rend the veils asunder. He Who is the Lord of
> Lords (rabb al-arbàb) is come overshadowed with clouds (al-sa˙àb, pl.
> su˙ub) . . . On His right hand flow the living waters of grace (kawthar
> al-fa∂l ), and on His left the choice Wine of justice (salsabìl al-'adl ),
> whilst before Him march the angels of Paradise, bearing the banners
> of His signs. . . . Dwellest thou in palaces (al-qußùr) whilst He Who is
> the King of Revelation (sul†àn al-Ωuhùr) liveth in the most desolate of
> abodes ("akhrab al-buyùt)? Leave them unto such as desire them, and
> set thy face with joy and delight (rù˙ wa ray˙àn) towards the Kingdom
> (al-malakùt). . . . Arise in the name of thy Lord, the God of Mercy,
> amidst the peoples of the earth, and seize thou the Cup of Life with
> the hands of confidence, and first drink therefrom, and proffer it then
> to such as turn towards it amongst the peoples of all faiths (ahl al-
> adyàn) . . . (PDC 31; AQA I:38–39)
In this Tablet, Bahà"u"llàh refers to his own station as the “Father”
in three passages. In the first, Bahà"u"llàh proclaims: “The Word (al-
kalima) which the Son concealed is made manifest. It hath been sent

down in the form of the human temple (haykal al-insàn) in this day.
Blessed be the Lord Who is the Father (al-ab)! He, verily, is come
unto the nations in His most great majesty. Turn your faces towards
Him, O concourse of the righteous!” (PDC 32; AQA I:41; cf. Browne’s
trans. in SWEGB 271).

In the second passage, which soon follows the first, Bahà"u"llàh
proclaims:

> This is the day whereon the Rock (Peter) crieth out and shouteth, and
> celebrateth the praise of its Lord, the All-Possessing, the Most High,
> saying: ‘Lo! The Father (al-ab) is come, and that which ye were promised
> in the Kingdom is fulfilled!’ [Browne:] This is a word which was con-
> cealed behind the veil of Might, and when the promised (time) came,
> it shone forth from the horizon of the (Divine) Will with manifest
> signs . . . My body longeth for the cross, and Mine head waiteth for
> the thrust of the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful, that the world
> may be purged from its transgressions . . . (PDC 32; AQA I:41).

Compare Browne’s translation, which reads: “that the world may be
purified from sin” (SWEGB 271; AQA I:41). The Arabic term, al-
'ißyàn, carries the idea of disobedience or mutiny against God (Steingass
852), thus suggesting that Bahà"u"llàh’s concept of sin is focused on
a “falling away” rather than a Catholic notion of “the Fall.”

In the third passage, Bahà"u"llàh uses a different term for the
“Father”: “O people of the Son! We have sent unto you John (the
Baptist) another time . . . This is indeed the Father (al-wàlid ), whereof
Isaiah gave you tidings, and the Comforter (al-mu'azzì ) whom the
Spirit promised” (SWEGB 272; AQA I:44). [Cf. Lambden’s trans-
lation: “This is indeed the Father (al-wàlid ), whereof Isaiah gave you
tidings [Isa. 9:6b] and the Comforter (al-mu'azzì ) whose coming was
promised by the Spirit [ Jesus]” (1983, 47).] This triple reference to
Bahà"u"llàh’s station as the Father appears to reinforce this particu-
lar messianic identification. The following observation was made by
the Rev. Robert Bruce, CMS Missionary to Iran, who wrote in 1894
a report of his contacts with the Bahà"ìs of Isfahan:

> I am just now reading the latest Bible of the Baabis. The sect of Baabis
> which is now increasing in Persia is that called the Bahai. Their chief
> is in Accahe calls himself The Father and says Bab bore to him the
> same relation as John the Baptist did “The Son.” His book is a col-
> lection of Divine Revelations addressed to “The Pope,” “The Queen
> of England,” “The King of Paris” and other crowned heads. In all
> his letters to Christians he never alludes to Mahomed but freely quotes
the N.T. and says his appearance is the fulfillment of the promise of

> the Son that he would return. But that he has returned in the per-
son of the Father.

He says to the Pope: “You dwell in (kasiry which in Arabic means
> both sin and) palaces and I the greatest Manifestation of the Deity
> dwell in the meanest of hovels (the prison). My body is imprisoned to
> give you freedom, it has submitted to dishonour to bring you honour.
> Remember how the Pharisees turned away from the Son. Take care
> that you do not thus turn from the Father. Oh ye monks ye array
> yourselves in gorgeous robes and forget that the robe of God is red
with the blood of enemies.”

I had a great many Baab is with me yesterday including some of
> those who were imprisoned and whom I had got set at liberty. I said
> to them You allow that Christ is the Son, the Word, The Spirit of
> God, even God himself and you say Baha is the Father. What is
> Mahomed then? . . . They would give no answer to this but would talk
> forever of Christ and Baha. (Momen 1982: 63–64)
Rev. Bruce understood quite clearly what Bahà"u"llàh’s messianic
proclamations represented, although the good missionary would doubt-
lessly have regarded these as messianic pretensions.

4\.4.3. Response
On page 44 of the Arabic text, Bahà"u"llàh addresses the followers
of all faiths in his call, literally translated: “O people of religions!
( yà "ahl al-adyàn)”. The Tablet to the Pope concludes: “Verily, He
[ Jesus] said: ‘Come ye after Me, that We may make you to become
fishers of men (ßayyàdì al-insàn).’ In this day, however, We say: ‘Come
ye after Me, that We may make you to become the quickeners of
mankind (mu˙yì al-'àlam)” (PDC 106; AQA I:46; cf. SWEGB 272–273).
Metaphorically in Persian, a ßayyàd is a “ravisher of hearts” (Steingass
796). Foreboding, as it were, of things to come, Bahà"u"llàh urged
the Pope: “Abandon thy kingdom unto the kings” (PB 85). Com-
menting on the utter loss of Papal patrimony in 1870 when King
Victor Emmanuel II waged war against the Papal states and cap-
tured Rome in the process, Shoghi Effendi observes that: “The Tab-
let of Bahà"u"llàh, addressed to Pius IX, precipitated its extinction”
(PDC 53).

4\.5. Tablet to Queen Victoria

4\.5.1. Transmission
In 1936, Shoghi Effendi, the foremost authority of his time on the
writings of Bahà"u"llàh, referred to the Tablet to the Queen as having

been “revealed almost seventy years ago to Queen Victoria,” which
would make the terminus a quo a post-1866 date (WOB 163). This is
corroborated by internal evidence in the Tablet itself, in which ref-
erence is made to the Sùrat al-Mulùk (Sura of the Kings), an earlier
work revealed circa 1866 in Edirne (= Adrianople). The precise start-
ing point is 31 August 1868, the date of Bahà"u"llàh’s arrival at the
prison-fortress of 'Akkà, as indicated by Bahà"u"llàh himself: “Upon
Our arrival at this Prison, We purposed to transmit to the kings the
messages of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Though We
have transmitted to them, in several Tablets, that which We were
commanded, yet We do it once again, as a token of God’s grace”
(GPB 206).

In an earlier letter dated 1931, Shoghi Effendi wrote, “Over sixty
years ago, in His Tablet to Queen Victoria,” establishing a pre-1871
date as a terminus ad quem (WOB 39). The more precise point of ter-
mination would be 4 November 1870, marking the end of Bahà"u"llàh’s
confinement in the army barracks of 'Akkà. Balyuzi notes that
Bahà"u"llàh and his family and companions were confined to the
barracks for two years, two months and five days (1980: 319, n. 3).
There appears to be a consensus that the Tablet to Queen Victoria
was revealed during this period of confinement, although support-
ing evidence is lacking. Browne concludes: “Most of these letters
appear to have been written about the same time, viz. soon after
the arrival of Beha [sic] at Acre (A.H. 1285–86, A.D. 1868–69)”
(1987: 260).

In any event, actual delivery of the Tablet to the British monarch
herself appears to be uncertain. Bahà"u"llàh, in his last major work,
Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, expresses the wish that: “Likewise, We
mention some verses from the Tablet of Her Majesty, the Queen
[Queen Victoria] may God, exalted and glorified be He, assist her.
Our purpose is that haply the breezes of Revelation may envelop
thee, and cause thee to arise, wholly for the sake of God, and serve
His Cause, and that thou mayest transmit any of the Tablets of the
kings which might have remained undelivered. This mission is a
great mission, and this service a great service” (ESW 59).

4\.5.2. Proclamation
In his Tablet to Victoria (r. 1830–1901), Queen of Great Britain
and Queen-Empress of India, Bahà"u"llàh opens by saying: “O Queen
in London! Incline thine ear unto the voice (nidà", lit. “call”) of thy

Lord, the Lord of all mankind, calling from the Divine Lote-Tree
(al-sidrat al-ilàhiyyat): Verily, no God is there but Me, the Almighty,
the All-Wise! Cast away all that is on earth, and attire the head of
thy kingdom with the crown of the remembrance of thy Lord (dhikr
rabbiki al-jalìl ), the All-Glorious. He, in truth, hath come unto the
world in His most great glory (majdih al-a'Ωam), and all that hath been
mentioned in the Gospel hath been fulfilled (kamula ma dhukira fi al-
injìl )” (ESW 59–60; PDC 35; PB 33; LS 59). Note that, before the
mention of any of his world reforms, Bahà"u"llàh establishes his divine
authority on the basis of his prophetic credentials.

4\.5.3. Response
He then proceeds to praise Queen Victoria for her abolition of slav-
ery, and for her support of parliamentary democracy (LS 59).
Bahà"u"llàh even reveals a short prayer for British parliamentarians
who, before entering the Parliament to carry on the work of pass-
ing legislation, should pray: “O my God! I beseech Thee, by Thy
most glorious Name, to assist me in that which will cause the affairs
of Thy servants to prosper, and Thy cities to flourish. Thou, indeed,
hast power over all things!” (LS 59–60; cf. Monjazeb 1993: 6). The
legislators are then called upon to exercise “pure justice” ('adl al-
khàliß) and to deliberate on the needs of the world (LS 60).

Bahà"u"llàh then develops an extended metaphor, that of the world
as a sick patient, suffering various maladies and disorders. It is in
need of a divine Physician (Bahà"u"llàh), who has his finger on the
pulse of the world and can prescribe a cure for its ills. And then
these famous words are given: “That which the Lord hath ordained
as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of
all the world is the union of its peoples in one universal Cause, one
common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved except through the
power of a skilled, an all-powerful and inspired Physician” (GWB
255). It is here where Bahà"u"llàh shifts from Physician to World
Reformer, counselling the kings and rulers, who had not acted on
Bahà"u"llàh’s previous request, as stated in the Sùrat al-Mulùk, to
establish the “Most Great Peace,” to establish a less comprehensive
settlement referred to in Bahà"ì terms as the “Great Peace” (as con-
trasted to the “Most Great Peace”), more commonly known as the
“Lesser Peace”:

> “Consider these days in which He Who is the Ancient Beauty hath
> come in the Most Great Name, that He may quicken the world and

> unite its peoples. They, however, rose up against Him with sharpened
> swords, and committed that which caused the Faithful Spirit (al-rù˙ al-
> amìn) to lament, until in the end they imprisoned Him in the most
> desolate of cities ['Akkà], and broke the grasp of the faithful upon the
> hem of His robe. Were anyone to tell them: ‘The World-Reformer
> (mußli˙ al-'àlam) is come,’ they would answer and say: ‘Indeed it is
> proven that He is a fomenter of discord!’, and this notwithstanding
> that they have never associated with Him, and have perceived that He
> did not seek, for one moment, to protect Himself ” (ESW 63; LS 60).

Bahà"u"llàh concludes the Tablet with a prayer revealed for the
Queen, in which she should beseech God to assist her to “aid Thy
Cause in Thy lands” (PDC 36; LS 62).

In The Dawn-Breakers: Nabìl’s Narrative of the Early Days of the Bahà"ì
Revelation (Nabìl-i A'Ωam 1996: 586), we are told that most of Bahà"u"l-
làh’s Tablets to kings and ecclesiastics had been delivered to their
recipients. What, then, was Queen Victoria’s response? Shoghi Effendi
has written that Queen Victoria, in response to reading Bahà"u"llàh’s
letter to her in translation: “If this is of God, it will endure; if not,
it can do no harm” (PDC 65). However, this must be qualified as
hearsay, as Shoghi Effendi himself duly noted: “. . . as we have no
written statement to this effect, we cannot be sure about it. We do
not know where the original of this statement is” (21 February 1942
to an individual, qtd. in Research Department memorandum).

Bahà"u"llàh interpreted the very prophecies he was to fulfill. In a
tablet described by E.G. Browne (SWEGB 257), Bahà"u"llàh states:
“I revealed all the heavenly books by the glorious tongue of Divine
Might” (kull-i kutub-i samavì bi-lisàn-i jalìl-i qudrat nàzil farmùdam).
Prophecy, being a truth-claim liable to denial, is typically not in
alignment with popular expectations. This fact alone may explain
why the response to Bahà"u"llàh’s message was so lacking.

5. Conclusions

5\.1. The Eschatology of Globalization
Globalization refers to “both the compression of the world and
intensification of consciousness of the world as a whole” and as “both
concrete global interdependence and consciousness of the global
whole” (Robertson 1992: 8). It is further defined as “the intensification
of worldwide social relations which link distant localities in such a
way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many

miles away and vice versa” (Giddens 1990: 64). Ethical responses to
globalization are essentially world order issues (Lerche 1998), in a
search for values of egalitarianism, equity, and sustainability a world-
view that some have called “globalism” (Ritchie 1996). As a response
to globalization, globalism may be viewed as a reflex or extension
of Kantian cosmopolitanism as the “moral universalism of inter-
national relations” (Robinson 1996: 4).

Bahà"ìs often assert that, since Bahà"u"llàh anticipated modernity,
then he must have been a prime mover of it. Historically, it can be
observed that Bahà"u"llàh was a sudden sparkle of the nineteenth-
centurya flash of visionary brilliance. And it may be safe to say that
Bahà"u"llàh and modernity are dynamically coincidental and, apart
from directions of influence, that Bahà"u"llàh was engaged in dialec-
tic with modernity.

Regarding Bahà"u"llàh’s world reforms and their historical signifi-
cance, 'Abdu’l-Bahà" observed: “These precepts were proclaimed by
Bahà"u"llàh many years ago. He was the first to create them in the
hearts as moral laws. Writing to the sovereigns of the world, he sum-
moned them to universal brotherhood, proclaiming that the hour for
unity had struck unity between countries, unity between religions”
(DP 85). This sympathetic appraisal of the historical significance of
Bahà"u"llàh’s international peace mission reinforces our hypothesis:
viz., that Bahà"u"llàh’s signal contribution to globalization was to
ethicize and sacralize it. Bahà"u"llàh’s “multiple-messiahship” fur-
nished the divine authority necessary if ever his world reforms were
to be taken seriously. This is Bahà"u"llàh’s eschatology of globalization.
